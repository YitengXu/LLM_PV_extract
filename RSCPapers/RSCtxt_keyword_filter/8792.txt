    , Accepted 13th June 2015First published on 15th June 2015AbstractTwo porphyrin-chromophores, i.e. triad PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 (GZ-T1) and dyad (PorZn)2-NMe2 (GZ-D1), have been synthesized and their photophysical and electrochemical properties have been investigated. The optical properties together with the appropriate electronic energy levels, i.e. the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, revealed that both porphyrin assemblies can function as sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The GZ-T1 and GZ-D1-based DSSCs have been prepared and studied using 20 mM CDCA as coadsorbent and were found to exhibit an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.88% and 4.56%, respectively (under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with TiO2 films of 12 μm). The higher PCE of the GZ-T1-sensitized DSSC, as revealed from the current–voltage characteristic under illumination and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two DSSCs, is mainly attributed to its enhanced short circuit current (Jsc), although both the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor are improved too. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) demonstrated a shorter electron transport time, longer electron lifetime and higher charge recombination resistance for the DSSC sensitized with the dye GZ-T1 as well as a larger dye loading onto the TiO2 surface.
Introduction
Nowadays, as the energy demand increases worldwide and the fossil fuel reserves wear out, research has been redirected towards renewable energy sources in the aim of sustainable progress and development. Along these lines, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), first reported by Grätzel in 1991,1 have been the focus of these efforts to improve photovoltaic technology, due to their potential direct application as they are low-cost, easy to fabricate and have high power conversion efficiency.2 A typical DSSC consists of a dye sensitized photoanode (generally TiO2) and a platinum (Pt) counter electrode sandwiching an electrolyte that contains a redox mediator. Upon absorption of light, an electron is injected from the photoexcited dye into the TiO2 conduction band (CB). While the injected electrons move through the external circuit to the counter electrode, the oxidized dye is reduced by the redox shuttle, which is an iodine (I−) ion or a Co2+ complex in the electrolyte (dye regeneration). Finally, the I− ion or the Co2+ complex is regenerated by the reduction of the corresponding I3− ion or Co3+ complex at the surface of the counter electrode completing the circuit. A key component of these devices is the sensitizing dye which is responsible for solar energy capturing and its subsequent conversion into electrical energy. Ruthenium-dyes, such as N3 and N719, have been reported with PCEs that surpass 11%,3 but their widespread applications are hampered due to the high cost and difficult synthesis of ruthenium complexes. In the view of the above limitations of ruthenium based sensitizers, efficient metal free organic dyes4 have been explored, owing their potential to a low production cost and facile modulation of their structure. Furthermore, their optical and electrochemical properties, i.e. their absorption profiles as well as their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, are such that they allow them to successfully mimic the ruthenium based dyes. A number of organic dyes have been reported in DSSCs to achieve relatively high PCE values with the best one as high as 10.3%.4c On the other hand, researchers have attempted to utilize porphyrins as sensitizers for DSSCs due to their intense absorption bands in the visible region of the solar spectrum, the versatile modification of their core, and the facile tuning of their electrochemical properties.5,2a Porphyrin sensitizers exhibit a strong absorption at the Soret region (400–450 nm) and at the Q band region (500–700 nm). They offer the great advantage of adjusting the electronic levels of their macrocycles by simply changing the porphyrin substituents at the meso and β-positions, or by changing the complexed metal, with ZnII proving to be the best choice for obtaining efficient sensitizers.6 A PCE of 12.3% has been achieved in a DSSC co-sensitized by the D–π–A porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 (N,N′-diphenyl amine acts as the donor, the porphyrin macrocycle acts as the π spacer, and the ethynylbenzoic acid moiety serves as an acceptor), and the organic dye Y123 with a cobalt-based redox electrolyte.7 Recently, Grätzel's research group sensitized a DSSC using the modified porphyrin dye SM315, which introduced a benzothiadiazole (BTD) group between the porphyrin ring and the anchoring acceptor, achieving a PCE value of 13%.8
The light harvesting ability of porphyrins in visible and NIR regions can be increased by incorporating π-chromophores into porphyrins through conjugated bridges,9 fused porphyrins10 and various covalent–non-covalent porphyrin arrays.11 Kim et al. designed a meso–meso linked porphyrin dimer which was used as a DSSC sensitizer and achieved a PCE value of 4.2%.12 The HOMO and LUMO of the dimer have the same energy as those of the corresponding porphyrin monomers and the dimer shows much broader absorption bands, induced by exciton coupling. Segawa and coworkers reported a series of efficient meso–meso ethynyl-linked porphyrin oligomers as sensitizers.13 Aiming to strengthen the push–pull character of such systems, they introduced an electron donating amino moiety at the meso position of one of the porphyrin units, which achieved a PCE value of 5.2%.13a Furthermore, they reported an ethynyl-linked porphyrin triad for DSSCs and achieved a PCE value of 3.2%.13c Although ethynyl-linked porphyrins revealed a broad absorption extended to the NIR region, the maximum IPCE values are limited up to only 40% probably due to insufficient electron injection and aggregation tendency. The enhancement of push–pull structures and a well-designed gradient of the energy levels of hetero-porphyrin arrays would require more consideration to strengthen the intermolecular CT character, leading to efficient electron injection and higher PCE values.
The 1,3,5-triazine moiety has been used as a linker for the synthesis of metal free organic dyes used as sensitizers for DSSCs and other photoconductive materials.14 The structural, chemical and electronic properties of this unit allow the synthesis through simple organic reactions15 of complex π-conjugated multi-chromophore dyes that offer improved light harvesting abilities, as well as improved electron injection and transportation rates.16 Liu et al. reported a solar cell sensitized by a triazine-based metal-free organic dye with a D–π–A structure that showed a PCE value of 3.63%.17 Triazine-bridged porphyrin arrays have also been used as electron donors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells by Luechai et al.18 and recently by our research group.19 Moreover, our group has recently developed a synthetic approach towards oligomeric porphyrinic derivatives with carboxylic acid anchoring groups.20 Following this approach, we synthesized porphyrin dyads or triads, where the porphyrin precursors were linked either through an esteric20a or an amide bond,20b also either a triazine group,20c–f or a triazole group20g obtained via click chemistry. Similarly, we reported trimeric porphyrin systems either with linear20b or star-type20f architectures. These molecular systems were used as sensitizers in DSSCs showing moderate PCE values. The first porphyrin dyads that we reported, based on a triazine scaffold, were functionalized with a glycine anchoring group, which resulted in PCE values of 3.61% and 4.46%.20c In order to investigate the effect of the anchoring groups on the solar cell efficiency, we synthesized triazine linked porphyrin dyads with two and one carboxylic acid anchoring groups, and we found that the former exhibit superior performance over the latter (5.28% vs. 3.50%, respectively).20d Aiming to examine the effect of the number of chromophore units on the photovoltaic performance, we synthesized a propeller-shaped porphyrin triad with a carboxylic acid anchoring group on one of the porphyrin units, which showed a slightly higher PCE value of 5.56%.20f Furthermore, taking advantage of other chromophores, such as BODIPY (BDP), we reported a porphyrin-bis(BDP) triad which yielded a PCE value of 5.17%.20h
Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of two novel porphyrin dyes, i.e. the PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 linear triad and (PorZn)2-NMe2 dyad, denoted as GZ-T1 and GZ-D1, respectively, both of which are functionalized by two carboxylic acid anchoring groups. The optical absorption spectra and frontier orbital energy levels of these compounds make them promising candidates as DSSC sensitizers. The PCE values of GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 based DSSCs were found to be 5.88% and 4.56%, respectively, using 20 mM of CDCA as coadsorbent. The current voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination as well as the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs based on GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 reveal that the higher value of PCE for the former, as compared to the one of the latter, is attributed to the enhanced value of the short circuit current (Jsc), although other parameters such as the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor were also enhanced. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectra of the devices also revealed that the recombination resistance and the electron lifetime for solar cells sensitized with GZ-T1 are higher than those of DSSCs based on GZ-D1, leading to suppressed back electron recombination and reduced dark current, which is essential for efficient DSSCs.

Fabrication and characterization of the DSSCs
A detailed description of the preparation of the DSSCs was reported elsewhere by our research group.20 The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley source meter, under standard air mass (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), using a xenon lamp coupled with an optical filter. The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs were recorded using a system consisting of a monochromator and a xenon lamp, and the photocurrent in short-circuit conditions was measured using a Keithley electrometer. The EIS measurements of the DSSCs, in the dark as well under illumination, were carried out by applying a bias equivalent to the open circuit voltage, recording over a frequency of 0.1–100 kHz with an alternating-current amplitude of 10 mV. The above measurements were carried out using a CHN electrochemical workstation equipped with the FRA software to analyze the data.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
As shown in Scheme 1, the porphyrin triad PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 (GZ-T1), consists of a meso aryl-substituted zinc metallated porphyrin unit, Zn[Por(NH2)2] (namely 5,15-bis(4-aminophenyl)-10,20-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) porphyrin zinc), which is connected, through its aryl-amino groups at its periphery, with two other meso aryl-substituted free-base porphyrin units, abbreviated as PorCOOH (namely 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-15-(4-aminophenyl)-10,20-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)porphyrin), by using two 1,3,5-triazine moieties as bridges. Each of the peripheral free-base porphyrin units contains, also, a carboxylic acid as an anchoring group, for attachment onto the TiO2 surface of the DSSC electrodes. On the other hand, the porphyrin dyad (PorZn)2-NMe2 (GZ-D1) contains two meso-substituted zinc metallated porphyrin moieties, connected to each other through their aryl-amino groups at their peripheries by a 1,3,5-triazine moiety. Each of the porphyrin moieties bears an anchoring carboxyl group. In addition, the 1,3,5-triazine moiety is covalently attached to a dimethylamine group, making the whole compound of a “push–pull” structure.28 This property is based on a “donor–π–acceptor” (D–π–A) architecture, where π is considered to be the π-conjugated porphyrin unit connected to the triazine moiety, D represents the dimethylamine group and A is the carboxylic acid anchoring group.
 Scheme 1  The chemical structures of the linear triad GZ-T1 and the dyad GZ-D1. 
The syntheses of the triad and the dyad, shown in Schemes 2 and 3, respectively, were accomplished via stepwise amination reactions of cyanuric chloride, which is the precursor of the bridging 1,3,5-triazine group of the triad. Cyanuric chloride in known to provide access to a variety of triazine-bridged assemblies, such as macrocycles,29 dendrimers,30 and multiporphyrin arrays.31,32 Furthermore, we have recently reported symmetrical and unsymmetrical triazine-bridged porphyrin dyads and triads.19,20
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of triad GZ-T1. 
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of dyad GZ-D1. 
The initial step for the synthesis of the triad PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 (GZ-T1) involves, after the zinc metallation of Por(NH2)2, the reaction of one equivalent of Zn[Por(NH2)2] (1) with two equivalents of cyanuric chloride, in the presence of the base DIPEA at 0 °C in THF (Scheme 2). TLC indicating the disappearance of the reactants monitored the reaction and the formation of the porphyrin adduct 1a. The latter was not isolated but further reacted at room temperature with the PorCOOH moiety, followed by the substitution of the third chlorine atom of cyanuric chloride by an excess of piperidine, in a one-pot reaction at 65 °C. As a result, the desired PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 triad (GZ-T1) was produced, as confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF spectrometry. It is worth mentioning that in the 1H NMR spectrum of PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 (GZ-T1), the signals of the aromatic hydrogen atoms of the ortho position to the amino groups of the PorCOOH moiety, after attachment to the triazine ring, are shifted downfield compared to those of free PorCOOH.
The synthesis of the dyad (PorZn)2-NMe2 (GZ-D1) follows a similar manner. First, one equivalent of cyanuric chloride reacted with one equivalent of H2(Por), in the presence of the base DIPEA at 0 °C in THF (Scheme 3). The reaction was monitored by TLC and upon disappearance of the reactants, an excess of H2(Por) was added, at room temperature, producing the porphyrin adduct 3. The substitution of the third chlorine atom of cyanuric chloride by an excess of dimethylamine, in a one-pot reaction at 65 °C, resulted in the formation of the precursor porphyrin dyad (4), as confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF spectrometry. Next, zinc metallation of the porphyrin units of 4 and basic hydrolysis of the ester groups in their peripheries produced the desired final (PorZn)2-NMe2 dyad (GZ-D1), as confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF spectrometry.

Both GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 show the characteristic absorption bands of porphyrins, i.e. an intense Soret band in the 420–440 nm range and moderate Q bands between 500 nm and 680 nm. The absorption spectra of both porphyrins adsorbed onto TiO2 films were also obtained (red line in Fig. 1(a) and (b)), in order to get information about their light harvesting ability when they are used as sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells. Compared to the corresponding solution spectra, the absorption bands of both GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 adsorbed on the TiO2 film are broader and red-shifted due to the interactions between the porphyrins and the TiO2 surface. The optical band gaps of GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 adsorbed onto TiO2 were estimated from the absorption onset edge of the absorption spectra and they are found to be about 1.82 eV and 1.92 eV, respectively. The steady state fluorescence (FL) spectra of GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 in THF solution are shown in Fig. 2 (black and red lines, respectively). The excitation of both porphyrins at their Soret bands results in photoluminescence with two peaks of unequal intensities at 609 nm and 658 nm for GZ-D1 and three peaks at 660 nm (intense), 609 nm and 716 nm (low intensity) for GZ-T1. A significant spectral shift was obtained for GZ-T1 compared to GZ-D1, which is similar to the Q-band absorption pattern obtained in optical absorption spectra. These results indicate that triad GZ-T1 has increased conjugation compared to dyad GZ-D1, a feature that could differentiate their optical properties and in turn the photocurrent generated in DSSC devices.

The 0–0 transition energy (E0–0) values were estimated for the GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 from the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra in THF solution and they are found to be 1.94 eV and 2.04 eV, respectively. The low value of E0–0 for GZ-T1 is in accordance with the increase in conjugation length.
Electronic properties
The electrochemical properties of porphyrin compounds GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry measurements, in order to determine the feasibility of electron injection from the excited state of porphyrins into the conduction band of TiO2 as well as their regeneration by the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte. The cyclic voltammograms of both porphyrin dyes in DCM are displayed in Fig. 3 and electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. Both porphyrins GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 exhibit the first reversible oxidation process at potentials of E1ox 0.67 V vs. SCE and 1.03 V vs. SCE, respectively and the first reversible reduction at potentials of E1red −1.30 V vs. SCE and −1.38 V vs. SCE, respectively. In DSSCs, for an efficient electron injection from the excited state of sensitizer into the CB of TiO2, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (first reduction potential observed in CV) should be higher (more negative) than the CB edge (−0.74 V vs. SCE) of TiO2. Both porphyrin compounds GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 show indeed E1red values which are more negative than the CB edge of TiO2, suggesting that there is sufficient driving force for electron injection from their excited state into the CB of TiO2. On the other hand, in order to ensure the efficient regeneration of the sensitizer (after electron injection) in the DSSC, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (corresponding to its first oxidation potential E1ox) should be lower than the corresponding redox potential of the electrolyte redox couple employed in the DSSC, i.e. I3−/I− (0.4 V vs. SCE). The potentials E1ox for both GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 are more positive than the corresponding electrolyte redox potential, and therefore, regeneration of the porphyrin dyes, after the electron injection, is thermodynamically feasible.28,33

FT-IR spectroscopy
Concerning the binding to TiO2, while both the porphyrin dyes contain carboxylic acid groups which are known to be very good anchoring groups to the TiO2 surface, triad porphyrin dye GZ-T1 in addition contains two piperidine binding sites that could also act as an anchoring group to the TiO2 surface through its basic sp3 hybridized N atom. In order to get information about the binding strength of GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 onto the TiO2 surface, FTIR powder spectra were recorded in pure form and adsorbed on TiO2 films. In the FTIR spectrum of GZ-T1 in pure form (Fig. 4, black color) the absorption band at 1686 cm−1 corresponds to the ν(COO) stretching vibration of carboxylic acid groups,34 and it disappears upon adsorption onto the TiO2 surface while two new bands at 1404 cm−1 and 1532 cm−1, corresponding to νsymm(COO−) and νasym(COO−) stretching vibrations, are observed (Fig. 4, red color). The FTIR spectra of pure GZ-D1 and GZ-D1/TiO2 are similar. These observations indicate that both compounds GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 are strongly bound to the TiO2 surface through their carboxylic acid anchoring groups. Moreover, in the FTIR spectrum of GZ-T1 in pure form, there are two additional absorption bands at 1634 cm−1 and 3310 cm−1 (the latter not shown in the figure), which are not observed in the FTIR spectrum of GZ-D1. These bands can be assigned to the ν(CN) and ν(N–H) stretching vibrations of the piperidine rings respectively and they disappear when GZ-T1 is adsorbed onto the TiO2 film. This suggests that in triad GZ-T1, in addition to the carboxylic acid anchoring group, the piperidine ring might also be involved in the binding to the TiO2 surface, through the nitrogen atom.

DFT calculations
In order to further explore the molecular structures, as well as to get insight into the electron density distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the porphyrin triad PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 (GZ-T1) and the porphyrin dyad (PorZn)2-NMe2 (GZ-D1), DFT calculations were carried out.
The gas-phase geometry optimized structures of the two compounds are presented in Fig. 5, while the corresponding coordinates are provided in Tables S1 and S2 respectively (see ESI†). In triad GZ-T1, three almost co-planar porphyrin units are bridged by two perpendicularly oriented triazine groups (see also Fig. S1†). Dyad GZ-D1 is found to exhibit a similar structure with the central triazine group adopting a perpendicular orientation with respect to the two terminal porphyrin units (see also Fig. S2†). Therefore, in both cases the bridging triazine units do not allow the formation of extended π-conjugated systems, a fact that has a profound effect on the electronic communication between the porphyrin units.

The electron density maps and the corresponding energies of the FMOs of triad GZ-T1 and dyad GZ-D1 are depicted in the upper and lower part of Fig. 6, respectively. Regarding triad GZ-T1, in two of the highest-energy molecular orbitals (HOMO and HOMO−3) the electron density is mainly spread over the central zinc-porphyrin unit and partially on the bridging triazine groups. The four lowest-energy unoccupied molecular orbitals are very close in energy, while their corresponding electron densities are predominantly located on either of the two terminal free-base porphyrin units, with some additional contributions on the respective carboxylic acid groups and bridging phenyl groups. Porphyrin triad GZ-T1 can be described as a “push–pull” D–π–2A system, with the central zinc-porphyrin unit as the donor D group, the terminal free-base porphyrin units with the carboxylic acid groups as the acceptor A groups, and π denoting the triazine ring. Therefore, upon photo-excitation, the intramolecular electron transfer from the zinc-porphyrin to the free-base porphyrin units and the subsequent electron injection through the carboxylic acid groups into the TiO2 conduction band are favorable.
 Fig. 6  Frontier molecular orbitals of PorZn-(PorCOOH)2-(piper)2 (GZ-T1, upper part) and (PorZn)2-NMe2 (GZ-D1, lower part) and the corresponding energy levels. 
The electronic density distributions in the frontier orbitals of GZ-D1 revealed that the LUMO orbitals are very close comparing their energy levels. The electron density of the HOMO orbitals is located on the porphyrin units and on the bridging triazine unit, while the density of the LUMO is located on the phenyl ring bearing the carboxylic acid. Those attributes propose that GZ-D1 is a “push–pull” D–π–A system with each porphyrin unit acting as donor and acceptor in separate cases. In the cases of the HOMO and HOMO−2, one zinc porphyrin acts as a donor group while the other zinc porphyrin acts as an acceptor (LUMO and LUMO+2). On the contrary the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 reveal that the role of each porphyrin is inverted. Consequently, GZ-D1 advances the electron injection and possesses suitable frontier orbital energy levels for use as a sensitizer in DSSCs.
The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies, dipole moments and HOMO–LUMO gaps in dichloromethane as a solvent medium for compounds GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 are presented in Table 2. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of both compounds are found to be similar to the corresponding values obtained from the electrochemistry measurements presented in Table 1.

TDDFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using the calculated geometry-optimized coordinates of the compounds GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 were carried out in order to extract their theoretical UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. S3 and S4 in ESI†) and the electronic transitions with the molecular orbital composition (Table 3). The results for triad GZ-T1 revealed intense peaks at 549.7 nm, 545.0 nm and 543.2 nm with oscillator strengths of 0.1739, 0.0889 and 0.0853, respectively. The contributions referred to the above peaks involve transitions mainly from HOMO−3 → LUMO+4, HOMO → LUMO+5, HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 and HOMO−2 → LUMO+2 (Table 3). These can be assigned to porphyrin-based π–π* transitions and correspond to the porphyrin Q-bands. Two more intense peaks are found at higher wavelengths, namely at 580.6 nm and 578.9 nm with oscillator strengths of 0.0742 and 0.607 respectively, which implicates the contributions from the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1, HOMO−1 → LUMO+3, HOMO−2 → LUMO+1 and HOMO−2 → LUMO+3 transitions. One more high intensity peak appears at 453.3 nm with a 0.0217 oscillator strength, which mainly involves the contribution from the HOMO−1 → LUMO+4 transition and corresponds to the porphyrin Soret band. In the case of the theoretically calculated UV-Vis spectrum of dyad GZ-D1 (Fig. S4†), intense absorption peaks are found in the region from 390 nm to 425 nm, which corresponds to the Soret band of the porphyrin units. The oscillator strengths and the contribution of the FMOs for these peaks are listed in Table 3. One more peak at 549.5 nm with a 0.126 oscillator strength is observed, which mainly involves the contribution from the HOMO → LUMO+1 transition and corresponds to the porphyrin Q-band.

Photovoltaic properties
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination of the DSSCs based on the GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 porphyrin dyes, in identical conditions are shown in Fig. 7(a) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. The DSSC sensitized with GZ-T1 exhibits Jsc = 12.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V and FF = 0.71, resulting in an overall PCE value of 5.88%, whereas, the DSSC based on the GZ-D1 sensitizer displays a lower PCE value of 4.56% with Jsc = 10.32 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.65 V and FF = 0.68. The higher value of PCE for the solar cell sensitized with the GZ-T1 porphyrin dye is mainly attributed to the enhanced value of Jsc, although other photovoltaic parameters, i.e. Voc and FF are also slightly improved compared to those of the DSSC sensitized with porphyrin dye GZ-D1. The higher value for the DSSC based on triad GZ-T1 is consistent with its larger IPCE values as shown in Fig. 7(b). The IPCE spectra of both DSSCs closely resemble the corresponding absorption spectra of the porphyrins adsorbed onto the TiO2 film. The fact that the IPCE values in the Q-band regions are similar to those of the Soret band is attributed to the scattering by the TiO2 nanoparticles that increases the photocurrent in the relatively weak absorption region.35

The higher Jsc value for the DSSC based on triad GZ-T1 is consistent with its larger values of IPCE as well as the broader profile compared to the DSSC based on dyad GZ-D1 (Fig. 7b). The IPCE is expressed as:IPCE = LHE × xηinj × ηccwhere LHE is the light harvesting efficiency which depends on the absorption strength of the sensitizer, ηinj is the electron injection efficiency which depends on the electron injection rate from the sensitizer into the conduction band of TiO2 after the photoexcitation of the sensitizer, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency which depends on the competition between the transportation of electrons towards the external circuit and the recombination of the electrons in TiO2 with the redox couple in the electrolyte. Among these three factors, LHE plays a key role in the efficiency of the DSSCs and it is expressed as LHE = (1 − 10−εΓ), where ε is the molar extinction coefficient of the dye and Γ is the molar concentration of the dye loaded per surface area of the TiO2 film. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that the DSSC based on GZ-T1 exhibits a higher LHE value than the GZ-D1 based DSSC. In order to estimate the dye loading values of these DSSCs, the dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a mixture of THF and NaOH (aq.) solution, and the absorption spectra of these desorbed dye solutions were measured. The dye loading values were found to be 4.42 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 3.23 × 10−7 mol cm−2, for the GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 sensitized TiO2 electrodes, respectively. The higher dye loading for GZ-T1 compared to GZ-D1 may be explained by the presence of the additional piperidine binding site presented in triad GZ-T1 which is involved in the attachment to the TiO2 surface through nitrogen atoms, as confirmed by the FTIR spectrum (vide supra).
 Fig. 8  Variation of LHE as a function of wavelength for the DSSCs based on porphyrin dyes GZ-T1 and GZ-D1. 
The higher value of LHE could lower the conduction band edge of TiO2 upon dye uptake of the GZ-T1 based DSSC, which might lead to a larger electron injection rate to give a high electron yield for this device. This may lead to the formation of a blocking layer caused by the higher dye loading.36
On the basis of J–V characteristics in the dark (Fig. 9), the DSSC based on GZ-T1 shows a lower dark current than the GZ-D1-sensitized solar cell, which is directly related to the back electron recombination with the redox couple in the electrolyte. So, the lower electron recombination rate observed in the GZ-T1 sensitized DSSC as compared to GZ-D1 depends mainly on the amount of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface and in turn on the degree of coverage of the sensitizing dye on the surface of TiO2. As discussed above, the larger dye loading amount for the DSSC based on GZ-T1 forms a blocking layer which prevents the charge recombination between the injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and I3− in the electrolyte. However, for porphyrin dyad GZ-D1, possessing a lower dye loading value, which results in a lower surface coverage on the TiO2 surface, the I3− ions of the electrolyte can penetrate closely to the surface of the TiO2, decreasing the barrier for electron recombination with I3−, resulting in a higher dark current.
 Fig. 9  Dark current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs based on GZ-T1 and GZ-D1. 
The difference in the PCE value of solar cells sensitized with these two porphyrin dyes GZ-T1 (triad) and GZ-D1 (dyad) can also be related to their molecular structures. Considering that a Zn metallated porphyrin acts as an electron donor and a free base porphyrin unit as an electron acceptor, triad GZ-T1 can be considered as A–π–D–π–A and dyad GZ-D1 as D–π–D with common anchoring carboxylic acid units, where π is denoted as the triazine π-bridge. With porphyrin dye GZ-T1 bearing a D–π–A “push–pull” unit, a more effective electron injection in the GZ-T1-based DSSC is facilitated, resulting in higher values of Jsc and PCE.
The charge transfer and recombination processes occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface as important factors influencing the PCE value of the DSSC have been analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).37Fig. 10 shows the EIS spectra of the GZ-T1- and GZ-D1-based DSSCs, in the dark under a forward bias equivalent to the open circuit of the DSSC. In general, the Nyquist plots of EIS in the dark showed three semicircles, in the frequency range 0.1–100 kHz. The semicircle radius in the high frequency range (left side) represents the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The charge recombination at TiO2/dye/electrolyte corresponds to the semicircle in the middle frequency range. In the lowest frequency range, the impedance is associated with the Warburg diffusion processes of I3− in the electrolyte. As shown from the Nyquist plots of EIS (Fig. 10a), the radius of the semicircle in the middle frequency range is larger for the DSSC based on GZ-T1 compared to the one based on GZ-D1, indicating large recombination resistance (Rrec) which in turn means a slow recombination rate. The electron lifetime (τe) was calculated from the peak frequency (fpeak) that corresponds to the middle frequency range in the Bode phase plot (Fig. 10b), according to the relationship τe = 1/2πfpeak. According to this formula, the electron lifetimes for the DSSCs based on GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 are found to be 32 ms and 25 ms, respectively, indicating that the charge recombination is suppressed for GZ-T1, compared to GZ-D1. The higher electron lifetime for GZ-T1 relative to GZ-D1 could be attributed to the D–π–A nature of GZ-T1 which disturbs the dispersion forces by trapping I3− near the porphyrin more effectively, preventing the approach of I3− towards the TiO2 surface.
 Fig. 10  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode phase plots of EIS in the dark for the DSSCs based on the GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 porphyrin dyes. 
To get more information about the charge transport process in the DSSCs, we have also measured EIS under illumination at a bias voltage equivalent to the Voc of the devices, and Nyquist plots for the DSSCs based on GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 are shown in Fig. 11. The semicircle in the intermediate frequency region corresponds to the charge transport process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface after photoexcitation. The radius of this semicircle is a measure of the charge transport resistance (Rct) and it is smaller for the solar cell sensitized with GZ-T1 than that with GZ-D1, resulting in a low value of Rct, indicating a fast transport of electrons in the TiO2 film towards the FTO electrode. The electron transport time (τd) of an injected electron in the TiO2 film is related with τe, τd, Rrec and Rct as follows:  
 Fig. 11  Nyquist plots of EIS under illumination for the DSSCs sensitized with GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 porphyrin dyes. 
The electrochemical parameters, i.e. Rrec, Rct, τe and τd, are summarized in Table 5. The electron transport time is a measure of the average time taken for an electron to be collected by the FTO during its transportation through the TiO2 film, with a faster electron transport time associated with a higher photocurrent.38 The decrease in Rct and the increase in Rrec for the solar cell sensitized with GZ-T1 indicate that the electron transport resistance and electron transport time decrease for the solar cell sensitized with GZ-T1 as compared to that with GZ-D1.

Besides all the above parameters, the charge collection efficiency is also an important factor for achieving a high PCE value of a DSSC device. So, the charge collection efficiency of the GZ-T1 and GZ-D1 based DSSCs was estimated according to the relationship:39 and the values are found to be 0.73 and 0.54, respectively. The higher charge collection efficiency value of the GZ-T1-based DSSC compared to the GZ-D1-based DSSC gives an additional explanation of its improved PCE value.
Conclusions
We have synthesized two porphyrin-based dyes, GZ-T1 (triad) and GZ-D1 (dyad), and investigated their optical and electrochemical (both experimental and theoretical) properties. Both of these porphyrin dyes exhibit suitable frontier orbital energy levels for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration, when used as sensitizers for DSSCs. The GZ-T1 and GZ-D1-based DSSCs have been prepared using 20 mM CDCA as coadsorbent and their overall power conversion efficiency values (PCE) are measured to be 5.88% and 4.56%, respectively (under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with TiO2 films of 12 μm). The higher PCE value for the GZ-T1 sensitized solar cell compared to the one with GZ-D1 is attributed to the higher values of Jsc, Voc and FF, as demonstrated by the J–V characteristics, IPCE spectra and dye loading measurements. Moreover, the EIS measurements showed a longer electron lifetime and a shorter electron transport time for the DSSC based on GZ-T1 compared to the one with GZ-D1, consistent with the suppressed electron recombination which leads to higher PCE values.
