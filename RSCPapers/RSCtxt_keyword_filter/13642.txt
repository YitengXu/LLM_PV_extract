    , Accepted 13th May 2021First published on 15th June 2021AbstractA stoichiometrically stable CdS/TiO2 heterostructured electrode was developed via electrodeposition for efficient photoelectrochemical conversion. The stoichiometry of CdS and its homogeneous distribution over TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) is paramount to achieve excellent current conversion efficiency and photo-stability. Herein, we report a stable photocurrent density of 3.5 mA cm−2 for an input power density of 50 mW cm−2 for CdS/TiO2 nanotubes (CdS/TNTs), which is 17 times higher than that of bare TNTs. Further, the photo-stability of the photoanode was studied under the sequence of light ON/OFF conditions to verify their durability. Our results show that the photoelectrochemical activity of the CdS/TiO2 heterostructure achieved the highest H2 production rate of 1.1 ± 0.03 mmol h−1 g−1 for the stoichiometry ratio of 1:1 without any co-catalysts. The significance of CdS/TiO2 stoichiometry towards efficient hydrogen production is presented and discussed in detail.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen is a promising alternative fuel in the near future, and it can be produced from renewable energy resources. In recent years, the solar to hydrogen conversion process has provided an emission-free method of hydrogen production.1,2 The recent technological advancements aspire to produce hydrogen fuel using environmentally friendly techniques to meet the current energy demand in a cost-effective manner.3 Photoelectrochemical hydrogen production is one such promising approach towards hydrogen production from solar energy. Semiconductor nanomaterials are widely investigated due to their durability and offer high energy conversion efficiency at a very low operating voltage.4,5 After the successful demonstration of hydrogen evolution from a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) by Fujishima et al. and Honda et al., increasing interest developed among researchers to use these cells as a next-generation source of fuel for sustainable energy.3,6 TiO2 is commonly used as a stable photoanode for PEC due to its enhanced photocatalytic activity, good photo-stability and non-toxicity.7,8 However, the poor electronic conductivity, low electron mobility and large bandgap of TiO2 limit its usage as a photoanode.9 Recently, various TiO2 nanostructures (nanotubes, nanorods, and nanobelts) have been reported to yield better photocatalytic activity and charge transfer.10–12 Especially, the tubular structure of TiO2 with high surface area is shown to improve the carrier transport properties.13 Similarly, wideband absorption can be achieved by doping appropriate metals and non-metals into the TiO2 lattice.14,15 Further, sensitizing TiO2 with metal-oxide, metal-sulfide, and metal-chalcogenide forms heterojunctions with staggered band alignments. The construction of such semiconductor heterojunctions widens the light absorption region and facilitates the charge separation process.16,17 The in-built electric field at the heterojunction can effectively suppress electron–hole recombination and improve photoconversion efficiency.18 The heterojunction in semiconductors can be formed by depositing narrow bandgap semiconductors such as CdS, CdTe, and Cu2O over TiO2. This heterojunction facilitates the extension of the light absorption region, which further enhances the charge carrier lifetime and improves the stability of the photoanode.19
CdS is an excellent visible light-harvesting semiconductor due to its narrow bandgap. It can be easily sensitized over wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO, Ta2O5, and SnO2.20–23 Sensitizing TiO2 with CdS significantly enhances the photo-electrochemical performance by efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers.24–26 Similar to the morphology of TiO2, the morphology of CdS also plays a crucial role in improving the PEC performance. Zhao et al. synthesized flower-like nanostructures and a mixture of rod and sphere-shaped CdS nanostructures by varying the molar ratio of Cd2+ to S2− from 2:1 to 3:2. In particular, Zhao et al. achieved CdS microspheres at a 1:1 molar ratio which exhibit better PEC performance.27 By systematically varying the S/Cd precursor concentration, Kamble et al. demonstrated that the morphology (sphere and rod-like flaky) and crystal structure of CdS nanoparticles (NP) can be tuned for better PEC performance.28,29 It is important to note here that the hexagonal wurtzite structure of CdS is well known for its stability and enhanced light absorption in comparison to cubic Zinc blend CdS.30,31 In addition, the stoichiometry of CdS nanoparticles deposited over TNTs plays a crucial role in improving the PEC efficiency. Moreover, obtaining spherical CdS NP with sizes of 50–200 nm with stable stoichiometry and hexagonal wurtzite phase is still challenging. Fan et al. reported that the S/Cd ratio decreases as the CdS NP size increases, which affects the PEC performance and light absorption property of CdS NP.32,33 Chemical bath deposition (CBD) and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) are two commonly adopted techniques to deposit CdS NP over various substrates.34,35 However, the dipping process in SILAR and CBD adds loosely bound Cd2+ to the substrate, which interacts easily with S2− precursor to form bulk CdS in the solution. This hinders the growth of CdS NP over the substrate.36 Kongkanand et al. demonstrated higher photoelectric conversion efficiency with smaller CdS NP due to its high electron-injection property. Nevertheless, the smaller particles suffer from poor light absorption compared to large particles.37,38
The shape effect of CdS on TiO2 nanorod arrays reported by Luo et al. suggests that CdS nanorods have an excellent sensitizing effect on TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) while having poor chemical stability and weak interface electron injection efficiency.39 Carrera-Crespo et al. used the pulsed-electrodeposition method followed by thermal oxidation and sulfurization processes to improve the contact properties of CdS NPs on the surface of TNTs.40 Regrettably, the abovementioned methods tend to form agglomerated CdS NP over TiO2. This in turn affects the stability of the photoanodes. Here, we adopted a electrochemical deposition method to fabricate a well-aligned TNT array which is simple, cost-effective and scalable, with the advantage of manipulating the size, stoichiometry, and crystal structure of the nanoparticles.41–43 In this work, we investigated the electrochemical conditions for stable stoichiometry and the controlled size of CdS NPs deposited over TNTs. The surface coverage was optimized with the deposition time. The material properties and PEC performance of the CdS/TiO2 photoanode have been discussed in detail.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Titanium foil (Ti, Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mm thickness, 99.7% purity on the metal basis), titanium-di-oxide (TiO2 P25, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%), cadmium chloride (CdCl2, Sigma-Aldrich 99.99%), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%), sodium sulphide (Na2S, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) were used as received.
2.2 Electrochemical anodization of TNTs
Ti substrate of 2 mm thickness (20 mm × 10 mm) was polished using silicon carbide sheets ranging from 600 to 2000 grids to obtain a mirror-like surface.44 Later, Ti substrate was cleaned ultrasonically in acetone, ethanol, and DI water for 20 minutes each and dried in vacuum. Electrochemical anodization was carried out to fabricate TNT arrays in ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 4 vol% DI water and 5 wt% NH4F at 40 V for 3 hours. After the anodization, the TNTs were cleaned ultrasonically in ethanol and DI water for 5 minutes each, similar to our previous work.42 The as-anodized TNTs were annealed at 450 °C for 3 hours to obtain anatase TiO2 and were used for further experiments.43
2.3 Electrochemical deposition of CdS NPs on TNTs
The electrochemical deposition of CdS NPs on a TNT array was carried out from a solution containing 0.2 M CdCl2 and 0.01 M Na2S2O3. The pH of the electrolyte was maintained at 2.5 by adding aqueous 1 M HCl solution. A bath containing the aqueous solution was maintained at 90 °C. An Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT-302N) was used for the electrodeposition of CdS on TNTs with a cathodic potential of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode. The mechanism for the CdS NP formation is shown in eqn (1). Cd2+ + S2O32− + 2e− = CdS + SO32−(1)In order to obtain the desired CdS NP size, the deposition potential, pH of the electrolyte, deposition time and bath temperature were optimized. This optimized conditions were used for further deposition processes, and samples were prepared by varying the deposition time as 100 seconds, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes. These samples were labelled as 2m-CdS/TNTs, 5m-CdS/TNTs, 10m-CdS/TNTs, 15m-CdS/TNTs, and 20m-CdS/TNTs. The deposition time influences the growth of CdS NPs. Uniform coverage of CdS NPs was obtained for a deposition time of 15 minutes. The as-deposited CdS/TNT samples were annealed at 300 °C for 1 hour under argon atmosphere to obtain a hexagonal crystalline structure. In addition to CdS/TNTs, CdS NPs were coated on commercially available TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles. Finally, the photo-electrochemical activity of bare TNTs and CdS/TNTs were compared with that of CdS/TNPs.
2.4 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CdS/TNTs and CdS/TNPs were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; D8 Advance Davinci, Bruker) equipped with monochromatized Cu K-alpha radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), step 0.02° (2θ). Raman spectroscopy was employed to identify the phase changes in TNTs and CdS/TNTs using a Raman spectrometer (micro RAMAN; LABRAM HR, Horiba). The surface chemical composition of the CdS/TNT thin film was analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PHI versaprobe III). The binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s reference peak at 283.76 eV. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; SIGMA HV, Carl Zeiss) was employed to study the morphologies of TNTs, CdS/TNTs, and CdS/TNPs. The particle sizes of CdS NPs and TNTs were analysed using Image-J software. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were obtained from a Bruker Quantax 200 Detector. High resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM:FEI TITAN 3) was used to obtain the structure and morphology information of the CdS NPs and TNTs. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were utilized to understand the absorption properties of the samples (UV-Vis; UV-2401 PC, Shimadzu). Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE:SP1000-5319) spectra were recorded using a Newport Quantum Efficiency Measurement Unit (USA).
2.5 Electrochemical studies
Mott–Schottky measurements were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT-302N with platinum (Pt) mesh and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrodes. The prepared TNTs, CdS/TNTs, and CdS/TNPs were used as the working electrode.
Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed in a three-electrode system. Both CdS/TNTs and CdS/TNP electrode were used as the working electrode, platinum mesh as a counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. An aqueous solution containing 0.3 M Na2S and 0.2 M Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte. A 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport-Oriel Instruments, USA) solar simulator was calibrated to provide a simulated light intensity of 50 mW cm−2, and the Autolab PGSTAT-302N was utilized to measure the photocurrent at a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1 in an applied potential range between −1.1 V and 0.2 V.
3. Results and discussion
Well-aligned TNT arrays were formed on titanium foil (Ti) by electrochemical anodization. Fig. S1 (ESI†) depicts the top and cross-sectional views of the TNT array. The average inner diameter, wall thickness, and length of TNTs were found to be 94 nm, 20 nm, and 7.6 μm, respectively.
3.1 Structural analysis of TNTs and CdS/TNTs

Fig. 1a represents the XRD patterns of annealed TNTs and CdS/TNTs (15 min). The XRD pattern matches the standard hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure of CdS (ICDD No. 154188) and tetragonal anatase structure of TiO2 (ICDD No. 154603). The peaks located at 25.32°, 37.82°, 48.08°, 54.04°, and 55.24° are indexed to the (011), (004), (020), (015), (121) planes of anatase TiO2. The peaks corresponding to CdS/TNTs are located at 24.7°, 26.57°, 28.2°, 43.7°, and 52.1°, which are indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (110) and (112) planes, respectively.45 Fig. S2 (ESI†) describes the XRD patterns of CdS/TNTs prepared by electrodeposition for 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes and 20 minutes of deposition time. Similarly, the XRD patterns of the CdS-deposited TNPs are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

Further, Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of TNTs and CdS/TNT (15 min), as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The characteristic Raman peaks of anatase TNTs observed at 144 cm−1, 397 cm−1, 517 cm−1, and 635 cm−1 correspond to the B1g, A1g, and Eg modes, respectively. Similarly, the characteristic Raman peaks of CdS/TNTs at 297 cm−1 and 608 cm−1 correspond to the longitudinal optical phonon (1LO) mode and its overtone (2LO) mode of wurtzite hexagonal structured CdS nanoparticles, respectively.46
3.2 X-Ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
XPS analysis was performed to determine the surface chemical composition and oxidation state of CdS/TiO2. XPS survey spectra of CdS/TNTs measured in the range of 1100–100 eV indicate the presence of Ti-2p, O-1s, Cd-3p, Cd-3d, S-2s, S-2p, and C-1s signals, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The high-resolution X-ray photoemission spectrum of the Ti-2p state is shown in Fig. 2a; it exhibits two peaks at 464.4 eV and 458.7 eV, representing the characteristic binding energies of Ti-2p1/2 and Ti-2p3/2, respectively, which confirms the oxidation state of Ti4+ in TiO2.47,48 The O-1s peak shown in Fig. 2b can be deconvoluted into two peaks centred at 531.6 eV and 529.9 eV, which can be attributed to the surface hydroxyl group and lattice oxygen of TiO2, respectively.49,50 The Cd-3d3/2 and Cd-3d5/2 peaks observed at 411.6 eV and 404.82 eV in Fig. 2c correspond to the characteristic peak of the Cd2+ oxidation state of CdS.51 The characteristic binding energy states of S-2p1/2 and S-2p3/2, located at 162.18 eV and 161 eV, respectively, are deconvoluted from the S-2p main peak in Fig. 2d. Therefore, the binding energy peaks of the S-2p states confirm the presence of S2− anions in the CdS/TiO2 thin films.47

3.3 Morphological characterization

3.3.1 FE-SEM analysis. 
CdS nanoparticles (NPs) were electrodeposited over the TNTs under a cathodic potential of 0.6 V. At the initial two minutes of applied potential, a pale greenish-yellow color was observed on the TNT film. After 5 minutes of deposition, the color of the CdS-loaded TNTs changed to yellow. Therefore, as the deposition time increases, the size of the CdS NP gradually increases and covers the surface of the TNTs. The FESEM images of CdS/TNTs deposited for 100 s, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 20 min are given in Fig. 3. At the initial stage of deposition, the CdS NPs were partially filling the TNT inner diameters, as revealed in Fig. 3a–d. It is evident from Fig. 3e that the CdS NPs completely covers the surface of TNTs after 20 min of deposition. Fig. 4 reveals that the CdS NPs size increases linearly with deposition time until it reaches 144 ± 7.5 nm after 15 minutes of deposition. This result indicates that the growth of CdS NPs was initially controlled by the inner diameter of TNTs.

 Fig. 4  Growth and stoichiometric ratio of CdS particles versus deposition time. 
Spatial constraint inside the tubular structure of TiO2 guides the growth of spherical particles inside the tube and results in improved stability of the CdS/TNT nanocomposite.52 No remarkable changes in the color or morphology of CdS/TNTs were observed even after 1 hour of annealing at 300 °C in argon atmosphere, thus presenting excellent thermal stability. However, CdS NPs deposited over TNP tends to agglomerate due to the high surface energy. FESEM images of CdS/TNP are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). From Fig. 4, the stoichiometry and particle size of CdS NPs varied significantly with the deposition time. Interestingly, we achieved a stoichiometric ratio of S/Cd ∼ 1 for the 15m-CdS/TNT sample, as evident from the EDAX spectra (Fig. 3f). Deposition conditions such as time, temperature, pH, voltage and electrolytic composition greatly altered the stoichiometry and morphology of the CdS NPs. However, the higher content of S2− led to uncontrolled growth and aggregates of CdS in 20m-CdS/TNTs, which is not desirable for photo-stability and carrier transfer.27,28


3.3.2 TEM analysis. 
The morphologies and crystal structures of the 10m-CdS/TNT sample were characterized by TEM and HR-TEM. The TEM images of the CdS/TNT samples (Fig. 5a) confirm the presence of CdS NPs over TNTs. Fig. 5b confirms that the single TNT is observed with a mean diameter of about 98 nm. The HRTEM image in Fig. 5c of TNTs shows a lattice fringe spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (011) plane of anatase phase of TNTs. The SAED pattern in the inset depicts a typical anatase tetragonal structure of TNTs. Fig. 5d indicates the HRTEM of CdS NPs with a mean diameter of 105 nm. The CdS NPs deposited on the surface of TNTs have a lattice fringe spacing of 0.354 nm, as per Fig. 5e. Hence, the structure corresponds to hexagonal phase (002) of CdS NPs. The resultant SAED pattern of the CdS NPs shown in the inset reveals the hexagonal phase of CdS. The above results are in good agreement with the XRD pattern.

3.4 Optical characterization
The absorption spectra of the TNTs and CdS/TNTs were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. From Fig. 6a, it can be observed that the TNT absorption band edge is centred at 380 nm, which shows that the TNT array has an intrinsic bandgap in the UV region. The spectra of the CdS/TNT composites were found to absorb photons in the UV-visible region with an absorption band edge at 510 nm, confirming the wide band absorption of photons. The bandgaps of the photoelectrodes were determined with Tauc's formula, and the corresponding plots are presented in Fig. 6(b).53 αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2(2)where α is the absorption coefficient, A is a constant, and n depends on whether the transition is indirect (n = 4) or direct (n = 1). (αhν)2vs. hν was plotted for the TNT and CdS/TNT samples. As shown in (Fig. 6b), the band gaps of TNTs and CdS/TNTs were found to be 3.2 ± 0.04 eV and 2.34 ± 0.02 eV, respectively. The composite nature of the CdS/TNTs was reflected in the bandgap.

3.5 Electrochemical characterization

3.5.1 Mott–Schottky analysis. 
Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis was carried out to understand the charge separation due to the band alignment in the heterostructure semiconductor electrode. The flat-band potential (Vfb) and carrier concentration (nd) in semiconductors can be determined from the Mott–Schottky relation:54 (3) (4)where ε is the dielectric constant, εo is the permittivity of free space for the semiconductor, A is the surface area, e is the electron charge, nd is the charge carrier density, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Using the MS relation (eqn (3)), the graphs of 1/C2vs. V were plotted for TNTs and CdS/TNTs, as shown in Fig. 7a. The flat band potential (Vfb) can be obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the MS plot to 1/C2 = 0, whereas the slope of the MS plot provides the charge carrier density (nd).55 From Fig. 7a, the positive slope of the MS plot confirms that the TNTs and CdS/TNT electrodes are n-type semiconductors. The flat-band potential and carrier concentration values derived from the MS plots for TNTs and CdS/TNTs are listed in Table 1. The higher carrier concentration in CdS/TNTs indicates enhanced mobility of charge carriers compared to the TiO2 NTs.56

The flat band potentials of TNTs and CdS/TNTs were found to be −0.5 V and −0.67 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. Based on the values of the optical bandgap (Fig. 6) and flat band potential (Fig. 7a), a band energy diagram for the CdS/TiO2 nanocomposite electrode was deduced, as shown in Fig. 7b. The conduction band and valence band of CdS are more electro-negative than the corresponding bands of TiO2. This thermodynamic condition favors the migration of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of CdS to that of TiO2. Thus, when CdS/TiO2 electrodes are exposed to simulated sunlight, electron–hole pairs are generated in the conduction band of both CdS and TiO2. Then, the photogenerated electrons in CdS move to the conduction band of TiO2 easily due to the in-built electric field. Further, the photogenerated electrons from CdS and the electrons transferred from CdS to TiO2 migrate to Ti-substrate. On the other hand, holes move to the electrode/electrolyte interface, which leads to the enhanced photo-electrochemical hydrogen generation.


3.5.2 Photocurrent measurement. 
The photocurrent responses of bare TNTs, CdS-deposited TNP, and CdS-deposited TNTs are shown in Fig. 8. The photocurrent density measurements of the samples were recorded using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) from −1.1 V to 0.2 V under intermittent light irradiation. TNT showed a photocurrent onset potential of −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Meanwhile, the CdS/TiO2 nanocomposite exhibited an onset potential of −1 V. A shift in the negative onset potential indicates the presence of a large number of electrons at the CdS/TiO2 heterojunction. From Fig. 8, we observed a steady increase in the photocurrent density with increasing deposition time (100 seconds to 15 minutes). The presence of CdS on the surface of TNTs influences the photocurrent density due to intense absorption of visible light, as shown in Fig. 6a. The highest photocurrent density of 3.5 mA cm−2 was recorded for 15 minutes CdS-deposited TNTs (15m-CdS/TNTs) at a potential of 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photocurrent density of 15m-CdS/TNTs was found to be 17.5 times higher than that of bare TNTs. However, 20 minutes CdS-deposited TNTs (20m-CdS/TNTs) produced less photocurrent density compared to 15m-CdS/TNTs due to the agglomerated CdS nanoparticles. The increased size of the CdS nanoparticles and complete coverage of the TiO2 surface affect the light absorption and promote charge carrier recombination.57 The photocurrent density of CdS/TNP was lower than that of CdS/TNTs and higher than that of bare TNTs. From Fig. S5 (ESI†), the size of CdS NPs deposited over TNPs was four times larger compared to TNTs, which aids increased carrier recombination.

3.5.3 Quantum efficiency measurements. 
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded for the bare TNT, CdS/TNP, 2m-CdS/TNT, 5m-CdS/TNT, 10m-CdS/TNT, 15m-CdS/TNT and 20m-CdS/TNT photoanodes as function of the incident light wavelength. As shown in Fig. 9, the IPCE values of the CdS/TNT photoanodes increase in the order of TNTs < CdS/TNPs < 2m-CdS/TNTs < 5m-CdS/TNTs < 10m-CdS/TNTs < 20m-CdS/TNTs < 15m-CdS/TNTs; this tendency is consistent with the LSV data shown in Fig. 8. Particularly, the 15m-CdS/TNTs reached a peak value of 60% at 450 nm. Heterostructure system CdS/TNTs showed enhanced performance compared to bare TNTs because of efficient charge transfer produced by the built-in potential at the interface of CdS NPs and TNTs.49 In addition, the photoresponse range of the CdS/TNT photoanodes extended to 780 nm due to the intrinsic scattering property of the TNT arrays.58 As a result, the CdS/TNT photoanodes efficiently utilized long-wavelength light in generating a photocurrent.

3.5.4 Photostability studies. 
The photostability of TNTs and the CdS/TNT composite was analysed by measuring the photocurrent response as a function of time at an applied voltage of −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl under illumination for 600 seconds. The photocurrent density was recorded in an “ON/OFF” sequence with a regular time interval of 50 seconds, as shown in Fig. 10a. Upon light illumination, the photocurrent density reached its maximum and rapidly returned to its minimum value when the illumination was OFF, which indicates faster carrier transport in the CdS/TiO2 heterojunction. The photocurrent densities of TNTs, CdS/TNP, 2m-CdS/TNTs, 5m-CdS/TNTs, 10m-CdS/TNTs, 20m-CdS/TNTs and 15m-CdS/TNTs were found to be 0.108 mA cm−2, 0.3 mA cm−2, 0.7 mA cm−2, 1.24 mA cm−2, 1.32 mA cm−2, 1.74 mA cm−2 and 2.57 mA cm−2, respectively. The CdS/TiO2 composite follows the increasing trend of the photocurrent with deposition time. The higher photocurrent density obtained for the CdS/TiO2 composite corresponds to the intense visible light absorption with increasing CdS deposition (from 100 s to 15 minutes), which shows the efficient separation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers at the interface of TiO2 and CdS.

(b) Long time photo-stability measurements of CdS/TNTs under fluorescent light irradiation. 
However, a decrease in photocurrent was observed for 20m-CdS/TNTs due to the agglomerated CdS NP and complete blockade of the TiO2 surface for light absorption, which results in higher recombination between CdS and TiO2.59 The photo-stability of 20m-CdS/TNTs during the light ON/OFF (Fig. 10) sequence exhibits a sluggish photo-response in comparison to 15m-CdS/TNTs, which can be attributed to the poor photo-corrosion resistance of CdS.
Long duration photo-stability measurements were conducted under an 85 watt fluorescent light to determine the degeneration of the photoanode due to photo-corrosion.60Fig. 10b shows the chronoamperometric response of the CdS/TNT samples recorded at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 5 h. It can be observed that the photocurrent density of the 2m, 5m, 10m and 15m CdS/TNT samples increases with deposition time. A constant photocurrent density of the 15m-CdS/TNT sample with significantly less attenuation of 3% from its initial current density demonstrates that the stoichiometric CdS (S/Cd ∼ 1) plays a crucial role in enhancing the photo-stability of the 15m-CdS/TNT photoanode, which results in improved photoelectrochemical activity and charge transfer under light illumination.


3.5.5 Hydrogen evolution. 
The CdS/TNT samples were employed as photoanode materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation at 50 mW cm−2 of light intensity in 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous electrolyte solution. Fig. 11 shows the bar chart of H2 evolution estimated from the CdS/TNT samples. As expected, the bare TNTs exhibited a very low hydrogen production of 0.046 ± 0.003 mmol g−1 h−1. Meanwhile, the hydrogen generation corresponding to 2m-CdS/TNTs, 5m-CdS/TNTs, 10m-CdS/TNTs, 15m-CdS/TNTs and 20m-CdS/TNTs was found to be 0.3 ± 0.01, 0.56 ± 0.01, 0.76 ± 0.02, 1.1 ± 0.03 and 0.546 ± 0.011 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. After electrodeposition of CdS NP over TNTs, the photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation increased with the deposition time. Particularly, the 15m-CdS/TNTs sample showed a maximum output of 1.1 ± 0.03 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 24 times higher than that of bare TNTs. The low H2 generation in the 20m-CdS/TNT sample was due to the full coverage of large CdS NP decorating the TNT surface, which affects the efficient electron transfer from CdS to TNTs and favors carrier recombination.61 Irrespective of the CdS deposition time, we compared CdS/TNTs with CdS/TNP for hydrogen generation application. A lower hydrogen generation of 0.136 ± 0.05 mmol g−1 h−1 was obtained for the CdS/TNP sample due to the electron trapping/scattering at the grain boundaries of TNP.62 We conclude that the nanotubular morphology performs better due to its higher volume filling and charge transport properties.

3.5.6 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals information about the charge transfer mechanism and its kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface.63 EIS measurements conducted for the TNT and CdS/TNT composite samples under an illuminated environment at a small open-circuit voltage with frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz are demonstrated in Fig. 12. The Nyquist plot was fitted with an equivalent Randle circuit to determine the series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance across the electrode–electrolyte interface (Rp), and constant phase element (CPE) of the electrochemical circuit.64 The parameters used in equivalent circuits and their values obtained from NOVA software are shown in Table 2. As can be observed from Fig. 10, the diameter of the arc-shaped Nyquist plots corresponding to TNTs, CdS/TNPs, and CdS/TNTs reduced gradually. The arc radius (Nyquist plot) can be related to the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the photoanode–electrolyte.65 From Table 2, a low Rp value of 15m-CdS/TNTs explains the efficient charge transfer at the photoanode–electrolyte interface, which hinders the charge recombination and influences the surface charge transfer through TNTs. However, the higher Rp obtained for bare TNTs implies poor charge transfer characteristics due to its high recombination loss.66 The Rp value of the CdS/TNP composite lies between those of TNTs and CdS/TNTs. At the same time, the larger size and agglomeration of CdS NP on 20m-CdS/TNTs afforded a low Rp value because of photoelectron-hole recombination.61 Thus, we conclude that 15m-CdS/TNTs exhibits efficient charge separation and transfer across the interface of the electrode/electrolyte, which is consistent with the photocurrent measurement and photo-electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated a stable CdS/TNT nanocomposite photoanode with improved photoelectrochemical performance and photo-stability. The TNTs were prepared by electrochemical anodization, and CdS NP were coated over the surface of the TiO2 NTs using potentiostatic deposition methods. The size and stoichiometry of CdS NP were controlled by adjusting the electrochemical deposition conditions. Enhanced absorption in the visible light region for CdS/TNTs is evidenced from the UV-Vis spectra. The photoelectrochemical measurements of the 15m-CdS/TiO2 NTs showed excellent photo-electrochemical performance, with a hydrogen production rate of 1.1 ± 0.03 mmol−1 g−1 h−1. The significant improvement in the photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation is attributed to the stoichiometry of CdS (Cd/S ∼ 1) and effective formation of the CdS/TiO2 heterojunction. Our results show that CdS electrodeposited on the surface of TNTs is highly photostable, with enhanced photoelectrochemical performance leading to superior PEC for hydrogen production.
