When adopted as a photoanode, an impressive high photocurrent density of ∼25.6 mA cm−2 was demonstrated in a cell configuration using polysulfide S2−/Sn2− as an electrolyte and Cu2S/brass as a counter electrode, which leads to a power conversion efficiency of ∼0.784% for this environmentally benign device. Optical measurements showed that Ag nanoparticles could be employed as plasmon resonance centers to enhance the harvesting efficiency of incident light at the visible and near-infrared range. Moreover, photoluminescence spectra demonstrated fast charge transfer at Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 interfaces, which facilitates direct hot electron injection from sensitizers to the SnO2 matrix and finally gives rise to the high photocurrent density.
1. Introduction
Due to its excellent advantages, such as abundance and non-polluting nature, solar energy is considered as a promising renewable energy source.1 Organic dye or inorganic crystal sensitized solar cells have emerged as third generation solar conversion devices in past decades, and have attracted much research attention.2–4 In order to extend light harvesting efficiency in dye or quantum-dot (QD) sensitized solar cells (SSCs), plasmonic metal nanostructures were usually used as active centers, taking advantage of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) which corresponds to collective oscillation of surface free electrons.5,6 It is indicated that energy stored in the plasmon can be transferred to adjacent semiconductors or dye molecules through plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer (PRET) which is a nonradiative dipole–dipole coupling between the plasmon in the metal and electron–hole pairs in the sensitizers.7,8 Moreover, the plasmonic hot electrons could also be injected into the semiconductor scaffold, penetrating the metal/semiconductor Schottky barrier by direct hot electron injection (DHEI).9,10 This novel plasmon-induced DHEI can be used to explain the enhanced light harvesting performances of metal/semiconductor hetero-materials used in photo-degradation, water splitting, CO2 capture and solar energy conversion.11–14 However, hot electrons in the plasmon quickly relax to a lower energy level on the femtosecond scale and the metals/semiconductors are usually separated by molecular linkers or insulator layers, which leads to a low DHEI efficiency.15 In this regard, direct coating of metal nanocrystals on the semiconductor surface could effectively reduce the barrier energy and minimize charge-carrier recombination at the metal/semiconductor interfaces.
Heretofore, many strategies have been devoted to increasing the photocurrent density of solar conversion devices such as using broadband sensitizers,2,3,16–19 controlling the massive charge recombination,17 employing a highly effective counter electrode for the regeneration of sensitizers and so on.20 In addition, taking advantage of the unique LSPR of metal particles to enhance light harvesting of the devices has been proven as an effective strategy.5,7 Most recently, plasmon based solar cells have emerged as a new type of solar energy conversion device. A solid-state device, using gold and silver nanoparticles on a TiO2 coated substrate as sensitizers that directly inject a photoelectron from the excited metallic nanoparticles to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 film, with Spiro-OMeTAD as an organic hole-conductor, demonstrated sustainable photocurrents under illumination.14 Metallic nanoparticles were also deliberately embedded in the active layer of inverted or flexible organic solar cells, which results in a broad-band absorption improvement and an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE).21,22 Moreover, plasmonic Ag particles with strong far field scattering in the visible and near-infrared regions were also used to increase the photocurrent and PCE of a PbS QDs/ZnO NW bulk-heterojunction device.23 In the past several years, inorganic and hybrid light absorbers such as quantum dots and organometal halide perovskites have received intensive research interest due to their low-cost and potential for a high PCE.24,25 In order to improve the performance, Au@SiO2 was incorporated into organometal halide perovskite solar cells to reduce the exciton binding energy of the sensitizer, which gives rise to enhanced generation of free charge carriers and demonstrates a significant enhancement in the short-circuit photocurrent and average PCE.26
Particularly for dye or quantum dot sensitized solar cells (DSSCs or QDSSCs), embedded metallic nanoparticles could effectively increase the photocurrent by enhancing the light harvesting efficiency of the photoanode.27–30 In addition, charging effects of the metallic nanoparticles could also lead to electron accumulation and negatively shift the Fermi level of the photoanode film, which could systemically increase the photovoltage and PCE.31 However, metallic nanocrystals directly incorporated into photoanode structures are often easily corroded by electrolytes and may serve as recombination centers for photogenerated charge carriers.32 To address this issue, insulating or semiconducting layers like SiO2 or TiO2 were coated on the plasma nanocrystals to improve their stability and to passivate the surface recombination and the thickness of the protecting layer possesses great significance for cell performances.33–35 However, due to fast hydrolysis and condensation reactions of the precursors of the TiO2 and SiO2 coating layers, it is hard to fabricate a homogenous, thin yet dense shell on the active nanocrystals while maintaining a high quality interface.36
In our study, we demonstrated a model solar energy conversion device using Ag QDs as active plasmon centers to achieve high photocurrent enhancement in a liquid junction device. The Ag QDs were loaded on a SnO2 surface by an in situ growth process, which permits a high quality hetero-interface for effective DHEI. Moreover, a layer of Ag2S was decorated to function as both a broad band sensitizer and a barrier layer to prevent backward electron flow from Ag to the S2−/Sn2− electrolyte. Because of the dual roles of the Ag nanoparticles as PRET and DHEI centers, as shown in Scheme 1, a Jsc of ∼25.6 mA cm−2 was demonstrated, which led to a PCE of ∼0.784%. Although a low open circuit voltage (Voc) and filling factor (FF) restrain the PCE at a low level compared to other types of devices, this configuration demonstrates a novel strategy to improve the Jsc in an environmentally benign solar energy conversion device.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of the SnO2 photoanode
0.3 mL hydrochloric acid and 0.3 mmol SnCl2·2H2O were added to 14 mL ethanol mixed with 2 mL deionized H2O under vigorous stirring. Then, the precursor was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. The white precipitate was washed with water and then ethanol. The wet SnO2 product was mixed with a suitable portion of paste to prepare the slurry for the photoanode film via a traditional doctor-blade method. Finally, the SnO2 mesoporous photoanode film was formed after calcination at 550 °C for 30 min in air.
2.2 Preparation of the Ag@Ag2S SSCs
The SnO2 photoanodes were immersed in a 0.02 M SnCl2 aqueous solution for 5 min, and rinsed with distilled water and pure ethanol, then dried at 40 °C for 5 min. Afterwards, the Sn2+ adsorbed photoanode was dipped into a 0.05 M AgNO3 aqueous solution for 2 min and rinsed to finish one cycle of deposition. The photoanodes with different numbers of deposition cycles (n = 2, 4, 6 and 8) were immersed in an aqueous solution containing 2 M Na2S and 2 M S for 5 min. After rinsing, the photoanode was dried at 40 °C for 5 min. For comparison, we also deposited Ag2S QDs using a typical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method as described previously.16
The as-prepared photoelectrode and counter electrode were sandwiched to assemble the cell, and were separated by an adhesive tape spacer (∼60 μm in thickness). Cu2S on brass was used as a counter electrode according to the literature.17 A polysulfide aqueous electrolyte composed of 2 M Na2S and 2 M S in deionized water was injected into the cell via capillarity.
2.3 Material characterization
The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JSM-2100). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX) were performed using a ZEISS Supra-40 scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford instruments X-MAX-20 detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250 instrument, using monochrome Al Kα (300.0 eV) as the excitation source. Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the QDSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter, and the output power density of the xenon lamp solar simulator (Newport) was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). A metal mask with ∼0.16 cm2 window was applied to define the active area of each device. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on a 7-scspec system (Saifan Beijing) with a 1/4 m monochromator. The thickness of the photoanode films was measured on a profilometer (DEKTAK 150, Veeco Instruments Inc.). UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) of the samples were recorded using a UV–vis spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrometer), in which BaSO4 was used as the reflectance standard. The photoluminescence spectra were analyzed on an Edinburgh Photonics FLS980 spectrofluorometer.
3. Results and discussion
SnO2 has a lower conduction band bottom compared to TiO2, which facilitates electron injection from Ag2S sensitizers.18,37 Therefore, considering band alignment for better electron injection, SnO2 was used instead of the commonly used TiO2 photoanode. Fig. 1 depicts X-ray diffraction patterns of the photoanodes. The diffraction peaks belonging to rutile SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445) dominate the curves. For the Ag/SnO2 photoanode, clear diffraction peaks assigned to the (111), (200) and (311) planes of the face centered cubic (fcc) silver (JCPDS no. 65-2871), arising from a background of prime SnO2 peaks, indicate the existence of Ag nanoparticles. After Na2S treatment, a portion of the decorated Ag was converted into Ag2S, thus the (200) diffraction peak belonging to the cubic Ag (200) plane was obviously suppressed.

Fig. 2(a–d) display HRTEM images of pure SnO2 nanoparticles, and Ag coated and Ag@Ag2S coated SnO2 which are scratched from different photoanode films. The clearly defined crystal facets indicate that the SnO2 is well crystallized (Fig. 2a). It can be seen in Fig. 2b that Ag QDs are distributed on the SnO2 particles with diameters of 3–5 nm and some of them display clear lattice fringes (marked with white circles) with a spacing of ∼0.20 nm, indicating the (200) plane of Ag. In the Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 sample after Na2S treatment (Fig. 2c), the QD size shows no obvious growth in diameter, indicating that the as-formed Ag2S layer was very thin. Moreover, as displayed in Fig. 2d, a well-defined hetero-interface can be found between the loaded Ag QD (with a lattice spacing of ∼0.20 nm corresponding to the (200) planes) and the SnO2 (with a lattice spacing of ∼0.33 nm corresponding to the (110) planes), suggesting a good connection between the materials which permits effective electron injection for a high photocurrent density.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the composition and chemical state of the samples. The full-range XPS spectra can be found in Fig. 3a. Binding energy peaks at 137.26, 285.93, 369.6, 486.45 and 529.69 eV, which can be assigned to S 2p, C 1s, Ag 3d, Sn 3d and O 1s, respectively, were detected in the sample. Fig. 3b shows that two main peaks are located at 486.3 eV and 494.7 eV, which correspond to electron states of Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. The Ag 3d and S 2p spectra and fitted peaks are shown in Fig. 3c and d.38 For Ag 3d, the peaks at 367.2 eV and 373.2 eV are assigned to the binding energies of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, of metallic Ag0. The 367.6 eV and 373.6 eV peaks represent the binding energies of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, of Ag+ in Ag2S. The coexistence of Ag0 and Ag+ suggests that the Ag QDs are partially converted into Ag2S. In addition, the chemical state ratio of Ag+/Ag0 is approximately calculated as 1.61, which is higher than the general composition ratio, indicating that the Ag+ species are mainly distributed at the sample surface, considering that the detection depth of XPS is confined to the nanometer scale.39Fig. 3d shows the S 2p result. The 161.6 eV and 162.8 eV peaks are in good agreement with S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, of S2+ in Ag2S data and no single peak belonging to S0 was observed.40 In addition, the overall element distribution in the photoanode structure was also investigated. Fig. 4 shows that a uniform layer with a thickness of ∼8 μm is coated on FTO. EDX analysis of area (1) and area (2) shows similar Ag/Sn ratios of 0.12 and 0.11, indicating that Ag was homogeneously loaded at different film depths.41

UV-vis absorption spectra of the photoanodes are depicted in Fig. 5a and b. For the bare SnO2 photoanode, absorption in the UV region is ascribed to inherent band edge absorption and no obvious absorption could be found in the visible region. As Ag QDs were loaded on the photoanode, the absorbance in the entire visible region was greatly enhanced. Considering that the small size of Ag QDs can hardly induce a scattering effect,42–44 the enhanced absorption in the Ag/SnO2 photoanode mainly results from LSPR absorption of the loaded Ag QDs. After metallic Ag was partially converted into Ag2S, the absorption in the visible range was further improved in the Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 photoanode (Fig. 5a). Moreover, in order to further highlight the difference in the optical absorption of the photoanodes before and after Ag2S deposition, the absorption curves of Ag/SnO2 and Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 were subtracted using that of the SnO2 photoanode as a reference (Fig. 5b) and the corresponding normalized curves are displayed as an inset. After loading with Ag particles, a broad absorption peak centered at ∼440 nm was observed. After Na2S treatment, this peak is shifted to ∼470 nm, which indicates a ∼30 nm redshift. Based on previous experimental findings and theoretical calculations, this redshift is possibly caused by a morphological change in the Ag nanoparticles during sulfidation.45,46 In addition, another absorption peak centered at ∼520 nm was also observed in the Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 photoanode corresponding to Ag2S band absorption, which further confirms the existence of Ag2S on the photoanode.

The inset shows the normalization of the subtracted absorption curves before and after Ag2S deposition. 
Photoluminescence spectra are usually used to evaluate the charge recombination process across hetero-interfaces. The PL spectra of Ag@Ag2S loaded on both SnO2 and SiO2 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 6a. The peaks at 450–500 nm originate from the relaxing of SPR activated electrons in Ag nanoparticles, while the peak centered at ∼520 nm derives from the recombination of photo-activated electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valance band of Ag2S. The reduced PL intensity indicates effective electron injection from Ag@Ag2S to the SnO2 conduction band through the hetero-interfaces.20 Moreover, the PL decay dynamic displayed in Fig. 6b shows that PL kinetics of the Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 photoanode decay faster than that of Ag@Ag2S/SiO2 at both 470 nm and 520 nm irradiation, which indicates effective electron transfer from Ag@Ag2S QDs to SnO2. In addition, for Ag@Ag2S/SnO2, the PL at 470 nm decays much faster than that at 520 nm, and that means it is much easier for the electron to transfer from Ag to SnO2 than Ag2S. As indicated in Scheme 2, except for the direct recombination of the photo-activated electrons from the excited state to the ground state, the injection of photo-electrons paves another pathway for relaxation when SnO2 is used as a scaffold. Based on previous reports, Ag2S possesses ∼0.6 eV CB offset compared to that of SnO2, and that could supply sufficient electron transfer driving force.18 In addition, faster electron transfer at the Ag/SnO2 interface than that of the Ag2S/SnO2 interface could be speculated from a higher thermodynamic driving force from the plasmon state to the CB edge of SnO2.47 The faster electron transfer rate is not solely resulting from the driving force, and other effects may also be involved.48 As stated in previous research, the decay of the plasmon state could directly excite electrons from the metal to a strongly coupled acceptor, which could further accelerate electron transfer at the Ag/SnO2 interface.49 However, the pathway for electron transfer from the Ag@Ag2S to the SiO2 photoanode is disabled due to misalignment of the conduction band of Ag@Ag2S with that of SiO2.14

Fig. 7a displays the I–V characterization for Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 photoanodes with different QD loading cycles (cycles n = 2, 4, 6 and 8). The Ag2S/SnO2 photoanode prepared using SILAR was also used as a reference. Table 1 lists the photovoltaic data of the devices, which indicates that the Jsc, Voc and PCE increased with n. The optimum performance was obtained at n = 6, which gives average Jsc = 25.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 137 mV, FF = 0.23 and PCE of ∼0.784% under 1 sun illumination. Moreover, without the assistance of Ag QDs, the Jsc of the Ag2S/SnO2 SSCs is reduced to 13.3 mA cm−2, which results in a low PCE of ∼0.40%. Fig. 7b displays the IPCE spectra for the Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 cells and the reference Ag2S/SnO2 cell. It is impressive that the IPCE covers the whole spectrum of the visible and near infrared range. Although the IPCE peak of the Ag2S/SnO2 cell could also stretch to the range of 700–1000 nm, an obvious drop was observed at 400–500 nm, which is derived from the absence of Ag QDs. Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 SSCs show an average IPCE value of ∼65%, and a Jsc of ∼25.3 mA cm−2 could be calculated by integrating the IPCE value with the illumination flux, which roughly matches with the I–V test.

Five symmetric cells were tested in each preparation condition to confirm the high photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 8a, with increasing QD coating cycles, a constant growth from ∼5 to ∼25 mA cm−2 is observed in the photocurrent densities of Ag@Ag2S/SnO2. Although the Jsc drops at 8 cycles, the value is still maintained at over ∼20 mA cm−2. Fig. 8b and c reveal that the Voc and FF are stabilized at ∼0.14 V and ∼0.20, respectively, after 4 cycle depositions. The changing tendency of PCE in Fig. 8d is similar to that of Jsc with different coating cycles, which indicates that the PCE is determined by the photocurrent density.

Scheme 3 illustrates the working mechanism of Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 SSCs. Under illumination, electrons in Ag QDs are pumped to the plasmon state as absorbing incident photons (1). Afterwards, the plasmon decays into a hot electron–hole pair within Ag QDs, which enables the following direct hot electron injection into adjacent SnO2 semiconductors (2).49 In addition, LSPR could create an intense electromagnetic field in the immediate vicinity, by which the energy stored in the plasmon could be also transferred to the adjacent Ag2S through dipole–dipole coupling between the plasmon in the metal and the electron–hole pairs in Ag2S (3).7,31 This plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer could excite more ground state electrons to the CB of Ag2S, in spite of the direct band absorption of incident photons (4). The free electrons in the CB of Ag2S are then injected into the CB of SnO2 through band alignment (5) and finally collected at the FTO (6). Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes are stepwise transported across the SnO/Ag2S and Ag2S/electrolyte interfaces to the counter electrode. Based on this working mechanism, the structural advantages of Ag@Ag2S/SnO2 SSCs can be ascribed to three features. Firstly, the Ag@Ag2S hybrid QDs stretch the absorption spectrum to the red and near-infra region, which enhances the light harvesting efficiency of the photoanode. Secondly, the LSPR effect of Ag facilitates the activation of ground state electrons in Ag2S by means of PRET. Thirdly, the DHEI leads to fast electron transfer from Ag to SnO2 at the Ag/SnO2 interface, which substantially enhances the free electron population in the CB of SnO2 and finally leads to a greatly improved Jsc. In spite of the high Jsc, it should be noticed that the devices employing Ag@Ag2S QDs as green sensitizers suffer from many drawbacks. The low Voc and FF of the devices may come from uncontrolled surface recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, which should be further mediated by surface passivating. Nevertheless, the concept of using low toxicity materials to achieve a high photocurrent density in a liquid junction based device could be applied in the design of future solar energy devices.

4. Conclusion
We successfully designed and fabricated model Ag@Ag2S SSCs based on a nanoporous SnO2 photoanode. A high Jsc of ∼25.6 mA cm−2 was demonstrated in these environmentally benign liquid junction SSCs. Based on optical investigations, the high Jsc is attributed to the dual-function of Ag QDs which could serve as plasmon centers to transfer energy to adjacent Ag2S shells by means of plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer, and electron sources to pump hot electrons to the CB of SnO2 through direct hot electron injection. Although this device suffers from low Voc and FF, leading to a low PCE, this concept may be extended to other solar cell systems to substantially increase the Jsc of solar conversion devices.
