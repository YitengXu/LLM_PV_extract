    , Accepted 6th August 2019First published on 13th August 2019AbstractBoron-doped graphene quantum dots (B-GQDs) have been synthesized via a microwave reactor assisted process from bulk boron carbide (B4C) crystals and they are shown to exhibit enhanced photoactivity. The B-GQDs are found to have an average lateral width of ∼6 ± 2 nm, and thickness of ∼0.2–0.3 nm. Nano ZnO is incorporated into these B-GQDs to prepare a B-GQDs-ZnO composite based high-performance photo-anode for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). The results showed the highest power conversion efficiency of ∼3.7% with these new composite based DSSCs, showing the potential of this composite in real cell applications.
Introduction
Size confinement of honeycomb planar graphene structures – called graphene quantum dots (GQDs) – is receiving tremendous attention due to the possibilities of band gap engineering and GQD applications in luminescent devices and conversion devices.1–7 Doped graphene structures are another family of nanostructures receiving attention due to their feasibility in luminescent, spin and electron transport devices.8 Various methods have pursued the synthesis of such QDs and doped structures, though larger quantity (yield), higher luminescent (quantum yield), monodispersed (uniformly sized), easier (single but reproducible) methods for the development of doped GQDs are still lacking.8–10
Various methods have already been demonstrated for the preparation of GQDs such as hydrothermal, electrochemical oxidation, and microwave approaches which break graphene sheets into 0D dots.9–13 GQDs have exceptional advantages of very low cytotoxicity, good solubility, stable photoluminescence (PL) and excellent biocompatibility.14–16 In several such examples, Permatasari et al. developed a hydrothermal method to cut graphene sheets into GQDs exhibiting blue luminescence11 although the yield was about 1%. GQDs were prepared through a microwave assisted hydrothermal (MAH) method by Tang et al.13 The advantage of such a method is the fast and homogeneous heating that leads to uniform particles. In addition, particle size can be easily varied by varying the microwave heating time. The GQDs exhibit deep ultraviolet (DUV) emission at 303 nm, which is reported to be the shortest emission wavelength among all the reported solution-based GQDs.14 Li et al. described a microwave irradiation method where greenish-yellow luminescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were successfully prepared via cleaving graphene oxide under acid conditions without addition of any other reducing agent. The process resulted in a quantum yield (QY) up to 11.7%.17 When the GQDs are subsequently reduced using NaBH4, bright blue luminescent graphene quantum dots were obtained with improved QY ∼ 22.9%.17
Dai and co-workers have observed intrinsic luminescence properties both in the visible and NIR regions from single layer nanographene oxide (NGO) sheets, which are also surface-passivated by polyethene glycol (PEG).18 Later, a one-pot hydrothermal cutting process was reported producing PEG-passivated GQDs in which the GO sheets were reduced to GQDs, and the hydroxyl groups of PEG were coupled to the carboxyl groups of QDs.19 The PL quantum yield of the GQDs–PEG composite is ∼28.0% at an emission wavelength of 360 nm, which is two times higher than that of the GQDs without any surface passivation.
The most promising use of GQDs is in photovoltaic (PV) devices by exploiting the electronic properties and ability of graphene to absorb a high percentage of the incident light. GQD-based PV shows great potential and has been investigated in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). TiO2 nanocrystalline film combined with ruthenium–polypyridine complex dye was the first DSSC device as reported by O’Regan and Gratzel in 1991.20 But conversion efficiency has been limited by energy loss due to recombination between electrons and either the oxidized dye molecules or electron-accepting species in the electrolyte during the charge transport process. In order to understand this issue, DSSC technology based on ZnO has been further explored extensively. ZnO is a well-known wide band gap low-cost semiconductor with a band gap ∼3.2–3.3 eV, and it has higher electron mobility that favours better electron transport.
It also reduces the recombination loss when used in DSSCs and can be successfully used as an alternative to TiO2 in DSSCs.21
The semiconducting photo-anode material in DSSCs mainly consists of either TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, or Nb2O5 as the working electrode, followed by the sensitizer N719 or N3, which is known as commercial dye or CdS, CdSe and PbS based quantum dots. The ions travel via an electrolyte and generally I3−/I− and Co2+/Co3+ are the redox electrolyte and platinum or carbon-coated thin films serve as a counter electrode. The main aim of the DSSC study is to pronounce the effect of light harvesting efficiency via modifying the photoanode.
Furthermore, ZnO nanomaterials can also be used in various applications such as piezoelectric materials, photocatalysts,22 nanogenerators23 and in solar cells.24 The properties of ZnO are dependent on its size, shape and composition. So the designing of ZnO nanostructures with specific size and shape plays a very critical role while developing devices such as solar cells. In the present study, we used nano ZnO scaffolds prepared by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which has already been investigated as a biological template to construct various nanostructures with a specific shape and unique properties.25,26 Moreover, it is also well-known that due to the presence of various binding sites such as negatively charged phosphate groups and aromatic base molecules, DNA can easily interact with positively charged metal ions or metallic nanomaterials with desired morphology.27–29
In this article, we demonstrate the unique formation of boron doped graphene quantum dots (B-GQDs) through uniform cutting of boron doped graphene using a microwave reactor. After that, we incorporated ZnO nanomaterials onto them to make a novel composite, and successfully it functions as a photoelectrode in DSSCs. The DSSC application has been performed taking the B-GQDs-ZnO composite and the possible influence of the B-GQDs on the properties of ZnO for DSSCs has been demonstrated in detail.
Experimental
Reagents and materials
Boron carbide (B4C), polyethylene glycol (PEG-200), Zn(NO3)2, NaOH, and hexachloroplatinic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without any further purification. Distilled water (DI) was used for the entire experiments.
Material characterization
A UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Unico model 4802) with a 1 cm quartz cuvette holder for liquid samples has been used for UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption analysis. The photoluminescence (PL) study was carried out with a Varian (Cary Eclipse Winflr) fluorescence spectrophotometer in both excitation and emission mode using a xenon pump lamp. Raman spectra of the samples were taken using a Renishaw micro Raman spectrometer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out in the 2θ range 10–80° using a Bruker X-ray powder diffractometer having Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The Nexus 670, Centaurms 10× (Microscope) model having spectral range 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a MCT-B detector has been used for Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe ULVAC instrument. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area diffraction (SAED) analyses were performed using a JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was carried out with a Pico SPM-Picoscan 2100 microscope. A surface roughness tester (model number SJ-301) has been used for the measurement of the thickness of the working electrode. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement was carried out using a solar simulator (model number SS80AAA) with the light illumination of 1000 W m−2.
Synthesis of boron doped graphene quantum dots (B-GQDs) from boron carbide
As-purchased boron carbide (2 g) crystals with an average size ∼10 μm were subjected to the heat treatment using a tubular furnace in an inert atmosphere (N2 gas atmosphere) at 1400 °C for 3 hours (h) and then allowed to cool slowly. Then boron carbide (B4C) crystals were converted into black colour char, and crushed in a mortar and pestle to form a powder. Boron-doped graphene was separated from bulk boron carbide crystals using a water-based separation technique by dispersing the powder in water using a strong hair dryer. The detailed procedure is already explained in our previous report.30 A large amount of B4C particles were settled within a few seconds, and a new layer of material was phase separated and remained over the surface of the water even after vigorous shaking. The top part is scooped out from the surface and dried and is called boron doped graphene (BG).
Thus prepared boron doped graphene BG (0.2 g) was mixed with 90 mL of PEG – 200 using a magnetic stirrer for 5 h and then sonicated for 10 h. The mixed solution was transferred into a 40 mL microwave reactor glass tube and heated at 220 °C for 30 min at 900 W and maintaining 150 bar pressure in the microwave reactor (Anton-Paar). After cooling to room temperature, the resultant solution was further dialyzed using a dialysis bag (retained molecular weight 14000 Da) for two days, and the resultant product is B-GQDs which is used for further analysis. Fig. 1 shows the flow chart of the synthesis of B-GQDs from boron carbide graphene.

Synthesis of DNA@ZnO nanostructures
ZnO nanostructures were prepared by the chemical reaction of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and NaOH in the presence of aqueous DNA solution by microwave heating. The concentrations of the reagents used and the detailed synthesis procedure adopted for the preparation of ZnO were reported by Kundu et al. earlier.21 The final solid precipitate of ZnO was dried at room temperature and subsequently annealed for 1 h at 250 °C. The dried mass was used for further characterization and DSSC applications.21
Fabrication of photo-anodes for DSSC application
Synthesized ZnO nanomaterials were mixed with 0.5 mL of polyethylene glycol and 9.5 mL of DI water using a mortar and pestle to prepare a paste. A doctor blade applicator was used to spread the ZnO paste over the conducting FTO substrate having an area of 0.6 × 0.6 cm2 and thickness of ∼12 μm. The thickness and area were controlled by using a cellophane tape and measured by a surface roughness tester. The ZnO coated FTO glass slide was subsequently dried at 80 °C in a hot air oven for 30 min followed by annealing at 400 °C for 60 min. After annealing, the ZnO thin film was immersed in B-GQD solution at 90 °C for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The fabricated FTO films were washed with DI water to remove the excess B-GQDs physically adsorbed on the ZnO films. The film was dried and sensitized by immersing in N719 dye solution and kept for 10 h. The dye-adsorbed ZnO substrate turns maroon in color and the excess non-adsorbed dye was washed with ethanol. Hexachloroplatinic acid solution was used to fabricate the counter electrode via the spin coating technique. Before the coating process, two small holes having size of 1 mm diameter were made over the FTO glass substrate. The Pt-coated thin film was annealed at 400 °C for 30 min. The electrolyte solution was prepared using 0.3 M LiI and 0.03 M of iodine solution in acetonitrile. In order to avoid the drying of electrolyte, the predrilled holes were sealed by double sided tape. The I–V studies were employed to measure the efficiency of the fabricated materials. Fig. 2 shows the schematic representation of the photoanode preparation and working principle of the DSSC.

Results and discussion

Fig. 3a and b show the TEM images of the as-prepared B-GQDs. The synthesized B-GQDs are monodispersed with a uniform diameter of ∼6 ± 2 nm. The crystal lattice spacing between two individual planes of B-GQDs measured from HR-TEM analysis was 0.24 nm (Fig. 3c), which is higher than that of undoped GQDs (0.21 nm).11 The increasing lattice spacing value of B-GQDs confirmed the presence of boron in the GQD lattice. In order to explore the optical properties of the B-GQDs, UV-Vis absorption and excitation dependent PL behaviour were investigated. The B-GQDs show a broad UV-Vis absorption band with a weak shoulder at 267 nm (Fig. 4a). PL study was carried out at wavelength ranges from 300–400 nm. The B-GQD solution was a transparent and clear solution that was pale yellow under daylight. Furthermore, it exhibits blue PL under 365 nm UV light irradiation.

It has been reported in the literature that isolated sp2 hybridized clusters having size of ∼3 nm yield band gaps consistent with blue emission due to the localization of electron–hole pairs.16 This suggests that both the size and surface effects make an important contribution to the observed blue PL emission from B-GQDs. Upon excitation with a 374 nm beam, the PL spectra show a strong peak at 440 nm with Stokes shift of 66 nm. The B-GQDs exhibit an excitation dependent PL behaviour, confirming the presence of the edge states like other carbon nanoparticles (NPs). With the increase in excitation wavelength, the emission peak shifts towards the lower wavelength side and its corresponding intensity also decreases rapidly.

Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra B4C, BG, and B-GQDs. The spectra exhibit two peaks at around 1344 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 corresponding to the well-defined D band and G band, respectively. It is well-known that the G-band is related to the E2g vibration mode of sp2 carbon domains which can be used to explain the degree of graphitization. Furthermore, the D band is associated with the structural defects and particularly disordered structures of sp2 domains. In order to confirm the presence of functional groups and the crystallinity, FTIR and XRD analyses of B-GQDs are undertaken and the results are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). The atomic force microscopic (AFM) image of B-GQDs is shown in Fig. 6(a and b) where the dot-like morphology is shown with an average lateral width of 6 ± 2 nm and thickness of ∼0.2–0.3 nm. The chemical composition of the B-GQDs is studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 7(A). The carbon C1S spectrum of the B-GQDs contains the following features: the peak is centred at 285 eV. The deconvoluted spectra include a peak at 284.4 (for CC), 285.7 eV (for C–OH) and 288 eV (for CO). The B1S spectrum for B-GQDs is shown in Fig. 7(B).

Different deconvoluted peaks corresponding to 188 eV and other boron carbon environments such as B4C (187.4 eV) and B–C (188.4 eV) were also observed. This correlates with the C1S spectrum indicating the presence of different boron–carbon environments in the B-GQDs lattice. The peaks in the C1S spectra are at 284.4 eV (CC) and 286.2 eV (for C–O) and those of B1S at 187.4 eV have appeared from the B-GQD samples. The atomic % of boron in the B-GQDs is found to be 2. Furthermore, the CO (532 and 533.9 eV) and C–O (535 and 537 eV) major peaks were observed in the O1S deconvolution spectrum (Fig. 7D).
SEM and TEM images of ZnO NPs are shown in Fig. 8(a and b) respectively where a flower-like morphology is observed from both images in which the small size ZnO NPs are arranged in a specific way and formed a flower-like morphology. The average diameter of the individual ZnO NPs is ∼30–50 nm.

Over the last few years, significant interest has been paid to nanomaterials for making high performance DSSCs. In general a DSSC cell consists of a porous-structure of oxide film with adsorbed dye molecules and used as a photosensitized anode. The two electrodes are connected via a platinized FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) as a counter electrode and an I−/I3− redox couple containing liquid electrolyte as a conductor to electrically connect the two electrodes. While the electrodes are in working conditions, the dye molecules capture photons, create excitons, and spread over the surface of the oxide film. Now, the electrons enter via the oxide film, and holes are released by the redox couples in the liquid electrolyte. DSSCs have achieved acceptable power conversion efficiency in the past year to challenge silicon solar cells. The power conversion efficiency also depends on the sensitizer, which is due to the efficient injection rate of the exited electron to the conduction band of the semiconducting materials and light harvesting efficiency. The visible part of light absorption using ruthenium dye occurs via metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). Another factor in enhancing efficiency is to protect the dye aggregation on the semiconductor surface, which is possible by optimizing the molecular structure and using co-adsorbant.31 It is important to note that the increase in conversion efficiency after a certain limit has been restricted via energy loss due to recombination between electrons and with the oxidized dye molecules or with the electron-accepting species in the electrolyte solution. Generally, the disorder network structure will reduce the electron mobility, which gave an easy path to recombination of the photo-excited electron.32 The electron hole recombination mainly appeared due to the lack of a depletion layer on the nanomaterials surface. Moreover, it becomes significant when the thickness of the photoelectrode film is increased. ZnO-based solar cell technology has been explored highly to understand this phenomenon. ZnO is a wide-band-gap semiconductor that possesses an energy-band structure and has higher electronic mobility compared to TiO2. All these properties of ZnO favor its fast electron transport with significantly reduced recombination loss while used in DSSCs. There are many reports on ZnO-based DSSCs although the conversion efficiencies are significantly less (∼0.4–5.8%) compared to that of TiO2 (∼11%). Fig. 9 shows the current density vs. voltage characteristics curve with only ZnO and ZnO incorporating various amounts of B-GQDs. From the curve, the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (η) can be calculated.21

The DSSC performance analysis of the ZnO nanostructure based working electrode shows less efficiency compared to the ZnO incorporated B-GQD electrode. It is already known that during the fabrication of a novel DSSC device, the dye sensitization plays a crucial role in achieving good solar conversion efficiency.33 Moreover, the sensitization process for ZnO is very complex due to the dissolution of the ZnO surface caused by the protons from the acidic carboxyl groups. This dissolution may generate the formation of Zn2+/dye complex, which can cause the filter effect that may reduce the conversion efficiency of the DSSC as highlighted before by others.33 Although, as in our study, we used ZnO combined with B-GQDs as an electrode, this dissolution effect might be reduced/nullified due to the presence of B-GQDs which may be one of the reasons for high efficiency in the case of ZnO combined B-GQDs electrode compared to only ZnO electrode.

Fig. 8 indicated by dipping a ZnO coated FTO electrode in B-GQD colution at 90 °C for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. The maximum solar power conversion efficiency is obtained by keeping at 90 °C for 12 h where the amount of B-GQDs in FTO electrode is 2.6 mg. From the results, it is clear that while increasing or decreasing the loading amount of B-GQDs, the power conversion efficiency was varied and only at an optimum concentration, we obtained the highest enhancement of ∼3.7%. The aggregation of dye on the surface of the semiconducting layer can be avoided by using B-GQDs as a co-sensitizer and this is one of the factors for the enhancement of the efficiency. It is important to note that we observed a conversion efficiency of the DNA–ZnO nano-flower photoelectrode alone as ∼2.1%.

Table 1 shows the weight calculation of the DSSC electrode, which reveals how the amount of B-GQDs plays a major role in improving the performance of DSSCs. Fig. 10 shows the plot of power conversion efficiency versus the amount of B-GQDs used.

Table 2 demonstrates the summary of power conversion efficiency obtained by using ZnO nano-structures like nano spikes,34 nano rectangular prisms,35 nano-wires,36 Hedgehog like needles,37 nanotubes,38 nanobelts,39 nano-sheets,40 nano-tetrapods41 and nano-flowers,42 and the power conversion efficiencies vary from 1.2 to 3.37%. By using the B-GQDs-ZnO photoelectrode sample, we can enhance the power conversion efficiency to 3.7%. From the result, it clearly shows the better photo conversion efficiency of B-GQDs, which might be originated due to better dye sensitization and reduced dissolution effect during the sensitization process. So, in the present work we addressed the following major concerns that occur in photoanode materials used for DSSCs by using a nano ZnO with B-GQDs electrode: (i) increasing the amount of dye loading via high specific surface area, (ii) extended optical path length, which has an advantage in harvesting the maximum light source, and (iii) the possibility of fast electron transport properties due to quantum dot based materials used as a co-sensitizer. However, the observed efficiency can be further improved by co-doping other elements into the lattice of B-GQDs, which will be discussed in the near future.

Conclusions
In summary, a simple and useful process for the production of high yield B-GQDs is demonstrated. The presence of the heteroatom doping in QDs is proven along with the fluorescent nature, size and thickness of the QDs, the absorption and PL properties, etc. The DSSC application study has been conducted using these B-GQDs, and the results showed a better power conversion efficiency of 3.7% that can be achieved by using B-GQDs-ZnO composites as a photoelectrode compared to 2.1% obtained by using a DNA-ZnO nano-flower photoelectrode alone. The present studies show that our fabricated B-GQD material can be suitable for making composites with other nanocrystalline materials such as TiO2, SnO2, etc. too for the generation of futuristic high-performance anodes for DSSC applications.
