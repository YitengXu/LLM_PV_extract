    , Accepted 20th February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractIn this work, a perylene bisimide (PBI) based electrolyte PDIN-TEMPO pendent with a stable radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) has been synthesized and used as a cathode interlayer (CIL) in organic solar cells (OSCs). The aligned energy levels of PBI and electron-conducting nature of TEMPO enabled the new CIL to show excellent performance in OSCs, displaying not only high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.48–15.86% and high fill factors (FFs) over 0.80 with the CIL thickness in the range of 5 nm–100 nm, but also high stability and the desired generality to be used in both regular and inverted OSCs. Two controlled conjugated electrolytes by removing TEMPO or PBI units were synthesized and used as a CIL in OSCs, but their FFs were reduced based on thick CILs. Therefore, the synergism of integrated PBI and TEMPO units into one material is critical for the superior performance of PDIN-TEMPO, which was confirmed by its high conductivity and thickness-insensitive electron mobilities in OSCs. This work demonstrates that the TEMPO radical is a promising unit to design semiconducting materials for high performance OSCs.
Introduction
Electricity generation from renewable solar energy is highly pursued to tackle the resultant problems caused by using fossil fuels. Organic solar cells (OSCs), having advantages such as light weight and flexibility, can harvest photons of solar light and convert them into electricity via organic semiconductors.1–5 The last decade has witnessed significant progress of OSCs, in which power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction and tandem OSCs have exceeded 19% and 20%,6–10 respectively. These achievements depend not only on the rational design of conjugated materials with excellent light harvesting capability, optimized charge transport channels and low energy loss,11–23 but also on optimized device structures and novel interlayers to facilitate efficient charge collection.24–32
A cathode interlayer (CIL) between the photoactive layer and the cathode is responsible for electron extraction and hole blocking.33–35 Ideal CIL materials should be able to reduce the work function (WF) of electrodes for the energy level alignment with photoactive layers.36 Besides, high conductivity and electron mobility are necessary to afford thick CILs, which is crucial for R2R manufacture of OSCs. Organic CIL materials, with inherent characteristics such as flexibility and excellent compatibility with the photoactive layer, have attracted a lot of research attention.37–41 Versatile organic groups can be readily integrated for better charge communication with the photoactive layer. In addition, thermal treatment is usually not required for organic CILs. The most successful organic CILs are conjugated electrolytes bearing ionic species within the polymer main-chain or side-chains (Fig. 1a).28,38 However, organic CIL materials that can provide high PCEs for thick films (for instance, up to 100 nm) and accommodate both regular and inverted OSC structures, remain rare to date.

2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) as a stable organic radical molecule has found wide applications in catalysis, magnetism, bioscience, energy storage batteries, optoelectronics, etc.42–45 More importantly, TEMPO-based polymers have been demonstrated to afford non-conjugated electrical conductivity via open-shell site percolation and the electronic communication network (Fig. 1a).46 We envisioned that this special electronic effect of TEMPO may endow it with great potential in improving the charge communication of CIL materials with photoactive layers and guaranteeing high electrical conductivity in thick films. Based on this assumption, herein, we designed a perylene bisimide (PBI) based electrolyte, PDIN-TEMPO (Fig. 1a), pendent with regular TEMPO arms. PBI was selected due to its high electron affinity and a suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level to match with those of the well-developed non-fullerene acceptors.47–49 As a result, PDIN-TEMPO was found to reduce the WF of a silver (Ag) electrode, resulting in excellent energy level alignment. When using PDIN-TEMPO as a CIL, OSCs based on the PM6:L8-BO photoactive layer delivered a high PCE of 18.48% under optimized CIL thickness.16 More importantly, the OSCs can provide an efficiency of 15.86% under a thick CIL up to 100 nm, corresponding to 86% of the optimal PCE (Fig. 1b and Table S1†). To unveil the origin of high OSC performance tolerance to CIL thickness, two structurally related electrolytes, PDIN-Br and TEMPO-Br, were synthesized, but they exhibited inferior CIL thickness-tolerant OSC performance. Further mobility analysis revealed that the electron mobilities of PDIN-TEMPO based devices were independent of the CIL thickness, while those of PDIN-Br and TEMPO-Br based devices were obviously decreased on increasing their thicknesses. Therefore, the excellent thickness-tolerance of PDIN-TEMPO should be attributed to the synergism of PDIN and TEMPO in one material. Furthermore, PDIN-TEMPO could be employed as a CIL for high performing inverted OSCs, providing an efficiency of 17% based on the PM6:L8-BO active layer. The universality of PDIN-TEMPO as a CIL was also verified in other high-performance systems, including PM6:BO-4Cl and PM6:IT-4F.
Results and discussion
Materials preparation and physiochemical properties
A key intermediate of dibromopropane tethering the TEMPO unit through an acetate bridge, DiBr-TEMPO (Fig. 2a), was designed at first. The synthesis of DiBr-TEMPO (5), involving three steps from commercial substrates, is depicted in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† We tried to conduct nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for DiBr-TEMPO, but failed. We inferred that the spin quencher pentafluorophenyl hydrazine may react with bromopropane, leading to complicated reactions and compositions. Therefore, DiBr-TEMPO was characterized by derivatization with 2-phenylpropanal (Fig. S2–S5†).50 Finally, PDIN-TEMPO was obtained by refluxing PDIN and DiBr-TEMPO in trifluoroethanol under N2 (Fig. 2a). The product was purified by dialysis in water (Fig. S6†). Since reaction between a similar diamine and bromoalkyl gave an ionene polymer as reported by Liu et al., we tried to evaluate the molecular weight of PDIN-TEMPO by gel permeation chromatography.51 As a result, the molecular weight (Mn) of PDIN-TEMPO was measured to be 12.46 KDa (Fig. S7†). Thermal analysis indicates that PDIN-TEMPO can be stable up to 160 °C (Fig. S8†).

We further measured the absorption spectra of PDIN-TEMPO. As shown in Fig. 2b, both the solution and thin film of PDIN-TEMPO display an absorption peak at ca. 490 nm, indicating the H-aggregation of PBI units in the solution and thin film.52 Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was then used to detect the spin behavior. As shown in Fig. 2c, the characteristic signal of TEMPO was evidently reduced when incorporated into PDIN-TEMPO, which should be attributed to the electronic communication between TEMPO and PBI. For comparison, PDIN is silent in the EPR spectra. Cyclic voltage measurement was then used to estimate its LUMO level (Fig. 2d), which was calibrated to be −4.1 eV according to the standard redox potential of ferrocene. Furthermore, the WF of PDIN-TEMPO/Ag was probed by using ultraviolet photoelectric spectra (UPS, Fig. 2e). A substantial interfacial dipole of 0.54 eV was observed when depositing PDIN-TEMPO on Ag, indicating the lower LUMO level of PDIN-TEMPO.
Photovoltaic performance
The application of PDIN-TEMPO as a CIL was initially evaluated in PM6:L8-BO based regular OSCs, which were optimized with a range of CIL thicknesses.16 The device structure, current–voltage (J–V) curves and corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) are shown in Fig. 3. Detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 1. As a result, the OSCs provided an optimal PCE up to 18.48% with a 10 nm CIL, and the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are 0.892 V, 25.57 mA cm−2 and 0.81, respectively. The integrated current from EQE is 24.43 mA cm−2, with a small deviation of less than 5%. More importantly, the PM6:L8-BO based OSCs can display high PCEs among broad CIL thicknesses ranging from 5 nm to 100 nm. Remarkably, PCEs can be observed at over 18% for CILs ranging from 5nm to 20nm in thickness, while 17% to 18% can be observed for CILs from 40 nm to 80 nm in thickness. When the thickness of the PDIN-TEMPO CIL was increased to 100 nm, a PCE of 15.86% was obtained, representing 86% of the highest value. As shown in Fig. 3d, there is no significant degradation for both Vocs and FFs along the increment of CIL thicknesses, in which FFs, especially, could be impressively maintained at 0.80 with 100 nm CIL thickness (Table 1). The slightly decreased PCE of devices with a 100 nm CIL should be mainly ascribed to the lower Jsc.

To elucidate the thickness-insensitive FFs of PDIN-TEMPO as a CIL in OSCs, we further synthesized PDIN-Br (Fig. 4a) and TEMPO-Br (Fig. 4c), removing TEMPO and PBI segments (Fig. S9–S18†), respectively. Their application as a CIL in PM6:L8-BO based OSCs was also optimized thoroughly. However, both displayed inferior device performance. For example, PDIN-Br could only provide high PCEs over 18% with a thin CIL of 5 nm. Although the PCE can be retained at 15.13% with a 40 nm CIL, corresponding to over 83% of the highest PCE, it sharply decreases to 10.60% for a 100 nm CIL. As shown in Fig. 4b, all Jscs, Vocs and FFs exhibit significant decrement when the CIL thickness increased from 5 nm to 100 nm. For comparison, an optimized PCE of 14.52% was just obtained by using TEMPO-Br as the CIL, which was reduced to 5.82% when TEMPO-Br was used in a 20 nm CIL (Fig. 4d). Therefore, the excellent thickness-tolerant properties of PDIN-TEMPO should be a result of the synergism of PDIN and TEMPO in one integrated structure. To note, both PDIN-TEMPO and PDIN-Br based OSCs with considerable PCEs display good storage and photo stability. As shown in Fig. 4e, after storage in a N2 filled glove box for 720 h, over 90% of the original PCE could be maintained. The photo stability is shown in Fig. S19,† where over 85% of the start PCEs can be reserved after continuous light illumination for 400 min. These clearly suggest that the radical TEMPO is stable towards both the metal electrode and conjugated organic semiconductors in photoactive layers.

Thickness dependent electron mobilities, resistance and microstructures of CIL films
The space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were further conducted to explore the CIL thickness-dependent electron mobilities, μes (Table 1, Fig. S20–S22†), which can be used to evaluate charge transport in OSCs.53 For all PDIN-TEMPO, PDIN-Br and TEMPO-Br, electron-only devices were fabricated with the ITO/ZnO/PM6:L8-BO/CILs/Ag structure. Consequently, PDIN-TEMPO based devices display comparable μes of 5.5–1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the CIL thicknesses within 5 nm to 80 nm (Fig. S20†) that slightly decrease to 8.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which can ensure efficient charge transport even through a thick PDIN-TEMPO CIL. However, for PDIN-Br based devices (Fig. S21†), although the μes are up to 2.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with 5 nm to 20 nm CILs, they gradually decrease to 1.4 × 10−4 to 8.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the CIL thicknesses are 40 nm to 80 nm and further lowered to 8.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a 100 nm CIL. The reduced μe will directly constrain the charge extraction and transport, leading to sharply decreased PCEs. For comparison, TEMPO-Br based devices show low μes below 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S22†), which is consistent with the moderate device performance. The conductivity (σ) was also measured by using an ITO/CIL films/Ag structure and the corresponding J–V curves in the dark are displayed in Fig. 4f. As a result, comparable high σ values of 4.4 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 4.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 could be obtained for PDIN-TEMPO and PDIN-Br, and a much lower σ of 1.0 × 10−10 S cm−1 for TEMPO-Br. To evaluate the charge extraction resistance through different CILs, we further carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) by applying a bias voltage close to Voc. Fig. 4g and h show the Nyquist plots of cells with varied PDIN-TEMPO and PDIN-Br thicknesses, respectively. Obviously, when the OSCs were fabricated by using PDIN-TEMPO of 5–100 nm thickness, comparable resistance can be observed (Fig. 4g), indicating similar charge extraction efficiency though different thick PDIN-TEMPO films. However, for PDIN-Br, the resistance was observed to greatly increase when the film thickness rises from 5 nm to 100 nm (Fig. 4h). This corresponds to reduced charge extraction efficiency for a thick PDIN-Br film, which can result in a decreased Jsc and FF.
Grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was further used to investigate the microstructure in films (Fig. S23†). Both PDIN-TEMPO and PDIN-Br films display obvious diffraction peaks, indicating good crystallinity, while TEMPO-Br shows a more amorphous film. For the PDIN-TEMPO film, there are dominant peaks at q = 1.833 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction and 0.612 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The former corresponds to a distance of 3.43 Å, which should be assigned to the π–π stacking of PBI. The latter points to a d-spacing of 10.2 Å, which may be originated from the lamellar distances supported by TEMPO arms. These results indicate the edge-on orientation of PDIN-TEMPO in the film. For comparison, PDIN-Br is not so regular in the film, and two or three main peaks can be identified in the IP or OOP direction, respectively. In the IP direction, the peaks at 1.544 Å−1 and 1.817 Å−1 correspond to a d-spacing of 4.06 Å and 3.45 Å, respectively, implying that there are multiple stacking modes for PBI. While in the OOP direction, peaks at 1.555 Å−1, 0.998 Å−1 and 0.513 Å−1 point to a d-spacing of 4.04 Å, 6.29 Å and 12.2 Å, which should be assigned to π–π and lamellar packing. Therefore, it can be inferred that there are both edge-on and face-on orientations for PDIN-Br in the film. Although these CILs exhibit distinct crystallinity, it is hard to correlate the GIWAXS results with the photovoltaic performance, since for thin films GIWAXS can only provide information regarding crystallinity and there is an absence of information regarding the amorphous region. Therefore, the mechanism in enhanced conductivity of PDIN-TEMPO and the electron transport via TEMPO required further studies, such as via dynamic simulations. Besides, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was measured and comparable low roughness was observed for all CIL films on the active layer (Fig. S24†).
Inverted devices and other photoactive layer based OSCs
The generality of PDIN-TEMPO as a CIL was then evaluated from different aspects. Since most CIL materials have been applied in either conventional or inverted OSCs, we wondered if PDIN-TEMPO could also be used to fabricate inverted devices. Inspiringly, the devices of ITO/PDIN-TEMPO/PM6:L8-BO/MoO3/Ag provided a high PCE of 17.07% (Fig. 5a), indicating that PDIN-TEMPO can accommodate well both regular and inverted OSCs. Moreover, the performance of PDIN-TEMPO based OSCs using other high performing non-fullerene acceptors, for instance BO-4Cl and IT-4F (Fig. S25, S26 and Table S2, S3†), was investigated. Consequently, high optimal PCEs of 17.76% and 13.81% were achieved (Fig. 5b), respectively. Therefore, PDIN-TEMPO could be confirmed as a universal CIL material.

Conclusions
To conclude, we reported a PBI-based electrolyte type CIL material hanged with radical TEMPO side units. The obtained PDIN-TEMPO could be used as an efficient CIL in high performing non-fullerene OSCs, exhibiting thickness-insensitive FFs. An optimal PCE of 18.48% was realized with a 10 nm CIL in PM6:L8-BO based regular OSCs. By optimizing the CIL thickness, high PCEs over 18% could be obtained under 5–20 nm CILs, and 17–18% under 40–80 nm CILs, and 15.86% under a 100 nm CIL, in which high FFs over 0.80 could be maintained. Two structure-related PDIN-Br and TEMPO-Br were synthesized, and their application as CILs exhibited either thickness-dependent FFs or low efficiency, suggesting that the synergism of integrated PDIN and TEMPO segments is crucial for the resultant performance. Electron mobility analysis indicates that while the μes of PDIN-Br and TEMPO-Br based devices gradually decrease, there is no considerable difference in those based on PDIN-TEMPO when the thicknesses are increased, which can guarantee efficient charge extraction and transport in OSCs with PDIN-TEMPO as the CIL. Therefore, the incorporation of a TEMPO unit into a conjugated electrolyte will create new conjugated materials and act as excellent CILs for OSCs. What's more, in-depth studies about the effect of the radicals on material properties are being conducted in our lab.
