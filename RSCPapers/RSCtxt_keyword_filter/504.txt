    , Accepted 29th March 2021First published on 30th March 2021AbstractInorganic p-type semiconductors have broadly served as hole transport materials (HTLs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in recent years. Among them, NiCo2O4 with its excellent conductivity and hole mobility is the emerging candidate for HTLs and is attracting increasing attention. Here, we employ a simple hydrothermal method to fabricate high-quality mesoporous NiCo2O4 films as HTLs of PSCs. The study finds that the morphology of NiCo2O4 can be regulated from nanosheets (NSs) to nanowires (NWs) as the hydrothermal reaction time increases, and the morphology of NiCo2O4 significantly affects the device performance. Specially, the device with NWs achieves a best efficiency of 11.58%, ascribed to the fact that such a one dimension material could provide a straight path for hole extraction/transport. And benefiting from the mesoporous structures of NiCo2O4 films, all the devices exhibited a very repeatable and desirable long-term stability. Overall, this work develops alternative NiCo2O4 nanostructure-based HTLs and opens up new opportunities in fabricating PSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, multitudinous research interests have been attracted to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs up to an unprecedented 25.5%.1,2 This is mainly due to the incomparable photophysical properties of perovskite materials, such as high light extinction, desirable carrier mobility and long charge carrier lifetime.3–6 In addition to the perovskite active layers, hole transport layer (HTL) is also a critical factor for achieving highly efficient PSCs, which could facilitate hole extraction/transportation and suppress interfacial charge recombination.7–9 Up to now, various p-type semiconductor materials have been used as hole transport layers. The most widely used materials are the organic materials PEDOT:PSS and spiro-OMeTAD, and the inorganic material NiO.10,11 Compared with organic materials, inorganic materials have the advantages of low cost, facile preparation and chemical stability.12 In addition to NiO, ternary metal oxides with tunable optical and electrical properties prepared by a solution-process have been studied as HTLs more and more extensively.12,13 For example, NiCo2O4,14 ZnCo2O4,15 CuCrO216 and so on have been used as HTLs in PSCs, showing a promising performance. Among them, NiCo2O4, as an emerging hole transport material, is attracting increasing attention due to its intrinsic higher conductivity and mobility. Of late, NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) have been successfully applied to PSCs as HTLs. For example, Choy and co-workers firstly proposed a controllable deamination strategy to synthesize NiCo2O4 nanoparticles as HTLs.14 Besides, Choulis et al. chose a combustion method with tartaric acid as a fuel to synthesize NiCo2O4 NPs to construct PSCs.17 Jung et al. demonstrated that NiCo2O4 NPs synthesized by a sol–gel driven method could be efficient HTLs for PSCs.18
Despite these promising efforts, some challenges to the development of NiCo2O4 HTLs still remain. As reported, the films formed by NiCo2O4 NPs are easily agglomerated and have a poor stability, as well as forming defects on film surfaces and interfaces, which is mainly because nanoparticles possess a large specific surface area.19 The poor quality of NiCo2O4 films is not conducive to the stable preparation of PSCs devices. Therefore, the stable fabrication of high-quality NiCo2O4 films is critical for PSCs. In addition, to form films by NiCo2O4 NPs, mesoporous structures of NiCo2O4, such as one-dimensional (1D) nanowires (NWs) and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets (NSs), are a nice choice to achieve high-quality films. As reported, there are many merits due to a distinctive mesoscopic-structure. Generally, mesoscopic-structure charge transport layers are effective for perovskite filling and preventing moisture erosion, and thus improve environment stability, as well as for larger charge separation areas at the interfaces between charge transport layers and the perovskite layer, which benefits charge extraction.20–24 However, as far as we know, mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanostructures as HTLs in PSCs have never been reported.
Herein, we develop high-quality NiCo2O4 mesoporous films with a tunable morphology as HTLs via a facile hydrothermal strategy. The results indicate that the morphology of NiCo2O4 can be evolved from nanosheets to nanosheet-nanowires and nanowires by controlling the reaction time. And the relationships between the NiCo2O4 morphology and device performance were investigated. The study finds that NiCo2O4 NWs have a more excellent conductivity and hole mobility, which are beneficial to charge extraction, transference and suppression of the interfacial recombination. As a result, the PSCs based on mesoporous NiCo2O4 NWs exhibit a champion efficiency of 11.58%. This work develops a facile method for the synthesis of mesoporous NiCo2O4 films and provides an insight for using NiCo2O4 as HTLs in PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
FTO glasses were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PC61BM), Spiro-OMeTAD, CH3NH3I (MAI) and PbI2, were all purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Other materials were supplied by Aladdin.
2.2 Preparation of NiCo2O4 films
The precursor solution, including Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.291 g), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2 mmol, 0.582 g), urea (15 mmol, 0.901 g) and 30 ml deionized water, was stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for 30 min. The clear and homogeneous precursor solution was then transferred to a 50 ml PTFE reactor. The FTO glasses were ultrasonically rinsed with the ethanol, acetone and de-ionized water in order for 15 min. Subsequently, well-cleaned FTO glasses were immersed into the PTFE reactor. The reaction temperature was set at 90 °C, and the times were set at 90 min, 120 min and 150 min. After the reactions, the reactor was naturally cooled to room temperature. The samples were taken out, cleaned with ethanol and de-ionized water three times and then dried at 60 °C for 2 h in a vacuum drying oven. Finally, the samples were annealed at 350 °C in N2 conditions for 2 h.
2.3 Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
First, the precursor solution of perovskite was prepared by the following steps: CH3NH3I (159 mg) and PbI2 (461 mg) with a molar ratio of 1:1 was dissolved into DMF (600 mg) and DMSO (78 mg). The mixed solution was stirred at 60 °C and 300 rpm for 30 min, and ready for use. To fabricate the perovskite films, the mixed solution was spin-coated onto the NiCo2O4 films with a parameter of 2000 rpm for 10 s and of 4000 rpm for 25 s under ambient air with a relative humidity of ∼40%. And 250 μL of ethyl acetate anti-solvent was quickly dropped on the center of the substrate during the last 15 s, and then the substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. Next, the PC61BM chlorobenzene solution at 20 mg ml−1 was spin-coated on the perovskite layer followed by an annealing process at 80 °C for 1 h. The Ag electrode was deposited by thermally evaporating under a vacuum environment. Finally, the integral PSCs with an FTO/NiCo2O4/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Ag structure were fabricated and the effective device area was 0.06 cm2.
2.4 Characterization and measurement
The top-view and cross-section morphology of NiCo2O4 and the perovskite films were observed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Ultra 55, Zeiss, Germany). The crystallinity and crystal structures of NiCo2O4 and perovskite the films were measured by the X-ray diffraction (XRD, Thermo ARL-X'TRA, USA) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM 2100, Japan), respectively. The element information of the NiCo2O4 NWs was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha, USA). The energy band information was characterized by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI). The optical transmittance of the NiCo2O4 films and UV-vis absorbance spectra of the perovskite films were measured by an UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV1102II6812011, China). Under a 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight illumination, we used a source meter (Keithley model 2400-SCS, USA) to obtain information on the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs. A 500 W Xe lamp (Trusttech, China) and an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel) made up the solar simulator. The steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured by a transient fluorescence spectrometer (FluoTime 300, Germany). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in a dark environment by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 600E, China) at a 5 mV AC amplitude and frequency scanning range of 0.01–100 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
Here, the mesoporous NiCo2O4 films were developed via a facile hydrothermal method, and their morphology could be regulated by different hydrothermal times. Fig. 1a shows the evolution diagram of the NiCo2O4 morphology as the reaction time increased from 90 to 120 and 150 min, and the morphology evolved from nanosheets (NSs) to nanosheet-nanowires (NS-NWs) and nanowires (NWs). The scanning electron micrographs (SEM) images of the NiCo2O4 morphologies are, respectively, detailed in Fig. 1b–g. Obviously, the hydrothermal reaction time plays an important role in controlling the NiCo2O4 morphology. In Fig. 1b, the SEM image demonstrates that the NiCo2O4 thin nanosheet arrays uniformly cover the FTO/glass substrate in a vertically direction. For the hydrothermal reaction time extended to 120 min, the nanowires appear and grow sharply. The nanosheets and the free space of the network composed of nanosheets are covered by the nanowires (Fig. 1c). Finally, as the time is furthered extended to 150 min, nanosheets are completely covered by nanowires, as shown in Fig. 1d. The evolution of the morphology is attributed to the nanosheets growing quickly in the early stage and, as time increases, the nanosheets grow slowly while the nanowires grow faster.25,26 The SEM images of the cross-section morphology shown in Fig. 1e–g indicate consistent results for the NiCo2O4 surface morphology. And the average thickness of NiCo2O4 increases from 200 to 250 and 300 nm approximately as the morphology evolutes from NSs to NS-NWs and NWs.

The crystallinity of NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs, and NWs were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. S1† displays that NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs, and NWs have the same diffraction peaks and these diffraction peaks confirm the spinel structure, which is in accordance with the standard JCPDF card (JCPDF: 20-0781).27 It is worth noting that no other additional diffraction peak introduced by an impurity phase is observed, indicating a high purity of the synthesized NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs, and NWs. The above results indicate that the NiCo2O4 of the NSs, NS-NWs and NWs corresponds to a cubic spinel structure. In order to further obtain the structure and composition of NiCo2O4, we chose NiCo2O4 NWs for further characterization. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of NiCo2O4 NWs are displayed in Fig. S2.† As presented in Fig. S2a,† the lattice spacing of NiCo2O4 NWs is 0.47 nm, matching the (111) crystal planes of the spinel NiCo2O4 phase.28 The SEAD patterns of NiCo2O4 NWs in Fig. S2b† show a series of Debye-Scherrer diffraction rings indexed to crystal planes of the spinel NiCo2O4 phase, which is consistent with the XRD result. The element information of the NWs was measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. S3a† is a full spectrum of the NiCo2O4 NWs. The spectra of Ni2p and Co2p (Fig. S3b and S3c†) contain a couple of spin–orbit peaks, corresponding to Ni2+, Ni3+ and Co2+, Co3+, respectively. The Ni2+ peaks are indexed to 855.8 and 873.2 eV, and the Ni3+ peaks are assigned to 853.9 and 871.1 eV, respectively. The Co2+ peaks are indexed to 796.6 eV and 781.3 eV, and the Co3+ peaks locate at 794.7 and 779.6 eV. As shown in Fig. S3d,† the fitting peaks of O1 (529.5 eV), O2 (530.5 eV) and O3 (531.7 eV), respectively, represent a metal–oxygen bond, defects, and the multiplicity of physical and chemisorbed water at/within the surface.29,30 Therefore, the XPS results are consistent with the literature and confirm the formation of cubic spinel NiCo2O4.31 Besides, the energy level of NiCo2O4 NWs was studied by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy. The bandgap of NiCo2O4 NWs and the bandgap alignment of the PSCs are provided in Fig. S4.† The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of the NWs are −4.79 eV and −2.74 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the literature.14,17 A proper energy alignment of the NWs can effectively transport holes and block the injection of electrons. Therefore, NiCo2O4 is a promising candidate as HTLs in PSCs.
To understand the effects of NiCo2O4 morphology on the performance of PSCs, the PSCs with structure of FTO/NiCo2O4 (NSs, NS-NWs and NWs)/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Ag were fabricated and investigated. Fig. 2a depicts current–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on mesoporous NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs and NWs as HTLs. Table 1 lists the corresponding device photovoltaic parameters. Apparently, the NW device exhibits a champion PCE of 11.58% with a Jsc of 18.13 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.97 V and FF of 65.87%, which is superior to the devices based on NSs and NS-NWs with a PCE of 9.52 and 10.11%, Jsc of 18.80 and 18.34% mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 and 0.94 V, FF of 55.04 and 58.62%. Besides, the hysteresis of the J–V curves of NS, NS-NW and NW devices scanned under a reverse and forward direction were measured (Fig. S5†), and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The hysteresis factor of the NW device is 6.56%, and is lower than the NS (13.97%) and NS-NW (9.79%) devises, suggesting a suppressed hysteresis. Moreover, Fig. 2b shows the efficiency distribution of 20 devices based on NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs and NWs, indicating that NW devices possess a superior performance. Obviously, the device based on NWs achieves the best performance, which is mainly ascribed to the increased Voc and FF. Nevertheless, as the morphology evolved from NSs to NWs, the Jsc showed a gradually decreased trend. In order to understand the phenomenon of a gradually decreased Jsc, optical transmittance spectra of the NiCo2O4 NS, NS-NW and NW films were investigated. As shown in Fig. S6a,† we can find out that, compared with bare FTO/glass substrate, the transparencies of NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs and NWs grown on the FTO/glass substrate exhibit a gradual decreasing trend, which directly leads to a less luminous flux reaching the perovskite layer.17 We attribute the reduced transmittance to the increased thickness as the NiCo2O4 evolved from the NSs to NWs, as displayed in Fig. 1e–g. For further study, the difference of Jsc, the quality of perovskite films, was also evaluated. The morphology and structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films deposited onto the various NiCo2O4 films are provided in Fig. 3. As presented in Fig. 3a–c, all three perovskite films exhibit a dense, free-pinhole and smooth morphology. And the corresponding perovskite grain size distribution is presented in Fig. S7.† The average sizes for the NSs, NS-NWs and NWs are 279, 291 and 304 nm, respectively. XRD patterns of the perovskite films (Fig. 3d) deposited on NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs and NWs display similar diffraction peaks, including diffraction peaks size and intensity. The light absorbance of perovskite films, which affects the magnitude of output current, is shown in Fig. S6b.†32 The light absorbance of perovskite films based on NiCo2O4 NWs is lower than those of the NSs and NS-NWs, which indicates that the slight increase of grain size of the perovskite cannot compensate for the loss of transmittance of the HTLs. According to the above results, it can be known that the decreased Jsc is mainly attributed to the lower optical transmittance of the NiCo2O4 NW films and its adverse effect on the absorbance of the perovskite.

The increased Voc and FF are mainly due to the unique 1D structure of the NWs for an efficient charge extraction and transport as well as a reduced interfacial carrier recombination. It is well known that the 1D NW structure not only provides a straightforward pathway for charge transport but also forms a better interface contact with the perovskite layer for an efficient charge extraction and reduced interface recombination.33–36 Therefore, for NiCo2O4 NW devices, efficient hole extraction, fast hole transport and lower interface recombination are conducive to an improved Voc and FF. In order to confirm the assumptions, firstly, the conductivity and hole mobility of the NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs, and NWs were investigated. We employed I–V measurements to obtain the conductivity of NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs and NWs with a schematic device structure of FTO/NiCo2O4/Ag as displayed the embedded image of Fig. 4a.37 The conductivities of the NSs, NS-NWs and NWs are 1.88 × 10−4 S cm−1, 3.06 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 4.99 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. Further, the hole mobilities of NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs, and NWs were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the hole-only device structure of FTO/NiCo2O4/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag.38 The fitting curves are displayed in Fig. 4b, and the calculated value of the hole mobilities of the NSs, NS-NWs, and NWs are 0.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, the NW structure achieves the best conductivity and mobility. As is known to all, the higher conductivity and hole mobility could accelerate the charge extraction and hole transportation. To further understand the enhancement of the PSC performance, we characterized the relation between the light intensity (0.1 sun to 1 sun) and Voc. The relationship between the light intensity and Voc was fitted by the equation:39Voc = nkTln(I)/q, where I is the light intensity, n is the ideal factor, T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge and Voc is the open-voltage. Aa shown in Fig. 5a, it can be seen that the NW device possesses a lower slope of 1.39 kT/q, implying that the NW device has a lower trap-assisted recombination.40 Moreover, the hole-trapping state density (ntrap) was also assessed by SCLC. The trap-state density (ntrap) was computed by the equation:41,42 (1)where ε is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap-filling limit voltage, e is the electron charge and L is the thickness of perovskite films. Obviously, the ntrap value is linear with VTFL because the other parameters are the same. So, a lower VTFL is connected with a lower concentration of trap-state density.43 As displayed in Fig. S6c,† the VTFL value of NiCo2O4 NWs (0.88 V) is smaller than those of the NSs (1.04 V) and NS-NWs (0.96 V), implying NW devices possess a lower defect density and trap recombination, which increases the Voc and FF of the devices.

Then, we investigated the hole extraction and transport kinetics in depth by steady photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. From Fig. 5b, the PL quenching of perovskite films on NiCo2O4 NWs is more efficient than that on NiCo2O4 NSs and NiCo2O4 NS-NWs, demonstrating that NWs can be effective for hole extraction. Moreover, Fig. 5c shows the TRPL spectrum and the TRPL decay curves. The decay curves are fitted by the biexponential function:44 (2)
The average decay lifetime can be calculated by the equation: , and more detailed parameters are listed in Table S2.† The τavg values are reduced from 64.57 ns, to 46.53 ns to 36.36 ns, respectively, for devices based on NiCo2O4 NSs, NS-NWs and NWs, which indicates that the transfer of holes from the perovskite to NWs is faster. Therefore, the NWs have a more effective hole extraction and transfer, which is conducive to achieving higher Voc and FF.45 Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to reveal the interface charge transfer kinetics. Fig. 5d shows the original curves and the fitted curves of the Nyquist-plot of the NiCo2O4 NS, NS-NW and NW devices. The equivalent circuit model fitting the Nyquist-plot and a locally enlarged image is in the inset of Fig. 5d. Table S3† gives detailed information about the recombination resistance (Rct) and internal series resistance (Rs). It is well known that the Rct corresponds to the charge transfer at FTO/NiCo2O4/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Ag interfaces and the recombination resistance.46 The Rct of the NW device is larger than those of the devices NSs and NS-NWs, suggesting that electron–hole recombination is suppressed, benefiting the transfer of holes, which is consistent with the TRPL result.46,47 From the above analysis, it can be understood that NiCo2O4 NWs possess a higher intrinsic conductivity and hole mobility benefiting charger extraction and transport, and a better contact with the perovskite layer, leading to a lower charge recombination and lower trap density. Hence, the photovoltaic performances of NiCo2O4 NW devices are superior to those of the devices based on NSs and NS-NWs.
Additionally, the air-stability of the corresponding device was also studied. The devices were stored in an environment with a relative humidity at 40 ± 5% without encapsulation. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that all the PSC devices maintain over 80% of the initial PCE after 10 days. The remarkable device stability is due to the NiCo2O4 mesoporous structures which can effectively resist moisture erosion of the perovskite films and improve the device stability.48

4. Conclusion
In summary, we here proposed a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize mesoporous NiCo2O4 with NSs, NS-NWs and NWs, and then the effect of the various NiCo2O4 nanostructure HTLs on the performance of PSCs was discussed. The PCE of the PSCs gradually increased as the NiCo2O4 morphology evolves from NSs to NS-NWs and NWs. In detail, the PSCs based on NiCo2O4 NWs yielded a champion PCE at 11.58% under an ambient atmosphere with improved Voc and FF. This is attributed to the fact that the NiCo2O4 NW structure possesses a higher conductivity and hole mobility, and thereby accelerates the hole extraction/transport and reduces the charge recombination loss. This work synthesized the mesoporous nanostructure NiCo2O4 as HTLs and explored the relation between the morphology of NiCo2O4 and PSC performance.
