    , Accepted 2nd March 2022First published on 7th March 2022AbstractThree chromium selenide quantum dots (CdSe QDs) with different emissions have been incorporated into PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ active layers to fabricate polymer solar cells (PSCs). It has been proved that CdSe QDs gather on the top surface of active layers. The photon harvesting efficiency in the ultraviolet region improved and the charge transport capacity enhanced in all CdSe QD-doped PSCs due to the high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the ultraviolet light conversion to visible light and the high conductivity of CdSe QDs, respectively, which leads to a higher short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). However, CdSe QDs with different PL emissions have different effects on the performance of PSCs. CdSe QDs with 623 nm emission is more effective in promoting photon harvesting in the ultraviolet region but gives a smaller effect to improve the charge transport than that emitted by CdSe QDs at 525 nm and 462 nm. It results in almost the same efficiency of the three devices doped with different CdSe QDs at different PL emissions. Finally, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improved from 8.87% of the control device to 9.77%, 9.71%, and 9.75% of the three devices with CdSe QDs, respectively.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have advantages such as low-cost, light weight, flexibility, non-toxicity, and easy fabrication via printing and roll-to-roll coating technologies, which can help ease the energy crisis and environmental problems as an alternative energy source.1–4 To date, the best reported PCE achieved is 18.22%,5 but it still needs to be further improved for future commercial applications. It is well-known that most organic materials utilized as donors and acceptors in PSCs can harvest photons in the visible light region, which waste energy at the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. There are many approaches to improve the light harvesting efficiency of PSCs such as developing new organic donor and acceptor materials,6,7 tandem cell approach,8 and ternary organic solar cells.9 Zou et al. reported a new class of non-fullerene acceptor, Y6, which provides a wide absorption range from 300 nm to 820 nm by forming the PM6:Y6 system.10 Forrest et al. utilized the DTDCPB:C70 system and PCE-10:BT-CIC to form tandem solar cells and expanded the absorption range.11 Liu et al. reported ternary organic solar cells comprising two different non-fullerene acceptors ITIC-Th and SdiPBI-Se and a benzodithiophene polymer donor PBDT-T1 to improve weak light absorption in the 700–800 nm region.12 In these previous reports, the approach for improving the light harvesting efficiency is to enhance the absorption of visible and near-infrared light but the absorption of light at short wavelength is neglected.
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are widely used in light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics with their extraordinary attributes such as a broad absorption range, high conductivity, good compatibility with solution-processed techniques, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).13–15 S. J. In et al. synthesized SnO2 QDs as the electron transport layer in the PBDB-T:IT-4F solar cells.16 SnO2 QDs with a diameter of 3–4 nm exhibited excellent optical transmittance with well-matched energy levels to suppress Eloss and improve the photovoltaic performance. Haowei Wang et al. reported utilizing PbS QDs as an infrared absorption layer between P3HT and PCBM layers.17 The PbS QDs layer with optimal thickness enhanced the infrared absorption of solar cells and finally improved the performance. These features make suitable QDs having the potential to enhance the performance of PSCs by improving the photon harvesting efficiency at short or long wavelength and charge transport. Besides, the same kind of QDs would have different photoelectric characteristics because of their different diameters, which could have different effects on the performance of solar cells.
In this work, we achieved positive effects arising from the addition of three CdSe QDs with different PL emissions into the blend of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). CdSe QDs transfer ultraviolet light such as 350 nm to 462 nm, 525 nm, and 623 nm, respectively, which could be absorbed by PTB7-Th and PC71BM and improve the photon harvesting efficiency in the ultraviolet region. In addition, the charge transport capacity of PSCs was improved by CdSe QDs. Finally, Jsc and FF, the photovoltaic performance indicators of the prepared PTB7-Th:PC71BM photovoltaic devices, were enhanced.
Experimental
Chromium selenide quantum dots (CdSe QDs) were purchased from Mesolight Inc., China. PTB7-Th and PDINO were commercially procured from Solarmer Inc., China and PC71BM was purchased from Nano-C Inc., USA. All materials were used as received. Chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were commercially procured from Sigma-Aldrich, USA, with purity greater than 99.9% and 98.0%, respectively. The devices were fabricated with the structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM:CdSe QDs/PDINO/Ag, which is shown in Fig. 1a. The blend solution of PTB7-Th:PC71BM:CdSe QDs was prepared as follows: PTB7-Th and PC71BM with the weight ratio of 2:3 were dissolved in chlorobenzene with overall concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and stirred at 25 °C in a N2 glovebox for 12 h. Then, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and CdSe QDs solutions were blended to make the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:CdSe QDs solution, where the weight ratios of CdSe QDs and PTB7:PC71BM blend was 0, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10% respectively. 3% DIO as an additive was added into the dissolved solutions an hour before spinning coating the active layer.

The devices were prepared on glass/ITO substrates. Firstly, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance of 15 ohm/square) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent solution deionized water, acetone, ethanol successively for 30 min, and then immediately blow-dried by high density nitrogen, followed by plasma UV processing for 90 s. A highly conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS was spin coated onto the treated ITO substrates from an aqueous solution at 5000 rpm for 40 s, then these ITO coated with PEDOT:PSS were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. Then, the active layer, PTB7-TH:PC71BM as a reference, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:CdSe QDs were prepared through spin coating at 1000 rpm for 90 s in an N2-filling glove box. Then, the wet films were thoroughly dried in a vacuum chamber for 1 h. Then, PDINO (1 mg mL−1 in methylalcohol) electron transport layer was spin-coated on the active layer at 3000 rpm for 50 s. Finally, Ag cathodes (with the film thickness of 1000 Å) were deposited on the top at the rate of 1.5 Å s−1 under a vacuum pressure of 2 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the solar cells is 4 mm2.
The J–V characteristic curves of the solar cells were measured with a Keithley 4200 source equipment unit under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. EQE measurements were performed using a QE/IPCE Measurements Solar Cell Scan 100 (ZOLIX, China) system equipped with a calibrated silicon photodiode as the reference cell. The UV-vis absorption spectrum was acquired on a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrometer. EL spectra were recorded using a Keithley 2410 to support the bias and detectors in Horiba FL 1000. The surface morphology and electrical potential of the films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (MFP-3D Infinity). Electrochemical measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner zennium) and performed on PSCs under irradiation from a solar simulator for EIS measurement and from a light emitting diode (white) for IMVS/IMPS measurements, respectively.
Results and discussion
The device structure and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), valence band, and conduction band of the component materials used in the devices are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The molecular structures of the organic polymer donor PTB7-Th, fullerene acceptor PC71BM that was used as the photoactive layer, and water/alcohol soluble organic material PDINO used as electron transfer layer are shown in Fig. 1c.

Fig. 2a shows the PL spectra of pure CdSe QDs films excited at 350 nm. CdSe QDs show a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of ∼80%, 90%, and 90% with a peak wavelength of 462 nm, 525 nm, and 623 nm, respectively. The PL emissions of CdSe QDs overlap with the absorption of PTB7-Th and PC71BM shown in Fig. 2b, which means that CdSe QDs could help to convert ultraviolet light such as 350 nm to visible light such as 462 nm, 525 nm, and 623 nm, respectively, which can be adsorbed by the blend of PTB7-Th and PC71BM. The absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:PC71BM film doped with 3% different CdSe QDs are shown in Fig. 2c. The blend films with CdSe QDs exhibit stronger photon harvesting ability between 350 nm and 390 nm than the blended film without CdSe QDs, demonstrating that the incorporation of CdSe QDs could help to absorb ultraviolet light, which means the enhanced ultraviolet sensibility of solar cells.

In order to investigate whether increased photons absorbed between 350 nm and 390 nm that can be utilized in solar cells, the J–V characteristics of devices doped with 3% CdSe QDs under 350 nm illumination were measured, which is shown in Fig. 2d. The Jsc of the control device without CdSe QDs is almost zero; meanwhile, the Jsc of the devices with CdSe QDs increase to more than 3 mA cm−2. It reveals that light in the ultraviolet region is transferred by the CdSe QDs to light between 450 nm and 700 nm, which is utilized in solar cells.

Fig. 2e shows the J–V characteristics curves of all the devices under AM 1.5G illumination with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The control device without CdSe QDs exhibits a Jsc of 16.42 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.79 V, and FF of 68.35%, which results in a PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 8.87%. As expected, the performance of the devices doped with CdSe QDs was improved dramatically as the best PCE was 9.77% (623 nm), 9.71% (525 nm), and 9.75% (462 nm), respectively, with 3% doping concentration (shown in Tables S1–S3†), which mainly comes from the improvement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF). Jsc increased by about 5%, FF increased by about 2%, and Voc also increased from 0.79 V to 0.81 V. As a result, the PCE of devices with CdSe QDs increased by about 10%, while there is little difference in the performance of devices with different CdSe QDs. The detailed data of all device performances are summarized in Table 1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed as shown in Fig. 2f. The EQE value between 350 nm and 400 nm of all the devices doped with CdSe QDs is higher than that of the control device, and the device with CdSe QDs at 623 nm has the best enhancement than the other devices, which is consistent with enhanced light absorption, as shown in Fig. 2c. It is plausible to consider that the best performance of the device with CdSe QDs at 623 nm is due to its high PLQY for the ultraviolet light excitation to emit 623 nm light and in addition to the best absorption at 623 nm of PTB7-Th. Besides, the EQE of devices doped with CdSe QDs from 450 nm to 715 nm is also significantly improved while the corresponding absorption intensity increases slightly. It indicates that in addition to increasing absorption, CdSe QDs can also promote charge transfer and extraction.

The location and distribution of CdSe QDs in the active layer is very important to allow them to play their role in influencing the whole device performance. To figure out the distribution of CdSe QDs in the active layer, scanning kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) was used to examine the surface potential of films with and without CdSe QDs. During the scanning process, an AC voltage along with a DC voltage was applied to the tip while the sample substrate was grounded. The electrostatic force between the sample and the tip would be nullified by the automatically adjusted DC voltage. The surface potential of the sample is defined as the following eqn (1).18,19 (1)where SP is the acronym of surface potential, Vdc is the DC voltage, q is the electron charge, φtip and φsample are the work functions of the tip and the sample, respectively. Fig. 3 depicts the surface potential images and cross-sectional line profile of PTB7-Th:PC71BM films without and with 3% CdSe QDs at different PL emissions. As can be seen from the images, there is a great difference in the surface potentials of the films without and with CdSe QDs. The average surface potential of the pure PTB7-Th:PC71BM film was −420 mV. After doping with CdSe QDs, the surface potential of the active layer decreased to −540 mV, −521 mV, and −500 mV, respectively for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film doped with CdSe QDs peaking at 623 nm, 525 nm, and 462 nm. The surface potential of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film without CdSe QDs was ∼0.1 eV higher than that with different CdSe QDs, while the surface potential of the films with different CdSe QDs was almost the same with each other. According to the previous reports,20 the quantum dots tend to gather in the upper layer of the film while they are mixed with organic materials. For this purpose, the charge neutrality level (CNL) of the blend film, which is the organic “effective” Fermi levels, is calculated according to:21,22 qVfb = EFP − ECNL − S(ϕc − ECNL)(2)where q is the elementary charge, Vfb is the flat-band potential, EFP represents the hole Fermi level, ϕc is the work function of metals, and S depends directly on the DOS around the CNL.23,24Eqn (2) predicts a linear relationship between qVfb and ϕc, with a negative slope equaling the parameter S, whereas ECNL is calculated from the intercept. Mott–Schottky analysis was used to get different values of Vfb with different cathode metals. For a Schottky diode, the junction capacitance, which appears as a consequence of the depletion layer modulation, exhibits a bias dependence according to the Mott–Schottky relation.25 (3)where V is the applied voltage, q accounts for the elementary charge, εs is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, and N is the concentration of acceptor impurities (doping level). By examining eqn (3), it can be realized that N can be derived from the experimental slope of the V ∝ C−2 plot, whereas the flat-band voltage is extracted from the intercept. With the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/metal (Al, Ag, and Au), Mott–Schottky analysis is illustrated in Fig. 4a. Vfb with the corresponding cathode metal is 0.49 V (Al ∼ 4.2 eV), 0.48 V (Ag ∼ 4.26 eV), and 0.41 V (Au ∼ 5.1 eV), respectively, and the result is plotted in Fig. 4b. According to eqn (2) and Fig. 4b, it is necessary to calculate the value of EFP for estimating ECNL. The position of the Fermi level corresponding to the p-doped organic blend is approximated by means of the expression26 EFP ≈ EDHOMO − kBTln(NHOMO/p0)(4)where EDHOMO is the energy of the HOMO level of the donors, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T represents the temperature. The density of states at the HOMO level is taken as NHOMO ∼ 1020 cm−3, the background hole density caused by the doping as extracted from the Mott–Schottky analysis results in p0 = N ∼ 3 × 1016 cm−3 (shown in Fig. 4a). Under these assumptions, one arrives at EFP ≈ −5.02 eV, and combining this result by evaluating from the linear fit in Fig. 4b, the calculation gives a value ECNL ≈ −4.58 eV. The work function of CdSe QDs is −5.05 eV (623 nm), −4.95 eV (525 nm), and −5.00 eV (462 nm) respectively, which is lower than the charge neutrality level of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film. Combining with the reduction of the surface potential after doping CdSe QDs further indicates that CdSe QDs are enriched on top of the active layers.

Therefore, electrons generated under light inside the active layer are promoted to transport to the surface CdSe QDs and holes are left inside the active layer. To combine with the high conductivity of the CdSe QDs, electrons are rapidly collected by the cathode, which decreases the probability of carrier recombination. It improves the carrier transport and enhances the open circuit voltage; the Jsc and Voc increase after doping CdSe QDs.
In order to investigate the effect of incorporation of CdSe QDs on the morphology of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film, the surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films without and with CdSe QDs were presented by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (surface area: 10 × 10 μm2), as shown in Fig. 5. The root mean square roughness (RMS) of different blend films are 1.108 nm (without CdSe QDs), 1.150 nm (CdSe QDs peaking at 623 nm), 1.280 nm (CdSe QDs peaking at 525 nm), and 1.134 nm (CdSe QDs peaking at 462 nm). The RMS values reveal that the surface of the blend films becomes a little rougher on adding CdSe QDs, but the change is not significant, and there is no obvious change in the phase diagram. It means that the doping of CdSe QDS has little effect on the surface morphology of the active films.

Besides the effect on the UV sensitivity, in order to figure out the effect of CdSe QDs on the charge transport in the devices, the dark J–V characteristics of electron-only devices were measured with the structure ITO/active layer/PDINO/Ag shown in Fig. 6a. The Jsc of the doped devices is larger than that of the control device, while the Jsc of the devices with CdSe QDs at 525 nm and 462 nm is larger than that of the devices with CdSe QDs at 623 nm. It means that CdSe QDs are beneficial for enhancing the electron transport property and CdSe QDs at 525 nm and 462 nm are more effective than CdSe QDs at 623 nm. Then, we made a realistic evaluation on the apparent charge carrier mobility of blend films through the spare charge limit current (SCLC) method.27,28 According to the Mott–Gurney law, current density is given by (eqn (5)).29 (5)where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the BHJ layer, μ is the charge carrier mobility, L is the thickness of the BHJ layer, and V is the voltage drop across the device. The computed results show that the electron-mobility μe increases from 1.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (623 nm), 4.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (525 nm) and 4.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (462 nm), respectively. These are direct evidence that the charge transport capacity is largely enhanced by doping CdSe QDs and the enhanced charge transfer contributes to the improvement of Jsc, FF, as well as the performance of the solar cells.

Otherwise, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) curves and the EL spectra for the devices without and with 3% of different CdSe QDs were obtained, and plotted in Fig. 6b and c. In principle, Jph is calculated according to:30,31 Jph = JL − JD(6)Where JL and JD represent the current density under AM 1.5G illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is calculated according to Veff = V0 − Va(7)where V0 stands for the voltage, at which Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. We can find that Jph shows linear dependence on the voltage at a low Veff (<0.1 V), and rapidly reaches saturation at the high Veff (>1 V). It clearly shows that the devices with CdSe QDs have a little higher saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) than that of the control devices. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) of the devices determined by Jph/Jsat under short circuit condition are 93.08%, 94.30% (623 nm), 94.47% (525 nm), and 94.21% (462 nm), respectively. The almost identical P(E,T) indicates that CdSe QDs does not promote the exciton dissociation effectively. However, the EL intensity of the devices with CdSe QDs decreases dramatically than that of the control devices, which manifests that the addition of CdSe QDs reduces radiative recombination. It is plausible that the increased electron mobility promotes the electron to reach the electrode and be extracted. Furthermore, the same EL peak positions of the four devices demonstrate that CdSe QDs are not the third component for forming the ternary solar cells but facilitate charge transfer and photon utilization.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the effect of CdSe QDs on the electrical properties of solar cells. Fig. 6d shows the corresponding Nyquist plots of the devices without and with 3% CdSe QDs at different PL emissions, and measured at V = Voc under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). The impedance data were fitted to the equivalent circuit consisting of an ohmic series resistance (RΩ) in series with a parallel combination of a charge transfer resistance (RCT) and a constant phase element, as illustrated in Fig. 6d. RΩ was mainly contributed from the electrical contacts and the sheet resistance of the electrodes. RCT was mainly caused by the charge-transport resistance at the blend active layer/electrode interfaces and/or inside the blend active layer.32,33 All the devices show similar RΩ, which is corresponding to the results from the AFM images. The RCT values of the PSCs decrease significantly after doping CdSe QDs, from 29.52 Ω cm2 for the devices without CdSe QDs to 17.96, 15.96 and 14.12 Ω cm2 for the devices with CdSe QDs at 623 nm, 525 nm, and 462 nm, respectively. The lower RCT value for the devices with CdSe QDs indicates better charge transportation; it is favorable to obtain higher Jsc and FF in comparison with the contrast devices.
To get more information on the effect of CdSe QDs on recombination dynamics and charge transport, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were carried out with small light perturbation (under 10%), as shown in Fig. 7 and S1.† The electron transport time (τtr), the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn), the electron recombination lifetime (τr), the charge collection efficiency (ηcc), and the electron diffusion length (LD) were determined from IMPS and IMVS measurements using the following schemes.34,35 τtr = 1/2πfmin,IMPS(8) (9) τr = 1/2πfmin,IMVS(10) ηcc = 1 − τtr/τr(11) (12)where fmin,IMPS and fmin,IMVS represent the frequency minimum of the imaginary part in IMPS and IMVS measurements, respectively, and L represents the layer thickness. The calculated results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.

According to the calculated results, τtr decreases after adding CdSe QDs, which increases Dn; as a result, LD increases from 12.20 nm to 15.40 nm, 17.24 nm, and 18.05 nm, respectively. It is corresponding to the electron mobility, indicating that in the devices with CdSe QDs, the electron could reach the electrode more easily than that in the devices without CdSe QDs. However, there is no significant change in τr, which implies that CdSe QDs do not optimize the recombination in the solar cells. According to the results of τtr and τr, ηcc increases from 67.49% to 71.54%, 77.27%, and 79.26%, respectively. It indicates that CdSe QDs promotes the electron to be extracted by the electrode. Moreover, the LD and ηcc of devices with CdSe QDs at 525 nm and 462 nm are higher than that of devices with CdSe QDs at 623 nm, which means that CdSe QDs at 525 nm and 462 nm are more effective in optimizing charge transport than CdSe QDs at 623 nm. It is why the performance of the devices with CdSe QDs at 623 nm is almost the same with that of the devices with the other two CdSe QDs, even if the devices with CdSe QDs have better photon harvesting capability at a short wavelength.
Conclusions
In summary, we utilized three CdSe QDs at different PL emissions by incorporating them into polymer solar cells composed of PTB7-Th and PC71BM to enhance the Jsc and FF, which results in the PCE increasing from 8.87% to 9.77%, 9.71%, and 9.75%, respectively. The performance improvement of the polymer solar cells is attributed to the enhancement of the photon harvesting capability in the ultraviolet region and charge transport. CdSe QDs are 623 nm is more effective in promoting light absorption in the ultraviolet region but give a smaller effect on improving charge transport than CdSe QDs at 525 nm and 462 nm. It results in almost the same efficiency among devices with three CdSe QDs at different PL emissions. Overall, the incorporation of quantum dots provides a new and effortless method to improve the UV sensitivity, which means that the PSCs could obtain high UV photon harvesting capacity and good performance at a small thickness.
