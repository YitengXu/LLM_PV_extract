    , Accepted 16th April 2020First published on 17th April 2020AbstractTwo spirocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives were prepared to clarify the molecular geometry effects on the regulation of the crystalline morphologies and photophysical behaviors of organic nanocrystals. Due to the different structural symmetry of a spiro-center, distinguishing nanocrystal morphologies with unique crystallization-enhanced/quenched emission was achieved.
Recently, self-assembling organic semiconductors into crystalline micro-/nanostructures has attracted attention in the design and development of organic micro-/nanophotonic devices1 and flexible electronics.2 This is because the purity and the long-range order of organic crystals are among the key factors used to study the intrinsic properties of a material free from grain boundaries; at the same time, at the micro- and nano-scale, these crystals can offer novel functionalities in fields such as nanophotonics.3 Most of the organic semiconductors that have been exploited so far are π-conjugated organic molecules with a planar geometry, including pyrene,4 perylene,5 perylene tetracarboxylic diimide,2a condensed aromatics,6 their derivatives, and so on.2c On the other hand, non-planar molecules have been employed relatively much less compared to planar ones to achieve the desired self-assemblies. Actually, compared with their planar counterparts, non-planar compounds with multiple aromatic planes have several inherent advantages, such as favourable solubility, higher thermal and electrochemical stability, as well as superior photoelectric performances.7 However, controllable preparation of organic nanocrystals from non-planar molecules and their corresponding molecular structure–morphology–property relationships have not been elaborated yet.
Spirocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (SAHs) are one of the most favorable non-planar organic semiconductors due to their unique cruciform-shaped configuration.8 Connecting two aromatic moieties with an sp3-carbon spiro-center enables SAHs, simultaneously, to provide steric hindrance and to expand supramolecular interactions in 3D space.9 The topological superiority of this non-planar 3D configuration allows many more possibilities for versatile applications, such as in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),10 miniaturized lasers, and transistor memory devices.11 Also, the SAH-based hole transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is a crucial component to achieve a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of up to 20%.12 Although amorphous SAHs have successfully been used in the fabrication of a variety of optoelectronics, assembling them into crystalline nanostructures is a great challenge. This is partially due to the large steric hindrance of a spiro-center, which can prevent the easy packing of molecules, resulting in glass-forming tendency of the SAHs.13 Effective solution processing of self-assembly requires a sufficient synergism of various driving forces and this, in turn, demands the modification of the steric spiro-center with an appropriate segment.14 Recently, we reported an effective preparation of ultrathin 2D nanocrystals from a planar pyrene segment-modified SAH molecule.15 The cooperative effect between steric repulsion from SAHs and supramolecular attractive forces from pyrene contributes to the generation of a 2D morphology. After this, a series of SAHs were developed and their corresponding crystalline self-assemblies and properties were systematically explored.7c,9b,14,16 Regrettably, there were few systems simultaneously focusing on the effect of the molecular geometric symmetry on packing, morphology, and photophysical behavior of SAH micro/nanostructures at that time.
Herein, the geometry effect was explored based on two typical SAH derivatives, SBF-OMeTAD and SFX-OMeTAD.12a,17 With highly asymmetric topological configuration, SFX-OMeTAD shows non-balanced steric hindrance and weaker intermolecular interaction in the arrangement and thus exhibits isolated single-molecular behavior, which is crucial for the suppression of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and enhancement of luminescence efficiency in the crystal state. The SFX-OMeTAD nanotubes (NTs) show unique crystalline-enhanced emission, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) 310% higher than that of disordered solution-processed films. Finally, there is outstanding emission of NTs with controlled dimensions and crystalline forms and they act as optical resonators for laser applications. Self-assembled organic single-crystalline nanostructures with high photoluminescence quantum yields, smooth morphologies, minimized defects and eliminated grain boundaries may open up the possibility of the use of the distinct functionality of organic photonics in electrical pumping lasers.

Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of two model SAH derivatives. It should be noted that SBF-OMeTAD has a symmetrical SBF core, while SFX-OMeTAD has an asymmetric SFX core. To obtain more information on their space architectures and packing arrangements, single crystals of the two compounds are cultivated through a solvent diffusion method (Table S1†). The key crystal parameters are listed in Table S2† and the crystal structures are shown in Fig. S1.† From their crystallographic data, it was found that both compounds belong to the triclinic space group P, but have different cell parameters. The torsion angles of 90.00° (SBF-OMeTAD) and 97.45° (SFX-OMeTAD) between two spiro-carbon connected π-conjugated fragments are derived from the crystallographic data; these angles are indicative of the intrinsic backbone symmetry, which is the key to self-assembling into hierarchical uniform crystalline structures.
 Scheme 1  Molecular formulas of the model compounds: (a) SBF-OMeTAD and (b) SFX-OMeTAD. 
Interestingly, the centro-symmetry allows SBF-OMeTAD to form a compact face-to-face arrangement in its crystalline framework. The vertical π⋯π distance between the two fluorene rings (Fig. 1a and b) is estimated to be ∼3.29–3.31 Å, which is smaller than 3.5 Å, a distance characteristic of closely packed π⋯π systems, indicating that significant exciton coupling is liable to occur between the stacked conjugated fragments. In contrast, the case of SFX-OMeTAD is entirely different from the above motifs of SBF-OMeTAD, for which the edge-to-edge packing (C–H⋯π interactions) between the fragments is the main feature. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, SFX-OMeTAD adopts an isolated single-molecular behavior, and no π–π stacking is found between the conjugated units. Such a typical packing mode should be partially attributed to its highly asymmetric topological configuration, which enhances the non-balanced steric hindrance and decreases the intermolecular interaction with the neighboring molecules compared with the SBF assembly. Additionally, a weak C–H⋯O interaction with a distance of 2.62 Å is observed between the SFX core and the outer arms, which is the assistant force to stabilize the isolated single-molecular behavior in the crystalline framework.

In order to explore the influence of molecular packing on self-assembly, microstructures of the two compounds were prepared by a facile reprecipitation method at room temperature.15,18Fig. 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of regular nanobelts (NBs) with an average length/width/height ratio of 2000:25:1 (80 μm in length, 1 μm in width and 40 nm in height) and NTs with an average length/diameter ratio of 75:1 (30 μm in length and 400 nm in diameter) that are manufactured from SBF-OMeTAD and SFX-OMeTAD, respectively. Furthermore, the detailed crystallization properties of the two microstructures are further determined by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The coincident XRD patterns of the nanocrystals, shown in the top panel of Fig. S2,† reveal that all the peaks are in good agreement with the single-crystal XRD results, and no other diffraction peaks are observed. As shown in the insets of Fig. 2b and e, the SAED patterns with remarkable bright spots demonstrate that the two structures are single crystalline rather than polycrystalline, and the crystal indices of the spots (marked with red circles) can be indexed according to the crystal parameters.19 From the SAED results, the preferential growth directions of both SBF-OMeTAD NBs and SFX-OMeTAD NTs are definitely along the [100] direction.20 The detailed crystal packing in the NBs and NTs is shown in Fig. S3–4.† The above-discussed results illustrate that tailoring the symmetry of a spiro-core can remarkably modulate the packing mode and the morphology of the self-assembled single-crystalline microstructures.

Insets of (c) and (f): height profiles along the white line in the AFM images of the two micro/nanocrystal structures. 
Along with the strong influence on micro-/nanocrystal morphologies, molecular packing can also deeply affect the optical properties. To gain insight into exciton behaviour, the steady-state and transient photophysical properties of the two compounds are determined in dilute solution, spin-coated films, and nanocrystals (Fig. 3 and Table S3†). In solution, the two compounds exhibit similar absorption peaks at ∼305 nm and ∼380 nm but slightly different photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As shown in Fig. S5,† the HOMO energy level of SBF-OMeTAD is mainly located in the SBF core, but the LUMO is located in one-part of the diphenylamine-fluorene segments. On the other hand, for SFX-OMeTAD, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are located in one-part of the diphenylamine-fluorene segments. These results imply that the torsion angles of spiro-cores have an influence on the electronic structure and photophysical properties of an active π-conjugated backbone in a single-molecular state. The same as in the solution case, the spin-coated films of the two compounds show similar maximum absorption peaks at ∼315 nm and 395 nm; however, this time, an emission band for both compounds is observed at around ∼446 nm. The change in the dielectric constant of aggregates contributed to the red shift of the film emission compared to that of the solution.16a,21 This means that PL parameters are not only sensitive to the electronic structure, but also to the physical defects such as molecular packing modes and aggregate states that are governed by the balance of various non-covalent interactions. In contrast to the two previous cases, the PL emission of the two SAH derivatives has completely different profiles in the nanocrystal state. SFX-OMeTAD exhibits only one sharp peak at 447 nm, while SBF-OMeTAD shows a blue emission peak at 446 nm with a long wavelength emission band at 533 nm. This variance in crystal emissions indicates that the difference in molecular aggregates strongly influences the excitonic behavior.

(f) Transient PL decay spectra of SBF-OMeTAD monitored at 440 nm in dimethyl sulfoxide (THF) solution, and at 446 and 533 nm in the nanocrystal film. The insets of (a) and (c) show the photographs of the corresponding solution and the nanocrystal film under a 365 nm UV lamp, respectively. 
In order to further elucidate the source of long wavelength emission in SBF-OMeTAD NBs, the transient PL decay spectra of SBF-OMeTAD and SFX-OMeTAD in both solution and nanocrystal states are measured. As shown in Table S3,† the averaged lifetimes (τ) of SFX-OMeTAD are 1.41 and 1.21 ns, in the solution and crystal case, respectively. This difference in τ is negligible, which indicates that the emission in each case is due to the similar emitting sites. For SBF-OMeTAD (Fig. 3f), the τ of the blue emission band (446 nm) in nanocrystals is 1.94 ns, which is similar to that in the solution case (1.98 ns), while the τ of the green band (533 nm) is 7.67 ns, which is several times longer than that of the blue emission band. In addition, according to the fluorescence excitation–emission contour plot shown in Fig. 3d, the excitation spectra of the two emission bands are similar, which confirms that the additional emission band at 533 nm originates from the intermolecular excimer emission. Therefore, we can conclude that the blue emissions of SBF-OMeTAD NBs and SFX-OMeTAD NTs come from their intrinsic singlet emissions, while the green band of SBF-OMeTAD NBs is due to the intermolecular excimer emissions.22 The differences in the photophysical properties of SFX-OMeTAD and SBF-OMeTAD match well with their corresponding crystal packing; the excimer emission of SBF-OMeTAD NBs clearly originates from the face-to-face π-π stacking of the fluorene–fluorene interaction.
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4a and Table S3,† the two compounds have relatively high PLQE (Φ) of 80% for SBF-OMeTAD and 82% for SFX-OMeTAD because of their single-molecular excitonic behavior in dilute solution. Upon evaporation of the solvent molecules, the PLQE values of the amorphous film decrease to 23% and 10.4%, respectively, corresponding to decreases of approximately 71% and 87% compared to that in the solution state, due to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). As expected, the PLQE value of SBF-OMeTAD NBs is further reduced to 9.5%, which is due to the continuous action of the ACQ effect in the crystal state. Excitonic coupling resulting from the excimer emission contributes to the crystalline-quenched emission of SBF-OMeTAD NBs. In sharp contrast to the case of the amorphous film and NBs of SBF-OMeTAD, a remarkable crystalline-enhanced emission is observed in SFX-OMeTAD NTs. The PLQE value of SFX-OMeTAD NTs increases to 41% from 10% of the amorphous film of SFX-OMeTAD, corresponding to a 310% increase. For the SFX-OMeTAD crystal, benefiting from its highly asymmetric topological configuration and isolated single-molecular packing, the fluorene emitting backbones are independently encapsulated in a uniform rigid structure, which prevents intermolecular exciton coupling and excimer emission. In addition, dense packing can suppress the molecular vibration and motion in crystalline structures, which can effectively inhibit energy consumption and exciton recombination. According to the formula Kr = Φ/τ, the radiative rate constants (Kr) of SFX-OMeTAD NTs can be calculated as 0.36. The excellent emission behavior, suitable molecular alignment, and stable morphology indicate that the crystalline, hierarchical, and uniform condensed structure of SFX-OMeTAD NTs can be useful in optoelectronic device platforms.

Finally, the stimulated emission behaviors of the as-prepared SFX-OMeTAD NTs are examined by ultrafast PL measurements, to shed light on the optical properties of these architectures. As shown in Fig. 4b, blue emission spectra are obtained by exciting the isolated MT with a femtosecond pulse laser. Under low pump intensity, the PL spectrum features a broad spontaneous emission peak. When the pump density approaches 219.31 W cm−2, a series of sharp lasing peaks, centered at 447 nm, emerge. Fig. 4c shows the integrated area intensity of laser peaks as a function of pump density. From this, the threshold can be clearly identified as 219.31 W cm−2. Moreover, there is a brighter blue emission at the two end faces of the NTs and a weaker luminescence in the body, as shown in the micro-PL image in the inset of Fig. 4c. This is a typical characteristic of a Fabry–Perot (FP) optical microresonator.23 On the other hand, in the case of SBF-OMeTAD NBs, no lasing action or amplified spontaneous emission is detected, even for the highest possible optical excitation. In this regard, the use of the asymmetric spiro-center of our microtube framework is an effective strategy towards low-threshold organic microtube lasers.
To summarize, the effect of structural symmetry on molecular packing, crystalline morphology, and photophysical behavior of model SAH nanocrystals is systematically investigated for the first time. Compared to the symmetrical spiro-sites, the centro-asymmetric configuration of SFX-OMeTAD allows the molecules to self-assemble into an isolated single-molecular packed crystalline framework, which suppresses the excimer emission-caused ACQ and effectively maintains the high-efficiency single-molecular excitonic behavior. The effectiveness of the asymmetric configuration in the microtube form is demonstrated by the deep-blue laser emission. These results pave the way for the rational design of crystallization-emission enhanced organic semiconductor systems toward the desired photoelectric applications.
