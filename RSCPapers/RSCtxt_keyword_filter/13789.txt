1. Introduction
Energy has consistently been the main impetus for human advancement. With the quick development of the economy and society these days, energy still mainly relies on the combustion of fossil fuels, which have been used since the industrial revolution. However, people's demand for energy is increasing rapidly and sharply. Fossil energy reserves are not only limited but also inevitably bring geological damage, greenhouse effects, and environmental pollution, resulting in the gradual deterioration of our living environment.1,2 Consequently, it is urgent to search for clean, efficient, and sustainable new energy sources for our use. It is known to all that solar power, wind energy, and some other renewable energies occupy a growing share of energy consumption; however they cannot be used directly due to the limitations of time and space.3 Therefore, many efforts have been dedicated to discover and improve energy storage and conversion devices with high energy density. Among them, electrochemical energy storage technologies, due to their advantages of convenience, efficiency, no operation pollution, and long cycle life, have attracted greater and greater attention.4 In the last 200 years, various types of electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices have been proposed and placed into handy applications,5 such as lithium-ion batteries,6,7 metal–air batteries,8,9 fuel cells,10,11 supercapacitors,12–14etc. Among these electrochemical devices, metal–air batteries such as lithium–air, aluminum–air, magnesium–air, and zinc–air batteries are promising for future generations of energy conversion devices, due to their nature of high theoretical energy density (Fig. 1a). For the rechargeable metal–air batteries, Li is of special interest, and is a robust anode candidate since its theoretical specific capacity can reach 11700 Wh kg−1, which is very close to one of the most energy-dense liquids–gasoline.15 Nevertheless, the rechargeability, safety, and cost issues make them difficult to popularize in the near future. Due to these presently great challenges, zinc–air batteries (ZABs) have attracted huge consideration as an option, because of the high theoretical energy density (gravimetric capacity of 820 mA h g−1, volumetric capacity of 5855 mA h L−1 and energy density of 1086 W h kg−1), low cost (less than 10 $ kW−1 h−1), great safety and environmental friendliness.16,17

Typical ZABs normally have four main parts. The first one is the electrode consisting of a catalyst-painted gas diffusion layer (GDL), a zinc electrode, an electrolyte, and a separator. Usually, the electrolyte utilized is an alkaline solution, for example, concentrated KOH or NaOH. The typical configuration and schematic principle of a ZAB is shown in Fig. 1b.18 During the discharge process, the zinc anode oxidizes and reacts with OH− to form dissolvable zincate (Zn(OH)42−) (eqn (1)). These zincate ions subsequently precipitate if supersaturated, which results in the formation of ZnO (eqn (2)). Throughout the whole cycle, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) may occur at the same time, causing self-corrosion of the Zn anode and forming flammable hydrogen gas, which not only lowers active material utilization, but also increases the security concerns. At a cathode, oxygen diffuses into the GDL driven by a concentration gradient and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) happens at the triple-phase limit (gas–liquid–solid, eqn (3)). Subsequently, hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte transfer from the air cathode to the metallic anode and complete the battery reaction. During charging, these reaction pathways are switched with the reduction of zincate ions back to zinc and the release of oxygen.18,20,21 The overall reaction is shown in eqn (4).
Anode: Zn + 4OH− ↔ Zn(OH)42− + 2e−(1) Zn(OH)42− ↔ ZnO + H2O + 2OH−(2)
Cathode: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− ↔ 4OH−(3)
Overall reaction: Zn + O2 → 2ZnO(4)
Nevertheless, the large-scale commercialization of rechargeable ZABs has been notably obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics of both the ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) happening at the cathode. The main hindrance is due to the surprisingly strong OO bond (498 kJ mol−1), which is hugely hard to break electrochemically. So, in this situation, electrocatalysts can help in bond refreshing and rupture, and therefore successfully speed up ORR or OER processes.22 In the past few years, three-dimensional (3D) nano-arrays,23 two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets,24 one-dimensional (1D) nanofibers and nanotubes,25 and zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots26 have been intensively studied to expose excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for ZABs. Among all of them, 1D nanofibers attracted intensive attention due to their distinctive physical and chemical structures and properties. 1D nanomaterials have been extensively used as electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.27,28 Specifically, 1D nanomaterials are very beneficial for ZABs, which exhibit a large electrochemical active surface area with numerous catalytic active sites and faster catalytic kinetics. Furthermore, they assist ion and gas allocation between the catalyst surface and the electrolyte, expressly in the processes of OER. Benefiting from these favorable factors, 1D nanomaterials exhibit low overpotential and considerable cycle stability when used in rechargeable ZABs.29,30 When the air cathode in ZABs is constructed with 1D nanomaterials, it provides a superior discharge current density and advanced peak power density than those of Pt/C.31
Until now, many different methods have been employed to synthesise 1D nanomaterials, like hydrothermal32 and solvothermal reactions, hard and sacrificial template approaches, self-assembly, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrospinning techniques, etc.33 Among these methods, electrospinning is one of the most simple and unique ways to produce fiber or tube-like nanomaterials with adjustable compositions and controllable architectures. In recent years, the electrospinning technique has attracted enormous attention due to the production of affordable and productive electrocatalysts for ZABs. By using this technique, the elemental composition could be easily altered, which is useful to tune the electrocatalytic activity of electrocatalysts. Another advantage includes the synthesis of metal and carbon nanofibers simultaneously in a single step. Subsequently, metal could be dispersed uniformly in or on the carbon support, which is exceptionally helpful in electrocatalysis.34 As compared to other synthesis methods there are many advantages of electrospun nanofibers in ZABs, and electrospinning has the qualities of simplicity, low cost, high efficiency, and high reproducibility.35 Electrospinning is a high-yield production method for nanofibers of a marvelous variety of chemical configurations and architectures. This enables an enormous variety of properties that can be adjusted for specific purposes including flexibility, strength, specific surface area, and porosity.36 A unique advantage of electrospinning is that complex hierarchical structures can be formed via controlled calcination.37 These complex structures are hard to construct using conventional tactics like self-assembly, template-assisted synthesis, CVD, and other solution-based methods. It gives high peak power density, high capacity, good cycling stability, and favorable bendability for ZABs.38 There are already several excellent review articles for ZABs;39–42 nevertheless, the applications of electrospinning techniques on ZABs have not been summarized and reviewed specifically until now. Here, in this review, we will summarize some recent studies on the fabrication of suitable catalysts by electrospinning for zinc–air batteries, including the fabrication of heteroatom-doped carbon-based nanofibers, nonprecious metal-based nanofibers, and their hybrids and their applications in ZABs. In addition, the synthesis of novel membranes for ZABs with the electrospinning approach has also been discussed. Finally, conclusions, challenges and perspectives in this field will be discussed and presented.
2. The working principle of electrospinning techniques
The electrospinning technique began in the late 1890s and was modified in the year 1900.43–45 The layout of the electrospinning setup is very simple, so it is easy and approachable for all laboratories. The basic module of this technique encompasses a high-voltage power source, a syringe pump, a spinneret (with a single, coaxial or side-by-side nozzle), and a conductive collector, as shown in Fig. 2.46 In this strategy, a polymeric solution is filled in a syringe and a high voltage is applied between the syringe needle and collector. When a small amount of solution is injected from the syringe, the presence of high voltage and surface tension causes the droplet to attain a conical shape (Taylor cone). When the electric field force becomes more than the surface tension, a steady jet would be formed at the needle tip. Then the formed jet undergoes an elongating-and-whipping process continuously by electrostatic repulsion to form a long and thin thread until it is settled onto a collector. After evaporating the solvent, the solidified fibers with nanometer diameter are accumulated on the collector surface to form a non-woven mat of nanofibers. Heat treatment can be done if the carbonization products are needed, which could be operated in a specific atmosphere like air, activating gases, inert gases, mixtures, etc. Chemical etching or gaseous atmosphere activation is always employed to further improve the surface area and porosity. The obtained samples can be in the form of self-standing non-woven membranes (polymer fibers), powders (oxide fibers), or self-standing adaptable paper-like membranes (carbon and composite carbon-based filaments).45,47

3. Carbon-based and heteroatom-doped carbon materials
A functional and stable catalyst is required for good performance in zinc–air batteries. Among all the catalysts, precious metal-based catalysts are considered as the best catalysts for zinc–air batteries. However, the use of these catalysts is limited by scarcity, high-cost and instability.48,49 The substitution of such precious-metal-based electrocatalysts with affordable materials is pivotal for the efficient energy storage and conversion systems. To lower the cost of these precious-metal-based catalysts, carbon-based materials are heavily synthesized as a cathode catalyst in ZABs, which can provide high conductivity and durability to ensure productive electron transfer. Besides, the porous structure and high specific surface area of the carbon materials can help in mass diffusion kinetics and exposure of more active sites.50 In the past few years, tremendous work has been done like surface modification, heteroatom doping, and defect engineering to make carbon materials into functional materials.51 Among all the methods, heteroatom doping is considered as the most effective strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance. The introduction of a foreign atom into a carbon material can change its properties in various ways. The carbon-based material can be doped with single or multiple heteroatoms, including nitrogen (N), fluorine (F), boron (B), sulfur (S), and phosphorous (P).52 As the electronegativities of these atoms are different from that of carbon, the introduction of heteroatoms into the carbon nanomaterial will alter the electronic properties of the carbon materials.53 In 2009, Gong et al. reported the pioneering preparation of vertically aligned N-doped carbon nanotubes (VA-NCNTs), which act as a non-metal electrode with a good electrocatalytic performance, and long-term durability with a better tolerance to crossover impact than that of platinum for the ORR. This opens a new door for the preparation of non-metal heteroatom-doped materials for energy applications.54 Heteroatom doping of the carbon material can be done in two ways: (1) addition of a foreign atom during synthesis and (2) post doping of the carbon material by using a substrate with a heteroatom.55,56 Among all the ways, electrospinning is thought of as a very easy and cheap approach to fabricate the heteroatom-doped carbon material for ZABs with optimized performance. For mono-heteroatom-doped carbon as an example, Park et al.57 synthesized extremely porous nitrogen-doped carbon fibers by following a very simple and cost-effective electrospinning technique (Fig. 3a). Polystyrene (PS) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) were utilized in the synthesis process by following the pyrolysis at 1100 °C (N-CFs-1100). The obtained material was highly porous with a very large surface area (1271 m2 g−1). It showed magnificent electrocatalytic performance towards ORR (Fig. 3b). This is due to the hugely macro and mesoporous nitrogen-doped huge surface area as well as boosted graphitic-nitrogen class of carbon fibers. In the zinc–air battery, the N-CFs-1100 showed a high peak power density of 194 mW cm−2, which is superior to the that of the Pt/C catalyst (192 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 3c. Except for this nitrogen-doped carbon, various multiple heteroatom-doped carbons have been introduced by using a very simple and feasible electrospinning approach in recent years. As an example, Wu et al.58 reported the synthesis of F, N, and P ternary-doped macro-porous carbon (NFPC) fibers. The fabrication process is shown in Fig. 3d. By comparison with single heteroatom-doped carbon material, it showed excellent catalytic performance towards the ORR and OER. NFPC fibers showed a far lower onset potential of ∼1.3 V (vs. RHE) and a current density of 3 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.67 V (vs. RHE). When a ZAB was assembled with NFPC fibers, it showed an open-circuit voltage of about 1.6 V (Fig. 3e), superior to that of the precious metals (1.46 V, Pt/C + RuO2) and displayed a high specific capacity of 520 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It presented long-term stability because no distinct decay was observed after 200 charge–discharge cycles (Fig. 3f). Wang and colleagues53 reported nitrogen (N), fluorine (F), and boron (B) ternary doped carbon fibers (ND-CFs) by an electrospinning technique. The as-prepared ternary doped carbon nanofibers showed fibrous morphology with diameter of 200–300 nm. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ND-CFs are presented in Fig. 3g and h. They showed a 4e− transfer mechanism for the ORR. More interestingly, when the ZAB was fabricated with this non-metal catalyst, it showed superior performance as compared to Vulcan XC-72 and Pt/C–RuO2. The assembled ZAB did not demonstrate noticeable voltage deterioration after constant discharge/charge cycles (Fig. 3i). The charge/discharge polarization curves for the rechargeable ZABs are presented in Fig. 3j and the results reveal that the charge/discharge overpotential of TD-CFs is superior to that of Pt/C–RuO2. Results indicate that the synthesis of the heteroatom-doped carbon material by electrospinning is very fruitful to improve the electrocatalytic performance and battery performance for ZABs.

4. Non-precious metal-based nanofibers
Recently, transition metal-based catalysts are extensively investigated to explore alternative electrocatalysts beyond noble metal-based catalysts.59 The work on non-precious metal catalysts started in 1964, after the finding of cobalt phthalocyanine, which displays ORR electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolytes.60 This effort unlocks a new door for the inventors to discover more and more noble metal-free catalysts for ORR. Among non-precious metal-based catalysts, metal oxides,61 metal sulfides,62 transition metal macrocycles (porphyrins, and phthalocyanines),63etc. have received extensive attention. With the electrospinning approach, it is easy to construct the heterostructure of non-precious metal-based materials, and then offer a viable approach to optimize their overall electrocatalytic performance and lead them to be extensively utilized in ZABs. Recently, the distinct electronic structure of spinel NiCo2O4 attracted intense attention for oxygen electrocatalysts. For instance, Xue et al.64 synthesized the porous NiO/NiCo2O4 nanofibers by a facile electrospinning strategy (Fig. 4a), which endowed the NiO/NiCo2O4 heterostructure with electronic transmission channels and rich interface-related active sites. From the SEM image, it can be seen that NiO/NiCo2O4 had an uneven surface with mesopores, an average width of ∼95 nm, and few micrometers length (Fig. 4b). When applied as an air electrode in ZABs, the assembled liquid battery showed a stable open-circuit voltage of around 1.47 V, turning out consistently for 24 h. In contrast, when the battery was assembled with NiO and NiCo2O4 porous nanofibers, it showed an open-circuit voltage of 1.41 and 1.44 V, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4c. Fig. 4d exposes the smallest charging–discharging potential gap for NiO/NiCo2O4 porous nanofibers, outperforming those of NiCo2O4 and NiO, further displaying the outstanding catalytic performance of the NiO/NiCo2O4 heterostructure electrocatalyst. In Fig. 4e, the maximum power density of the battery with NiO/NiCo2O4 porous nanofibers attained 99.0 mW cm−2 at the current density of 175 mA cm−2, which is considerably superior to the maximum power density of NiCo2O4 and NiO cathodes. The assembled battery with NiO/NiCo2O4 also displayed good cycling durability of 175 h (Fig. 4f). Another work was reported by Prabu et al.,65 in which they synthesized hierarchical 1D nanostructured NiCo2O4 by means of a simple electrospinning method. It displays superior bifunctional oxygen electrode activity (Fig. 4g) and outstanding potential in rechargeable ZABs. One of the best samples, NCO-A1, was applied in ZABs. It showed an open-circuit potential of 1.45 V, and an average working voltage of ∼1.25 V (Fig. 4h), and displayed a high discharge capacity of ∼580 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4i). In another example, Jung et al.67 reported a work in which they synthesize one-dimensional spinel-type manganese–cobalt oxide (MCO) nanofibers by a facile electrospinning technique. It displayed admirable catalytic performance for both ORR and OER in the basic electrolyte. This behaviour is due to (i) low activation energies of MCO and CMO (named CoMn2O4) for electrons moving between cations with various valence states, and consequently, they can offer donor–acceptor chemisorption destinations for oxygen molecules during the ORR and OER, (ii) the existence of a huge number of active sites in CMO-NF and MCO-NF and porous 1D structure facilitating mass transport. Moreover, when a ZAB was constructed with CMO-NF, and MCO-NF, the voltage gap was smaller than a battery with Pt/C.

In the last few years, different approaches have been used to optimize the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts, such as structural modification, nanostructuring, combination with noble metals, or carbons, etc.68 Doping with anions or cations is considered as a useful way to modify the surface properties of materials and electronic structure energy.69 Electrospinning is an exclusive approach to fabricate cation-doped non-precious metal catalysts. For instance, Peng and their colleagues,66 synthesized sulfur-doped CaMnO3 (CMO/S) by using a unique electrospinning technique. The fabrication process is shown in Fig. 4j. The obtained catalyst showed excellent bifunctional catalytic performance and stability compared with simple CaMnO3. This outstanding behavior is due to sulfur doping, which is not only helpful in replacing oxygen atoms to optimize electrical conductivity, but also brings copious oxygen vacancies to supply sufficient catalytically active sites. When the practical application was demonstrated in a solid-state ZAB (Fig. 4k), it displayed a current density of 128 mA cm−2 at a discharge voltage of 1.0 V, which is comparable to Pt/C (140 mA cm−2). It exhibited a high peak power density of 152 mW cm−2 at 0.82 V and an open-circuit voltage of 1.32 V (Fig. 4l).
Among the numerous bifunctional electrocatalysts, perovskite oxides (ABO3-type), A-site made out of rare-earth or alkali metal, and B-site composed of transition-metal, have been intensively studied and widely applied as cathode electrocatalysts. Generally, the properties of perovskite oxides can be easily controlled with the electrospinning approach, via fractional switching of A- or B-site cations, leading to various structures and improved electrocatalytic performance.70 For example, Bu et al.71 reported mesoporous nanofibers of cation-ordered PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2−xFexO5+δ (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2, denoted as PBSCF-NF) perovskites fabricated through electrospinning. The organized B-site metal fraction and huge surface area (∼20 m2 g−1) of the mesoporous nanofiber resulted in the extraordinary performance of the ORR (Fig. 5a) and OER (Fig. 5b). The zinc–air battery constructed with this PBSCF-NF exhibited a power density of 127 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5c), which is advanced compared with the pristine air electrode (109 mW cm−2). Although it presented an inferior operating voltage (1.25 V) compared with that of Pt/C (1.38 V), the long-term stability of PBSCF-NF (56000 s) stayed much longer compared to that of the pristine air electrode (43000 s) and Pt/C (48000 s), respectively. Bian and their colleagues,72 synthesized Mg-doped perovskite LaNiO3 nanofibers (LNMO NFs) through an electrospinning technique (Fig. 5d). Mg doping did not affect the morphology and the one-dimensional nanofiber structure is maintained after pyrolysis at 700 °C (Fig. 5e). It exhibited a more optimistic half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.69 V (vs. RHE) for ORR and a low overpotential of 0.45 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OER, which is superior to that of LaNiO3 nanofibers (LNO NFs). When LNMO NFs were utilized as a cathode in ZABs, they displayed a high specific capacity of 809.9 mA h g−1. LNMO NF catalysts displayed a power density of 45 mW cm−2, which is superior to that of the battery with LNO NFs (22 mW cm−2). Furthermore, the battery with Mg-doped perovskite catalyst can run at a higher current density (150 mA cm−2). On the other hand, the battery with LNO NFs exhibited durability only at 65 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5f). The galvanostatic charge and discharge activity was tested at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with 30 min for each cycle (Fig. 5g). The final discharge and charge potentials were 0.8 and 2.1 V after 110 h for LNMO NFs, while LNO reached 0.8 and 2.4 V only after 75 h. An LED screen can be powered and lit by two zinc–air cells connected in sequence with LNMO NFs as the air cathode, as shown in Fig. 5h.

5. Hybrid materials synthesized by electrospinning for ZABs
Normally, carbon-based materials are good ORR catalysts, but with poor OER performance. The conductivity of non-precious metal-based materials, such as metal oxides, is not so good. Therefore, the ORR/OER performance is moderate. Thus, the discovery of efficient catalysts for ZABs remains challenging. One of the foremost auspicious ways to optimize electrocatalytic performance is a combination of metal nanoparticles with conductive nanocarbon. The finding of the suitable catalyst brings hybrid materials to the forefront.73,74 Previously, different strategies were employed to synthesise hybrid materials like ball milling, grinding, self-assembling, impregnating, etc. Among all the techniques electrospinning is an effective approach to synthesize different ingredients into one-dimensional (1D) fibrous nanomaterials as efficient catalysts for ZABs.75,76 For instance, bimetallic oxide materials have low conductivity, nevertheless, combination with carbon substrates can improve their conductivity and then electrocatalytic performance significantly.79 Tian et al.77 reported an elaborate approach for enhancing the ORR performance of spinel NiCo2O4 by combining the decoration of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles on electrospun carbon nanofibers and defect engineering, which endowed rich oxygen vacancies on NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (NCO@CNF-OVs). This strategy could not only increase more active sites and improve the intrinsic catalytic activity of the hybrid, but also render excellent stability for long-term operation. Thus, the as-prepared hybrid exhibits significantly improved ORR electrocatalytic performance, including a high limited current density of −5.8 mA cm−2, a positive shifting of the onset potential at 0.88 V, and half-wave potential at 0.76 V (vs. RHE). The performance of the rechargeable ZAB based on the as-prepared catalyst surpasses the one based on Pt/C catalyst significantly. The TEM image (Fig. 6a) showed the NCO nanoparticles wrapped around the electrospun CNFs clearly. The measured lattice fringes of 0.2447, 0.2029, and 0.2869 nm from Fig. 6b corresponded well to the (311), (440), and (220) planes of NiCo2O4. The synthesized NCO@CNF-OVs in a ZAB showed a higher open-circuit voltage (1.35 V) than that of the benchmark Pt/C (1.25 V) (Fig. 6c). The specific capacity of NCO@CNF-OVs was measured to be 823 mA h g−1, which is higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (760 mA h g−1), as shown in Fig. 6d. Fig. 6e indicates that, when cycling at different current densities (5, 10, 20, and 50 mA cm−2), the batteries of NCO@CNF-OVs exhibit a higher discharge voltage (1.26, 1.24, 1.20 and 1.12 V) than the batteries of Pt/C (1.21, 1.19, 1.16, and 1.09 V), respectively. Furthermore, the ZAB with NCO@CNF-OVs displayed excellent stability, the voltage showed a slight change only after 60 h operation, and the discharging and charging voltage of the battery with NCO@CNF-OVs is at 1.07 and 2.12 V, respectively. In contrast, the ZAB with Pt/C exhibited an obvious voltage change just after 15 h continuous operation at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6f). By adoption of the electrospinning technique and post-calcination treatment, Tian et al.78 synthesized and reported a hybrid catalyst with NiCo alloy nanoparticles decorated on N-doped carbon nanofibers (NiCo@N-C 2), which exhibited outstanding ORR and OER catalytic performance. As shown in SEM and TEM images (Fig. 6g and h), plenty of nanoparticles with a diameter of 50 nm dispersed on the electrospun N-doped carbon nanofibers (fiber diameter of around 100 nm) uniformly. When applied as a cathode catalyst, the battery showed an open-circuit voltage of ∼1.4 V, which is close to that of the commercial Pt/C (Fig. 6i). Furthermore, the discharge current densities of NiCo@N-C 2 and Pt/C are 57 and 83 mA cm−2 at the voltage of 1.2 V. And the NiCo@N-C 2 displayed a maximum power density of nearly 272 mW cm−2. During the charging process, the NiCo@N-C 2 exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 1.7 V, which is much smaller than that of RuO2 (1.95 V, Fig. 6j). The NiCo@N-C 2 and RuO2 exhibited almost overlapping charge polarization curves and with the same maximum power density of 317 mW cm−2. Fig. 6k indicates the corresponding long-time galvanostatic discharge and charge curves of ZABs at 10 mA cm−2 for 12 h. Apparently, NiCo@N-C 2 exhibited excellent stabilities both in the discharge and charge processes, even comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. A schematic configuration of ZABs used for battery performance in this work is given in Fig. 6l. Electrospun thin-walled nanotubes of CuCo2O4@C (symbolized as CCO@C) are synthesized (Fig. 7a) and reported by Wang et al.80 with a specific surface area of 514 m2 g−1. CCO@C displayed a positive half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) for ORR, and showed a low over-potential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for OER. When it is used as a cathode for ZABs, the CCO@C electrode showed a low discharge–charge voltage gap of 0.79 V at 10 mA cm−2 and extended the cycle life up to 160 cycles for 80 h at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 7b. CCO@C presented an open circuit voltage of 1.41 V, which is slightly lower than that of Pt/C–IrO2 (1.45 V) but higher than those of L-CCO@C and H-CCO (obtained at lower and higher oxidation temperatures), which is 1.37 V and 1.35 V, respectively. Corresponding discharge–charge polarization curves are shown in Fig. 7c. This outstanding behavior is due to the hollow mesoporous structure, very small size of CuCo2O4 nanoparticles, and a 3D conductive network, and nitrogen doping is also useful to enhance catalytic performance. Recently, transition metal sulfides have also attracted great attention from scientists for the fabrication of precious metal-free catalysts. These materials are considered as hopeful materials for the substitution of noble metal catalysts, because of their good stability, activity, and low cost.81 For example, a facile electrospinning technique was used to engineer Co9S8 and MoS2 nano-crystals embedded in porous carbon nano-flake arrays that are maintained on carbon nano-fibers (Co9S8–MoS2/N-CNAs@CNFs) by the pyrolysis of a Mo-doped Zn-, Co-zeolitic imidazolate framework, grown on carbon nano-fibers and consequent sulfuration (Fig. 7d). SEM appearance of Co9S8/N-CNAs@ CNFs indicated that various Co9S8 crystals were rooted in the nano-flake and stayed on carbon nano-fibers (Fig. 7e). TEM shows that these small nanoparticles are evenly rooted in the nano-flakes with a diameter of 2–10 nm (Fig. 7f). The hybrid showed excellent stability and catalytic activity with half-wave potential of 0.82 V (vs. RHE), enhanced compared with that of Pt/C (0.81 V vs. RHE). Besides, a ZAB using Co9S8–MoS2/NCNAs@CNFs exhibited a peak power density of 222 mW cm−2, which is superior to that of Pt/C (125 mW cm−2).81

The commercial application of flexible ZABs is harshly hindered by the use of binders, which can be helpful to increase adhesion between current collectors and catalysts but decreases conductivity, and the catalyst layer is easy to be peeled off from the current collector during the bending or stretching process.86 So the development of modern electrodes with outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability, especially flexibility/bendability is urgently needed. Electrospinning is the most appreciative technique to synthesise binder-free electrode materials.82 For example, Yan et al.86 synthesized 1D ZnO-activated hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers by using an electrospinning approach. They act as a binder-free catalyst and deliver excellent performance both in alkaline liquid-state and quasi-solid-state ZABs, giving the possibility of applications in flexible devices. Likewise, Ji et al.82 synthesized single transition metals (cobalt and nickel) on self-supported porous carbon-flake arrays as binder-free air cathodes. The obtained samples displayed outstanding dual catalytic activity. Co SA@NCF/CNF displayed an ORR half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs. RHE), which is superior to that of Co NP@NCF/CNF (0.83 V vs. RHE) and Pt/C (0.84 V vs. RHE), respectively, as shown in Fig. 7g. Co SA@NCF/CNF exhibited a low over-potential of 400 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OER. The stability and flexibility of Co SA@NCF/CNF were tested in a ZAB. It can supply a capacity of 530.17 mA h gzn−1 at a current density of 6.25 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7h). The obtained Co SA@NCF/CNF-based Zn-air batteries showed the best voltage to be used as an integrated wearable battery system for real-world applications, which can light up different LEDs (Fig. 7i).84 In another example, Niu et al.83 reported a study in which they used large-size Zn/Co-ZIF nanocrystals and loaded them onto electrospun PAN nanofibers. This unique way not only gives a hierarchical porous structure but also furnishes a uniform supply of active sites. It showed outstanding ORR performance in zinc–air batteries with a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V (vs. RHE), and a high limited current density of −5.26 mA cm−2. A ZAB was assembled for further examination. It showed a high specific capacity of 640.3 mA h g−1 and an open-circuit voltage of 1.425 V with superior durability (18 h) than that of 20 wt% Pt/C (16 h). It showed a power density of 83.5 mW cm−2 at a current density of 124.5 mA cm−2, superior to that of 20 wt% Pt/C + RuO2 (44.9 mW cm−2 at a current density of 84.2 mA cm−2), as shown in Fig. 8a. Fig. 8b shows that the LED can be powered by two ZABs. Di et al.87 reported sugar-coated haw-stick-like coreshell ZIF-67@PAN-HCCP-MIM-FeCl3 nano-fibers. Fe5C2 and Co2P nanoparticles rooted in the nitrogen and phosphorous doped carbon nanofibers, which were synthesized by electrospinning in the presence of ZIF-67. The unique sugar-coated haw-stick morphology was retained after carbonization at 900 °C. ZIF67@PAN-MIM-FeCl (named Fe/CoN/P-9), which exhibited wonderful ORR and OER activity, including exceptional ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) and an onset potential of 0.96 V (vs. RHE) in a 0.1 M KOH solution. In a ZAB, a high open-circuit voltage of 1.389 V has been obtained and can be used to power LED by two series of connected batteries.

Materials with heterostructured interfaces have shown excellent electrical and chemical properties. Especially, introducing heterointerfaces between metals and metal compounds has been verified to be a proficient technique to synthesise high-performance electrocatalysts. This will increase the fast electron transfer, the number of active sites, and surface binding energy.88 Recently. Ni|MnO heterointerfaces84 in 1D porous carbon nano-fibers (Ni|MnO/CNF) were synthesized through the electrospinning-calcination process (Fig. 8c). The SEM analysis showed that the obtained sample has an original fiber morphology (Fig. 8d). The presence of pores and abundant nanoparticles was checked by TEM (Fig. 8e). The obtained catalyst showed excellent electrochemical performance with a half-wave potential of 0.83 V (vs. RHE) for the ORR. Ni|MnO/CNF-based ZAB reflected an open-circuit voltage of 1.563 V and a high-power density of 138.6 mW cm−2. The ZAB showed long-time cycling stability exceeding 350 cycles (≈120 h), better than that of commercial Pt/C + RuO2. The electrospinning technique has also been used to synthesize hetero-nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped hierarchical spongy carbon nanofibers. For instance, Zhang et al.85 described the loading of Co/Co3O4 hetero nano-particles on N-doped 1D hierarchical porous-carbon nano-fibers (Co/Co3O4@HPCNF) with high interconnected cavities and topologies by changing environmental humidity during the electrospinning procedure. The fabrication process is shown in Fig. 8f. The best sample Co/Co3O4@HPCNF-50-based ZAB (50% humidity) displayed a high open-circuit voltage of 1.457 V, greater than that of Pt/C + RuO2 (1.426 V). Compared with Pt/C + RuO2, Co/Co3O4@HPCNF-50 battery showed a comparable voltage-gap among the charge and discharge curves, and displayed an excellent rechargeable capacity (Fig. 8g). The resultant peak power density of Co/Co3O4@HPCNF-50 ZAB is 102.5 mW cm−2, which is considerably greater than that of Pt/C + RuO2 (83.1 mW cm−2). Moreover, the Co/Co3O4@HPCNF-50 exhibited a high specific capacity of 748.5 mA h gZn−1, better than that of Pt/C + RuO2-based ZAB (734.1 mA h gZn−1), as shown in Fig. 8h. The cycling performance of ZABs at 10 mA cm−2 is further examined and shown in Fig. 8i. The voltage gap of Pt/C + RuO2 increased to 1.48 V after 400 cycles, whereas Co/Co3O4@HPCNF-50 maintained a small voltage gap of 0.91 V after the same cycles.

6. Membrane fabricated with electrospinning for ZABs
Generally, there are four chief components for zinc–air batteries; air cathode, zinc anode, electrolyte, and separator. If we look back into the literature, many works are focused on the dual-functionality of cathodes i.e. OER/ORR performance, while the anode is also a topic of investigation. But not enough attention has been devoted to electrolytes and separators.104 By looking into the charge–discharge process of ZABs, zinc ions (Zn2+) that are produced during discharge at an anode react with OH− and form Zn(OH)42−. In the reverse cycle during charging, Zn(OH)42− should stay around the zinc anode. Nonetheless, because of the concentration gradient, the ions of Zn(OH)42− were enforced to travel through the separator membrane from the zinc anode to the cathode side. Transformation of Zn(OH)42− ions to ZnO is balanced at the cathode site as compared to the anode, resulting in ZnO powder being placed on the cathode. Due to its lower solubility in an electrolytic solution of ZnO, which causes resistance to ion/electron conduction, it degrades the capacity retention during charge–discharge cycling. Due to this harmful effect, a separator membrane is urgently required, which can suppress the Zn(OH)42− without worsening OH− conduction.105 The important factors for effective membrane separators are high-ionic conductivity, outstanding ionic transport properties, good environmental stability, adequate mechanical strength, and satisfactory manufacturing cost.107,108
Microporous polyolefin films as a separator membrane are mostly used in ZABs. There are many advantages of microporous polyolefin films but still, they are not suitable for the movement of ions. A gel-type polymer electrolyte is one of the promising approaches, which is a combination of an alkaline electrolyte solution and a polymer matrix. Gel-type polymer electrolytes consist of alkaline liquid electrolyte-swollen polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyacrylic acid (PAA), and their blends with composites.109,110 The synthesis of novel membranes for ZABs have also been attempted through the electrospinning approach. As an example, Kim et al.105 synthesized a PVA/PAA nanofiber mat (PBE membrane) by using the electrospinning technique, as shown in Fig. 9a. After being swollen with KOH, Nafion is coated as an anion-repelling continuous phase in the porous area of the PAA/PVA nanofiber. It played a feasible role in attaining superior electrochemical rechargeability of ZABs. To investigate the real operating conditions of zinc–air batteries, the left chamber was filled with a 0.5 M Zn(OH)2 solution, and Zn(OH)42− starts moving towards the right chamber through the membrane. Fig. 9b shows that the concentration of Zn(OH)42− ion increases with time in the right chamber. PBE membrane blocks the passage of Zn(OH)42−, while Celgard 3501 indicated a sharp increase in the Zn(OH)42− concentration with time. The prepared PBE membranes displayed electrochemical durability over 2500 min at 20 mA cm−2 and a 10 min cycle period, as compared to the batteries of Celgard 3501 with only 900 min. In another example, Lee et al.106 synthesized electrospun nano-fiber mat reinforced composite (ERC) membranes. They consist of polyetherimide (PEI) and PVA GPE (electrolyte-swollen PVA). Most of the polymers are unstable under strongly basic conditions, while PEI showed outstanding stability under strongly alkaline conditions. In the meantime, as the GPE/PVA subsists inside the nano-mat of PEI, massive Zn(OH)42− ions, comparing with small-sized ions of OH−, might be disturbed from passing through the electrolyte filled with a free volume of polyvinyl alcohol chains. These distinctive structures and physicochemical features of electrospun nano-fiber mat-reinforced composite membranes allow the destruction of Zn(OH)42− saturation without harming OH− conductivity, consequently improving the enhancement in cycle capacity maintenance of ZABs. The prepared membrane was compared with the reference membrane (Celgard3501), and the diffusion of Zn(OH)42− is four times lower than that of the reference membrane. By using the ERC membrane, the discharge capacity improved to ∼645 mA h g−1, compared to that of Celgard3501 (∼563 mA h g−1). More interestingly, the 2nd discharge capacity for the ERC membrane was ∼213 mA h g−1, which is 7 times greater than that of Celgard 3501 (∼34 mA h g−1), as illustrated in Fig. 9c and d.

7. Conclusion, challenges and prospects
In this review, we summarized some recent work on the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts for ZABs with electrospinning technique, including the fabrication of carbon-based and heteroatom-doped carbon materials, non-precious metal-based catalysts and their hybrids. Furthermore, the fabrication of a novel membrane for using in ZABs has also been introduced. The electrospinning technique is used to synthesise 1D nanomaterials, which could provide more active sites and deliver upgraded electron transfer, and hence boost the conductivity. No doubt there is a lot of successful works reported for the fabrication of nanofibers by the electrospinning technique, but still, it is not so easy to fabricate nanofibers with configurational and structural precision, making them high-quality materials for commercial applications. By looking into the literature, it seems that there are not many applications of multi-shelled hollow nanofibers in zinc–air batteries; as these materials have more stability and efficiency, so investigators should take this into consideration (Scheme 1). On the other hand, by seeing the future demand, the production of electrospun nanofibers is limited, so investigators should focus on this to investigate a fruitful strategy for mass production. As we discussed before, many works are focused on dual-functionality of cathodes i.e. ORR/OER performance, but separator membranes are not focused yet; so investigators are requested to investigate a fruitful strategy for fabrication of useful membranes. Except for the highly efficient electrocatalysts and effective separators, anodes and electrolytes also need to be paid considerable attention. For electrically rechargeable and commercial realization of ZABs, it is crucial to fully understand the formation mechanism of the dendritic morphology of electrodeposited zinc to improve the cyclic life. And for electrolytes used in ZABs, there are two problems that need to be investigated and addressed. One is the carbonate precipitation due to the reaction between atmospheric CO2 and alkaline electrolytes. The second is water leakage. The oxygen bubbles generated during the OER process is another issue for the rechargeable ZABs. All solid-state electrolytes may be one of the developing directions to solve the above issues. Especially, flexible ZABs with stretchable and even wearable characteristics are an important research direction for the future, which may be applied to wearable cell phones, human-like electronic skins, intelligent bracelets and so on.111
