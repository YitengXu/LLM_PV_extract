Introduction
The rich field of organic electronics grew out of a combination of key advances in synthetic organic and polymer chemistry along with a collective desire to obtain lightweight and processable conducting materials for applications ranging from the fabrication of energy efficient LEDs to flexible solar cells.1–5
In a similar fashion, a general increase in knowledge as it pertains to inorganic synthesis has spurred renewed interest in π-conjugated materials containing inorganic elements. Highlights of this field include the rapid and extensive development of thiophene-based oligomers and polymers as light harvesting/charge generating species in bulk heterojunction solar cells6–11 and the use of high charge mobility silicon- and sulfur-based heterocycles in transistors.12 Furthermore novel luminescence phenomena such as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) are now readily attainable with inorganic heterocycles,13 while the continual development of inorganic polymers enables access to advantageous redox, flame resistant and self-assembly properties not readily achieved with purely organic polymers.14–16
Some challenges that initially slowed progress in heavier main group element (E)-based π-conjugated systems include: the generally high reactivity of E–C bonds due to increased bond polarity and weaker orbital overlap when large/electropositive E atoms are present, and a lack of suitable starting reagents. However as we will see, the substantial effort devoted to designing new synthetic approaches, such as the use of Zr/E exchange to prepare main group heterocycles,17 has enabled researchers to push beyond the abovementioned hurdles to achieve the important breakthroughs highlighted in this review. In order to keep the length of this review to a manageable level, only the synthesis and chemistry of π-conjugated systems bearing the heaviest members of the main group (see Chart 1) will be discussed; we will also focus our discussions on compounds that show promising optoelectronic properties. Those interested in learning more about the novel bonding arrangements and reactivity associated with inorganic π-structures, such as heavy element analogues of alkenes,18–20 alkynes,21,22 and benzene23,24 are referred to the excellent review articles that are found in the literature.

Group 13 heterocycles
The incorporation of electron deficient three-coordinate boron centers within extended π-frameworks has led to the development of structurally unique molecules and macromolecules with high Lewis acidities,25,26 color tunable luminescence,27–29 and analyte sensing capabilities.30,31 The corresponding heavier triel element (Al, Ga, In and Tl)-containing congeners have been less explored due to the relative scarcity of known preparative strategies. Fortunately there has been considerable recent progress in this field including the ability to gain access to phosphorescent materials due to increased spin–orbit coupling within heavier elements, which facilitates mixing of singlet and triplet excited states.
Gallium
In 1995, Cowley et al. reported the synthesis of the highly moisture-sensitive gallafluorene and indafluorene (1 and 2) which contained the kinetically stabilizing 2,4,6-tBu3C6H2 (Mes*) group at the respective heteroatom (Fig. 1).32 Following a similar strategy as used to prepare borafluorenes25,26,33,34 these Ga and In heterofluorenes were prepared by a general salt elimination reaction between 2,2′-dilithiobiphenyl and Mes*ECl2 (E = Ga and In). The molecular structure of 1 was determined by X-ray crystallography, however no supporting optical or electrochemical studies were reported for either species.
 Fig. 1  Original gallafluorene and indafluorene prepared by Cowley and coworkers. 
A significant advance in the field of gallium heterocycles emerged in 2013 when a series of gallafluorenes (3–8) were prepared by the Chujo group (Scheme 1).35,36 In order to achieve enhanced stability to water, a modified Mes*-type ligand (Mamx) was employed, wherein an ortho-tert-butyl group was replaced by a coordinating –CH2NMe2 unit. Several Mamx gallafluorene derivatives were synthesized according to the salt elimination/post Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling protocol shown in Scheme 1. Emission in the near UV (λem = 369 nm; ϕ < 0.01) was noted for the parent gallafluorene 3 while the π-extended congeners 5–8 displayed slightly red-shifted emission (λem in the range of 385 to 395 nm) and increased quantum yields (ϕ = 0.29–0.36). These species adopt four-coordinate Ga environments in the solid state as determined by X-ray crystallography. Addition of the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 into solutions of the gallafluorenes 3 and 5–8 afforded new products with red-shifted emission luminescence in comparison to the borane-free gallafluorenes [e.g. λem = 575 nm for 3·B(C6F5)3; λem = 635–684 nm for 5–8·B(C6F5)3, respectively]. Furthermore these B(C6F5)3 adducts have significantly longer emission lifetimes of up to 1.33 μs vs. <5 ns for the uncomplexed gallafluorenes; thus visible phosphorescence could be turned on by coordinating B(C6F5)3 to a –CH2NMe2 group within the Mamx ligand scaffold. Under low concentrations of 3 and B(C6F5)3 the phosphorescence emission peak at 575 nm disappeared, indicating that the Mamx-B(C6F5)3 coordinative interaction is reversible in nature. As expected, introduction of oxygen to 3·B(C6F5)3 resulted in the disappearance of the 575 nm band due to O2-triggered phosphorescence quenching.37 The wavelength of phosphorescence could be shifted even further towards the near IR spectral region by incorporating more electron-donating the substituents about the periphery of the gallafluorene unit (e.g. λem for 7·B(C6F5)3 = 684 nm).35

Chujo et al. expanded on their previous studies to obtain stable gallafluorene polymers.38 It was found that monomer 4 could participate in various palladium-catalyzed C–C bond-forming protocols including Suzuki–Miyaura, Stille, and Sonogashira cross-coupling (Scheme 2). As a result, these methods could each be used to gain access to copolymers featuring Mamx-functionalized gallafluorene repeat units in combination with a wide range of different π-conjugated comonomers. Despite the low number of repeating units in these first generation polymers (e.g. 6–13) many of these Ga-containing polymers exhibited impressive thermal stability (up to 300 °C in air). Furthermore color tunable photoluminescence that ranged from UV to visible red emission was possible for polymers 9–15 shown in Scheme 2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of these gallafluorene polymers identified higher lying HOMO and LUMO levels in comparison to their carbon-based analogues,39–42 suggesting that these novel gallafluorene polymers could be used as hole transport materials. Band gap narrowing via lowering of LUMO levels was possible by incorporating electron deficient benzotriazole (14) and benzothiadiazole (15) units to yield donor–acceptor motifs, thus opening the door for possible solar cell applications. By judicious choice of ligand/base for cross-coupling polymerization, it is expected that higher molecular weight materials could be prepared in the near future.

Indium
Early examples of well-characterized indium heterocycles (Fig. 2) were made by Peppe and Tuck who reported the synthesis of the pyridine (pyr) adduct Ph4C4InCl·pyr (16) as well as a [Ph4As]+ salt of the anionic spirocycle {[Ph4C4]2In}− (17);43 the optoelectronic properties of these interesting heterocycles have yet to be examined.
 Fig. 2  First well-characterized indium heterocycles reported by Peppe and Tuck. 
The Chujo group built upon their initial gallafluorene studies outlined in Schemes 1 and 2 to include four-coordinate boron-, aluminum- and indium-based heterofluorenes containing the Mamx ligand (Fig. 3).44 Planar arrangements were found in each heterofluorene substructure with UV-vis spectroscopy revealing similar λmax (ca. 280 nm) and molar extinction coefficients (ε = 7.9 to 8.9 × 103 M−1 cm−1) in each species. TD-DFT calculations revealed that the 280 nm absorptions arose from π–π* transitions within a biphenyl unit, and thus are not significantly influenced by the nature of the heteroatom present. Comparative photoluminescence studies of the B, Al, Ga and In analogues were made at both room temperature and at 77 K. At room temperature the B, Al, and Ga heterofluorenes (18, 19, and 3) exhibited near UV fluorescence centered at 360 nm with emission lifetimes (τ) of less than 5 ns; the In congener (20) also yielded an additional phosphorescence-based emission band around 490 nm (τ > 50 μs) that was quenched in air. Upon cooling compounds 3, 18–20 to 77 K in 2-MeTHF, emission bands at ca. 330 and 480–490 nm were found in each case. The authors also noted that the proportion of phosphorescence in relation to the total light emitted increased within the heavier Group 13 heteroles, and correlated with the larger spin–orbit coupling constants ζ on going from B to Al to Ga to In (10 to 62 to 464 to 1183 cm−1),45 thus phosphorescence was modulated by the heavy atom effect.

Group 14 element heterocycles
Since the establishment of the field of organoelectronics, many have sought to prepare heavier Group 14 element analogues to gain a deeper understanding of aromaticity and to obtain potentially advantageous optoelectronic properties. Perhaps the most well-studied Group 14 element based heterocycles are five-membered siloles. Initial motivation for examining these species was to determine if significant Si–R σ*/CC π* orbital mixing could transpire to lower the LUMO state and the overall electronic band gap in relation to organic cyclopentadienes.46 While both monomeric and polymeric siloles (and their structural analogues) are still being explored as viable constructs for photovoltaic and TFT applications47–49 there has been a surge in interest in arylated siloles, such as hexaphenylsilole Ph4C4SiPh2, due to their ability to show aggregation-induced emission (AIE) of visible light. In AIE, molecular rotations that normally facilitate non-radiative decay in the excited state are suppressed by the aggregation-induced restriction of molecular motion.50 Accordingly a large number of silole analogues have been prepared for applications such as LED development, two-photon bioimaging and the sensing of analytes.50–53 Herein we will describe key advances in the domain of formally conjugated heterocycles containing Ge, Sn and Pb.
Germanium
The presence of germanium in optoelectronic devices dates back to its use in first-generation transistors. More recent studies have focused on incorporating germanium within potentially conjugated frameworks for optoelectronic applications ranging from the development of polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) and light-emitting materials. The most commonly studied molecular group within the field of Ge heterocycles are five-membered germoles such as the prototypical species hexaphenylgermole Ph2GeC4Ph4. A driving force behind studying these materials is to take advantage of possible σ*–π* mixing within these heterocycles leading to lower LUMO states;54 aggregation-induced emission from germoles was also reported by Braddock-Wilking and coworkers.55 Recent work on germoles and their ring-fused analogues will be covered below with topic grouping arranged according to the noted optoelectronic properties, due to the large size of this research domain.
Bulk heterojunction solar cells
As mentioned, many have sought to incorporate inorganic elements within photovoltaically active polymers to gain access to potentially lower optical band gaps, enhanced light absorption, and improved charge carrier mobilities.1 One successful way to achieve narrower electronic band gaps is a donor–acceptor approach which places electron-rich and electron-poor heterocycles in an alternating fashion along a polymer backbone,56 with fused germanium-containing heterocycles often acting as electron-donors.9 Accordingly there has been a flurry of activity over the past several years to incorporate ring-fused germoles into polymers as the electron-donors, as will be discussed below.
The most widely studied germanium-based π-conjugated framework in BHJSCs is dithienogermole, which has been copolymerized with a wide range of electron-deficient monomers (Fig. 4; 21–41).57–72 The dithienogermole-containing polymers (21–41) are generally obtained by metal-catalyzed cross-coupling methodologies such as the Stille, Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira reactions, and very high number average molecular weights (Mn) of up to 133000 g mol−1 have been occasionally reported. Due to d-block contraction,73,74 the electronegativity of germanium is slightly closer to carbon than the related silicon species,75 therefore reducing the polarization of the Ge–C bond and rendering aryl germanes more tolerable towards bases and nucleophiles than the related aryl silanes.76,77 This in turn allows for the utilization of Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling protocol while avoiding toxic tin-based Stille cross-coupling, enabling much deeper investigation into these germole-containing polymers. While various dithienogermoles have been incorporated in solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) ranging from 0.18% to 8.2% (Table 1, entries 1–21), it should be stated that Reynolds, So and coworkers were the first to incorporate a polydithienogermole (23) into a BHJ solar cell (in 2011).57 The same team also conducted further device optimizations leading to a record PCE in this subfield of 8.2% for 23 (Table 1, entry 3) when thicker active layers comprised of the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor (PC71BM) were used.58 Related high performing devices were achieved by Heeney, Fei, Chochos and coworkers67 including the dithienogermole–azabenzothiadiazole copolymer 37 which yielded a PCE value of 6.6% (Table 1, entry 17). Similarly, Hou and coworkers72 fabricated a device based on the dithienogermole–benzoselenodiazole copolymer 40 that provided a PCE of 6.3% (Table 1, entry 20). It should be mentioned that the devices mentioned in entries 3, 17 and 20 in Table 1 all utilized the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) which typically helps reduce the phase separation between the electron-donor (the germanium-containing polymers) and the electron-accepting the fullerenes, PC70BM or PC71BM.57,78 Heeney and coworkers69 prepared a functional BHJSC utilizing 30 that was able to achieve a modest PCE of 5.5% (Table 1, entry 10), which was the highest efficiency found without the use of any additives for these dithienogermoles.

In order to potentially capture more incident photons in the near IR region by narrowing the polymer band gap, Heeney and coworkers79,80 prepared extended ring-fused electron-donor cores comprised of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene heterocyclic units bridged by –GeR2– residues, and copolymerized these dithienogermolodithiophene units with a variety of electron-acceptors to yield copolymers 42–47 (Fig. 4). These polymers had molecular weights ranging from 10000 to 75000 g mol−1 and PCEs spanning from 0.8% to a value of 7.2% for 42 (Table 1, entries 22–27); each device was fabricated without additives. Heeney and coworkers also developed a novel germaindacenodithiophene building block to synthesize the benzothiadiazole copolymer 48.81 Later Ashraf, Schroeder and coworkers82 were able to increase the efficiency of additive-free devices featuring high molecular weight 48 (Mn = 37000 g mol−1) to yield a PCE of 6.5% (Table 1, entry 28). The Heeney group also developed devices utilizing an analogous polymer with a more electron-rich diselenogermole core (49; Fig. 4), however despite the high molecular weight of the material (41000 g mol−1), a slightly reduced PCE of 5.2% was found when using DIO as an additive (Table 1, entry 29).26 This study highlights a common challenge in the field, which is the role of morphological/interfacing effects in dictating BHJSC performance.83 In 2014, Cheng and coworkers introduced a new dithienogermolocarbazole unit to the area, and the reported copolymers 50–53 (Fig. 4) also gave moderate PCE values of up to 4.5% (Table 1, entries 30–33).84
Ohshita and coworkers have explored in depth the influence of dithienogermole repeat units on solar cell device performance, and in one study they incorporated two of these frameworks into every repeat unit to make polymers 54 and 55 (Fig. 4).85 Unfortunately, polymer 54 was not soluble enough to enable molecular weight characterization by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), however 55 was obtained with a Mn of 13000 g mol−1 (polydispersity index, PDI = 1.2). Despite the enhanced solubility of 55, this polymer afforded a device with a much lower PCE value (0.9%) in comparison to its less soluble counterpart 54 (PCE = 4.3%; Table 1, entries 34 and 35). The same group also prepared alkyl-functionalized dithienogermole homopolymers (56 and 57; Fig. 4) with high molecular weights via Stille coupling (Mn = 46000 and 79000 g mol−1, respectively), although their performances in BHJSC architectures was modest (PCE = 1.7 and 1.3%, respectively; Table 1, entries 36 and 37).64
The Leclerc group has had a key role in advancing the use of germanium-containing polymers for optoelectronic applications86 beginning with the development of a series of polymers (58–60; Fig. 4) containing electron-rich germafluorene units. These polymers were obtained with number average molecular weights (Mn) in the range of 10000–13000 g mol−1 and moderate PCE values for solar cells devices from 1.2 to 2.8% in the absence of any additives. Germafluorenes also show stable blue light emission for LED applications, and more detail on this growing field will be provided later in this review.
Transistors and semi-conducting materials
While germanium-containing π-materials have been extensively explored as donor-materials in BHJSCs, the use of germanium heterocycles within thin film transistors (TFTs) has been less studied with recent examples outlined in Table 2.63,69,85–90 The previously mentioned polymer 21 originally synthesized by Heeney and coworkers was also examined as a component of TFTs with a promising mobility of 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 noted.87 Similarly, the previously described dithienogermole and germafluorene copolymers 54–60 (Fig. 4) were also incorporated into TFT devices (Table 2, entries 2–8), however in each case relatively low mobilities were noted, with 58 having the highest value at 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 amongst the series (with a notably high on/off ratio of ca. 1 × 106).64,85,86

Several other germanium-containing polymers were also investigated for TFT applications (Fig. 5; polymers 61–69). For example, Heeney et al.91 developed the dithienogermole–bithiophene copolymers 61 and 62, however both materials displayed low mobilities when incorporated into devices (3.2 × 10−4 and 4.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; Table 2, entries 9 and 10). Reynolds and coworkers88 later showed that the dithienogermole–benzothiadiazole copolymer 63 afforded a TFT with a promising mobility of 0.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a high on/off ratio near 106 (Table 2, entry 11). Heeney and coworkers89 also studied the dithienogermole-containing polymers 64 and 65 as components of TFTs. Polymers with dithienogermolodithiophene repeat units (66–69) were also tested in TFTs (Table 2, entries 14–17),90 with occasionally high mobilities recorded (e.g. 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 69).

Light emitting materials
In important early work in this field Tamao and coworkers synthesized the germole 70 according to the multi-step procedure outlined in Scheme 3.73 In the initial step of the procedure, cyclization of a thiophene-capped diyne with Negishi's reagent (“Cp2Zr”; prepared from Cp2ZrCl2 and two equiv. of nBuLi)95 afforded a five membered zirconacycle; this species subsequently underwent Zr/Ge atom exchange with Et2GeCl2 to yield the target germole. Compound 70 absorbs maximally at 405 nm, while blue fluorescence was found with an emission maximum (λem) at 479 nm (relative quantum yield ϕ = 8.7%). The Tilley group also prepared a series of germoles (71–73) (Scheme 3)96 using the thermally stable “Cp2Zr” source [Cp2Zr(Me3SiCCSiMe3)(pyr)].97 The halogen-capped germoles 71 and 72 (Scheme 3) could be polymerized to yield the polymer 74via nickel-mediated homocoupling.96 The monomeric germoles 71–73 absorbed light maximally in the narrow spectral range of 364–376 nm, while similar blue light emission as in Tamao's compound 70 was noted [λem = 452 to 464 nm; relative quantum yields of 8, 12 and 18% for 71, 72 and 73, respectively]. Polymer 74 was also obtained with three different Mn values of 1900, 4700 and 20000 g mol−1 and, as expected, the highest molecular weight material afforded the most red-shifted absorption (λmax = 442 nm) and emission (λem = 500 nm) consistent with enhanced heterocycle coplanarity/conjugation; notably, the highest relative quantum yield (ϕ = 79%) was found with the polymer of Mn = 20000 g mol−1.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of the germoles 71–73 and the polydiarylgermole 74. 
Mullin and coworkers98 studied hexaphenylgermole, Ph2GeC4Ph475, and noted aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) in the blue spectral region (λem at 487 nm) in the solid state when irradiated at ca. 357 nm. In line with the AEE effect, the quantum yield of 75 increased from a value of ca. 1% in solution to 10% in the solid state. A related effect was noted by Tang and coworkers in their poly(phenylenesilole)s.99,100
In 2010 Yamanoi, Nishihara and coworkers101 were able to synthesize a series of eight germafluorenes (76–83) and one dithienogermole (84) that were all blue luminescent at room temperature (λem = 345 to 420 nm) when excited with near UV-vis light (285 to 340 nm) (Fig. 6). The highest quantum yield was found with the dithienogermole 84 with a relative quantum yield of 34% (vs. anthracene as a standard). In a related study by Ohshita and coworkers102 the dipyridinogermole 85 was prepared by treating 2,2′-dilithio-4,4′-bipyridyl with Ph2GeCl2. This compound was found to have a λmax at 269 nm and discernable blue fluorescence at 400 nm with a corresponding quantum yield of less than 2%, as determined using an integrating sphere.
 Fig. 6  Structures of 76–85. 
One strategy being explored in the field of luminescent fluorenes and their heavier element congeners is to fuse two fluorenyl units to afford spirocyclic arrangements (Scheme 4); the goal is to possibly improve the thermal stability and solubility of these materials for LED fabrication.103 Accordingly the Ohshita group prepared the spirobi(dithienogermole) 86 (Fig. 7) and this species was found to have a similar absorption profile (λmax at 358 nm) as the corresponding monocyclic dithienogermoles, suggesting a lack of substantial electronic communication between the fused dithienogermole rings. This compound was also photoluminescent (λem = 421 nm; ϕ = 0.09) and showed thermal stability above 300 °C.104 In related work, Adachi, Yasuda and coworkers synthesized the π-extended dithienogermole 87 and found red-shifted absorption (λmax = 401 nm) and emission (λem at 483 nm) relative to the spirocycle 86.105 Compound 87 was also incorporated into an OLED device with an overall device efficiency for blue electroluminescence of 3.4%. In addition to several germanium-substituted dithienogermoles (88–91), a number of oxo-bridged dithienogermole tetramers were also synthesized by the Ohshita group (92–94, Fig. 7) and a photoluminescent quantum yield of 80% (λem = 482 nm) was noted in one analogue (94).106

The Rivard group also prepared a series of spirocyclic germafluorene–germoles (SGGs; 95–98) with the assistance of zirconium-mediated alkyne coupling, followed by Zr/Ge metathesis chemistry (Scheme 5).107 Spirocyclic functionality was introduced by reacting dihalogermoles (Scheme 5) with dilithiobiphenyl analogues, and the resulting products exhibited color tunable luminescence: blue emission possible from the germafluorene units, while orange aggregation-induced emission (AIE) was possible from the tetraarylated germole units (e.g. in 96). In addition the thiophene-capped SGGs have substantial photoluminescence stability in air, making this a promising structural class for use in non-encapsulated LEDs. The authors also reported that the functionalized SGG 99 can undergo post-functionalization by Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling (Scheme 6) to yield 100 and other π-extended frameworks.107

Seferos and coworkers studied the photoluminescent properties of the previously mentioned dithienogermole–benzochalcogenodiazole copolymers 21 and 41 (Fig. 4).108 Polymer 21 was found to exhibit two visible light absorptions at 405 and 662 nm, while near IR emission was found at λem = 730 nm. The related benzoselenodiazole polymer 41 exhibited red-shifted absorption (λmax = 422 and 694 nm) and emission profiles (λem = 795 nm). It would be interesting to see the effect of incorporating tellurium into these polymeric structures and if phosphorescence in the IR spectral region could be achieved; this is a highly sought property for bioimaging applications where interference with background absorption would be minimized.109 In a recent study, Uhl, Würthwein and coworkers reported the synthesis and photoluminescent properties of the germacyclobutenes 101–106 (Fig. 8).110 Upon excitation of 103 at ca. 265 nm, deep blue fluorescence in the solid state and solution was noted.

Tin
The first report of heavy Group 14 and 15 cyclopentadienyl analogues was by Leavitt, Manuel, and Johnson in 1959.111 Starting from dilithiotetraphenylbutadiene, they performed condensation reactions with PhxECl2 (E = P, As, Sb, Ge, or Sn; x = 1 or 2) to generate the corresponding heteroles (PhxEC4Ph4). In 1960 the first dibenzostannoles (107 and 108) were synthesized from the reaction of dilitihiobiphenyl with Ph2SnCl2 and Et2SnCl2, respectively (Scheme 7).112
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of the stannafluorenes 107 and 108 by salt elimination. 
One versatile method for the construction of electron deficient heterofluorenes is co-condensation of fluorinated dilithiobiphenyls with element dihalides (Scheme 8); one caveat is that lithiated fluoroaromatics need to be handled with care and at low temperatures due to possibly violent decomposition instigated by LiF elimination/benzyne formation.113 Using this approach Tilley et al. prepared a number of structurally related Si, S, P, Ge and Sn-containing heterofluorenes and studied their optoelectronic properties in detail.114 Of note for this current review, the stannafluorenes (109 and 110; Scheme 8) were prepared according to a general procedure developed previously by Cohen and coworkers.115,116 While compound 109 was non-emissive, placement of phenylethynyl (–CCPh) substituents at the 2- and 7-positions of the stannafluorene ring (to give 110) resulted in a red-shift in the absorption from 309 nm in 109 to 350 and 363 nm for 110, consistent with an increase in the extent of conjugation. In addition compound 110 yields blue-colored fluorescence both in solution (THF: λem = 389 and 410 nm) and in the solid state (λem = 485 nm).
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of the perfluorostannafluorenes 109 and 110. 
The Saito group reported the synthesis of triphenylenes containing externally bridging S, Si and Sn heteroatoms (111–113; Scheme 9).117 In each case the heteroatom was installed by initially lithiating acidic positions about the triphenylene scaffold with an nBuLi/TMEDA (TMEDA = tetramethylethylenediamine) combination, followed by addition of the element dihalides SCl2, Me2SiCl2 and Me2SnCl2. The Si and Sn analogues (112 and 113) have nearly identical absorbance spectra, and accordingly, computations indicate no orbital participation from the Si or Sn atoms to the HOMO and LUMO states. Building upon this work, Saito and coworkers reported the synthesis of a series of Group 14 element heterosumanenes in 2012 (Fig. 9).118 Each fused polycycle exhibited strong UV light absorption from 250 to 290 nm, while the stannole derivatives (116, 118 and 120) showed broad emission maxima at 370 nm, corresponding to violet-blue emission; the Si and Ge analogues also showed photoluminescence at 350 to 385 nm in solution.

The dithienostannole structural isomers (121 and 122; Fig. 10) were each synthesized in 2009 by Saito.119 Each compound was characterized by X-ray crystallography however no further comparative study on their optoelectronic properties has been reported to date; Shimizu and coworkers also reported the dibenzothienostannole 123 in 2009.120
 Fig. 10  Dithienostannole structural isomers (121 and 122) and the di(benzo[b]-thieno)stannole 123. 
The Ohshita group has extensively explored bithiophenes as active components of conjugated materials, and in 2013 they prepared 1,1-diphenyl-3,6-bis(trimethylsilyl)dithienostannole (124) and di(benzo[b]-thieno)-1,1-diphenylstannole (125) (Fig. 11).121 These fused heterocycles were synthesized from the reaction of the corresponding dilithiodithiophene and dilithiodibenzo[b]-thiophenes with Ph2SnCl2. Compound 125 displayed blue photoluminescence when excited with 350 nm light in THF (λem = 410 nm) or when irradiated in crystalline form (λem = 422 nm); similar emission profiles were noted for 125. Most interestingly, 125 exhibited crystallization-enhanced emission as a drastic increase in quantum yield was observed in the crystalline state (ϕ = 56%) relative to in THF solution (ϕ = 0.9%) or when 125 was deposited as an amorphous film (ϕ = 2.8%). This effect was not observed for 124 as the measured ϕ was comparable both in solution and in the crystalline state (29% in THF and 21% in the crystalline state). Analysis of the crystal structures of 124 and 125 gives some insight as to the source of the crystalline-induced emission in 125. In compound 125 the only significant intermolecular interaction is π–π stacking between the phenyl groups, which was shown by computations to have a negligible contribution to emission. However 124 has notable π–π stacking interactions within 3.8 Å between the dithienostannole rings leading to some aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ).

In 2014, Staubitz and coworkers developed a selective Stille coupling procedure that enabled the preparation of the first high molecular weight polystannole.122 The authors initially examined a series of thiophene-capped stannole model complexes (126–128 in Scheme 10) and found that 127, with Sn-phenyl linkages, was the most stable towards Stille coupling conditions. This led to the design of 129 as a possible monomer for polymerization via Stille coupling. Co-polymerization of 129 with bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene yielded selective Stille coupling to form the air- and moisture-stable thiophene–stannole copolymer 130 as a dark purple solid in high molecular weight (Mw = 17.0 kDa) (Scheme 10). The UV-vis spectrum of 130 in chloroform showed a broad absorption peak at 536 nm, which was significantly red-shifted in comparison to the monomer 129 (λmax = 441 nm). In addition the presence of stannole repeat units led to significant red-shifting of the absorption in relation to regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (λmax = 450 nm).122 Spin-coated films of 130 displayed a further red-shift in λmax. to 585 nm due to enhanced thiophene–stannole ring co-planarity in the solid state. Luminescence measurements on 130 revealed extremely weak emission at 540 and 630 nm. The authors also estimated a band gap of 1.7 eV for 130 in the film state from the onset energy of light absorption, suggesting that these materials could be used in photovoltaic applications.

In a recent paper by the Jäkle group, the planar chiral dimethyl tin-bridged biferrocene (131; Fig. 12) was prepared, and it was found that step-wise oxidation of the two Fe(II) centers to Fe(III) sites was possible.123 Of note the mono-oxidized mixed valent Fe(II)/Fe(III) compound showed an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band in the near IR spectrum suggesting that electronic coupling between iron centers was occurring in solution. The authors mention a possible use of the oxidized analogues of 131 as redox-switchable chiral cations.
 Fig. 12  Tin-bridged biferrocenes with their respective neutral and cationic forms. 
Lead
The incorporation of lead within possibly π-conjugated heterocycles is more challenging than the lighter analogues due to the increased lability of Pb–C bonds, leading to the common extrusion of lead metal from target cyclic species. Despite this inherent challenge, van Beelen and coworkers succeeded in isolating the air- and moisture-stable 1,1-dimethyl-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylplumbole (134) in 1978 from the reaction of dilithiotetraphenylbutadiene with Me2PbBr2Scheme 11.124 When this dilithiatedbutadiene was combined with PbCl2, disproportionation occurred to yield a spiroplumbole (with Pb(IV) centers) and presumably lead metal. Soon after, the same group prepared a series of benzoplumboles and spiro-cycles (133–152; Scheme 11).125,126
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of arylated plumbole and spiroplumboles by van Beelen. 
The first crystallographic structure determinations of plumboles appeared in a 2010 study by Saito.127 In this report, both the structures of hexaphenylplumbole Ph2PbC4Ph4 (137) as well as its spiro analogue Pb(C4Ph4)2 (133) were determined; the general synthetic route used by the Saito group followed prior chemistry outlined by van Beelen et al. (Scheme 11).124,125 As noted in other Group 14 metalloles, the absorption spectra for the hexaphenylplumbole (137) and the spiro-analogue (133) are similar to those reported the lighter Ph2EC4Ph4 heterocycles (E = Si, Ge or Sn).128 This observation has been linked to light absorption stemming from π–π* transitions that are localized primarily within the butadiene moieties. Interestingly each of the reported plumboles by Saito showed photoluminescence at room temperature with emission maxima (λem) at 394 nm (137) and 404 nm (133). These λem values are significantly blue-shifted from those noted in the lighter element congeners (Si, Ge and Sn) where λem values fall in the narrow range of 486–496 nm (in acetonitrile);128 it is unclear at this stage why blue-shifted emission maxima occur within these plumboles.
Group 15 heterocycles
The field of Group 15 element-containing π-conjugated materials is dominated by the lightest members of the series, nitrogen and phosphorus. The number of conjugated materials based upon the isolobal substitution of CH for N (e.g. benzene to pyridine) is vast and a discussion of the full impact of these important materials lies outside of the scope of this review. Briefly it is salient to cite some important review articles on phosphole and phosphabenzene chemistry,129,130 including articles which describe the recent use of phosphole derivatives and their phosphine oxide analogues as light-emitting materials,131 and as supports for metal-mediated catalysis.132,133 As synthetic inorganic chemistry continues to grow as a field, new examples of heterocycles featuring arsenic, antimony and bismuth are surfacing in an increasingly frequent manner.134
Arsenic
Not surprisingly researchers have largely shied away from exploring the chemistry of this toxic element, however as will be seen, improvements in synthetic approaches have mitigated some of the pre-existing issues in this regard.
Braye et al. reported the synthesis of pentaphenylarsole PhAsC4Ph4 from the condensation reaction between 1,4-dilithio-teraphenyl-1,3-butadiene and PhAsCl2 in 1961.135 The product was described as a yellow-green solid and fluorescent behavior was noted in this early report. Another efficient route to a prototypical arsenic-heterocycle (154) was reported by Fagan and Nugent in a landmark paper136 (Scheme 12) wherein the readily accessible zirconacycle precursor Cp2ZrC4Me4 (153) was combined with PhAsCl2 to instigate Zr/As atom exchange and form the air-stable arsole PhAsC4Me4 (154). Notably, this metallacycle transfer/atom exchange reaction can be extended to include most elements from the p-block.136 While both of these methods provide formally 6π electron containing arsenic heterocycles in good yield, the use of volatile arsenic reagents is not ideal due to their known toxicity.
 Scheme 12  Fagan and Nugent synthesis of an As-heterocycle via metallacycle transfer. 
Recently the Naka group prepared a series of fluorescent 2,5-diarylarsoles from the reaction of in situ generated PhAsI2 with titanacyclopentadienes (Scheme 13).137 The authors highlight the importance of being able to conduct the synthesis without the use of volatile arsenic starting materials. Optical measurements revealed that the introduction of an arsenic atom in place of phosphorus did not significantly change the emission wavelength in chloroform solution; however a blue-shift of the emission in the solid state by about 20 nm (λem = 482 nm for 155, 485 nm for 156) in comparison to the known phosphole analogue (λem = 504 nm) was observed. Notably the arsenic-based heterocycles 155 and 156 are also more stable in the presence of oxygen in comparison to the corresponding phospholes. One possible explanation for this observation is the expected increase in s-character of the lone pair at As in relation to P, leading to an increased reluctance of arsenic to undergo oxidation. It was also found that 155 and 156 both form the stable 1:1 adducts with AuCl, 160 and 161, respectively (Scheme 13). Upon binding gold, an increase of the overall quantum yield of the arsoles in chloroform solution was found (up to a value of 86% for 160) as well as a 20–40 nm red-shift in emission in both solution and the solid state.
 Scheme 13  Synthesis of 2,5-diarylarsoles via metallacycle transfer. 
Following up on their previous work, Naka and coworkers reported the further functionalization of their arsenic-based metalloles via Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling (Scheme 13) to yield the biphenyl-capped species 162 and 163.138 This reaction highlights a main advantage of these As-heterocycles as their lighter phosphole congeners tend to poison the catalytic activity of the Pd complexes required for cross-coupling. A bathochromic shift in both the absorbance and emission of the arsoles transpires when electron-donating groups are positioned on the thiophene rings (e.g. λem = 548 nm for 159vs. 458 nm for the parent system 155), as well as a corresponding increase in the energy of the HOMO (−4.67 eV for 159vs. −5.59 eV for 155). Interestingly, it was noticed that the emission colors of these arsenic heterocycles could be modified by mechanical stimuli such as grinding. A hypsochromic shift by about 10 nm was observed for compounds 155, 156, 157, and 159 upon grinding, while this hypsochromic shift was more pronounced for 158 (ca. 50 nm).
A recent paper by Heeney et al. reported the synthesis of the first example of a dithienoarsole-containing polymer, 166.139 The synthesis was based on Stille cross-coupling polymerization as shown in Scheme 14. Using a different approach than Naka and coworkers, PhAsCl2 was first generated in situ from phenylarsonic acid PhAsO3H2 and then reacted with a dodecyl-functionalized dilithiated bithiophene to form the required arsenic heterocycle 164. Compound 164 was then brominated to give the air-stable monomer 165 (Scheme 14) which then was co-polymerized with trans-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethene to yield 166 as a dark blue polymer. Calculations on a trimeric model of 166 indicate a highly planar backbone with very little twisting (less than 1°) between the dithienylarsole units and the adjacent olefinic spacers.
 Scheme 14  Synthesis of the dithienoarsole polymer 166. 
Antimony
In 2012, Ohshita et al. reported the synthesis and characterization of the first dithienylstiboles (Scheme 15).140 Three variants were made (167–169) which demonstrated emission maxima ranging from 420 nm to 443 nm but with recorded quantum yields of only 1–2% in chloroform. The solid state emission spectrum for 169 afforded a notable red-shift in emission maxima by about 30 nm, suggesting that packing effects influenced the wavelength of emission. The stiboles were stable to ambient conditions, but decomposed upon continuous UV irradiation for one hour. In the case of 169 small amounts of naphthalene and bis(benzo[b]-thiophene) were detected after decomposition, suggesting that Sb–C bond scission was leading to loss of antimony metal upon irradiation. The authors also conducted DFT calculations to compare the HOMO and LUMO energies of dithienometalloles containing S, Sb, or Bi and found that the resulting computed energy levels remained largely invariant to the nature of the heteroatom present.

Bismuth
In 2006, Chujo and coworkers successfully prepared the polybismole 177, the first well-defined polymer containing bismuth as an integral (main chain) component.141,142 Incorporation of bismuth into a polymer was accomplished in the final step of a series of post-polymerization modification reactions outlined in Scheme 16. To begin, the polydiyne 174 was synthesized by Sonogashira coupling; the use of end-capping agents was used to control the resulting molecular weights and engender solubility for subsequent reaction chemistry. With the polydiyne 174 in hand, the authors conducted zirconium-mediated cyclization of the alkyne units to form the air- and moisture-sensitive polyzirconacycle 175. This metallopolymer was treated with I2 to extrude Cp2ZrI2 and yield a stable polydiiodobutadiene 176, which was lithiated and subsequently reacted with PhBiBr2 to form the target bismole–arene polymer 177. Polymer 177 displayed photoluminescence with λem = 440 nm (λex = 310 nm) in CH2Cl2 and a quantum efficiency approaching 13%. The authors did not comment on whether or not photoluminescence was possible for 177 in the solid state. The nature of the luminescence of 177 in CH2Cl2 remains to be confirmed as no lifetime measurements were taken, however the small Stokes shift noted suggests that the emission is fluorescence-based.

Following a pre-established synthetic route for yielding antimony-containing heterocycles, Ohshita and coworkers prepared a series of dithienylbismoles 170–173 (Scheme 15).143 The optical data for these fused heterocycles were similar to known silole analogues47,144 with DFT studies revealing minimal participation from Bi to the HOMO states. Compounds 170–173 exhibited red photoluminescence in CHCl3 with a sharp band at ca. 400 nm accompanied by a broad emission peak from 600–640 nm that was assigned to phosphorescence; in line with this postulate, the long wavelength emission was quenched in the presence of oxygen. In addition, self-quenching of phosphorescence (triplet–triplet annihilation) occurred in the solid state for the relatively planar bismoles 170 and 173, while some phosphorescence was preserved in the –SiMe3 capped heterocycles 171 and 172 (albeit with ϕ values below 0.2%). In the case of these silylated dithienobismoles, it is likely that close intermolecular contacts are suppressed by the presence of hindered –SiMe3 groups, thus preventing complete triplet–triplet annihilation.
Group 16 heterocycles
Selenium
In the domain of Se-containing π-conjugated materials, five-membered selenophenes have dominated the landscape. The seminal work by Bendikov has had a large effect on the overall experimental and theoretical understanding of selenophene polymers and oligomers, with their research laying the foundation for further explorations in this field.145 Recently the Seferos group has published a review on the incorporation of selenophenes into electronic materials.146 Herein we will describe developments of selenium-containing π-conjugated materials with optoelectronic applications that have emerged since Seferos' review.
Zhang and Qin synthesized two selenium-containing polymers with vinyl linkages, one containing only selenophene linkers (178) and one with randomly co-polymerized selenophene and thiophene functionalities (179).147 They gained entry to these interesting materials by subjecting the reactive monomer, 3-decyl-2,5-dipropenylselenophene, to acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization using Grubbs' 2nd generation catalyst in 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene at 90 °C. They also used dynamic vacuum to remove the 2-butene by-product as it formed, thus driving the reaction to completion (Scheme 17). Compound 178 was isolated in a 38% yield as a black solid, with an Mn of 14300 g mol−1 and polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.8. The random co-polymer (179) was obtained by exposing a mixture of selenophene and thiophene monomers to similar ADMET conditions as used to prepare 178. Co-polymer 179 displays red-shifted light absorption (λmax = 597 nm) when compared to a related thiophene–vinylene (λmax = 584 nm); as expected, 178 with entirely selenium-containing chalcogenophenes along the polymer backbone showed the most red-shifted absorption amongst the series with a λmax of 617 nm. It would be of interest to see if such polymers could yield luminescence.
 Scheme 17  Synthesis of 178 and 179via ADMET polymerization. 
Al-Hashimi, Heeney and coworkers reported the Stille co-polymerization of 2,5-dibromo-3-dodecylselenophene with E-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethylene to yield the vinylene–selenophene-containing co-polymer 181 (Scheme 18) in a 53% yield with an Mn of 12000 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.0).148 In line with prior studies in the field, progressive red-shifts in absorption were found when the heteroatom within the chalcogenophenes were changed from S to Se to Te with λmax values of 572 to 613 to 653 nm, respectively for thin films of each vinylene-copolymer 180 to 182. The charge carrier mobility of the selenophene analogue 181 was also investigated in conjunction with their use in TFTs. Polymer 181 was incorporated into three different device architectures, including bottom gate/top contact (BG/TC), bottom gate/bottom contact (BG/BC), and top gate/bottom contact (TG/BC) arrangements with field effect mobilities of 3.6 × 10−4, 0.02 and 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. The authors note that all polymers in this study (180, 181, and 182) were found to be p-type semiconductors and that the selenophene polymer consistently displayed the highest mobility across all devices.

Cheng and coworkers developed a series of tricyclic biselenophene based materials (Fig. 13).149 These species consisted of dibrominated-biselenophene frameworks in combination with either sp3-hybridized –ER2– linkages (E = Si or Ge; 183 and 184), a three-coordinate octylamine bridge (185), or unsaturated exocyclic (186 and 187) and endocyclic (188) linkers. These compounds were all found to be photoluminescent, with the diselenogermole 184 showing the longest wavelength of blue light emission (476 nm), unfortunately no quantum yields were determined for compounds 183–188. Due to the presence of polymerizable end-capping bromine substituents, these compounds represent promising building blocks for the fabrication of conjugated polymers. In this regard, Heeney and coworkers have incorporated diselenogermole donor-units into extended structures to yield polymers for BHJSC applications (vide supra).93

In 2015 Cheng et al. were able to form the regioregular selenophene-containing polymers 189 and 190via palladium catalyzed direct-arylation polymerization (Scheme 19).150 Polymer 189 could be prepared using either Pd(OAc)2 or NHC–Pd catalysts (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) starting from 2-bromo-3-hexylselenophene as a monomer. Under the conditions employed, it was found that polymer precipitation occurred readily leading to incomplete monomer conversions and polymer Mn values consistently below 9000 g mol−1. In an attempt to increase polymer solubility, the thiophene–selenophene copolymer 190 was prepared using related arylation polymerization (Scheme 19) and accordingly a higher molecular weight (Mn = 20000 g mol−1) was obtained due to decreased intermolecular interactions between the thiophene and selenophene repeat units. However incorporation of thiophene co-monomers in 190 led to a slight increase in optical band gap as reflected by UV-vis spectroscopy [λmax (film) = 550 nm in 190vs. 562 nm in 189; similar trends were noted in solution].
 Scheme 19  Direct arylation polymerization yield 189 and 190; Dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3. 
The Haley group have recently prepared the indacenediselenophene 191 and the diindenoselenophene 192 (Fig. 14).151 Compound 191 absorbs maximally at 577 nm, while the diindenoselenophene 192 displays vibronic features in the 350–500 nm region as well as another low energy absorption in the near IR at 675 nm. Both 191 and 192 are non-emissive as are related organic indenofluorenes.152
 Fig. 14  Structures of 191 and 192. 
A family of donor–acceptor copolymers (193–196) were prepared containing electron-rich fused anthradiselenophene units in combination with electron deficient repeat units (Ar1 and Ar2 in Fig. 15).94 These polymers were prepared in 50–60% yield via Stille cross-coupling, and in line with a common practice in the field, long alkyl chains were placed about the periphery of these polymers to engender optimal solubility for film formation. These polymers were also incorporated into organic field effect transistors (OFETs) with a bottom gate/top contact arrangement with SiO2 as the gate dielectric; each polymer was treated with Cl3Si–C18H37 to form a self-assembled monolayer and then thermally annealed at 200 °C. Low mobilities were noted (up to 1.0 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1), however excellent device on/off ratios approaching 108 (for 194) were found. Polymers 193–196 were also incorporated BHJSCs yielding PCE values of up to 4.4% [with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71NM/Ca/Al configuration].

Cabanetos, Blanchard and co-workers developed a selenophene (197) substituted at the 2- and 5-positions with an electron rich triphenylamine and an electron deficient dicyanovinyl group, respectively (Fig. 16).153 As is expected for a push–pull π-system, strong visible light absorption was noted (ε = 36800 M−1 cm−1) with a λmax in chloroform solution of 520 nm and a slightly red-shifted λmax of 535 nm in the film state. A bulk heterojunction solar cell was fabricated containing 197 with a promising open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.95 V, however the low fill factor (FF) of 0.39 led to a modest overall PCE of 3.3%. The authors note that further device optimization of morphology, additives and interfaces is currently underway.

The Seferos group was able to synthesize a series of platinum–bisacetylide chalcogenophene polymers (198–200).154 The selenium-containing polymer (199, Scheme 20) was accomplished via the initial synthesis of the silyl-capped 2,5-bisalkyneselenophene followed by in situ deprotection–dehydrohalogenation polymerization with trans-(Et3P)2PtCl2 to yield polymer 199 in a 47% yield with a Mn value of 30900 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.08). This selenium-containing polymer 199 is also photoluminescent with blue-light emission centered at 452 nm and a measured quantum yield of 0.32%.
 Scheme 20  Synthesis of polymers 198–200. 
Seferos and co-workers have developed two co-polymer substructures (201 and 202) by coupling a bis(stannylated)dithienogermole or a bis(stannylated)dithienosilole with dibromobenzoselenadiazole via Stille coupling (Scheme 21).71 These polymers were obtained with molecular weights (Mn) as high as 33000 g mol−1 and PDI values around 2.0. These benzoselenodiazole-co-polymers were then incorporated into BHJSCs with PC71BM as the acceptor material in the light harvesting/charge creation layer, with PCE values nearing 2.0% in unoptimized devices. The hole mobilities of 201 and 202 for undoped films were determined to be 1.53 × 10−4 and 4.55 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In related work, Seferos and coworkers prepared the selenophene-block copolymers 203 and 204 (Scheme 22); of note, polymer 203 was made by the direct polymer–polymer Stille coupling of pre-formed polyselenophene and polybenzobithiophene building blocks.155 Meanwhile 204 was formed as a statistical mixture by combining three different monomers segments using Stille cross-coupling (Scheme 22). Polymer 203 was prepared with differing block ratios, however the overall molecular weights were around 20000 g mol−1 and PDIs between 2.8–3.0; polymer 204 was prepared with a similar Mn of 19200 g mol−1 and a corresponding PDI of 2.2. These polymers were both incorporated into an inverted bulk heterojunction solar cell with the ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag configuration; all polymers were blended in a 1:1.5 ratio with PC71BM. For polymer 203, the molecular weight/amount of co-polymer blocks used did not have a significant effect on solar cell outputs (PCE values approximately 5.8%). Also the overall PCE was not significantly higher in 203 in comparison to the random co-polymer 204 (PCE = 5.4%), yet having access block copolymer assemblies of controllable block ratios should give chemists an added tool in dialing-in optimal polymer–fullerene morphologies for BHJSCs.

Ashraf, Meager and coworkers have reported the use of 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene156 to prepare polymer 205 bearing additional thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and diketopyrrolopyrrole subunits (Scheme 23).157 Polymer 205 was obtained in a 65% yield with a high Mn value of 95000 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.5); 205 also displayed efficient absorption in the near IR region with λmax = 832 nm in the solid state. Polymer 205 was incorporated into a top gate/bottom contact (TG/BC) OFET yielding an impressive mobility of 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, a threshold voltage of −13 V and an on/off ratio of ca. 103. In addition, 205 was used to fabricate both conventional and inverted BHJSCs, with the best configuration being an inverted ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM; 1:2 ratio/MoO3/Ag with an open circuit voltage of 0.56 V, a very high short circuit current (JSC) of 21.5 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.63, and an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.6%. Notably, the related tellurophene analogue 206 was also prepared with a slightly red-shifted λmax (866 nm in solution and film) with a lower threshold voltage in TFTs of −8 V noted.157

Patra and coworkers recently developed an intriguing room temperature metal-free Br2 catalyzed polymerization of selenophenes with a PEDOS-type structure (Scheme 24).158 When R = H (207) the resulting insoluble black-colored polymer exhibited high levels of conductivity (2–4 S cm−1), suggesting in situ doping of the resulting materials by bromine. Placement of dodecyl groups on the selenophene ring structure yielded a blue soluble polymer upon exposure to Br2 (208) with a number average molecular weight (Mn) of ca. 5 × 103 g mol−1.

In 2015, the Seferos group reported the preparation of a three-dimensional selenophene-containing organic framework (210) along with its corresponding thiophene (209) and tellurophene (211) analogues (Scheme 25).159 The pore size in the selenophene organic framework 210 was estimated by modelling and BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) measurements to be 42 Å and the surface area was found to be 478.8 m2 g−1, making this framework potentially useful as a mesoporous material. Both the thiophene (209) and selenophene (210) frameworks exhibited weak photoluminescence at λmax = 542 nm and λmax = 456 nm respectively, while the tellurium analogue is non-emissive (as is commonly encountered for such species). As expected, the UV-vis spectrum of the selenophene-containing organic framework 210 is red-shifted (350 nm) compared to the thiophene analogue (209; λmax = 346 nm), while concurrently blue-shifted with respect to the Te analogue (211; λmax = 366 nm), consistent with the calculated HOMO–LUMO gap for model compounds.

Tellurium
The synthesis of tetraphenyltellurophene TeC4Ph4 in 1961 by Braye et al. was the first example of a fully characterized substituted tellurophene complex.135 Progress in the domain of tellurophene synthesis and reactivity has been summarized in various review articles,160–162 and there have been reviews covering the incorporation of tellurophenes into polymeric structures.163,164 More recently the Seferos group has published a comprehensive review on polytellurophenes for high performance applications,165 while Rivard also described the use of tellurophenes as light-emitting materials in a separate review article.166 As a result, we will review tellurium-containing π-conjugated materials with optoelectronic applications that have emerged since these most recent reviews were published.
Building upon their initial work containing dibromo- and dichloro-adducts of tellurophenes,167 the Seferos group reported the photoreductive elimination of bromine, chlorine and quite impressively, fluorine, from 2,5-diphenyldihalotellurophenes.168 They were able to demonstrate that the photoreductive elimination of bromine occurred rapidly with a 16.9% quantum efficiency when utilizing 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene (DMBD) as a halogen trap; such a process is key to the exploration of alternative methods of storing solar energy within chemical bonds (in this case a storage cycle based on hydrogen halides, HX).169 Notably, the formal loss of F2 from difluorotellurophenes is the only example of photoreductive elimination of fluorine from an inorganic compound (quantum yields up to 2.3%). The groups of Seferos and Scaiano combined efforts to explore the reactivity of the substituted 2,5-diaryltellurophenes 212–220 (Scheme 26) in detail.170 These diaryltellurophenes contained a wide range of electron-donating and accepting units, with some aryl-tellurophene linkages prepared via an ipso-arylative cross coupling initially employed by Grubbs and coworkers to prepare polytellurophenes.171,172 Compounds (212–220) were found to undergo oxidative addition of Br2 to yield the dibromotellurophenes 221–229. Each of these Te(IV) species underwent reversible photodebromination, with the most efficient loss of Br2 occurring when electron-deficient –C6F5 groups were positioned onto a tellurophene. It was also noted that significant quenching of excited triplet states by oxygen competed with Br2 loss, as determined by monitoring luminescence in the IR region from the singlet oxygen (1O2) generated after triplet quenching.37
 Scheme 26  Reversible bromination of 2,5-diaryltellurophenes. 
Choi and coworkers173 demonstrated that their previously synthesized polymer 230174 was able to undergo a similar reversible uptake of Br2 (Scheme 27) as demonstrated previously by the Seferos group.163 The color change in the polytellurophene produced upon bromination was used to develop a solid state optical sensor for elemental bromine. The Seferos group also noted reversible Br2 uptake in the tellurophene-containing organic framework discussed previously in this review (211; Scheme 25), with a color change from green-brown to orange-red as –TeBr2– environments were formed; the release of bromine via photoreductive elimination studies on these 3D frameworks were not undertaken.
 Scheme 27  Bromination of the polytellurophene 230. 
As mentioned in our section on selenium-containing π-systems, the Seferos group was able to synthesize a series of platinum–bisacetylide chalcogenophene polymers.154 The tellurium-containing polymer (200, Scheme 20) was obtained in a 47% yield with an Mn value of 13900 g mol−1 (PDI = 3.69). As expected for heavy atom substitution in conjugated materials, the absorption maximum (λmax) for the tellurophene-containing polymer is significantly red-shifted (448 nm) compared to the Se (431 nm) and S (418 nm) analogues. This tellurium-containing polymer (200) shows weak fluorescence in the presence of air (λmax = 460 nm; quantum yield = 0.06%), however upon degassing these chloroform solutions to remove dissolved oxygen, quenching of triplet emission was suppressed and a new phosphorescence emission peak at 671 nm emerged; this is a rare example of room temperature phosphorescence featuring a tellurophene.175,176 In very interesting recent work, the Bonifazi laboratory have also noted phosphorescence in a series of benzo-1,3-chalcogenazoles, with one case of phosphorescence noted in the solid state.177
Earlier this year Seferos and coworkers178 reported their findings related to the controlled synthesis of well defined, high molecular weight poly-3-alkyltellurophenes (232–235) utilizing catalyst transfer polycondensation methodology (Fig. 17). Specifically the role of side group branching was examined where it was found that the widely used 2-ethylhexyl groups had detrimental effects on the polymerization rate and the polymer quality, while placing ethyl branches at more remote 3- and 4-positions along the alkylchain led to improved molecular weight control and a red-shift in absorption. The authors attribute this to the decreased degree of twisting as the ethyl branch is moved further away from the heterocycle, resulting in increased effective conjugation between the tellurophene backbone units. The reported living polymerization of tellurophene also enabled the synthesis of the block copolymer, poly-3-hexylthiophene-b-poly-3-ethylheptyltellurophene (235).
 Fig. 17  Structures of the polytellurophenes 232–235. 
Al-Hashimi, Heeney and coworkers reported a new synthesis of 2,5-dibromo-3-dodecyltellurophene and conducted a co-polymerization with E-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethylene via Stille coupling to the poly-tellurophene–vinylene 182 (Scheme 18).148 Polymer 182 was isolated in a 57% yield with an approximate Mn of 10000 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.4). The charge carrier mobility of this polymer was also investigated for use in field effect transistors, however the production of high quality films was problematic due to its low solubility. Nonetheless, TFTs with two different device architectures, bottom gate/top contact, and top gate/bottom contact were prepared with field effect mobilities of 0.001 and 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The authors note that the incorporating of tellurium does not exhibit an increase in mobility relative to its lighter element congeners, despite the possibility of close Te⋯Te interactions. This is likely due to the poor film formation ability of this polymer and future work will focus on the side group modification to enhance TFT performance.
Conclusions
It was the intention of this review article to showcase the exciting chemical reactivity and promising optoelectronic properties one can attain when π-conjugated materials are designed with heavy main group elements as key components. Given the large number of very recent articles in this field, clearly there is a “rising tide” of collective research transpiring. Perhaps it is fitting to issue some parting challenges/goals to those exploring such inorganic–organic hybrid materials in the future.
By taking advantage of effective mixing between singlet and triplet excited states when heavy inorganic elements are present in π-conjugated materials, one could take advantage of long-lived exciton formation (up to the millisecond regime). This would lead to very long exciton diffusion lengths within photovoltaically active materials. Such species would be of great value to solar cell development179 where pre-mature recombination of electron-holes (excitons) leading to energy loss is a major challenge, requiring intimate interfacial mixing of donor and acceptor materials at the nanoscale.
From the recent discovery of solid-state phosphorescence in heavy main group element-containing molecules, one could use this property to construct “host-free” LEDs if the existing challenge of enhancing charge migration through these next generation phosphors can be solved.166 Furthermore due to large Stoke shift values inherent to phosphorescent materials, one could use emitting heavy element π-systems to eventually achieve stable near IR emission for bioimaging applications.109
