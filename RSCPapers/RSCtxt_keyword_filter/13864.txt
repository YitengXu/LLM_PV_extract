The surface morphology and I−/I3− redox behaviors based on PProDOT-Et2 and sputtered-Pt electrodes were characterized, and their performances as counter electrodes in the plastic-DSSCs were compared. Cells fabricated with a PProDOT-Et2 counter electrode showed a higher conversion efficiency of 5.20% compared with cell fabricated with sputtered-Pt (5.11%) electrodes under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2. This enhancement was attributed to the increase in the effective surface area and good catalytic properties of PProDOT-Et2 for I3− reduction.
Recent advancements of plastic electronics successfully attract the technologies of printable materials to develop thin and cost-effective devices. The plastic dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a potential candidate for a lightweight plastic power source, which can be manufactured by rapid processes under atmospheric pressure.1,2 The key process of plastic DSSCs is the low-temperature preparation for both photo-electrode and counter electrode. For the photo-electrode, a viscous binder-free TiO2 paste that is capable of interparticle connection was used.1,2 As for the counter electrode, a Pt film which has high catalytic properties and high conductivity was utilized, even though Pt is one of the most expensive components in DSSCs. Recently, to reduce the production cost, several varieties of carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, graphite, and carbon black have been employed for counter electrodes in DSSCs.3–6 However, the internal resistances of device increase with the thickness of the counter electrodes, resulting in a lower fill factor and efficiency. Meanwhile, conducting polymers are also promising candidates as counter electrodes in DSSCs. The use of chemically polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on FTO glass was proposed and achieved a conversion efficiency of ∼3.6%7. Polypyrrole and polyaniline nanoparticles prepared for the counter electrodes, achieving better conversion efficiencies than that using Pt,8,9 were reported. Nevertheless, all those materials mentioned above required thermal treatments or complicated fabricated processes. In this study, the properties of poly(3,3-diethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno-[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine) (PProDOT-Et2) films prepared by electrodeposition as the counter electrodes for low-temperature fabricated plastic-DSSCs were reported. The influences of electrodeposition charge capacities on the morphology of polymer films and the performances of the plastic-DSSCs were also investigated.
Anhydrous I2, tertiary butanol, N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB), LiI, tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), aectonitrile (AN) and 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) were obtained from Wako Chemical (Osaka, Japan). The cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719) was obtained from Solaronix (Aubonne, Switzerland). ITO-coated polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) (15 Ω/sq., Peccell Technologies Inc., Japan) was used as the substrate for the TiO2 electrode. The PProDOT-Et2 thin film was electropolymerized from the bath solution composed of 10 mM monomer and 0.1 M LiClO4 in AN using a three-electrode system with a potentiostat (Autolab Eco Chemie, PGSTAT 30). The monomer, 3,4-(2′,2′-diethylpropylene)-dioxythiophene (ProDOT-Et2), was purchased from Aldrich. A constant potential of 1.1 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) was applied on the FTO glass until the expected charge capacities were reached. The Pt (100 nm) was sputtered onto the FTO glass. Mesoporous TiO2 layer was coated by a doctor blade method onto the ITO/PEN substrate using the binder-free paste (PECC-K01, Peccell Technologies), followed by heat-drying at 150 °C for 10 min. The dye solution was prepared as 3 × 10−4 M of N719 in acetonitrile–tert-butanol (50/50, v/v). The TiO2 films were sensitized in N719 dye solution for 2 h at 40 °C. Electrolyte composition was 0.4 M LiI, 0.4 M TBAI, 0.04 M I2, 0.3 M NMB in a mixture of AN and MPN (50/50 v/v).
A sandwich-type closed cell was fabricated by using Surlyn film (Dupont, USA, thickness = 25 μm) as the sealer. The geometrical electrode area was controlled at at 0.238 cm2 with a black mask (ϕ = 0.55 cm). The J–V (current density–voltage) curve was measured by a computer-controlled digital source meter (Keithley 2400) under the illumination by a solar simulator (Peccell Technlogies Inc., PEC-L11) at AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured with an action spectrum measurement setup (Peccell Technologies Inc., PEC-S20).
The PProDOT-Et2 film showed a wire-like and highly porous structure due to the steric effect of monomer10 and resulted in a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of ca. 83.5 nm, which was larger than that of Pt film of ca. 23.6 nm over a 5 × 5 μm area. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized in this system to compare the redox behavior between the sputtered-Pt electrode widely used and the electrodeposited PProDOT-Et2 electrode as shown in Fig. 1(a). The two anodic and cathodic peaks represent the following reactions:11 3I−↔ I3− + 2e−(1) 2I3−↔ 3I2 + 2e−(2)Fig. 1(a) reveals similar anodic and cathodic peaks and associated charge capacities for the PProDOT-Et2 film with a deposited capacity of 40 mC cm−2 compared with sputtered-Pt film. The redox reaction at the PProDOT-Et2 electrode surface was affected by the adsorption of iodide species, so the cathodic peak was slightly negative shifted. This suggests that some specific interaction between I−/I3− and the PProDOT-Et2 electrode may exist, as in the case of the Pt electrode.7,12Fig. 1(b) shows the consecutive CV scanned in the region of I−/I3− redox couple. With 100 cycles test, the CV curves did not change significantly, and showed stable peak currents as shown in Fig. 1(c), indicating that the PProDOT-Et2 film was coated tightly and homogeneously.13

According to the previous structural characterization of the PProDOT-Et2 films, it was inferred that a dense layer was formed initially and followed by a porous polymer film with increasing the deposited charge capacities from 10 to 80 mC cm−2. Further increase in the deposited charge capacity led to significant aggregations of PProDOT-Et2 that reduced the active surface area (see Fig. 2). A rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry is applied for determining the heterogeneous rate constant (k0) and active surface area, as listed in Table 1, from the intercept and slope of the Koutecký–Levich plots. It is found that the PProDOT-Et2 films have similar k0 values of ca. 5 × 10−5 cm s−1, which is about one order of magnitude lower than that of Pt electrode. On the other hand, the film with a charge capacity of 40 mC cm−2 has the highest active surface area of ca. 22.48 cm2, which is also about one order higher than that of Pt. This explains why PProDOT-Et2 film with a deposited charge capacity of 40 mC cm−2 possesses similar catalytic ability to that of Pt film.

The photovoltaic performance of the plastic-DSSCs based on both Pt and PProDOT-Et2 films were shown in Fig. 3 and the photovoltaic parameters were given in Table 1. The DSSC with a 40 mC cm−2 PProDOT-Et2 counter electrode had the highest short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC), and resulted in a good conversion efficiency of 5.20% comparing with 5.11% for the one using the sputtered-Pt electrode. Interestingly, the most pronounced change was observed in the fill factor (FF), which showed an optimal value of 0.627 at the deposition capacity of 40 mC cm−2. Meanwhile, the behavior of JSC and conversion efficiency was almost the same. The decrease in the JSC, VOC and FF at higher deposited charge capacities resulted from the aggregation of PProDOT-Et2 and the appearance of large pores in the film which reduced the redox rate of I−/I3−.
 Fig. 3  The J–V curves of plastic DSSCs based on both PProDOT-Et2 and Pt counter electrodes, measured under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). 
The impedance analysis on the plastic-DSSCs under different conditions of counter electrode is shown in Fig. 4. The first semicircle, Rct1, in the high frequency region (103∼105 Hz) represents the electrochemical reaction at the counter electrode interface. The lowest Rct1 value was noted at 40 mC cm−2 due to the high active surface area and good catalytic property. In addition, the characteristic frequency peak shifted to lower frequency when the deposited charge capacities were higher than 40 mC cm−2. It is implied that the redox rate on the counter electrode became slower due to the reduction of active surface area. In Fig. 5, the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) have the similar behavior for plastic-DSSCs based on sputtered-Pt and PProDOT-Et2 (40 mC cm−2) counter electrodes. The IPCEs exceeded 50% in a spectral range from 450 to 600 nm and reached a maximum value of about 60% at 530 nm. In the higher wavelength region (550–800 nm), sputtered-Pt based DSSC has higher value of IPCE than that of PProDOT-Et2 (40 mC cm−2) based, since the sputtered-Pt electrode reflects the light back to the working electrode. The at-rest stabilities of plastic-DSSCs were also shown in the inset of Fig. 5. It was found that the conversion efficiency based on PProDOT-Et2 (40 mC cm−2) was only a bit lower than that of sputtered-Pt after 1000 h test, indicating that PProDOT-Et2 film could be an alternative material to substitute for Pt in DSSCs.

In summary, a plastic-DSSC using PProDOT-Et2 as counter electrodes was studied along with the effect of the electrodeposited charge capacity. The PProDOT-Et2-based plastic-DSSC showed better cell performance due to the higher surface area from its wire-like structure and the good catalytic behavior for reducing I3−. The CV measurement involving the I−/I3− redox reaction on the PProDOT-Et2 electrode showed no major difference, compared with that of the sputtered-Pt electrode. The optimal charge capacity of PProDOT-Et2 for the plastic-DSSC was determined to be 40 mC cm−2, with conversion efficiency of 5.20%, and JSC, VOC, and FF values of 11.22 mA cm−2, 0.740 V, and 0.627, respectively.
