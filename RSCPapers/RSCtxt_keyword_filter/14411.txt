    , Accepted 22nd April 2018First published on 23rd April 2018AbstractTernary blend systems have been used to enhance the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is still a challenge to find suitable third components that concurrently possess complementary light absorption and well-matched energy levels. Here, a small organic molecule, 4,4′-(9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-(pyren-1-yl)phenyl)anili-ne) (DFNPy), which contains a triphenylamine core and bulky pyrene rings, was designed and used to construct ternary blend OSCs. DFNPy shows complementary absorption spectra in the 350–450 nm shortwave band, which has seldom been reported in the field of ternary OSCs. Furthermore, the bulky pyrene rings aggregate via π–π stacking to promote charge transfer. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.59% with an enhanced JSC of 19.72 mA cm−2 was realized in PTB7-Th:DFNPy:PC71BM-based ternary OSCs. The addition of DFNPy was found to modulate the film morphology by improving the film phase separation and crystallinity, which can facilitate charge generation and decrease charge recombination, resulting in enhanced mobility. The results demonstrate an effective strategy for improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.
Introduction
Ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) incorporating an additional component as a donor or an acceptor have aroused significant interest in researchers over the past few years. Ternary organic blends can broaden the absorption range of OSCs without using complicated tandem cell structures, resulting in high short-circuit current densities (JSC) and fill factor (FF). Thus, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) can be obtained using single-junction devices.1–4 This strategy integrates both enhanced photon harvesting by incorporating multiple organic materials as in tandem solar cells and the simplicity of the fabrication process used in single-junction solar cells. Thus, it is very effective for overcoming the limitations of binary-blend OSCs. The third component in ternary blend OSCs plays several vital roles, including complementing light harvesting, facilitating exciton dissociation, enhancing charge transport, and optimizing the film morphology.5–7 As a result, many characteristics of binary OSCs can be used to improve the PCE to over 13% in a ternary system. In particular, over the past few years, researchers have conducted much work on how to improve the PCEs of OSCs via the design of new donor8–10 and acceptor11–14 materials, interface engineering,15–17 new processing methods,18,19 and innovative device architectures.20–22 As the efficiency of the ternary OSC has rapidly improved, a growing number of research studies have focused on the development of OSCs.
For ternary OSCs, the choice of the third component is crucial; this component is always either a polymer23–26 or a small molecule.25,26 Large challenges remain regarding further enhancement of polymer device performances, such as need for polymer purification, poor reproducibility of polymer synthesis, and specifically the correlation of the structural and electronic properties of the final active materials. However, small molecules are easier to obtain with high purity, and they usually have a monodisperse structure compared with polymers, which allows easier energy level control and less batch-to-batch variation of material properties.27,28 Small molecules do not only provide a more reliable analysis of the structure–performance relationships with respect to device performances, but they also contribute to high photovoltaic performance. Therefore, solution-processed small-molecule-based OSCs have attracted increasing attention and display great potential for high-performance OSCs.29,30 In general, photon collection and charge carrier transport in a three-way active layer can be enhanced by adjusting the band gap and energy level of the third component. Moreover, the miscibility of the materials used has a crucial role in influencing the distribution of the third component in the ternary active layer, resulting in various operating mechanisms of the ternary OSC, such as energy transfer and charge transfer.31–33 Additionally, the incorporation of a third component will affect the molecular arrangement and morphology of the ternary active layers owing to the multi-length-scale phase domains.4 Therefore, appropriate phase separation can be obtained via finely adjusting the content of the third component, which depends to a large extent on the miscibility of the used materials. Incorporating the third component with the binary polymer/fullerene system can result in enhanced light absorption, improved and efficient charge transfer, and optimized bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology, accordingly increasing the overall efficiency of the OSCs.34–36 A PCE of over 10% has been reportedly achieved via the careful selection of the third component.35,36 In the past few decades, many effective molecular design strategies have been developed to modulate the optoelectronic properties of photovoltaic materials, such as donor–acceptor structure modification, side chain engineering, and functional group modulation.37,38 The molecular frontier orbital, including the density distribution of the π-electrons and their energy levels as well as the intermolecular interactions, can be effectively tuned by these actual chemical modifications.
Herein, we report a strategy to increase JSC values and improve the thin film morphology of OSCs by introducing the small molecule DFNPy into a binary blend system of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). This system was selected for its good compatibility and high PCE.12,39 The small molecule DFNPy, which possesses four bulky pyrene rings, was experimentally determined to form intermolecular π–π stacking as a neat film. The absorption of DFNPy complements PTB7-Th in the short-wavelength region of 350–450 nm, which is always ignored in OSCs. A detailed investigation of the donor absorption window shows that if the absorption window width can be increased from 200 nm to 400 nm, the OSC's PCE can be improved by about 35%.40 We have finely tuned the DFNPy:PTB7-Th weight ratio to investigate the influences of DFNPy on the optical, electronic, and morphological properties of the PTB7-Th:DFNPy:PC71BM ternary blend. As a result, a significant enhancement of light harvesting was achieved. With an inverted device structure, the PCE was drastically improved from 9.44% to 10.59%, owing to an enhanced JSC of 19.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.15% with the addition of 15% (w/w) DFNPy into PTB7-Th:PC71BM. It was found that complementary optical absorption could be achieved in all ternary blends, compared with the binary blend. The enhancement of JSC was mainly owing to π–π stacking, which strengthened the charge transport properties. The shortwave band (350–450 nm) light compensation of DFNPy also contributed to the increase of JSC. At the same time, a smooth morphology and good crystallinity were observed in a ternary organic solar cell by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indicating that the four bulky pyrene ring structures of the DFNPy molecules will cause π–π stacking between the molecules, thus promoting the photocurrent of the device in the correct range and promoting the morphology of the thin films, which is shown in both the improved JSC and FF, as well as in the improved electron mobility.
Experimental section
Materials
DFNPy was synthesized in our laboratory and will be presented in detail in our next publication. PTB7-Th was purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech and PC71BM from American Dye Source. Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals are commercially available products, and were used as received. All solvents for the reactions were distilled prior to use.
Device fabrication
This study used an inverted device structure to ensure the stability of the devices; the configuration of the photovoltaic devices was ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/PTB7-Th:DFNPy:PC71BM (100 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (150 nm), where ITO refers to indium tin oxide. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 110 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) and 31 mg of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) in 1 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH). ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) were washed via sequential ultrasonication in ethanol and acetone, for 30 min each, and then UV-cleaned under ultraviolet-ozone radiation for 30 min. A thin layer of ZnO was grown on a cleaned ITO surface by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and then baked on a hot plate at 200 °C for 1 h. Chlorobenzene (CB) was chosen as the solvent for all OSCs. In addition, 3 vol% DIO (1,8-diiodooctane) was added to the solution and then stirred in a nitrogen-filled glove box for 24 hours. The ternary blend solution with various contents of DFNPy was rotated at 2000 rpm for 30 s to obtain a uniform thin film of the active layer having a thickness of about 100 nm. Then, approximately 10 nm of MoO3 and 150 nm of Ag were deposited on the active layer as the cathode of the device through a shadow mask to achieve an active area of 0.02 cm2.
Measurement method
The current density–voltage (J–V) properties of the binary and ternary OSCs were measured under atmospheric convection using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit and a Newport Oriel Sol3A Simulator calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell under the simulated sunlight of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. UV-vis absorption measurements were performed using a U-3900 (Hitachi) spectrophotometer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured by using a QEX10 Quantum Efficiency Measurement System (PV Measurements Inc.) equipped with a standard Si diode using monochromatic light generated from a PV Measurements 300 W lamp source. The active layer solution on ZnO-coated ITO glass was made of AFM measurement samples under ambient conditions. Surface morphologies of active layers were investigated by using an MFP-3D-BIO AFM system (Asylum Research). The TEM test was needed to meet specific test conditions. The active layer was first spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO glass under N2 glove box ambient conditions. Then, because of the hydrophilic nature of PEDOT:PSS, the sample was placed into a container filled with ultrapure water to cause the organic layer to lift-off and float on the water's surface. Thus, the sample was transferred to a TEM porous copper network (200 meshes). TEM was performed at 100 kV using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (Hitachi TEM system). A fluorescence spectrometer was used to obtain PL spectra (F-4600, Hitachi). Out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted using a Panalytical X Pert pro, and performed over an angular range of 10–70° with a step size of 0.04° and a scan speed of 0.5° min−1.
Results and discussion
In this work, an organic small molecule, DFNPy, was selected to be an additional donor material of ternary OSCs. The chemical structures and energy levels of PTB7-Th, DFNPy, and PC71BM are shown in Fig. 1a and c, respectively. The bulky pyrene rings of DFNPy contributed to the formation of π–π stacking.

(d) PL spectra of DFNPy measured in dichloromethane solution and in the thin film under 390 nm light excitation. 
To confirm our assumption that π–π stacking occurs, the photoluminescence spectra were measured in a dichloromethane solution and in the thin film (spin-coated on ITO glass). As shown in Fig. 1d, the photoluminescence spectra peak displayed a broad red-shift (25–30 nm) when in the solution state compared with the film state, demonstrating that DFNPy in the film state is more extensively aggregated than in solution.37,41,42 The origin of the red-shift was the π–π stacking of the pyrene and fluorene rings in the aggregated state, leading to an increase of the JSC values of the ternary blend OSCs.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the single material-containing films are shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption range of DFNPy was 300 to 410 nm, while the maximum absorption peak for the PTB7-Th film was at 702 nm along with a shoulder peak at 641 nm. It is evident that the absorption spectra of DFNPy are complementary to those of the donor–acceptor host system. The absorption peak of PTB7-Th and the emission peak of DFNPy have a good overlap in the range of 300 nm to 450 nm. Thus, it can be concluded that there should have been energy transfer between DFNPy and PTB7-Th.43,44Fig. 2b shows the absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM (donor:acceptor ratio of 1:1.5) binary system containing different amounts of DFNPy, i.e. the DFNPy:PTB7-Th ratio was 0:1, 0.05:0.95, 0.10:0.90, 0.15:0.85 and 0.20:0.80. Owing to the low solubility of the small molecule, the doping ratio did not increase further. Due to the appropriate amount of DFNPy being incorporated into the donor material, all of the blend films showed a full spectral absorption range of 300–800 nm, especially in the short wavelength range. There is a clear complementarity between the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor, indicating that the light collection of the ternary blend films can be optimized by adjusting the DFNPy content. The absorption spectra in the region of 630–720 nm, which is related to PTB7-Th, decreased slightly with increasing DFNPy content. The absorption in the 350–470 nm region increased slightly upon increasing the DFNPy concentration from 0% to 15%, owing to the introduction of DFNPy resulting in complementary absorption in the 300–410 nm region. When the DFNPy doping ratio increased to 15%, the absorption decreased slightly. This may be because an excessive concentration of the small molecules affects the crystallinity and molecular alignment of the binary system.45

To investigate the influence of different concentrations of added DFNPy on device performance, the photovoltaic properties of the ternary OSCs were evaluated with an inverted device structure consisting of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1b, where ITO acts as the cathode for the cell and ZnO is the electron transport layer. The optimized donor:acceptor weight ratio is 1:1.5 (w/w) with a donor concentration of 10 mg mL−1 when adding 3% DIO in CB. Over 20 OSC samples for each parameter were fabricated to calculate the average device performance. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves measured under AM1.5G irradiation with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. To further verify the JSC of the ternary blend OSCs, the EQE spectra of the binary and ternary blend OSCs were measured, as shown in Fig. 3b.

As expected, JSC and FF of the OSCs increased as the amount of doped DFNPy increased, however, little variation in open-circuit voltage (VOC). Detailed photovoltaic parameters of the ternary OSCs are summarized in Table 1. The DFNPy content of 0 to 10 wt% caused JSC and FF to increase slightly to 19.56 mA cm−2 and 67.26%, respectively, obtaining a PCE of 10.05%. As the DFNPy content further increased, the performance of the devices also increased. In particular, when the DFNPy content was 15 wt%, the PCE of the device attained its highest value at 10.59%, with a JSC of 19.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.15%. However, when we further increased the DFNPy content to 20 wt%, the JSC and PCE values started to decrease. The VOC values of the ternary blend OSCs were mainly determined by small differences between the HOMO energy level of PTB7-Th and the LUMO energy level of PC71BM;46,47 therefore, the constant VOC indicates that DFNPy does not have much of an impact on the HOMO energy levels. The enhanced JSC of the ternary OSCs can be mainly attributed to the complementary absorption spectra, while the increased FF may in part be caused by changes to the morphology owing to the introduction of the third component. The calculated JSC values were 17.92, 18.20, 19.01, 19.12, and 17.73 mA cm−2 for a doping ratio of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%, respectively, as shown in Table 1, which are in good agreement with both the measured JSC values (within 5% deviation) and the optical absorption data for the small molecule. Fig. 3b shows clearly that as DFNPy was added to the binary system, the EQE values in the range of 350–450 nm increased, which is in agreement with the absorption spectra of the ternary blend OSCs. In the absorption range of polymers (550–800 nm), the EQE values increased when increasing the DFNPy concentration from 0 to 15 wt%, and then decreased when increasing the concentration to 20 wt%. This indicates that DFNPy can increase charge transmission from PTB7-Th to PC71BM, although excess DFNPy (20 wt%) reduces the EQE and accordingly the JSC values. While the absorption in the short-wavelength range (350–410 nm) is enhanced, this corresponds to the absorption peak of DFNPy, thus indicating that DFNPy itself can enhance the light harvesting capabilities of devices.

In order to explore the primary reason for enhancing EQE, we also measured the IQE curve of the ternary device, according to the formula , where R(λ) and T(λ) denote, respectively, the wavelength-dependent reflectance and transmittance data which were measured by using Shimadzu UV2600. As shown in Fig. 3c, the significantly increased IQE values in the DFNPy absorption range are the combination of absorption and high-efficiency exciton dissociation, indicating EQE enhancement at 350–450 nm.48 However, in the PTB7-Th absorption region, IQE is still enhanced by the addition of the appropriate amount of DFNPy, which is the same as the EQE test result. It shows that the IQE and EQE enhancement mainly comes from the induction of DFNPy, which promotes the exciton dissociation and charge extraction of the polymer donor.
The charge carrier transport of the ternary active layer can be enhanced via introducing the π–π stacking property of the DFNPy small molecule. In fact, the balance of hole and electron transport plays a crucial role in determining the performance of OSCs. The charge carrier mobility can be characterized by a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method.49 Hole-only and electron-only diodes were fabricated using the structures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/blend (100 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Au (100 nm) and ITO/ZnO (40 nm)/blend (100 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80 nm), respectively. The J–V curves of the devices with different DFNPy contents were plotted as J0.5versus V, as shown in Fig. 4. The calculation of hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility is according to the Mott–Gurney equation as follows:  where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εγ is the dielectric constant of the material, μ is the charge carrier mobility (μh or μe), and d is the average active layer thickness. V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, and Vbi is the correction voltage (for hole-only devices, Vbi = 0.45; for electron-only devices, Vbi = 0).50

The μh, μe, and hole/electron mobility ratios of all the corresponding devices are listed in Table 2. In general, both μh and μe appear to increase slightly as the DFNPy content is increased. It is clear that when the DFNPy content in the donor increases from 0 to 20 wt%, μh increases from 7.01 × 10−4 to 1.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which can be attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of PTB7-Th. Simultaneously, μe increased from 5.43 × 10−4 (0 wt% DFNPy) to 1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (20 wt% DFNPy) owing to π–π stacking and optimized phase separation in the active layers. Evaluating the balance of charge carrier transport by determining μh/μe as balanced charge transport plays a crucial role in determining the OSC performance.51 The value of μh/μe approached 1.09 for the ternary device with 15 wt% DFNPy, indicating that there is no excessive single carrier accumulation and the exciton recombination rate is low, which is in good agreement with this device having the highest FF, JSC, and PCE of all the optimized ternary OSCs.52–54 At the same time, the IQE test (as shown in Fig. 3c) showed the best exciton dissociation rate at 15% DFNPy, which is consistent with the results of the mobility test.

To understand the origin of the increased JSC values in the DFNPy ternary mixed OSCs, the charge transfer ability and complex kinetics were studied via SCLC and intensity-dependent JSC and VOC measurements, respectively. The dependency of JSC and VOC on the light intensities was studied to probe the non-geminate charge recombination dynamics of these devices. The power-law dependence of JSC on the illumination intensity (I) can be expressed as JSC ∝ Iα.55 If the bimolecular recombination in the active layer is weak, JSC is linearly dependent on the light intensity with α value close to 1. Generally, a linear relationship between JSC and I means that the bimolecular recombination is negligible during charge transport. For the ternary devices with 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% doping ratios, the corresponding α factors were 0.94, 0.95, 0.96, 0.98, and 0.94, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5a. When the DFNPy content was 15 wt%, the highest α value of 0.98 (i.e., close to unity) was achieved, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination loss was reduced when using this optimized ternary active layer. We also examined the relationship between VOC and I under open-circuit conditions by fitting to the equation VOC ∝ nKT/qln(I),43 where K is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. In this way we could evaluate the recombination mechanism of the photo-generated charge carriers. If the value of n deviates from unity, trap-induced charge carrier recombination is likely to be involved in the active layer. The fitted values for n were 1.39, 1.34, 1.16, 1.12, and 1.78 for the corresponding OSCs, as shown in Fig. 5b. The n-value of the active layer with 20 wt% DFNPy was 1.78, indicating a significant trap-induced recombination loss in the donor phase. However, in the ternary active layer with 15 wt% DFNPy, the value of n is closest to unity, indicating that the trap-induced compound loss is negligible.

Given the important role of the film morphology of the active layer in determining the device performance of OSCs, we conducted tapping-mode AFM to reveal the morphological differences with different DFNPy contents. Proper phase separation is the basis and decisive condition for obtaining an efficient and stable OSC. As shown in Fig. 6, when adding 0%, 5%, and 15% DFNPy, the ternary blend films still maintained a uniform morphology and a smooth surface with similar root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.936, 1.766, and 1.697 nm, respectively. Note that the RMS values decreased with increasing concentration of DFNPy, implying that a considerable amount of DFNPy can be incorporated well into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system and can optimize the surface morphology of the film. When increasing the DFNPy content to 20%, the RMS increased owing to the inferior solubility of the small molecules at such a high doping ratio, leading to larger domain sizes. The formation of large domains reduces the contact interface between the donors and the acceptors, which is the main reason for the lower JSC and PCE of these ternary devices.

To further study the effect of the DFNPy content on the phase separation and the internal structure of the ternary blend membrane, the morphology of the blend membrane was characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. 7, with low doping concentrations, no significant crystallization was observed, and obvious crystallinity was achieved when the DFNPy content in the donor was increased to 20%. It is well-known that bright areas correspond to the donors and dark areas correspond to PC71BM domains, according to different electron densities. After adding 5% DFNPy (Fig. 7c) to fabricate a ternary blend film, obviously better phase separation than binary film was observed. The PTB7-Th:DFNPy:PC71BM ternary device with a DFNPy content of 15% showed a fairly uniform film morphology with abundant donor/acceptor interfaces (Fig. 7d), leading to higher JSC and FF. In order to more clearly explain the change in the domain size, we have also added more TEM images of 0% and 15%DFNPy with higher magnification and smaller size, as shown Fig. 7b and e. It can be clearly seen that the size of the domain added with 15% of the small molecule is significantly improved. A nano-fibrillar network of PTB7-Th was observed in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend membrane. For the ternary blend membranes, the nanoscale networks became more pronounced as the DFNPy content increased. In ternary blend membranes, DFNPy also regulates the PTB7-Th molecular alignment and optimizes phase separation and enhances photon collection of the active layer.

To illustrate the distribution of small molecules in the active layer, a water contact angle (WCA) test was performed. As shown in Fig. 8, the water contact angles of the active layers of PTB7-Th, PC71BM, DFNPy and PTB7-Th:DFNPy:PC71BM blend films with different amounts of DFNPy were measured, respectively. Because PTB7-Th and PC71BM have different surface energies, the WCA test can intuitively reflect the distribution of different materials in the blend film. As shown in Fig. 8a and b, the WCA of pure PTB7-Th and PC71BM films is 99.29° and 87.45°, indicating that PTB7-Th shows a smaller surface energy and much stronger hydrophobic property than PC71BM. However, as shown in Fig. 8c, the WCA of the pure DFNPy film is 74.35°, indicating a better hydrophilicity than that of PTB7-Th and PC71BM. For the blend film, we know that if the WCA is closer to a pure film, more of this component is distributed on the film surface.56,57Fig. 8d shows the WCA of 95.4° for PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary film, which is obviously closer to that of the pure PTB7-Th film (98.2°), suggesting that PTB7-Th aggregates more and PC71BM less on the surface of the binary blend film, respectively. However, when a certain amount of hydrophilic DFNPy is added, the WCA of the blend layer changes little, and gives an angle of 96.66° for the 15% DFNPy blend film (Fig. 8e) and even 94.78° for the 30% DFNPy blend film (Fig. 8f), which is closer to the value of the pure PTB7-Th layer. These results indicate that PTB7-Th is distributed on the film layer and DFNPy is distributed inside the active layer due to intramolecular π–π stacking.

A structural analysis of the samples was conducted using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction to verify the effect of DFNPy on device crystallinity. In Fig. 9a, all the XRD profiles show a peak at 20° to 21°, which is associated with PTB7-Th. When DFNPy was added, the intensity of this peak increases significantly, from 110 to 180, indicating an improvement in the degree of crystallinity. This result agrees with the conclusion of earlier investigations that showed that DFNPy does change the crystallinity of PTB7-Th and is also consistent with the TEM results. Based on the above-described morphological and optoelectronic characterization, the critical factor that leads to the photovoltaic performance degradation of thermally annealed PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films is the increased crystallinity and molecular stacking. Fig. 9b shows a schematic representation of the possible distributions of the molecules in the ternary blend active layer with 15% DFNPy. According to the above analysis, DFNPy was distributed inside the active layer and PTB7-Th is on the surface of the film. It is well-known that PTB7-Th and PC71BM have a scattered distribution in the binary blend film, which actually prevents the availability of a suitable number of donor/acceptor connections, which decreases charge transfer. By adding DFNPy into the binary blend film, the crystallinity of PTB7-Th was significantly enhanced, and DFNPy was aggregated. Correlating these behaviors with the device performance highlights that a high JSC and a FF of 15% DFNPy OSC could simultaneously be achieved to yield a PCE of 10.59%.

Conclusions
In summary, we have here reported on the small molecule DFNPy, which is based on bulky aromatic fused rings with long alkyl side chains, and we achieved a PCE of 10.59% in an OSC. π–π stacking was proved to exist in a binary film of PTB7-Th and PC71BM by studying the PL spectrum of the film. This stacking arrangement enhanced the electron and hole mobility of the ternary device and also optimized the film morphology, allowing a higher JSC and FF to be obtained. Then, we certified that DFNPy can improve the crystallinity of PTB7-Th, enabling nanoscale networks to become more pronounced, thus achieving smoother films. Furthermore, the absorption range of DFNPy was 300 to 410 nm, which increases the light absorption range of the active layer. The device performance is enhanced as the light absorption is complementary to that of the binary blend. This work provides an interesting strategy for developing highly efficient ternary OSCs via careful material design and device engineering.
