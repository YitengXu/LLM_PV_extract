The difficulty of co-dissolving Te and desirable Cd salts is overcome through a diamine–thiol solvent mixture. Thin films of densely-packed, micron-sized grains are achieved after annealing without the need for chalcogen or CdCl2 vapor treatments.
Cadmium telluride solar cells have attained efficiencies as high as 22.1%1 and open circuit voltages above 1 V,2 and continue to be successful in the highly competitive photovoltaics (PV) market. While there is some environmental concern for the use of CdTe, many studies have concluded that its use provides a relatively benign use for the Cd already produced as a by-product of Zn mining operations due to the stability and insolubility of CdTe compared to Cd.3 Additionally, life cycle analyses of CdTe PV have shown it to have comparable emissions of pollutants (including Cd) with silicon PV and significantly reduced emissions compared with fossil energy sources.4 This motivates this current study in finding a simple, high throughput solution processed route to CdTe PV.
Industrially, CdTe is deposited via a high-rate vapor transport method, similar to lab-based close space sublimation routes. However, there has also been a strong effort to develop solution-based routes to CdTe PV to take advantage of low-cost, high-throughput, roll-to-roll technologies and flexible, lightweight substrates. Among the successful solution-based routes to photovoltaic-quality CdTe thin films have been via nanocrystals,5–10 spray pyrolysis,11,12 and electrodeposition.13–15
In this study, we present an alternative solution-based approach through successive coatings of a thiol–diamine solution of Cd and Te precursors followed by annealing. The attractiveness of developing a molecular solution route is the prospect of directly applying a film of dissolved precursors in a simple one-step process, without the need to synthesize nanoparticles, wash them, and perform the oft required ligand exchanges. As is done here, the coating is often done via spin coating at lab scale, but in future practice would be applied via slot-die coating, screen printing, or other scalable technique. This technique has recently been successful for Cu(InxGa1−x)(SySe1−y)2, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, and other metal chalcogenide (MC) films.16–24
The molecular solution approach to MCs has often been limited by the ability to dissolve the chalcogen. For metal sulfides this is less of an issue as thiols, thiourea, and elemental S are readily soluble in many solvents. Se is more challenging to dissolve in common volatile solvents, but amine–thiol mixtures have recently been used to overcome this.25,26 Solvents that dissolve Te are even less common. Trioctylphosphine and ionic liquids have been used, but would be difficult to remove from the final film due to low volatility.27,28 Tellurium has also been dissolved in hydrazine-based mixtures,11,29–32 using anodic dissolution in acidic solutions,33 and to low concentrations in basic solutions.34 Reduction of Te with borohydrides and other reducing agents has also been reported, though the counterions often associated with these compounds may introduce contaminants (e.g. Na).35,36
Te has also recently been reported to dissolve in ethylenediamine (en)–thiol mixtures.25 As this solution offers tunable volatility based on thiol choice, we selected the en–thiol system for this study. Additionally, we are able to dissolve Te directly rather than Te compounds (e.g. TeO2) that may introduce contaminants and potentially Te in a positive oxidation state. Chalcogens dissolved in thiol–amines are reduced to anions,26 which is ultimately the desired state of Te in CdTe and may lead to fewer crystal defects. Furthermore, the Te reduced in en–thiol remains stable in the presence of Cd ions,17 which is difficult to achieve in many other solvent systems we have tried such as when Te is reduced using borohydrides or rongalite.
Successful molecular solutions methods typically require a solvent system in which the precursors are soluble, but the desired semiconducting material is not or subsequent coatings can dissolve already deposited material. To test the suitability of en–thiol for CdTe, we added 0.4 mmol of CdTe to 4 mL of a 4:1 volumetric mixture of en and 1,2-ethanedithiol for >72 hours at room temperature and found it to be only sparingly soluble. The solution became slightly red-purple in color, but most of the CdTe remained undissolved, suggesting that if Te and Cd sources could be co-dissolved it could be used to prepare CdTe films of tailored thicknesses through successive coatings. For the films demonstrated here, 1-propanethiol (pt) was paired with en, though other thiols and diamines can be used. Interestingly, a diamine is always required for Te dissolution, while either a monoamine or diamine works for S and Se. The smallest diamine and a low-boiling thiol was chosen to enhance volatility of the solvent.
A typical precursor solution is formed by dissolving 0.2 M Te and 0.2 M CdCl2 in a 3:1 volumetric mixture of en and pt, resulting in a dark red, opaque solution. CuCl may also be added in trace amounts as a dopant (see ESI†). This is spin coated onto CdS-coated, FTO-coated glass and then annealed on a hot plate at 500 °C for 90 s. The coating-annealing process is repeated 35–40 times to achieve films approx. 1.5 μm in thickness. Other concentrations, temperatures, and times have been used, but typically produce inferior films (Fig. S1 and S2 in ESI†). The as-coated films are then sealed in an evacuated glass ampoule and introduced into a pre-heated tube furnace for 30 min at 550 °C. Note that in contrast to metal sulfide and selenide films which are often annealed in the presence of chalcogen vapor, this is not done here.
The as-coated films are predominantly CdTe as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1), though we see the evidence of some unincorporated trigonal Te by the minor peaks at 27.6, 38.3, and 40.5 degrees 2θ. Additionally, there are three minor peaks below 15 degrees 2θ, though the precise phase has not been identified. Once annealed, the films show excellent phase purity based on the XRD. Peaks due to the FTO-coated glass substrate are indicated by an asterisk and an artifact peak due to a small amount of Cu-Kβ radiation from the diffractometer has been indicated by the ‘⁁’ symbol.

Trigonal Te (ICSD coll. code 96502) and CdTe (ICSD coll. code 161692) standards are shown for comparison. *Substrate FTO peaks, ⁁Cu-Kβ peak—an artifact of the diffractometer. 
Remarkably, the as-coated films already exhibit significant grain growth, though the presence of unincorporated precursor is also evident around the grains (Fig. 2a). The small grains on the surface of the as-coated films, have been characterized to be Te-rich and give rise to the small Te signal in the XRD (Fig. S3, ESI†). The precursor residues and Te-rich phases are largely consumed or volatilized during annealing to yield dense, micron-sized grains (Fig. 2b). In some films, more of these small grains may remain, though no Te rich phases are present. The annealed films show excellent packing over much of the film. Remarkably, this grain growth and microstructure is achieved without annealing in chalcogen vapor as is required for metal sulfide and selenide films.22,24 Our initial efforts to anneal these films in the presence of Te vapor have resulted in highly Te-rich films and has not been pursued in this study. Optical characterization of the films using UV-vis spectroscopy reveals an optical band gap of 1.45 eV before annealing and 1.44 eV after annealing (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Fracture cross sections of (c) as-coated and (d) annealed films. The precursor material and small grains on the surface of the as-coated films are largely consumed or volatilized by annealing. Dense, micron-sized grains are achieved without annealing in chalcogen vapor. Films are approximately 1.5 μm thick. 
Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was performed over an area of at least 20 × 20 μm2 to obtain a representative bulk elemental composition of the films. Table 1 shows the ratios—based on their atomic percentages—of the major elemental constituents. Te/Cd is nearly one for both the as-coated and annealed films as expected. Both films contain a small amount of S, which arises from both the CdS layer and reaction of some of the thiol before evaporating (discussed in greater detail later). A significant amount of Cl remains in the as-coated films, though it concentrates more in some regions than others (Fig. S5 and S6 in ESI†). After annealing, the Cl concentration is reduced by about an order of magnitude and is uniformly distributed. The removal of Cl is desirable as it can function as an n-type dopant or deep level trap in large quantities.37,38 Carbon also remains in large quantity, even after annealing, though we do not observe the presence of a distinct C-rich layer as observed for other thiol–amine processed MCs.24,39

The S signal observed is unlikely to be from the CdS layer as we do not observe any Sn signal from the FTO and the CdS layer is a thin layer (∼200 nm) deposited directly on the FTO. Rather, S indicates that either the CdS layer has been incorporated and/or reaction of the thiol. Both are likely sources as we have observed CdS to have appreciable solubility in en–pt and thiols are often used as S sources for other MCs.17,24 As CdS is an n-type semiconductor, S impurity is likely to lead to inferior electronic properties. While the XRD shown in Fig. 1, does not immediately indicate CdS, a close look at the peaks at large 2θ, reveals that they are shifted to higher 2θ with respect to the pure CdTe standard (Fig. S7, ESI†). This suggests the uniform incorporation of small amounts of S throughout the film.
A more precise determination of the S distribution within the film was made by analysing a focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out cross section of CdTe coated on ITO-coated glass without a CdS layer. In this case, sol–gel In-doped ZnO was cast as the n-layer after CdTe deposition for a S-free n-layer similar to other reports.6,7Fig. 3 shows a scanning transmission electron microscope high angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) image and a STEM-EDS line scan across the cross section. In accordance with the XRD results, we observed a small amount of S throughout the film. Additionally, we observed a small CdS grain at the CdTe–ITO interface. While we did not observe the CdS grains in great abundance throughout the film, whenever we observed them in the FIB sample they were located at this interface.

Preliminary efforts to fabricate solar cells have emphasized a superstrate configuration of FTO–CdS–CdTe–Cu/Au. We chemical bath deposited CdS (∼150–200 nm) on FTO (Tec 15), which we then annealed in the glove box at 400 °C for 10 minutes. We then deposited 35 coatings of the CdTe layer as previously described. Additionally, every 5 coatings we removed the sample from the glove box and annealed it for 2 min at 350 °C in air to incorporate oxygen in the growth process, as is usually beneficial for CdTe devices.40 After all the coatings were applied, the sample was annealed in a tube furnace at 550 °C for 30 min. We then performed a nitric-phosphoric acid etch as described by Rose et al.40 The bottom contact is applied by thermal evaporation of 4 nm of Cu, followed by 150 nm of Au. The sample was then annealed in air at 190 °C for 20 minutes to promote diffusion of the Cu dopant into the device.41
Power conversion efficiencies under AM 1.5 illumination have been modest, reaching up to about 0.5% (Fig. S8, ESI†), with VOC of 0.46 V, JSC of 3.89 mA cm−2 and FF of 30%. We observe poor rectifying behavior, which is further evidence of the consumption of the CdS layer. Time-resolved photoluminescence on the completed device was also measured and fitted to a biexponential decay to yield a τ1 = 465 ps, and τ2 = 75.7 ns (Fig. S9, ESI†). External quantum efficiency measurements of a similarly processed device reveals poor collection overall, but particularly limited collection from 300–600 nm (Fig. S10, ESI†). The band gap as extracted from the EQE was 1.44 eV. The low lifetimes and low absorption suggest high recombination and shunting. Additional limitations may also be the presence of C, Cl, and S impurities previously discussed. In principle, Cl should be the easiest to remove by simply changing the Cd salt. However, by either partially or completely replacing CdCl2, we can no longer achieve the desired grain growth (Fig. S11, ESI†) and have not achieved functioning devices.
Promisingly, these limitations suggest the path toward future device improvements as it is well known that excessive consumption of the CdS layer can result in a junction with the transparent conductor that will result in inferior device performance.42 Additionally, while small amounts of Cl at grain boundaries is known to improve device performance, in large amounts Cl can act as an n-type dopant or deep trap.37,38 Residues of CdCl2 remaining on other CdTe films in the literature have also noted strong reductions in device performance.43
Future improvements will require obtaining a strong rectifying junction by using alternative buffer layers, protecting the CdS, or by optimizing around a substrate architecture. Impurity removal of S and Cl is expected to be achieved through optimized annealing and preparation techniques.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel, direct solution route to CdTe thin films having achieved the ability to directly reduce elemental Te in the presence of a Cd salt to form a stable solution using a diamine–thiol mixture. The resulting annealed films show exceptionally dense grain growth without the use of chalcogen vapor and no accumulating C-rich layer. Films produced by this method can be processed into solar cells of modest efficiency, being limited by the propensity of the method to incorporate the CdS n-layer and the presence of S, C, and Cl impurities in the film.
