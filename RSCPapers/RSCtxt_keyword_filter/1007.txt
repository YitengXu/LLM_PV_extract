    AbstractAn easily processable nanostructure comprising a TiO2 nanorod (NR) core and CdS quantum dot (QD) shell is fabricated by electrospinning and a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, respectively. The composite material is successfully assembled to photovoltaic devices for efficient solar energy conversion. Stable photovoltaic parameters of a short-circuit photocurrent density of 3.62 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.482 V, a fill factor of 0.30, and an overall power conversion efficiency of over 0.5% are obtained in the presence of a polysulfide electrolyte under standard 1 sun illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Without any elaborate and complicated fabrication procedures, the present methodology is believed to provide a promising mass production means for alternative low-cost solar cells as both electrospinning and SILAR are simple and scalable techniques.

Broader context
Solar energy as a renewable energy source has become publicly acknowledged as current fossil reserves are running out fast. While in continuous pursuit of high-efficiency solar cells, less efficient ones that can deliver significantly lower cost per kilowatt-hour should not be ignored. In this article, we outline the fabrication of a low-cost quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSC) by a combination of electrospinning and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) which is considered competitively viable in view of the fact that both electrospinning and SILAR are inexpensive and scalable techniques. Although the efficiency of current QDSC is still far behind than that of typical dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), we believe it could open-up new vistas in developing low-cost scalable photovoltaic materials.

Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC), utilizing mesoporous TiO2 nanostructures sensitized by metallorganic dye molecules, is one of the pioneering examples of nanostructured solar cells.1–5 Nanostructured solar cells, known as the third generation solar cells, offer a promising means to tap the solar energy source towards solving global energy issues.6.7 Recently, 1-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures have received growing attention as charge transport media for their semi-directed transport capability, reduction of grain boundaries and hence less recombination of charge carriers compared to spherical particles. Moreover, 1-D nanostructures also bear unique advantages of low reflectance due to light scattering and trapping over a wide spectrum range which provide superior optical properties compared to particulate thin films. Therefore, TiO2 has been engineered into various 1-D nanostructures such as nanofibers (NFs), nanowires (NWs), nanorods (NRs), meso rice grains, etc.8–15 for solar energy conversion.
Electrospinning is a well-established and cost-effective technique for large-scale production of 1-D nanostructures of polymers as well as other advanced ceramic materials.16–18 In our group's previous work, this technique was successfully applied in conventional DSCs achieving an efficiency of ∼5.8%.19 Besides dye molecules, quantum dots (QDs) were investigated intensively as novel sensitizers for their probable multi-excitons generation which elevates the theoretical efficiency as high as 44%.20–22 Among the semiconductor QDs sensitizing materials, CdS is a promising candidate for its band gap of 2.4 eV and flat band edge at −0.66 V (pH = 7), rendering it able to absorb visible light and form a favourable band alignment with TiO2 for efficient electron injection (Scheme 1).23–25 To deposit CdS onto TiO2, successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), sometimes also referred to as chemical bath deposition (CBD), is a facile method which is widely used in QD-sensitized solar cells.26–28

Here we report a novel nanostructure of electrospun TiO2 NRs@CdS by fabricating the TiO2 electrode (as explained in detail below) followed by deposition of CdS QDs via SILAR. The composite was then assembled to typical QD-sensitized solar cells to explore its photovoltaic application. The influence of different deposition time (i.e. SILAR cycles) on the cell performance was studied as well. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first attempt to employ both electrospinning and SILAR for low-cost solar energy conversion.
Experimental details
a. Production of TiO2 NRs by electrospinning
The TiO2 NRs were produced by electrospinning as we reported before.19 Typically, 0.5 g of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a mixture containing 0.31 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Mw = 1300000, Sigma-Aldrich), 3 mL of ethanol (absolute, Fischer Scientific) and 1 mL acetic acid (99.7% Sigma-Aldrich) and stirred for nearly 12 h. The resulting pale yellow solution was then subjected to electrospinning using a commercial instrument, NANON (MECC, Japan), at an applied voltage of 30 kV and a feed rate of 1.0 mL h−1. The distance between the needle tip and the collector was 10 cm. The collected electrospun fibers were annealed at 500 °C for 5 h when the polymer matrix evaporated leaving the porous TiO2 NFs. The BET surface area of the NFs was 44 ± 2 m2 g−1. The TiO2 NFs were then ground mechanically to NRs for electrode fabrication (see below).
b. Fabrication of TiO2 NR-based electrodes
In order to make a unique TiO2 NR paste with good rheology for subsequent doctor-blading, we synthesized the polyester polymer for DSCs as per literature.29 In a typical synthesis, ethylene glycol (8.0 g in an RB flask) was heated to 70 °C in oil bath. Nearly 1.42 g of titanium(IV) propoxide was added to this with mild stirring. The mixture, which was slightly turbid upon the addition of the titanium precursor, became clear upon continued stirring. To the clear mixture, 6.3 g of citric acid was added and the temperature was increased to 90 °C for polymerization. This was kept at the same temperature under slow stirring for nearly ∼5 h. The resulting clear polyester polymer was cooled to room temperature and used in the fabrication of TiO2 electrodes as described below. One hundred milligram of the as-prepared TiO2 NRs were mixed with 250 μL of the polyester and sonicated for ∼12 h. The paste was then doctor-bladed on cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide plates (FTO, Asahi Glass, Japan, sheet resistance of 25 Ω/□) on an area of ∼0.28 cm2. The FTOs were annealed at 450 °C for 1 h to evaporate the polymer leaving the porous TiO2 NR films on FTO plates. The thickness of the sintered layer was ∼12 μm.
c. Deposition of CdS QDs and assembly of QD-sensitized solar cells
CdS QDs were deposited on TiO2 NR electrodes via the SILAR method. The electrodes were first dipped in a 0.2 M Cd(NO3)2 (98% Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution for 5 min, rinsed with Millipore water and then dipped in 0.2 M Na2S (98%, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution for another 5 min followed by equal rinsing which was termed ‘one SILAR cycle’. Varying numbers of SILAR cycles were performed to investigate the optimum deposition time. The CdS-deposited TiO2 NR electrodes were combined with a Pt counter-electrode, in the presence of an efficient polysulfide electrolyte (0.5 M Na2S, 2 M sulfur, and 0.2 M NaCl in methanol–water with a volume ratio of 7:3)26 to assemble a typical QD-sensitized solar cell.
Characterizations and measurements
The TiO2@CdS NRs were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker-AXS D8 ADVANCE Powder X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 20 mA, the scan speed and scan step were 2° min−1 and 0.01°, respectively), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Quanta 200 FEG System, FEI Company, USA operated at 10 kV; for SEM measurements, the TiO2@CdS on glass substrates were coated with a thin film of gold for good conductivity), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEOL 3010 operated at 300 kV; a drop of a dispersion of the NFs in methanol was cast on a holey carbon-coated copper grid, dried under ambient conditions and vacuum and used for TEM measurements), respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out using an FE-SEM machine (JEOL JSM-6701F SEM operated at 30 kV). The optical properties were examined by UV-visible spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-visible-NIR spectrometer). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured under illumination with a 300 W xenon lamp through a Gemini-180 monochromator (Jobin Yvon, U.K.) and the photocurrent-voltage (J–V) curves were measured and recorded by XES-151 S solar simulator (San Ei, Japan) under AM1.5 G condition and Autolab PGSTAT30 (Eco Chemie B.V., The Netherlands) integrated with a potentiostat.
Results and discussion
The crystal structure and composition of the product were characterized by X-ray diffractometry. Fig. 1 is the XRD pattern of the as-prepared TiO2@CdS NR-based photoelectrode after 10 SILAR cycles (the most efficient case, as discussed below). All the characteristic peaks were indexed to the anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS file No. 71-1167) which is consistent with our previous work,19 Greenockite phase CdS (JCPDS file No. 77-2306), and the FTO substrate (JCPDS file No. 77-0447). This confirmed the effectiveness of deposition of CdS QDs onto TiO2 NRs via the SILAR process as we expected. The result was further confirmed by EDS measurements performed in SEM (inset of Fig. 1, see below for the SEM images of the electrodes) indicating an elemental composition of cadmium (Cd) and sulfur (S) as well as titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) resulting from the TiO2. The XRD pattern also confirmed that there were no significant cadmium- or sulfur-related impurities present in the photoelectrode.

The surface morphology of the resulting film was studied by FE-SEM measurements. Fig. 2A shows a large area SEM image of the electrode surface after 10 SILAR cycles of deposition of CdS while Fig. 2B is a high-magnification image, clearly revealing the presence of randomly oriented NRs. The inset of Fig. 2B is a cross-sectional SEM image showing the firm and dense packing of the NRs on FTO and the thickness of the film was estimated to be ∼12 μm which is ideal for DSC applications.3 We attribute the compact packing of NRs in the electrodes to the chemical interaction between the side carboxylic acid groups (–COOH) of the polyester and the TiO2 surfaces. The presence of NRs in the electrodes was also analyzed by TEM studies. Fig. 2C shows a bundle of TiO2@CdS NRs of average length and diameters of ∼1 μm and ∼100 nm, respectively. A high-resolution TEM image of a single NR is shown in Fig. 2D, which revealed that the NR surfaces are composed of TiO2 grains of ∼12–20 nm. The top inset in Fig. 2D shows a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and bottom inset is a lattice-resolved image of the NR, both consistent with the anatase phase of TiO2. The presence of CdS in the NRs was also ascertained by EDS during the TEM measurements (ESI†).

The UV-Vis spectra of the TiO2@CdS NRs with different SILAR cycles are shown in Fig. 3. It is interesting to note that with increasing SILAR cycles, the absorption peak of CdS undergoes a slight red-shift with broadening (indicated with a broken arrow) which indicates the growth of the deposited CdS QDs. The size quantization effect of QDs was retained by the SILAR method which is rather simple compared with routine synthetic procedures.20 The size of the CdS QDs deposited after 10 SILAR cycles was estimated to be ∼6.4 nm using an empirical function:30D = (−6.6521 × 10−8)λ3 + (1.9557 × 10−4)λ2 − (9.2352 × 10−2)λ + 13.29where D (nm) is the size of CdS, and λ (nm) is the wavelength of the first excitonic absorption peak determined as 475 nm from the UV-Vis spectrum.

The photovoltaic application of the TiO2@CdS NRs cells was evaluated by assembling them into QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Table 1 lists the effect of deposition time (i.e. SILAR cycles) on the parameters of short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and overall power conversion efficiency (η) while Fig. 4 depicts the corresponding J–V curves. Polysulfide was used as the electrolyte as it was reported to be the most efficient electrolyte for QD-sensitized solar cells so far despite its complicated chemistry.26 The poor J–V characteristics and the low FF, usually shown by most of the QDSCs, were recently explained by a recombination pathway through monoenergetic surface states in TiO2.28 There is also a contribution from the charge-transfer resistance of the Pt counter electrode. The best reproducible cell performance was obtained after 10 SILAR cycles with a short-circuit photocurrent density of 3.62 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.48 V, a fill factor of 0.30, and an overall power-conversion efficiency of 0.52%. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the device only absorbs light shorter than 570 nm with a peak of ∼45% at about 475 nm. The IPCE spectrum also reproduced the optical absorption spectrum of the CdS QDs, which confirmed the photo-induced electron transfer from QDs to the TiO2 NRs. The photovoltaic parameters were lowered significantly after 15 SILAR cycles, and it is concluded that too many SILAR cycles will hamper the device performance in that over-loading of CdS QDs blocks the pores of the TiO2, resulting in poor electrolyte penetration and would serve as recombination centers as well.31 We still achieved ∼50% of the current density of the best ever reported CdS-sensitized solar cells based on highly-ordered TiO2 nanotubes synthesized by anodic oxidation in organic electrolytes32 and almost the same value of current density of directly electrospun TiO2 nanofibers on FTO plates with both hole-blocking and scattering TiO2 layers33 which are usually used to improve QDSC performance. The photovoltaic performance is comparably notable in view of the random-oriented nature of our electrospun NRs and the simplicity of the electrospinning technique without any elaborate/complicated procedures. We also believe that the 1-D nature of the NRs played a significant role by facilitating the electron transport through the film, which lessens the recombination loss of the electrons and holes at the TiO2/CdS interface to achieve such an efficiency.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we report for the first time a simple method of fabricating TiO2@CdS NRs by combining electrospinning and SILAR techniques sequentially. The photovoltaic application was explored by assembling this nanostructure into QD-sensitized solar cells which gave a best efficiency of over 0.5%. Further optimization of this fabrication process and more insightful work are currently underway which are expected to elevate the photovoltaic parameters further. Considering its very simple and low-cost nature, we believe such a method would provide us a promising means for mass production of alternative QD solar cells.
