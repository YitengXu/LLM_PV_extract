    , Accepted 10th April 2014First published on 11th April 2014AbstractA solution-processed alkylselenophene-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) small molecule, namely, 3,3′-((4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)selenophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(5-octyl-1-(thiophen-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione) (BDTSe-TTPD), with broad absorption and suitable energy levels was synthesized. The widely used solvents o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) or chloroform (CF) were used as the spin-coating solvent, to fabricate efficient photovoltaic devices with BDTSe-TTPD as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor. Devices made from a CF solution demonstrated better performance in terms of short-circuit current, fill factor and power conversion efficiency, as compared to the devices made from the o-DCB and CB solutions. Finally, by optimizing the thickness of the active layer, a power conversion efficiency of 4.37% was achieved on devices with an area of 0.09 cm2, under 100 mW cm−2 of simulated AM 1.5 irradiation.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are considered to be a promising next-generation green technology to address increasing energy problems worldwide.1,2 Currently, OPVs are based on conjugated polymers as electron donor materials and have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10%.3 Meanwhile, small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) are emerging because of their simpler synthesis, lower batch-to-batch variation, and greater reproducibility in solar cell performance.4,5 To date, state-of-the-art solution-processed SMOSCs have demonstrated PCEs of >8%,6 but their overall performance is still significantly behind that of their polymer counterparts.7 The first step to close this gap in performance is to design better materials in the active layer.
To address this issue, our recently reported molecule TBDT-TTPD containing a central thiophene-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit achieved a high PCE of 4.62% with optimized Voc (0.97 V), Jsc (9.1 mA cm−2) and FF (52%).8 The thiophene-substituted BDT unit with a two-dimensional (2-D) conjugated structure imparts very interesting properties and promising photovoltaic performance. Generally, broad and strong absorption bands can be achieved owing to an extended side chain.9 Also, since 2-D conjugated thiophenes have larger conjugated planes than their one-dimensional conjugated counterparts, better inter-chain overlapping may be formed, and higher charge mobility can be achieved.10 Additionally, the selenophene moiety could enhance the inter-chain interactions between compound chains due to strong Se–Se interactions.11 Furthermore, the inclusion of the selenophene building block could lower the HOMO energy level of the resulting compounds compared to the corresponding thiophene building block.12 Based on these superior properties, Heeger et al. achieved a PCE of 5.30% from an alternating copolymer, P(Se), composed of selenophene and thienopyrrole-4,6-dione.13 Yang and co-workers reported a 4.12% PCE using a selenophene-based polymer, PCDSeBT, in which the diselenienylbenzothiadiazole (DSeBT) monomer alternates with a 2,7-carbazole unit.14 Therefore synthesis based on a selenophene unit could be very interesting as a new building block for donor materials in OPVs. To the best of our knowledge, selenophene-based small molecule materials have rarely been reported.
In this article, we selected the two-dimensional conjugate unit of benzodithiophene (BDT) with selenophenes as the donor unit, and two TPD units as the acceptor units, both covalently attached to the ends of BDT. Long alkyl side groups were attached to the selenophene moiety to ensure solubility, finally forming BDTSe-TTPD, an A–D–A type solution-processed small molecule. On the basis of this molecule, photovoltaic devices were fabricated with o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) or chloroform (CF) as the solvents. The results indicated that the devices prepared from o-DCB exhibited a low short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor, owing to the poor morphology and weak compound stacking. When CF was used, the Jsc and FF were both improved because of the improved nano-scale morphology and well-ordered BDTSe-TTPD crystalline domains. Finally, after active layer thickness optimizations, a PCE of 4.37%, with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 10.5 mA cm−2, and an FF of 46.3% was obtained. This PCE is the highest efficiency reported to date for devices prepared using an alkylselenophene-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) small molecule.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal property

BDTSe-TTPD was synthesized according to Scheme 1. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)selenophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (3) was synthesized by monoalkylation of selenophene, lithiation, nucleophilic addition, reduction and stannylation. 1-(5-Bromothiophen-2-yl)-5-octyl-3-(thiophen-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (5) was obtained by Stille coupling reaction and bromination. BDTSe-TTPD was synthesized using compound 3 and compound 5, via a Stille coupling reaction. The structure of BDTSe-TTPD was fully characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and TOF-MS (Fig. S1–S6, ESI†).

BDTSe-TTPD with ethylhexyl selenophenes exhibits good solubility (>15 mg mL−1) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF). The decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss for BDTSe-TTPD was 419 °C, as shown in Fig. S7,† which provides sufficient thermal stability for solar cell device fabrication.15 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to study the thermal transitions of BDTSe-TTPD. As shown in Fig. S8,† the melting temperature of the compound was observed to be 232 °C and an exothermic peak at 203 °C was shown during cooling, which may be attributed to crystalline behavior.16
Optical properties

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of pure BDTSe-TTPD in CF and in a thin film. The corresponding absorption data are summarized in Table 1. The solution absorption maximum (λmax) located at 489 nm with a molar absorptivity of 34520 L M−1 cm−1. The film absorption was broadened and the λmax was red-shifted to 528 nm with a shoulder increasing at a quite bathochromic-shifted wavelength of 573 nm, indicating strong π–π molecule stacking in the film state.17 The optical band gap (Eoptg) calculated from the film absorption edge was 1.86 eV.

PL spectra of spin-cast films of pure BDTSe-TTPD, and of 1:2 (w/w) blends of the small molecules and PC71BM, were examined to determine their charge transfer properties (Fig. 1b). BDTSe-TTPD showed a strong PL emission band with a maximum at 632 nm. Upon addition of PC71BM, the emission band was almost completely quenched, suggesting ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer from the small molecule to PCBM.18

Fig. 1c shows the absorption of BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM blended films mixed in a 1:1 weight ratio and spin-coated with o-DCB, CB or CF as the solvents, which were used in device preparations. The blended films exhibited a full coverage from 300 to 700 nm, indicating the high light-harvesting ability of the active layer. Compared to the absorption of pure BDTSe-TTPD, the absorption band from 300 to 450 nm resulted mainly from the PC71BM.19 The overall relative absorbance strength in the overall UV-visible range is increased based on the solvent in the following sequence: o-DCB < CB < CF. This result can be ascribed to the strong intermolecular interaction between the small molecule and PCBM,20 which provides higher order in the BDTSe-TTPD and PC71BM domains.
Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was employed to investigate the oxidation behavior of BDTSe-TTPD using a platinum counter electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 (Fig. 2a). The onset oxidation potential was 0.94 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The corresponding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of BDTSe-TTPD was estimated to be −5.34 eV, using the ferrocene reference value of −4.4 eV below the vacuum level.21 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level was determined to be −3.48 eV, using the calculated HOMO value and the optical band gap. These energy levels match well with the acceptor material of PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 2b.

To better understand the oxidative and reductive properties of BDTSe-TTPD, the geometry and electronic structure of BDTSe-TTPD were examined using density functional theory. Becke's three parameter gradient corrected functional (B3LYP) with a polarized 6-31 G** basis was used for full geometry optimization. Methyl alkyl groups were used in place of the long alkyl substituents to limit the computation time. The geometry and the HOMO and LUMO surface plots of the ground-state optimized structures are illustrated in Fig. 3. The HOMO is located predominantly on the BDT core, whereas the LUMO has both thiophene and TPD characteristics. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies of the ground-state optimized geometry of BDTSe-TTPD were −5.03 eV and −2.58 eV, respectively, and the band gap was determined to be 2.45 eV.

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of BDTSe-TTPD, we fabricated bulk heterojunction solar cells using BDTSe-TTPD as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material with a traditional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM/LiF/Al architecture (Fig. 4a). During the preliminary device optimization process, the effect of different BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM active-layer compositions (from 1:0.5 to 1:4 weight ratio) cast from o-DCB was investigated. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under one sun (simulated AM1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4b and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Optimal fabrication conditions were achieved using a BDTSe-TTPD-to-PC71BM ratio of 1:2 (w/w) which gave an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 5.0 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 38.5%, and a PCE of 1.86% (Fig. 4b). Because BDTSe-TTPD has a low-lying HOMO energy level, it produced high Voc values in the solar cell devices.22

In order to study the effect of the solvents on the solar cell performance, thin films of BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM (1:2) were prepared using o-DCB, CB, or CF. Fig. 4c shows the photocurrent densities of the solar cells in which the active layers were prepared with the different solvents. The corresponding performance parameters are summarized in Table 3.

The devices prepared using o-DCB and CB as solvents had PCE = 1.86% (Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 5.30 mA cm−2, and FF = 38.5%) and PCE = 2.98% (Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 8.00 mA cm−2, and FF = 40.5%), respectively, whereas the device spin-coated from CF demonstrated the best performance with PCE = 3.70% (Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 10.00 mA cm−2, and FF = 40.0%). The best performance of the devices prepared using CF was mainly due to the dramatically increased Jsc, which was attributed to the strong light absorption and photo-response (conversion of input photons to photocurrent) as well as the film morphology and nanostructural order (film morphology and nanostructural order will be discussed below). BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM films spin-coated from CF had higher light absorption than the films prepared from o-DCB and CB, which likely contributed to greater exciton and charge generation in the BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM devices prepared using CF.23 Moreover, the photo-response of the BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM solar cells prepared using CF was over 58% at 540 nm, whereas that of the devices prepared from o-DCB and CB were over 36% at 530 nm and about 49% at 532 nm, respectively (Fig. 4d). The best EQE performance of the device spin-coated from CF can be attributed to greater conversion of input photons to photocurrent at all absorption wavelengths, which is consistent with the short circuit current observed.24

Fig. 5a shows the PCE thickness dependence of the active layer. To optimize the PCE of BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM solar cells, the thicknesses of 75 nm, 95 nm, 130 nm, and 160 nm were obtained using different spin-coating conditions. The photovoltaic cell with 95 nm thickness (1500 rpm for 40 s) exhibited an optimized PCE of 4.37% (Voc = 0.90 V, Jsc = 10.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 46.3%). At a thickness of 160 nm, the PCE decreased to 2.61% (Voc = 0.90 V, Jsc = 7.6 mA cm−2, and FF = 38.2%). The BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM solar cells have the tendency of having a reduced Voc, Jsc and FF when the active-layer thickness is larger than 130 nm, as shown in Fig. 5b–d and Table 4.

Hole mobility
Hole mobilities of the BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM films, which were prepared using o-DCB, CB, or CF were evaluated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. The experimental details are described in the Experimental section. As shown in Fig. 6, the average hole mobilities for films casting from o-DCB, CB, and CF were found to be 2.22 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, 7.23 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 3.04 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which is consistent with the trends in Jsc values. Compared to the o-DCB spin-coated device, the hole mobility of the CB spin-coated device improved, which is related to the favorable nano-scale morphology with a distinct pathway. Devices prepared from CF showed a further improvement in hole mobility by an order of 3.04 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is closely related to the intermolecular packing interaction as well as the charge stability when the exciton is separated, leading to an increase in the transporting property of the hole carrier.25

Thin-film morphology
The surface morphology of the BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM blended films, spin-coated from o-DCB, CB or CF were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 7 shows the topographic images collected from the device films prepared with the three solvents. The o-DCB spin-coated films (a) exhibited a relatively formless and flat surface with a root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of 0.75 nm. On the other hand, blended films spin-coated from CB showed weakly aggregated domains and a shortly connected pathway.
 Fig. 7  AFM topographic images of the BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM blended films prepared from (a) o-DCB, (b) CB, and (c) CF, respectively. 
When CF was used as the solvent (c), clear phase-separated, highly long path, and ordered networks with longer connected pathways and a large RMS roughness of 1.60 nm were observed. This most likely originated from the enhanced intermolecular interaction between the BDTSe-TTPD molecules26 as was also evidenced by the optical properties and hole mobilities. The improved short circuit current can clearly be examined through this better organized bulk heterojunction network structure, which is the key requirement of efficient charge separation and transport,27 highly improved short circuit current can clearly be explained.
Molecule stacking
In order to obtain insightful information concerning the molecular packing in the blended films with PC71BM, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (out-of-plane and in-plane) of the BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM films, prepared using o-DCB, CB, or CF, were compared (see Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8a, compared to the o-DCB spin-coated blend film, the CB spin-coated film shows a longer-range crystalline structure, and exhibits a weak second order lamellar reflection (2θ = 3.41°) with a corresponding interlayer d-spacing distance of 18.02 Å. For the BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM films prepared from CF, stronger crystalline diffraction peaks with second order diffraction of high intensity were observed, suggesting that the CF spin-coated film has much more crystalline order.28 These findings indicate that the blended film prepared using CF were comprised of high-order BDTSe-TTPD crystallites and agree well with the film morphology findings regarding crystallinity. Also, the presence of PC71BM can be clearly seen by the peak at 12.9° in the CF spin-coated film, which indicates that PCBM domains were more ordered.
 Fig. 8  Out-of-plane (a) and in-plane (b) XRD patterns of BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM blend films prepared from different solvents. 
For the in-plane XRD patterns (Fig. 8b), the trends in the diffraction patterns were similar to the out-of-plane and in-plane directions. It should be noted that the CF spin-coated film showed high-order crystalline planes and distinct π–π stacking diffraction (2θ = 17.12°, π–π stacking distance = 3.59 Å). However, the blended films prepared using o-DCB or CB exhibited diffractions without clear peaks or with very weak crystalline peaks, respectively, indicating that the BDTSe-TTPD crystallites were absent or had significantly weak intermolecular stacking in the in-plain direction.29 The dominant long-range ordering and strong π–π stacking of BDTSe-TTPD in the blended film prepared using CF enables efficient charge transport, which would explain why devices spin-coated from CF showed an almost two-fold increase in the PCE and had superior performance compared to those spin coated from the o-DCB and CB.30
Conclusions
A solution-processed small molecule solar cell based on alkylselenophene-substituted benzodithiophene, namely, BDTSe-TTPD was designed and synthesized. The A–D–A type molecule has broad absorption and has the HOMO level of −5.34 eV and the LUMO level of −3.48 eV, which align well with that of PC71BM. Solvents including o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF) were used for the spin-coating, to fabricate photovoltaic devices with BDTSe-TTPD as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material. Finally, by using CF as the solvent, an optimized device with 95 nm active layer thickness was obtained, enabling a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 10.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 46.3%, and a PCE of 4.37%. Our results reveal that a suitable molecular design (i.e., incorporation of the 2D conjugated selenophene unit in between two TPD moieties) and careful optimizations of the film morphologies by changing the spin-coating solvents will be one way toward highly efficient selenophene-based small molecule solar cells.

Measurements and characterizations

1H-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AM-200 spectrometer. 13C-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Advance-300 spectrometer. HRMS (EI) spectra were recorded using a high resolution GC mass spectrometer with LabRAM HR800 UV. Mass (MALDI-TOF/TOF) spectra were recorded using a high resolution 4800 TOF/TOF mass spectrometer with Voyager DE-STR. The thermal analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA TGA 2100 thermogravimetric analyzer under purified nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted under nitrogen using a TA Instruments 2100 DSC. The sample was heated with 10 °C min−1 from 50 to 300 °C. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Carry 5000 UV-vis-near-IR double beam spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a FP-6500 (JASCO). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a PowerLab/AD instrument model system in 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A glassy carbon disk (∼0.05 cm2) coated with a thin small molecule film, an Ag/AgCl electrode, and a platinum wire were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory using the Spartan 08 computational programs. The atomic force microscope (AFM) (Multimode IIIa, Digital Instruments) was operated in tapping mode to obtain surface images (surface area: 5 × 5 μm2) of the small molecule:PCBM blend films under ambient conditions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at the 5A beamline (wavelength = 1.071 Å) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Korea. The small molecule:PCBM blended films were prepared on a Si/PEDOT:PSS substrate by a spin-coating method.
Fabrication and characterization of organic solar cells
The devices were fabricated with a conventional structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer(BDTSe-TTPD:PCBM)/LiF/Al using a solution process. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultrasonication for 20 min each and subsequently dried by a nitrogen blow. A thin layer (∼40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083, filtered at 0.45 μm PVDF) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm onto the ITO surface. After being baked at 120 °C for 20 min, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Subsequently, the active layer (∼100 nm) was spin-coated from donor–acceptor blend solutions (40 mg mL−1) with different ratios and solvents at 1000 rpm. Finally, 0.8 nm LiF and 80 nm Al layers were deposited on the active layer under high vacuum (2 × 10−6 Torr). The effective area of each cell was ∼9 mm2 defined by the mask. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of photovoltaic devices were measured under ambient conditions, using a Keithley Model 2400 source-measurement unit. An Oriel xenon lamp (450 W) with an AM1.5G filter was used as the solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2, using a calibrated silicon cell with a KG5 filter, which is traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (LREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained by using a photomodulation spectroscopic set-up (model Merlin, Oriel), a calibrated Si UV detector, and a SR570 low noise current amplifier.
Hole mobility measurement
The hole only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDTSe-TTPD:PC71BM/Au. The Au layer was deposited under a low speed (s−1) to avoid the penetration of Au atoms into the active layer. The active layers were spin-coated with o-DCB, CB, and CF, respectively. Mobilities were calculated by fitting the current–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current).  where J is the current density, L is the film thickness of the active layer, μh is the hole mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, V is the internal voltage in the device and V = Vappl − Vr − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vr is the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the relative work function difference of the two electrodes. The Vbi can be determined from the transition between the ohmic region and the SCLC region.
Materials

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), n-BuLi, toluene, chloroform, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, zinc powder and trimethyltin chloride were purchased from Aldrich, Alpha, and Langchem Inc. All these chemicals were used without further purification.
Synthesis of small molecule

2-(2-Ethylhexyl)selenophene (1). 
To a solution of selenophene (30.00 g, 0.228 mol) in THF 400 mL was added n-BuLi (109.20 mL, 2.5 M in hexanes, 0.273 mol) at 0 °C. After 30 min, the mixture was cooled down to −15 °C and 3-(bromomethyl)heptane (52.72 g, 0.273 mol) was added. The mixture was heated at 50 °C and stirred for 12 h. Then it was hydrolyzed with a saturated solution of NH4Cl and extracted with diethyl ether. The organic layer was dried and evaporated, the residue was purified by chromatography using a silica gel column with hexane–CH2Cl2 (20:1) as the eluent to give compound 1 (31.00 g, 56%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD2Cl2): δ = 7.85 (d, 1H), 7.16 (d, 1H), 6.96 (d, 1H), 2.88 (d, 2H), 1.42 (m, 1H), 1.39–1.30 (br, 8H), 0.93 (t, 6H).
