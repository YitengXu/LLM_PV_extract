We estimate the cost-per-Watt ($ per Wp) as a function of power conversion efficiency (PCE) for an archetypal OPV structure and find that a relatively simple molecule requiring only 3 synthetic steps will contribute a cost of 0.001 to 0.01 $ per Wp, given a solar module PCE of 10%. In contrast, a relatively complicated molecule requiring 14 synthetic steps will contribute costs in the range of 0.075 to 0.48 $ per Wp.

Introduction
The development of organic photovoltaics (OPV) is widely considered to be a viable route for the realization of low-cost renewable energy.1 There are several factors that justify this optimism. The inherent low cost of many organic semiconductors including small molecules and conjugated polymers, combined with the compatibility of these materials with low-temperature processing techniques, suggests the possibility to realize a new generation of inexpensive PV modules. The considerable progress in improving the performance of OPV structures over the past decade (see Table 1), has led to a recent report on a polymer-based tandem solar cell structure, for example, which has demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 8%.2 It is expected that the engineering of new organic materials and device structures may yield even greater photovoltaic performance in the coming decades.3

Considerable attention is now focused on developing specialized organic semiconductors that are engineered to serve as active layer materials in OPV structures.4 These efforts aim to enable high performance by realizing materials that simultaneously exhibit high optical absorption coefficients, high carrier mobilities and carefully engineered energy band alignments suitable for exciton dissociation. Presently, much of this work is conducted at a relatively small scale, conducive to laboratory experiments. However, a successful and broadly deployable OPV technology will require the chemical synthesis of the constituent active materials to be scaled from the level of grams-of-product to thousands-of-kilograms, sufficient for the widespread deployment of OPVs.‡ Simultaneously, these large-scale synthetic processes must achieve low enough material costs to represent only a small contribution to the cost of the solar cell module. This scalability challenge is the focus of the analysis of the present study. In particular, we focus on donor materials, which are generally the most structurally complex organic constituents of OPV structures.
Some insight into the large-scale production of photoactive OPV materials may be gained by consideration of pharmaceutical drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs, which are often complex molecular compounds that require multi-step syntheses, are similarly subject to imperatives for large-scale and low-cost manufacturing processes. In the pharmaceutical industry, the “synthetic accessibility” of prospective target molecules is of paramount concern as it strongly affects the cost and environmental impact of the manufacturing process required to synthesize appropriate quantities of a particular drug.5 Synthetic accessibility refers to the various factors that determine the ease with which a particular molecule can be synthesized. These include the commercial availability and/or accessibility of reagents, the number and difficulty of synthetic steps, the stability of intermediate products, the potential for combining steps together (“telescoping”), and yield.6 Although achieving high synthetic accessibility is recognized to be critical to the pharmaceutical industry, very little consideration has so far been given to the importance of this quality with regard to prospective materials for organic solar cells. For a broad deployment of OPV technologies, the photoactive materials would need to be synthesized at an even larger scale than pharmaceutical drugs to meet global energy needs.
In this work, we investigate the relationship between synthetic accessibility and material cost for several OPV materials. One of the challenges associated with addressing this topic is that very little data on specific synthetic routes is publicly available for large-scale procedures used in industry. This is due in part to a lack of relevant case studies of scaled OPV materials and also to the sensitive and competitive nature of such proprietary details. Here, we address this problem by basing our study on small-scale procedures that are available in published literature. We present a detailed quantitative analysis that takes into account all of the material inputs to these procedures in order to estimate the total material costs for several photoactive materials. We then assume an archetypal OPV structure to consider how these material costs would affect the commercial viability of OPV structures as a function of solar cell efficiency.
Methods
Materials of interest
We consider nine organic materials of interest (see Fig. 1) that span a wide range of complexity and synthetic accessibility. These include the small molecules CuPc,15,20SQ,14,21DBP17 and DTS,8 as well as the polymers P3HT,13PDPP3T,16PTB111 and PBDTTPD.10 Each of these materials has been used in OPV demonstrations, as summarized in Table 1. Although not explicitly of interest for organic solar cells, we also include the small molecule, Alq3, which is an archetypical electron-transporting material in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)22 and has been a benchmark organic optoelectronics material since the 1980's.
 Fig. 1  Organic molecules considered in this study. 
A relatively inexpensive OPV material is copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), which is a broadly used electron donor material for organic solar cells.15,20,23 The synthesis of CuPc consists of a single step.24 Due to its widespread use as a colorant and pigment, CuPc is already manufactured at a scale of millions of kg-per-year, and is available for less than 1 dollar-per-gram.25 In contrast, many of the most promising OPV active layer materials involve highly specialized and complex synthetic procedures and are consequently available only in small quantities and at a relatively high cost. A representative example is the polymeric material PTB1, which was used as an electron donor to realize an OPV structure with a PCE of 5.3%.11 Due to its highly specialized nature and relatively complicated synthesis, which consists of 14 individual steps,26–29 this molecule is presently available only from a single supplier at a cost of several thousand dollars-per-gram.
Synthetic accessibility
There are several factors that affect the synthetic accessibility of a molecule. Among these are a variety of chemical as well as logistical considerations. The lack of a rigorous definition for this quality makes its determination and comparison among different molecules a non-trivial task.5 For simplicity, we use the number of synthetic steps (here delineated by the number of explicit isolations required during synthesis) needed to produce the material as a metric for its synthetic accessibility; the greater the number of steps, the less “accessible” the molecule is to industry.6 This choice enables us to compare and quantify the complexity of different molecules in a very simple and intuitive manner. One qualification, however, pertains to the choice of starting material for each of the synthetic procedures. For the procedures considered in this study, we regard the beginning of the procedure to be the point at which the starting materials are simple molecules that are currently available from bulk chemical suppliers. However, recognizing the shifting nature of small chemical enterprises, we estimate a ±2 step error in our analysis.
We identified detailed literature procedures for the synthesis of each of the molecules shown in Fig. 1. In each case, we chose synthetic routes with the highest overall yields if multiple reported synthetic methods were available. The procedures for CuPc, P3HT and PTB1, representing a range of complexity, are shown in Schemes 1–3. Schemes describing the synthesis of the remaining molecules (SQ, DBP, Alq3, DTS, PDPP3T and PBDTTPD) are available in the ESI.† The number of synthetic steps for each molecule was extracted from these schemes.

 Scheme 3  Synthesis of PTB1. Circled numbers represent specific workup procedures, as described in the text. 
Isolation and purification
An important aspect of synthetic procedures is the isolation (often termed “work-up”) and purification of desired products from a crude reaction mixture (see ESI for additional discussion†). With regard to our analysis, consideration of workup and purification operations adds considerably to the material inputs and waste outputs for each procedure. To ensure a fair comparison among different synthetic routes, we created a framework with which to evaluate the material requirements for these workup and purification steps. We include operations for (1) quenching/neutralization, (2) extraction, (3) column chromatography, (4) recrystallization and (5) distillation/sublimation. The details for each type of workup procedure are based on standard organic laboratory techniques30 and are elaborated individually below.

1 Quenching/neutralization. 
These procedures were evaluated on a case-by-case basis. One-to-one molar equivalents of acid, base, or water were assumed to be necessary to neutralize reactive reaction intermediates or side-products, as necessary.


2 Extraction. 
The use of 150 mL solvent (three individual 50 mL extractions) and 1 g of a drying agent (Na2SO4, or MgSO4) is assumed to be necessary to extract 1 g of crude product from a reaction mixture. These numbers are proposed as an upper limit to the total solvent and material use necessary to isolate the product of a reaction.


3 Column chromatography. 
An ideal separation ratio (Rf > 0.3) and sample loading is assumed.31 We assume 2.5 g sample and 1 L of effluent are used in a column that is 20 cm long 50 mm in diameter. We assume that 60 μm SiO2 particles are used.


4 Recrystallization. 
We assume 1 g product needs 100 mL solvent and that the procedure is performed only once.


5 Distillation/sublimation. 
We assume no solvent or chemical waste; only energy input.
The requirement for a workup or purification procedure following a synthetic step is indicated by a circled number (corresponding to one of the procedures described above) in Schemes 1–3.
We note that an implicit assumption of this framework is that the quantities of materials required for workup will scale linearly, from the gram-scale to scale of thousands-of-kilograms. This may not necessarily be valid, however. Optimization of the synthetic routes and of the process chemistry at the plant-level may enable considerable economies of scale. For example, there may be opportunities for multiple steps to be combined together to reduce the number of explicit isolation steps (“telescoping”).6 Additionally, solvents may be recycled and reused for parts of synthetic procedures. On this basis, we may regard our cost calculations, with and without the inclusion of costs associated with workup/purification, to provide “worst” and “best”-case scenarios, respectively, for the large-scale production of OPV active materials. Ideally, all of the synthetic steps would be collapsible into a single reaction with minimal costs for workup and purification. In contrast, a procedure with little potential for optimization may, in the worst case scenario, be subject to our full estimate for the cost of required workup and purification procedures.

Cost model
For each synthetic step, the quantities of input materials (reagents and solvents) and the reaction yield were identified in order to build a model for the synthesis of each molecule. Additionally, the material inputs required to execute each of indicated workup and purification procedures contribute to these models. We then calculate the quantities of each input material needed in order to produce a given quantity of product. As an example, our model for the synthesis of P3HT is represented graphically as a flowchart in Fig. 2. The first box in the flowchart represents the starting material, 3-bromothiophene. Red arrows indicate reagents, green arrows indicate solvents and blue arrows indicate additional materials required for workup. The indicated quantities of input materials and waste are calculated to produce a kilogram of product. Flowcharts describing the synthesis of the other molecules shown in Fig. 1 are available in the ESI.†
 Fig. 2  Flowchart describing the synthesis of 1 kg of P3HT. The requisite quantities of reagent (red arrow), solvents (green arrow) and work-up materials (blue arrow) are indicated for each step. 
To determine the material costs, we created a database of quotes from major chemical suppliers for each of the materials used in the synthetic procedures investigated herein (see ESI†). For each step, the input material prices were multiplied by the required quantity to determine the material cost. The sum of each of the input material costs for each step was then calculated to determine the total material cost of the entire procedure. This quantity was calculated for cases that both include and exclude workup/purification costs (the “worst” and “best”-case scenarios).
An important assumption of this model is that the prices for these starting materials, reagents and solvents will remain invariant to fluctuations in their supply and demand. A considerable reduction in raw material costs, however, may result from a major industrial effort to scale the production of particular OPV materials, as will be discussed later. We also note that the material costs that we consider represent only one component of the overall cost to produce these materials. In the case of pharmaceutical drugs, for example, materials only account for 20–45% of the cost of drug synthesis. The balance includes contributions for labor, capital, utilities, maintenance, waste treatment, taxes, insurance, and various overhead charges.6
Results and discussion
Cost-per-gram as a function of synthetic complexity
The results from our models for each synthetic procedure are summarized in Table 2. Note that calculations are presented for two possible synthetic routes of PDPP3T. These routes are described in the ESI.† From Table 2, a clear trend is evident of increasing cost-per-gram (Cg) with increasing synthetic complexity (number of steps). This applies to the scenario that includes our scaled workup/purification procedures as well as the “best”-case scenario in which the workup procedures are omitted. These trends are plotted in Fig. 3. The linear fits to the data (solid lines going through (0,0) data point) reveal slopes of 6.39 $ per gram step and 31.00 $ per gram step for the best (Adj. R-squared = 0.72) and worst-case (Adj. R-squared = 0.91) scenarios, respectively. We note that, although these fits faithfully represent the trend of increasing cost with increasing complexity, they overestimate the costs that are predicted for the simplest molecules such as CuPc and P3HT.

Cost-per-peak-Watt as a function of OPV efficiency
We note that several studies have investigated the overall cost breakdown for specific organic solar cell technologies including structures based on CuPc25 and various polythiophenes.47–50 The OPV active materials were found to contribute 5–10% of the materials cost for P3HT/PCBM structures50 and 10–20% for CuPc/C60 structures.25 In both cases, the dominant component of the materials cost was identified to be the substrate and transparent conducting oxide (TCO). We also note that, in addition to the cost of materials themselves, an important consideration is the cost of processing these materials into the various layers that constitute the OPV structure. Sufficiently fast and inexpensive manufacturing techniques will be critical to achieving commercial viability, as discussed by Krebs et. al.47,49
Here, we restrict our attention specifically to the contribution of the active donor material to the ultimate solar cell cost in order to assess the impact that synthetic accessibility has on commercial viability. Specifically, we investigate how the scaling of the material cost with synthetic complexity would affect the cost-per-peak-Watt ($ per Wp, denoted here as CW) of an archetypal OPV structure. To be an attractive material for OPV, the cost contribution of an organic donor material should be much less than the total cost of the OPV module. For example, we may consider the case of CdTe, for which the active layer material cost contributes in the range of 1–10% of the module cost51 and silicon, in which the active material cost contributes 15–20% of the module cost.52 For the active layer material cost to be truly regarded as negligible, we identify an active layer material cost target to be 1% of the module cost. For reference, we also consider a more relaxed target of 10% of the module cost. With these targets, and assuming a target module cost of 0.50 $ per Wp,53 the individual active layer material price should ideally be less than 0.005 or 0.050 $ per Wp. We consider a cell in which the thickness of the donor material (t) is 100 nm, and in which the density of the donor material, ρ, is 1.1 g cm−3.54 We assume that the wastage of material during processing at scale is negligible. We calculate the CW using the following equation:CW = (Cg × ρ × t)/(η × I)here, η is the efficiency of the solar cell, Cg is cost-per-gram and I is the solar insolation under peak conditions, assumed to be 1000 W m−2. Resulting curves for CW as a function of solar cell efficiency are shown in Fig. 4. Here we only consider CuPc, P3HT and PTB1, as representatives of molecules with varying synthetic complexity (1, 3 and 14 steps, respectively). In the worst-case scenario, in which the material costs include scaled estimates for workup/purification procedures, we find that only the simplest molecule, CuPc, will contribute a cost of less than 0.005 $ per Wp, assuming that the OPV PCE is greater than 1.8%. In the best-case scenario, in which workup/purification costs are assumed to be optimized to zero, we find that both CuPc and P3HT will meet this criteria provided that solar cell efficiencies of 1.8% and 8.0% can be achieved, respectively. We note that in both scenarios the most complex molecule, PTB1, fails to reach this threshold, even for PCEs as high as 30%. Plots of CW as a function of solar cell efficiency for SQ, Alq3, DBP, DTS, PDPP3T and PBDTTPD are shown in the ESI.† Among these, only Alq3 is calculated to present a negligible cost in the worst-case scenario (CW < 0.005 $ per Wp when η > 9.6%). In the best-case scenario, the costs of the simplest molecules including Alq3 (1 step), SQ (2 steps) and DBP (3 steps) would become negligible provided efficiencies of 1%, 13% and 17.4%, respectively. Again, however, the molecules requiring the most complex synthetic procedures, PDPP3T (6 steps), DTS (8 steps) and PBDTTPD (10 steps), would represent a considerable fraction of the OPV module cost (CW > 0.005 $ per Wp). These results suggest that consideration of synthetic accessibility with regard to OPV active layer materials may be critical to achieving an inexpensive and scalable OPV technology. Additionally, these results emphasize the importance of optimizing the process chemistry of these synthetic procedures to minimize the use of reagent and solvent, as well as the number of individual synthetic steps. Based on the cases considered here in the best-case scenario, only molecules with fewer than 6 synthetic steps are found to represent a small component to the cost of a hypothetical OPV module.

(a) Includes the cost of reagents, solvents and work-up procedures. (b) Includes only the cost of reagents and solvents. The red dashed lines indicate 0.005 and 0.050-dollars-per-peak-Watt. 
One important driver in this analysis is the amount of material required to realize an OPV module. Here, a single-junction effective donor thickness of 100 nm was assumed. Different device architectures, however, may require more or less material, thus affecting cost. In a multijunction OPV architecture, for example, donor and acceptor materials would be needed for each sub-cell in the stack. This would effectively multiply the OPV active layer material costs by the number of sub-cells.
An additional driver that might alter the outcome of this analysis is scale. As mentioned previously, a critical assumption is that prices for starting materials, reagents and solvents will remain invariant to fluctuations in their supply and demand. Sufficient economies of scale, however, may enable considerable price reductions for input materials. As an example, we may consider the case of CuPc, which is produced at the scale of millions of kg-per-year. CuPc may presently be purchased in bulk from a major chemical company for less than 0.10 $ per g, or approximately an order of magnitude less than the cost calculated here in our best-case scenario. This suggests a significant economic advantage to industrial synthesis at a very large scale, which may make the commercial outlook for molecules like those considered in this study much more favorable. It is unclear at this time, however, how economies of scale might affect the cost of more complicated molecules.
Summary
We presented a cost analysis for the synthesis of several promising OPV active layers by quantifying material costs of their published small-scale synthetic routes. The material cost in dollars-per-gram ($ per g) is found to linearly increase with the number of synthetic steps required to produce each material. By estimating the cost-per-peak-Watt ($ per Wp) as a function of power conversion efficiency of an archetypal OPV structure, we find that only relatively simple molecules (<6 synthetic steps) will contribute negligibly to the cost of an OPV module. The synthesis of P3HT (consisting of 3 synthetic steps), for example, is found to contribute a cost of 0.004 to 0.02 $ per Wp, given an OPV PCE of 10%. In contrast, PTB1 (14 synthetic steps) contributes costs of 0.075 to 0.48 $ per Wp. Our findings suggest that the commercial viability of an OPV technology may critically depend on the synthetic complexity of its constituent active layer materials, although economies of scale will likely improve the commercial outlook for these materials. Additionally, this work stresses the importance of optimizing synthetic routes to minimize solvent and reagent usage as well as minimizing the number of required workup procedures.

Broader context
For organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to become a viable source of renewable energy, the synthesis of organic active-layer materials will need to be scaled to thousands of kilograms. Additionally, the ultimate cost of these materials will need to be low enough to constitute only a small fraction of the cost of the solar cell module. In this study, we present a quantitative analysis, based on published small-scale synthetic procedures, to estimate the materials costs for several promising OPV materials. The cost in dollars-per-gram ($ per g) is found to increase linearly with the number of synthetic steps required to produce each organic photoactive compound. We estimate the cost-per-Watt ($ per Wp) as a function of power conversion efficiency (PCE) for an archetypal OPV structure and find that relatively complicated molecules (>6 synthetic steps) may represent a considerable fraction of the cost of an organic solar cell. Our findings suggest that the commercial viability of an OPV technology may depend on the synthetic accessibility of its constituent active layer materials. Additionally, this work stresses the importance of optimizing synthetic routes to minimize solvent and reagent usage as well as to minimize the number of required workup procedures in the scaled production of OPV materials.
