    , Accepted 12th October 2020First published on 12th October 2020AbstractThe ternary metal halide perovskites have gradually attracted attention for application in the optoelectronic field, owing to their tunable crystal structure and appropriate bandgap. Lead free Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite, with a 0D layered structure containing molecular [Bi2I9]3− dimers, exhibits prominent optical and electrical anisotropies. Here, the anisotropic properties of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals were evaluated using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS); meanwhile, the effect of phonon vibration on the THz transmission was confirmed using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Accordingly, the refractive index and extinction coefficient are estimated using THz-TDS, thanks to the high transmission in the range of 0.2–0.9 THz. The anisotropic refractive index was observed for the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals, and was found to be 3.2–3.7 for the (100) plane (CBI(100)) in contrast to 2.8–3.2 for the (001) plane (CBI(001)). Furthermore, the Lorentz model was employed to extract the dielectric constant of Cs3Bi2I9, in which anisotropy is obviously indicated by the static dielectric constant and the high-frequency dielectric constant. These anisotropic behaviors are determined by the dipole moment, which is attributed to the anisotropic packing density of [Bi2I9]3− dimers. This study is significant and provides a deeper insight into the anisotropic photoelectric properties of Cs3Bi2I9, thus contributing to the development of metal halide perovskites in the field of optoelectronics.
Introduction
The free-Pb halide perovskite A3Bi2I9 (A = CH3NH3, NH4, Cs) has been successfully applied for use in photoelectric devices, especially for solar cells and the detection of nuclear radiation,1–7 owing to the relatively high power conversion efficiency, the ability to exhibit interactions with high-energy photons and the high chemical stability. Recently, the anisotropic optical and electrical performance of A3Bi2I9 has attracted significant attention because the [Bi2I9]3− dimer is stacked in a close-packed fashion in the (001) plane. The X-ray anisotropic imaging abilities for the 0D-structure (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 crystal have been revealed.8 The (TMHD)BiBr5 crystal shows a significantly higher photocurrent along the 1D chain compared to that in the other direction.9 Moreover, Zhuang et al. reported the anisotropies of the X-ray response of the 2D layered (NH4)3Bi2I9 crystal.10 Also, previous results have revealed the significantly anisotropic behaviors of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals in the photoelectric field.1,2,4,11 However, to date, most of the investigations on anisotropic behaviors have mainly been focused on the phenomenon, and further insights into the intrinsic mechanism are limited owing to the absence of suitable testing methods. Actually, the photoelectric characteristics of materials depend significantly on the dielectric properties.12–15
Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is capable of detecting the dielectric properties of semiconductors as a complementary photoelectric technology.16–20 For the classic semiconductor materials, THz-TDS has been widely used as a non-contact method to evaluate the temperature and frequency-dependent optical constants for LiNbO3,21 GaAs22 and ZnTe17 crystals. For the 2D semiconductor materials such as MoS2, the complex dielectric constant was found to be in agreement with the Drude model in the THz region owing to the intrinsic carrier absorption.13 Simultaneously, THz-TDS was employed to evaluate the metal halide perovskite films and quantum dots, which promotes their further application in solar cells and luminescent materials.15,23–28 The dielectric properties can only be further analyzed if the material has a certain transmission capacity in the THz region. Compared with the thin thickness of the film and quantum dots, the limitation of most bulk crystals is due to the issues regarding the strong absorption of the THz wave. Reduced absorption can be achieved by thinning the sample, but it is difficult for most perovskite crystals owing to the poor mechanical properties.
In this paper, we emphasize the dielectric properties of Cs3Bi2I9 bulk crystals grown using the vertical Bridgman method, which are systematically analyzed using THz-TDS. The THz transmittance is also explained through the calculated infrared (IR) absorption spectrum using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The complex refractive indexes of Cs3Bi2I9 were calculated by comparing the THz transmission spectrum of the sample and the reference. The dielectric constants of Cs3Bi2I9 were extracted using Lorentz model fitting. The anisotropic dielectric behaviors of the different crystal planes are discussed in Cs3Bi2I9. Our work provides the fundamental dielectric properties of Cs3Bi2I9 and in turn promotes their optoelectronic applications.
Experimental details
Materials
High quality Cs3Bi2I9 ingots were grown using the vertical Bridgman method. As-grown Cs3Bi2I9 wafers, free from twin and grain boundaries, were sliced parallel to the (001) (CBI(001)) and (100) (CBI(100)) faces. The surface damaged layer, caused by cutting, was removed by lapping, and mechanical and fine chemo-mechanical polishing, consecutively. Abrasive paper and a velvet polishing pad were used to polish the wafer, and “Water Displacement, 40th formula” (WD-40) was used for lubrication. After polishing, absolute ethyl alcohol was used to remove the WD-40 residue and to clean the surface. The thickness of CBI(100) was 745 ± 5 μm and that of CBI(001) was 815 ± 5 μm.
Terahertz spectroscopy
A mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser with a central wavelength of 800 nm and a pulse duration of 100 fs was equipped for a home-built THz-TDS set-up. The laser beam, with an 80 MHz repetition frequency and 12.7 mW mm−2 power density, was split into two using a beam splitter. The first beam was used for generating THz wave radiation with a GaAs photoconductivity switch and the second beam was used for detecting the THz wave with a 〈110〉 ZnTe crystal. With parabolic mirrors, the THz signal was focused onto CBI(001) and CBI(100), which was mounted on a rotation stage. The incident direction of the THz wave is perpendicular to the crystal surface, and the spot size of the THz wave (∼0.7 mm2) is smaller than that of the crystal samples. In the THz-TDS measurement, the amplitude and phase of the THz wave in the frequency domain can be obtained by Fourier transform. The experiments were conducted in the range of 0.1–4.0 THz at room temperature (300 K).
Computational method
In the framework of density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), our calculation was performed using the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program,29 a part of the Materials Studio package from Accelrys. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)30 functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used as the exchange–correlation functional. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave expansion was set at 550 eV. The Brillouin zone (BZ) was sampled using a 4 × 4 × 2 k-point mesh for the unit cell of Cs3Bi2I9. During structural relaxation, the energy convergence criterion was set to 10−8 eV per unit cell, and the lattice constants and the atom coordinates were optimized until the convergence of the force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1. For calculation of the phonon spectrum structure, the high symmetry path was assumed from Γ (0, 0, 0) to A (0, 0, 0.5), H (−0.333, 0.667, 0.5), K (−0.333, 0.667, 0), Γ (0, 0, 0), M (0, 0.5, 0) and L (0, 0.5, 0.5).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the typical Cs3Bi2I9 crystals with dimensions of Φ 15 × 60 mm3. Different crystal facets were obtained by directional cutting and the schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1b. The polished wafers of CBI(001) and CBI(100) are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively, the crystallographic orientations of which were determined using the X-ray diffractometry (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1e. Unlike most perovskite structures of shared corners or coplanar octahedral structures, the [Bi2I9]3− dimers were connected by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces instead of Bi–I chemical bonds in the c direction. The arrangement of the [Bi2I9]3− dimers in various directions along CBI(001) and CBI(100) are shown in Fig. 1f and g, respectively.

Fig. 2a presents the THz time-domain waveforms of the reference signal and the response for the Cs3Bi2I9 crystal. The complex transfer function of the THz wave through the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals can be expressed as13 (1)In which ñ(ω) = n(ω) − iκ(ω) is the complex refractive index (n the real refractive index and κ is the extinction coefficient), d is the thickness of the crystals, c is the velocity of light in a vacuum, and ρ(ω) and −ϕ(ω) are the modulus and the phase of the complex transfer function. FP(ω) is the Fabry–Perot (FP) factor which is expressed as31 (2)in which j is an integer called the echo order and r represents the maximum echo order. In order to simplify the parameter extraction, the FP etalon effect is first eliminated by windowing the THz time domain wave to isolate the main peak by setting the FP(ω) to 1 for the iteration, as shown in Fig. 2b.

(f) Relative error spectrum of transmitted signal obtained through a repeatability test. 
The frequency domain spectrum was obtained using fast Fourier transform (FFT) (see Fig. 2c). It was observed that the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals have a good transmission ability in the low THz frequency region. The Cs3Bi2I9 crystals have a transmission characteristic up to 1.0 THz with a maximum of around 0.5 THz. The low transmittance in the high frequency THz was a result of the obvious phonon absorption. DFT was used to analyze the phonon vibration of point Γ in the first Brillouin region (Fig. 2d). The calculated IR absorption spectrum in the range of 0.1–4.0 THz is shown in Fig. 2e. There are four main absorption peaks, which are located at 0.89, 1.78, 2.68 and 2.95 THz, resulting in the narrow transmission bandwidth of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystals in the THz region. This is consistent with the trend found in the THz transmission spectrum. In addition, several repeated experiments were performed in the procedure described above, in order to obtain an estimate of the confidence of the data presented in the following. The relative differences between these results are presented in Fig. 2f in which one can see that our signal amplitude is accurate within a 2% relative error in the 0.2–0.9 THz domain. Therefore, the detailed discussion presented in the following concerns only the highly reliable region of our data.
The H(ω) can be obtained by comparing the reference signal with the sample signal after FFT. Generally, it is awkward to analytically solve eqn (1) to obtain the real refractive index and the extinction coefficient, but approximate solutions can be obtained, assuming n ≫ κ (generally n/κ ≥ 10032). The approximate solutions can then be evaluated using:13 (3) (4)
The refractive index ranges from 3.2 to 3.7 for CBI(100), in contrast with the values of 2.8–3.2 obtained for CBI(001) (see Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows the extinction coefficients for CBI(100) and CBI(100). It was found that the obtained values for n and κ contradict the assumed condition of n ≫ κ. An iterative approach (using the global search function implemented in MATLAB) to solve eqn (1) was therefore used to evaluate the exact values of the refractive index and extinction coefficient. The squares in Fig. 3a and b show the exact values obtained from the iterative algorithm. The two sets of results show similar behaviors and, in fact, a reasonable agreement.

The solid lines correspond to the approximate solutions of the eqn (3) and (4), and the squares show the accurate values obtained from the exact iterative algorithm (global search function implemented in MATLAB). 
The difference in the refractive index is mainly attributed to the electric dipole moment per unit volume (),33 which is relative to atoms packing density, and can be expressed as follows:  = Nq(5)In which N is the electron density per unit volume, q is the electric charge and  is the vector between the positive and negative charges. The distinct electric dipole moments were mainly attributed to the difference in packing densities of the [Bi2I9]3− dimers.34 The electric dipole moments are larger in CBI(100), hence CBI(100) ultimately has a higher refractive index.12 The extinction coefficient determines the absorption coefficient and the high extinction coefficient leads to low transmittance. This provides the basis for discussing the theoretical transmittance variations of the crystal.
From the complex refractive index of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystal, the complex dielectric constant can be subsequently obtained. The real dielectric constant increases significantly with the increasing frequency, as seen in Fig. 4a, which exhibits a similar dispersion trend to that of the refractive index, owing to the small extinction coefficient. The real part of CBI(100) is 10.0–16.0, while that of CBI(001) is only 8.0–11.0 in 0.2–0.9 THz. One can observe that the real part of the dielectric constant exhibits a significant increase (≈50%) for different crystal directions. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant increases with the frequency, following the trend observed for the extinction coefficient in Fig. 4b. These anisotropic dielectric behaviors originate from the significant differences in the [Bi2I9]3− packing density along the different directions in Cs3Bi2I9, and the larger packing density results in a significant increase of the dipole moment.

The Lorentz model is a model usually adopted to analyze the dielectric property which is applicable for intrinsic semiconductors and insulators. The Lorentz model is based on the damped harmonic oscillator and could account for the phonon-induced THz absorption via the interaction between the radiation field and lattice vibration. The dielectric function in the format of the Lorentz model can be described as follows (6)In which ε∞ and ε0 are the high frequency and static dielectric constant, respectively, ω0 is the phonon oscillation frequency and γ0 is the damping constant of the phonon, which denotes the resonance frequency (damping factor) of a ΓO phonon mode at the center of the Brillouin zone. The real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant of Cs3Bi2I9 is presented in Fig. 4, and the four parameters (ε∞, ε0, ω0 and γ0) used in the fitting procedure, including the sensitivity of the 95% confidence interval (CI), are listed in Table 1. A very reasonable agreement can be observed between this model and our experimental data, as well as significant differences for different crystal planes.

ε
0 is related to the electron displacement polarization, the ion displacement polarization and the inherent dipole moment orientation polarization, and ε∞ only includes the electron displacement polarization. Therefore, the value of ε∞ is smaller than ε0. The [Bi2I9]3− dimer packing density of CBI(100) was more close than that of CBI(001), therefore the number of electrons, ions and inherent dipole moments in the unit volume are larger. Thus, the values of ε0 and ε∞ of CBI(100) are larger than those of CBI(001), which is in complete agreement with our fitting results. Anna et al. obtained high-frequency dielectric tensors of Cs3Bi2I9 according to the DFT computational study,2 and the anisotropic results were in agreement with our work. Moreover, the damping constants of the phonon vibration for the CBI(001) and CBI(100) directions are almost the same, which also corresponds to the trend observed for the extinction coefficients which almost coincide. Based on these results, one can conclude that the dielectric properties of Cs3Bi2I9 could be fitted fairly by the Lorentz model. This is an important reference for the development of dielectric properties of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystal. In an ideal case, the calculated position of the phonon modes should match the fitting result. The phonon vibration peak obtained using Lorentz model fitting should match the calculated phonon absorption peak of 0.89 THz. However, in contrast to the DFPT calculations, the THz-TDS measurements were performed at room temperature, at which there is a thermal extension of the bond length, which results in a red shift of the ΓO phonon frequency.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that the 0D layered perovskite-like Cs3Bi2I9 bulk crystal possesses a transmission ability in the THz region. The complex refractive index and complex dielectric constant were estimated using the THz-TDS thanks to the transmission in the range of 0.2–0.9 THz. The THz transmittance ability was explained through the calculated IR absorption spectrum using DFT. The refractive index of CBI(100) is as high as 3.2–3.7 in 0.2–0.9 THz, while that of CBI(001) is only 2.8–3.2 in the same region. The real dielectric parts of CBI(100) and CBI(001) are 10.0–16.0 and 8.0–11.0, respectively. Moreover, the Lorentz model was employed to extract the dielectric constant of Cs3Bi2I9. The static dielectric constant and the high dielectric constant of the Cs3Bi2I9 crystal were also obtained. The differences in the dielectric parameters are related to the packing density of the [Bi2I9]3− dimers, resulting in anisotropies of the electric dipole moments. The results will provide a novel analytical pattern for the dielectric properties of other layer structure perovskites.
