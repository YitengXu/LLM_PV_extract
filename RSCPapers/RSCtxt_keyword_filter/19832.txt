    , Accepted 10th July 2022First published on 12th July 2022AbstractQuasi-2D cesium lead halide perovskites exhibit better stability than 3D CsPbI3 due to the steric hindrance, decreased surface energy, and improved hydrophobicity brought by long-chain organic spacers, such as phenylethylammonium (PEA) cations. However, crystal-orientation-induced poor charge transport and phase impurities greatly limit their performance. Here, we report effective approaches to tuning the crystal orientation of quasi-2D crystalline films in inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites. By reducing the N,N-dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide ratio and introducing MACl in the precursor solutions, we are able to achieve vertically-aligned PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 perovskite films with enhanced film coverage, decreased trap density, and improved phase purity. The optimized solar cell devices show over 70% improvement in photocurrent which results in a 30% enhancement in efficiency. The unencapsulated cesium-based 2D device preserved 70% of its initial efficiency after being exposed to humid air for 30 days.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as the most promising materials for light harvesting owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties including high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and suitable band gaps.1–3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% to 25.7%,4,5 comparable to the conventional silicon cells. The long-term stability of devices remains a challenge for commercialization.6–9 Reducing the dimensionality of perovskites is considered to be an effective way to improve stability.10–13 Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites formed by inserting organic spacers A, such as butylammonium (BA), phenylethylammonium (PEA), etc., in between lead halide octahedra have shown great stability against moisture and oxygen due to the hydrophobicity and steric hindrance from the spacers.14 At present, research studies on 2D perovskite solar cells mainly focus on 2D methylammonium (MA)-based perovskites.15–18 However, the existence of organic compositions like MA and formamidinium (FA) makes devices unable to withstand long-term thermal stress. As an alternative, inorganic cation cesium (Cs+) is proposed to substitute organic cations (MA+ and FA+), forming inorganic perovskites, which is promising to solve the intrinsic thermal instability problem.19 However, cesium-based inorganic perovskites, especially cesium lead tri-iodide, suffer from phase instability.20 One approach to stabilizing the phase would be reducing the dimensionality. Ruddlesden–Popper quasi-2D A2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites have been proved to enhance the phase stability due to the reduced surface energy.20
Due to the quantum size effect, the bandgap of a quasi-2D perovskite becomes wider with a decrease in the n-value (the number of lead-iodine octahedral layers stacked continuously), and the pure 2D perovskite PEA2PbI4 (n = 1) has a wide bandgap of 2.28 eV,21 which is too wide for a light absorber. Multiple perovskite phases with various n-values are observed to coexist in the quasi-2D perovskite films, which may lead to charge accumulation and recombination.22 In addition, in quasi-2D perovskites, carriers can transport in-plane efficiently, while the out-of-plane transport is hindered by the long-chain organic spacers.14 Therefore, the key to constructing promising quasi-2D perovskite solar cells is to prepare perovskite films with vertical crystal orientation and optimized n-value phase distribution via controlling the crystallization kinetics.
Quasi-2D BA2CsPb2I7 (n = 2) perovskites with a device PCE of 4.84% developed by Liao et al. showed excellent moisture stability much better than that of a 3D CsPbI3 perovskite.23 Li et al. first introduced PEA as an organic spacer into CsPbI3 perovskite films and the prepared devices of quasi-2D Cs0.9PEA0.1PbI3 exhibited a PCE of 5.8%.24 Wang et al. introduced PEAI to prepare PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 with different n values, and perovskite solar cells with n = 2 and n = 4 achieved PCEs of 2.05% and 4.53%, respectively.21 Li et al. controlled the crystallization process of perovskites by incorporating the precursor additive N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone iodide, and the solar cells of PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 4) exhibited an improved PCE of 9.22% due to the better film morphology and phase-orientation.25 Controlling the crystallization process has been verified to be an effective way of preparing well-performed quasi-2D A2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 solar cells; however, research studies about regulating the orientation and phase compositions of quasi-2D A2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 are still limited.
In this work, the crystallization process of PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 4) perovskite films was regulated carefully under the synergistic effect of solvent engineering and the methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive. When reducing the ratio of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and DMSO, the perovskite films showed better film coverage and fewer n = 1 impurity phases. Moreover, the addition of MACl further improved the phase purity and the crystallization of the vertically aligned perovskite in PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 films. As a result, the PCE of the best device was improved by approximately 30%. The quasi-2D perovskite films showed excellent environmental stability in contrast to the unmodified films. The optimized device preserved 70% of its original PCE after being exposed to ambient air with a relative humidity of 10–20% for 30 days.
Experiments
Materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates (FTO, 15 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Yingkou Youxuan Trade Co., Ltd. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), chlorobenzene (CB), CsI, and PbI2 were supplied by Alfa-Aesar. Nickel(II) acetylacetonate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 2-propanol (IPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [6,6]-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. Hydrochloric acid (36–38%) and ethanol were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. 2-Phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.
Device fabrication
The devices with the structure of glass/FTO/NiO/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were constructed on conductive FTO substrates that were cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and IPA successively. Before use, the substrates were pretreated with O2 plasma for 10 minutes. First, 0.1 M nickel(II) acetylacetonate ethanol solution with the addition of 10 μL HCl (38 wt%) stirred overnight was spin-coated on the FTO glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then maintained at 400 °C for 40 min to prepare a NiO layer as the hole transport layer (HTL). The molar ratio of PEAI, CsI, and PbI2 was fixed at 0.45:0.675:0.9 according to the formula of PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 (n = 4) in mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO with different volume ratios (DMF/DMSO = 4:1, 7:3, 1:1, 3:7, and DMSO only). The perovskite films were prepared via a hot-casting method in which the precursor solutions were spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 20 s on hot substrates pre-heated at 100 °C and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. For 3D CsPbI3 films, CsI, PbI2, and DMAI were mixed with a molar ratio of 0.6:0.6:0.6 in DMF, and CsPbI3 films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealing at 210 °C for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the solution prepared by dissolving 18 mg PCBM in 1 mL CB was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s on the perovskite layer pre-heated at 100 °C. Finally, 80 nm Ag was thermally evaporated on the top of the device as the electrode.
Characterization
The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images showing the morphologies of the samples were recorded with a scanning electron microscope (Merlin, Zeiss, Germany). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were characterized using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films were acquired using a spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). The steady-state PL spectra were collected by illuminating the samples with a monochromatic xenon lamp source (λexc = 405 nm). The TRPL spectra were obtained by exciting the samples with a pulsed laser beam (405 nm, 10 MHz, pulse duration of <100 ps) in a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) mode. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were measured by using a solar simulator (Oriel, USA, calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell) with a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, USA) under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2), and the device active area was 0.06 cm2. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured by using a QEX10 solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurements, USA).
Results and discussion
Quasi-2D Ruddlesden–Popper PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 perovskite films with solvents of 5 different DMF/DMSO volume ratios (DMF:DMSO = 4:1, 7:3, 1:1, 3:7, and DMSO only) and MACl as the additive were prepared, and Fig. 1 presents the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of these perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1, when DMF/DMSO = 4:1 or 7:3, there were many pinholes observed in the perovskite films, and as the proportion of DMSO increased, a higher coverage was observed. In DMF/DMSO mixed solvents, more DMSO would retard the crystallization process due to its higher boiling point and stronger coordination strength with lead halide forming DMSO–PbI2 complexes.26 With increasing DMSO content, the crystallization rate slowed down (see Fig. S1 and Video S1, ESI,† for DMSO only and Video S2, ESI,† for DMF/DMSO at 4:1), and the films attained better coverage. High coverage will make the perovskite films more stable since it blocks the rapid entry of moisture into the interior of the films.25 However, the film thickness was reduced significantly when the DMF/DMSO ratio decreased to 3:7 or in the case of DMSO only. This tendency could originate from the extremely slow rate of transforming from precursor solutions to solid films which may lead to much precursor solution being sacrificed and then result in thinner films. When DMF/DMSO = 1:1, the perovskite films showed a minimized density of pinholes and suitable thickness. Note that we also observe a reduced density of pinholes in the perovskite films without MACl (see Fig. S2, ESI†). However, many cracks were simultaneously observed in the films prepared without MACl, and there were many horizontally-oriented perovskites in the film according to the cross-sectional SEM image. In addition, the perovskite film with MACl was thicker than the perovskite film without MACl (see Table S1, ESI†).

The XRD patterns of perovskite films with MACl prepared with different solvents are displayed in Fig. 2(a). All XRD patterns show two main diffraction peaks at approximately 14.3° and 28.9°, corresponding to (111) and (202) reflections, respectively. As the proportion of DMSO increased, the intensity of these two main peaks increased first and then decreased. The variation of the XRD peak intensity can be either due to changes in film thickness or crystallinity. When the DMF/DMSO ratio was reduced from 4:1 to 1:1, we do not observe a noticeable increase in film thickness; on the contrary, the film thickness decreased slightly (see Table S1, ESI†). In conjunction with the narrower full width at half-maximum (FWHM) (see Table S2, ESI†), a higher DMSO content is thought to improve the crystallinity of the perovskite films. When the ratio was further reduced, the main peak intensity decreased which could be ascribed to the thinner perovskite films. The average crystal sizes were calculated by using the Scherrer equation with a FWHM of the (202) diffraction peak.27 When the DMF/DMSO ratio was reduced, the average crystal sizes increased first and then decreased. The crystal of the quasi-2D perovskite film with DMF:DMSO = 1:1 is the largest (see Table S2, ESI†).

The UV-vis absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 2(b). The absorption peaks near 510 nm, 556 nm, 608 nm, and 698 nm are features of n = 1, 2, 3, and nearly 3D (n → ∞) perovskite phases, respectively. This suggests that the perovskite films prepared with different solvent ratios consisted of multiple phases which has been frequently observed in quasi-2D perovskite systems.28–30

Fig. 2(c) presents the steady-state PL spectra obtained by illuminating the perovskite films from the front side (the perovskite film side), and the steady-state PL spectra detected by exciting the perovskite films from the back side (the glass side) are shown in Fig. 2(d). In all samples, the peak which is related to the large n-value (n → ∞) phase with high intensity was observed when excited from the front side, and low n-value peaks were detected when illuminated from the back side. This indicates that low n-value perovskites distributed at the bottom of the perovskite films and large n-value perovskites mainly distributed at the top region of the perovskite films. Different from three-dimensional perovskites, the crystallization process of quasi-2D perovskite films is affected by both the rate of transformation from precursors to solid films and the diffusion rate of organic spacers.31 Since the crystallization starts at the gas–liquid interface, large n-value perovskites would preferentially form at the surface of the film and the remaining organic spacers promote the formation of low n-value phases at the bottom of the films.29,31,32 When the DMF/DMSO ratio was varied from 4:1 to 7:3, the PL intensity increased, which is consistent with the increased crystallization and decreased morphological defects. In contrast to the low DMSO contents, the perovskite films with a DMF/DMSO ratio of 1:1 show fewer n = 1 phases. With further increasing DMSO proportion, more n = 2, 3 phases appeared and the peak which is related to the large n-value phase blue-shifted. This may be attributed to the variation of the crystallization rate controlled by solvent engineering. We speculate that when the DMF proportion was too high, large n-value phases formed quickly and the large ammonium cations were expelled downward, leading to an uneven stoichiometric distribution with high n values at the top and low n values at the bottom.
As the DMSO proportion further increased, the crystallization at the gas–liquid interface could be slowed down, and the organic spacers would have higher chances to diffuse to the solid–liquid interface, which results in fewer n = 1 phases and lower n-values of large n-value perovskites (n → ∞). Since the energy band of n = 1 phases with a broad bandgap (2.3–2.4 eV) does not match with those of ETLs and HTLs which hinders the charge transport, n = 1 phases are not expected in the well-performing solar cells.33 In this sense, we would expect the perovskites prepared with DMF/DMSO ratios of 1:1 and 3:7 and DMSO only to show better photovoltaic performance in solar cell devices.
For photovoltaic devices, the trap states and charge transport dynamics are also important. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were performed to investigate the variation of trap density and carrier mobility with different solvent ratios. For electron-only measurements, the structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite(PVSK)/PCBM/Ag was adopted, and for hole-only measurements, the device structure was FTO/NiO/perovskite(PVSK)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The electron-only SCLC curves with different solvent ratios are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the hole-only SCLC curves are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The SCLC curves consist of three regions with different slope values (k), including the ohmic region (k = 1), the trap-filled limit (TFL) region (k > 3), and the trap free child's region (k = 2). The trap densities were calculated using the formula Nt = (2εrε0VTFL)/qL2, where Nt represents the trap state density, ε0, εr, q, and L are the vacuum permittivity, relative dielectric constant, elementary charge, and film thickness, respectively, and VTFL is the voltage value of the intersection of the ohmic region and the TFL region.25 The electron and hole mobilities were calculated using Mott–Gurney's law with the formula JD = 9εrε0μVb2/8L3, where JD, μ, and Vb represent the dark current density, the carrier mobility, and the applied voltage, respectively.34,35 The calculated trap densities and carrier mobilities of the perovskite films with different solvent ratios are shown in Fig. 2(e and f), respectively. The trap density decreased and both the electron mobility and hole mobility increased when the DMF/DMSO ratio decreased from 4:1 to 1:1. The decreased trap density and improved charge transport ability are beneficial for achieving high photovoltaic performance, and we suppose that these variations benefited from the improved crystallization and optimized phase purity as shown in the steady-state PL spectra in Fig. 2(c and d). However, when the proportion of DMSO further increased, the trap density increased and the carrier mobilities decreased. We expect that the abundant grain boundaries caused by smaller crystal sizes (see Table S2, ESI†) caused a higher trap density and offset the benefits brought by the optimized phase purity, which then leads to a weaker charge transport ability.
Planar inverted solar cells were fabricated with the structure of glass/FTO/NiO/PVSK/PCBM/Ag in order to explore the photovoltaic performance. The distributions of the photovoltaic parameters of the devices with MACl and different DMF/DMSO ratios are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of various devices are shown in Fig. 3, and the photovoltaic parameters of the best devices are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). Benefiting from the increased crystallization, optimized phase purity, decreased trap density and improved carrier mobility, the device with a DMF/DMSO ratio of 1:1 showed the best photovoltaic performance. The best device displayed a short current density (JSC) of 12.31 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.18 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.43%, and the improved JSC and VOC result in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.21%. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, although fewer n = 1 phases were obtained, the device prepared with DMSO only shows a significantly decreased PCE mainly due to the decreased JSC which may be a result of the insufficient light absorption with a decreased perovskite film thickness and a higher trap density.

To explore the effect of MACl, we have performed XRD measurements on perovskite films with and without MACl, as shown in Fig. 4(a). In addition to the main diffraction peaks at approximately 14.3° and 28.9° (corresponding to the (111) and (202) planes of the quasi-2D perovskites, respectively), the diffraction peak with a low diffraction angle (near 5.4°) corresponds to the (020) crystal orientation of the perovskite with low-n values.21,36 As shown in Fig. 4(a), the intensity of the (020) diffraction peak is significantly reduced for the perovskite film with MACl compared with the perovskite film without MACl, and the FWHM of (111) and (202) peaks decreased, indicating better crystallization (see Table S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, according to the Scherrer equation, the crystal size of the perovskite film with MACl becomes larger (see Table S4, ESI†), which can result in fewer grain boundaries and thus a decreased trap density. Since the (020) planes are parallel to the 2D perovskite layer and the (202) planes are perpendicular to the 2D perovskite layer,27 the peak intensity ratio I(202)/I(020) increased from 1.70 to 61.65, suggesting that the addition of MACl promoted the crystallization of the vertically-aligned 2D perovskite films.
 Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns, (b) UV-vis spectra, and (c) steady-state PL spectra obtained by exciting the samples from the front side (filled circle) and the back side (empty circle) and (d) time-resolved PL spectra of perovskite films with and without MACl. 
The UV-vis and steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films with and without MACl are shown in Fig. 4(b and c), respectively. Compared with the perovskite films without MACl, fewer n = 1 perovskites and more n = 2 perovskites appeared in the perovskite films with MACl. Furthermore, the large-n value perovskite related absorption peak and PL peak red-shifted. These reveal that MACl as an additive could promote the formation of quasi-2D perovskites with n = 2 and acquire high-n value perovskites with larger n-values, which is consistent with the results of quasi-2D MA-based perovskite films.27
Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy was performed to investigate the charge combination and defect density in the perovskite films prepared on glass substrates with and without MACl. The TRPL curves shown in Fig. 4(d) were fitted by a bi-exponential decay function I(t) = A1exp(−t1/τ1) + A1exp(−t2/τ2) + B, where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes for fast and slow recombination, respectively.37 The average decay lifetimes were obtained using a function of τavg = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2) and the fitting results are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). As shown in Table S5 (ESI†), the average lifetimes of the perovskite films on glass substrates with and without MACl are 1206.38 ns and 381.89 ns, respectively. The longer PL lifetime of the perovskite film with MACl suggests reduced non-radiative recombination and a lower trap density.38
The SCLC measurements were conducted to explore the effects of the additive MACl on the trap states and carrier dynamics of quasi-2D perovskite films. The carrier mobilities and trap densities of devices with and without MACl were also calculated based on the VTFL and Mott–Gurney's law with the SCLC curves in Fig. 5(a and b). As shown in Fig. 5(c and d), devices with MACl show a decreased trap density, consistent with the TRPL results, and the devices with MACl possess improved electron mobility and hole mobility which are supposed to be attributed to the improved crystallization, phase purity, and more vertical perovskite orientation.

Planar inverted solar cells were fabricated with the structure of glass/FTO/NiO/PVSK/PCBM/Ag as shown in the cross-sectional SEM image of the device in Fig. 6(a). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) distribution of devices without and with MACl of different molar concentrations (0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.15 M) is presented in Fig. 6(b). The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of various devices are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Devices with 0.1 M MACl exhibited the highest PCE. Compared with the control device, the PCE of the MACl-modified device shows a 30% increase in PCE from 7.57% to 9.84% (see Table S6, ESI†). The enhanced PCE is mainly attributed to the short current density JSC increasing from 9.1 mA cm−2 to 12.97 mA cm−2, which can originate from the reduction of n = 1 phases with a broad energy bandgap and more vertical perovskite orientation that promotes the charge transport. Fig. 6(c) shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra collected from 300 nm to 800 nm of the perovskite films without and with MACl, and the integrated current density values are 9.04 mA cm−2 and 12.19 mA cm−2, respectively. We observe two dips in the IPCE spectra which are related to the n = 1 and n = 2 perovskites according to their energy bandgaps. The IPCE spectrum of the MACl-modified device shows less loss at around 520 nm and slightly improved efficiency near 560 nm in contrast to the control device, indicating fewer n = 1 phases and more n = 2 phases. This is in good agreement with the observations in the UV-vis spectra and PL spectra. The existence of these two dips in the IPCE spectra suggests that quasi-2D perovskites with low n-values including n = 1 and n = 2 could affect the charge transport and collection which lead to low current densities in perovskite solar cells. The J–V curves measured under forward scan and reverse scan are presented in Fig. 6(d). It can be seen that the hysteresis within the perovskite films was obviously reduced with the help of MACl. This may be assigned to the reduction of n = 1 phases in the perovskite films which alleviated the charge accumulation and recombination near the hole transport layer.

To examine the phase stability of the prepared quasi-2D PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 perovskite films with MACl, the XRD patterns of a three-dimensional (3D) CsPbI3 film and quasi-2D perovskite films without and with MACl subjected to 50% relative humidity for 0 minutes, 30 minutes and 120 minutes are collected in Fig. 7(a–c), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the yellow phase with a diffraction peak near 9.9° had already occurred in the 3D CsPbI3 film after 30 minutes, and the black phase featured diffraction peaks which decreased as a PbI2 featured peak near 13° appeared, suggesting the decomposition of perovskite films. After 120 minutes of aging, the CsPbI3 film became yellow and semi-transparent, and the yellow phase XRD peak significantly increased, indicating that the perovskite had almost transformed to the yellow phase. As shown in Fig. 7(b and c), the XRD patterns of quasi-2D PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 perovskite films without and with MACl remained unchanged after 30 minutes, and the black phase peaks decreased slightly after 120 minutes. The prepared quasi-2D perovskite films with and without MACl both showed better phase stability under a humid environment than the 3D CsPbI3 film. As shown in Fig. 7(e–g), the XRD patterns of various perovskite films exposed to approximately 25% relative humidity for 23 days were obtained to test the long-term phase stability. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the CsPbI3 film had already transformed to the yellow phase after 23 days similarly to the CsPbI3 film subjected to 50% relative humidity for 120 minutes. In Fig. 7(e), a weak yellow-phase diffraction peak near 9.9° occurred in the XRD pattern of the quasi-2D perovskite film without MACl, and the quasi-2D perovskite film with MACl still maintained the initial state. These indicate that the quasi-2D perovskite film with MACl possessed the best long-term stability because of its vertical alignment and fewer low-n value impurity phases. In order to test the thermal stability, the XRD patterns of the perovskite films heated at 80 °C for 48 hours were measured as shown in Fig. 7(g–i). After heating, the CsPbI3 film transformed to the yellow phase in part, and a phase transition occurred in the quasi-2D perovskite film without MACl, while the XRD pattern of the perovskite film with MACl was nearly unchanged. Since perovskites with different n-values will rearrange when the film is heated,39 we speculate that a large amount of horizontally oriented n = 1 perovskites in the perovskite film without MACl could lead to structural instability during the rearrangement process and then lead to thermal instability. According to the results of stability measurements, the quasi-2D perovskite with MACl showed excellent phase stability and thermal stability. The quasi-2D PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 solar cells with MACl are also more stable than the solar cells without MACl. The encapsulated quasi-2D solar cell maintained 70% of its initial PCE when stored in air for 30 days under 10–20% relative humidity, while the PCE of the solar cell without MACl decreased below 70% of its initial PCE after only 14 days of storage in the same environment, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).

Conclusions
In summary, vertically-aligned quasi-2D PEA2Cs3Pb4I13 perovskite films with optimized n-value compositions were realized by carefully tuning the content of DMSO and incorporating MACl as an additive. Spectroscopic studies reveal that DMSO and MACl improve the crystallization of the perovskite films, resulting in higher film coverage, vertically aligned crystal orientation, higher phase purity, decreased defect density and better stability. In addition, we find that MACl is capable of maintaining a suitable film thickness even at an elevated proportion of DMSO, which is necessary to achieve a decent photocurrent. The best device achieved an improvement of approximately 70% in JSC which leads to a 30% increase in the final device efficiency when using DMSO and MACl. The optimized devices retained 70% of their original PCE after being exposed to an ambient environment with 10–20% relative humidity for 30 days.
