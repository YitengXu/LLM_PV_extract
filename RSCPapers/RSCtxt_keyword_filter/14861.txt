    , Accepted 20th January 2017First published on 6th February 2017AbstractA homologous set of dyes that differ only in the donor fragments, namely phenothiazine (PTZ) and triarylamine (TPA) units, were evaluated in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The novel PTZ-based dye differs from the TPA-based dye in that it contains a sulfur bridge that planarizes two aromatic rings and enables higher dye loading and higher stability in the oxidized form. These positive features notwithstanding, the superior absorptivity of devices sensitized by TPA-based dyes resulted in significantly higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than those sensitized by PTZ-based dyes.
There are four key classes of light harvesting materials that have proven to be effective in dye-sensitized solar cells1,2 (DSSCs): quantum dots,3–5 ruthenium complexes,1,6–10 porphyrins,11–15 and metal-free “donor–π-bridge–acceptor” (D–π–A) molecules.16–22 An appealing aspect of the latter class of dyes is the potential to circumvent the need for rare or toxic metals. However, state-of-the-art organic dyes currently produce power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that are often below 10%, with few exceptions,23,24 and thus further advances are needed.2
The triphenylamine (TPA) motif is one of the most extensively studied donor units in D–π–A dyes owing to its broad spectral absorption and electrochemical stability in the oxidized form.25–33 Indeed, organic dyes bearing the TPA unit produce some of the highest PCEs of organic chromophores reported to date in DSSCs.16 Phenothiazine (PTZ) is structurally analogous to the TPA unit, with the exception of a sulfur bridge that links two phenyl rings. This bridge serves to increase the planarity of the two aromatic rings and therefore imparts a starkly different electronic structure relative to the TPA unit.34 One key outcome of planarizing the aromatic rings is a higher redox stability in the oxidized form due to delocalization of π-electrons,35 a feature that has been used effectively to avoid over-charging in lithium-ion batteries.36
Given the long-standing interest of our program in developing robust dyestuffs,8,37–40 we set out to better understand the underlying chemistry of dyes containing the PTZ units by contrasting it with the more established TPA unit. We compare herein the performance of the novel dye (E)-2-cyano-3-(5-(4-(3,7-dimethoxy-10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)acrylic acid (PTZ) with the structurally related compound (E)-3-(5-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid41 (TPA) in DSSCs (Fig. 1). There are literature precedents for dyes bearing the PTZ unit in DSSCs,42–44 and these studies have shown that linking the π-bridge to the para-carbon of the PTZ unit increases dye aggregation and undesirable charge recombination relative to dyes where the π-bridge is linked to the PTZ through the nitrogen atom (Scheme S1, ESI†).45,46 We therefore confined this study to the analysis of PTZ through the nitrogen atom. The π-bridge was selected on the basis that thiophene is widely used in organic dyes and has been shown to broaden the absorption envelope of chromophores.17,47,48 The structure–property analysis detailed herein shows that the sulfur tether of PTZ leads to higher stability in the oxidized form, which is proven through direct comparisons of PTZ and TPA both in solution (electrochemically) and immobilized on TiO2 (spectroelectrochemically). PTZ exhibits much higher dye-loading relative to TPA, but these features do not compensate for the blue-shifted absorption of PTZ that precludes the generation of meaningful photocurrents.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the TPA and PTZ dyes investigated here. 
The novel dye PTZ was synthesized in accordance with related procedures (Fig. S1, ESI†).47,49,50 The PTZ unit, P1, was accessed through an Ullmann condensation of two primary amines prior to the addition of the sulfur-bridge to form P2. A brominated phenyl ring was added to P2 to yield the tertiary amine P3 by an Ullmann condensation catalyzed by copper powder. A palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling was used to isolate P4 prior to addition of the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group by a Knoevenagel condensation to yield the PTZ dye. The TPA dye was synthesized using previously reported literature procedures.41 The intermediate products and final dyes were structurally characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, as well as high-resolution mass spectrometry (see the ESI†).
Density functional theory (DFT) was used to compare the geometries and electronic structures of PTZ and TPA. This analysis confirmed that the sulfur bridge of PTZ holds the phenothiazine donor unit perpendicular to the π-bridge, thereby disrupting the conjugation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) on the donor unit and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) that is localized to the cyanoacrylic acid. The coplanarity of the π-bridge with the pinwheel orientation of the TPA groups for TPA yields a HOMO delocalized over the donor, acceptor and bridge portions of the molecule (Fig. 2a). These differences in orbital overlap help explain the much higher extinction coefficients recorded for TPA (ε = 2.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1) relative to PTZ (ε = 1.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1) recorded in solution UV-visible absorption experiments (Fig. 2b and Table 1). The restricted geometry of PTZ also leads to a forbidden HOMO → LUMO transition that is expected at 760 nm but is not experimentally observed. The lowest energy band, with a maximum at 411 nm, for PTZ instead corresponds to a higher energy HOMO−3 → LUMO transition (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Cyclic voltammograms recorded for each dye in MeCN solution revealed that the dye+/dye redox potentials are at +0.78 and +0.97 V vs. NHE for PTZ and TPA, respectively (Fig. 3a and Table 1). The reduction potential for PTZ is positively shifted due to the electron-rich sulfur tether increasing the planarity and conjugation throughout the PTZ unit, thereby stabilizing the oxidized form of the dye. The E1/2 value for PTZ is near the threshold for regeneration by iodide (the redox potential for the I2˙−/I− couple is +0.8 V vs. NHE8,51) which can potentially stunt dye regeneration (vide infra), but efficient dyes with similar potentials are known.52

(b) Temporal change in UV-vis absorption at 748 and 625 nm for the one-electron oxidized forms of TPA and PTZ, respectively, immobilized on TiO2. The dyes were each oxidized by applying a bias E1/2 +100 mV for 1 min in 0.1 mM n-NBu4PF6 in MeCN. The first data points (i.e., t = 0 s) correspond to the data recorded after the applied bias was removed. Dashed lines indicate t1/2. 
The stabilities of both dyes in the oxidized form were analyzed by spectroelectrochemical techniques. The working electrode (i.e., TPA or PTZ adsorbed to TiO2) was held at a potential +100 mV greater than the sensitizer redox potential for 1 min, a time period that yielded long-wavelength absorption maxima corresponding to the dye cation (TPA+ or PTZ+). The decay of the absorption band intensity as a function of time was measured following the removal of the applied bias (Fig. 3b). The PTZ+ persisted the longest in the oxidized form with a half-life (t1/2) of 10 min, while the t1/2 for TPA+ was merely 3.5 min. These results supported our hypothesis that PTZ+ would exhibit greater oxidative stability.
The dye loadings for each of the dyes were determined by desorption of the respective sensitized TiO2 substrates in basic media and subsequent spectrophotometric quantification. The PTZ dye exhibited approximately twice the dye loading coverage than TPA (Table S1, ESI†). This stark difference is attributed to the smaller molecular volume occupied by the tethered donor unit on PTZ. Higher dye loading for PTZ relative to TPA was also observed when co-adsorbed with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) coabsorbent, and thus we conclude that higher concentrations of PTZ on TiO2 are not merely due to dye aggregation.
The two dyes were evaluated in the DSSC with an iodine-based electrolyte system and platinized counter electrode (Table 2). The current–voltage profiles and the corresponding metrics are provided in Fig. 4. The short-circuit current density (Jsc, 13.3 mA cm−2) measured for TPA was significantly higher than that measured for PTZ (8.2 mA cm−2) with CDCA. This stark difference can be rationalized by the much broader absorption envelope for TPA relative to PTZ, but we cannot rule out that the HOMO of the PTZ dye as too high in energy to be regenerated by I−.2,8,39,53 The open-circuit potential, Voc, is also higher for TPA, presumably because of the higher concentration of minority carriers in TiO2 in the case of the TPA dye. The lower energy of the TPA HOMO level is also expected to facilitate faster regeneration of the oxidized dye, which can also improve the measured photovoltages.18,54–56 A difference in recombination with the oxidized electrolyte species (I3−) does not appear to be responsible for the differences in voltages because the more highly loaded PTZ molecules on the TiO2 surface would be expected to increase the photovoltage, which is not observed here. Preliminary stability studies were carried out by subjecting cells containing TPA and PTZ to constant illumination at AM 1.5 (1 Sun) and 45 °C for 150 h in a light-soaking chamber and periodically collecting Voc measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†). TPA shows a slightly faster rate of performance decline with 87% of initial Voc after 150 h of light-soaking. PTZ maintained 91% of the open-circuit potential over the same period. Now that PTZ has been identified as a redox stable organic dye, further studies on how this stability translates into cell stability under illumination and high temperatures will be carried out.57

We investigated the PTZ donor unit in a DSSC and benchmarked it against the more widely used TPA donor unit using a novel PTZ dye molecule. The planar PTZ geometry enables higher dye coverage and higher stability in the oxidized form relative to TPA. The stabilities of the two analogous N-linked dyes were compared for the first time, herein, using spectroelectrochemistry. However, the N-linked PTZ dyes are not ideal sensitizers because the TPA unit has a higher optical cross section and absorbs light at longer wavelengths. The nominal thermodynamic driving force for dye regeneration by I− also needs to be considered when evaluating dyes with this PTZ unit.

The dyes were each oxidized by applying a bias E1/2 +100 mV for 1 min in 0.1 mM n-NBu4PF6 in MeCN. The first data points (i.e., t = 0 s) correspond to the data recorded after the applied bias was removed. Dashed lines indicate t1/2.
