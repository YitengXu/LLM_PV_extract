    , Accepted 11th April 2012First published on 13th April 2012AbstractNovel organic sensitizers containing a thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) moiety with triphenylamine or julolidine as the electron donor have been designed and synthesized for quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For comparison, two organic dyes based on a terthiophene spacer have also been synthesized. The absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of all sensitizers have been systematically investigated. We found that the incorporation of TPD is highly beneficial to broaden the absorption spectra of the organic sensitizers and prevent the intermolecular interaction. Therefore, the charge recombination possibility is reduced, which is revealed by the controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. A quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE38 with TPD and triphenylamine moieties demonstrates a solar energy conversion efficiency of 4.71% under standard AM 1.5G sunlight without the use of coadsorbant agents.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are receiving an ever-increasing amount of attention as potential low cost alternatives to silicon-based photovoltaic devices.1 Undoubtedly, for achieving high photon-to-current conversion efficiency, one of the key components used in these cells is the sensitizer, which absorbs sunlight, thereby injecting electrons into the conduction band of nanostructured/porous titania, and then is regenerated by the electrolyte.2 During the early years of DSSCs, most of the research studies have focused on the development of metal complexes as sensitizers. cis-Di(thiocyanato)bis(bipyridyl-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) (N719) is the most representative DSSC sensitizer, with overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of over 11%.3 Recently, the η of a zinc-porphyrin-based DSSC cosensitized with organic dye has reached 12.3%.4
Compared with heavy-metal-based complexes, metal-free organic dyes have gained more and more attention due to their unique advantages, such as high molar-extinction coefficients, easy synthesis and facile structural modification, as well as lesser environmental concerns.2,5 Generally, organic sensitizers used for efficient DSSC devices are composed of three units including a donor and an acceptor connected by a π-conjugation bridge. In the past decade, considerable efforts have been made on the exploration of various π-conjugated blocks in D–π–A dyes. For example, organic dyes based on thiophene derivatives,6 furan,7 selenophene,8 and pyrrole9 have been investigated as sensitizers for DSSCs. And impressive efficiencies in the range of 8–10% have been achieved in liquid electrolyte systems.6h,j,10 To further extend the absorption spectra and tune the energy levels, a few organic sensitizers incorporating electron-withdrawing or electron-deficient groups have been also utilized in DSSCs.11
Recently, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) based conjugated copolymers have been intensively investigated for their applications in polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells.12 There are three merits of choosing TPD as the π-conjugated spacer of organic dyes for DSSCs: firstly, its compact planar structure13could be beneficial to the electron delocalization when incorporated into the π-spacer in the organic chromophores; secondly, its strong electron-withdrawing effect could shift the absorption band of the dyes to the near-infrared regime; thirdly, the simple introduction of alkyl side chains onto the pyrrole ring could not only increase the solubility but also minimize the formation of molecular aggregates of the resulting dyes and suppress the charge recombination.6h,j,k Despite these promising features, to our best knowledge, TPD-containing sensitizers have never been explored for applications in DSSCs.
Herein, we report the first synthesis of two TPD-based organic dyes FNE38 and FNE39 (Fig. 1) containing triphenylamine and julolidine14 moieties as donor groups and their applications in quasi-solid-state DSSCs.15 For comparison, sensitizers FNE31 and FNE37 (Fig. 1) without a pyrrolidinedione moiety have also been synthesized. Their structure–performance relationships were investigated, especially the influence of the TPD unit and the donor moieties on the absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. It is found that the incorporation of the TPD unit into the dye molecules can broaden the absorption spectrum and improve the DSSC performance. However, although the introduction of the julolidine moiety can bathochromically shift the maximum absorption band, the DSSC performance significantly decreased due to the unsuitable HOMO level.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of sensitizers
The synthesis details and the characterization of the sensitizers are described in the ESI.†
2.2 Characterizations
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye solutions and the dye-loaded transparent film were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550PC spectrophotometer. Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, which were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab analyzer using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in anhydrous acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature under nitrogen. Dye-adsorbed TiO2 film on conductive glass was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated with ferrocene, and all potentials mentioned in this work are against the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The electron lifetimes were measured using intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS).16 IMVS analysis was carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany), which includes a green light emitting diode (LED, 532 nm) and the corresponding control system. The intensity-modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 5 to 45 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with a modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity.
2.3 Fabrication of quasi-solid-state DSSCs
Fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (15 Ω sq−1, Nippon Sheet Glass) substrates were cleaned in a detergent solution in an ultrasonic bath, washed with acetone and water, then dried using N2 current. Nanocrystalline TiO2 films, 10 μm, consisting of a transparent layer (∼20 nm nanoparticles) and a scattering layer (∼100 nm particles) of 5 μm thickness, were prepared using a screen printing technique, followed by sintering at 525 °C under an air flow.17 After cooling, the TiO2 films were impregnated in a 0.05 M aqueous TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C and then rinsed with deionized water. The TiCl4-treated TiO2 films were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min and then cooled to 100 °C before being immersed into the dye solution (0.3 mM in chloroform∶ethanol = 7∶3) for 16 h to allow the dye to adsorb onto the TiO2 surface. After the adsorption of the dyes, the electrodes were rinsed with chloroform and acetonitrile. The resulting photoelectrode and Pt-counter electrodes were assembled into a sealed sandwich solar cell with a thermoplastic frame (Surlyn, 30 μm thick). A quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)18 with a redox solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, and 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) under heating at 100 °C until all solids were dissolved. After introducing the hot gel solution into the internal space of the cell from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode, a uniform motionless polymer gel layer was formed between the working and the counter electrodes, and then the holes were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat.
2.4 Photovoltaic measurements
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured by recording J–V curves using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-91193 equipped with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5 filter). The DSSCs were fully covered with a black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 during measurements. The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard solar cell for an amorphous silicon solar cell (Newport 91150). Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained with an Oriel-74125 system (Oriel Instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Oriel-71640).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis details and the characterization of the resulted organic dyes and the corresponding intermediate products are described in the ESI.† As shown in Scheme 1, the straightforward synthesis of the sensitizers began with a dithiophene substituted spacer, i.e., terthiophene19 for FNE31 and FNE37 and 5-hexyl-1,3-di(thiophenyl)thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione13,20 for FNE38 and FNE39, respectively. After refluxing with a Vilsmeier reagent,21 the corresponding monoaldehyde-substituted derivative 2 was produced and then converted to bromide 3 by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Electron donor, triphenylamine or julolidine, was attached via Stille coupling22 and provided precursor 4. In the last step, the obtained precursor was converted to the corresponding sensitizer by Knoevenagel condensation11a,23 with cyanoacetic acid through refluxing chloroform in the presence of piperidine. All the target dye sensitizers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy, and were found to be consistent with the proposed structures.

3.2 UV-vis absorption properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the resulted dyes in THF solutions are depicted in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the dyes exhibit two distinct absorption bands. The absorption band in the high-energy region (380–430 nm) corresponds to the π–π* electron transitions of the conjugated backbone, and the other one in the low-energy region (478–510 nm) can be assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)24 between the electron donating unit and the electron-withdrawing group.6g Such an ICT transition band can be verified by its solvatochromic effect. For example, the ICT band for dye FNE38 is located at 468 nm in toluene, an apolar solvent, while it bathochromically shifts to 485 nm in THF, a polar solvent.

As shown in Fig. 2a, FNE31 displays a maximum absorption wavelength at 478 nm.6g Upon replacing the triphenylamine with a stronger electron donating group, julolidine, in FNE37, a slight bathochromic shift of 6 nm can be observed for the maximum absorption wavelength. While the fusion of an electron withdrawing group, 1-hexylpyrrolidine-2,5-dione, into the thiophene unit in the middle of the spacer of FNE31 produced dye FNE38 and brought a 7 nm bathochromic shift for the absorption maximum. The degree of the bathochromic shift is much smaller than our recently reported pyrazine case where the absorption band shifted to 625 nm by 165 nm.11k This is obviously due to the more weakened electron withdrawing ability of pyrrolidinedione compared with pyrazine. However, when both triphenylamine was replaced by julolidine and pyrrolidinedione was fused into the thiophene unit, FNE39 exhibited a maximum absorption wavelength at 510 nm with a bathochromic shift of 32 nm in comparison to that for FNE31. This suggests that not only strong electron donors but also strong electron acceptors are needed for maximizing the bathochromic shift of the absorption band. It is noted that FNE37 and FNE39 containing a julolidine unit as an electron donor possess a lower molar extinction coefficient than FNE31 and FNE38, respectively, with triphenylamine as an electron donor. This is probably due to the relatively less conjugated system in julolidine than in triphenylamine.
When the dye molecules are attached to nanocrystalline TiO2 films, dyes FNE31, FNE37, FNE38, and FNE39 demonstrate a maximum absorption wavelength at 421, 402, 434, and 425 nm, respectively, with a significant hypsochromic shift of 57, 84, 51, and 85 nm, respectively, in comparison to those in THF solutions. This may be because of the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid, which weakened the ICT interaction and therefore hypsochromically shift the absorption band. Such a hypsochromic shift of the absorption spectra for organic dyes adsorbed onto the TiO2 films has also been observed in other metal-free organic dyes.6g,25 Moreover, FNE38 or FNE39, containing an additional electron acceptor, loaded TiO2 film displays a much broader absorption spectrum than that observed for FNE31 or FNE37, respectively, which is beneficial for the absorption and utilization of sunlight.
3.3 Electrochemical properties
In order to reveal the possibility of the photo-generated electron injection and the sensitizer regeneration, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with a TiO2 film stained with sensitizer as the working electrode. Fig. 3 depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the four dyes and reversible redox curves for all the dyes can be clearly observed. The first half-wave potential corresponding to the HOMO level was determined to be 1.04, 0.65, 1.13 and 0.71 V (vs. NHE, the same below) for sensitizers FNE31, FNE37, FNE38, and FNE39, respectively. Correspondingly, calculated from HOMO levels and the optical band gap derived from the wavelength at 10% maximum absorption intensity for the dye-loaded TiO2 film,2b the LUMO levels for sensitizers FNE31, FNE37, FNE38, and FNE39 are calculated to be −1.16, −1.45, −0.91 and −1.26 V, respectively, indicating enough driving force for electron injection from their excited states for all the sensitizers. It should be noted that the introduction of the julolidine unit lifts up the HOMO levels of dyes FNE37 and FNE39 relative to the triphenylamine based dyes FNE31 and FNE38. This can be attributed to the contribution of the stronger electron-donating group, julolidine, which resulted in a more delocalized HOMO. Moreover, compared with the HOMO levels, the LUMO levels are also lifted up. This is due to the fact that the HOMO partially delocalizes in the acceptor moiety, which therefore weakens the electron-withdrawing property of the acceptor and therefore lifts up the LUMO levels.26 The lift degree of the HOMO levels is higher than that for the LUMO levels. As a result, the band gap of both FNE37 and FEN39 decreased compared with FNE31 and FEN38, respectively. It is interesting to find out that the fusion of an electron acceptor has a similar but inverse effect on the energy levels in comparison with the replacement of a stronger donor. Upon fusing pyrrolidinedione into the thiophene unit, both HOMO and LUMO levels are positively shifted through a contributing inductive effect,26 but the shift degree of HOMO levels is smaller than that for the LUMO levels. Consequently, the band gap of both FNE38 and FEN39 decreased compared with FNE31 and FEN37, respectively. Combining the two effects from julolidine and pyrrolidinedione, it is not difficult to be understood that FNE39 possesses the smallest band gap, which is consistent with the results from UV-vis absorption spectra.

3.4 Theoretical approach
To investigate the geometrical and electronic properties of the resulted dyes, density functional calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 03 program package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (Fig. 4).27 It can be found that for all dyes, the HOMO extensively distributes over the π-system of the donor part and the spacer. The LUMO reflecting the excited state of the dye under light illumination is a π* orbital delocalized across the cyanoacetic unit and the spacer. This distribution of HOMO and LUMO levels suggests the existence of charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor units, allowing significant charge separation within the dye and hence efficient electron injection upon photoexcitation. Furthermore, upon incorporation of the pyrrolidinedione group, a similar coplanarity can be found in the spacer of FNE38 and FNE39 in comparison with FNE31 and FEN37, respectively.13 The dihedral angles between the middle thiophene ring and the neighboring thiophene ring close to the donor unit are calculated to be 10.0° and 7.8° for FNE31 and FNE37, respectively, and 5.5° and 4.6° for FNE38 and FNE39, respectively. This indicates that no obvious steric hindrance exists between the pyrrolidinedione group and the neighboring thiophene unit and the introduction of the pyrrolidinedione group cannot twist the conformation of the conjugated spacer in the sensitizers.

3.5 Solar cell performance

Fig. 5 illustrates the IPCE of the resulted dye based quasi-solid-state DSSCs using 5% PVDF-HFP (w/w), 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2 and 0.6 M DMPImI in MPN as redox electrolyte. It can be found that the FNE31 based DSSC displays a maximum IPCE of over 80% with a platform ranging from 440 to 540 nm. Upon introduction of the TPD group into the dye molecules, although the amount of the dye on the TiO2 surface is reduced (Fig. 2b), sensitizer FNE38 based quasi-solid-state DSSC displays a similar maximum IPCE with a slightly broader platform ranging from 420 to 570 nm, which is due to the bathochromic shift of the maximum absorption band of FNE38 loaded TiO2 films compared with that for FNE31. Taking the reflectance and absorption by the conductive glass into account, the maximum IPCE can be regarded as unity. However, replacing the triphenylamine group with the julolidine group, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on both FNE37 and FNE39 display much lower IPCE values with a maximum below 50%. As IPCE is a product of the electron injection efficiency, light-harvesting efficiency, and charge collection efficiency,28 the relative low IPCE values are probably due to the low electron injection efficiency or charge collection efficiency. As the driving force for the regeneration of the excited FNE37 or FNE39 molecules is insufficient as revealed by the electrochemical study, the electron injection efficiency or the charge collection efficiency is possibly reduced dramatically, which hence lowers the IPCE significantly under similar adsorption conditions. Compared with the IPCE spectrum of FNE37 based quasi-solid-state DSSCs, FNE39 demonstrates a much broader IPCE spectrum obviously due to its bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum.
 Fig. 5  IPCE action spectra for quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE31, FNE37, FNE38, and FNE39. 
The photovoltaic performance of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs was evaluated under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G solar light and the J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 6. The quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE31, FNE37, FNE38, and FNE39 produced a Jsc of 13.16, 7.55, 13.18, and 8.90 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with the trend of the photo-generated current integrated from the IPCE spectra. While the four quasi-solid-state DSSCs offered a Voc of 0.47, 0.39, 0.55, and 0.43 V, respectively, and an FF of 0.60, 0.61, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively, corresponding to an η of 3.71%, 1.80%, 4.71%, and 2.49%, respectively. As the Jsc for FNE31 and FNE38 based quasi-solid-state DSSCs are almost the same, it can be found that the improved efficiency of the FNE38 based quasi-solid-state DSSC is caused by the distinctly increased Voc value which is related to the charge recombination degree in the DSSC.
 Fig. 6  
J–V curves for quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE31, FNE37, FNE38, and FNE39. 
To investigate the charge recombination in the quasi-solid-state DSSCs, electron lifetime (τ) is evaluated since it is a judgment for the charge recombination of injected electrons with I3− in the electrolyte at open-circuit.29Fig. 7 shows the τ of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on different dyes as a function of Voc. The τ values were obtained from the frequency at the top of the semicircle (fmin) in the IMVS spectra by the relation τ = (2πfmin)−1. As illustrated in Fig. 7, for all cases, electron lifetime decreased with increasing Voc. At a fixed Voc, the electron lifetime increases in the order of FNE37 < FNE39 < FNE31 < FNE38, which is consistent with the Voc trend shown in Fig. 6. Since a retarded charge recombination rate constant can reduce electron loss at an open circuit, more charge is accumulated in TiO2. As a result, the Fermi level moves upward and the Voc value gets larger. Compared with FNE31, FNE38 shows a much longer electron lifetime by ∼5-fold at 0.35 V of Voc. In a similar way, FNE39 shows a much longer electron lifetime than FNE37 by ∼5-fold. This indicates that replacement of the thiophene unit by the 5-hexyl-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione group can retard charge recombination significantly when the donor and acceptor parts are remained. For the dyes with the same bridge but different donors, the julolidine-containing dyes show a lower electron lifetime than the triphenylamine-containing dyes by ∼25-fold. This is probably due to the high HOMO energy levels, which results in an insufficient regeneration of the excited dyes and enhances the possibility of charge recombination.

4. Conclusions
In summary, novel TPD-containing sensitizers with triphenylamine or julolidine as electron donor have been synthesized. Compared with terthiophene bridged reference sensitizers, it was found that the TPD-based dyes not only exhibit broader absorption spectra with a bathochromically shifted maximum band than the reference dyes, but also DSSCs using the TPD-based dyes produced higher solar-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency than those of the reference dye-sensitized devices. Moreover, the incorporation of the TPD unit appears to retard charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, leading to a higher open-circuit voltage of the solar cell. Quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE38 yielded the highest η of 4.71% under AM 1.5G irradiation among the four dyes.
