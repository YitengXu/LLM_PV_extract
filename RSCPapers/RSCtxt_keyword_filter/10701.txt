However, the effect of various alkyl chains on interfacial charge transfer processes has barely been investigated. Therefore, in this work, three novel carbazole dyes with various alkyl chains are designed and applied in DSSCs. Although the optical and electrochemical properties of the dyes are only slightly improved by the alkyl chains, all the interfacial charge transfer processes, including charge injection, dye regeneration, and charge collection, are effectively promoted first and then slightly restrained as the methyl group is gradually extended to the octyl group. Therefore, owning to the suitable length of the butyl groups, dye CS-39 presents the best photovoltaic performance among the four dyes, with a photocurrent density of 15.70 mA cm−2, a photovoltage of 0.765 V, a fill factor of 0.698, and a power conversion efficiency of 8.39%. As a result, the alkyl chain presents an obvious and complex effect on various interfacial charge transfer processes. Our results provide a reasonable strategy for the design of the appropriate alkyl chain to develop efficient organic sensitizers in the future.
Introduction
During the last decade, metal free organic dyes have attracted more and more attention in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1–5 due to the low cost, acceptable photostability, and more important, easy property regulation by molecular engineering. Various electron-donating groups, including triphenylamine,6–10 coumarin,11–13 indoline,14,15 and carbazole,16–18 have been utilized as donors in typical donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) systems. Owing to their superior optical properties and photostability, carbazole derivatives become promising candidates for the donor part of highly efficient organic dyes. However, the electron-donating capability of original carbazole unit is relatively low. Thus, various molecular engineering studies have been performed on carbazole to enhance its electron-donating capability.16–19
Differing from the introduction of an additional donor unit into carbazole, in our previous works, a planarization strategy has been carried on a carbazole segment to achieve the enhancement of electron-donating capability.18,20 Moreover, with the planarization strategy, the upshift of the HOMO level is highly selective while the LUMO level is almost unaffected. However, the planarization of the molecular structure also brings another problem: the serious π-aggregation, which will decrease the photocurrent to considerable extent.21–23 Although this aggregation can be suppressed by the addition of a co-adsorbent, such as CDCA,24,25 the dye-loaded amount will decrease at the same time, thus still resulting in the decrease of photovoltaic performance. Thus, the introduction of the alkyl chains become a realistic way to avoid the aggregation. However, the introduction of the alkyl chain will also change the circumstance between interfaces, while the effect of the alkyl chain in the planar donor segment on interfacial charge transfer processes is still barely investigated.
With this in mind, in this work, the alkyl chains were further introduced into the planar carbazole group to prevent the unfavorable aggregation, and more importantly, investigate its effect on multiple interfacial charge transfer processes in DSSCs. The methyl groups in reference dye CS-15 are gradually extended to be ethyl, butyl, and octyl groups to obtain dyes CS-38–40, respectively (Scheme 1), whose anti-aggregation effect is gradually enhanced. Three main interfacial charge transfer processes, including charge injection, dye regeneration, and charge recombination, are carefully characterized and investigated in detail.

Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1a shows the UV-vis spectra of four dyes measured in chloroform while the data are also listed in Table 1. The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of CS-38–40 were determined to be 454, 456, and 456 nm, presenting 5, 7, and 7 nm redshifts compared with CS-15, respectively. Considering the similar electron-donating capability between methyl and ethyl/butyl/octyl groups, a slight redshift should arise from the suppression of the H-aggregation in solvent.26 After being loaded on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1b), obvious redshifts of 11, 9, 9, and 9 nm were found for CS-15 and CS-38–40, respectively, compared with their λmax values obtained in solvent, indicating the formation of J-aggregation for all dyes.27 The introduction of long alkyl chains into the carbazole donor presented almost no effect on J-aggregation. Moreover, the molar extinction coefficients (εmax) also slightly increase for CS-38–40 as the alky chain was extended, with respect to CS-15, which would bring them slight enhancement of light-harvesting capability. The light-harvesting efficiencies (LHE) of all dye-loaded TiO2 films were calculated and are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The CS-39-based TiO2 film presented broader light-harvesting area than those of the other dyes, in accordance with the results of their absorption spectra. The slightly lower LHE of the CS-40 sensitized TiO2 film should be attributed to its relatively lower dye-loaded amount on the TiO2 surface, arising from its larger molecular volume.

The energy levels of four dyes were determined by the cyclic voltammetry test (Fig. S2, ESI†). Quite similar oxidation potentials (HOMO) of around 1.24 V vs. NHE were found for four dyes (Table 1), which was mainly attributed to their similar electron-donating capability of the donor groups, although their alkyl chains have been extended. A large energy difference between the HOMO levels and the oxidation potential of the I−/I3− couple suggest efficient dye regeneration. Moreover, the LUMO levels of the dyes were calculated to be around −1.10 V vs. NHE, which were higher than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicating the smooth injection of excited charge.
To gain insights into the energy levels, the HOMOs and LUMOs of four dyes at their optimized geometries of the ground singlet states were also examined.28 As listed in Table 2, along with the extension of the alkyl chains, the HOMOs gradually shift from 0.90 to 0.86 V, while the HOMOs remain around −1.62 V. To be noticed, the relative tendency of theoretical energy loss was also in good accord with the experimental results. Furthermore, the HOMOs of all four dyes mainly distributed at the planar carbazole-phenyl segment. With the extension of the alkyl chains, no obvious difference was found in their HOMOs, as well as their LUMOs, which mainly distributed at the benzothiadiazole–benzoic acid part (Fig. S3, ESI†). As a result, the extension of alkyl chains in the donor segment might not affect the electrochemical properties of the dyes to a large extent.

Effect of alkyl chains on interfacial charge transfer processes
To evaluate the effect of alkyl chains on interfacial charge transfer processes, the transient PL measurements were applied to determine the PL lifetimes. As shown in Fig. 2a, the PL lifetimes in chloroform solution (τsolution) of four dyes were measured have similar values of 7.26, 7.30, 7.29, and 7.34 ns, respectively. While the dyes were loaded on the TiO2 film, the excited charges were injected into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the PL lifetimes (τTiO2) were effectively quenched to be 0.94, 0.66, 0.74, and 0.77 ns, respectively, simulating the charge injection process. Notice that the co-adsorbent CDCA was also applied in the adsorption process to fully avoid the influence of aggregation on PL lifetime. Therefore, the efficiencies of charge injection (ηinj) of four dyes were calculated according to eqn (1): (1)

Along with the extension of the alkyl chain, the ηinj value first increased from 86.98% to 90.89% and then gradually decreased to 89.83% and 89.50%, respectively (Table 3). This means that over large alkyl chains would negatively affect the charge injection process, although all four dyes possess high enough LUMO levels of over −1.00 V vs. NHE.

To estimate the efficiency of the dye regeneration process (ηreg), the ZrO2 film was utilized to prevent the excited charge injection and the excited charge would only return to the ground state through the PL emission. When the redox couple was added, from which the HOMO of the dye would accept charge, the PL was quenched. As a result, the process of dye regeneration was successfully simulated. The PL lifetimes of the dye-loaded ZrO2 film with blank electrolyte (τblank) were measured to be 6.25, 6.40, 6.00 and 6.46 ns for four dyes, respectively (Fig. 2b), which were quenched to be 0.83, 0.70, 0.61 and 0.89 ns (τI−/I3−), respectively, after the redox couple was added. Therefore, the ηreg value of CS-15 was calculated to be 86.74% according to eqn (2), while the values were enhanced to be 88.95% and 89.67% along with the extension of the alkyl chains to be ethyl and butyl for CS-38 and CS-39, respectively (Table 3). However, when the alkyl chains were further extended to be octyl, the ηreg value of CS-40 was decreased to 86.16%, which was even lower than that of CS-15. The over long alkyl chains in the donor segment of CS-40 might prevent the contact between the donor and the redox couple, thus resulting in the decrease in the ηreg value. (2)
Finally, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization was further performed on four DSSCs in the dark to estimate the effect of the alkyl chains on ηcol according to eqn (3): (3)where RCT is the charge-transfer resistance and RT is the transport resistance. Both resistance values were obtained through fitting the Nyquist plots used by Zsimpwin (Fig. S4, ESI†).
The RT values were found as analogous values of 7.3 Ω, 7.9 Ω, 5.0 Ω and 7.4 Ω for CS-15 and CS-38–40, respectively. On the other hand, the RCT value of the CS-38 sensitized DSSC was determined to be a quite large value of 1441.9 Ω, being almost 9 times higher than that of CS-15 (145.14 Ω). This means that even the slight extension of the alkyl chains from methyl to ethyl groups could obviously favor the prevention of charge recombination. When the ethyl groups were extended to butyl groups, the RCT value of CS-39 based DSSCs was greatly increased to be over 3000 Ω, suggesting continual improvement of charge recombination prevention. However, when the alkyl chains were further extended to be octyl groups, the charge recombination process was sharply enhanced instead. To investigate this accelerated charge recombination of the device based on CS-40, the dye-loaded amounts for all four dyes were measured by the desorption method. As shown in Table 3, as the alkyl chains were changed from methyl to octyl groups, the dye-loaded amounts were gradually decreased. The CS-40-loaded amount was only around 0.72 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which was only around 60% of that of CS-15, suggesting a large blank area on the TiO2 surface. Therefore, with over large steric hindrance introduced by octyl groups, the distance between dye molecules was increased, which might give enough room for I3− species to get close to the TiO2 surface, leading to fast charge recombination. However, due to the relatively low values of RT and relatively high values of RCT for all devices, the ηcol values of CS-15, CS-38, CS-39, and CS-40 based DSSCs were still estimated to be quite high values of 95.2%, 99.4%, 99.8% and 99.3%, respectively (Table 3).
Effect of alkyl chains on photovoltaic performance
To investigate the actual effect of alkyl chains on photovoltaic performance, cell devices based on CS-15 and CS-38–40 were fabricated and characterized. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of all four dyes were roughly consistent with their absorption spectra but expanded. The onset wavelength values of CS-38–40 sensitized DSSCs were found at 770, 770, and 760, nm, respectively, which were redshift to some extent compared with that of CS-15 sensitized devices (Fig. 3a). The plateau of the IPCE action spectra was observed in the range of 430–630 nm for all four dyes with values of more than 70%, while the highest IPCE value was presented by the CS-39 based DSSC (83%@470 nm). Therefore, the highest short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) was obtained by the CS-39 based DSSC as 15.70 mA cm−2 (Table 3). Considering the similar ηinj, ηreg, and ηcol values between CS-38 and CS-39, the slightly lower JSC of the CS-38 based DSSC should be attributed to its lower LHE, although its dye-loaded amount was higher than that of CS-39. In the case of the CS-40 based DSSC, the JSC value was drawn down by its relatively low ηreg and LHE values.
 Fig. 3  (a) IPCE action spectra and (b) J–V curves of CS-15 and CS-38–40-based DSSCs. 
On the other hand, as the alkyl chain expands, the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) values of the dyes gradually enhanced from 0.738 V of CS-15 to 0.765 V of CS-39, and then dropped down to 0.724 V for CS-40. As is well known, the VOC value is highly dependent on the CB edge shift (ΔECB) of TiO2 and charge recombination rate. Thus, to gain more insight into the VOC variation, the transient photovoltaic measurements were further conducted on four DSSCs.
The plots of VOC – charge density were examined to characterize the ΔECB (Fig. 4a). At a certain charge density, 84, 64, and 32 mV enhancements were found for CS-15, CS-38 and CS-39 based DSSCs, respectively, with respect to that of CS-40. This indicates that along with the extension of the alkyl chains, the conduction bands of TiO2 sensitized by CS-38–40 would be downshifted to a certain extent compared with that of CS-15. Actually, the ΔECB can be calculated using eqn (4): (4)where q is the electron charge, μnormal is the vertical dipole moment, γ is the surface dye-loaded concentration, and ε0 and ε are the permittivity values of the vacuum and organic monolayer, respectively.
 Fig. 4  The plots of (a) VOC and (b) charge lifetime against charge density for CS-15- and CS-38–40-based cell devices. 
Therefore, to expose the essential reason for the ΔECB trend, the μnormal values of CS-15, CS-38, CS-39, and CS-40 were calculated from the Gaussian calculation results. The vertical component of dipole moments decreased gradually from 4.05 D of CS-15 to 3.40 D of CS-38 (Fig. S5, ESI†). As a result, considering the decrease of both the vertical dipole moments and dye-loaded amount, the gradual decrease of ΔECB could be easily understood.
The charge recombination rates of four DSSCs were also characterized by transient photovoltaic tests (Fig. 4b). At a certain charge density, taking 8 × 1017 cm−3 as an example, the charge lifetime value of the CS-15 based device was found to be 34 ms. When the methyl groups were replaced by butyl groups, the lifetime value of the CS-39 based DSSC was sharply increased to be 246 ms, which was 6 times higher than that of CS-15. When the alkyl chains were further extended to be octyl groups, the lifetime of the CS-40 based DSSC was decreased to 68 ms, which was in well accord with the results obtained in EIS measurements. As an overall result of ΔECB of TiO2 and the charge recombination process, the VOC values of four DSSCs laid in the order of CS-39 > CS-38 > CS-15 > CS-40.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of planar carbazole dyes with various alkyl chains were designed and synthesized. Along with the gradual extension of the alkyl chains on the carbazole segment, the light-harvesting capability was slightly enhanced due to the redshift of the absorption band and the enhancement of the molar extinction coefficient, while the energy levels of dyes were barely affected. The interfacial charge transfer processes were significantly influenced by the alkyl chains: (a) the charge injection efficiency increased to the highest value of 90.89% when the ethyl groups were used as the alkyl chain, then slightly decreased to 89.50%; (b) the dye regeneration efficiency increased to the highest value of 89.67% with butyl groups as the alkyl chains; (c) as the alkyl chains were extended, the charge recombination process was effectively suppressed and the charge collection efficiency efficiently increased. Therefore, owning to the suitable length of the butyl groups, dye CS-39 presents the best photovoltaic performance among four dyes, with a photocurrent density of 15.70 mA cm−2, a photovoltage of 0.765 V, a fill factor of 0.698, and a power conversion efficiency of 8.39%. As a result, the alkyl chains in the donor segment can not only affect the molecular aggregation, but more importantly, they also present an obvious effect on interfacial charge transfer processes, which influences the photovoltaic performance to a great extent. These findings provide us a reasonable strategy to design an appropriate alkyl chain for efficient organic sensitizers.
Experimental

Instruments for the characterization of optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties
The UV-visible spectra of all dyes were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrometer. The steady PL spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-4600 spectrometer while the transient PL signals were obtained on an FLS980 spectrometer (excited at 450 nm and detected at 680 nm). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on a CHI660B workstation.

J–V curves were obtained by using an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the light source. The power was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a reference silicon cell. The IPCE action spectra were measured with a monochromator (SCS10, Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd).
The EIS data were collected with an Impedance Analyzer, with the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz and an alternative signal of 5 mV at a constant temperature of 25 °C under the dark conditions. The spectra were analyzed using Zsimpwin software. The charge lifetime and charge density in the complete DSSCs were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of photocurrent and voltage using a PSL-100.
The experimental details for all characterization of properties are all shown in the ESI.†
Theoretical calculations
The theoretical calculations were all carried out by the Gaussian 09 program. The ground-state geometries of the dyes were simulated on the basis of B3LYP with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The solvation effects (chloroform) were taken into account.
