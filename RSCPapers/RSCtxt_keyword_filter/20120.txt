    , Accepted 5th February 2019First published on 6th February 2019AbstractTetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is employed to modify the surface and electrical properties of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes in perovskite solar cells. Synchronously, owing to the flow of unbound TMA+ ions into the perovskite, the trap density of the perovskite overlayer is largely reduced. Conductivity of the grain boundaries in the perovskite layer is also greatly increased. A high efficiency of 20.1% along with a reduced J–V hysteresis in our champion perovskite solar cells without electron transport layers is achieved.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained extensive attention in the past decade due to their intriguing optoelectronic properties, such as strong solar absorption, low binding-energy exciton, high carrier mobility, long carrier lifetime, and low non-radiative carrier recombination rate.1 Since the first report on PSCs in 2009,2 significant progress has been made in device structure design, perovskite crystal growth and interface engineering, which have boosted the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 23.2% in 2018.3 This high PCE has met the requirement for commercial applications. The present focus in this field lies in the development of highly-efficient PSCs with simultaneously enhanced stability and simplified fabrication process that features scalability, low cost and feasibility for fast roll-to-roll mass production to facilitate the commercialization. However, typical highly-efficient PSCs commonly utilize a dense titanium oxide (TiO2) layer and a mesoporous TiO2 layer as electron transport layers (ETLs). The fabrication of a dense TiO2 ETL requires high-temperature annealing which is incompatible with plastic substrates and also highly energy and time consuming, impeding the rapid industrial production.
Thanks to the deep understanding of the working principle of PSCs, a planar device without the TiO2 mesoporous layer has been successfully developed.4–7 On the other hand, the dense TiO2 layer could also be replaced by low-temperature processed SnO28 and ZnO layers4etc. However, deposition of these alternative compact ETLs is still nontrivial due to the complex precursor preparation and post treatment processes. In this regard, it is highly desirable that the PSC structure can be further simplified by eliminating the compact ETL. Given the easy dissociation of electron–hole pairs possessing low binding energies and the long lifetime of the dissociated charge carriers,9,10 ETL-free devices can theoretically be realized with reasonably high efficiencies. Nevertheless, the existing ETL-free PSCs yield a low PCE around 10% or below,9,11–13 primarily because the direct deposition of perovskite films on pristine transparent conductive oxide (TCO) usually results in poor surface finish and coverage,11,14,15 which may incur severe recombination and shunting. The effective approaches to suppress the charge recombination in perovskite or at the TCO/perovskite interface, thus enhancing the device performance include pre-treatment of TCO (UV/O3 irradiation) and judicious modification of the composition, structure, and morphology of the perovskite layer.11,16,17 However, these ETL-free devices still exhibited a relatively low efficiency of <18%, which is considerably lower than that of their counterparts equipped with an ETL. The ETL-free PSCs also suffer from the issues of severe hysteresis and unstable stabilized-power-output which is presumably due to the unbalanced charge transfer rate and the lack of a permanent built-in field in the absence of an ETL.14,18 On the other hand, surface modification of an FTO substrate using a self-assembled fullerene monolayer (SAM) can enhance the device performance and alleviate the hysteresis of PSCs.19,20 The downside of this approach includes the high cost and complex preparation process of fullerene derivatives. Therefore, it is critical to develop ETL-free PSCs with high efficiency comparable to those of ETL-containing cells using a facile but efficient route.
In this work, an impressive efficiency of 20.1% was obtained by FTO surface modification by tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) for PSCs in a simplified structure of glass/FTO–TMAH/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The improved device performance can be ascribed to the enhanced charge extraction/transport, decreased trap density and reduced charge recombination rate at the FTO/perovskite interface and in the perovskite layer as well. This work demonstrated the great potential of our ETL-free PSCs for commercialization due to the high efficiency, simple structures, low-cost and potential compatibility with efficient roll-to-roll mass fabrication.
As displayed in Fig. 1a and b, the bare FTO and TMAH-treated FTO (FTO–TMAH) show a similar surface morphology. The root-mean-square roughness of the bare FTO and FTO–TMAH is determined to be 12.5 nm and 12.2 nm, respectively. The unchanged morphology and slightly reduced roughness indicate the formation of a very thin TMAH layer on FTO. As shown in the c-AFM results (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1a, ESI†), an ohm contact is observed for the bare FTO substrate, but an obvious Schottky contact is formed for FTO–TMAH, demonstrating the change of FTO surface electrical properties after TMAH treatment. As revealed by the XPS spectra (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†), the binding energy of Sn 3d5/2 shifts from 488.34 eV to 485.66 eV while the binding energy of O 1s shifts from 532.15 eV to 529.70 eV, indicating a strong interaction between N of TMA+ ions and FTO. This interaction is further evidenced by the emergence of peaks located at 1731 cm−1 (O:N interaction between FTO and TMA+) in the FTIR spectra, even though the FTO–TMAH substrate was thoroughly rinsed at least 3 times by water (Fig. S4, ESI†). Based on the XPS and FTIR results, it therefore can be proposed that the positively charged (CH3)4N+ ions (TMA+) can firmly bond with the O dangling bonds on the FTO surface to form a dipole layer, similar to the reported work,21 as shown in Fig. 1d. As revealed by the UPS spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†), the establishment of this dipole layer on the FTO surface decreases the work function of the FTO electrode from 4.44 eV to 4.18 eV by decreasing the electrostatic potential energy immediately outside the surface.22 Therefore, hole transport from the perovskite to the positive charge modified FTO is greatly restricted, resulting in a reduction in the rate of bimolecular recombination at the FTO–TMAH/perovskite interface.

(d) Schematic diagram showing the band alignment of FTO, FTO–TMAH, and perovskite, respectively. The formation of a possible dipole on the TMAH-treated FTO surface is also demonstrated. 
As depicted in the SEM and AFM images in Fig. S6 (ESI†), perovskite layers deposited on both bare FTO (O2 plasma treated) and FTO–TMAH substrate are compact. This feature of the perovskite film is beneficial for promoting light absorption and charge transport. Notably, in order to minimize the surface defects in the deposited perovskite overlayer, in particular the pin holes, bare FTO substrates need to be treated with O2-plasma for at least 20 min prior to the perovskite deposition. Both perovskite thin films show a strong absorption in the ultraviolet–visible range and the absorption edge was determined to be about 773 nm, which is in good agreement with the results from the steady state PL spectra (Fig. S7, ESI†). The XPS results show a significant augmentation in N 1s, O 1s and C 1s peak intensity and element concentration for FTO–TMAH/perovskite (Fig. S8 and Table S1, ESI†). The binding energy peaks centered at 403.6 and 402.1 eV can be assigned to N 1s from TMA+ and perovskite, respectively, indicating the presence of TMAH in the perovskite film (Fig. S8d, ESI†). It is reasonable that a bound layer and an unbound TMAH layer would co-exist on the FTO surface after the TMAH spin-coating. During the growth of the perovskite film, the unbound and DMF-soluble TMAH will re-disperse into the perovskite precursor, adsorb on the perovskite crystallite surface and finally segregate at the grain boundaries (GBs).
To further study the effect of TMAH on the electrical properties of the perovskite overlayer, c-AFM measurement was performed. Fig. 2a and b show the c-AFM images of perovskite layers on the FTO and FTO–TMAH substrate, respectively. Interestingly, the conductivity at the GBs is higher than that of the crystal bulk for the FTO–TMAH/perovskite sample. In marked contrast, the reverse is true for the FTO/perovskite sample (Fig. 2c and d), which is in line with the general fact that the crystal bulk is electrically more conductive than the GBs are. We ascribed the abnormally high conductivity at GBs of FTO–TMAH/perovskite to the improved electron transport by the alleviated defect-induced electron scattering (shown later) on one hand. Additionally, the presence of built-in potential around the charged GBs (by TMA+) would possibly accelerate the charge carrier (electron, hole and ionic) transport.23,24

To confirm the defect passivation effect of TMAH on the perovskite thin films, steady-state PL and transient-PL measurements were conducted on perovskite thin films deposited on glass slides with/without TMAH treatment. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PL intensity for glass-TMAH/perovskite is much higher than that of perovskite on bare glass, indicating a lower defect density in perovskite with TMAH modifications.

This lower defect density is also evidenced by the longer carrier lifetime as illustrated in the transient-PL results (Fig. 3b). The trap density nt is calculated by a trap-fill-limited voltage VTFL based on a space-charge-limited current measurement (Fig. 3c), according the equation VTFL = entL2/2εε0, where the e, L, ε and ε0 are elementary charge, the thickness of the thin film, the relative dielectric constant and vacuum permittivity, respectively. The ε is determined by impedance measurement at 105 HZ (Fig. 3d). The calculated trap density decreases from 1.27 × 1016 cm−3 to 0.75 × 1016 cm−3 after TMAH treatment. It is reasonable that the positively charged TMA+ cations will passivate the halide-induced traps.25 Additionally, the emergence of TMAH in the GBs can effectively suppress the formation of metallic Pb0 which is commonly deemed as a bimolecular recombination center (Fig. S9, ESI†). On the other hand, the steady PL intensity of the perovskite on the FTO–TMAH substrate as shown in Fig. 3a is quenched more effectively in comparison to that of the perovskite on the FTO substrate. This can be well explained by the faster charge transport within the perovskite layer and enhanced electron extraction from the perovskite to a TMAH-modified FTO collector. The enhanced electron extraction is also confirmed by a faster decay of the TR-PL intensity as shown in Fig. 3b. The enhanced electron extraction, fast charge transport and suppressed recombination will improve the device performance.
PSC devices with a configuration of glass/FTO–TMAH/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were constructed and a typical cross-sectional SEM image of our device is shown in Fig. 4a. Devices on the untreated FTO substrate were also fabricated for comparison purposes. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are 1.17 V, 23.22 mA cm−2, and 0.739, respectively, resulting in an efficiency of 20.1% for TMAH modified champion PSCs with an optimized TMAH concentration of 0.25 wt% (Fig. 4b and Fig. S10, Table S2, ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, both the efficiency and Voc are record high for ETL-free PSCs. In contrast, the overall performance of devices without TMAH treatment is inferior, with typical Voc, Jsc, FF and efficiency being 1.02 V, 22.49 mA cm−2, 0.624 and 14.4%, respectively. The improved Voc is closely correlated to the defect passivation effect of TMAH on the perovskite layer as discussed in PL and SCLC characterizations, and is also well understood by the decreased reverse saturation current in the J–V characteristics in the dark (Fig. S11, ESI†). Besides, the presence of dipoles at the FTO/perovskite interface may also reduce electron–hole recombination, giving rise to further improvements in Voc. The enhanced FF can be ascribed to the reduced resistivity arising from the enhanced charge transport at perovskite GBs. As displayed in Fig. 4c, a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the long wavelength range is observed in the FTO–TMAH based PSCs, which is in accordance with a slightly increased Jsc. The integrated Jsc from EQE is calculated to be 22.66 and 21.75 mA cm−2 for FTO–TMAH and bare FTO based PSCs, respectively, which is in line with that obtained from the I–V results. Mott–Schottky plots of PSCs in the dark (Fig. 3d) show an improved built-in potential (Vbi, 0.89 V vs. 0.81 V) for TMAH modified PSCs, demonstrating decreased trap states, fast carrier collection and less charge accumulation at the interfaces. The variations of Jsc and Voc under different light intensities are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The slope of 2.03kT/q is observed for TMAH passivation devices, which is slower than 2.7kT/q for FTO based devices. This also indicates a substantially reduced trap assisted recombination and efficient charge extraction resulting from suppressed recombination.

For bare FTO based PSCs, the efficiency is tested to be 14.4% and 6.5% for the reverse and forward scan, respectively (Fig. S12a and Table S3, ESI†). In contrast, the reverse scan and forward scan efficiencies are 20.1% and 18.5%, respectively, for the device based on FTO–TMAH (Fig. S13b, ESI†). This result indicates that the modification of FTO by TMAH reduces the device hysteresis significantly. Based on the evolution of the current density curves as shown in Fig. 4d, the stabilized PCE is found to be 6.6% and 19.1% for FTO and FTO–TMAH based devices, respectively. It is noted that the current density of the FTO–TMAH device rises much quickly to reach the steady state than that of the bare FTO based device. The slow rising of photo-current to a saturated value indicates the slower charge transport process in the FTO based device, mainly due to defect-assisted recombination, given the higher density of defects.26 After the passivation of defects by TMAH, the defect-assisted recombination is mitigated. As a consequence, the charge transport becomes easier, leading to the current reaching the steady state faster and reduced hysteresis behavior due to the alleviated charge accumulation in the FTO–TMAH based device. What is more, the performance of our FTO–TMAH based PSCs is quite reliable and reproducible as evidenced by the measurement results of over 20 devices (Fig. S14, ESI†). Notably, the device based on FTO–TMAH retains 90% of its initial efficiency after storage in the dark for 400 h (30 ± 5% humidity, 30 °C), whereas the FTO based device shows a faster degradation (Fig. S15, ESI†). The enhanced stability may be attributed to the suppressed defect-induced degradation of PSCs.25
In conclusion, we reported a highly efficient ETL-free PSC with a device efficiency of 20.1%. The key to maintain the high efficiency of PSCs in the absence of an ETL is to facilely treat the FTO substrate using the simplest quaternary ammonium base, TMAH. TMAH can not only modify the electrical properties of FTO by forming a layer of surface dipoles, but also passivate defects in the perovskite overlayer and increase conductivity at the perovskite GBs. Consequently, enhanced charge transport and reduced recombination in PSC devices were realized and device efficiency was substantially enhanced. Besides, the hysteresis in the J–V curves was also effectively reduced. Our work paves a new way for achieving a simple structure of PSCs, thus facilitating mass production of the PSCs by roll-to-roll technology.
