    , Accepted 17th January 2023First published on 18th January 2023AbstractShort-wave infrared (SWIR) light sources featuring large spectral bandwidth and high luminescence efficiency have found wide applications in the fields of night vision, non-destructive detection, covert information identification, and biomedical imaging. In particular, phosphor-converted SWIR emitters are attracting much attention owing to their simple processing conditions, low product price, compact design, and tunable luminescence feature. However, discovering phosphor materials that emit completely in the SWIR spectral region (>900 nm) when excited by blue light remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a novel Yb-based inorganic phosphor, KYbP2O7:Cr3+, exhibiting pure and efficient SWIR photoluminescence in the wavelength range of 900–1200 nm upon blue light excitation. The formation of Cr3+–Yb3+ redox ion pairs results in efficient energy transfer from Cr3+ to Yb3+ in the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor. This new phosphor has a relatively high photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 51.4% and good thermal stability, maintaining 55.6% of the room temperature luminescence intensity at 120 °C. The as-fabricated SWIR-LED prototype devices through a combination of the optimized phosphor with blue LED chips can generate a maximum SWIR output power of 8.0 mW at 150 mA drive current, demonstrating great potential for practical applications. This work will open a new research avenue for the development of efficient, stable, and cost-effective phosphor-converted SWIR emitters.
Introduction
Short-wave infrared (SWIR, 900–1700 nm) light sources have attracted a great deal of interest for their promising advanced applications in non-destructive identification, night vision, biomedical imaging and optical communication.1–5 Recently, the urgent requirement to couple SWIR emitters with portable electronic devices for multifunctional applications necessitated the development of light sources with compact size, long lifetime, high conversion efficiency, and low product price.6–9 Conventional light sources such as halogen–tungsten lamps have already been commercialized and widely used because of their super-broadband emission ranging from near-UV to middle-IR, but they are restricted by large body size, high power consumption, short lifetime, and high working temperature.10 Several classes of emerging SWIR light sources have also been developed in the past decades. For example, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) have been widely used for their compactness, low energy expense, and long lifetime. Nevertheless, the quite narrow emission band and high production price limit their practical applications in daily life.11,12
In recent years, SWIR phosphor-converted LEDs (pc-LEDs) have become an alternative to the aforementioned SWIR emitters by learning from the solid-state white lighting technology, considering their distinct merits such as simple processing conditions, low product price, compact design, and tunable spectral properties.13–16 The SWIR emissive phosphor layer outside the blue-chip plays a crucial role in converting the blue photons from the chip into SWIR light, which will then determine the final luminescence performance of the pc-LED bulbs. Therefore, discovering desirable SWIR-emitting phosphors with strong absorption in the blue region, high photoluminescence efficiency, and good thermal stability is of great significance for SWIR pc-LEDs. Inspired by this need, a lot of related research work has been conducted to explore phosphor materials suitable for SWIR emitters.17 For instance, Liao et al. assembled a SWIR LED prototype device by integrating a Ca14Zn6Ga10O35:Mn phosphor with a 450 nm blue chip, achieving SWIR luminescence centered at 1152 nm owing to the energy transfer from Mn4+ to Mn5+.18 Saikia et al. reported a SWIR prototype device by combining a Cs2NaInCl6:Sb3+,Er3+ phosphor with a commercial UV LED chip, yielding stable emission bands peaking at 450 and 1540 nm.19 Zhao et al. demonstrated a SWIR LED prototype device emitting over the 700–1100 nm wavelength region through combining a Sr9Cr(PO4)7:Yb3+ phosphor with a blue LED chip, affording a photoelectric efficiency of 9.5% at 20 mA.20 Miao et al. fabricated a SWIR LED device by coating a blue LED chip with a LiScGeO4:Cr3+ phosphor, exhibiting a SWIR radiant power of 4.78 mW with an electro-optical conversion efficiency of 4.4% at 60 mA.21 Yuan et al. coupled a Ni2+-doped Y3Al2Ga3O12 phosphor with a commercial near-ultraviolet LED chip to build broadband SWIR LED devices, covering from 1150 to 1700 nm with a power conversion efficiency of 0.43% at 10 mA input current.22 Besides, using Cr3+ → Ni2+ energy transfer, blue LED-pumped SWIR luminescence of Ni2+ with high output power and conversion efficiency has been successively reported in LiMgPO4:Cr3+,Ni2+ and MgO:Cr3+,Ni2+ phosphors, respectively.23,24
For SWIR photoluminescence, trivalent ytterbium (Yb3+) is a favorable emitting center in solids due to its infrared emission (usually near 1000 nm) assigned to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition. Benefiting from the SWIR emission band at around 1000 nm and intense absorption at around 980 nm, several potentialities of Yb3+-based luminescent materials have been researched for various kinds of applications, such as lasers and scintillators emitting in the SWIR region as well as spectral convertors for use in crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells.25–27 Moreover, the relatively high oscillator strength of the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 absorption makes it possible to use Yb3+ as an efficient sensitizer to activate other rare earth ions to realize some novel luminescence processes, such as photon up-conversion in Yb3+/Ln3+ co-doped systems.28–32 However, the unique energy level structure allows Yb3+ to be excited only by short UV light (<300 nm, charge transfer state) and infrared light (>900 nm), resulting in no absorption in the visible spectral region.33,34 Accordingly, it is a big challenge to achieve high-efficiency SWIR photoluminescence by exciting Yb3+-doped phosphors with commercially available and cost-effective blue LED chips. In order to obtain blue light excitable SWIR luminescence, co-doping Cr3+–Yb3+ ion pairs in the inorganic matrix has proved to be an effective strategy to realize ultra-wide infrared emission (600–1200 nm) and enhance photoluminescence performance (e.g., quantum efficiency and luminescence thermal stability) upon blue LED excitation, in consideration of the broad absorption band of Cr3+ in the blue region and the spectral overlap between the emission of Cr3+ and the absorption of Yb3+.35,36 By making use of this strategy, broadband NIR luminescence with a large FWMH and high photoluminescence efficiency was first reported by He et al. (FWMH: 160 nm) and Yao et al. (FWMH: 210 nm), respectively.37,38 In recent years, several Cr3+–Yb3+ co-doped luminescent materials with broadband emission bands have also emerged, such as Lu2CaMg2Ge3O12:Cr3+,Yb3+ (FWMH: 200 nm, IQE of 84.2%),16 Sr9Cr(PO4)7:Yb3+ (FWMH: 200 nm, IQE of 49.2%),20 and Ca2LaZr2Ga2.8Al0.2O12:Cr3+,Yb3+ (FWMH: 200 nm, IQE of 64.5%).39 However, such broadband NIR luminescence usually requires that the emission bands of Cr3+ and Yb3+ exist simultaneously and their luminescence intensities are almost the same when excited by a blue LED. On the other hand, a handful of research works have also been carried out to obtain the dominant Yb3+ emission by increasing the Yb3+ doping concentration. For example, Liu et al. reported the infrared luminescence of Yb3+ emitters by codoping Yb3+ in a LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor, but the as-prepared LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+,Yb3+ phosphor shows low internal quantum efficiency (10%) and poor thermal stability (31%@95 °C) under 492 nm excitation.13 To take it forward, our group recently demonstrated a SWIR LED prototype device emitting at around 1000 nm through combining a Lu0.2Sc0.8BO3:2%Cr3+,5%Yb3+ phosphor with a blue LED chip, affording 18.4 mW SWIR radiant power and an electricity-to-SWIR light energy conversion efficiency of 5.0% at 120 mA.40 Nevertheless, acquiring pure and efficient SWIR luminescence of Yb3+ in the wavelength range of over 900–1200 nm upon blue light excitation is still a challenging work.
Here in this work, we report the design and development of a novel Cr3+-doped Yb-based pyrophosphate phosphor, KYbP2O7:Cr3+, which can be excited effectively by a blue LED chip and generate pure and efficient SWIR luminescence of Yb3+. The SWIR photoluminescence properties of the as-prepared KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor have been studied, which shows multimodal emission bands over 900–1200 nm with the excitation of broadband blue light. This new phosphor has a high internal quantum yield of 51.4% and good thermal stability (55.6%@120 °C). Furthermore, SWIR pc-LEDs fabricated through a combination of the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor with a blue LED chip exhibit an intense SWIR emission (8.0 mW@150 mA), which shows high promise for applications in nondestructive detection and invisible information identification.
Experimental
Synthesis
KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphors were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-state reaction technique. K2CO3 (99.9%), Yb2O3 (99.9%), NH4H2PO4 (99.9%), and Cr2O3 (99.9%) were stoichiometrically added to an agate mortar and thoroughly grounded. The obtained mixtures were pre-sintered at 350 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace and moved out for secondary grinding. Then the powders were sintered at 900 °C in air for 4 h to obtain the final samples.
Fabrication of SWIR LEDs
Low-power SWIR LEDs were fabricated by coupling the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor with 475 nm blue chips. The phosphor powder and high refractive index encapsulation silicone glue (BQ-8229A/B, Betterly New Materials Co., Ltd) were thoroughly mixed in a mass ratio of 1:1 and then deposited on the blue LED chips. The photoelectric properties of the fabricated SWIR LEDs were collected using a HAAS 2000 photoelectric measuring system (350–1650 nm, EVERFINE). The high-power SWIR LEDs were fabricated through combining the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor with high power blue LED chips (LEDGUHON, 460–465 nm) for application demonstration.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a DMAX-2500PC X-ray diffractometer. The crystal structure refinement is based on the General structure Analysis System (GSAS) program. The morphology and element mapping patterns were acquired using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7800F). The diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained from the UH4150 spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence spectra and decay curves were obtained on an FLS1000 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with both continuous and pulsed xenon lamps. The temperature-dependent spectrum was measured using a TAP02 high-temperature fluorescence test attachment. A Hamamatsu Quantaurus-QY Plus spectrofluorometer is used to get the absolute quantum efficiency. A thermal imaging camera (FLIR A300) was used to measure the operating temperature of the SWIR LEDs. A digital camera (Canon EOS 800D) and a SWIR camera (Raptor Owl 640 S) were used to capture visible and SWIR images respectively.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure and morphology
The KYbP2O7 compound belongs to the monoclinic system with the space group of P21/c, whose crystal structure was first studied by Horchani-Naifer.41 The crystal structure diagram of KYbP2O7 is presented in Fig. 1a. The KYbP2O7 structure is made up of [PO4] tetrahedrons and distorted [YbO6] octahedrons. Moreover, the [YbO6] octahedron is connected to two [PO4] tetrahedrons through corner-sharing to form a [YbP2O7] unit as the basic unit of the KYbP2O7 structure, and K+ ions are located at the channels formed by [PO4] tetrahedrons and [YbO6] octahedrons.

It can be seen from the crystal structure that every Yb3+ site is the same, indicating that there is only one kind of octahedral coordination for the Cr3+ ions. Considering the ionic radius of Cr3+ (CN = 6, 0.615 Å) and Yb3+ (CN = 6, 0.868 Å), Cr3+ dopants most likely occupy Yb3+ sites because of the same valence and coordination number. In addition, the photoluminescence and excitation spectra of KYbP2O7:Cr3+ further confirm that Cr3+ ions enter the octahedron, which will be discussed in detail later. However, the large ionic radius difference between Cr3+ and Yb3+ leads to the contraction of the lattice, resulting in a distorted octahedral structure. The distorted lattice causes an uneven symmetric field, which promotes the deviation from inversion symmetry in the octahedral site occupied by Cr3+, helping in breaking the parity-forbidden transition of Cr3+.42–46
XRD patterns of KYbP2O7:xCr3+ (x = 0–0.10) are depicted in Fig. 1b, and are mainly consistent with the standard XRD data of the potassium ytterbium diphosphate phase (COD No. 2212297), indicating that the addition of Cr3+ does not generate the second impurity. With the increase of Cr3+ doping concentration, the XRD patterns of the KYbP2O7:xCr3+ (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10) phosphors remain almost unchanged. To get detailed crystallographic information, GSAS software was used for Rietveld refinement, and the refinement results are displayed in Fig. 1c. The reliable factors are Rwp = 7.89% and Rp = 5.18% for the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor, suggesting the formation of a crystalline phosphor with a nearly pure phase. The detailed refined structure information of the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor is given in Table S1 (ESI†).
The morphology and elemental composition of the selected KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor particles were investigated by using SEM, and are presented in Fig. 1d, indicating that the sample has an irregular shape with a size ranging from 2–8 μm. Mapping the elemental distribution on a selected particle using EDS reveals that the K, Yb, P, O, and Cr elements are homogeneously dispersed throughout the whole particle. The measured element content is nearly consistent with the theoretical value according to the EDS spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†).
SWIR photoluminescence properties of the KYbP2O7:xCr3+ phosphors

Fig. 2a shows the diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra of undoped KYbP2O7 and KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphors. As for the DR curve of the KYbP2O7 host, the strong absorption band below 300 nm corresponds to the charge transfer state (CTS) from O2− to Yb3+,34 while the other absorption peak located at 970 nm can be attributed to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+. Compared with the KYbP2O7 host, the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor is endowed with additional three strong absorption bands peaking at 310, 485, and 714 nm after Cr3+ doping, which are owing to the 4A2 → 4T1 (4P), 4A2 → 4T1 (4F) and 4A2 → 4T2 (4F) transitions of Cr3+, respectively. Moreover, the optical band gap of the KYbP2O7 host can be calculated through the following formulae based on the Kubelka–Munk function:47 (1) (2)where F(R) refers to the absorption, R is the reflectance, hν is the photon energy, A is a constant, Eg is the band gap value and the value of exponent n represents the transition coefficient. The values of n are 1/2 and 2 for direct allowed transition and indirect allowed transition, respectively. Thus, according to the calculated Kubelka–Munk absorption spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†), the optical band gap can be estimated to be 4.30 eV.

The photoluminescence and excitation spectra of the KYbP2O7 host are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The excitation spectrum monitored at 1007 nm emission shows an intense excitation peak at 267 nm, which can be assigned to the Yb3+–O2− charge transfer state in the KYbP2O7 host. In addition, the emission bands centered at 973, 1006, and 1061 nm can be attributed to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+. Fig. 2b presents the excitation and emission spectra of the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor at room temperature. As can be seen from the photoluminescence excitation spectrum monitored at 1007 nm, four evident excitation bands peaking at 268, 318, 489, and 713 nm are observed, originating from the CTB, 4A2 → 4T1 (4P), 4A2 → 4T1 (4F), and 4A2 → 4T2 (4F) transitions of Cr3+ respectively. The narrow excitation peak at 675 nm (R-line) can be assigned to the 4A2 → 2E (2G) spin-forbidden transition.48 Interestingly, the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor shows pure and intense SWIR photoluminescence over 900–1200 nm under the excitation at 490 nm, which is typical SWIR luminescence of Yb3+ rather than the NIR emission of Cr3+. The emission band of the phosphor features a fine spectral structure with three main peaks at 972, 1007, and 1061 nm, which can be ascribed to different transitions between the stark levels of the 2F5/2 excited state and 2F7/2 ground state of Yb3+.49 Therefore, it can be concluded that the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor can be effectively excited by broadband blue light to produce pure and intense SWIR radiation, showing high promise for SWIR pc-LED application. The photoluminescence and excitation spectra of KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ at 77 K are depicted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Four emission peaks at 972, 1000, 1022, and 1061 nm can be identified in the emission spectrum at 77 K, which is slightly different from the emission spectrum at room temperature. This phenomenon can also be observed in some other Yb3+ doped compounds.50,51 The photoluminescence spectra of the KYbP2O7:xCr3+ (x = 0.05–0.10) phosphors with varied Cr3+ doping concentrations when excited by 490 nm light are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). With the Cr3+ doping content increasing from 0.005 to 0.10, the SWIR emission intensity increases gradually and reaches a maximum when x = 0.01. The breaking of the parity-forbidden transition of Cr3+ should also contribute to the increase of the SWIR luminescence intensity of Yb3+ due to the increase of the excitation transition of Cr3+.46 Then the SWIR luminescence intensity shows a decreasing trend with a further increase in Cr3+ content owing to the concentration quenching effect.52,53 It is worth noting that the NIR emission of Cr3+ that should have appeared theoretically was completely quenched, while the Yb3+ SWIR luminescence dominates in the emission spectrum. Since Cr3+ tends to be oxidized to Cr4+ and Yb3+ is easily reduced to Yb2+, the electron transfer can occur between the doped Cr3+ and Yb3+ to form Cr3+–Yb3+ redox ion pairs in the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor. The formation of an intermediate Cr4+–Yb2+ charge transfer state that involves the photoionization of Cr3+ and electron trapping of Yb3+ is responsible for the quenching of Cr3+ luminescence and intense SWIR luminescence of Yb3+.54,55
The crystal environment of the host lattice has a great influence on the emission spectrum of Cr3+. As the Tanabe–Sugano diagram can clearly show the energy level distribution of Cr3+ located in octahedral sites (Fig. 2c), the crystal field strength of the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor can be evaluated using the following equations:56,57 10Dq = E(4T2) = E(4A2 → 4T2)(3) ΔE = E(4T1) − E(4T2) = E(4A2 → 4T1) − E(4A2 → 4T2)(4) (5)where Dq is the crystal field parameter and B represents the Racah parameter. E(4T1) and E(4T2) are equilibrium positions of the 4T1 and 4T2 levels respectively, which can be obtained from the excitation spectra. Accordingly, the Dq/B value can be calculated as 2.07, which indicates that the Cr3+ enters a weak crystal field.
The fluorescence decay curve is an efficient way to explore the energy transfer process between Cr3+ and Yb3+. The decay curves of KYbP2O7:xCr3+ phosphors are depicted in Fig. 2d and Fig. S6 (ESI†), which are obtained when excited at 490 nm and monitored at 1007 nm. All the decay curves can be fitted to a single exponential function as follows:58 (6)where I(t) and I0 are luminescence intensities at time t and 0, τ is the lifetime and A is a constant. Apparently, the lifetime shows an increasing trend first and then decreases with the increase of Cr3+ doping concentration. The changing trend was almost identical to that of the SWIR luminescence intensity. The lifetimes of the KYbP2O7:0.005Cr3+ and KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphors are calculated to be 1.78 and 1.83 ms, respectively. With the further increase of the Cr3+ doping content from 0.03 to 0.1, the lifetimes decrease rapidly from 0.43 to 0.21 ms, evidencing the enhanced nonradiative transition with higher Cr3+ concentration.59,60 With the increase of doping concentration, the curve slightly deviates from the single exponential function owing to the inequivalent Cr3+ sites distributed in the octahedrons.61 The internal and external quantum efficiencies of the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor are also measured to evaluate its SWIR photoluminescence performances as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), and they are determined to be 51.4% and 8.8%, respectively.
Luminescence performance of the fabricated SWIR LED prototype device
Luminescence thermal stability plays an important role in determining the practical applications of the as-prepared SWIR phosphors. For instance, the fabricated LED devices usually work at temperatures of up to 100 °C. A serious nonradiative process will take place at a high working temperature, thus the phosphor material usually shows a reduced emission intensity. Accordingly, the luminescence thermal stability of the reported KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor is also needed to be evaluated. Fig. 3a presents the SWIR photoluminescence spectra of the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor at varied temperatures ranging from 30 to 210 °C with a gradient of 30 °C. A gradual decrease in the integrated photoluminescence intensity is observed as the testing temperature increases. Generally, the thermal quenching mechanism of Cr3+ doped phosphors can be explained by cross-relaxation due to the occurrence of the electron–phonon coupling (EPC) between the Cr3+ emitters and the host.62 With the increase of the temperature, the excited electrons prefer to reach the intersection of the 4T2 and 4A2 energy levels of Cr3+ and then return to the ground state by non-radiative transition rather than light emission due to the EPC effect.59,63 The increase of temperature will intensify the EPC effect, leading to a reduction of energy transferred from Cr3+ to Yb3+, resulting in the decrease of the Yb3+ SWIR luminescence. Significantly, it can be found that the integrated SWIR emission intensity of the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor at 120 °C retains 55.6% of the room temperature SWIR luminescence intensity, which is better than those of most of the other AMP2O7 compounds (for example, ∼30%@120 °C in LiScP2O7:Cr3+, 51%@100 °C in LiGaP2O7:Cr3+, 47.5%@100 °C in NaInP2O7:Cr3+, and 47%@100 °C in LiInP2O7:Cr3+),38,64–66 suggesting that the phosphor has a fairly good luminescence thermal stability. Furthermore, as can be seen from Fig. 3a, along with the increase of temperature, the emission peak, FWHM, and profile remain almost unchanged despite the relative intensity of the peaks fluctuating. The intensities of the three emission peaks (972, 1007, and 1061 nm) of the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor get closer and closer and finally reach almost the same value at 210 °C.

(f) SWIR output power and (g) SWIR photoelectric efficiency of the SWIR LED as a function of the driving current from 10 to 150 mA. 
The activation energy (ΔE) has a remarkable correlation with the thermal quenching effect, which can be calculated using the Arrhenius equation:67,68 (7)where IT and I0 refer to the integrated intensity of the emission spectrum at a given temperature and room temperature, respectively. A is a constant related to the matrix and k is the Boltzmann constant with a value of 8.617 × 10−5 eV K−1. ΔE means the activation energy, describing the energy gap from the lowest position of the excitation level to the intersection of the excitation level and the ground state level. The fitting line is shown in Fig. 3b and the value of ΔE can be determined to be 0.32 eV, which accounts for the good luminescence thermal stability of the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor.
The remarkable feature of the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor is that it can convert blue light into pure and intense SWIR luminescence. Therefore, it can be combined with commercial blue LED chips to construct portable SWIR light sources. Therefore, the SWIR LED prototype device is fabricated by using a blue LED chip (475 nm) and the KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor. Fig. 3c shows the emission spectra of the SWIR LED device at different input currents. As shown in Fig. 3c, the luminescence intensity shows an increasing trend along with the increase of the current from 20 to 300 mA. Fig. 3d exhibits the SWIR luminescence images of the LED device in a working state at varied input currents. The brightness of the SWIR LED device increases with increasing input current, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 3c. Furthermore, as the drive current increases from 20 to 300 mA (Fig. 3e), the operating temperature of the LED device increases from 29.6 to 73.6 °C, indicating that part of the input electric energy is converted into heat energy. Fig. 3f and g show the luminescence properties of the fabricated SWIR LED. The SWIR device can provide an output power of 8.0 mW at 150 mA (Fig. 3f), and the photoelectric conversion efficiency is calculated to be 1.7% (Fig. 3g). These results suggest that the fabricated LED prototype device performs well in terms of the SWIR output power and energy conversion efficiency. Additionally, the luminescence performance of the fabricated LED devices can be further improved by the technical optimization of LED fabrication.
Applications of the fabricated SWIR LEDs
To demonstrate the appealing features of SWIR light, a series of applications were designed by using the fabricated high-power SWIR LED. Fig. 4a1–d1 show the images taken by using a standard digital camera in an indoor ambient light environment, while Fig. 4a2–d2 show the photographs taken by a SWIR camera using the fabricated SWIR LED device as a light source. Because different kinds of fibers have distinct absorption coefficients to SWIR light, they present different gray levels under the illumination of the SWIR light source. As shown in Fig. 4a1, the hairpiece and real hair cannot be distinguished by the naked eye under the illumination of a white LED. However, they can be easily identified under the illumination of a SWIR light source with the help of a SWIR camera (Fig. 4a2). The real hair that is composed of natural polymer fiber shows a lighter color when compared with the hairpiece made by artificial fiber. Fig. 4b1 and b2 present a kind of three-by-three grid passcode on mobile devices, in which the real security gesture is hidden in an ambient light environment (Fig. 4b1), while it can be clearly recognized through SWIR light (Fig. 4b2). This is because carbonaceous black ink has a good absorption capacity for SWIR light, while carbon-free black ink almost does not absorb the SWIR light. As a result, the carbon-free black lines can be penetrated by the SWIR light, enabling them to show the same grayscale color with the background, while carbonaceous black lines strongly absorb the SWIR light and do not generate any reflections, leading to a very low grayscale value. This unique feature can be used for information hiding and reading applications. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4c1, the printed English word “phosphors” covered by a car painted with oil paint can be clearly displayed when illuminated by the SWIR LED device (Fig. 4c2). This is because the wavelength of the SWIR light is longer than that of visible light, thereby the SWIR light has stronger penetrability than visible light. Additionally, SWIR has the advantage of passing through colored glasses, as shown in Fig. 4d1 and d2. Other application demonstrations of the fabricated SWIR LEDs are also given in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†). The findings in this work indicate that the as-synthesized KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ SWIR-emitting phosphor has promising applications for portable and high-performance SWIR light sources.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel SWIR-emitting phosphor has been developed via the introduction of Cr3+ in the KYbP2O7 host, which emits pure and efficient SWIR luminescence in the wavelength range of 900–1200 nm upon blue light excitation. The formation of Cr3+–Yb3+ redox ion pairs due to the electron transfer from Cr3+ to Yb3+ is responsible for the quenching of Cr3+ luminescence and intense SWIR luminescence of Yb3+ in the KYbP2O7:Cr3+ phosphor. This new compound shows a commendable photoluminescence quantum efficiency of 51.4% and good luminescence thermal stability (55.6%@120 °C). On this basis, a well-performed SWIR LED prototype device emitting over 900–1200 nm has been successfully constructed through a combination of the optimized KYbP2O7:0.01Cr3+ phosphor with a commercial blue LED chip, providing an optical power of 8.0 mW and an electricity-to-SWIR conversion efficiency of 1.7% at 150 mA input current. The practical applications of this LED device as a SWIR light source for non-destructive inspection and anticounterfeiting application are demonstrated in conjunction with a commercial SWIR camera. This work will motivate future research on the design and development of highly efficient and stable phosphor-converted SWIR light sources.
