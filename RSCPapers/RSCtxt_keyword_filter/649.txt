1. Introduction
In recent years, halide-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted significant attention as emerging semiconducting materials due to their remarkable optical and electrical properties.1–18 The first perovskite structure discovered by Lev Perovski in 1839 was calcium titanate (CaTiO3), a representative oxide-based perovskite compound.1,19 In the same atomic structure where halogen atoms alternated with the oxygen site, halide perovskites have been used for high-efficiency solar cell and light-emitting diode (LED) applications due to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as high absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility, high emission efficiency, tunable wavelength, and low defect densities.1–4,13–15,20–28 Moreover, the conventional three-dimensional (3D) structure of nanostructured perovskites (i.e., 0D quantum dots, 1D nanowires, and 2D nanosheets) have been explored to control their properties further, resulting in quantum confinement size effects.10,28–47 In addition to the outstanding properties, the halide perovskites have a great attention as a leading successor by alternating to a conventional Si or III–V compound semiconductor-based material platform due to their advantageous synthesis methods including solution processability at relatively low temperature, viability of largescale production, and low cost. Although these unique properties and privileges of material synthesis strategies exhibit significant potential for optoelectronic applications, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites still have several limitations that should be considered in practical applications, such as largescale approach, environmental stability, and soft lattice-induced ion migrations.1,3,7,38,39,48–57 In this perspective, we review the recent progress of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-based electronic and optoelectronic applications and discuss the existing challenges encountered in the use of perovskites for largescale applications with maximum reliable performances.
2. Structure–property relationship
3D perovskites have a general structure of ABX3, where A is a cation, B is a divalent metal ion, and X is a halogen anion. These compounds maintain electroneutrality by forming a 3D network with a series of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, with the A cations occupying the site in the middle of the cube surrounded by eight octahedra. Assuming that all the A, B, and X ions are rigid spheres and have a closed-packed configuration, the stability of the perovskite structure can be empirically predicted using the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t):  where RA, RB, and RX are the ionic radii for the cation, divalent metal ion, and halogen ion, respectively. In general, the tolerance factor is placed between 0.8 and 1.1 to form a stable 3D perovskite structure.1 At finite temperature, a cubic structure can be formed when the tolerance factor placed between 0.89 and 1, while the smaller factor results in tetragonal or orthorhombic structures and the large one may cause layered structure formation.58 Additionally, the octahedral factor (OF = RB/RX) can be used to estimate the structural stability of perovskites, when the OF value is between 0.44 and 0.9. The sizes of the representative A cations are 0.18 nm of CH3NH3+ and 0.23 nm of CH3CH2NH3+; B cations are 0.119 nm of lead and 0.110 nm of tin; X anions (i.e., halogens) are 0.220 nm of iodine, 0.196 nm of bromine, and 0.181 nm of chlorine.59
Following the structural stability factors, a series of halide perovskite compounds have been investigated for determining tunable properties. The A site is typically occupied by the organic molecules, i.e., methylammonium (MA+) or formamidinium (FA+), in hybrid perovskite structures. By alternating the organic molecules, inorganic C ion-based all-inorganic perovskite compounds are becoming popular in minimizing the limited environmental stability raised by the organic molecules. These A-site cations are placed in the middle of BX6 octahedra, where B is a divalent metal cation (e.g., Pb2+, Sn2+, Cu2+, Ge2+, or a rare earth element), and X is a halide anion (e.g., I−, Br−, or Cl−). This ABX3 structure forms a 3D framework, as shown in Fig. 1a. Here, the corresponding bandgap of 3D perovskites is tunable, depending on the elements at each site. For example, the bandgap decreases as the ionic radius of the A-site cation increases. The different bond angles between the B elements and the halides also influences the bandgap. Finally, the size of the X-site halogen atom can influence the bandgap due to a bathochromic shift.1
 Fig. 1  Structural schematics of 3D and 2D perovskites. In the 3D structure, BX6 octahedra from a corner-shared bulk structure with the A-site cations are placed in the middle, following the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. In the 2D structure, representative Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase structures with different thickness (n) are shown, in which 3D perovskite slabs are encapsulated with organic layers. 
Although 3D perovskite structures possess advantageous electrical and optical properties,1–17 the syntheses of nanostructured perovskites have been further explored to determine the quantum-confined size effect induced by emerging properties. For example, perovskite nanostructures exhibit several promising properties for high-performance optoelectronic applications, such as improved radiative recombination probability, large exciton binding energy, and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). Quasi-2D layered perovskites, also known as Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase, have been extensively investigated due to their emerging structure-induced properties.9,40–44 A series of 3D inorganic perovskite slabs sandwiched with insulating organic amine molecular layers form artificial 2D quantum wells with a chemical formula of A2′An−1BnX3n+1, where A′ is an organic amine molecule (Fig. 1). Here, the (An−1BnX3n+1)2− slabs act as quantum wells forming different bandgaps with respect to the layer number (n), and the organic (R-NH3)+ layers work as quantum barriers.9,41,44 This organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructure is a potential material structure for optoelectronic applications due to quantum confinement effects, such as anisotropic optical properties and strong exciton binding energy. For example, phenylethlammonium (PEA) lead iodide compounds exhibit a high exciton binding energy up to 400 meV at room temperature, resulting in highly improved light emission efficiency.1
The bandgap structure of the 3D MAPbI3 is expected to have a direct bandgap at the R point based on the density functional theory with PBE functional calculations, whereas the other conventional inorganic semiconductors possess a direct bandgap centered at the Γ point (Fig. 2a).60 The density of states (DOS) displayed in Fig. 2b shows the overall contributions of DOS and CH3NH3+, Pb, and I (from top to bottom), respectively. This calculation suggests that the valence band maxima (VBM) is dominated by the I 5p electrons with a minor contribution of the Pb 6s electrons, indicating covalent bonding. However, the conduction band minima (CBM) is controlled by the Pb 6p electrons with a slight contribution of the I 5p electrons, which shows ionic bonding. Hence, MAPbI3 possesses a covalent-ionic bonding structure. It should be noted that the DOS of the MA+ ion is placed far below the VBM, which means that the organic molecules balance the electrostatic charges without having a direct effect on the electronic properties.60

The optical properties of 3D perovskites, along with tunable bandgaps, are straightforward, based on the observed emission colors.17,61 Monodisperse halide perovskite nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized using a solution-phase synthesis method with various halide compositions, such as I−, Br−, to Cl−, and various tunable optical emission wavelengths have been obtained. Mixed halide perovskite nanocrystals with different anionic ratios (e.g., CsPb(Cl/Br)3 and CsPb(Br/I)3) have tunable bandgaps and thus, have different emission colors due to the beneficial ionic-bonding nature in these compounds.17 Optical emission spectra show significantly bright photoluminescence with PLQY of 50–90% and narrow emission linewidths between 12–42 nm. As shown in Fig. 2c, a trianion mixed perovskite CH3NH3PbClxBryI3−x−y exhibits a strong electroluminescence (EL) emission across the entire visible wavelength range with respect to their anion compositions.61
Additionally, the quantum-confined structure enables further bandgap tuning, depending on the layer number (n).41 As shown in Fig. 2d, an emission peak from 3D CsPbBr3 crystals placed at the green wavelength shifts to the higher energy as the thickness decreases (i.e., sky blue for n = 3, blue for n = 2, and violet for n = 1) due to higher quantum-confined exciton binding energy with less n. The tunable emitters in the blue-color range show potential in blue LED applications.41 Overall, halide perovskites can be used for high-performance (opto)electronic applications due to their solution-based simple synthesis methodologies and easily tunable semiconducting properties.
3. Semiconducting channel formation
The ionic bonding characteristics enable the formation of semiconducting channels through cost-effective, scalable, and simple solution-based approaches.7,14,15,18,22,42,62–64 Spin-casting is a widely used method for thin-film layer formations.7,14,15,18,22,42 A halide perovskite precursor solution is prepared using a controlled molar-ratio insoluble organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide (DMF). The precursor solution is then spin-coated on top of a target substrate by varying the conditions (e.g., rotation speed, time, temperature, and wettability). However, a spin-coated perovskite layer is required to improve the device performances further, which is directly caused by thin-film quality, uniformity, and crystallinity. An anti-solvent assisted thin-film15 can be applied to improve the layer quality. In the middle of the spin-coating duration time, the perovskite precursors are exposed to a few droplets of an anti-solvent, such as chlorobenzene. In comparison with controlled spin-coating without exposure, the anti-solvent droplet accelerates the rate of crystallization, resulting in a significantly improved perovskite thin-film quality.15 Another approach involves the use of a sequential deposition method.22 In this case, PbI2 is initially deposited to a substrate, followed by dipping in MAI to form a MAPbI3 layer. Light illumination during the MAI solution exposure enhances the perovskite thin-film quality further by decreasing the Gibbs free energy for the homogeneous nucleation processes.22 A modified vapor-assisted solution process can be another option for improving the thin-film quality – a dry nitrogen gas is blown over the PbI2 layer during the spin-coating process (Fig. 3a).65 Unlike the spin-coating process in which perovskite thin-films are formed everywhere, and semiconducting channels are required further well-defined spatial patterning for (opto)electronic applications. One spatially controlled approach by using an additional top glass substrate has been introduced for simple semiconductor channel formation.66 Two different substrates have a controlled distance separated by a fixed spacer, and a perovskite precursor solution is placed between the substrates through a capillary force. Consequently, perovskite thin-film morphologies, such as thickness, contact quality, and lateral growth, are controlled for transparent electronic applications (Fig. 3b).66 Another way of preparing the perovskite channel for electronic applications is a polymer-assisted dry transfer, which is a conventional approach for 2D material-based heterostructure formation.67–70 Here, CsPbX3 platelets are initially synthesized on a mica substrate through van der Waals epitaxial growth. A poly(vinyl alcohol) thin-film is placed on the platelets, followed by a mild heating process, to improve the adhesion with the perovskite platelets. Because the interaction between the platelet and the mica substrate is a weak van der Waals force, this approach can be used to transfer the perovskite platelets to any other arbitrary substrates with minimal damage (Fig. 3c).67 The spatial position of perovskite nanocrystals also can be mechanically manipulated through electrostatic forces (Fig. 3d and e).37–39,71 A single 1D perovskite nanocrystal is micromanipulated on a prepatterned electrode array, and the Pt contacts are deposited between the nanocrystal and the electrodes to improve the electrical contacts using an electron beam-induced metal deposition method. Concerning this 1D perovskite nanocrystal-based electronic devices, several interesting findings have been reported. For example, different phase segments have been synthesized through a temperature-gradient-induced partial phase transformation in a single 1D structure. In the case of CsPbI3 having two different crystalline structures (i.e., yellow and black phases), the yellow phase shows poor electrical properties with n-type semiconducting behaviors, whereas the p-type black phase has good electrical properties. When 1D perovskites with a yellow/black hetero-phase were formed, this segmented structure exhibits p–n diode-like rectifying electrical behaviors.37–39,71

Overall, the formation of a perovskite-based semiconducting channel is mainly focused on to improve the crystallinity and to form a spatially controllable region for lithography-free device-fabrication processes.
4. Electronic applications
Several approaches discussed above for the formation of perovskite-based semiconducting channels allow to explore unique electronic properties of halide perovskites. Electrical properties using field-effect transistor (FET) fabrications on a spin-coated (C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4 thin film have been reported. The perovskite-based FET exhibits semiconducting behaviors with a field-effect mobility of 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the current modulation exceeds 104 (Fig. 4a).18 Subsequently, several approaches have been used to improve the electronic properties through chemical composition modulations of organic spacer molecules.72–74 For example, a series of semiconducting m-fluro-phenethylammonium (mFPEA)-based SnI4 perovskites have been thoroughly evaluated through structural, optical, and electrical correlations (Fig. 4b).72 In a similar material system, i.e., (C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4, the interface between the perovskite and the electrodes has been optimized by utilizing a low work function Al and inserting C60 layers to minimize the electrode degradation. Consequently, a maximum electron mobility of up to 2.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained among the spin-coated perovskite-based FETs (Fig. 4c).75

Although perovskite has shown improved electronic properties, the ambient instability problem limits the use of the material in several practical applications that require long-term stability.76–85 A similar issue has been raised regarding 2D materials. For example, phosphorene, a few-layered structure of black phosphorus, or III–VI compound layered semiconductors (e.g., InSe and GaTe), possess good semiconducting electronic properties with layer-dependent tunable bandgaps. However, they are quickly oxidized under ambient conditions and, thus, lose their intrinsic electrical properties. Several passivation skims have been applied using sandwiched structures with 2D monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), PMMA, or alumina86–93 to minimize the chemical degradation under exposure to ambient conditions. Similarly, the ambient reactive MAPbI3 has been encapsulated in between a monolayer h-BN to suppress the ambient exposure and subsequent chemical degradation. This approach prolongs the device stability under the ambient conditions for several months without noticeable degradation (Fig. 4d and e).94 Another critical issue concerning the perovskite-based electronic applications is unusual ion-migration-induced electrical behaviors, such as hysteresis loops on I–V characteristics.48,53,95,96 Various attempts have been made to determine the origin of the behaviors, including the dielectric loss spectroscopic analysis as a function of temperature. Fig. 4f shows the results, indicating that ion migration occurs at approximately 240 K.
Owing to the poor thermal stability of the MAPbI3 material system, cesium (Cs)-based partially mixed and all-inorganic perovskite system have been reported.96 For example, a series of triple cation Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)1−xPb(Br0.17I0.83)3 based electronic device applications have been reported with a controlled Cs composition,98 and the optimized transistor had an electron/hole mobility of approximately 2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Although the spin-coated thin-film structure has been conventionally used as a semiconducting channel for FET fabrications, a wafer-scale growth of perovskite nanocrystal arrays has been reported as a potential approach.97 This process requires multiple steps to synthesize the (i) hydrophilic/hydrophobic patterning, (ii) PbI2 seeding, and (iii) transformation to perovskite structure. Fig. 4g and h shows the as-grown largescale perovskite array as a photographic and a dark-field optical microscopic image, respectively. After bridging the prepatterned electrode arrays (Fig. 4i), the spatially controlled growth of the perovskite crystals can be applied in a wafer-scale (opto)electronics, such as transistors and photodetectors, with high spatial uniformity.97
5. Optoelectronic applications
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have potential applications in optoelectronics as photo-active layers, such as solar cells and LEDs due to their unique optoelectronic properties including high absorption coefficient, process compatibility at low temperature, long exciton diffusion length (ca. 100 to 1000 nm), bright photoluminescence, narrow emission line width, balanced electron–hole mobility, and tunable exciton binding energy.1 These outstanding properties directly allow to achieve power conversion efficiency exceeding 23–24% in photovoltaics25,99 and external quantum efficiency of LED exceeding 20%.26 Because several review articles have been published on solar cells and LEDs in the optoelectronic applications,1,3,9,44 we only consider special optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting transistors (LETs), phototransistors, and perovskite-2D hybrid devices. By exploiting the excellent ambipolar characteristics of MAPbI3 at low temperatures, LET devices can be obtained through balanced carrier injections from both sides (Fig. 5a).100Fig. 5b shows an optical image of light emission while sweeping VDS from 0 to 100 V at constant VGS of 100 V due to not only the ambipolar nature of charge transport of MAPbI3, but also radiative recombination-induced bright EL within the transistor channel under balanced charge injection.100 Although the MAPbI3 semiconducting layer emits EL from external carrier injections, this layer also can be used for light absorbance to improve the transistor performance, also known as phototransistors. Fig. 5c is a schematic illustration of the phototransistor with a channel of the MAPbI3 perovskite.101 The transfer characteristics of the phototransistor under light illumination (blue and magenta symbols) show the highly improved semiconducting properties in comparison with that of the dark (black and red symbols), as shown in Fig. 5d. This solution-processed MAPbI3-based phototransistor exhibits ambipolar electrical properties due to the excellent optical and electronic properties. Additionally, this device possesses an excellent photoresponsivity of up to 320 A W−1 and an ultrafast response time.101

Another material structure has been utilized for phototransistor applications by coating the perovskites to 2D graphene to enhance both the optical and electronic properties. Graphene is a well-known 2D material in several electronic applications due to its ultrahigh carrier mobility. However, graphene has a relatively low light absorption due to the absence of a bandgap. Although the outstanding electrical properties of graphene are maintained, the optical properties can be achieved by forming a graphene-perovskite hybrid structure (Fig. 5e).102 This hybrid graphene-perovskite-based phototransistor has a high photoresponsivity (>105 A W−1) and high photoconductive gain (∼109). Fig. 5f shows the transfer curves of phototransistor devices developed with only graphene and a graphene-perovskite hybrid structure. As shown in the inset, a built-in electric field is formed due to the electron transfer from the perovskite to graphene, which causes band bending and effective photocarriers trapping.102
6. Mobile ions
Irrespective of the excellent electrical and optical properties as discussed above, the intrinsic nature of mobile ion migrations in perovskite structures requires an in-depth understanding of their behaviors.49–52,54–56,103–109 For example, iodine52,54,55,109–115 and methylammonium114–118 ions are easily movable via vacancy diffusion originating from the contribution of low defect formation energy (Fig. 6a). This ion migration generates various unusual phenomena, such as hysteresis loop during I–V measurements, slow photo-response time, and energy funneling. 1D and 2D nanostructured perovskites have been exploited as material structures for ion diffusion processes.39,110,119

For the 1D system, Cs-based all-inorganic perovskite crystals having an interface between two different halide metals were prepared to understand the inter-diffusion process of anions. CsPbBr3 nanowires were initially synthesized and partially converted to CsPbCl3 through an anion exchange chemistry (Fig. 6b).39 Under a constant temperature of 100 °C, the inter-diffusion of the anions was recorded through spatially resolved photoluminescence measurements. As shown in Fig. 6c, the interface between the Cl-rich region (blue-emitting) and the Br-rich region (green-emitting) moved in the direction of the Br-rich side. The time-dependent photoluminescence mapping demonstrates that the Cl does not migrate far into the Br end of the wire. Eventually, no interface was observed along the nanowire, and only one emission peak was shown.39
Similarly, ion migration has been studied in 2D nanoplatelet perovskites. As an initial material, CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets were hetero-epitaxially grown on a mica substrate using an atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor-transport method.119 The anion exchange status of an individual nanoplatelet was also visualized through confocal photoluminescence measurements. As the reaction time increased with n-C4H9NH3I, iodide ions were diffused into the nanoplatelet, and the emission color changed from green (CsPbBr3) to red (CsPbI3). The time-evolution photoluminescence images and spectra are shown in Fig. 6d.119 The quantitative imaging of the anion exchange kinetics provided an estimated value of the halide diffusion coefficient in the order of 10−14 cm2 s−1.
This ion migration nature of perovskite materials could be a reason responsible for the various irreproducible and unstable electronic and optical properties. The most representative phenomenon was an observable anomalous hysteresis loop during the J–V sweeps. Fig. 6e shows a J–V plot of a MAPbI3-based solar cell structure. Although the main reason has not yet been discovered fully, it is believed that the ion migration behavior and/or charge trapping contributes significantly to the hysteresis results.48
Finally, the origin of the ion migration and weak ionic bonding nature can also affect to the emission wavelengths of solution-processed perovskite-based LEDs.41,42 For example, RP phase quasi-2D perovskites, as shown in Fig. 1, are potential light-emitting materials because the quantum-confined structure yields distinct properties, such as high exciton binding energy and wavelength shift to higher energy. The RP crystals were dissolved in organic solvents and spin-coated conventionally to prepare an RP perovskite-based light-emitting layer. During the thin-film formation, the RP layer had spatially non-uniform compositions (i.e., the emitting layer was composed of n = 1, to 3D crystals), which can result in an emission peak shift to the lower energy due to the well-known energy-funneling effect. Although electron–hole pairs are intentionally recombined at the target bandgap of the starting RP composition, the electrons and holes move towards the narrower bandgap and recombine at the 3D region. For example, Br-based RP crystals have a bandgap with blue wavelength emission, but the final device emits a green light owing to the formation of a mobile ion-induced 3D structure (Fig. 6g).41
7. Conclusions and outlook
As we discussed in this review, several challenges are still being faced by perovskite-based applications in practice. The excellent optoelectronic properties of semiconducting hybrid perovskites allow for significant advances in the fields of solar cells and LEDs, as well as other electronic devices.
Large scale synthesis
The soft ionic bonding enables the spin coating as a conventional processing method for creating semiconducting channels. Although a thin-film semiconducting channel is formed, several techniques have been introduced to improve the thin-film crystallinity and roughness, such as light- or vapor-assisted solution processing. In addition to the spin coating, micromanipulation or direct transfer of as-synthesized crystals have been introduced. However, none of the above approaches is suitable for the industrial-level manufacturing process. Even though several methods, such as coating and printing methods, have been developed, significant improvements are still required not to lose the overall thin-film quality and morphology even in a large scale.
Materials stability
Regardless of the remarkable optical and electrical properties of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, the chemical instability, which occurs due to many factors, such as moisture, oxygen, temperature, and light exposure, limit their practical applications. Cs- or Rb-based all-inorganic halide perovskites have attracted much attention in overcoming the chemical reactivity problems. Even though all-inorganic perovskites show significant improvement in terms of chemical stability, this field still requires a significant breakthrough to be useful for commercial applications.
Hysteresis
One of the major challenges in using perovskites for (opto-)electronic applications is the inconsistent electrical behavior. The most representative explanation is the hysteresis loop (i.e., the J–V curves are not fully overlapped between forward and reverse sweep directions). Several factors have been discussed to discover the main reasons that cause this unusual phenomenon. The mobile ions of perovskites easily induce electric field distribution and cause band bending that can be determined through a Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurement. This KPFM measurement is used to evaluate the energy diagrams of the MAPbI3 films before and after electrical poling.120 The charge trapping and de-trapping processes can also influence the J–V hysteresis behavior, and the environmental instability of the MAPbI3 film can easily induce a defect formation due to thermal decomposition or light exposure.121,122 The charge trapping or the surface defects should be suppressed to minimize the hysteresis that can be improved by surface passivation by organic layers.123 In addition, other contributions such as slow transient capacitive current and ferroelectric polarization induced band bending have been discussed to analyze the unusual electrical behaviors thoroughly. However, none of the above can be used to explain the origin of the hysteresis fully, and thus, this field still requires further investigations to resolve the issue.
In summary, this perspective presents the recent trends in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-based electronics and optoelectronics for future applications. While the research field has been intensively investigated and advanced for some years, several areas still need to be addressed towards development in real-world applications. Therefore, additional research breakthroughs in both experimental advances and theoretical calculations are required to reduce the current technological challenges.
