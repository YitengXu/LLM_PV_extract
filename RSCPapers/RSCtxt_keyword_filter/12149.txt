    , Accepted 13th May 2013First published on 13th May 2013AbstractA thermally crosslinkable poly(cyclopentadithiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PCPDTBT) analogue copolymer with 2-ethylhexyl group and 5-hexenyl group on 4,4-positions of cyclopentadithiophene has been synthesised by palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction. Space-Charge Limited Current (SCLC) devices show hole mobility of up to 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In addition, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) were fabricated using fullerene derivatives as acceptor materials. The best performing device exhibited Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) at 2.0%, which could be improved to 3.7% after inclusion of dithiol additives. Most significantly, the lifetime of the OPV was enhanced by the crosslinking; when light soaked at 1 sun of irradiance, a half-life, t1/2 = 419 hours was measured, which is 51% improvement over an OPV using standard PCPDTBT. This higher stability is accounted for the crosslinkable structure of the polymer after annealing. The crosslinking reaction was confirmed by solubility tests, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and morphological analysis conducted by Atomic Force Microscopy and simultaneous synchrotron grazing-incidence small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering.
1 Introduction
Solution processible organic photovoltaics (OPV) are a promising source of renewable energy and the performances of such devices have rapidly escalated since the demonstration of the first BHJ based OPV,1,2 enabling a record efficiency of 8.3% to be recently demonstrated.3 Despite significant research progress in the Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of OPVs, stability of devices remains a critical issue for commercialisation of the technology and for long-term deployment and in applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics. Techniques to improve lifetime include substituting organic hole and electron-transporting layers to metal oxides,4,5 improved encapsulation6,7 and synthesising polymers with a HOMO energy level below the air oxidation threshold (approximately-5.27 eV).8 One alternative is to develop active materials that crosslink through either photo- or thermal-initiation; a number of attempts have supported this work for both donor and acceptors materials in the active layer, including the development of a photocrosslinkable derivative of the thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)-based polymer, which showed improved thermal stability.9,10 A similar approach was adopted by Cheng and Hsu et al. and have achieved improvements in PCE as well as lifetime of OPVs, when fabricating inverted device using crosslinkable fullerene derivatives, which contained styryl groups as thermal crosslinkers.11,12
One of well-investigated donor polymers used in OPV fabrication is poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl](PCPDTBT) (1).  
The material structure consists of alternating cyclopentadithiophene donor units with benzothiadiazole acceptor units, resulting in a low optical bandgap (1.4 eV) and high performance in OFETs (μH = 3.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the polymer with linear alkyl side groups instead of branched 2-ethylhexyl groups)13 and OPVs (PCE = 5.5%), when blended with fullerene derivatives.14,15 In this paper, we report the synthesis and solar cell performance of PCPDTBT with crosslinkable side chains. The purpose of this is to demonstrate a device with a high PCE, whilst improving stability. To achieve this, the 2-ethylhexyl groups were substituted with 5-hexenyl groups on the 4,4-position of cyclopentadithiophene; the crosslinking nature originates from the vinyl group of the 5-hexenyl groups. The polymer was used to fabricate Space-Charge Limited Current (SCLC) devices, in order to study the carrier mobility of the donor polymer before and after crosslinking. In addition, the polymer was used in the fabrication of OPV devices in conjunction with fullerene derivatives and the OPV performance including lifetime was studied. Devices were observed to exhibit significantly higher stability than that of the non-crosslinkable polymer, without detriment to the PCE. The crosslinking reaction of the polymers was confirmed using solubility tests and by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements. Morphological analysis was also conducted by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and simultaneous synchrotron grazing-incidence small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS/GIWAXS).
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis

Scheme 1 shows the monomer synthesis, in which the crosslinkable side chain, 5-hexenyl group or 2-ethylhexyl branched chain were introduced onto the 4-position of cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) through the addition of an equivalent of n-butyllithium followed by 6-bromo-1-hexene or 2-ethylhexylbromide. These alkylated CPDTs were then brominated by the addition of N-bromosuccinimide to give dibromo-CPDT with 2-ethylhexyl group (compound 2) and dibromo-CPDT with 5-hexenyl group (compound 3). As shown in Scheme 2, the crosslinkable random copolymers (4 and 5) were synthesised by palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction; polymers were synthesised with varying equivalent ratios of 2 and 3. These ratios were varied between 2:3 = 95:5 for polymer 4 and 2:3 = 50:50 for polymer 5. Polymers with a higher composition ratio of 5-hexenyl group were synthesised for clarification of chemical structures before and after crosslinking reaction, because the polymer with fewer vinyl groups showed insignificant change on the vinyl group in 1H NMR and FT-IR measurements. Subsequent addition of excess bromobenzene or 4-bromoanisole to the reaction mixture provided phenyl- or anisole-capped polymers 6 and 7via Heck coupling reaction on vinyl groups of CPDT. This allowed for a reduction in the crosslinking temperature to 160 °C.

The polymers were purified by Soxleht extraction and washed with ethanol, methylethylketone, extracted with chloroform, then filtered through silica gel column chromatography. Polymers with a higher proportion of 2-ethylhexyl side-groups (4 and 6) were obtained in good yield (73% and 90%, respectively) with number average molecular weight of Mn = 21200 and polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.4 for 4 and Mn = 21700 with PDI = 3.7 for 6, respectively, determined by GPC measurement. In contrast, polymers with a lower proportion of 2-ethylhexyl groups (5 and 7) were obtained in low yield of 27% and 51%, respectively, after the Soxhlet extraction. This can be explained by the lower solubility of polymers, influenced by the reduction of solubilising side groups. Fig. 1 (top) shows 1H NMR spectrum of 4 in deuterated chloroform solution. Peaks at 8.12 and 7.85 ppm are assigned to hydrogen atoms on CPDT and benzothiadiazole and small peaks at 5.71 and 4.94 ppm shown in an expansion are assigned to vinyl –CHCH2 of 5-hexenyl group. Other peaks around 2.1–0.6 ppm are assigned to aliphatic protons. The peak integration suggests that 4 contains 5% of the vinyl group which is consistent with initial monomer ratio. To confirm these small peaks of the vinyl group, 1H NMR spectrum of 5 (50% vinyl group) was measured, in which peaks originated from vinyl –CHCH2 group were clearly shown at 5.82 and 4.94 ppm and the vinyl contents were estimated to be 50% from the peak integration, as shown in Fig. 1 (middle). These vinyl groups in 4 and 5 reacted with the subsequently added bromobenzene or 4-bromoanisole after the polymerisation via Heck reaction in the presence of palladium catalyst. Fig. 1 (bottom) shows 1H NMR spectrum of 7, in which peaks at 7.13, 6.76, 6.64 and 3.67 ppm are assigned to two aromatic protons, a vinyl proton and methoxy protons, respectively. To confirm the possibility of the Heck reaction, a model reaction was carried out between 1-octene and 4-bromoanisole under similar condition (Scheme SI-1 in the ESI†). After purifying the reaction mixture by size-exclusion liquid chromatography (SEC), the resulting product(s) was anticipated to be two anisole additives of 1-octene, which were analysed by 1H NMR and mass spectra (Fig. SI-6 and SI-7†). According to 1H NMR spectrum of 7 (Fig. 1 bottom), 70% of vinyl groups were capped by the anisole groups, whereas all vinyl groups were converted to phenyl groups in 6 (Fig. SI-5†).

As a comparison, a non-crosslinkable PCPDTBT (1) having only 2-ethylhexyl side chain was also synthesised. Details of the polymer synthesis and performance are reported elsewhere.15 This allowed us to directly compare the effect of crosslinking in PCPDTBT device performance.
2.2 FTIR and optical absorption spectra
To test the crosslinking properties, FTIR measurements were undertaken to evaluate the properties of the synthesised polymers after crosslinking. Polymer films were prepared in glass vial and solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. Two samples were prepared and annealed at temperatures above and below the crosslinking temperatures. Fig. 2 shows FTIR spectra of 5, which indicates absorption peaks at 993 and 910 cm−1 corresponding to out of plane bendings of vinyl group (–CC–H). After annealing at 260 °C, both peaks were reduced by 32%, which demonstrates the crosslinking reaction between adjacent vinyl side groups on the polymer chains.16 FTIR measurements were conducted for the remaining polymers and are shown in ESI-8.† Small changes in FTIR spectra before and after annealing were observed in 4 and 6 because of lower composition of crosslinking side groups, but polymer 7, which contained a large content of crosslinking units showed some evidence of crosslinking in agreement with the results for 5.
 Fig. 2  (a) Photographic images of films of 7 before (left) and after (right) annealing at 160 °C and (b) absorption spectra of 6 and 7 before and after rinsing with chloroform. 
To further demonstrate the crosslinking properties, polymers 4–7 were dissolved into solvent and heated until the polymer became insoluble. Polymer 4, 5 and 7 became insoluble after annealing at 260 °C for 1 hour, suggesting the occurrence of a crosslinking reaction. However, polymer 6 became insoluble at 160 °C, which is a temperature more suited to OPV fabrication. In Fig. 3a the solubility of the polymer 7 before and after crosslinking polymer is shown and it can be seen the polymer is highly soluble in chlorobenzene before spin coating (left hand vial) and insoluble after annealing (right hand vial). The insolubility of polymers 4–6 after crosslinking is shown in ESI-9.† Due to the lower crosslinking temperature, the authors have focused on polymer 6 only. The reason for this reduction in crosslinking temperature is that polymer 6 has styryl structure given by Heck reaction (see Scheme 2). Generally, styryl groups are more reactive than allyl group and therefore, the annealing temperature is lowered.11,12 The anisole group on polymer 7 is rather more bulky than on 6, which might be the reason for the higher crosslinking temperature for polymer 7.

To further demonstrate the crosslinking nature of the polymers, thin films of 1, 6 and 7 were prepared by spin coating onto glass substrates and crosslinked at their respective temperatures (160 °C for 6 and 260 °C for 7). These polymers were selected as 1 is a control, 6 in a polymer suited to OPV fabrication and 7 has a close chemical structure to 6, but a higher crosslinking active site concentration. 1 mL of chloroform was placed on the polymer side of the glass slide for 30 seconds and dried by a high speed spinning (1000 rpm) on the coater. PCPDTBT has approximately the same solubility in chloroform as chlorobenzene, which is later used for OPV fabrication. Thin film absorption measurements were taken before and after rinsing with chloroform and the results are shown in Fig. 3(b). Absorption spectrum for non-crosslinkable PCPDTBT (1) is not shown because it dissolves almost immediately in chloroform and leaves almost zero traces of the original polymer film. It is clear that the optical properties of the thin films of 6 and 7 do alter, but a large quantity of polymer remains on the glass surface. Polymer 6 maintains some solubility after crosslinking due to the lower content of 5-hexenyl groups, hence the large changed in absorption properties. Conversely, polymer 7 is only slightly affected by the solvent rinsing tests due to the higher content of 5-hexenyl groups, providing further evidence of it crosslinking nature.
2.3 Electrical and optical analysis

2.3.1 Charge transport properties. 
Due to the high crosslinking temperatures of 4, 5 and 7, device characterisation focused on polymer 6 only. The higher crosslinking temperatures poses difficulties in device analysis due to the higher crosslinking temperature; the hole transport layer used in these devices (PEDOT:PSS) is known to have a degradation temperature ∼240 °C. Additionally, when preparing OPVs at 260 °C, large aggregates of PCBM are formed, which causes a reduction in the photocurrent (see ESI-10†).
Electro-optical characterisation of the synthesised materials was undertaken with a combination of Space-Charge Limited Current (SCLC) and OPV devices. SCLC current–voltage characteristics with the structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly-(styrene sulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/PCPDTBT (100 nm)/Au, were made and a fit to the data was obtained using the Mott–Gurney law, enabling the hole mobility to be extracted.
Data for the dependence of hole mobility on annealing temperature is shown in Fig. 4, with the results summarised in Table 1. As described in ref. 15 and 17, SCLC devices are preferred over OFETs for evaluating mobility of semiconductors for solar cells as these materials require electronic transport in the direction perpendicular to the substrate, rather than parallel. The non-crosslinkable PCPDTBT (1) demonstrated a maximum mobility, μh = 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, but decreased to 6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at temperatures greater than 120 °C. This is consistent with previous experiments, which have shown the hole mobility declines with higher temperature annealing.15

The hole mobility of crosslinkable polymer 6 is measured at 4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at low temperatures, however, this is significantly improved to be 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at temperatures greater than the crosslinking temperature of 160 °C. For this polymer, it is clear that the allyl group reduces the mobility prior to crosslinking presumably reducing the intermolecular packing between adjacent polymer chains and making efficient charge carrier transfer less favourable. However, crosslinking reduces this packing dimension, improving this charge transfer properties and, thus, the hole mobility. This view is supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) data and GISAXS data.


2.3.2 OPV characteristics. 
OPVs were fabricated on glass substrates with patterned a indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS anode, using 0.2 cm2 device areas. The active layers were all spin casted from chlorobenzene solutions of the polymer 6 and PCBM with and without 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) additives; the full procedure is outlined in Section 4.
In Fig. 5, the best performing current density–voltage curves (under AM1.5G illumination) of 6 with and without ODT are shown and the data for all experiments is summarised within Table 2. The data in Table 2 also includes data for the non-crosslinked polymer 1, fabricated and tested under the same conditions. For all blends, the optimum polymer:fullerene blend ratio was the same as previously reported14,15 for both material with and without ODT, but differences in optimal film thickness and annealing temperatures were discovered.

For devices fabricated from polymer 6 without ODT, the best performing devices a similar PCE to the corresponding PCPDTBT (1) device, despite a lower short-circuit current densities (JSC) (a 6% reduction is observed). The increase in PCE is primarily due to the increase in open circuit voltage (VOC) (a 6% increase) and also a minor increase in Fill Factor (FF). The lower JSC correlates well to the absorption experiments (Fig. SI-11 in the ESI†), which indicated the polymer has a much lower absorption for equal film thicknesses. In fact, the measured JSC is remarkably higher given the substantially lower absorption of 6, when compared to 1. This lower absorption property originates through the additional length side chains in polymer 6. The absorption spectrum of 6 indicates that the π–π* transition is only weakly affected by the presence and positioning of the side-chains (the high energy peak does not shift), but the low-energy absorption peak does see a significantly change in relative intensity. This is assumed to be as a result of a reduced intra chain charge-transfer (CT) character from the electron-donating CPDT to the electron-accepting BT group. For devices fabricated with ODT, 6 showed a minor decrease in PCE (a 6% reduction is observed). OPV's fabricated with the crosslinked polymer also exhibited slightly lower JSC. However, this drop in JSC performance was partially offset by the increase in FF and VOC.
For devices fabricated with and without ODT, the increase in VOC with crosslinkable polymers is an interesting observation. The higher VOC of the crosslinked devices (∼50 mV increase), can be expected when considering the lower HOMO level of 6; (HOMO [polymer 6] = −4.93 eV, HOMO [polymer 1] = −5.00 eV, from cyclic voltammograms of polymer films).
For OPV devices using polymer 1, it was observed that annealing the active layer worsened OPV performance consistent with other ref. 15, predominantly as a result of decreases in FF and JSC. The likely reason for this deterioration relates to a worse morphology for efficient charge separation and transfer and that a slow drying process improves the morphology during phase separation. This is different to the trend observed with OPVs fabricated with 6, where consistent device performance is observed up to annealing temperatures of 160 °C. The minor improvement in FF is likely to be as a result of the increased hole mobility of 6 after annealing. The increase in hole mobility enables the series resistance, RS to decrease, which contributes to improved charge transport properties.
Lifetime tests were carried out on OPVs fabricated with polymer 6 and 1 by blending with PC71BM and ODT additives. Devices were encapsulated for these tests and illuminated a 1 sun of irradiation using a light soaker. Fig. 6 shows the changes in VOC, FF, JSC and PCE over a 500 hours period. It is evident from the data that the solar cells fabricated with the crosslinkable polymer 6 exhibited significantly improved device performance, a half-life, t1/2 = 450 hours was measured, which is 45% longer than that of non-crosslinked PCPDTBT. The main difference between the crosslinked and non-crosslinked OPV devices is experienced in the initial 100 hours of testing; the OPVs with crosslinked polymer appears to remain stable over this period as a small increase in performance is observed in the first 50 hours. The non-crosslinked drops off rapidly in the first 100 hours, but thereafter only experiences a slightly worse degradation rate over the remaining 400 hours of testing.

2.4 Morphological characterisation
Both the SCLC device data and OPV lifetime data clearly indicate improved thermal stability of the crosslinkable polymer, 6. In order to understand the changes in hole mobility during crosslinking, AFM topographic scans of the polymer morphology at different annealing temperatures was undertaken and are shown in Fig. 7a–d; the micrographs showed that annealing of polymer 6 film did not show a drastic effect upon the surface roughness from (RA = 0.563 nm, RZ = 5.99 nm at 60 °C) to (RA = 0.606 nm, RZ = 6.89 nm at 170 °C). This compared to polymer 1 (micrographs not shown), where a large increase in surface roughness is observed from (RA = 1.17 nm, RZ = 10.5 nm) to (RA = 1.99 nm, RZ = 17.31 nm). The increase in surface roughness indicates large changes to the polymer morphology of the non-crosslinkable PCPDTBT after annealing, presumably indicating less thermal stability. AFM data is also shown for devices with polymer 6 blended with PCBM with 1:3 ratio in Fig. 7(c) and (d). After crosslinking at 170 °C, PCBM aggregation is not observed.

To understand the nature of the molecular stacking in crosslinkable polymer with PCBM, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were undertaken (see Fig. 8) for 6. XRD data for the polymer 6 shows a slightly difference molecular structure when compared to that of PCPDTBT reported elsewhere.18
 Fig. 8  XRD pattern of a 100 nm thick thin film of 6 made with (a) before and (b) after annealing at 170 °C. 
Prior to crosslinking, the lamella packing of 6 shows a broad feature with a peak at θ = 5.12° (8.63 Å), corresponding to the branched side chains from the polymer. Despite the side chains of this analogue polymer being longer, the spacing between polymer chains is actually less than non-crosslinked 60 PCPDTBT (1) (θ = 4.77°, d-spacing = 9.27 Å). This spacing appears to increase after crosslinking. A second broad peak is also observed at θ = 11.7° (3.80 Å), due to the π-orbital stacking between polymer chains. Again, this spacing appears to increase after crosslinking. However, for both dimensions, a much stronger peak is observed in the XRD curve after crosslinking, suggesting that the crosslinking action increases the order in the polymer film. This gives some insight into the increased hole mobility of polymer 6 after crosslinking, as discussed in Section 2.3.1.
For further understanding of the structural development of the crosslinkable polymers and the crosslinking effect on PCBM aggregation, we investigated in situ crosslinking of polymers 6 and 7 (of either 5% or 50% monomers grafted with crosslinking group), with and without PCBM, using in situ grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). Shown in Fig. 9 are the 2D GISAXS patterns collected for the samples over ∼1 h isothermal annealing at 160 °C (for 6) and 260 °C (for 7) above the crosslinking temperature. In-plane GISAXS profiles (Fig. 10) were retrieved from the specular beam position (cf.Fig. 9) as a function of the in-plane scattering wavevector qxy. The GISAXS profile in Fig. 10a for the thin film of 6 with less crosslinking density (5%) shows successively increased intensity in the q-region of 0.004–0.02 Å−1 presumably owing to the formation of additionally large domains upon crosslinking. Correspondingly, GISAXS profile shown in Fig. 10b for the annealed thin film of polymer 6 revealed gradually enhanced scattering intensity in the higher q-region above 0.02 Å−1, due to the characteristic PC61BM aggregation19,20 of 10–20 nm size. In contrast, the GISAXS profiles observed for the film of 7 (50% crosslinkable side chains) with (Fig. 10c) or without PC61BM (Fig. 10d), reflect essentially no growth in the overall q-region observed. Likely, the very high crosslinking density restricted formation of additional polymer domains and suppressed completely PCBM aggregation.

3 Summary
In this paper, the synthesis of crosslinkable PCPDTBT based on cyclopentadithiophene with 5-hexenyl group and benzothiadiazole units is reported. The polymer was used to fabricate SCLC devices and the device exhibited improvements in hole mobility from 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after crosslinking. Optimised OPVs were fabricated and tested under AM1.5G conditions after optimisation of the fabrication conditions. The best performing device shows a power conversion efficiency of 3.65%. Mostly importantly, the lifetime of the OPV device fabricated from crosslinkable PCPDTBT is significantly longer than that from PCDPTBT.
4 Experimental
4.1 General methods
All synthesis experiments were performed under an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Polymer molecular weight was determined by GPC in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution using a JASCO 880-PU and a JASCO 870-UV detector (referenced to polystyrene standards). 1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

4.5 Fabrication of Space-Charge Limited Current (SCLC) devices
ITO coated fused silica substrates were cleaned sequentially with acetone and isopropanol using an ultrasonic bath, and dried under nitrogen atmosphere. The cleaned substrates were then spin-coated at 5000 rpm with poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid, PEDOT:PSS (Ossila), from an aqueous solution and annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes. Polymers were dissolved into anhydrous chlorobenzene at 20 mg mL−1 and was used to coat a 100 nm thick polymer layer. Finally, an 80 nm thick gold electrode was added by thermal evaporation. Annealing was performed prior to contact evaporation in a nitrogen glovebox. Measurements were taken using a calibrated Source Measurement Unit (SMU).
4.6 Fabrication of OPVs
ITO substrates were prepared as in Section 4.6, with a PEDOT:PSS layer, prior to coating the active layer. Prior to coating, the polymer:fullerene blends were allowed to dissolve for 48 hours on a hot plate stirrer and filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The chlorobenzene solutions containing polymer and PCBM with various blend composition were spun-cast using different spinning rate on to these PEDOT:PSS coated substrates. The cathode electrodes consisted of 10 nm calcium followed by 80 nm aluminium. J–V characteristics of these PV devices were measured under white light illumination (AM1.5) using a Oriel Newport AM1.5G solar simulator output intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Illumination for light soaking measurements was provided from a halogen light soaker supplied by GB-Sol ltd, Wales, UK and devices were biased at the Maximum Power Point (MPP) in between measurements.
4.7 GISAXS measurement

GISAXS measurements were conducted at the 23A SWAXS end station of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan. Details of the instrument were reported previously.21 Sample thin films were respectively placed horizontally on a hot stage for 260 °C isothermal annealing. With a 15 keV (wavelength λ = 0.827 Å) beam and an incident angle 0.2°, time-resolved GISAXS patterns were collected using a Pilatus 1M-F area detector situated 5015 mm from the sample position. The scattering wavevector, defined as q = 4πλ−1sin θ (with 2θ the scattering angle), was calibrated using silver behenate.
