    , Accepted 8th April 2012First published on 16th May 2012AbstractFour new donor–acceptor semiconducting alternating copolymers consisting of thienopyrroledione (TPD) electron-accepting sub-units and either 2,7-carbazole or dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene electron-donating moieties were prepared either by Suzuki or Stille coupling. Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to fractionate the copolymer with 1:1 thienopyrroledione to carbazole ratio into 9 sharp fractions. The effective conjugation length (35 aromatic rings) was determined on the basis of the dependence of λmax of the π–π* band on the degree of polymerization, DPn. All four polymers showed similar supramolecular organization resembling that of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s since the mechanism of the self-assembly was the same in both cases: π-stacking of the π-conjugated polymer backbones and interdigitation of n-alkyl side chains. As shown by cyclic voltammetry studies, three copolymers showed band gaps inferior to 2 eV with HOMO and LUMO levels ranging between −5.62 eV to −5.08 eV and −3.53 eV to −3.13 eV, respectively. UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical investigations confirmed the results obtained by cyclic voltammetry, enabling in addition more precise determination of the HOMO level. Raman spectroelectrochemical studies showed that the polymer with 1:1 thienopyrroledione to carbazole ratio is prone to oxidative degradation, consistent with cyclic voltammetry studies. A bulk-heterojunction solar cell was fabricated from the copolymer consisting of thienopyrroledione and dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene. A power conversion efficiency of 1.63% was achieved for non-optimized devices.
Introduction
π-conjugated polymers have attracted significant research interest during the past three decades, mainly because of their peculiar electronic, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties, frequently unmatched by other types of inorganic and organic materials.1 In their semiconducting (undoped) form these macromolecular compounds can be used as active layers in organic electronic devices such as field-effect transistors,2,3 photovoltaic cells, photodiodes4–6 and biosensors.7,8
All these applications require strict control of the polymer redox properties (more precisely, the positions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels) which must be adapted to a given application. This makes the synthesis of new electroactive polymers a challenging task. Tuning of the bandgap of conjugated polymers can be easily achieved using the push–pull strategy where two monomers (one electron donating (push) and one electron accepting (pull)) are linked together to form one polymer chain, usually with the use of an appropriate C–C coupling reaction.3 Using this push–pull approach, we have synthesized a series of new π-conjugated copolymers based on carbazole or dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione derivatives. We have also investigated the effect of the push segment chemical nature on the optical gap and redox properties of these new polymeric semiconductors in view of their potential application as components in photovoltaic cells or photodiodes.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Homopolymers based on 9-alkyl-2,7-carbazole units are popular hole transporting organic semiconductors since they combine good electrical properties with solution processability.9 They can also be used as building blocks in push–pull copolymers.10 Dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene units play a similar role, although their electron-donating properties are stronger.11 On the other hand, terthiophenes or quaterthiophene functionalized with electron-accepting groups have also been used as pull blocks in low-band gap alternating copolymers.12 In the course of the described research we have synthesized four polymers whose repeat units are shown in Chart 1.

Push–pull structure of copolymers P1–P4. 
Two types of pull building blocks (A segments) were used, namely 1,3-bis(5-bromo-3-dodecyl-2-thienyl)-5-methyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione, 5, and 3,3′-bis(5-bromo-3-dodecyl-2-thienyl)-5,5′-dimethyl-4H,4′H-1,1′-bithieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,4′,6,6′(5H,5′H)-tetraone, 13 (see Schemes 1 and 2).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the A segment in P1 and P3. 
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of the A segment in P2 and P4. 
Compound 5 is synthesized in four steps. In the first step, commercially available thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic acid is transformed into 1.13 Subsequently compound 1 is brominated at 2 and 5 positions to give 2. Compound 2 is then reacted with the stannyl derivative of 3-n-dodecylthiophene (compound 3) to yield 4. Bromination of 4 at α-carbons leads to the targeted compound 5 (see Scheme 1) which can be considered as a precursor of the pull segment in P1 and P3.
The reaction pathway leading to the second building block of A type is presented in Scheme 2.
Compound 6i.e. a thiophene derivative containing an amine group at the 2-position and two ester functions at the 3- and 4-positions is obtained from two commercial products – methyloxopropanoate and ethyl cyanoacetate, respectively, through a Gewald-type reaction (Scheme 2). The substitution of the amine group in 6 with I, to give 7, is carried out by a Sandmeyer-type reaction. Subsequently, 8 is obtained from 7via hydrolysis of the two ester group functions. Next, the pyrroledione ring is closed to yield the key intermediate 9. In the subsequent step, the thienopyrroledione dimer, 10, is obtained via an Ullmann reaction. Next, 10 is brominated at α-carbons to give 11, which is then reacted with the stannyl derivative of 3-n-dodecylthiophene, compound 3, to yield 12. The final product, i.e. the second pull building block, compound 13, is prepared by the bromination of the α-carbons. This building block is then used for the preparation of copolymers P2 and P4.
2,6-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene has been prepared according to the literature.11

P1, P2, P3 and P4 were obtained using either Suzuki or Stille cross-coupling polymerization (see Scheme 3).

The crude polymers, obtained by precipitation in methanol, usually contain small amounts of oligomeric fractions which can be removed by extraction with acetone in a Soxhlet apparatus. After their removal, the copolymers still exhibit a rather large polydispersity index values (PDI = Mw/Mn). Fractionation is an established method used to reduce, by sequential extraction with an experimentally established set of solvents, the PDI of conjugated polymers.14,15 For P1 and P3 two fractions were obtained while P2 and P4 could not be fractionated in this manner being totally soluble in hexane. Macromolecular parameters of all four copolymers studied are collected in Table 1.

Depth studies of chloroform fraction of P1 can be found in the ESI (see Fig. S1 and S2†). Using analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC), we have succeeded to fractionate it into nine sharp fractions showing PDI values ranging from 1.10 down to 1.05 (Table 2). Solution UV-vis spectra of these fractions show an interesting behaviour. For the low molecular fractions (from F9 to F5), λmax of the π–π* transition band is being gradually bathochromically shifted from 436 nm to 444 nm. For F4 and fractions of higher mass (F3–F1), its position saturates. This saturation can be taken as an indirect measure of the effective conjugation length in P1. The apparent degree of polymerization (DPn*) in F4 is 18 which corresponds to ca. 90 aromatic rings in the polymer backbone. It must be however noted that the use of polystyrene standards leads to an overestimation of the mass of π-conjugated polymers as it is known, for example, from the comparison of the MALDI-TOF and SEC results obtained for regioregular head-to-tail, head-to-tail coupled (HT–HT) poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl).14 It is therefore highly probable that the SEC determined DPn values for P1 and its fractions are overestimated. Although the reported degrees of polymerization are apparent, the fractionation of the polymer into fractions of very low PDI values enabled us to precisely determine the saturation of the conjugation length. If fractions of higher polymolecularity index values are used, for example as in the case of already mentioned regioregular HT–HT poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), no saturation of the λmax position of the π–π* band is observed even for samples of very high Mn values. This is due to the presence of low molecular mass fractions in these samples, whose contribution diminishes with increasing molecular mass but never becomes negligible.16 The detailed description of the SEC fractionation and the analysis of all fractions can be found in the ESI†.

Supramolecular organization
Taking into account the complexity of their repeating unit and a large variety of lateral substituents of different type P2, P3, and P4 show a remarkably ordered structural organization of a similar type. X-ray diffractograms recorded for all four copolymers studied are displayed in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  X-ray diffraction profiles of P1–P4. The inset shows the maxima of the lowest angle Bragg reflection. 
The obtained X-ray patterns strikingly resemble typical diffractograms of poly(alkylthiophene)s with long n-alkyl substituents.3 For example the diffractogram of P2 is characterized by a sharp reflection at lower angles (2θ = 4.40°, corresponding to a distance d = 20.06 Å). A second less intensive reflection can be noticed at 2θ = 24.90° (d = 3.46 Å), which is superimposed on a broader halo, peaking at 2θ = 19.95° (d = 4.46 Å). The first reflection is attributed to a distance between the π-stacks of polymer chains separated by lateral groups (see scheme presented in Fig. 2). This distance is imposed by the longest lateral substituent and for this reason is very similar for all polymers studied since all of them are functionalized with the same n-dodecyl side chains (see the inset of Fig. 1). It is also shorter than twice the length of the n-dodecyl group. This implies that the lateral alkyl groups are interdigitated.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the supramolecular organization of all four copolymers P1–P4. 
The second reflection (d = 3.46 Å) corresponds to the interchain distance in the chains π-stacking direction (see Fig. 2). The fact that this diffraction peak clearly appears in the diffractogram proves that ordered π-stacks are formed in P2, despite certain heterogeneity of its π-conjugated backbone. Finally, the broader halo, whose maximum corresponds to d = 4.45 Å, originates from the alkyl interchain correlation distance.

P3 and P4 exhibit a similar structural organization to P2. This strongly indicates that in all three copolymers, the supramolecular structure is governed by two principal effects: π-stacking of the π-conjugated chains and interdigitation of the lateral alkyl groups. P1 is obviously less ordered as its reflection at lower angles arising from the distance between π-stacks is much less pronounced and no peak corresponding to the interchain distance in the π-stacking direction is present in its diffractogram.
UV-vis spectroscopy
UV-vis absorption spectra of all polymers studied are dominated by a strong band in the visible part of the spectrum, ascribed to the π–π* transition in the π-conjugated polymer backbone (see Fig. 3). For polymers of a given pull unit the position of the π–π* band is strongly influenced by the electron-donating properties of the push segment. Therefore, both λmax and the peak onset (λonset) in P3 are bathochromatically shifted by ca. 88 nm and 101 nm, respectively, as compared to the case of P1, because dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene is a stronger electron donor than carbazole. Similar effect, resulting in a bathochromic shift of the π–π* band and gap narrowing, is also observed for an increased pull to push ratio. This is clearly evidenced by comparing the spectra of P1 and P2, in which the ratio of thienopyrroledione groups to carbazole ones is 1:1 and 2:1, respectively (Table 3). For stronger electron donors like dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene, this effect is much weaker as it is clear from the data collected in Table 3 where the values of the optical gaps are added (compare couples P1vs.P2 and P3vs.P4). Contrary to expectations, the band gap of P4 is slightly wider than that of P3. We tend to rationalize this fact by a three-fold difference in Mn of both polymers.

Cyclic voltammetry
All-synthesized polymers are electrochemically active. Fig. 4 shows representative voltammograms, registered for thin layers of P1 and P3i.e. two polymers in which the A-segment is the same and the push segments differ. Let us first discuss the oxidative mode (Fig. 4a and c). Electrochemical oxidation of π-conjugated polymers usually gives rise to two redox processes. The first process of more or less reversible nature is associated with oxidative doping of the polymer (i.e. transformation of neutral polymer chains into polycations). In the cyclic voltammetry scans this doping process is manifested by the presence of an anodic peak which has its cathodic counterpart, originating from the undoping process i.e. the reduction of the polycations formed during the doping to neutral macromolecules. If the vertex potential is extended to higher values, a second anodic peak appears which has no cathodic counterpart. Cycling to potentials of this second oxidation peak renders the polymer electrochemically inactive. This is a clear manifestation of the so-called “overoxidation” of π-conjugated polymers.17 In the case of P1 and P3 the anodic peak, ascribed to the oxidative doping, overlaps with the onset of the “overoxidation” peak. As a consequence, the oxidative doping is of limited reversibility.

Reduction of neutral macromolecules of P1 to polyanions is totally irreversible. P3 is the only polymer which shows quasi-reversibility of the electrochemical reduction (see Fig. 4b and d).
In push–pull type π-conjugated alternating copolymers the presence of the electron-accepting groups lowers both the LUMO and the HOMO levels whereas the electron-donating groups have the opposite effect. A relatively high potential of the onset and the maximum of the oxidative doping peak in P1 clearly manifest the dominant effect of the electron-accepting properties of pyrroledione. In P3, the onset of the oxidative doping peak is shifted to lower potentials by 250 mV, as a result of stronger electron-donating properties of the dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene D units, as compared to the carbazole ones, since they better compensate the electron withdrawing effect of thienopyrroledione. The effect of the A to D ratio is also clearly evidenced by comparing the electrochemical properties of P1 and P2. Its two-fold increase in P2 results in a shift of both Eox and Ered to higher values, however for Ered the effect is more pronounced. This leads to a smaller difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels and a narrower gap (Table 4).
For the calculations of the electrochemical HOMO and LUMO levels the potentials of oxidation and reduction of the polymer must be expressed on the absolute potential scale (i.e. with respect to the vacuum level). Since the potential of the ferrocene couple with respect to the vacuum level is −4.8 V (ref. 18), the following formula can be used for this purpose:ELUMO = −e(Ered onset + 4.8) eV EHOMO = −e(Eox onset + 4.8) eV (ref. 19)
The redox potential values can be obtained with exactness when the voltammetric waves are reversible. Since in the studied polymers the redox processes were irreversible or partially reversible, the presented values of the HOMO and LUMO levels, determined on the basis of the redox process onset, can be treated only as the first estimation. However, a good agreement between the optically and electrochemically determined band gaps should be pointed out (Table 4).

UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry
The determination of the electrochemical oxidative (reductive) doping onset from the electrochemical studies may be somehow arbitrary due to a broad nature of the CV peaks and their rather complex shape. In addition temporal effects can occur upon variation of the scan rate. Spectroelectrochemistry can be of help here since the UV-vis-NIR spectra of the polymer thin layers are extremely sensitive to doping and undoping processes. In an experiment devoted to the HOMO (LUMO) level determination, the UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical measurements should be carried out in a quasi-static mode, in which the working electrode potential is being raised in small increments and the spectrum is registered when the equilibrium is reached, indicated by no (or negligible) current in the electrochemical cell. By this method the onset of the doping process can be established with the precision below 10 mV. Oxidative or reductive doping of π-conjugated polymers gives rise to a bleaching of the p–p* transition band with correlated growth of two bands at higher wavelengths, characteristic of the doped state. Such evolution is clearly seen in the spectra of P1, registered for increasing working electrode potentials (see Fig. 5). Bleaching of the band at 460 nm is accompanied by an appearance and consecutive growth of two doping-induced bands with maxima at 651 nm and at 1964 nm.
 Fig. 5  UV-vis-NIR spectra of a thin film of P1 registered for increasing working electrode potential. Electrolyte: 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 in acetonitrile; potential vs. Fc/Fc+. 
Oxidative doping of conjugated polymers follows in general the two states model involving the formation of radical cations (polarons) in the first step and spinless dications (bipolarons) in the second one.20,21 In polymers showing a rather limited conjugation length and by consequence high oxidative doping potential, only the first oxidation process takes place which then is followed by the overoxidation. This seems to be the case for P1 since even at potential approaching the onset of the overoxidation the p–p* transition is not completely bleached out and further spectral evolution becomes minimal. The spectrum registered at E = 0.95 V resembles those characteristic of partially doped conjugated polymers or spectra of polymers in which host–guest interactions impede the doping process.22
From the point of view of the HOMO level determination the potential of the onset of the doping induced spectral changes is of crucial importance. In P1 these changes start to appear at E = 0.48 V and up to E = 0.70 V they are very pronounced. The spectroelectrochemically measured onset of the oxidative doping is lower by 50 mV as compared to that determined from cyclic voltammetry. As a result, the HOMO level determined from the spectroelectrochemical investigations is slightly higher than the one obtained using cyclic voltammetry data (−5.28 eV vs. −5.33 eV). We tend to believe that the value obtained by spectroelectrochemistry is more precise since it was measured in the quasi-static mode, using a technique extremely sensitive to the oxidative doping.
Raman spectroelectrochemistry
Before describing Raman spectroelectrochemical behaviour of P1 it is instructive to discuss the Raman bands attribution of the copolymers containing carbazole sub-units. In Fig. 6 the spectra of P1 and P2 are compared with that of poly(thienopyrroledione-alt-N-alkylcarbazole) which can be considered as a model compound (see Chart 2).
 Chart 2  Repeat unit of poly(1-5-methyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione-(2,7)carbazole). 
 Fig. 6  Raman spectra (λexc = 1064 nm) of: (a) P2, (b) P1, and (c) poly(1-5-methyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione-(2,7)carbazole) in their neutral (undoped) form. 
Four bands, at 1139, 1349, 1567 and 1622 cm−1, are common for three polymers studied and they can be assigned to the alkylcarbazole group as the CH deformation and three different C–C stretching vibration modes of the benzenoid rings. The strong band located at 1512 cm−1 for P1, at 1504 cm−1 for P2, and at 1529 cm−1 for poly(1-5-methyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione-(2,7)carbazole) is absent for carbazole-based homopolymers.23–27 It can therefore be unambiguously assigned to the CC stretching vibration of the thienopyrroledione group. Similarly, the bands pointed at 1442 cm−1 and 1492 cm−1, present in P1 and P2 as shoulders, are assigned to the ring deformation of the thienopyrroledione group. Alternatively these bands could be assigned to the CH2/CH3 deformation of the alkyl groups, but the Raman intensities of these vibration modes, especially in resonance conditions of the π-conjugated backbone, are usually very weak. Finally, the strong band observed at 1427 cm−1 and 1423 cm−1, for P1 and P2, respectively, is assigned without any ambiguity to the CC deformation mode to the alkylthiophene monomers.28
Bands appearing in the 1000–1350 cm−1 region are usually assigned to the CH deformation and to the stretching vibration of the C–C inter-ring bonds. By comparison, the bands located at 1205, 1229, and 1262 cm−1 arise from the alkylthiophene–alkylcarbazole, thienopyrroledione–alkylcarbazole, and thienopyrroledione–thienopyrroledione C–C inter-ring bonds. Bands around 1100 cm−1 are probably due to the CH in-plane deformation of carbazole and thiophene rings, and bands appearing at wavenumbers lower than 1000 cm−1 result from the out-of-plane deformations of the aromatic rings.
Having in mind these rather unambiguous attributions, we could analyze the spectroelectrochemical response of P1 associated with its doping. Significant changes are expected in the Raman spectra of the electrochemically doped polymer because this process involves lowering of the overall bond order as a consequence of an electron removal from the HOMO level (oxidative doping) or an electron addition to the LUMO level (reductive doping). This alters, in turn, the force constants of some bonds and leads to a shift of selected bands in the spectra of doped polymers. Moreover, doping frequently induces the changes in the bond sequence (for example quinoid vs. benzenoid) as well as in the conformation of the macromolecule. Thus, some Raman bands may disappear and new bands may appear because, upon doping, they may become symmetry forbidden or symmetry-allowed.
In Fig. 7, Raman spectra of P1, registered below and above the potential of the oxidative doping onset, are collected. From the open circuit potential (Eoc = −0.15 vs. Fc/Fc+) up to E = +0.55 V, no doping-induced changes are seen and all spectra remain essentially the same and characteristic of the neutral state of P1. Above this potential the intensity of the spectrum abruptly decreases and two bands originating from the terthiophene–pyrroledione sub-unit of P1 at 1512 cm−1 and 1427 cm−1 are shifted to 1450 cm−1 and 1409 cm−1, respectively (see the spectrum registered at E = 0.61 V). Such behaviour is typical of the electrochemical oxidation of poly(thiophene) derivatives and manifests the doping induced bond order lowering in the terthiophene–pyrroledione sub-unit of the polymer.28,29 The shift of these bands is accompanied by a quick disappearance of the band at 1620 cm−1 which is diagnostic of the neutral (undoped) carbazole unit. The carbazole band reappears at 1598 cm−1 in the spectrum of the degraded polymer (E = 0.92 V). Transformation of the Raman spectrum of doped P1 into the one typical of a degraded polymer, occurring over a very narrow potential range, additionally shows that the potentials of the doping and the overoxidation strongly overlap in this case, consistent with the cyclic voltammetry data.

Photovoltaic properties
For preliminary photovoltaic tests we have selected P3 the only system that displays the quasi-reversibility of the electrochemical reduction (Fig. 4d), the lowest optical gap and the broadest spectrum facilitating effective photons harvesting. In addition its HOMO and LUMO positions are appropriate for the use of PCBM as an electron acceptor.30 The bulk-heterojunction was fabricated by blending P3 with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) at a 1:2 ratio. The following cell configuration was used: glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3:[60]PCBM/Al.
The solar cell active area is of 25 mm2. Details of fabrication can be found in the ESI†. The J–V characteristics of the cell are presented in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  
J–V characteristics of the fabricated photovoltaic cell (active area of 25 mm2) obtained under AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm. 
The cell in this configuration was characterized by a short circuit current density of 5.27 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.40, and an open circuit voltage of 0.76 V, yielding an external power conversion efficiency of 1.63%. These preliminary results are very promising since neither the active layer morphology nor the interfaces were optimized. Further studies are in progress.
Conclusions
To conclude, two families of push–pull semiconducting copolymers based on diketopyrroledione electron-accepting units have been synthesized with two different electron-donating units, namely carbazole and dialkoxy substituted benzodithiophene. The supramolecular structure of all copolymers was similar and resembled that of P3HT since in all these cases the macromolecules self-assembly occurred through the same mechanism: π-stacking of the π-conjugated polymer backbones and interdigitation of lateral alkyl groups. As shown by spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations, apart from the polymer with 1:1 carbazole to diketopyrroledione ratio, all other copolymers showed band gaps inferior to 2.0 eV and appropriate positions of the HOMO and LUMO levels which make them suitable photovoltaic cells. Preliminary results for non-optimized devices revealed power conversion efficiency up to 1.63%.

Characterization techniques

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian AS400 and a 200 MHz Bruker Spectrometer. X-ray diffractogram were recorded using a Siemens D5000 X-ray diffractometer with a CuKα1 radiation source (λ = 1.540598 Å). The operation power was 40 kV, 30 mA and the collimator was 0.8 mm in diameter.
Cyclic voltammetry investigations were performed on either an Autolab potentiostat PGSTAT302, interfaced to a PC computer, or on a Solartron 1287 potentiostat. The studied polymers were deposited onto a platinum working electrode. The experiments were carried out in 0.1 M solution of Bu4NBF4 in acetonitrile either in a glove box or under constant argon flow. An Ag wire was used as a pseudo-reference electrode and its potential was calibrated at each experiment using Fc/Fc+ couple. Pt sheet served as a counter electrode.
For the UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical studies, P1 was deposited onto an ITO electrode. Ag/0.1 M AgNO3 served as a reference electrode and a Pt sheet as a counter electrode. As in the case of cyclic voltammetry, the experiments were carried out in 0.1 M Bu4NBF4/acetonitrile electrolyte.
For Raman spectroelectrochemistry a thin layer of P1 was deposited onto a platinum electrode. The reference and counter electrodes as well as the electrolyte were the same as in the case of UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry investigations.
The UV-vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrometer whereas the Raman spectra were obtained using a FT Raman Bruker RFS 100 spectrometer with the near-IR excitation line (1064 nm). UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Bio-Tek Instruments UVIKON XS spectrometer.
TGA measurements were carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA SDTA 851e apparatus (heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow) and the temperature of degradation (Td) corresponds to a 5% weight loss. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer DSC-7 instrument, calibrated with ultrapure indium. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined using a scanning rate of 20 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow.
For analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) fractionation and characterizations on a Chemstation 1260 (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a 300 × 7.5 mm PLgel Mixed-D 5 μm/104 Å column (Varian), a diode array UV-vis detector (DAD) and a fraction collector, see ESI†.

The project and the collaboration between laboratories were possible thanks to the Rhône-Alpes Région International Mobility for the EXPLORA DOC 2010 (CMIRA) fellowship. One of the authors (M.Z.) wants to acknowledge the financial support from the Warsaw University of Technology. We thank Rodica Neagu-Plesu for TGA and DSC measurements and David Djurado for the results and discussion.
