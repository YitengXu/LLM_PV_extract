    , Accepted 5th June 2017First published on 5th June 2017AbstractLow bandgap small molecules, BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR, with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the central donor unit and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) as the second acceptor block, which were also π-bridged with terthiophenes on both sides, and end-capped with 3-ethylrhodanine electron-accepting groups, have been successfully synthesized for highly efficient small molecule solar cells (SM-OSCs). Based on tactful material design and device engineering, the resulting SM-OSCs processed with a halogen-free solvent of CS2 exhibited a high efficiency of 11.53% with a very small energy loss of 0.57 eV.

Broader context
Small molecule donor materials have emerged as promising candidates for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their simple synthesis, well-defined molecular structures, high reproducibility, easy purification and high crystallinity. The reported efficient small molecule solar cells (SM-OSCs) commonly suffer from limitations of large energy loss (Eloss) and low charge carrier mobilities. Here, we developed two novel medium sized small molecules based on naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole, denoted as BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR. By selecting halogen-free carbon disulfide (CS2) as the processing solvent instead of the commonly used chloroform (CF), the resulting SM-OSCs exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.53% with a very small energy loss of 0.57 eV. This work provides an interesting strategy via tactful material design and device engineering for developing high-performance SM-OSCs.

Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have been considered to be a renewable and clean energy conversion technology.1 In the past decades, great efforts have been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ-OSCs, which has exceeded 12% in both single-junction and multi-junction devices.2 But for the reported small molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) with high performance, a relatively large energy loss (Eloss) (Table S1, ESI†) was observed to limit the further elevation of their device efficiencies, which is defined as Eloss = Eg − qVoc,3 where Eg is the band gap of the photosensitive material, Voc is the open-circuit voltage of the device and q is the elemental charge. Generally, the Eloss comes from the radiative recombination loss and non-radiative recombination loss.3,4 For an ideal solar cell of any type, the Shockley–Queisser limit sets the maximum voltage (VSQoc).5 The offset between Eg and qVSQoc is related to the radiative recombination loss, originating from the absorption above the bandgap, which is definitely unavoidable as any light-absorbing medium must also emit light.3,6 Apart from that, for a typical OSC, there is also an additional radiative recombination from the absorption below the bandgap due to the existence of the charge transfer (CT) state, which is an interfacial electronic state with a lower energy (ECT) than the bandgap. The CT state is composed of an electron in the acceptor material and a hole in the donor material, which can be directly recombined back to the ground state.7 Historically, to provide a sufficient driving force for the above charge separation in OSCs, donor and acceptor materials were typically selected to have electron affinities with a gap of 0.1–0.3 eV, which would reduce qVoc by the same amount.7b,8 Therefore, the ECT sets the maximum value for Voc in that case.9 However, some recent studies reported OSCs with a small energy driving force, thus giving rise to a small Eloss and high device performance.3b,10 The results indicated that the driving force could be lowered by rational material design, which made the ECT close to the Eg for reducing the above radiative recombination loss. On the other side, the non-radiative recombination in actual OSCs is caused by the presence of defects, such as energetic disorder and impurities that act as recombination centers. This type of recombination can be aggravated by the low mobility of the active layer,3a,7b,11 which is expressed by an empirical relationship of ECT − qVoc ≈ 0.6 eV.6,7b,9 With sophisticated material design, skillful device engineering and in-depth understanding of the Eloss mechanism, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have shown high PCEs of more than 10% with a low Eloss.3b,10a However, there are only very few cases of SM-OSCs exhibiting high PCEs with a relatively small Eloss.10e
SM donor materials are promising candidates due to their simple synthetic procedures, well-defined molecular structures, high reproducibility, easy purification, and high crystallinity with extraordinary ordered stacking properties.12 Because of the limited conjugation length of molecular backbones in SM systems, a relatively small variation in site energies is observed in an SM film compared to a conjugated polymer counterpart, leading to the reduction of the so-called energetic disorder.13 The reduced energetic disorder will influence positively the rate of charge transport and the charge separation efficiencies, contributing to a decreased Eloss value.13 As mentioned above, there are still limited SM-OSCs exhibiting high PCEs with a small Eloss value.10e,14 Apart from the large Eloss, the state-of-the-art SM-OSCs also frequently exhibit relatively lower charge carrier mobilities (<10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than those (>10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the polymer counterparts,14,15 resulting in poorer device performance. Obviously, the limited length of the SM backbone restricts linear extension of π-conjugation, impeding its absorption from expanding to the longer wavelength region. Strong donor (D)–acceptor (A) pairs could extend absorption but would decrease the energy level offsets, which would sacrifice the Voc of the related devices.10e Considering the merits of polymer materials, such as high absorption coefficient, wide absorption range, high charge carrier mobility, good film forming capability and excellent thermal robustness,16 some attempts have been made recently to take advantage of both small molecules and polymers to design a “medium-sized molecule” system with extended D–A alternating conjugation.16,17 Increasing the conjugation length of the SM backbone would reveal beneficial physical and photoelectric properties as well as improved photovoltaic performances when integrated into SM-OSCs.16,17
Herein, we present the design and synthesis of two novel SMs, BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR (Fig. 1a), with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the central donor unit, and naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) as the internal second acceptor blocks, which are π-bridged with terthiophenes on both sides, and end-capped with 3-ethylrhodanine groups. Due to the largely π-extended ring and strong electron affinity, NT-based copolymers reported previously exhibited low-lying HOMO energy levels with low band gaps, extremely high crystallinities and large hole mobilities of over 0.5 cm2 V s−1,18 contributing to their high performances in PSCs with a large film thickness tolerance.15,19 In this work, for the first time, NT has been applied to the SM donor design for efficient SM-OSCs. On the other hand, the strategy of sulfur atom insertion was also employed to further fine-tune the properties of the resulting SMs. The sulfur atom has a π-accepting capability due to the formation of pπ(C)–dπ(S) orbital overlap, where the divalent sulfur can accept π-electrons from the adjacent p-orbital of the CC into its empty 3d-orbital.20 Inserting sulfur atoms can reduce the steric hindrance as it can move the branching point far from the molecular backbone, which has been explored in the branched alkyl side chains.15b,21 In addition, the inserted sulfur atoms can induce S–S interactions and thus facilitate a better π–π stacking.22 These advantages endow alkylthio-containing photovoltaic polymers and small molecules with lower-lying HOMO levels, higher crystallinities as well as large charge mobilities, resulting in higher PCEs in PSCs and SM-OSCs. As expected, these newly designed SMs exhibit highly planar structures, wide absorptions (up to 800 nm), low-lying HOMO levels (∼−5.3 eV) and high hole mobilities (2.45 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BDTSTNTTR). The related SM-OSCs produced a moderate PCE value of 8.06% for BDTTNTTR and 9.71% for BDTSTNTTR when chloroform (CF) was used as the processing solvent. However, if carbon disulfide (CS2) is used as the solvent, dramatically improved PCEs of 10.02% for BDTTNTTR and 11.53% for BDTSTNTTR devices were achieved. Importantly, a very small Eloss of 0.57 eV was observed in the BDTSTNTTR devices, which is due to the better band gap alignment with a small lowest unoccupied molecular orbital offset (ΔLUMO) of 0.14 eV through material design and morphology control. To our best knowledge, such PCE and Eloss values are the best recorded for single-junction SM-OSCs reported so far.

BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR were synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation of the dialdehyde intermediates (7a and 7b) with 3-ethylrhodanine in good yields (Scheme S1, ESI†). Both SMs are readily soluble in common solvents, such as CF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene (CB) and CS2 at room temperature. BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR also exhibit a good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 381 and 370 °C, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). The UV-vis absorptions of BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR exhibit three well-defined peaks in both CF solutions (1 × 10−5 M) and thin films (Fig. 1b), corresponding to their 0–0 (700–800 nm), 0–1 (600–700 nm), and 0–2 (400–500 nm) transitions.23 The 0–2 peak is attributed to the π–π* transition, while the 0–0 and 0–1 peaks are ascribed to the inter- and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions, respectively.23,24 The more pronounced 0–0 transition observed from solution to the film state demonstrates the enhanced interchain aggregation during the film formation. Both SMs have a relatively broad absorption range and strong absorption ability with the highest molar extinction coefficient of 0.98 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for BDTTNTTR and 1.25 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for BDTSTNTTR, respectively, which should be beneficial for absorbing enough photons and generating high photocurrent. The optical band gaps (Egs) of BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR were calculated to be 1.51 eV and 1.50 eV from the absorption onsets of their thin films. Compared to BDTTNTTR, almost 20 nm red-shifts of the 0–0 and 0–1 peaks of BDTSTNTTR indicate that inserting sulfur atoms has a positive effect on the molecular aggregation, but less effect on the band gap. The HOMO/LUMO levels were determined to be −5.29/−3.53 eV for BDTTNTTR, and −5.35/−3.60 eV for BDTSTNTTR (Fig. 1c), respectively, from the corresponding cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. S2, ESI†). The lower HOMO level of BDTSTNTTR should have potential for achieving a higher Voc from its SM-OSCs, while the better LUMO alignment of BDTSTNTTR and PC71BM than that of BDTTNTTR and PC71BM can be expected to decrease the Eloss value.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations25 indicate that both SMs exhibit planar geometries with a quinoidal structure distributed along the whole backbones (Fig. 2a). The large planar structures should be favorable for improving molecular stacking and thus resulting in high carrier mobility. The simulated HOMO/LUMO levels were calculated to be −4.77/−3.10 eV and −4.86/−3.14 eV for BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). Agreeing well with the CV measurements, the introduced sulfur atoms could effectively lower the energy levels but affect less their band gaps.
 Fig. 2  Optimized molecular geometries (a) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles (b) of the SMs. 
Both SMs exhibit high crystallinities as confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 2b). The (100) and (010) diffraction peaks of BDTTNTTR are located at 2θ = 4.50° and 22.0°, corresponding to the lamellar and π–π stacking distances (dl and dπ) of 19.6 Å and 4.04 Å, respectively. In contrast, BDTSTNTTR shows a larger dl value of 20.1 Å, which was calculated from the (100) peak at 2θ = 4.40°, due to the longer alkylthio side chains. Also the second order (200) (2θ = 8.9°) and third order (300) (2θ = 13.3°) diffraction peaks are observed from the BDTSTNTTR film, indicating its higher crystallinity than BDTTNTTR. BDTSTNTTR also shows a stronger (010) diffraction peak at 2θ = 22.6°, corresponding to a shorter dπ value of 3.93 Å. The stronger lamellar stacking and π–π stacking endow BDTSTNTTR with a higher carrier mobility than BDTTNTTR, which is expected to achieve higher Jsc in the related SM-OSCs.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties, SM-OSCs with a conventional architecture of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/cuprous thiocyanate (CuSCN)/SM:PC71BM/zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac)/Al were fabricated and evaluated. CF, which has been used commonly in the fabrication of SM-OSCs, was firstly used as the solvent. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, the BDTTNTTR devices exhibit a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 14.01 mA cm−2, and a moderate PCE of 8.06%, which is mainly limited by the relatively low FF value (63.9%). When using alkylthiothiophene side chains instead of alkylthiophene side chains, the BDTSTNTTR devices generate a synergistically improved Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 15.45 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68.3%, giving rise to a much higher PCE of 9.71%. As discussed above, both SMs exhibit a strong aggregation property, thus inducing large domains during the device fabrication. Therefore, solvents with a lower boiling point, such as dichloromethane (DCM) and CS2, should be expected to reduce the drying time to control the molecular aggregation. For comparison, higher boiling point solvents of chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were first used to fabricate the SM-OSCs (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†). The BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR devices using CB as the solvent exhibited relatively low PCEs of 3.54% and 5.00%, respectively, which were further reduced to 2.43% and 3.36% if using DCB instead of CB. The low Jsc and FF values would be responsible for the above poor device performances. Considering the solvability issue and halogen-free concept here, CS2 was chosen as the solvent to improve the performance of the devices, which has long been used in solution-processing procedures26 and solvent annealing (SVA) treatments25,27 in SM-OSCs. As expected, significantly elevated PCEs of 10.02% and 11.53% were then obtained for the BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR devices, respectively (Table 1). The significant enhancements of Jsc (15.70 mA cm−2 for BDTTNTTR and 16.21 mA cm−2 for BDTSTNTTR) and FF (71.7% for BDTTNTTR and 76.5% for BDTSTNTTR) should be responsible for the above enhanced device performances. The improved Jscs were further confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 3b). Both types of SM-OSCs exhibit a wide spectrum response ranging from 300 to 800 nm, which agrees well with the optical absorptions of the studied SMs. The calculated Jscs were 14.20 mA cm−2 and 15.31 mA cm−2 for the BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR devices using CF as the solvent, and 15.58 mA cm−2 and 16.10 mA cm−2 when processed with the CS2 solvent, which are consistent with those evaluated from the J–V measurements.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to study the solvent condition effect on the molecular aggregation and phase separation behaviors. Both blend films processed with CF exhibited a rough surface with a large phase separation as could be found from the AFM images (Fig. S5, ESI†). The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) was 3.79 nm for BDTTNTTR:PC71BM blend and 3.04 nm for BDTSTNTTR:PC71BM blend, respectively. The TEM images showed more clearly the inhomogeneous large molecular aggregations (Fig. S5i and k, ESI†), especially for the BDTTNTTR:PC71BM, corresponding to the relatively lower device performance. The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) were measured to be 2.01/0.25 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BDTTNTTR:PC71BM blend and 3.18/0.48 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BDTSTNTTR:PC71BM blend, calculated from the J–V measurements of the hole- and electron-only devices (Fig. S7, ESI†). When using CS2 as the processing solvent, both active blends displayed significantly reduced RMS values of 1.70 nm for BDTTNTTR:PC71BM and 1.55 nm for BDTSTNTTR:PC71BM with a more favorable nanophase separation. More than that, a uniform interpenetration network with well-defined nanofibrils could be observed in their TEM images, which was beneficial for charge dissociation and transfer. In this case, the μh/μe values were measured to be 1.23/1.66 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.45/1.98 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, showing a better μh/μe balance, giving rise to the higher Jsc and FF values in their devices. In contrast to the low boiling point solvents, high boiling point solvents would undergo a slower drying process, resulting in serious molecular aggregation of the related blend films with RMS values over 7 nm, especially for the DCB based devices, extremely large scale phase domains were observed. The strong aggregations were also confirmed by the TEM measurements (Fig. S6i–l, ESI†), in which higher ordered nanowires up to a micrometer scale could be observed, especially for the DCB processed films. Such large aggregations were not beneficial for charge dissociation but resulted in dramatic charge recombination. Therefore, the unfavorable morphology and extremely large phase separation caused by using CB and DCB solvents can explain their inferior efficiencies.
The dependence of Voc on light intensity (Plight) can be used to describe the order of the recombination processes in the BHJ film. The semi-logarithmic plot of Voc depends linearly on the light intensity with a slope of kT/q for bimolecular recombination. A slope greater than kT/q points toward trap-assisted recombination, where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge.28 For BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR, the CS2 processed devices were measured with a slope of 1.12kT/q and 1.21kT/q, respectively, which were smaller than those of 1.30kT/q and 1.44kT/q treated by CF solvent, indicating that reduced trap-assisted recombination was realized by using CS2 as the solvent (Fig. 4a). The correlation between Jsc and Plight is expressed by a power-law equation of Jsc ∝ Pαlight. The exponential factor of α is close to 1.0, which is the result of weak bimolecular recombination during sweep-out, while α < 1.0 is indicative of significant bimolecular recombination and/or a build up of space-charge.28,29 The slopes (α) of 0.97 and 0.99 were determined for the BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR devices processed with CS2, which were higher than those (0.91 and 0.94) obtained from the cases processed with CF, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination was effectively suppressed to lead to higher charge density. Jphvs. Veff plots can be used to evaluate the charge generation and extraction efficiencies. Jph at the saturation point implies the efficiency of the charge generation process. Commonly, the influence of charge extraction would be ignored at high internal voltage, indicating that almost all of the photogenerated charges within the device are collected.28–30Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities of the devices under illumination and in the dark, Veff is defined as V0–V, where V0 is the voltage at which JL = JD, and V is the applied voltage. As shown in Fig. 4c, Jph is linear proportional to the voltage at low Veff, and reaches saturation (Jsat) at a high reverse voltage range (Veff > 2 V), where the recombination is suppressed due to the high internal electric field. The charge dissociation probability, P(E,T), can be estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat, which was 0.93 vs. 0.88 for BDTSTNTTR and 0.95 vs. 0.90 for BDTTNTTR devices under short-circuit conditions when CS2 was used instead of CF, implying that CS2-processed devices had higher exciton dissociation rate. On the other hand, the insertion of sulfur atoms had a positive effect on promoting the exciton dissociation and reducing charge recombination, regardless of the processing conditions, thus contributing to the whole elevation of the device performance.

Although these SMs have relatively low band gaps around 1.50 eV, the Vocs are extremely high, with values of 0.89 V for BDTTNTTR and 0.93 V for BDTSTNTTR. The low band gaps should be attributed to the extended π-conjugations as well as the improved “weak donor–strong acceptor” effect31 by introducing the electron-deficient NT group as the second acceptor block. Furthermore, this strategy also endows these SMs with small ΔLUMO values (Fig. 1c) in combination with low-lying HOMO levels at the same time. In this work, Voc has been fine-tuned with respect to Eg. The BDTTNTTR devices exhibit a relatively small Eloss of 0.62 eV. However, the insertion of sulfur atoms on the conjugated side chains decreases the ΔLUMO value (0.14 eV vs. 0.21 eV, Fig. 1c) of the BDTSTNTTR devices, giving rise to a very low Eloss of 0.57 eV. This value is the smallest one for fullerene-based SM-OSCs reported so far. Fig. 4d shows the plots of PCE against Eloss for the reported SM-OSCs with high performances. Black filled spheres were produced referring to the literature reports (Table S2, ESI†), while the colored symbols were plotted from the results obtained in this work. Compared to the reported cases, the BDTSTNTTR devices show a high PCE with Eloss less than 0.6 eV. This should be due to not only the material design but also the device engineering. Clearly, the maximum EQE value of the BDTSTNTTR device was effectively improved from 63% to 68% by using CS2 instead of CF, resulting from the optimized morphology and suppressed charge recombination.
In summary, two novel medium-sized SMs, BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR, have been designed and synthesized for efficient SM-OSCs. By introducing the electron deficient NT group as the second acceptor block and extending the π-conjugation length of the whole small molecular backbone, these SMs exhibited low band gaps around 1.50 eV, and low-lying energy levels. They also exhibit a wide absorption range of more than 800 nm, and high carrier mobilities of 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1. The introduction of sulfur atoms in the side chains further lowered the HOMO/LUMO levels, resulting in a higher Voc of 0.93 V with a very low Eloss of 0.57 V for the BDTSTNTTR devices. When choosing a halogen-free solvent of CS2 instead of the commonly used CF, the morphology was fine-tuned with a desirable nanophase separation. Thus, the EQE response was improved to 68% and the FF value was elevated to over 76%. Finally, a high PCE of 11.53% with the smallest Eloss of 0.57 eV was obtained from the BDTSTNTTR devices. This work provides an interesting strategy via tactful material design and device engineering for developing highly efficient SM-OSCs.

Broader context
Small molecule donor materials have emerged as promising candidates for organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their simple synthesis, well-defined molecular structures, high reproducibility, easy purification and high crystallinity. The reported efficient small molecule solar cells (SM-OSCs) commonly suffer from limitations of large energy loss (Eloss) and low charge carrier mobilities. Here, we developed two novel medium sized small molecules based on naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole, denoted as BDTTNTTR and BDTSTNTTR. By selecting halogen-free carbon disulfide (CS2) as the processing solvent instead of the commonly used chloroform (CF), the resulting SM-OSCs exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.53% with a very small energy loss of 0.57 eV. This work provides an interesting strategy via tactful material design and device engineering for developing high-performance SM-OSCs.
