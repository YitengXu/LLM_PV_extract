Herein, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA), a crosslinked polymerizable bi-functional defect passivation agent along with an initiator, is incorporated into the antisolvent. Via an in situ polymerization strategy motivated during the film annealing treatment, the formed TFEMA dimers will be clustered at the surface and GBs. The polymerized bulkier molecules via CO⋯Pb coordination bonds and N–H⋯F hydrogen bonding interactions can simultaneously neutralize under coordinated lead ions and improve the device stability. Moreover, the TFEMA dimers left on the top of the perovskite active layer that acts as a buffer layer can suppress interfacial nonradiative recombination and tune energy-level alignment between the layers. Consequently, the device fabricated in open air acquires a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.18%, along with enhanced stability, where 85.5% and 82.7% of the original efficiency is maintained after consecutive 300 h thermal annealing process and 2400 h shelf storage, respectively. By applying an in situ polymerization strategy to the PSCs, we corroborate the effectiveness of this methodology to achieve the purpose of tremendous augments in efficiency and stability.
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have gained unprecedented interest, mainly due to their impressive photovoltaic properties and brightening low-cost manufacturing processes, offering a boundless space to exploit in photovoltaics research community.1–3 Despite the sky-rocketing efficiencies that the technology witnessed during the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have not yet lived up to the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of their theoretical predictions and are still constrained by the long-term stability issues.4–6 In particular, the shelf instability of the solar cells under harsh operational conditions remains a foremost bottleneck on the road to the large-scale commercial application.7,8 To date, extensive research has demonstrated that the decomposition of perovskite films is preferentially diffused from the surface and grain boundaries (GBs) to the grain interiors on account of the high defect level and charge accumulation in these regions.9–11 Meanwhile, these detrimental defects always served as the centers of nonradiative recombination, which can deteriorate and dampen the photovoltaic properties of the devices.7 Therefore, it is highly expected that favorable passivation effects to decrease and relieve trap-assisted nonradiative recombination are accomplished by extending the device longevity and improving the efficiency.
In this context, various materials such as small organic molecules, polymers, and organic ammonium salts have been widely introduced into perovskite materials for the intention of passivating the defects and enhancing the device stability.12–14 Among them, owing to charming chemical and physical properties as well as multiple functionalities, polymer macromolecules are promising partners for naturally sensitive perovskite materials.13,15 In antecedent studies, some polymer additives have been successfully applied to PSCs, and they express remarkable performance in improving the device photovoltaic properties and shelf stability.16–18 However, owing to the relatively strong chemical chelation between the polymer passivation agents and the perovskites, precipitation in the perovskite precursor solution does happen, which can cause unsatisfied effects and degenerate the photovoltaic properties.19,20 As a result, an alternative strategy to introduce crosslinked polymerizable polymer monomer units into the perovskite active layer and subsequently stimulate an in situ polymerization process during the film annealing treatment is proposed. For instance, Li et al. employed a polymerizable small organic molecule (trimethylolpropane triacrylate) to the perovskite active layer.21 These polymer monomers can be chemically anchored on the perovskite GBs and then, after annealing treatment, an in situ crosslinking process is triggered to form a consecutive polymer network, thus enhancing the moisture, thermal, and light-soaking stability. Furthermore, Zhao et al. doped dimethyl itaconate monomer units into a PbI2 precursor solution first, and then motivated an in situ polymerization process using an initiator, during the subsequent PbI2 film annealing procedure.22 The modified devices exhibited both noticeable improvements in device efficiency and shelf stability. Despite some studies in which crosslinked polymerizable monomers are incorporated into a perovskite film, to the best of our knowledge, the correlation has not been fully understood and what is really happening to perovskites chemically and structurally while monomer units form bulkier polymers at the surface and GBs is yet to be elucidated.
A well-recognized molecule, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA), as a semi-fluorinated monomer unit with CC, C–F, and CO multiple functional groups, highlights superior light-resistance and superhydrophobic properties.23–25 Meanwhile, the TFEMA monomers, together with the matched initiator, are pretty easy to trigger an in situ polymerization process to form bulkier polymer macromolecules. In this work, we utilized an in situ polymerization strategy to fabricate highly efficient and stable PSCs with a perovskite composition of Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (CsFAMA; FA: formamidinium; MA: methylammonium) (Fig. S1, ESI†). To be specific, the crosslinked polymerizable TFEMA monomer units (Fig. 1a), along with 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) as the reaction initiator, were first dispersed in the antisolvent, enabling sufficient chemical connection between the monomers and the AIBN initiators. During the subsequent film thermal treatment, an in situ polymerization process was stimulated, where the CC bonds of the TFEMA molecules are completely cracked and then reconnected to the neighboring monomer units to form bulkier polymers. Meanwhile, the AIBN initiators can decompose rapidly at a proper thermal annealing temperature (150 °C) and do not retain any products in the final perovskite films (Fig. S2†).26,27 The detailed chemical equations with an in situ polymerization process are described in the Experimental sections in the ESI.† The formed bulkier polymers gathered at the perovskite surface and GBs can efficiently passivate the defects via the coordination bond interaction between carbonyl groups (CO) and undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, without sacrificing the chemical crosslinking interaction between the CC bonds. In the as-prepared perovskite films, the fluorinated polymers have been demonstrated to be able to serve as a hydrophobic layer to restrain the moisture permeation, while the amino groups (N–H) of perovskites and the F atom of the TFEMA dimers can form N–H⋯F hydrogen bonds to block the irreversible degradation of ions in the perovskite materials under thermal stress (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the formed fiber-like dimers accumulated at the interface act as a blocking layer between the perovskite active layer and spiro-OMeTAD, preventing their direct contact. The well-passivated insulated areas can suppress nonradiative recombination and modulate the energy-level alignment between the layers. Therefore, the highest PCE of 20.18% of the optimized PSCs has been achieved for the device assembled under open air condition. Additionally, the devices fabricated via an in situ polymerization strategy also exhibit improved moisture and thermal stability.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were carried out before and after thermal treatment to track the in situ polymerization process of the TFEMA monomers during the preparation of the perovskite film. As displayed in Fig. 1b and c, pure TFEMA monomers exhibit characteristic peaks of CC stretching (around 1636 cm−1), CH2 bending (around 885 cm−1), CO stretching (around 1749 cm−1), and C–F stretching (around 1400 cm−1) vibration before an in situ crosslinking process.28–30 However, compared to the pure TFEMA monomer, an evident shift of the characteristic CO vibration peak toward a lower wavenumber is seen in the treated perovskite film, underscoring the suitable molecular chemical chelation between the TFEMA dimers and the perovskites.31 After the film heat treatment, both the CC stretching and CH2 bending vibration peaks disappear, which indicates that the monomer units are absolutely converted into the bulkier polymers. It is worthy noting that the weakened CN stretching vibration peak of FAI in the CsFAMA-based perovskites appears at about 1640 cm−1, which overlaps with the CC vibration of CH2CH in the TFEMA monomers (Fig. S3†).21,32 The FTIR spectra (Fig. S3†) of the TFEMA monomers and dimers before and after the films' thermal procedure were also measured. Furthermore, aiming to further verify the in situ polymerization process of the TFEMA monomers in the perovskite structure, liquid-state 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of the corresponding molecules were collected in deuterium dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6), as shown in Fig. S4.† The sample of the TFEMA monomers exhibits the expected vinyl hydrogen proton signals before an in situ polymerization strategy, while the unsaturated vinyl signal completely vanishes with the appearance of new displacements and the shift of old chemical peaks in the TFEMA dimers. This implies that all the TFEMA monomers can motivate an in situ crosslinking interaction to fully transform into the bulkier polymers during the film annealing treatment, since the emergence of downfield alkyl signals suggests that vinyl bonds have been polymerized to form sp3 carbons.
In light of the existence of the crosslinked bulkier polymers on the perovskite surface, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were collected. Fig. 2a–c shows the top-view SEM images of the pristine perovskite film and the films processed with the TFEMA monomers and dimers, respectively. All the films display different grain sizes, and serving to mirror this change accurately, a statistical distribution of grain size is gained from the corresponding SEM images (Fig. S5†). The average grain sizes increase from about 219 nm of the pristine film to about 543 nm of the TFEMA-monomer-integrated film and about 712 nm of the TFEMA-dimer-optimized film. This observation is believed to be that the TFEMA dimers can decrease the nucleation probability and postpone the crystallization rate, resulting in a reduction in the number of nuclei and an increase in grain size.19 The top-view SEM images in Fig. S6,† however, verify that the surface morphology is not homogeneous. The low concentration of the TFEMA monomers (1.2 mg mL−1) polymerizes fiber-like features on the top of the perovskite active layer. Instead, the higher concentration (2 mg mL−1) exhibits island-like structures. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental distribution maps (Fig. S7†) obtained on the top of the polymer-integrated films substantiate that the substances consist of an oxygen-rich material, presumably primarily the TFEMA dimers. However, the weakened I and Pb signals, where the outlines are consistent with these substances on the perovskite surface, are attributed to the aggregation of the polymer molecules. Fig. S8† depicts the cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite films without and with an in situ polymerization strategy. The compact and larger crystal domains with a pinhole-free morphology treated by the TFEMA dimers can be observed along the direction of the carrier transport. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) analysis provides microscopic information of surface topography of the films. As shown in Fig. S9,† the perovskite film treated by the TFEMA dimers exhibits a root-mean-square (RMS) of 17.71 nm, which is lower than those of the pristine film (21.03 nm) and the TFEMA-monomer-processed film (19.34 nm). This implies that the decrease in roughness in the areas where there are no polymer clusters is accompanied by an increase in the grain size in the presence of an in situ polymerization strategy.33

Furthermore, we use high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images (Fig. 2d) to explore the structure of the perovskite films after an in situ polymerization strategy. An amorphous region is perceptibly discernible between several consecutive different perovskite crystals, implying the polymerization of the long-chain polymers between them. In addition, the formation of the nucleus and subsequent crystallization occur preferentially in those regions without the long-chain polymer molecules, making the TFEMA dimers aggregate on the GBs or surface without being doped inside the perovskite grain interiors. The interplanar spacings of the perovskite crystals are analyzed in Fig. S10,† accompanied by the corresponding magnified HRTEM images. For the CsFAMA-based perovskite films obtained via an in situ polymerization strategy, the crystals in the inner regions of the yellow ellipses have interplanar spacings of 0.41, 0.61, 0.31, 0.35, and 0.28 nm and a defined Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern, corresponding to the (110), (100), (200), (111), and (210) planes of the cubic perovskite crystal phases, respectively.22,34
Furthermore, the enlarged grain sizes, together with the formed polymers, conductive to the superior crystallinity, are verified in the evolution by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, as presented in Fig. 2e. With the formation of the bulkier polymers, the XRD peak positions remain the same, ensuring that the perovskite crystal structure remains unchanged. This means that the polymer molecules may be polymerized at the GBs or surface without being embedded into the crystal lattice of the perovskite. Sometimes, a reflection signal was not observed in the films containing FAI, suggesting the low-dimensional perovskite phases either do not form in the existence of FAI or are highly disordered, which prevents their detection.35,36 The PbI2 peak located at 12.68° in the sample may be ascribed to the degradation of perovskite materials caused by the escape of organic cations during the annealing procedure of the perovskite films, resulting in excessive PbI2 being left in the perovskite precursors.37 After the in situ crosslinking strategy, the peak intensity of PbI2 is perceptibly reduced. It is attributed to the polymerization effect between the TFEMA dimers and the CsFAMA-based perovskites, which effectively alleviates the degradation of the perovskite materials. Meanwhile, the intensity of the (100) peak of the targeted sample is appreciably augmented compared to that of the pristine film, which coincides with superior crystallinity with large grain sizes as confirmed in the SEM images. The better crystallization property in the films is also well mirrored in the evolution of higher intensity on almost the entire light absorption range, which is inferred from ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy (Fig. 2f). The polymerized bulkier polymers are beneficial for serving as crosslinking agents at the surface or GBs via interacting with undercoordinated dangling bonds without introducing more defects to grain interiors.
To further elaborate the chemical interaction between the TFEMA dimers and perovskite materials, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was implemented. The corresponding XPS full spectra of the perovskite and iodide peak are shown in Fig. S11.† The XPS spectra of Pb 4f signals are shown in Fig. 3a. After optimization, the two peak positions in the perovskite film for Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 of Pb2+ ions from the perovskite film obviously shift toward a lower binding energy, indicating a decreased oxidation state of lead due to the electron donation from the functionalized crosslinking agent.38 Meanwhile, the metallic Pb is eliminated in the modified film, which originates from the effective defect passivation. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 3b, the archetypical CN and C–N signals at 399.59 and 398.02 eV refer to the FA+ and MA+ cations in the pristine perovskite film, respectively. After the in situ polymerization process, the characteristic peaks of CN and C–N bonds shift to higher binding energies than those of the pristine sample, which is attributed to the suitable molecular interaction between the MAI/FAI and the TFEMA dimers. In order to gain deeper insights into the chemical interaction between the TFEMA dimers and the perovskite, the liquid-state 1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out. As everyone knows, the TFEMA dimers contain plentiful fluorine atoms, which can easily bridge with the H atom of the perovskite materials to form N–H⋯F hydrogen bonding interactions owing to their strong electronegativity.39 The resonance peak appearing at δ = 7.81 ppm for the N–H bonds in MA+ (Fig. 3c and d) exhibits a mild chemical displacement after the formation of the TFEMA dimers, which may be an visible evidence of the presence of hydrogen bonding interactions (N–H⋯F) between the perovskites and the long-chain polymers.40 Furthermore, we also compare 1H NMR spectra of FAI and a mixture of FAI and TFEMA dimer solutions (Fig. S12†) mainly considering that FAI has similar chemical construction with MAI and, at the same time, it owns more N–H bonds.

(d) The corresponding magnification scales. (e) PL spectra and (f) TRPL curves of the devices with a conformation of glass/perovskite. 
Moreover, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy study was used to explore the excitation and mobility of carriers in the perovskite films in Fig. 3e. The PL intensity of the optimized device is much higher than that of the pristine solar cell. Besides, the PL peak between the pristine film and the optimal sample exhibited 16 nm Stokes shifts. The emission maxima of the PL peak of the pristine sample are located at 788 nm, whereas for the polymer-integrated film, they appear at 772 nm. The blue-shifted PL peak suggests that the bulkier polymer molecules can effectively passivate the defects along the GBs and surface as a result of their suitable coordination with perovskite materials as mirrored in FTIR, XPS, and NMR measurements.21 Moreover, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decays of the perovskite films are also conducted to analyze the dynamics of interfacial electron–hole recombination. The PL decay curves for the perovskite films with and without an in situ polymerization strategy deposited on a clean glass substrate are collected in Fig. 3f and the detailed parameters are also summarized in Table S1.† In this model, the fast-decay PL species (τ1) could be ascribed to the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, and the slower PL components (τ2) are attributed to radiative recombination in the bulk perovskite films.41 The film processed via an in situ crosslinking strategy emerges at fast- and slow-phase lifetimes of τ1 = 33.65 ns and τ2 = 72.42 ns, respectively. For the pristine sample, the values are τ1 = 22.35 ns and τ2 = 55.17 ns, respectively. The longer PL lifetime is generally considered with a lower defect level within the films and suppressed nonradiative recombination of the charge carriers, which mainly originates from the efficient passivation effect of the polymers at the GBs and surface.42
Aiming to investigate the influence of the formed polymer molecules on the photoelectronic performance of the devices, the PSCs with a configuration of ITO/SnO2/crosslinked perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag are exhibited in Fig. 4a. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were utilized to explore the impact of an in situ polymerization strategy on the surface chemical state of the perovskite film. The onset (Eonset) and secondary electron cutoff (Ecutoff) curves of the perovskite active layer processed with and without an in situ polymerization strategy are displayed in Fig. S13,† and the corresponding calculated parameters are summarized in Table S2.† The work function (WF) (Fig. 4b) of the pristine film and the optimized sample is 4.38 and 4.29 eV, respectively. The decreased WF is ascribed to the surface dipole moments associated with electron donation from the TFEMA dimers to the perovskite.43 Furthermore, the obtained energy level alignment of the PSCs is schematized in Fig. 4c. It is evident that the crosslinked perovskite film manifests a better energetic alignment of the perovskite valence band maximum (VBM) with the highest occupied molecular orbital with respect to the hole transport layer, which is conducive to the hole extraction from the light absorbing layer to spiro-OMeTAD and minimizes the back transfer recombination loss.5,44 Additionally, the upshifted VBM of the optimized perovskite significantly hinders electron injection and extraction to Ag electrodes for promoting the charge separation to reduce the interface recombination.45

Fig. 5a compares the J–V characteristics of the planar PSCs processed with and without an in situ crosslinking strategy, and Table 1 also summarizes their corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The conventional CsFAMA-based solar cell produces a moderate PCE of 17.94% at reverse scan with a short current density (Jsc) of 22.65 mA cm−2, an open-voltage voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.734. Remarkably, the polymer-modified device increases all the photovoltaic parameters to obtain a Jsc of 23.16 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and an FF of 0.785, leading to an improved efficiency to 20.18% at a reverse scan. The prosperous photovoltaic performance of the optimized devices, as well as appreciable augmentation in Voc and FF, was derived from matched energy level alignment between the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD and repressed nonradiative recombination at the GBs and surface of the perovskite film with the polymerization of the TFEMA dimers.46,47 In addition, the crosslinked device exhibits a small hysteresis, which indicates a good passivation effect and efficient charge extraction with the aid of the TFEMA dimers. Fig. 5b displays the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum, and the corresponding photocurrent density is also gained from the spectrum. There are two IPCE curves with similar trends, where the integrated current densities from the IPCE spectrum are 23.03 mA cm−2 and 22.47 mA cm−2, agreeing closely with the Jsc values extracted from the J–V curves. The stabilized power out and Jsc are tracked at the maximum power point (Vm) (Fig. 5c). The stabilized PCE of about 19.84% is observed from the modified solar cell, substantially outperforming the 17.24% from the pristine device, which is in good accordance with the achieved performance from the J–V scans. Meanwhile, the averaged efficiencies show an exceeding enhancement from 17.26% for the pristine film to 20.07% for the integrated device, and almost all the optimized devices yield an exceptional efficiency higher than the maximum efficiency of the pristine PSCs (Fig. S14†), which validates the reproducibility and effectiveness of the in situ polymerization strategy. The detailed optoelectronic parameters are compared in Fig. S14, S15 and Table S3.† Furthermore, some recent authoritative reports of the PSCs assembled under open air conditions with different humidities are also summarized (Table S4†) to corroborate the potential advantages of the in situ crosslinking strategy.

In order to obtain a deeper understanding with respect to the recombination kinetics within the solar cell, the light-intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage and the dark current measurements are also characterized. Fig. 5d describes the voltage versus light intensity. The value of the computed slope is decreased from 2.78 kT/q to 2.39 kT/q, for the devices without and with an in situ polymerization strategy, indicating that the long-chain polymers can effectively suppress the trap-assisted recombination and energy loss under open-circuit conditions.48,49 Moreover, the suppressed charge-carrier recombination is also verified by the dark-current measurements (Fig. S16†). The dark-current density of the in situ polymerization strategy is lower than that of the pristine film, suggesting that more photocurrents will flow through the devices rather than directly shunting, resulting in effective suppression in charge-carrier recombination and leakage current.50,51 Furthermore, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model was also used to quantify the defect density and electron mobility of the perovskite films. Fig. 5e presents the SCLC curves of the electron-only transport layers with a device configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite (with and without an in situ polymerization strategy)/PCBM/Ag. The estimated trap-filled limit voltages (VTFL) by linear fitting of the I–V responses were used to calculate the defect densities (Ndefects) of 4.75 × 1015 cm−3 for the pristine film and 2.74 × 1015 cm−3 for the targeted device. The result indicates that the formed bulkier polymers can coordinate the defects distributed along the perovskite GBs and surface. Moreover, the charge mobility of the polymer-integrated device (2.13 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of the pristine film (6.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), originating from the increased grain size of the perovskite film with the crosslinking of the TFEMA dimers.52 To clearly elucidate the associated carrier transport and recombination resistance in the PSCs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization was implemented under dark conditions. Fig. 5f and Table S5† illustrate the characteristic Nyquist plots and fitting model of the solar cells. Both internal series resistance (Rs) and electron–hole recombination resistance (Rct) are related to losses from both bulk and interfacial recombination.53–55 Apparently, the polymer-optimized device possesses a lower Rs value and a higher Rct value, unveiling that a strengthened charge transfer and a mitigated electron–hole recombination are ascribed to the high performance of the perovskite film accompanied by the benign passivation effect of the TFEMA dimers.56,57 All of the aforementioned results underscore that the bulkier polymer additives distributed along the perovskite GBs or surface can inhibit the nonradiative recombination and regulate the crystal growth synchronously to boost the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite devices.
Besides the outstanding photovoltaic properties, the long-term stability is a critical parameter for the purpose of large-scale commercial applications of the PSCs.58 Remarkably, introducing an appropriate concentration of the TFEMA dimers in the device stack does not only optimize the film quality and the device performance, but also enhance the shelf stability. We discover that an unencapsulated solar cell containing the TFEMA dimers exhibits archetypically enhanced moisture stability as compared with the pristine solar cell exposed to air atmosphere under open-circuit conditions. As presented in Fig. 6a, the shelf stability of the PSCs with an in situ polymerization strategy is obviously augmented, maintaining 82.7% of its original PCE after 2400 h storage in an ambient environment without encapsulation, while merely 28.1% remains from the pristine devices during the same period. After 168 h of storage under 70 ± 5% humidity conditions, the perovskite films are characterized by XRD patterns, and, as shown in Fig. 6b, the peaks of the δ-phase perovskite and PbI2 can be detected in the pristine film, illustrating that the perovskite materials not only partially transform from α-phase to δ-phase perovskites, but also degrade to PbI2. Nevertheless, the δ-phase in the aged perovskite film processed with the TFEMA dimers is not identified. Furthermore, the peak intensity ratio of the diffraction peaks between PbI2 (001) and perovskite (100) is improved from 0.17 for the optimized sample to 2.07 for the pristine film. This significant discrepancy confirms that the hydrophobic capping layer generated by the fluorinated polymers acts as a robust shelter exceedingly helping to obstruct the penetration of water and moisture, which conspicuously delays the undesired phase transition of the CsFAMA-based perovskite from the α-phase to the inactive δ-phase (Fig. S18†).28

In addition to the enhanced moisture stability, the thermal stability of the solar cells processed with the TFEMA dimers is also appraised. As shown in Fig. 6c, the unencapsulated PSCs were annealed at a constant temperature at 85 °C, and the efficiency of the solar cells fabricated via an in situ crosslinking strategy remained at 85.5% of the original value for 300 h. However, the corresponding efficiency of the pristine device decreases to 47.1%. To further quantitatively analyze the thermal stability enhancement of the devices, the XRD spectra of aging for 168 h were recorded (Fig. 6d). After 168 h of continuous thermal annealing procedure, the PbI2 diffraction peak of the perovskite film treated with the TFEMA dimers is much lower than that of the pristine film. At the same time, the δ-phase perovskite was also observed in the pristine film, indicating that the thermal annealing process can trigger an irreversible change from the α-phase to the δ-phase perovskite. This is attributed to the heavy hydrogen bond and strong coordination bond interactions between the TFEMA dimers and perovskite crystals, which effectively reduce or alleviate an irreversible chemical transformation in the perovskite materials under thermal stress.39,40 The aforementioned results underline that when the in situ polymerization strategy was utilized to assemble well-defined CsFAMA-based perovskite structures, it is possible to simultaneously passivate the defects distributed along the perovskite GBs and surface, facilitate the charge transport and collection, suppress the interfacial nonradiative recombination, and enhance the moisture and thermal stability of the devices. This systematic effect not only results in PSCs with improved optoelectronic performance, but also enhances dramatically environmental and operational stability, highlighting the potential advantage of an in situ polymerization strategy to boost the overall photoelectronic properties of the PSCs.
In summary, we employ an in situ polymerization strategy to effectively enhance the photovoltaic properties and long-term stability of the PSCs. By incorporating crosslinked polymerizable TFEMA monomer units into the antisolvent, along with AIBN molecules as the initiator, and triggering an in situ crosslinking program during the films' thermal annealing treatment, the formed bulkier polymers adhere onto the perovskite GBs and surface. This unique distribution of the TFEMA dimers can simultaneously passivate the undercoordinated ions and suppress the perovskite decomposition via CO⋯Pb coordination bond and N–H⋯F hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and perovskites. Moreover, the device embeds in a functionality of the surface where the formed fiber-like areas act as a buffer layer inhibiting nonradiative recombination from modulating energy level alignment, in the perovskite and across the interfaces, and enhancing the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Relying on the aforesaid comprehensive effects, the targeted device fabricated under open air conditions exhibits a highest PCE of 20.18% and significantly enhanced moisture and thermal stability. This work provides a feasible design for developing bi-functional polymer molecules via an in situ polymerization strategy from the perspective of synchronous augmentation in efficiency and long-term stability.
