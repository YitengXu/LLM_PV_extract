    , Accepted 1st July 2020First published on 3rd July 2020AbstractThe combination of building blocks is very important when controlling molecular device performance. To study this issue, in this work, we designed and synthesized two wide band gap polymers (PBTz and PTzTz), which are composed of 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen and different combinations of two thiazoles, bithiazole (BTz) and thiazolothiazole (TzTz). Both polymers showed good thermal stabilities and good solubilities in chlorinated organic solvents. PTzTz exhibited a wider absorption spectrum and a redshifted maximum absorption wavelength compared to PBTz, while PTzTz showed a higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.42 eV compared to PBTz (−5.44 eV). When a non-fullerene (NF) electron acceptor (IT-4F) was used as the electron acceptor to fabricate polymer solar cells, the PBTz:IT-4F-based device showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.76%, while the PTzTz:IT-4F-based device showed a better PCE of 10.63%. BHJ morphology analysis confirmed that the PTzTz:IT-4F blend film had better phase-separation and charge transport compared to the PBTz:IT-4F blend film. This work implies that the TzTz unit is a better unit to make polymer donors for NF PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted particular attention in both the academic and industrial fields, due to their unique advantages of light-weight, flexibility, and roll-to-roll solution processing.1–6 At the early stage of PSC development, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) gradually improved due to the development of device structures, the optimization of BHJ morphologies, and the design of new polymer donors.7–12 Since the low bandgap (LBG) non-fullerene (NF) acceptors were reported by Zhan and his co-workers in 2015,13–16 the PCEs of PSCs have rapidly increased to 18.22% by the combination of wide bandgap (WBG) polymer donors and LBG NF acceptors.17–19 To obtain high PCEs, the photoactive layer of PSCs not only needs to have complementary absorption spectra and matched energy levels but also suitable intermolecular interactions between polymer donor and NF acceptor are required to form nanoscale bi-continuous phase separation.20–24 According to the previous literature, NF acceptors have anisotropic charge carrier transporting properties. It is difficult for them to create effective intermolecular interactions with polymer donors. To address this issue, the design of WBG polymer donors and the study of the relationship between structure and photovoltaic performance are of vital importance in promoting the development of PSCs.
To date, a lot of donor–acceptor (D–A) co-polymers have been reported and applied in PSCs,25–34 such as benzothiadiazole (BT), quinoxaline (QX), benzotriazole (BTA), benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD), carboxylated thiophene and carbonylated thiophene. Among these polymer donors, the electron-withdrawing units are essential to obtain the corresponding polymer donors with deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, which is beneficial to improving the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the resulting devices. Thiazole is also an electron-deficient unit due to the electron-withdrawing nitrogen of imine (CN). This moiety also shows a smaller steric hindrance with the neighboring units compared to that of thiophene due to the absence of one hydrogen atom. Thus, it is able to achieve strong π stacking and high charge carrier mobilities.35–38 However, the asymmetric skeleton of thiazole could form random co-polymers, which are not good for molecular stacking and charge transport. To overcome these disadvantages, thiazole is usually modified to bithiazole (BTz) and thiazolothiazole (TzTz) via different connections.39–47 Benefiting from these modifications, the BTz- and TzTz-based polymers showed strong intermolecular interactions and high hole mobilities. Note that only a few of the TzTz-based polymers were reported in NF PSCs.45,48–51 Considering that both units are very similar, it would be interesting to investigate their corresponding polymers for NF PSCs. It is also important to develop a new promising unit for high-performance PSCs.
In this work, we design and synthesize two WBG conjugated polymer donors, namely PBTz and PTzTz (Scheme 1), using 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen as the donor moiety and BTZ or TzTz as the acceptor unit. The thermal stabilities, absorption characteristics, energy levels, photovoltaic performances, and BHJ morphologies of both polymers were carefully studied. Both polymers showed excellent thermal stabilities above 420 °C, broad absorption spectra (300–650 nm), and deep HOMO levels (below −5.40 eV). After blending with a NF electron acceptor, namely IT-4F (Chart S1 in the ESI†), the PBTz-based device achieved a PCE of 8.76%, and the PTzTz-based device achieved a PCE of 10.63%.

Experimental section
Materials and instruments
All reagents were purchased from TCI Chemical and Sigma Aldrich. 3-(2-Butyloctyl)thiophene (1), 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiazole52 and (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) were synthesized based on the reported literature.53

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the compounds were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz with d-chloroform as the solvent (Fig. S1–S11, ESI†). Elemental analyses were carried out on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a thermal analysis system (New Castle, DE, USA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 protection. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation. CV measurements were performed in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 solution at ambient temperature under an inert argon atmosphere at room temperature. Ferrocene/ferrocenium was used as an external standard.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the thin film morphology were recorded using a Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN microscope. A Digital Instruments Nanoscope V AFM was used to record the in-air images of the device surface. Grazing Incidence Wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) by using a XEUSS SAXS/WASX system, Xenocs. A 10 keV X-ray incident beam was used at a grazing angle of 0.12–0.15° and selected to maximize the scattering intensity of the samples.
Device fabrication and characterization
All devices were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by using deionized water, acetone, and ethanol twice successively. After that, the substrates were dried at 150 °C for 10 min. Thin layers of PEDOT:PSS were spin-coated on them and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in the air. The active layers were dissolved in chlorobenzene with a total concentration of 10 mg mL−1, respectively. And then, 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added into the active layer solution. The final BHJ film thickness was controlled at about 100 nm by changing the speed of the spin coating. The active layers were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The device area was 0.04 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of both polymer-based devices were measured at 100 mW cm−2 of the standard AM 1.5G spectrum.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the two copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. Both polymers were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization between distannyl monomer 8 and dibromide monomers 4/7 using Ph(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. The synthetic details are described in Section 2.3. The two polymers have good solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene. Their molecular weights were determined by temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 120 °C using o-dichlorobenzene as an eluent and polystyrene standards as calibrants. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBTz and PTzTz is 24.9 and 21.9 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 2.5 and 2.7, respectively.
The thermal stability of both polymers was studied by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen, as shown in Fig. 1. The TGA measurement demonstrates that both polymers have good thermal stability with 5% weight loss of PBTz and PTzTz at 421 °C and 435 °C, respectively. When the temperature increases to 500 °C, the weight loss of both polymers is 56% and 54% for PBTz and PTzTz, respectively. These values are close to their weight ratios of the polymer side chains and polymer weights (55% for PBTz, and 54% for PTzTz), which implies that the side chains of both polymers could be first decomposed as the temperature increases.
 Fig. 1  TGA curves of PBTz and PTzTz. 
Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of both polymers were studied by using a UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer. Their absorption profiles were recorded in chlorobenzene solutions (Fig. 2a) and films (Fig. 2b). PBTz shows a maximum absorption wavelength at 506 nm with a weak shoulder peak at a long wavelength of 582 nm, and compared to PBTz, PTzTz shows a redshift of the two maximum absorption wavelengths to 540 nm and 583 nm. This suggests that PTzTz could have stronger intramolecular charge transportability than PBTz. In the films, both polymers have significantly broadened absorption spectra with redshifted absorption peaks at 520 nm for PBTz and 554 and 608 nm for PTzTz, suggesting that both polymers undergo stronger intermolecular interaction in films than in solutions. Their optical band gap (Eg) values were calculated based on the onset absorption in the films to be 1.91 and 1.90 eV for PBTz and PTzTz.
 Fig. 2  The absorption spectra of both polymers in chlorobenzene solution (a) and films (b). 
The electrochemical properties of both polymers were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry measurement (CV).54 The EFC/FC+1/2 is 0.40 eV in this experiment. The HOMO levels of the two polymers were estimated based on their oxidation potentials. The oxidation curves of the two polymers are shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding oxidation onset potentials are 1.04 and 1.02 eV for PBTz and PTzTz, respectively. The HOMO level was calculated as the equation of EHOMO = −(Eox − EFC/FC+1/2 +4.80) eV. Therefore, the HOMO levels of PBTz and PTzTz are −5.44 and −5.42 eV, respectively. These deep HOMO levels are beneficial for both polymers to obtain a high open-circuit voltage when they are applied in PSCs. Additionally, based on the equation of ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,55 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the two polymers were estimated to be −3.53 and −3.52 eV.

Theoretical calculations
To understand the electron properties and molecular geometries of the two polymers, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a B3LYP (d,p) basis set for the trimers of both polymers.56 In order to shorten the calculation time, we used the methyl group to replace their side chains. PBTz has the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −4.88 and −2.56 eV, respectively. PTzTz possesses the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −4.83 and 2.55 eV, respectively. These data show the same tendency. As displayed in Fig. 4, the trimer of PBTz has a bent conjugated backbone, whereas the trimer of PTzTz has a planar conjugated backbone. More planarity of PTzTz is better for molecular stacking and charge transport. Additionally, PTzTz has a more significant electron density distribution on the HOMO compared to PBTz, suggesting that PTzTz could be a better donor material.

Photovoltaic properties
We employed a NF acceptor of IT-4F to study the photovoltaic performance for both polymers.57 The device was fabricated based on the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. The weight ratio of polymer to IT-4F was 1:1, and we optimized the DIO ratios and annealing temperatures (Tables S1–S4, ESI†).
The J–V and characteristics are shown in Fig. 5, and the photovoltaic data are collected in Table 1. The photovoltaic devices based on PBTz:IT-4F showed the best PCE of 8.76%, with a VOC of 0.84 V, a short current density (JSC) of 17.68 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.59, while the devices based on PTzTz:IT-4F show a high PCE of 10.63%, with a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 18.81 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.69. The device of PBTz:IT-4F exhibited a higher VOC (0.84 V) than the device of PTzTz:IT-4F, which relates to the different HOMO levels of the two polymer donors, while the PBTz:IT-4F-based PSC has a lower JSC and FF than those of the PTzTz:IT-4F-based device, which could be attributed to the poor surface morphology and poor phase separation of the PBTz:IT-4F-based device. To confirm their JSC values, we carried out external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement. The integrated JSC values were calculated to be 16.94 and 17.98 mA cm−2 for the PBTz:IT-4F and PTzTz:IT-4F-based devices, respectively, which well fitted with the JSC acquired in the J–V measurements with below 5% mismatch.

The charge carrier mobilities of both blended films were measured by space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the PBTz:IT-4F film shows hole and electron mobilities of 1.50 × 10−6 and 2.91 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while, the PTzTz-IT-4F film shows higher hole and electron mobilities of 3.47 × 10−5 and 1.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher charge mobilities of PTzTz-IT-4F are in good agreement such that the PTzTz:IT-4F-based device had a higher JSC and FF compared to the PBTz:IT-4F-based device.

To make clear the different JSC and FF in both polymer-based devices, we first investigated the organization of both pure polymers and blend films by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, as seen in Fig. 6a. In the pure polymer films, PBTz shows weak (010) peaks in both the out of plane (OOP) and in plane (IP) directions with a π–π distance of 3.63 Å, while the PTzTz film shows a strong π–π stacking in the OOP direction with a small distance of 3.61 Å. This result implies that the PBTz film exhibits a mixed face-on and edge-on orientation, while PTzTz exhibits a face-on orientation. In the IP direction, both polymers show the (100) peaks at 0.26 and 0.31 Å−1, and at the same time, PTzTz also shows the (200) peak at 0.62 Å−1, implying that PTzTz has a highly ordered orientation. After blending with IT-4F, the PBTz:IT-4F film shows weak (010) peaks in both the IP and OOP directions, while PTzTz:IT-4F exhibits a face-on arrangement and gives a strong π–π stacking peak with a distance of 3.60 Å. This result implies that the PBTzTz:IT-4F film has a higher ordered microstructure, which is important to achieve exciton transport. It is due to this reason that the PTzTz:IT-4F film has a higher charge transport and FF in the resulting PSC devices. We also used atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements to study the BHJ morphology of the blend films. In Fig. S13 (ESI†), the AFM images show that the PTzTz:IT-4F film has good phase separation and a smoother morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.07 nm, while the PBTz:IT-4F film exhibits clear aggregation and a large RMS of 2.04 nm. The morphology was further investigated by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As can be seen in the TEM images in Fig. S14 (ESI†), a nanostructure was observed for PTzTz:IT-4F. The large aggregation sizes and no clear nanostructure in the active layer are not suitable for exciton dissociation and charge transport,58–60 thus PBTz:IT-4F has a poor JSC and FF. This is the reason that PBTz:IT-4F-based PSCs have low PCEs.

Conclusions
Two new wide band gap polymer donors, namely PBTz and PTzTz, were designed and synthesized by Stille polymerization. Both polymers only differed in the BTz and TzTz units. The two polymers showed good thermal stability above 420 °C, broad absorption spectra with a band gap around 1.9 eV, and deep HOMO energy levels (below −5.42 eV). The devices of PBTz:IT-4F and PTzTz:IT-4F showed good PCEs of 8.76% and 10.63%, respectively. After studying the BHJ morphology, we found that PBTz:IT-4F showed a strong aggregation ability, which can lead to larger aggregation sizes, thus leading to a low JSC and FF. This work demonstrated that the TzTz unit could be a more promising unit to construct high-performance wide band gap polymer donors for PSCs.
