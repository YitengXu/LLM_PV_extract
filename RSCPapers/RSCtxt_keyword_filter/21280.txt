    , Accepted 30th January 2023First published on 31st January 2023AbstractNb2O5 shows promising features for electron transport layers (ETL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as suitable band alignment and ultraviolet stability. Here, we studied the incorporation of Ti3C2Tx MXene in a solution-processable compact layer as a component of ETLs for PSCs. The addition of 0.4 wt% MXene with respect to niobium ethoxide was shown to enhance the PCE (19.46% for the champion device) and stability (96% of its original PCE after 500 hours) compared to pristine devices. The improved performance of the Nb2O5–Ti3C2 devices (0.4 wt%) could be attributed to the adapted alignment of the energy band between perovskite and ETL layers, which favors electron transport and extraction. In addition, the high electrical conductivity of MXenes worked as a free pathway for the extracted electrons preventing charge recombination. These features were corroborated by Photo-CELIV, which showed a higher density of extracted charges and increased charge carrier lifetime for Nb2O5–Ti3C2 based devices. Hence, the results unveiled in this work indicate that MXenes are promising 2D materials for tuning Nb2O5 based ETLs. Future works shall focus on other MXene compounds to further boost PSC performance and stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising emerging photovoltaic technologies for presenting a progressive increase in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) allied to low fabrication cost and easy processability.1,2 State-of-the-art PSCs typically possess the perovskite light-harvesting material sandwiched between selective electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs). These layers play a critical role in the collection and transport of photoinduced charges from perovskite to the electrodes. Crucial PSC parameters such as charge extraction and recombination processes are strongly influenced by the HTL/perovskite and ETL/perovskite interfaces. For example, their morphology is known to strongly affect the formation of perovskite films.3–5 In general, smoother surfaces result in a lower energy barrier for perovskite nucleation promoting a more uniform film with larger crystals.5 Likewise, HTL and ETL intrinsic defects such as grain boundaries and vacancies increase trap-assisted recombination.6 Thus, ETL and HTL materials ideally should have high charge conductivity and mobility, suitable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer, favorable morphology, good thermal and chemical stability, and low toxicity.7
Among several semiconductors, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most widely used materials for ETLs in PCSs because it shows favorable intrinsic electron extraction properties and a suitable wide band gap of ∼3.2 eV.8 However, TiO2 exhibits high photocatalytic activity under UV light due to light-induced desorption of oxygen species which may degrade the active layer.9 In addition, the resultant oxygen vacancies work as trapping sites for the injected electrons favoring charge recombination and hindering electron mobility.8,10,11
As an alternative, niobium oxide (Nb2O5) has been shown to be a promising ETL material presenting favorable energy band alignment with perovskite, while possessing improved chemical stability relative to TiO2.12 Despite these promising features, up to now, few works have explored the use of Nb2O5 as the ETL of PSCs.13–16 For instance, Ling et al.17 reported a PSC based on amorphous Nb2O5 processed by RF magnetron sputtering with a PCE of 17.1%. Likewise, Feng et al.15 obtained PSCs with a PCE as high as 18% using a compact Nb2O5 film fabricated by e-beam evaporation. Recently, Chavan et al.18 modified the surface of a mesoporous (m) TiO2 based ETL by growing an ultrathin layer of Nb2O5via atomic layer deposition. m-TiO2/Nb2O5 showed improved charge transfer with a perovskite resulting in enhanced Voc and PCE, as well as longer-term stability under UV soaking.18 Although they showed improvement in performance and stability, these aforementioned works involved the use of complex and high-cost techniques that may hinder Nb2O5 fabrication in large-scale. Other studies have developed Nb2O5 thin films using solution-processed approaches.10,19–21 Wang et al.,20 for example, obtained a colloidal solution of Nb2O5 nanoparticles for film deposition by using niobium chloride as the chemical precursor. By properly controlling the ETL thickness, better electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface was achieved, which resulted in lower recombination rates, and thus higher Voc of 1.19 eV and PCE surpassing 20%.20 In another approach, Shen et al.19 successfully obtained high-performance PSCs by using a Nb2O5 compact layer prepared from a niobium ethoxide precursor solution. Despite these recent advances, Nb2O5 still lacks the desired properties such as higher electron conductivity and mobility, compared to other semiconductors such as SnO2 and ZnO.22
An emerging class of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, has been studied due to their unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, high transmittance, high hydrophilicity and thermal stability.23–25 These features make MXenes an exceptional candidate for numerous areas including optoeletronics,25 energy storage26 and chemical sensing.27 MXene materials have a general chemical formula of Mn+1XnTx, where M corresponds to an early transition metal, X is related to nitrogen and/or carbon atoms, and Tx refers to the functional groups (such as OH, O, F) found on the edges and surface of the 2D structure. These materials are produced by selective etching of ternary carbides, the MAX phase (such as Ti3AlC2).28 During this process, the A-group elements are removed and functional groups are introduced in the structure. These functional groups shift the electrostatic potential at the surface and modify the electronic band structure according to their chemical concentration.29,30 Thus, the work function (WF) of MXenes can be tailored by modifying the type and concentration of these functional groups,31–33 making them promising for application in third-generation photovoltaic devices such as organic,34,35 perovskite33,36 and dye-sentitized37,38 solar cells.
In PSCs, MXenes have been recently incorporated as additives in ETLs of different oxides.36,39,40 Agresti et al41 showed the incorporation of Ti3C2 into compact and mesoporous TiO2 ETLs, which resulted in an improvement of 26% of PCE compared to pristine devices. Similarly, Ti3C2 was introduced into the hydrocolloid SnO2 solution for ETLs resulting in an improvement of 6.5% in the PCE, as reported by Yang et al.42 Also, Yang et al43 reported a PSC with a PCE of up to 23% and outstanding stability against humidity and light soaking after applying Ti3C2 quantum dots in a SnO2 based ETL. These works demonstrated that the improvement of efficiency was related to a superior charge transport path due to reduced trap density and/or a defect passivation at interfaces after addition of MXenes. Moreover, MXenes favored energy level alignment of the ETL with a perovskite resulting in higher charge carrier extraction and reduced recombination rate.41
To the best of our knowledge, the addition of Ti3C2 MXene to Nb2O5 ETLs has not been reported yet. In this context, we focus on the incorporation of Ti3C2 MXene into Nb2O5 compact films to apply as a component of ETLs in PSCs. Our results reveal that low concentration of Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) boosted the PCE values to 18.02 ± 0.43% (PCE of 19.46% for the champion device), values substantially higher than those obtained for the devices assembled with pristine Nb2O5 (PCE of 16.13 ± 0.43%). Such an enhancement of the PSC could be mainly attributed to the high electrical conductivity of MXenes, which acts as charge transfer paths and prevents their recombination at the perovskite/ETL interface. The Nb2O5–Ti3C2 interface also resulted in beneficial band-edge alignment, which favors carrier migration towards the ETL and mitigates electron recombination.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were purchased and used without further purification. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) was purchased from TCI Chemicals, while cesium iodide (CsI, 99.999%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.998%), niobium(V) ethoxide 99.95%, Spiro-OMeTAD (99.99%), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP, 98%), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonic)imide (Li-TFSI, 99.99%), anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB) and anhydrous acetonitrile were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.99%), formamidinium bromide (FABr, 99.99%) and TiO2 paste (30 NR-D) were acquired from Greatcell Solar. The FK209 (99.99%) was provided by Dyenamo. Anhydrous ethanol was supplied by Neon.
Synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene
The Ti3C2Tx MXene was obtained using the minimally intensive layer delamination (MILD) method.44 In this procedure, the MAX phase was exfoliated in a 12 M LiF/9 M HCl solution under continuous stirring for 24 h at room temperature. The solution was then washed with high purity water several times by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min until pH 5 was reached. The MXenes were vacuum-filtered using a PVDF filter (Millipore, 0.25 μm) and dried in a desiccator at room temperature.
Precursor solutions of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5/MXene
For compact ETL preparation, MXenes were firstly delaminated in 2 mL of ethanol via a bath-type sonicator for 20 min under N2 purging. Then, 25 μL of niobium ethoxide and 20 μL of hydrochloric acid (2 M) were added into the solution which remained under continuous stirring for 2 h at room temperature. Various Nb2O5/MXene precursor solutions were prepared by adding different amounts of Ti3C2Tx (0.4 and 0.8 by weight percent with respect to niobium ethoxide). For comparison, a pristine Nb2O5 precursor solution was prepared without the addition of MXenes.
Perovskite preparation
The double-cation mixed-halide perovskite solution was prepared according to methods previously reported.45 In this procedure, an iodide-based solution was obtained by dissolving PbI2 (1.2 M), CsI (0.2 M) and FAI (1 M) in a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of DMF:DMSO. Likewise, a bromide-based solution was prepared by dissolving PbBr2 (1.2 M) and FABr (1.2 M) in 4:1(v/v) DMF: DMSO. The two solutions were stirred overnight at 70 °C and then mixed to obtain a FAPbBr3:CsFAPbI3 (17:83% v/v) solution. Finally, the Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 precursor solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter before deposition.
Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) on glass (2.2 mm, 7 Ohm sq−1) was sequentially cleaned with Extran® (50% v/v in H2O), deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol for 15 min each in an ultrasound bath. After drying the substrates with N2, the Nb2O5 or Nb2O5/MXenes were spin-coated on them at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by pre-drying at 150 °C for 10 min. Then the mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on top of the Nb2O5 or Nb2O5/MXenes compact layers by spin-coating a TiO2 solution (150 mg mL−1 in ethanol) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The compact and mesoporous layers were thermally annealed at 550 °C for 60 min.
For perovskite deposition, the Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 precursor solution was spin-coated (1000 rpm/6 s and 6000 rpm/25 s) using CB as an anti-solvent after 20 s of the beginning of the spinning), followed by thermal annealing in 120 °C for 30 min on a hot-plate.
A hole transport layer consisting of Spiro-OMeTAD (0.06 M in CB) doped with TBP (stock solution), FK209 (0.23 M in acetonitrile) and Li-TFSI (1.82 M in acetonitrile) was spin-coated onto perovskite at 4000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, for the top electrode, an 80 nm Au layer was thermally evaporated.
Characterizations
Morphological analyses were performed using field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) images using a JEOL JSM-7500F microscope operated at 2 kV. The average grain sizes of the perovskite layer were calculated from the FEG-SEM images (50 k magnification) via ImageJ software. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were carried out using a Park Elmer NX12 in non-contact mode in a 5 μm × 5 μm area. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a Rigaku D/MAX-2100/PC diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation with λ = 1.54056 Å) with an angular range of 5 to 60° and an angular step of 0.02°. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron (UPS) spectroscopies were carried out using an Al-Kα X-ray excitation (hυ = 1486.6 eV) and a He–I gas discharge (hυ = 21.2 eV), respectively. The spectra were analysed using the CasaXPS software and Shirley algorithm for spectral background removal. For XPS, C1s carbon peak was collected at 284.6 ± 0.1 eV and used as a reference for energy calibration. UV–Vis spectra were acquired in the range from 800 to 200 nm using a Lambda 1050 Uv/Vis/Nir spectrometer from PerkinElmer. Current density–voltage curves of the PSCs were recorded on a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under simulated sunlight at AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a Newport (Class AAA, 94023A-U) solar simulator calibrated with a reference silicon cell. Stability tests were periodically performed in nonencapsulated devices storage in an inert atmosphere and ambient temperature. External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a PTS-2-QE Quantum Efficiency/IPCE System from Sciencetech. Charge extraction in linearly increased voltage (CELIV), photo-CELIV, and impedance spectroscopy (IS) were measured on a PAIOS system from Fluxin.
Results and discussion
Ti3C2Tx MXene was obtained by etching the Al layers from the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. S1 (ESI†) exhibits the XRD patterns of Ti3AlC2 before and after etching. The MAX phase shows the characteristic sharp peaks of the carbide crystalline structure,46 whereas the Ti3C2Tx diffractogram exhibits a loss of intensity, broadening and shifting to lower 2θ angles of its characteristic peaks such as (002), (004) and (008). Notably, the 2θ position of the (002) plane shifted from 9.76° (Ti3AlC2) to 5.56° (Ti3C2Tx) after acid etching. These features indicate an increase of the d-spacing due to the presence of functional groups –O, –OH, and –F among the layered structure.44,47 After sonication, the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets form stable dispersions in ethanol, which can be easily incorporated into sol–gel niobium ethoxide precursor solutions (Fig. 1).

Nb2O5 and Nb2O5–Ti3C2 were spin coated on FTO substrates and their morphological analyses are visualized in Fig. 2a–c. A closer inspection of SEM images (Fig. 2a–c) exhibits the presence of compact thin-films uniformly formed over the FTO grains. The presence of the Nb2O5 film was also confirmed by XRD analysis.

In (g): XRD patterns of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 and 0.8 wt%). 
The diffractogram shows the characteristic peaks of the pseudo-hexagonal Nb2O5 structure (JCPDS 28-0317) (Fig. 2g). However, due to the low concentration of Ti3C2Tx (up to 0.8 wt%) in the nanocomposites, there is no visible peak from MXenes in the diffractogram. Furthermore, the presence of MXenes apparently did not result in significant changes of the topographic characteristics of the Nb2O5 films which showed rough mean square roughnesses (RMS) in a range of 31–33 nm, as shown in the AFM analyses (Fig. S2, ESI†). This feature resulted in no morphological changes for the top layers deposited onto Nb2O5 films as verified by the SEM images of TiO2 and perovskite layers. Fig. S3a–c (ESI†) shows TiO2 films on top of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5–Ti3C2 with similar homogeneity. Similarly, the perovskite films grown on top of the ETLs were all pinhole-free with a smooth surface and large grain sizes of about 300 nm (Fig. 2d–f). Size distribution measurements (Fig. S4a–c, ESI†) of perovskite grains on top of ETLs do not indicate a significant difference in diameter from 296 ± 88 nm (Nb2O5) to 314 ± 89 nm (Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%)) and 291± 81 nm (Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.8 wt%)). These results may be attributed to a favored exfoliation of Ti3C2Tx in a few layers during the preparation of the niobium ethoxide precursor solution which resulted in no significant change in the morphology and structural features of Nb2O5.
To further investigate the effect of Ti3C2Tx on the properties of Nb2O5 films, XPS and UPS analyses were carried out. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Nb 3d core level of Nb2O5 films (Fig. 3a) displays the characteristic doublet peaks at 207.1 and 208.8 eV related to Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2, respectively.48 Interestingly, we find that incorporation of Ti3C2Tx into Nb2O5 results in slight shifts of Nb 3d peaks towards lower binding energies when compared to the corresponding values of pure Nb2O5. These shifts may indicate an increase in the density of the outer electron cloud of niobium atoms, as a likely result of the interaction between Nb2O5 and Ti3C2Tx. Similar behaviors have already been reported for other semiconductors in the presence of MXenes.49–52 The presence of Ti3C2Tx also resulted in changes in the energy levels of Nb2O5 films as indicated by UPS measurements (Fig. 3b and c). Fermi levels (EF) of the pristine Nb2O5 and Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) were obtained as −4.03 and −4.10 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b). The valence band energy levels were deduced as −7.59 eV (Nb2O5) and −7.75 eV (Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%)) with respect to the vacuum level (Fig. 3c). The conduction band (CB) of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) were then calculated as −4.19 and −4.35 eV, respectively, using the optical band gap (Eg) estimated by the Tauc plot (Fig. S5a and b, ESI†). The downward change in the CB energy level of Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) resulted in a greater potential difference from the CB level of TiO2, which may favor electron migration from perovskite/TiO2 and electron extraction to the FTO electrode.

Based on this premise, we fabricated PSCs with an architecture of FTO/ETLs/Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au to evaluate the potential of Ti3C2Tx in improving the device performance. Fig. 3d provides a schematic energy-level diagram containing each layer of the fabricated devices and Fig. 4a shows a scheme of the device architecture. The photovoltaic performance was evaluated by J–V curves under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 4b.

Table 1 and Fig. S6 (ESI†) summarizes the calculated functional parameters, such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE. The small standard deviation indicates a good reproducibility of the samples. These parameters show that a slight addition of Ti3C2Tx (0.4 wt%) results in an increase of Jsc from 22.41 ± 0.93 to 23.86 ± 0.49 mA cm−2, accompanied by an improvement of Voc and FF. These improvements contributed to increasing the PCE to 18.02 ± 0.4% (0.4 wt% of Ti3C2Tx) which is approximately 12.5% higher than the PCE of the ETL based on pristine Nb2O5 (16.13 ± 0.43%).

In addition, hysteresis of the reverse and forward scans of J–V curves is slightly reduced from 8.65% for the pristine N2O5-based device to 7.28% for that based on Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%). Fig. 4c exhibits the EQE spectra and their respective calculated integrated currents for Nb2O5 and Nb2O5–Ti3C2-based devices. The integrated current density increased from 20.71 (Nb2O5) to 21.45 (Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%)) and 21.59 mA cm−2 (Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.8 wt%)), which is in line with the Jsc values (Table 1) from the J–V curves.
The enhanced functional parameters of Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) can be attributed to the higher conductivity of the MXenes, which works in a free path for the electrons, giving rise to more efficient charge extraction. Besides, the improved Voc of Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) indicates a decreased non-radiative recombination of electrons. These features denote a better energy band alignment between the component layers due to the changed Fermi levels, as shown in the UPS measurements (Fig. 3b and c). On the other hand, further increase in Ti3C2Tx content (0.8 wt%) did not result in a significant improvement of functional parameters of the devices. This behavior can be credited to a likely agglomeration of the MXene layers, which negatively affects their beneficial properties. In addition, non-encapsulated Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) based devices exhibited improved stability compared to pristine PSC by withstanding 96% of its original PCE after 500 hours.
To obtain a deeper insight into the mechanism for the improved performance of the device, we carried out photogenerated charge carrier extraction using the linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) technique. For these measurements, a 20 μs light pulse illumination was applied to generate charge carriers in the PSCs. Shortly after illumination was turned off, charge extraction was performed by a negative voltage with different ramp rates. Charge mobility (μ) was calculated according to the eqn (1), proposed by Lorrmann et al:53 (1)where d is the device thickness, A corresponds to the applied voltage ramp, tmax refers to time at current maxima and ΔJ is the current increment from the dark-CELIV measurement (J0). Fig. 5a and Fig S7 (ESI†) show the typical ΔJ curves for all PSCs with the peaks position relating to the charge mobility. MXene-based devices showed maximal peak positions at increased time, indicating that a longer period was needed for maximum extraction of charge carriers. These results were confirmed by μ calculations (Fig. 5b). For example, at a voltage ramp of 25 k V s−1, Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) showed a slight reduction of charge carriers (1.05 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) when compared to the pristine device (1.75 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results were unexpected since the presence of Ti3C2Tx MXene showed an increase in the electron mobility of SnO2 and TiO2 based ETL layers.41,42 Charge mobility can be affected by several phenomena such as trapping and detrapping events associated with structural defects in the bulk and surface of the material films.54,55 As demonstrated in the morphological analyses (Fig. 2a–c), the presence of MXene did not mitigate the presence of pinholes on ETL compact films, which can partially explain the non-enhancement of charge mobility for the Nb2O5–Ti3C2 films. It worthwhile to mention though that due to device configuration, μ values cannot be distinguished between electron and hole charge carriers.56,57 On the other hand, a significant increase in the charge carrier extraction could be observed for the devices after introduction of MXenes. Charge carrier density (n) was obtained by integrating the photo-CELIV transients and is shown in Fig. 5b. The n values of Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) (8.4 × 1014 cm−3) was almost twice as large as that for the pristine Nb2O5 based device (4.6 × 1014 cm−3). The improved charge extraction can be credited to the increased electrical conductivity of the Nb2O5 films after the introduction of MXenes. For further investigation of this feature, electron only devices (FTO/Nb2O5/Au and FTO/Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%)/TiO2/Au) were fabricated and the ETLs electrical conductivities (σo) were calculated under dark-conditions from the I × V curves according to the following equation: I = σ0AD−1V(2)where A is the area of the sample (0.36 cm2) and D is the respective thickness of the samples. The I–V curves of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5-MXenes based devices clearly indicate the presence of an ohmic contact in the low bias voltage region (Fig. S8, ESI†). Here, the conductivity of the ETL containing Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) (3.24 × 10−5 S cm−1) is found to be higher than that of pristine Nb2O5 (2.5 × 10−5 S cm−1). Such an increase indicates that the higher presence of free electrons from MXenes improves the film conductivity that favors device electron extraction.

(c) Time-dependent charge carrier density; the lines are a guide for the eye. (d) Capacitance vs. frequency curves from IS measurements under light (72 mA cm−2) and short-circuit conditions. 
To study the impact of the electrical characteristics of the ETL on the charge recombination of the devices, a transient current from the photo-CELIV method was also obtained by varying the delay time after ceasing illumination (Fig. S9, ESI†). Transient curves of Nb2O5 and Nb2O5-MXene-based PSCs show that the extracted charge diminishes with an increase of the delay time. These features are associated with fewer photogenerated carriers which were collected after longer delay times due to charge recombination processes. The wider transient curves of Nb2O5-based devices indicate a more dispersive charge transport likely due to the presence of more defects or poorer alignment between device layers. In addition, unlike pristine PSC, transient currents of Nb2O5-MXene-based devices could be clearly noticed even for longer delay-times (100 μs) inferring slower recombination mechanisms. Fig. 5c displays the delay time-dependent carrier densities calculated from the integration of the transient current curves. The charge-carrier density decay curves could then be fitted with the exponential decay function:45,58 (3)where ni is the decay amplitude and τi is the decay time and B is a constant for the offset of the baseline. For the pristine sample, biexponential fitting could be observed, suggesting the presence of two distinguished groups of generated carriers which recombined independently (Table S1, ESI†). Indeed, two decay lifetimes in PSCs have been often reported in other recombination studies by transient photovoltage decay,59,60 time-resolved photoluminescence decay61–63 and photo-CELIV.45 It has been assumed that the faster decay component refers to nonradiative recombination at surfaces and interfaces between perovskite/charge transport layers, whereas the longer decay component reflects recombination processes within the bulk.62,64 It is worth mentioning that the Nb2O5 based device showed significant larger component for the fast decay (τ1 = 0.42 μs) implying a strong influence of the interface defects on recombination mechanisms of pristine samples. Interestingly, Nb2O5-MXenes-based PSCs could be better fitted by a single exponential function showing τ of 6.88 and 4.86 μs for PSCs containing 0.4 and 0.8 wt% of MXene, respectively. These results suggest that fewer mechanisms are involved in recombination processes for PSCs based on Nb2O5–Ti3C2.
As mentioned previously, several processes play a role in the charge recombination such as rapid and slow trap mediated recombination at perovskite and charge transport films as well as their interfaces, very likely via intraband localized states.65 A variety of defects in the perovskite film such as ion vacancies, surface pinholes or grain-boundaries may work as trap sites for charge carriers.66 The extent to which these trappings affect charge transport and extraction is strongly dependent on trap density.67 Our characterizations showed that the incorporation of MXene into the ETL layer did not result in significant morphological and structural changes on the perovskite film characteristics. These results suggest that the modified ETL characteristics should play a more decisive role in the recombination mitigation which may be related to (i) displacement of the ETL Fermi levels and (ii) increased conductivity of Nb2O5. For the former, changes in the LUMO level potential of Nb2O5 after introduction of Ti3C2Tx favored electron migration from TiO2 and their deployment to FTO, reducing then the probability of recombination. For the latter, the metallic characteristic of Ti3C2Tx provides a much higher density of carriers than the number of traps present in the sample. Thus, Nb2O5–Ti3C2 likely show fully populated traps having a negligible impact on electron extraction and transport. On the other hand, since pristine ETL exhibits a lower density of carriers, most of them are trapped and charge transport becomes governed mainly by hopping-like or multiple trap-detrapping processes affecting charge extraction.67 Similar passivation effects have previously been observed after introduction of Ti3C2Tx in other ETLs based on TiO241,68 and SnO2.69,70
To further investigate the recombination mechanisms, impedance response of the devices was measured under light at short circuit conditions, as shown by the capacitance–frequency (C–f) relation in Fig. 5d. At high frequency, a capacitive plateau in the range of 10−7 F cm−2 could be observed and is mainly associated with intrinsic dielectric relaxation of the bulk perovskite (Cbulk).71 All samples showed comparable Cbulk values indicating similar perovskite layer features in these devices. Moreover, an evident capacitance growth at low frequencies could be observed due to the characteristic double-ionic layer process and additional photogenerated carrier accumulation at the electrode interfaces.72 On the other hand, devices based on Nb2O5 and Nb2O5–Ti3C2 showed discrepant features at intermediate frequency (0.1–10 kHz). An inductive effect arises for the latter, which manifests itself as a kink point in the C–f plot. This behavior is commonly observed in high-performance devices as a consequence of the larger density of extracted photogenerated carriers.73 Meanwhile, the pristine Nb2O5 based device clearly exhibits an additional capacitive process which can be ascribed to the accumulation of photogenerated carriers at the perovskite/ETL interface.73 Thus, this increased charge accumulation has a negative impact on charge recombination and dramatically reduces the extracted photocurrent.
Conclusions
In summary, compact Nb2O5–Ti3C2 films were fabricated thanks to the easy incorporation of MXenes into the niobium precursor solution. These films were successfully combined to form a TiO2 mesoporous layer as ETLs of efficient and high-performance PSCs. Low concentration of Ti3C2Tx with respect to the niobium precursor resulted in increased Jsc of 23.86 ± 0.49 (Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%)) and 23.42 ± 0.72 mA cm−2 (Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.8 wt%)) when compared to pristine Nb2O5 devices (22.41 ± 0.93 mA cm−2). In addition to enhanced Jsc, Nb2O5–Ti3C2 (0.4 wt%) based devices showed improved Voc and FF, contributing to enhanced PCE of 18.02 ± 0.43% (PCE of 19.46% for the champion device), which is about 12.5% higher than the value reported for the devices assembled with pristine Nb2O5 (PCE of 16.13 ± 0.43%). The improvement of PSC features can be mainly attributed to the high electrical conductivity of Ti3C2Tx, which acts as a charge transfer path and prevents their recombination at the perovskite/ETL interface. As supported by UPS measurements, the Nb2O5–Ti3C2 interface can result in beneficial band-edge alignment, favoring carrier migration towards the ETL and reducing electron recombination. These features could be confirmed by photo-CELIV and IS characterizations which showed a higher density of extracted charges and increased electron lifetime for Nb2O5–Ti3C2 based devices. Future approaches shall focus on incorporation of different 2D structures of the MXene class of materials to further improve the performance of Nb2O5 based ETL features for photovoltaic applications.
