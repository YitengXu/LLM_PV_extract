    , Accepted 1st May 2017First published on 3rd May 2017AbstractLead iodide perovskite has long been considered to be promising for photovoltaic applications due to the high power conversion efficiency. However, the toxicity and instability of lead iodide perovskite limit its widespread use. Recently, germanium iodide perovskite CH3NH3GeI3 has attracted much attention due to the lead-free and high distorted structure. In this study, we exhibited a detailed theoretical investigation to predict total ferroelectric polarization of about 13.8 μC cm−2 and disentangle the contributions of MA cation (MA = CH3NH3), the center charge of MA cation and Ge2+ ion relative to the inorganic framework. Based on the electronic structure, optical absorption as well as carrier mobility of the system are further calculated, which exhibit strong anisotropy along the same direction. Further regulating atomic structure to strengthen or weaken the polarization, variable optical absorption spectra and hence tunable efficiencies are obtained. By analyzing the electronic structure with applied increased polarization, we conclude that polarization driven optical absorption can be attributed to an increased p–p orbital transition from I to Ge. In the case of CH3NH3GeI3, we discuss the relationship between ferroelectricity and photovoltaic performance, reveal the potential of utilizing polar material for higher solar conversion, and speculate that it is a general rule to raise the efficiency by enhancing the polarization.
Introduction
Over the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites have become a increasingly important for photovoltaic applications.1,2 Organometallic trihalide perovskites (OTPs) have attracted great interest due to their exceptional properties such as direct band gaps, large absorption coefficients,3 high carrier mobility4 and long electron–hole diffusion length.5 Moreover, the organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials are simple to synthesize and fabricate with low cost.6 To date, the PCE (power conversion efficiency) of the most tantalizing and representative perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 has reached a record of over 20% in the past few years;7,8 however, the traditional commercial Si-based solar cell reached the same efficiency of 20%,9,10 taking over thirty years. Hence, hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites are considered to be the most potential material as solar absorbers. In addition, the hybrid halide perovskite can be used for optoelectronic devices, such as photoelectric detectors and light emitting diodes, similar to the application of the transition metal sulfide11–15 as well as black phosphorus.16,17 Despite making important progress in the most important perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, we face new challenges where the instability of the device and toxic lead element are prone to limit its wide use. Thus, there is a necessity to seek lead-free and stable photovoltaic material as a substitute to achieve the same high efficiency as traditional CH3NH3PbI3 and Si compounds.
Germanium belongs to the same main group as lead in the periodic table, and the Ge-based perovskite is less toxic, which has attracted increasing attention. Now, electronic band structure, dielectric constant, deep electron traps and nonlinear optical coefficients of the inorganic Ge-based perovskite such as CsGeI3 or RbGeI3 have been investigated.18–21 For the inorganic–organic hybrid compounds, the theoretical predicted power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Ge-based perovskites22,23 is close to that of Pb-based perovskites and is slightly higher than that of Sn perovskites.24–26 In addition, the electronic structure of Ge-based perovskite MAGeCl3 has been investigated, exhibiting low effective masses.27 Furthermore, the electronic structures of organic Ge-based perovskite AGeX3 (A = FA, MA MO, GA) have also been investigated. However, compared to the inorganic Ge-based perovskite, the investigations of organic Ge-based perovskite are still relatively scarce.28,29 Experimentally, some literature30,31 has reported the synthesis of CH3NH3GeI3 recently, discovering highly distorted GeI6− framework, but the experimental investigation30 shows that CH3NH3GeI3 is not very stable and exhibits poor performance as a solar absorber. These results contradict the theoretical conversion efficiency22 by about 13% according to the Shockley–Queisser limits.32 Due to the contradiction, the carrier mobility and optical performance of CH3NH3GeI3 should be further investigated as the power conversion efficiency is mainly associated with the carrier mobility and light absorption. In addition, strong ferroelectric polarization could originate from the highly distorted structure of GeI6−, but there still is a lack of investigation on the ferroelectrics of CH3NH3GeI3. Currently, there are various ref. 33–38 related to the polarization of evaluation of perovskites, particularly the complex perovskites such as the semiconductors [NH4][Cd(HCOO)(3)] and [(CH3)(4)N][Mn(N-3)(3)].39–42 Investigations43,44 of ferroelectric materials concerning the hybrid halide perovskites mainly concentrate on the Pb-based and Sn-based perovskites, and the outcomes show that the MAPbI3 and FASnI3 both exhibit weak polarization.45 Therefore, the impact of ferroelectric polarization on the solar energy conversion is hard to discuss due to the weak ferroelectricity. Compared to the most important perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, the new CH3NH3GeI3 may bring hope to display strong ferroelectricity owing to the largest size mismatch between Ge2+ ions and I− ions, and the ferroelectric polarization may play an important role in improving the performance. For example, recent lab studies show that an incident photon can still be absorbed while incident photon energy is hν < Eg (Eg refer to the band gap),30,31 where the photoelectrons are under forbidden transition in general. The unusual phenomenon still lacks rational explanation, which may concern the ferroelectric polarization. In addition, carrier mobility and optical adsorption coefficient anisotropy as well as the relation with ferroelectric polarization have not ever been established. In conclusion, this newly synthetic material attracted our attention and urged us to systematically investigate its ferroelectric polarization, carrier mobility, optical absorption as well as the impact of ferroelectricity on the photovoltaic performance.
In this study, we first calculated the geometrical structure of CH3NH3GeI3. Ferroelectric polarizations of CH3NH3GeI3 along three directions are predicted. The contributions to polarization of the MA cation, center charge of the MA cation and Ge2+ ion related to the I− ion are discussed in detail. The carrier mobility and light adsorption coefficients in a(x), b(y) and c(z) axes are together investigated based on the electronic structure. Second, we discuss the anisotropy of light adsorption, carrier mobility as well as ferroelectric polarization and further try to establish the relationship between ferroelectric polarization and incident photon conversion efficiency as the material exhibits high carrier mobility, absorption performance and ferroelectric property in the same direction. Third, we further describe how regulating Ge2+ ion displacement and H3C–NH3+ turning direction to tune ferroelectric polarization intensity results in the adjustment of light adsorption spectrum. Finally, based on the calculated electronic structure under the modulated ferroelectric field, we hope to confirm the physical mechanism of the ferroelectric polarization driven incident photon conversion efficiency. We also speculate that ferroelectric polarization driven incident photon conversion efficiency is a general phenomenon for all ferroelectric photovoltaic materials.
Results
Highly distorted geometry of bulk MAGeI3

Fig. 1(a) illustrates the schematic of CH3NH3GeI3 for photovoltaic application with photoenergy and built-in ferroelectric polarization. We begin by considering the experimental structure of MAGeI3 with the space group Cmm2. The lattice constants are a = b = 8.55 Å and c = 11.16 Å31 (for detailed atomic coordinates, see ESI†). All the C–N bonds are polar molecules, parallel to the c axis. Compared to the centric PbI6− framework in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 shown in Fig. 1(b), the GeI6− framework shown in Fig. 1(c) maintains a highly noncentric symmetry. The calculated short and long I–Pb–I bond lengths in the PbI3 framework are about 3.19 Å and 3.31 Å, respectively, whereas those of perovskite CH3NH3GeI3 are about 2.77 Å and 3.45 Å. The results show that CH3NH3GeI3 exhibits more significant discrepancy between short and long bond lengths. Furthermore, the calculated I–Ge–I bond angle in perovskite CH3NH3GeI3 along the equatorial and apical directions is about 167.6 degrees with broken lines, and the I–Pb–I bond angle in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is about 179.9 degrees, with nearly straight lines. These calculated results demonstrate that the GeI6− polyhedron is highly distorted, corresponding to the early experimental prediction46 that symmetric X–B–X will deform to asymmetric a X–B–X bond, and each regular BX6− octahedron will tend to deform a distorted octahedron with a decrease in the atomic number (from Pb to Sn to Ge). Table 1 lists the optimized structural bond lengths and bond angles in perovskite CH3NH3GeI3 as well as CH3NH3PbI3. As is well-known, built-in ferroelectric polarization can be induced by the distorted structure; thus we will discuss the ferroelectric polarization of the material in detail.

Analysis of the ferroelectric polarization
Three primitive cells equivalently constitute one unit cell. We chose one primitive cell to study its ferroelectric (FE) polarization due to the periodicity. In the primitive cell of the GeI3− framework, the distance between the equivalent negative charge center of I− ions and Ge2+ ions is 0.467 Å, parallel to the c axis. The displacement between the positive charge center of MA+ and the negative charge center of I− ions is 0.301 Å, also parallel to the c axis. Therefore, the ferroelectric (FE) polarization includes three parts: ionic displacement polarization PMA–I induced by the positive charge center of MA+ relative to the negative charge center of the GeI6− octahedron, ionic displacement polarization PGe–I induced by off-center displacement of Ge2+ ion in the cage of GeI6− and the turning direction polarization PMA of H3C–NH3+. It is difficult to evaluate the polarization of the simple primitive cell according to the modern theory of polarization.47,48 In order to eliminate the effects of polarization quanta, a reference antiferroelectric structure (AFE) should be introduced to construct continuous ranges of paths from the FE structure to the AFE structure. By moving the equivalent charge center of Ge2+ ions and MA+ to high symmetrical position to make PGe–I and PMA–I equal to zero, we construct a reference antiferroelectric polarization (AFE) structure with all MA cations in parallel orientation and ferroelectric polarization (FE) with MA cations in antiparallel directions (see Fig. 2a and b). Therefore, the rotational path is constructed to predict the polarization contributed from the turning direction polarization PMA. From the high symmetrical reference structure, we consider the path by rotating every C–N bond 10° from θ = 0° to θ = 180° within the bc plane shown in Fig. 2(a). By rotating C–N bonds at an angle of 180°, the polarization Pc along the c axis increases to 3.86 μC cm−2, implying that C–N monopole points to the c axis, which corresponds to other literature reports that state that the positive charge center of the MA cation is localized on the NH3 group, and the electric dipole of the MA cation is oriented from carbon to the nitrogen atom. The continuous variation of the polarization curve eliminates the spurious influence of polarization quanta. Along the b axis, the polarization Pb can be expressed as Pb = P0sinθ. When changes the C–N bonds from parallel to the c axis to parallel to the b axis by rotating the θ at an angle of 90°. Within the margin of error, the following relationship can be obtained: Pc(θ = 180°) = 2 × Pb(θ = 90°). The deviation mainly originates from the change of the charge center position of the MA cation relative to the negative charge center of the GeI6−, resulting in ΔPMA–I ≠ 0 while rotating the C–N bonds. It should be pointed out that the calculated unit cell contains three C–N bonds; hence the PMA = 3 × Pb = 6.6 μC cm−2, antiparallel to the c axis.

(c) Electric dipole associated with the MA cation along the a, b, and c axes in perovskite MAGeI3. 
We continue to analyze the dipole moment of PMA–I derived from the relative geometric displacement, r, between the negative charge of the framework GeI6− and the positive charge of monopole terms of the MA cations. The calculated displacement, r, is 0.31 Å, and the MA cation and the framework GeI6− carry a positive +e and negative charge −e, respectively. Therefore the polarization PMA–I can be expressed as PMA–I = . Herein, the hypothetical charge center of the MA cation is settled at 0.42 Å from the N atom along the CN bond according to other literature. We first place the center of the negative charge of the MA cation at the ideal high symmetrical position to make the r equal to zero. Then, we move the C–N bonds along the c axis. The movement of the MA cation makes the positive charge center translate along the c axis and induces the ionic displacement polarization. The results are shown in Fig. 3a. The polarization changes with the displacement r linearly. While moving the MA cation 0.31 Å along the c axis, the variation polarization equals 0.8 μC cm−2. As our calculated primitive cell contains three unit cells, the ionic displacement polarization , parallel to the c axis. Similarly, we adopt the same approaches to predict the polarization PGe–I induced by the relative displacement r of opposite charge of the Ge2+ ions and I− ions. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 3b. The variation polarization is P = 6 μC cm−2 while moving the Ge2+ ions at 0.406 Å along the c axis from the relatively high symmetric paraelectric to the ferroelectric phase. Thus, the ionic displacement polarization of PGe–I = 3 × 6 μC cm−2 = 18 μC cm−2 is also due to the three primitive cells included in one unit cell. In conclusion, Ptotal = PGe–I + PMA–I + PMA = 18 + 2.4 + (−6.6) μC cm−2 = 13.8 μC cm−2, parallel to the c axis. When considering the total energy indicated by blue lines as the function of MA cation displacement and Ge2+ ion displacement, the minimum energy value appears for the displacement of 0.3 Å and 0.4 Å, which is just right for the optimized position of CH3NH3GeI3. Herein, we can draw conclusions that MAGeI3 indeed exhibits stronger ferroelectric polarization compared with MAPbI3, which mainly originates from the highly distorted GeI6− framework. The above calculated polarizations using the Berry phase method also correspond to the results using the point charge model method (see ESI†).

Optical absorption spectra

Fig. 4a and b present the calculated band structure and density of states (DOS), respectively. The calculated band gap (1.7 eV) by HSE06 method with red lines is closer to the experimental value of 1.9 eV31 than the results of 1.17 eV using standard DFT with blue lines. Carrier effective masses are fitted along the G–Z, Z–X and Y–Z directions, which represent [0 0 1], [0 1 0] and [1 0 0] directions based on the band structure, respectively. Fig. 2b shows the total density of states (TDOS) as well as partial density of states (PDOS) in perovskite CH3NH3GeI3. The calculated PDOS of CH3NH3GeI3 provides further insight into electronic properties. The results illustrate that the upper valence band is mostly composed of I p orbitals, along with a few s orbitals of Ge, whereas the conduction bands are mostly occupied by the Ge p orbitals, along with a few s and p orbitals of I atoms. Hence, the strong light absorption is mainly due to the transition from I p orbitals to Ge p orbitals. In other words, p orbitals of Ge and I play vital roles in light harvesting. It is noted that the organic cation CH3NH3+ has almost no contribution to the electronic properties near the Fermi level, but the direction of MA+ determines the orientation of molecular dipole ferroelectric polarization. What needs to be emphasized is that if we tune the orientation of the ferroelectric polarization by regulating the direction of the H3C–NH3+ dipole moment to adjust light adsorption, the band edge at 1.7 eV will not narrow or broaden, which is what is required. Thus, the effect of a single variable on optical absorption with tuning built-in ferroelectric polarization can be investigated solely. For other materials, tuning built-in ferroelectric polarization by changing the atom displacement or turning direction often initiates changes of band gap; therefore, it is difficult to judge how ferroelectric property affects photoelectric performance. However, in this system, these sole regulations will contribute to establishing the association of ferroelectric polarization with photoelectric conversion efficiency intuitively.

Carrier mobility
In order to discuss the relationship between ferroelectric polarization and incident photon conversion efficiency, we further calculated light adsorption coefficients in the visible spectrum. Averaged optical absorption coefficients as well as optical performance in a(x), b(y) and c(z) axes were calculated according to eqn (1). Fig. 5 shows that CH3NH3GeI3 exhibits strong optical absorption coefficients with the magnitude of 105 cm−1, approaching the optical property of CH3NH3PbI3. In addition to this, compared with light adsorption coefficients in a(x) and b(y) axes, the absorption coefficients of this system along the c(z) direction are much stronger in the most visible spectrum region, particularly in the range of 2.2–2.7 eV. The absorption coefficients in a(x) and b(y) axes nearly coincide, demonstrating relatively weaker absorption to sun light. These results reveal a strong linear dichroism in the c(z) direction, corresponding with the ferroelectric polarization direction also on the c axis. It is worth noting that the system still exhibits a considerable absorption peak in the range of 1.6–1.7 eV along the c(z) direction, where the optical absorption peak evidently has a lower band gap of 1.7 eV, corresponding to recent experimental results where considerable incident photoconversion efficiency of CH3NH3GeI3 in the red-infrared spectrum below the band gap can still be detected. According to the photovoltaic effect principle, incident light energy below the band gap of photovoltaic materials can hardly generate a photocurrent. Herein, we speculate that the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization generates an internal electric field in the c(z) direction to provide an electric field force to offset weak photon energy.

According to eqn (2) and (3), we calculated the effective masses as well as carrier mobility of CH3NH3GeI3 as the carrier mobility governed the migration length of the electron–hole to a large extent. Table 2 lists the calculated carrier mobility, together with effective masses, deformation potential and elastic constants (the detailed calculations are shown in the ESI†). The calculated electron and hole mobility in a(x), b(y) and c(z) axes are severely anisotropic. The system demonstrates a rather high carrier mobility 1.115 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 0.414 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes on the c(z) axis, close to those of transitional Si profiles49 with 1.35 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.48 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and holes, respectively. Herein, CH3NH3GeI3 presented excellent transport property on the c(z) axis, which also corresponds with the ferroelectric polarization direction. We speculate that strong anisotropy of optical absorption and carrier mobility is closely associated with anisotropy of ferroelectric polarization.

Utilizing polarization to tune light absorption
In this section, we try to control ferroelectric polarization of CH3NH3GeI3 to tune the light absorption to further verify the abovementioned speculation. As ferroelectric polarization of CH3NH3GeI3 mainly originates from ionic displacement polarization of PGe–I according to the above analysis, we first considered eliminating ionic displacement polarization of PGe–I by moving Ge2+ ion to an equivalent position shown in Fig. 4(b). The ferroelectric polarization contributed from off-center displacement of Ge, PGe–I, calculated with 17.1 μC cm−2 along the c(z) direction was dispelled by moving the Ge ions and decreasing the total ferroelectric polarization Ptotal along the c axis from 12.9 μC cm−2 to −4.2 μC cm−2. Fig. 6(c) demonstrates the optical absorption of incident light on the a(x), b(y) and c(z) axes, while eliminating the ionic displacement ferroelectric polarization PGe–I along the c axis. We can see that incident light absorption coefficients along the c(z) axis significantly decrease and nearly coincide with those on the a(x) and b(y) axes. Moreover, the absorption peak below the band gap also disappears when ferroelectric polarization is tuned to decrease. The calculated results also strongly suggest that the anisotropy of light adsorption is associated with the ferroelectric polarization direction.

(c and d) Optical absorption spectra while tuning the direction of C–N dipole moment and displacement of Ge ion, respectively. 
In addition, we ulteriorly tried to adjust all H3C–NH3+ dipole moments parallel to the c axis to tune the light adsorption coefficients shown in Fig. 6(a). Total ferroelectric polarization Ptotal projected onto c(z) axis increases 10.98 μC cm−2 by adjusting the orientation of all H3C–NH3+ dipoles from antiparallel to the c(z) axis to parallel to c(z) axis artificially. Therefore, the turning direction polarization of H3C–NH3+ dipoles PMA contributes to the total ferroelectric polarization and can be also calculated as follows: , almost in accordance with the above results PMA = 6.6 μC cm−2. Fig. 6(d) demonstrates that light absorption coefficients indicated by red lines are effectively improved while strengthening ferroelectric polarization by tuning orientation of all H3C–NH3+ dipoles parallel to c(z) compared with that of the H3C–NH3+ dipole antiparallel to the c(z) direction. Herein, the calculated results provide further evidence that improving ferroelectric polarization can effectively drive optical absorption.

Fig. 7 presents the density of states indicated by the red area, where H3C–NH3+ is antiparallel to the c(z) direction in the initial structure compared with those indicated by the black area where C–N dipoles were tuned to be parallel to the c(z) direction. We can clearly see that the density of Ge p orbitals at CBM significantly increased, whereas the density of I p orbitals at VBM evidently decreased by turning the direction of C–N dipoles parallel to the c(z) axis to reinforce the ferroelectricity. The results are further attributed to the phenomenon of ferroelectric polarization driven incident light conversion efficiency to the enhanced p–p transition near the band edge.

Conclusion
In summary, we carried out theoretical calculations to investigate geometric structure, electronic properties, band alignments as well as ferroelectrics of the lead-free perovskite CH3NH3GeI3. We found that CH3NH3GeI3 exhibits strong ferroelectric polarization at about 13.8 μC cm−2 mainly due to the distorted framework of GeI6− on the c axis. The system is mainly electron-dominated and demonstrates high absorption and transport anisotropy. Along the c(z) direction, the material exhibits stronger light absorption and higher carrier mobility with 1.115 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 0.414 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes. We speculate that the ferroelectric polarization is related to the high anisotropy of the absorption and carrier mobility. It should be pointed out that the theoretical absorption spectra of CH3NH3GeI3 show an evident photon absorption peak below the band gap, corresponding to the experiments where the incident photon to conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the CH3NH3GeI3 can still be detected. We believe that the high ferroelectric polarization provides extra energy and promotes photon transition. Moreover, by tuning the ferroelectric polarization, we can effectively improve the light absorption. We ascribe the ferroelectric driven optical absorption to the increased p–p orbital transition. We speculate that these are general rules to drive higher incident photon conversion efficiency with stronger ferroelectric polarization for photovoltaic application. In conclusion, our findings forecast the high ferroelectric polarization in perovskite CH3NH3GeI3 and reveal the potential relationship between power conversion efficiency and polarization. These results may open up a new way to enhance the efficiency for photovoltaic performance by utilizing the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization in future.
Methods
DFT calculation
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the electronic structure using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package (VASP)50,51 with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)52 parametrized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange–correlation potential and projector augmented wave (PAW) method53 for describing electron–ion interactions. Electronic orbitals 3d4s4p, 5s5p, 2s2p, 2s2p and 1s for Ge, I, C, N and H atoms in valence were considered, respectively. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis was set to 450 eV for all calculation. The 4 × 4 × 3 k-meshes were adopted to optimize atomic structure and calculate electronic structure. Hybrid functional (HSE06) methods54 were considered to calculate band structures and optical absorption spectrum along with van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) theory55 because standard DFT overestimated the electron delocalization effect and underestimated the band gaps. High symmetric G(0 0 0)–Z(0 0 1/2)–X(0 1/2 1/2)–Y(1/2 0 1/2)–Z(0 0 1/2) are sampled in the first Brillouin zone for the band structure calculation. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects are not considered here as the correlations have almost no contribution to the band edge (for detailed statement, see ESI†).
Absorption spectra calculation
Based on the calculated electronic structures from HSE06 results, we employed much denser 6 × 6 × 4 k-meshes to obtain the dielectric function. Absorption spectra were calculated from the dielectric function as below: (1)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function depending on the light frequency ω, and α is the absorption coefficient. As ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are tensors, the absorption spectra along three directions α(x), α(y) and α(z) can be obtained separately to investigate incident light absorption anisotropy.
Carrier mobility calculation
The electron–hole effective masses along G(0 0 0)–Z(0 0 1/2), Z(0 0 1/2)–X(0 1/2 1/2) and Y(1/2 0 1/2)–Z(0 0 1/2) directions can be calculated by fitting the band edge according to the following equation: (2)
For 3D materials, the transport properties can be evaluated using a simple approach based on the deformation potential theory56–59 by the expression (3)where the term E1 is the deformation potential constant of the valence-band minimum for holes or conduction-band maximum for electrons along the transport direction, which is defined as the energy shift of the band energy position (ΔE) with respect to a small lattice dilation (Δl) along a lattice (l0) direction; i.e., ħ is the reduced Planck constant, e is the element charge, Cii is the elastic matrix constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is set to be room temperature (T = 300 K). The m* represents the electron and hole effective mass along different directions.
Ferroelectric polarization
Ferroelectric polarization is calculated via the Berry phase method60,61 by constructing a specific structural pathway parameterized by the changes in displacement of Ge2+ and MA+ as well as the changes of the angles θ of C–N bonds connecting a relatively high centrosymmetric reference structure to a ferroelectric structure. The total polarization can be expressed as the sum of the ionic and electronic components: ΔP = ΔPionic + ΔPelectronic(4)
