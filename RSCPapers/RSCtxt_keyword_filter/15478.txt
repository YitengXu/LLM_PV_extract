    , Accepted 30th November 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractAlkylthienyl decorated two-dimensional (2D) conjugated electron-donating (D) units such as 4,8-bis(2-alkylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene have been widely used for designing highly efficient photovoltaic materials. However, the thienyl side chains are less involved in the backbone frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). In this study, we replaced the side-chains from tri(n-propyl)silylthienyl to tri(n-propyl)silylethynyl and reported two alkynyl-decorated 2D conjugated narrow-bandgap (∼1.4 eV) nonfullerene acceptors, named ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl. In a striking contrast to the thienyl-linked counterpart, the ethynyl unit was significantly involved in the backbone FMOs of the new acceptor molecules, enhancing its absorptivity and reducing the energy levels. With PM6 as the donor polymer, 12.5% and 12.1% efficiencies were obtained for the acceptors. The VOC values were as high as 0.87 – 0.88 V. The tetrachlorinated acceptor supplied a larger fill factor (67.9% vs. 62.2%) with a smaller short-circuit current-density (22.8 vs. 20.5 mA cm−2) than the tetrafluorinated counterpart. When introduced as acceptor guests of PM6:Y6, 16.1% and 15.9% efficiencies were achieved. These results demonstrate that the trialkylsilylalkynyl units can be potential side-chain candidates for designing highly efficient acceptor materials.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), as a promising technology for converting solar energy into electrical power, have attracted growing interest owing to their excellent properties such as light-weight, low-cost, semitransparency, mechanical flexibility, solution-processing and roll-to-roll fabrication.1–10 Due to the recent advances in research on PSCs, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 17–18% in single-junction solar cells have been realized. Moreover, the application of molecular designing on the acceptor11–13 and polymer donor14–16 materials and device engineering17,18 majorly contribute to the great achievements in this field. For example, the research on PSCs has reached a new stage with the emergence of new type nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) like ITIC19 and Y6,20 owing to their great advantages such as strong light response in the near-infrared (NIR) region, easy tuning on optical absorption, and simple adjustment of energy levels and bandgaps, relative to their fullerene counterparts.21,22 Structural modifications on NFAs can also be done on the electron-donating central core, electron-accepting end-groups, and side-chains. The side chains often have impacts on the solubility and crystallinity,23 and on film morphologies and light absorption in some cases as well; the modifications on end groups can adjust the energy levels and optical bandgaps, for example, the introduction of halogen atoms (F, Cl or Br) into end-groups can downshift the energy levels24 and narrow the bandgaps;25–27 the decorations on central core structures can significantly modulate energy levels and bandgaps, thus boosting solar cell efficiencies to various degrees.28–30
Again, based on the optimized binary PSCs, the ternary strategy of employing an appropriate third component is another promising method to boost the device efficacy.31–36 First, the photocurrent can be increased by using two absorption-complementary molecules (between donor and acceptor or two donors/acceptors)37–39 as one of the ternary strategies. The use of solar photons absorbed by the third component, such as via the energy transfer channel40,41 in combination with the improvement in film-morphology, can lead to simultaneous enhancement of short-circuit current-density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) or open-circuit voltage (VOC). Second, the third component can be a morphology regulator,42–45 which is beneficial to forming optimized morphology, reducing the charge recombination and achieving a balanced charge transport;32,33 thus, an increased efficiency can be obtained with improvements in FF and JSC46 through the absorption of the third component, which is not complementary to that of the host. Third, recent reports have indicated that the introduction of a higher-LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) nonfullerene acceptor guest as the third component can be an alternative ternary strategy to achieve simultaneously increased VOC and FF47–49 and even JSC when using PCBM as the acceptor guest.50,51 Alloy- or parallel-like mechanisms relative to boosting solar cell performance via ternary strategies have also been proposed. The alloy-like model is proposed when a small-molecule donor or acceptor guest that is structurally similar to the host component is introduced.52–56 The use of the structurally similar third component generally associates with the interests of obtaining increased mobilities,57 enhanced absorption,58 tunable energy levels,59,60 as well as an increased device stability and good thickness tolerance.58,61,62 In addition, the parallel-like mechanism also occurs in ternary devices such as the use of two polymer donors as the ternary strategy. The third component forms individual phases that act as additional charge transfer centres or additional paths for current generation or charge transport,63 in combination with realizing minimized energy loss,64 suppressed recombination,65 and suitable phase separation domain66 in most cases. Therefore, designing donor/acceptor guests that enable improvements in absorption, energy level alignments and film-morphology after being introduced into a host binary system have the potential to improve device performance.
One of the successful side chain engineering approaches is to introduce 2-alkylthienyl onto 4,8-positions of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), forming the so-called 2-dimensional (2D) conjugated structure.67 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results have clearly demonstrated that the 4,8-dithienyls are less involved in either the LUMO or the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the NFA backbones. This means that the π-electrons of the 4,8-dithiophene are less conjugated with the π-electrons of the NFA backbone. Previously, we reported the first NFA (IN-4F)68 bearing silyl side chains by the combination of side chain modifications (on the BDT 4,8-positions) and backbone extension (with fusion of BDT with thienothiophene). In this paper, we replaced the tri(n-propyl)silylthienyl with tri(n-propyl)silylethynyl and synthesized two new 2D conjugated NFAs, named ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl (Fig. 1). DFT calculations clearly indicate the significance of including ethynyl with the backbone LUMO and HOMO, demonstrating a good conjugation between the π-electrons of ethynyl and the fused BDT. As a result, enhanced absorptivity and downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels were observed in the tetrafluorinated ISI-4F in comparison to IN-4F. We also synthesized the tetrachlorinated ISI-4Cl to compare the effect of the end group halogenations on the optical, electrochemical, electrical and photovoltaic properties. The binary solar cells with PM6 as the donor polymer supplied 12.5% and 12.1% efficiencies, respectively and VOC was as high as 0.87–0.88 V. High JSC (22.8 mA cm−2) and high FF (67.9%) were obtained from the ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl based devices, respectively. Though different solar cell performances were seen in the binary devices, the use of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl (both 0.1 in wt/wt) as the acceptor guest of PM6:Y6 yielded close solar cell performance with 16.1% and 15.9% efficiencies, respectively.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes for the fabrication of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl are shown in Scheme 1, which are similar to the synthetic procedure for IN-4F. The detailed procedures are listed in ESI.† Compound 1 was obtained by Stille coupling reaction between intermediate ASiBDT-Sn and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-bromo-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (TT) unit in 70.7% yield. After a two-step synthesis, a fused-nine-ring compound 3 named ASiBDTTT was produced. Through Vilsmeier–Haack reaction, the dialdehyde derivative ASiBDTTT-2CHO was prepared in 80.1% yield. The target molecules of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation reaction between halogen-substituent end-groups of IC-2F or IC-2Cl and compound 3 in the yields of 75.5% and 72.3%, respectively. Both of them show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), 1,2-dichloromethane (DCM), chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), at room temperature. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of these two molecules also showed that the decomposition temperatures (Td) were about 380 °C and 377 °C within 5% weight loss for ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl (Fig. S1, ESI†), respectively, indicating that their thermal stability is enough to fabricate the photovoltaic devices.

DFT calculations
To understand the optimal conformations and distributions of the HOMOs and LUMOs of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl, DFT calculation was conducted at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level with Gaussian 09 version. The DFT calculation results are shown in Fig. 1e and f. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the backbones of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl are highly coplanar and rigid. As shown in Fig. 1e and f, the ethynyl units were largely involved into the HOMOs of both ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl and again they are included into the LUMOs, forming 2D conjugated structures. In a striking contrast, no inclusion of the 4,8-dithienyl units into either the HOMO or LUMO was seen on IN-4F.
Optical and electrochemical properties
To explore the optical properties of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl, UV-Vis absorption spectra in solution and thin films were measured and are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 2a, respectively. In diluted CF solution, the maximum absorption peak of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were located at 744 nm and 756 nm, respectively. Their maximum molar extinction coefficients (εmax) were 2.4 and 2.7 × 105 M−1cm−1, which is higher than 1.7 × 105 M−1cm−1 for IN-4F, demonstrating that the 2D conjugated structure is helpful for enhancing the absorptivity of the acceptor molecules. In neat films, the maximum absorption peaks of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were both red-shifted by 26 nm and 34 nm, respectively. The optical bandgaps of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were estimated to be 1.43 and 1.42 eV, which correspond to absorption onsets of 867 and 873 nm, respectively.

The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were estimated with Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The CV curves of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl neat films are displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The LUMO/HOMO energy levels of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were estimated to be −4.01/−5.61 eV and −4.05/−5.64 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b). With the side-chains changing from tri(n-propyl)silylthienyl to tri(n-propyl)silylalkynyl, the LUMO and HOMO levels were both decreased. Formation of 2D conjugated structure in ISI-4F leads to the delocalization of backbone π-electrons over the ethynyl units, where ethynyl acts as a weak electron-withdrawing unit in comparison to that of benzene. With the end-groups changing from tetra-fluorinated to tetra-chlorinated, the LUMO level was slightly decreased while the HOMO level was well retained. The HOMO levels of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were nearly identical to the HOMO level of Y6 and lower than that of PM6; the LUMO levels of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were higher than the Y6 LUMO level by about 0.1 eV, and lower than the PM6 LUMO by about 0.3–0.4 eV, which is beneficial for achieving an efficient charge separation when both the new acceptors are used as the acceptor materials paired with PM6 or acceptor guests of PM6:Y6 (Table 1).

Photovoltaic performance
To test the photovoltaic properties of the two new acceptors, we fabricated binary solar cells with PM6 as the donor polymer and a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. The D/A ratios, additive contents and thermal annealing (TA) temperatures were optimized, and the detailed experimental information is shown in (Table S1, ESI†). The device parameters of the optimal binary devices are shown in Table 2 and the J–V curves of the optimal binary devices are shown in Fig. 3a. When ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl were used as the acceptor materials, the PCEs of binary devices were 12.1 ± 0.4% and 11.5 ± 0.5%, and the maximum efficiencies were 12.5% and 12.1%, respectively. The values of VOC, JSC and FF were 0.878 V, 22.8 mA cm−2, 62.2% and 0.868 V, 20.5 mA cm−2, 67.9%, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of binary devices are given in Fig. 3b. The EQE responses cover a wide wavelength from 300 to 900 nm. The integrated values of JSC are 21.6 and 19.8 mA cm−2, which matched with the values from the measurement of the J–V curves.

Charge mobilities, recombination and collection
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of binary blended solar cell films were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The dark J–V data obtained from electron-only and hole-only devices are given in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The values of μh and μe are displayed in Table S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 4. The binary blends of PM6:ISI-4F and PM6:ISI-4Cl show close hole mobilities (2.2 × 10−4vs. 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). The ISI-4F based blend has a relatively larger electron mobility (4.3 × 10−4vs. 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is in agreement with the larger JSC value. High μh/μe ratio (0.70 vs. 0.51) was seen from the ISI-4Cl blend, which was consistent with the increased FF when the electron acceptor material was changed from ISI-4F to ISI-4Cl.

To understand the charge recombination of the blended films comprising ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl, the relationship of JSC, VOC and light intensity (P) was studied. The data are shown in Fig. 5a–d. By following the formula of JSC ∝ Pα and VOC ∝ (nkT/q)ln(P), where, n, k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively, the α values are fitted to be 0.988 and 0.983 and the n values are fitted to be 1.15 and 1.19kT/q for ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl (Table S3, ESI†), respectively. The closeness of α and n values suggest that the change in the halogenation on the end groups does not affect the charge recombination majorly.

To study the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency, the plot of photogenerated current-density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was drawn as depicted in Fig. 5e and f. Here, Veff = VBi − Vbias, where VBi is the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2, Vbias is the applied voltage, and Jph = JD − JL, where JD and JL are the current densities under light and dark conditions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5e and f, Jph got saturated (Jph,sat) at the large applied voltage regime (Veff > 2.0 V), implying that almost all photogenerated excitons were dissociated and the generated free charge carriers were collected by the electrodes. For ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl binary solar cells, the Jph,sat were 24.2 and 22.2 mA cm−2 and Jph,sc were 22.4 and 20.9 mA cm−2 (Table S3, ESI†), respectively. The increasing trend of Jph was in line with the tendency of Jsc observed from J–V curves. The increased electron mobility from ISI-4Cl to ISI-4F-based binary blends is one reason for the increased Jph. The charge collection efficiencies at short-circuit were calculated to be 92.6% and 94.1% (Table S3, ESI†), respectively, for the ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl based binary devices. The increased collection efficiency was in accordance with the increased FF.
Molecular packing and film morphology
To understand the differences in molecular packing between ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl, we collected the 1D profiles of grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The data are shown in Fig. 6. The diffraction peaks at around q ≈ 0.31 Å−1 (d ∼ 20.2 Å) were seen in out-of-plane (OOP) direction from the ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl neat films, which resulted from the packing of tri(n-propyl)silylethynyl side chains. Moreover, these peaks were also observed from the binary blended films of PM6:ISI-4F and PM6:ISI-4Cl at q ≈ 0.3 Å−1, indicating the well retained packing of the side chains when blended with PM6. The in-plane (IP) diffraction peaks at ∼0.3 Å−1 seen on the binary blends (Fig. 6b) are expected to originate from the packing of PM6 side chains. The strong diffractions at OOP ∼1.75 Å−1 (corresponding to a d value of 3.59 Å) corresponded to face-on packing of ππ-stacking-.

 Fig. 7  Line-cut profiles of ternary blended films of PM6:Y6:ISI-4F and PM6:Y6:ISI-4Cl. 
The film-morphologies of the binary blended films were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6c). As seen from the TEM images, both of the films display nanoscaled donor-rich (white) and acceptor-rich (dark) domains. Furthermore, the PM6:ISI-4Cl film shows a more distinct, larger dark-to-white contrast, suggesting enhanced phase separation in comparison to the PM6:ISI-4F. Longer and finer white phases (donor-rich) are seen on the PM6:ISI-4Cl blend. In AFM height images, we can clearly see finer nanofibril structures in ISI-4Cl binary film, which is in line with the higher FF obtained in the ISI-4Cl based binary solar cell. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl are 1.65 nm and 1.57 nm, respectively.
Ternary solar cell performance
To test the photovoltaic properties using ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl as the acceptor guests, we selected PM6:Y6 as the host binary system due to its higher LUMO levels compared with the LUMO of Y6 so as to obtain higher VOC. The optimal data are given in Table S4 (ESI†). The device parameters are shown in Table 2 and J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3c. Higher PCEs of 16.1% and 15.9% were obtained after adding 0.1% weight ratio of ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl as the third component of PM6:Y6. Increased JSC and VOC were both obtained and FFs were well maintained in comparison to the PM6:Y6 binary device. The increased JSC values were consistent with the integrated JSC values (25.1 and 24.8 mA cm−2) from the EQE spectra of ternary devices (Fig. 3d).
With the addition of 0.1% weight ratio of ISI-4F (ISI-4Cl) as the acceptor guest, the hole mobilities (μh) are increased from 2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y6 to 4.4 × 10−4 and 4.3 × 10−4 m2 V−1 s−1 for the PM6:Y6:ISI-4F and PM6:Y6:ISI-4Cl ternary blends, respectively, which was in line with the increased JSC. The increased hole mobilities also correspond to the increased CCL values estimated from the IP ∼ 0.3 Å−1 peaks (12.1 and 12.8 nm for the ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl based ternary blends, respectively) (Fig. 7). The small increase in the electron mobilities, changing from 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y6 to 3.4 × 10−4 and 3.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the two ternary blends, also agrees with the small increase in the CCL values estimated from OOP ∼ 1.76 Å−1 peaks, changing from 3.7 nm for PM6:Y6 to 3.9 nm and 4.0 nm for the ternary systems based on ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl, respectively. The α and n values were calculated to be 0.986 and 1.22 for PM6:Y6 (Table S3, ESI†). The α value remained unaffected and the n value reduced to 1.12 and 1.14kT/q (Table S3, ESI†), respectively, which suggests the reduction in the trap-assisted monomolecular recombination, benefiting to enhance the charge collection and therefore contributing to the increased JSC. Compared to PM6:Y6, the addition of the acceptor guest also resulted in a larger Jph,sc (Table S3, ESI†), again consistent with the increased JSC.

Synthesis of ASiBDT-TT. 
ASiBDT-Sn (300 mg, 0.34 mmol), TT (297.11 mg, 1.02 mmol) and catalyst Pd (PPh3)4 (39.25 mg, 0.03 mmol) were added to a 50 mL two-necked round-bottom flask and then, 20 mL of resteamed toluene was added to completely dissolve them. This was then heated in a 120 °C oil bath and stirred for 48 h.

Conclusions
In this study, we have synthesized two new narrow-bandgap 2D conjugated nonfullerene acceptor guests by replacing tri(n-propyl)silylthienyl side-chains with tri(n-propyl)silylethynyl counterparts. The most exciting feature of the fabricated acceptors was that the ethynyl chains were found to be significantly involved in the acceptor backbone HOMO and also LUMO, which contributed to enhancing the absorptivity and downshifted the energy levels as well. When paired with PM6 donor material, ISI-4F and ISI-4Cl offered 12.5% and 12.1% PCE values, respectively, and a high VOC of 0.87–0.88 eV. When employed in the PM6:Y6 host binary system as acceptor guests, 16.1% and 15.9% efficiencies were obtained. Our results imply that trialkylsilylalkynyl side-chains may be a potential strategy to design efficient non-fullerene small molecule acceptor guests for organic solar cells.
