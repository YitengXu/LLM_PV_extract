    , Accepted 1st January 2021First published on 4th January 2021AbstractTo achieve highly efficient organic photovoltaics (OPVs), control of the molecular orientation is one of the prime important factors, for the interfacial dipole orientation and energy offset at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface influence the device performance. We examine the effect of the planar-shape molecular orientation on the D/A interface, by comparing two different metal phthalocyanine molecules under identical process conditions. From the noticeable changes in the near edge X-ray absorption fine structure and ionization potential, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) on a thin CuI layer reveals a strong change in molecular orientation compared to zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc). To account for the different templating effect between CuPc and ZnPc, Cu d–d orbital coupling is evidenced as for the interaction between CuI and CuPc. The apparent change of the CuPc orientation reveals a relatively large energy offset at the CuPc/C60 D/A interface and increased open-circuit voltage in the corresponding OPV device. The lying-down orientation of CuPc on CuI or face-on geometry at the C60/CuPc interface induces strong electron–electron coupling and long-lived charge transfer exciton states, which is directly related to better charge separation and correspondingly good OPV performance.
Introduction
Organic/organic heterojunctions (OOHs) are fundamental building blocks with the potential for low cost, flexibility and large-scale optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1–3 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)4–6 and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).7–9 To develop high-performance organic electronics, researchers have attempted the design of new materials/device architectures10 and the modification of active layers with appropriate additives.11–13 In particular, control of the molecular orientation plays an essential role in tuning the material characteristics such as light absorption,14 charge transport,15 and energy level alignment16 for better device operation. In OPVs where photo-generated carriers (excitons) move toward the OOH interface and separate into free carriers (electrons and holes), well-ordered π–π stacking for conjugated small molecules is essential to improve the device efficiency.17,18 Thus, the “lying-down” configuration is generally superior to the standing-up in Scheme 1 because the direction of charge transfer/separation is normal to the OOH interface (anisotropic nature).

Red arrows show the anisotropy of exciton transport depending on the molecular orientation. 
In the fabrication of small-molecule organic films by vacuum deposition, various deposition parameters play key roles in the determination of the molecular orientation.19 For example, the substrate temperature20–22 and deposition rate23 are the important parameters that dramatically govern the thin film morphology and molecular orientation during the deposition process. In addition, the interaction between organic molecules and the substrate can be utilized as one of the key factors to determine the molecular orientation.24,25 An effective way to modify their interaction is the insertion of a buffer layer like cuprous halides (CuX),17,26 pentacene,27,28 graphene,29 and so on. In particular, CuI has a strong ionic property and its lattice orientation matches that of metal phthalocyanines (MPcs).30 Furthermore, the insertion of a CuI template layer shows good OPV performance by lowering the hole transport barrier on the anode side.17,31,32 However, despite the extensive research on CuI template effects, the origin of MPc molecular orientation control by CuI is not unveiled yet. For instance, lead phthalocyanine (PbPc) molecules do not show a clear orientation change on CuI but give a substantial OPV improvement in the near IR region.33,34 On the contrary, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) seem to give a substantial change in the molecular orientation on the CuI layer, but the results show strong dependence on the sample preparation method.17,35–39 For example, although the “lying-down” orientation of ZnPc on the CuI layer was reported by using IR reflection absorption spectroscopy40 and by using the atomic force microscopy (AFM)/X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques,38,41 the analysis of the growth behavior of ZnPc on CuI verified that ZnPc does not form the “lying-down” orientation on the CuI layer using the AFM/XRD technique.32 One reason for the disagreement is that the previous interpretation mostly relies on partial evidence from XRD and UV-vis absorption, which are sensitive mainly to the crystalline phase and include substrate interference effects, respectively. Moreover, even though the initial MPc orientation is determined by the competition between intermolecular interactions and substrate–molecule interactions, the underlying chemistry of the MPc/CuI interface has never been considered seriously. As the lattice constants of the above MPcs are similar, the chemical interaction depending on the central metal atom should be important. Thus, a full understanding of what makes a difference in the molecular orientation and how the molecular orientation affects the device performance remain unclear.
Here, we report the control of the molecular orientation of two different planar-shape donor molecules, CuPc and ZnPc, on ITO with or without a CuI layer as a template. Using near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), each molecular orientation is compared under identical process conditions. NEXAFS and UPS are sensitive to the average orientation of individual molecules, irrespective of the crystallinity or interface. Without CuI, both molecules show the standing-up orientation. But, the CuPc molecule changes to the lying-down orientation on the CuI layer, which is not the case for ZnPc. Such a different templating effect of the CuI layer is evidenced by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on the interaction between the MPcs and CuI. CuPc has additional orbital interactions via Cu d–d orbital coupling on the CuI layer compared to ZnPc, preferring the lying-down orientation. Actual OPV devices made of MPc/fullerene (C60) OOH interfaces show a substantial improvement by the template effect. In particular, the open circuit voltage (Voc) related to the OOH energy offset is increased for the C60/CuPc/CuI film structure. Finally, using time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (TR-2PPE), the dynamic behavior of charge transfer (CT) and separation at the MPc/fullerene (C60) OOH interface is studied. The lying-down orientation of CuPc and face-on contact with C60 show a clear feature of a longer CT exciton lifetime. This long-lasting CT exciton formation at the OOH interface is one of the critical conditions for high-performance OPV devices.
Experimental
Fabrication of the organic/organic interface
The organic/organic interface was fabricated as the following planar heterojunction structure, C60/MPc (M = Cu, Zn)/CuI/ITO. First, ITO-coated glass was exposed to UV-O3 for 10 minutes to eliminate organic contamination before use. All other films of the MPcs, C60, and CuI were thermally deposited onto the ITO substrate at a base pressure of 10−8 torr with a deposition rate of ∼0.1 Å s−1. The evaporation rate of the organic films was controlled by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The substrates were kept at room temperature during the evaporation process.
NEXAFS measurement
The NEXAFS measurement was performed at different angles of incident photons to obtain information on the molecular orientation. The absorbed X-ray intensity is measured in total electron yield mode at the 10D XAS KIST beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). The ratio between the absorption intensities at different incident angles gives information on the molecular orientation. The energy resolution (E/ΔE) is 2000–5000 in the beamline. We used the carbon 1s to π* transition below 290 eV to calculate the angles of the molecular plane.
UPS measurement
All spectroscopic measurements were conducted in an analysis chamber under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions (∼10−10 torr) equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer (SES-100, VG-Scienta) and a He I discharge lamp (ℏω = 21.2 eV) for UPS. In the UPS measurement, the samples were biased to −10 V to observe the secondary cutoff region for the work function measurement. Photoelectrons were detected in a surface normal geometry. The energy scales of the UPS spectra are aligned by matching the Fermi energy (EF) calibrated using a clean Au(111) single crystal. The total instrumental energy resolution was less than 0.1 eV for the UPS measurement.
DFT calculations
For chemical bonding information between the CuI substrate and MPc molecules, we carried out spin-polarized DFT calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).42,43 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential44 and Perdew–Burke–Emzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional45 are employed. The cut-off energy of the plane wave basis set was set to 500 eV. All structures were fully relaxed until the residual forces fell below 0.02 eV Å−1. We constructed a (6 × 6)  surface slab with the calculated lattice constant of bulk CuI (6.08 Å). The supercell consist of 6 layers and a vacuum separation of 15 Å for adsorption of phthalocyanine molecules. The copper-terminated back surface was passivated by pseudohydrogen with 1.75 electrons.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a solar simulator (K3000 LAB55, McScience Inc.) under 100 mW cm−2 power from a 150 W Xe short-arc lamp filtered by an AM 1.5G filter. A 6.25 mm2 mask was attached to the device to clearly define the active area; the device area was ∼0.15 cm2.
2PPE measurement
For the TR-2PPE study, a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra Physics) was set up to generate initial ultra-short laser pulses in a wavelength range of 690–1040 nm at a repetition rate of 80 ± 1 MHz. The beam was split into two (pump and probe) in a high harmonic generation system before entering the UHV analysis chamber. A fundamental beam ∼750 nm was used as a pump photon, which corresponds to the Q-band absorption of the MPcs as shown in Fig. 1a. Another beam with triple frequency by penetrating a nonlinear crystal (BBO or LBO crystal) was used as a probe photon. A time delay between the pump and probe beams can be accomplished using the delay stage. In front of the vacuum chamber, the pump beam was focused to a 100 μm diameter. The pump and probe beams were almost collinearly overlapped with equal polarizations (p-pump and p-probe). The cross correlation width between the two beams is ∼180 fs at hν1 = 1.55 eV (800 nm), which is measured on a clean Au(111) surface state. The power of the incident beam was suppressed to be less than ∼1 kW cm−2 to avoid photoinduced desorption or damage of organic molecules. The probe power density was 1–2 orders of magnitude lower. All measurements were carried out at room temperature.

Results and discussion
Molecular structure and energy level diagram

Fig. 1a shows the UV/vis absorption spectra of 10 nm C60 and MPc molecular films of ZnPc and CuPc, respectively. Both MPc molecules have a planar structure with perpendicular p-orbitals to the molecular plane. The electron (exciton) transfer in both MPc films is favored along the stacking axis due to the formation of the strong π-coupling between p-orbitals of neighbouring molecules.14,17,46 In addition, both MPc molecules have outstanding properties such as strong absorbance over a wide range of the solar radiation spectrum (especially 600–800 nm) as shown in Fig. 1a. The C60 molecule exhibits a unique spherical molecular structure with π-conjugated carbon atoms, which has aroused great interest in OPV devices as an acceptor material due to the high electron affinity (strong electronegativity) and superior ability of charge transport (high electron mobility).47,48 The C60 molecular film has strong absorbance at the low wavelength region as distinct from the MPc molecules. Fig. 1b presents a schematic energy level diagram of a typical MPc/C60 heterojunction based on our UPS measurements. Photon absorption of ∼1.7 eV generates excitons selectively in the MPc, and then they are transferred to the interface and separated into electrons in C60 and holes in the MPc. The detailed exciton dynamics at the interface will be discussed below.
Change in the MPc molecular orientation by the templating effect
A planar molecular shape shows strong anisotropy in polarized X-ray absorption parallel or perpendicular to the molecular axis. Polarization-dependent NEXAFS measurements possess directional sensitivity at the absorption edge from a selected atomic core level. Thus, the angular dependence of linearly polarized X-ray absorption from the carbon K edge to σ* and π* orbitals is opposite due to the symmetry of σ and π orbitals parallel and perpendicular to the aromatic ring plane, respectively.49Fig. 2a–d show the carbon K-edge absorption spectra of MPc (M = Zn or Cu) thin films with and without a CuI underlayer as a function of the incident X-ray angle (θ). The frontier peak below 290 eV is assigned to the C 1s excitation into π* orbitals. The broad peak above 290 eV is attributed to C 1s to σ* orbitals. The relation between the molecular tilt angle (α) and the σ* or π* peak intensities I(α,θ) is analyzed by the following eqn (1). I(α,θ) ∝ 1 + (3cos2θ − 1)((cos2α − 1)/2)(1)
 Fig. 2  Normalized carbon K-edge NEXAFS spectra of 10 nm ZnPc and CuPc with or without a CuI layer as a function of the incident X-ray angle (θ), respectively. 
The calculation results of the average angles of the molecular plane are summarized in Table 1. Without CuI, both ZnPc and CuPc show 60–80°, which is regarded as mostly the standing-up orientation. However, on CuI, CuPc shows a distinct change in the molecular axis to 30–40°, while ZnPc hardly shows any comparable change. This difference in the C K-edge NEXAFS change between CuPc and ZnPc is consistent with the N K-edge absorption measurement (not shown here).

Another parameter associated with the molecular orientation of organic films is the ionization potential (IP), which is expressed as the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the vacuum level (Evac + EHOMO). In solid phase films, planar molecules show distinct changes in the IP depending on their relative orientation. Fig. 3a shows the expected IP change of two typical MPc configurations of “standing-up” and “lying-down” according to previous literature.16,50–52 Previously, the IP values were explained by the surface dipole being oriented along the C–H atomic bond.16,50 But, the charge quadrupole term turns out to be the main contribution to the IP.51–53 Since both CuPc and ZnPc have a similar molecular structure and quadrupole component,52 the IP values depending on the orientation should vary in the same way. Thus, the lying-down orientation has a higher IP than the standing-up. Fig. 3b shows the IPs measured by UPS for C60/MPc (M = Zn, Cu) bilayers with and without a CuI layer on ITO as a function of the film thickness. From the UPS measurement, we measure the EHOMO and Evac onsets for the organic films and summarize the IP values in Table S1 (ESI†). In the case of the C60/ZnPc bilayer, the IP value shows a tiny change (ΔIP = 0.1~0.2 eV) by adding the CuI layer. It means that the CuI layer has little influence on the ZnPc molecular orientation. However, in the case of the C60/CuPc bilayer, we observed a noticeable increase in the IP (ΔIP = ∼0.7 eV) upon the addition of the CuI layer, which represents the lying-down orientation in the CuPc molecular film. Additionally, it is noted that the deposition of C60 on the lying-down CuPc film shows no substantial change of the IP value or HOMO peak width of CuPc,54 meaning that the C60 overlayer does not cause the change of the CuPc molecular orientation underneath or disorder. Thus, both the NEXAFS and UPS results clearly indicate that the average orientation of CuPc molecules experiences a remarkable CuI templating effect, but this is not the case for ZnPc under the same process conditions. The IP value as a function of ZnPc thickness on CuI does not show any considerable change in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). Thus, the CuI layer barely influences the ZnPc molecular orientation regardless of its thickness.

(b) Measurement of the IP for the C60/MPc (M = Zn, Cu) bilayer and only the MPc film with or without a CuI layer. Each HOMO onset and work function measured by UPS determine the IP values. 
Several previous reports suggested a ZnPc orientation change from a standing-up to a lying-down geometry by the templating effect on the basis of XRD or UV/vis absorption.37,38,41 The XRD results depend on the nanocrystal formation of CuI,37 PEDOT:PSS pre-coating,38 and surface flatness.41 Indeed, we have similar observations of XRD patterns in Fig. S3 and UV/vis absorption in Fig. S4 (ESI†), respectively. While CuPc shows the increase of the (13) plane peak instead of (200) on CuI, ZnPc shows a weak and broad (13) peak. This comparison means that CuPc has a relatively strong templating effect compared to ZnPc. The UV/vis absorption shows an intensity increase for both CuPc and ZnPc on CuI, but the absorption is influenced by interface interference as well as the molecular orientation. The absorbance increase in CuPc is more pronounced, which is because CuPc molecules are relatively flat, assuming an identical interface of MPc/CuI/ITO.
Interaction between the MPc and the CuI template layer
The templating effect is a degree of heteroepitaxial growth of an organic thin film on a templating layer. That is, the interaction between organic molecules and the templating layer is the main driving force to control the molecular orientation of MPcs under identical growth conditions. From the NEXAFS and UPS analysis above, we verified the different epitaxial growth of CuPc and ZnPc films on the CuI layer. To elucidate the difference in the degree of epitaxy between the CuPc and ZnPc films, the lattice mismatch is firstly considered to characterize the commensurate epitaxy, which can be simply derived by lattice mismatch [%] = (dmole − χdsubs)/χdsubs × 100 [%].55 From the XRD pattern of 10 nm CuI on ITO in Fig. S5 (ESI†), CuI shows a crystalline form with a zinc blende (111) structure (a, b, c = 6.054 Å, α, β, γ = 90°).55 Based on the lattice parameters for the CuPc (a = 25.92 Å, b = 3.79 Å, c = 23.92 Å, β = 90.4°)56,57 and ZnPc films (a = 25.98 Å, b = 3.78 Å, c = 24.21 Å, β = 90.6°),57 we calculated a lattice mismatch [%] of 7.03 for CuPc and 7.28 for ZnPc at [100]MPcs/[100]CuI, and 1.22 for CuPc and 0.02 for ZnPc at [001]MPcs/[010]CuI with a CuI layer. Because both mismatch values are below the upper limit (∼15%) for epitaxy,58 the verification of the difference in the degree of epitaxy between the CuPc and ZnPc films on the CuI layer is not clear at all.
On the other hand, we performed DFT calculations to consider the direct chemical interaction between the zinc blende CuI(111) substrate and MPc molecules in a planar adsorption geometry. The difference between CuPc and ZnPc is the central metal atom, Cu or Zn. Thus, we suggest that the interaction governing the molecular orientation, i.e., the interaction between the MPc and CuI, will be mediated by the transition metal (TM) ion in each MPc molecule. Fig. 4a shows the partial density of states (pDOS) of the d-orbitals of the TM ions in the MPcs, and the charge density plot at the energy level as denoted with a star (*) in the pDOS. The d-electron configurations of the TM ions in the MPcs are represented by [Ar]3d9 at Cu(II) and [Ar]3d10 at Zn(II). By changing the TM ion from Zn(II) to Cu(II), d-orbitals are depopulated, which results from the unpaired electron within the d-orbitals only at CuPc.

The light brown, purple and red balls represent copper, iodine, and surface copper atoms, respectively. (c) A schematic diagram showing the selective hybridization between the d-orbital of surface Cu atoms and the half-filled dx2−y2 orbital of CuPc unlike ZnPc. (d) Top and side view of the two binding configurations of the MPcs to the –3Cuadatom surface: (left) CuPc and (right) ZnPc. The grey, blue, and grey navy balls represent carbon, nitrogen, and zinc, respectively. 
We hypothesize that the dominant states of the valence band maximum (VBM) of the CuI substrate could chemically interact with the singly occupied dx2−y2 orbital of CuPc. The VBM of the CuI bulk predominantly consists of d-states of the cation with some contribution of p-states of the anion (Fig. S6, ESI†). Therefore, we focus on the copper exposed surface for the formation of chemical bonding with the TM ion in the MPc. Furthermore, the localized dangling bonds of the CuI(111) surface can interrupt the self-assembly of MPc molecules into the ordered structure. For better control of the interaction between the molecules and the substrate, the surface needs to be deactivated by atomic passivation or self-reconstruction.59 Among the surfaces with a clean band gap, the copper-rich 3Cuadatom complex on the  √3 × √3 R30° surface is the only cation-exposed surface. This surface is self-passivated by gathering three surface Cu adatoms with three-fold symmetry as shown in Fig. 4b.

Fig. 4c is a schematic diagram showing the energy gain by selective hybridization between the fully occupied d-orbital of surface Cu atoms and the half-filled dx2−y2 orbital of CuPc unlike ZnPc. To confirm the selective d–d coupling, we obtained the binding energy (Eb) between MPc molecules and the substrate by constructing a molecular adsorption model on the –3Cuadatom surface. Eb is calculated by the following eqn (2): Eb = E(MPc) + E(CuI surface) − E(MPc/CuI)(2)where E indicates the DFT total energy of the calculated system. The Eb values of CuPc and ZnPc to the  surface are 0.91 and 0.80 eV per unit, respectively. By considering dispersion corrections in the DFT calculations, we obtained 3.14 and 3.01 eV for the binding energy of CuPc and ZnPc, respectively, without any noticeable change in the atomic structures. As the TM-N4 moiety in the MPc binds to the CuI surface, three surface Cu atoms respond and relax to the spatial location of the CuPc dx2−y2 orbital as shown in Fig. 4d. On the other hand, there is no appreciable relaxation upon the binding of ZnPc to the  surface. This extra Eb is due to the charge transfer from dz2 of surface Cu atoms to dx2−y2 of Cu in CuPc (Fig. S7, ESI†). Similarly, different TM d-electron interactions with deactivated substrates have been elucidated in previous literature.59 Therefore, we propose that the CuI surface may have a non-negligible chemical interaction with only CuPc molecules because of its unpaired d-electron.
Furthermore, it has been experimentally and theoretically reported that ZnPc molecules show a slight non-planarity, different from planar CuPc.39,60,61 This is because the Zn(II) ion has a higher ionic diameter than the cavity diameter of H2Pc by about 0.075 Å.39 Therefore, ZnPc may possess more complicated molecular orientation by the change in the angle between the substrate and molecules, easily resulting in the distortion of the molecular symmetry of D4h.
Device characterization
To correlate the influence of the molecular orientation on the OPV device performance, bilayer organic solar cells were fabricated using the MPcs (M = Cu, Zn) and C60 as the donor and acceptor materials, respectively. The CuI layer is often used to increase the short circuit current (Jsc) and the open circuit voltage (Voc) as an anode buffer layer in OPV devices, because the strong p-type characteristics of CuI facilitate hole collection (or electron blocking) from the donor to the ITO anode. The device structure of the OPV is ITO/CuI (3)/MPc (20)/C60 (40)/BCP (8)/Al (100 nm). Fig. 5 shows the current density and voltage (J–V) characteristics and the energy band alignments of the corresponding OPVs. The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). As expected, Jsc of the CuPc-based OPV is enhanced from 3.89 mA cm−2 to 4.27 mA cm−2 upon the addition of a CuI layer, leading to the corresponding power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing from 1.01% to 1.31%. For a similar reason, the ZnPc-based OPV also shows increased Jsc from 3.98 mA cm−2 to 5.28 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 5  Measured current density versus voltage characteristics for (a) CuPc/C60 and (b) ZnPc/C60 bilayer solar cells with or without a CuI layer under simulated AM 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) solar irradiation. The corresponding energy band alignments are depicted in the right panel. Each energy value is obtained by UPS measurements. The Δ value indicates the interfacial band gap (ΔE) for each system. Device data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). 
In addition, Voc for both OPV devices is increased upon CuI insertion. Especially, the CuPc-based OPV exhibits a noticeable Voc increase by 0.04 V, while ZnPc by 0.02 V. Voc can be expressed by eqn (3)62 ignoring the kinetic term of charge recombination, qVoc ≈ (IPD − EAA) − q2/4πεrrDA(3)where ε0 and εr are the vacuum permittivity and the relative dielectric constant of the organic material, respectively, and rDA is the initial separation distance of the optically generated hole and electron pair in the donor and acceptor layers. In this equation, (IPD − EAA) indicates the interfacial band gap (ΔE) or energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. Thus, the larger ΔE is, the higher Voc is in OPVs. Fig. 5 illustrates the energy band alignments and ΔE values of the present systems. The relatively large increase of ΔE by 0.08 eV at the C60/CuPc interface by the CuI templating effect corresponds to the increase of the Voc value, whereas the C60/ZnPc interface shows a marginal change. Such a distinct increase in ΔE by the molecular orientation change was also verified by previous calculations.46
Contrary to the above expectation, the ZnPc-based OPV shows always better device performance. Firstly, the interface energy offset, ΔE, for ZnPc is always larger than for CuPc, regardless of the CuI layer. This absolute energy offset gives a high Voc value for the ZnPc-based OPV. Secondly, the reasons for the higher Jsc value of the ZnPc-based OPV are as follows. A high performance in bilayer OPVs can be achieved by securing high quality organic thin films with high order, large size, and low defects including grain boundaries,25 because grain boundary defects tend to act as carrier recombination sites. Furthermore, the exciton diffusion length and mobility are strongly limited by the domain size of the organic donor or acceptor in bilayer solar cells.63 In Fig. S8 (ESI†), the addition of a CuI layer increases the domain size more in ZnPc than in CuPc. Therefore, this larger grain size of ZnPc could account for the efficient performance of the ZnPc-based OPV regardless of the change in the molecular orientation. However, the roughness (RMS) of the thin film for ZnPc/CuI (10.9 nm) is about two times higher than for CuPc/CuI (6.2 nm) because the lying-down orientation leads to relatively slow surface roughening.64
Furthermore, it is reported that the TM ions of the MPc thin film induce the variation of the optical and electrical behavior.65 It is revealed that the MPc thin film has electronic ligand–TM exchange coupling (LMEC) states except for the ZnPc thin film due to the difference in the electronic configuration of the TM ions by analysis of the fluorescence quantum yield. The LMEC states have lower energies than the optical band gap, which induces gap states within the Q-band (π–π*) transition. Eventually, these gap states prevent the photo-generated carriers from splitting at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface and lead to a decrease in the carrier lifetime (τ), because they act as a relaxation channel through non-radiative decay. ZnPc generally has fewer non-radiative decay channels. As a result, the exciton diffusion length (30 nm) of the ZnPc thin film65,66 is longer than that of the CuPc thin film (10 nm),67 which also explains the higher efficiency in the ZnPc-based bilayer OPV.
Exciton dynamics at C60/CuPc depending on the molecular orientation
To compare the charge separation efficiency at each interface depending on the molecular orientation of CuPc, we fabricated the organic/organic interface using fullerene (C60) as an organic acceptor material. Fig. 6a and b show TR-2PPE spectra of 1 ML C60/10 nm CuPc with or without a 3 nm CuI layer, respectively. A pump energy (hν1) of 1.65 eV was used to selectively excite the S1 exciton level of CuPc according to the absorption spectra in Fig. 1a. At the C60/CuPc interface with the CuI layer, we can observe a CT spectral feature denoted in Fig. 6a, which is definitely different from the triplet (T1) spectral feature subsequent to the strong singlet (S1) of the 10 nm CuPc film without C60 as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). In the case of the neat CuPc film, intersystem crossing (S1 → T1) occurs on a sub-picosecond timescale (τISC = ∼0.5 ps), which can be observed by the relaxation of S1 and the increase of the T1 population, simultaneously. Unlike the T1 exciton, however, the CT exciton population begins to increase gradually after all S1 excitons are relaxed. Furthermore, the CT excitons show continuous energy relaxation by increasing the time delay (Δt), because the CT state consists of a series of Rydberg energy states.68 Although the CT spectral feature is energetically overlapped with the T1 state and one-photon background (hν2 > Φsystem) at a low kinetic range in Fig. 6a, the presence of the CT exciton is confirmed complementarily on the Au(111) substrate in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The CT state is energetically relaxed within ∼1 ps. In addition, the low energy component is ∼0.1 eV higher than that for the CuPc film only (Fig. S9, ESI†), which indicates that CT is located at ∼0.1 eV above T1 in CuPc.69
 Fig. 6  Energy-resolved 2PPE spectra of a 1 ML C60/10 nm CuPc film deposited on ITO (a) with or (b) without a CuI layer at different delay times (−0.5, 0, 1, 2, and 3 ps). Without a CuI layer, “standing-up” CuPc does not show the energy relaxation of CT excitons depending on the delay time. 
On the contrary, Fig. 6b shows significantly different exciton dynamics at the C60/CuPc interface without the CuI layer. Without the CuI layer, the standing-up CuPc shows only rapid decay of S1 excitons of CuPc on a sub-picosecond timescale due to intersystem crossing (S1 → T1) similar to the neat CuPc film as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).70 Furthermore, no clear CT spectral feature can be identified for the C60/CuPc interface without the CuI layer depending on the pump–probe delay (Δt). Thus, it is clear that the CuPc film with the standing-up configuration does not generate detectable CT excitons at the D/A interface region despite the S1 excitation. The above results are fully consistent with the previous expectation, in which the face-on geometry of the D/A interface takes a longer CT lifetime than the edge-on geometry.71 In other words, the edge-on geometry gives rapid non-radiative recombination at the D/A interface. Therefore, if the molecular orientation of MPc has a well-defined lying-down orientation at the interface, the carrier transport from the MPc donor to the C60 acceptor would be favorable because the pump-induced carriers from the donor material can easily move toward the interface region along the stacking axis due to the π–π overlap between p-orbitals of neighbouring molecules.
From the above results, the insertion of a CuI layer results in the change of the CuPc molecular orientation from a standing-up to a lying-down orientation. Excitons can be vertically delocalized in the CuPc donor film with the lying-down molecular orientation, which easily forms a CT exciton at the D/A interface by the strong overlap of molecular orbitals between C60 and the CuPc film. Therefore, the exciton can easily transfer to spatially free charge carriers rather than recombine, which is in good agreement with the better OPV performance in Fig. 5.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we investigated the change in the molecular orientation of planar-shape MPc (M = Cu, Zn) donors by adding a CuI templating layer, its influence on D/A interface charge separation, and the corresponding OPV device performance. Among the two donor molecules, CuPc and ZnPc, CuPc reveals a noticeable change in the NEXAFS and IP measurements on CuI, which represents the apparent change of the molecular plane from the standing-up to the lying-down geometry. However, the ZnPc molecules are hardly changed, which means that CuI has little influence on the molecular orientation of ZnPc under the present process conditions. To explain the different templating effect of the CuI layer, we performed DFT calculations of the binding energies of the MPcs to a relaxed CuI(111) surface. The orbital interaction between Cu–Cu atoms facilitates the lying-down orientation of CuPc molecules on the CuI layer. Such an apparent change in the molecular orientation of CuPc shows a substantial change in the energy offset between the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO. The corresponding OPV device performance upon the formation of the C60/CuPc interface generates higher Voc. Furthermore, we studied the influence of the molecular orientation on the exciton dynamics at the OOH interface using TR-2PPE. On the CuI layer, the C60/CuPc interface with the face-on geometry shows clear CT characteristics, while the edge-on orientation shows only rapid T1 formation. The long-lived CT states at the face-on CuPc/C60 interface are due to π–π overlap between the donor and acceptor molecules, and cause better device performance.
