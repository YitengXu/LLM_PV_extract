    , Accepted 24th July 2012First published on 24th July 2012AbstractConjugated PPV–PPE copolymer P1 has been investigated in organic solar cells in combination with twelve different fullerene derivatives. It was shown that the length of solubilizing alkyl chains in the fullerene derivative structures correlates well with the performance of photovoltaic cells.
Intensive development of novel electron donor photoactive materials led to significant progress in the field of organic photovoltaics.1 Certified power conversion efficiencies of around 10% have been reported for organic solar cells in 2011–2012.2 The first commercial products comprising organic photovoltaic modules have appeared on the market.3
The vast majority of the electron donor materials developed in the last decade showed insufficiently high photovoltaic performances and were subsequently discarded.4 An exceptionally low number of well-performing materials represents an obstacle for further improvement of organic photovoltaics.
The design of new materials for organic solar cells has been guided for years by optimization of electronic properties of donor and acceptor counterparts.5 Unfortunately, novel materials with designed electronic properties demonstrate almost unpredictable behavior in organic solar cells.6 Blending the electron donor and electron acceptor materials together is one of the most crucial steps in the device fabrication procedure. Most advanced materials possessing excellent electronic properties might easily produce unfavorable active layer morphology thus resulting in poor device performance.7
We have shown recently that both the morphology and the photovoltaic performance of the polymer–fullerene derivative composites greatly depend on the solubility of the materials.8 It has also been shown that the replacement of conventional [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM with specially designed fullerene derivatives bearing longer solubilizing alkyl side chains improves the photovoltaic performance of poly(phenylene-vinylene) (PPV) and poly(phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(phenylene-vinylene) (PPE–PPV) type conjugated polymers significantly.9 These findings suggest strongly that morphology and photovoltaic performance of the fullerene–polymer composites might be potentially controlled by varying the solubilizing alkyl side chains attached to the fullerene cage or the polymer backbone.
In the present communication we report molecular structure–photovoltaic performance relationships that were revealed for the PPV–PPE copolymer P1 investigated in combination with a number of cyclopropane fullerene derivatives. The molecular structures of these materials are shown in Fig. 1. The synthesis of the copolymer P1 (Mw = 139600, PDI = 4.2) and the fullerene derivatives F2–F10 and F12 was reported previously.10
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the investigated materials. 
All twelve fullerene derivatives can be represented by a general molecular structure shown in Fig. 2. The “cycle” in this structure stands for a phenyl or a 2-thienyl substituent attached to the cyclopropane ring. The number of methylene units between the cyclopropane ring and the ester group (n) varies from 0 to 3. The total number of carbon atoms forming the alkyl chain attached to the carboxylic function is denoted m and used as an important structural descriptor in our model.

The photovoltaic performance of the P1–fullerene derivative composites was investigated using classical bulk heterojunction solar cell architecture shown in Fig. 2. The photoactive composites were prepared by dissolving P1 (8 mg) and the respective fullerene derivative (24 mg) in chlorobenzene (1 mL) under continuous stirring for 48 h. The prepared solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter and spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass slides at 1200 rpm. The obtained films were annealed at 130 °C for 5 min. To complete the photovoltaic devices, metal top electrodes were deposited by sequential evaporation of a calcium (20 nm) and a silver layer (100 nm). The active area of a single device was 0.5 cm2 as defined by a shadow mask.
Depending on the molecular structure of the fullerene component the short circuit current densities (JSC) of the fabricated photovoltaic devices varied from 2.3 to 8.3 mA cm−2, while the power conversion efficiencies (η) varied from 0.9 to 3.9% (Fig. S1, ESI†). The open circuit voltages and fill factors scattered in the range of 600–800 mV and 28–61%, respectively (Table 1).

It should be noted that all investigated fullerene derivatives have very similar LUMO energies as it was concluded from cyclic voltammetry measurements.8–10 The optical properties of the [60]fullerene derivatives were also virtually identical since they have the same chromophore units.9 Therefore, a strong variation in the photovoltaic performances observed for the P1–fullerene derivative composites cannot be attributed to any differences in optoelectronic properties of the materials.
The obtained results reveal clear correlations of the short circuit current densities, fill factors and power conversion efficiencies of the devices with the structural descriptor m, which corresponds to the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon radicals in the ester groups of compounds F1–F12 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, ESI†). It is seen from Fig. 3 that fullerene derivatives bearing butyl residues attached to the carboxylic group (m = 4: F3, F9, F12) yielded the best device characteristics. The compounds with shorter (m = 1–3) or longer (m = 5–8) alkyl chains exhibited inferior performances.

We emphasize that very minor changes in the molecular structures of the fullerene derivatives influence strongly their photovoltaic performance. The conventional fullerene-based materials such as [60]PCBM (F1), [70]PCBM (F11) and [60]ThCBM (F10) characterized by m = 1 (methyl group) exhibited relatively low photovoltaic performances in combination with P1 (η = 0.9–1.2%), which just by itself could mislead to the assumption that P1 (or just the investigated polymer batch) has insufficient quality and is hardly suitable for any photovoltaic applications. However, the device performance of P1 was improved by a factor of 4 simply by replacing the conventional [60]PCBM with the fullerene derivative F9 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The observed dramatic enhancement of the light power conversion efficiency from 0.9 to 3.9% correlates with the increase in the length of the alkyl side chain from methyl to butyl (consider e.g.F3 and F12) and also might be related to the presence of the thiophene unit in the structure of F9.
In order to gain a better understanding of the observed molecular structure–photovoltaic performance relationship we investigated the polymer P1–fullerene derivative composite films by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 4 shows the microscopy images obtained for the composites comprising fullerene derivatives F1 (m = 1), F9 (m = 4) and F7 (m = 8). The AFM and SEM images for some other systems are provided in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†). It is seen from Fig. 4 that F1–P1 films are very inhomogeneous and exhibit large clusters approaching 300–400 nm in size. It is known that the exciton diffusion lengths in organic semiconductors do not exceed typically 10–15 nm.

Therefore, the excitons generated inside large clusters recombine before reaching the interface with the other material where charge separation occurs. This explains the poor photovoltaic performance of the composite comprising F1 ([60]PCBM). Very similar results were also obtained for F10 ([60]ThCBM) and F11 ([70]PCBM) (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). The best performing composite F9–P1 exhibited a well ordered film structure with the characteristic domain size in the range of 10–20 nm which is very close to the optimum for organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. The composite F7–P1 showed rather structureless SEM and AFM images suggesting that the fullerene derivative and the polymer are well intermixed in this system. It is known that insufficient phase separation does not create percolation pathways required for efficient transport of the photogenerated charges to the electrodes and finally results in a poor photovoltaic performance of the system.
The obtained data imply that increase in the length of the alkyl side chain attached to the carboxylic group improves the miscibility of the fullerene derivative with the polymer P1. Butyl chains (m = 4) induce an optimal degree of phase separation between the components of the blend enabling a balanced charge generation and charge transport required for efficient operation of photovoltaic cells. This hypothesis is well supported by Fig. 5 which shows the dependence of the average lateral size of the clusters detected in the composite films by AFM and/or SEM as a function of the descriptor m.

In conclusion, we have shown that the molecular structure of the fullerene derivatives is a critical parameter which defines both the morphology and the photovoltaic performance of their composites with the polymer P1. The properties of these systems were correlated with good accuracy with a structural descriptor m. The revealed correlation might be the first step towards the development of a predictive model based on the material structure–composite morphology–photovoltaic performance relationships. This model might stimulate the material design for organic photovoltaics similarly to the QSAR approach which has been guiding the drug design for years.
