    , Accepted 23rd October 2017First published on 24th October 2017AbstractThe emergence of highly efficient lead halide perovskite solar cell materials makes the exploration and engineering of new lead free compounds very interesting both from a fundamental perspective as well as for potential use as new materials in solar cell devices. Herein we present the electronic structure of several lanthanide (La) based materials in the metalorganic halide perovskite family not explored before. Our estimated bandgaps for the lanthanide (Eu, Dy, Tm, Yb) perovskite compounds are in the range of 2.0–3.2 eV showing the possibility for implementation as photo-absorbers in tandem solar cell configurations or charge separating materials. We have estimated the typical effective masses of the electrons and holes for MALaI3 (La= Eu, Dy, Tm, Yb) to be in the range of 0.3–0.5 and 0.97–4.0 units of the free electron mass, respectively. We have shown that the localized f-electrons within our DFT+U approach, make the dominant electronic contribution to the states at the top of the valence band and thus have a strong impact on the photo-physical properties of the lanthanide perovskites. Therefore, the main valence to conduction band electronic transition for MAEuI3 is based on inner shell f-electron localized states within a periodic framework of perovskite crystal by which the optical absorption onset would be rather inert with respect to quantum confinement effects. The very similar crystal structure and lattice constant of the lanthanide perovskites to the widely studied CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, are prominent advantages for implementation of these compounds in tandem or charge selective contacts in PV applications together with lead iodide perovskite devices.
1 Introduction
Based on hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite materials, a new class of high efficiency and low cost solar cell devices has been introduced recently and attracted a considerable amount of interest among researchers from chemistry, physics and materials science.1 This material class has been presented as “The next big thing in photovoltaics,2 and has been widely studied in both fundamental investigations3–5 as well as implemented in various solar cell architectures including mesoporous,6,7 planar,8,9 inverted,10 and tandem applications.11,12 In a representative planar perovskite solar cell, an intrinsic perovskite light absorbing layer of CH3NH3PbI3 is integrated in a n–i–p semiconductor junction configuration, sandwiched between charge selective layers which may comprise metal oxides such as TiO2,13 SnO2,14 ZnO15 and NiO16 as well as organic films of PEDOT,9 spiro-OMeTAD6 and PCBM.16 However, regarding the stability, the charge collection ability and the impact on the device performance such as hysteresis effects,17,18 each selective layer has its own benefits and drawbacks.
Not surprisingly, the material engineering of the methylammonium lead iodide has started with metal,19–24 cation25,26 and anion27 substitution, in order to understand the physical properties, to optimize the device stability28 and performance, and to reduce the amount of lead29,30 due to environmental and toxicity concerns.31,32 The greatest success so far has been a mixed cation mixed halide perovskite33,34 material in which a fraction of the iodide atoms are substituted by bromide and the methylammonium (MA) replaced by formamidinium. This material has a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1% and, recently, 500 hours device stability at 85 °C under full illumination35 and 1000 hours stability at 85 °C and 85% humidity36 were reported for mixed perovskite devices. Furthermore, by gradual substitution, a wide range of band gaps are attainable through which the application of the perovskite solar cell as a top cell in the tandem configuration is feasible,34 and a band gap of 1.75 eV was achieved as an optimized value for a tandem configuration with a silicon solar cell.37
One of the concerns with lead iodide perovskites is the toxicity of lead. Lead poisoning has been recognized as a major public health risk, that can have negative effects on the hematopoietic, renal, reproductive and central nervous system.38 Using water soluble lead salt raises both toxicity and legislation concerns, due to which alternative lead-free perovskites are of interest. Although the amount of lead in a single commercial car battery is orders of magnitude larger than in the number of perovskite solar cell devices of comparable power density, the water solubility and the wide coverage needed for solar cell panels represent considerable challenges. However, the impact of rain on the cracked lead based perovskite device has been evaluated39 and considered as a non-catastrophic event and moreover the large scale commercialization of water soluble lead perovskite films may be possible using appropriate device sealing and protection.32 Nevertheless, at the end of their working lifetime, the devices will have to be collected according to international electronic waste disposal regulations causing further questions about large expenditure (about $1.10 per kg currently).40,41 Therefore, the development of lead free perovskites with similar optoelectronic properties would be preferable. A more detailed discussion about the lead toxicity particularly in perovskite solar cell devices can be found in ref. 31 and 32. Research efforts in this direction would also provide opportunities for the improvement of other material properties such as enhancement of the hole conductivity,42 achievement of different optical band gaps43 and more intriguing effects such as alterations in the ferroelectric effects, and multiple light emissions that could form new materials applied also in areas outside the solar cell field.
Metal substitution could also be of benefit in the production of devices based on perovskite materials. Although hybrid perovskites films are currently synthesized using solution based processing, such methods are not optimal for commercial purposes, where vacuum vapour phase deposition would be more appropriate, as well as more compatible with the construction of tandem devices. In a multi tandem configuration, films with different band gaps, which can be sequentially deposited on top of each other, absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. A metal substitution approach would be preferential in a multi-layer sequential vapour phase deposition by which replacement of the metal can tune the band gap. This removes the complications of mixed cation–mixed halide approaches which in some cases makes use of four different cations and two different halides in the solution albeit the exact formed phase(s) and their intermixing being unclear. Furthermore it has been reported that by rare earth substitution, the implementation of perovskite selective layers with the same crystal structure and lattice spacing of CH3NH3PbI3 results in very good quality vapour phase growth with minimal thermally induced stress under high temperature working conditions.23
Based on the foregoing discussion, and our previous report on lead replacement based on the classical Goldschmidt's rules with additional quantum mechanical considerations,24 herein we present a theoretical investigation of a family of metal halide perovskites based on the substitution of lead with the lanthanides ytterbium, europium, thulium, and dysprosium. Most of the lanthanides are rather abundant i.e. more abundant than Pt, Ru, gold and even iodine. Regarding the possible synthesis of the compounds using vacuum deposition, we note that the boiling points of the lanthanides are in the same range as that of lead. Moreover, there are no clear indications that europium is particularly toxic compared to other heavy metals, or that it poses any environmental threat to plants or animals. Europium compounds classified as having slight toxicity, proved to be less toxic than heavy metals particularly lead. The same is reported for dysprosium and thulium44 and would make these elements promising as replacement for lead. In this study, we calculate the structural properties such as the lattice constants and octahedra tilting angles, as well as electronic band structures and effective masses of charges, and the chemical nature of conduction and valence band edges. By comparing their properties with those of materials containing lead, we discuss the suitability of these materials for applications in solar cell devices as either photo-absorbers or charge conductive layers. The physical rationalisation of the impact of the cation size and the metal work function on the obtained results are also assessed. Finally, we have explored the possible limitations on the accuracy of commonly reported GGA based band gaps by varying the local DFT+U interaction via calculations based on different Hubbard U parameter. We find that the use of a Hubbard correction is necessary in order to describe the localized nature of the f-electrons and have implications if similar compounds are to be pursued with DFT simulations.
2 Computational methods
Periodic DFT calculations were performed with the Quantum Espresso package45 following the previously reported procedure.23 The calculations were performed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)46 exchange correlation functional. To treat the strongly correlated f-electrons we apply a Hubbard correction (+U). We have used the simplified version of Cococcioni and de Gironcoli47 as implemented in the Quantum Espresso package. The spin polarized PBE+U calculations have been performed with pseudopotentials including f-electrons for the europium iodide perovskite, and the results were compared for different U values of the same pseudopotential. The Eu: 4d 10/4f 6.5/5s 2/5p 6/5d 0.5/6s 2, Dy: 4d 10/4f 10/5s 2/5p 6/5d 0/6s 2, Tm: 4d 10/4f 13/5s 2/5p 6/5d 0/6s 2, and Yb: 4d 10/4f 14/5s 2/5p 6/5d 0/6s 2 electrons were considered as valence electrons. The implemented Hubbard model in our calculation was proved to be necessary to assess the optical properties of the localized f-electrons, attaining trustable results with regards of bandgap compared to experimentally obtained ones. The corresponding U values were chosen to be close to the typical range of 3–5 eV implemented for lanthanide compounds; in the case of the CH3NH3EuI3 the optimum U value corresponding to experimentally obtained band gap of 2.77 eV (ref. 48) was determined to be 3 eV. The starting point for variable cell relaxations with the BFGS method used the highest spin configurations for lanthanide f-electrons and the finally obtained spin configuration was the highest spin as well. The super cells consisted of 48 atoms in a tetragonal Bravis lattice, and the starting cell parameters were set to a = 8.85 Å and c = 12.57 Å. The orientation of the different methyl ammonium cations (CH3NH3+) was chosen so that neighbouring dipoles were perpendicular to each other with a net dipole moment in the c-direction. This configuration of the methyl ammonium ions has been reported to constitute the most stable phase at room temperature for the lead perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 according to DFT calculations.49 This structure could be described as composed of four slightly distorted cubic unit cells with a cell parameter, a, around 6.31 Å. All the unit cell vectors and atom coordinates were relaxed to have a total force lower than 0.002 Ry au−1 (2 mRy a.u.−1) and energy difference lower than 0.0002 Ry (0.2 mRy). Cut off energies for the plane wave function, and the charge density were set to 135 and 750 Rydberg respectively. Brillouin zone sampling was carried out using a 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack grid (MPG) for the relaxation procedure, a 2 × 2 × 2 MPG for the self-consistent procedures, and a 4 × 4 × 4 MPG for the non-self-consistent procedures. The values of the reported band gaps were extracted from the band structure graphs. The XcrysDen50 package and VESTA program were used for visualization of atoms, potentials, and charge densities.
3 Results and discussion
According to the classical Goldschmidt's rules, the substitution of lanthanides for lead in the tetragonal perovskite lattice becomes feasible if the lanthanide cation size and charge are close to those of the Pb2+ cation.24 Here, we investigate Eu2+, Dy2+, Tm2+ and Yb2+ as possible candidates, and compare the physical properties of the resulting materials with the Pb2+ perovskite. The data presented in the next two sections are generated with DFT+U, with U = 3 eV. We present the data for U = 5 in the ESI† and discuss the importance and impacts of the Hubbard U value in Section 3.3.
3.1 Structural properties
The tetragonal lanthanide perovskites have similar lattice constants to the lead iodide perovskite. Our corresponding a and c tetragonal lattice constants are smaller/larger by factors of about 0.97–1.003 and 0.95–1.005, respectively, compared to the lead perovskite lattice constants (Tables S1 and S2 of the ESI†). Therefore, they are in principle capable of making close to epitaxial contacts with lead perovskite films when utilized in a tandem configuration as an absorber or a charge selective contact. Compared to Pb2+, the different electronegativity (δ), electronic configuration and work function of lanthanide cations together with their slightly different cation size, however, lead to structural changes within the corresponding organic halogen perovskite lattice. The structural changes here are reported for the metal–halogen bond length and bond angles (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

For lanthanide perovskites, smaller cation sizes result in less deviation from the ideal 180° iodide–metal–iodide bond angles as well as shorter metal–iodide bond lengths (Table 1). For europium, with a larger cation size (131 pm), we find a slightly larger lattice constant (less than 1%), similar deviation from the ideal 180 ° iodine–metal–iodine bond and very similar metal–iodine bond length with lead perovskite.
On the other hand, for the cations with size more similar to that of the Pb2+ cation, viz. thulium, ytterbium, and dysprosium, we find similar iodine–metal bond lengths to each other but still shorter than lead–iodide due to their different electronegativity which makes the halogen–metal bond less covalent (more ionic). Different halogen–metal–halogen bond angles impact upon the lattice constant and consequently the band gap of the perovskite52 however other important effects are the metal work function and electronegativity;23 these properties will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Similar lattice constants and crystal structures of the lanthanide perovskites have a key importance for their implementation in tandem applications or charge selective layers together with MAPbI3. It is beneficial for the contact and crystalline quality of vapour deposited thin films of lead perovskite in a heterojunction configuration, or in having less thermally induced interfacial stress in between the layers.
3.2 Electronic structure
Our calculated band gaps of the investigated compounds are reported in Table 1. The estimated bandgaps for the lanthanide (Eu, Dy, Tm, Yb) perovskite compounds are 2.68, 3.23, 2.39 and 1.98 eV respectively showing the possibility for implementation as photo-absorbers in tandem configurations, detectors, or charge separating materials. There are uncertainties about the validity of the DFT calculated band gaps for the perovskite solar cell materials, however it has been shown that the PBE functional can estimate the band gap correctly for the lead compound.53 For the lanthanide perovskites investigated here, we discussed the sensitivity of the band gap values to details of the implemented DFT+U approach in detail in the next section.
We thus have chosen Hubbard U = 3 eV as our optimized value for the presented electronic structure (see Section 3.3, Fig. 4 and ref. 51 for more details and discussions). Our calculations for MALaI3 with (U = 3 eV) show that the estimation of the DFT calculated band gap (2.68 eV) corresponds well to the experimental band gap (2.78 eV) for the known reference compound (here MAEuI3)48 which of course cannot be certified at this stage for other lanthanide perovskites, which have not been synthesized thus far.
The partial density of states and band structure plots are presented in Fig. 3. In agreement with previous reports, we find main contribution of the halogen ions to the top of the VB and the metal to the bottom of the CB, a picture, which can partly be altered by DFT+U calculations due to the inclusion of f-electrons (Fig. 2 and 4). Here, in addition to the bottom of the CB, the top of the VB also has its main contribution from the lanthanide localized f-electrons in which the amount of the hybridization between the iodide and lanthanide localized states in the VB would be dependent on the chosen Hubbard U value (see Section 3.3). This implies that the lowest energy electronic transition from the VB to the CB has a localized nature within the lanthanide inner f-electron that are located in the periodic lattice of the perovskite crystal and could potentially have very interesting applications in semiconductor devices. This finding is in agreement with photoluminescence measurements of MAEuI3, (ref. 48) who found that the localized VB to CB electronic transition kept the optical absorption robust to the quantum confinement effects.

Furthermore, all the lanthanide compounds have similar partial density of states due to the very similar electronegativity and electronic configurations. For the same reason, one can see very similar charge density profiles for the lanthanide perovskites with just slight differences due to the different electronegativities (Fig. 2). The main difference between the considered lanthanides is the number of inner shell f-electrons. These electrons are of more localized nature and have minor impacts on the chemical bond with iodide, but affect the electronic properties significantly (see Fig. 3 and 4). The work function of the corresponding lanthanide is a determining factor for the final position of the band edge in the corresponding perovskite structure, this is achieved by aligning the H 1s, C 2s and N 2s states (from the CH3NH3), resulting in a zero energy value corresponding to the CH3NH3PbI3 VB edge. The more covalent bond character found for the lead perovskite in comparison to the lanthanide perovskite is obvious from the more uniform distribution of charge density along the bond and higher density of f-electrons present along the chemical bond (Fig. 2 and S1†). Here the iodide lanthanide bond is less covalent compared to the pure lead perovskite Pb–I bond (Fig. S1†) which explain the higher gap of the lanthanide perovskite compared to MAPbI3. A charge density profile of MAPbI3 is presented in Fig. S1 of the ESI† for comparison.

In principle, the geometrical factors in combination with the electronegativity of the metal should be the key quantities in determining the estimated band gap;23,53 lower metal electronegativities result in higher gaps since the chemical bonds with halogen will be more ionic. However, such an interpretation is also somewhat problematic since (Pauling) electronegativity is only strictly defined for covalent bonds. On the other hand, considering the localized character of the f-electrons, a tight binding approach can be used to analyse the overlap integrals between the atomic orbitals ( – halogen–metal) and electron wave function (ψ) and explain the modification of the electronic energies (E(k)) that depends on the corresponding atomic energies (ε)23 bond angles and the tilting of the metal halogen octahedra (presented in Fig. 1).  
Here the lower bandgap of lead perovskite and trends in band gap values of lanthanide perovskites are in agreement with this picture and follow the trend of the electronegativities/work functions and, to the second order, the geometrical factors (Table 1).
We can extract the effective masses of the electrons () and holes () from the band structure calculations to quantify the intrinsic hole and electron conductivities of the material (Fig. 3, eqn (1) and (2)). The effective masses of the charge carriers are derived from the second derivative of the corresponding energy state in k-space (E(k)) versus crystal momentum k. The similarity of the band gap curvature between the lanthanides according to our DFT calculations mean that we expect very similar charge carrier effective masses for all lanthanide perovskites with a decent electron effective mass but high hole effective mass reported in Table 2. The electron effective mass on the other hand is slightly lower in lanthanide perovskites compared to the alkaline earth perovskites which could be due to higher work function/electronegativity of the metal. The same arguments for the implementation in the charge selective layers presented in ref. 23 is valid here as well. (1) (2)

3.3 Evaluation of the bandgap and the impacts of the Hubbard U value
The accuracy of the PBE band gap for MAPbI3 has been discussed and the surprisingly good agreement between scalar relativistic GGA band gaps and the experimental values has been explained as being due to an error cancellation coming from neglecting the full spin orbit coupling in scalar relativistic calculation.53 A similar cancellation has been observed for other metals such as for Bi in MA3Bi2I9 perovskite19 albeit to a lesser extent. In fact, scalar relativistic GGA calculations have been widely considered as an accurate method for the prediction of the band gap for lead perovskite. Here for the lanthanide perovskites, however, due to the presence of f-electrons, other complications can arise and one must also consider how the interactions of localized f-electrons are treated. To investigate the sensitivity of our results towards the choice of U-value in the DFT+U method, we have made additional calculations using a range of U-values from 3 to 5 eV (these are typical U values for lanthanide compounds).
The DFT+U calculated values of the band gap for (Eu, Dy, Tm, Yb) perovskite compounds were estimated to be 2.68, 3.23, 2.39 and 1.98 eV respectively for U = 3 and 3.34, 3.63, 3.14 and 2.93 eV respectively for U = 5. Different U values can shift the bands corresponding to f-electrons having no impact on all the other bands, which is schematically shown in Fig. 4. However it is clear from Fig. 2 and 4 that the f-electrons have a pronounced impact on the band gap due to their clear contribution to the CB or VB edges. Since there is no experimental report for the Dy, Tm and Yb iodide perovskites yet, the exact U values for these compounds are unknown. However for the MAEuI3, a U value close to 3 correctly reproduced the experimental gap reported in ref. 48.51 It is also obvious that the nature of VB edge depends strongly on the implemented U value and comparison to the experiment is needed. All the band structure presented above have been repeated with DFT+U (U = 5, Fig. S4 of ESI†) and the results show that the charge carrier effective masses and the lattice constants changes only very slightly (Tables S1–S3 of ESI†). The conclusion is that occupied f-electrons contribute to the chemical bonding and the selection of proper U value is important with respect to the properties of these compounds however from our calculations we predict that a Hubbard U value close to 3 would be optimum for the all the investigated lanthanides as well.
4 Conclusions
To explore possible candidates for solar energy applications in the perovskite family of materials, we have studied a number of compounds which contain a lanthanide metal instead of lead. The results show theoretically stable compounds with bandgaps close to 2.0–3.2 eV which indicates that they may be implemented either as charge selective layer or solar absorbers in tandem applications. Effective masses as low as 0.3 free electron mass was obtained for lanthanide iodide perovskites.
The basic electronic structure properties of the compounds have been presented and the validity and sensitivity of the DFT+U approach has been examined by comparison of different Hubbard U values, which shows that the f-electrons has a prominent impact on the optical properties of the compounds, where in parallel the change in electronegativity/work function is determining factor for the bandgap as well. Furthermore, the different octahedral distortion and tilting comes in from the size of the lanthanide cation. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied states in the VB and CB of MAEuI3 belonged to the Eu 4f and 5d electrons respectively and showing the importance of implemented U value for proper prediction of band edges and physical properties. Although local tilting occurs, they have very similar lattice constants to the lead perovskite, making it possible to partly exchange the lead within the tetragonal lattice. The presented results show an interesting class of perovskite materials that can be introduced in solar cell applications as well as possible new possibilities for other interesting applications.
