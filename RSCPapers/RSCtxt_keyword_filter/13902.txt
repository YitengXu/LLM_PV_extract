    , Accepted 1st December 2020First published on 21st December 2020AbstractOrganohalide lead perovskites (PVKs) are among the leading materials for the fabrication of high-efficiency and low-cost photovoltaic devices. Deposition of a suitable electron transport layer (ETL) plays a pivotal role in the manufacturing of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Among all reported ETLs, zinc oxide (ZnO) has not been developed properly compared with its counterparts such as TiO2 and SnO2. In this work, we fabricated PSCs based on low-temperature solution-processed ZnO nanoparticles under ambient conditions. The degradation of PVK films on the ZnO ETL has been widely reported in the literature. We demonstrate that the localization of positive ions resulting from hydroxyl groups (–OH) present at the ZnO surface is a reason for this issue. In order to deactivate these groups, we treated the surface of the ZnO ETL with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) before the deposition of the PVK film. We found that CNTs modify the ZnO surface and stop the potential reaction between the ZnO and PVK films. The results demonstrate that the CNT modification of ZnO resulted in a PVK film with larger grains without any pinholes. Upon incorporation of CNTs into our devices, we improved the power conversion efficiency of the PSC from 15.05% to 18.79%, possibly due to the higher quality of the PVK film and improved charge extraction properties. Most importantly, PSCs based on the ZnO/CNT ETL showed better ambient and thermal stability compared to the reference PSCs.
1. Introduction
The state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has exceeded 25.5%.1 Despite this, outdoor stability remains the main obstacle for the commercialization of PSCs. Modification of the interfaces between the perovskite layer and charge transport layers is investigated in several research studies in the quest for high stability PSCs. Interface engineering has enhanced the efficiency by surpassing charge carrier recombination and facilitating carrier injection.2–6 N-Type semiconductors such as titanium oxide (TiO2) have been widely used as an electron transport layer (ETL).7–9 However, the deposition of mesoporous TiO2 layers requires a high temperature (≈500 °C) sintering process.10–12 In addition, the TiO2 ETL suffers from high surface defects, poor conductivity, and low UV stability.13 Recently, using tin oxide (SnO2) films has attracted considerable interest because of their suitable band-alignment matching, high transparency, high charge mobility, and low defect density.14–16 However, planar PSCs based on pristine SnO2 films still have defects at the perovskite/SnO2 interface, which resulted in imbalanced carrier transfer.17 Another candidate for the fabrication of a suitable ETL is based on zinc oxide (ZnO) known for its high electron mobility (compared to TiO2). However, ZnO-based devices have shown lower thermal stability and lower performance compared to PSCs with TiO2 and SnO2.18–20 ZnO thin films can be spin-coated without requiring sintering steps, suitable for deposition on thermo-sensitive substrates such as plastics.21 ZnO has been well-studied in PSCs and performed extremely well with PCEs reaching 15.7% with low-temperature processes.22 Doping of ZnO with different materials (such as B, Al, Ga, and In) is a conventional method to enhance the electrical conductivity and optical transmittance of ZnO thin films.23 For instance, Tseng et al. reported a sputtered Al-doped ZnO thin film as an ETL, which yielded a PCE of 17.6%.17 Mg-modified ZnO nanorods are reported to improve the recombination process in ZnO-based devices.24 Another alternative technique to enhance the charge transport and the electron lifetime of ZnO is the incorporation of carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene into the ZnO layer.25 To our knowledge, carbon nanomaterials have infrequently been loaded in ZnO films for use as an ETL. Tavakoli et al. used photoelectrodes of ZnO/rGO quantum dots as the ETL and obtained a PCE of 15% due to the enhancement in electron collection quickly from the perovskite layer because of reducing carrier recombination.26 Chandrasekhar and coworkers showed that the ETL of graphene-doped ZnO can boost PSC efficiency to 16.8%.27 The stated studies focused on the enhancement of electronic merits of the ETL. But, the hysteresis and long-term stability concerns have not been well investigated in these reports. Despite the successful use of graphene and its derivatives to increase the efficiency of ZnO-based PSCs, there is no attempt for applying CNTs at the interface of ZnO/MAPI3. Therefore, the combination of highly conductive CNTs and ZnO NPs as an ETL in PSCs could be another approach to enhance the electron transport pathway and the device performance.
In the present work, we address the key challenges of using the ZnO ETL by applying CNTs on the ZnO/PVK interface. We improved the perovskite crystallinity and charge transfer properties in the PSC. We found that by using a concentration of 2% CNT, the PCE of the PSCs is improved up to 18.79% with negligible hysteresis, much better than that of the devices with pristine ZnO (15.05%). In addition, the CNT-doping of ZnO enhances the stability of PSCs due to better film-forming. Consequently, PSCs with CNT-modified ZnO show long-term stability with only 10% PCE loss compared with the control device (80% PCE loss) upon storing the samples in ambient air for 3000 h.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.9%), and Li-TFSI were provided by Alfa Aesar. Indium tin oxide (ITO) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were ordered from Dyesol. Raw multi-walled CNTs (97%) with diameter ∼8 to 30 nm were provided by Shenzhen Nanotech Port Company. Spiro-OMeTAD, chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), and lead iodide (PbI2) were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich. Note that all other materials were provided by Merck and used as received.
2.2 Solar cell fabrication
Patterned-ITO glass was cleaned employing successively diluted water–soap, IPA, and ethanol in an ultrasonic cleaner for several minutes. Then, ITO was modified with UV–ozone for 10 min and dried at 80 °C for 20 min. The co-precipitation process was used to prepare ZnO-NPs.28 100 mg of ZnO-NPs were dispersed in 50 mL of chloroform with various amounts of CNTs (0%, 1%, 2%, and 3%). After that, the CNT/ZnO mixture was deposited on ITO at 5000 rpm for 40 s and baked at 75 °C for 20 min. After spin-coating of ZnO, to improve the quality of the MAPI3 layer, 50 mL of dimethylformamide was spun on the ZnO layer at 5000 rpm before MAPI3 deposition. For the PVK layer, the first 0.458 g of PbI2 and 0.065 g of DMSO were inserted in 0.5 g of dimethylformamide and stirred for 1 h at RT. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, 50 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of isopropanol. The PbI2 dispersion was deposited above the wetted ZnO film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The MAI mixture was spin-coated onto the PbI2 layer at 5000 rpm for 40 s and baked at 120 °C for 20 min. For deposition of the HTL, 65 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD was dispersed in 2 mL of CB having 16.5 μL LiTFSI/ACN (480 mg mL−1) and 26.5 μL TBP, followed by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 25 s. Au (70 nm) back films were sputtered to finish the PSC structure.
2.3 Characterization
A transmission electron microscope (TEM, EM208, Philips) was employed to characterize the CNT morphology. The crystallinity of the films was measured employing XRD (Bruker, D8 advance). The chemical bonds of samples were measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker). UV-vis absorption was conducted using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics). The morphologies of MAPbI3 perovskites were measured via field emission-SEM (FESEM, MIRA3). PL spectroscopy (Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence) was used to obtain the optical characteristics of PVK films. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of ETLs were measured using an X-ray source (1486.6 eV) of monochromated Al Kα (ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Scientific). J–V tests of cells were performed via a Keithley Model 2400 with an AM 1.5G one solar system. The devices were masked with an area of 0.09 cm2. Charge generation and extraction were measured using external quantum efficiency (EQE, Bunkoukeiki CEP-1500). The Nyquist curves were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (electrochemical workstation, Zennium 400147). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) was recorded at 760 nm employing excitation with a 478 nm light pulse from a Delta Flex Fluorescence Lifetime System (Horiba Scientific Com.). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) tests were carried out using a helium lamp (energy = 21.2 eV).
3. Results and discussion
Metallic CNTs act as recombination centers in ZnO ETLs and produce Schottky junctions with semiconducting CNTs.29 Thus, it is critical to employ CNTs with high purity for use inside ZnO ETLs. Chemical purification of the as-prepared CNTs was performed utilizing a sulfuric/nitric acid as reported elsewhere without any surfactant agents.30 Also, during the purification process, the CNTs were functionalized with different hydrophilic groups, which are beneficial for excellent linkage with the PVK layer (more details for characterization of CNTs are shown in Fig. S1†). As is known in the literature, the surfactant or nitric/sulfuric agents could have an effect on the performance of PSCs.31,32 The modified-CNT with a H2SO4/HNO3 mixture was filtered to eliminate any possible unwanted agent as it may impact our fabricated devices.
An MAPbI3 film was deposited on a planar ZnO ETL containing different concentrations of CNTs. The role of the CNT dopant includes surface modification of the ETL to suppress the activation of hydroxyl groups (–OH). Many hydrophilic agents are present at the surface of the ZnO layer, which can be reduced via using CNTs to hinder the potential reaction of PVK and ZnO films. Therefore, the CNTs could decrease the degradation of MAPI3 deposited above the ZnO film. A standard architecture (n–i–p) was adopted by using ZnO ETLs as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The device performance of the PSCs was evaluated by acquiring current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 1b). It was observed that even a small amount of CNT doping into ZnO resulted in a higher short-current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared to the device fabricated on pristine ZnO (reference). The best performance was achieved for a device corresponding to the ZnO-containing 2% CNT layer. The PSC with a pure ZnO layer showed a Jsc and Voc of 20.48 mA cm−2 and 0.98 V, respectively, which reached 22.61 mA cm−2 and 1.06 V for the PSC with ZnO-containing 2% CNT. The values of the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. In particular, the reference PSC showed a PCE of 15.05% with a fill factor (FF) of 75% while the champion device yielded a PCE of 18.79% with a FF of 80%. The enhancement of the photovoltaic parameters can originate from the various phenomena related to interfacial properties between the PVK and ETL as well as better charge carrier mobility. The integrated current density corresponding to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values for the reference and champion PSCs is correlated with the scanned Jsc (Fig. 1c). The n–i–p architecture usually comes with hysteresis behavior of the J–V curve. We investigated the hysteresis by measuring J–V curves from the forward and reverse scans of the reference and champion devices. As indicated in Fig. 1d, the champion device showed negligible hysteresis compared to the reference. Therefore, one can conclude that the doping of ZnO with CNTs leads to the reduction of charge carrier traps, which effectively reduces the hysteresis effect. The details of the photovoltaic parameters of forward and reverse scans corresponding to both the devices are listed in Table S1.† In addition, a statistical study has been performed on the PCSs from various batches and is presented in Fig. S2.† We observed a slight variance between the maximum and average parameters for all the PSCs, which is sufficient to be considered within the standard error during the experiment.

To understand the role of CNTs a series of characterization studies based on pristine ZnO and 2% CNT/ZnO films were performed. The surface topographies of ZnO and ZnO/CNT were evaluated using AFM images. As appears in Fig. S3a and b,† the AFM images of both ZnO and CNT/ZnO films show good coverage and uniformity. The ZnO/CNT film showed slightly higher surface roughness (12.78 nm) on ITO glass compared to the pristine ZnO film (10.43 nm), indicating the presence of CNTs on the surface. This roughness change may affect the deposited PVK layer morphology. To further evaluate the quality of the ZnO/CNT film, top-view SEM and XRD measurements were conducted. Fig. S3c† shows the top-view SEM image of the ZnO/CNT layer with a very fine layer with high coverage and uniformity, which is suitable for device fabrication. Moreover, Fig. S2d† shows the XRD spectrum of the ZnO/CNT film, where the diffraction peaks of the ZnO/CNT pattern are related to the hexagonal phase of ZnO (JCPDS no. 36-1451) and the graphitic structure (JCPDS no. 01-0646) of CNTs (2θ = 25.73°) supports the formation of the hybrid structure.33–35 The UV-vis spectrum of the ZnO/CNT hybrid (Fig. 2a) exhibits a slightly red shift of 5 nm to longer wavelengths (an enhanced absorption edge) most likely due to its larger grain size and CNT absorption. From the UV-visible results, we found that the CNT slightly reduces the transmittance of the ZnO film, and therefore it does not affect Jsc. The steady-state PL spectra of pristine ETLs are shown in Fig. 2b. The PL measurements reveal a remarkable suppression of the peak intensity of the ZnO/CNT film. This quenching effect in the ZnO/CNT hybrid manifests the positive role of the CNTs in the reduction of the recombination process.26 The CNTs are able to form strong chemical bonding with ZnO and to bridge between ZnO and PVK (electron acceptor). Another advantage of adding CNTs into the ZnO film is the deactivation of the surface –OH agents.13 XPS measurements were conducted to evaluate the effect of CNTs on deactivating the –OH agents in ZnO films. The high-resolution O1s spectra corresponding to the pristine ZnO film are shown in Fig. 2c. The O 1s spectra contain two major peaks located at 529.87 eV and 531.85 eV attributed to the O 1s level and –OH agents in the ZnO ETL, respectively.25 In this regard, the ZnO ETL has many –OH agents on their surface that could degrade the MAPI3 PVK layer. This reaction represents the main issues for the degradation of perovskite into lead iodide leading to interfacial issues at the ZnO/perovskite interface. Furthermore, we consider that the –OH agents attract the positive ions existing near the ZnO ETL in our devices. The XPS spectrum indicates that this group is anticipated to induce the accumulation of the positive ions at the PVK/ETL interface. By CNT incorporation into the ZnO film the peak of the –OH agent is significantly decreased (Fig. 2d). This lower amount of –OH may lead to the less decomposition of MAPI3 at the interface with the ZnO layer.

Fig. 3a and b show the field emission-SEM images of PVK films deposited on pristine ZnO and ZnO/CNT. The PVK film deposited on pure ZnO shows a small grain size with pinholes between the grains (red circled). We observe that the pinholes are suppressed in addition to an increase in the grain size of PVK after CNT doping of ZnO. The results are consistent with XRD spectra, as presented in Fig. 3c. XRD showed significant improvement in the crystallization of the PVK film deposited on ZnO/CNT in comparison to the one deposited on pure ZnO. The peaks located at 14.1°, 28.08°, and 31.6° can be assigned to planes of (110), (220) and (310) corresponding to the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 phase, respectively.36 The PVK film deposited on ZnO/CNT showed the highest intensities of those characteristics peaks related to the enhanced crystallinity of the PVK phase. Thus, a moderate content of CNTs contributes to a better crystallized PVK film. CNTs have oxygen agents such as –OH and CO, which can generate strong bonds with the PVK, ensuring closer contact with PVK grains and better crystallization.37 Furthermore, the PVK films showed a peak located at 12.2° corresponding to PbI2.2 The intensity of the PbI2 peak for the film deposited on CNT-doped ZnO was insignificant compared to that of the PVK deposited on pure ZnO. This could be the result of the –OH deactivation from ZnO after CNT doping, which mitigated the decomposition and pinholes of the PVK films. Fig. 3d presents the UV-Vis spectra of the PVK films deposited on ZnO layers. The results indicate no considerable shift in the band edge which showed that the bandgap (Eg) of the PVK films remained constant regardless of the ZnO layer.

Steady-state PL and TRPL measurements were performed to comparatively evaluate the effects of different ZnO layers on the charge carrier extraction behavior of the PVK films (Fig. 4a and b). The emission peak for both samples was located at ∼783 nm and no considerable shifts were detected after doping of the ZnO layer. However, we observed that the steady-state PL intensity dramatically quenched for the PVK film deposited on the CNT-doped ZnO layer, suggesting a better charge extraction compared to the film deposited on the pristine ZnO layer.38 The estimated carrier lifetimes from the captured TRPL were found to be 38.57 ns and 26.45 ns for PVK/ZnO and PVK/CNT-doped ZnO, respectively. Therefore, faster extraction of electrons from the MAPI3 layer to the ZnO layer is improved by the separation of active charges in the ZnO/PVK interfacial region. Hence, the electron and hole recombinations are greatly restrained, resulting in higher Jsc. To evaluate the impact of CNT doping on the interfacial properties of PVK films, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed. As shown in Fig. 4c, the Nyquist plots of PSCs consist of two semicircles. An apparent change is observed between the plots corresponding to the devices. Considering that the radius of the semicircle is proportional to the internal resistance at the interfaces of the PSC, the radius of the semicircles of the PSCs with the CNT-doped ZnO photoelectrode is smaller than that of the device with the pure ZnO photoelectrode, implying that ZnO/CNT suppresses charge-transport resistance.39 The calculated values of real impedance (Z′1 and Z′2) are decreased from 2.9 Ω and 26.2 Ω to 1.6 Ω and 23.4 Ω after incorporation of the CNT layer (Table S2†), which could be due to the improvement of the carrier concentration and mobility.40 Tafel tests were conducted to evaluate the leakage current inside our devices (Fig. 4d). The dark current density of the device with CNT-containing ZnO is lower than that of the PSC with a ZnO-only film. It can be proved that the leakage current of the PSC with the ZnO/CNT ETL is greatly decreased, suggesting the retarded charge recombination and suppressed defects of te MAPI3 film. In addition, the threshold voltage of the devices with the CNT:ZnO film was ≈0.9 V, which implies a lowered charge-transfer barrier and better electron transport than the devices with the ZnO-only film, as proved by the higher Jsc value in comparison with the control devices.41,42

Fig. 5a presents the UPS spectra of the CNT-doped ZnO photoelectrodes. The valence band (EVB) and conduction band (ECB) values of the CNT-doped ZnO film are determined from the binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) and onset region (Eonset). The work function (ɸ) of the CNT-doped ZnO film was calculated to be −4.2 eV from ɸ = Ecutoff − 21.2 (incoming photon energy from He irradiation).14EVB was estimated to be −7.7 eV for ZnO/CNT, which was determined from EVB = ɸ − Eonset. By using the formula of ECB = EVB + Eg, the ECB value was found to be −4.24 eV and the corresponding band alignment is presented in Fig. 5b. As it appears, a more matching ECB of CNT-doped ZnO would enhance electron injection between the MAPI3 film and the ZnO ETL, resulting in higher electron mobility.8 In our PSC, the photo-induced electrons inject from the CNT into the ZnO because of the lower energy level of ZnO relative to the CNT. CNTs can also behave as an electron funnel, which contributes to the efficient separation of active electron–hole pairs. We have found that the –OH agents of the ZnO film (seen Fig. 5c) cause the reaction between the PVK layer and ETL in the interfacial region, which leads to the decomposition of the PVK layer. This instability issue resulting in small grains with many pinholes in the PVK layer may be the main reason for the low PCE of ZnO-based PSCs because of a high recombination process at grain boundaries. Therefore, CNTs suppress surface carrier recombination by deactivation of the –OH agents at the ZnO surface. Also, the low performance of ZnO-based PSCs can be related to ion migration and accumulation, which act as recombination sites in our devices (Fig. S4†). We attributed the ion migration in the MAPI3 film to the localized ionic charges at the negatively charged surface of ZnO. Therefore, the number of electrons transporting to ZnO decreased due to these recombination sites consequently resulting in large hysteresis (Fig. 1d). To prevent the formation of recombination sites at the ZnO/MAPI3 interface, the ZnO ETL was modified with CNTs (Fig. 5d). The CNT additive can develop strong chemical bonding with ZnO and act as a good electron accumulator. The addition of the CNT significantly suppressed the localization of the positive ions at the interface due to the deactivation of –OH agents from the ZnO surface, resulting in a remarkable reduction in the hysteresis effect of our devices (Fig. 1d).

Stability is one of the main issues for the manufacturing of perovskite solar cells. It is known that perovskite films are sensitive to environmental humidity, temperature, and light. Also, the low-temperature processed ZnO film is rich in –OH agents and/or residual defects, which could lead to degradation of the PVK layer into methylamine and lead iodide.18,43 In this regard, a two-step spin coating process can reduce the defects at the surface of ZnO. However, some interface problems between PVK and the ZnO ETL were detected as presented in the XPS results. For the deposition of PVK layers onto these ZnO ETLs, semiconducting CNTs were used. Such decomposition can be prevented when ZnO ETLs with enhanced interface contact and reduced defects are used. The fabricated devices were further evaluated by studying the stability with the elapsed time. We confirmed that the CNT-doping of ZnO enhanced the stability of the perovskite films and subsequently PSCs. In detail, the samples were kept under room conditions in the dark and then we monitored the stability. XRD measurements were conducted to evaluate the stability of the crystallinity of PVK layers. As presented in Fig. 6a and b, the intensity of the PbI2 peak (*) for the perovskite deposited on pure ZnO increased gradually after 30 days. XRD revealed that degradation corresponding to the decomposition of the crystalline perovskite phase into PbI2 did not exist for the PVK/CNT–ZnO device. The addition of the CNT dopant into ZnO resulted in significantly higher stability of the perovskite film where no considerable decomposition was observed after 60 days. The operational stability of the PSCs was evaluated under ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 6c, the device corresponding to CNT-doped ZnO maintained excellent stability (90%) after 3000 h under atmospheric conditions. In contrary, the device corresponding to pure ZnO lost 80% of its initial PCE after 3000 h of the aging test. The stability test of the device performance was performed at a higher temperature of 75 °C. Fig. 6d illustrates that PSCs with pure and CNT-doped ZnO layers preserved 60% and 90% of their initial performance after 1000 h under heating. Our results clearly show that CNT-doping of ZnO is beneficial not only for performance but also for the stability of perovskite solar cells.

4. Conclusion
In the work presented herein, we demonstrated that the interfacial engineering of the ZnO ETL with CNTs could improve the performance hysteresis and stability of PSCs. We considered that the main reason for the reduced J–V hysteresis and decomposition is the deactivation of hydroxyl agents, which attract positive ion charges at the corresponding interfaces. By adding 2% CNTs to the ZnO ETL, we yield a PCE of 18.79% in planar devices, which is higher than that of the reference devices (15.05%). By employing this surface treatment method, the device with CNTs preserves 90% of its first performance after 3000 h of storing in ambient air. Moreover, the incorporation of CNTs significantly enhanced high-temperature stability. Our results will furnish understanding of improvements of the hysteresis effect and instability of ZnO-based PSCs.
