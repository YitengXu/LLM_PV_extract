    , Accepted 22nd July 2019First published on 23rd July 2019AbstractSince ion migration and interaction with external contacts has been regarded as one of the origins for photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) hysteresis and phase segregation in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under operational condition, control of ionic movement in organic–inorganic halide perovskites presents a big challenge for achieving hysteresis-free and stable PSCs. As a universal method, potassium doping into bulk perovskite films to minimize or eliminate the hysteresis was proposed. Here, we report direct observation of moderately retarded ion migration in K+-doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 perovskite by in situ photoluminescence (PL) imaging. However, more impressive is the effect on the kinetics for generation of the ionic double layer in the vicinity of the contacts as it is reduced by two orders of magnitude on the time scale when devices are doped with K+ as detected by impedance spectroscopy. A significantly reduced hysteresis in the K+-doped perovskite is responsible for more prolonged stability exhibiting ∼96% of initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 22 days than relatively short-lived perovskites undoped with K+ ions. This work highlights the clear correlation of ion migration and a fast generation of the double layer close to the contacts with severe hysteresis and long-term instability in PSCs and the importance of K+ ions in reducing the kinetics affecting the ionic attachment to the contact surface.
Introduction
Since the advent of solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% and 500 h-long-term-stability in 2012,2 following two seed reports on perovskite-sanitized solar cells in 2009 and 2011,3,4 perovskite photovoltaics have been rapidly developed. As a result, a PCE as high as 23.7% was authorized by Newport Corp. as a proxy for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.5 Although superb efficiency has been achieved from PSCs, an issue, however, such as mismatch of current density (J)–voltage (V) curves depending on scan directions, termed J–V hysteresis, has been critically debated since 2014 (ref. 6) because the hysteresis could accelerate the instability of PSCs.7 The underlying factors affecting the J–V hysteresis include ferroelectric behavior associated with dipole orientation,8–10 native defects of perovskite,11–13 and accumulation of charged species at interfaces due to ion migration.14–18 Methodologies to suppress the hysteresis have been proposed via enhancing the charge transfer process at interfacial contacts,19–21 reduction or passivation of defects19,22–25 or preventing ions from migration by grain boundary passivation.26–30 Heretofore, intrinsic defects of perovskite materials and interfaces have been suggested to play a more critical role in the hysteresis for highly efficient PSCs with substantially reduced hysteresis reported recently. Nevertheless, complete removal of hysteresis is hard to accomplish under continuous solar cell operating conditions because slow ion conduction is an intrinsic characteristic of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites.31–33 Recently, instead of indirect approaches such as interface passivation or compositional engineering, direct control of ionic movement has been considered to be more important because phase segregation and/or degradation in cation and/or anion mixed perovskites might be expected under operational conditions.7,34–38 Therefore, a promising way to control the ionic movement effectively in bulk perovskite layers is essential for developing commercially available high-efficiency and long-term-stable PSCs. It was reported that a small amount of rubidium cations in a Cs/MA/FA mixed perovskite could improve the PCE and photostability of PSCs.39 In addition, a small amount of potassium ions was found to improve the PCE of MAPbI3 based PSCs.40 Micro-mole scale potassium ions with respect to one mole of perovskite were first reported to have a universal effect on reducing or eliminating the J–V hysteresis regardless of perovskite composition, which was explained by prevention of Frenkel defects in bulk perovskite due to potassium ions stabilized in interstitial octahedral vacancies.1 Stranks and coworkers have shown that potassium inhibits transient photoinduced ion-migration processes and prevents halide segregation both eventually reducing hysteresis in solar cells and improving stability.41 Alternatively, Segawa and coworkers showed that a slight change in band positions, as measured by photoelectron spectroscopy, minimizes charge accumulation at the TiO2 interface.42
The ionic double layer is a structure that appears on the surface of a material when exposed to a liquid-like material. We have reported previously that in the presence of an electrical field hybrid perovskite materials behave like a liquid leading to ionic migration.43,44 These ions accumulate at the external contact and form a double layer like in classic liquid electrochemistry. The observation of less- or non-hysteric behavior was complemented by the use of different physical techniques. However, the precise formation kinetics of the double layer has not been reported in the presence of K+ in operating devices which explains why potassium ions suppressed the hysteresis and ion migration. In this study, we show direct evidence that non-hysteric behavior is attributed to the kinetic stabilization of the ionic double layer in the perovskite at the interface with external contacts. Perovskite/external contacts are studied by advanced impedance spectroscopy (IS) and electroabsorption (EA) spectroscopy. Alternatively, the ion migration in bulk perovskites is studied by in situ photoluminescence (PL) imaging and calculation of the ion mobility shows that the effect of the K+ doping only moderately decreases the ion mobility. Correlation between the stabilization of the ionic double layer and reduced supply of ions at the interfaces enables the achievement of hysteresis-free devices with increased stability.
Results and discussion
To investigate the effect of the potassium ion dopant in (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125, mesoscopic normal PSCs were prepared including mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) and spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) as shown in the inset of Fig. 1A. Forward and reverse scanned J–V curves are recorded depending on the scan rate to understand the scan rate dependent hysteresis. Fig. 1A and B show J–V curves for undoped and K+-doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 recorded at a scan rate of 13 mV s−1, where the forward–reverse scan is repeated for 5 cycles. Faster scan rates of 130 mV s−1 and 13000 mV s−1 are also used (Fig. S1†). Photovoltaic properties depending on the scan rate are listed in Table S1,† where the device structure is FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au (bl in bl-TiO2 stands for the blocking layer). Control devices without K+ doping show severe hysteric behavior and the J–V hysteric structure depends on the scan rate, whereas almost no hysteric property is observed upon K+ doping regardless of the scan rate. At a very high scan rate of 13000 mV s−1, the control device shows small hysteresis that is unchanged with the number of cycles (Fig. S1A†). When scan rate is reduced to 130 mV s−1, hysteresis is pronounced but still invariable with cycles (Fig. S1B†). As compared to scan rates of 130–13000 mV s−1, a large hysteresis is observed along with its strong dependence on repeating cycles at a lower scan rate of 13 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 1A. It is noted that the starting point (bias voltage showing the difference in current between reverse and forward scans) from which hysteresis emerges is gradually decreased as the scan rate is decreased from 13000 mV s−1 to 130 mV s−1 and to 13 mV s−1. These series of changes in the hysteresis phenomenon with different scan rates and a huge change in J–V curves at a slow scan rate are expected to be caused by the ion movement as discussed later. Thus, negligible hysteresis was observed for the K+-doped perovskite regardless of the scan rate and scanning cycles (Fig. 1B, S1C and D†). In order to rule out possible contributions of the Li+ additive used in spiro-MeOTAD and the external contact layer which can act as a pathway of ions, as Li+ ions have been reported to migrate through the bulk of the perovskite layer45,46 and I− ions migrate through the spiro-MeOTAD layer,47 more simple configurations (FTO/perovskite/Au) confirm the hysteresis suppression as shown in Fig. S2.† The movement of ion species can lead to the formation of dipoles at the external interfaces and thereby modification in built-in potential,14,30 which might correlate with hysteresis. This dynamic nature can be further probed by EA spectroscopy as it is known to be a noninvasive method to determine the built-in potential in solar cells which is induced by interfacial dipoles.16,48,49 Fig. S3† shows the change in the DC voltage dependent EA signal (ΔR/R) of PSCs employing perovskite without and with K+ doping measured at a photon energy of 1.63 eV in reverse and forward directions, respectively. Briefly, the EA signal (ΔR/R), i.e. the change in the intensity of the reflected probe light in response to the external electric field modulation, vanishes when the external DC voltage compensates for the built-in potential.50–52 The characterized built-in potential reflects the influence of the accumulated ions at the opposite interfaces, i.e. perovskite/ETL or HTL.16 For the control device, a built-in potential is established at Vforward = 1.00 ± 0.05 V for the forward direction and at Vreverse = 1.15 ± 0.05 V for the reverse direction. It is clear that the hysteresis behavior is observed during the EA measurement. However, for the device with K+-doped perovskite, the built-in potential is estimated to be almost identical regardless of the scan direction (Vforward = 1.15 ± 0.05 V and Vreverse = 1.10 ± 0.05 V), which indicates that the internal electric field is invariant with the scan direction due to less charge accumulation. To check the stability under continuous operating conditions, the steady-state current density and PCE were measured for 100000 s at the maximum power point under one sun illumination at 290 K in dry air (relative humidity (RH) = 1.1%) as shown in Fig. 1C and D. The steady-state PCE of the control device decreases from 16.66% at t = 200 s to 8.13% at t = 100000 s (51.2% decrement), while the perovskite doped with K+ ions is much more stable because of only 13% decrement after 100000 s from 19.05% at t = 200 s to 16.55% at t = 100000 s. Stability under one sun illumination was tested for devices, which were stored in dry air (RH = 1.1%) under LED white light for certain intervals between measurements (24 h-interval from 0 h to 96 h and 48 h-interval from 96 h to 524 h). As shown in Fig. 1E, the K+ doped perovskite maintains its PCE up to 95.9% (reverse scan) and 94.3% (forward scan) of its initial value after 528 h, while the PCE of the control device is significantly reduced to 75.6% (RS) and 62.7% (FS). The hysteresis index (HI) is calculated by using eqn (1) (ref. 25) and compared in Fig. 1F. (1)

Inset in (A) shows the device structure for J–V measurement, where a blocking TiO2 layer was present between m-TiO2 and FTO. Forward and reverse scanned J–V measurements were repeated 5 times at a scan rate of 13 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) at 293 K. Aperture mask area was 0.125 cm2. Steady-state PCE and current density measured at the maximum power point voltage (VMAX) under one sun illumination at 290 K under dry air conditions (RH was 1.1%) for PCSs employing (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 (C) without (control device) and (D) with K+ doping. (E) Normalized PCE as a function of time measured at a scan rate of 13 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) at 290 K. The devices were kept under dry air and LED white light (97 mW cm−2) conditions. (F) Hysteresis index (HI) calculated based on the forward and reverse scanned data in (E). 
The HI for the pristine perovskite is gradually increased from 0.20 to 0.36 after 528 h, indicating that hysteresis becomes severe. However, the K+ doped perovskite shows little change in the HI with time from 0.01 to 0.03. These results highlight the correlation between hysteresis and long-term stability.
In order to separate effects related to the bulk of the perovskite from interfacial phenomena we next measure the ion mobility in the bulk of the perovskite layer by in situ photoluminescence (PL) imaging in a lateral configuration using a glass/m-TiO2/perovskite/Au interdigitated structure (Fig. 2).53,54 In this configuration, PL quenching takes place after polarization of the perovskite with an external bias in the form of a dark front which is related to the transport of halide vacancies  in the bulk of the perovskite layer that can annihilate non-radiative recombination centers present in the perovskite. To exclude the influence of the substrate on crystallization of the PSK film, the PSK layer was deposited on an m-TiO2/glass substrate and Au interdigitated electrodes are deposited on the perovskite layer with a spacing of 200 μm and the top of the device is covered with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer to protect the perovskite layer from moisture and oxygen during measurements (see the lateral structure in Fig. 2G). PL images are recorded under 440 nm light illumination with a light intensity of 23.3 mW cm−2 and an applied bias voltage (Fig. 2A–F). Considering that ion conductivity can be remarkably increased under even weak light intensity,55 low bias voltages are applied from 0 V to 0.5 V with 0.1 V intervals and the applied voltage is maintained for 300 s to see mainly halide migration. A custom-built optical microscope is used to obtain PL images.53,56–58 In the case of the control device employing pristine (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 without K+ ion doping (see Fig. 2A–C and ESI Video 1†), the bright PL region at 0 V is narrowed as a bias voltage is applied and gradual PL quenching occurred near the positive Au electrode. The migration and accumulation of halide ions (Br− and I−) can have a direct effect on the PL properties.59,60 In this case, the more mobile vacancies move within the applied electric field leaving behind halide ion interstitials (Ii− and Bri−). They are prone to form deep defect states and act as non-radiative recombination centers.24,61–64 For completeness we mention two further processes that can readily induce PL quenching such auger-like non-radiative recombination through ion accumulation65–67 or even degradation of the perovskite structure. Doping with K+ ions in the perovskite (Fig. 2D–F) shows a quite different spatial PL response under this low applied bias, where the bright PL region remains almost unchanged despite increasing the bias voltage, except for a few dark dots. A dark front is also observed at a higher voltage of 4 V indicating that qualitatively ion mobility is reduced after K+ doping. It is noticed that the PL is hard to quench even near the positive electrode after potassium ion doping. The dynamic PL quenching process can be best observed in a video clip (ESI Video 2†). The difference in PL images before and after K+ doping is clear evidence that the presence of potassium ions does affect the ion migration dynamics in bulk perovskite without morphological changes in the perovskite as confirmed by SEM images in Fig. S4.† However, a quantitative analysis is required in order to understand ion mobilities in the different samples. By measuring the current during the recording of PL images the ion mobility can be calculated as a function of K+ ratio. Here we use the dynamic transport model based on the modification of electronic concentration by the displacement of halide vacancies in the perovskites using eqn (2) and (3) as described previously.54 (2) (3)where d is the distance, γ is the relative quantity of halide ion vacancies of total carriers (γ = (p0/p1) − 1 = (j0/j) − 1), p0 and p1 are the initial hole density in the bright region and in the dark region, respectively, v0 is the initial velocity of ions and μC is the mobility of halide ion vacancies. The mobility of halide ion vacancies can be estimated by using the initial velocity of ions (v0) which is extracted from the slope of curves in the plot of the current as 1/j2 against time (t) with an applied voltage of 4 V using am interdigitated lateral device channel width of 150 μm as shown in the inset of Fig. 2G. Fig. 2G and H show two representative examples and further data can be seen in Fig. S5 and S6.† The estimated mobility of halide ion vacancies is gradually reduced from 2.46 × 10−6 cm V−1 s−1 (control w/o doping) to 1.18 × 10−6 cm V−1 s−1 ([K+]/[Pb2+] = 0.01) and then increased to 1.53 × 10−6 cm V−1 s−1 ([K+]/[Pb2+] = 0.015) (see Fig. 2I). As can be observed the ionic mobility in the bulk of the perovskite layer only decreases by a factor of 2 during the addition of the K+ additive. Therefore, the modest change in ionic mobility in the bulk of the perovskite layer cannot explain by itself the dramatic reduction in hysteresis. For this reason, we next apply a range of techniques to study the interfaces of perovskites with external contacts.

(I) The estimated mobility of halide ion vacancies as a function of concentration of K+ ions measured with interdigitated lateral devices with a channel width of 150 μm (inset of (G)) under 440 nm-light illumination with 23.3 mW cm−2. 
Alternatively, the effect on the external interfaces can be analyzed by using IS as it is possible to decouple bulk effects from external interfaces by the analysis of the capacitive and resistive contributions to the measured current. For the purpose of this work, charge accumulation at the perovskite/Au interface can be monitored by analysis of the capacitance related to formation of an ionic double layer which is typically observed at low frequencies.43,68 In this technique, a DC voltage is applied to the sample and a small-signal AC voltage perturbation is superimposed with a wide range of frequencies. The frequency and amplitude of the AC perturbation modulate how much the system is separated from equilibrium and the extent to which carriers/ions will move in the oscillating field. The AC frequencies used for the experiments range from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz. In this work, devices are designed to have Au/PSK/Au configuration with a channel width of 200 μm by using interdigitated electrodes as for PL experiments. As a reference device, we measure devices based on the simplest perovskite MAPbI3 to understand ionic transport in this interdigitated configuration, which is compared with more complex systems having FA, Cs/I, and Br mixed ions without and with K+ doping. Fig. 3A shows the capacitance vs. frequency spectra of the interdigitated configurational lateral device in the dark at an applied DC potential of 0.2 V. At high frequency the dielectric capacitance of the perovskite layer is observed as a plateau at about 10–100 kHz and the capacitance increases for frequency values below 10 kHz. This increase in capacitance at low frequency is attributed to ion transport and accumulation at the external interfaces for measurements carried out in the dark generating an ionic double layer.69–71 The MAPbI3 device with an interdigitated electrode shows a plateau in the low frequency range of 0.01–0.02 Hz due to the capacitance of the double layer of accumulated ions at the interfaces. Compared with MAPbI3, the perovskite with a complex system such as (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 contains smaller ions (Br− or Cs+) than I− and MA+ and larger ions (FA+) than MA+. Then, ionic migration of these ion species is expected to simultaneously take place with different kinetic rates and shows the impedance response which shows the result of the entire migrating species and perturbation of the ionic double layer. Interestingly, the whole capacitance curve is shifted towards lower frequencies, about one order of magnitude lower, indicating that the kinetics of ionic transport and accumulation is slower for (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 in comparison to MAPbI3. Finally, the K+ ion doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 shows that the ionic transport is considerably inactivated with capacitance curves shifted two orders of magnitude lower than those of control samples and three orders of magnitude in comparison to MAPbI3.
 Fig. 3  (A) Capacitance–frequency plot and (B–D) complex impedance plot measured in the dark at 0.2 V for MAPbI3, (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 and K+-doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 perovskites. All measurements were conducted in the dark. 
A different way to visualize the same data is by using the complex impedance plot (Fig. 3B–D) where ionic diffusion can be detected by formation of a 45° line for diffusion (Warburg element), a vertical line for ion accumulation and an ankle between the two regions with the characteristic frequency of diffusion (ωd). As can be observed from Fig. 3B, the device containing MAPbI3 clearly shows the transmission line that arises from ionic transport and an ankle at a frequency of 5.9 Hz which is the characteristic frequency at which the ionic double layer begins to be perturbed by accumulation at the external contacts. Fitting results to a model containing a transmission line show excellent fittings with errors below 10%. A complete analysis and comparison with systems containing RC elements are shown as Fig. S7, S8 and Table S2.† Similarly, the control device with (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 in Fig. 3C shows the 45° line up to a frequency of 0.17 Hz when ions start to accumulate and this frequency is one order of magnitude lower than that of MAPbI3 in agreement with Fig. 3B. Alternatively, K+ ion doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 in Fig. 3D only shows the sign of ionic transport and the ankle is not observed even at frequencies as low as 10 mHz (the lowest frequency limit for this measurement), which indicates that ionic transport is impeded by the presence of K+ ions. Very importantly, the high frequency arc in the complex impedance plot increases by nearly two orders of magnitude when comparing the resistance from MAPbI3 (0.09 MΩ), (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 (0.6 MΩ), and K+-doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 (6.5 MΩ). This high frequency arc obtained for measurements in the dark has been previously reported to be connected with charge transfer resistances through the external contacts.70 In addition, as the mobilities of vacancies, related to the bulk properties of the perovskites, are similar for (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 and K+-doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 as measured by PL, it is clear that the increase in resistance is related to the properties of the contacts which are controlling the ion accumulation at the contacts. Here, we propose that in the presence of K+ the kinetics to construct the surface polarization under illumination, related to hysteresis during measurements of J–V curves, is modified and we need a larger amount of iodine ions to build up the charge, as negatively charged iodine will be charge compensated by K+. In other words, the double layer capacitance is kinetically stabilized by K+ and can only be perturbed at extremely low frequencies of <0.001 Hz (>1000 s) which is extrapolated values to obtain similar capacitances in the plateau of MAPbI3 and undoped one. Very importantly, at extremely low scan rates (i.e. 0.1 mV s−1) hysteresis is still observed for the K+-doped samples (see Fig. S9†). For this reason, it is important to note that we have not totally eliminated the formation of the ionic double layer and, instead, its formation is slowed down by affecting the ionic attachment to the contact surface. We propose this as a general physical process for previously reported “hysteresis-free” devices. These low scan rates are not relevant for device operating conditions; however, they can be connected to degradation processes and understanding the kinetics of the double layer formation is a crucial point.
The precise mechanism of action of K+ is currently under debate. The first central point of discussion is where exactly the K+ cations will be sitting. These ions could be at the lattice interstices1,72 or segregated at the grain boundaries and close to the contacts by introducing a superlattice buffer layer at boundaries.41,73 Lattice parameters must increase if K+ ions in the mixed composition is located at interstitial sites in the lattice but should not change if K+ is confined at the external interfaces. In addition, an increase in lattice parameters is also probable by replacing Br− anions in the perovskite composition with iodide supplied by KI. To figure out the probable location of K+ ions, we perform XRD of (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbI3)0.125 before and after KBr doping in order to investigate the change of lattice parameters in the absence of lattice bromide using the freeware of EXPO2014 program as shown in Fig. S10,†74 together with (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 before and after KI addition. Both (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 and (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbI3)0.125 are indexed to a cubic phase with the space group of Pmm. The XRD peaks gradually shift to lower angles by 0.07–0.1° upon doping KI and KBr in both (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 and (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbI3)0.125 (see Fig. S10†). The lattice parameter of (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 increases gradually from 6.280305 ± 0.000669 Å to 6.298689 ± 0.000553 Å (Fig. S10A and B†) and to 6.288922 ± 0.000475 (Fig. S10C and D†) as [K+]/[Pb2+] increases from 0 to 0.01 by doping with KI and KBr, respectively. For (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbI3)0.125, the lattice parameter increases from 6.321077 ± 0.001389 Å to 6.333954 ± 0.000503 Å (Fig. S10E and F†) and to 6.328712 ± 0.000551 (Fig. S10G and H†) as [K+]/[Pb2+] increases from 0 to 0.01 by doping with KI and KBr, respectively. Lattice expansion is concluded to be due to K ions rather than replacement of bromide with iodide because lattice expansion observed in KBr doped (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbI3)0.125 is decisively indicative of the interstitial location of K+ ions. XPS depth profiling measurements give a very similar image, which shows equal K+ content throughout the whole film with an apparent increase of K+ content at the mesoporous electrode (Fig. S11†). We measured PL and TRPL by using the PSK film and bl-TiO2/ms-TiO2/PSK devices to find out the influence of K+ ions on charge extraction at the interface between PSK and TiO2 (Fig. S12 and Table S2†). The PL intensity of (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 with K+ ions is about 3 times larger. Also, the amplitude of τ1 (A1) increased from 72.8% for w/o K to 19.3% for K doped. Suppression of nonradiative recombination may be indicative of the decrease in the trap density.1 Steady state PL shows that PL quenching is observed at bl-TiO2/m-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 interfaces. TRPL spectra of the (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 perovskite film without and doped with K+ ions in contact with m-TiO2 show that the amplitude of τ1 (A1) of the K doped one is (87.3%) slightly higher than that without K ions in PSK (84.9%). This means that electron extraction at the interface of K+ doped PSK/m-TiO2 is better than that without K doping. Alternatively, if K+ ions are phase segregated and generate a buffer superlattice close to the grain boundaries and external contacts, capacitive contributions related to the kinetics of the generation of the double layer will be modified. Note that this chemical effect is not specific for monovalent cations as hysteresis has also been suppressed for Rb+, and other small mobile cations like Li+ could lead to additional effects related to migration of the additives under an applied electrical field. In this respect, impedance spectroscopy clearly shows differences of two orders of magnitude, comparing control (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 samples with the K+-doped one, in the polarization time of the double layer. Here, we propose that remaining K+ at the external contacts will strongly interact with migrating iodine ions by reducing the kinetics of formation of the double layer, i.e. Ti3+ defects present in TiO2 will be less prone to interact with migrating I−. Therefore, we can conclude that K+ ions placed at the contacts will play a major role in the kinetics stabilization of the double layer which will ultimately determine the hysteresis behavior and degradation kinetics.
Conclusion
We showed a clear correlation between double layer polarization, hysteresis and long term degradation of devices. A gradual increase in hysteresis was observed for the pristine perovskite without K+ doping as per a long-term stability test, while almost no change in hysteresis was observed for the K+-doped perovskite. The origin of the hysteresis was studied by decoupling bulk effects in the perovskite to those related to external contacts. Moderately retarded ion movement in the bulk of the perovskite is induced by K+ doping as confirmed by in situ PL measurements. Real time PL images proved directly directional ionic mobility in mixed perovskite (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 at applied voltage from 0 V to 0.5 V, which is reduced by K+ doping. A dynamic transport model based on the modification of electronic concentration by the displacement of halide vacancies in the perovskites allows the calculation of the ion mobilities. Interfacial effects induced by K+ doping is probed by IS and it is shown that the kinetics of formation of the double layer is highly influenced by this cation. This work highlights that ion migration plays a critical role of K+ doping in reducing hysteresis and long-term instability in PSCs by modification of the kinetics in the generation of the double layer in the vicinity of the contacts. We propose that the kinetics of ionic attachment to the contact surface determines the kinetics of hysteresis as a general physical process for previously reported “hysteresis-free” devices.
