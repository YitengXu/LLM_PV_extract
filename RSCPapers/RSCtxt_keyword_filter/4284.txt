    , Accepted 17th September 2018First published on 17th September 2018AbstractEffective control of the perovskite crystallinity, homogeneity and surface morphology is very important for state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells to retard the charge recombination at the grain boundaries. In this work, we develop a facile approach to promote the growth of high quality perovskite films that features a conductive glass-assisted annealing route. Such a novel annealing route not only confines the evaporation of the residual solvent effectively to gain high-crystallinity and micrometer-sized grains of CH3NH3PbI3 films, but also decreases the number of non-radiative recombination sites and facilitates charge transportation in the microstructural perovskite films dramatically compared with those obtained through the conventional annealing route, resulting in a remarkably improved power conversion efficiency along with an inconspicuous hysteresis. The best performing cell exhibits a PCE boosted to 18.08% compared with 16.18% achieved in the control one. And the optimized 1 cm2 device based on the reported method shows a satisfactory efficiency of 15.77%.
Introduction
Due to their excellent optoelectrical properties, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have recently been attracting increasing attention for a series of optoelectronic applications such as solid-state lasers,1 light-emitting diodes,2 highly sensitive photo-detectors3 and solar cells.4,5 In particular, in the field of solar cells, organolead trihalide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown unprecedented progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has risen rapidly from 3.8% to over 20%,6,7 and a PCE as high as 23.2% has already been achieved and certified.8 Despite the advances in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, several challenges still remain before the commercialization potential of PSCs can be realized.
As is well known, in the case of the popular CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), the perovskite material is sensitive to moisture, oxygen and thermal stress.9–11 Previous investigations indicated that the degradation of PSCs was primarily induced by the ingress of oxygen molecules and water vapor into the grain boundaries (GBs) of the perovskite film, resulting in the destruction of its lattice structure.12 Therefore, the GBs in a polycrystalline thin-film solar cell play a significantly important role that can be benign or detrimental to the performance of PSCs. And it is recognized that a delicately controlled perovskite active layer with optimized grain size and high quality is crucial for decreasing the size of the grain boundary and obtaining superior performance of PSCs.13,14 In particular, a perovskite film with a large grain size can restrain the recombination of the carriers in the grain boundary and prolong the lifetime of these carriers.15–17 Therefore, various methods have been tried to modify the morphology of perovskite grains, aiming at improving the quality of the perovskite film. For example, Park et al. fabricated reproducible PSCs via a Lewis-base adduct of PbI2, which delayed the quick reaction of PbI2 and CH3NH3I (MAI) in the one-step process, leading to the large grain size of perovskites.18 Cao et al. prepared perovskite films composed of micro-sized grains by incorporating thiourea into the perovskite precursor.19 Zou et al. fabricated inverted PSCs through a two-step strategy in which urea was added to PbI2 precursors to directly control the morphology of PbI2 films and finally increase the grain size of the perovskite.20 Nevertheless, state-of-the-art routes for tailoring the grain growth of MAPbI3 inevitably include complex additives or complicated process control.21–23 It is thus of great interest to develop a facile approach for controlling the nucleation kinetics of perovskites and thereby further improve the performance of the ultimately formed cells.
Herein, a facile conductive glass-assisted annealing strategy without the utilization of any additives or sophisticated procedures is proposed for tailoring the grain growth of MAPbI3 films, which were composed of a full coverage of high crystallinity micro-sized grains. A planar-heterojunction PSC based on this optimal MAPbI3 film yields a remarkably enhanced photovoltaic performance (18.08%) as well as slight hysteresis, compared to the cell based on conventional annealing (16.18%). Furthermore, a large area (1 cm2) PSC is also fabricated based on this novel annealing route, and a power conversion efficiency of 15.77% can be achieved.
Results and discussion
The conventional annealing route and the novel conductive glass-assisted route for preparing MAPbI3 films are demonstrated in Scheme 1, and the details are described in the Experimental section. Besides, another method using the conductive glass-assisted route to adjust perovskite formation is displayed in Scheme S1;† however, this method is not favorable to improve the quality of the perovskite film, as the photovoltaic performance of the final device was only 9.98%. As a result, by means of making appropriate re-adjustments, the optimized novel conductive glass-assisted annealing route is shown in Scheme 1b.

The deposition of MAPbI3 precursor films composed of a MAI-PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase on compact TiO2/FTO glass substrates after a spinning process has previously been investigated. Due to the strong coordination between DMSO and PbI2, some DMSO molecules still remained inside the precursor film.24 For this reason, use of a heat annealing procedure for MAPbI3 precursor films is necessary. With the application of heat annealing, the MAI-PbI2–DMSO complex begins to decompose into MAPbI3 and DMSO vapor. Meanwhile, the control of nucleation and the growth of perovskite grains are clearly affected by the rate of evaporation of DMSO from inside during the annealing process.7,22,25 As revealed in Fig. 1, the surface morphologies and roughness of the perovskite films obtained from the two annealing routes were analysed using SEM and AFM characterizations. Compared with the perovskite film prepared through the conventional annealing (CA) route, the films obtained via the novel annealing (NA) method not only present full surface coverage and great uniformity, but also exhibit a dramatically increased grain size (Fig. 1e–h). It should be noted that the crystalline grain size of the perovskite film obtained via the NA route increased to ∼2 μm greatly, compared with the 300–400 nm grain size of the film prepared through the CA route. In addition, AFM was used to get a better view of the grain morphology of the obtained perovskite films. As can be observed in Fig. 1i–l, the root-mean-square (RMS) value is 72.9 nm for the CA-15 based film, and the RMS values are 63.6, 60.9 and 48.6 nm for NA-15, NA-30 and NA-60, respectively. This means that the surface roughness of the MAPbI3 films formed via the novel conductive glass-assisted annealing process is significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the larger grain size of the perovskite films can effectively reduce the density of the grain boundary, which should be beneficial for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.26 A comparison of the XRD measurements for the NA-obtained perovskite films and the CA-obtained films is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that each film displays the conventional XRD pattern of the MAPbI3 film, where the peaks at 14.1° and 28.4° corresponding to the (110) and (220) planes of MAPbI3 are the dominant characteristic peaks. And it is worthy to note that the relative intensities of these dominant diffraction peaks become more prominent for NA-15 than for CA-15. Besides, when the annealing time is increased to 30 min, the sharpest and strongest peaks at 14.1° and 28.4° can be observed, indicating that a highly oriented crystal structure and markedly increased grain size are achieved. As seen in the XRD patterns, the tendency of the improved crystallinity of the NA based perovskite films in contrast to that of CA based ones is in good agreement with the results demonstrated in their surface SEM images. However, another noticeable point in the XRD patterns of the NA-based perovskite films is the variation of the peak intensities for the NA-60 obtained MAPbI3 film. It can be found that the peak intensities of the NA-60 obtained perovskite film are reduced, revealing that the orientation of the crystal growth becomes weak and the crystallinity of the obtained perovskite film is decreased. On the basis of the results mentioned, the principle of the evolution of the perovskite grain growth during the novel conductive glass-assisted annealing process is depicted in Scheme 2. As is well known, in the first stage, the DMSO molecules can intercalate into PbI2 as a coordinated solvent.

Simultaneously, an intermediate phase of MA2Pb3I8(DMSO) was formed after the spinning procedure with the mixture of MAI.27 During the process of heat annealing, DMSO emerged along the boundaries of the perovskite grains and MA2Pb3I8(DMSO) was transformed to MAPbI3 and DMSO vapors. Therefore, the evaporation rate of the DMSO molecules in the perovskite precursor film is significantly important for controlling the nucleation and growth of MAPbI3 grains. For the CA route as shown in Scheme 2a, the evaporation of the residual DMSO molecules was rapid and disorganized so that the solid phase of MAPbI3 was quickly formed; this induced fast nucleation and high nucleation density,28,29 and the film did not have sufficient time for grain growth, resulting in a perovskite film with a small grain size. In contrast, when conductive glass was introduced and the perovskite film was directly in contact with the FTO, as can be seen in Scheme 2b, the NA route can efficiently suppress the evaporation rate of the DMSO molecules. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S1,† the contact angle of the DMSO solution on FTO glass was determined to be about 34°. Considering the specific situation in this case, Kelvin's formula can be revised as in the following eqn (1) (1)where P is the actual pressure, P0 is the saturated vapor pressure, γ is the surface tension, M is the molar mass, θ is the contact angle, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, ρ is the density of the solution, and d is the distance between the two glasses. Herein, because θ is less than 90°, d is a negative value, which means that the actual pressure of DMSO is less than the saturated vapor pressure, and so the volatilization of DMSO became more difficult when the FTO glass was covered. Owing to the greatly decreased volatilization of DMSO as discussed above, a perovskite film with a large grain size can be controllably formed. Based on these results, the NA route described in our work has been proved to be crucial to not only reduce the nucleation density of the grains but also facilitate the improvement in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs compared with the CA route.
To explore the possible influence of the development of the MAPbI3 film on the photovoltaic performance of devices, two types of planar heterojunction PSCs were fabricated. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the perovskite films obtained via different annealing routes had the same annealing time of 15 min. As shown in Fig. 3a–b, the MAPbI3-based perovskite film behaved as a light absorption layer, while the FTO and Au layers served as the bottom cathode and top anode, respectively. And the compact TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD functioned as the electron and hole transport materials, respectively. Fig. 3c shows the J–V curves of the PSCs based on different annealing routes. The key parameters of the two types of devices are summarized in Table 1. It is worth noting that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the PSC based on the NA route was obviously enhanced, wherein the values were 23.18 and 24.06 mA cm−2, respectively. The improved Jsc can be ascribed to the high crystallinity and large perovskite grains, which were consequently favorable for reducing the defects and suppressing the carrier recombination at the grain boundaries. Accordingly, the PCE increased to 17.26% from the 16.18% PCE of the device based on the CA route. Fig. 3d shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra. The device based on the NA route exhibited a higher IPCE response in the range of 450–750 nm in comparison with the CA route based device. Fig. S2† shows a histogram of PCE values for 30 planar PSCs based on the CA and NA routes, which indicates that the devices based on the NA route exhibit a higher average PCE (16.82 ± 0.32%) than the CA based devices (15.83 ± 0.35%). Additionally, the experimental stability of the NA-30 and the CA-30 based PSCs was tested in the time period of 120 h (5 days). And the stability of the corresponding devices is presented in Fig. S3† The stability test of both the cells showed slight increases in the PCE during the first 24 h. Although the mechanism for this phenomenon is still unclear, multiple factors might lead to the initial enhancement of the PCE, including the positive effect of ambient air on Spiro-OMeTAD and the light soaking which can internally modify the distribution of the crystal defects of the perovskite. After 5 days, the PCE of the NA-30 based device still remained at 86%, which is obviously superior to the 62% PCE of the device based on the conventional annealing route. This demonstrates that the high quality of the perovskite film (morphology and crystallinity) obtained from the novel annealing route can improve the stability of the device.

To understand the possible reasons for the much enhanced performance of the device based on the NA method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out for analysing the internal electrical properties. Fig. S4† displays the Nyquist plots of the PSCs measured at a bias of −0.7 V under dark conditions. The top-right inset shows the equivalent circuit composed of the series resistance (Rs) and the recombination resistance (Rrec). And the fitted parameters of the equivalent circuit are listed in Table S1.† The Rs values of the reference and optimized device were 14.59 and 11.20 Ω, respectively. The reduced Rs facilitates the transport of the carriers, leading to an enhanced Jsc. More importantly, compared with the control device, the Rrec value of the optimized device increased significantly, to 3509 Ω from 2694 Ω, which implies that the charge recombination rate in the optimized device can be effectively impeded, resulting in the improved performance of the final PSCs. The optical properties of the NA route based perovskite film and the control one were further investigated to better understand the relationship between the perovskite film quality and the performance of the devices. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the studied samples and the reference ones are given in Fig. S5a.† A clear emission peak at ∼780 nm originating from the interband radiative recombination of photo-generated charge carriers could be seen for the two kinds of perovskite films. When compared, the PL intensity of the NA-based perovskite film is much more enhanced than that of the CA-based perovskite film, indicating that fewer defect sites emerged in the developed perovskite film.30,31 Moreover, transient PL (TR-PL) decay characterization was explored to illustrate the diffusion properties of photo-induced charge carriers in the NA-based films. The results depicted in Fig. S5b† mean that a longer charge carrier lifetime can be obtained in the optimized film compared to in the control one. This further confirms that the reduced defect density in the better crystallized NA-based perovskite film can lead to the superior interfacial transportation of the charge carriers and dramatically accelerate electron transfer across the interface between the perovskite film and the compact TiO2 film.32–35 Based on the analysis results mentioned above, it is found that improved film quality and enhanced photovoltaic performance can be achieved based on the perovskite precursor film annealed via the NA route rather than the CA one. To achieve the best performance of PSCs based on the former route, the relative parameters which are critical to the PSCs should be optimized in the following steps. It is well known that the annealing time of the perovskite film has a great effect on the performance of the PSCs. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the NA time for the best performance of the PSCs. The cross-sectional SEM images of the PSCs obtained at different novel annealing times are shown in Fig. 4a–c. It can be observed that the NA-30 based perovskite grain size was further increased when compared with the NA-15 based one, and this tendency is in good agreement with the surface SEM images of the perovskite films displayed in Fig. 1. However, with a prolonged annealing time of 60 min, it becomes difficult to find the perovskite grain boundary; in addition, the thickness of the photo-active film was decreased. This is not beneficial for absorbing sufficient light, and so the short-circuit current density of the PSC will decrease. The J–V curves of the PSCs based on the different novel annealing times are exhibited in Fig. 4d and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the Jsc and Voc values of the NA-15 and NA-30 based PSCs were 24.06 and 24.05 mA cm−2, and 1.02 and 1.03 V, respectively. The changes in Jsc and Voc were slight and negligible. However, it needs to be emphasized that the fill factor (FF) value of the NA-30 based PSC increased to 0.73 from the FF of 0.70 of the NA-15 based one, indicating that the enhancement in this value can be mainly attributed to the improved transport and transfer of electrons along a direction perpendicular to the compact TiO2 in the NA-30 based PSC. Thus, the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.08% in the NA-30 based PSC with the largest grain sizes can be achieved. Moreover, the measured Jsc of the NA-30 based PSC is well consistent with the integrated Jsc of 22.91 mA cm−2 estimated from the IPCE in Fig. 4e. In addition, to examine the realistic PCE of the NA-30 based PSC, the photocurrent values were recorded as a function of time at a forward bias of 0.84 V near the maximum output power point (MPP). As shown in Fig. 4f, the Jsc value stabilized within seconds at approximately 23.90 mA cm−2, yielding a stabilized PCE of around 18.01%. Additionally, the J–V hysteresis was checked as well, and little hysteresis was found, where the PCE of 18.08% for the reverse scan and 17.29% for the forward scan were seen, showing ∼4% difference. Moreover, when the novel annealing time was further increased to 60 min, the device performance decreased. This is mainly owing to the reduction in the Jsc value, which is probably caused by the decreasing crystallinity of the perovskite film (Fig. 2) and the reduced thickness of the photo-active layer (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, determination of the suitable annealing temperature of the novel annealing route is also necessary. Fig. S7† shows the J–V curves of the NA-30 based PSCs for which the perovskite films were annealed at different temperatures. For the device based on an 80 °C annealing temperature, an overall PCE of 17.35% was obtained. And the efficiency of the cell was enhanced to 18.06% when the perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C through the novel annealing route. This indicates that the superior photovoltaic performance of the 100 °C annealing temperature based PSC is mainly due to the improved quality of the perovskite film (morphology and crystallinity). However, when the annealing temperature of the perovskite film was increasing to 120 °C, the corresponding device displayed a decreased PCE of 17.46%. This implies that the excessive annealing temperature is unfavorable for the perovskite film and will be not beneficial for the performance of the ultimately obtained PSC device.

To characterize the physical process occurring at the interface between the NA-30 based perovskite film layer and the compact TiO2 layer, the impedance response was measured at a bias of −0.7 V under illumination. Based on the previous investigation,36 the EIS measurements performed under the bias voltage and the illumination condition can provide information concerning the charge-carrier densities and charge dynamics in the PSCs related to the interface of the device. As shown in Fig. 5a, the top-right inset shows the equivalent circuit composed of the series resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct). And the fitted parameters of the equivalent circuit are listed in Table S4.† Accordingly, the results point out that the reduced Rs value of the NA-30 based PSC is probably due to the better contact of the perovskite film with the compact TiO2 surface.37 Additionally, the appearance of the charges at the first arc has been suggested to be the transport resistance of the interface.38,39 Therefore, the much lower resistance (171 Ω vs. 198, 239 Ω) in this region implies that the NA-30 based developed MAPbI3/compact TiO2 heterojunction can lead to the more efficient charge transfer from the photo-active layer to an n-type semiconductor. And this was considered to be the major contribution to the better photovoltaic performance for the PSCs. The effect of different NA times on the photovoltaic properties of the perovskite films was further investigated.
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plots of the perovskite solar cells which were fabricated based on the NA-15 (black), NA-30 (red) and NA-60 (blue) routes, respectively, and the devices were measured at −0.7 V under illumination conditions.

(b) UV-vis optical absorption spectra of the perovskite films obtained using the NA-15 (black), NA-30 (red) and NA-60 (blue) routes, respectively. (c, d) Normalized PL and TR-PL spectra (excitation at 406 nm) of the corresponding perovskite films mentioned above. 

Fig. 5b shows that stronger absorption in the range of ∼550–750 nm for the NA-30 based perovskite film can be found, compared with the NA-15 and NA-60 based ones. The enhanced absorption was ascribed to the reduced grain boundaries, larger grain size and better crystallinity of the NA-30 based perovskite film. Fig. 5c–d gives the steady-state PL and TR-PL spectra of the corresponding perovskite films on glasses. It can be observed that the NA-30 based perovskite film showed the strongest peak intensity compared to the other films. This illustrates that the non-radiative decay was largely suppressed by the enhanced crystallinity and reduced surface defects of the NA-30 based perovskite film. Furthermore, TR-PL was carried out to confirm the life-time of the photo-induced carriers, as given in Fig. 5d. The decay spectra were fitted with the bi-exponential function of time as shown in the following eqn (2) F(t) = Aiet/ti; i = 1, 2(2)where Ai is a prefactor and ti is a time constant.40 The average carrier lifetime (tave) was derived to be 552 ns for the NA-30 based perovskite film and 514 and 437 ns for the NA-15 and NA-60 based ones, respectively. The longer charge carrier lifetime demonstrates a larger charge carrier diffusion length in the perovskite film.41,42 In combination with the reduced defects of the NA-30 based perovskite film, it can thereby be concluded that this film has a better transfer property of the carriers in contrast to the other two samples.
To better understand the effect of the active cell area on the device characteristics, large area PSCs were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 6a. With delicate control, the best PCE of 15.77% can be achieved in the NA-30 based planar PSC with a large area (1.00 cm2). Meanwhile, the average PCE of the 30 large area devices was 14.66%. It should be noted that the PCE of these PSCs did not vary significantly compared with the small area devices and was highly reproducible; approximately 90% of the PCE of the small-area devices can be retained. Ultimately, we believe that high-quality large-area photoactive perovskite films can be formed based on our novel annealing route and synergistically lead to further improvement in the scalability and reproducibility of PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a feasible and facile method to control the nucleation and growth process of perovskite grains by introducing conductive glass to assist the perovskite film annealing process. Such a novel annealing route does not incorporate any additives or insert any special substrates. Moreover, it can effectively tailor the perovskite grain properties including grain size, crystallinity and the number of grain boundaries. Based on our novel perovskite film annealing route, the best device performance showed a Jsc of 24.05 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.03 V, and FF of 0.73, yielding an efficiency of 18.08%. In particular, the optimized 1 cm2 device exhibited a satisfactory efficiency of 15.77%. This work provides a new approach to optimize the perovskite crystallization kinetics and shows an alternative way toward realizing high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films for efficient perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
All chemicals are of analytical grade and applied directly without any purification. PbI2 (99.999%), CH3NH3I and Spiro-OMeTAD (≥99%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Co., Ltd. (China). DMF (99.8%), DMSO (≥99%), anhydrous acetonitrile (99.8%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95%) and chlorobenzene (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Preparation of compact TiO2/FTO glass substrates
Fluorine doped tin oxide (F:SnO2) coated glass (FTO) was patterned by etching with 2 M HCl and Zn powder. The patterned FTO was cleaned by ultra-sonication and rinsed with detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol for 30 min, respectively. Then, the FTO was dried using clean air and treated with a UV-ozone machine for 15 min. The TiO2 compact layer was prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution of 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Alfa-Aesar) in 1-butanol (99.9%, Alfa-Aesar). After spin-coating, the substrates were annealed at 550 °C for 30 min and then they were left to cool down to room temperature.
Growth of the MAPbI3 film
A solution of 1 M PbI2/1 M MAI was dissolved in a DMSO solvent and the solution was stirred at 60 °C for 30 min before spin coating. The prepared solution was then spin-coated onto the compact TiO2/FTO glass substrates at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. Chlorobenzene (CB, 100 μL) was added dropwise on the spinning substrates at 15 s before the end of the spin coating procedure. Then, the obtained MAPbI3 precursor films were annealed under different conditions. For the conventional annealing (CA) route, the substrate was placed on the hot plate in contact with glass side. For the conductive glass (FTO)-assisted annealing method, called the novel annealing (NA) route, the surface of the MAPbI3 precursor films is in contact with the FTO directly. It should be noted that the surface of the FTO needed to be cleaned and preheated to 100 °C before the perovskite film annealing. Briefly, the different novel annealing times of 15, 30 and 60 min were denoted as NA-15, NA-30 and NA-60, respectively.

After the perovskite annealing, the substrate was cooled down for a few of minutes. The hole transport material (HTM) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 20 s. An HTM solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) (Spiro-MeOTAD) in 1.0 mL of chlorobenzene, into which 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) were added. Finally, a gold electrode with a thickness of 80 nm was thermally evaporated on top of the device to finish the fabrication. The active area of the small area device was 0.09 cm2 and that of the large area device was 1 cm2.
Characterization of the PSC device
The photovoltaic performance of PSCs was recorded using a source meter (Keithley 2400). A PEC-L11 AM 1.5 solar simulator with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM 1.5 filter (Peccell) was used as the light source (100 mW cm−2). J–V curves were measured at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were collected using a PEC-S20 (Peccell). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using an IM6 (Zahner). The impedance parameters were simulated by fitting the impedance spectrum through the Z-view software.
The phase purity of the samples was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku Ultima IV using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The crystalline morphologies were examined by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4800 instrument). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were obtained using a SPA-300 AFM (Bruker) and the scanning range of the AFM images was 5 μm × 5 μm. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (excitation at 406 nm) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) (excitation at 406 nm and emission at 750 nm) were conducted using an FLS 980 (Edinburgh Instruments LTD). The contact angles were measured on a OCA20 machine. The absorption spectra were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 950).
