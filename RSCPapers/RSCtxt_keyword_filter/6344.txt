    , Accepted 13th November 2016First published on 28th November 2016AbstractWe fabricated Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells with chemical-bath deposited (CBD) ZnS buffer layers with different deposition times. The conversion efficiency and the fill factor of the CIGS solar cells reveal a strong dependence on the deposition time of CBD-ZnS films. In order to understand the detailed relationship between the heterojunction structure and the electronic properties of CIGS solar cells with different deposition times of CBD-ZnS films, capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiling measurements with additional laser illumination were performed. The light-soaking effects on CIGS solar cells with a CBD-ZnS buffer layer were investigated in detail using current density–voltage (J–V) and C–V measurements with several different lasers with different emission wavelengths. After light-soaking, the conversion efficiency changed significantly and the double diode feature in J–V curves disappeared. We explain that the major reason for the improvement of efficiency by light-soaking is due to the fact that negatively charged and highly defective vacancies in the CIGS absorber near the interface of CBD-ZnS/CIGS were formed and became neutral due to carriers generated by ultra-violet absorption in the buffer layer.
1. Introduction
The importance of the interface properties of contacting layers in polycrystalline thin film solar cells has steadily increased since the interface properties often play a crucial role in determining the overall conversion efficiency of the device. CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin-film photovoltaic devices have achieved a record efficiency of 22.6% on a laboratory scale.1 Traditionally, high-efficiency devices contain a CdS buffer layer between a CIGS absorber and a transparent front electrode.2 However, the use of cadmium is undesirable because cadmium is highly toxic and CdS-based CIGS solar cells can suffer optical absorption loss in the blue-green region due to the light absorption in the CdS buffer layer.3 In contrast, a recent breakthrough was achieved with an alternative Cd-free buffer layer Zn(O,S),4–7 and other groups have also reported high conversion efficiencies for the Zn(O,S)/CIGS system.3,8,9 ZnS-based buffer layers are desirable as they offer higher transparency and, thus, the possibility of increasing the current collection in the shorter wavelength region. The CIGS solar cells with CBD-ZnS-based solar cells generally required additional light-soaking procedures in order to achieve optimal conversion efficiencies.10–12
The light-soaking effect was reported to gradually improve the distortion of the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of CIGS solar cells with CBD-ZnS buffer layers as the device was illuminated by high enough light intensity for a sufficient period of time.13 The distortion of the J–V curves must be eliminated for industrial applications, which require high stability and reliability of the devices.14 In many cases, devices with CBD-ZnS buffer layers exhibit more pronounced improvement of conversion efficiency after light-soaking. However, the prime origin of this metastability in these solar cells is still not clear, whether it is related to the buffer layer or the absorber layer, or both. While it was reported that these improvements depend on the various deposition conditions of the buffer layer,15 the exact role of the buffer layer and interface properties in the device structure is still not well understood.16 It has been proposed that the reasons for the increased conversion efficiency after light-soaking in CdS/CIGS systems were related to the depletion of free holes,17 the migration of copper atoms,18 or the persistent photoconductivity of the CIGS layer.19 It has been recently proposed that the key factor for the light-soaking effect in a CBD-ZnS/CIGS structure is the buffer/CIGS heterointerface.11,20
In this study, in order to clearly understand the mechanism of the light-soaking effects and the interface electronic properties of CIGS solar cells with CBD-ZnS buffer films, the J–V characteristics and capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiling with various additional laser illuminations were performed. We selected laser wavelengths of 325 nm, 405 nm, and 532 nm (all the laser powers were fixed at 9 mW) to clarify the mechanism leading to the increase of efficiency after light-soaking. The impurity concentrations through the pn junction were determined using a standard method of a Mott–Schottky plot. Polycrystalline materials, such as CIGS thin films, are very likely to contain a significant number of deep defects. The measurement of defect concentration (NCV) profiles by means of C–V profiling has often led to U-shaped profiles with an apparent increase in the defect densities toward the heterointerfaces. Here, we shall provide a systematic analysis of J–V and C–V measurements with additional illumination of lasers with various wavelengths in CIGS solar cell devices.
2. Experimental
We manufactured CIGS solar cells using a cluster-type deposition system that consists of load-lock, DC/RF sputtering, co-evaporation, and central transfer modules. First, a 900 nm Mo back contact layer was deposited on a soda lime glass (SLG) substrate with an area of 25 × 25 mm2 at ambient temperature using a DC sputtering system. Then, 2.3 μm CIGS was grown using a three-stage process in which a sequence of In–Ga–Se/Cu–Se/In–Ga–Se co-evaporation was performed at substrate temperatures of 330 °C (1st stage) and 570 °C (2nd and 3rd stage). Identical CIGS absorber layers deposited in single batch were used to study the effect of the CBD-ZnS buffer layer on the C–V characteristics and the solar cell performance. ZnS was deposited using the CBD process in an aqueous solution consisting of zinc sulfate heptahydrate, thiourea, ammonia and de-ionized water. During the CBD-ZnS process, the concentration of ammonia (2.5 M), thiourea (0.08 M) and zinc sulfate (0.02 M) was fixed except for the deposition times. The deposition time of the CBD-ZnS buffer layer was varied from 35 to 50 min. Intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) and ITO layers were then deposited successively using RF sputtering. Finally, we completed the CIGS devices with Ni/Al grid contacts formed using thermal evaporation. None of the devices for this study had anti-reflection coating. The active area of solar cells is 0.47 cm2.21,22
Solar cell performance was investigated using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under a global AM 1.5 spectrum for 1000 W m−2 irradiance at room temperature (RT). Under a global AM 1.5 illumination, the light-soaking treatment was performed at RT for 60 min. While in the light-soaking procedure a white-light source is used, an ultra-violet monochromatic light source is used in the UV-soaking procedure. The ultra-violet (UV) soaking treatment was performed by using a UV soaker with an emission wavelength of 365 nm (Eg = 3.39 eV), and the total light power was 0.16 W cm−2 at RT for 60 min. In the steady state, the band diagram of our structures was characterized using SCAPS 3.3.03 software. C–V profiling was carried out with a fixed frequency of 100 kHz using an HP 4284A LCR meter. Lasers of 325 nm, 405 nm, and 532 nm emission wavelengths were used for the additional illumination in J–V and C–V measurements and all the laser powers at the sample surface were fixed at 9 mW by neutral density filters. As shown in Fig. 1, the 325 nm (Eg = 3.8 eV) laser light is supposed to be absorbed in the CBD-ZnS (Eg = 3.25 eV) layer, while the 405 nm (Eg = 3.06 eV) and 532 nm (Eg = 2.33 eV) laser lights are absorbed in the CIGS layer. The spots of all the lasers were defocused, and the spot size was 6.8 mm in diameter, which can cover the active area of the solar cell.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. CIGS solar cell performance
CIGS solar cells with a Ni/Al/ITO/i-ZnO/CBD-ZnS/CIGS/Mo/SLG structure were fabricated at different deposition times of CBD-ZnS buffer films. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the solar cell parameters and the deposition times of CBD-ZnS films. The square, circle and triangle lines represent the as-fabricated films, after conventional light-soaking, and after UV soaking, respectively. The conversion efficiency of the CIGS solar cells reveals a strong dependence on the deposition times of CBD-ZnS films. The highest efficiency after UV soaking of 13.97% and after light-soaking of 12.91% was achieved when the deposition time was 45 min, up from 4.86% for the as-fabricated case. While the efficiency first increases with the deposition time of CBD-ZnS until 45 min, it drops slightly above that. On the other hand, the open circuit voltage (VOC) and the short circuit current (JSC) remain nearly constant. The fill factor (FF) shows a similar behavior to the deposition time of CBD-ZnS as in conversion efficiency.

3.2. Dependence on the deposition time of a CBD-ZnS buffer layer
In this paper, we call NCV, which is extracted from the C–V techniques, the defect concentration. In order to understand the relationship between the junction structures and the interface defects in CIGS solar cells with different deposition times of CBD-ZnS films, a C–V depth profiling technique was also performed. By using eqn (1)–(3), NCV can be obtained as a function of the depletion layer width (Wdep), so that we can determine the defect concentrations at the edge of the depletion region. C = ΔQ/ΔV = εA[q/(2ε(Vbi − V)) × (NaNd)/(Na + Nd)]2 = εA/Wdep(1) Ncv = 2/(qεA2Δ(1/C2)/Δ(Vbi − V))(2) Δ(1/C2)/Δ(Vbi − V) = (2/qεA2) × (NaNd)/(Na + Nd)(3)where C is the measured capacitance, A is the effective area of the solar cell, V is positive/negative for forward/reverse bias, Vbi is the built-in potential, ε is the permittivity of the CIGS, and Na and Nd are the concentration of acceptor and donor, respectively.23Fig. 3 shows the 1/C2–V and NCV–Wdep plots with different deposition times of the CBD-ZnS films. As shown in eqn (2) and (3), the slope in 1/C2–V at high enough reverse bias (V < 0), when the CIGS layers are depleting, represents the impurity concentrations in CIGS bulk. The determined impurity concentrations in CIGS layers with CBD-ZnS buffer layers with different deposition times are summarized in Table 1. The smallest value of 1.01 × 1015 cm−3 is obtained when the deposition time of the CBD-ZnS buffer layer is 45 min, and the largest value of 2.84 × 1015 cm−3 is obtained when the deposition time of the CBD-ZnS buffer layer is 35 min. This result shows that the net acceptor concentration in the CIGS absorber can be varied by the properties of CBD-ZnS buffer layers. The conduction band off-set (CBO) can also be expected to decrease as the net acceptor concentration in the CIGS absorber decreases.24 By using eqn (1), we can extract the defect concentrations as a function of Wdep (Fig. 3b). The depth profiles show a U-shaped form as reported in several studies,25,26 with a Wdep value of 100–1200 nm. The depth profiles exhibit a significant increase in the NCV toward the CBD-ZnS/CIGS junction and bulk.27 Notably, we observed the largest Wdep value in the case of the CBD-ZnS film deposited for 35 min, and we observed the smallest Wdep value in the CBD-ZnS film deposited for 45 min. These defect states at deep energy levels are located deep in CIGS, and the device performance degraded as proved by the efficiency values shown in Fig. 2.

3.3. Light-soaking effects (the deposition time of the CBD-ZnS film is 45 min)
We then measured J–V and C–V curves after UV soaking of the device with a deposition time of 45 min of CBD-ZnS buffer layers in order to understand the light-soaking effect mechanism in greater detail. The series resistances, which are obtained by J–V characteristics, of the as-fabricated device and after UV soaking are compared first. The general J–V characteristics can be given by eqn (4), which includes the effects of series and parasitic resistances and photo-generation current density (JL)28 J = J0exp[(q/AkT)(V − RJ)] + GV − JL(4)where A is the ideality factor, and series resistance R and shunt conductance G are lumped circuit model representations of the losses that exist in series and parallel with the primary diode, respectively.

Fig. 4(a) illustrates the typical features of the J–V characteristics under white illumination for the sample in the as-fabricated and after UV soaking cases at RT. Fig. 4(b) and (c) show the transformations of Fig. 4(a) to obtained R and G. The y-intercept in dV/dJ versus 1/(J + Jsc) represents the series resistance, and R in Fig. 4(b) and G are obtained using eqn (4) with fixed JL as a function of the applied voltage. The obtained R and the shunt resistance (1/G) are summarized in Table 2.28 The series resistance decreased, and the shunt resistance increased significantly after UV soaking.

Fig. 5(a) shows the Mott–Schottky plots before and after UV soaking. By using eqn (2), we can extract NCV through C–V measurements as a function of Wdep (Fig. 4(b)). The Wdep value can be directly determined using eqn (1). At zero bias, for example, the Wdep value increased from 645 nm to 798 nm after UV soaking. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), Wdep significantly increased through the measured voltage region after UV soaking, which means that the junction becomes more intrinsic. In short, the UV soaking results in an increase in shunt resistance, Wdep, and a decrease in series resistance. Here, we assume that negative charges trapped and highly defective vacancies, which can generate effective p+ layers, are formed into CIGS near the interface of CBD-ZnS/CIGS as in ref. 17. We followed the argument based on the theoretical predictions of the Lany and Zunger model,17 which explains the metastability in the CIGS solar cell with a CdS buffer layer.

In Fig. 6, a calculated steady state band diagram of our structures by using SCAPS 3.3.03 is shown.29–31 The parameters of each layer of the simulation are from ref. 32 and our experimental results. As shown in Fig. 6, the existence of deep acceptor vacancy defects at a high concentration near the interface can serve not only as leakage paths, resulting in a reduction of the shunt resistance, but also as an effective scattering source that reduces the electron mobility and increases the series resistance as a result. After UV soaking, the photo-generated carriers from the p–n junction by the blue photon absorption can drift toward the junction and compensate for those ionized defects, resulting in an increase in the Wdep.

In order to further investigate the credibility of our assumption, J–V and C–V curves with additional laser illumination are measured. Fig. 7 illustrates the J–V characteristics under 325 nm, 405 nm, and 532 nm laser illumination for the as-fabricated sample (Fig. 7(a)) and after UV soaking (Fig. 7(b)). With the fixed laser power of 9 mW, the photon fluxes of 325 nm, 405 nm and 532 nm lasers were 0.024 μmol m−2 s−1, 0.034 μmol m−2 s−1, and 0.040 μmol m−2 s−1, respectively. In Fig. 7, the overall increase in photocurrent as the laser wavelength increases is attributed to the different photon fluxes and the increased absorption coefficient as the laser energy becomes farther higher than the band-gap of its corresponding absorbers. Under 405 nm and 532 nm laser illumination, where the photon energy of lasers is between the band-gap of the CBD-ZnS buffer layer and that of the CIGS absorber, most of the carriers are generated in CIGS layers. In these cases, we observed in the J–V curve a prominent “double diode” feature, which has been observed several times in CIGS solar cells.10,33–35 However, with 325 nm laser illumination, where the laser energy is higher than the band-gap of CBD-ZnS, the “double diode” feature disappeared and the FF increased. We believe that this double diode feature is mainly caused by the formation of a p+/p junction in the absorber, induced by the excess charges accumulated in deep acceptor vacancy defects, such as (VCu–VSe)3− as also suggested in the CdS/CIGS structure.17,36 The charged p+ layer would generate spike like potential hill and further block electron transport through the junction in addition to the CBO. When 405 nm and 532 nm lasers are illuminated, only electrons photogenerated in CIGS would tend to drift toward the junction and are blocked and accumulated at the junction. These electrons cannot neutralize the acceptor-like defects in the p+ layer, which results in an additional diode feature at the p+/p interface in the forward bias range. Considering the fact that with 405 nm laser illumination the larger reverse bias is required to start reverse drift photocurrent in Fig. 7(a) (blue line + triangle symbol) compared to that with 325 nm illumination (red line + circle symbol), some of those accumulated electrons seem to be trapped at the junction and thus further increase the potential hill. This also can explain the fact that even further reverse bias is required under the 532 nm laser illumination, which generates more electrons in CIGS. On the other hand, when the 325 nm laser is illuminated or after UV soaking these deep acceptor vacancy defects, the p+ layers are neutralized by the holes photogenerated in the CBD-ZnS buffer layer, which results in both the single diode feature in the J–V curve and the increased Wdep at equilibrium in C–V characteristics.

Fig. 8 shows the Wdep value obtained from C–V curves of the as-fabricated sample with additional laser illuminations. When the 325 nm laser is illuminated, the Wdep value is increased by neutralizing the p+ layer by the holes photogenerated in the CBD-ZnS layer. On the other hand the Wdep value decreased when 405 nm and 532 nm laser is illuminated due to the additional accumulation of electrons at the junction. Those results are also consistent with our interpretation described above.

4. Conclusions
By varying the deposition times of the buffer layer, light-soaking effects in CIGS solar cells with a CBD-ZnS buffer layer were investigated experimentally by J–V and C–V measurements at RT. Through varying the deposition times, the best efficiency of 12.91% was obtained after light-soaking (at a buffer layer deposition time of 45 min). We presented an argument based on the theoretical predictions of Lany and Zunger17 and supported experimental data obtained by the J–V and C–V methods with additional laser illuminations with various wavelengths. We observed that an increase of Wdep with 325 nm laser illumination is caused by the fact that deep acceptor vacancy defects in the CIGS absorber near the interface of CBD-ZnS/CIGS become neutral due to carriers generated by UV light absorption in the buffer layer. Thus, we conclude that the major reason for improved efficiency upon UV light-soaking in these CBD-ZnS/CIGS solar cells is mainly due to the formation of a p+ defect layer in the CIGS absorber near the interface and its neutralization by electrons generated selectively by UV light in the buffer layer.
