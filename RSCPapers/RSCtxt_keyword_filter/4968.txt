E-mail: klaus.meerholz@uni-koeln.deReceived 29th January 2013, Accepted 22nd February 2013First published on 6th March 2013AbstractA novel bis(merocyanine) dye has been synthesized and its folding and aggregation behavior has been elucidated in dependence on the solvent polarity. Extended cofacially π-stacked H-aggregates could be prepared in nonpolar solvents based on the preorganized folded dimer structure of the dye exhibiting a more than 120 nm hypsochromic shift of the absorption band. Furthermore, incorporation of such H-aggregate domains in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells by careful adjustment of processing conditions afforded a nearly twofold increase in the photocurrent generation. Our detailed investigations on the external quantum efficiencies of these blends reveal that the increase of the short-circuit current density JSC stems from the H-aggregated dye manifold in the photoactive layer of the solar cell devices.IntroductionIn natural photosynthetic systems the light harvesting and charge separation functions are accomplished by highly ordered self-organized nanostructures based on π-conjugated molecules. Thus, in view of approaching advanced solar energy conversion devices based on organic materials the proper control of supramolecular packing arrangements is crucial.1,2 In organic photovoltaics, planar heterojunction (PHJ)3 and bulk heterojunction (BHJ)4 solar cells are generally used that contain separated electron-donor and electron-acceptor domains to assure efficient hole and electron transport, respectively, as well as efficient charge separation at the interface of the organic semiconductors. In principle, the desired arrangement of the involved donor and acceptor π-systems should be realizable by supramolecular design. Early examples include the formation of supramolecular n/p-heterojunctions (SHJ) based on hydrogen-bonded dyads incorporating perylene bisimide and oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) derivatives5 and trinitrofluorenone-appended amphiphilic hexabenzocoronenes.6 More recently, the construction of supramolecular fullerene architectures based on hydrogen-bonding interactions,7 coordination of pyridine-functionalized fullerenes to zinc porphyrins8 and interface engineering by contorted hole conductors9 have been pursued. One outstanding access to vertically aligned SHJ was developed by the Matile group. They have introduced the zipper assembly of rigid-rod naphthalenediimide π-stack architectures, providing cascade n/p-heterojunctions with antiparallel redox gradients that excel in efficient photocurrent generation on the nanoscale.10,11 However, on the meso- and macroscopic scale such precise control over the n/p-heterojunction morphology is still an elusive task because the domains in BHJ solar cells are generated by phase-separating forces between the intermixed electron donor–acceptor materials.12,13Our particular interest during the past years has been devoted to the self-assembly of merocyanines,14–16 a class of colorants, which we have recently positioned among the top-performing small molecule p-type semiconductors in the field of organic photovoltaics.17,18 Merocyanines hold promise for the formation of well-defined supramolecular architectures due to their strong and highly directional dipolar interactions. For ditopic bis(merocyanine) dyes not only the formation of supramolecular polymers14 and well-defined discrete bimolecular π-stacks,15 but also conformational switching into intramolecular foldamers19,20 has been reported. In the present study, we disclose the hierarchical self-assembly process of a newly designed bis(merocyanine) dye, from the unfolded state via intramolecular folding to a cofacially stacked H-aggregate in solution (Fig. 1). Further, the formation of H-aggregate domains in thin films of BHJ solar cells by careful adjustment of processing conditions entailing a unique generation of photocurrent is reported.

Results and discussionSynthesisThe target bis(merocyanine) dye 4 was synthesized according to the route depicted in Scheme 1. In the first step, the literature known diamide 1 was condensed with ethyl acetoacetate affording the ring-closed bis(pyridone) 2 in 77% yield. A subsequent Knoevenagel-type condensation of 2 with formylated aminothiophene 3 gave the desired bis(merocyanine) dye 4 in 61% yield (for synthetic details see the ESI†). The reference merocyanine dye 5 was synthesized according to a literature procedure.21 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to the target bis(merocyanine) dye 4 and chemical structure of reference merocyanine 5. 2-Ethex = 2-Ethylhexyl. Structure elucidation of intramolecular dimerInitial evidence for an equilibrium between a folded and an unfolded conformer of bis(merocyanine) dye 4 was obtained from its UV/vis spectral features in nonpolar dioxane (see Fig. 2a) and more polar dichloromethane (see ESI,† Fig. S1). In more polar dichloromethane the characteristic absorption band of a monomeric merocyanine is observed (λmax = 539 nm), whereas in less polar dioxane the characteristic band shape of exciton-coupled22 merocyanine dimer aggregates prevails (Fig. 2a).14–16,23,24 To gain insight into the aggregation behavior of dye 4, UV/vis dilution experiments in dioxane were performed. As shown in Fig. 2a (black lines), no significant changes in the absorption band could be observed within the examined concentration range from 1.2 × 10−5 to 2.0 × 10−7 M. Similarly, variable temperature measurements in dioxane (see ESI†, Fig. S2) also showed no considerable changes. Fig. 2  (a) Concentration-dependent UV/vis spectra of 4 (1.2 × 10−5 M to 2.0 × 10−7 M, black lines) and 5 (2.0 × 10−3 M to 1.5 × 10−5 M, red lines) in dioxane. The dashed red line corresponds to the calculated dimer spectrum of 5 obtained from the data at two different concentrations and the dimerization constant. Arrows indicate the spectral changes upon increasing concentration. (b) Top and (c) side view of the geometry-optimized structure of 4 (butyl chains are replaced by methyl groups; red double-arrows in (b) indicate intramolecular contacts observed for dye 4 in d8-dioxane for the folded state based on 2D ROESY NMR). This outcome is in contrast to previously reported observations on the formation of merocyanine dimer aggregates14–16,23,24 by intermolecular self-assembly that disclose distinct spectral changes upon concentration and temperature variations as also evidenced in concentration-dependent spectra of reference merocyanine dye 5 (Fig. 2a, red solid lines). On the other hand, the absorption band of bis(merocyanine) 4 shows the characteristic shape of a dimer aggregate with a prominent hypsochromically shifted transition whose position at λmax = 513 nm is in accordance with the calculated, but experimentally not accessible, ideal dimer aggregate spectrum of 5 (λmax = 506 nm, red dashed line).To further substantiate the intramolecular folding of bis(merocyanine) dye 4, 2D ROESY NMR spectroscopy experiments were carried out in d8-dioxane. Here, an additional cross-peak between the thiophene proton H1 (see Fig. 2b) and the methyl group of the pyridone heterocycle was observed, which could not be observed in dichloromethane where dye 4 is in an unfolded “open” conformation (for the ROESY NMR spectra in d8-dioxane and d2-dichloromethane see the ESI,† Fig. S6). The distances between these protons within a single chromophore are far beyond the sensitivity of this technique, thus providing clear evidence for the intramolecular dimer structure as additional DOSY experiments (see ESI,† Fig. S7) as well as the unchanged UV/vis spectra upon dilution (see above) exclude the formation of oligomeric aggregates. Fig. 2b and c depict the geometry-optimized structural model of bis(merocyanine) 4 in the folded state based on ROESY NMR and molecular modeling performed by force field calculations (Macro Model, Amber). These studies reveal a π–π distance of 3.5 Å and a rotational twist of approximately 34° between the two merocyanine chromophores of 4. The substantial twist angle explains the shoulder at longer wavelength (λ ∼ 535 nm) as originating from the lower energy excitonic transition.22Folding-driven supramolecular polymerizationIn our earlier work, we have shown that THF–methylcyclohexane (MCH) mixtures provide control over the solvent permittivity from a nonpolar (pure MCH: εr = 2.2) to a quite polar character (pure THF: εr = 7.5).14–16 Thus, in a nonpolar environment merocyanine aggregation is favoured, while in polar media solvation of dipolar dyes prevails with a concomitant weak driving force for dye aggregation. Thus, as the next step UV/vis experiments in THF–MCH mixtures were performed in dilute solutions (c = 1 × 10−6 M) to investigate the thermodynamic driving force for the intra- and intermolecular aggregation of bis(merocyanine) dye 4 (Fig. 3, upper panel). In pure THF the unfolded state of 4 exclusively exists as the thermodynamically favoured species. With increasing contents of nonpolar MCH the monomer band at λmax = 536 nm decreases with concomitant appearance of the dimer band at λmax = 513 nm, which corresponds to the folded state of 4. The presence of a well-defined quasi-isosbestic point at λ = 522 nm indicates that the unfolded and folded conformers of 4 coexist in a two-species equilibrium. To obtain a quantitative measure for the degree of folding in this two-state equilibrium, the solvent-dependent UV/vis data were analysed according to the procedure established by Moore and Ray,25 providing equilibrium constants Keq and the corresponding free energy change ΔG for the folding process.26–28 Based on this analysis the extrapolated value for the free energy change ΔG upon folding in pure MCH was determined to be −6.8 ± 0.5 kJ mol−1 (inset in Fig. 3, upper panel; for details of this analysis see the ESI†). Fig. 3  Solvent-dependent UV/vis spectra of dye 4 in THF–MCH mixtures (upper panel: 1 × 10−6 M; lower panel: 5 × 10−6 M) at 25 °C starting in pure THF (grey line) and successively increasing the volume fraction of MCH. Arrows indicate the spectral changes upon increasing the volume fraction of MCH. Inset in upper panel: plot of the ΔG values for the folding process of 4 derived from the spectral development at 536 nm (■) and 513 nm (). The black and the red lines are the respective fitting curves of linear regression analyses at 536 nm and 513 nm.  denotes the apparent absorption coefficient at the respective concentration and solvent composition. An increase of dye 4 concentration in solvent-dependent UV/vis experiments did not evoke appreciable changes in the shape of the absorption spectra up to a critical solvent composition (see ESI,† Fig. S3) indicating that the preceding folding–unfolding equilibrium is solely dependent on the solvent polarity. However, at a MCH content of 80% and at a higher concentration of c = 5 × 10−6 M (Fig. 3, lower panel), a sharp, strongly hypsochromically shifted band appears abruptly, suggesting a further aggregation process of the intramolecular foldamers into extended π-stacks. The hypsochromic shift by 122 nm to λmax = 414 nm is a typical signature of an H-aggregate.14 Its formation by supramolecular polymerization29 is corroborated by the reversible association–dissociation equilibrium upon temperature variation of the 80 vol% MCH solution (see ESI,† Fig. S4). Similar spectroscopic changes upon variation of solvent composition and concentration could be observed in CHCl3–MCH solvent mixtures (see ESI,† Fig. S5).BHJ solar cellsThe impact of folding, i.e. π–π stacking driven by conformational changes, on the generation of photocurrent was subsequently elucidated in solution-processed BHJ solar cells. Here, bis(merocyanine) 4 was applied as the electron-donating component and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron-acceptor component, utilizing the general device architecture glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/dye:PCBM (50 nm)/Al. BHJ solar cells with a weight-ratio optimized active layer based on 5:PCBM (30:70)30 were used as reference devices. It is noteworthy that very high concentrations (c ∼ 10 mM) are necessary for solution-processed BHJ devices to achieve the demanded active layer thicknesses of >50 nm. To comply with the solubility properties of fullerenes almost exclusively chlorinated solvents are applied for the preparation of BHJ devices by solution processing.4,12,13 In our experiments the active layer was processed from a chloroform (εr = 4.8) solution, while dye aggregation in the blend film, similar to the previous work in solution, was induced by the addition of 20 vol% toluene (εr = 2.4) or o-xylene (εr = 2.6), resp., as the low polarity solvents. It is important to note that bis(merocyanine) 4 initially prevails in an unfolded state in these solvent mixtures and will only fold upon the evaporation of the more volatile chloroform upon formation of the active layer by spin-coating. Thin film absorption spectra of 4:PCBM blends from different processing solvent mixtures are depicted in Fig. 4a. The absorption maximum of blends cast from pure CHCl3 is at λmax = 557 nm and shows a hypsochromically shifted shoulder at λ = 520 nm, implying the existence of a mixture of folded and unfolded dyes. In contrast, for thin films cast from CHCl3 with 20 vol% of toluene or o-xylene a new H-type absorption band at λmax = 446 nm is observed with concomitant disappearance of the shoulder at λ = 520 nm (attributed to folded dimer aggregates). These observations suggest that further intermolecular aggregation occurred for folded dye molecules, while dyes in the unfolded state (λ = 560 nm) remained unaffected. Slow evaporation of the higher boiling aromatic solvent results in a slower film forming process and allows for increased intermolecular aggregation. Therefore, films cast from CHCl3–o-xylene show the highest H-band absorptions. Notably, solvent additives with a higher polarity than CHCl3, such as chlorobenzene (εr = 5.6) and o-dichlorobenzene (εr = 7.5), did not initiate the formation of H-aggregates (see ESI,† Fig. S9). Likewise, the absorption spectra of thin films of 5:PCBM blends cast from CHCl3–toluene or o-xylene mixtures do not exhibit any considerable changes from films cast with pure CHCl3 (see ESI,† Fig. S10a), demonstrating the importance of the folding process for the formation of the H-band in 4:PCBM devices. Fig. 4  (a) Thin film absorption and (b) EQE spectra of 4:PCBM (30:70) blends in dependence on the casting solvent mixture CHCl3 (black line), CHCl3–toluene (red line) and CHCl3–o-xylene (grey line). The arrow indicates the emergence of the H-aggregate band. These solvent-dependent processing conditions of 4:PCBM blends resulted also in distinctly different solar cell characteristics as summarized in Table 1. Most strikingly, an almost twofold increase of the short-circuit current density JSC was observed upon addition of nonpolar solvent additive o-xylene for 4:PCBM cells. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements revealed that this increase of the photocurrent originates entirely from the H-aggregated dyes (Fig. 4b). Thus, whilst the EQE spectrum of the device cast from pure CHCl3 exhibits very low contributions to the photocurrent in the region between 400–500 nm (<10% at the minimum at λ = 440 nm), the emergence of the H-aggregate in the CHCl3–toluene and CHCl3–o-xylene devices induces a substantial increase of the EQE between 400–500 nm. For the latter, the calculated JSC (EQE) (see the ESI† for derivation of this value) was almost tripled in the spectral region between 400–500 nm compared to the blend cast from CHCl3. Indeed, this wavelength range now even provides the largest contribution to the total photocurrent with a maximum of the EQE curve of 38% at λmax = 450 nm (Fig. 4b), which corresponds to a fourfold increase compared to the device manufactured from CHCl3. In our opinion, this increase of photocurrent originates from the improved exciton and charge carrier transport properties of the well-ordered H-aggregated dye manifold (λmax = 450 nm) compared to the more amorphous regions (λmax = 560 nm), where these merocyanine dyes are packed rather randomly leading to a pronounced dispersion of the density of states.31

Thus, whilst more photons could be converted into electricity (higher JSC), their electrical potential is reduced as evidenced by the reduction of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of about 200 mV. Obviously, the decrease of VOC is directly related to the presence of H-aggregated dyes (see data in Table 1) which corroborates our earlier assumption of significant changes of the frontier orbital energy levels of the merocyanine dyes upon π-stacking.30ConclusionsIn summary, this edge article described a new bis(merocyanine) dye whose folding into a π-stacked conformation could be controlled by the polarity of the solvent. From this preorganized folded structure extended π-stacks could be prepared upon increasing concentration, leading to a ∼120 nm hypsochromically shifted H-band. Integration of these H-aggregates into BHJ solar cells with PCBM fullerene demonstrated a pronounced increase of photocurrent, which was attributed to improved percolation pathways for excitons and charge carriers in the H-aggregated dye manifold.AcknowledgementsFinancial support by the DFG within the priority program “Elementary Processes of Organic Photovoltaics” (WU 317/10 and ME 1246/19) is gratefully acknowledged.Notes and referencesR.
