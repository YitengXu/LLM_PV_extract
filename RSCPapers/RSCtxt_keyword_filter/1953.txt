    , Accepted 24th December 2022First published on 30th December 2022AbstractNon-toxicity and stability make two-dimensional (2D) bismuth halide perovskites better alternatives to lead-based ones for optoelectronic applications and catalysis. In this work, we synthesize sub-micron size colloidal quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets and study their generation and relaxation of charge carriers. Steady-state absorption spectroscopy reveals an indirect bandgap of 2.07 eV, which is supported by the band structure calculated using density functional theory. The nanosheets show no detectable photoluminescence at room temperature at near bandgap excitation which is attributed to the indirect bandgap. However, cathodoluminescence spanning a broad range from 500 nm to 750 nm with an asymmetric and Stokes-shifted emission is observed, indicating the phonon- and trap-assisted recombination of charge carriers. We study the ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The samples are excited with photon energies higher than their bandgap, and the results are interpreted in terms of hot carrier generation (<1 ps), thermalization with local phonons (∼1 ps), and cooling (>30 ps). Further, a relatively slow relaxation of excitons (≳3 ns) at the band edge suggests the formation of stable polarons which decay nonradiatively by releasing phonons.Sushant GhimireSushant Ghimire was born in Nepal.

Introduction
The outstanding improvement in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells from 3.8% (ref. 1) to 25.7% (ref. 2) achieved in the last thirteen years demonstrates that lead halide perovskites are excellent light-harvesting materials. Besides photovoltaics, lead halide perovskites are also promising for light-emitting diodes (LEDs),3 photodetectors,4 lasers,5 and catalysis.6 However, the use of lead-bearing perovskites in optoelectronic devices and catalysis suffers from two limitations. The first one is stability since the three-dimensional (3D) ABX3 [A = Cs, methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+), and formamidinium (FA, NH2CHNH2+); B = Pb; and X = Cl, Br, I] structures are easily disintegrated into their constituent ions by water or other polar solvents and can undergo photodegradation.7–10 This limitation can be uplifted to some extent by using bulky organic spacer cations such as butylammonium, pentylammonium, hexylammonium,11 octyldiammonium,12 phenylethylammonium,13 (aminomethyl)piperidinium,14 and (aminomethyl)pyridinium15 which form two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper or Dion-Jacobson structures. In these structures, the inorganic (PbX6)4− octahedral layers are sandwiched between the hydrophobic organic spacer layers and isolated from the surrounding, resulting in better stability to moisture.16 Another limitation that APbX3 perovskites have is their toxicity to the environment and humans.17 Tin or germanium halide perovskites are not considered suitable substitutes for lead-bearing perovskites because they are intrinsically unstable due to their oxidation from +2 to higher (+4) oxidation states.18,19 In addition, Sn2+ and Ge2+ cannot completely overtake Pb2+ in terms of toxicity, as the former are of similar environmental and human health concern as Pb.20 Therefore, a stable and non-toxic alternative to Pb is needed for the practical and benign applications of halide perovskites.
Substitution of Pb2+ by an isoelectronic Bi3+ forms a low-toxic A3Bi2X9 alternative to APbX3 perovskites. Unlike 3D APbX3, A3Bi2X9 are low dimensional perovskites where the additional B-site charge is compensated by ordered vacancies.21,22 The (BiX6)3− octahedra are either face-sharing or corner-sharing to form zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), or 2D structures.21,23 For example, A3Bi2I9 consists of isolated (Bi2I9)3− dimers of face-sharing octahedra arranged hexagonally to form a 0D molecular salt crystal structure. The hexagonal voids are occupied by Cs+ or MA+ cations. Besides, the Cs3BiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) polymorphs of A3Bi2X9 perovskites are also known in the form of 0D (Cs3BiCl6 and Cs3BiBr6) and 3D (Cs3BiI6) structures.23 Such a huge structural diversity results in distinctive electronic band features, optoelectronic properties, and defect chemistry in bismuth-bearing perovskites.24,25
Among the various bismuth-bearing perovskites, A3Bi2I9 (A = Cs, MA) are of particular interest because they are potential light absorbers for photovoltaics and catalysis in the visible spectrum.26–29 These perovskites have indirect bandgaps.22 On the other hand, the 0D molecular salt crystal structure leads to strong quantum confinement with higher effective masses of the charge carriers and large exciton binding energy either in their bulk or nanostructured form.30 Solar cells using A3Bi2X9 bulk film as light absorber were first reported in 2015 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.09% for Cs3Bi2I9, 0.12% for MA3Bi2I9, and 0.003% for MA3Bi2I9−xClx.26 More than half a decade later, the current maximum PCE is still 3.2% which is for a Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheet film.27 The strong quantum confinement of charge carriers in 0D (Bi2I9)3− dimers limits photoconductivity and carrier diffusion in A3Bi2I9 (A = Cs, MA) perovskites, which is detrimental for photovoltaic applications.31 Although the performance of bismuth halide perovskites is far below that of APbX3 perovskites, there are ample opportunities to utilize these materials in photovoltaics and catalysis by taking advantage of their low toxicity, structural diversity, and unique electronic band properties. Therefore, synthesis and study of colloidal A3Bi2X9 perovskites are plausible not only for replacing toxic APbX3 perovskites with improved performance but also for the fundamental understanding of the optoelectronic processes in them.
Earlier studies of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites focused mainly on their optoelectronic applications, based on either bulk single crystals32 and films31 or non-colloidally synthesized nanosheets and nanoplates.27,33,34 Ultrafast charge-carrier dynamics revealing hot carrier generation and their slow cooling in bulk Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites have been studied but the mechanism of intraband cooling of these hot carriers in their colloidal counterparts is barely discussed.31,35,36 Additionally, some reports have discussed direct bandgap and sharp PL in colloidally-prepared Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets and nanocrystals,37,38 which is unusual since these materials typically have indirect bandgap and lack detectable sharp PL at room temperature.22 Therefore, the optoelectronic properties and charge carrier dynamics of colloidal Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites need to be clarified not only for their potential applications but also for the development of the new type of lead-free perovskites. Nevertheless, a complete study on the size-selective colloidal synthesis, optoelectronic properties, band structure, and ultrafast charge carrier dynamics of Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets is lacking and our current work addresses this need. In this work, we synthesized sub-micron large colloidal quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets and characterized them using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Although Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites have a 0D molecular crystal structure,22 we define our sample as “quasi-2D” based on its 2D hexagonal nanosheet morphology where (Bi2I9)3− dimers are stacked in multiple layers. Further discussion on the layered structure of our sample is provided in the Results and discussion section. We theoretically investigated the electronic band structure of the quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets and clarified their optoelectronic properties and charge carrier dynamics using cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy, steady-state UV-vis absorption, and transient absorption spectroscopy. While these colloidal nanosheets are non-luminescent under photoexcitation, they show broadband and Stokes-shifted CL when excited with the electron beam, indicating the phonon- and trap-assisted recombination of charge carriers. The transient absorption measurements show slow relaxation dynamics (≳3 ns) of the excitons. Such slow carrier relaxation suggests strong self-trapping of excitons through the formation of stable polarons.22 Investigation of ultrafast carrier dynamics above the bandgap of colloidal quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets reveals the generation of hot carriers on a sub-picosecond time scale and their cooling within several picoseconds. The delayed exciton recombination in Cs3Bi2I9 can be used to efficiently harvest charge carriers for photovoltaics and catalysis.
Results and discussion
We used a two-step approach, the hot-injection method followed by selective reprecipitation, to synthesize the sub-micron large colloidal quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets. A synthesis scheme is shown in Fig. 1, and the synthesis technique is discussed in detail in the Experimental section. In the first step, octylammonium iodide dissolved in γ-butyrolactone was injected into a mixture of cesium oleate and bismuth oleate in diphenyl ether at 120 °C. The reaction was quenched after 30 s by placing the reaction mixture in an ice bath. The precipitate and the supernatant were separated by centrifugation and collected. Here, the precipitate contains nanoplates with nonuniform size distribution. Characterization of these nanoplates obtained from the hot-injection method is given in the ESI in Fig. S1.† In the second step, size-selective reprecipitation was performed by adding isopropyl alcohol dropwise to the supernatant. Zhang et al.32 have reported a nucleation-controlled solution method to grow centimeter-sized Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite single crystals where the excess nucleation seeds in the form of sub-millimeter-sized perovskite crystallites were removed by decantation once they were formed when the reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 24 hours. The large single crystals were then grown from the supernatant by heating the system at 80 °C to 95 °C at a rate of 2 °C day−1. In our case, we controlled the concentration of nucleation seeds by removing size-distributed nanoplates formed by hot injection in the first step. Further, the supernatant with a critical concentration of nucleation seeds was supersaturated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol which resulted in the precipitation of the large-sized colloidal nanosheets in a much shorter time (2–5 min) and at room temperature. Here, the critical concentration means the optimal concentration of nucleation seeds required to grow sub-micron large nanosheets. We characterized the morphology and elemental composition of the samples by using STEM and EDX spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A shows the STEM image of the quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets which reveal a hexagonal shape. The lateral dimensions are in the range of 500 nm. Fig. 2B shows the EDX mapping of a nanosheet revealing the uniform distribution of Cs, Bi, and I elements. The corresponding EDX spectrum along with the atomic fraction of the constituent elements are given in the ESI (Fig. S2†). Fig. 2C shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the sample. The corresponding height profiles of the nanosheets are shown in Fig. 2D revealing an average thickness of 32 nm.

We studied the crystal structure of the quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets by powder XRD, SAED, and HR-TEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The powder XRD pattern of our sample (Fig. 3A) agrees with the Powder Diffraction File (PDF) card number 01-073-0707 and Cs3Bi2I9 single crystal data reported by Zhang et al. which reveals a hexagonal crystal structure with a P63/mmc space group.32 The prominent (006) diffraction peak indicates that the crystal has preferential growth along the c-axis. Further, the SAED displays sharp and hexagonally-ordered lattice diffraction spots, indicating high crystalline quality (Fig. 3B). The diffraction spots are indexed as (100), (110), (200), (205), (300), and (0010) for the d-spacing values of 7.30 Å, 4.20 Å, 3.60 Å, 2.70 Å, 2.41 Å, and 2.11 Å, respectively which agree with the values calculated from the XRD data (ESI Table S1†). The HR-TEM and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) images in Fig. 3C and the inverse FFT image in Fig. 3D show the hexagonal lattice. We also measured d(100) and d(110) as 7.40 Å and 4.10 Å from the inverse FFT image in Fig. 3D which are comparable with the values obtained from our SAED and XRD measurements. These results confirm the hexagonal crystal structure of our Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheet.

Fig. 3E displays the XRD pattern of the quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets in a thin film which shows diffraction peaks with (002), (004), (006), (0010), and (0012) Miller indices.32 The diffraction peaks corresponding to (002), (004), and (006) are equally spaced with a periodicity of 8.4° 2θ angle and a d-spacing of 1.052 nm, indicating a layered crystal lattice and the preferential orientation of the nanosheets in the film. Cs3Bi2I9 crystal structure consists of isolated 0D (Bi2I9)3− dimers formed by face-sharing of bismuth iodide octahedra which are surrounded by the (Cs+) A-site cations.32Fig. 3F is the 1 × 3 × 1 supercell crystal structure of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites obtained from the PDF card 01-073-0707. It shows a layered arrangement of 0D (Bi2I9)3− dimers along the ab (00l) plane with a d-spacing of 1.059 nm and further supports our layered crystal structure model in Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets. For a hexagonal crystal structure (α = β = 90° and γ = 120°), we used d(hkl) values obtained from the XRD data (ESI Table S1†) and calculated the lattice parameters using eqn (1). The calculated lattice parameters are a = b = 8.40 Å and c = 21.20 Å (1)which is in line with the values reported for 3D single crystals of Cs3Bi2I9 (a = b = 8.39 Å, and c = 21.20 Å).32 We also simulated the Cs3Bi2I9 crystal structure based on these calculated lattice parameters which are shown in the ESI in Fig. S3.†
We studied the optical and electronic properties of quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets using steady-state UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and CL spectroscopy, which are shown in Fig. 4. The absorption spectrum in Fig. 4A exhibits a broad absorption onset and a sharp excitonic peak at 495 nm. While the sharp absorption peak is the result of strong confinement of excitons in the isolated 0D (Bi2I9)3− dimers, the broad absorption onset is the result of an indirect bandgap.38 We also do not rule out the presence of surface defects in these nanosheets which contribute to the tail in the absorption spectrum.39 An indirect bandgap value of 2.07 eV is obtained from the Tauc plot, as shown in Fig. 4B. The indirect bandgap in Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites leads to phonon-mediated relaxation of excitons at the band edge, reducing the probability of radiative recombination.22 As a result, our sample shows no detectable photoluminescence at room temperature when excited near the bandgap. Previous studies have reported luminescent Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites at room temperature which was attributed to self-trapped excitons and defect emission,22,40 while others show photoluminescence only at cryogenic temperatures.41,42 On the contrary, some reports also show that the photoluminescence in Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br, I) at room temperature does not originate from the perovskite structure itself but the precursor salt BiX3.43 We recorded the excitation spectrum of the sample, as shown in the ESI in Fig. S4,† which is not identical to the absorption spectrum and shows no prominent excitation band at the bandgap. Instead, an excitation band of unknown origin in the deep UV region (<250 nm) is observed. This is in line with the finding that our sample does not emit when photoexcited near the bandgap.

The CL spectrum was fitted using the Gaussian function. (i) and (ii) are the first and second fitted peaks, and (iii) is the cumulative fitted peak. 
To elucidate the luminescence properties of quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets, we performed CL spectroscopy at 7.0 keV electron beam acceleration voltage and 500 pA electron beam current. Fig. 4C and D show the secondary electron (SE) image and the corresponding CL intensity map, respectively. The non-uniform distribution of CL intensities in Fig. 4D is most likely due to the stacking of multiple nanosheets and differences in their surface texture. We also do not rule out the crystallographic defect-related CL intensity distribution.44–46 Nevertheless, the defect-related CL was not resolved in the intensity map which is also supported by the similar panchromatic CL maps of the same sample without and with (500/50 nm and 600/50 nm) bandpass filters (ESI Fig. S5†). Fig. 4E shows a typical CL spectrum of a single quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheet which reveals a broad and asymmetric emission. The broadening of CL spectra in the case of lead-bearing 2D halide perovskites has been attributed to the formation of an electron beam-induced defect and thermal effects induced by the population of higher vibrational modes due to high-energy electron excitation.47 In our case, the CL spectrum can be deconvoluted by fitting two Gaussians, one of which is narrow (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 78 nm) and centered at 585 nm while the other is relatively broad (FWHM = 158 nm) and centered around 644 nm. The CL at 585 nm (2.11 eV) is close to the bandgap of the material and is therefore considered to originate from the band-edge recombination of excitons. On the other hand, CL at 644 nm (1.92 eV) is anticipated from a defect- or trap-assisted recombination which agrees well with the observations by Gosh et al.31 They have reported a broad and asymmetric CL spectrum in Cs3Bi2I9 thin film which was resolved into two peaks, one at 2.5 eV which they assigned to the direct exciton emission, and another at 1.91 eV which was assigned to the emission from self-trapped excitons by extrinsic defects.
We calculated the electronic band structure and partial density of states (DOS) of quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets using the crystal structure modeled from our experimental XRD data (ESI Fig. S3†) and a Density Functional Theory (DFT)48,49 with the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)50 functional. The band structure shown in Fig. 5A is consistent with the earlier report51 and well supports the indirect bandgap nature of these materials. Here, a minimum of the conduction band occurs at Γ point and the maximum of the valence band occurs at the M point of the Brillouin zone. The theoretical indirect bandgap (1.99 eV) is in close agreement with the experimental value. Partial DOS of quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets is shown in Fig. 5B which reveals that the valence band maximum is mainly formed by I 5p–Bi 6s hybrid orbitals and the conduction band minimum is formed by Bi 6p–I 5p hybrid orbitals. Nevertheless, Cs-bearing orbitals do not contribute to the band edge and only form the higher conduction band. Further, in those hybrid orbitals at the band edge, the I 5p and Bi 6p orbitals have a greater contribution to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, respectively. This picture of the band structure in Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites greatly supports the 0D molecular crystal structure of these materials where the band edges are formed by the hybridization of Bi and I orbitals, and therefore the charge carriers generated are confined within these hybrid orbitals. In other words, the excitons in Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites are strongly confined within the isolated 0D (Bi2I9)3− dimers.

We investigated the charge carrier dynamics in quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets at different excitation energies and intensities using a femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 6 and ESI Fig. S6†). The transient absorption dynamics of the sample excited at a given photon energy but with different excitation intensities are comparable (ESI Fig. S6†) for the time window of the measurements (∼2 ns) and the range of applied excitation intensities (30–200 μW). Fig. 6A and B show the transient absorption spectra of the sample excited with a photon energy of 3.10 eV (400 nm) and 2.48 eV (500 nm), respectively at comparable excitation intensities. These transient absorption spectra show three distinct features: a negative signal (photobleach) at 2.5 eV (495 nm) and two positive bands on either side of the bleach. The photobleach at 2.5 eV is consistent with the steady-state absorption peak (495 nm) and is assigned to a ground-state photobleach (GSPB). Scholz et al. have shown the similarity of such a transient absorption feature with two positive bands on either side of the GSPB in (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 perovskites to the second derivative of the steady-state absorption.52 They attributed the second derivative-like feature of transient absorption spectra to a Stark effect arising from the overlap of two absorption band onsets originating from two energetically close and broadly absorbing electronic states in the conduction band. Rosi et al., on the other hand, have attributed the origin of the positive band on the higher energy side of the GSPB in strongly quantum-confined halide perovskites to the light-induced activation of parity-forbidden exciton transitions enabled by the formation of symmetry-breaking polarons.53 In our case, the shape of the transient absorption spectra at higher energy regions can be largely explained by a broadening of the ground state absorption. This is suggested by the observation that the second derivative of the ground state absorption shown in Fig. 6E and F and the ESI (Fig. S7†) resembles the transient absorption spectra at 470 nm and GSPB. The positive band at 470 nm (i.e., energy above the GSPB) in the transient absorption spectra is narrow and spectrally well-defined (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the positive signal at energies below the GSPB (>520 nm) is broad and not reproduced by the second derivative of the steady-state absorption (Fig. 6E and F and ESI Fig. S7†). This indicates that there are additional photoinduced contributions to the absorption in this region which can be assigned as photoinduced absorption (PA) or excited state absorption (ESA). Here, PA is largely dominated by the intraband transition of the charge carriers generated by the photon pulse. (2)

The green dotted plot is the smoothed second derivative of the steady-state absorption spectrum. 
We fitted the transient absorption spectra globally using a sequential rate model (see ESI†). It is found that the stretched exponential time dependencies given by eqn (2) fit well with three decay components for the population dynamics, as shown in Fig. 6C and D. The stretched exponential time dependences reflect a distribution of decay rates related to an observed relaxation step that could result from a disorder in the system,54 for example, in our case it could be different thicknesses of the nanosheets and distribution of surface-defects. The three carrier lifetime components and the evolution-associated spectra (EAS) are obtained from the fitting. The results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6C–F. In our sequential model, the EAS shown in Fig. 6E and F represents the spectra of the optically excited and the two intermediate states, all dominated by a broad ground-state absorption. The long carrier lifetime (≳3 ns) is attributed to the relaxation of excitons at the indirect bandgap, while the short (∼1.5 ps) and intermediate (∼30–70 ps) lifetime components involve the intraband cooling of hot carriers generated by excitation of the nanosheets above their bandgap. The short carrier lifetimes (τ1) are comparable at low (2.48 eV) and high (3.1 eV) excitation energy. On the other hand, the intermediate carrier lifetime components (τ2) vary for these two excitation energies (Table 1). Further, in our analysis, the best global fit of the transient absorption spectra for both the excitation energies was obtained by a value between 3 and 3.5 ns for the third carrier lifetime component (τ3). On the other hand, we find systematic deviations for smaller τ3 values (<2.5 ns) although it is comparable to our measurement time window. Also, deviations in the fit are observed for very large τ3 values. Hence, an absolute τ3 cannot be assigned, and we consider it as greater than or equivalent to 3 ns (i.e. ≳3 ns). τ3 larger than the measurement time window indicates that the accompanying exciton relaxation process at the indirect bandgap in our sample occurs at a slower time scale and requires a picosecond or nanosecond time-resolved spectroscopy for detailed study which will be considered in the future. The ESA for 3.10 eV excitation energy is much broader than that for 2.48 eV, which is due to the distribution of hot carriers over a larger number of higher energy states above and below the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum, respectively. This is evident because more energy states are accessible to the hot charge carriers when they are generated with higher photon energy.

A proposed mechanism of charge carrier relaxation in quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets is shown schematically in Fig. 7. When the nanosheets are excited with photon energy larger than their bandgap, highly energetic charge carriers are generated deep into the conduction and valence bands, which are called hot charge carriers. The generation of hot charge carriers happens at a sub-picosecond time scale. The hot electrons and holes then thermalize with the local lattice phonons which envelop these charge carriers and form hot polarons. In our case, the short dynamics of 1.5 ps can be assigned to this thermalization process. Afterward, the hot polarons equilibrate with the lattice by cooling down to the band edge and turning into cold polarons. In our case, this happened within 30–70 ps depending upon the energy of excitation. The longer time (>70 ps) in the case of 3.10 eV photon energy excitation when compared to the 2.48 eV excitation (30 ps) can be attributed to higher hot carrier temperature in the case of the former which takes a relatively long time to cool down. Finally, once the cold polarons reach the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum at the indirect bandgap, the exciton relaxes to the ground state by releasing phonons. In our case, this relaxation is delayed and happens on a ≳3 ns time scale. Frost et al. have discussed such a formation and cooling of hot polarons in direct bandgap MAPbI3 perovskites.55 They have reported a typical time scale of 1–100 fs for hot carrier generation, 1–10 ps for their thermalization and hot polaron formation, and 10–100 ps for hot polaron cooling. Further, Wong et al. have reported a very long lifetime of >4 ns for the polaron population decay in 3D MAPbI3 perovskites.56 The electron–phonon coupling and formation of polarons not only affect the charge carrier dynamics in Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites but also influence their luminescence properties. Although we could not detect photoluminescence in our sample, the observation of broad and asymmetric CL suggests electron–phonon coupling and self-trapping of polarons. McCall et al. have demonstrated strong electron–phonon interactions in A3B2I9 (A = Cs, Rb and B = Bi, Sb) perovskites which induce the formation of small polarons.22 These polarons are self-trapped within the lattice resulting in broadband emission. The reported trends of hot carrier generation, cooling, and relaxation in direct bandgap perovskites greatly support our current findings and proposed mechanism except that in their case, the final relaxation of charge carriers emits photons while in our case, it is nonradiative and releases phonons.

Experimental
Materials
All reagents were commercially purchased and used without further purification: cesium acetate (Tokyo Chemical Industries, 98.0%), bismuth acetate (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99.99%), n-octylammonium iodide (Greatcell Solar Materials, >99%), oleic acid (Sigma Aldrich, 90%), diphenyl ether (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), toluene (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99.5%), and γ-butyrolactone (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99%).
Methods

Synthesis of quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets. 
In a hot-injection method, cesium acetate (0.1 mmol, 20 mg), bismuth acetate (0.1 mmol, 40 mg), and oleic acid (3.16 mmol, 1 mL) were dissolved and dried in diphenyl ether (10 mL) in a three-neck flask under stirring and high vacuum at 80 °C for 1.5 h. Afterward, under argon flush, the temperature of the reaction mixture was increased to 120 °C and n-octylammonium iodide (1.6 mmol, 411 mg) dissolved in γ-butyrolactone (300 μL) was injected. The reaction was quenched by placing the reaction mixture in an ice bath after 30 s. After quenching, it was centrifuged, and the orange-colored supernatant and precipitate were separated. The precipitate was washed three times by repeatedly dispersing it in toluene and centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 10 min. It was finally collected for further characterization. The supernatant was subjected to a size-selective reprecipitation of the sub-micron large quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets by adding 3–5 mL of isopropyl alcohol dropwise into it and letting it stand undisturbed for 2 to 5 min. Purification of the selectively precipitated large nanosheets was carried out by their repeated centrifugation and washing with toluene as shown in Fig. 1.


Characterization of quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets. 
We characterized the morphology, elemental composition, thickness, and crystal structure of Cs3Bi2I9 samples using TEM in STEM and HR-TEM modes (ThermoFisher Talos L120C) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector, non-contact mode AFM (XE-100, Park Systems), and XRD (Aeris X-ray diffractometer, Malvern Panalytical). TEM samples were prepared on carbon-coated copper grids and HR-TEM samples were prepared on holy carbon-coated copper grids. The acceleration voltage was 200 kV. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was performed on the individual nanosheet in TEM. For AFM, samples were prepared by dropping a dilute solution of the nanosheet on a silicon wafer which was then mounted on a stainless-steel holder through a double-sided adhesive tape. The AFM images were analyzed using Gwyddion a open-source software.57 Powder XRD was performed on dried powdered nanosheet samples as well as the corresponding film deposited on a low-background silica disc. The wavelength of the Cu-kα1 X-ray radiation was 1.540598 Å. Lattice parameters were calculated from the XRD data, and a unit cell crystal structure was modeled. All the drawings of the crystal structure were produced using VESTA software.58

Measurements of optoelectronic properties

Ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) absorption and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy. 
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Lambda 1050+ UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer from PerkinElmer. PLE spectra were recorded on a spectrofluorometer FS5 from Edinburg Instrument. For the PLE measurement, a virtual emission wavelength at 600 nm (which corresponds to the absorption onset) was set, and the excitation scan was performed in a range of 200 nm to 550 nm with an emission and excitation slit width of 5 and 3 nm, respectively. Both the UV-vis and the PLE spectra were measured in a 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm quartz cuvette filled with the colloidal solution of quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets in toluene.


Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy. 
Cathodoluminescence measurements were performed in a Zeiss Merlin scanning electron microscope equipped with a DELMIC Sparc CL spectrograph. All spectra were collected at an electron beam energy of 7 keV and a current of 500 pA. To counteract the bleaching of the sample, the electron beam was moved during the 30 s exposure time.

Band structure calculation
The density functional theory (DFT) package, ABINIT package,48,49 a joint project of the Université Catholique de Louvain, Corning Incorporated, and other contributors (https://www.abinit.org) was used for band structure and density of states calculations. As exchange functional, Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)50 and Hartwigsen–Goedecker–Hutter pseudopotentials59 were used. Further simulation parameters are – energy cutoff: 40 eV, convergence tolerance on the difference of total energy: 1.0 × 10−10 Hartree, number of grid points for k-points generation: 2 2 2, number of simulated bands: 180, number of k-point in the band diagram: 30. The lattice parameters were fixed to the experimental values.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
For femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy two set-ups were used depending on the desired excitation wavelength. Both set-ups have in common, that the output of a 1 kHz regenerative Ti: sapphire amplifier laser system is split for the generation of a probe and a photon beam. As a probe beam, a supercontinuum white light ranging from 350 nm to 750 nm was generated in a CaF2 crystal. The pump beam was obtained by either frequency doubling or pumping a noncollinear optical parametric amplifier. In the latter case, the pulse was temporally compressed by a fused-silica prism compressor. The intensity was adapted by two wire grid polarizers. The polarization of the pump and the probe were set at a magical angle orientation relative to each other by a half-wave plate. Additional data at parallel and vertical polarization is acquired. Both beams were focused into a 1 mm thick quartz cuvette filled with the sample with the optical density of 0.13 (at 400 nm) and 0.11 (at 500 nm). The cuvette was rotated with a frequency of 100 per min to avoid photodegradation. The transmitted probe beam was spectrally dispersed by a prism and detected by a photodiode array detector. The pump light was chopped with half of the repetition rate of the probe beam allowing us to calculate transient absorption by comparing the absorption with and without excitation by the pump beam.
For excitation at 500 nm (2.48 eV), a NOPA was pumped by the laser system output (CPA 2001, Clark MXR, Inc.). Its output pulses were compressed by the prism compressor to 40 fs (full width at half maximum, FWHM) pulse duration. The pump and probe beams were focused on overlapping spots of 180 μm and 75 μm (FWHM values). For excitation at 400 nm (3.10 eV), the laser system fundamental at 800 nm center wavelength was frequency doubled. The focus sizes of the pump and probe beams were 110 μm and 20 μm (FWHM values). The pump was chopped at a quarter and the probe at half of the repetition rate of the laser system (Spitfire Ace PA, Spectra-Physics). Using the resulting four signals for multishot-referencing increases the signal-to-noise ratio of acquired data. The time resolution was 100 fs for both of the set-ups. The relative error of the time constants is estimated as 10%.
Conclusions
In summary, a critical concentration of nucleation seeds is needed for the growth of sub-micron large colloidal quasi-2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanosheets which was achieved in our case by removing size-distributed nanoplates obtained from the hot injection method. Subsequent supersaturation resulting from the addition of isopropyl alcohol precipitated large hexagonal nanosheets of Cs3Bi2I9. These morphologically 2D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskites exhibit hexagonal crystal structures comprising 0D dimers of (BiX6)3− octahedra in which excitons are confined. Due to the indirect bandgap of the nanosheets, no PL is detected when excited near the bandgap. However, electron-beam excitation results in a broad and asymmetric CL spectrum originating from phonon-assisted recombination of excitons. Ultrafast charge carrier dynamics studied via a femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the generation, thermalization, and cooling of hot charge carriers on a sub-picosecond to tens of picosecond time scale and their relaxation to the ground state on a nanosecond time scale. Such a prolonged time for exciton recombination in indirect bandgap halide perovskites can be viewed in terms of the generation and cooling of hot polarons and their decay via phonon release. This study provides detailed insights into the fundamental aspect of optoelectronic properties and charge-carrier dynamics in lead-free bismuth halide perovskites, where the slow exciton dynamics can be potentially utilized to harvest the charge carriers for catalysis.
