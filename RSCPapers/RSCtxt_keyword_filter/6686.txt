    , Accepted 20th July 2020First published on 21st July 2020AbstractThe advantage of low cost makes P3HT one of the most attractive electron donors for photovoltaic applications, but the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the P3HT-based organic solar cells (OSCs) remains low (7–8%). Herein, to modulate the phase separation morphology so as to enhance the PCE in P3HT-based OSCs, a new NFA, namely ZY-4Cl, is designed and synthesized by modifying the cyano-substituted end groups in BTP-4Cl. The P3HT:ZY-4Cl based OSC exhibits a significantly improved PCE of ∼9.5%, which is a new record for the P3HT-based OSCs. Furthermore, two model compounds, TT-CN and TT-O, are synthesized to simulate the end groups of BTP-4Cl and ZY-4Cl, respectively. The calculated Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, the DSC and the AFM results clearly indicate that the cyano-substituted compound TT-CN shows much stronger miscibility with P3HT compared to TT-O, the one without cyano groups. This molecular design strategy is also verified in the other two representative NFAs. Therefore, this work not only reports an NFA with a high PCE for P3HT-based OSCs, but also suggests guidance for the molecular design of NFAs from the aspect of morphology control.

Broader context
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has always been regarded as a promising material for commercial organic solar cells (OSCs) due to its low cost, scalable production and good stability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P3HT-based OSCs is currently too low to meet the requirement of practice applications, and how to improve it remains a challenge. Here, we designed and synthesized a new non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) ZY-4Cl by tuning the cyano-substituted end groups of the reported NFA BTP-4Cl. Such a modification enables ZY-4Cl with matched energy levels with P3HT and, more importantly, reduces the miscibility between P3HT and ZY-4Cl, which optimizes the phase separation morphology of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl-based active layer. As a result, the corresponding device achieves a record PCE of approaching 10%, which is approximately nine times higher than that of the P3HT:BTP-4Cl-based device (∼1%). Encouragingly, this molecular design strategy is also effective for other NFAs.

Introduction
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to molecular design of organic semiconductors including conjugated polymers and small molecules for organic solar cells (OSCs).1–4 As a result, optoelectronic and morphological properties of the materials could be effectively tuned, leading to successive progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE),5–7 and meanwhile, the chemical structures of the materials has become more and more complicated, which makes their synthetic cost too high to be used in future applications. Therefore, the researchers have shifted their focus to and also made a few significant achievements in molecular design of the new materials that can be synthesized by relatively easy processes.8–10 At present, to realize efficient OSCs by employing low-cost materials has been deemed as a critical and challenging topic in the field.
As the most famous polymer donor material in the OSC field, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) not only has the simplest chemical structure but also can be easily synthesized on a large scale. To the best of our knowledge, P3HT is and also will be the cheapest polymer material for OSCs. As an electron donor, P3HT is extensively blended with fullerene-based acceptors like PCBM and ICBA in OSCs,11,12 but PCE is limited (<7.5%), mainly due to the light absorption capability of the materials.13,14 Light absorption spectra of the P3HT-based OSCs can be significantly broadened by replacing the fullerenes with the narrow-band-gap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) which can yield outstanding PCEs when blended with other conjugated polymers, but these devices usually show low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and thus very low PCEs because of the unfavorable phase separation morphologies in the blends of P3HT and NFAs.15,16 For instance, ITIC is a broadly used NFA and over 10% PCEs have been obtained by blending it with many other polymer donors.17–19 However, the blend of P3HT:ITIC only demonstrated a PCE of 1.25%, because the nanoscale interpenetrating network, which is a prerequisite for efficient charge generation and transport in OSCs, cannot form in the P3HT:ITIC blend.20 The morphological issue can be solved to some extent by modulating the solution deposition conditions of the blend films or by designing new NFAs. For example, by regulating the film formation kinetics so as to optimize the morphology, Han et al. achieved 7.18% for a P3HT:O-IDTBR-based OSC, and we demonstrated a PCE of 4.91% for a P3HT:IEICO-based OSC in our previous work.21,22 Quite a few NFAs, namely O-IDTBR,23 DFPCBR,24 QX3C,25 and so on, were synthesized and applied in P3HT-based OSCs. Very recently, Peng et al. synthesized a new NFA named as TrBTIC and optimized the treatment conditions of the P3HT:TrBTIC film, resulting in a PCE of 8.25%, which was the highest PCE for the P3HT-based OSCs.26 Although the PCE of the P3HT-based OSCs is much lower than the state-of-the-art results obtained by donor–acceptor type polymers,27,28 the critical issue of synthetic cost still encourages the community to advance photovoltaic performance of the P3HT-based OSCs.
In this work, in order to modulate phase separation morphology in the blend of P3HT and an NFA with cyano-substituted indane-1,3-dione end groups, namely BTP-4Cl,29 we designed and synthesized a new small molecular NFA, 2,2′-((12,13-bis(2-butyldecyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]-thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methane-lylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione) (ZY-4Cl). Our results demonstrate that the miscibility between P3HT and BTP-4Cl is too strong to get appropriate phase separation, leading to a very low PCE of ∼1%. After removing the cyano groups, the miscibility between P3HT and the new NFA reduces significantly, and as a result, nanoscale phase separation, which is favorable for exciton separation and charge transport, forms in the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend and the corresponding OSC shows a PCE of ∼9.5%, which is the highest value for P3HT-based OSCs (Fig. 1).

Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the materials used in this work are shown in Fig. 2a. To understand how the end groups affect the miscibility between P3HT and the NFAs, we calculated the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) of P3HT and NFAs according to a group additive method reported previously.30 The values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Then we employed the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (χ) to describe the amorphous-amorphous molecular interactions between P3HT and the NFAs, which can be obtained with HSPs. The detailed calculation method is provided in the ESI,† and the calculated χ parameters are summarized in Table 1. The χ values are 2.52 and 2.56 for the P3HT:BTP-4Cl and P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends, respectively. According to previous studies,31 the higher χ implies stronger phase separation in the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend. To verify the conclusion drawn from the calculated χ parameters, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed to quantify the miscibility of the blends. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the melting and crystallizing temperatures (Tm and Tc) of P3HT are about 227 and 175 °C, respectively, which are coincident with the reported studies.32 No endothermic or exothermic signals can be observed for BTP-4Cl and ZY-4Cl. The Tm and Tc signals of P3HT disappear in the P3HT:BTP-4Cl blend, whereas the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend shows very weak endo/exothermic signals, which could be ascribed to Tm and Tc of P3HT. Therefore, we reasonably speculate that for these two NFAs, ZY-4Cl has lower miscibility with P3HT, which is consistent with the theoretically calculated χ, so the semi-crystalline structure of P3HT forms in the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend.

As we realized that the endo/exothermic signals obtained from the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend are too weak to be convincing evidence, we synthesized two small molecular model compounds, TT-O and TT-CN (Fig. 2a), which are designed to imitate the end groups of BTP-4Cl and ZY-4Cl, respectively. The detailed information for the synthesis of TT-O and TT-CN are described in the ESI.† Similarly, as shown in Table 1, the χ parameters of P3HT:TT-O are higher than that of P3HT:TT-CN, implying the relatively lower miscibility in the former blend. As displayed in Fig. 2b for DSC measurements, the two compounds show relatively strong crystallinity, and Tm and Tc are 201/164 °C for TT-CN, and 223/176 °C for TT-O, respectively. In the blend with less TT-CN, i.e.P3HT:TT-CN = 1:0.6 (wt/wt), only a tiny endothermic peak of TT-CN can be observed. With increasing TT-CN, the endothermic signal becomes more prominent and also the exothermic signal of TT-CN appears, suggesting that TT-CN is saturated and separated from the P3HT phase. Meanwhile, for the P3HT:TT-O blend with a 1:0.6 ratio, the endo- and exothermic signals of TT-O still can be clearly detected, meaning that TT-O has obviously lower miscibility with P3HT than TT-CN.
The difference in phase separation behaviors of these two blends can also be illustrated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the surface of the P3HT film is very smooth and uniform, while TT-CN and TT-O tend to form large crystal-like aggregations. As shown in Fig. 2c, for the blend films with a weight ratio of 1:0.6, the P3HT:TT-CN film shows a homogeneous surface with root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 1.31 nm, while for the P3HT:TT-O film, the surface is rougher (Rq = 1.67 nm) and also crystal-like aggregations can be clearly observed. While the weight ratio changes to 1:1, the rod-like aggregations can be observed in both blends. Therefore, the observations from AFM measurements agree well with the DSC results and confirm that from BTP-4Cl to ZY-4Cl, the miscibility between P3HT and the NFA can be obviously reduced by removing the cyano groups.
We measured the electrochemical properties of the acceptors by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as depicted in Fig. 3a. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels for BTP-4Cl and ZY-4Cl are −5.72/−4.03 eV and −5.64/−3.67 eV, respectively. The upshift of energy levels of ZY-4Cl is ascribed to the weakened electron-withdrawing effect of its end groups, which is conducive to achieving higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) in OSCs. In addition, as the up-shift in the LUMO is larger than that in the HOMO, ZY-4Cl should have a wider bandgap, which is confirmed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption measurements, i.e. the absorption spectrum of ZY-4Cl blue-shifts for approximately 100 nm relative to BTP-4Cl as shown in Fig. 3b. And the calculated absorption coefficient of ZY-4Cl (1.74 × 105 cm−1) is slightly higher than that of BTP-4Cl (1.42 × 105 cm−1).

The photovoltaic properties of P3HT:BTP-4Cl and P3HT:ZY-4Cl were investigated by fabricating the OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. The detailed device fabrication process is provided in the ESI,† and the photovoltaic results of the device optimization process for P3HT:ZY-4Cl are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 3c plots the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized OSCs, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The P3HT:BTP-4Cl-based OSC exhibits a very low PCE of 1.01%, with a VOC of 0.50 V, a JSC of 5.16 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.39. While for the P3HT:ZY-4Cl-based device, a high PCE of 9.46% can be achieved, with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 16.49 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.65. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these two devices are presented in Fig. 3d. Compared with the P3HT:BTP-4Cl device, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl device has a narrower response range due to the blue-shifted absorption of ZY-4Cl but exhibits much higher EQE, with a peak value exceeding 65%, which is responsible for the higher JSC.

Then, the surface morphologies of the P3HT:BTP-4Cl and P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend films were investigated by AFM. As presented in Fig. 4, the P3HT:BTP-4Cl film has a homogeneous surface with Rq of 1.15 nm. For the P3HT:ZY-4Cl film, distinct nanoscale phase separation can be observed with Rq of 2.89 nm. The AFM results are consistent with the aforementioned inference. Meanwhile, we also carried out grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements to investigate the crystalline properties of these films. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), P3HT exhibits an edge-on orientation with a pronounced (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak in the in-plane (IP) direction and (100), (200) and (300) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. Meanwhile, both BTP-4Cl and ZY-4Cl neat films tend to form a predominantly face-on orientation. GIWAXS patterns of the blend films are displayed in Fig. 4c and f, and the corresponding 1D profiles are plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). There are no obvious diffraction peaks in any direction for the P3HT:BTP-4Cl film, indicating the highly intermixed P3HT and BTP-4Cl phases and amorphous morphology of the film, just like its surface shown by AFM. In contrast, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl film presents both edge-on and face-on orientation, which respectively belong to P3HT and ZY-4Cl in this film, implying that P3HT and ZY-4Cl can form two separate phases in their blends. In comparison with P3HT:BTP-4Cl, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl film possesses more favorable nanoscale phase separation morphology, which is beneficial for forming efficient channels for charge transport. The electron and hole mobilities (μe and μh) of the two blend films were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method to investigate the charge transport. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the calculated μe/μh of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl film are 3.60 × 10−5/7.08 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are one order of magnitude higher than those of the P3HT:BTP-4Cl film (3.93 × 10−6/8.67 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results suggest that charge transport in the P3HT:ZY-4Cl device is more efficient, which contributes to the higher JSC and FF.

We studied the exciton dissociation and charge collection process in the two OSCs by measuring the dependence of photocurrent (Jph, defined as the difference between light and dark current density) on effective voltage (Veff, defined as V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage).33 As depicted in Fig. 5c, the calculated exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss, defined as Jph/Jsat, where Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density at a sufficiently high Veff) for the P3HT:BTP-4Cl and P3HT:ZY-4Cl OSCs are 34% and 81%, respectively. It should be noted that the current density of the P3HT:BTP-4Cl OSC is not well saturated so the low Pdiss of 34% is still an overestimated value and the real Pdiss in this device is even lower. Meanwhile, the charge recombination behavior was investigated by establishing the correlation between JSC and light intensity (Plight) following the power-law equation of JSC ∝ PSlight, where S approaching 1 means the bimolecular recombination is negligible.34 As displayed in Fig. 5d, the S values of the P3HT:BTP-4Cl and P3HT:ZY-4Cl OSCs are 0.75 and 0.84, respectively, indicating the less bimolecular recombination in the latter one. The higher Pdiss and less bimolecular recombination imply that the P3HT:ZY-4Cl device exhibits more efficient charge generation and transport, which partially accounts for its significantly improved PCE.
Furthermore, to verify the molecular design strategy in this work, we also modified the end groups of the other two representative acceptors, ITIC and IT-4Cl, in the same way, and obtained IO-4H and IO-4Cl, respectively. We fabricated the P3HT-based OSCs with these four acceptors to check their photovoltaic performance, and the J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are collected in Fig. S5 and Table S3 (ESI†), respectively. It can be seen that the PCEs of the P3HT:ITIC and P3HT:IT-4Cl OSCs are only 0.20% and 0.06%, respectively, whereas the P3HT:IO-4H and P3HT:IO-4Cl OSCs show significantly improved PCEs of 4.04% and 4.70%, respectively. All three parameters are dramatically enhanced, which is the same as the BTP-4Cl/ZY-4Cl case. The χ results derived from thermodynamic calculations also deliver similar correlations (Fig. S6, ESI†). These results demonstrate that lowering the miscibility via removing the cyano groups in the NFAs is a feasible and universal method for improving the PCE of the P3HT-based OSCs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we introduced an effective method to enhance the phase separation effect between P3HT and the NFA so as to improve the photovoltaic performance of P3HT-based OSCs. By removing the cyano groups of BTP-4Cl, we designed and synthesized a new NFA, ZY-4Cl. Compared with BTP-4Cl, ZY-4Cl possesses up-shifted LUMO level and broader bandgap, which is beneficial for realizing higher VOC but sacrifices some of the light absorption capability. More importantly, due to the reduced miscibility between the NFA and P3HT, the blend film based on P3HT:ZY-4Cl exhibits enhanced phase separation, which contributes to the efficient charge transport and reduced charge recombination in the corresponding OSC. As a result, the photovoltaic performance of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl based OSC is significantly improved, achieving a high PCE of 9.46%, which is a new record for P3HT-based OSCs. What is more, we also verified the feasibility of this molecular design strategy in the other two well-known NFAs, so this work not only reports a new NFA incorporating with a high-efficiency P3HT-based OSC, but also provides guidance for the molecular design of NFAs.

Broader context
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has always been regarded as a promising material for commercial organic solar cells (OSCs) due to its low cost, scalable production and good stability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P3HT-based OSCs is currently too low to meet the requirement of practice applications, and how to improve it remains a challenge. Here, we designed and synthesized a new non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) ZY-4Cl by tuning the cyano-substituted end groups of the reported NFA BTP-4Cl. Such a modification enables ZY-4Cl with matched energy levels with P3HT and, more importantly, reduces the miscibility between P3HT and ZY-4Cl, which optimizes the phase separation morphology of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl-based active layer. As a result, the corresponding device achieves a record PCE of approaching 10%, which is approximately nine times higher than that of the P3HT:BTP-4Cl-based device (∼1%). Encouragingly, this molecular design strategy is also effective for other NFAs.
