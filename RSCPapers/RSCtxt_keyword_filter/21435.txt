    AbstractElectrospinning, a low cost production method for large area nanofibrous films, is employed to fabricate organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) and TiO2 nanofibers. The performance of the hybrid solar cells is optimized by modifying the surface of TiO2 nanofibers with ruthenium dye (N719) and 3-phenylpropionic acid, which results in the average power conversion efficiency of about 1.1% under AM 1.5G simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2). It is found that the co-modification of N719 and 3-phenylpropionic acid on TiO2 can induce more ordered backbone packing of poly(3-hexylthiophene) layer, lower density of trap states on the surface of TiO2 and longer lifetime of carriers in the active layer due to retarded recombination process by the modifier. Therefore the interface modification can dramatically enhance the photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
Organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells contain a blend of electron donor and acceptor materials with three dimensional interpenetrating networks, which could boost the performance of photovoltaics due to the enormously increased interfacial area.1 A state-of-art BHJ solar cell involves poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as donor and acceptor, respectively, showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 5%.2 Although all organic photovoltaic devices employing fullerenes as acceptors could offer high efficiency, growing attention has been paid to n-type inorganic semiconductors, such as CdSe,3,4 ZnO,5–8 TiO2,9–14 for their potential advantages over the organic counterparts, including higher dielectric constant, higher electron mobility and affinity as well as better physical and chemical stability.
TiO2 has attracted great research interest since it has already been successfully used in dye sensitized solar cells.15 It has been found that ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer could occur at the TiO2-conjugated polymer interface.16,17 Typically, two common approaches have been used to fabricate TiO2-polymer solar cells. One is to infiltrate conjugated polymer into nanostructured TiO2 film.9,10 The other is the simultaneous deposition of the blend of polymer and TiO2 nanocrystals.11,12 In the case of the porous TiO2-polymer system, the current PCE is still low, although many efforts have been made towards the optimization of the structure of titania network and the architecture of the device.10,18,19 Actually, the fabrication of nanostructured TiO2 film with controlled pore size and pore distribution together with the complete infiltration of polymer into this network has still been a challenge until now.
For the blend of polymer and TiO2 nanocrystals, one problem for their hybrid solar cells is the poor electric contact among the TiO2 particles and the cathode electrode. Therefore, well aligned one dimensional (1D) TiO2 arrays that enable a large interfacial area and continuous carrier pathway could be the ideal structure for the hybrid solar cell. However, the growth of TiO2 nanowires with precise control of density and size, and high aspect ratio remains a significant technological challenge.13,14
Electronspinning has been developed to be a simple and versatile method to prepare various of continuous 1D fibers, including polymers, ceramics, composites and metals, with diameters down to several nanometres.20,21 After the first demonstration of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers,22 many efforts have been done toward their application in photovoltaic devices since the electrospun nanofibers can be fabricated with controllable size, density and orientation. More importantly, electrospinning is a low cost production method for large area nanofibrous film. Since area and cost are two important issues for solar cells, electrospinning is an idea technique for the fabrication of hybrid solar cells. However, the reported organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells based on electrospun TiO2 nanofibers show relatively low PCE (< 0.5%).23,24 Therefore, the fabrication of such a device needs to be tackled.
Apart from the creation of organic-inorganic bulk heterojunction with desired morphology, the surface modification of TiO2 nanocrystals by anchoring a monolayer on the surface may induce a significant improvement of the performance of the hybrid solar due to the change of the interfacial energetics as well as the charge transfer and recombination processes.25–27 Promising results have been achieved in photovoltaic devices based on the blend of titania nanocrystals and P3HT with effective interface modifications.12,28
In this paper, we study the hybrid solar cells based on electrospun TiO2 nanofibers and regioregular P3HT. (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2] (N719) is used to modify the TiO2-P3HT interface and 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA) is first used as a co-modifier in this system and significant improvement of photovoltaic performance is achieved. The effect of the interface modification on the performance of the solar cell is investigated.
2. Experimental
Device fabrication

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic structure of the hybrid solar cell. Cleaned ITO glass is first coated with a 40 nm compact TiO2 layer by spin-coating the sol–gel solution (0.25M titanium n-butoxide in ethanol) at 6000 rpm. Then TiO2 nanofibrous film is prepared on top of the compact layer via electrospinning process as reported before.29 The substrate is adhered on a rotator for a better alignment of TiO2 nanofibers. Three layers of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers are collected with a crossed architecture to form a TiO2 nanofibrous film. Then it is sintered at 500 °C for 10 min by rapid thermal processing to remove organic components and allow nucleation and growth of TiO2 grains. The thickness of the sintered TiO2 nanofibrous film is about 200 nm, which is the optimum thickness for the hybrid solar cells.8

Some of the sintered TiO2 nanofibrous films are modified with N719 dye and PPA. The samples are immersed in 0.5 mM N719 solution (with or without the same concentration of PPA) in ethanol and kept at 60 °C for 12 h. Then the TiO2 films are rinsed for several times by ethanol to remove the physisorbed dye.
A layer of P3HT is infiltrated in each TiO2 nanofibrous film by spin-coating P3HT solution (Reike, regioregularity is ∼93%, 30 mg mL−1 in toluene) at 1500 rpm for 30 s and subsequent thermal annealing at 100 °C for 20 min in a glove box filled with high purity nitrogen. Then an 80 nm thick gold electrode is evaporated on top of the film through a shadow mask by using a thermal evaporator. Finally the devices are post-annealed at 80 °C for 15 min before test.
Material characterization
Raman spectroscopy of N719 modified and N719-PPA co-modified TiO2 nanofibrous films are characterized by using HORIBA JOBZN YVON HR 800 Raman spectrometer with an exited wavelength of 488 nm generated by Ar ion laser.
UV-Vis absorption spectra are characterized by using a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The samples for the measurement are prepared by coating a thin layer of P3HT film on each planar TiO2 film with different surface modification.
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) of TiO2 films with different surface modification is characterized with CHI660b electrochemical workstation. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide is synthesized and used as the electrolyte for the CV measurements.30 A TiO2 film is used as the working electrode, a platinum disk and a platinum wire are used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. Ferrocene is used as an internal standard.31
The microstructures of TiO2 nanofibrous films are characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM 2010, Japan), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM 6335F, USA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Device characterization
The cell performance is measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport 91160, 300W, solar simulator equipped with an AM1.5G filter). The light intensity is calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the solar cells is recorded by an impedance analyzer (HP 4294) in a frequency range from 40 Hz to 20 MHz with an oscillating voltage of 50 mV in dark.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic structure of the hybrid solar cell. The multilayered device is deposited on an ITO glass composed of a compact TiO2 layer (40 nm), an cross-aligned electrospun TiO2 nanofibrous film, a spin coated P3HT layer and an Au electrode (thickness is about 80 nm) deposited by thermal evaporation. The compact TiO2 layer is used to enhance the adhesion of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers on the ITO substrate and to serve as a hole-blocking layer. It is worth noting that the electrospun TiO2 nanofibrous film can be easily deposited on a substrate with an area of several square centimetres and a uniform thickness.

Fig. 1b and c shows the SEM image of a TiO2 nanofibrous film fabricated by electrospinning process. The diameters of the TiO2 fibers are between 20 nm and 100 nm. Fig. 1d shows the TEM picture of a single fiber indicating that it is a polycrystalline nanofiber with an average grain size of 10 nm. The diffraction pattern shows that the TiO2 grains are anatase. Fig. 1e shows the AFM image of the TiO2 nanofiber/P3HT composite film without top electrode. The TiO2 network can still be observed after coating a layer of P3HT film indicating the infiltration of P3HT into the pores. Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectrum of the electrospun TiO2 nanofibers, which also confirms the anatase phase of the TiO2 nanofibers.

To improve the efficiency of the hybrid solar cell, the TiO2 nanofibers are modified with some organic molecules: N719 and PPA. It has been reported that the surface modification of ruthenium dye on TiO2 can greatly enhance the efficiency of TiO2/P3HT hybrid solar cells.12,27 It is worth noting that ruthenium dye modification could not lead to a full coverage of TiO2 surface because of steric effect resulted from the large size of dye molecules,32 which will be proved later in this paper. The uncovered area of TiO2 can trap the injected electrons because of the unsaturated Ti4+ atoms at the surface.33,34 Therefore another experiment is to adsorb small molecules PPA together with dye molecules on the electrospun TiO2 nanofibers to get a better coverage on the surface, which is expected to result in a further improvement of cell performance.

Fig. 3a shows a schematic diagram of the surface modification with N719 and PPA. We employ Raman spectroscopy to examine the anchoring of modifiers on TiO2 surface. Fig. 4a shows the Raman spectrum of pure N719 and PPA powder. For N719, the three strong peaks at 1400–1600 cm−1 are assigned to the bipyridine stretching modes, bipridine breathing appears around 1000 cm−1, C–C ring and C–O stretching are recorded in 1200–1400 cm−1 region.35,36 PPA exhibits a dominant peak at 1005 cm−1 due to the in-plane bending of the aromatic ring, the other weaker peaks can be assigned to different vibrational modes of C–C or C–H bonds.37 The fingerprints of N719 vibration bands can still be observed after being absorbed on the surface of TiO2, but the position of the peaks are slightly shifted and the relative intensity of C–C ring and C–O stretching are apparently changed after the absorption. In addition, a new broad band around 1370 cm−1 is observed, which is assigned to the symmetric vibration mode of the carboxyl group (νsym(COO−)), indicating the anchoring of N719 molecules on TiO2 through bidentate and/or bridging.35 However, the vibration modes of PPA cannot be resolved when it is co-grafted on TiO2 with N719 because of the overlap of their Raman spectrum. But a stronger νsym(COO–) mode around 1370 cm−1 can be observed in the Raman spectrum in Fig. 4b, which can be attributed to the co-adsorption of PPA and N719 that introduce more carboxyl groups on the surface of TiO2. Based on these results we can confirm the chemisorbed N719 and the co-grafted PPA on TiO2 surfaces.

Fig. 5 shows the I–V characteristics of the hybrid solar cells based on P3HT and electrospun TiO2 nanofibers with different interface modifications. The surface modification of N719 on TiO2 nanofibers can induce obvious improvement of Voc, FF, ISC and PCE of the hybrid devices. The co-modification of N719 and PPA can further improve all of the above parameters. The PCE is almost doubled compared with that of the control sample with no interface modification. For each condition, at least 6 devices are fabricated and very similar results are obtained. The detailed parameters are also summarized in Table 1.

The effect of the modification of N719 on the performance of the hybrid solar cells can be attributed to the cascaded energy levels as show in Fig. 3b. The positions of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels for both organic dye and P3HT polymer are favorable for electron injection toward TiO2 and hole transport towards the gold electrode.26,38 The interfacial dye molecules also prohibit the recombination of electrons and holes at the interface due to the spacial separation of the two types of carriers.37 In addition, the better electronic coupling between the adsorbed dye and TiO2 due to chemical bonding could also improve the electron collection efficiency.27
More importantly, we find that the surface modification can improve the crystallinity of the coated P3HT layer. Fig. 6 presents the absorption spectrum of thin P3HT layer on different substrates. Typically, P3HT shows three absorption peaks in the visible region, the one at about 560 nm is associated with intrachain π to π* transition.39 The peak at about 524 nm is related to the intrachain π to π* transition by coupling one phonon mode.39 The absorption shoulder at around 603 nm is related to the interchain interaction and thus the height of this shoulder indicates the ordering of the chain packing.39,40 We find that the P3HT film shows a higher shoulder at 603 nm and thus a better crystallinity on a TiO2 film than on a glass substrate. The surface modification of N719 and PPA on TiO2 film cannot improve the height of the absorption shoulder at 603 nm. However, an obvious red shift of the absorption peak at about 560 nm can be observed after each interface modification, which is enlarged in the inset of Fig. 6. The biggest red shift is obtained in the sample with N719 and PPA co-modification. The red shift means longer conjugation length and more ordered packing of P3HT backbones which may be due to the interaction between the π-conjugated structure in the interfacial molecules and thiophene rings of P3HT chains.12 Therefore the co-modification of N719 and PPA on TiO2 can induce the best packing ordering of P3HT layer and thus the longest average diffusion length of excitons in the hybrid solar cells.27

Another purpose of doing the interface modification is to decrease the density of trap states at the TiO2/P3HT interface, which are mainly caused by the unsaturated Ti4+ species on the surface of TiO2. Higher density of trap states at the interface may induce higher recombination rate of carriers and lower Voc.41,42 To study the effect of the surface modification with N719 and PPA, cyclic voltammetry of the film is characterized, which could provide useful information about the surface density of states (DOS) of nanostructured metal oxide thin film when it is voltage-scanned close to equilibrium condition. Normally, the DOS of TiO2 surface traps (g(E)) shows an exponentioal distribution with energy given by eqn (1).43,44 (1)where Nt is the total density of trap states, KB is the Boltzmann constant and T0 is the characteristic temperature of the exponential DOS. The cathodic current j of the CV curve can be described by the chemical capacitance Cμ that is propotional to the DOS of surface traps g(E).43,44 (2) (3)where, f is the Fermi Dirac distribution function, s the scanning rate of the applied voltage and q elementary charge. Therefore the cathodic current j is proportional to the density of surface traps when it is characterized at the same scanning rate.
As displayed in Fig. 7, all of the three electrodes exhibit similar curves: the cathodic current follows an exponential increase during the negative scan; for reverse scan, clear anodic peaks could be observed in all cases. Here, we need to compare the CV curves for negative scan. A clear decrease of cathodic current can be observed in the modified TiO2 films. The N719 and PPA co-modified one shows the smallest cathodic current. These results indicate that surface modification of the TiO2 film can reduce the density of surface trap states and the co-modification of N719 and PPA shows a better coverage on TiO2 surface than the solo-modification of N719.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used for further understanding of the role of the interface modification on the devices performance. Fig. 8a presents the Nyquist plots of the three devices characterized under 0.65 V forward bias in dark. Typically, the Nyquist plot consists of three parts in different frequency region. From left to right, the small component at high frequency which is not well resolved is due to the charge transfer process at the interface of an electrode, then the Warburg impedance like straight line is assigned to the diffusion-recombination of non-absorbing contacts, finally the large semicircle is related to the recombination processes at the TiO2/P3HT interface.45,46 The carrier lifetime can be calculated from the peak frequency of the semicircle as described by diffusion and recombination model.47,48Fig. 8b shows the calculated carriers lifetime of the three devices under different bias. Prolonged carrier lifetime is found after interface modification and the N719 and PPA co-modified device shows the longest carrier lifetime. The enhanced carrier lifetime can be attributed to the retarded recombination kinetics due to the surface modification on TiO2. The surface modifier can not only reduce the recombination centers on the surface but also block the back electron transfer from TiO2 to P3HT. As stressed before, co-grafting of PPA with N719 leads to a more compact monolayer on the surface of TiO2, and thus more efficient passivation of recombination process and longer carrier lifetime. Therefore the hybrid solar cell co-modified with N719 and PPA exhibits the highest Voc and Isc due to the lowest recombination rate at the interface.

The solid lines are the fitting results according to the equivalent circuit shown in the inset. (b) Calculated lifetime of carriers in the three devices under different bias. 
Although our optimized solar cell shows higher PCE than many hybrid solar cells based on nanostructured TiO2 film,9–11,13,23,24 the efficiency is still lower than that of the whole organic solar cell based on P3HT/PCBM.2 Since the average size of the PCBM nanocrystallites in a whole organic solar is normally several nanometres,2 which is much smaller than the size of TiO2 nanofibers, the interface area of the heterojunction in the whole organic solar cell is much bigger than that in the hybrid solar cells. Therefore a strategy to further improve the efficiency of the device is to decrease the diameter of the TiO2 nanofibers, which is expected to be realized by optimizing the electrospinning conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, electrospinning is a low cost production method for large area nanofibrous film and thus an ideal technique for the fabrication of hybrid solar cells. Solar cells based on P3HT and electrospun TiO2 nanofibers are fabricated. N719 is used to modify the TiO2/P3HT interface and PPA is employed as a co-absorbent. We find a more ordered interfacial P3HT layer after interface modification due to the interaction between the π-conjugated structure of modifiers and thiophene rings of P3HT. Cyclic voltammetry study reveals that interface modification can reduce the density of trap states on the surface of TiO2. Prolonged carriers lifetime is characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which is attributed to the retarded recombination process after the modification. Improved photovoltaic performance is achieved after the interface modification, and the highest conversion efficiency (1.1%) is obtained from the N719-PPA co-modified device. The improvement of the ordering of interfacial P3HT layer, reduced density of trap states and retarded interfacial recombination process can all contribute to the enhanced photovoltaic performance.
