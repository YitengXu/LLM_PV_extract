    AbstractControlling the morphology in bulk-heterojunction solar cells is the preferred and most effective way to achieve high efficiency. To control the morphology, we synthesized a novel hydrophobic end-functionalized P3HT to induce hydrophilic–hydrophobic repulsive interactions in the boundary between the relatively hydrophilic PCBM and the relatively hydrophobic P3HT. The introduction of hydrophobic end-functionalized P3HT (F-P3HT) leads to larger PCBM clusters, while maintaining the crystallinity of P3HT due to repulsive interactions. F-P3HT thus provides a maximized continuous interfacial area between the donor and the acceptor as well as bi-continuous networks of donor and acceptor domains, resulting in better percolation pathways for charge transport.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells based on a composite film using an electron-donor polymer and an electron-acceptor fabricated by solution processes have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost and ease of fabrication, as well as their versatile application in low-weight, flexible, and large-area devices based on cost-effective roll-to-roll processing technologies.1,2 Recently, several research groups have used regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron acceptor to increase the power-conversion efficiency of BHJ solar cells to almost 5%.3 A high-performance P3HT:PCBM composite BHJ solar cell was achieved by developing the morphology of the BHJ film. Annealing, either thermal or solvent annealing, is one of the best ways to achieve a well-defined morphology.4 Annealing treatment increases the crystallinity of P3HT and simultaneously provides bi-continuous networks of donor- and acceptor-rich domains. As a result, charge transport is enhanced and charge collection at each electrode is improved.
Another approach to the development of film morphology is the introduction of an additive into a donor–acceptor blending solution.5,6 Addition of alkanedithiols to the blending solution can improve the performance of BHJ solar cells because the added alkanedithiols reduce the solubility of PCBM, which induces the formation of PCBM clusters and a precipitate. The PCBM clusters enhance P3HT chain ordering, and concurrently form a percolation pathway for carriers of both positive and negative charges. Furthermore, because alkanedithiols have higher boiling points than commonly used solvents, such as chlorobenzene or ortho-dichlorobenzene, alkanedithiols remain in the BHJ film after spin coating, and thus provide a more efficient rearrangement of BHJ morphology. Moreover, this method also affects amorphous low-band gap donor polymer systems.5 Wang and Chang demonstrated that introduction of 3-hexylthiophene into a P3HT:PCBM solution improved the device performance.7 However, this approach is limited to the P3HT:PCBM system. More recently, Loo and co-workers achieved phase separation between donor and acceptor by the incorporation of non-volatile additives. Moreover, the degree of phase separation was determined by the hydrophobicity of the non-volatile additives.8 The formation of donor–acceptor morphology using self-organization of donor–acceptor di-block copolymers has also been reported.9 Recently, Wudl and co-workers reported a P3HT donor and a C60 acceptor system that contained rod–coil di-block copolymers as surfactants to control the morphology at the interface between PH3T and PCBM.10 These investigators showed that use of di-block copolymers changed the bulk-heterojunction morphology and improved solar cell device performance.
In the present study, we report a simple and effective approach to improve morphology using nano-scale phase separation in P3HT:PCBM blend films, while preserving the crystallinity of P3HT within the blend films. To control the phase separation, we incorporated a hydrophobic end-functional P3HT (F-P3HT) into the P3HT:PCBM blending film, in which the hydrophobic end-groups induced hydrophilic–hydrophobic repulsive interactions at the boundary between the relatively hydrophilic PCBM and the relatively hydrophobic P3HT. These repulsive interactions lead to the larger size PCBM cluster maintaining crystallinity of P3HT, and thus provide a maximized continuous interfacial area between donor and acceptor as well as bi-continuous networks of donor and acceptor domains, which form better percolation pathways for charge transport. The present study suggests firstly that BHJ morphology might be enhanced by incorporation of hydrophobic end-groups into the low-band gap polymers with poor BHJ morphology.
Experimental
Materials

P3HT was purchased from Rieke Metal Inc. (4002-E grade). All other starting materials were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and were used without further purification. THF was dried over calcium hydride.
Synthesis
2,5-Dibromo-3-hexylthiophene,11 4-[(trifluorovinyl)oxy]bromobenzene (TFVE)12 and 4-[(trifluorovinyl)oxy]-benzene-1-magnesium bromide11 were prepared according to procedures in the literature.
TFVE-end-functionalized poly(3-hexylthiophene) (F-P3HT)
2,5-Dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (2.28 g, 7 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (15 mL) under nitrogen. A 2 M solution of tert-butyl magnesium chloride in diethyl ether (3.5 mL, 7 mmol) was added via a syringe and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was then diluted to 70 mL with THF, and Ni(dppp)Cl2 (92.2 mg, 0.17 mmol) was added in one portion. The mixture was stirred for 15 min at room temperature, and Grignard reagent (2.1 mmol, 30 mol% of monomer) was added via a syringe to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and then poured into 200 mL of methanol to precipitate the polymer. The polymer was filtered and extracted with methanol, hexane, and chloroform using a Soxhlet extractor. The polymer was isolated from the chloroform solution. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 7.44 (d, 2H, J = 5.50 Hz), 7.16 (d, 2H, J = 5.50 Hz), 6.97 (s, 1H), 2.79 (t, 2H, J = 13.51 Hz), 1.70 (m, 2H), 1.43–1.33 (m, 6H), 0.90 (t, 3H, J = 15.34 Hz). 19F NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ −135.12 to −134.84 (1F, dd, CFCF2, Fc), −127.74 to −126.85 (1F, dd, trans-CFCF2, Fb), −120.83 to −120.40 (1F, dd, cis-CFCF2, Fa). GPC: Mw 7300, PDI (1.1).
Characterization
Materials were characterized by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy (JEOL JNM-LA300WB 400 MHz). The molecular weight of the polymer was confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Futecs, NS2001). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on an Autoprobe CP, PSI. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature on a Rigaku RINT 2000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. TEM measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI) in Daejeon. Samples were prepared for the TEM imaging measurements as follows. The freestanding P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM active layers of the complete devices were floated on a water surface and transferred to a Cu grid. The samples were subsequently dried at a low temperature and kept under vacuum overnight to prevent any unwanted morphological changes of thermal annealing. The images and SAED patterns were obtained using a field-emission TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F) operated at 200 kV under slight defocusing conditions.
BHJ solar cell fabrication and characterization
The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate was cleaned using a conventional method. After cleaning, the substrate was subjected to UV-O3 treatment for 30 min before deposition of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VPAI4083). The PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated (5000 rpm, 1 min) onto the ITO-coated glass, which was then baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air before being transferred to an N2-filled glove box for further fabrication steps. The thickness, which was measured with a surface profiler (Kosaka ET-3000i), was nearly 25 nm. The P3HT:PCBM (Nano-C) and P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM blend films were used for the active layers of the solar cells.
The donor-to-acceptor weight ratio in the blend solution was fixed at 1:1. P3HT and PCBM (50 mg each) or F-P3HT and PCBM (50 mg each) were dissolved in 1 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and stirred at 60 °C overnight in an N2-filled glove box, and then mixed solutions were blended with weight ratios of 98:2:100, 90:10:100, and 70:30:100 (P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM), respectively. The active layers of each device were formed by spin-coating (700 rpm, 1 min), with the blend solutions passing through a 0.2 µm PTFE filter before arriving at the PEDOT:PSS layer. After spin coating, solvent annealing was carried out at room temperature for 2 h in the jar. Top-electrodes, made of Ca (25 nm)/Al (100 nm), were deposited on the active layers by a thermal evaporation method under a high vacuum (<3 × 10−6 Torr) with a shadow mask, and this area (4.66 mm2) was defined as the photoactive area of the corresponding devices. J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 4200 source measurement unit. The solar cell devices were illuminated at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using a 1 kW Oriel solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter in an N2-filled glove box. For accurate measurements, light intensity was calibrated using a radiant power meter and two reference silicon solar cells certified by the NREL.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Scheme S1 (ESI†) shows the synthesis of regio-regular-P3HT end-functionalized with hydrophobic TFVE to yield F-P3HT. First, regioregular P3HT was synthesized using a Grignard metathesis (McCullough) method. Then, the reactive nickel-terminated polymer was end-terminated in situ by the Grignard reagent.13 This method is commonly used to synthesize end-functionalized regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene)s. 1H NMR and 19F NMR confirmed the successful introduction of fluorine end-groups. The molecular weight of the F-P3HT was estimated by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in a THF solution relative to polystyrene standards. The number-average molecular weight (Mw) was 7300 with a polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 1.1.
Device fabrication and characterization

Fig. 1 shows the structure of the BHJ polymer solar cell along with the chemical structures of its components. The bulky TFVE, which forms from three fluorine units, was hydrophobic by nature and likely interrupted the crystalline phase of P3HT because of its bulkiness. On the other hand, PCBM is relatively hydrophilic compared with typical conjugated polymers.14 Linear end-chain functionalization might enhance the crystallinity of P3HT in the P3HT:PCBM blend film,15 which would improve the performance of the solar cell. To observe only the morphology changes that resulted from the hydrophilic–hydrophobic repulsive interactions, we chose the bulky TFVE end-functional unit. When the hydrophilic PCBM was blended with the hydrophobic F-P3HT phase separation occurred due to the repulsion. Phase separation might induce changes in film morphology that, in turn, alter device performance.

To characterize the performance of solar cells that contained F-P3HT and PCBM blend films, we first tried to fabricate a F-P3HT:PCBM-based BHJ solar cell. Surprisingly, however, the F-P3HT:PCBM (1:1) layer could not be spin-coated onto the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS film. One explanation for this result is the repulsion between the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS and the hydrophobic F-P3HT. The BHJ solar cells that used blends of P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM were fabricated on a PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrate. The active layer was spin-coated using a blend of the donor (P3HT:F-P3HT) and the acceptor (PCBM) (1:1 wt ratio) in ortho-dichlorobenzene with a thickness of 250–300 nm. The current density–voltage characteristics of the following devices are shown in Fig. 2: P3HT:PCBM (100:100), which served as a reference cell; P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM (98:2:100); P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM (90:10:100); and P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM (70:30:100). The power-conversion efficiency (PCE), fill factor (FF), short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and series resistance (Rs) are given in Table 1. All devices showed similar Voc (0.6 V), which is determined from the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor.16

By contrast, when F-P3HT was blended with 2 wt%, Jsc was higher than that of the reference device. However, when more F-P3HT was added, Jsc decreased. This result was probably due to the low molecular weight of F-P3HT.17 On the other hand, the FF was increased as a result of blending with hydrophobic F-P3HT. This result indicates that the bulk-heterojunction morphology of the blend film was improved by addition of F-P3HT.
In addition, the device fabricated with the F-P3HT blend showed lower series resistance (Rs) and a higher rectification ratio (Fig. 3), which are indicative of better charge transport and collection after blending with F-P3HT. This result also means that the morphology of the blend film was optimized by the introduction of F-P3HT into P3HT:PCBM.

Morphology characterization
X-Ray analysis was used to investigate the morphological changes that resulted from addition of F-P3HT, as X-ray measurements provide information on the degree of ordering. The films used for the X-ray measurements were prepared using the same conditions as those used in device fabrication. Fig. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the active layers composed of P3HT:PCBM (100:100), P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM (98:2:100), and P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM (70:30:100). Surprisingly, despite mixing with F-P3HT, all films showed identical diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.30° [100], 10.56° [200], and 16.02° [300]. This result indicates that introduction of bulky end groups into P3HT:PCBM films by addition of F-P3HT did not affect the crystallinity of P3HT.

To verify our hypothesis, the surface morphology of the blend films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. S1† (ESI) shows the surface topographic images of films cast from P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM. The introduction of F-P3HT changed the surface morphology. The hydrophobic F-P3HT blend had a rougher surface morphology and a larger domain size compared with the film with no F-P3HT. The rougher surface morphology could be indicative of phase separation between P3HT and PCBM, which might improve charge transport.6
We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to evaluate the morphological changes of the entire film after addition of F-P3HT. In the TEM images shown in Fig. 5, the dark and bright regions correspond to PCBM and P3HT, respectively.4d Comparing the TEM image of the P3HT:PCBM (100:100) film (Fig. 5a) with that of P3HT:F-P3HT:PCBM (98:2:100) (Fig. 5b), the dark regions are slightly more conspicuous and the P3HT crystalline fibrils are maintained. When more F-P3HT was added (Fig. 5c), dark PCBM clusters were clearly evident, and prominent P3HT fibrils were also observed. These observations could be explained by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the blend films (insets of Fig. 5a–c). The outer and broad inner rings evident in the SAED pattern were attributed to (020) reflections of the P3HT fibrils and nanocrystalline PCBM, respectively.18 As shown in Fig. 5d, the intensity of crystalline PCBM was increased after addition of F-P3HT. We previously confirmed that, based on XRD data, the crystallinity of P3HT is not changed after blending with F-P3HT. Thus, the hydrophobic F-P3HT induced phase separation with the relatively hydrophilic PCBM and preserved the crystallinity of P3HT. The XRD, AFM and TEM results are depicted in Fig. 6. The P3HT:PCBM film was composed of P3HT crystals, and was PCBM-rich. The film also contained homogeneous amorphous P3HT and nanocrystalline PCBM regions. After addition of the hydrophobic F-P3HT to the P3HT:PCBM layer, nanocrystalline PCBM underwent phase separation from the homogeneous region, while the crystallinity of P3HT was maintained. These changes generated a large continuous interfacial area between the donor and the acceptor with continuous pathways for holes and electrons. For this reason, device performance might be improved.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized a hydrophobic end-functionalized P3HT (F-P3HT) and investigated the morphological changes that resulted from the hydrophobic–hydrophilic repulsive interactions in the BHJ solar cells and their effects on device performance. Despite the bulky end group, P3HT crystallinity was preserved and the size of the PCBM-rich domains increased after blending with hydrophobic F-P3HT. As a result, efficient exciton dissociation was achieved due to both the larger continuous interface and the enhanced continuous pathways for charge carriers.
