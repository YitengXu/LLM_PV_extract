    , Accepted 11th March 2011First published on 18th April 2011AbstractWe report on the synthesis, electrochemical, photophysical, and photovoltaic properties of a series of three organic dyads comprising a perylene monoimide (PMI) dye connected to a naphthalene diimide (NDI) or a fullerene (C60) for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) with nanocrystalline NiO electrodes. It was found that the secondary electron acceptor (NDI or C60) in all the three dyads extends the charge separated state lifetime by about five orders of magnitude compared to the respective parent PMI dye. Nanosecond pump–probe experiments of the NiO/dyads in the presence of the electrolyte show that the reduction of triiodide by the secondary electron acceptor is slow in all the dyads, which we ascribe to a weak driving force for this reaction. This reaction is significantly faster with the cobalt electrolyte (tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II/III)), whose driving force is larger; however, its reaction with the reduced dyads is still rather slow. We demonstrate that the larger photovoltage observed with the cobalt electrolyte (VOC = 285 mV) relative to the iodide electrolyte (VOC = 120 mV) is due to a decrease in the dark current for the former owing to slower interfacial electron transfer of the reduced mediator with the injected holes into the NiO electrode. In terms of photovoltaic performances, the most efficient dyad is the system in which the NDI is directly connected to the PMI (η = 0.14% under AM 1.5 with the cobalt electrolyte), but the dyad containing the fullerene acceptor exhibits the highest IPCE and the highest short circuit current density (IPCE = 57%, JSC = 1.88 mA cm−2) with the iodide electrolyte. The latter performances are attributed to the slightly stronger reducing power of C60 relative to NDI, which favours the reduction of the mediator in the electrolyte.

Broader context

Fossil fuel shortage and massive pollution issues are among the most concerning issues Mankind is facing today. However, Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are paving the way towards cheap and democratized energy anywhere in the world. While the technology for n-type DSSC has reached an impressive level, the p-type counterpart (pDSSC) remains little explored. Yet, performant pDSSCs are the sine qua non requirement to build tandem DSSCs, the best strategy today to get photovoltaic yields rising above the ominous 11% limit. Numerous leads are to be followed to increase the performances of pDSSC. Among them, it is mandatory to develop new dyes, especially designed for the sensitization of a p-type semi-conductor, namely capable of harvesting a considerable amount of photons over a broad wavelength range, while assisting the photo-induced hole injection into the valence band of the SC. The latter point is an issue of premium relevance, and is at the core of this contribution.

Introduction
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the development of new photovoltaic devices based on the sensitization of wide band-gap p-type semi-conductors (p-SCs) such as nickel oxide.1 The interest in this field is stimulated by both fundamental and practical points of view, in that a more fundamental understanding of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSCs) could provide valuable experimental data to expand the theory of photoinduced interfacial charge separation reactions. Furthermore, efficient p-type photocathodes are a potential key element to prepare inexpensive tandem DSCs with high photo-conversion efficiencies.2–5 Photoelectrochemical devices, such as p-DSCs, could possibly be used for fuel production as part of a photocatalysis system.6–10 In DSCs, the sensitizer is one of the crucial components, which controls the overall performance of the solar cell. Previous work has shown that the charge recombination reaction between the injected holes and the reduced sensitizer is much faster in p-DSCs than conventional DSCs based on n-type SCs, such as TiO2.11–15 This rapid recombination is unfavourable to achieving highly efficient devices; therefore strategies should be developed to circumvent this limitation.
A strategy, we reported earlier,3,11 is to append an electron acceptor (A) to the sensitizer (S), thus increasing the separation distance between the charges (hole in the valence band of NiO and electron on the sensitizer) and to slow down the above mentioned recombination reaction. This approach proved to be effective since the charge separated state was increased by several orders of magnitude and some of the most efficient sensitizers for NiO are dyads of the type S–A.3,5 Taking into consideration this point, we decided to prepare new dyads (PMI–Ph-NDI and PMI–PhC60) which differ from the previously prepared system, PMI–NDI,11 with the presence of a phenyl spacer between the sensitizer and the electron acceptor and in the replacement of the naphthalene diimide (NDI) with a fullerene (C60) (Chart 1). The expected mechanism of hole injection for these dyads, PMI–A, starts with hole injection from the singlet excited state (1*PMI) after photon absorption (eqn (1)) and is followed by a charge shift reaction to A (eqn (2)) forming the final charge separated state A−–PMI/NiO(+). The dyad is then regenerated by electron transfer to the oxidised form of the electrolyte redox mediator (Ox; eqn (3a)), which diffuses to and reacts at the counter electrode, while the NiO holes percolate to the conducting glass back contact to close the circuit. The charge shift and dye regeneration by the electrolyte are in direct competition with the charge recombination between PMI−− or PMI–A−− and the hole in the NiO (eqn (4b) and (4a), respectively), which reduces the photocurrent yield. Another detrimental reaction involves the reduced redox mediator (Red), which can scavenge holes in the SC valence band (eqn (5)). These fundamental electron transfer processes are summarized below: A–1*PMI/NiO → A–PMI−/NiO(+)(1) A–PMI−/NiO(+) → −A–PMI/NiO(+)(2) −A–PMI/NiO(+) + Ox → A–PMI/NiO(+) + Red(3a) A–PMI−/NiO(+) + Ox → A–PMI/NiO(+) + Red(3b) −A–PMI/NiO(+) → A–PMI/NiO(4a) A–PMI−/NiO(+) → A–PMI/NiO(4b) NiO(+) + Red → NiO + Ox(5)
 Chart 1  Structures of the compounds studied in this work. 
Herein, we report a comprehensive study of the three above dyads with different techniques, namely optical transient absorption spectroscopy, photoabsorption spectroscopies, photocurrent–photovoltage spectroscopies, and photoaction spectra of the photovoltaic devices incorporating the above dyads. The important findings of this work are: that the fast electron shift from the sensitizer to the acceptor (eqn (2)) is crucial to compete with the fast recombination reaction (eqn (4b)), and that the improved voltage obtained with the cobalt electrolyte is due to a combination of the slower hole scavenging reaction by the cobalt redox mediator (eqn (5)), which reduces the dark current, and an increased driving force for regeneration (eqn (3)). This study also emphasizes the importance of reduction potential of the acceptor (A/A−) which should be sufficiently negative (below −0.5 V vs.SCE) to guarantee a significant driving force for the regeneration reaction (eqn (3a)).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of the compounds
We previously reported the synthesis of PMI–NDI,11 but an improved route is described herein allowing relatively quick preparation of larger quantities. In this convergent synthesis, the NDI electron acceptor is introduced at the end of the preparation to be condensed with the perylene anhydride 3, which is also the key intermediate for the preparation of PMI–PhNDI (Scheme 1). Furthermore, the phenoxy-benzylic acid handle is introduced in the early stage of the synthesis according to an aromatic nucleophilic substitution of the bromo perylene imide 1 by the benzyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, avoiding the Buchwald–Hartwig palladium cross-coupling reaction previously used11 (Scheme 1). Both the hydrolysis of the bisimide group of 2 and the benzyl ester were performed in one pot with KOH in tert-butanol.16 The naphthalene diimide 5 was synthesized in good yield by amidification of the easily prepared naphthalene anhydride 417 with hydrazine in DMF. Finally, condensation of naphthalene diimide 5 with perylene anhydride 3 yields the desired PMI–NDI with a 66% yield (Scheme 1). This new reaction sequence gives access to several hundreds of milligrams of this dyad with only a few weeks bench work and represents an improvement in achieving PMI–NDI synthesis compared to the previous route.11 The synthesis of the new dyad PMI–PhNDI is shown in Scheme 2. It starts with the condensation of the tert-butyl carbamate (BOC) protected p-phenylenediamine with naphthalene monoanhydride 4, followed by the cleavage of the BOC group with TFA to afford the naphthalene diimide 7 in 70% overall yield. The last step is the amidification of perylene anhydride 3 with naphthalene diimide 7 and gives PMI–PhNDI in 45% yield (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 1  Preparation of the dyad PMI–NDI. Reagents and conditions: (a) benzyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, K2CO3, DMF, reflux, 1 h, 85%; (b) KOH, tBuOH, reflux, 2 h, 80%; (c) hydrazine monohydrate, DMF, reflux, 1 h, 77%; (d) Zn(OAc)2·4H2O, imidazole, 140 °C, 2 h, 66%. 
 Scheme 2  Preparation of the dyad PMI–PhNDI. Reagents and conditions: (a) N-Boc-p-phenylenediamine, DMF, 120 °C, 12 h, 74%; (b) TFA, CH2Cl2, r.t., 30 min, 95%; (c) Zn(OAc)2·4H2O, imidazole, 140 °C, 2 h, 45%. 
The preparation of the dyad PMI–PhC60 requires more steps than the previous dyads and could not be achieved with the same phenoxy-benzylic acid handle, this is why the ether bond was replaced by a direct carbon–carbon bond. The fullerene moiety is installed at the end of the synthesis owing to the potential retro Diels–Alder side-reaction, which can occur upon strong heating or in the presence of palladium catalysts. First, the organo-tin reagent 14 is prepared by esterification of chloro-4-iodobenzoyl 11 with 4-methoxy-benzylic alcohol 12, followed by stannylation with hexabutylditin and a palladium catalyst (Scheme 3).18 The methoxy-benzylic ester is preferred over the benzyl ester, because it is removed in milder conditions. Second, the perylene monoimide 8, which is obtained by hydrolysis of 1, was amidified with diacetal aniline 919 in imidazole melt.
 Scheme 3  Preparation of the dyad PMI–PhC60. Reagents and conditions: (a) Zn(OAc)2·4H2O, imidazole, 140 °C, 2 h, 55%; (b) DMAP, Et3N, CH2Cl2, 0 °C to r.t., 85%; (c) Bu6Sn2, Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, reflux, 12 h, 53%; (d) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, reflux, 20 h, 73%; (e) TFA, H2SO4 aq, CHCl3, r.t., 24 h, 48%; (f) C60, sarcosine, toluene, 130 °C, 15 h, 66%; (g) TFA, CH2Cl2, r.t., 2 h, 82%. 
Then, the anchoring group is coupled to perylene imide 10via a Stille cross-coupling reaction with 14 to give perylene imide 15 in a 73% yield. Surprisingly, the formation of the ether bond between 10 and benzyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, or its parent ester, employing either Ullmann or Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reactions failed. In the final steps, the acetal protecting group of 15 is selectively removed in acidic conditions, without hydrolysis of the ester group, and the Prato reaction20 with fullerene and sarcosine gives 17 in 66% yield. The p-methoxybenzyl ester is cleaved by trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature in dichloromethane and the dyad PMI–PhC60 was obtained in 82% yield, after purification. The preparation of the reference perylene imide 18 was undertaken according to a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between perylene imide 1 and commercially available 4-carboxyphenyl boronic acid (Scheme 4).

UV-vis absorption spectra

The spectra of the three dyads are shown in Fig. 1 and the absorption characteristics are gathered in Table 1. The visible part of electronic absorption spectra of all the dyads is dominated by the absorbance of the π–π* transition of the PMI dye.21

The naphthalene diimide22 and the fulleropyrrolidine23 units have minimal absorption at wavelengths longer than 400 nm (Fig. S1†). As anticipated, the ground-state electronic communication between the PMI and the electron acceptor (NDI or C60) is very weak. This is attributed to the presence of a nodal plane on the nitrogen of the imide groups in PMI and NDI in the HOMO and LUMO orbitals21,24 and the steric interaction that forces the bridging phenyl group and the NDI group in PMI–NDI out of plane with the PMI unit.
Interestingly, the replacement of the carbon–carbon bond by an ether linkage between the PMI and the benzoic acid anchoring group gives only a small perturbation of the π–π* transition on PMI, as shown by the near superposition of the absorption spectra for 18 and 19 (Fig. S1†). As a result, these two sensitizers are expected to display similar light harvesting properties. On the other hand, the PMI transition in PMI–NDI is distinctly red shifted with respect to that of 19 or PMI–Ph-NDI, showing that the PMI chromophore of PMI–NDI senses the presence of the nearby NDI.
Electrochemical study
The redox potentials of the compounds measured by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) are gathered in Table 2. The PMI sensitizers 18 and 19 are reversibly reduced at −1.01 V and −1.03 V vs.SCE and reversibly oxidised at 1.19 V and 1.21 V, respectively. Therefore, the replacement of the O–C linkage by a C–C bond, in 19 to 18, does not significantly shift the redox potentials of the PMI. This indicates that the modification of the substituent does not affect the energy of the HOMO or LUMO orbitals. In the dyads, the electron acceptor NDI or C60 is reduced at a more positive potential (between −0.5 and −0.7 V vs.SCE) than PMI, which leaves a significant driving force for the electron shift from reduced PMI to the acceptor (−ΔG0 = 0.3 − 0.4 eV).

The slight interaction between the units in PMI–NDI seen in the absorption spectra is reflected also in the PMI and NDI potentials that are both somewhat more positive than in the other compounds.

Electron transfer studies by transient absorption spectroscopy
The electron transfer dynamics of the dyes in CH2Cl2 solution and on NiO films were studied by femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies (see Experimental). The solution phase dynamics of the singlet excited-state of both 18 and 19 exhibit similar and expected behaviour. Time-resolved spectral and kinetic data are shown in the ESI† (Table S1, Fig. S2 and S3). Previous reports on PMI–NDI5b,11 attest to the ability of PMI–NDI to undergo intramolecular charge separation upon photoexcitation in solution. The time constant associated with the charge separation step (1*PMI–NDI → PMI˙+–NDI˙−) is ∼1 ps, while the subsequent charge recombination process (PMI˙+–NDI˙− → PMI–NDI) occurs with a time constant of ∼50 ps. Fig. 2 shows transient spectra at 3 ps after excitation, where PMI–NDI (solid) exhibits the typical features of the charge separated state: a ground state bleach accompanied by two absorption peaks at 475 and 600 nm from the NDI radical anion and a third peak from the PMI radical cation.11,22 Modification of PMI–NDI to include a phenyl spacer, PMI–PhNDI, has a significant impact on the solution phase behaviour of the dyad, in that photoexcitation of PMI–PhNDI does not result in charge separation. In contrast, transient spectra of PMI–PhNDI (Fig. 2, dashed line) only exhibit features associated with the 1*PMI excited state, which decay on the time scale of a few nanoseconds. Based on the data in Table 2 there is ample driving force for charge separation in both dyads (ΔG0 ≈ e(E0 (PMI/PMI) − E0 (NDI/NDI)) − E00 = −0.5 eV). Evidently, the phenyl spacer weakens the electronic coupling of the PMI and NDI units enough to make electron transfer slow compared to the intrinsic decay of the 1*PMI excited state. Full spectra for both NDI-dyads are presented in the ESI† (Fig. S4). Additionally, in PMI–PhC60 we do not observe electron transfer; however, we do observe rapid energy transfer from the 1*PMI excited state to the singlet excited state of pyrrolidino fullerene (1*C60). Both the PMI excited state absorption and the ground state bleach decay with a time constant of ∼3 ps, indicating that the PMI unit returns to its ground state despite a long-lived red absorption of 600 nm (Fig. S5†). Complete recovery of the ground state bleach of the PMI unit in PMI–PhC60 is inconsistent with charge separation and suggests rapid energy transfer from the photoexcited 1*PMI to 1*C60, which persists for the remainder of the measurement. The red absorption of 600 nm has been observed previously for 1*C60.25
 Fig. 2  Transient absorption spectra for PMI–NDI and PMI–PhNDI in CH2Cl2. Both spectra, PMI–NDI (solid) and PMI–PhNDI (dashed), are at a 10 ps delay after excitation with 520 nm (700 nJ). (Inset) Kinetic traces at 475 nm probe for PMI–NDI (open triangles) and PMI–PhNDI (closed squares). 
Transient absorption experiments were also performed on NiO films sensitized with the dyes and dyads, in the presence of different propylene carbonate solutions of electrolyte (see Experimental). All PMI-based sensitizers exhibit hole injection into the NiO (eqn (1)) on the time scale of 3 ps or less. The time constants obtained from a global fit of the transient data are reported in the ESI† (Table S2). Films sensitized with PMIs 18 and 19 show recombination to the ground state (eqn (4b)) on the ∼100 ps time scale, with a small fraction (∼10%) of the signal persisting on a time scale longer than 5 ns. No significant difference in injection or recombination times is observed for PMI/NiO films when the experiment is performed in the presence of either the iodide or cobalt redox electrolytes. The relatively rapid recombination of the PMI radical anion with the hole in the NiO is the most likely reason for the poor performance of PMI monomers as sensitizers in NiO-based DSCs.5b,11–13
Appending an acceptor to the PMI unit was shown previously to dramatically increase the performance of a PMI-based sensitizer on NiO.5b,11 This was attributed to the long-lived nature of the final charge separated state (eqn (2)) enabling efficient electron transfer to the redox mediator (eqn (3a)). As previously reported,5b,11PMI–NDI/NiO undergoes a two step charge separation upon photoexcitation. Initial hole injection into the NiO occurs from the 1*PMI excited state (eqn (1)), resulting in PMI˙− as evidenced by an absorptive feature around 620 nm. Inconveniently, oxidised NiO exhibits only weak absorptions across the spectral area of interest, making it difficult to directly observe the holes in NiO. The PMI˙− state subsequently undergoes a charge shift to the NDI acceptor (eqn (2)), as seen by the appearance of NDI˙− features in the transient spectrum: a strong peak around 475 nm and a weaker one at 605 nm.22 Hole injection occurs rapidly, τ = 0.3–2 ps, as does the subsequent electron transfer to the NDI, τ = 28 ps. While it is difficult to calculate an exact yield of NDI˙− from the initially formed PMI˙−, a lower estimate is 85%. The overlapping features of PMI˙− absorptions around 475 and 610 nm make it difficult to accurately determine the NDI˙− formation. Thus, the yield is most likely higher than 85% and close to unity.
We observe very similar time constants for PMI–NDI/NiO in the various electrolytes and believe that there is little to no impact on the hole injection or charge shift steps (Table S3†) that can be attributed to the electrolyte. Since we do not observe any significant differences on the ≤5 ns timescale, in the presence of the I3−/I− or CoII/III electrolytes, the majority of regeneration (eqn (3)) seems to occur on time scales longer than 5 ns.
Photoexcitation of PMI–PhNDI/NiO results in the rapid formation of the PMI radical anionvia hole injection into NiO with time constants of 0.3–3.2 ps. Subsequent dynamics associated with the decay of PMI˙− occurs on two time scales, with τ = 45 ps and 300 ps. Fig. 3 shows a kinetic trace monitoring 475 nm, both PMI˙− and NDI˙−radical anions absorb for PMI–PhNDI/NiO (open symbols) and PMI–NDI/NiO (closed symbols). We observe an interesting decay/growth of the 475 nm signal in PMI–PhNDI that is not observed in PMI–NDI/NiO. This behaviour is most likely due to the competition between a charge shift to NDI (eqn (2)) and recombination to the ground state (eqn (4b)), which is most likely driven by the insulating effect of the phenyl spacer, reducing the electronic coupling of the PMI with the NDI. Additionally, interfacial electron transfer kinetics of most dyes on NiO are highly heterogeneous, mostly due to different local environments of the dye on the NiO surface and the variation of the local surface charge on the NiO particles.13,14,17 For PMI–PhNDI/NiO the heterogeneous nature of the observed kinetics may additionally result from the restriction of the aromatic groups leading to several conformers with different electronic couplings.
 Fig. 3  Kinetic comparison of PMI–NDI and PMI–PhNDI on NiO, excitation at 520 nm (400 nJ). Kinetic traces at 475 nm for PMI–NDI/NiO (solid circles) and PMI–PhNDI/NiO (open triangles), both in the presence of the cobalt electrolyte, see text for details. 
The charge shift yield of PMI–PhNDI/NiO is best determined by considering relative amplitudes at 605 nm (PMI˙−) and 475 nm (NDI˙−) at 3 ps and 3 ns, respectively. From these relative amplitudes, approximately 50% of PMI˙− does not undergo a charge shift to the NDI. As in the PMI–NDI/NiO case, there seems to be no significant difference in the observed kinetics or relative amplitudes, despite the presence of the I3−/I− or cobalt-based electrolyte. Thus, the majority of the regeneration (eqn (3)) must be occurring on time scales longer than 5 ns.
As in the above dyes, coupling the PMI–PhC60 dyad to NiO also results in rapid formation of the PMI radical anion (τ = 0.3–1 ps) and subsequent rapid charge transfer to the C60 (τ = 2–20 ps). The resulting spectrum resembles that of C60˙−; however, the main signature for C60˙− is an absorption band around 950–1000 nm.25,26 With the current arrangement of our ultrafast transient absorption we are not able to probe in this region. The C60˙− signal seems to persist for the remainder of the measurement with no indication of recombination. Again, the presence of the electrolyte does not significantly impact the observed kinetics, nor does it impact the spectral properties observed on this time scale, suggesting that regeneration occurs mainly on time scales longer than 5 ns.
Nanosecond flash-photolysis experiments probing the NDI˙− decay at 475 nm yield information on the regeneration and recombination of PMI–NDI and PMI–PhNDI bound to NiO in the presence of the various electrolytes.27 In the presence of 0.1 M LiClO4 propylene carbonate solution, both PMI–NDI/NiO and PMI–PhNDI/NiO show a decay of the NDI˙− signal due to the intrinsic recombination, best fit to a biexponential function (Table 3).

The corresponding experiment with the PMI dyes 18 and 19 gave no detectable transient signals on this time scale,5b consistent with predominantly <10 ns recombination. The presence of the iodide electrolyte slows down the NDI˙− decay, contrary to what would be expected if dye regeneration (eqn (3)) was competing with recombination (eqn (4a)). An analogous increase in dye anion radical lifetime in the presence of I3−/I− was observed for coumarin 343 on NiO14 and was attributed to the reduction of NiIII sites in the NiO film, which decreases the hole concentration and slows down recombination (Fig. S6 and S7†). Because of the decrease in recombination rate, it is not possible to determine the rate of dye regeneration by simply taking the difference in rate with and without the I3−/I− electrolyte. Furthermore, the photoproducts associated with the I3−/I− couple14 are relatively weak and overlap with the spectroscopic features of NDI˙−, which adds to the difficulty in determining the absolute regeneration yield. In the presence of the CoIII/II electrolyte; however, the kinetics are significantly faster than in either the Li+ or the I3−/I− electrolytes, indicating that regeneration efficiently competes with recombination. Fig. 4 compares kinetic traces at 475 nm for PMI–PhNDI/NiO in Li+ solution and in cobalt electrolyte (Fig. S8–S10†). Despite using the same film for both measurements, the regeneration of the sensitizer causes the initial amplitude to appear attenuated on the experimental time scale. An early time comparison of PMI–NDI/NiO in the presence of the CoII/III and Li+ electrolytes is shown in Fig. S11†.

          Regeneration kinetics for PMI–C60/NiO were obtained using signals at 420 nm in the flash photolysis experiment, due to the signal-to-noise in the near infrared. Probing in the NIR between 900 and 1150 nm we observe a signal maximum around 950–1000 nm; however, the signal-to-noise ratio is low. The various kinetic traces acquired in the NIR are presented in the ESI† (Fig. S12). The signal around 1000 nm is indicative of C60˙−(ref. 26) and it retains the same decay time constant as the signals in the visible region, thus we infer that the visible signals are due to the presence of C60˙−. The observed recombination kinetics in 0.1 M LiClO4 propylene carbonate solution indicate that the C60 radical anion decays to baseline with a time constant of 2.4 ± 0.25 µs (Fig. S13†). In the presence of the CoIII/II or I3−/I− based electrolyte, most of the signal decreases faster, indicating regeneration of C60 by the electrolytes, while some of the signal remains on the microsecond time scale.
Photovoltaic measurements

          NiO films sensitized with the different dyes and dyads were assembled into solar cell devices (see Experimental section). Table 4 summarises the photovoltaic properties of each of these devices, either with the I3−/I− or the CoIII/II electrolyte. PMIs 18 and 19 performed similarly, irrespective of the difference in the anchoring group. The best photoconversion efficiency (η = 0.14%) is obtained using the PMI–NDI sensitizer with the CoIII/II based electrolyte. The best photocurrent yield (APCE or IPCE) is obtained for the PMI–PhC60 sensitizer (57%); however, the VOC for this device (0.095 V) was lower than for devices sensitized with the other dyads, PMI–NDI (0.12 V) and PMI–PhNDI (0.13 V).

The photovoltaic properties were found to be dependent on the electrolyte used. Performance differences between the various sensitizers are most marked for the devices incorporating the cobalt-based electrolyte. For these devices, the PMI 19-sensitized device does not generate any photocurrent, whilst the PMI–PhNDI and PMI–NDI-sensitized devices give short-circuit currents of 0.78 and 1.20 mA cm−2 and APCEs of 19% and 43%, respectively.
The IPCE spectra for these devices are shown in Fig. 5. The PMI–NDI device gives a higher VOC (0.285 V) than the PMI–PhNDI device (0.210 V). The results with the I3−/I− electrolyte are instead surprisingly similar for all five dyes and dyads, despite the many orders of magnitude slower recombination for the dyads.

Comparisons of the electron transfer kinetics and photovoltaic performance
The best photovoltaic performance is obtained with the CoII/III based electrolyte and the PMI–acceptor dyad sensitizers. The CoIII(dtb)3 is a relatively slow acceptor, however: the main component of NDI˙−oxidation has a time constant of ∼1 µs. With 0.1 M CoIII(dtb)3 this corresponds to a homogeneous second-order rate constant around 1 × 107 M−1s−1, in spite of a large driving force: ΔG0 = −0.6 eV. CoIII/IIredox couples are known to be intrinsically slow in electron transfer reactions, due to their large inner reorganization energy and the electron spin change in going from the CoIII singlet state to the CoII ground state quartet.28 In addition, the tert-butyl groups may slow down diffusion and be sterically hindered from approaching at the NiO surface, thus contributing to lower the rate. In order to benefit from the favourable properties of the cobalt electrolyte, the charge recombination must be slowed down compared to the typical ∼100 ps time scale observed for most dyes on NiO.13,14,17 Here we have shown, by transient absorption spectroscopy, that for all three dyads investigated recombination with the NiO holes is slowed down remarkably, by approximately five orders of magnitude compared to the PMI dyes 18 and 19. Thus, while the latter give very small APCE values and photocurrents with CoIII/II electrolyte, hardly above the dark currents, the dyads give an APCEmax up to 43%. The two-fold lower APCE for PMI–PhNDI compared to PMI–NDI is consistent with the partial (∼50%) recombination of PMI− and NiO(+) observed on the picosecond time scale in the former compound, in competition with charge shift to the acceptor.
Moreover, for all the dyads the CoII/III electrolyte gives a higher photovoltage (VOC) than I3−/I−. The VOC of a p-type DSC, such as NiO, is the difference between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the quasi-fermi level close to the valence band of the NiO. The redox potentials (E0) of the electrolytes used in this study are −0.27 V vs.Fc+/0 for the lithium triiodide/iodide and −0.30 V vs.Fc+/0 for the CoIII/IItris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl) perchlorate. Therefore, it is expected that the VOC for the devices should be similar. Fig. S16 in the ESI† shows, however, that the dark current for the device using I3−/I− is significantly higher than for the device using CoIII/II as a redox couple. Thus, the “dark” reaction between the redox couple and the NiO is competing with photocurrent generation. Fig. 6 shows a plot of the hole transport times (measured at short circuit) and hole lifetimes (measured at open circuit) at different light intensities, for the same devices as used in Fig. S16†. Both are measured using time-resolved small light intensity-modulation techniques29 and the data are plotted against the VOC obtained at the given light intensity. The lifetime of the holes is dependent on the light intensity since the rate of their recombination with the electrolyte increases as more holes in the NiO are generated. For both devices the transport time was independent of the light intensity and therefore remains largely constant until the lifetime is similar to or shorter than the time it takes for the hole to reach the charge collector. With I3−/I− the hole lifetime is shorter than with the CoIII/IIredox couple and the two lines for τtr and τh intersect at VOC ≈ 0.12 V with I3−/I−, as compared to ∼0.30 V with CoIII/II. We attribute the relatively long hole lifetimes in the presence of the cobalt species to the large steric bulk of the tertiary-butyl substituents on the bipyridyl ligands, which increase the distance between the NiO and the cobalt, and the intrinsic sluggishness of the CoIII/IIredox couple.28 Efforts to further slow these dark reactions are ongoing.

The results with the I3−/I− electrolyte are more complicated to explain. The transient absorption data show a ∼105-fold decrease in the dye-NiO recombination rate but the photocurrent and APCE values are nevertheless very similar for the PMI dyes 18 and 19 and the dyads. The transient data show slow regeneration of the dyads by I3−/I−, on the order of 10 µs. For the PMIs 18 and 19, significant regeneration must occur on the sub-nanosecond time scale since the APCE values of 31% greatly exceed the fraction of PMI− remaining on the nanosecond time scale (∼10%; Fig. S6 and S7†). Partial regeneration by I3− on the picosecond time scale is hard to detect as the resulting I2˙− absorption is relatively weak compared to that of the PMI transients, and for optical reasons a lower concentration of the electrolyte had to be used. Iodide-based redox couples are complex and their means of interaction with sensitizers still not well established.14,30 Evidence for ultra-fast regeneration (∼10 ps time scale) of coumarin 343 on NiO by I3−/I− has been presented in the literature.14 This necessitates pre-association with the sensitizer and we propose that this could also be the case with the PMIs studied here.
The modest photovoltaic improvement and dramatically slower regeneration kinetics with the dyads can partially be explained by the lower driving force for reoxidation of the NDI and C60 units (Fig. S14 and S15†). As discussed elsewhere,31,32 the standard redox potential of the I3−/I−redox couple in acetonitrile is ∼−0.28 V vs.Fc+/0. However, the regeneration reaction should proceed via the following, one-electron process:S˙− + I3− → S + I2˙− + I−
Following the discussion by Boschloo and Hagfeldt,32 the I3−/(I−, I2˙−) potential would lie near −0.9 V vs.Fc+/0 (−0.5 V vs.SCE, using a value of 0.38 V for Fc+/0vs.SCE33) which is close to the E0 values of the NDI0/− and C600/− couples in Table 2. C60− is more reducing than the NDI− units (Table 2), which may explain why I3−/I− regenerates PMI–C60 more rapidly than the other dyads (Table 3) while the difference with CoIII/II is small. Although the solvents differ for these electrochemical measurements and for the DSC experiments here, it is clear that the driving force for regeneration in the dyads must be rather small compared to the case with PMI−. Nevertheless, regeneration of the NDI and C60 units does occur with high efficiency: the ultra-fast charge shift from PMI− to the appended NDI or C60 unit leads to an increased photocurrent compared to the PMIs (APCE = 40–60% compared to 31%) that cannot be explained if the I3−/I− electrolyte would not be able to regenerate the dyads. The similarity in photocurrent yields for the PMIs and the dyads must be a coincidence, where the ∼105-fold slower recombination with the latter is counteracted by a similar decrease in the regeneration rate due to the smaller driving force.
Conclusion
In this study, we report the synthesis and the comprehensive investigation of a series of three PMI–acceptor dyads. When bound to nano-porous NiO films, all three dyads presented here exhibit ultrafast (τ ≈ 0.3–3 ps) hole injection from the excited PMI unit to the NiO valence band. Transient absorption measurements show that the radical anion of the PMI unit is formed and undergoes charge shift to the acceptor unit (NDI or C60), which localizes the electron at a longer distance from the NiO surface. The resulting charge separated state is long-lived, recombining on the µs time scale, which is a dramatic improvement compared to the recombination with the PMI dyes 18 and 19 that occurs on the ∼100 ps time scale. Both PMI–NDI/NiO and PMI–PhC60/NiO exhibit rapid (τ = 2–20 ps) formation of the final charge separated state A˙−–PMI/NiO(+) that competes favourably with recombination, resulting in charge shift yields greater than 80%. The charge shift in PMI–PhNDI/NiO shows more complex kinetics that compete with recombination, and only achieves a 50% yield of the NDI˙−. With CoIII/II electrolyte the devices sensitized with dyads show much better photovoltaic performance than those with the PMI dyes. The CoIII/II mediator appears to require a long-lived radical anion in order to efficiently regenerate the sensitizer. Transient absorption measurements in the presence of CoIII/II also indicate regeneration of the dyads on a time scale of a few µs.
Surprisingly, there was little difference in DSC performance between the dyads and the PMI dyes when I3−/I− electrolyte was used. Although direct evidence could not be obtained from the transient data it seems that partial regeneration of the PMIs must occur on the picosecond time scale in order to explain the high APCE values (31%). This is in contrast to the dyads where reoxidation of the NDI˙− or C60˙− species in I3−/I− occurs on the µs time scale. We suggest that the much slower regeneration for the latter is because the redox potentials of NDI0/− and C600/− are less negative than for PMI0/− leading to a nearly isoergonic electron transfer from the secondary acceptor radicals to the relevant electrolyte couple: A˙− + I3− → A + I2˙− + I−.
The photovoltage obtained with the dyads was higher with CoIII/II than I3−/I− as an electrolyte, VOC = 0.28 V and 0.12 V, respectively, with PMI–NDI.36 The formal potentials for these redox couples are very similar, but measurements of hole life time and transport time in the devices show that recombination of NiO holes with the electrolyte is faster with I3−/I− than CoIII/II. This is an additional contribution to the higher photovoltage with the latter electrolyte.
From the results presented herein, we conclude that efficient sensitizers for NiO-based DSCs should have the ability to separate the electron on the dye far from the hole in NiO, to overcome the rapid primary recombination observed with most dyes. When these charges are efficiently separated and the charge separated lifetime is longer than 10 ns alternative redox couples, such as tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridene)cobalt(II/III), that afford a larger VOC can be employed.
Experimental section
Transient absorption spectroscopy systems have been described previously.13,37 Excitation energies ranged from 200–700 nJ per pulse and excitation of the sensitized films for spectroscopic measurements was achieved through the back contact. Films for the spectroscopic measurements were deposited on conductive glass and covered with a glass slide cover to retain the electrolyte solution through capillary action. All films were translated during the ultrafast measurements and each spectrum is an average of 10 scans of 500 shots each time point. Nanosecond traces are an average of 20 shots with excitation energies around 2 µJ per pulse.
A triblock co-polymer F108–templated precursor solution of NiO was prepared according to the published procedure by Sumikura et al.34 Two layers of the precursor solution were applied to conducting glass substrates (Pilkington TEC8, sheet resistance 8 Ω per square) by doctor blading using Scotch® tape as a spacer (0.32 cm2 active area). The films were heated in an oven at 450 °C for 30 min after each deposition step. The film thicknesses were measured with a Sloan Dektak profilometer and found to be approximately 2 µm thick. The NiO electrodes were soaked in an acetone solution of 18, PMI–NDI, PMI–PhNDI and PMI–PhC60 or a methanoic solution of 19 (0.1 mM) for 16 h at room temperature. The sensitized NiO electrodes were assembled face-to-face with a platinized counter electrode using a 50 µm thick thermoplastic frame (Surlyn 1702). The electrolyte, containing 1.0 M LiI and 0.1 M I2 in propylene carbonate (A), or acetonitrile (C) or Co(II/III) tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl) perchlorate (0.1 M/0.1 M) and LiClO4 (0.1 M) in propylene carbonate (B), was introduced through the pre-drilled hole in the counter electrode, which was then sealed. IPCE and photoelectrochemical properties were recorded using a computerized set-up.35 Hole transport times and lifetimes in the complete devices were measured using time-resolved small light modulation techniques.
Tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl)cobalt(II/III) perchlorate was prepared as described in ref. 3.

We have observed differences in decay rates that are dependent on the intensity of the white light sources. When the light is amplified in “pulsed” mode, which is the typical mode, the decay is more rapid. When the white light is “non-pulsed” the decay times are longer; however, these are measured using a variable impedance switch, which obscures the earlier time scales (100 ns–110 µs). We report here values obtained in “pulsed” mode since this is the typical arrangement for flash-photolysis systems.

Fossil fuel shortage and massive pollution issues are among the most concerning issues Mankind is facing today. However, Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are paving the way towards cheap and democratized energy anywhere in the world. While the technology for n-type DSSC has reached an impressive level, the p-type counterpart (pDSSC) remains little explored. Yet, performant pDSSCs are the sine qua non requirement to build tandem DSSCs, the best strategy today to get photovoltaic yields rising above the ominous 11% limit. Numerous leads are to be followed to increase the performances of pDSSC. Among them, it is mandatory to develop new dyes, especially designed for the sensitization of a p-type semi-conductor, namely capable of harvesting a considerable amount of photons over a broad wavelength range, while assisting the photo-induced hole injection into the valence band of the SC. The latter point is an issue of premium relevance, and is at the core of this contribution.
