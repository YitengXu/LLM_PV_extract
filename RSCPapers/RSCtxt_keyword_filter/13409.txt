The enhancement of triazole and carboxylate groups in the dendritic structures significantly alter the absorption, electrochemical and DSSCs behaviors.

Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been the subject of intense research during the past years due to their high photoelectric conversion efficiency, simple assembly technology and potential economic advantages.1–4 A typical solar cell has three components: (i) a sensitized photoanode, which is typically a dye sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film on a transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass; (ii) an electrolyte solution containing I−/I3− as a redox couple; and (iii) a cathode, which is a platinized (Pt) FTO conducting glass.
Although there are many factors that determine the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs, the role of the electrolyte in enhancing performance is obviously a crucial one. Adding certain compounds to the electrolytic solution can remarkably improve solar cell performance. One of the most frequently used additive is TBP.5 Gratzel and coworkers6 conducted a study on an I−/I3− electrolyte with TBP as an additive in acetonitrile and found that the addition of TBP drastically increase the Voc, the fill factor and the solar energy conversion efficiency without altering Jsc.
Organic molecules play a significant role in photovoltaic and light harvesting systems due to their excellent optical and electrical properties.7–9 N-containing organic molecules are commonly used an additive in electrolytic solution to improve the performance of DSSC.10 N-containing heterocycles other than TBP such as pyrazole, imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole, pyridine, pyrimidine and pyrazine have been recently used as an additive in DSSC.11
Among several organic frameworks, dendrimer have been suggested to be an efficient design criterion for new artificial light harvesting and solar energy conversion devices.12–14

        Dendrimers are perfect monodisperse macromolecules with a regular and highly branched three-dimensional architecture, which offer a variety of applications in optoelectronic and electronic devices.15–18
In this connection, 1,2,3-triazole offer various applications as flurophores, chemosensors and charge transfer agents.19–21 Recently, we have reported the synthesis of various novel triazole dendrimers with chalcone and glucose moiety at the periphery through the ‘click’ approach22,23 and application of such dendrimers as additive to enhance the performance of DSSC.24
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of dendritic compound 1 and 2. 
The introduction of N-containing heterocycles at the periphery in dendrimer as an additive with electrolytic solution could improve the efficiency of DSSC and the presence of such units at the surface would further increase the efficiencies of the DSSCs due to the valence effect.25
Inspired by the wide applications of 1,2,3-triazole unit in dendrimers, we report herein the synthesis of dendritic molecules 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) and their optical and electrochemical behaviours. Further, feasibility of enhancing solar cell performance with 1,2,3-triazole dendrimer 1 and 2 as an additive using I−/I3− electrolyte has been also investigated.
Results and discussions
Synthesis
Dendritic molecules 1 and 2 were synthesized through ‘click’ and O-alkylation methodologies. In order to synthesise such dendrimers 1 and 2, dendron 4 and 7 were synthesized24 in good yields and summarized in Schemes 1 and 2.
 Scheme 1  (i) 1.25 equiv. propargyl bromide, K2CO3, DMF, 24 h, 60 °C, 4 (91%). (ii) CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol %), NaAsc, (10 mol %), THF: H2O (1:1), rt, 12 h, 1 (84%).

Hexakis(azidomethyl)benzene
826 and hexakis(bromomethyl)benzene 927 were used as core units for the preparation of dendrimers 1 and 2. Dendrimer 1 was obtained in a 84% yield by the treatment of 1.0 equiv. of azide 8 with 6.2 equiv. of alkyne 4 under ‘click’ chemistry reaction conditions viz., 5 mol % CuSO4·5H2O and 10 mol % sodium ascorbate in THF–H2O (1:1) for 12 h at room temperature (Scheme 1).
The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 displayed three sharp singlets at δ 3.78, δ 5.02 and δ 5.99 for carboxylate methyl, N-methylene and O-methylene protons in addition to twenty four aromatic protons. In 13C NMR spectrum, compound 1 showed three peaks at δ 29.5, δ 52.3, and δ 62.0 for carboxylate methyl, N-methylene and O-methylene carbons respectively. The estercarbonyl carbon appeared at δ 165.6 in addition to seven aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF) of 1 showed a molecular ion peak at m/z 1897. The structure of 1 was further confirmed from elemental analysis.
Reaction of 1.0 equiv. of bromide 9 with 6.2 equiv. of dendron 7 under O-alkylation using K2CO3 in DMF at 60 °C for 48 h gave the dendrimer 2 in 79% yield (Scheme 2).
In the 1H NMR spectrum, dendrimer 2 displayed seventy two-proton singlet at δ 3.86 for carboxylate methyl, athirty six-proton singlet at δ 5.13 for benzylic and N-methylene, a twenty four-proton singlet at δ 5.44 for O-methylene protons in addition to aromatic protons. In 13C NMR spectrum, dendrimer 2 displayed four signals at δ 52.4, δ 53.6, δ 62.1 and δ 64.0 for carboxylate methyl, N-methylene and O-methylene carbons in addition to ten aromatic carbons. The carbonyl carbon of carboxylate ester appeared at δ 165.8. The mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF) of 2 showed the molecular ion peak at m/z 4354. The structure of 2 was further confirmed from elemental analysis.

          Dendrimer
          1 exhibited only one absorption band at 307 nm, however, dendrimer 2, showed two absorption bands, a weak band at 285 nm and strong band at 308 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). As the number of triazole and carboxylate unit increases in the dendrimer structure the absorption also increases, which indicates that the amount of light absorbed by the dendritic antenna increases from one generation to the next.28
Electrochemical studies
The redox behavior of dendrimers 1 and 2 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in DMSO (1 × 10−5 M) at room temperature. Both the compounds have an electrochemical response, and the cyclic voltammogram is shown in Fig. 3, with redox potentials are listed in Table 1. The redox potential of dendrimers 1 and 2 are almost similar, and a multi-reduction peak was observed in the cyclic voltammogram.
 Fig. 3  
Cyclic voltammogram of dendrimer 1 and 2 in DMSO at room temperature. 
In Fig. 3, dendrimer 1 exhibited three irreversible reduction waves at −0.94 V, −1.06 V and −1.23 V. Similarly, dendrimer 2 exhibited three irreversible reduction waves at −0.96 V, −1.07 V and −1.22 V. The multi-reduction pattern of the dendritic molecules may be due to the presence of the large numbers of triazole isophthalate as the building and surface groups. The presence of triazole units is responsible for the CV behaviour of the dendrimers.

Dye-sensitized solar cell studies
In an attempt to improve the solar cell performance, many studies have examined the role of the electrolytic solution in enhancing performance.29 In general, the amine derivatives drastically increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the electron donating nature of the nitrogen lone pair.30–32 In addition to this, various nitrogen based organic molecules like aminopyridine, pyrimidine, pyrrolidinopyridine, pyrrolidinoethylpyridine have also been used as additives in DSSCs.30 Based on the above fact, the dendrimers 1 and 2 are evaluated for DSSCs due to high molecular weight and the presence of a large number of electron donating atoms. The dendrimers 1 and 2 form charge transfer complexes with iodine in the redox couple (I−/I3−) in photovoltaic devices. The present investigation reports that the dendrimer additive in the I−/I3− electrolyte solution influences ruthenium dye (Fig. 4) sensitized solar cell performance and the Voc values are drastically altered. The chemical reaction of charge-transfer complexation of dendrimers in electrolyte solution is given below.Dendrimer + I3− → Dendrimer I2 + I−

The DSSC study revealed that the dendrimers bearing triazole and ester groups, contain more nitrogen and oxygen atoms, form a charge transfer complex with I2 in the redox couple and result in a decrease in the sublimation of iodine and also reflects in high performance of DSSC. Moreover, the efficiency of the DSSC increases with an increase in triazole and ester units into the dendritic structures, which is usually referred to as the multivalent effect25 in dendrimer chemistry. For example, dendritic structure 2, bearing a large number of triazole and ester groups shows a high DSSC performance (Fig. 5). Among the dendritic structures 1 and 2, compound 2 showed a high Voc of 0.675 V and a η value of 7.2% in DSSC. These performances are higher than those reported earlier by us for dendrimer additives.24

In conclusion, photoelectrochemical and DSSC properties increase with increasing dendrimer core length, leading to better performance.
Conclusions
Novel triazole based dendritic structures were synthesized through the click and O-alkylation approaches. In addition, optical, electrochemical and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) studies indicate better performance for higher generation dendrimers. Optical, electrochemical and DSSC studies revealed that the enhancement of triazole and ester moieties in the dendritic structures significantly alter their behaviors. Furthermore, as the number of triazole units increases in dendrimers of higher generation the DSSC performance also increases.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Chemicals and solvents (AR quality) were used as received without any further purification. All melting points are uncorrected. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on BRUKER 300 MHz instruments. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as solvent. Tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard. Matric-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-light (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager De-Pro mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer CHNS 2400 instrument. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (ACME, 100–200 mesh). Routine monitoring of the reaction was made using thin layer chromatography developed on glass plates coated with silica gel-G (ACME) of 25 mm thickness and visualized with iodine. The UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 260 spectrophotometer.
General procedure (A) for dye-sensitized solar cell studies
The TiO2 photoelectrode was prepared as described earlier.31 The N3 dye was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface by soaking the TiO2 photoelectrode in an ethanol solution of the N3 dye (5 × 10−5 M concentration) for 24 h at room temperature. The photoelectrode was washed dried and immediately used for the measurement of solar cell performance. A sandwich type photoelectrochemical cell was composed of a dye-coated TiO2 photoanode. Platinum coated fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass act as a counter electrode. The electrolyte solution was injected into the space between two electrodes. The electrolyte solution was composed of 3.2 × 10−5 M of KI, 4.1 × 10−6 M of I2, and the dendrimer of 6.4 × 10−6 M additives in 10 mL DMF solvent. The solar to electric energy conversion efficiency was measured under simulated solar light at 40 mW cm−2. The photocurrent-photovoltage was measured using a BAS 100A electrochemical analyzer. The apparent cell area of TiO2 photoelectrode was 1 cm2 (1 cm × 1 cm).
General procedure (B) for electrochemical studies
Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed in a conventional three electrode system on CHI model 1100A series electro chemical analyzer (CH Instrument, USA). Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was used as the working electrode with Pt foil (large surface area) and a silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Prior to each electrochemical experiment, this GCE was mechanically polished with 0.05 micron alumina powder and cleaned in 1:1 acetone–ethanol mixture in an ultrasonic bath to remove impurities, rinsed with water and then dried in air. Then the electrode was cleaned by cycling between the potentials of −1.6 to +0.6 V versusAgCl in 1 × 10−5 M of tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in DMSO at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 for approximately 30 min until reproducible scans were recorded. All the electrochemical experiments were performed in a quiescent solution at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C).
