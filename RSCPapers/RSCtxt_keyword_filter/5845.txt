    , Accepted 30th January 2018First published on 31st January 2018AbstractWide bandgap conjugated polymers are important for providing complementary absorption with the state-of-the-art narrow bandgap nonfullerene electron acceptors to maximise the utilization of solar photons. In this work, two wide bandgap two-dimensional conjugated polymers, PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz, based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran building block were designed and synthesized. The optical bandgaps of PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz were found to be 1.90 eV and 1.85 eV, respectively. PBDFF–Bz with 2-ethylhexylfuryl side chains possesses the lower HOMO energy level and shows denser π–π stacking compared to PBDFT–Bz with 2-ethylhexylthienyl side chains. The fullerene-free PBDFF–Bz:ITIC-based polymer solar cell (PSC) showed a PCE of 9.46% with a Jsc of 15.02 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.94 V and a FF of 67%; by using m-ITIC as an electron acceptor, the PCE was further improved to 10.28% with an enhanced Jsc of 16.57 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.94 V and a FF of 66%. Under the same condition, the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC device gave a PCE of 9.84% with a Jsc of 16.63 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V and a FF of 70%. In addition, it is exciting that the PBDFF–Bz based devices show a small energy loss (Eloss) of 0.63 eV, while the PBDFT–Bz based devices show an Eloss of 0.72 eV. These results are among the best for fullerene-free devices with BDF-based polymers, and demonstrate that BDF is a very promising candidate for highly efficient polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved significant advancements in the past decade.1–4 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have rapidly increased to over 13% for binary PSCs5 and exceeded 14% for ternary PSCs6 with the rapid development of new materials and continuous innovations of the device engineering. In particular, the design of new materials plays the decisive role in pursuing higher PCEs for PSCs. Among the newly emerged materials, the success of non-fullerene acceptors in PSCs in recent years has provided a great opportunity to pursue the promising photovoltaic performances for practical applications. Currently, the PCEs of the fullerene-free PSCs have reached over 13%, which is comparable to or even higher than that of its PC71BM-based counterparts.5,7 To date, various non-fullerene acceptors, such as NDI-, PDI- and IDT-based small molecules or polymers, have been designed and developed for PSCs with impressive device performances.8,9 However, compared with the rapid development of efficient non-fullerene acceptors, the highly efficient donor polymers are mainly limited to polymers such as PTB7,10 PTB7-Th,11 PBDT-TS1 (ref. 12), PffBT4T-2OD,13etc. Furthermore, current high performance nonfullerene acceptors are mostly from the A–D–A type of small molecule, such as ITIC, m-ITIC and IEIC, with narrow bandgaps of ∼1.50 eV and main absorption bands of 600–800 nm, which have a large overlap in the absorption range with the above highly efficient donor polymers. It is well known that an ideal active layer containing the donor and acceptor blend should possess a complementary absorption, so as to maximise the utilization of solar photons. For instance, the ITIC or m-ITIC acceptors, with absorption at a longer wavelength region, will require a wide bandgap donor polymer with a strong absorption at the shorter wavelength region to avoid interference upon absorbing sunlight. Therefore, in pursuing highly efficient fullerene-free PSCs, the development of wide bandgap polymer donors has become one of the most important strategies, and they are highly demanded to harvest solar photons efficiently. For example, Yan et al. reported that the wide bandgap copolymer PffT2-FTAZ-2DT, with a band-gap of 1.91 eV, showed a good complementary absorption with IEIC and provided a PCE of 7.3%.14 Li and Zhang et al. have also synthesized a series of wide bandgap copolymers based on BDT and difluorobenzotriazole (Bz), i.e. PBDTT–Bz (J52),15 J60,15 J61,15 J71,16 J91 (ref. 17) etc., with bandgaps of ∼1.8–2.0 eV, and they exhibited PCEs of up to 11% with ITIC or m-ITIC as the electron acceptors.
Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF), a furan-based derivative, has recently received considerable attention in the developments of conjugated polymers for PSCs. Compared with the BDT unit, the furan-based BDF possesses the advantages of (i) a more planar structure due to the smaller size of oxygen in the furan unit;18 (ii) a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level due to the strong electronegativity of the oxygen atom;19 (iii) a denser π–π stacking behavior.20 In addition, the furan unit is also available from biorenewable sources with a low cost.21,22 However, the number of available polymers and the device performances of the current BDF-based polymers for PSCs still largely lag behind their BDT-based counterparts. For example, Beaujuge et al. developed the one-dimensional (1D) BDF-based polymer PBDFTPD with a best PCE of 7.4%.23 Sun et al. designed and synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) BDF polymer, PBDF-T1, which showed a promising PCE of 9.43%.24
To further utilise BDF-based polymers for PSCs, herein, we designed and synthesized two wide bandgap 2D polymers, PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz (Fig. 1), with 4,8-bis-(5-(2′-ethylhexylthien-2-yl))benzodifuran (BDFT) and 4,8-bis-(5-(2′-ethylhexylfuran-2-yl)benzodifuran) (BDFF) as the donor units, respectively, and fluorobenzotriazole (Bz) as the acceptor unit. The optical bandgaps of PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz were measured to be 1.90 eV and 1.85 eV, respectively. Also, we found that PBDFF–Bz possesses a lower HOMO energy level and stronger π–π stacking than PBDFT–Bz. The photovoltaic performances of both polymers were investigated for their use in fullerene-free PSCs, with ITIC or m-ITIC as the electron acceptor. The fullerene-free PSCs based on PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC showed a PCE of 9.84% with a high Jsc of 16.63 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V and a FF of 70%. With the advantageous properties of PBDFF–Bz, the PCE of the fullerene-free PSC based on PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC was further improved to 10.28% with a Jsc of 16.57 mA cm−2, a Voc as high as 0.94 V and a FF of 66%, which is very competitive with the BDT-based counterparts. The energy losses of the PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz-based devices were 0.72 eV and 0.63 eV, respectively. The optimized PBDFF–Bz-based device is among the best devices with a Voc of over 0.9 V and a PCE of more than 10%. The results demonstrate that these BDF-based polymers are very promising candidates for highly efficient polymer solar cells.

Discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers are depicted in Scheme 1. The BDFT and BDFF units were synthesized using the common method from 2-(2′-ethylhexyl)thiophene and 2-(2′-ethylhexyl)furan, respectively.25–27 The procedures for synthesizing the distannyl monomers 2,6-bis(trimethylstannane)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDFT-T) and 2,6-bis (trimethylstannane)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)furan)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDFF-T) are displayed in the experimental section. The monomer 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,5-dihydro-2H-benzo-[d][1,2,3]triazole (Bz-Br) was prepared by following the literature procedure.15 Finally, PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz were synthesized via the palladium-catalyzed Stille polycondensation of BDFT-T or BDFF-T with Bz-Br. The obtained polymers were precipitated in methanol and then purified by Soxhlet extraction to remove the impurities and oligomers. Both polymers could be easily dissolved into chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene at room temperature, which makes them easy to use for the solution process. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as a standard and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 180 °C. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of the polymers were 30.2 kDa and 27.5 kDa for PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz, respectively, with polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 1.85 and 2.45 (Table 1). Thermogravimetric analysis shows that both polymers possess good thermal stability with a 5% weight-loss temperature of around 385 °C under an N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1†).

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDFT–Bz, PBDFF–Bz, ITIC and m-ITIC in the film state are displayed in Fig. 2a, and the absorption spectra of PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz in chlorobenzene solution are shown in Fig. S2.† As displayed in Fig. 2a, it can be seen that PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz show a similar absorption profile with a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the BDF and Bz units at a longer wavelength. The well-defined 0–1 and 0–0 absorption peaks of PBDFT–Bz are observed at 558 nm and 605 nm, whereas the two absorption peaks of PBDFF–Bz are red-shifted to 566 nm and 612 nm, respectively. The slight bathochromic shift in the PBDFF–Bz film is mainly ascribed to the better coplanarity of BDFF unit than that of BDFT unit in PBDFT–Bz, which is because of the smaller torsion angle of the alkylfuryl side chain to the BDF backbone for BDFF than that of the alkylthienyl side chain to the BDF backbone for BDFT. The above phenomenon has also been proven by DFT calculations (Fig. S3†) and observed in other BDF-based copolymers.28 PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz show in the film state absorption edges at 651 nm and 671 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.90 eV and 1.85 eV, which match well with the non-fullerene small molecular acceptors ITIC or m-ITIC (∼1.50 eV) as discussed above. Fig. 2a also shows the absorption spectra of ITIC and m-ITIC, and it could be found that the absorption of PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz complements that of ITIC or m-ITIC well, which covers most solar photons from 400 to 800 nm and will be more favorable to enhance the Jsc of PSCs.

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electrochemical properties of both polymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The CV curves of the two polymers are shown in Fig. S4.† The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated according to the equation EHOMO = −e(Vox + 4.8 − Vferro) and ELUMO = −e(Vred + 4.8 − Vferro),29 respectively, where Vox and Vred are the onset of the oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymers in the film state versus Ag/AgCl, and Vferro is the deviation potential of FeCp2. Therefore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are calculated to be −5.35 eV and −3.29 eV for PBDFT–Bz, and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDFF–Bz are downshifted to −5.48 eV and −3.48 eV, respectively, as a result of the strong electronegativity of the alkylfuryl side chain. The HOMO energy levels of both PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz are ca. 0.14–0.27 eV lower than that of their BDT counterpart, PBDTT–Bz (J52) (EHOMO = −5.21 eV).15 It is well known that the open-circuit voltage of PSCs is directly dependent on the HOMO energy level of the donor when fabricating PSCs using the same acceptor. Therefore, it is expected that the lower-lying HOMO energy levels of PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz than that of PBDTT–Bz (J52) will result in a higher Voc in the PSCs. Fig. 2b shows the energy level diagrams of PBDFT–Bz, PBDFF–Bz, ITIC and m-ITIC. As shown in Fig. 2b, the LUMO energy offsets between the two polymers and ITIC/m-ITIC are ∼0.34–0.57 eV, which could be enough to provide the driving force for efficient exciton dissociation.30 It is interesting that the HOMO energy offsets between the two polymers and ITIC/m-ITIC are found to be only ∼0.04–0.19 eV, which is not usually thought to be enough for exciton dissociation in fullerene-based PSCs. However, recent studies have shown that small and even approximately zero HOMO energy offsets in fullerene-free PSCs are still able to facilitate exciton dissociation efficiently.31–35 Most importantly, as displayed in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. S5†) of the neat polymer films, they show broad and strong emission in the range of 550–850 nm when excited at 550 nm. However, the emission of polymer:m-ITIC blend films was totally quenched, indicating an effective electron transfer from PBDFF–Bz or PBDFT–Bz to m-ITIC.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performances of PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz were investigated with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC or m-ITIC/PFN/Al. The optimized donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio was 1:1.5 with a polymer concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. The detailed device fabrication is listed in the ESI.†
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, are shown in Fig. 3a. The corresponding photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 2. It can see that the device based on PBDFT–Bz and ITIC (1:1.5, w/w) obtained a PCE of 9.26% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 15.56 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70%, which is much higher than the PCE of 5.18% for its BDT counterpart based device, PBDTT–Bz (J52):ITIC, under its optimised conditions.15 As displayed in Table 2, the obvious advantage of the PBDFT–Bz:ITIC based device is its higher Voc than that of the PBDTT–Bz (J52):ITIC based device, which is due to the low EHOMO value of PBDFT–Bz. In addition, the EHOMO of PBDFF–Bz is much lower than that of PBDTT–Bz (J52), therefore it can be found that the Voc of the PBDFF–Bz:ITIC based device is further improved to 0.94 V. The PCE of the PBDFF–Bz:ITIC device reaches 9.46% with a Jsc of 15.02 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67%.

It has been demonstrated that m-ITIC, an analogue of the acceptor ITIC, possesses a higher film absorption coefficient, larger crystalline coherence and higher charge carrier mobility,36 which were expected to contribute to a higher Jsc and result in a higher PCE for the PSCs. As expected, the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC based device, fabricated under the same condition as that for the best device based on PBDFT–Bz:ITIC, exhibited a better PCE of 9.84% with an enhanced Jsc of 16.63 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V and a FF of 70%. More excitingly, for the PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC based device a very promising PCE of as high as 10.28% with an improved Jsc of 16.57 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.94 V and a FF of 66% was achieved. It is notable that the significant improvements of the m-ITIC based devices mainly resulted from the increased Jsc compared to that of the ITIC-based devices, which was consistent with the physicochemical properties of m-ITIC. It is also notable that the performances of the ITIC- and m-ITIC-based devices for both polymers were significantly higher than that of their BDT counterpart PBDTT–Bz (J52) (Table 2), which indicates that polymers based on BDF and difluorobenzotriazole possess great potential for applications in the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the ITIC- and m-ITIC-based devices for both polymers under the best condition are shown in Fig. 3b. As shown in Fig. 3b, owing to the complementary absorption of the polymer donor (PBDFT–Bz or PBDFF–Bz) with the acceptor (ITIC or m-ITIC), broad EQE spectra from 300 to 800 nm could be clearly observed with a maximum value of 67.25–75.53%, which demonstrates the highly efficient photon harvesting and charge collection in the active layers. Meanwhile, the broad and strong EQE spectra of all the devices indicate that both the polymer donor and acceptor in each device make contributions to the overall current. In particular, an EQE value of more than 60% between 550 nm and 750 nm demonstrates that the exciton is effectively dissociated between the interfaces, even though there is a smaller HOMO energy offset between the polymer donors and acceptors. The calculated Jsc values, by integrating the EQE curve with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum, are 15.41 and 15.97 mA cm−2 for the PBDFT–Bz:ITIC and PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC based devices, respectively, whereas, the calculated Jsc values are found to be 14.76 and 15.81 mA cm−2 for the PBDFF–Bz:ITIC and PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC-based devices, respectively. The calculated and observed higher Jsc values of the m-ITIC devices are attributed to the higher film absorption coefficient and higher charge carrier mobility of m-ITIC than those of ITIC. It is also notable that the PBDFF–Bz devices with either ITIC or m-ITIC acceptors possess a slightly lower Jsc than PBDFT–Bz, which is partly ascribed to the lower hole mobility of PBDFF–Bz based devices. The hole mobility was measured using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a hole-only diode architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoOx/Ag. The results demonstrated a hole mobility (μh) of 0.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC based device, while the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC based device gave a higher μh of 2.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S6†).
It is well known that there is a trade-off between Jsc and Voc when pursuing higher PCEs, and minimizing the photon energy loss (Eloss) is one of the critical issues to further improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The Eloss is defined as Eloss = Eg − eVoc,37 and is usually greater than 0.7 eV in PSCs.38Fig. 3c and d show the Eloss against Voc and PCE against Eloss from the reported BDT (or BDF)–alt–Bz based devices in comparison with the PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz based devices with either ITIC or m-ITIC as the acceptor; the corresponding data are summarized in Table S1.† The Eloss of the PBDFT–Bz device is calculated to be 0.72 eV, while the PBDFF–Bz device has an Eloss of 0.63 eV. More excitingly, as seen from Fig. 3c and d, it can be found that the PBDFF–Bz based device is among the best devices with a high Voc of over 0.9 V and a PCE of more than 10% with a smaller Eloss. This result demonstrates that side chain engineering, through replacing alkylfuryl with alkylthienyl side chain, provides a facile strategy to decrease Eloss for the fabrication of highly efficient polymer solar cells.
The morphologies of the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC and PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC blend films were investigated by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM and TEM images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the blend film of PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC presents a uniform and smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.68 nm. Meanwhile, a relatively coarse surface with a RMS roughness of 2.32 nm is found for the PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC blend film, indicating that PBDFF–Bz and m-ITIC possess relatively worse miscibilities in comparison with those of PBDFT–Bz and m-ITIC, which should be due to the relatively denser stacking behavior of PBDFF–Bz than that of PBDFT–Bz (Fig. S7†). The TEM images (Fig. 4c and f) of the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC and PBDFFT–Bz:m-ITIC blend films show similar well-distributed interpenetrated nanofibrillar structures, which are beneficial for achieving high Jsc and FF values,39,40 which matches the results of the J–V measurement well.

The intermolecular orientations and nanostructural orders of the polymer:m-ITIC blend films were investigated using grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. 5 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns (a and b) and corresponding 1D cuts (c and d) along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions of the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC (a and c) and PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC (b and d) blend films. As displayed in Fig. 5, the blend films of PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC and PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC present identical 2D GIWAXS patterns and profiles, in which stronger diffraction peaks for π–π stacking at q = 1.89 Å−1 (d = 3.32 Å) and 1.87 Å−1 (d = 3.36 Å) in the out-of-plane direction were observed for the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC and PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC blend films, respectively. Besides, four lamellar peaks at q (0.31–1.45 Å−1) were also found in the out-of-plane direction for PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC and PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC blend films. It can be found that both polymer:m-ITIC blend films show very similar intermolecular orientations and nanostructural orders with a preferred face-on orientation. Even though both the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC and PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC-based films exhibited strong crystallinity and π–π stacking, the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC-based film had a smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.32 Å compared to that of PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC (3.36 Å), which may be consistent with the observed higher hole mobility of the PBDFT–Bz:m-ITIC-based film.

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two novel wide bandgap 2D polymers, PBDFT–Bz and PBDFF–Bz, with 4,8-bis-(5-(2′-ethylhexylthien-2-yl))benzodifuran and 4,8-bis-(5-(2′-ethylhexylfuran-2-yl)benzodifuran) as the donor units, respectively. The optical and electrochemical properties of both polymers were investigated, and it was found that PBDFF–Bz possesses a slightly red-shifted absorption and the lower HOMO energy level. XRD and GIWAXS measurements were also used to study the packing behaviors of the polymer chains. The fullerene-free PSCs of both polymers with ITIC or m-ITIC as the electron acceptors were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performances. The fullerene-free PSCs based on PBDFT–Bz:ITIC or m-ITIC showed a PCE of 9.26% and 9.84%, respectively, with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 15.56 and 16.63 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70%. The PCE of the PBDFF–Bz:ITIC-based device was found to be 9.46%, however, the PCE of PBDFF–Bz:m-ITIC was further improved to 10.28%, with a Jsc of 16.57 mA cm−2, a Voc of as high as 0.94 V and a FF of 66%, as the result of the stronger absorption and better charge carrier mobility of m-ITIC compared to that of ITIC. These promising photovoltaic performances are very competitive with those of their BDT counterparts. The results demonstrate that these furan-based BDF polymers would be very promising polymers for PSCs with rational molecular designs.
