    , Accepted 18th January 2023First published on 20th January 2023AbstractThe combination of clean energy storage and reducing CO2 emissions is an effective strategy to meet the growing energy demands and achieve a sustainable route. Consequently, Li–CO2 batteries have received extensive attention, which is ascribed to their dual functions of energy storage and CO2 capture. Nevertheless, the development and utilization of Li–CO2 batteries are still in their infancy and face considerable challenges, such as high polarization, cathode inactivation, and environmental sensitivity. Thus, it is necessary to fully understand the reaction mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries, explore the catalytic capabilities, crucial functions and influencing factors of various catalytic cathodes, and formulate corresponding modification measures to achieve high-performance Li–CO2 batteries. In this review, we systematically introduce the electrochemical reaction mechanism of O2-involved, H2O-involved and pure Li–CO2 batteries, and then systematically introduce the latest research progress of transition metal-based catalysts, including their composition and structure, and the corresponding effects on their electrochemical performance. Based on a comprehensive overview of the current research progress, we present perspectives and directions for the exploration of Li–CO2 batteries and further provide guidance for the future development and practical utilization of Li–CO2 batteries.

Broader context
The excessive use of fossil fuels, massive release of industrial waste gas, and the continuous massive emission of CO2 have triggered severe environmental problems and threaten human life. Consequently, enhancing CO2 capture and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions are facile strategies to achieve carbon neutrality. Rechargeable Li–CO2 batteries have attracted considerable attention as they can promote the capture, utilization, and conversion of CO2 to electric energy. This review systematically summarizes the development history of Li–CO2 batteries and deeply analyzes the chemical/electrochemical reaction mechanisms of O2-involved Li–CO2 batteries and pure Li–CO2 batteries. Additionally, the challenges, available solutions and strategies of as-reported transition metal-based catalysts are highlighted. Based on the comprehensive overview of the current research progress, valuable proposals are presented from the perspective of battery composition (anode, cathode, and electrolyte) and advanced characterization methods, providing valuable insights and profitable guidance for future mechanism exploration and practical development of transition metal-based catalysts in Li–CO2 batteries.

1. Introduction
The excessive dependence on traditional fossil fuels and the continuous accumulation of greenhouse gases (CO2) have induced intractable environment problems and thus hindered the green and sustainable development globally.1–4 To date, researchers have been dedicated to preventing severe climate change and storing or converting the CO2 emissions to usable energy and valuable chemicals via simple capture and conversion.5,6 Generally, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is regarded as a potential approach for pursuing a low-carbon economy because it not only can prominently reduce the concentration of CO2, but also convert CO2 into small-molecule fuels and available chemicals (i.e., ethanol and ethylene).7,8 However, the conventional CO2RR systems usually exhibit undesirable energy conversion efficiency due to the complex multi-electron reaction on the cathode surface and endothermic reaction with considerable barrier.9 In contrast, direct electrochemical CO2RR by means of novel energy storage devices is a promising strategy to enhance CO2 capture and improve energy conversion efficiency.
Nowadays, among the new energy storage systems for electrochemical CO2RR, metal–CO2 batteries, such as Na–CO2 batteries, Li–CO2 batteries, and Mg–CO2 batteries, show great potential due to their high energy density, reversible CO2 drive and considerable value-added chemicals.10,11 Particularly, Li–CO2 cells are considered promising candidates for energy storage owing to their comparatively high discharge potential (∼2.8 V), large theoretical energy density (1876 W h kg−1) and superior CO2 fixation/desorption based on the electrochemical reaction of 3CO2 + 4Li ↔ 2Li2CO3 + C.12–14 Additionally, Li–CO2 batteries possess the merits of real-time electricity input, sustainable energy storage/power supply balance, carbon cycling, etc. Thus, they can be potentially utilized in large-scale electric vehicles, long-distance electricity transmission, building and exploration of Mars (Fig. 1). However, the development and application of Li–CO2 batteries still face significant challenges, such as unfixed SEI film, inferior cycling ability, large voltage hysteresis and low Coulombic efficiencies.15–17 Notably, most Li–CO2 batteries have been studied and operated under a pure CO2 atmosphere thus far. Also, the corresponding electrochemical reaction processes are relatively simple compared to that of Li–air batteries, only involving the chemical and electrochemical CO2RR on the cathode surface.18 However, contact with air (O2 and H2O) is unavoidable in the practical application of Li–CO2 batteries. Moreover, various and complex multi-electron reactions and electrochemical/chemical reactions of Li–H2O, Li–O2 and Li–CO2 proceed on the surface of the cathode.19,20 Therefore, it is of great significant to understand the electrochemical/chemical reaction processes in O2-involved, H2O-involved and pure Li–CO2 batteries, and also design the corresponding energy storage devices in the future.

In 2011, Takechi's team first proposed a primary Li–CO2/O2 battery and found that the appropriate introduction of CO2 could dramatically improve the discharge capacity compared to Li–O2 cells. Furthermore, the discharge product of the Li–CO2/O2 battery has been identified as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) rather than Li2O2 (2Li+ + 2e− + O2 ↔ Li2O2).21 Subsequently, in 2013, Xu et al. reported a new primitive Li–CO2 battery with commercial conductive carbon as the cathode and ionic liquid as the electrolyte to realize the fixation and conversion of CO2 under a pure CO2 atmosphere.22 In 2014, Liu et al. used a mixture of 90% Ketjenblack (KB) and 10% Polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) dripped on stainless steel mesh as a cathode, and found that Li2CO3 and carbon were the major discharge products in a pure CO2 atmosphere. This work made great progress in realizing the first rechargeable Li–CO2 battery.23 However, as the primary discharge product in Li–CO2 batteries, Li2CO3 is an insulator, which is thermodynamically stable and requires a higher voltage to be decomposed than Li2O2. These characteristics result in an undesirable ohmic overpotential and sluggish kinetics.24,25 Additionally, the incomplete decomposition of Li2CO3 and the accumulation of side-reactive derivatives on the cathode surface will cause a large activation overpotential and IR drop, and even unexpected battery death after electrochemical operation.26,27 Thus, to address the aforementioned issues, researchers have mainly focused on designing high-performing cathode catalysts to reduce the large overpotential gap and improve the energy efficiency and the cycle life of Li–CO2 batteries.28,29 At present, most of the common cathode catalysts in Li–CO2 batteries are noble metal catalysts,30–32 carbon-based catalysts33 and their derivatives.34 However, although noble metal catalysts exhibit excellent electrochemical activity and catalytic stability, their high price, chemical vulnerability and low reserves limit their large-scale applications.35 Alternatively, carbon-based catalysts have attractive advantages such as low cost, high abundance, and tunable morphology and structure, but their unsatisfactory catalytic activity and stability limit their development.36 Therefore, researchers are devoted to selecting and optimizing abundant, highly active, and durable transition metal catalysts to enhance the catalytic performance of Li–CO2 batteries.
Herein, we focus on elucidating the recent progress of transition metal catalysts in Li–CO2 batteries in detail. Firstly, the reaction mechanism of O2-involved, H2O-involved and pure Li–CO2 cells are discussed. Importantly, this review presents an exhaustive overview of the latest progresses in the design and development of various transition metal catalysts. Secondly, we also present some possible controversies, valuable challenges and probable improvements in the current feasible Li–CO2 batteries, which will be beneficial for understanding and exploring the usability of Li–CO2 batteries in future energy storage systems.
2. Electrochemical reaction mechanisms of Li–CO2 batteries
The in-depth understanding of the electrochemical catalytic reaction mechanism is the basis for the design and preparation of highly active and stable Li–CO2 batteries for commercialization. Although the development history of Li–CO2 cells is relatively short, the research on their electrochemical reaction mechanism has made considerable progress. The electrochemical reaction of CO2 on the catalytic cathode is very complex, involving multiple bulk phases of catalyst, electrolyte, CO2 gas and reaction products, as well as multiple interfacial reactions between gas–solid, liquid–solid and gas–liquid. Initially, Li–CO2 cells with discharge capability were found while operating rechargeable Li–O2 batteries in O2/CO2 mixtures. In addition, due to the presence of a small amount of H2O (0.03%) in the air, the discharge reaction of H2O-involved Li–CO2 batteries cannot be ignored. Therefore, initially, we elaborate on the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the cathode in O2/CO2 mixtures. Then, the discharge reaction of H2O-involved Li–CO2 batteries is revealed, and finally, the charge and discharge mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries in a pure CO2 atmosphere is systematically discussed.
2.1. Discharge mechanism of O2-involved Li–CO2 cells
Takechi's group first reported and proposed the effect of CO2 and O2 mixtures at different ratios on Li–CO2/O2 batteries in 2011.21 They found that an Li–CO2/O2 cell delivered a maximum discharge capacity three-times that of a pure Li–O2 battery when the concentration of CO2 and O2 in the mixture were the same. Impressively, the discharge voltage plateau in these O2-involved Li–CO2 cells was essentially the same as that in Li–O2 batteries, and thus they hypothesized that in the presence of O2, the air electrode captures electrons and reduces them to superoxide radicals (O2*−) species, as shown in eqn (1). Subsequently, the strongly nucleophilic O2*− species can easily combine with CO2 molecules to form CO4*− through a nucleophilic addition reaction, which is related to the activation of CO2 and controls the reaction rate of Li–CO2/O2 batteries, as shown in eqn (2). Eqn (3)–(5) show the process of forming Li2CO3 precipitation, which is the self-perfection of the reaction between O2*− species with CO2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis (Fig. 2a) showed that the discharge product of the Li–CO2/O2 battery is Li2CO3 instead of Li2O or Li2O2, which proved the validity of this hypothesis.21 Notably, this work employed a carbonate-based electrolyte (CBE) made of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) dissolved in a mixture of diethyl carbonate and ethylene carbonate, rather than the conventional CBEs, which are most susceptible to attack from the O2*− species, leading to serious side effects and making it difficult to generate Li2CO3. 4O2 + 4e− → 4O2*−(1) O2*− + CO2 → CO4*−(2) CO4*− + CO2 → C2O6*−(3) C2O6*− + O2*− → O2 + C2O62−(4) C2O62− + 2O2*− + 4Li+ → 2O2 + 2Li2CO3(5)

Although this hypothesis ignored the role of Li+ in the reaction and its influence on different electrolyte solvents in Li–CO2/O2 batteries, this pioneering work provided a gateway for future exploration and research into attractive Li–CO2 batteries.
Afterwards, Gowda et al. employed the stable dimethoxyethane (DME) as the electrolyte solvent to investigate the discharge mechanism of Li–CO2/O2 batteries and demonstrated that the hybrid cathode operation could improve the discharge capacity.37 Interestingly, the discharge products of Li2O2 were also found to stable Li2CO3 (Fig. 2b). Therefore, they hypothesized that Li2O2 can be formed in the presence of O2 by a 2e−/O2 process (eqn (6)), while Li2CO3 is formed through the interaction of CO2 with the product of Li2O2 (eqn (7)). O2 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li2O2(6) 2CO2 + 2Li2O2 → 2Li2CO3 + O2(7)
In 2013, Lim and co-workers proposed that the discharge mechanism in CO2/O2 batteries is intimately related to the dielectric properties of the electrolyte solvents.38 Based on theoretical computational simulations and experimental verifications, they found that the electrochemical reduction step of O2 to O2*− species is independent of the electrolyte solvent (eqn (1)). Notably, in low dielectric electrolytes, the O2*− species preferentially react with free Li+ to form LiO2 due to its low polarizability. Alternatively, in high dielectric electrolytes, it is difficult for O2*− species to react with Li+ due to the obstruction of the mechanism, preferentially capturing CO2 to generate CO4− (Fig. 2c). Therefore, they proposed that Li2CO3 with a high formation energy may be formed in a high-dielectric (dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)) electrolyte, while Li2O2 is formed in a low-dielectric electrolyte (DME).38 Additionally, they further proposed that activation of CO2 in a high-dielectric electrolyte can improve the cycling reversibility of Li2CO3, endowing it better reversibility than that in Li–O2 batteries. In 2017, Tarasco et al. investigated the effect of using the same aprotic solvents (DMSO and DME) on the discharge performance in Li–CO2/O2 batteries in detail.39 They proposed that regardless of DMSO or DME medium, the discharge product of the reaction between O2*− species and CO2 is Li2CO3, while the reaction process is different. In addition, the discharge reaction paths of the Li–CO2/O2 battery are only dependent on the donor number (DN), rather than the dielectric properties of the electrolyte. In 2018, Zhou's group reported the use of a high-concentration polymer electrolyte composed of DMSO and solvated tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAClO4) contact ion pair to prevent the performance degradation, which was caused by the interaction between Li+ and the metastable intermediates of conventional Li–CO2/O2 batteries.40 They found that the fluid network in the polymer electrolyte converted the conventional CO42− to C2O62−, and thus effectively lowered the charge potential. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) revealed that the strong discharge signal of CO42−, C2O62− metastable intermediates and the final product O2 were continuously detected on the Au electrode surface during the discharge process (Fig. 2d). In addition, they proposed that the C2O62− reaction path can be stabilized by enhancing the volume ratio of CO2 in a gas mixture (eqn (8)).40 Notably, although the formation of intermediates was observed, the authors did not consider the effect of Li+-free electrolyte solutions on battery life, and thus the detailed reaction pathway in Li–CO2/O2 batteries remains unclear. C2O62− → 2CO2 + O2 + 2e−(8)
To further understand the effect of solvent properties on the discharge reaction paths in Li–CO2/O2 batteries, Zhao et al. conducted an investigation on the electrochemical and chemical similarities using acetonitrile (ε = 38.8 and DN = 14) and DMSO (ε = 47.2 and DN = 30) solvents with similar dielectric constants but different DN in 2019.41 The SERS and TFIR spectra showed that the formation of the thermally stable Li2CO3 was mainly dependent on the donor number of the solvent rather than the high or low strength of the medium in the solvent. In addition, the solvent with a high DN number was a major factor for the conversion of the C2O62− key intermediate to stable Li2CO3, as shown in eqn (9) and (10). A trace amount of O2 diffused on the surface of the catalytic electrode, which activated and captured CO2 molecules to form C2O62−, and finally slowly formed the stable Li2CO3, thereby enhancing the discharge capacity of the Li–CO2/O2 battery and slowing down its sudden death.11 However, in a solvent with a low DN, the surface of the catalytic electrode involved the chemical surface pathway of Li2CO3 formed by CO2 and Li2O2, while it was difficult for the trace amount of O2 to act as a pillar. In particular, the relatively stable Li2CO3 was formed as the final discharge product in the Li–CO2/O2 batteries, despite the fact that different electrochemical mechanisms were obtained by combining different intermediates in low-DN and high-DN-number solvents. 2CO2 + 2O2*− → C2O62− + O2(9) C2O62− + 4Li+ + 2O2*− → 2Li2CO3 + 2O2(10)
In 2021, Wang et al. used the LiTFSI and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidine bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) (Pry14TFSI) ionic liquids as the electrolyte to monitor the discharge evolution of O2-involved Li–CO2 batteries in real-time using synchrotron-based in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS).42 Between them, Pry14TFSI could significantly strengthen the free Li+ and reduce the direct reaction of Li+ with these intermediates in eqn (2)–(4). When the cell was discharged from 2.8 V (OCV) to 1.3 V, the appearance of amorphous carbon, Li2O (529.5 eV) and Li2O2 (531 eV) was observed by in situ APXPS with an accompanying increase in intensity (Fig. 2e). Additionally, the Li 1s peak position gradually shifted to a lower binding energy, and the Li+ ambient concentration decreased, implying the formation of Li2O and Li2O2 species, as shown in eqn (6) and (11), respectively.42 Impressively, after the Li–CO2/O2 batteries were fully discharged, no signal of Li2CO3 was detected, but a mixture of C, Li2O and Li2O2 was formed, as shown in eqn (12). This was another important milestone in the development of Li–CO2. Li2O2 + 2e− + 2Li+ → 2Li2O(11) O2 + CO2 + 6Li+ + 6e− → C + 2Li2O + Li2O2(12)
Although the aforementioned viewpoints can offer powerful support for the reaction mechanism of Li–CO2/O2 batteries, their rather complex reaction pathways remain highly controversial due to the failure to consider the cycle life of metastable intermediates and the lack of in situ characterization to directly demonstrate the existence of these intermediates. In short, the current understanding of the complex reaction routes in Li–CO2/O2 batteries is not deep enough, and thus continuous exploration and research are still required. We summarize the possible reaction routes in O2-involved Li–CO2 cells in Fig. 3.

2.2. Discharge mechanism of H2O-involved Li–CO2 cells
It is well known that H2O is the most common proton donor for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in the aqueous phase, which facilitates the reduction of CO2 from air to value-added fuels and chemicals, such as methane and methanol. In addition, H2O, as an important component of air, inevitably contacts the catalyst on the air cathode, but its effect on the cathode interface is still unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to study the electrochemical mechanism of H2O-involved Li–CO2 batteries for their future commercial application. To elucidate the role of H2O in the CO2RR kinetics, Wang et al. used a porous carbon layer (Super P) as the cathode in 2021 to investigate the discharge changes in H2O-involved Li–CO2 batteries using in situ APXPS.42 It was found that when the voltage was discharged from 1.7 V to 1.2 V, compared with the pure CO2 without a signal, the H2O-involved Li–CO2 battery presented an sp2-hybridized amorphous carbon species signal accompanied by the accumulation of a large number of LiOH species (Fig. 4a). This phenomenon is concluded as eqn (13). Furthermore, when the H2O-involved Li–CO2 battery was discharged to 1.0 V, the CO32− species increased significantly, while the LiOH species decreased, leading to a severe decline in battery performance, as shown in eqn (14). Impressively, the amorphous carbon and CO32− species were disproportionate, which can be attributed to the fact that H2O gains electrons and undergoes disproportionation to generate H2, which is prone to spill over, as shown in eqn (15).42 This new finding provided direct evidence for the discharge mechanism of H2O involved in the CO2RR, and also provided new insights for future researchers to study and explore the differences in CO2RR kinetics. CO2 + 2H2O + 4Li+ + 4e− → C + 4LiOH(13) CO2 + 2LiOH → Li2CO3 +H2O(14) 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(15)

2.3. Discharge mechanism of pure Li–CO2 batteries
In 2013, based on the inspiration of Li–CO2/O2 batteries, Xu et al. designed and developed a primary Li–CO2 battery in a high-temperature environment using an ionic liquid (IL) composed of 1 M LiTFSI salt and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolbis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide as the electrolyte.22 They found that the discharge potential of the battery was strongly temperature dependent and positively correlated with an increase in temperature. Nevertheless, the increment in the discharge potential was not monotonic, and the presence of a thermally triggered region in the range of 50–70 °C could induce a significant increase in the discharge potential (Fig. 4b). The equilibrium potential calculated by thermodynamics demonstrates that the CO formed during the discharge process of CO2 and Li dominates the reaction, as shown in eqn (16). However, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) analysis showed the absence of CO gas-phase products and it was believed that C and CO2 were formed through the disproportionation reaction of CO at high temperature, thereby forming the final solid discharge products of C and Li2CO3, as shown in eqn (17) and (18).22 However, although this work demonstrated their catalytic potential, the prepared Li–CO2 batteries were difficult to recharge and discharge again. 2Li + 2CO2 → Li2CO3 + CO(16) 2CO → CO2 + C(17) 4Li + 3CO2 → 2Li2CO3 + C(18)
In 2014, Liu et al. fabricated a rechargeable Li–CO2 battery operating at room temperature using a Ketjenblack (KB) cathode and an electrolyte composed of TEGDME and lithium triflate(LiCF3SO3).23 The existence of Li2CO3 products after the initial discharge and their absence after the subsequent charge were analyzed by XRD. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and SERS were utilized to determine whether the discharge product was amorphous C. Initially, they proposed that the reversible Li–CO2 battery follows the reaction in eqn (18). In 2017, Zhang et al. concluded that the amorphous carbon was in the form of thin films in the discharge products, in which Ni nanoparticles were uniformly anchored to N-doped graphene.43 The reversible consumption and formation of inert CO2 were also confirmed by DEMS. Subsequent work also proved that Li2CO3 and C were the main discharge products in reversible Li–CO2 batteries.44–46
In 2017, Zhou's group systematically studied the electrochemical mechanism of deep discharge and charge of Li–CO2 batteries in aprotic solution and proposed a new strategy of electrochemical CO2RR.47 They used gold sputtering cathodes and 0.5 M LiClO4 in DMSO as the electrolyte and observed that the main discharge product was a mixture of C and Li2CO3via in situ SERS when the discharge platform was 2.5 V. When the CO2 concentration was controlled and the cell was deeply discharged to 1.8 V, an additional signal of Li2O appeared at 520 cm−1 in SERS (Fig. 4c). They proposed a new discharge theory, where Li2O is formed from CO2 and metallic lithium directly participates in the discharge reaction, as described in eqn (19). 4Li+ + 4e− + CO2 → 2Li2O + C(19)
Impressively, Zhou's group also detected the existence of oxalate (C2O42−) as an early metastable intermediate. Combining the aforementioned several discharge mechanisms, a widely supported discharge mechanism for Li–CO2 batteries has been obtained, which is described in detail in eqn (20)–(23).22,23,43,47 In the discharge mechanism, CO2 accepts electrons to form C2O42−, which undergoes disproportionation to generate CO22−, and then reacted to generate highly stable CO32− and C, and finally CO32− combines with free Li+ to form Li2CO3. 2CO2 + 2e− → C2O42−(20) C2O42− → CO22− + CO2(21) C2O42− + CO22− → 2CO32− + C(22) CO32− + 2Li+ → Li2CO3(23)
In 2017, Chen's group applied Mo2C and CNT composites to study the discharge mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries in non-aqueous solution.48 In the presence of Mo2C catalyst, the C2O42− intermediate generated by CO2 gains electrons and stably reacts with Li+ to form lithium oxalate (Li2C2O4) without the further formation of Li2CO3, as depicted in eqn (20) and (24). C2O42− + 2Li+ + Mo2C → Li2C2O4 – Mo2C(24)
In 2018, Khurram et al. investigated chemisorption-mediated CO2 capture and conversion in Li–CO2 cells using 0.1 M CO2-loaded 2-ethanoethylamine (EEA) species dissolved in DMSO as a novel electrolyte.50 They found that CO2 “pre-activated” by adding EEA will form EEA-CO2 adducts (RNHCOO− and RNH3+, R = CH3CH2OCH2CH2-) according to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR characterization). The EEA-CO2 adducts possess high selectivity for Li+ and can perform electron transfer on nitrogen bonds. They found that Li2CO3, C and EEA were present in the discharge products, while RNHCOO− and RNH3+ signals were absent. They speculated that the amine can be involved in an intermediary step in the reaction of Li–CO2 to promote the formation of Li2CO3, as shown by eqn (25). RNHCOO− + RNH3+ + 2CO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → 2Li2CO3 + C + 2RNH2(25)
In 2022, Iputera et al. mentioned that predecessors only observed the discharge products using EELS, XPS and TEM technologies, but could not prove the formation of C in the discharge products.51 Thus, to overcome these issues, they used non-carbon Ag sputtered on stainless steel (SS) as the cathode to probe C formation via soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SXAS). As shown in Fig. 4d, no carbon peaks were found at 285 and 293 eV using SXAS, proving that the discharge products did not contain carbon. In situ Raman and XRD characterizations confirmed the formation of Li2CO3 in the discharge products. The by-products in TEGDME electrolyte after discharge were further investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). New phases of HCOOLi and CH3COOLi were formed in the electrolyte, indicating that CO2− intermediates were generated during the discharge process, as shown in eqn (26).51 The generation of CO was also detected by probing the gas changes before and after the discharge with in situ gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), as shown in Fig. 4e. Therefore, they proposed that the CO2− intermediates were bound to the CO2 molecule to generate a metastable C2O4−, which subsequently reacted with free Li+ and electrons to generate Li2CO3 and CO, as shown in eqn (27) and (28) CO2 + e− → CO2−(26) CO2− + CO2 → C2O4−(27) C2O4− + 2Li+ + e− → Li2CO3 + CO(28)
Afterwards, Peng's group utilized Cu-coated Au (CuML@Au) as the cathode combined with the in situ SERS technique and DFT simulation to study the Li–CO2 electrochemical discharge mechanism.49 When the cell was discharged from the open circuit voltage (OCV) to a potential of 2.5 V, the signals of the CO2− intermediates and as-converted CO were observed (Fig. 4f). Therefore, they proposed that in the CO2RR reaction, CO2 initially receives electrons and reacts with Li+ to form LiCO2, as depicted in eqn (29). When the discharge was reduced to 1.5 V, the formation of Li2CO3 (at 1080 cm−1) and the continuous emergence of CO were accompanied by a decrease in the peak area of CO2−, as shown in eqn (30) and (31), which can be attributed to the passivation of Li2CO3 covered on the CuML@Au surface. In addition, they adopted DFT simulations and confirmed that the formation of LiCO2 and LiCO3 intermediates was favorable for the fixation of CO2 and Li+ in the electrochemical reactions, and the final discharge products were Li2CO3 and CO, as shown in Fig. 4g. The reaction process for CO2 reduction and Li is summarized in eqn (16). Li+ + CO2 + e− → LiCO2(29) LiCO2 + CO2 → LiCO3 + CO(30) LiCO3 + Li+ + e− → Li2CO3(31)
As mentioned above, the CO2RR in the current Li–CO2 batteries is affected by the discharge depth, electrolyte composition, catalyst, O2 and H2O in the environment. To better comprehend the discharge mechanism of CO2 reduction, we summarize the possible chemical and electrochemical reaction mechanisms, thermodynamic reversible potentials of the CO2RR under O2 or H2O participation and pure CO2 environment in Table 1. In addition, there is still considerable controversy regarding the complex CO2RR discharge mechanism in Li–CO2, and thus extensive in situ characterization and theoretical studies are required to further elucidate its catalytic mechanism and intrinsic activity. For example, an in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry gas chromatography coupled system combined with isotope labeling of 13C and 18O was used to quantify the gas evolution in the discharge process and determine the participation and generation of gases during the formation of Li2CO3. Additionally, the degradation mechanism of Li2CO3 and the volatile components formed by electrolyte decomposition could also be examined through the evolution of charge–mass ratio during the electrochemical reaction processes. This was conducive to achieving an in-depth understanding of the gas and product formation mechanism during the discharge process. In situ Raman, infrared and XRD methods were used to determine the intermediates and discharge products during the discharge process and organic fragment formation during the charging process, and thus further understand the current electrolyte consumption and inactivation at high voltage. Furthermore, they could directly observe intermediates and products at different discharge/charge stages, deepening the understanding of the discharge mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries. In combination with in situ TEM and in situ ambient pressure XPS technology, the morphology and composition of the discharge products could be deeply understood, and the products formed by electrochemistry could be qualitatively analyzed. In addition, first-principles calculations could be used to determine the feasible path of the catalyst to reduce the energy barrier during the discharge process from the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. In brief, these in situ characterization techniques combined with theoretical calculations can identify the intermediates and final products for a systematic, in-depth and comprehensive assessment of the electrochemical mechanisms.

2.4. Charge mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries
The charging reaction in an Li–CO2 battery is not just a simple reverse reaction of the CO2RR process. Different metastable intermediates may be generated during the charging process through chemical/electrochemical reactions due to the different catalytic properties from that in the CO2RR process.52,53 Combining the possible discharge products of Li–CO2 batteries in the CO2RR process in Table 1, we summarize the possible transformation forms of pure Li–CO2 batteries in the CO2ER process, as follows: (i) Li2CO3 decomposition; (ii) electrochemical decomposition of C and Li2CO3; (iii) Li2O decomposition and (iv) Li2C2O4 dissociation, and reveal the current energy conversion in Li–CO2 batteries from a clear perspective.

2.4.1 Electrochemical decomposition of Li2CO3. 
Li2CO3, as the most dominant discharge product in Li–CO2 batteries, is thermodynamically stable and a wide-bandgap insulator and requires a quite high charging voltage to decompose (>4.2 V), which will lead to low reversibility, poor cycle performance and Coulombic efficiency in rechargeable Li–CO2 batteries.54,55 Considering the complete decomposition of Li2CO3 during charging can be achieved within a small potential limit and thus the battery can achieve a high electrochemical activity and cycle performance, the mechanism of CO2ER reaction in Li–CO2 batteries has been intensively studied in recent years.
In 2016, Yang et al. proposed three reaction pathways for the complete electrochemical oxidation of Li2CO3 and their associated reversible potentials and Gibbs free energies based on thermodynamic theoretical calculations (Table 2).56 Among them, the reaction route (I) was that Li2CO3 was directly decomposed to O2 and CO2, and the subsequent GC-MS analysis results revealed that no O2 was produced, proving the ineffectiveness of the reaction (I) route. Reaction pathway (II) involved the electrochemical degradation of Li2CO3 and C to generate Li+ and CO2. To prove this hypothesis, the authors artificially added 13C and 12C conductive agents to the Li2CO3 cathode and observed the evolution of CO2 by GC-MS during the charging process. They not only found m/z = 44 and m/z = 45 fragments with nearly equal amounts of evolution, but also m/z = 15, m/z = 58, and m/z = 88 fragments in GC-MS (Fig. 5a). Then, FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 5b) was adopted to confirm that the m/z = 45 fragment was decomposed to organic matter rather than 45CO2. These results proved that C was not involved in the CO2ER and the reaction hypothesis of reaction pathway (II) was not valid. Furthermore, reaction pathway (III) described the decomposition of Li2CO3 to generate O2*−, which attacks the electrolyte during charging to generate products with different chemical structures, as demonstrated by GC-MS (Fig. 5a) and FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 5b). Therefore, they proposed route (III) as the main charging mechanism for Li–CO2 batteries.

Afterwards, the decomposition of Li2CO3 possibly produces O2 or O2*− depending on the kinetic factor (current density) of the charging process. Based on this, Qiao et al. used DEMS to quantitatively observe the gas evolution on the surface of non-carbon Au cathodes at different current densities in 2017.47 They found that the evolution of CO2 gas (charge-to-mass ratio: about 3e−/2CO2) could be observed intuitively at 500 mA g−1, while O2 was not detected at all, as shown in eqn (32) and Fig. 5c. Subsequently, obvious signals of O2 (4e−/O2) and CO2 (2e−/CO2) appeared in the initial stage of the CO2ER as the current density increased to 2000 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 5d, and the decomposition of Li2CO3 is described in eqn (33). 2Li2CO3 → 2CO2 + 4Li+ + 3e− + O2*−(32) 2Li2CO3 → 2CO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− + O2(33)
Oxygen species were shown to be involved in the electrochemical charging studies in previous reports, but it was difficult to determine the form of the existing oxygen even using in situ characterizations. It was generally accepted that O2 is a superoxide radical formed by an undefined parasitic reaction. Nevertheless, convincing experimental evidence for the mechanism was lacking. In 2018, Mahne et al. proposed that the absence of O2 evolution in parasitic reactions was ascribed to the formation of highly reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) from the oxidation of Li2CO3 during the CO2ER process.57 They utilized 9,10-dimethyl anthracene (DMA) as a chemical probe to study the electrochemical oxidation of Li2CO3 and discovered the formation of stoichiometric amounts of 1O2 without other groups or molecules (such as O2*−, O2, CO2, and Li2CO3) during the charging process. Given that DMA only selectively reacted with 1O2, an ultrasensitive chemical signal (DMA-O2) rapidly appeared. When the charge voltage exceeded 3.8 V, the DMA-O2 signal of the Li–CO2 battery in the CO2ER could be rapidly detected by EPR spectroscopy, proving the existence of 1O2. High-performance liquid chromatography and NMR also detected the DMA-O2 signals at above 3.8 V, further confirming the presence of 1O2 during the charging process. Therefore, the decomposition of Li2CO3 follows eqn (34). 2Li2CO3 → 2CO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− + 1O2(34)
Additionally, 1O2 is highly aggressive and binds to the electrolyte, leading to severe parasitic reactions. Therefore, it was necessary to explore suitable 1O2 quenchers (such as 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane (DABCO)57 and DABCO-nium58) to avoid the formation of 1O2 or convert it to the non-aggressive 3O2, thereby achieving stable Li–CO2 reversible cycling.
In 2020, Baek et al. adopted Ru nanoparticles as the cathode and a nitrate-based molten salt as the electrolyte to explore the role of NO2− in the decomposition mechanism of surface Li2CO3 at different temperatures (100 °C and 150 °C).59 They found that Li2CO3 first reacts with NO2− to both activate Li+ and form intermediate [CO3NO2]− at 100 °C. Given that the C and N atoms connected by bridge O atoms are quite unstable, [CO3NO2]− rapidly forms the thermodynamically stable CO2 and NO3−, as shown in eqn (35). Li2CO3 + NO2− → CO2 + 2Li+ + 2e− + NO3−(35)
At 150 °C, the initial reaction between NO2− and Li2CO3 also follows eqn (34). However, NO2− combines with the adjacent CO32− to form the metastable C2O52− due to the increased activity of CO2 at high temperature, as described in eqn (36). 2Li2CO3 + NO2− → C2O52− + 4Li+ + 2e− + NO3−(36)


2.4.2 Electrochemical decomposition of C and Li2CO3. 
There is another completely reversible path in Li–CO2 batteries besides the decomposition of Li2CO3 in the CO2ER process. In 2017, Yang et al. simulated the charging reaction using Ru@Super P as the cathode.60 It was found that the charging potential was reduced to 3.8 V from 4.2 V in the presence of Ru catalyst, and the battery possessed an excellent electrochemical performance (Fig. 5e). In situ SERS analysis was adopted to investigate the charging process, where the signal intensity of Li2CO3 and C gradually decreased and completely disappeared before the end of charging. Subsequently, in situ GC-MS detected the production of CO2. These results revealed that C and Li2CO3 undergo a reversible reaction to form CO2 (eqn (36)) rather than the above-mentioned self-decomposition of Li2CO3. Afterwards, various catalysts such as precious metals,61,62 Ti-based,63 C-based,64,65 Mn-based,66,67 and Ni-based68,69 catalyst had successfully shown that the decomposition of C and Li2CO3 is the main charging reaction in Li–CO2 batteries. 2Li2CO3 + C → 3CO2 + 4Li+ + 4e−(37)
However, the mechanism of C and Li2CO3 consumption in the reaction of CO2ER has still been poorly studied. In 2022, Cao et al. used 1 M LiTFSI-tetraglyme as the electrolyte to quantify the gas evolution during the electrochemical oxidation of Li2CO3 on carbon substrates using isotope labeling and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry-gas chromatography system.70 Initially, they labeled Li213CO3 with 13C isotope and found that Li2CO3 only decomposed into 13CO2 without the formation of CO and O2 through qualitative analysis, which means that carbon does not directly participate in the decomposition of Li2CO3. The DMA probe only reacted with 1O2 to generate a DMA-O2 signal, which confirms that the oxygen in Li2CO3 is released in the form of highly active 1O2. Therefore, the decomposition of Li2CO3 follows eqn (34).
When 13C was used as the carbon substrate, 13CO and 13CO2 were detected when the cell voltage was in the range of 3.82 to 4.2 V. They speculated that the detected 13CO and 13CO2 came from the side reaction of 1O2 attacking the 13C substrate. To elucidate the pathway, they used KO2 powder, which could react easily with the electrolyte to produce 1O2, and mixed with 13C in different proportions. With the addition of the electrolyte, the 1O2 produced by disproportionation immediately oxidizes 13C and produces a mixture of 13CO2 and 13CO in different proportions. Therefore, they proposed that the 1O2 formed from the oxidation of Li2CO3 can quickly attack carbon to form CO2 and CO, as shown in eqn (38). (1 − x/2) 1O2 + C → (1 − x)CO2 + xCO(38)
In addition, when the battery voltage was in the range of 4.3 to 4.7 V, they found that there were also CO2, CO and solid products that were not labeled 13C in addition to 13CO and 13CO2. Therefore, they proposed that a large amount of 1O2 generated at high potential not only can attack the C matrix, but also react with the electrolyte to produce CO2, CO and by-products. This reaction is described in eqn (39). 1O2 + electrolyte → CO2 + CO + byproducts(39)


2.4.3 Electrochemical decomposition of Li2C2O4. 
Previous studies have shown that Li2C2O4 is an intermediate discharge product and amorphous Li2C2O4–Mo2C can be stably generated in the presence of Mo2C catalyst in non-aqueous pure Li–CO2 batteries, as shown in eqn (24).47,71 In 2017, Hou et al. used Mo2C/CNT and found that Li2C2O4–Mo2C was obtained after discharge, which was easier to be decomposed than Li2CO3 during charging.48 Thus, the reaction kinetics could be accelerated (Fig. 5f). The Li2C2O4–Mo2C decomposition process is described in eqn (40). Li2C2O4 − Mo2C → 2CO2 + 2Li+ + 2e− + Mo2C(40)


2.4.4 Electrochemical decomposition of Li2O. 
In 2017, Zhou's group discovered a new platform at a discharge voltage of 1.8 V, which was analysed by in situ SERS to form Li2O.47 Later, the subpeak of Li2O (at 520 cm−1) was slowly reduced until it disappeared during the charging process. In addition, O2 release was observed in CO2ER by DEMS characterization and a mass charge ratio of 4e−/O2 was obtained in the late stage of charging, further confirming the consumption routes of Li2O, as shown in eqn (41). 2Li2O + C → CO2 + 4Li+ + 4e−(41)
In 2021, Wang et al. studied the charging mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries in the presence of O2 using in situ AXPS. They found that Li2O, Li2O2 and C as the discharge products rapidly decreased and finally disappeared, and the Li 1s peak also shifted to the initial position after charging the battery from 1.3 V to 4.9 V.42 In addition, highly active species (O2*−/1O2) and new species generated by side reactions with the electrolyte were not detected during the charging process. Therefore, the consumption routes of Li2O were determined as eqn (42). 2Li2O + C + Li2O2 → CO2 + 6Li+ + 6e− + O2(42)In conclusion, the ideal Li–CO2 cell should operate in a fully reversible process. According to our summary on the charge–discharge reaction paths, only the path involving the generation of CO in the electrochemical reaction process is an irreversible process, which will lead to serious battery failure. The culprit of CO production is singlet oxygen (1O2), which will attack C and the electrolyte, resulting in the irreversibility of the battery. Therefore, the key to the pursuit of the ideal charging and discharging operation of reversible Li–CO2 batteries is to inhibit the formation of 1O2 in the process of Li2CO3 decomposition, rather than simply promoting the kinetics of Li2CO3 decomposition. Inhibiting the formation of 1O2 during the decomposition of Li2CO3 can proceed from two directions, as follows: (1) seeking a stable electrolyte solution, for example, a high concentration of ether electrolyte, molten salt electrolyte and solid electrolyte can quench 1O2 to 3O2. (2) Exploring catalysts (such as CO2O3) or redox mediators (2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone) with suitable O2 binding energy, which can bind to the precursors of 1O2 in advance and inhibit the formation of 1O2 and subsequent side reactions. This will facilitate the future development of high-performance and durable Li–CO2 batteries. Additionally, the electrochemical reactions of Li–CO2 batteries are affected by various factors, including humidity, temperature, atmosphere, discharge depth, current density, catalyst and electrolyte. At present, the electrochemical reaction route of Li–CO2 batteries is still controversial, and thus more characterization techniques are needed to further explore their specific electrochemical mechanism. In the following chapters, we reveal the specific effects of catalysts on the performance of Li–CO2 batteries.

3. Cathode catalyst for Li–CO2 batteries
Cathode catalysts, as the basic component for Li–CO2 batteries, play an important role in reducing the overpotential in the CO2RR and CO2ER processes and enhancing the reaction kinetics to achieve efficient and reversible Li–CO2 batteries. However, the foremost challenge in designing and developing highly active catalysts is their slow electrochemical kinetics, which leads to voltage polarization of Li2CO3 and C during discharge deposition. Therefore, the following basic requirements must be considered when designing a highly active and feasible cathode catalyst: (i) high active area, ensuring a large active space to provide sufficient nucleation of discharge products; (ii) high electronic conductivity; (iii) abundant vacancies and pores, enhancing the adequate diffusion of Li+ and CO2; (iv) superior catalytic activity and electrochemical stability, ensuring long-term battery operation and improving the energy efficiency; and (v) environmentally friendly and inexpensive.72,73 In addition, CO2 is an inert gas, and its activation leads to significant IR drop and ohmic overpotential in the process of discharge product formation. Therefore, in the design of catalysts, the rapid activation of CO2 and the reduction of the ohmic overpotential need to be considered. Impressively, based on the various charge and discharge mechanisms of Li–CO2 batteries and considering their reversibility and circularity, the design principle of catalysts is to avoid the production of CO in the charge–discharge reaction. Notably, the culprit in CO production is 1O2, which will attack C and the electrolyte, resulting in the irreversibility of the battery. Therefore, the key for the pursuit of ideal reversible Li–CO2 batteries is to inhibit the formation of 1O2 in the process of Li2CO3 decomposition, rather than simply promoting the kinetics of Li2CO3 decomposition.
Currently, the common cathode catalysts in Li–CO2 batteries include noble metal catalysts, carbon-based catalysts, rare earth catalysts and transition metal catalysts. Among them, transition metal catalysts are considered the ideal candidates due to their low cost, abundant reserves, multivalent properties, and high activity.74 In addition, transition metal catalysts possess noble metal-like outer electrons, high electron mobility, abundant defects and edge sites, and display high catalytic activity and stability in CO2 fixation and decomposition.66 Therefore, it is meaningful to explore low cost and high activity transition metal catalysts in the application of Li–CO2 batteries. In this section, we discuss the recent progress, challenges, and design strategies of various transition metals in details. Furthermore, the effects of the catalyst type, chemical composition, and spatial structure on the electrochemical performance of the CO2RR and CO2ER in O2-involved, H2O-involved and pure Li–CO2 cells are also discussed (Fig. 6).

3.1. Transition metal oxide catalysts

3.1.1 Manganese oxide catalysts. 
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are important electrode materials for catalytic applications, electrochemical energy storage and conversion due to their low cost, high abundance, facile synthesis and electrochemical stability.75 As a typical TMO material, manganese-based oxides (MBOs) have been considered as effective catalysts for Li–CO2 batteries owing to their low cost, adjustable polyvalence characteristics, abundant vacancies and availability.76 The extraordinary MnO6 octahedron effect and large pore structure of MBOs can ensure the sufficient contact on the cathode surface and diffusion of gas molecules, and thus accommodate more discharge products to improve the catalytic performance of the battery.77 Li et al. fabricated MnO nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped 3D interconnected graphene network (MnO@NC-G) as the cathode for an Li–CO2 battery.78 The cell with MnO@NC-G as the cathode exhibited a low voltage hysteresis of 0.88 V and as-recorded considerable discharge capacity of 25021 mA h g−1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 95.6% in the range of 2.0–4.5 V at 50 mA g−1. Additionally, the as-prepared MnO@NC-G could stably operate for more than 206 cycles at 1 A g−1, where the highly dispersed Mn(II) species could efficiently catalyze the decomposition of the discharge products and N-doped interconnected carbon network could provide superior electron transfer (Fig. 7a). Mao et al. synthesized ultrafine 2D IrO2-decorated layered δ-MnO2 nanoflakes uniformly grown on carbon cloth via an ordinary two-step hydrothermal reaction.79 The corresponding Li–CO2 battery delivered a high discharge capacity of 6604 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, indicating the outstanding catalytic activity of the cathode. Moreover, the thin-layered nanosheet displayed a large surface area and abundant ion transport channels, which were favorable for the conformal growth of the discharge products without agglomeration to large particles. In 2021, Chou and co-workers utilized layered δ-MnO2 and CNT composites to improve the catalytic activity.80 The repeated deposition of nanocrystalline MnO2 as nucleation sites and the synergistic effects between MnO2 and CNTs not only provided abundant active sites and sufficient Li+/electron transport pathways, but also promoted the electrolyte penetration and CO2 diffusion. Furthermore, DFT calculation showed that the CNT@2.5MnO2 composite with abundant oxygen vacancies possessed high electronic conductivity and catalytic capability, which facilitated CO2 fixation and Li2CO3 nucleation. Due to these favorable advantages, the optimized CNT@2.5MnO2 composite exhibited the lowest charge–discharge terminal voltage difference of 1.28 V at 200 mA g−1 and outstanding cycling stability for over 50 cycles.

Impressively, to address the drawbacks of poor cyclability and high overpotential of MnO2, Peng's group developed Co interstitially doped α-MnO2 nanowires.81 The assembled cell with the optimized Co0.2-αMn0.8O2/CC cathode showed a low overpotential of 0.73 V, high discharge capacity of 8160 mA h g−1 and excellent cyclability for over 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1. As shown in Fig. 7b, the DFT analysis revealed that Co doping could reduce the Fermi energy of α-MnO2, shorting the energy bandgap to form an obvious impurity band, and thus enhance its conductivity. Moreover, an appropriate cobalt doping concentration could weaken the valence bond characteristics and boost the ionic properties of Mn–O, thereby improving the electrical conductivity of the MnO2 material. In 2021, Tang et al. synthesized K+-doped α-MnO2 nanowires with 3D interlinked networks to enhance the adsorption of intermediates and the decomposition of Li2CO3.82 The relatively high doping amount of K+ in the primary structure of MnO2 could induce the charge reordering of Mn3+/Mn4+ and enhance the octahedral influence of MnO6. More importantly, the as-formed K–O bonds could stabilize the nanostructure of the MnO2 hosts, inhibit the dissolution of active Mn monomer, and provide ion transport channels and active sites for the CO2RR and CO2ER. Because of these advantages, the as-prepared KMONWs exhibited a small potential gap (1.25 V) and enhanced discharge capacity (9043 mA h g−1). Ma et al. prepared porous Mn2O3via the sol-gel method to study the discharge products of carbon.83 Impressively, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the discharge products of C accumulated on the porous Mn2O3 cathode were highly graphitized. Alternatively, the slow kinetics of the CO2RR and CO2ER for Mn2O3 in Li–CO2 batteries still faces severe challenges. Recently, Liu et al. designed sea urchin-like Mn2O3–Mn3O4 nanospheres with abundant nanoribbons to enhance the catalytic activity of the CO2RR and CO2ER processes.84 As shown in Fig. 7c, the electron microscopy images showed the that sea urchin-like outer nanoribbon was composed of abundant nanoparticles and mesopores, which could promote the mass transfer of Li+ and CO2, and enhance the CO2RR and CO2ER catalytic performance. Therein, Mn3O4 composed of tetrahedral voids occupied by Mn2+ and octahedral voids occupied by Mn3+ could induce the activation and enrichment of CO2 and reduce the side reactions of the charging platform. Alternatively, Mn2O3 could induce the nucleation of Li2CO3 and prevent its arbitrary deposition to enhance the CO2ER kinetics. Additionally, Mn2O3–Mn3O4 as a cathode displayed a low overpotential (1.24 V) and excellent discharge capacity (19024 mA h g−1). In 2022, Yang et al. connected MnOx–CeO2 hollow nanospheres to form a flexible and free-standing necklace-like layered cathode (MnOx–CeO2@PPy) by in situ polymerization and ligation of conductive polypyrrole (PPy).66 They found that the electrons of manganese could enter the crystalline structure of CeO2, and the electronic perturbation at the Ce–O–Mn interface led to the reconstruction of external electrons for MnOx and CeO2, which would facilitate electron transfer and provide more active sites. Meanwhile, PPy with overlapping π electron clouds had a binder-free structure and excellent electrical conductivity, which will be beneficial for CO2 capture. Due to these favorable advantages, MnOx–CeO2@PPy exhibited a low overpotential of 1.49 V, high discharge capacity (13631 mA h g−1) and good cycling performance (253 cycles) at 100 mA g−1. Remarkably, the flexible and free-standing MnOx–CeO2@PPy electrode could be bent at various angles and was stable for over 110 h (Fig. 7d). In addition, DFT results revealed that PPy possessed better CO2 adsorption capacity than metal oxides, which could rapidly diffuse the adsorbed CO2 to the surface of the metal oxide with high reaction sites and combine with free Li+ to finally form low-energy Li2CO3 and C (Fig. 7e).
In conclusion, the improvement strategies of catalytic activity for MBO catalysts include: (i) regulating the morphology and size, exposing the active sites, (ii) cation doping, (iii) forming porous structures; (iv) forming defects, and (v) composite materials.


3.1.2 Nickel oxide catalyst. 
Previous studies have shown that nickel oxide (NiO) is very feasible and efficient in promoting the decomposition kinetics of thermodynamically stable Li2CO3.85 The high catalytic activity of NiO as the cathode has been widely demonstrated in Li–O2 batteries, which is favorable to decompose the carboxylate and carbonate by-products that are inevitably formed during discharge, thereby prolonging the battery life.86,87 Based on this, Zhang et al. synthesized NiO nanosheets as a cathode for Li–CO2 batteries via the solvothermal method for the first time.88 Excitingly, the NiO nanosheets exhibited high catalytic activity, which provided abundant active sites for the decomposition of Li2CO3 in the CO2ER process, enhancing the environmental durability. The as-assembled Li–CO2 battery could achieve a charge potential of less than 4.0 V, a high discharge capacity of 9000 mA h g−1, and a coulombic efficiency of 97.8%. Although NiO could reduce the charging potential, it was difficult to determine the nucleation and growth mode of Li2CO3 due to the similar parameters of the a- and b-lattices in NiO. In 2019, Lu et al. prepared porous NiO nanofiber-supported carbon nanotube composites (NiO NFs/CNTs) using electrostatic spinning.89 It was found that the porous NiO NFs/CNTs could not only increase the contact area between the electrode and the conformally grown Li2CO3, but also maximize the diffusion of reactants and electrons, thereby promoting the decomposition of Li2CO3 in the CO2ER. Due to these favorable advantages, the NiO NFs/CNTs exhibited superior electrochemical performances, including high discharge capacity (11288 mA h g−1) and long cycle life (134 cycles). The DFT results showed that all three O atoms in the Li2CO3 molecule could bind to NiO with similar a- and b-lattice parameters, and thus enhance the activity of the C–O bond and realize the conformal growth of Li2CO3 (Fig. 8a). In the same year, Zhang et al. prepared ultra-small (∼2.50 nm) Ru nanoparticles (Ru NPs) uniformly anchored on NiO@Ni core–shell structures with a diameter of 17 nm (Fig. 8b).90 It was found that the Ru NPs and NiO surface had strong interfacial interactions, which could protect the Ni particles from deep oxidation and alter the external electronic environment of low oxidation states Ru. Ru/NiO@Ni/CNT as the cathode exhibited a low overpotential of 1.01 V and high stability of 105 cycles at 100 mA g−1 in a CO2/O2 (VCO2:VO2 = 4:1) atmosphere. In the voltage range of 2–4.6 V in the CV test (Fig. 8c), in situ FTIR characterization (Fig. 8d) revealed that the strong interaction between Ru and nickel monoxide could rapidly nucleate and decompose the polymer-like Li2CO3 (at 1408 cm−1) during the discharge and charge processes, and thus enhance the catalytic activity.

The majority of electrocatalysts rely on organic binder and conductive agent in the past, which present certain risks and block the contact sites of CO2 and Li+ to some extent, and thus result in a decline in the battery life. Thus, to overcome these shortcomings, Zheng et al. designed defect-rich NiO on carbon cloth (NiO-Vo@CC) as a freestanding cathode in 2021 (Fig. 8e).91 The abundant defects could break the symmetry of nickel ions and activate the CO2 molecule on the NiO surface via a Lewis base (electron donor). The electrochemical results showed that NiO-Vo@CC achieved a low overpotential (1.2 V) and excellent cycle performance (58 cycles) at 100 mA g−1, which were significantly superior to that of NiO@CC (1.6 V and 33 cycles, respectively) (Fig. 8f). This work laid a foundation for improving the catalytic activity of the catalysts by adjusting their structure through defect engineering. Afterwards, Li's group implanted NiO nanoarrays with oxygen-rich vacancies on carbon textiles (CTs) using a plasma-engraving technique.69 They found that the delocalized electrons in the outer Ni orbital could be excited and rapidly transferred to the C 2p orbital in the CO2 molecule, which could favor the combination between reactant/intermediate and electrons and the formation of Li2CO3. The real-time analysis of CO2 consumption and production through in situ DEMS showed that the charge-to-mass ratio in the CO2RR and CO2ER was 1.41 e− per CO2 and 1.47 e− per CO2, respectively, which was consistent with the theoretical value of 4Li+ + 3CO2 + 4e− ↔ 2Li2CO3 + C (4/3 e− per CO2) (Fig. 8f). DFT calculations revealed that the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Vo) could alter the bond lengths and bond angles in NiO, and stimulate the cleavage of stable C–O bonds. More importantly, a large number of antibonding states and unsaturated sites was formed at the Fermi level (Ef) due to the promotion of Vo, which facilitated electron transfer and enhanced the catalytic activity. Inspired by the ability of low-content cations in Li–O2 batteries, Zhu's group synthesized ultrafine Co-doped NiO nanoparticles (Co0.1Ni0.9Ox) on CNT substrates via the precipitation method and investigated their effect on the electrochemical performance of Li–CO2 cells.92 It was found that Co2+ doping could improve the P-type conductivity of NiO and increase the interaction between NiO nanoparticles and the interface of polymer Li2CO3. Due to these advantages, the Co0.1Ni0.9Ox electrode could achieve a high discharge capacity (5871.4 mA h g−1) and excellent Coulomb efficiency (92.91%).
Based on the results collected above, the current methods for improving the electrochemical activity of NiO catalysts in Li–CO2 batteries are shown as follows: (i) introducing oxygen vacancies to change the antibonding energy of NiO; (ii) cation doping to enhance the conductivity and interface interaction; and (iii) compositing with other materials. However, there are some measures to improve the catalytic activity of NiO that can be considered for future development, such as anion doping (C, N, S, and P) and heterostructure formation with other highly stable materials.


3.1.3 Titanium oxide catalysts. 
Titanium dioxide (TiO2), as a classical semiconductor, possesses high catalytic activity, good electrochemical stability and excellent surface adsorption energy, and thus it can be used as an electrochemical reducing and CO2 capture agent.93,94 In 2018, Pipes et al. prepared a nanocomposite film consisting of anatase-type TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in a CNT/CNF matrix as a gas diffusion cathode for Li–CO2 batteries.95 Here, the TiO2-NPs could provide a large specific surface area and act as catalytically active sites to absorb and activate the inert CO2 gas. In addition, CNT/CNF could serve as a flexible carbon network system to improve the electrical conductivity of the material. TiO2 NP@CNT/CNF as a cathode presented an initial discharge potential of 3.2 V and was stable for 20 cycles at 0.05 mA cm−2 and an end-of-life capacity of 250 μA h cm−2, which was better than the bare CNT/CNF (10 cycles). In 2020, Wang et al. used the hydrothermal method to uniformly deposit TiO2 nanowire arrays on carbon textiles (CTs), and then the vacancies and excited electrons generated by the photo-deposition technique tightly loaded RuO2NPs on TiO2NAs/CT to obtain a flexible independent cathode.96 They found that RuO2NPs as the main active sites could not only regulate Li2CO3 toward solvent-mediated pathway nucleation during discharge, but also activate stable C–O bonds to make them more breakable, thereby further enhancing the reaction kinetics. The TiO2 surface was beneficial to enrich CO2 and enlarge the deposition space for the discharge products. The electrochemical results showed that the flexible Li–CO2 cell assembled from the RuO2NPs-TiO2NAs/CT cathode exhibited a high discharge capacity (16727 mA h g−1), low overpotential (1.05 V) and high charge–discharge life of up to 1904 h at 250 mA g−1. Furthermore, bending these flexible cathodes at different angles and various deformations had negligible effects on their electrochemical performance. In 2021, Wang et al. synthesized n-type semiconducting TiO2 NAs on carbon cloth (CC) via seed auxiliaries as photoelectrodes for flexible Li–CO2 batteries.97 They found that unique nanowire arrays could facilitate electrolyte penetration and address the poor electron transport in one-dimensional active materials. Additionally, the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) would gather on the surface of the TiO2/CC electrode under the light induction, which could generate a potential difference to realize an external circuit and the recombination of electrons, thereby accelerating the CO2RR and CO2ER. The electrochemical results showed that TiO2/CC as a cathode under light irradiation exhibited a relatively low initial charging potential (2.88 V), low charge–discharge voltage difference (0.06 V), high energy efficiency (97.9%) and excellent rate performance, which were significantly better than that of TiO2/CC without illumination (Fig. 9a). In addition, the Li–CO2 battery could also be stably charged for 60 h under illumination by bending and twisting the battery at different angles (0°, 45°, and 90°), which lit a commercial light-emitting diode (LED), as shown in Fig. 9b. This work provided new ideas for reducing the charge and discharge potential of Li–CO2 batteries, realizing the conversion and storage of solar energy and electrical energy and promoting wearable products.

Natural sponges are a type of celluloid halobios with abundant three-dimensional interconnected porous structures and large surface areas, which can facilitate liquid absorption, gas penetration, and ion transport.98,99 Inspired by the special structure of natural sponges, Xu et al. synthesized a TiO2 nanorod array cathode via seed-assisted synthesis using carbonized sponge as a matrix (Fig. 9c).100 They found that the TiO2/sponge cathode could achieve a high discharge capacity (4.38 mA h cm−2), outstanding initial round-trip efficiency (88.39%) and excellent cycle life (over 1600 h), which were significantly better than that of the pure sponge. The improvement in electrochemical activity could be assigned to two points, as follows: (i) the interconnected framework and mesoporous channels of natural sponges could provide a large active area and space, accommodating considerable discharge products. (ii) The close contact of TiO2 NAs with carbon substrates as active sites would facilitate the capture of Li+ and CO2 molecules and promote the decomposition of discharge products, thereby accelerating the kinetics of the CO2RR and CO2ER. In addition, the characterization of the electrode after charging and discharging proved the formation of Li2CO3 after discharge and the complete decomposition of Li2CO3 after charging, while the electrolyte decomposition was negligible (Fig. 9d), which proved its excellent reversibility. In 2022, Zhang et al. combined the semiconducting TiO2 photocatalytic material and plasmonic Ag nanoparticles and found that the cathode displayed a dual-field synergistic effect in an Li–CO2 battery (Fig. 9e).72 Under an external optical field, the free-electron oscillations outside the Ag nanoparticles could generate a local electric field, which promoted the separation/transfer of photogenerated electrons, and the corresponding electron–hole pairs on the TiO2 surface, and thus inhibit the recombination of adverse carriers (Fig. 9f). The cell with the TiO2NA@AgNP cathode achieved an ultra-low charging potential (2.86 V), superior cycle stability (100 cycles) and good round trip efficiency (86.9%) at 0.1 mA cm−2. DFT calculations showed that under the action of a local electric field, the small adsorption energy of LiCO2* on the TiO2NA@AgNP surface (−2.32 V) was favorable for its desorption and diffusion into the electrolyte through the mediated effect followed by the formation of Li2CO3 (Fig. 9g). During the charging process, the coupling of the C–O bond in Li2CO3 with the Ag–O bond led to the activation and decomposition of Li2CO3, which was more conducive to the CO2ER kinetics. This work provided a new idea for dual-field synergy to improve the utilization of light energy to achieve high activity and stability of Li–CO2 batteries.
Based on the above collected results, the current methods to improve the electrochemical activity of the TiO2 catalyst in Li–CO2 batteries are as follows: (i) the introduction of oxygen vacancies induces the accumulation of photogenerated electrons in the conduction and valence bands to form a potential difference and enhance the reducing activity of CO2. (ii) Loading on carbon materials can not only enhance the conductivity of TiO2 semiconductors but also accommodate more discharge products on the catalyst surface. (iii) Binding with noble metal nanoparticles can promote the separation/transfer of the corresponding electron–hole pairs on the surface of TiO2. Although these strategies can improve the electrochemical activity of Li–CO2 cells, most TiO2 modifications are performed on carbon substrates, which would inhibit the spatial separation of light-generated electron–hole pairs. In the future development of Li–CO2 batteries, we believe that metal ions (Mn, Co, Cu, etc.) and non-metallic ions (N, I, S, etc.) can be designed to be doped in multifaceted titanium dioxide crystals to narrow the band gap of TiO2 and enhance the separation of electron–hole pairs generated by light. In addition, TiO2 also can construct heterojunctions with other materials (such as CeO2 and g-C3N4) to promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons at the interface and enhance the efficiency of light absorption and catalytic capacity.


3.1.4 Copper/molybdenum/cobalt oxide catalysts. 
Copper-based,101,102 Co-based,103,104 and molybdenum-based oxides105 have been widely used in electrocatalysis, Li ion batteries, and supercapacitors because of their low cost, good electrical conductivity, and high catalytic activity. In 2020, Jena et al.106 used the solution method to synthesize copper oxide with three different crystal structures (rhombic, octahedral, and cubic) to study its catalytic activity for CO2.104 It was found that the rhombohedral Cu2O mixed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under illumination could significantly reduce the overpotential and enhance the stability of Li–CO2 batteries, which was better than that of cubic and octahedral Cu2O materials. Yue et al. prepared CoSnO3/RuO2−x nanocomposites as reversible cathodes for Li–CO2 batteries.107 The electrochemical results showed that the CoSnO3/RuO2−x cathode exhibited a low overpotential of 0.94 V and good cycle stability of over 145 cycles with a fixed capacity of 600 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. This outstanding performance could be attributed to the high catalytic activity of metallic Ru, oxygen vacancies in the nanoparticles, and the synergistic effect between CoSnO3 and RuO2−x. In the same year, to solve the problem of poor cyclability, Thoka et al. synthesized spinel-structural ZnCo2O4 porous nanorods and CNT composites (ZnCo2O4@CNTs).108 The ZnCo2O4@CNT composite exhibited a high discharge capacity (4275 mA h g−1) and good cycling capability (over 200 cycles) at 100 mA g−1 and a cut-off capacity of 500 mA h g−1. The superior electrochemical performance was ascribed to the sufficient mesopores in ZnCo2O4@CNTs, which could promote the diffusion of CO2 and Li+ and increase the accommodation area of Li2CO3, thereby reducing the charging potential and enhancing the cycling stability. Chen et al. successfully synthesized MoO3-wrapped CNT nanoarrays for Li–CO2 batteries in 2021 using chemical vapor deposition and subsequent atomic vapor deposition.109 The uniform deposition of MoO3 could improve the overall catalytic activity and promote the mass transfer of Li+ and CO2. The interdigitated structure of CNTs could provide a large specific surface area, increase the contact with the electrolyte and improve the electrical conductivity. The as-assembled battery achieved a low overpotential of 1 V, an impressive total discharge capacity of 30.25 mA h cm−2 and an excellent lifetime of 300 cycles at 0.05 mA cm−2. In addition, bending the MoO3@CNT electrode at various angles could also successfully light a commercial LED light.
Based on the above understanding of TMOs, we can develop iron oxide, tungsten oxide, vanadium oxide and other TMOs with high outer electronic activity and easily formed defects in the future. In addition, TMOs can also be hybridized with some organic macromolecule conducting polymers, including polyacetylene (PA), polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI) and polythiophene (PTH), or with dopamine coating to enhance the electrical conductivity.

3.2. Transition metal sulfide catalysts
Besides TMOs, transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are also the common active materials in the fields of CO2RR, energy storage and conversion.110 In recent years, TMSs have been considered as ideal noble metal substitutes for Li–CO2 batteries due to their low cost and high catalytic intrinsic activity.111 As a typical 2D TMS material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has a hexagonal stacked layered structure similar to graphene with more active S-edge sites between layers.112 The spacing between each ultrathin monolayer of MoS2 is 6.5 Å connected by weak van der Waals forces, making the mobility of electrons about 2200 times faster along the basal plane than that perpendicular plane to the sheet.113,114 Ahmadiparidari et al. used MoS2 nanosheets as cathodes to study the formation mechanism of the discharge products (Li2CO3/C) in Li–CO2 batteries (Fig. 10a).115In situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and Raman spectroscopy characterization confirmed that the decomposition of crystalline Li2CO3 and amorphous carbon involves a four-electron transfer process. The coupling between the discharge products and the MoS2 interface could prevent the agglomeration of the amorphous C and Li2CO3, leading to a decrease in the oxidation potential. Based on DFT calculations, the defect sites generated at the carbon product and S edges were favorable for the dissociation/adsorption of CO2* and the conversion of difficult-to-desorb CO* into CO3* and C* to form Li2CO3 and C. Surprisingly, using ionic liquid/dimethyl sulfoxide (IL/DMSO) as the electrolyte, the MoS2 cathode demonstrated an overpotential gap of only 0.7 V in the first loop and a polarization potential of 1.45 V after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 with a limited capacity of 500 mA h g−1. Afterwards, to address the shortcomings of poor Coulombic efficiency and low chargeability, Chen et al. explored the effect of a series of MoS2/CNT composites as cathodes on the electrochemical performance of Li–CO2 batteries.116 The optimal MoS2/CNT-3 ratio showed a low overpotential (1.24 V), highest discharge capacity (8551 mA h g−1), high Coulombic efficiency (∼96.7%) and good cycling stability (over 142 cycles) at 100 mA g−1. The DFT calculations confirmed that the highly exposed S–Mo-edge displayed higher electrochemical activity and exhibited better adsorption effects for Li+, CO2, and Li2CO3 than Mo atoms, S atoms, and Mo–S planes. More interestingly, the catalytic activity and stability of the MoS2/CNT material were positively correlated with the number of exposed S–Mo-edge active sites, which provided an idea for the modification of Li–CO2 devices from edge active sites. Xie et al. prepared ZnS quantum dots supported on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (ZnS QDs/N-rGO) via a solvothermal reaction to study the effect of interfacial interactions on the discharge products of Li–CO2 batteries (Fig. 10b).117 The HRTEM result showed that ZnS QDs with a diameter of 2.5 nm were uniformly distributed on the highly wrinkled N-rGO surface with high interfacial activity. The interaction of these highly electronegative ZnS QDs and the N-rGO interface could provide considerable nucleation sites, enhance the fast electron transfer and CO2 absorption, and form a uniform Li2CO3/C film, which could be easily decomposed at low voltages. Notably, the ZnS QDs/N-rGO as the cathode exhibited an average overpotential of 1.21 V and a discharge capacity of 10310 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1.

Jin et al. designed a highly dispersed hollow NiS2/FeS2 nanostructure on an N, S co-doped graphene aerogel (NiS2/FeS2-NSGA) as an ideal Li–CO2 cathode.118 The existence of NiS2 and FeS2 facets and heterogeneous interfaces at the atomic level were preliminarily determined by XRD and HRTEM. The XPS spectra showed that the binding energies of the Ni 2p and Fe 2p orbitals shifted to negative and positive positions, implying the redistribution of NiS2 and FeS2 electrons at the interface, respectively (Fig. 10c). These results suggested the successful synthesis of the NiS2/FeS2 heterointerface. The heterointerface could facilitate electron transfer, tune the electronic structure, and promote the upshift of the d-band center at the atomic level. It is worth mentioning that NiS2/FeS2-NSGA exhibited a low overpotential of 1.10 V, which was significantly better than that of the single component catalytic activity at 0.1 A/g. Subsequently, Cheng's team first used DFT calculations to screen the S-vacancy (Sv)/N-dopant (N) ReS2 planes that exhibited the best activity for the adsorption of Li+ and CO2 and the decomposition of Li2CO3 in nine X-MS2 (M = Mo, W, Re; X= Sv, N, without Sv and N) structures (Fig. 10d).119 Based on this result, they synthesized a series of N dopants and S vacancies ReS2 (NSv-ReS2/CP) by controlling the N:S ratio to tune the number of N and S on the ReS2 plane. The optimal NSv-ReS2(5)/CP exhibited an ultra-low overpotential (0.66 V), high energy efficiency (81.1%) and large discharge capacity (1811 μA h cm−2) at 20 μA cm−2. The DEMS results showed that NSv-ReS2(5)/CP did not generate residual product of CO during the discharging and no O2 evolution reaction during the charging due to the fact that electrophilic S vacancies and nucleophilic N doping could tune the Li+ and C–O bonds on the ReS2 plane, thus achieving excellent CO2RR and CO2ER reversibility (Fig. 10e). Moreover, the Gibbs free energy change in the equilibrium potential (ΔGf) (Fig. 10f) demonstrated that the electrophilic S vacancies and nucleophilic N dopants could interact with the *Li2CO2 and *LiCO2 intermediates, favoring the first-stage thermodynamics of Li2CO3 and *CO nucleation and lowering the energy barrier for the second-stage rate-determining step. Based on the results collected above, the measures to improve the catalytic activity and stability of TMS cathodes in an Li–CO2 cell are shown as follows: (i) formation of quantum dots, (ii) stripping and exposing edge activity, (iii) photoinduced surface activation of CO2, (iv) heterojunction formation, and (v) electrophilic nucleophilic site regulation. Besides the above-mentioned methods, the mechanical exfoliation of the lamellar structure of TMSs is also an important way to make each monolithic layer exposed, release more active sites, and thus enhance the Li–CO2 battery performance. Furthermore, etching the surface of TMSs can cause phase transitions (e.g., 1T-MoS2 to 2H-MoS2), expose the edge S active sites and promote the CO2RR and CO2ER performances. Cationic doping (such as Fe, Co, and Ni) can also lower the CO2 adsorption/desorption energy barrier on the TMS surface and enhance the ion diffusion, thereby improving the battery performance.
3.3. Transition metal carbide catalysts
Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have attracted extensive attention in the fields of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),120 metal–air batteries,121 and electrocatalytic CO2RR122 due to their low cost, abundant reserves, excellent electrical conductivity, and good stability. Here, the carbon atoms in TMCs are melted into the interstitial space of the transition metal lattice to form an intermetallic filling compound, which makes them possess a strong d-band electron cloud density at the Fermi level.123 Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), as a representative TMC material, exhibits better adsorption activity and lower energy barrier than Mo due to its Pt-like d-band electronic structure and excellent catalytic behavior.124 Recently, Mo2C has been widely used as an Li–CO2 battery cathode due to its oxidized surface with high reversibility and electrical efficiency. Considering these merits, Hou et al. prepared Mo2C/CNT composites as a cathode for Li–CO2 batteries using the ball-milling method.48 The Mo2C/CNT cathode with high-uniformly dispersed Mo2C particles as the catalytic active sites and CNTs as the 3D conductive substrate achieved a high energy efficiency (77%), low discharge plateau (below 3.5 V), and excellent cycle performance (40 cycles). A series of in situ characterizations on Mo2C/CNT and pure CNTs revealed the formation of lithium oxalate-Mo2C (Li2C2O4–Mo2C) induced by the active Mo–C bonds in the CO2RR, avoiding the formation of Li2CO3. In general, the amorphous discharge products presented superior ionic conductivity than homologous crystalline structures, and thus amorphous Li2C2O4 was more easily decomposed, reducing the charge platform and improving the round-trip efficiency of the Li–CO2 cell. Based on this, Zhou and co-workers reported a quasi-solid-state flexible fiber-shaped Li–CO2 battery with Mo2C anchored on a CNT hybrid film (Mo2C/CNT) as the cathode, displaying a low overpotential and high energy efficiency (Fig. 11a).125In situ Raman characterization showed that the small tensile peak of the Mo–O bond gradually appeared at 920 cm−1 after discharge (Fig. 11b) because the electronegative O atom in C2O42− could adsorb the external electrons of Mo2+/Mo3+ in Mo2C, increasing the valence state of the Mo atom. These delocalized external electrons facilitated the stabilization of the C2O42− intermediates and the formation of amorphous Li2C2O4. Alternatively, in the CO2ER, the Mo–O coupling was affected by the electronegativity and dissociated, and the delocalized electrons returned to the Mo–C bond. In this case, the as-resulting discharge product was Li2C2O4, which was more easily dissociated than Li2CO3. Additionally, the DFT results indicated that the coordinated electron transfer of Mo2C could stabilize the intermediate discharge product of Li2C2O4, preventing the formation of Li2CO3 in the subsequent four-electron disproportionation processes.

Subsequently, Yang et al. systematically investigated the possible reaction mechanisms during the nucleation of Li2C2O4 and Li2CO3via theoretical simulations using three metastable Mo2C structures [α-Mo2C (001), β-Mo2C (001) and β-Mo2C (101)].126 It was found that the non-spontaneous CO2 adsorption is the kinetic controlling steps of Li2C2O4 nucleation, while carbonate formation is the rate-determining step of Li2CO3. The conversion of Li2C2O4 to Li2CO3 in the absence of catalyst passes through two subsequent disproportionation steps, as shown in eqn (43) and (44): (43) (44)The energetic profiles (Fig. 11c) demonstrated that in the presence of the Mo2C catalyst, the cracking of Li2C2O4 required a higher free energy for non-spontaneous disproportionation to form Li2CO3, implying that Li2C2O4 could be stabilized as the final discharge product without forming Li2CO3. In addition, the Bader charge analysis (Fig. 11d) demonstrated that the electronegative C in Li2C2O4 was mutually coupled with Mo on the surface of β-Mo2C (101), and the electron transfer from Li2C2O4 to the catalyst surface resulted in the positive charge of Li2C2O4. This Coulomb interaction between the catalyst surface and the intermediate product interface was an important factor in determining the stability of Li2C2O4 and the catalytic activity of Mo2C. Although the formation mechanism of Li2C2O4 in Mo2C had been explored, the effect of electrolytes on the reaction pathway of Mo2C remained unclear. In 2020, Kang et al. employed graphene nanosheets/β-Mo2C (GNPs/β-Mo2C) as a cathode to deeply study the effect of the electrolyte dielectric constant on the discharge reaction pathway of Li–CO2 batteries.127 Continuous solvent model calculations showed that the adsorption energy of C2O42−/Li2C2O4 on the tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)-based electrolyte with a low dielectric constant was significantly lower than that of N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) with high dielectric constant. Specifically, the presence of DMA increased the Li–O distance of the catalytic intermediate, and the nucleation of Li2C2O4 on the Mo2C surface was unstable. Thus, Li2CO3 was formed on the electrode via a four-electron pathway. Furthermore, a series of characterizations of discharge products confirmed that Mo2C in high dielectric constant solution could break through the constraints of C–O bonds to form Li2CO3 instead of Li2C2O4. This work provided new insights for electrolyte design to adjust the discharge pathway in Li–CO2 batteries. Nevertheless, severe polarization still limited the practical application of TMCs in Li–CO2 batteries. Subsequently, Yao's group successfully synthesized W2C nanoparticles embedded in CNT tubes (W2C-CNTs) via a high-temperature carburizing method.128 The as-assembled battery showed an ultra-low charging voltage of 3.2 V, a discharge capacity of 10632 mA h g−1, and a high round-trip efficiency of 90.1% at 100 mA g−1. Fourier transformed X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (Fig. 11e) and XPS characterization revealed that the proportion of W–C bonds in the discharge products decreased, and the electrons of W atoms were transferred to the π* state of O atoms in Li2CO3 to form W–O bonds. The easy loss of electrons from these W–O bonds during charging led to an increase in the electron density of the π* orbital, which destroyed the stable triangular structure of CO32−, thereby promoting the dissociation of Li2CO3 and reducing the charge polarization. Notably, the surface electrostatic potential (Fig. 11f) and charge density difference (Fig. 11g) suggested that electrons were more readily available around the electrophilic O atoms in CO32−. In addition, DFT calculation revealed that Li2CO3 exhibited strong interfacial activity with the W2C surface, which transferred the accumulated charge of W–O to W–C, resulting in a low decomposition barrier for Li2CO3. In 2022, Zhu et al. designed a composite nanofiber (NCMC) consisting of molybdenum carbide nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-rich carbon-crusted multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) core.129 Through Raman spectroscopy and XPS characterization of the catalytic product after the 1st discharge and charge, they found that the discharge product was Li2CO3 rather than the previously reported Li2C2O4. The abundant pore channels of the NCMC provide sufficient space for the nucleation of Li2CO3 and transport routes for the diffusion of CO2. The embedding of MoC nanoparticles on the surface of N-doped carbon shell could enhance the adsorption affinity and conductivity of Li2CO3, and propel the rapid transformation of Li2C2O4 into stable Li2CO3, thus enhancing the activity for the CO2RR.
Based on the above-mentioned results, TMCs are currently adopted together with the following strategies to increase the catalytic activity and reversibility of Li–CO2 batteries: (i) changing the discharge reaction path; (ii) using electrolyte solution with high dielectric constant; and (iii) the formation of highly electronegative bonds or groups, which promote the decomposition of Li2CO3. Besides the above-mentioned methods, we can prevent the rapid growth and severe aggregation of TMCs and increase the active contact area by aniline–pyrrole complexing agents in the future. In addition, the zero- and one-dimensional structures in TMCs can be transformed into two- and three-dimensional structures. For example, three-dimensional Mo2C with a porous structure was prepared via the molten salt method using one-dimensional MoO3 nanowires. These strategies can provide new ideas for the subsequent application of TMCs in Li–CO2 batteries.
3.4. Transition metal nitride catalysts
Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) exhibit metal d-band contraction, high adsorption, and a metal-covalent structure, which are similar with TMCs in the adjacent main group. Recently, TMNs have shown admirable promise in electrocatalysis,130 supercapacitors,131 and metal–gas batteries132 due to their low cost, high electronic conductivity (over 4.55 × 106 S m−1), unique half-filled shell effect (4d55s1) and d-orbital overlap. In addition, the lattice expansion in TMNs and the metal–nitrogen bond formed by the diffusion of N atoms in the metal interstitial enable their high melting point, high reversibility and superior stability, and thus the electrode can work in harsh environments.133 In 2020, Pipes et al. prepared a vanadium nitride nanowire (VN-NW) membrane as a carbon-free gas diffusion cathode (GDC) for Li–CO2 batteries by ammonia reduction.134 The layered VN-NWs with abundant nitrogen-edge sites could not only optimize the surface mechanical integrity and CO2 adsorption, but also suppress the electrolyte decomposition, providing sufficient active sites and interstitial space for the continuous nucleation of Li2CO3 to accommodate the volume evolution in the CO2RR and CO2ER. The Li–CO2 cells with VN-NWGDCs as cathodes achieved a small round-trip overpotential (<1 V), high capacity (5915 μA h cm−2), terminal charge voltage (<3.75 V) and energy efficiency (∼83%) at 0.05 mA cm−2. Impressively, the Li–CO2 cells exhibited a gradually sloping voltage polarization at 0.05 mA cm−2 and a cut-off voltage of 250 μA h cm−2 after 100 cycles. A series of characterizations revealed that the voltage polarization of the assembled Li–CO2 cells was mainly due to the following three reasons: (i) VN-NWs allowed the rapid nucleation and continuous accumulation of Li2CO3 on their surface in radial growth mode, resulting in gradually inclined discharge polarization; (ii) as the surface of the GDC was covered by discharge products, the passivation of the N sites on its surface made it difficult to adsorb CO2; and (iii) the lower electrical conductivity of VN-NWGDCs compared with commercial carbon-based GDCs may contribute a considerable ohmic overpotential, leading to voltage polarization.
In 2022, to address the issues of battery polarization and sluggish reaction kinetics, Qi et al. designed a flexible Li–CO2 cell based on binder-free and noble metal-free molybdenum nitride nanofibers on acidulated carbon cloth (CC@MoN NFs), which displayed low polarization and high energy efficiency (Fig. 12a).135 The flexible battery with CC@MoN NFs as the cathode demonstrated an ultra-small potential gap of 0.36 V, high discharge capacity of 6542.9 mA h cm−2, superior initial energy efficiency of over 88% and outstanding cycle stability for 86 cycles. The in situ XRD (Fig. 12b), XPS and ex situ Raman characterization preliminarily showed that the discharge product was Li2C2O4. In addition, according to the color change of the special reagent, it was further verified that the discharge product was Li2C2O4 instead of Li2CO3, and its formula is as follows: 2MnO4− + 5C2O42− + 16H+ → 2Mn2+ + 10CO2 + 8H2O(45)

The discharge product of the CC@MoN NF cathode was colorless after the addition of KMnO4, while the CC remained purple, confirming that the discharge product was Li2C2O4. DFT calculations proved that the Mo3+ delocalized electrons in MoN could couple with the O atoms in C2O42− to form Mo–O bridges, which could promote the stable nucleation of Li2C2O4 and decomposition after charging. The fabricated flexible battery could maintain outstanding brightness of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) without obvious attenuation under various twisting states and bending angles (Fig. 12c). Afterwards, Ma et al. designed and developed a binder-free cathode of MOF-derived Co4N and Cu integration bimetallic nitrides on carbon cloth (Cu–Co4N@CC).136 They found that the electron cloud around Co4N diffuses to the Fermi level due to the introduction of Cu, which is beneficial for the bonding between the material interfaces, thus improving the electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of the material. In addition, the unique hierarchical structure was conducive to the mass transfer of Li+, CO2 and electrons, which increased the contact area between the reactants and catalysts, adjust the discharge products, and facilitate the formation and decomposition of Li2CO3. This work supported the development of non-noble metal nitrides as highly active and stable cathodes, encouraging the research and exploitation of noble metal-free cathodes for Li–CO2 batteries.
Based on the above results, TMNs are currently adopted to enhance the discharge capacity and catalytic activity of Li–CO2 batteries through the following strategies: (i) forming carbon-free nanofibers; (ii) changing the discharge path and forming stable intermediates; and (iii) introducing bimetallic or polymetallic species to change the electronic structure. In addition to the above-mentioned strategies, TMN films prepared by the sputtering method can enlarge the accommodation space for the discharge products, and thereby enhance the Li–CO2 battery performance. Alternatively, metal complexes (ethylenediamine) can also be used to prepare TMN composites to reduce the battery polarization.
3.5. MXene catalysts
MXenes are novel two-dimensional layered materials with a potato chip-type structure, which are composed of transition metal nitrides, carbides or carbonitrides. MXenes have the general chemical formula of Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where “X” stands for N, C or CN, “M” stands for traditional transition metal element and Tx stands for –F or –OH connected at the most end point.137 In recent years, MXenes have been widely used in electrocatalytic hydrogen production,138 supercapacitors139 and lithium–ion batteries140 due to their flexible and tunable structures and high electrical conductivity. Previous studies have shown that the metal ends in MXene materials can effectively capture CO2.141 In 2020, Wang et al. introduced MXene materials in Li–CO2 batteries for the first time. Using metastable Ti atoms generated on Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets as nucleation center sites, they synthesized stable TiO2 nanoparticles with abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov-TiO2/MXene) using gentle NH4HF2 etching and subsequent ethanol heat treatment (Fig. 12d).142 The SEM image (Fig. 12e) revealed that the Ov-TiO2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the potato chip-like MXene with a large amount of space, which facilitated the sufficient contact among CO2, the electrolyte and the material, and thus accelerated the CO2RR and CO2ER kinetics. Assembling the Ov-TiO2/MXene cathode into an Li–CO2 battery enabled a rather low charge potential of 3.37 V at 100 mA g−1, high discharge capacity (18045.5 mA h g−1) and excellent cycling performance (158 cycles) at 200 mA g−1.
In 2021, Peng et al. employed vacuum filtration and in situ redox reactions to fabricate a binder-free and stand-alone MXene and δ-MnO2 composite film (Ti3C2–0.1MnO2) for an Li–CO2 battery.143 Electrochemical analysis revealed that the Ti3C2–0.1MnO2 membrane with high electrical/ionic conductivity and porous structure displayed a low overpotential (∼0.89 V) and outstanding cycle stability of ∼220 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Additionally, first-principles calculations indicated that the Ti from the MXene replaced the Mn site on the 3d orbit and propelled the transformation for MnO2 from a tetrahedral lamellar structure into an octahedral structure, which could enhance the adsorption of Li+ and the rapid decomposition of Li2CO3 (Fig. 12f). Due to the higher F concentration on the MXene surface, an LiF-rich solid passive layer was formed, which led to the deactivation of the surface catalytically active sites. Thus, to address this issue, Hu et al. synthesized Ti3C2Tx MXene/carbon heterostructures (MNTs) by electrospinning and self-sacrificial templating methods.63 The electrochemical results showed that the MNTs exhibited a fairly low overpotential (1.38 V) and good cyclic stability (100 cycles) at 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 12g). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the following two points: (i) the MNTs with hollow tubular structure possess a large specific surface area, which was favorable for the contact among the electrode, CO2 and electrolyte interface. (ii) The heterostructure of the Ti3C2Tx MXene and C possessed strong catalytic activity, which could promote CO2 adsorption and accelerate the decomposition of Li2CO3, thereby enhancing the CO2RR and CO2ER kinetics.
MXene materials are currently used to improve the catalytic activity and stability of Li–CO2 batteries through the following strategies: (i) introducing oxygen vacancies to increase the specific surface area and electrical conductivity and (ii) combining with other materials to form heterostructures to improve the interfacial activity. In the future, the structure of the MXene materials can be adjusted to increase their catalytic activity by adding some coupling agents and active agents, such as mercaptopropyl silane coupling agent and polyaniline.
3.6. Layered double hydroxides/oxides and oxyhydroxides
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) possess a stacked layered structure, similar to that of MXenes. LDHs are composed of a main layer and overlapping anion/water molecules between layers. They have been considered as ideal electrodes and attracted widespread interest because of their easy modification, low cost, high redox activity and multi-functionalization.144 In 2020, Wang et al. reported a reversible cathode employing Rhodopseudomonas palustris microbial-derived functional carbon (M-FC) as a conductive network to decorate hollow NiCo-LDHs nanoflowers (Fig. 13a).145 The M-FC/NiCo-LDH cathodes displayed a considerable discharge capacity of 13756.8 mA h g−1, excellent rate performance of up to 2000 mA g−1 and outstanding cyclability of 60 cycles. The predominant electrochemical performance of the M-FC/NiCo-LDH cathodes could be attributed to the following two reasons: (i) the uniformly distributed mesopores in hollow NiCo-LDHs nanoflowers could adequately expose additional active sites in the host layers, which could ensure the rapid deposition and decomposition of Li2CO3, and thus favor CO2RR and CO2ER. (ii) M-FC could provide sufficient mass transfer channels and act as a co-catalyst to accelerate the kinetics of electrochemical reaction.

Layered double oxides (LDOs) derived from LDHs have attracted extensive research in CO2 adsorption146 and electrocatalysis147 due to their high specific surface area and abundant alkaline sites. Xu et al. designed and prepared Ru3+ cation-intercalated CoTiLDH via electrodeposition and subsequent memory effect, and finally obtained a highly active RuO2/CoTiLDO cathode (Fig. 13b).148 The unique layered structure in CoTiLDO enabled the subtly dispersed atomic RuO2 to generate abundant mesopores and macropores through the action of steric confinement, which not only could eliminate the agglomeration and bonding problem caused by the large surface energy between atoms to a large extent, but also provide sufficient interconnection channels for CO2 diffusion and Li+ transmission. The electrochemical results showed that RuO2/CoTiLDO showed a discharge capacity of 5455 mA h g−1 in a pure CO2 atmosphere, which was significantly better than that in pure O2 (3037 mA h g−1) at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 13c). In addition, RuO2/CoTiLDO also exhibited an ultra-low charging voltage of 3.2 V at 166 mA g−1, which was almost the lowest charging voltage reported thus far. DEMS revealed that the charge-to-mass ratio of consumed CO2 and electrons in the CO2RR is 1.48 e− per CO2, while the charge–mass ratio in CO2ER is 1.38 e− per CO2, which was close to the theoretical value that one gaseous CO2 would be generated for every 3/4 electron transfer in the 4Li+ + 3CO2 + 4e− → 2Li2CO3 + C reversible equation.
Metal oxyhydroxides have shown great potential in supercapacitors,149 electrocatalysis,150 and Li/Na-ion batteries151,152 due to their good electrical conductivity, high deformation and tunnel structure. Recently, Ma et al. reported the in situ growth of MnOOH arrays composed of uniformly cross-linked nanosheets on stainless steel (SS) via an assisted hydrothermal method with PVP as the surfactant.153 These MnOOH arrays not only possessed abundant nano-spaces for ion transport and gas diffusion, but also could tune the distribution and accumulation of the discharge products, significantly enhancing the catalytic performance. The electrochemical results showed that MnOOH/SS displayed a high starting voltage of 2.8 V, stable charge/discharge potential of more than 138 cycles and close to 1400 h at 200 mA g−1 and a cut-off capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 (Fig. 13d). Through the characterization of the discharge products, it was found that the MnOOH nanoarrays could induce the uniform deposition of ultra-small Li2CO3 nanoparticles with a size of 5 nm, which greatly improved the contact interface and promoted the electron transport on the discharge products. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that LiCO, LiCO2 and Li2CO3 were spontaneously formed by the collision of CO2 and Li atoms (Fig. 13e). The natural bond orbital showed that the number of Li–O bonds in these spontaneously formed Li2CO3 is 0.35, which was significantly higher than that in LiCO and LiCO2 (Fig. 13f). This suggested that the catalytic kinetics of the CO2RR could be improved by regulating the nucleation behavior of Li2CO3. This work provided a new idea for regulating the uniform distribution of discharge products and electron transport in Li–CO2 batteries. To adjust the charge density of LDHs, LDOs, and metal oxyhydroxides, reduce the band gap, and enhance the conductivity of materials, high-valence metal ion doping (Cr, V, and Mn) should also be considered in the future. Alternatively, the stacked lamellae can be unfolded by mechanical exfoliation to fully utilize the active sites.
3.7. Perovskite catalysts
Perovskite-type materials have attracted extensive attention due to their low price, thermodynamic stability, simple process, and good electrical conductivity.154 Perovskite-type catalysts are special octahedral structures composed of A, B and O, with the chemical formula ABO3, where A represents rare earth metals and alkaline earth metals, and B represents traditional transition metals. The A site is coordinated with 12 electronegative O atoms due to its larger atomic radius, while the B site is usually coordinated with 6 electronegative O atoms (Fig. 13g).155 The A and B sites of perovskites can be paired with a variety of elements to exhibit abundant defects and special physicochemical properties, which have great potential for CO2 reduction.156 Maiti et al. used DFT to simulate the application of the La(1−x)SrxFe(1−y)CoyO(3−δ) perovskite structure to the thermodynamic transformation of CO2. It was found that the Sr- and O-rich surfaces were the most stable state and could generate a large number of oxygen vacancies along the terminals of transition metals, and thus display the strongest capacity for CO2 adsorption.157 Park et al. synthesized the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.7Mn0.3O3 perovskite structure with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies, which exhibited good CO2 reduction ability, higher CO selectivity and excellent faradaic efficiency of 95%.158 Apparently, the perovskite structures exhibited good selectivity and catalytic ability for the CO2RR and CO2ER.
Based on these inspirations, Zou et al. designed a heterostructure composed of Cu nanoparticles and mesoporous La0.96Sr0.04Cu0.3Mn0.7O3−δ (LSCM) perovskite for Li–CO2 batteries.67 They found that the LSCM perovskite structures could provide abundant defects, which could not only enhance the contact area of the catalyst with the electrolyte, but also promote the transport of Li+ and CO2. The in situ dissolved Cu NPs with smaller particles could intercalate in the perovskite structure voids, thereby enhancing the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity. Benefiting from the vacancy-rich and porous nanofiber architecture, Cu-LSCM could exhibit a lower voltage gap, high discharge capacity and cycle over 107 cycles without distinct voltage polarization. After charging and discharging, more particles appeared on the surface of the nanofibers after discharging, but disappeared after charging, which proved that the synergistic effect between metal nanoparticles and perovskite is beneficial to maintain the good reversibility of materials. This work provided direct evidence for the application of perovskite in Li–CO2 batteries and new inspiration for the design of future catalysts. Furthermore, the lattice coefficient of the perovskite structure can be regulated by bimetallic doping at sites A and B in the future, which can cause lattice expansion and the formation of oxygen vacancies, and thus increase the nucleation accommodation area for the discharge products.
3.8. Monometallic nanoparticle and bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts
In addition to the perovskite materials mentioned in the previous section, metal nanoparticles are also one of the most common materials in CO2 reduction.159 Metal nanoparticles can be divided into monometallic nanoparticles (MMNPs) and bimetallic nanoparticles (BMNPs) based on their structure and composition. Among them, MMNPs have been widely used in homogeneous catalysis,160 environmental protection,161 and energy conversion162 due to their small particle size, large specific surface area, excellent dispersion, and high interfacial/surface energy. Based on previous inspiration, MMNPs can effectively decompose stable Li2CO3. In 2018, Zhang et al. reported the preparation of Ni nanoparticles evenly dispersed on interconnected N-doped graphene (NG) via a simple hydrothermal method and thermal treatment, which were adopted as cathodes in an Li–CO2 cell for the first time (Fig. 14a).43 They discovered that the as-assembled Li–CO2 battery exhibited an outstanding discharge capacity of 17625 mA h g−1 and superior cycle life of 100 cycles. Impressively, the formation and decomposition of carbon films and aggregated Li2CO3 particles on the surface of Ni-NG could be visually observed during the CO2RR and CO2ER processes. Additionally, the DFT results indicated that the exposed (111) and (200) planes in the Ni nanoparticles could provide high active sites and sufficient space for the adsorption of Li+/CO2 and Li2CO3 decomposition, enhancing the catalytic performance for the CO2RR and CO2ER. Subsequently, Qiao et al. designed ultra-fine Ni nanoparticles anchored on reduced-graphene oxide (r-GO) frameworks as a cathode by combining 3D printing with thermal shock technology, in which the electrode thickness was up to ≈0.4 mm.163 The Ni/r-GO framework with porous structure exhibited a discharge plateau exceeding 2.7 V, a charge–discharge voltage difference as low as 1.05 V and excellent performance of 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. The remarkable electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the following aspects: (i) the 3D-printed carbon-based framework possessed highly porous structures and open channels, which facilitated the penetration of electrolytes and the diffusion of CO2 and ions. (ii) The Ni nanoparticle conductor and the interconnected r-GO framework could provide superior conductive networks, ensuring the stable Li2CO3 for superior electron/proton transport at the Ni/r-GO interface. (iii) The uniform distribution of ultrafine Ni nanoparticles provided abundant active sites and contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, enhancing the reversible conversion between Li+/CO2 and Li2CO3. According to previous reports, Cu nanoparticles possessed directional catalytic ability, which could induce the initial stage of CO2 activation and spontaneous chemisorption in CO2-saturated aqueous medium. Zhang et al. prepared uniformly dispersed Cu nanoparticles on wrinkled and folded NG using a gel-like film approach as an efficient cathode for Li–CO2 batteries.164 The electrochemical results demonstrated that the Cu-NG electrode achieved a high discharge capacity (14864 mA h g−1), ultra-low overpotential (0.77 V), excellent Coulombic efficiency (92.0%) and good stability (50 cycles) at 200 mA g−1. Through ex situ characterization, it was found that a CuO film with a thickness of 3–5 nm was formed on the surface of Cu nanoparticles, which could prevent the corrosion of the electrode during the CO2ER process and increase its stability. The hemoglobin molecule possesses four globular protein groups containing Fe ions. Among them, the Fe in the porphyrin group shows redox ability, while Fe in the corresponding histidine group can effectively combine with CO2, and thus hemoglobin is expected to be a catalyst component for the CO2RR. Considering these advantages, Kim et al. utilized ultrafine capillary action to incorporate hemoglobin solution in the pore channels of CNT and successfully embedded Fe nanoparticles (≈5 nm) in N-doped CNTs after calcination (Fig. 14b).165 They found that the Fe nanoparticles in hemoglobin could act as active sites to enhance the nucleation of Li2CO3, while a small amount of N atoms in hemoglobin acted as an anionic dopant to increase the electrical conductivity of CNTs. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the FeNP@N-CNT cathode could memorably present triple charge–discharge capacity, superb Coulombic efficiency (90%) and preferable cycling stability (30 cycles). Ex situ XRD displayed that Li2CO3 was formed on the FeNP@N-CNT electrode surface during discharge and disappeared during charging, confirming that the reacted Li–CO2 battery underwent the four-electron formation of Li2CO3 (4Li+ + 3CO2 + 4e− ↔ 2Li2CO3 + C), instead of forming the Li2C2O4 phase via a two-electron process (2Li+ + 2CO2 + 2e− ↔ Li2C2O4), as shown in Fig. 14c. This work provided an idea for the combination of biowaste derivatives and metal nanoparticles for environment-friendly Li–CO2 batteries.

Bimetallic nanoparticles (BMNPs) are composed of two different metal ions, which exhibit unique optical, magnetic and catalytic properties through metal synergy between adjacent atoms.166 In addition, BMNPs can achieve geometric effects and rapid electron transfer by precisely controlling diverse changes in chemical composition and structure, enabling them to show better catalytic activity and stability than that of MMNPs.167 Choi et al. reported that Pd–Cu BMNPs applied to Li–O2 batteries exhibited better cycling stability and round-trip efficiency than that of Cu and Pd MMNPs.168 In 2018, Zhang et al. reported monodispersed copper and ruthenium BMNPs (Ru–Cu–G) on graphene for Li–CO2 batteries.169 Compared with monometallic Ru–G and Cu–G, the co-dispersed Ru–Cu–G exhibited better dispersibility and structural stability. Furthermore, the interaction of Cu and Ru bimetals made them more closely connected with graphene, which not only avoided the serious accumulation of Li2CO3, but also altered the electron cloud density around Cu and Ru, thus enhancing the reversibility of the electrode. Impressively, Ru–Cu–G presented good stability (over 100 cycles) at 200 mA g−1, even at 400 mA g−1, showing an extremely high discharge capacity of 13590 mA h g−1 and superior Coulomb efficiency of 96%. In 2019, Chen's group deposited Ru–Cu bimetallic nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to study the effects of the material structure and electronic effects on the performance of Li–CO2 batteries.170 Valence band spectrum characterization showed that the d-band center of i-Ru4Cu1/CNFs was significantly reduced compared with that of Cu/CNFs and Ru/CNFs, which was not only conducive to the modification of electronic structure and the rapid movement of electrons, but also could optimize the rapid nucleation of Li2CO3 and improve the catalytic activity. Based on these advantages, i-Ru4Cu1/CNFs assembled into batteries exhibited an ultra-low overpotential of 0.9 V and a lower discharge voltage of 2.7 V at 100 mA g−1. It is worth noting that even at 300 mA g−1, the Ru–Cu bimetallic nanoparticles also exhibited an ultra-high discharge capacity of 15753 mA h g−1 and a remarkable Coulombic efficiency of 99%. Afterwards, Jin et al. successfully synthesized ultra-small Ru–Co bimetallic nanoparticles cathodes (Ru82Co18/CNFs) with an average particle size of 9.7 nm on CNF substrates via a solvothermal and calcination strategy.171 The uniformly dispersed Ru–Co bimetallic nanoparticles served as the main catalytically active sites, which could effectively enrich CO2 molecules, promote the rapid nucleation of discharge products and enhance the decomposition kinetics during charging. The CNF substrate could improve the wettability of the nanoparticles and dielectrics, facilitate electron transfer and accommodate more Li2CO3, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and discharge capacity. Electrochemical tests showed that the Ru82Co18/CNFs achieved an overpotential of 0.98 V and a stable cycling performance over 90 times at 100 mA g−1, while the discharge capacity could also reach 17270 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1. Additionally, Ru82Co18/CNFs exhibited negligible charge–discharge voltage difference even after continuous operation for 350 h, confirming the superior catalytic activity and cycling performance of the Ru–Co bimetallic nanoparticles (Fig. 14d). This work provided a new basis for designing and precisely controlling the bimetallic nanoparticles for Li–CO2 batteries. Cu-Based catalysts tend to oxidize and form dense passivation films during the electrochemical reduction of CO2, resulting in reduced electrochemical activity. To overcome these blocks, Gong et al. decorated Pd–Cu BMNPs on N-CNFs as an efficient and stable cathode via a co-reduction technique in 2022.172 They found that PdCu nanoparticles possessed a special external electronic structure, which could attract sp-hybridized negatively charged CO2, while N-CNFs prepared by electrospinning could improve the conductivity and increase the transport space of Li+ and CO2, and thus PdCu/N-CNFs exhibited better CO2RR and CO2ER activities than monometallic. The electrochemical data revealed that the PdCu/N-CNF electrode achieved an ultra-low overpotential of 1.17 V and cycling stability for 250 cycles at 400 mA g−1 (Fig. 14e), maintaining a negligible polarization voltage even after continuous charge and discharge for 1350 h. The discharge products formed by conformal growth were found to be flakes rather than large particles. In addition, XPS spectra (Fig. 14f) also revealed the formation of C–O bonds during the discharge process and their complete disappearance after the charge process, confirming that Li2CO3 was formed through a four-electron process. It can be seen that the metal nanoparticles played an important role in reducing the polarization, increasing the Coulombic efficiency and enhancing the stability for Li–CO2 batteries.
Based on the summary of metallic nanoparticle catalysts, the vast majority of nanoparticles reported thus far are loaded on carbon carriers. Although these metallic nanoparticles possess excellent electrocatalytic activity, their cycling performance still needs to be improved. In addition, the metal nanoparticles will seriously aggregate during the heat treatment. Meanwhile, it is difficult to control the particle size, and thus the discharge products are difficult to be decomposed during the charging process. Therefore, embedding, pore confining domains and pretreatment can be used to enhance the metal-support interaction and reduce the size of nanoparticles. In addition, stabilizers such as block copolymers (polyvinylpyrrolidone), surfactants, organic ligands and dendrimers (polyphenylene oxide) can also be used to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles, and thus enhance the cycle stability of Li–CO2 batteries.
3.9. Metal single-atom catalysts
Transition metal materials and metallic nanoparticles are popularly employed as heterogeneous catalysts in Li–CO2 cells, and their catalytic activity and stability are closely related to the number of catalytic sites and specific surface area at the catalyst/carrier interface.173 To enhance the catalytic activity of metal atoms, metal single-atom catalysts (MSACs) with low coordination environments and unique electronic structures have attracted extensive attention.174 Theoretically, MSACs reflect the limit of the minimum size of metallic nanoparticles, guaranteeing 100% atomic utilization efficiency and maximum interfacial free energy of metal species.175 Due to the insufficient coordination of metal atoms and sparse valence electron quantum confinement, the active interaction between the metal network and the support interface in MSACs endows the catalyst with unique physicochemical properties and intrinsic activity.176 Additionally, the anchoring of MSACs on catalytic supports via strong chemical coordination bonds not only can maintain high interfacial synergy and stability of the central atoms, but also enhance the catalytic kinetics of energy storage systems and act as bridges for charge transfer.177 In 2019, Qiao's group prepared high loading (≈5.3%) adjacent single Co atoms implanted in graphene oxide (adjacent Co/GO) for the first time, was acting as a highly active and durable cathode via the acid leaching method for Li–CO2 batteries.178 The XANES spectra and Fourier-transformed Co K-edge EXAFS spectra indicated that the Co–O bond and Co–Co bond simultaneously existed in the adjacent Co/GO. Alternatively, only Co–O bond existed in the other samples (Fig. 15a). Among them, statistical analysis revealed that the average distance of the contiguous Co–Co in the adjacent Co/GO is about 1.79 Å. The existence of Co-dimers provided continuous catalytic sites for the CO2RR and CO2ER, and thus enhanced CO2 adsorption and Li2CO3 decomposition. Impressively, the adjacent Co/GO as a cathode assembled in Li–CO2 cells exhibited a high discharge capacity (17358 mA h g−1), low charge plateau (4.15 V), high Coulombic efficiency (82.5%) and outstanding stability (100 cycles). Additionally, experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that the Co–O and Co–Co bonds in adjacent Co/GO exhibited a strong synergistic, continuous catalytically active site, which could enable the rapid aggregation and nucleation of Li2CO3 products as well as reversible decomposition (Fig. 15b).

Afterwards, to improve the stability and rate capability of Li–CO2 batteries, Hu et al. successfully implanted high-active single-iron atoms in interconnect-folded N and S co-doped hollow graphene (Fe-ISA/N, S-HG) via a two-step method of π–π stacking complexation and subsequent annealing.179 The unique N,S-HG with abundant pyridine N sites could facilitate electron/Li+ transport and prevent the folded sheet from stacking. Additionally, the abundant S vacancies could favor the anchoring of the single Fe atoms to form FeNx active sites and provide ample space for CO2 enrichment and the formation of ultra-small Li2CO3 nanoparticles. DFT calculations revealed that the highly positive charged FeN4 and high-spin redistribution caused by N,S co-doping in Fe-ISA/N, S-HG could induce charge enrichment and a synergistic effect, which could provide abundant active sites and reduce the energy barrier of Li2CO3 desorption, thereby improving the CO2RR and CO2ER catalytic activity. Due to these advantages, the Fe-ISA/N, S-HG cathode demonstrated an excellent discharge capacity of 23174 mA h g−1, small overpotential gap of 1.17 V and outstanding rate capability at 100 mA g−1. More importantly, Fe-ISA/N, S-HG could deliver a low overpotential (1.61 V), excellent stability (over 210 cycles) and superior retention (80.1%) even at a high current density of 1.0 A g−1 and cut-off capacity of 1 A h g−1. In 2021, Zhou et al. synthesized three types of Fe, Co and Ni SACs equally implanted in N-doped reduced GO (N-rGO) substrates by coordination precipitation and subsequent calcination methods.180 Their effect on the catalytic performance for C/Li2CO3 decomposition was investigated in detail. Electrochemical measurements displayed that the catalytically active priority of Fe1/N-rGO was significantly better than that of the as-prepared Co1/N-rGO and Ni1/N-rGO samples. Specifically, the as-assembled Li–CO2 battery with Fe1/N-rGO cathode presented the largest discharge capacity of 16835 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, low overpotential of 1.61 V and outstanding stability for over 170 cycles at 400 mA g−1. In 2021, Cheng's group used DFT calculation to screen the optimal SACs anchored on N-doped graphene (SAMc@NG, Mc = Mn, Cr, Co, Fe, Cu and Ni) for the CO2RR and CO2ER.181 Among them, the projected density of states (PDOS) analysis revealed that the Cr single atom possessed the highest d-band center of 0.372 eV compared with other single atoms (Mn, Co, Fe, Cu and Ni), which meant that the Cr single atom possessed strong chemisorption and anti-bonding states, ensuring a stronger CO2 adsorption strength (Fig. 15c). Moreover, the Cr single atom exhibited the lowest decomposition energy of Li2CO3 (1.674 eV), as shown in Fig. 15d. The DFT results implied that SAMc@NG possessed the best CO2RR and CO2ER catalytic behavior. To verify the effectiveness of the DFT results, six types of SAMc@NG were loaded on porous carbon foam (SAMc@NG/PCF) as cathodes for Li–CO2 cells. Excitingly, the SACr@NG/PCF cathode exhibited the best electrochemical performance, with a voltage gap of only 1.39 V and cycling stability for over 350 cycles at 100 μA cm−2 (Fig. 15e), which was consistent with the DFT results. This work demonstrated the effectiveness of Cr single atoms in enhancing the CO2RR and CO2ER activities and provided a basis for the selection of single atoms for Li–CO2 batteries. In 2022, to address the issues of high charging voltage and high polarization at high currents, Wang et al. designed a freestanding Li–CO2 cathode with Cu SAs anchored on N-doped C nanofibers (CuSAs/NCNF).182 X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy and wavelet transform (WT) characterizations revealed the presence of active centers for Cu–N bonds without Cu–Cu bonds in CuSAs/NCNF, implying the successful synthesis of Cu single atoms (Fig. 15f). The electrochemical results showed that the CuSAs/NCNF electrode delivered a low polarization potential of 1.29 V, high discharge capacity of 14084 mA h g−1 and outstanding stability of 133 cycles at 100 mA g−1. These excellent electrochemical performances benefited from two aspects, as follows: (i) the Cu–N4 active sites could efficiently activate and capture CO2 molecules, which could facilitate the nucleation of Li2CO3 and (ii) the highly spatial structure and excellent electrical conductivity of nitrogen-doped carbon could enhance the mass transfer and improve the kinetics of the CO2RR and CO2ER.
In conclusion, highly reactive MSACs are widely recognized as good candidates for promoting CO2 capture and Li2CO3 dissociation. Advanced methods, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and mass separation-soft landing (MSSL), can be adopted to adjust the size of MSACs with high precision.
3.10. Organic framework catalysts
Organic frameworks can be classified as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are a burgeoning class of porous crystalline materials with periodic network structures. Here, MOFs are composed of common transition metal ions/clusters and organic polymer ligands that are periodically connected and extended via strong coordination bonds. They are regarded as promising candidates as catalytic materials due to their regular pore structure, high porosity, large specific surface area, tunable pore size and diverse topology.183,184 Identically, the rational design and regulation of the structure and pore size of MOFs are ideal pathways to optimize the transport of Li+ and CO2 and increase the nucleation area.185 In addition, the combination of metal-active MOFs with traditional cathode materials can optimize the nucleation and incipient deposition of nanostructured Li2CO3 and propel the decomposition of Li2CO3 during the charge process.186 Li et al. designed a variety of porous MOFs based on transition metals (Mn2(dobdc), Ni2(dobdc), Co2(dobdc), Mn(bdc), Cu(bdc), Fe(bdc), Mn(HCOO)2, and Mn(C2H2N3)2) by taking advantage of the structural and functional advantages of highly monodispersed catalytic metal centers and regularly arranged pores of MOFs, and investigated the relationship between their structures and catalytic performance in the Li–CO2 cell system.187 As shown in Fig. 16a, the representative crystal structures and discharge–charge profiles of the prepared MOFs demonstrated that the Mn2(dobdc) and Mn(bdc) possessed extremely low charging voltage of 3.96 V and 4.19 V, respectively. These values were significantly better than that of Ni2(dobdc) (4.59 V), Co2(dobdc) (4.53 V), Cu(bdc) (4.53 V) and Fe(bdc) (4.46 V) at 50 mA g−1 with a cut-off capacity of 1000 mA h g−1, speculating that Mn(II) central sites may play a key role in the CO2ER. After adequate characterization and analysis, guidance and recommendations for the selection of optimal MOFs in Li–CO2 systems are presented as follows: (i) Mn(II) metal sites can mitigate the charging potential and promote the efficient decomposition of Li2CO3; (ii) rich porosity determines the nucleation of Li2CO3 and improves the upper limit of the discharge capacity; and (iii) moderate isosteric heat shows greater potential for CO2 adsorption and negligible charge polarization at high current densities. Despite the fact that the as-prepared catalysts exhibited outstanding cycling stability and rate capability, the morphology and size of MOFs are difficult to control, and the low space utilization and high weight density of powder catalysts still limit the development of Li–CO2 batteries. To tackle the aforementioned issues, Li et al. firstly regulated the morphology and size of MOFs by adjusting the competing sites between two organic ligands, and finally fabricated ultrafine MnO nanoparticles embedded in N-doped mesoporous carbon nanofibers (MnO@NMCNFs).188 The MnO@NMCNFs as a cathode showed good interface accessibility, high conductivity and catalytic activity, and excellent flexibility due to the prominent mechanical strength of the carbon nanofiber matrix, extensive Mn(II) active sites, and abundant mesopores. Furthermore, the MnO@NMCNFs could maintain stability for over 50 cycles at 1 mA h cm−2 and impressively low overpotential of 0.73 V. In addition, the poor electrical conductivity and insulating properties of the MOF structures severely limit the cycle life and charge–discharge performance of the Li–CO2 battery. Dong et al. considered that the design and development of highly active and stable MOF-based cathodes should meet the following three requirements: (i) fast Li+/electron transfer; (ii) strong CO2 capture capability; and (iii) outstanding CO2RR and CO2ER characteristics.189 The previous two points determine the voltage hysteresis and polarization of the MOF structures in the battery under large currents, and the third point guarantees the catalytic stability of the materials during repeated deposition and rapid decomposition of Li2CO3. Based on the above-mentioned fundamentals, this research team used the self-assembled transition metal (Mn and Co ions) and 5,10,15,20-tetra(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)porphyrin (TPzP) ligands to synthesize bimetallic MOF-based (MnTPzP-Mn) cathodes.189 MnTPzP-Mn as a cathode exhibited a low charge–discharge potential gap of 1.05 V and discharge capacity of 14025 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Impressively, MnTPzP-Mn could be cycled for up to 90 cycles at 200 mA g−1 with a limited capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 due to its bimetallic activity. Among them, the metal coordination pyrazole (Mn-Pz) sites could enhance the Li+ transport and promote the decomposition of Li2CO3, while the metalloporphyrin (Mn-Por) sites contributed to the activation of aprotic CO2. Their work provided a new basis for improving the stability of MOF structures and revealed the catalytic active sites in Li–CO2 batteries.

Similar to MOFs, COFs are a class of porous crystalline polymers with covalently-bonded framework structures, which have been widely studied in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis,190 energy storage,191 and optoelectronics192 because of their high stability, low density, open channels, easy modification, and functionalization. Previous studies have shown that COFs structures can be functionalized with a variety of functional groups and metal sites, providing rational ion channels for trapping gas molecules.193 In 2019, Huang et al. employed the Schiff base reaction between terephthalaldehyde and 1,3,5-triphenyl(4-aminophenyl) benzene to in situ grow uniform and thin imine COFs on graphene for the first time and applied them in an Li–CO2 battery.194 The Nernst equation prediction and experiments showed that the graphene@COF structures could confine and enrich CO2 in their micropore space and form a local high concentration of CO2 to enhance the discharge voltage. Additionally, CO2 under the pore constraint of graphene@COF could induce the homogeneous deposition of Li+ and CO32− to form smaller Li2CO3 particles, making it easier to decompose in the CO2ER reaction, and thereby reducing the charging voltage. Graphene@COF as a cathode exhibited an overpotential of 1.7 V and maintained a charging potential of 3.54 V for 56 cycles at 500 mA g−1.
To determine the reason for the lack of interconnected gas channels and kinetic sluggishness in electrode materials, Xie's group developed COFs as cathodes, which were constructed from molecular units of hydrazine/hydrazide for CO2 diffusion and Li+ transport (Fig. 16b).195 As shown in Fig. 16c, the pores of the hydrazine-linked COFs (Tf-DHzOPr) are surrounded by functional groups of ketone oxygen and imine nitrogen atoms, which are coordinated with hydrazide–Ru nanoparticle-decorated carbon nanotubes. The synergistic interaction of these coordination bonds allows simultaneous transport of ions and CO2 gas, reducing the polarization and rapid decomposition of Li2CO3 during the charging process. The Li–CO2 battery with Tf-DHzOPr as a cathode showed a low overpotential of 1.24 V and an ultra-high discharge capacity of 27348 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1. Furthermore, realizing precisely controllable catalytic centers with uniformly dispersed single-metal active sites and ordered channels has become an attractive path for Li–CO2 cells. Zhang et al. designed a tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)-porphinato-M [TAPP-M, (M = 2H, Cu, Co, Mn, and Ni)] covalently combined with electron-donating TTF ligands to form a porphyrin-group covalent organic framework (TTCOF-M) for exploring Li–CO2 catalytic activity (Fig. 16d).196 After experimental exploration and optimization, the TAPP-Mn single catalytic sites exhibited better electron transfer efficiency and CO2 adsorption capacity than other metal sites, which are beneficial to build a better active and stable Li–CO2 system. The TTCOF-Mn electrode shown a terminal voltage gap of 1.07 V at 100 mA g−1 and over 180 cycles at 300 mA g−1. The DFT results (Fig. 16e) showed that the distance between the Mn site and the O atom provided by CO2 in CO2@Tapp-Mn forms a negative free energy, implying that the CO2 adsorption is spontaneous. In contrast, the other TAPP-M (Cu, Co, and Ni) was unfavorable for the CO2 adsorption thermodynamics. Additionally, the single-metal TAPP-Mn site could efficiently capture CO2 and realize a four-electron pathway (Fig. 16f) to generate C and Li2CO3 during the charge/discharge processes. This research opened a new path for optimizing the catalytic sites and reaction routes in Li–CO2 battery systems. Subsequently, Jiang et al. fabricated an ultrathin MnO2 and quinone-COF hybrid nanosheet (MnO2/DQTP-COF-NS-3) with a thickness of 1.87 nm using a KMnO4-based chemical exfoliation method (Fig. 16g).197 Here, the 1D channels of quinone-based COF-NS favor Li+/electron conduction and activate inert CO2, while MnO2 could avoid the accumulation of Li2CO3 and enhance the CO2RR/CO2ER kinetics. Due to these favorable advantages, the MnO2/DQTP-COF-NS-3 hybrid material exhibited an extremely high discharge capacity of 42802 mA h g−1 in the range of 2.0–4.5 V at 200 mA g−1. Impressively, MnO2/DQTP-COF-NS-3 exhibited a negligible voltage difference and stabilized for over 100 cycles at current densities in the range of 500 to 1000 mA g−1. Furthermore, the DFT results showed that the quinone group in DQTP-COF first gained electrons to form a reduced quinone group intermediate in the presence of Li+, and then interacted with CO2 to form solid products of Li2CO3 and C.
Based on the previous results, transition metal catalysts play an important role in determining the nucleation structure/morphology of the discharge products, efficient electrochemical decomposition of the products and the corresponding electrochemical reaction routes. Thus, they have a great influence on the electrochemical activity of Li–CO2 batteries. Transition metal catalysts have made great progress in the development of substituted noble metal catalysts in recent years, as listed in Table 3. Furthermore, it can be seen that the composite catalysts, including transition metal oxides (manganese oxides), sulfides, nitrides, perovskites and COFs show an excellent cycling performance in TEGDME-based electrolyte in Table 3. Notably, these catalysts show a high discharge capacity and excellent cycle performance under a high current density, playing a guiding role in the practicability of Li–CO2 batteries. In addition, the introduction of a tiny amount of precious metals in transition metal catalysts and trace oxygen in CO2 gas can significantly reduce the overpotential and enhance the cycle life. DMSO-based electrolytes with large polarity can easily activate the inert CO2 gas, result in small ohmic internal resistance and IR drop, and thus present a high discharge platform and low overpotential. However, DMSO-based electrolytes can lead to corrosion and dissolution of the metal phase, which are not conducive to the improvement of Coulombic efficiency and cycle stability. In addition, single-atom catalysts can exhibit high Coulombic efficiency and cycling performance given that their atomic utilization is close to 100%, which is also worth paying attention in the future study. Nevertheless, as an advanced and novel electrochemical energy storage system, the design and development of efficient and stable Li–CO2 cells are still in their infancy. Therefore, exploring transition metal catalysts with high catalytic activity and long lifetime is crucial for the commercial development of Li–CO2 batteries in the future.

4. Conclusion and outlook
As an ideal candidate to address current energy issues, Li–CO2 batteries possess dual characteristics, including electrochemical consumption of greenhouse gases and conversion of CO2 into energy storage. Undoubtedly, the development and application of Li–CO2 batteries will play a significant role in determining the shortage of fossil energy and global warming in the future. Nevertheless, the current exploration, development and utilization of Li–CO2 batteries are still in their infancy and face considerable shortcomings and challenges, including the large charge–discharge potential difference caused by thermodynamically stable and insulating Li2CO3, insufficient catalyst activity, poor stability, and side reactions caused by H2O and O2 in air. These issues seriously hinder the gradual transformation of rechargeable Li–CO2 batteries from the laboratory scale to economical and practical energy storage devices. Therefore, designing and exploring inexpensive, highly active, and stable catalysts is of great importance to improve the catalytic performance and future commercialization of Li–CO2 batteries. Herein, in this review, we summarized the comprehensive charge–discharge reaction mechanism in O2-involved, H2O-involved, and pure Li–CO2 batteries as well as the latest exploration and design strategies for inexpensive, abundant, and catalytically active transition metal catalysts. Despite the unprecedented progress in previous exploration and research, the practical and feasible application of Li–CO2 batteries are still unsatisfactory and require long-term exploration. Therefore, we discussed and elucidated the shortcomings and future opportunities of Li–CO2 batteries based on the latest research.
(1) The presence of unstable intermediates and discharge products (such as Li2CO3, Li2C2O4, C, Li2O2, LiO2 and CO) on the cathode surface of Li–CO2 cells has been successfully detected and identified by a variety of in situ characterization methods. However, the electrochemical reaction mechanism in Li–CO2 batteries involves complex electrochemical/chemical processes and multiple interfacial reactions because of the relatively open system. In addition, many uncontrollable external factors can also affect the CO2RR and CO2ER reactions, including the test conditions (current density, cut-off voltage and depth of charge and discharge), working atmosphere (H2O and O2), catalysts, electrolyte and metallic Li. Therefore, the charge–discharge mechanism of Li–CO2 batteries is still controversial, and more sensitive in situ spectroscopic techniques and characteristic probe techniques are needed for real-time and accurate qualitative and quantitative analyses. In addition, the electrochemical reaction rate, the transfer amount of Li+ and CO2 and the nucleation rate of discharge products are also need to be detected from the perspective of kinetics. More importantly, the Gibbs free energy of adsorption and formation in the CO2RR and the dissociation energy in the CO2ER must be calculated from the perspective of thermodynamics and the limit potential required for the reaction and the possible reactions must be analyzed and judged. Based on the thermodynamics, kinetics, in situ spectroscopy and characteristic probe techniques, we believe that the electrochemical reaction mechanism in Li–CO2 batteries can be fully elucidated in the future.
(2) Catalytic material design and selection are crucial to improve the sluggish CO2RR and CO2ER kinetics in Li–CO2 batteries. The structure, chemical composition, geometric dimensions (pore size, active surface area and pore volume) and electrode thickness of the catalysts are closely related to the mass transfer rate of Li+ and CO2 and the nucleation of discharge products, which may further affect the charge–discharge performance of Li–CO2 batteries. However, the specific working mechanism of catalysts in electrochemical reactions is not fully understood. Thus, further research is necessary to explore the effects of catalysts on electrochemical reactions, discharge product morphology and nucleation. The formation of heterostructures between catalysts/materials and cation/anion doping can alter the interfacial structure, expose more active sites, shorten the energy band gap, and improve the activity and conductivity of the catalyst. The detailed mechanisms of how they work should also be further studied. In addition, increasing the nucleation space of discharge products on the catalyst surface is also an effective approach for exploring and constructing efficient and stable catalysts. For example, the design and development of ultra-small-scale nanocatalysts can make the utilization of atomic surface catalytic sites close to 100%, thereby increasing the nucleation space for discharge products. Transition metal phosphides should also be considered as good candidates for Li–CO2 batteries due to their fast charge transport, tunable structure, high stability and high CO2 reduction efficiency. In addition, further studies on high entropy alloys formed from five or more approximately equal metals also need to be paid attention due to their high ionic conductivity, adjustable structure and polymetallic active sites. More importantly, to design and develop efficient and stable catalysts for Li–CO2 batteries, we should consider their cost, structure, size, efficiency, band gap and conductivity. We believe that the intrinsic activity of catalysts will play a great role in the development of Li–CO2 batteries in the future.
(3) The development and utilization of efficient and stable electrolytes are an important step to prolong the life of Li–CO2 batteries in an open system. At present, Li–CO2 batteries are far from reaching ideal practicality owing to their electrolyte volatilization, instability and leakage, although considerable progress has been made on the investigation of various electrolytes. A small amount of additives can enhance the electrochemical activity to a certain extent. Alternatively, the lack of sufficient evidence on the effect of additives on the electrochemical mechanism still requires further research to improve the practicality of liquid electrolytes, as follows: (i) withstand the violent attack of superoxide radicals; (ii) do not decompose at higher voltages; (iii) perform good dissolving ability for CO2 and do not react with CO2; and (iv) improve the nucleation of discharge products and propel the rapid decomposition after charging. Quasi-solid electrolytes are an effective choice to avoid the evaporation and leakage of the electrolyte. However, the interface of quasi-solid electrolytes is in contact with gas to generate air bubbles in the open system, which will cause the conductivity of the electrolyte to greatly fluctuate. In addition, as a new type of electrolyte, gel electrolytes can not only avoid the leakage of the electrolyte, but also limit the side reaction of gas on the interface, which is a suitable strategy for the practical development of Li–CO2 batteries. In particular, deep eutectic electrolytes can play an important role in the future development of Li–CO2 electrolytes due to their non-toxicity, high voltage range, thermodynamic stability, and facile synthesis. More importantly, it is significant to explore electrolytes with excellent reversibility that can decompose Li2CO3 well at low temperatures for future application in polar scientific exploration, emergency rescue in cold regions, and aerospace. Specifically, low-temperature electrolytes (such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,3-oxycyclopentane (DOL)) and ionic liquid electrolytes with high conductivity (such as imidazolidinyl ionic liquids containing symmetric cations) that can show good activity and stability in cold regions are the focus of future electrolyte development. It is worth mentioning that ionic fluidity, thermodynamic and mechanical stability, CO2 compatibility and conductivity still need to be considered in the future development of electrolytes.
(4) The durability of metallic Li anodes is also an important factor for Li–CO2 batteries. During the charge/discharge processes, dendrites are formed on the Li metal anode, which can pierce the separator and side reactions can happen between Li and the electrolyte system. These issues will lead to a rapid decline in the electrochemical performance of Li–CO2 batteries. In addition, the formation of an SEI film and lithium dendrite on the interface between Li and electrolyte will significantly increase the polarization of the battery, reduce its cycle life, and even lead to sudden death of the battery, which is a serious safety problem. Therefore, protecting metallic Li anodes is crucial in promoting the electrochemical performance and addressing the safety issues of Li–CO2 batteries. The protection measures of metal Li anodes are as follows: (i) uniform artificial coating on the surface of metal Li to reduce the formation of lithium dendrites; (ii) formation of LiF protective layer without disturbing the electrochemical reaction; and (iii) addition of a small amount of tunneling additive to the electrolyte to enhance the mechanical properties and electrochemical stability of the lithium anode.
In conclusion, Li–CO2 batteries serve as new energy carriers, which are innovative devices for converting greenhouse gases into sustainable energy in a clean and environmentally friendly way. Although there are still quite a few problems and challenges in the design and development of Li–CO2 batteries, we firmly believe that the future Li–CO2 batteries will become the mainstream for practical and environmentally friendly energy storage facilities via the continuous exploration of low-cost and high-activity catalysts, stable electrolytes and the corresponding electrochemical mechanisms.

Broader context
The excessive use of fossil fuels, massive release of industrial waste gas, and the continuous massive emission of CO2 have triggered severe environmental problems and threaten human life. Consequently, enhancing CO2 capture and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions are facile strategies to achieve carbon neutrality. Rechargeable Li–CO2 batteries have attracted considerable attention as they can promote the capture, utilization, and conversion of CO2 to electric energy. This review systematically summarizes the development history of Li–CO2 batteries and deeply analyzes the chemical/electrochemical reaction mechanisms of O2-involved Li–CO2 batteries and pure Li–CO2 batteries. Additionally, the challenges, available solutions and strategies of as-reported transition metal-based catalysts are highlighted. Based on the comprehensive overview of the current research progress, valuable proposals are presented from the perspective of battery composition (anode, cathode, and electrolyte) and advanced characterization methods, providing valuable insights and profitable guidance for future mechanism exploration and practical development of transition metal-based catalysts in Li–CO2 batteries.
