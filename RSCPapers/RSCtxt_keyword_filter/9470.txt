    , Accepted 20th September 2021First published on 21st September 2021AbstractNon-conjugated electrolytes, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO, are developed through the quaternization of diethylenetriamine derivatives with 1,8-dibromooctane, which can interestingly be deployed as low-cost, thickness-insensitive and low-temperature processable electron transporting layers (ETLs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared with PMDETA-DBO with methyl groups, PEDETA-DBO with hydroxyethyl groups leads to better photovoltaic performance in OSCs, as PEDETA-DBO not only has stronger capability to tune the work function of cathodes, but also allows better accommodation of the penetrated electron acceptors into ETLs for efficient electron extraction. Fullerene-based OSCs with PEDETA-DBO achieve PCEs of 10.41% and 9.63% under 10 and 50 nm layer thicknesses, respectively. And the OSCs based on the PM6:Y6 blend achieve PCEs of 16.57% and 15.33% under the thicknesses of 5 and 30 nm, respectively. We reveal that the electron acceptors spun atop could penetrate into the network of non-conjugated electrolytes, wherein the contact doping between the electrolytes and acceptors results in efficient electron extraction with a desirable thickness-insensitive property in inverted OSCs. Moreover, the conversion of tertiary amines into ammonium helps suppress the degradation of non-fullerene acceptors in inverted OSCs. Overall, this work provides a strategy to exploit low-cost and thickness-insensitive non-conjugated ETLs for OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are drawing more and more attention nowadays,1–5 due to their potential as renewable energy source with the advantages of easy processing and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 18% to date.6–14 Even though high efficiency can be achieved, the existing challenges remain for organic photovoltaic materials, such as relatively high cost originating from complex synthetic routes, incompatibility with mild processing and thickness-sensitive property. Inverted OSCs (i-OSCs), in which transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) acts as a cathode to collect electrons from active layers, usually show better stability than PEDOT:PSS-based conventional OSCs due to the avoidance of acid corrosion of ITO.15 To achieve high-performance i-OSCs, the electron transport layer (ETL) plays a key role in ensuring efficient electron extraction and mitigating charge recombination.16–18 Therefore, a series of inorganic materials including metal-oxide semiconductors19–23 and organic molecule-modified metal oxides24–30 have been introduced as ETLs for i-OSCs. To date, ETLs based on sol–gel zinc oxide (ZnO) require high temperature post-treatment over 150 °C to achieve high-performance i-OSCs, which limits their application in flexible devices. Water/alcohol-soluble polymers31 and small-molecules32–35 could be processed under mild conditions. These ETLs usually contain polar groups, such as tertiary amines32 and quaternary ammonium salts,36 which not only ensure the solubility in water or alcohols, but also reduce the work function (WF) of cathodes through interfacial dipoles.
However, most OSCs based on organic/polymeric ETLs usually present low photovoltaic performance if the thickness of ETLs is larger than 10 nm. This would limit their application in large-area fabrication. Moreover, quaternary ammonium salts with Lewis base anions in conjugated polymers or conjugated small molecules can dope electron accepting moieties,37,38 which is beneficial for improving the conductivity and electron mobility of organic ETLs.39–41 Therefore, a series of fullerene,42–44 perylenediimide (PDI)32,45 and naphthalenediimide (NDI)46–48 derivatives have been exploited by improving their conductivities and electron mobilities to reduce their thickness-sensitive property. However, the cumbersome synthesis and purification of these conjugated ETLs also undermine their future applications. In addition, PEIE (polyethyleneimine ethoxylate) derivatives based on quaternary ammonium salts have been developed as ETLs in fullerene-based OSCs,49–51 which interestingly show relatively thickness-insensitive property but the reason is yet not clear. It should be valuable to understand the mechanism, to further exploit new ETLs with low synthetic complexity, but better thickness-insensitive performance for high-performance OSCs.
Herein, we have developed two new non-conjugated electrolytes, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO (Fig. 1a), through the quaternization of 1,1,4,7,7-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) and 1,1,4,7,7-pentahydroxyethyldiethylene-triamine (PEDETA) with 1,8-dibromooctane (DBO), respectively. We reveal that the substituent groups on amines play critical roles in influencing the electron extraction of ETLs. Compared with PMDETA-DBO with methyl groups, PEDETA-DBO with hydroxyethyl groups endows an i-OSC (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) with better PCEs of 10.41% and 9.63% under the thicknesses of 10 and 50 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the i-OSC based on PM6:Y6 as the active layer and PEDETA-DBO as the ETL showed a PCE of 16.57%, and still retained 13.41% when the thickness of PEDETA-DBO was 30 nm. It is because PEDETA-DBO not only has stronger capability to lower the work function of cathodes, but also allows better accommodation of the penetrated electron acceptors into ETLs for efficient electron transport. More importantly, we disclosed that the electron acceptors spun atop could penetrate the network of non-conjugated ETLs, wherein the contact doping between the ETL and acceptor leads to efficient electron transport as well as the desirable thickness-insensitive property in i-OSCs. Overall, this work demonstrates a new methodology and insights to develop low-cost, thickness-insensitive and low-temperature processable ETLs for high-performance i-OSCs.

Results and discussion
The chemical compositions of PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO are characterized by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). It is seen that PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO exhibit two N 1s peaks at 399.5 eV and 402.0 eV (Fig. 1b), which are mainly attributed to the nitrogen in the tertiary amine and nitrogen positive ions (N+) in the quaternary ammonium salt.52 In Fig. S2,† PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO both show two peaks at 68.8 eV and 69.8 eV, which correspond to the Br 3d5/2 peak and the Br 3d3/2 peak, respectively.53 These results indicate that the tertiary amine derivatives react with DBO to produce quaternary ammonium salts in PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO. The calculated N+/N integral area ratios of PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO are 56% and 21%, respectively, which indicates that 56% and 21% of tertiary amines have been converted to quaternary ammonium salts in PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO under these reaction conditions. In other words, there are some tertiary amine groups in PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO.
The WFs of ETL-covered ITO have been measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), which are calculated from the secondary electron cutoff of the spectra (Fig. 1c). Compared with pristine ITO, the WF of PMDETA-coated ITO is reduced from 4.67 eV to 4.23 eV because of the intrinsic molecular dipole from tertiary amine groups and the interfacial dipole between the ETL and ITO,54 and the WF of PMDETA-DBO-coated ITO is further reduced to 3.99 eV due to its polar quaternary ammonium salt groups. It is noted that the PEDETA-DBO-coated ITO presents the lowest WF of 3.93 eV, which indicates that the presence of a lot of hydroxyethyl groups leads to more intrinsic molecular dipole and interfacial dipole although the content of quaternary ammonium salts of PEDETA-DBO is less than that of PMDETA-DBO. Theoretically, the ETL-coated ITO possesses a closer WF to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of the acceptors, and it results in a lower energy barrier and better ohmic contact between the active layer and cathode, which facilitates electron extraction and electron collection as well as the enhancement of open-circuit voltage (Voc).55 Therefore, the OSCs based on PMDETA would possess a low photovoltaic performance because of the highest WF of PMDETA-coated ITO, but the OSCs based on PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO would easily achieve better photovoltaic performance because the lower WFs of their cathodes would reduce the energy barrier of electron extraction, which results in enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF values.
It is necessary for ETLs to possess high transmittance in i-OSCs in order to achieve maximum light harvest in the photoactive layer, and therefore, the transmission spectra of the ETL-coated ITO and pristine ITO glass are characterized and shown in Fig. S3a.† Obviously, the transmission spectra of ETL-coated ITO glass are almost similar to those of bare ITO glass, indicating that the three ETLs are highly transparent in the visible light region. Moreover, the absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films on these ETLs are nearly the same as those on ITO (Fig. S3b†), which indicates that these ETLs would hardly result in negative impact on the light harvest of photoactive layers.
The morphology of various ETL films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S4a–c,† the root mean square (RMS) roughness values of PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO on ITO are 4.07 nm, 2.97 nm and 2.79 nm, respectively. That is to say, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO films on ITO are relatively smooth than the PMDETA film on ITO, which is conducive to forming ohmic contact between the cathode and active layer and resulting in reduced leakage current of OSCs.34 As shown in Fig. S5a–c,† the RMS roughness values of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films on PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO are 0.74 nm, 0.60 nm and 0.22 nm, respectively. All the roughness values of the active layers on different ETLs are very small, which is beneficial for interfacial contact with the anode. Moreover, the blend films on PMDETA and PMDETA-DBO show the distribution of large-size domains (Fig. S5d and e†), whereas the blend film upon PEDETA-DBO exhibits a homogeneous distribution of small-size domains (Fig. S5f†). Therefore, the OSCs based on PEDETA-DBO would possess good photovoltaic characteristics since nanoscale phase separation of blend films is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport.56
Inverted OSCs (ITO/ETLs/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Al) were fabricated to investigate the effects of ETLs on photovoltaic performance. It is noted that the OSCs based on PMDETA-DBO (10 nm) and PEDETA-DBO (10 nm) present a similar Voc of 0.783 V, but the OSC based on PMDETA (7 nm) shows obviously a lower Voc of 0.717 V (Table 1 and Fig. 2a). As discussed before, PMDETA-coated ITO possesses a high WF of 4.23 eV, which results in inferior ohmic contact between the cathode and photoactive layer, so its OSC exhibits lower Voc.55 According to Fig. S6a,† the OSCs show the J–V (current density–voltage) curves with diode characteristics under dark conditions. The OSC based on PEDETA-DBO shows the smallest leakage current density and the largest shunt resistance (Rsh) of 1.74 × 103 Ω cm2,57 while the OSC based on PMDETA shows the largest leakage current density and the smallest Rsh of 5.30 × 102 Ω cm2. Therefore, the OSCs based on PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO, and PEDETA-DBO show FF (fill factor) values of 62.37%, 70.51% and 70.60%, respectively. In addition, the OSCs based on PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO, and PEDETA-DBO show larger and larger rectification ratio with series resistances (Rs) of 6.83, 5.09, and 4.81 Ω cm2, respectively, so they present higher and higher short-circuit Jsc values of 17.84, 18.31, and 18.62 mA cm−2. The EQE (external quantum efficiency) characteristics of the OSCs with different ETLs are shown in Fig. 2b. The integrated Jsc values of the OSCs based on PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO, and PEDETA-DBO are 17.40, 18.07, 18.28 mA cm−2, respectively, which are close to the measured Jsc values with small experiment errors (<3%). Consequently, the OSCs based on PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO show the PCE values of 10.15 and 10.41%, respectively, which are obviously larger than that of the PMDETA-based OSC (8.03%). That is to say, the quaternary ammonium interlayers (PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO) allow enhancement of electron extraction and transport from the active blend to the cathode, compared to the tertiary amine interlayer (PMDETA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to investigate the effects of ETLs on electron extraction of the OSCs with the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend. According to the Nyquist plots in Fig. 2c, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) values of the OSCs based on PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO are 66.6, 17.2 and 11.8 Ω cm2, respectively. Obviously, the PMDETA-based device possesses the worst interfacial contact, largest leakage current and most inefficient electron extraction. In sharp contrast, the devices based on PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO exhibit evidently smaller Rct values, which indicates that these quaternary ammonium ETLs are better than the pristine tertiary amines. Compared with PMDETA-DBO with methyl groups, PEDETA-DBO containing hydroxyethyl groups allows further improvement of the interfacial contact and electron extraction, and reduction of the leakage current in OSCs.

To further investigate the effects of the ETL structure on electron transport, an electron-only device (ITO/Al/ETLs/PTB7-Th–PC71BM/Al)48 was fabricated, and the J1/2–V curves are presented in Fig. 2d. The electron mobilities (μe) of the devices with PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO ETLs were calculated to be 1.14 × 10−4, 4.88 × 10−4, and 7.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is clear that PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO with quaternary ammonium salts are in favour of electron transport compared with PMDETA with tertiary amines. Moreover, PEDETA-DBO with hydroxyethyl groups is further beneficial for electron transport. Therefore, the OSC based on PEDETA-DBO presents the highest Jsc, FF, and PCE values compared to the OSCs based on the others.
Charge recombination is also an important factor that determines the Jsc and FF of OSCs,58 so the dependence of Voc and Jsc values on light intensity (Plight) was studied to investigate the charge recombination in the OSCs with different ETLs. The slopes of the fitting lines are 1.58KBT/q, 1.20KBT/q, and 1.16KBT/q for the devices with PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO ETLs (Fig. 3a), respectively. Obviously, the OSC based on PEDETA-DBO shows the smallest slope value of 1.16KBT/q, which indicates that the monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination in the device is successfully depressed. However, the PMDETA-based OSC shows the largest slope value of 1.58KBT/q, indicating the presence of obvious monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination in these OSCs. In general, Jsc is in proportion to Plightα, where α is an exponential factor. The α values are calculated to be 0.967, 0.984, and 0.993 for the devices based on PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO, respectively (Fig. 3b), which indicates that bimolecular recombination in OSCs based on PEDETA-DBO is relatively weak compared to that of those based on the other two ETLs. Evidently, these results illustrate that PEDETA-DBO with a quaternary ammonium salt and hydroxyethyl groups can effectively reduce charge recombination in OSCs, which results in significantly improved device performance.

Time-dependent J–V curves of the OSCs based on PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO, and PEDETA-DBO have been characterized under continuous AM 1.5G illumination, to investigate the light-soaking effects of the ETLs (Fig. S7a–c†).59,60 The PMDETA-based OSC presents an obvious light-soaking effect, through which its Voc value increases from the initial value of 0.536 to 0.722 V after continuous illumination for 480 seconds (Fig. S7a†). It is reasonable that the WF of PMDETA-coated ITO (4.23 eV) leads to an electron injection barrier between the active layer and cathode,61 thus lowering the Voc in the initial stage. The accumulated charges result in trap-assisted recombination and interface recombination as well as low FF. After continuous illumination, polar PMDETA could orientate and ionize under the built-in potential to further decrease the electron injection barrier and increase the Voc to a stable value after 480 seconds. The OSC based on PMDETA-DBO exhibits a depressed light-soaking effect, and its Voc increases from the initial value of 0.737 to 0.783 V after 180 seconds (Fig. S7b†). Compared with PMDETA, PMDETA-DBO leads to a smaller light-soaking effect and higher initial Voc because the quaternary ammonium salt structure reduces the WF (3.99 eV) and electron injection barrier of the cathode. Interestingly, the OSC based on PEDETA-DBO shows stable Voc and FF values without any light-soaking effect (Fig. S7c†). This result indicates that polar hydroxyethyl groups further reduce the WF (3.93 eV), which matches with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of PC71BM (−3.91 eV), so there is no electron injection barrier and light-soaking effect. Under thick ETL conditions, the OSC based on PMDETA-DBO (30 nm) shows more serious light-soaking effect (Fig. S7d†), and the time that the Voc reaches a stable value is 480 seconds. That is to say, more time could be necessary to achieve molecular reorientation and form an appropriate built-in electric field in the thick PMDETA-DBO film, which would ensure efficient electron movement. However, the OSC based on PEDETA-DBO (50 nm) still shows no light-soaking effect (Fig. S7e†). This result implies that polar hydroxyethyl groups could be in favour of quicker molecular reorientation and forming a better built-in electric field in the thick PEDETA-DBO film, which could result in more efficient electron movement.
To identify the applicability of these ETLs, we further fabricated non-fullerene i-OSCs based on PM6:Y6 and PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F blends. The PMDETA-based i-OSCs with different active layers present obviously lower Voc values than the corresponding i-OSCs based on PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO because PMDETA-modified ITO possesses the highest WF (4.23 eV) (Fig. 4). In comparison with the PMDETA-based i-OSCs, the i-OSCs based on PMDETA-DBO show similar Jsc values but higher FF values (Table 2) because the quaternized PMDETA could result in similar trends with smaller Rs and less charge recombination to the case of fullerene-based i-OSCs. Moreover, the i-OSCs based on PEDETA-DBO exhibit the maximum Jsc and FF values than the others, so they show the highest PCE values of 13.45% and 16.57% when the active layers are PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F and PM6:Y6, respectively, which are also higher than those of ZnO-based devices.

Fullerene-based OSCs (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) with thick PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO were fabricated to investigate their thickness-sensitive property, but the OSC with thick PMDETA was not fabricated because the small molecule PMDETA can't be spin-coated to obtain a thick film. With the increase of the thickness of PMDETA-DBO and PEDETA-DBO, the Jsc and FF values of the OSCs gradually decline (Fig. 5a), which is attributable to larger Rs and more charge recombination under thicker ETL conditions.62 It is noticed that the OSC based on PMDETA-DBO shows sharply decreased photovoltaic parameters, while the OSC based on PEDETA-DBO exhibits slowly decreased photovoltaic parameters. The former shows a PCE of 7.43% with a Jsc of 17.12 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55.02% under a thickness of 30 nm (Table S1†), while the latter still shows a PCE of 9.72% with a Jsc of 18.08 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.14% under the same thickness. That is to say, hydroxyethyl groups on the ETL could be beneficial for more efficient electron extraction, higher electron mobility and less charge recombination compared to methyl groups on the ETL. Moreover, the OSC based on PEDETA-DBO still presents a high PCE of 9.63% under a thickness of 50 nm, which indicates that PEDETA-DBO could be the best thickness-insensitive organic ETL.

Non-fullerene i-OSCs based on PEDETA-DBO with different thicknesses were fabricated to investigate the thickness-sensitive property of PEDETA-DBO. As the thickness of PEDETA-DBO increases from 5 nm to 30 nm, the Voc, Jsc and FF values of the i-OSC gradually decrease (Fig. 5b and S8†), which leads to reduced PCE values from 16.57% to 13.41% (Table 3). In other words, the i-OSC only retains 81% of the PCE value when the thickness increases from 5 nm to 30 nm, which indicates that PEDETA-DBO possesses stronger thickness-sensitive property in the non-fullerene i-OSCs than in the fullerene-based i-OSC because it retains 93% of the PCE value when the thickness increases from 10 nm to 30 nm. Moreover, the Voc values of the i-OSCs based on PM6:Y6 gradually decreases from 0.835 V to 0.816 V when the thickness of PEDETA-DBO increases from 5 nm to 30 nm, but the fullerene-based i-OSCs show relatively stable Voc values along with the increase of thickness. This result implies that there is some undisclosed reason for the difference between fullerene-based i-OSCs and non-fullerene i-OSCs.

To investigate the reason for the thickness-insensitive property of PEDETA-DBO in i-OSCs, we employed time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to analyze the vertical composition distributions of PC71BM/PEDETA-DBO and Y6/PEDETA-DBO bilayers. As shown in Fig. 5c, the signals of C− gradually decrease along with the rise of the signals of Br−, which likely indicates the presence of the intermixed PC71BM and PEDETA-DBO film. Instead, a rapid decrease of C− signals would be expected if there is a clear layer boundary between the active layer and ETL. It is because PC71BM possesses significantly higher carbon content than PEDETA-DBO. That is to say, PC71BM can permeate into the PEDETA-DBO film during film formation of active layers because of swelling of PEDETA-DBO (Fig. 5e). Ideally, the intermixed acceptors can be doped with quaternary ammonium bromide and tertiary amine residues in PEDETA-DBO,37 which leads to high electron transportation capability of non-conjugated ETLs with desirable thickness-insensitive property in i-OSCs. The intermixed region of Y6 and PEDETA-DBO was also observed from the co-existence of signals of C− and F− without obvious signal attenuation, along with the signals of Br− (Fig. 5d). That is to say, Y6 is easier to permeate into the PEDETA-DBO film than PC71BM during film formation (Fig. 5e). Theoretically, the intermixed non-fullerene acceptors can also be doped with quaternary ammonium bromide and tertiary amine residues in PEDETA-DBO,37 which would be good for electron transport. However, the non-fullerene i-OSCs show less thickness-insensitive property than the fullerene i-OSCs, which could result from the instability of non-fullerene acceptors in the ETLs. To assess the stability of non-fullerene acceptors, ITIC was chosen to mix with tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) and triethylamine (TEA), which are typical polar moieties from ETLs, in chloroform solution, respectively. As show in Fig. S9,† the mixture of ITIC and TEAB does not show any color change, and its 1H-NMR spectrum also remains unchanged (Fig. S10 and S11†). However, the ITIC solution with TEA changes from blue to brown (Fig. S9†), and the 1H-NMR spectrum indicates the decomposition of ITIC63 in the presence of TEA (Fig. S12†). It is reasonable that non-fullerene acceptors, made via Knoevenagel condensation, contain reversible vinyl bonds in structures, which could decompose under alkaline aqueous conditions.64 Therefore, tertiary amine residues could degrade the contacted non-fullerene acceptors in PEDETA-DBO. To mitigate this negative effect, organic acids, including acetic acid (AA), hexanoic acid (HA) and palmitic acid (PA), were added into PEDETA-DBO (molar ratio, PEDETA:acid = 1:2) to ensure the full conversion of tertiary amines into ammonium, and suppress the degradation of the intermixed Y6. As shown in Fig. 6, the i-OSCs based on PEDETA-DBO:acids show obviously higher Voc values than the i-OSC based on PEDETA-DBO (0.816 V) at a thickness of 30 nm (Table 3), and the former also possess larger Jsc and FF values than the latter (24.22 mA cm−2). Among them, the i-OSC based on PEDETA-DBO:PA shows a PCE of 15.33%, with the highest Jsc (26.58 mA cm−2), Voc (0.823 V) and FF (68.42%), which could be attributed to its high boiling point and low polarity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a non-fullerene i-OSC has achieved such a high performance under 30 nm thickness of non-conjugated ETLs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we reported a simple, yet efficient strategy to develop low-cost and thickness-insensitive interfacial materials for organic solar cells. The results indicate that the non-conjugated electrolyte PEDETA-DBO with hydroxyethyl groups interestingly leads to better performance in inverted OSCs with both fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors than PMDETA-DBO with methyl groups. It is because PEDETA-DBO not only has stronger capability to lower the work function of cathodes, but also allows better accommodation of the penetrated electron acceptors into ETLs for efficient electron transport. We disclosed that the electron acceptors spun atop allow penetration into the network of non-conjugated ETLs, wherein the contact doping between the ETL and acceptor leads to efficient electron transport as well as the desirable thickness-insensitive property in i-OSCs. Besides, the low tertiary amine content helps to avoid the decomposition of non-fullerene acceptors and improve the thickness-insensitive property of ETLs in non-fullerene i-OSCs. The study not only developed a low-cost and high-performance ETL, but also provided a new insight into the thickness-insensitive property of non-conjugated ETLs in i-OSCs.
