    , Accepted 15th September 2022First published on 26th September 2022AbstractPhenothiazine-based conjugated small-molecular electrolytes (CSMEs) with different numbers of amine groups were designed and synthesized. CSMEs are used to form an electron transport layer (ETL) via spontaneous phase separation in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. During the device fabrication process, a mixed solution of CSME and BHJ photoactive layer materials is coated on top of indium tin oxide (ITO), and a thin layer of CSME, which plays the role of an ETL, is automatically formed between the active layer and ITO, as confirmed by high-resolution Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the BHJ solar cells increased from PzN1 to PzN3 upon the increase in the number of amine groups. However, the introduction of the four amine groups in PzN4 decreased the PCE. PzN3 with three amine groups exhibited the best PCE value of 5.45% without using any other ETL materials. In contrast, the reference device with no ETL materials and CSMEs exhibited very poor performance, with a PCE of 0.4%. This study provides new strategies for the design of ETL molecules that can reduce the number of processing steps required for device fabrication.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have attracted extensive research attention owing to their distinctive merits such as lightweight, convenient fabrication, potential transparency, and mechanical flexibility for roll-to-roll manufacturing.1–6 In recent years, many strategies have been applied to boost the efficiency of BHJ solar cells, such as developing new photoactive materials, refinement of the active layer morphology, and fine-tuning interfacial engineering.7–11 In an inverted BHJ solar cell, interfacial engineering between the indium tin oxide (ITO) bottom electrode and the photoactive layer is considered a feasible method to improve the device efficiency, and modification of the electron transport layer (ETL) is a vital part of interfacial engineering.12–18 ETL is a cathode interface layer and should not only form a good ohmic contact with the active layer to facilitate the collection of charges but should also have proper energy levels for efficient exciton separation and charge transport.19–24
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most popular ETL materials because of its excellent electron mobility, high visible-light transparency, and easy preparation. Nevertheless, the formation of defects and the aggregation of the ETL layer are intrinsic drawbacks. Moreover, an additional step of ETL deposition at high temperatures is also required in the device fabrication process.25,26 Polyethyleneimine (PEI), an insulating polymer with nitrogen atoms, was also used as an ETL material because of its superior effect on reducing the work function (WF) of the electrode. Lee et al. published a one-step coating method in which a solution of PEI and photoactive layer materials of BHJ was spin-coated on top of ITO, without using any other ETL layer including zinc oxide, for device manufacturing. After spin coating, a dipole layer of PEI, which acts as an ETL, was formed between the active layer and ITO. However, the lack of conjugated backbone of PEI would cause poor electron transportability and lower efficiency of the device when the thickness of the PEI layer was more than 5 nm.27 Kim et al. reported the carbazole-based conjugated small-molecular electrolytes (CSMEs) considerably enhanced the efficiency of the BHJ solar cells. They spin-coated a solution of CSMEs and active layer materials on top of ZnO/ITO to provide spontaneous phase separation of the active layer and ETL. However, CSMEs were employed in conjunction with zinc oxide and did not decrease any step in the device fabrication process.28
In this work, we report the design and synthesis of four phenothiazine-based CSMEs that could be applied to provide spontaneous phase separation resulting in an ETL on top of ITO, without using a ZnO layer, to reduce the number of steps required for device fabrication. CSMEs with a phenothiazine-conjugated backbone could form a solution with BHJ active layer materials. The hydrogen atoms attached to the electronegative nitrogen atoms of amines in CSMEs formed hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms on the ITO surface, which boosted the automatic formation of ETL on top of ITO, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The BHJ structures of the donor and acceptor materials used in this study are shown in Fig. 1b. By adding CSMEs to the BHJ, we successfully demonstrated the automatic formation of the ETL of CSMEs on top of the ITO. The device with CSMEs exhibited a reasonable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼5.5% without using any other ETL materials. In contrast, the reference device with no ETL materials and CSMEs exhibited very poor performance, with a PCE of 0.4%. To investigate the relationship between the device efficiency and the number of amine groups of CSMEs, we also synthesized phenothiazine with tethers incorporating one to four nitrogen atoms, with hydrogen atoms attached to them, to enable hydrogen bonding with the oxygen atoms of ITO. Among the series, PzN3 with three amine groups showed the best PCE value without using any other ETL materials. Our study demonstrated that this type of CSME is an excellent ETL material, inducing spontaneous phase separation, which can be used for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells in fewer steps.

Results and discussion
The synthesis routes of CSMEs, from PzN1 to PzN4, are summarized in Scheme 1. 10-(6-Bromohexyl)-10H-phenothiazine (2) was synthesized by the alkylation of 10H-phenothiazine. Amination of compound 2 using isopropylamine, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, and triethylenetetramine produced PzN1, PzN2, PzN3, and PzN4, respectively.29,30 These CSMEs are soluble in a wide range of solvents but are especially soluble in polar solvents such as methanol. The structures of the CSMEs were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution MS spectrometry, as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S5). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the solutions (in MeOH) and solid films of each CSMEs are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the λmax values are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Owing to the same phenothiazine-conjugated backbone, the solutions of each CSMEs in MeOH exhibited almost identical absorption spectra with peaks at approximately 307 nm, with that of the solid film at approximately 314 nm.

In addition, the cyclic voltammogram (CV) spectra of these CSMEs were similar, as shown in Fig. S7 and summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values of PzN1–PzN4 were estimated to be −7.76, −7.74, −7.75, −7.90 eV and −3.65, −3.61, −3.56, −3.63 eV, respectively. Deep HOMO energy levels were found in all the CSMEs, which is beneficial for hole blocking.
To investigate the effect of the number of amine groups on the CSMEs, we measured the work functions of the ITO- and CSMEs-modified ITO. Fig. 1c shows the effective work functions of the ITO with CSMEs as compared to that of bare ITO, which were determined via Kevin probe measurements. Evidently, the effective ITO work function gradually decreased with an increase in the number of amine groups. This originates from the formation of an interfacial dipole moment between the CSMEs and ITO surface via strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which can improve charge transport by reducing the energy barrier at the interface and enhancing the built-in potential of the device. The top layer of Fig. 2a exhibits the snapshots of water contact angle measurements with CSMEs on top of ITO. The water contact angles decreased from PzN1 to PzN4 (PzN1 > PzN2 > PzN3 > PzN4, 50.5° > 47.5° > 45.0° > 40.2°), indicating increased hydrophilicity of the CSMEs. In the second layer of Fig. 2a, the images depict water contact angles of CSMEs:BHJ films (using a single solution), which are similar to the value of that of BHJ itself (PTB7-Th:PC71BM), indicating there is negligible CSMEs on the uppermost surface. The results indicate that the spontaneous phase separation led to the CSME layers being located between the active layer and ITO. We performed high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to investigate the interaction between the CSMEs and ITO surface during the one-step coating process. The results are shown in Fig. 2b and summarized in Table 1. The O 1s core level signals were satisfactorily matched to three peaks: In–O (BE = 529 eV), Sn–O (BE = 531 eV), and O–H bonding (BE = 532 eV), respectively.30 Evidently, as the numbers of amine groups increased from PzN1 to PzN4, the intensity of the peak at 532 eV increased, indicating the enhancement of chemically adsorbed O–H bonds between the CSMEs and ITO surface.

To gain insight into the auto-formation ETL via a one-step coating process, we carried out time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), which could indicate the location of the CSME layer in the ITO/CSME:BHJ structure, as shown in Fig. 3a–d. We tracked the unique ions S− (assigned to PTB7-Th), CN− (assigned to CSMEs), and InO− (assigned to ITO) to determine the location of CSMEs. CN− ions accumulated with a considerable intensity between the ITO surface and BHJ layer, indicating that the CSME layer was automatically generated after spin-coating one solution of CSME and BHJ materials on top of ITO. This phenomenon of spontaneous phase separation may be ascribed to the strong hydrogen bonding of the CSMEs with oxygen on the ITO surface.

We fabricated solar cells with a structure of ITO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM:CSMEs/MoOx/Ag via spontaneous phase separation to determine the effect of CSMEs with different numbers of amine groups on solar cell device performance. We also prepared a reference device with the structure ITO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag. The J–V characteristics and incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs) for CSMEs in BHJ solar cells are plotted in Fig. 4a and b and summarized in Table 2. J–V measurements were performed under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) irradiation conditions.

The modified device with PzN1 to PzN4 exhibited PCEs of 3.08% (Jsc ∼ 10.42 mA cm−2, Voc ∼ 0.6 V, FF 0.49), 5.02% (Jsc ∼ 15.40 mA cm−2, Voc ∼ 0.65 V, FF 0.51), 5.45% (Jsc ∼ 17.04 mA cm−2, Voc ∼ 0.67 V, FF 0.48), and 3.73% (Jsc ∼ 14.24 mA cm−2, Voc ∼ 0.62 V, FF 0.42), respectively, while the reference device without CSMEs exhibited PCE of 0.4% (Jsc ∼ 11.37 mA cm−2, Voc ∼ 0.11 V, FF 0.33). The device performance with CSMEs exhibited significantly improved data in terms of Voc and FF compared with the reference device, which implies that CSMEs were well formed in the charge transport layer position. As the number of amine groups increased from PzN1 to PzN3, the PCE of the device increased. PzN3 with three amine groups rendered the best PCE with the highest Jsc and Voc, but the FF was lower than that of PzN2. In contrast, despite the presence of more amine groups, PzN4 showed lower Jsc, Voc, and FF values than PzN3. From PzN1 to PzN3, the increase in the number of the N–H bonds in the CSMEs effectively enhanced the hydrogen bonding between the CSMEs and ITO. However, additional N–H bonds of the CSME in PzN4 could result in significant intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding with PzN4 itself or BHJ, which will provide aggregation of CSME between the active layer and ITO to decrease the Jsc and FF values dramatically.31–33 Therefore, finding the optimal number of amine groups in CSMEs is essential for the auto-formation of ETL via spontaneous phase separation to provide high device efficiency, including optimal Jsc value. To further investigate the performance of BHJ solar cells, we checked the Mott Schottky curve of CSMEs with different numbers of amine groups on the solar cells to obtain built-in potential (Vbi). As shown in Fig. 4c, from PzN1 to PzN4, the Vbi of the device increased first and then decreased (PzN1: 0.47 eV, PzN2: 0.55 eV, PzN3: 0.57 eV, PzN4: 0.51 eV), which is consistent with the trend of Voc. The low Vbi value implies inefficient operation, when the operating voltage for the device is higher than Vbi, the efficient extraction of charge carriers would be restricted which is due to the reverse net electrical field in the device.34 We also performed the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of devices with different CSMEs to investigate device electronic properties. Fig. 4d displays the Nyquist plot for CSMEs devices from 1 Hz frequency to 1 MHz. The corresponding fitting values are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). R1 at high frequencies is attributed mainly to the sheet resistance of ITO, considering the contact resistance between the ITO and ETL layer. R2 refers to the carrier transport resistance, which corresponds to the sum of the interfacial resistance between the donor and acceptor in the active layer and the interfacial resistance between the active layer and the ETLs. In Table S3 (ESI†), R1 shows a negligible difference for each device, indicating the complete formation of CSMEs at the interface between the ITO and BHJ active layers.
However, the R2 of the PzN4-based device was significantly higher than that of the other CSME devices. The increase in R2 implies an interruption in the pathways of carrier transport and exciton dissociation. According to previous studies, the formation of charge transfer pathways is determined by the morphology of the active layer or ETL in the devices.31,35 To determine the influence of CSMEs on the morphology of the active layer, we performed Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), as shown in Fig. 5a–d. The morphologies of the PzN1-, PzN2-, and PzN3-based films are essentially identical. In contrast, the PzN4-based film displayed several particles composed of aggregates. This phenomenon of PzN4, with more amine groups, could be explained by the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the NH groups of PzN4 or OH groups of BHJ.35,36 As a result, CSME can achieve high efficiency through effective charge collection by forming an ETL through spontaneous separation, but the strong intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding can produce aggregation to provide an uneven morphology, which increases the interfacial resistance between the ETL and the active layer, and the internal resistance of the ETL. These results are consistent with the FF of solar cell performance.

Conclusion
We designed and synthesized phenothiazine-based CSMEs (PzN1, PzN2, PzN3, and PzN4) containing different numbers of amine groups and applied them to the automatic formation of a CSME layer as the ETL via spontaneous phase separation by spin-coating a solution of CSME and BHJ materials for BHJ solar cells. All the CSMEs provided the interlayers as ETLs between the active layer and ITO surface via spontaneous phase separation, as observed by TOF-SIMS. The hydrogen bonding interaction forces between the CSMEs and the ITO surface were confirmed by XPS. By spin-coating, a solution of CSME and PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PzN3, with three amine groups, exhibited the best photovoltaic properties, with a PCE value of 5.45%. Hence, optimization of the structure of CSMEs as an ETL by introducing an efficient electron-transporting conjugated moiety and modification of the side chain to generate strong interactions with ITO for efficient spontaneous phase separation could lead to a more practical procedure for the reduction of the processing step and large-area device fabrication.
