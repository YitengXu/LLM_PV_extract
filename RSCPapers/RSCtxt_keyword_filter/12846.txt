A comprehensive analysis of structural, chemical, surface kinetics, and electrochemical characterization results of ALD membranes is also presented. ALD is a surface reaction limited method of depositing conformal, high quality, pinhole-free, uniform thickness nanofilms onto planar or three-dimensional structures. Deposition by one atomic layer at a time also affords unprecedented opportunities to engineer surface termination, to form compositionally graded structures or graded doping, and to synthesize metastable phases that cannot be realized otherwise. Indeed, thin ceramic electrolyte membranes made by ALD exhibit enhanced surface exchange kinetics, reduced ohmic losses, and superior fuel cell performance as high as 1.34 W cm−2 at 500 °C. More importantly, ALD offers the opportunity to design and engineer surface structures at the atomic scale targeting improved performance of not only ceramic fuel cells, but also electrochemical sensors, electrolysers and pumps.Joon Hyung ShimJoon Hyung Shim is an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Korea University (KU) and a Project Manager of Green Manufacturing Research Center (GMRC) at KU.

Introduction
Ion-conducting ceramic electrolytes are widely employed as membranes in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which provide an attractive alternative to conventional thermal energy conversion by combusting fossil-derived fuels. Although thermal conversion is typically limited by the Carnot constraint as the upper theoretical limit, fuel cells convert the chemical energy stored in the bonds of fuels directly into electrical energy by means of an electrochemical process under isothermal conditions. Ion-conducting solid electrolyte membranes have the important roles in selectively transporting a particular ion (e.g., an oxide ion or a proton) and physically separating the fuel from the oxidant, preventing combustion while facilitating electrochemical conversion. Thus, conversion is achieved not through combustion but by electrochemical oxidation of the fuel, which yields inherently higher theoretical efficiency. SOFCs operate quietly, have no moving parts, and have a modularity that is suitable for both centralized and distributed generation of power, so they have gained much interest in both academia and industry.
Ionic transport in the ceramics used in SOFCs is facilitated by point defects generated upon extrinsic doping of the parent oxide with either aliovalent cations or metal oxides. Two different ion-conducting ceramic membranes are covered in this paper: namely, oxide ions and proton-conducting solid-oxide electrolytes. Typical examples of the former group are yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and doped ceria, and a typical example of the latter group is yttria doped barium zirconate (BYZ). Using the Kröger–Vink notation, the defect equilibria in these groups of solid electrolytes can be illustrated by reactions (1) and (2) for YSZ and BYZ, respectively, 
(1) 
(2)
The corresponding defect reactions for oxygen and hydrogen incorporation into YSZ and BYZ are also respectively given by 
(3) 
(4)
The Kröger–Vink notation denotes the resident lattice site for the point defect as well as its relative ionic charge with respect to the perfect (ideal) crystal lattice. Accordingly in eqn (1) through (4), Y′Zr denotes a substitutional yttrium atom sitting on a zirconium site with an effective charge of −1,  is an oxide-ion vacancy with an effective charge of +2,  is the lattice oxygen sitting on an oxygen site with an effective charge of zero (i.e., neutral) with respect to the perfect lattice, e′ is an electron with a charge of −1, and  denotes a hydroxyl ion (or a hydrogen bonded to a lattice oxygen) sitting on a normal oxygen site in the lattice with an effective charge of +1. Moreover, the subscripts in parentheses denote the phase in which the point defect resides.
Both YSZ and BYZ offer selective and predominantly ionic transport through lattice defects and offer practically no concurrent electronic conduction largely due to their wide band gaps (>5 eV). Transport of oxygen through YSZ and in other oxide-ion-conducting ceramic electrolytes is facilitated by vacancy diffusion through the oxygen sublattice in the YSZ structure. As indicated by reaction (4), protonic defects in BYZ are associated with lattice oxygen sites. Accordingly, transport of hydrogen is facilitated by proton diffusion through the Grotthuss mechanism in two subsequent steps: the first involving rotational diffusion of the proton around the lattice oxygen atoms and the second involving protons hopping to adjacent oxygen sites.
Because of the highly activated nature of such ionic transport in the ceramics (Fig. 1), the solid-oxide electrolytes require high operating temperatures to obtain meaningful ionic fluxes. The elevated temperature requirements of materials consequently pose major limitations on the stability and cost of SOFCs. Thus, there is a great incentive to reduce the operating temperature of SOFCs. To that end, it is desirable to minimize the thickness of solid-oxide electrolyte membranes in order to reduce cell ohmic losses. However, it is challenging to fabricate pinhole-free ultra thin ceramic membranes with uniform thickness. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is ideally suited in this regard.

ALD is a method of surface-limited cycle-by-cycle chemical deposition used to fabricate nanofilms. The method is based on the sterically hindered sequential reactions depicted in Fig. 2. The reactions initially occur between a substrate surface and a chemical precursor (or oxidant) supplied from the vapor phase onto the substrate and subsequently occur between the deposited layer and the precursor.9–13 One ALD cycle usually consists of four steps: (1) supplying the first precursor to introduce the first surface reactant into a reaction chamber, (2) purging the unreacted precursor from the reaction chamber, (3) supplying the second precursor (or oxidant) to introduce the second reactant into the reaction chamber, and (4) purging the reaction chamber again. The growth cycles should be repeated as many times as necessary to achieve the desired film thickness. At each half-cycle, precursor molecules adsorb onto the underlayer and react to form a new layer. After saturation, no further adsorption or chemisorption takes place. During ALD, precursors are strictly separated using active purging and valving between one half-cycle and the next. The strict separation of reactants enables only precursors and substrates to react, preventing the gas-phase reactions of precursors.

The unique features of ALD provide several advantages over other methods of fabricating thin films.14–16 First, film thickness and composition can be accurately and precisely controlled because the composition and amount of film produced during each cycle are predetermined by temperature and pressure. Controlling film composition at the nanolevel is particularly important because it enables surface terminations to be engineered and manipulated and the compositions of the deposited films to be graded. Second, large-area pinhole-free films can be conformally produced even on complex three-dimensional features, since in ALD, precursors adsorb, react, and saturate in the same manner as long as a reaction site is properly heated and supplied with sufficient precursor molecules for saturation. Such conformal coating of films, excellent control of thickness at the nanolevel, and uniformity in three dimensions are unique features of ALD. Third, ALD enables high-quality films to be fabricated at relatively low temperatures in most cases if sufficient time is allowed for completion of each reaction cycle. Typically, the low deposition temperature (<250 °C) of ALD enables metastable phases and structures to be synthesized and fabricated. This feature may offer numerous opportunities to produce materials with new properties and behaviors, considerably increasing the number of materials available for industrial use. Fourth, compared with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which is sensitive to precursor flux homogeneity, ALD does not require careful control of homogeneous reactant flux since the reaction is self-limiting and stops by itself after saturation.
The motivation behind the development of ALD was the need for a new method of fabricating thin electroluminescent films and high-quality dielectric materials.9–22 In the early 2000s, ALD particularly attracted the attention of the integrated circuit industry as at that time, device dimensions were expected to shrink to below 100 nm with increasing aspect ratios by the mid-2000s. This demand led to the development of ALD processes for metals and high-k dielectric materials. ALD is expected to play an important role in the fabrication, manipulation, and tuning of nanostructures currently of interest, such as nanotubes and quantum dots, because it is capable of producing very thin and conformal films whose compositions and thicknesses are precisely controlled.20,24,25
Recent efforts have expanded the application of ALD to fabricating materials used in various energy conversion and storage devices such as solar cells,26–42 fuel cells,43–66 ultracapacitors,67,68 and rechargeable batteries.69–73 An advantage of using ALD to fabricate them is that it maximizes their functional areas by producing conformal and uniform film coatings on complexly shaped components and circuits. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that directly converts the chemical energy of fuels into electrical energy. Because of their direct and effective energy conversion through electrochemical reactions, fuel cells have numerous advantages, including highly practical and efficient energy conversion at full and partial loading, quiet operation, and low emission of pollutants wherever the fuel cells are installed. Ceramic fuel cells that contain oxide-ion- or proton-conducting ceramics as electrolytes have recently gained attention because of their long-term chemical stability and fuel flexibility. There have been several attempts to use ALD in order to synthesize high-performance fuel-cell components, and much progress has been made on developing electrolytes and catalysts.23,25 Numerous review papers and books have been published on ALD during the last 20 years,9–25 so it would be somewhat redundant to provide a full account of its general features, mechanisms, and advantages in detail here. As interest in ALD has shifted toward energy and environmental applications, several review papers on the use of ALD in energy applications including producing fuel cells have recently been published.23–25 However, no report to date discusses in depth the importance of the unique electrochemical characteristics of ALD films.
Our laboratory has long been involved in the understanding, synthesis, characterization, properties and performance of ultra-thin solid oxide electrolyte membranes for SOFCs.44,48,51,52,57–59,61,63–66 In this paper, we present a review of ALD ceramic electrolytes and also provide an evaluation of the compositional, structural, and electrochemical properties of various ALD oxide electrolytes used as ultrathin membranes in fuel cells in our laboratory.
ALD of YSZ membranes
Synthesis of ALD YSZ
In practical applications, YSZ is the most suitable electrolyte material for SOFCs1,3,4,74–83 because it exhibits excellent chemical stability against oxidation and reduction. However, it requires high temperatures in the range 800–1000 °C to achieve the desired conductivity in the range 0.02–0.1 S cm−1. As the activation energy barrier for the diffusion of oxygen ions in YSZ is relatively high, about 0.9–1.0 eV, conductivity quickly decreases with decreasing temperature. For this reason, YSZ is inappropriate for use at intermediate temperatures below 800 °C unless it is produced as a thin film. Extensive research has been conducted to operate SOFCs at reduced temperatures either by replacing YSZ with other materials such as doped ceria and perovskites, which have higher oxide-ion conductivities,1,3,74–92 or by reducing the thicknesses of the electrolyte layers in order to reduce ohmic losses.44,46,48,49,57,61,62,93–96 Enhanced ionic conductivities and surface properties of nanosized ceramic electrolytes have recently been reported.44,51,52,97–103 Technical advances in micromachining have enabled free-standing membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) to be fabricated and MEA-containing micro-SOFCs to be operated at temperatures below 600 °C,44,48,57,61,94,96,105–112 creating opportunities to investigate the properties of electrolytes independent of electrode effects.
Several studies have previously reported that ALD was used to synthesize YSZ. Putkonen et al. used ALD with tetrakis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)zirconium(IV) (Zr(thd)4), bis(cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium (Cp2ZrMe2), and bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) as zirconium precursors, tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)yttrium(III) (Y(thd)3) as the yttrium source, and ozone as the oxidizing agent to synthesize YSZ.104 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published report about YSZ synthesized using ALD; however, it contained neither measurements of ionic conductivity nor analyses of the electrochemical properties of the ALD YSZ. Shim et al. used ALD YSZ as an electrolyte in SOFCs for the first time,44 and the process conditions used in that study are summarized in Table 1. The ALD electrolyte was synthesized as a ∼60 nm thick, planar, free-standing membrane (Fig. 3(a)). The performance of the SOFC containing the ALD YSZ indicated power densities of 28–270 mW cm−2 and open-circuit voltages (OCVs) of 1.02–1.10 V at 265–350 °C (Fig. 4(a)). Such high OCVs, similar to those predicted from thermodynamic theory, evidence that no pinholes had formed in the electrolyte (even at thicknesses below 100 nm) and that neither electron conduction had occurred nor holes had formed through the ALD membrane. Although the power outputs achieved for these micro-SOFCs were significantly higher than those achieved for the micro-SOFCs synthesized by other groups, the flat, self-standing ultrathin membrane design limited their reliable operation because of thermomechanical instability.62,95,96,108 Further, their absolute power density was too low for practical use since their active membrane area was less than 100 μm × 100 μm, barely corresponding to a power output in the range 2.8–27 μW at 265–350 °C. Su et al. developed a three-dimensional corrugated SOFC structure to increase the area of active fuel cells and achieved higher power output (Fig. 3(b)).48 They found that ALD offered a viable solution for fabricating thin-film electrolytes that had to be deposited uniformly, conformally, and pinhole-free onto the corrugation framework. They used a 1.8 mm2 maximum active fuel cell area to achieve cell performances in the range 680–860 mW cm−2 at 400–450 °C. Chao recently used nanoparticle-supported nanowrinkles to further improve the performance of ALD-YSZ fuel cells to the range of 0.36–1.34 W cm−2 at 400–500 °C.61 They simplified corrugation by eliminating the complex lithographical patterning of three-dimensional trenches. As specified in Table 1, Su and Chao followed the same ALD-YSZ recipe that they had used in their previous work.44,48,61

Structural characteristics of ALD YSZ
The structures of ALD YSZ have previously been characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).45,57,64,65,104 TEM analyses have indicated that ALD YSZ films synthesized using Zr(NMe2)4 and Y(MeCp)3 precursors and H2O exhibited cubic CaF2 phases that were either partially or fully polycrystalline.44,65 As expected, the degree of crystallinity of the cubic CaF2 phase increased with increasing ALD deposition temperature,44,64 which also agrees with the XRD crystallography results36,65 (Fig. 5). It is interesting, however, that Putkonen et al. did not observe any significant dependency of the crystallinity of the cubic CaF2 phase on deposition temperatures in the ALD YSZ films they produced from Zr(thd)4, Cp2ZrMe2, Cp2ZrCl2, and Y(thd)3 precursors and O3 oxidant.104 It is suspected that using O3, a strong oxidizer, promoted the crystallization of the films during deposition even at low temperatures. The surface morphology of ALD YSZ films appeared granular in the AFM topographic images,44,57,104 and TEM cross-sectional images revealed a columnar structure, as shown in Fig. 5.64,65 The columnar grains seemed to be thermally stable, and they did not agglomerate into a larger grain even after high-temperature post-annealing.44,57

Electrochemical properties of ALD YSZ
In addition to the significantly reduced ohmic loss across the ultrathin YSZ membrane in ALD-YSZ fuel cells, their enhanced performances are also rooted in greatly improved surface kinetics. The reported current–voltage data were fitted to the Tafel model in order to calculate ion conductivities and surface exchange rates from the following equation: 
(5)where V is the cell voltage, OCV is the open-circuit voltage, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, α is the charge-transfer coefficient, n is the charge number, F is the Faraday constant, j0 is the exchange-current density, t is the thickness of the electrolyte membrane, σion is the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte membrane, and j is the current density. We compared the ionic conductivities and exchange-current densities that were measured from ALD YSZ during fuel-cell operation44,48 to reference values previously reported by Steele.1 From this comparison, it was clear that the enhanced performance of the fuel cells was due to the improved exchange-current density (j0) of the surface of the ALD films (Fig. 6). Oxygen-isotope (18O) exchange experiments were conducted using secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis on various types of cells including (i) an ALD-YSZ membrane, (ii) ALD-YSZ-capped bulk YSZ, (iii) a YSZ thin film deposited using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and on (iv) bare YSZ samples103,113 (Fig. 7) to determine whether the kinetics of the surface of the ALD YSZ had indeed been enhanced. The resulting SIMS depth profiles were fitted using the analytical diffusion equation derived from Fick's law: 
(6)where D is the diffusion coefficient, k is the rate of surface exchange, h = k/D, cbg is the relative natural background concentration of 18O (approximately 0.2%), and cgas is the relative concentration of 18O in the gas environment during diffusion.98,114 A plot of log(D) versus 1/T for the tested samples shows that all the datapoints fall along a single straight line for all temperatures, indicating that the rates of the transport of ions through YSZ did not vary significantly with the type of deposition method used (Fig. 8). The diffusivities were also consistent with reference diffusivities previously measured by various groups.1,98,103 In contrast, the k values did vary significantly depending upon the type of deposition method used1,98,103,113 (Fig. 8). In general, although ALD YSZ had greater k values than bulk YSZ, reference YSZ, and PLD YSZ, the enhancement factors were different for each temperature. Not even the degrees of enhancement were consistent with those measured in previous fuel cell tests, presumably because the isotope exchange experiments were conducted without the assistance of either charge transfer reactions at the electrode–electrolyte interface or chemical potentials across the electrolytes, where ion incorporation and transport were purely chemical. In either case, we note that surface kinetics can be significantly affected by surface engineering. In particular, we designed graded surface structures on single crystal YSZ using ALD to compositionally vary the Y and Zr content of the top several nanometers of the surface provided pronounced effects of surface engineering on oxygen exchange kinetics.51,66 These results suggest that not only the termination of the very top surface, but also the defect concentration and distribution in the shallow subsurface region are important considerations to enhance surface exchange kinetics.

 Fig. 8  Comparisons of diffusivities and rates of surface exchange obtained using Arrhenius relation. Evaluated samples include single-crystal YSZ (001), surface-modified YSZ (001), and YSZ synthesized using either ALD or PLD.1,98,103,113 Data from ref. 103 and 113 were measured using the same experimental setup. 
One possible reason for the enhancement is the increase in the number of grain boundaries where oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are believed to occur more intensively as the nanogranular surface is introduced with an increasing number of ALD coatings. Previous electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments indicated enhanced rates of surface exchange for bulk YSZ capped with YSZ nanograins during fuel-cell operation.115 The (nanoYSZ capped)-(YSZ bulk) sample was also annealed using a cathodic bias for oxygen reduction in an 18O2 environment. Planar profiling with high-resolution secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was used to observe the samples. More 18O ions incorporated along the grain boundaries were clearly observed on the surface of the (nanoYSZ capped)-(YSZ bulk) sample than observed on the surfaces of the inner grains.116 This observation explains why the ALD YSZ exhibited enhanced reduction during fuel-cell operation as the ALD YSZ formed a 20–30 nm thick nanogranular surface.44,103 This grain-boundary effect, however, was relatively unclear when the sample was annealed either without using an electric field or under nonreducing conditions.115 From the relationship between k and j0, we found that the concentration of charge carriers, i.e., oxide-ion vacancies, plays an important role in the rate of ion-electron transfer onto the surfaces of the samples. The exchange-current density can be given as: 
(7)where  and  are the activities of adsorbed oxygen and oxide-ion vacancies, respectively, and α and β are the reaction orders for the corresponding species and have values between zero and unity.116 Experimental results and computational simulations in a number of previous reports suggest that oxide-ion vacancies are preferentially populated near grain boundaries.117–122 Thus, we can conclude that oxide-ion vacancies are more abundant along grain boundaries, which can lead to increased exchange-current density (j0) or enhanced surface reaction during fuel-cell operation.66
On the assumptions that the oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) occurring along surface grain boundaries dominate the overall surface kinetics and that the reaction rate scales with the lengths of grain boundaries, the enhancement factor, j0, can be estimated as 
(8)where d represents the average grain diameter. Considering that the grain diameter of commercial bulk YSZ is up to tens of micrometers, the corresponding enhancement factor is expected to be about 100–1000, which is consistent with those previously measured for ALD-YSZ fuel cells.44,48 Chao et al. used the enhanced surface kinetics of ALD YSZ to improve the performance of SOFCs.51,66 They modified the surface termination of fuel cells by depositing layers of ALD YSZ that were less than 1 nm thick and that had various Y concentrations onto the surfaces of 100 μm thick polycrystalline 8% YSZ and 500 μm thick single-crystal 8% YSZ (001) wafers. The modified fuel cells had significantly more power output than bare YSZ fuel cells.51 It is interesting that the maximum enhancement (>50% increase in cell power) was achieved using the 14–19 mol% ALD-YSZ capping, and the cell power increased by about 20–40% when the 8–10 mol% ALD-YSZ capping was used.
ALD of other ion-conducting ceramics
ALD of CeO2-based electrolytes
Ceria-based electrolytes have attracted attention as promising alternatives to YSZ because of their higher ionic conductivities and lower activation energies at moderate operating temperatures (i.e., below 600 °C). For example, gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) exhibits an ion conductivity of about 0.02 S cm−2 and an activation energy as low as 0.6 eV at 600 °C.1 A recipe for the ALD of CeO2 has previously been reported by Päiväsaari using tetrakis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)cerium(IV) (Ce(thd)4) and ozone, as a precursor and an oxidant, respectively.123 Gourba et al. used ALD to synthesize CeO2 with Gd2O3 doping for the first time.43 In their work, Ce(thd)4 and tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)gadolinium(III) (Gd(thd)3) were used as precursors, and ozone was used as an oxidant.43 The process conditions they used are summarized in Table 1. They found that the conductivity of the 1 μm thick ALD-GDC films was lower than that of 5 μm thick sputtered polycrystalline GDC films, presumably because of microstructural degradation. Electrochemical characterization of the material to determine whether ALD GDC could be used as a fuel-cell electrolyte was not reported in their work. Ballee et al. first reported ALD of yttria-doped ceria (YDC). They used Ce(thd)4 and Y(thd)3 as precursors and ozone as an oxidant.54 Similar to Chao et al.,51 Fan et al. used 17.5 nm thick ALD YDC (14 mol% yttria) as a surface modification layer on a 200 μm thick 8% YSZ wafer and observed that the performance of the resulting fuel cell was better than that of SOFCs produced with bare electrolytes.58,59 They measured a 300% increase in the amount of power output from the ALD-YDC-capped SOFC compared to the amount of power output from the reference samples.58 They used current–voltage (I–V) and EIS measurements to demonstrate that the enhanced power output was due to improved cathodic reaction on the surface of the ALD YDC.59
ALD of proton-conducting ceramics
Several acceptor-doped perovskites based on SrCeO3, BaCeO3, and BaZrO3 have previously been demonstrated to exhibit high proton conductivities in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere.4,124–126 The dopants tested in those studies included Y, Yb, Sc, and Nd. Proton conductors also based on BaCeO3 have previously been tested as fuel-cell electrolytes in various studies.4,126–128 Proton-conducting oxides have the potential to further reduce the operating temperatures of ceramic fuel cells because the conductivities of these materials are superior to those of oxide-ion-conducting electrolytes. The best performing fuel cell featured a Y-doped BaCeO3 electrolyte and achieved 700 mW cm−2 as its peak power density at 400 °C, the highest performance of any fuel cell ever reported at that temperature, to the best of our knowledge.128 However, BaCeO3 reacts with even small quantities of CO2 and tends to form carbonates that block proton conduction.4 By contrast, BaZrO3 has demonstrated superior chemical and mechanical stability in acidic gas environments,126 and doped BaZrO3 shows higher bulk conductivity than doped BaCeO3 at intermediate temperatures.4 Sintering dense Y:BaZrO3, on the other hand, is a challenging task as it requires excessively high temperatures and long sintering times.129–132 Thin-film deposition processes, especially specialized physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes including PLD, have been used to help solve these problems.4 Films deposited using PVD are generally more susceptible to the formation of pinholes than those deposited using CVD. With ALD, however, pinhole-free thin films can be fabricated over large areas. Recent successes in fabricating Ba- and Sr-containing perovskite oxide thin films133–137 have opened the possibility of using ALD to fabricate proton-conducting-oxide thin films.52,63 Only a few cyclo-pentadienyl precursors exhibit sufficient vapor pressure and thermal stability to be used in the fabrication of proton-conducting-oxide thin films with BaO. ALD of proton-conducting yttrium-doped BaZrO3 (BZY) has recently been reported.52,63 The material was synthesized using bis(n-propyltetramethylcyclopentadienyl)barium (Ba(PrMe4Cp)2) and tris(methylcyclopentadienyl)yttrium (Y(MeCp)3) as precursors. The conditions they used are summarized in Table 1. The synthesized film was tested as a 110 nm thick free-standing electrolyte membrane in a ceramic fuel cell.52 Maximum power densities up to 140 mW cm−2 and OCVs in the range 0.8–1.1 V at 200–400 °C were achieved using ALD BZY (Fig. 4(b)). It is noteworthy that the ALD BZY also had better surface kinetics than polycrystalline PLD BZY (Fig. 9), which is consistent with the Tafel-fitted data obtained from the power density and OCV measurements of the ALD YSZ cell. The exchange-current density of the ALD-BZY film, however, was about 3–10 times higher than that of the PLD films. The researchers claimed that the enhanced exchange-current density seems to be due to either the difference in the surface morphologies of the ALD-BZY and PLD-BZY films or more reaction sites on the surface of the ALD-BZY film than on the surface of the PLD BZY film rather than due to surface-kinetic effects. This conclusion may not be duly warranted since the reference data available for BZY, especially those for its surface properties, are scarce unlike the amount of data available for YSZ. Further investigation into ALD BZY and proton-conducting ceramics is necessary to determine what effects ALD BZY would have on fuel cells.

Summary
ALD is an effective method of synthesizing high-performance oxide-based ceramic fuel cells because only ALD can be used to produce very thin and conformal oxide and metal films that have precise composition and thickness on complex three-dimensional structures. In this work, the chemical, structural, and electrochemical properties of various ALD oxide electrolytes used as membranes in fuel cells were reviewed. ALD of YSZ, the most popular electrolyte material used for SOFCs, has been extensively investigated. Free-standing membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) containing ALD electrolyte films have been developed and tested in operating fuel cells. SOFCs produced with ALD-YSZ electrolyte nanomembranes have exhibited significantly improved power outputs: as high as 0.28–1.34 W cm−2 at 265–500 °C. ALD has previously been used to fabricate ultrathin conformal YSZ membranes as either flat or corrugated thin films deposited onto three-dimensional supports. The enhanced performance of the ALD-YSZ fuel cells is due to not only reduced ohmic loss from the transport of ions through thin membranes but also improved surface kinetics. The surface-exchange current for the ALD-YSZ films was several orders of magnitude above the reference surface-exchange currents for bulk-scale thick films reported in the literature. It is likely that highly populated oxide-ion vacancies near grain boundaries terminating at the external surface are responsible for the observed enhanced performance of the ALD-YSZ fuel cells. Recent reports have demonstrated increased ion incorporation onto grain boundary surfaces under cathodic bias conditions, and ALD-YSZ membranes indeed consist of nanograins and many grain boundaries. However, there is no clear evidence yet for improved rates of chemical exchange, representing the rate of gas-ion exchange in the absence of an electric field. Doped ceria is another interesting material used as an electrolyte in SOFCs because its ionic conductivity is higher than that of YSZ. ALD of both GDC and YDC has previously been reported. An over layer of ALD YSZ reportedly enhanced the cell performance by enhancing surface cathodic reactions when it was used as a surface modification layer on top of bulk-YSZ SOFCs. Proton-conducting ceramic electrolytes have also been fabricated using ALD. A BYZ fuel cell fabricated using ALD indicated a power density of 140 mW cm−2 at 400 °C. The ALD-BYZ film also exhibited higher conductivity and exchange-current density than the BYZ film formed using pulsed laser deposition.

Fritz B. Prinz	Fritz Prinz is the Robert Bosch Chair of Mechanical Engineering and the Finmeccanica Professor in the School of Engineering, teaching in the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering. He obtained his PhD in Physics at the University of Vienna, Austria. His students model and prototypes nanoscale structures to understand the physics of electrical energy conversion and storage. Prinz' students are exploring the relation between size, composition, and the kinetics of charge transfer. They are also interested in learning from nature, in particular by studying the electron transport chain in plant cells. The Prinz team employs a wide range of nano-fabrication technologies to build and evaluate prototype structures. Such technologies include atomic layer deposition, scanning probe microscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. In addition, the group uses molecular scale modeling to gain insights into the nature of charge separation and recombination processes.
