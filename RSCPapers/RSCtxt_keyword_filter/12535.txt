    First published on 13th September 2018AbstractQuantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation solar cells due to the distinct optoelectronic features of quantum dot (QD) light-harvesting materials, such as high light, thermal, and moisture stability, facilely tunable absorption range, high absorption coefficient, multiple exciton generation possibility, and solution processability as well as their facile fabrication and low-cost availability. In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic boost in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSCs from 5% to nearly 13%, which is comparable to other kinds of emerging solar cells. Both the exploration of new QD light-harvesting materials and interface engineering have contributed to this fantastically fast improvement. The outstanding development trend of QDSCs indicates their great potential as a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic cells. In this review article, we present a comprehensive overview of the development of QDSCs, including: (1) the fundamental principles, (2) a history of the brief evolution of QDSCs, (3) the key materials in QDSCs, (4) recombination control, and (5) stability issues. Finally, some directions that can further promote the development of QDSCs in the future are proposed to help readers grasp the challenges and opportunities for obtaining high-efficiency QDSCs.

1. Introduction
Energy is a vital issue concerning humanity in the present and particularly in the future.1 The great consumption of fossil energy has led to a global energy crisis as well as issues of environmental pollution. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore renewable clean energy to help solve these problems. Among such energy sources, solar energy is believed by many to be the most promising renewable energy resource due to its fascinating characteristics, such as an inexhaustible supply and its environmentally friendly nature. For instance, in a single year, the earth's surface can receive 3850 zettajoules (ZJ) of energy from the sun, meaning that the solar energy absorbed by the earth's surface in one hour is larger than the energy used by the whole world in a single year.2,3 There is no doubt that the rational utilization of solar energy is of great importance for humanity in the future. A solar cell is a device that provides the important advantage of converting solar energy directly into electric energy on the basis of a photoelectric effect and can be used everywhere without the need for big facilities, and also it can be upscaled for massive energy production. Benefiting from the distinct characteristics of such a clean, low-cost, and abundant energy source, photovoltaic technology is considered to be the most promising of all the renewable energy technologies.4
Since the appearance of the first crystalline silicon solar cell invented by Bell Labs in 1954, solar cell technology has undergone a dramatically fast development.5 A variety of solar cells have been developed and some have been followed though into industrial production. Typically, solar cells can be classified into three generations according to the materials and technology development.6,7 The first generation of solar cells refers to silicon-based solar cells, including monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon cells.8–10 To date, silicon solar cells are the most mature photovoltaic technology and dominate with more than 90% of the photovoltaic market. The second generation of solar cells refers to thin film solar cells, including amorphous silicon-, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS)-, GaAs-, and CdTe-based devices.11–15 The direct band gap of these materials, in comparison with the indirect one from Si, allows harvesting the light in thin films with a very few micron thickness. Thin film solar cell take advantage of a cost reduction in the manufacturing process due to material saving and the use of a lower processing temperature. Even though second generation solar cells exhibit comparable photovoltaic performance to silicon solar cells, they only possess a small market share (<10%) due to the limitation of the module technology and their stability. The third-generation solar cells are usually defined as emerging solar cells, most of which are still in the scientific research phase.4,16–23 The motivation for the exploration of third-generation solar cells is to achieve a higher efficiency solar cell with the use of novel physical phenomena, materials, and structures that can largely reduce the production cost. Currently, third-generation solar cells mainly include dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), organic/polymer solar cells (OSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and quantum dot (QD) based solar cells.4,16–23 In the past two decades, third-generation solar cells have attracted tremendous research interest and undergone fast development.
In the study of third-generation solar cells, particular interest has been focused on QD-based solar cells,19,20,25–27 motivated by the dramatic characteristics of semiconductor QDs as a light-harvesting material, such as their facilely tunable band gap through size or composition control, high molar extinction coefficient, large intrinsic dipole moments, and their higher light, thermal, and moisture stability in comparison with dye molecules and lead halide peroskites. Additionally, QDs have a number of non-conventional properties, as shown in Fig. 1, such as multiple exciton generation (MEG) possibility, which could enable QD-based solar cells to overcome the Shockley–Quessier efficiency limit of 32.9% for single absorber solar cells.20,28

Typically, QD-based solar cells can be classified into four kinds (Fig. 2): Schottky junction solar cells, p–n junction solar cells (both homojunction and heterojunction), hybrid QD–polymer solar cells, and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).29–31 Among these, QDSCs possess the advantages of a low-cost device fabrication process due to the simple device structure derived from their analogous DSC counterparts.24,26,30,32–42 It is noted that, over the past 12 years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSCs has shown a dramatic improvement from less than 1% to nearly 13%, as shown in Fig. 3. The spectacular development trend of this kind of solar cell indicates its great potential as a promising candidate for the next-generation photovoltaic cells.

In recent years, many reviews about QDSCs have been published. Most of these review articles focused on a single component of the cell device, such as the photoanode, electrolyte, and counter electrodes.24,26,30,32–53 While, a comprehensive overview about QDSCs, integrating their fundamental principles, recent material, and technical advances as well as the limitations of this kind of solar cell still lacking. Hence, this review article presents a comprehensive overview of the integrated development of QDSCs from their appearance to the current state of play. First, we review the fundamental working principle behind QDSCs together with the characterization techniques that are commonly used. Second, a brief overview of the landmark works on QDSCs is presented. Third, we summarize the recent advances in key materials used in QDSCs, including metal oxide electron-transporting materials (ETMs), light-harvesting material QD sensitizers, counter electrode (CE) catalytic materials, and electrolyte redox couple or hole-transporting materials (HTM). Then, we review the recent advances in charge-recombination control in QDSCs, which is a critical factor limiting the performance of QDSCs. Afterward, we discuss the stability issue for QDSCs, which is usually neglected but is very crucial for the development of this kind of photovoltaic technology. Finally, we propose some possible research areas and issues that deserve to be addressed for promoting the development of QDSCs in the future.
2. Fundamental principles of QDSCs
2.1 Basic principles of QDSCs
The concept of a “sensitized semiconductor,” in which a wide-band-gap semiconductor is sensitized with a narrow band gap semiconductor to harvest sunlight and to generate charge carriers, can be dated back to the 1960s.54 On the basis of this concept, devices based on DSCs were preliminarily studied and constructed as early as the 1980s.55 Initially, smooth semiconductor electrodes were used for dye loading. The light-harvesting efficiency of this flat electrode, however, was very low due to the small dye loading amount, and so the efficiency of the cell device was very low. In 1991, O’Regan and Grätzel produced the first breakthrough in this technology by replacing the flat semiconductor electrode by a TiO2 mesoporous film, allowing them to obtain a significant improvement in the loading amount of dye and boosting the PCE of the DSC to 7.1%.56 From that time, DSCs started to draw lots of attention from researchers all over the world, such that the DSC is often also called a “Grätzel cell.”16,57–62 The pioneering work by Grätzel and coworkers is also regarded as a milestone marking the beginning of the investigation of third-generation PV technology.
The great contribution of these sensitized cells is that they decouple the charge generation and the charge transport. In silicon or in thin film solar cells, both processes occur in the same material and consequently the quality of materials has to be high in order to avoid defects promoting recombination. In sensitized devices, charge generation is produced in the dye while photogenerated charge is quickly injected into two different transport media. Thus, a medium only transports a certain type of carriers, consequently decreasing recombination and allowing the high standards for the quality of materials to be relaxed and therefore manufacturing costs to be reduced.63
The architecture of a QDSC is directly derived from DSCs, using QDs to replace organic dye molecules as the light-harvesting material.43 The investigation of QDSCs was initially motivated by the attractive photoelectronic properties of QDs.20,26,64 Typically, as shown in Fig. 4, a QDSC is composed of a QD-sensitized photoanode, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode.30,37,45 Upon light irradiation, the QDs absorb solar energy and electrons in the valence band (VB) of the QDs are excited to the conduction band (CB), generating electron–hole pairs. Then, electrons in the CB of the QDs are quickly injected into the CB of a metal oxide (generally TiO2) electron acceptor under the driving force of the energetic difference in the CB between the QDs and metal oxide, thereby achieving a charge-separation process. The electrons transfer through the TiO2 mesoporous film to the transparent conductive oxide substrate and then to the counter electrode through an external circuit. Meanwhile, the oxidized QDs are regenerated by reduced species of the redox couple in the electrolyte, while the oxidized species of the redox couple are reduced by the electrons from the external circuit under the catalysis of CE. Apart from these desired charge-transport processes, some other unwanted processes, also known as charge recombination, take place simultaneously and significantly deteriorate the solar cell performance.33,38 This is discussed in detail in the following section.

2.2 Characterizations of QDSCs
In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the cell device and get insights into the charge-transfer dynamics at the interfaces, such as the charge-separation and -recombination processes, a variety of characterization methods have been developed for QDSCs. Among them, current–voltage (J–V), incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE), absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), transient absorption (TA), electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (IS), open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD), and charge-extraction measurements are the most widely used characterization routes for QDSCs.

2.2.1. Photovoltaic performance measurements. 
Similar to all kinds of solar cells, the photovoltaic performance measurements of QDSCs consist of J–V and IPCE tests. The J–V curve is usually used to determine the PCE of the solar cell, showing the relationship between the output current and voltage of the solar cell under irradiation. From a J–V curve (Fig. 5), we can directly obtain the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) values on the basis of the intercepts of the J–V curve with the lateral and vertical axes, respectively. The Jsc and Voc values represent the maximum photocurrent and photovoltage output capability of the cell, respectively. In a J–V curve, there exists a point that the product of the photocurrent (Imp) and photovoltage (Vmp), namely the output power (Pmax), is at a maximum. The specific value of Pmax to the product of Voc and Jsc is defined as the fill factor (FF), which is in the range from 0 to 1. The PCE of the QDSCs can be calculated as follows: (1)where Pin is the power density of the incident light.
 Fig. 5  
J–V characteristic curves of QDSCs. 
It should be noted that J–V measurement conditions should be strict and standard to get credible results.65 This is very crucial to allow comparisons of the results from different labs. For example, a proper black mask should be used in the measurement to define the active area and to avoid excess light getting into the QDSCs. Furthermore, the spectrum of the light source should be exactly the same as the solar spectrum (AM 1.5 G), with a Si standard solar cell used to calibrate the intensity of the light (100 mW cm−2, one sun). To render the photovoltaic performances reported by different laboratories comparable, a certified PCE by a third party is therefore very important, especially for record devices defining a new state-of-the art performance. In addition, some other parameters, such as the scan rate, direction, and delay time, should also be carefully taken into account during the measurement.65 It is noted that unlike the case for perovskite solar cells, the hysteresis in J–V measurements is barely observed in QDSCs.
A solar cell can be seen as an equivalent circuit that consists of a light-generated current source, diode, and series resistance.65 Normally, there are two approaches resulting in power dissipation, which are the leakage current from shunt (parallel) resistance (Rshunt) and the voltage loss from series resistance (Rseries). The Rshunt and Rseries values of a device can be obtained from the slope of the J–V curve at the voltages of 0 V and Voc, respectively. These two parameters have a great influence on the FF value of a solar cell, whereby a large Rshunt and a small Rseries will promise a high FF. Generally, recombination reduction can decrease the leakage current, and then increase the value of Rshunt, but also has the beneficial effect of increasing the open-circuit potential. Besides, it is helpful to decrease the resistance of the contacts during charge transport, in order to reduce Rseries.66
Another important photovoltaic performance measurement route in QDSCs is the IPCE, also known as external quantum efficiency (EQE), corresponding to the number of generated electrons (Ne) divided by the number of incident monochromatic photons (Np).7,24,45 The IPCE can be expressed as follows: (2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density under monochromatic light illumination (with the wavelength λ) and Pin is the power density of incident light. IPCE measurements are usually used to confirm the photoresponse range of a device in addition to the Jsc value obtained from the J–V test. A Jsc value can also be obtained by integrating the product of the incident photon flux density (F) and the measured IPCE values as follows:45 (3)where q is the electron elementary charge. The Jsc values obtained from the IPCE and J–V tests should be identical for an ideal solar cell, and this is an effective test of the correct measurement of the photocurrent. In addition, the IPCE value is affected by the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron-injection efficiency from the QD to TiO2 (φinj), and the charge-collection efficiency (φcc). Therefore, the IPCE can also be described as follows: IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)·φinj·φcc(4)
The absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency (APCE), also called the internal quantum efficiency (IQE), corresponds to the number of generated electrons (Ne) divided by the number of absorbed photons (Na). The APCE results can reflect the efficiency of absorbed photons by a QD being converted into photocurrent, excluding the effect of the light-harvesting efficiency of the photoanode.24,65 The APCE can be described by the following equation: (5)


2.2.2. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and ultrafast transient absorption (TA) measurements. 
TRPL and ultrafast TA spectroscopy are usually used to monitor the dynamics of charge-transfer processes in QDSCs, including the electron-injection rate from QDs to the metal oxide, the hole-transfer rate from oxidized QDs to the electrolyte, and the charge-recombination rate at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Pullerits et al. carried out outstanding efforts in this regard and their works elaborated the related mechanism of the charge dynamics in QDSCs.67–72
In TRPL measurements, a pulsed laser with a high frequency is applied to excite samples. Typically, single photon counting is used to produce statistics of the decay time. After each laser pulse, the detector waits until the first emitted photon arrives, recording the delay between excitation and emission. The high frequency allows obtaining the PL decay behavior after the accumulation of enough detected events. Then, the corresponding excited state lifetime is obtained by fitting the decay curves of the photoluminescence.73,74 For a sample of QDs in solution or attached to isolating semiconductor films, the photoexcited electrons directly decay back to the ground state through radiative or non-radiative recombination processes. As a result, this lifetime (τ), as determined from the decay curve, reveals the recombination dynamics of the QDs without charge-transfer processes. For a sample of QDs attached to electron-transporting metal oxide films, such as TiO2 and ZnO, the electrons in the excited state can be extracted out via a charge-injection process. Herein, the lifetime (τ′) exhibits the dynamics of charge-transfer processes in QDSCs. The decay curve can be fitted with a multiple-exponential function by the following equation: (6)where τn and An are the lifetimes and weighted coefficients for the multiple components, respectively. In QDSCs, the most common approach is a biexponential function (n = 2). For the multiple-components process, an average lifetime (τav) of photoexcited electrons can be calculated using the following equation: (7)In principle, the charge-injection rate constant (Ket) can be calculated according to the obtained average lifetimes (τav and τav′) using the following equation: (8)
Moreover, ultrafast TA spectroscopy also plays a significant role in revealing the charge-transfer processes in most of the emerging solar cells.32,39,65,75–80 A schematic diagram of the ultrafast TA equipment is shown in Fig. 6. In this measurement, pulses with a certain frequency are generated by a femtosecond Ti–sapphire laser and then split into pump and probe pulses. The wavelength of the pump pulses is modulated by an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and a series of neutral-density filters is used to adjust the power of the pump beam. Meanwhile, the initial probe of monochromatic light is transformed into a white light after passing the crystal of sapphire or calcium fluoride. The pump and probe pulses are focus on the same point of the samples at a certain angle and at different delay times. The delay times (Δt) between the pump and probe pulses can be adjusted through a motorized delay stage. A detector is used to record the absorption (At) at different delay times (Δt) after each pump pulse and the absorption (A0) without a pump pulse. The induced absorbance change (ΔA) can be calculated through At minus A0. Since we can measure the TA spectra at different pump–probe delay times, ΔA can be determined as a function of both the wavelength and time. Finally, the charge lifetimes are given by fitting with the decay curves of ΔA versus time, similar to the TRPL measurement.

2.2.3. Impendence spectroscopy (IS) measurements. 
IS allows decoupling physical processes occurring at different time (frequency) scales. In this sense, it is very interesting for the study of a complete device under its working conditions, as information of the different parts can be extracted from a single measurement.33,65,66,81 IS allows studying the kinetics of charge transport and recombination at TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces. In addition, it also permits evaluating the catalytic activity of CEs in QDSCs. In this measurement, a DC voltage is applied to the system and a small AC signal is used to perturb the system simultaneously. Afterward, the sinusoidal current response is measured as a function of modulation frequency. According to the applied perturbation and the measured response, the impedance value can be obtained. On the basis of a well-developed equivalent circuit, the electrochemical parameters, such as series resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), recombination resistance (Rrec), and diffusion resistance (Zw), can be obtained by fitting the data with software.66,81 The IS results are often expressed in a complex plane plot (imaginary part of impedance vs. real part) or a Bode plot showing the parameter of interest vs. frequency. Typically, two semicircles can be found in a complex plane impedance plot for QDSCs. The Rs can be obtained from the starting point of the plot. The first semicircle at high frequency is assigned to the Rct at the CE/electrolyte interface, while the second semicircle at middle and low frequency refers to the Rct or Rrec, depending on the applied bias, at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces. Finally, the electrochemical properties of the materials or the interfaces can be analyzed according to the obtained electrochemical parameters.


2.2.4. Open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) measurements. 
The OCVD measurement is an alternative tool that is commonly used to obtain the electron lifetime (τn) of excited electrons in DSCs or QDSCs.82,83 Typically, in this measurement, the cell is first illuminated under open-circuit conditions for a certain period to get to a steady Voc. Then, the light is turned off and the output Voc is traced as a function of time. The Voc decay rate is directly related to the electron lifetime of the cell since the variation of Voc after turning off the light is determined by the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons. The corresponding τn can be calculated according to the following equation: (9)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature (298.15 K), and e is the elementary charge. The OCVD test can be used to estimate the whole degree of charge recombination in QDSCs. During the measurement, once the light is turned off, the decay of the Voc is determined by the rate constant of charge recombination at TiO2/QD/electrolyte interfaces. Therefore, we can evaluate the charge-recombination dynamics in solar cells according to the calculated electron lifetime from the decay curves.


2.2.5. Charge-extraction measurements. 
For DSCs and QDSCs, charge-extraction measurement is usually applied to indicate the shift of the Fermi level of an electron-transporting metal oxide, which is an important factor affecting the Voc of devices.84–86 At the beginning of the measurement, the device is illuminated and kept at open-circuit conditions. Afterward, the light is switched off and then the device is switched to short-circuit conditions with a delay time. Meanwhile, the current is recorded and integrated versus time to obtain the amount of extracted charge (Qoc). The obtained Qoc can reflect the density states of the metal oxide film electrode and therefore can be used to estimate the shift of its Fermi level.

3. Brief history of the evolution of QDSCs
Dating from the 1970s, researchers found that the efficiency of charge separation can be increased by contacting the semiconductor particle with another kind of semiconductor.87–94 For example, in 1984, Grätzel et al. demonstrated that the combination of CdS and TiO2 could increase the yield of H2 generation from H2S, benefiting from electron transfer from the conduction band of CdS to that of TiO2 particles.87 Gerischer et al. introduced the concept of dye sensitization to semiconductor sensitization. They deposited CdS on TiO2 and found that the photocurrent of the electrode was improved due to the extended light-absorption range.88 These works established the initial concept of the present QDSCs. Since then, many kinds of light-harvesting semiconductors, such as CdSe, PbS, CdS, and Bi2S3, have been used to sensitize wide-band-gap semiconductors and their photoelectrochemical properties have been investigated.94
In 1990, Weller and coworkers sensitized a highly porous TiO2 electrode by quantum-sized CdS particles through an in situ deposition approach.91 They also fabricated a three-electrode-based photoelectrochemical cell and obtained a Voc of 0.395 V, a Jsc of 175 mA m−2, and an FF of 0.75 under the illumination of monochromatic light with a wavelength of 460 nm. Then in 1998, Zaban and Nozik et al. deposited pre-synthesized InP QDs on a TiO2 electrode and fabricated a sandwich-type QDSC device for the first time using I−/I3− as the electrolyte and Pt as the counter electrode.95 The photocurrent of the constructed cell device was monitored under the illumination of incident light. This was the first report of an integral QDSC device, even though the final PCE of the solar cell was not given. Afterward, InAs QDs with different sizes were also used as a sensitizer by Nozik's group and an efficiency of 0.3% was obtained.96 Considering the limited stability of QDs in I−/I3− electrolyte, Grätzel et al. constructed the first solid-state QDSC in 2002 employing 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis((N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole-transport material (HTM) and obtained an efficiency of 0.49% under 0.1 sun illumination.97 Up to 2006, QDSCs didn’t draw much attention since their obtained efficiency was much lower in comparison with their analog DSCs.98
The first leap forward for QDSCs was achieved by Toyoda and coworkers in 2007,99 who boosted the PCE of QDSCs to over 2%. In this work, they fabricated CdSe-sensitized TiO2 inverse opal solar cells combined with a polysulfide electrolyte. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that a ZnS thin layer overcoating on the photoanode could significantly improve the solar cell performance. It should be noted that this ZnS treatment has since evolved as an indispensable procedure in the fabrication of high-efficiency QDSCs. After that, Lee et al. introduced a two-step QDs deposition approach, in which a pre-synthesized CdS seed layer was first self-assembled on a TiO2 electrode surface using a bifunctional linker molecule, followed by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) process for the growth of the CdSe layer. This configuration achieved a PCE of 2.8%.100 Then, Lee and coworkers put forward a classical CdS/CdSe co-sensitization structure through a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) deposition approach, boosting the PCE of QDSCs to 4.22% in 2009.101 Grätzel et al. developed a new procedure for preparing the selenide (Se2−) source by reducing the corresponding dioxide precursor in ethanol and then using this for depositing CdSe QDs on TiO2 through a SILAR approach, exhibiting a PCE of 4.18% under 0.1 sun illumination using a cobalt redox couple.102
From 2009, QDSCs started to drew more and more attention due to their significantly improved photovoltaic performance. Fan et al. explored ordered multimodal porous carbon (OMPC) and mesoporous-carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) as counter electrode catalytic materials in QDSCs and achieved efficiencies of 4.36% and 4.81%, respectively.103,104 Xu et al. designed a ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe core/shell nanocable array photoanode, delivering a PCE of 4.74%.105 Meng et al. systematically optimized the structure of a TiO2 film electrode based on a CdS/CdSe QDs system, giving a best efficiency of 4.92%.106 Kamat et al. proposed a doping strategy in QD sensitizers to facilitate the charge-transfer and charge-separation processes. They employed Mn2+ doping in a CdS layer and prepared Mn-doped-CdS/CdSe QD sensitizers, boosting the PCE of QDSCs to over 5% (5.4%) for the first time.107
Since 2012, we have been witnessing a rapid evolution of the record PCE of QDSCs arising from the development of both material and mechanisms following intense investigations. Until this year, the highest efficiencies were obtained with sensitized electrodes, where the QDs where directly grown on the mesoporous electrode by a CBD or SILAR method. However, the characterization of devices using QDs prepared in different ways pointed out a better potentiality for devices using colloidal QDs as sensitizers.108 Nevertheless the efficiency of QDSCs using colloidal QDs was limited by their low QD loading, which limited the light harvesting. In 2012, Zhong's group focused on the utilization of high-quality pre-synthesized colloidal QDs as sensitizers, and deposited QDs on a TiO2 electrode through a capping-ligand-induced self-assembly (CLIS) approach.109,110 This novel deposition method was proven to be capable of realizing a fast, uniform, and high loading amount of colloidal QDs on a TiO2 electrode.74 Furthermore, the CLIS approach provided a way to introduce high-quality QDs as sensitizers in QDSCs, and since that moment, successively higher efficiency records were obtained with colloidal QDs as sensitizers.36,74,85,109–119 Through the exploration of the superior colloidal QD sensitizers and interface modification engineering, the highest PCE of QDSCs has been improved from 5% to nearly 13% during the past 5 years, leading to a huge step forward and making them more competitive with other kinds of emerging solar cells. The evolution of the PCE for QDSCs is displayed in Fig. 3 and the corresponding works are listed in Table 1.

4. Key materials in QDSCs
4.1 Metal oxide electron-transporting/acceptor materials
Metal oxide electron-transporting/acceptor materials (ETMs) are used to construct the substrate of the photoanode, which is the scaffold for the deposition of QD sensitizers in the photoanode. The ETM performs the function of supporting QDs, and extracting photoexcited electrons from the QDs and then transporting them to the conductive substrate (usually FTO).42,47,50,120 Thus, the preferred electron-transporting film should possess the following properties: (1) an appropriate conduction band edge, which will determine the photogenerated electron-extraction efficiency as well as the Voc of the cell device; (2) high electron mobility to facilitate the extracted electron transfer in the film and collection by the conductive substrate; (3) an abundant surface area to afford a sufficient QD-loading amount for efficient light harvesting; (4) chemical stability, low toxicity, and simple preparation. Accordingly, studies on electron-transporting materials in QDSCs mainly focus on these crucial properties. Among the materials, TiO2 and ZnO are the most widely studied ETMs in QDSCs. The representative photovoltaic performances for QDSCs based on different ETMs are summarized in Table 2.

4.1.1. TiO2-Based photoanodes. 
TiO2-Based nanomaterials are believed to be a suitable ETM due to their distinguishing advantages, including good chemical stability, nontoxicity, and low cost.50,120 Among the materials, TiO2 nanoparticle (TiO2-NP)-based mesoporous films are the most commonly used photoanode in DSCs and QDSCs due to their large surface area, facile fabrication, and good stability.120 It is noted that most of the high-efficiency QDSCs ever reported were derived from TiO2-NP (commonly P25)-based ETMs.115,117–119 Nevertheless, it is well known that the electron transport in NP-based films is unordered, resulting in a long electron-transport length to the conductive substrate, therefore increasing the charge-recombination probability. Thus, aiming at realizing a faster electron-transport channel, one-dimensional (1D)-structured TiO2 materials, such as nanotubes (TiO2-NTs),121–131 nanorods (TiO2-NRs),132–140 and nanowires (TiO2-NWs),141–145 have been explored as ETMs in QDSCs to facilitate faster electron transfer to a conductive substrate. It is believed that the 1D structure of an ETM can provide a smoother electron-transport tunnel and thus decrease recombination loss. However, the reduction of the effective area of the electrode decreases the QD-loading amount, thus decreasing the light-harvesting capability, see below.
As early as 2007, Kamat et al. showed that TiO2-NT is superior to TiO2-NP as an ETM in constructing QDSCs due to the better electron-transport capacity, since the large grain boundaries in a TiO2-NP-based film will increase the electron loss during the transport process (Fig. 7).73,146 Shen et al. proposed a CdSe-sensitized TiO2-NT working electrode and constructed a complete QDSC device, achieving a PCE of 1.8%.122 Meng et al. fabricated a CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2-NT photoanode and obtained a PCE of 3.18% with optimization of the CdSe deposition time and the length of the nanotube.128 Zhang et al. applied a short-length and high-density rutile TiO2-NR array as an electrode and sensitized it with PbS QDs to fabricate all-solid-state QDSCs, delivering a PCE of 4.10%.147 Kuang et al. employed vertically aligned anatase TiO2-NW with a branched architecture as the ETM in CdS/CdSe QDSCs (Fig. 8). The branched hierarchical structure was found to favor an improvement of the Jsc value due to the increased light-scattering ability, and a final PCE of 4.2% was achieved.144 Furthermore, they designed a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically branched TiO2-NW-coated hollow-sphere photoanode with a high specific surface area, while maintaining roomy space, further boosting the PCE to 6.01%.145

Although a lot of effort has been devoted to exploring 1D-structured TiO2-based photoanodes in QDSCs, the obtained PCEs are still poor compared to that of TiO2-NP-based ones. Therefore, the potential of 1D-structured TiO2-based photoanodes has not been fully explored. This may be mainly derived from the low QD-loading amount on the 1D-structured TiO2 film, resulting in a low light-harvesting efficiency and severe charge recombination. Therefore, further improvement of the performance of 1D-structured TiO2-based QDSCs should focus on the enhancement of the specific surface area of the photoanode film to therefore increase the QD-loading amount on the TiO2 film.


4.1.2. ZnO-Based photoanodes. 
From the aspect of the electronic features, ZnO seems to be more suitable to serve as an ETM due to its higher electron mobility (130–200 vs. 0.1–4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conduction band edge. These unique properties are beneficial for obtaining higher Voc values.42,47 Hence, much work on ZnO-based photoanode has been reported. However, from the aspect of chemical stability, the ZnO electrode is limited with a lower stability than TiO2. Its amphoteric nature leads to ZnO dissolving in both acidic and basic media, thereby limiting its application in QDSCs. This chemical instability would limit the long-term lifetime of cell devices. Another restriction is that its pre-functionalization would not be possible given the dissolution of ZnO by the acidic carboxylic anchoring groups of the capping ligands on QD sensitizers.
Similar to TiO2, ZnO nanoparticle (ZnO-NP)-based photoanodes were also investigated in QDSCs.149,155–162 For example, Stathatos et al. prepared a ZnO-NP (10–30 nm)-based film prepared in a facile method with the use of an amino double-edged polypropylene oligomer and zinc precursor.160 The film was then used to fabricate quasi-solid-state CdS/CdSe-sensitized QDSCs, delivering a PCE of 4.5%. Meng et al. prepared ZnO-NPs with a diameter of 20 nm on a film and then sensitized this with CdS/CdSe QDs to construct a photoanode, demonstrating a PCE of 4.46%.149 Cao and Tian et al. applied a passivation strategy on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles using TiO2 nanoparticles to reduce the charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface.161 The results demonstrated that TiO2 passivation could not only suppress the charge-recombination process, but also increased the specific surface area for loading more QDs, thus improving the PCE of CdS/CdSe-based QDSCs from 2.38% to 4.68%. They also reported a bilayer-structured photoanode with a ZnO-NP film as a transparent layer and ZnO microspheres (MSs) as a scattering layer for CdS/CdSe-based QDSCs.162 The MS layer could effectively increase the light diffuse reflection so as to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency, and enabling the device to exhibit a PCE of 5.08%. Nevertheless, unlike the case of TiO2, the solar cell performance of ZnO-NP-based QDSCs was inferior to that of the multi-dimensional ZnO-based ones, partially due to the severe charge-recombination losses at the ZnO/electrolyte interface.
Another unique property of ZnO is that it is relatively easy to crystallize and its growth is anisotropic, such that ZnO nanostructures can be easily prepared in various morphologies.47 Accordingly, ZnO nanowires (ZnO-NWs),105,150,163–175 nanorods (ZnO-NRs),176–186 and nanotetrapods (ZnO-TPs)187,188 have been employed as ETMs to construct photoanodes in QDSCs. For example, in 2007, Norris and Aydil and coworkers grew ZnO-NWs on an FTO substrate and sensitized this with CdSe QDs.163 They fabricated QDSCs using I−/I3− as the electrolyte and Pt as the CE, with the device delivering a PCE of 0.4%. After that, Yong et al. sensitized ZnO-NWs with CdS/CdSe QDs through a SILAR approach, improving the PCE of ZnO-NW-based QDSCs to 4.15%.175 Due to the much larger Ksp value of Zn(OH)2, ZnO can be easily converted to ZnS or ZnSe. This property can be used to form QD sensitizers around ZnO through a facile ion-exchange approach. For example, Lee et al. prepared ZnO-NW arrays on an FTO substrate, and then formed a ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocable-structured photoanode through an ion-exchange approach.150 The QDSCs based on this nanocable photoanode exhibited a PCE of 4.54% and a Voc as high as 0.836 V. The ZnSe layer was found to be crucial for achieving high efficiency since it could reduce charge recombination by passivating the surface of the ZnO-NW and upshift the CB of ZnO. Furthermore, employing the same deposition method, they fabricated a ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe core/shell-structured nanocable photoanode (Fig. 9).105 The band gap of the nanocables could be tuned by the Zn content in the ZnxCd1−xSe shell layer. Finally, a PCE of 4.74% was obtained with the use of this nanocable as a photoanode. It is well known that a key problem for ZnO ETMs is that the charge recombination at the interface of ZnO/electrolyte is more serious than that in TiO2-based systems, leading to a poor cell efficiency. However, it was found that treatment of the ZnO surface using TiO2 is an efficient way to inhibit interface charge recombination. For example, Cao and Tian and coworkers found that after the modification of ZnO-NR arrays with TiO2 nanoparticles, the PCE of the cell could be improved from 1.54% to 3.14%.181 The TiO2 nanoparticles not only acted as a barrier layer to prevent electron back transfer from ZnO to the electrolyte, but also altered the surface characteristics of the ZnO-NRs so as to improve the QD-loading amount.

A key limitation for the ZnO-NW- and ZnO-NR-based photoanodes is their low specific surface area, leading to a low QD-loading amount and therefore resulting in a low Jsc value. Thus, a hierarchical architecture comprising long nanowire trunks and short nanorod branches is a suitable choice to offer more sites for loading QDs. Yang et al. reported a ZnO double-layer-architecture-based photoanode for QDSCs, consisting of a ZnO-NR underlayer and a ZnO-TP top layer.187 It was shown that the double-layer strategy could reduce charge recombination at the interface between the FTO substrate and ZnO, leading to it yielding a higher Voc of 0.703 V and a PCE of 5.24%. Furthermore, Yang and coworkers prepared ZnO-TP with diameters of 50–200 nm and lengths of 400–1000 nm, followed by sensitization with ZnSe/CdSe/ZnSe quantum wells (QWs) (Fig. 10).188 The QW-sensitizer-based QDSCs delivered a record PCE of 6.20% and an impressive high Voc of 0.761 V, which was higher than that for device based on ZnSe/CdSe heterojunction QDs (4.02%). A core/shell two-channel transport mechanism was proposed and demonstrated for the QW-based solar cells, indicating that the electron could travel through both the ZnO and sensitizer channel. Up to now, this is the highest reported PCE for ZnO ETM-based QDSCs.

On the whole, the PCEs of ZnO ETM-based QDSCs still lag far behind those of TiO2 ETM-based ones. Nevertheless, ZnO ETMs possess great potential to realize high-efficiency QDSCs due to their unique properties, especially high electron mobility. It should be noted that the obtained Voc of ZnO-based QDSCs is obviously higher than that of the TiO2-based one. So far, the highest Voc for ZnO-based QDSCs is as high as 0.836 V, which is about 0.2 V higher than that of the TiO2-based one.150 Thus, it is necessary and meaningful to further improve the PCE of ZnO-based QDSCs through optimizing the QD sensitizers and interface characteristics.


4.1.3. Other kinds of ETMs. 
Apart from TiO2 and ZnO, other kinds of metal oxides, such as SnO2,153,189 ZrO2,190 and Zn2SnO4,191 have also been explored as ETMs in QDSCs. However, the cell performance based on these ETMs is usually poor, partially due to the unsatisfactory band edge position or the low electron mobility of the corresponding ETM. Among these, Meng et al. prepared highly ordered SnO2 inverse opal films with different thicknesses as a photoanode in CdS/CdSe-based QDSCs, delivering a PCE of 4.37%.153 Zaban et al. demonstrated that the electron-injection process could also take place in ZrO2-based QDSCs.


4.1.4. p-Type metal oxide semiconductors and p-type QDSCs. 
The above-mentioned wide-band-gap semiconductors (such as TiO2 and ZnO), are of n-type, which are responsible for extracting photogenerated electrons from QD sensitizers in a QDSC. Another type of metal oxide semiconductors are p-type, which take the role of extracting photogenerated holes from QD sensitizers in a QDSC. A classic example of a p-type semiconductor is NiO, which is widely used in photoelectronic devices. Copper(I) thiocyanate, CuSCN, is a promising alternative to NiO as an inorganic p-type semiconductor material. Correspondingly, QDSCs based on the sensitization of a n-type semiconductor oxide, like TiO2 or ZnO, are known as standard (Grätzel) cells, while the cells based on the sensitization of wide-band-gap p-type semiconductor oxides, such as NiO, are referred to p-type (inverted) QDSCs. Usually, unless specially specified, QDSCs refer to standard ones. The extraction rate of a hole from a QD to a redox couple will be inherently slower than that of an electron to an n-type semiconductor matrix.39,70,192 This leads to unbalanced charge transport in the standard QDSCs, whereas p-type QDSCs have the potential to solve this problem. Photophysical charge-transfer measurement results indicated that the hole-extraction rates in p-type QDSCs are in the same range as the electron-injection rates in conventional n-type QDSCs.193–195 Moreover, the most promising application of p-type sensitized solar cells is the construction of a tandem configuration, with the combination of a p-type and an n-type, to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit.196
Even though the concept of p-type QDSCs is very appealing, the efficiencies of most of them are very low or not reported,197–199 with one exception being a value of 1.25% reported by Aldakov and coworkers in 2016.193 To date, almost all p-type QDSCs have been based on NiO photocathodes due to the scarcity of transparent p-type nanostructured semiconductors. Recently, CuSCN has been proven to be a promising alternative to NiO as a p-type material scaffold in liquid-junction QDSCs.194 In this report, CuSCN nanowires were used as a photocathode in the construction of p-QDSSCs, and efficient sensitization by CuInSxSe2−x QDs was observed.

4.2 QD sensitizers
QDs are the core components in QDSCs that perform the function of harvesting sunlight and then generating electron–hole pairs.24,26,30 Ideal QD sensitizers should possess the following characteristics: (1) a higher conduction band edge relative to that of the ETM for effective electron injection; (2) a narrow band gap to absorb sunlight over a wide range of the solar spectrum and a high absorption coefficient for high light-harvesting efficiency; (3) good stability toward light, heat, and electrolyte; (4) simple preparation and low toxicity. Apart from the design of the QDs’ structure, the QD deposition route on the metal oxide substrate can also determine the final photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. Herein, we discuss the different methods to deposit QDs on metal oxide substrates and the various QD sensitizers that have been explored in QDSCs. The representative photovoltaic performances for QDSCs based on different QDs are summarized in Table 3.

4.2.1. QD deposition routes. 
Unlike molecular dyes, QDs are larger sized inorganic nanoparticles. It is difficult to tether a QD onto a metal oxide to form a fully covered monolayer due to the lack of anchoring sites on inorganic particles. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain a QD-sensitized photoanode with a high QD-loading amount.36,44,200 Typically, the QD deposition techniques can be divided into two kinds: in situ and ex situ approaches. As shown in Fig. 11, for the in situ deposition, QDs are grown directly on the metal oxide substrate from an ionic precursor solution, including by chemical bath deposition (CBD) and by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) approaches. For the ex situ approach, colloidal QDs are pre-synthesized and then deposited onto the metal oxide substrate through direct adsorption, electrophoretic deposition, or linker-assisted deposition methods.

Due to the distinct advantages of easy processability, good reproducibility, and high QD-loading amount, until now, the in situ deposition method has been the most widely adopted to assemble QDSCs. In the CBD growth route, a bath solution containing cationic and anionic precursors is prepared.97,201–203 By immersing the metal oxide film in the bath solution, QDs can grow directly on the surface of the metal oxide. The growth of the QDs can be controlled by varying the immersion time of the film in the solution as well as the reaction temperature. For the SILAR deposition, cationic and anionic precursors are separated and the metal oxide film is dipped into the two solutions alternatively.101 The growth of the QDs is mainly controlled by the immersion cycles. Although a high QD-loading amount can be achieved by the in situ deposition method, it is difficult to control the QDs’ size and size distribution as well as the density of trap state defects. As a result, QDs obtained through this route usually have a high density of trap states, resulting in severe charge recombination. Therefore, the highest PCE of QDSCs derived from the in situ QD deposition method is only about 7%.192,203
Benefiting from the well-developed QD synthesis technique, high-quality QDs can be facilely prepared through organometallic high-temperature synthetic methods.225–227 There is no doubt that high-quality QDs possess great potential for obtaining high-efficiency QDSCs. The main challenge for the use of pre-synthesized QDs in QDSCs is how to deposit them onto the metal oxide film in a high loading amount. The most common methods to immobilize pre-synthesized QDs onto a metal oxide substrate, include: (i) direct adsorption,95,96,228–231 (ii) electrophoretic deposition (EPD),232,233 and (iii) linker-molecule-assisted self-assembly.36,44,163,228,234,235 In the initial stage, direct adsorption and EPD methods are commonly used to bind pre-synthesized QDs on to the metal oxide film. However, the obtained PCEs are usually low, mainly due to the low QD-loading amount, therefore they are a shadow of the high quality nature of the pre-synthesized QDs.
As already commented, the capping-ligand-induced self-assembly (CLIS) approach allowed the deposition of pre-synthesized QDs onto a TiO2 electrode with a high loading amount.36,74,85,111,113–119 High-quality QDs were first prepared in an organic phase, followed with a ligand-exchange process to obtain linker-molecule-capped water-soluble QDs, which could be then effectively deposited on to TiO2 film electrodes. As early as the 1990s, Alivisatos et al. immobilized CdS and CdSe QDs on gold or aluminum surfaces in virtue of bifunctional group molecules containing thiol and carboxylate groups.236 Later work borrowed this technique to assemble QDs on TiO2 film electrodes in the fabrication of QDSCs.110,163,230,237–240
Despite the advantages of the CLIS approach, researchers still failed to achieve a high loading amount of QD sensitizers on to a TiO2 electrode or to achieve a high photovoltaic performance of the resulting QDSCs. Through improving the ligand-exchange techniques as well as optimizing QD deposition conditions, in 2012 Zhong's group exploited this deposition approach to develop a practicable and effective one to realize a fast and high loading amount of QDs on TiO2 films.109,110 Some special factors, including the choice of capping ligand, excess linker molecule in the final QD solution, and the pH of the QD solution, were found to be crucial to realize effective QD deposition. This novel deposition method was proven to be capable of realizing a fast, uniform, and high loading amount of QDs on a TiO2 electrode (Fig. 12). Since then, the record PCE of QDSCs has rapidly improved to nearly 13% now.112

Although the CLIS deposition approach is very effective for the fabrication of high-efficiency QDSCs, this process involves a tedious additional step of ligand exchange using a short-chain mercapto-alkylcarboxyl ligand as a phase transfer reagent to displace the initial long carbon chain ligands around QDs prepared via an organometallic high-temperature route. The synthesis of colloidal QDs capped with a short-chain mercapto-alkylcarboxyl ligand directly in aqueous media (denoted as aqueous QDs henceforth) provides a straightforward access to immobilize QD sensitizers onto the TiO2 surface in photoanodes. This approach obviates the additional step for ligand exchange, thereby simplifying the QD sensitization process. Attempts at using aqueous QDs in the fabrication of QDSCs can be dated back as early as 2009,241 but no photovoltaic performances were reported. In 2011, Meng and coworker employed aqueous CuInS2 in the fabrication of QDSCs with a PCE of 1.47%.242 Following this, a series of higher PCEs have been obtained through optimizing the deposition conditions (such as pH values of QD solution, introduction of free ligand) and tuning the electronic structure of QD sensitizers, etc.198,211,216,243–248 Up to date, the reported highest PCE using an aqueous QD sensitizer under the irradiation of one full sun light is 8.0%, while a PCE of 8.15% has also been obtained but under light intensity of 30 mW cm−2.249,250 It is noted that the aqueous QD sensitizers were mostly concentrated on CuInS2- and CdTe-based QDs due to the relatively mature aqueous synthesis methods for these two kinds of QDs.


4.2.2. Binary QDs. 
Binary QDs are widely used as sensitizers in the initial stage of QDSCs due to their mature synthesis recipe and well-known photoelectronic properties. A variety of binary QDs, such as InP,95,209 InAs,96 CdS,146,202,251,252 CdSe,99,100,110,200,203 CdTe,206,253 PbS,127,207,213,254–259 and Ag2S,169,210,260–262 have been applied as sensitizers in QDSCs. Among these, CdS and CdSe QDs are the most popular choice due to their simple preparation. Another distinct advantage of the binary QDs is that they can be directly grown on a metal oxide substrate through the corresponding anions and cations in solution at low temperature, enabling a convenient route to prepare the photoanode. However, the key problem with binary QDs is that it is difficult to balance the narrower band gap and higher conduction band edge. For example, the conduction band edge of both CdS and CdSe is suitable for charge separation, whereas their band gap is relatively wide so that their light-harvesting range is narrow. On the contrary, PbS or PbSe QDs possess a narrower band gap, but their conduction band edge is low and their electron-injection efficiency is thus compromised. Therefore, the development of QD sensitizers has turned to explore composite QDs to balance the light-harvesting efficiency and electron-injection efficiency.


4.2.3. Core/shell QDs. 
Since the first report of the wet chemical synthesis of core/shell QDs by Hines et al. in 1996, core/shell-structured QDs have attracted much attention due to their unique properties.263–271 This core/shell strategy has also been shown to be effective in enhancing the chemical, thermal, and photochemical stability because the inorganic shell can provide a more robust protection to the core QDs with respect to typical organic capping ligands.268–271 Furthermore, in core/shell QDs, the band edge alignment of the core and shell QDs enable tuning of the light-absorption range, charge separation, and the recombination processes in QDSCs.
In QDSCs, core/shell QDs were first used as a sensitizer by Lee et al. in 2009.101 In that work, the authors deposited CdS/CdSe core/shell QDs through a SILAR approach and obtained a PCE of 4.22%. It was shown that the re-organization of energy levels between CdS and CdSe formed a stepwise structure of band edge levels, which was advantageous to the electron injection and hole-recovery of CdS and CdSe QDs. Since then, CdS/CdSe core/shell QDs have been widely used in QDSCs and a highest efficiency of 6.6% has been achieved based on this kind of QD sensitizer.192 Kim et al. prepared a PbS/CdS core/shell QD-sensitized photoanode through a SILAR method, showing a PCE of 3.25%, using insulating oxide materials (MgO and Al2O3) as a barrier layer on bare TiO2.272
It is noted that the SILAR and CBD method are not feasible to construct other kinds of core/shell QDs, especially Te-based core/shell QDs, due to the difficulty to prepare a stable Te precursor. In addition, the direct growth route is unable to obtain exact core/shell-structured QDs due to the uncontrollability of the nucleation and growth of the QDs in the confined mesoporous space. Therefore, a variety of core/shell QD sensitizers used in QDSCs are pre-synthesized and then deposited on the TiO2 electrode. On the basis of the band alignment of core and shell QDs, core/shell QDs can be classified into three types: type-I, reverse type-I, and type-II structures (Fig. 13).270 All of these three kinds of core/shell QDs have been investigated as sensitizers in QDSCs. For example, in a type-I-structured QD, the CB of the shell material is higher than the core material and the shell is usually used to passivate the surface of the core so as to improve the optical properties and chemical stability. Parkinson et al. used type-I-structured CdSe/ZnS QDs to sensitize single crystal TiO2 for the first time and found that the stability of the photoanode could be significantly improved compared to the core QD-based one.234 Zhong et al. prepared type-I-structured “green” CuInS2/ZnS QDs through a cation-exchange approach.116 The thin ZnS layer was found to be beneficial for reducing the defect density of QDs and inhibiting charge-recombination processes in the QDSCs (Fig. 14a). As a result, an impressive record PCE of 7.04% was obtained based on the CuInS2/ZnS QDs, whereas the plain CuInS2 QDs-based cell only showed a highest PCE of 5.05%. Zhong's group also reported type-I-structured CdSeTe/CdS-based QDSCs, which exhibited a PCE of 9.48%, which was distinctly higher than the PCE for the plain CdSeTe QD-based one (8.02%). It was shown that the improved photovoltaic performance was mainly attributed to the suppressed charge-recombination rates inside the QDs and at the QD/TiO2/electrolyte interface due to the reduced trapping state defects in the QDs.273

In type-II-structured core/shell QDs, both the CB and VB of the shell material are higher or lower than the core material. As a result, the electron and hole are spatially separated, enabling fast electron transfer from the QD sensitizer to the oxide matrix.270,271 Furthermore, type-II QDs show a remarkable red-shift of the absorption edge due to the effect of the exciplex state. These attractive properties suggest type-II core/shell QDs are promising light-harvesting materials to be used in QDSCs. For example, Ning et al. constructed type-II ZnSe/CdS core/shell QD-sensitized solar cells, which showed an efficiency of 0.27%.217 Kuang's group reported a one-step linker-assisted CBD method to prepare CdTe/CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes, and achieved an efficiency of 3.8%.215 Meng et al. applied a microwave-assisted aqueous method to prepare type-II-structured CdSexTe1−x/CdS core/shell QDs, exhibiting a PCE of 5.04%.247 Zhong's group explored CdTe/CdSe type-II core/shell QDs as a sensitizer in QDSCs using a postsynthesis assembly approach and obtained a record PCE of 6.76% (Fig. 15a–d).74 It was demonstrated that the type-II core/shell QDs could not only extent the light-absorption range of the solar cells, but also accelerate electron-injection and suppress charge-recombination processes. Furthermore, Zhong and coworkers developed another type-II core/shell QDs, ZnTe/CdSe, which possessed a much larger conduction band offset in comparison with that of CdTe/CdSe, and used this as a sensitizer, which led to further improving the record PCE to 7.17% (Fig. 15e).85

4.2.4. Alloyed QDs. 
Compared to binary QDs, ternary- or quaternary-alloyed QD are an attractive alternative to binary QD sensitizers since their optoelectronic properties can be tuned by controlling their composition without changing the particle size, and their band gap has the possibility to be narrower than that of their binary constituents due to the non-linear relationship between the composition and band gap.274–277 Furthermore, alloyed QDs also show higher chemical stability than their constituents due to their hardened lattice structure and decreased interdiffusion.274
The alloyed QDs used in QDSCs are mainly focused on II–VI (CdSxSe1−x, CdSexTe1−xetc.) and I–III–VI (AgInS2, CuInS2, CuInSe2etc.) group QDs. Among these, CdSxSe1−x-alloyed QDs were first explored as sensitizers in QDSCs. For example, Wang et al. prepared CdSeS QDs in solution and deposited them on TiO2 nanowires for the first time, achieving a PCE of 0.6%.278 Hossain et al. deposited CdSxSe1−x-alloyed QDs on TiO2 by alternately depositing CdS and CdSe layers through a SILAR approach, yielding a PCE of 4.05%.279 Kamat et al. designed multiple absorber layers of CdSeS QDs with varying band gaps within the TiO2 film.218 This multiple absorber architecture was found to be advantageous for improving the light-harvesting capability of the solar cells and PCEs of 3.2% and 3.0% were obtained for QDSCs with two and three layers of QDs, respectively (Fig. 16). The main limitation of CdSeS QDs is their narrow light-absorption range, resulting in a relatively poor photovoltaic performance. As another II–VI group-alloyed QD, the CdSexTe1−x QD sensitizer, developed by Zhong's group, showed superior characteristics, such as a wide absorption range extending to the near-IR region, high conduction band edge, and good chemical stability (Fig. 17).111 A record PCE of 6.36% was obtained in 2013 based on this kind of alloyed QD sensitizer. Since then, a series of record PCEs have been reported based on this kind of QDs.113,114,117,118

I–III–VI group semiconductors, such as CuInS2 (CIS) and CuInSe2 (CISe), are considered as “green” light-adsorption materials as they are without Cd or Pb heavy metal elements. In addition, I–III–VI group semiconductors possess several prominent advantages, such as a high absorption coefficient and narrow band gap, rendering them excellent photovoltaic performance in thin film solar cells.11,280–282 However, the fabrication of I–III–VI group light-harvesting materials in thin film solar cells typically is via applying magnetron sputtering or thermal evaporation in a vacuum condition, which is costly and involves a high energy consumption. Therefore, in recent years, I–III–VI group QDs have attracted much attention in QDSCs as a low-cost photovoltaic technology.77–79,221,242,246,283–293
In 2009, Chen et al. used CIS and CIS/ZnS QDs to sensitize ZnO nanowires, obtaining a PCE of 0.71% using I−/I3− electrolyte.288 Meng et al. synthesized CuInS2 QDs in aqueous media and employed them as a sensitizer in QDSCs, achieving a PCE of 1.47%.242 Teng's group proposed a heterojunction architecture using CIS and CdS QDs as sensitizers, boosting the PCE of CIS-based QDSCs to 4.2%.287 It was shown that the introduction of a CdS layer around CIS QDs can extend the optical absorption range and suppress charge recombination. Afterwards, Meng et al. doped Mn in the CdS layer, improving the PCE to 5.38%.246 A key limitation of the CIS-based QDSCs is the low QD-loading amount, arising from the adopted dodecanethiol (DDT) ligand in the QD preparation. Since DDT cannot be completely displaced during the phase transfer procedure, this results in difficulty in immobilizing QDs on the TiO2 film electrode. To address this, Zhong et al. developed a DDT-free synthetic approach for CIS QDs and constructed type-I-structured CIS/ZnS QDs through a cation-exchange approach, boosting the PCE of Cd-free CIS-based QDSCs to 7.04% (Fig. 14).116 Furthermore, they developed a Zn–Cu–In–S-alloyed QD sensitizer, exhibiting a PCE of 8.55%.220 It was demonstrated that the alloyed structure is superior to that of the CIS/ZnS core/shell and pristine CIS QDs as a sensitizer, benefiting from the suppression of charge recombination as well as an acceleration of the electron-injection efficiency. Up to now, this is the best efficiency reported for CIS QD-based QDSCs.
CISe QDs, which possess a narrower band gap compared to CIS QDs (1.05 vs. 1.52 eV), have shown great potential as sensitizers in QDSCs with the possibility to extend the light-absorption edge to the near-infrared region (NIR), therefore enabling obtaining a higher Jsc value.280,294,295 Hyeon et al. presented a new synthetic process for CISe QDs through a Lewis acid–base reaction of metal iodides and selenocarbamate, showing a PCE of 4.3% for the Cd-free QDSCs.292 Klimov et al. reported a CuInSe1−xSx-alloyed I–III–VI group QD sensitizer and achieved a PCE of 5.5% with the aid of a cation-exchange process with Zn2+ or Cd2+ in the prepared CISe QDs.78,79 Hyeon et al. boosted the PCE of CISe QDSCs to 8.1% through optimization of the ZnS passivation-layer thickness and obtained a Jsc as high as 26.93 mA cm−2.221 Notably, Zhong's group explored an alloyed Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QD sensitizer possessing a narrow band gap and high conduction band edge simultaneously, achieving a record PCE of 11.61% when combined with a Ti-mesh-supported mesoporous-carbon counter electrode (Fig. 18a–c).115 It should be noted that this was the first report of QDSCs with a PCE over 10%. Afterwards, Zhong et al. found that the non-stoichiometry of the ZCISe QDs showed remarkable effects on the performance of the constructed QDSCs and that Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs were favorable for the improvement of the photovoltaic performance.222 The PCE of ZCISe QD-based QDSCs was further improved to 12.57% with optimization of the Cu content in the QDs. They proposed that the enhanced PCE was mainly derived from the defect-state-related donor–acceptor pair (DAP) in the ZCISe QDs due to the Cu deficiency (Fig. 18d).

According to the above-mentioned QD sensitizers, it is reasonable to conclude that alloyed QDs, especially I–III–VI group-alloyed QDs, seem to be a better choice as a sensitizer in QDSCs. The reported PCEs of over 10% were mainly derived from I–III–VI group-alloyed QD sensitizers, benefiting from the narrow band gap, appropriate band edge, and facile synthetic process of this kind of QDs. In addition, they also present a better environmental behavior than other QDs containing heavy metals. Therefore, it is believed that the I–III–VI group-alloyed QDs possess great potential to promote the further development of QDSCs in the near future.


4.2.5. Doped QDs. 
The introduction of a dopant in to QDs is another way to tune the electronic and photophysical properties of QDs. The effect of dopants on the photoelectronic properties of QDs and the underlying mechanism have been widely studied.296–301 The effect of dopants in QD sensitizers has also been investigated in QDSCs.107,185,191,203,246,302–312 In 2012, Kamat and coworkers introduced the doping strategy in QDs and studied the doping effect on the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs (Fig. 19).107 They applied a Mn dopant in a CdS core layer through a SILAR approach to form Mn:CdS/CdSe QD sensitizers. The Mn d–d transition was both spin and orbital forbidden, resulting in a long electron lifetime. This unique feature was believed to favor prolonging the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons. As a result, an impressive PCE of 5.4% was obtained and also the cell showed good stability. Meng et al. prepared CIS QDs first in aqueous media and then fabricated a CIS/Mn:CdS-sensitized photoanode by a SILAR approach.246 The obtained PCE for the QDSCs based on the doped QDs (5.38%) was higher than for the undoped one (4.69%). Santra et al. investigated the role of a Mn dopant in QDSCs,307 and demonstrated that the Mn dopant decreases the recombination within the QDs. The long lifetime of the photoexcited electron eventually leads to an improvement of the Jsc and Voc values by raising the Fermi energy to a higher negative potential. Zhong et al. applied a Mn dopant in both a pre-synthesized CdSexTe1−x QD sensitizer and the ZnS passivation layer, improving the PCE of the corresponding QDSCs from 8.55% to 9.40%.312 Experimental results demonstrated that the presence of the Mn dopant could reduce the trap states in QD sensitizers, consequently suppressing the charge-recombination process in the QDSCs. Apart from the Mn dopant, other dopants, such as Co, have also been used in QD sensitizers. For example, Firoozi et al. investigated the effect of Co2+ ion incorporation into CdS/CdSe QDs on the performance of QDSCs, and found the PCE could be distinctly improved from 2.33% to 3.16% with the optimization of the Co doping amount.309

4.2.6. Other QD sensitizers. 
Apart from the above-mentioned QD sensitizers, there are several novel sensitizers that have also been explored in QDSCs. For example, Kamat et al. found that gold clusters with diameters of 1.0–1.6 nm could also inject electrons into TiO2 under visible excitation.211 The fabricated QDSCs based on the gold clusters exhibited a PCE of 2.36% using a Co(II)/Co(III) redox couple as the electrolyte. Bang et al. investigated the effect of the size of Au clusters on the performance of sensitized solar cells.313 They constructed cell devices using I−/I3− as the electrolyte and obtained a PCE of 3.8% using Au18(SR)14 as a sensitizer due to its relatively good light-absorption capability and low recombination rate.
Another kind of novel sensitizer is the carbon QD (CQD), which is more low-cost and environmental friendly.212,314–319 In 2010, Li et al. synthesized solution-processable, black graphene QDs and applied them as a sensitizer for solar cells.318 The calculated band edge position of the graphene QDs was found to be suitable for electron injection and QDs regeneration. The fabricated solar cell exhibited a Jsc of 0.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.48 V, and an FF of 0.58. Ozin et al. synthesized CQDs via the dehydration of γ-butyrolactone with concentrated sulfuric acid.317 The CQDs were employed as a sensitizer in QDSCs and achieved a PCE of 0.13%. Zhang et al. presented a simple in situ strategy of growing CQDs directly onto TiO2 surfaces, obtaining an impressive PCE of 0.87%, which is the best PCE for CQD-based QDSCs to date.319


4.2.7. Co-sensitization strategy. 
Unlike the case of DSC, the coverage of QDs on TiO2 is usually not complete, and indeed, the reported highest coverage of QDs is only about 34%.110 That is to say, a large portion of the TiO2 surface is bare and directly exposed to the electrolyte.36 This low coverage of QDs leads to a decrease in the light-harvesting efficiency and the aggravation of charge recombination. One strategy to improve the QD-loading amount is via co-sensitization using different QDs or dye molecules. Furthermore, a co-sensitization strategy using different light-harvesting materials can achieve a higher light-harvesting efficiency since different materials have different properties, such as light-absorption range and extinction coefficient.32,240,320–327
For example, in 2008, Han et al. applied two different-sized CdSe QDs to co-sensitize vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes, obtaining a PCE of 1.2%, which was higher than the PCE for the single-sized CdSe QD-sensitized cells.240 The improved PCE was mainly derived from the increase in Jsc values due to the broader light-absorption range. Lei et al. achieved a similar result by depositing two different-sized CdSe QDs on a TiO2 electrode,323 showing that the improved photovoltaic performance could be attributed to the broader light-absorption range and the reduced charge-recombination loss at the interface due to the better coverage of CdSe QDs on the TiO2 film. Qiao et al. also demonstrated the effectiveness of this co-sensitization strategy on improving solar cell performance using dual-sized CdS QDs as sensitizers.321 Recently, Zhong et al. displayed a co-sensitization strategy employing Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) and CdSe QDs as sensitizers (Fig. 20).112 The synergistic effect of the ZCISe QDs with a wide light-absorption range and CdSe QDs with a high extinction coefficient contributed to the improvement of the light-harvesting efficiency as well as inhibition of charge recombination. As a result, a new record PCE of 12.75% (Voc = 0.752 V, Jsc = 27.39 mA cm−2, FF = 0.619) was achieved for QDSCs. Meanwhile, metal–semiconductor nanohybrid materials (NHMs) were also used for enhancing the light-harvesting capability and photovoltaic performance of the resulting cells by Ghosh and coworkers.328 Their experimental results showed that the absorption onset of CdSe/Au was red-shifted to 800 nm. A higher recombination resistance and longer electron lifetime were also confirmed by EIS measurements at the TiO2–CdSe/Au interface in comparison with TiO2–CdSe. Consequently, a PCE of 4.39% was obtained for CdSe/Au QDSC, which was ∼30% higher than that of the plain CdSe QDSC.

The co-sensitization strategy can also be carried out using QDs and organic dyes as sensitizers.320,324–327 Zaban and coworkers constructed a QDs and dye co-sensitized photoanode and showed that the QDs could serve as “antennas” to funnel the absorbed energy to nearby dye molecules via FRET.326 The incorporation of the QDs and dye significantly enhanced the light absorption and broadened the absorption range. Kamat and coworkers employed CdS QDs and a NIR-absorbing squaraine dye (JK-216) as co-sensitizers, delivering a PCE of 3.14%, which was distinctly higher than that of the individual sensitizer-based ones.325 Sastre-Santos and coworkers fabricated a cascade co-sensitization photoanode using CdS QDs and zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPcs) dyes (Fig. 21).320 Unlike the previously co-sensitization method, in which QDs and dyes were separated by a barrier layer or the dyes were anchored to TiO2, the dyes in this work were directly anchored on the CdS QDs through the thiol (SH) group in the dye. It was demonstrated that this cascade co-sensitization could not only expand the light-absorption range, but also benefited the reduction of charge recombination since the dye acted as a passivating agent. Finally, the PCE was increased from 0.8% to 2.5% for the cells using single CdS QD and co-sensitizers, respectively. Overall, the obtained photovoltaic performance of QDSCs fabricated with the co-sensitization strategy using QDs and organic dyes is relatively poor. This can be mainly ascribed to the limitation of the choice of QDs as well as the electrolyte that can stabilize both the QDs and dyes. Further work on this strategy should focus on the exploration of superior QDs and a suitable liquid or solid-state redox couple.

4.3 Counter electrodes
The main function of a counter electrode CE in QDSCs is to catalyze the reduction reaction of the oxidized electrolyte by electrons from the external circuit.7,42,51 A preferred CE should possess the following properties: (1) good conductivity to transfer electrons from the external circuit to the active sites; (2) high catalytic activity toward the reduction reaction of the oxidized electrolyte; and (3) good chemical and mechanical stability to ensure the whole stability of the device. The studied CE catalytic materials for QDSCs can be mainly divided into four kinds: noble metals, metal chalcogenides, carbon materials, and composite materials. The representative photovoltaic performances for QDSCs based on the different CEs are summarized in Table 4. The CE was one of the biggest limitations on the QDSC performance in the early stages of their development and its consequent continuous optimization has contributed significantly to the latest increases reported in cell efficiency.

4.3.1. Noble metals. 
In DSCs, the thermally-deposited Pt electrode is the most common CE due to its superior catalytic ability for the reduction of the I−/I3− electrolyte. Accordingly, this classical CE has been borrowed to make QDSCs.48,49,51 For instance, Lee et al. employed a Pt CE to construct CdS/CdSe QDSCs in 2009 and obtained a record PCE of 3.7%.101 Kuang et al. achieved a PCE of 4.81% in 2011 by applying a Pt CE in electrodeposited CdS/CdSe QDSCs.233 Yang et al. showed a PCE of 5.25% for Pt CE-based QDSCs sensitized with a ZnSe/CdSe/ZnSe quantum well.188 To the best of our knowledge, this is the best efficiency reported to date for noble metal CE-based QDSCs. Besides Pt, researchers found that another noble metal, i.e., Au, was a more superior CE catalytic material.101,215,329–332 For example, Lee et al. showed that under identical conditions, the PCE of QDSCs employing a Au CE (4.22%) was significantly higher than QDSCs with a Pt-based CE (3.70%).101 The improvement in the photovoltaic performance was mainly attributed to the weak adsorption of S2− to the Au surface as confirmed by cyclic voltammetry tests (Fig. 22). Kuang et al. also demonstrated the superiority of Au relative to Pt as a CE catalytic material in QDSCs.215
 Fig. 22  Cyclic voltammograms for S-modified Au(111) and Pt(111) electrodes recorded at 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. Reprinted with permission from ref. 101. Copyright (2009) Wiley. 
Typically, QDSCs based on a noble metal CE exhibit moderate PCEs. This is mainly induced by the adsorption of S2− onto the surface of Pt or Au, leading to poisoning of the CE and hence reducing its catalytic activity as well as the stability of the cell device.51 Furthermore, the high price of the noble metals increases the production cost of the device, thus limiting its commercial application. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to developing efficient low-cost CEs in QDSCs.


4.3.2. Metal chalcogenides. 
As early as 1980, Hodes et al. pointed out that metal sulfides were more suitable catalysts for the polysulfide redox reaction compared to the conventional Pt CE.333 Afterward, it was indeed demonstrated that metal chalcogenides are superior materials for the fabrication of CE in QDSCs. Among these, copper chalcogenide is the most widely studied CE in QDSCs. Mora-Seró and Toyoda and coworkers attempted to fabricate QDSCs using a Cu2S CE and found that the PCE could be improved from 0.65% (Pt CE) to 1.83% (Cu2S CE).229 The improvement was derived from the reduction in the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interfaces, which dramatically affected the fill factor of the device. Afterward, Shen and Toyoda and coworkers reported a brass-substrate-based Cu2S CE (simplified as Cu2S/brass), which could be facilely prepared by directly immersing the brass foil in polysulfide electrolyte.122 They obtained a PCE of 1.8% based on a CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2-nanotube working electrode. It should be noted that this brass-based Cu2S CE has been the most commonly used CE in QDSCs since then and most of the high PCEs reported were derived from this CE-based system.74,85,106,111,113,116,117,203 Up to now, the highest reported PCE for Cu2S/brass-based QDSCs is 10.75% based on ZCISe QD sensitizers.112 Nevertheless, the key problem with this Cu2S/brass CE is that the polysulfide electrolyte can continually react with the brass substrate, leading to a poor long-term stability of the CE and the resultant device.
Aiming at resolving the stability issue of Cu2S/brass CEs, much work has focused on the preparation of Cu2S on a rigid substrate through electrodeposition, spray pyrolysis, or screen printing, etc. approaches to facilitate the sealing of the device.334–351 For example, Zhong and coworkers prepared a Cu2S/FTO CE by electrodeposition of the copper film via a multipotential step technique, followed by dipping into polysulfide methanol solution to form Cu2S.349 These electrodeposited-Cu2S/FTO CE-based QDSCs exhibited a PCE of 5.21%, which was comparable to the PCE of the Cu2S/brass CE-based one (5.41%). In particular, the stability of the cell under one sun illumination was significantly improved for over 10 h without performance degradation. Selopal et al. showed a spray pyrolysis approach to prepare Cu2S/FTO CE and achieved a PCE of 3.75%.345 The spray pyrolysis deposition method possessed the advantages of being simple, cheap, time-saving, and had good reproducibility. Wang et al. reported a novel method to prepare Cu2S/ITO CE by ion exchange.340 They first deposited ZnS on an ITO substrate through a SILAR approach, followed by immersing into a saturated CuCl acetonitrile solution for ion exchange to form a Cu2S film. A final PCE of 4.78% was achieved, which was comparable to that of the Cu2S/brass CE-based one. Meng et al. prepared a Cu2S/FTO CE through a screen-printing method using a Cu2S nanoparticle paste, exhibiting a PCE of 3.71%.351 Zhang et al. used CuS/Cu1.8S composite nanomaterials to fabricate a CuxS/FTO CE, obtaining a PCE of 6.28%, which was slightly higher than the Cu2S/brass CE-based one.350 Furthermore, the constructed cell showed good stability over 225 h, benefiting from the good mechanical and chemical stability of the CE.
Wan and coworkers developed a novel ITO/Cu2S nanowire-arrays CE for QDSCs.335,346,347 As shown in Fig. 23, the ITO nanowire arrays were first grown on a Au-coated FTO substrate via CVD and then a layer of CdS, in a thickness of about 20 nm, was coated on the as-prepared ITO nanowires via the CBD technique. After that, the ITO/Cu2S nanowire arrays were formed through a solution-based cation exchange. The constructed QDSC showed a PCE of 4.06%, which was significantly higher than the conventional Cu2S/FTO CE-based one (3.04%).347 The improvement of the photovoltaic performance can be ascribed to the decrease in sheet resistance and charge-transfer resistance, benefiting from the high-quality tunnel junctions formed between the n-type ITO nanowires and p-type Cu2S nanocrystals, as well as the more active catalytic sites due to the three-dimensional structure of the nanowire arrays. In addition, they further explored an hierarchically-assembled ITO/Cu2S nanowire-arrays CE for the deposition of more Cu2S nanocrystals as active sites, boosting the PCE to 6.12% using CdSeTe QDs as a sensitizer.346

Apart from Cu2S, CuSe or Cu2Se have also been applied to fabricate CEs for QDSCs.352–357 For example, Cui et al. prepared a CuxSe/FTO CE through a novel route.353 They first deposited red selenium on an FTO by disproportionation of Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution with an ethanol spray, and then manipulated the red selenium as both a template and reaction center to fabricate a cuprous-embedded CuxSe composite CE upon the selenium self-redox reaction with copper ions. The constructed QDSCs exhibited a PCE of 3.80%, which was slightly higher than the Cu2S/brass CE-based one (3.72%). Bang and coworkers prepared various metal selenide CEs by a SILAR method and investigated their performance in QDSCs.352 They found that the Cu1.8Se-based CE was superior to the other kinds of metal-selenides-based CEs, achieving a PCE of 5.0%. Tian and coworkers developed a Cu3Se2 CE composed of nanorod arrays and nanosheets, delivering a PCE of 5.05%, higher than the Cu2S/brass-based one (4.10%).354 Wang and coworkers prepared Cu2−xSe nanoparticles and nanowires catalysts by facile wet chemical methods and then used these as CEs in QDSCs.356 The results showed that the Cu2−xSe nanoparticle-based CE could remarkably enhance the efficiency by 17.1% (6.50% vs. 5.55%) compared to Cu2S CE. Zhong and coworkers deposited CuxSe nanoparticles on an FTO substrate and found that the copper-deficient CuxSe favored an improvement in the electrochemical properties of the CE as well as in the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells.357 A PCE of 8.72% was obtained with this CuxSe/FTO CE and the cell showed good stability over 168 h.
Apart from copper-chalcogenides-based CEs, other binary or alloyed metal chalcogenides, such as PbS,358–362 CoS,363–366 FeS,367–370 NiS,371,372 and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) or Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe),373–379 have also been used to fabricate CEs for QDSCs. For example, Zaban and coworkers used PbS as a CE catalytic material in QDSCs. They demonstrated that the PbS CE had higher catalytic activity toward the polysulfide electrolyte compared to the Pt CE.362 Teng and coworkers applied a photoactive p-type PbS film as a CE to construct QDSCs. The authors proposed that the p-type characteristics of the PbS film formed a partial tandem junction between the PbS and the anode, resulting in an increase in the Voc and FF values, achieving a PCE of 4.7%.359 Jin and coworkers reported a CE based on a CoS2 thin film on borosilicate glass prepared by thermal sulfidation. The CoS2 film exhibited high catalytic activity toward a polysulfide electrolyte and good reproducibility and stability in the polysulfide electrolyte, giving a PCE of 4.16%.365 Another kind of metal chalcogenide that has been widely investigated as a CE catalytic material is quaternary CZTS or CZTSe, which are also famous light-harvesting materials in thin film solar cells. Lee and coworkers applied a CZTS microspheres-coated FTO substrate as a CE in QDSCs and achieved a PCE of 3.73%.379 It was shown that the catalytic activity of CZTS toward the S2−/Sn2− redox couple was distinctly higher than for the conventional Pt CE. Cheng et al. prepared a porous-structured CZTSe CE by a spray deposition method, achieving a PCE of 4.35%.380


4.3.3. Carbon materials. 
Carbon materials are considered attractive catalysts due to their advantages of low cost, high durability, and good conductivity. Thus, carbon materials are potential candidates for the construction of CEs in DSCs and QDSCs. As early as 1996, Grätzel and coworkers first explored a graphitic-carbon black mixture as a CE material in DSCs and obtained a PCE of 6.67%.381 In fact, various carbon materials have been explored as CEs in QDSCs.103,104,382–390 For example, Meng et al. deposited a mixture of activated carbon and conductive carbon black on an FTO substrate as a CE, exhibiting a PCE of 1.47% for CdS QDSCs.390 Ko and coworkers devoted much work to carbon materials-based CEs in QDSCs. For example, Ko and coworkers employed hierarchical-nanostructured spherical carbon with a hollow core/mesoporous shell (HCMS) to prepare a CE for use in QDSCs. It was found that the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface of the CE/polysulfide electrolyte was decreased in comparison with Pt CE, delivering a PCE of 3.90% using CdSe QDs as a sensitizer.383 Furthermore, they explored ordered multimodal porous carbon (OMPC) as a CE material in both DSCs and QDSCs. The OMPC possessed a large surface area and well-developed 3D interconnected ordered macropore framework with open mesopores embedded in the macropore walls, exhibiting high catalytic activities and fast mass-transfer kinetics toward both I−/I3− and S2−/Sn2− redox couples. As a result, an impressive PCE of 4.36% was obtained based on CdSe QDs in 2010.103 Besides, they also developed a mesoporous-carbon nanofibers (MCNFs)-based CE in QDSCs, showing a PCE of 4.81%.104
Even though various carbon materials have been explored as CEs in QDSCs, the obtained solar cell performances are still unsatisfactory compared to the conventional Cu2S CE-based one. This can be attributed to the limited catalytic activity, internal resistance, and stability of the carbon-film-based CEs. Accordingly, Zhong's group developed a Ti-mesh-supported carbon film as a CE to improve the catalytic activity, conductivity, and mechanical stability of the CEs.118,119 For example, as shown in Fig. 24, they used mesoporous carbon (MC) to fabricate a Ti-mesh-supported MC (MC/Ti) CE in QDSCs. It was found that the MC/Ti CE presented superior performance compared to the state-of-art Cu2S/FTO CE. On the one hand, the excellent performance of this MC/Ti CE could be attributed to the robust carbon film with good conductivity and the submillimeter thickness due to the confined area in the Ti mesh substrate, ensuring a high catalytic capacity. On the other hand, the 3D interconnected mesoporous framework structure of MC helps realize fast electrolyte mass-transfer kinetics. Finally, a PCE up to 11.51% (11.16% as a certified value) was obtained, representing nearly a 30% improvement relative to the Cu2S/FTO CE-based one.118 Furthermore, they also explored nitrogen-doped mesoporous-carbon (N-MC) materials to prepare CEs in QDSCs. The incorporation of nitrogen heteroatoms into the MC could further improve its catalytic activity toward a polysulfide electrolyte, yielding a PCE of over 12%.119 It is noted that the exploration of effective CEs based on carbon materials has dramatically promoted the development of QDSCs in recent years.

4.3.4. Composite CEs. 
Usually, the performance of a CE is limited by the unsatisfactory function of a single component material. Therefore, an efficient way to overcome the shortcomings of CEs based on single materials is to fabricate composite CEs using multi-component materials.329,397–412 For example, Kamat and coworkers designed a reduced graphene oxide (RGO)–Cu2S composite CE.397 The 2D structure of the RGO facilitated the shuttling of electrons and provided a high surface area for the formation of Cu2S reactive sites. As a result, an impressive PCE of 4.4% was obtained based on CdS/CdSe QDSCs. Meng and coworkers prepared PbS/carbon black composite CEs on an FTO substrate.398 The nanosized PbS provided a large area of catalytic sites, while the carbon black improved both the mechanical strength and the electrical conductivity of the CE. The constructed cell based on this composite CE exhibited a PCE of 3.91% using a CdS/CdSe QD sensitizer. Furthermore, the cell showed outstanding stability over 1000 h under room conditions without degradation. They also prepared a CuInS2/carbon composite CE, obtaining a higher PCE of 4.32% and good stability over 1000 h.399 Choi and coworkers prepared a carbon-dot-Au nanoraspberries CE, exhibiting a high electrocatalytic activity, lower charger-transfer resistance, and larger exchange current density than the reference Au CE and obtained a PCE of 5.4%.329 Bhattacharyya and coworkers reported a composite CE containing microwave-synthesized CuxS and graphene oxide nanoribbon (GOR) for QDSCs.400 The composite CE exhibited a higher electrocatalytic activity toward a polysulfide electrolyte, benefiting from the presence of organic functional groups, graphitic edge sites, and a quasi-one-dimensional structure of the GOR. Finally, PCEs of 5.42% and 6.81% were obtained for CdS/CdSe and CdTe/CdS/CdS dual-sensitized QDSCs, respectively.

4.4 Electrolyte- or hole-transporting materials
The electrolyte redox couple or hole-transporting material (HTM) is also one of the most crucial components in QDSCs, serving to regenerate QDs and shuttle the photogenerated holes to the CE.6,51 To evaluate a redox couple or HTM in QDSCs, the following characteristics should be considered: (1) a low corrosivity to the QDs to maintain the good long-term stability of the cell device; (2) an appropriate redox potential to regenerate QDs effectively and to maintain a high Voc value at the same time; (3) high ion conductivity to facilitate hole transfer; (4) good stability of itself and high transparency in the visible-light window; and (5) fully regenerative, avoiding the use of non-regenerative hole scavengers. Generally, an electrolyte or HTM can significantly influence the solar cell performance and long-term stability of the device. According to the apparent characteristics, electrolytes or HTMs in QDSCs can be summarized into three kinds: liquid, quasi-solid-state, and solid-state. The representative photovoltaic performances for QDSCs based on the different electrolytes or HTMs are summarized in Table 5.

4.4.1. Liquid electrolytes. 
A liquid electrolyte is composed of a redox couple. Even though the well-studied I−/I3− redox couple is the state-of-art electrolyte in DSCs, its high corrosivity to most QDs limits its application in QDSCs. Nevertheless, researchers found that the sulfide/polysulfide redox couple (S2−/Sn2−) was a suitable choice to stabilize most QDs.94,413,414 Therefore, the polysulfide electrolyte is the most popular choice in QDSCs, and most of the obtained high PCEs have been derived with this electrolyte-based system.414 However, the unwanted disadvantages of the polysulfide electrolyte has limited the development of QDSCs: (i) the redox potential of the polysulfide electrolyte is relatively high, leading to energy lose and consequently a low Voc; (ii) the QDs regeneration rate is slow, leading to an accumulation of holes in QDs and therefore decreasing the QDs stability and increasing the recombination rate.32 Thus, considerable research efforts have been devoted to explore new kinds of redox couples, or to modify the polysulfide electrolyte using additives to improve its electrochemical properties.
Much work so far has focused on the exploration of new kinds of redox couples in QDSCs.102,415–418 One of these is a cobalt-complex-based electrolyte, which is also an efficient electrolyte in DSCs.102,320,325,419 For example, Grätzel and coworkers introduced the cobalt redox couple of [Co(o-phen)32+/3+] as an electrolyte in QDSCs.102 The cell using CdSeTe QD sensitizers showed a PCE of 4.18% at 0.1 sun illumination. Ning and coworkers developed a tetramethylthiourea (TMTU)-based organic electrolyte for QDSCs.416 It was found that the charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte/CE interface was distinctly smaller for the cell based on this organic electrolyte than for the polysulfide-electrolyte-based one. Sun and coworkers employed an organic polysulfide redox couple, [(CH3)4N]2S/[(CH3)4N]2Sn, as an electrolyte in CdS QDSCs.415 The oxidation potential of this organic polysulfide redox couple was 1.045 V vs. NHE, which was about 0.5 V lower than that of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple, exhibiting a Voc as high as 1.2 V and an FF of 0.89 (Fig. 25). Mora-Seró and coworkers designed a novel pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquid as an electrolyte in QDSCs.417 The CdSe QDSCs based on this ionic liquid electrolyte reached a PCE of 1.86%, with good stability over 10 days. Tachibana and coworkers employed a ferricyanide/ferrocyanide (Fe(CN)63−/4−) redox couple, which had a relatively positive redox potential (around 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl), as an electrolyte for QDSCs. This electrolyte contributed to an enhancement of the Voc to 0.8 V.418

However, according to the above-mentioned works, even though the application of novel redox couples have brought about an obvious improvement in Voc values, the PCEs still lag far behind the polysulfide-electrolyte-based ones. This may be partially due to the limited stability of QDs in the electrolyte or due to the slow QDs regeneration rate. Thus, it remains challenging to develop an efficient redox couple to boost the PCE of QDSCs beyond that based on the state-of-the-art polysulfide electrolyte. This is an important challenge for QDSCs in order to further increase their performance in the future.
Apart from searching for new redox couples, modification of the polysulfide electrolyte using additives to improve its electrochemical properties is another way to improve the performance of QDSCs. This strategy has been intensively investigated in DSCs, and various additives, such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), lithium ions, and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), have been explored to modify the I−/I3− electrolyte.6 It has been demonstrated that these additives can distinctly contribute to an improvement in the photovoltaic performance by either inhibiting charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface or by shifting the conduction band edge of TiO2. Furthermore, the redox potential of the redox couple can also be changed, thus influencing the Voc of the cells. Recently, some initial attempts were made to modify the polysulfide electrolyte using additives in QDSCs.205,391,424,425 For example, Zhong's group adopted water-soluble polymers, including poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), as additives in the polysulfide electrolyte and observed a remarkable enhancement in the PCE, especially in terms of the Voc and FF values.205,424 Meng's group reported a fumed SiO2 nanoparticles-modified polysulfide electrolyte,425 and revealed that the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles in the electrolyte could create an energy barrier for the recombination at QDs/electrolyte as well as TiO2/electrolytethe interfaces. Finally, a PCE of 11.23% was achieved, 28.6% higher than the reference cell. Zhong and coworkers employed tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as an additive in the polysulfide electrolyte and investigated its effect on the charge-transfer dynamics at the photoanode/electrolyte interface.391 The PCE of the corresponding cell could be improved from 11.75% to 12.34% with the aid of TEOS addition, arising from a reduction of the recombination loss.


4.4.2. Quasi-solid-state electrolytes. 
The drawbacks of easy leakage and volatilization of liquid electrolytes can lead to a poor stability of the cell device and so limit their application. The fabrication of quasi-solid-state QDSCs employing a gel electrolyte is a promising way to obtain highly stable QDSCs.426–432 Meng and coworkers reported for the first time a quasi-solid-state polysulfide electrolyte using a polyacrylamide-based hydrogel as the polymer matrix and obtained a PCE of 4.0%.427 It was demonstrated that the 3D continuous porous network of the polymer was very effective to enhance the absorbent ability toward the liquid electrolyte and the ion-transportation capability. The gel electrolyte exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 0.093 S cm−1, which was very close to that of the liquid polysulfide electrolyte (0.104 S cm−1). Kuang and coworkers prepared a gel polysulfide electrolyte using dextran as a gelator.429 This gel electrolyte had a similar conductivity to the liquid one through optimization of the gelator concentration, and the corresponding QDSCs exhibited a PCE of 3.23%. Meng and coworkers applied the natural polysaccharide konjac glucomannan (KGM) as the polymer matrix to prepare the gel electrolyte and the electrolyte, with the Cu2S counter electrode prepared in one step without a mold.428 The QDSCs based on this gel electrolyte showed a comparable PCE (4.06%) with the liquid-electrolyte-based one (4.22%) while the cell stability was remarkably improved. Tang and coworkers synthesized graphene-implanted polyacrylamide (PAAm-G) conducting gel electrolytes for quasi-solid-state QDSCs.430 They utilized osmotic press across the PAAm-G and capillary force within the 3D micropores as driving forces to improve the dosage of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple and obtained a PCE of 2.34% based on the CdS QD sensitizer. Huo and coworkers employed 12-hydroxystearic acid as a low molecular mass organogelator to gelate the polysulfide electrolyte and also found an improvement in the cell stability.431 Zhong's group used sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) as gelators to prepare quasi-solid-state gel polysulfide electrolytes for QDSCs (Fig. 26), and both of the gel electrolytes contributed to an improvement in the cell stability under continuous irradiation for 90 h.426,432

4.4.3. All-solid-state QDSCs. 
All-solid-state devices can thoroughly overcome the drawbacks of the leakage and volatilization of a liquid electrolyte, thus having the potential to realize the long-term stability of the constructed QDSC.6 The architecture of all-solid-state QDSCs is a little different from liquid-junction QDSCs.433 Typically, a solid-state hole-transporting material (HTM) instead of a liquid redox couple is used as the hole-transport medium and an evaporated back electrode is applied instead of a counter electrode to collect charge carriers.
For solid-state QDSCs, PbS QD is one of the most commonly used sensitizers.97,133,251,422,434,435 The first report about all-solid-state QDSCs was by Grätzel and coworkers, in which they employed spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM and obtained an efficiency of 0.49% under 0.1 sun illumination using PbS QDs.97 Afterward, they improved the PCE to 1.46% through optimization of the pore size of the TiO2 films and the PbS deposition cycles.251 Seok and coworkers deposited multiple-layered PbS QDs on a TiO2 electrode and fabricated solid-state QDSCs using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the HTM.434 The cell performance was further improved by a post-EDT treatment, achieving a PCE of 2.9% under 1 sun illumination. Kim and coworkers synthesized CuS-embedded PbS QDs (PbS/CuS) by a cation-exchange reaction and applied them as a sensitizer in solid-state QDSCs (Fig. 27).422 It was shown that the introduction of CuS around PbS can prolong the exciton lifetime and increase the absorption due to the surface plasmon effect. As a result, a PCE of 8.07% was obtained with an architecture of TiO2/PbS-CuS/P3HT/Au.

II–VI group CdS or CdSe QDs were also used to fabricate solid-state QDSCs.421,436–440 For example, in 2005, Hodes and coworkers sensitized ZnO nanowires with CdSe and fabricated solid-state QDSCs using CuSCN as an HTM, yielding a PCE of 2.3% under 360 W m−2.421 Larramona and coworkers used a CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 porous film to construct solid-state QDSCs based on CuSCN HTM, obtaining a PCE of 1.3% at 1 sun.436 Bach and coworkers applied diisooctyl phosphonic acid (DIOPA) and benzenethiol (BT) derivatives to modify the surface of a CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrode and obtained a PCE of 0.88%, which was higher than the reference cell (0.65%).437 Song and coworkers employed P3HT, acting as both a HTM and assistant light absorber, in CdS solid-state QDSCs, exhibiting a PCE of 1.42%.438 Lianos and coworkers demonstrated that the combination of ZnSe in CdSe QDs was beneficial for the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solid-state QDSCs, arising from the more favorable arrangement of the energy levels.439 Furthermore, it was found that the addition of a small quantity of Na2S in P3HT HTM also contributed to an improved PCE of 3.4%.
Sb2S3 is another promising light-harvesting material used in the construction of all-solid-state QDSCs due to its suitable band gap (1.7 eV), strong absorption coefficient (1.8 × 105 cm−1), and environmental friendly characteristics.94,208,423,441–455 Initially, Sb2S3 was used as a light-harvesting material in liquid-junction cells.94 However, it was found that the stability of Sb2S3 in liquid electrolyte was very poor. The first report about all-solid-state Sb2S3 QDSCs was presented by Hodes's group.441 They deposited Sb2S3 on TiO2 mesoporous film through a CBD method, and a PCE of 3.37% was obtained using CuSCN as the HTM. The cell also showed good stability over 3 days of illumination under load. Afterward, Hodes and Grätzel and coworkers employed spiro-MeOTAD instead of CuSCN as the HTM, delivering PCEs of 5.2% and 3.1% at 0.1 and 1 sun irradiation, respectively.443 Seok and Grätzel and coworkers found that P3HT was a suitable HTM in solid-state Sb2S3 QDSCs.442 The P3HT in the device could act as both a hole conductor and light-harvesting material, achieving a IPCE of 80% and a PCE of 5.13% under 1 sun illumination. Since then, Sb2S3 has attracted much attention as a light-harvesting material to fabricate all-solid-state QDSCs since the obtained PCE is comparable to solid-state DSCs.6
Seok's group has devoted much effort to improve the PCE of Sb2S3- or Sb2Se3-based solid-state QDSCs through optimization of the HTM and the light-harvesting material layer. For example, they investigated the effect of several HTMs on the cell performance of solid-state Sb2S3 QDSCs, including P3HT, PCPDTBT, PCDTBT, and PTAA,423 and found that the cell performance was strongly dependent on the chelation of the thiophene moieties in the HTMs toward Sb2S3. Finally, the cell based on PCPDTBT HTM gave the best PCE of 6.18% under 1 sun illumination. To overcome the filter effect caused by the absorption of P3HT in the visible-light window, Seok and coworkers constructed a PCBM electron channel that could bridge mp-TiO2 and P3HT to transfer the generated charge carriers in P3HT to mp-TiO2.445 Moreover, PCPDTBT was used in the device as an additional low-band-gap hole-conducting polymer that could absorb light in the near-infrared region. As a result, the Jsc could be improved to 16.0 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 6.3% was obtained. Afterward, Seok et al. introduced the surface sulfurization of Sb2S3 by thioacetamide (TA) before deposition of the HTM layer (Fig. 28).208 It was found that the PCE of the cell could be significantly improved from 5.5% to 7.1% after the TA treatment. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) revealed that the improved photovoltaic performance was mainly derived from the reduction of trap sites in Sb2S3.

The CBD method is generally used to deposit Sb2S3 on a TiO2 substrate. However, this approach is time-consuming and the experimental conditions need to be precisely controlled (below 10 °C) to avoid impurity phases. Gödel et al. reported a modified CBD approach to deposit Sb2S3 under room temperature, showing a lower sub-band-gap trap state density and delivering a PCE of 5.1%.454 Seok and coworkers developed a single-step process to deposit Sb2S3 on TiO2 by spin-coating an S/Sb ratio-controlled SbCl3–thiourea complex solution on the substrate (Fig. 29).452 This single-step approach was demonstrated to be efficient and reproducible to fabricate a high-quality Sb2S3 layer, and a comparable PCE of 6.4% was obtained relative to the conventional CBD-method-based one (6.3%). Herein, it is noted that the size of Sb2S3 obtained through this single-step approach was about 60 nm, which is not in the range of quantum dot size. Thus, this kind of cell is usually named as a: semiconductor-sensitized solar cell (SSC).433

Apart from Sb2S3, Sb2Se3, which has a narrower band bap (1.1 eV), has also been applied as a light-harvesting material to fabricate solid-state sensitized solar cells. Seok and coworkers applied a single-step to deposit Sb2Se3 on mesoporous TiO2 by simple multiple cycles of spin-coating of a Se-SSP solution followed by thermal decomposition.456 The light-absorption range could be expanded to 1050 nm due to the narrower band gap of Sb2Se3. The cell device exhibited a Jsc of 22.3 mA cm−2, a Voc of 304.5 mV, an FF of 47.2%, and a PCE of 3.21% under a full one-sun illumination. Besides, they also constructed Sb2(Sx/Se1−x)3-graded-composition-sensitizers-based solid-state inorganic–semiconductor-sensitized solar cells,450 for which they first deposited Sb2Se3 on a TiO2 substrate by spin-coating a Se precursor and then Sb2S3 was grown on the Sb2Se3-sensitized film through a CBD method. The cell exhibited a best PCE of 6.6% with a high Jsc value of 24.9 mA cm−2.
In general, although all-solid-state QDSCs or SSCs possess prominent advantages, especially their potential to realize long-term stability of a device, their obtained PCEs are still low compared to the liquid-junction QDSCs. To date, the highest PCE for an all-solid-state QDSC or SSC is about 8%. The component materials are the main limitations for solid-state QDSC, including the light-harvesting materials as well as HTMs. Further work should focus on the exploration of high-quality light-harvesting materials with a suitable band gap and proper HTM, combined with optimization of the device structure.

5. Recombination control
In QDSCs, apart from the preferred charge-transfer processes, there are also several recombination paths competing with these favorable processes. It is well known that non-radiative charge recombination can seriously deteriorate the performance of a device.33,38 For QDSCs, charge recombination is particularly serious compared to DSCs due to the existence of defect states in QD sensitizers, the low QD-loading amount inducing a large portion of bare TiO2 surface to be directly exposed to the electrolyte, and the complex chemical activity of the commonly used polysulfide electrolyte. Therefore, the suppression of charge recombination in QDSCs is a big issue that should be addressed to obtain the desirable photovoltaic performance.
As shown in Fig. 30 with dashed arrows, there are four main recombination pathways in QDSCs: (1) charge recombination inside the QD through defect states, (2) recombination of excited electron in the QD with oxidized species in the electrolyte at the QD/electrolyte interface, (3) back transfer of electrons in the TiO2 to the QD at the TiO2/QD interface, and (4) recombination of electrons in TiO2 with the electrolyte at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.38 It can be seen that the defect states in the QD and the large area of bare TiO2 surface aggravate the charge recombination in QDSCs compared to DSCs, where TiO2 is practically fully covered by the dye, or polymer solar cells. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to address the recombination issue. In general, the reported means for recombination controlling in QDSCs can be summarized into two kinds: material engineering and interface engineering, which are discussed in detail in the following section.
 Fig. 30  Schematic illustration of the main charge-recombination routes in QDSCs. 
5.1 Material engineering
Since one of the major charge-recombination processes takes place inside QDs through defect states, a high-quality QD sensitizer has become a prerequisite for high-efficiency solar cells. In the early investigation stage of QDSCs, QDs were usually grown directly on the TiO2 substrate through SILAR or CBD methods.36,101 As mentioned in the above section, QDs formed by this in situ approach usually possess a high density of defect states due to the poor crystallinity and large number of dangling bonds at the surface, leading to severe charge recombination inside QDs or back electron transfer from TiO2 to QDs. Therefore, the adoption of a high-quality pre-synthesized QD sensitizer is an effective route to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs.36,457 On the one hand, pre-synthesized colloidal QDs possess a lower density of inner and surface defect states, benefiting from the well-developed organometallic synthesis method. On the other hand, pre-prepared QDs provide more opportunities to realize a better control over the composition and structure of the QDs. Thus, it's not surprising that the adoption of pre-synthesized QDs as a sensitizer have prominently promoted the development of QDSCs in the past five years.74,85,109,111,115–118,219,425 Accordingly, much effort has been made to design the optimum composition and structure of QDs to ensure charge-recombination control. Among the solutions, the construction of a core/shell structure and the alloying strategy have been demonstrated to be efficient means to reduce charge-recombination loss.
Core/shell-structured QDs are an attractive material to use in recombination design since their photoelectric properties can be facilely tailored through the shell materials.270,271 Among these, type-II-structured QDs possess the potential to reduce charge recombination inside QDs. For type-II-structured QDs, both the CB and VB of the core material are located either lower or higher than the shell material, resulting in the spatial separation of charge carriers. Accordingly, if the CB and VB of the core material are both higher than the shell material, the electron is mostly confined to the shell layer and the hole is mostly confined to the core layer.268,270,271 It is noted that this spatial separation of electrons and holes reduces the possibility of charge recombination within QDs. Inspired by these unique properties, several attempts have been made to apply type-II QDs as sensitizers in QDSCs, including ZnSe/CdS, ZnTe/ZnSe, CdTe/CdSe, and ZnTe/CdSe, and a record PCE of 7.17% has been achieved for ZnTe/CdSe-based QDSCs.74,85,217,416 The details of the related works have been discussed in the above section. It is noted that the obtained Voc of QDSCs based on these type-II QDs are especially higher compared to other QDs, partially due to the inhibited charge-recombination inside the QDs.
Besides, type-I-structured core/shell QDs also show their superiority in controlling the charge-recombination process. In type-I-structured QDs, the shell materials have a higher CB edge and lower VB edge than those of the core materials.270 On the one hand, the wide-band-gap shell acts as a barrier layer, which can prevent photongenerated electron leakage from the QD to the electrolyte. On the other hand, the epitaxial growth of the wide-band-gap shell material significantly reduces the trap state density of the core QD, so the processes of internal charge recombination inside the QD and electron back transfer from TiO2 to the trap states of QDs are consequently retarded.38 However, it should be noted that the shell can also act as a barrier in preventing electron injection from the QD to the electron acceptor.116 Therefore, the thickness of the shell material should be thin enough (generally less than 1–2 nm) to guarantee efficient electron extraction. The cation-exchange method is one convenient way to fabricate a thin shell layer around the core QDs to form the quasi-type-I structure. For example, Zhong and coworkers applied a cation-exchange approach to prepare type-I CuInS2/ZnS core/shell QDs.116 The photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of the as-prepared QDs was significantly improved after the formation of the ZnS shell layer through the cation-exchange process. Accordingly, the PCE of the cell was improved from 5.05% (CuInS2 based) to 7.04% (CuInS2/ZnS based) benefiting from the inhibited charge recombination and prolonged electron lifetime. Klimov and coworkers compared the different effects of cation exchange in CuInSe1−xSx QDs using Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions as the exchange cation.78 It was found that both Zn2+ and Cd2+ cation exchange could contribute to an improvement in the PL quantum yield as well as in the resultant solar cell performance, with the enhancement greater for the Cd2+-based one, and a certified PCE of 5.1% was obtained (Fig. 31).

Recently, the alloying strategy has been demonstrated as a convenient way to improve the photoelectronic properties of QDs as well as the photovoltaic performance of the related solar cells.115,223,274 As discussed above, there are two conflicting effects of the shell layer in type-I-structured core/shell QDs: reducing surface trapping defects but retarding electron injection and hole scavenging simultaneously. Furthermore, the formation of the thin shell layer can only reduce the surface defect states of QDs, while it is powerless to tailor the defect states inside the QDs. In contrast, alloying a wide-band-gap material into the native QD can resolve these problems simultaneously. It has been shown that the alloying strategy could not only reduce the density of trap defects both at the surface and inside the QD due to the hardened lattice structure and decreased atomic intradiffusion, but could also favor electron injection due to the upshift of the CB edge. Zhong and coworkers alloyed ZnSe and Ga2Se3 in native CISe QDs to form Zn–Cu–In–Se or Ga–Cu–In–Se QDs through a “simultaneous nucleation and growth” approach.115,223 The PCE of the QDSCs could be improved by more than 20% by using the alloying strategy with the QD sensitizers and a record PCE of 11.66% was obtained. The enhancement in the solar cell performance could be mainly attributed to the lower density of trap states in the QDs, thus inhibiting the charge-recombination process, and the upshift of the CB edge, thus improving the electron-injection efficiency.
5.2 Interface engineering
In charge-recombination control, besides the amelioration of the quality of QD sensitizers to suppress the QD-related recombination processes, other attention has been mainly paid to the recombination processes taking place at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.32,33,38 In the photoanode, QDs and the bare TiO2 surface contact directly with the electrolyte. This facilitates electrons being captured by the oxidized species in the electrolyte. Thus, the modification of the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface is crucial to realize the high photovoltaic performance of QDSCs. As a whole, interface modification techniques can be classed into three kinds: coating strategy using inorganic wide-band-gap materials, organic molecular treatment, and electrolyte modification.

5.2.1. Coating strategy. 
The coating strategy on the photoanode using wide-band-gap materials to prevent direct contact between the photoanode and electrolyte is believed to be an efficient way to reduce electron-recombination losses at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. Among the materials, the ZnS-coating layer is the most popular and commonly used one in QDSCs and has had a dramatically positive effect in improving solar cell performance.117,459–464 The concept of ZnS-coating treatment on a semiconductor to tailor the interface characteristics was first carried out by Huang and coworkers, in which they coated a TiO2/PbS/CdS electrode by a ZnS layer through a SILAR method to protect the PbS and CdS particles from photocorrosion.460 They found that the photovoltaic performance of solar cells could be improved significantly after the ZnS treatment, especially in terms of the Voc value. This work indicated that the ZnS-coating layer could not only protect the QDs from photocorrosion, but also showed a suppressing effect on the charge-recombination process. After that, Toyoda and Shen and coworkers introduced this treatment to QDSCs and systematically investigated the effect of a ZnS-coating layer on the solar cell performance.99,459,464 It was demonstrated that the ZnS treatment plays two roles in the performance of QDSCs: one is to passivate the QDs’ surface and the other is to block the bare TiO2 surface. As a result, an improvement of 74% in the final PCE can be achieved. Since then, the ZnS-coating treatment has been adopted as a typical process in the fabrication of QDSCs. Meanwhile, ZnSe has also been used as a passivation layer in QDSCs.465–469 For example, Cao and coworkers compared the effect of a ZnS and ZnSe passivation layer on the performance of QDSCs.466 They found that the ZnSe passivation layer was superior to the ZnS passivation layer in terms of improving the PCE of QDSCs. The ZnSe passivation layer could not only improve the light-harvesting capability of the photoanode, but also showed a better charge-recombination inhibition effect. Finally, a PCE of 6.4% was achieved for CdS/CdSe QDSCs with a ZnSe passivation layer, about 30% higher than the ZnS-passivation-layer-based one (4.9%).
Apart from ZnS or ZnSe passivation layer, metal oxides with a wide band gap have also been investigated as a coating layer to inhibit charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface in QDSCs.113,114,117,256,458,470–473 This was motivated by the corresponding works in DSCs, in which insulating metal oxide treatment on the photoanode has been widely investigated for the purpose of recombination control.474–477 It was revealed that the main function of the metal oxide layer coating is to block the electron back transfer process, thus improving the Voc of the cell device. Zaban and coworkers deposited a thin amorphous TiO2 layer on a QD-sensitized film.471 The results showed that both the PCE and the stability of the CdS-based QDSCs were remarkably improved in I−/I3− electrolyte. Besides, Zaban and coworkers also used a MgO coating to modify the interfaces.472 They deposited conformal MgO by the EPD method on a TiO2 electrode before or after QDs deposition, illustrating that the interface between the TiO2 and QDs is also crucial for the recombination process as well as for the other interfaces in the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte triple junction. Bent and coworkers deposited Al2O3 barrier layers either before or after the QD deposition on a TiO2 film by the ALD method to fabricate CdS- or PbS-based solid-state QDSCs (Fig. 32),458 and found that the Al2O3 barrier layer could act as a tunneling barrier to suppress charge recombination and increase electron lifetimes in TiO2. With optimization of the Al2O3 layer thickness, the obtained Voc and PCE were increased obviously.

Zhong and coworkers reported a robust coating treatment to tailor the interface charge-recombination processes, in which they applied a novel double-coating layer by sequentially depositing ZnS and SiO2 on a QD-sensitized TiO2 electrode (Fig. 33).117 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed and unraveled that the ZnS or SiO2 single coating layer could reduce the surface electron density of states (DOS) by 2 orders of magnitude, while the double-coating layer could further reduce the DOS by 3 orders of magnitude. As a result, the PCE of the constructed cell was boosted from 7.17% (single ZnS layer) to 8.55% (ZnS/SiO2 double layer). Besides, they introduced an additional amorphous metal oxyhydroxide as a buffer layer between the QD-sensitized film and ZnS/SiO2 blocking layer to further suppress charge recombination at the interface.113,114 A series of metal oxyhydroxides were overcoated on CdSeTe QD-sensitized photoanodes via a hydrolysis and condensation process from the corresponding metal chloride aqueous solution to investigate their effect on the photovoltaic performance. It was found that the introduction of am-TiO2, am-ZrO2, and am-Nb2O5 as buffer layers showed beneficial effects in terms of an improvement of the cell performance due to further suppression of charge-recombination processes, and the PCE was further boosted to 9.73% with ZrOCl2 treatment on the photoanode.

Unlike the above-mentioned wide-band-gap semiconductor or insulating inorganic materials overcoating strategy aiming at isolating the photoanode from the electrolyte, and thus reducing photogenerated electron leakage at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, a p-type semiconductor CuS overlayer has been used to facilitate hole transfer to the electrolyte from QD sensitizers.192,462,478 In an example reported by Ghosh et al.,479 a CdS layer was first overcoated around a QD-sensitized photoanode, and then Cd2+ was partially replaced by Cu2+ to form a CuS layer. With the formation of the CuS layer, the PCE of the champion cell was 4.03%, which was about 12% higher than the one with a normal ZnS coating. EIS measurements disclosed that the CuS layer acted as a hole-transporting buffer layer, thus increasing the charge-collection efficiency. Therefore, this strategy could help to overcome the inherent disadvantage of the slower hole-transfer rate in standard QDSCs, which is one of the key factors limiting the performance of QDSCs.


5.2.2. Organic molecular treatment. 
Apart from the inorganic coating layer treatment, photoanode interface modification using organic molecules was also demonstrated to be effective for the suppression of charge recombination.480–485 For example, Mora-Seró and coworkers showed that molecular dipole (DT)-assisted ZnS treatment could give a better control of the recombination dynamics as well as the charge-injection process.480 They found that the sequence of DT and ZnS treatment could significantly influence the final performance of solar cells, whereby the optimized sequence of the treatment (DT + ZnS) resulted in a dramatic 600% increase in the PCE compared to the reference cell without treatment. Furthermore, they also investigated the passivation effect of different organic molecules, including ethanedithiol (EDT), ethylenediamine (ETDA), thioglycolic acid (TGA), dimethylamine (DMA), and formic acid (FA),481 and found that the treatment using molecules containing amine or thiol groups could enhance the PCE of QDSCs, while the treatment by molecules with acid groups would lead to a negative effect. It should be noted that investigation of the organic molecular treatment on QD-sensitized photoanodes was performed via the in situ growth of QD sensitizers on a TiO2 film electrode. In this condition, no capping ligand was present on the surface of the QD sensitizers, so that the organic molecules could easily absorb on the QDs. It is not certain whether this organic molecular treatment could provide a similar positive effect in ligand-capped pre-prepared QD-sensitizer-based QDSCs. In the case of ex situ prepared QD sensitizers, thiol coadsorbents (such as thioglycolic acid (TGA), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), glutathione (GSH), and cysteine) were added into the QD solution prepared in aqueous media during the QD deposition process.248 The experimental results indicated that the photovoltaic performance of the resulting QDSCs were dependent on the type and concentration of the thiol coadsorbent used. With the use of TGA coadsorbents, the PCE of the CuInS2 QDSCs (5.90%) was 20 times higher than that of the control cell without TGA coadsorbents (0.29%). The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated in the fabrication of QDSCs using AgInS2 or CdSeTe QDs prepared in aqueous media. The improved performance was ascribed to reducing the disulfides, and varying the conduction band edge of TiO2. However the effect of coadsorbents in increasing the QD-loading amount was prominent, and this could explain the enhanced Jsc and Voc.


5.2.3. Electrolyte modification. 
As discussed above, the complex nature of the polysulfide electrolyte brings about severe charge recombination. Previous work has demonstrated that the rate of charge recombination from TiO2 to the polysulfide electrolyte is at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than that in the I−/I3− redox couple based system.32 This should, therefore, be seriously taken into account when designing high-efficiency QDSCs. An alternative way to suppress the charge recombination is by modification of the polysulfide electrolyte using additives to tune its electrochemical properties.
Zhong et al. found that the addition of water-soluble polymers, such as PEG and PVP, in the polysulfide electrolyte could distinctly inhibit the charge-recombination rate at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.205,424 They proposed that the polymer additives in the polysulfide electrolyte could serve as a protective layer over both the TiO2 and QDs surfaces by a steric hindrance effect, thus inhibiting the unwanted charge recombination from TiO2 to the polysulfide electrolyte and improving the resultant photovoltaic performance. Meng et al. reported that the addition of fumed SiO2 nanoparticles in the polysulfide electrolyte also resulted in an inhibition effect for the charge recombination.425 They demonstrated that the SiO2 nanoparticles in the electrolyte could create an energy barrier at the QDs/electrolyte and TiO2/electrolyte interfaces, consequently retarding the charge-recombination processes. However, it should be noted that the intrinsic mechanism of charge-recombination inhibition using these additives in the polysulfide electrolyte is not fully understood yet.

6. Stability issues
For all kinds of emerging solar cells, long-term stability is a prequisite to realize their commercial application. Up to now, long-term stability is one of the bottlenecks limiting the practical application of almost all kinds of emerging solar cells.486–491 In QDSCs, however, few studies have been focused on the stability investigation, despite the cell stability still being far from satisfactory. Therefore, for the further development of this kind of solar cells, much effort should be devoted to address the stability issue. The stability of QDSCs is mainly determined by the following factors: (1) the chemical stability of the QDs in the electrolyte; (2) the chemical and mechanical stability of the counter electrode used in QDSCs; (3) the stability of the redox couple in the electrolyte; and (4) the sealing technology used to avoid the leakage and volatilization of the electrolyte (for liquid-junction devices). A summary of stability tests for QDSCs is shown in Table 6.

The I−/I3− redox couple is the most popular choice in DSCs, but most QDs are unstable in this system. Although the polysulfide electrolyte (S2−/Sn2−) was found to be suitable for stabilizing QDs and therefore could offer a relatively stable cell device, photocorrosion of the QDs in the polysulfide electrolyte could still take place due to the complex chemical properties of the polysulfide redox couple, consequently resulting in a deterioration of the cell stability.75,253 In addition, the chemical and mechanical stability of the CEs can also affect the stability of the cell device. For example, brass-foil-based Cu2S is commonly used as a CE in QDSCs, even though this CE suffers from continuous corrosion by the polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in leakage of the electrolyte eventually.397 Therefore, to improve the stability of QDSCs, the exploitation of highly stable QDs, a robust CE, and an effective cell-sealing technique should be taken into account simultaneously.
The good chemical stability of QDs toward light, heat, and the electrolyte is a prerequisite to realize good device stability. Various QDs, such as PbS, CdTe, and Sb2S3, have been proven to be unstable in the traditional polysulfide electrolyte.97,253,448 Zhong et al. demonstrated an improvement in the solar cell stability by using an alloyed CdSexTe1−x QD with good stability in the polysulfide electrolyte.111 The fabricated QDSCs exhibited good stability for more than 500 h (Fig. 34). It is noted that many subsequent studies on the stability improvement have also been based on this kind of state-of-the-art sensitizer.205,425,426,432,473 In addition, the doping strategy in QD sensitizers was also found to favor the stability of QDSCs.107,305,492 For example, Kamat et al. reported that QDSCs using Mn-doped CdS/CdSe QDs as a sensitizer showed good stability under continuous illumination of 100 mW cm−2 for 2 h.107 Gopi et al. also demonstrated that the cells based on Mn-doped CdS QDs displayed a better stability compared to an undoped one.305

Another way to improve the stability of QDSCs is by photoanode post-treatment with an overcoating of an isolating wide-band-gap semiconductor.117,460,471,473,493,494 On the one hand, the coating layer can prevent QDs from having direct contact with the electrolyte, thus reducing photocorrosion of the QDs in the electrolyte, while on the other hand, the coating layer around the photoanode can protect the QDs from the attack by oxygen molecules, thus improving the chemical stability of the QDs. For example, a commonly used ZnS or ZnSe passivation layer was found to be capable of improving the stability of QDSCs.460,493,494 In addition, a metal oxide coating layer on the photoanode can also favor the stability of the device.471 For instance, Zaban et al. presented a coating strategy on a CdS-sensitized TiO2 film using an amorphous TiO2 layer to improve the cell stability in I−/I3− electrolyte.471 The amorphous TiO2 coating protected the QDs from severe corrosion by the I−/I3− redox couple and therefore allowed obtaining a better performance compared to the uncoated one. Zhong et al. found that a ZnS/SiO2 double-layer coating on the photoanode was beneficial for improving the stability of QDSCs.117 The constructed cell with this double-layer coating exhibited no degradation over the course of 24 h under 1 sun continuous irradiation, significantly better than the single ZnS-coated one (Fig. 29d). They also demonstrated that a ZnS and metal hydroxide composite passivation layer favored the stability of QDSCs, benefiting from the better protection effect of the passivation layer for the QDs.473
Another factor that limits the stability of QDSCs is the nature of the CE catalytic materials used. To overcome the stability issue induced by brass-foil-based CEs, several groups developed novel CEs on an FTO substrate to improve the stability of the cell device.342,349,398,399,411,495 For example, Meng's group prepared two kinds of composite CEs: PbS/carbon black and CuInS2/carbon black on an FTO substrate.398,399 It was proposed that the framework of the carbon black used in the composite CE together with the PVDF binder provided good physical contact between the nanoparticles and the FTO substrate and therefore could improve the long-term stability of the CE. The composite CE-based cells showed excellent stability over 1000 h without degradation under room light conditions (Fig. 35). It is noted that this was the longest reported period for the stability test for QDSCs. Wang et al. prepared hierarchical CuS/FTO CEs through a facile electrochemical deposition method, which exhibited excellent chemical and electrochemical stability in polysulfide electrolyte.342 The corresponding QDSC device presented a high illumination and conservation stability for 2 and 240 h, respectively. Zhong et al. deposited a copper film on an FTO substrate through an electrodeposition method and then formed Cu2S/FTO CE by dipping the Cu/FTO into polysulfide solution.349 The cell based on this Cu2S/FTO CE showed good stability over 10 h without degradation under continuous irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 36). Gopi et al. prepared a NiS/PbS composite CE on FTO using a CBD technique and the PCE of the fabricated QDSC showed no degradation over 10 h under room light conditions.411

In addition to the above-mentioned methods to address the stability issue, another efficient way to improve the stability of QDSCs is by modification of the electrolyte.205,391,424–426,431,432,496 As discussed above, the relatively high chemical activity of the polysulfide electrolyte leads to the corrosion of QDs, which therefore damages the stability of the resultant device. Hence, modification of the electrolyte by using additives to tune its chemical activity or the physical features is a potential way to improve the stability of QDSCs. Zhong's group adopted water-soluble polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), as additives in polysulfide electrolyte,205,424 and found that both additives were favorable for the improvement of cell stability. Meng et al. reported a fumed SiO2 nanoparticles-modified polysulfide electrolyte to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs.425 An improvement in the solar cell stability was achieved employing the SiO2 NP-modified electrolyte, in which only a 6.3% drop in the PCE was found for a cell based on this modified electrolyte after 42 days of storage, whereas the PCE of the reference cell dropped by 23.3% during the same period. Similar results were also obtained by Zhong et al., who used tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as an additive in polysulfide electrolyte to form a two-dimensional amorphous SiO2 film, showing a distinct improvement in the cell stability.391 Besides, it is well known that liquid electrolytes suffer from the limitation of volatilization and leakage, thus seriously hampering the stability of the cell device. Therefore, the fabrication of solid-state or quasi-solid-state solar cells is another way to obtain highly stable QDSCs. For example, Meng et al. applied natural polysaccharide konjac glucomannan (KGM) as a polymer matrix to prepare a gel electrolyte, which significantly improved the cell stability.428 Kim et al. also found an improvement in stability by using a poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl-ether (PEGDME)-supported gel polysulfide electrolyte.497 Zhong et al. used sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) as gelators to prepare quasi-solid-state gel electrolytes for QDSCs, and both of the gel electrolytes contributed to an improvement in the cell stability under continuous irradiation for 90 h (Fig. 37).426,432

On the whole, despite the stability of QDSCs being distinctly improved in recent years, it is still far from satisfactory for their practical application or in comparison with other kinds of emerging solar cells. Up to now, the best reported stability test result for QDSCs is 1000 h with the cells stored under room light conditions.398,399,425,428 Issues about the long-term stability have been the main limitation for their industrial application. Even though a series of stability characterizations have been reported for QDSCs, they were conducted in non-standardized ways with incomparable data. Meanwhile, standard stability test conditions for QDSCs are still lacking. Although rigorous industrial standard stability measurement conditions for commercial photovoltaic panels were defined by the IEC 61646 protocol, the stability assessment of a novel solar panel with its own peculiarities might require an adjustment of the common standards.487 Therefore, it is still a great challenge to realize recognized stability and test conditions for QDSCs in the future.
7. Summary and outlook
In recent years, QDSCs have emerged as attractive candidates for the third-generation solar cells. During the past five years, we have witnessed a fast improvement in the obtained record PCEs for QDSCs, arising both from material and technical advances. The record PCE is about 13% now, which is a competitive level relative to other kinds of emerging solar cells. This motivates us to further promote this kind of solar cells to a higher level aiming at commercial application. In this review article, we presented a comprehensive overview of the progress, fundamental principles, and main research areas in QDSCs. Finally, we now discuss possible future directions for this field of research with the aim toward developing highly efficient QDSCs.
To further promote the development of QDSCs, the PCE and stability of the cells together with the toxicity of various constituents should be taken into consideration simultaneously, and improved to a new satisfactory level. Accordingly, the authors believe that the following aspects deserve great attention in the future:
(a) Development of completely “green” QDSCs. For the real applications of a new kind of solar cell, it is a prerequisite that the whole device is environmentally friendly. As for QDSCs, the environmental concerns come from various constituents, such as the high toxicity from the Cd- or Pb-containing QD materials, the toxicity from the nanoscaled materials and from the polysulfide redox. Therefore, the “green” concept should be taken into account in the study of all the components of QDSCs. Concretely, Cd- and Pb-free I–III–VI group QDs such as CuInS2 and CuInSe2, are wise choices as light-absorbing sensitizers in QDSCs. In fact, I–III–VI group QDs have been demonstrated to be capable of obtaining a higher efficiency in comparison with Cd- and Pb-based QDs.115,222 For the counter electrode, carbon materials may be a good choice due to their environmentally friendly nature, high catalytic activity, and low cost. From the safety point of view, QDSCs with an aqueous electrolyte are more promising for commercial applications in comparison with DSCs with an organic electrolyte.
(b) Exploration of more superior QD sensitizers. The development of QD sensitizers has contributed to the huge enhancement of the PCE of QDSCs in recent years. Nevertheless, there is still a great need to explore new types of QD sensitizers, possessing the characteristics of a suitable band edge position, wide absorption range, lower density of trap states, environmentally friendly nature, and low cost. Specifically, the construction of composite-structured I–III–VI group QDs through alloying or a core/shell strategy is a promising way to obtain high-quality and low-toxicity environmentally friendly QD light absorbers in QDSCs.
(c) Improvement of the loading amount of QDs on the TiO2 substrate. The highest reported surface coverage ratio of QDs on the TiO2 electrode is only about 34%.110 This means that a large portion of the TiO2 electrode surface is bare and uncovered. A further improvement of the QD-loading amount would not only improve the light-harvesting efficiency, but also inhibit charge recombination. The co-sensitization strategy using two or more kinds of QDs to sensitize the TiO2 film electrode may be a good choice to further improve the QD-loading amount. In addition, the application of solvent engineering to reasonably tailor the polarity of the QD solution may also be helpful for enhancing the QD-loading amount on metal oxide film electrodes.
(d) Suppression of the charge-recombination processes. The severe charge recombination in QDSCs still constitutes one of the main factors limiting cell performance. There is thereby an urgent need, albeit still a significant challenge, to explore a facile and robust method to realize a powerful control of the charge-recombination processes, and therefore to significantly reduce the energy loss during the charge-transfer and -transport processes. Up to now, the surface-coating strategy has been commonly used to modify the interfaces and to inhibit charge-recombination processes. This coating treatment is mainly carried out through a sol–gel route, but it's difficult to obtain a compact film on the photoanode surface through the sol–gel approach, resulting in an incomplete passivation effect at interfaces. Therefore, other surface-treatment techniques, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), may provide a more robust passivation layer and thereby could improve the photovoltaic performance further.
(e) Exploration of new kinds of electrolytes or HTMs. Up to now, the development of electrolytes in QDSCs is still lagging behind other advances, thus restricting the Voc and PCE values of QDSCs. This has become a key bottleneck for the further development of QDSCs. It is believed that a breakthrough in electrolyte exploration will dramatically improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs. In this regard, we expect that the Co2+/3+ complexes redox couple and p-type inorganic semiconductors, such as CuI, CuSCN, and perovskite materials, are promising candidates as electrolytes or HTMs in QDSCs.
(f) Realization of the long-term stability of devices. The current stability of QDSCs is still far from the standard needed for real applications. Further effort is required to improve the long-term stability of QDSCs. The improvement of the device sealing technique for liquid-junction QDSCs or the fabrication of all-inorganic-solid-state QDSCs possess potential to realize satisfactory long-term stability. Additionally, standard stability test conditions for QDSCs are also needed to reasonably evaluate the stability of a device.
(g) Utilization of related works and technology. Concerning the commercialization of this technology, QDSCs can take advantage of the developments made in this line by DSCs.498 There should be no technical difficulty to upscale and fabricate large modules for QDSCs since their analog DSCs have succeeded in these fields. As for DSCs, long-term stability is the major issue for QDSCs. Unfortunately, as far as we know, there are no specific works focusing on the life-cycle assessment of QDSCs to evaluate the cost and the environmental impacts produced by the upscaling of this technology in order to determine the main limiting factors in terms of cost, technology, toxicity, or stability, and this lack needs to solved in the future.
The fascinating advantages combined with the fast evolution of QDSCs render them promising candidates for the next-generation solar cells. We are confident that with further breakthroughs in materials exploration and in device structure optimization, QDSC with a PCE of over 15% will be obtained in the near future.
