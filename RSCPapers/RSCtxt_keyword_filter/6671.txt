    , Accepted 5th May 2020First published on 6th May 2020AbstractCu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells have been receiving considerable attention in recent years, owing to their low cost and toxicity as well as a high abundance of their constituent elements. Solution-based (mainly precursor solution) methods have been widely used in the fabrication of CZTSSe-based thin film solar cells. Though most record solar cells since 2009 have been achieved using solution-based methods, carbonaceous residues are always formed during post deposition treatment (PDT). These carbonaceous residues are detrimental to grain growth of CZTSSe to form large grains. The presence of unwanted small grain layers will increase the series resistance and reduce the fill factor of the solar cell, thus consequently decreasing the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells. Herein, we propose “green” supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) treatment to overcome the challenge of carbonaceous residues. FT-IR, SEM, XRD and Raman characterization studies were used to confirm the reduction of carbonaceous residues in CZTSSe films. The solar cell fabricated from a selenized CZTSSe precursor film with SCCO2 treatment under optimal conditions showed the best conversion efficiency of 11.23% (VOC = 0.456 V, JSC = 36.6 mA cm−2, FF = 67.1%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on boosting the efficiency of solution-based CZTSSe solar cells by using SCCO2 treatment. In addition, this unique SCCO2 treatment may also bring forth new ideas for other solution-based optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
The kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) semiconductor material is quite suitable for use as an absorption layer in new generation inorganic thin film solar cells due to its low toxicity, adjustable band gaps (from 1.0 eV to 1.5 eV) and earth-abundant component elements.1,2 To date, numerous strategies have been adopted to deposit CZTSSe films, including conventional vacuum deposition technologies (e.g., sputtering, pulsed laser deposition and thermal co-evaporation) and non-vacuum deposition technologies (e.g., solution process and electro-deposition).1,3–6 Among various film deposition methods, solution-based methods are considered more cost-effective for large scale production of solar cells, and have been demonstrated to be quite suitable for CZTSSe solar cell fabrication by the increasing number of studies.3–5,7 However, a large amount of carbonaceous residues is formed in CZTSSe films during post deposition treatment (PDT) under an inert gas atmosphere.2,8 These incompletely carbonated carbonaceous residues will affect the necking of CZTSSe crystals to form large grains by influencing the surface properties of nanocrystals,9 thus further affecting the nucleation and growth process of CZTSSe crystals. The crystallinity of CZTSSe is the key factor affecting the interface quality and performance of photovoltaic devices.4,8 Optimization toward the carbonaceous residues remaining in CZTSSe precursor films is expected to be an effective approach to improve the device performance. In order to minimize the formation of carbonaceous residues, several types of strategies have been developed, including (1) increasing the temperature of annealing treatment for CZTS precursor films,10 (2) using low-carbonaceous residues or carbon-free solvents for the preparation of CZTS precursor solutions5,8,11,12 and (3) increasing the sulfuration/selenization temperature and/or the time of the PDT procedure.2,6,13 However, some obvious disadvantages are still present. (1) Sn loss during the annealing and/or selenization procedure at high temperature.14 (2) The solubility of some raw materials used is limited to some extent. (3) Sometimes, additives are essential to stabilize the precursor solution, which will increase the carbon content, thus also causing the formation of carbonaceous residues.11,15 Therefore, a reliable, simple and low cost method for reducing the carbonaceous residues is still in high demand.
A supercritical fluid (SCF) is defined as the intermediate state between gas and liquid phases.16 The most widely used SCF is supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2), which has mild supercritical conditions (Tc = 31.2 °C, Pc = 7.386 MPa).16–18 In addition, SCCO2 is nonflammable, nontoxic and inexpensive.17 SCCO2 exhibits excellent extraction properties for some compounds due to its desirable diffusivity, viscosity, zero surface tension, liquid like density and solvating power.19 To date, SCCO2 has been widely applied in the food and drug manufacturing industries.18,20 In addition, studies on the application of SCCO2 in graft materials and resistance random access memory have also been reported.21,22
In this work, we try to use SCCO2 to extract parts of unexpected organic chemicals in CZTSSe precursor films in order to reduce carbonaceous residues in the final CZTSSe solar cells (Scheme 1). The SCCO2 treatment could extract parts of extra organic species without changing the morphology and crystal structure of CZTSSe precursor films. The effects of SCCO2 treatment on the grain size, phase and chemical composition of CZTSSe layers were studied in detail. As a comparison, the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells was boosted to 11.23% from 9.28% after the SCCO2 treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on boosting the efficiency of solution-based CZTSSe solar cells by using SCCO2 treatment. Scheme 1 shows the process of SCCO2 treatment in CZTSSe film fabrication.

Cadmium sulfate (CdSO4·8/3H2O, 99%), thiourea (NH2CSNH2, 99%) and ethanolamine (C2H7NO, 99.5%) were obtained from Aladdin. 1,2-Ethanedithiol (HSCH2CH2SH, 98+ %) and 1,2-ethylenediamine (H2NCH2CH2NH2, 99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Ammonia solution (NH3·H2O, 25%) was obtained from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co, Ltd. Thioglycolic acid (C2H4O2S, 98%) was purchased from Acros. 99.999% carbon dioxide was purchased from Henan Yuanzheng Technology Development Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used directly without any further purification.
Preparation of CZTSSe precursor solution and CZTSSe precursor films
The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.0699 g of Cu powder, 0.0494 g of Zn powder, 0.0859 g of Sn powder, 0.0857 g of S powder and 0.0234 g of Se powder to 5 mL of 1,2-ethylenediamine and 0.5 mL of 1,2-ethanedithiol. Then the mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at 70 °C, followed by the addition of 1 mL of stabilizer (match ratio of ethanolamine:thioglycolic acid:ethylene glycol methyl ether = 1:1:2) and stirred for another 0.5 h. Finally, a stable clear yellow solution was obtained. The precursor film was prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution onto molybdenum-coated SLG (Mo-SLG) in a nitrogen-filled glove box. After that, quick drying on a hot plate at 310 °C was followed. The spin-coating and drying steps were repeated 8 times to obtain CZTSSe precursor films with a desired thickness of ∼1.6 μm.
SCCO2 treatment
In order to find the optimal conditions for SCCO2 treatment, CZTSSe precursor films were treated under different supercritical conditions (different pressures, temperatures and times) in a cylindrical stainless steel autoclave. The pre-fabricated CZTSSe precursor films were vertically fixed onto a sample holder which was placed in the middle of the autoclave bottom. Before SCCO2 treatment, the autoclave was purged with CO2 at 0.5 MPa for 10 min to remove the air in the autoclave. Then, the CZTSSe precursor films were treated under different supercritical conditions for different times. Finally, the SCCO2 treatment was terminated using an ice bath, and CO2 was released slowly.
Fabrication of solar cell devices
Before fabrication, both SCCO2 treated and untreated CZTSSe precursor films were selenized at 550 °C in a square graphite box for 15 min. After selenization, the bilayer structure of CZTSSe films with large grains on the top and smaller grains at the bottom were obtained. To complete the fabrication of the devices, a CdS buffer layer (∼30 nm) and i-ZnO (∼70 nm)/ITO (∼200 nm) bilayers were successively deposited by chemical bath deposition and RF magnetron sputtering, respectively. A silver gate electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation on the top of the devices. Finally, a MgF2 anti-reflection layer with a thickness of ∼100 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation on the best CZTSSe solar cell.
Characterization
Current density voltage (J–V) curves of different devices were tested on a solar simulator from Newport under AM 1.5 illumination with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The infrared spectra of the SCCO2 treated and untreated CZTSSe precursor films were recorded at room temperature on a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Vertex 70, Brucker, Germany). The carbon content in both films was analyzed using a vario EL cube (Elementar, Germany). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a field emission SEM (Nova Nano SEM 450, FEI, USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different CZTSSe precursor films were obtained using a D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 15.4 Å). Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw Raman microscope (inVia, Renishaw, UK) using an excitation laser with 532 nm wavelength. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained on a SCS100 QE system (SCS100, Zolix, China), installed with a lock-in amplifier and a 150 W xenon light source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out on a PGSTAT 30 electrochemical system (PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Switzerland) from 102 Hz to 106 MHz at a bias voltage of −0.38 V.
Results and discussion
Optimization of supercritical conditions for CZTSSe solar cells
In order to obtain optimal supercritical conditions for boosting the efficiency of the prepared CZTSSe solar cells, optimization experiments were performed using a control variable method. In this work, three different factors including treatment temperature, treatment pressure and treatment time were investigated in detail. As shown in Fig. 1a, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solar cells increased with temperature to the maximum at 120 °C and then decreased. This phenomenon can be explained from the perspective of mass transfer. At a constant pressure, an increasing temperature favors extraction because of the increasing vapor pressure of extra organic species (at a constant pressure).23 However, an increasing temperature will decrease the density of supercritical carbon dioxide, thus reducing the extraction ability or capacity.24 As shown in Fig. 1b, the PCEs of solar cells decreased continuously with the pressure. Increasing the pressure of supercritical carbon dioxide causes the CZTSSe precursor films to be more tightly packed, thus decreasing the void fraction and reducing the extraction efficiency.25 Furthermore, excessively high pressures probably lead to the structural deterioration of CZTSSe precursor films. With the increase of treatment time, the PCEs of solar cells increased firstly and then decreased, reaching the highest value at 20 min (Fig. 1c). This result hinted that long time high pressure treatment may also cause the structural deterioration of CZTSSe precursor films. Finally the optimal supercritical conditions were determined as P = 7.5 MPa, T = 120 °C and t = 20 (min). Finally, a MgF2 anti-reflection layer with a thickness of ∼100 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation on the best CZTSSe solar cell. Fig. 1d shows the J–V curves of the CZTSSe solar cell fabricated from the CZTSSe film treated under optimal supercritical conditions and the reference cell (without treatment). Obviously, the VOC, JSC and FF are all promoted by the SCCO2 treatment, thus boosting the PCE from 9.28% to 11.23%, with an increase of about 21%.

Performance analysis
To further investigate the role of SCCO2 treatment in boosting the PCE, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the CZTSSe precursor film (Precursor film A), SCCO2 treated CZTSSe precursor film (Precursor film B) and their corresponding selenized CZTSSe films (Film A and Film B) were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2a, Precursor film A showed several vibration bands and peaks, which correspond well to the vibrational characteristics of different carbonaceous residues from solvents and/or additives. Bands at 3425 cm−1 and 1625 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration and flexion vibration of the O–H bond from the physisorbed water molecules.12,26 Three weak peaks located at 2970, 2923 and 2851 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of aliphatic C–H (CH3, CH2 and CH) from solvents and/or additives.8,27 The peak appearing at 1395 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of C–N in 1,2-ethylenediamine and ethanolamine.28–30 The peak located at 1043 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of C–O–C in ethylene glycol methyl ether.12,31 The band at 1087 cm−1 can be assigned to the vibrations of CS and N–H in the residual thioglycolic and 1,2-ethylenediamine/ethanolamine. The band at 945 cm−1 corresponds to the out-of-plane bending vibrations of the C–H bond, and the band at 802 cm−1 is assigned to the C–H bending vibration.32,33 In contrast, most vibration bands and peaks of Precursor film B became weaker than that of Precursor film A, indicating that parts of carbonaceous residues were extracted from the CZTSSe precursor film by SCCO2 treatment. After selenization, the vibration bands and peaks in precursor films were further weakened (Fig. 2b), suggesting that selenization can also reduce the carbonaceous residues. It should be noted that the Film B exhibits the weakest vibration bands and peaks, indicating the lowest amount of carbonaceous residues. Elemental analysis was further used to confirm the extraction of carbonaceous species. As shown in Table 1, the contents of the carbon element in Precursor film A, Precursor film B, Film A and Film B are 5.63%, 2.97%, 4.10% and 2.88%, respectively. Compared to Precursor film A, the changes of carbon content for Precursor film B and Film A are 2.66% and 1.53%, respectively. This result demonstrated that the SCCO2 treatment has more powerful capability for extracting carbonaceous residues than selenization.

To further verify the effect of supercritical CO2, comparison tests were carried out. Different CZTSSe precursor films were prepared using the same recipe and treated under similar conditions (non-supercritical CO2 or inert gas). Precursor film D and Precursor film E were treated using non-supercritical CO2 for 20 min (P = 7.0 < 7.3 MPa and T = 30 < 31 °C, respectively). Precursor film D was treated under a pressure lower than the critical pressure (P = 7.0 < 7.3 MPa) but at a temperature higher than the critical temperature (T = 120 > 31 °C) for 20 min. Precursor film E was treated under a pressure higher than the critical pressure (P = 7.5 > 7.3 MPa) but at a temperature lower than the critical temperature (T = 30 < 31 °C) for 20 min. Precursor film F was treated using inert nitrogen gas instead of CO2 under the optimal conditions (P = 7.5 MPa, T = 120 °C) for 20 min. The FT-IR spectra of these CZTSSe precursor films are shown in Fig. 3. As is shown, non-supercritical CO2 treatment and inert nitrogen gas treatment do not dramatically reduce the intensity of vibration bands and peaks of different organic species. These results indicated that supercritical CO2 plays a key role in the reduction of carbonaceous residues during the SCCO2 treatment.

SCCO2 treatment can reduce the carbonaceous residues in the final CZTSSe precursor films by extracting some organic species during the treatment, which may cause a dramatic morphological change of the treated CZTSSe precursor films. So, SEM images were collected to study the effect of SCCO2 treatment on the CZTSSe precursor film morphology. As shown in Fig. 4a and c, some apparent cracks could be observed in the CZTSSe precursor film without any treatment. These cracks were formed during quick drying on a hot plate because of the volatilization of different organic species. As shown in Fig. 4a–d, there are no significant morphological differences between CZTSSe precursor films with and without SCCO2 treatment. That is to say, the SCCO2 treatment does not destroy or dramatically change the CZTSSe precursor films. The cross-sectional SEM images revealed that CZTSSe precursor films with and without SCCO2 treatment are all porous and possess similar porosity (Fig. 4e and f). CZTSSe precursor films with and without SCCO2 treatment were then selenized under the same conditions and used for solar cell fabrication.

The surface morphologies of the selenized CZTSSe precursor films without (a) and with (b) SCCO2 treatment are shown in Fig. 5a and b. As is shown, selenization caused conspicuous grain growth in CZTSSe precursor films. Both selenized CZTSSe films consist of large grains in micrometers. However, some difference can also be observed. The large grains in the selenized CZTSSe precursor film without SCCO2 treatment are loosely connected with each other, and some voids could be observed. These voids may be caused from the volatilization of volatile organic species.34 In contrast, large grains in the selenized CZTSSe precursor film with SCCO2 treatment are closely connected with each other without any obvious voids. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that most of the volatile organic species were extracted from the CZTSSe precursor film by SCCO2 treatment. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, both selenized CZTSSe films have a distinct bilayer structure with a large grain layer on the top and a small grain layer at the bottom, which is quite common in CZTSSe absorber layers containing some of the carbonaceous residues.2,4 Small grain layers in CZTSSe absorber layers are believed to be caused by organic species in the CZTSSe precursor.2,8 During selenization, parts of organic species will volatilize and/or decompose at high temperature (550 °C), which may cause pores and/or cracks between the grains. These pores and/or cracks will hinder the growth of small grains into large grains. These voids may cause the deposition of CdS on the inside of the film and can act as a shunt pathway, and further may lead to a lower device performance.6,35 So, the amount of organic species as well as carbonaceous residues determined the thickness of the small grain layer. In other words, the thickness of the small grain layer can roughly reflect the amount of carbonaceous residues in selenized CZTSSe films.2,4 The thickness of the small grain layer in the selenized CZTSSe films without SCCO2 treatment is more than 1 μm, which is almost twice as much as that of selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment. This result indicated that the carbonaceous residues in the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment are much lower than those in the selenized CZTSSe films without SCCO2 treatment. That is to say, SCCO2 treatment can extract some organic species from CZTSSe precursor films, thus reducing the carbonaceous residues in the selenized CZTSSe films. It is well known that a small grain layer often encounters more intense composition fluctuations and larger numbers of grain boundaries than a large grain layer,4 which can increase the series resistance and carrier recombination centers.2–4,8 SCCO2 treatment can reduce the thickness of the small grain layer, and thus may reduce the series resistance as well as the carrier recombination in the fabricated CZTSSe solar cells. These favourable changes are beneficial and reasonable for the improvement of PCEs of CZTSSe film-based solar cells.2,6

XRD and Raman characterization methods were used to study the effect of SCCO2 treatment on the crystal phase of the CZTSSe precursor films and selenized CZTSSe films. As seen in Fig. 6a, there are no noticeable differences between CZTSSe precursor films without and with SCCO2 treatment. In addition to the characteristic peaks of the molybdenum substrate (40.5° and 73.6°), peaks at 27.3° and 45.4° corresponding to the (112) and (220)/(204) planes of CZTSSe were observed.6 Similarly, the Raman spectra of CZTSSe precursor films without and with SCCO2 treatment are almost the same, only one peak located at 328 cm−1 belonging to CZTS was found.5 All these results showed that SCCO2 treatment does not change the crystallization and phase of CZTSSe precursor films. The XRD patterns of the selenized CZTSSe films are shown in Fig. 7a and b. After selenization, the peaks of the selenized CZTSSe film became higher and shaper than those of the CZTSSe precursor film, indicating the recrystallization of CZTSSe during selenization. The predominant peaks are well indexed to the (112), (220)/(204) and (312) planes respectively, which can be assigned to kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (JCPDS no. 26-0575) and/or Cu2ZnSnSe4 (JCPDS no. 52-0868).6 As shown in Fig. 7a, Film B showed a relatively lower Mo peak than Film A, which could be explained by fewer pores and/or cracks as well as a better crystal quality in Film B. The enlarged view of the (112) peaks is shown in Fig. 7b. As is shown, the (112) peak of the selenized CZTSSe film with SCCO2 treatment slightly shifted to a small angle compared to that of the selenized CZTSSe film without SCCO2 treatment. The Raman spectra of the selenized CZTSSe films are shown in Fig. 7c and d. The main peaks located at about 201, 238 and 325 cm−1 are attributed to CZTSSe.5,11 The shift of the XRD and Raman peaks to a small angle suggested a decrease of sulfur/selenium ratio.36,37 The EDS analysis confirmed the decrease of the sulfur/selenium ratio from 0.38 to 0.26.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was used to study the spectral response of the CZTSSe solar cells fabricated from selenized the CZTSSe film with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) and without any treatment (ref). As shown in Fig. 8a, the EQE curves of two solar cells at short wavelengths (300–500 nm) are almost the same, indicating basically the same absorption originating from the CdS/i-ZnO/ITO top layers in CZTSSe cells.38 Meanwhile, the CZTSSe solar cell fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) has a stronger spectral response than that of the reference device in the long wavelength region. This result indicated that the CZTSSe solar cell fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) may have a better P–N junction as well as carrier diffusion.39 The band gap of CZTSSe films was calculated from the EQE curves according to the formula [E × ln(1 − EQE)]2 and is shown in Fig. 8a.40 The band gap of the CZTSSe film with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) is slightly reduced (from 1.07 eV to 1.03 eV) compared to that of the CZTSSe film without SCCO2 treatment (ref). This result is consistent with the XRD and Raman results as well as the sulfur/selenium ratio. The JSC could be calculated by the calculation of , which was integrated from the EQE spectrum over the AM 1.5G spectrum, as shown in Fig. 8b.41 The integral current density of the CZTSSe solar cells fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) and without any treatment (ref) is 35.7 and 33.0 mA cm−2, respectively. The larger JSC of CZTSSe solar cells fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) is responsible for the improvement in their PCEs.

The inset in (a) shows the corresponding band gaps of devices estimated from the EQE. (b) EQE curves of solar cells fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films and integrated JSC from EQE. 
In order to further understand the improvement of PCEs of solar cells by SCCO2 treatment, the diode ideality factor (A), series resistance (RS), shunt resistance (RSh) and shunt conductance (GSh) were calculated based on the method depicted by Hegedus et al.5,42 as shown in Table 2. Fig. 9 shows the dJ/dV vs. V curves (a) and dV/dJ vs. (J + JSC)−1 curves (b) for the solar cells fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) and without any treatment (ref). GSh was calculated from the smoothed J–V curve by plotting dJ/dV against V near JSC. And, the GSh values were calculated to be 1.56 and 3.17 for CZTSSe solar cells fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) and without any treatment (ref), respectively. RS can be derived from the linear fitting results of the dV/dJ vs. (J + JSC)−1 curves. Compared to the reference solar cell (without any treatment), the RS value for the solar cell fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment decreased from 0.49 to 0.27. Typically, RS and GSh are inversely proportional to FF, while GSh is inversely proportional to VOC and mainly influenced by the recombination in solar cells.43 As described above, SCCO2 treatment can reduce the carbonaceous residues as well as the thickness of the small grain layer, thus leading to better quality and charge transport of CZTSSe films. The relatively lower GSh value of the solar cell fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment confirmed the decrease of carrier recombination and current loss in CZTSSe solar cells.6,35 As a result, the charge in the CZTSSe absorber layer is enhanced, resulting in a decrease of series resistance RS. The synergy between GSh and RS finally contributed to a much higher FF and lower diode ideality factor of the solar cell fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment than those of the reference solar cell.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further used to study the effect of SCCO2 treatment on the series resistance and charge recombination process of CZTSSe solar cells. Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plots of CZTSSe solar cells fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films with SCCO2 treatment (SCCO2) and without any treatment (ref), which exhibit a similar semicircular shape. The intercept of the x-axis is regarded as the equivalent series resistance R0 (specifically, R0 = RES), and the diameter of the Nyquist plots is related to the recombination resistance RCT of the solar cells.44 Benefitting from the reduction of the carbonaceous residues by SCCO2 treatment, the recombination resistance (RCT) increased from 53 to 76 Ω. A bigger radius of the solar cell fabricated from the selenized CZTSSe films confirmed a larger RCT value, and means more different recombination in the device.5 This result demonstrated that the SCCO2 treatment can depress the carrier recombination in solar cells, and improve VOC, finally boosting the PCEs of the treated solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we proved that the proposed SCCO2 treatment is an effective strategy for reducing carbonaceous residues in CZTSSe films from precursor solution during precursor film deposition. In this work, we systematically study the effects of SCCO2 treatment on the grain size, phase and chemical composition of CZTSSe films, as well as charge transport and recombination in CZTSSe solar cells. The characterization results indicated that SCCO2 treatment can effectively extract parts of extra organic species from precursor films. The extraction of organic species is beneficial for carbonaceous residues reduction, crystal growth, small grains layer reduction and band gap adjustment, thus reducing the series resistance and the carrier recombination in the fabricated CZTSSe solar cells. These favourable changes are beneficial and reasonable for the improvement of PCEs of CZTSSe film-based solar cells. Finally, a champion device with 11.23% PEC was achieved from CZTSSe precursor films with SCCO2 treatment. This work provides a feasible and effective method for boosting the PCEs of solar cells fabricated by using the solution-based method.
