    , Accepted 17th March 2016First published on 17th March 2016AbstractDue to the large surface area-to-volume ratio and rapid electron transfer, two-dimensional (2D) TiO2 nanosheets with ultrathin thicknesses are synthesized by using a bottom-up strategy and these self-assembled nanosheet (NS)-based photocatalysts and photodetectors were explored for the first time. The influence of calcination temperature on microstructures and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanosheets were discovered and presented. The as-obtained TiO2 nanosheets were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV-vis spectrophotometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The following heat treatment process induced phase evolution from rutile to anatase. The TiO2 nanosheets calcined at 500 °C exhibited the best activity for photo-degradation of organic dyes under UV light irradiation. The obtained photodetector exhibits excellent performance with a high photocurrent to dark current ratio and fast response and recovery times. Additionally, we demonstrated that the device may have potential applications in the future low-power optoelectronics system.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) titanium oxide nanosheets regarded as a new class of materials, have been researched for nearly 2 decades due to their distinctive physical and chemical properties;1–3 and they have been studied for a wide range of fields including photo-induced applications, electro-chemical and dielectric devices, sensors, and biomedical applications.4–7 In the mid-1990s, Sasaki and co-workers studied the swelling–exfoliation behavior of layered titanates.8,9 Through ion-exchange, intercalation, swelling, and a mechanical shaking process, the layered titanates can be successfully disassembled into single sheets of titanium oxide, and these exfoliated titanium oxide nanosheets have received considerable attention due to their potential applications. For instance, Seung-Min Paek reported that nanocomposites prepared by pillaring Ti0.91O20.36− nanosheets with TiO2 nanoparticles via exfoliation–reassembling have high mesoporosity and can efficiently decompose a group of organic pollutants under UV light irradiation, which are superior to that of TiO2 nanosol particles.10 Itoh et al. used Ti0.91O20.36− nanosheet thin films as the hole-blocking layer to design a new type of inverted bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells.11 Such a design significantly decreases the leakage current, increases the open circuit voltage, and improves the fill factor, subsequently leading to an improved power conversion efficiency. Besides exfoliated TiO2 nanosheets, the recent breakthrough in facet-controlled synthesis of TiO2 has also led to numerous research projects on TiO2 nanosheets, in which the TiO2 nanoparticles can be controlled to have preferential growth along some directions to present an apparent 2D morphology.12,13 Important progress was made very recently by Han and co-workers,14 who prepared nanosized anatase TiO2 single crystals with up to 89% exposed (001) facets which possess an excellent photodegradation efficiency towards methyl orange. In addition, Wu et al. synthesized anatase TiO2 single crystals with a high percentage of exposed (001) facets and the synthesized anatase TiO2 single crystals were used to prepare photo-anodes for DSSCs.15 Over 40% enhancement of the DSSC conversion efficiency was achieved compared to DSSCs based on Degussa P25. In 2014, Sun et al. reported a generalized bottom-up approach to molecular self-assembly synthesis of ultrathin 2D nanosheets of transition metal oxides.16 As these nanosheets possess a confined thickness, high specific surface area and chemically reactive facets, they may be promising materials for various nanostructured devices. Although many reports have shown the superior performance of exfoliated TixO2 nanosheets and facet-controlled TiO2 nanosheets, there are very few reports focusing on the performance of self-assembled TiO2 nanosheets. We believe that this study is essential to further understand the use of two-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures.
In this work, ultrathin and uniformly dispersed 2D TiO2 nanosheets were prepared by a surfactant-assisted self-assembly method followed by heat treatment. Apart from improving the crystallinity, we find that the heat treatment process can induce phase evolution of TiO2 nanosheets from rutile to anatase. This abnormal phenomenon can significantly improve the UV-responsive properties of self-assembled TiO2 nanosheets due to higher charge mobility and a longer excited state lifetime of anatase TiO2.17 A photocatalytic efficiency as high as 94.2% has been delivered for the degradation of RhB after 1 h UV irradiation by controlling the calcination temperature, which is superior to that of P25 TiO2, a commercial benchmark photocatalyst. In addition to this, in our study we observed that 2D TiO2 nanosheets also manifest excellent photocatalytic activity towards other organic pollutants, such as methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB).
The nanosheet-based photodetectors exhibited an ultralow dark current (2.63 pA), hence leading to a significant higher photocurrent to dark current ratio (Ilight/Idark ∼ 69398 at 3 mW cm−2, corresponding to an ultrahigh photoresponse sensitivity of 2638600%) than that of previously reported TiO2 photodetectors.18–20 A decent Ilight/Idark ratio (∼39) could still be achieved even when the device was only exposed to light as weak as 1.6 μW cm−2. Moreover, a fast recovery time (1.7 s) and device stability were demonstrated in this work. However, the experimental fact confirmed that the maximum photoresponse current of the photodetector was only 69.4 nA at 1 V of the applied bias voltage. The displayed high photoresponse sensitivity and lower photocurrent may render the photodetector potentially applicable for low-power optoelectronics.21
2. Experimental section
Fabrication of TiO2 nanosheets (NS)
In a typical synthesis,16 tetrabutyltitanate (TBOT, 1.26 g) was added into 0.74 g concentrated HCl solution and vigorously stirred so that the prepared solution was identified as solution A. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g polyethylene oxide–polypropylene oxide–polyethylene oxide (PEO20–PPO70–PEO20, Pluronic P123) in 3 g of ethanol (EtOH). After stirring for 15 min, solution B was added into solution A and the mixed solution had been stirred for another 30 min. The obtained precursor solution was statically aged for 1 day. After aging, 2.5 ml of as-prepared precursor solution was mixed with 20 ml ethylene glycol (EG) and then transferred into a 45 ml autoclave, heated at 150 °C for 20 h, and then cooled down naturally. After hydrothermal reaction, the obtained precipitates were centrifuged and washed separately with distilled water and ethanol three times, and the wet samples were dried at 60 °C for 24 h in order to obtain white powders of TiO2. In order to improve the crystalline quality and other properties, the dried TiO2 samples were calcined in air at different temperatures of 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C for 2 h. The samples were designated as TiO2-x, where x denotes the calcination temperature.
Material characterization
The composition and phase of the 2D TiO2 nanosheets were evaluated using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'Pert Pro) with Cu Kα1 radiation. The chemical states of the nanostructures were determined by XPS (Kratos AXIS UltraDLD) with Al Kα radiation. The morphology of the samples was observed with a SEM (Hitachi S-4800). TEM and HRTEM observations were carried out using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 operating at 300 kV. The thickness of the 2D TiO2 ultrathin nanosheets was determined by using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. The FTIR spectra were recorded by using a Nicolet NEXUS 670 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). UV-vis adsorption spectra were recorded by using a PerkinElmer 950 UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA) with a wavelength range varying from 200 to 700 nm.
Photodetector performance test

IV curve and dark current measurements were performed using a DS345 30 MHz synthesized function generator and an SR 570 low-noise current preamplifier. A UV detector (Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, UV-A) was used to quantify UV irradiance. During measurement, the NS photodetector was initially shielded from UV exposure, allowing only the UV detector to be exposed. After recording UV irradiance incident on the commercial detector, the photodetector was uncovered and the response was measured. After 60 seconds of exposure, the photodetector was shielded again and allowed to recover for 60 seconds. These procedures were repeated over a range of UV light irradiances from 1.6 μW cm−2 to 3 mW cm−2.
Photocatalytic performance test
To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanosheets, 20 mg of TiO2 samples (e.g., TiO2-as grown, TiO2-300, TiO2-400, TiO2-500, and TiO2-600) were dispersed in 100 mL of a 10 mg L−1 aqueous Rhodamine B (RhB) solution. The mixture was first stirred in the dark for 30 min to reach the adsorption/desorption equilibrium between the TiO2 catalyst and RhB. After that, the mixture was treated under UV radiation (wavelength peak at 365 nm) with continuous stirring. A small amount of the solution was taken out every 20 min for UV spectrum measurement after removal of the solid catalyst by centrifugation. The concentration of RhB was determined from the absorbance at the wavelength of 555 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion
Structural and morphological analysis of TiO2 nanosheets
In order to investigate the changes of the phase structure of the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets at various calcination temperatures, XRD measurements were performed. Fig. S1† shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized TiO2 nanosheets under different conditions. At a calcination temperature ≤400 °C, TiO2 nanosheets contained two phases named anatase which is the main phase and rutile being the minor phase of TiO2. With increasing calcination temperatures, the intensities of anatase diffraction peaks steadily increase, and meanwhile the intensities of rutile diffraction peaks decrease gradually and ultimately disappear. At 500 °C and 600 °C, only the anatase TiO2 diffraction peaks are detected, which means that a heat treatment process can induce phase evolution of TiO2 nanosheets from rutile to anatase. Our experimental facts suggest that anatase may be more stable than rutile when nanosheets are only a few nanometers in thickness. The relative phase stability of nanosheets was found to be reverse at a very fine size due to the contribution of surface free energy.22 The width of the main peak of the anatase became narrower with increasing calcination temperature. This indicated the formation of greater crystallites. The obtained results suggest that a high calcination temperature is favored for the formation of pure anatase and enhancement of crystallinity of TiO2 nanosheets.

Fig. 1 illustrates SEM and TEM images of the as-grown 2D TiO2 nanosheets. These nanosheets can be clearly distinguished in the high-magnification SEM image (Fig. 1a) and low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 1b). From these microscopy images (Fig. 1a–c), it can be seen that the products are all nanosheets with their edges rolled up due to surface tension, which is similar to the general behavior of graphene. The size of each TiO2 nanosheet is about 200–300 nm. The synthesized 2D TiO2 nanosheets present a well-crystallized anatase phase, as demonstrated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization (Fig. 1d). The fringes with a lattice spacing of about 0.21 nm corresponding to the (210) plane of the rutile TiO2 structure are detected. In addition, the detailed electron microscopy characterization images of the synthesized TiO2 nanosheets calcined at different temperatures are also shown in Fig. 2a–i. The thickness of the synthesized 2D TiO2 nanosheets is determined based on the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. As shown in ESI Fig. S2,† the AFM image of the as-grown 2D TiO2 nanosheets and the corresponding statistical thickness distribution have been provided. The thickness of the TiO2 nanosheets is mainly distributed within 1–7 nm, corresponding to 2–10 stacking layers of the monolayer (monolayer thickness is around 0.62 nm (ref. 16)). The influence of the calcination temperature on the crystallite size and crystallinity of TiO2 nanosheets is taken into account. The crystallite size and crystallinity increase with increasing calcination temperature, but the sheet-like structure of TiO2 is still preserved, as shown in Fig. 2e. The above results coincided with the XRD results as described above.

(e) High-magnification SEM and low-magnification TEM images of TiO2 nanosheets calcined at 500 °C, showing the features of nanosheets that are still clearly exhibited; (b, d, g, i) HRTEM images of TiO2 nanosheets calcined at 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C, based on observation with the electron beam steered along the [010] direction. 
The roles of the added P123 surfactant, EG and ethanol (EtOH) in the formation of the 2D TiO2 nanosheets were also investigated in our experiment. Fig. S3† presents the morphologies of the nanostructures of TiO2 that were synthesized from the solutions: (a, g) without the addition of P123, (b, h) with the addition of 1 wt% P123 and EtOH, (c, i) with the addition of 20 wt% P123 and EtOH, (d, j) without the addition of EG, (e, k) with the addition of 7 wt% P123 and H2O, and (f, i) with the addition of 20 wt% P123 and H2O. In short, all the morphologies of the nanostructures with modified procedures showed huge deviation from that of the 2D nanosheets.
The FTIR spectra of the samples (TiO2-as grown, TiO2-500) are shown in Fig. 3. It is believed that the broad peak at 3400 cm−1 and the peak at 1630 cm−1 correspond to the surface water-absorption and hydroxyl groups.23 Obviously, with increasing calcination temperature, the surface-water-absorption and hydroxyl groups decreased slightly. This was due to the decrease of specific surface areas and the increase of crystallinity of TiO2 nanosheets, which caused the reduction of the absorbed water and crystal defect. The main peak at 400–700 cm−1 shown in Fig. 3b was attributed to Ti–O stretching and Ti–O–Ti bridging stretching modes,23 again due to the enhancement of crystallinity of TiO2 nanosheets. This was in good accordance with our XRD and TEM results. Besides, two weak bands at 2927 and 2870 cm−1 (νCH and νCH2) in the as-grown TiO2 nanosheets could be attributed to the characteristic frequencies of residual organic species, which is not completely removed by washing with distilled water.23 Further observation indicated that the peaks at 2927 and 2870 cm−1 almost disappeared for the nanosheets calcined at 500 °C. This could be attributed to the decomposition of organic species. According to the TG curve of as-grown TiO2 nanosheets as shown in Fig. S4,† a temperature of 500 °C for calcination can ensure complete decomposition of residual organic species.

The dependence of the absorption characteristics of TiO2 nanosheets on calcination temperature was studied and is shown in Fig. 4. The band gap energies estimated from the intercept of the tangents (Eg = 1240/λ) of the plots are 3.38 and 3.14 eV. The UV-Vis spectra of the as-grown TiO2 nanosheets showed an obvious blue-shift compared with the calcined TiO2 nanosheets. The TiO2 nanosheets calcined at 500 °C showed a larger absorption region in the 200–400 nm range, which is beneficial for improving the photo-quantum efficiency and photocatalytic activity. The widened absorbance might be largely assigned to the enhanced crystallinity and larger crystallite size.16,23

Unlike the bulk crystals, the ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets have an extremely high percentage of surfaces. The as-grown 2D TiO2 exhibits an ultrahigh specific surface area of 422 m2 g−1, which is almost eightfold higher than that of the commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (∼50 m2 g−1).16 With increasing calcination temperature, the specific surface areas decrease slightly to 286.9, 216.7, 165.9, and 41.8 m2 g−1, respectively. It has been reported that the exposed surfaces present different chemical states from the inner bulk atoms.24 Therefore, the surface chemical states of the 2D TiO2 nanosheets are examined by the XPS technique (Fig. 5a and b). It is of interest that the core levels of the titanium element, T 2p show a 0.8–1.3 eV shift to lower binding energy compared with the corresponding stoichiometric bulk crystal.24 The lower binding energy for surface atoms has been reported to be the result of electron gain of titanium atoms from surrounding oxygen atoms, resulting from the dramatic distortion of the crystal structure that occurs in the surface-dominated ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets.25,26 The peak at about 457.2 eV shown in Fig. 5a is probably ascribed to Ti–C bonds, derived from the un-hydrolysed butoxy groups in the Ti(OH)x(OC4H9)4−x complex. However, its formation mechanism still needs to be further investigated. Fig. 5b shows the corresponding high-resolution XPS spectra of the O 1s region obtained on the surface of TiO2 nanosheets before and after calcination. The O 1s region could be fitted into three peaks. The low-binding-energy peak is ascribed to the Ti–O bonds in TiO2. The medium binding-energy peak is associated with O2− ions that are in oxygen-deficient regions within the matrix. There are also indications supporting the formation of –OH groups on the surface. The change of this component in part is also connected to a change in the concentration of oxygen vacancies. Finally, the appearance of the high-binding-energy peak indicates the presence of loosely bound oxygen on the surface of nanosheets belonging to –CO3 or adsorbed H2O.27,28 It is interesting to note that the peak areas of hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water of the calcined nanosheets are smaller than that of as-grown nanosheets, indicating that the former contained fewer crystalline defects due to their high crystallinity, and smaller specific surface areas due to their larger crystallite size. These also supported and confirmed the above XRD and TEM results.

Photocatalytic activity measurements

Fig. 6 illustrates the broad study of the photocatalytic activity of these self-assembled TiO2 nanosheets under UV irradiation, and the photocatalytic activity was studied for samples calcined at different temperatures. Fig. 6a shows the absorption spectra evolution of RhB solutions with the TiO2-500 catalyst as a function of irradiation time. The absorption intensity of the RhB solution decreased with UV irradiation time. Under UV irradiation in a period of 1 h, the TiO2-500 sample is able to degrade over 94.2% of the original organic dye (Fig. 6b). At the same time, the photograph in Fig. S5† reveals clearly the dramatic color change of RhB. The inset of Fig. 6b shows the fact that the band at 555 nm blue-shifts by as much as 58 nm during photodegradation, which is attributed to N-demethylation of RhB.29,30 The curves of changes in relative concentrations of RhB (calculated from the absorption at 555 nm) versus UV irradiation time for each sample are demonstrated in Fig. 6c, and the logarithms of the values are shown in Fig. 6d. The linear relationship between −ln(C/C0) and time demonstrated that the overall kinetics of the photocatalytic decomposition reactions were of first order. TiO2-500 showed the highest photocatalytic activity and photodegradation rate than that of TiO2 calcined at different temperatures. The good photocatalytic activity of TiO2-500 was further evaluated by comparing it to Degussa P25 TiO2. As shown in Fig. S6,† TiO2-500 exhibits better activity than P25 TiO2. The degradation efficiency of RhB is about 40% for P25 TiO2 after irradiation for 60 min, which is much lower than that for TiO2-500 (94.2%, 60 min). The apparent rate constant for RhB photodegradation is about 0.0471 min−1 for TiO2-500, which is about 4.3 times that of P25 TiO2 (0.0108 min−1). These results imply that TiO2-500 is superior to Degussa P25 for RhB photodegradation.

Inset shows the wavelength blue-shifts of the 555 nm band. (c) Photo-degradation rate of RhB by different photocatalysts under UV irradiation. (d) The linear fitting of −ln(C/C0) versus the irradiation time. 
It has been noted that the photocatalytic activity of as-grown TiO2 nanosheets with the largest specific surface area is only about 30%, indicating that crystallinity plays an important role in photocatalysis. The crystallinity degree increases with increasing calcination temperature. Moreover, the intrinsic reason for the crystallinity degree is the effect of defect on photocatalytic activity, at which photogenerated electrons and holes can recombine.31–33 The high crystallinity is favorable for improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Besides, the phase evolution from rutile to anatase induced by calcination should not be ignored; furthermore, many studies have confirmed that the anatase phase TiO2 is a better photocatalytic material than rutile TiO2 due to its low recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and thus enhanced the photocatalytic activity.34–36 Therefore, an enhanced crystallinity and a changed phase structure with increasing calcination temperature contributes to the superior photocatalytic activity of TiO2-500.
Then we demonstrate the potential availability of these 2D TiO2-500 nanosheets as an excellent photocatalyst for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB). Fig. S7† shows the results of photodecomposition of MO and MB under UV irradiation. It can be seen that the degradation efficiency of MO and MB is as high as 92% and 96% after 2 h UV irradiation.
Performance of TiO2 nanosheet (NS) UV photodetectors
To further explore the applicability of self-assembled TiO2 nanosheets, we examined the performance of ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors by depositing the 2D TiO2-500 nanosheets on Ag electrodes (Fig. 7). As it is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7, a 150 nm thick layer of Ag IDT-electrodes was fabricated on a glass substrate through a standard photolithograph process. Then, well-dispersed, 1 mg ml−1 TiO2-500 nanosheets in ethanol solution was dropped onto an Ag electrode-glass substrate to form an NS UV photodetector. The UV photodetector was then dried at 100 °C for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 8a, ohmic contact between the Ag electrodes and the TiO2 nanosheets on the glass substrate was confirmed by IV measurements. The dark current of this UV-photodetector at 1 V is ultralow (∼2.63 pA). The ultralow dark current of this photodetector may partially arise from the physical boundaries among the TiO2 nanosheets, which can hinder charge transport.37 The device showed a significantly higher photocurrent to dark current ratio (Ilight/Idark ∼ 69398 at 3 mW cm−2, corresponding to a ultrahigh photoresponse sensitivity of 2638600%). Because of the ultralow dark current, another remarkable feature of this device is the good photosensitivity to weak light illumination. As shown in the inset of Fig. 8d, a decent Ilight/Idark ratio (∼39) can still be achieved even when the device was only exposed to light as weak as 1.6 μW cm−2. However, when a higher illumination intensity was used, the maximum photoresponse current of the photodetector was only 69.4 nA. This demonstration may imply that the device has potential applications in the future low-power nano-optoelectronics system. Time-resolved UV photoresponse measurements under an irradiance of 3 mW cm−2 and 1 V bias (Fig. 8b) showed the stability of the photocurrent response. There is nearly no significant variation in the signal amplitude during the on/off cycles, indicating a good reversibility and stability of the device. Peak photoresponse currents under different UV irradiances are shown in Fig. 8d. The recovery time (τ), defined as the time for the photoresponse current to drop to 1/e (37%) of the maximum photoresponse current,38 was further investigated. The τ value was found to be ∼1.7 s for the NS UV photodetector. The superior photoresponse sensitivity and fast recovery time of the NS UV photodetector can be attributed to the high specific surface area and rapid electron transfer ability.

4. Conclusions
In summary, ultrathin 2D TiO2 nanosheets were successfully synthesized by a surfactant-assisted self-assembly method. We demonstrated that heat treatment can induce structural evolution from rutile to anatase of these self-assembled nanosheets, leading to superior UV-responsive properties of TiO2 nanosheets, e.g. a photocatalytic efficiency as high as 94.2% has been delivered for the degradation of RhB after 1 h UV irradiation, which is superior to that of the benchmark Degussa P25 TiO2. A novel NS UV photodetector prototype based on self-assembled TiO2-500 nanosheets, with high Ilight/Idark ratio, fast response and recovery times, and high durability has been demonstrated. Under a UV irradiance of 3 mW cm−2 and 1 V bias, the Ilight/Idark ratio for the NS UV photodetector reached 69398. These findings show the promising potential of these self-assembled TiO2 nanosheets for practical applications such as in photoelectric or photochemical devices, especially low-power optoelectronic systems.
