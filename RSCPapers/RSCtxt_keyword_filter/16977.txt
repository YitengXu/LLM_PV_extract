    , Accepted 7th July 2014First published on 9th July 2014AbstractA new fluorinated low band gap copolymer, poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-4,7-(5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PDTSBT-F), was designed and synthesized. The introduction of fluorine atom to a classical low band gap copolymer (PDTSBT) has a little influence on the polymer absorption spectrum and band gap, which was 1.48 eV for PDTSBT-F. However, the HOMO level was lowered to −5.17 eV for PDTSBT-F, the film crystallinity was improved, and PDTSBT-F showed higher charge carrier mobility than its non-fluorinated analogue (PDTSBT). For the PDTSBT-F/PC71BM device, a Jsc of 15.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.70 V, and a FF of 0.60 were attained, resulting in a PCE of 6.70%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest value to date in devices based on copolymers with C-, Si- and Ge-bridged dithiophene as the electron-rich unit and benzothiadiazole derivatives as electron-deficient unit. A high PCE in combination with a wide absorption spectrum in the visible range could induce PDTSBT-F to be a potentially promising low band gap polymer for polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) as a renewable energy source have been gaining increasing attention owing to their potential of low cost, light weight and large-area fabrication.1–4 Significant improvement in device performance has been achieved over the past few years through the development of photovoltaic materials,5,6 interfacial layer,7–9 and device architecture.10,11 D–A copolymers composed of alternant electron-rich unit (D) and electron-deficient unit (A) are widely employed as electron donor materials for high efficiency PSCs. This rational design concept has been confirmed to be effective in tuning the band gap, energy levels and hole mobility of polymers.6,12–15 Among these polymers, poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl] (PDTSBT) has been attracting more interest as a potentially highly efficient donor material because of its wide absorption response in the range of 300–850 nm, which has a good match with the solar spectrum.16–18 Many efforts, including thermal annealing,19 solvent vapor annealing,20 inverted device geometry,21,22 and optimizing alkyl chain,23 have been made towards improving the PDTSBT-based photovoltaic performance. However, the low open circuit voltage (Voc) significantly limits the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for PDTSBT-based devices, where [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acts as electron acceptor material. Therefore, further improvement in the efficiency of PDTSBT-based devices is expected to be attained by increasing Voc, while maintaining the high short current density and fill factor. Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor or lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor is an effective way to increase the Voc.24–26 One fullerene derivative with a high-lying LUMO level, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), has been effectively employed in devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), while it rarely shows good performance in the low band gap polymer-based devices, it has an adverse effect on the PDTSBT-based device.25,27–29 Thus, lowering the HOMO level of PDTSBT could be a better alternative method to increase the Voc and the device performance.
Recently, the application of fluorine atom as an electron-withdrawing group on the polymer backbone has attracted more interest due to the ability of simultaneously lowering the HOMO and LUMO levels, which has a little effect on the polymer band gap and thus enhances the Voc.6,13,15,26,30,31 Moreover, the size of fluorine atom is similar to a hydrogen atom, which would not introduce additional steric hindrance, and its strong electronegativity could increase the intra- and inter-molecular interactions through F⋯H, F⋯S interactions, which may be favorable for the polymer self-assembly and improve the crystallinity. Moreover, the oligomeric DTS-fluorinated-BT compound as a donor material shows interesting photovoltaic performance,32 which makes copolymers based on DTS-fluorinated-BT more appealing. Based on this strategy, it may be an effective way to enhance the performance of device based on the classical low band gap copolymer PDTSBT by adding fluorine atom on PDTSBT chain.
In this work, we synthesized a new partially fluorinated low band gap copolymer, poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-4,7-(5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PDTSBT-F), which was formed by copolymerizing monofluoro-substituted benzothiadiazole unit with dithienosilole unit. The effect of fluorination on the optical, electrochemical, crystallinity, charge carrier mobility and photovoltaic properties of PDTSBT-F were investigated, and the non-fluorinated analogue PDTSBT was also studied for comparison. It is interesting that the device PCE was significantly increased from 4.68% for PDTSBT/PC71BM blend to 6.70% for PDTSBT-F/PC71BM blend, which indicates PDTSBT-F could be a promising low band gap candidate for photovoltaic devices.
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The preparation of the 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole and 4,7-dibromo-5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole were performed in a manner similar to previous literature.16,33 Compound M2 was prepared by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) bromination via electrophilic substitution to replace the trimethylsilyl moiety, which acted as protecting group. Lithiation of compound M2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride, afforded M3. Compound M3 was difficult to purify by recrystallization or column chromatography, and it was directly copolymerized with the electron-deficient units to generate the corresponding copolymers via a modified Stille coupling reaction with Pd2(dba)3 as catalyst and P(o-tolyl)3 as the ligand. In order to achieve high molecular weights, a stoichiometric ratio of 1.04:1.00 (compound M3 to the corresponding acceptor monomers) was applied in the reaction with the intention of compensating for the possible contamination of M3 resulting from organometallic tin compounds. The crude copolymers were purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction to remove oligomers and residual catalyst. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of polymers were measured by GPC in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) at 150 °C with polystyrene as a standard. The Mn for PDTSBT-F was 16000 g mol−1 with a PDI of 1.78, while the Mn of PDTSBT was 22000 g mol−1 with a PDI of 2.38 (Fig. S1 in ESI†). The thermal stabilities of PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) were 420 and 440 °C for PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT (Fig. S2†), respectively, indicating that both copolymers have good thermal stability.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT were measured in CB solutions and in thin films. As shown in Fig. 1a, both polymers in hot solutions (90 °C) showed similar absorption characteristic with a main absorption peak at around 670 nm, which may be due to the similar polymer backbone. For the PDTSBT-F solution, there was a weak shoulder peak at about 730 nm, which could be attributed to the π–π interaction of polymer chains,16,19 indicating intermolecular interaction of PDTSBT-F in solution was slightly increased. When both solutions were cooled to room temperature, an obvious red-shift of the main peak was observed from 670 to 690 nm, which indicates that the polymer chains showed high planarity compared to that in a hot solution. Moreover, the π–π interaction peak was found in both polymer solutions with a slight blue-shift of about 10 nm for PDTSBT-F solution (730 nm) compared to that of PDTSBT solution (740 nm). The intensity of π–π interaction peak in PDTSBT-F was slightly higher than that of PDTSBT, which is consistent with the result in hot solutions. Fig. 1b exhibits the absorption spectra of both polymers in films. In comparison with the absorption of polymer solutions, the π–π interaction peak in both films became intense and red-shifted with peaks at 750 nm for PDTSBT-F and 760 nm for PDTSBT, respectively, which indicates more enhanced intermolecular interactions or ordered structures in the solid state. The slightly stronger intensity of π–π interaction peak in PDTSBT-F confirms improved intermolecular interaction by the addition of fluorine atom, which was also observed in other fluorinated copolymers.13,15 An optical band gap of 1.48 eV for PDTSBT-F was determined from the film absorption onset, which was similar to that of PDTSBT (1.46 eV). It is worthy to note that the absorption spectrum and optical band gap of the new polymer PDTSBT-F were quite similar to those of the nonfluorinated analogue PDTSBT, indicating the introduction of fluorine atom on the copolymer chain has a little effect on the band gap and absorption spectra. The absorption characteristics of both polymers are listed in Table 1.

Cyclic voltammetry was employed to study electrochemical properties and determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both polymers as thin films. The potential of the calomel reference electrode was internally calibrated by using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. The oxidation/reduction onsets of polymers were determined at the position where the current began to differ from the baseline. Cyclic voltammogram of PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The reduction onset potentials (Eredonset) of PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT were −1.54 V and −1.60 V versus Fe/Fe+, respectively, while the oxidation onset potentials (Eoxonset) were 0.37 V and 0.2 V versus Fe/Fe+, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels, as well as the energy gap of the polymers, were calculated from the onset of the oxidation potential and reduction potential according to the equations: HOMO = −eV(Eoxonset + 4.8), LUMO = −eV(Eredonset + 4.8) and EECg = eV(Eoxonset − Eredonset). The estimated HOMO energy levels were −5.17 eV for PDTSBT-F and −5.00 eV for PDTSBT, while the estimated LUMO levels of PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT were −3.26 eV and −3.20 eV, respectively. It can be found that the HOMO level was significantly decreased from −5.00 eV to −5.17 eV by changing the electron-deficient unit from benzothiadiazole to monofluorosubstituted benzothiadiazole, and the LUMO level was only slightly lowered from −3.20 eV to −3.26 eV. The result indicates that introducing fluorine atom onto PDTSBT could reduce the LUMO and HOMO levels to different degrees, and this difference between HOMO and LUMO decrease degree results in the slightly increased band gap in PDTSBT-F. A deeper HOMO energy level is desirable for higher Voc, since the Voc is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of donor material and the LUMO level of acceptor material. The eventual efficiency of the devices is the trade-off of the band-gap and Voc, while maintaining a sufficient LUMO–LUMO offset of the donor and acceptor materials.

Crystallinity and charge transporting properties of polymers
To investigate the effect of fluorination on the crystallinity of polymers, out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out for PDTSBT-F and the nonfluorinated analogue (PDTSBT) films. As shown in Fig. 3, both polymers showed a diffraction peak at 2θ of around 5.3° (16.66 Å), which was attributed to the reflection of (100) planes, i.e. the lamellar packing.19,34 It is noticed that a weak π–π stacking peak at 2θ of around 25.2° (3.53 Å) existed in PDTSBT, which was so broad and weak that its contribution to the crystallinity could be neglected. For PDTSBT-F, there was no obvious shift for the position of (100) diffraction peak, which indicates that the fluorine atom on polymer chain possibly has little influence on the spacing of the lamellar packing. This may be due to the similar size of the fluorine and hydrogen atom, which would not lead to additional steric hindrance in the lamellar packing. However, the intensity of the lamellar packing in the PDTSBT-F film was much stronger than that of the PDTSBT film, which reflects the increased crystallinity in the PDTSBT-F film. Taking the difference between PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT into account, we suggest that the significant improvement in crystallinity of PDTSBT-F film may benefit from the noncovalent F–H, F–F interactions of fluorinated polymer chains.

The hole mobility (μh) of polymer films was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method to investigate the charge carrier transport in PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT films. The fabrication procedure is described in the Experimental section. Fig. 4a exhibits the hole-only dark I–V curves of both polymer films, in which the hole-only current of PDTSBT-F film was higher than that of PDTSBT film. The SCLC hole mobility was estimated by fitting the hole-only I–V curves with the SCLC model and Mott–Gurney law: ln(I/V2) = 0.89β(V/L)1/2 + ln(9με0εS/(8L3))(1)where I is the current, V is the applied voltage, β is the field-activation factor, L is the thickness of polymer film, μ is the mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ε is the relative permittivity, and S is the area of polymer film.20,35,36Fig. 4b shows linear fits of the plots of ln(I/V2) versus V1/2 of both polymers, which is based on the SCLC model, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The μh of PDTSBT-F was 1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was almost two times higher than that of PDTSBT (μh = 5.54 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). This result indicates that the addition of fluorine atom to the polymer chain is favorable for charge carrier mobility; moreover, it indicates effective charge carrier transportation for the vertically structured device based on PDTSBT-F.

Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic device performance
With similar band gap, deeper HOMO level and enhanced film crystallinity for PDTSBT-F relative to PDTSBT, the BHJ photovoltaic device employing PDTSBT-F as donor would be expected to be better than that of PDTSBT. The devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The performance of PDTSBT-F-based devices was optimized by the ratio of donor and acceptor, addition of an additive (1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)), and thermal annealing treatment. The J–V curves of the devices under different processing conditions are exhibited in Fig. S3† and the corresponding performance characteristics are listed in Table S1.† The optimized device was processed from PDTSBT-F:PC71BM (1:1.5, w:w) solution containing 1 vol% DIO, and thermally annealed at 80 °C for 10 min. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curve of the optimized PDTSBT-F-based device and that of PDTSBT for comparison. The photovoltaic performance of corresponding devices is listed in Table 2. The PSCs made from PDTSBT showed a PCE of 4.68%, which was comparable to the literature.16,20 In contrast, the device based on PDTSBT-F exhibited a significantly improved PCE of 6.70% with a Jsc of 15.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.70 V, and a FF of 0.60. Moreover, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices based on both polymers was investigated in the air. As shown in Fig. 5b, both devices exhibited a broad photo-to-current response in the range of 300–850 nm. The EQE of device based on PDTSBT-F was higher than that of PDTSBT-based device from 300 to 770 nm, which agrees with the higher Jsc in PDTSBT-F device. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves are consistent with the measured Jsc within 7% deviation, which may be due to oxidation of the Ca layer in the air, and the possible mismatch between simulated sunlight and AM 1.5G solar spectrum. These PCE and EQE results indicate that the device performance based on dithienosilole–benzothiadiazole copolymer can be effectively improved by the addition of fluorine atom to the copolymer chain.

The enhancement in PCE of the PDTSBT-F-based device apparently results from the simultaneous increase in Jsc, Voc and FF. The improved Voc (0.06 V) was attributed to the deeper HOMO level of PDTSBT-F than that of PDTSBT, while the enhancement in Jsc and FF could be attributed to the suppressed charge recombination by introducing the fluorine substituent,37,38 and the improved crystallinity of PDTSBT-F/PC71BM blend film, as shown in Fig. 6, which could bring benefit to the charge carrier transport. The device performance is also dependent on the morphology of the active layer, in which suitable length-scale of phase separation is favorable for high efficiency. As shown in Fig. 7, the PDTSBT domains mixed well with PC71BM aggregates, which formed relatively small phase separation in the PDTSBT/PC71BM film. For comparison, phase separation of the PDTSBT-F/PC71BM film was slightly larger with obvious PDTSBT-F nanocrystallites, which may also be beneficial to the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation. AFM (Fig. S4†) also revealed slightly increased aggregation in the PDTSBT-F/PC71BM film. As a consequence, by combing increased Voc, Jsc and FF, a much higher PCE (6.70%) was achieved for the PDTSBT-F-based device compared to the PDTSBT-based device.

Conclusions
In this work, we synthesized a fluorinated dithienosilole–benzothiadiazole copolymer, PDTSBT-F, by Stille polymerization. The optical, electrochemical, crystallinity, charge carrier mobility and photovoltaic properties were investigated for both PDTSBT-F and PDTSBT. It was found that the fluorine atom has a little effect on the band gap and absorption spectrum of PDTSBT-F, which was similar to that of the nonfluorinated analogue (PDTSBT). However, the HOMO level was lowered from −5.00 eV for PDTSBT to −5.17 eV for PDTSBT-F, and the crystallinity was obviously improved by the addition of fluorine atom on the copolymer chain, which also resulted in an almost two times higher hole mobility in PDTSBT-F compared to PDTSBT. Most importantly, the device made from PDTSBT-F/PC71BM showed a PCE of 6.70% with a Jsc of 15.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.70 V, and a FF of 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE value to date in devices based on copolymers with C-, Si- and Ge-bridged dithiophene as the electron-rich unit and benzothiadiazole derivatives as the electron-deficient unit. The lowered HOMO level should be responsible for the increased Voc, while the high Jsc and FF result from the improved crystallinity and morphology of PDTSBT-F/PC71BM film. These results indicate that the device performance based on dithienosilole–benzothiadiazole copolymer can be effectively improved by the addition of fluorine atom to the copolymer chain, and PDTSBT-F could be a promising low band gap polymer for high efficiency solar cells.
Experimental section
Measurements
The 1H-NMR spectra of the polymers were recorded with a Bruker AV-400 MHz spectrometer at 120 °C in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 as the solvent. The molecular weight was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a PL-GPC220 instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a METTLER TOLEDO TGA/DSC1/1100 LF equipment under nitrogen and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was measured on a TA Q100 DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere and a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer UV-vis Lambda 750 spectrometer. The electrochemical properties of both polymer films were performed on a CHI600D electrochemical analyzer in anhydrous acetonitrile at a scan rate 100 mV s−1 under nitrogen. Tetrakis(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) was used as the electrolyte. A glassy carbon electrode, a saturated calomel electrode, and a Pt wire were used as the working, reference, counter electrodes, respectively. Polymer films were spin-coated onto the glassy carbon working electrode from a chlorobenzene solution (8 mg ml−1).
XRD was performed on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (Cu, λ = 1.54056 Å) with a 40 kV tube voltage and 30 mA tube current. TEM was performed on a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. AFM was obtained on a Bruker Nanoscope IIIA using tapping mode. The J–V characteristics of the polymer photovoltaic devices were measured in a glove box with a Keithley-2400 source meter and a solar simulator (SAN-EI, XES-70S1) at AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The IPCE of the devices was measured using chopped monochromatic light from an iodine tungsten lamp in an atmospheric environment. A standard silicon solar cell was used as a reference to determine the light intensity at each wavelength. The J–V characteristics of the polymer hole-only devices were determined in a glove box in the dark with a Keithley-2400 source meter. The thickness of the films was acquired on a KLA-Tencor D-100 surface profiler.
Fabrication of polymer photovoltaic and hole-only devices
The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned in sequence with detergent, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol. After the ITO substrates were treated under UV ozone for 30 min, a ca. 30 nm PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. These substrates were then transferred into a glove box. The photoactive layer of PDTSBT-based device was fabricated as described in our previous work.20 For the PDTSBT-F devices, PDTSBT-F/PC71BM blend was dissolved in CB (6 mg ml−1 for PDTSBT-F) with different blend ratio. The solution containing different amounts of DIO was heated to 100 °C prior to spin-coating the photovoltaic active layer with a thickness of ca. 90 nm. For the hole-only devices, a ca. 50 nm polymer layer was spin-coated on the substrates from both polymer solutions, where the PDTSBT-F solution was heated to 100 °C prior to spin-coating. Afterwards, the PDTSBT-F/PC71BM films were thermally annealed under different conditions, and the PDTSBT/PC71BM films were thermally annealed at 140 °C for 5 min, as reported in the literature.16,20 Finally, a 20 nm Ca layer topped with a 100 nm Al was evaporated on the active layer for the photovoltaic devices fabrication. The hole-only devices were completed by the evaporation of a 90 nm Au electrode. The photoactive area of each device was 9 mm2.
Materials
All reagents, unless stated otherwise, were received from commercial sources and used without further purification. PC71BM (99%) was purchased from American Dye Source Inc. Chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99%) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and TCI, respectively. Toluene was dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled prior to use. The monomers of 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole and 4,7-dibromo-5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole were synthesized similarly to the procedures described in the literature.16,33
Synthesis of PDTSBT-F
Compound M3 (1.2 mmol, 0.89 g) and M6 (1.15 mmol, 0.36 g) were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (10 ml) and DMF (2 ml). After being flushed with argon for 10 min, Pd2(dba)3 (0.018 mmol) and P(o-tolyl)3 (0.144 mmol) were added to the solution. The mixture was again flushed with argon for another 15 min. The resultant solution was then heated at 120 °C for 48 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was precipitated by adding dropwise into 100 ml methanol and filtered. The precipitate was collected and subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform. The residual fraction was collected and dried in vacuum to afford a blue solid as product (220 mg, 32%). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, C2D2Cl4, 120 °C, ppm): 8.58–8.13 (d, br, 2H), 7.82 (br, 1H), 2.71 (br, 4H), 1.96–0.70 (d, br, 30H). Molecular weight: Mn = 16000 g mol−1, PDI = 1.78.
Synthesis of PDTSBT
PDTSBT was prepared following the procedure for PDTSBT-F using M3 and benzothiadiazole as monomers. The chloroform fraction was then precipitated in 100 ml methanol, and the polymer was then collected and dried in high vacuum to afford a blue solid as product (440 mg, 67%). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, C2D2Cl4, 120 °C, ppm): 8.24 (br, 2H), 7.93 (br, 2H), 2.83 (br, 4H), 1.98–0.67 (d, br, 30H). Molecular weight: Mn = 22000 g mol−1, PDI = 2.38.
