    , Accepted 26th April 2016First published on 27th April 2016AbstractIn this communication, we investigate the direct and still conjugated intramolecular +NB− interactions in novel high band gap borylated carbazole containing polymers, namely, poly(3,6-(N-di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl-carbazole)-alt-4,8-di(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene) (P(3,6-BCBDT)) and poly(3,6-(N-di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl-carbazole)-alt-3,3′′′-didodecyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene) (P(3,6-BCQT)), which result in ambipolarity, high electron affinity, and deep HOMO levels. The quasi-donor–acceptor nature of the two polymers was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption, electro-chemical property studies, and computer modelling. Band gaps of 2.07 eV for P(3,6-BCBDT) and 2.23 eV for P(3,6-BCQT) were obtained. P(3,6-BCQT) afforded a power conversion efficiency of 1.44%, with a Jsc of 4.82 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V and a FF of 37%, and P(3,6-BCBDT) performed better with an efficiency of 3.82%, with a Jsc of 8.31 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.0 V based on its low lying HOMO level, and a FF of 45%.
Introduction
The rational design and engineering of structural conjugation in backbones of conjugated polymers for improved light harvesting, alignment of frontier molecular orbitals, and charge transportations have been a major focus in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) in the last decade. For a solar cell device, it has been commonly accepted that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) are the two key factors that have profound impacts on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPVs. For the former, the photocurrent strongly relies on the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). As the band gap narrows down for a better fitting to the solar radiation, a loss of Voc is inevitable due to an increase of the HOMO levels of the donor materials, since it is empirically recognized as a correlation between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. One of the great efforts made for keeping the low lying HOMO energy level of p-type materials for a lower band gap has been to introduce a boron atom into the polymers, thereby maintaining a high electron affinity of boron.1–3 Possessing a vacant pz orbital and being able to significantly delocalize when conjugated with an adjacent organic π-system, such a three-coordinated boron moiety becomes electron deficient and a useful π-electron acceptor, despite being able to function as a σ-donor4 within the B–C bonding due to its lower electronegativity compared to carbon. Based on the groundwork of recently developed organoboron chemistry,5–7 boron containing conjugated polymers have received great attention.5,6,8,9 Lorbach et al.10 presented a diborananthracene polymer that gave rise to new luminescent materials. Chujo et al.11,12 introduced their findings on the photo- and/or electrical-luminescence obtained from a series of studies on polymers involving cyclodiborazane, boron-quinolate, boron-diketonates, and boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY), and attributed the atypical properties and excellent performance to the conjugation between the single electron in the pz-orbital of the carbon atom of either vinylene or phenylene and the vacant pz orbital of the boron atom (C–B interactions). Bazan et al.13–15 pioneered reversible intermolecular N–B coordination between N-containing conjugated polymers and tri-fluorinated phenylborane functioning as strong Lewis acids for fine color tuning in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). This design idea was further elevated to intramolecular N–B interactions by the discovery by Liu et al.,2 replacing the C–C unit with a B ← N unit (a coordination between lone pair electrons from N and a vacant orbital from B) and obtained a cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene (CPDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) donor–acceptor polymer with high electron affinity and a deep HOMO level. To date, very few reports on boron containing materials have been tested for their PV properties. All devices were prepared using BODIPY based small molecules having a PCE ranging from 1.3% to 4.7% and one BODIPY-based polymer with a PCE of 2.0%.16–21 The best performance was obtained for devices prepared by Thompson et al.22 containing a benzannulated BODIPY which reached a PCE of 4.5%. A very recent report by Liu et al. pronounced a new double B ← N bridge bypyridyl, as the electron deficient building block for a non-fullerene acceptor, yielding a PCE of 3.38% when paired with PTB7 as the donor material.23 However, in all of the above-introduced boron materials, the conjugative nature of the B atom must have been destroyed by conversion of sp2 into sp3 hybridization with its tetrahedral configuration in order to form the new σ-bond between the sp2 lone pair of electrons of N and the vacant sp3 hybridized orbital of B due to the demanding criteria for both the symmetry and the overlapping of atomic orbitals for forming MOs. Upon formation of such a four-coordinated borate species there will no longer be effective participation in conjugation with adjacent π-systems.
In this communication we present the design, synthesis and characterization of two borylated carbazole based copolymers poly(3,6-(N-di(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-boryl-carbazole)-alt-4,8-di(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene) (P(3,6-BCBDT)) and poly(3,6-(N-di-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-boryl-carbazole)-alt-3,3′′′-didodecyl-,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene) (P(3,6-BCQT)), as shown in Scheme 2. The design was based on Taniguchi et al.24 in order to enhance the direct N–B interaction and at the same time keeping the conjugation (as illustrated in Scheme 1). Their photo-physical and electrochemical properties were studied, and the PV performance of their spin coated solar cells was also investigated.

3,6-Dibromo-N-(di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl-carbazole) (3,6-BC)
In a dry two-necked flask, magnesium turnings (1.38 g, 56.7 mmol, 2.84 eq.) were added and activated by a small piece of iodine crystal, followed by the addition of dry THF (50.0 mL) and 2-bromomesitylene (8.50 mL, 11.1 g, 55.5 mmol, 2.78 eq.) under an argon atmosphere. The reaction was initiated and maintained with gentle reflux until all magnesium was consumed. Boron trifluoride diethyletherate (2.80 mL, 3.22 g, 22.7 mmol, 1.14 eq.) was added dropwise and the solution was refluxed for three hours and then cooled to room temperature, yielding a white precipitate. 6.51 g 3,6-dibromocarbazole (20.0 mmol, 1.00 eq.) was dissolved in 50.0 mL of dry THF under an argon atmosphere and cooled to −78 °C. n-BuLi in hexane (8.50 mL, 2.50 M, 21.3 mmol, 1.06 eq.) was added dropwise to the carbazole and kept stirred for 2.5 hours. Afterwards the above-prepared dimesitylboron fluoride solution (cooled to −78 °C) was added under vigorous stirring. The resulting mixture was extracted with pentane and dried in vacuo. The obtained solid was recrystallized from ethyl acetate, yielding 3,6-dibromo-N-di-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-boryl-carbazole (5.58 g (9.73 mmol, 48.7%)) as snow white, glittering crystals.

A mixture of 3,6-dibromo-N-di(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)boryl-carbazole (50 mg, 87 μmol, 1.00 eq.), 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (79 mg, 87 μmol 1.00 eq.), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd2dba3, 2 mg, 1.75 μmol, 2 mol%), and tri-o-tolylphosphine (P(o-Tol)3, 14 mg, 13 μmol, 14 mol%) was degassed twice via vacuum and then consecutively in a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was then dissolved in toluene (15 mL), degassed and heated to 120 °C for 48 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The product was then precipitated in methanol. The obtained polymer was further purified via two consecutive precipitations from chloroform, affording the final product P(3,6-BCBDT) as a yellow solid (70 mg). GPC: Mw = 10130 Da, PDI = 1.54. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, δ, ppm): 7.90–8.05 (s, 2H), 7.62–7.75 (m, 4H), 7.34 (d, 2H), 7.17 (s, 2H), 7.07 (s, 2H), 7.00 (s, 2H), 6.77–6.83 (m, 2H), 2.96–3.02 (d, 4H), 2.15–2.50 (m, 16H), 1.60–1.81 (m, 2H), 1.30–1.50 (m, 18H), 0.96–1.05 (m, 12H).

QT (300.1 mg, 0.450 mmol, 1.00 eq.), 3,6-dibromo-N-(dimesitylboryl)carbazole (57.7 mg, 0.450 mmol, 1.00 eq.), and Ni(dppp)Cl2 (2.50 mg, 4.61 μmol, 1 mol%) were added into dry THF (20.0 mL) under an argon atmosphere. TMPMgCl·LiCl (1.10 mL, 0.9 M, 0.990 mmol, 2.20 eq.) was added dropwise and the solution was refluxed for 48 hours. The solution was poured into 100 mL methanol and the precipitated red solid was filtered and washed with methanol. The solid was dried in vacuo at 50 °C. The obtained product P(3,6-BCQT) was a deep red solid with a yield of 59% (169 mg). GPC: Mw = 11416 Da, PDI = 2.04. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, δ, ppm): 7.82–7.91 (m, 2H), 7.39–7.51 (m, 2H), 7.10–7.22 (m, 4H), 7.06 (s, 2H), 6.91–6.99 (m, 4H), 6.71 (s, 2H), 2.11–2.85 (m, 18H), 1.28–1.68 (m, 44H), 0.91 (t, 6H).
Measurements

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a Varian Cary 50 UV/vis spectrophotometer. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was conducted at 35 °C with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent against polystyrene standards. The column used was a Phenomenex Phenogel™ 104 Å, 4.6 mm, range 5–500 k Da; the molecular weight (Mw) and the polydispersity index (PDI) were determined using Dionex Chromeleon™ software 6.8. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer STA 6000 under nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analyses were carried out on a ReflexTMIII from Bruker, Germany. All samples were measured in reflector mode. Samples were applied to a target plate coated with nitrocellulose, also called a FENC layer. Surface roughness and morphology of the thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an Agilent 5400. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed by using a CHI 660D system with a three-electrode cell in a 0.10 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1; the electrodes consisted of a glassy carbon electrode (working electrode) on which chloroform solutions of polymers were drop-cast, a platinum wire (counter electrode), and a saturated calomel reference electrode. The film thickness was measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profiler. The potential was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+, 4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were estimated by the equations: HOMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetox) and LUMO = HOMO + Eoptbg.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on 15 mm × 15 mm pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a layered structure of a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM blend (∼80–100 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned subsequently in acetone, toluene, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath. The substrates were then oxygen plasma treated for 20 min, spin coated with PEDOT:PSS at 5000 rpm, and dried at 120 °C for 20 min. The polymer:PC71BM blend was spin coated with a layer thickness of 80–100 nm from dichlorobenzene solution with a total dry content of 30 mg mL−1. Subsequently, the metal electrodes were thermally evaporated on top of the active layer, firstly the Ca layer (10 nm) and then the Al electrode (∼100 nm). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2420 source meter under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by means of a source meter, silicon photodiode, and a computer-controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements for electro- and hole-mobility were performed on a hole only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO/Ag) and an electron only device (ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to the monomer 3,6-BC and polymers are outlined in Scheme 2. 3,6-BC was obtained from the reaction between n-BuLi lithiated 3,6-dibromocarbazole in THF and the freshly prepared di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl fluoride (dimesitylboryl fluoride, synthesized from the fresh Grignard reagent of 2-bromomesitylene reacting with boron trifluoride) at −78 °C. As can be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies combined with simultaneous thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) on the obtained snow-white crystals confirms a distinct melting point of 244.4 °C without any mass loss while another peak temperature of 380.4 °C presents its complete chemical decomposition corresponding to an almost 100% mass loss of the monomer 3,6-BC, indicating the high purity and high thermal stability of this small molecule monomer prior to the polymerization. From NMR studies, as found in the Experimental section, the molecular structure of the monomer 3,6-BC has been proven by (a) the co-existence of mesitylene protons (with their chemical shifts at 6.84 (s, 4H), 2.35 (s, 6H), and 2.91 (s, 12H)) and the rest of the protons from the carbazole moiety (with their right chemicals shifts and integrals); (b) the disappearance of secondary amine protons (H–N(Ar)2) in the starting material of 3,6-dibromo-9H-carbazole measured in CDCl3, which would otherwise be seen at around 8.10 ppm (s, 1H); and (c) the found resonance of boron (58.80 ppm) in the compound when probing 11B. Even though the carbon atom directly attached to boron was hidden in the 13C spectrum due to the rapid quadrupolar relaxation, we can strongly confirm the successful synthesis of this target monomer.
 Scheme 2  Chemical structure and synthesis of P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT). 
The two polymers of P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) were synthesized by the standard Pd catalyzed Stille coupling polymerization of the monomer 3,6-dibromo-N-(di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl-carbazole) (3,6-BC) with 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and the Kumada cross-coupling of the Grignard reagent of QT on 5,5′′′-positions made by TMPMgCl·LiCl with 3,6-BC in the presence of a nickel catalyst, respectively. The correct backbone structure of both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) was also evidenced by the chemical shifts of all the protons in their 1H-NMR data (see the Experimental section), while the broadening of the aliphatic hydrogens suggested a macromolecular long-chain-like structure due to the conformational isomerization of the methylene hydrogen atoms caused by the energy-barrier limited free rotation of C–C bonds in the aliphatic segments.
Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorbance spectra of P(3,6-BCQT) and P(3,6-BCBDT) in both the solution and the film can be seen in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the absorbance of both polymers in going from the solution to the film exhibits bathochromic phenomena ranging from 9 nm for P(3,6-BCBDT) to 28 nm for P(3,6-BCQT), because the local planar configurations of the polymer backbones facilitate their interactions (and also charge transport) in the solid state. Meanwhile such relatively short shifts suggest the strong sterically hindered effects on the π–π stacking in solid states caused by the bulky mesitylene groups around the B atom. Weak absorption bands observed in the range from 300 to 400 nm for P(3,6-BCQT) and P(3,6-BCBDT) in both solutions and films are assigned to n–π* and π–π* transitions. Such transitions (pronounced by the low absorptions in this region) could be limited due to the delocalization of the lone-pair electrons at the N atom to the vacant π orbital of the B atom. The peak absorption of the lower energy band at 437 nm for P(3,6-BCQT) in our work correlates well with that at 447 nm for PCzT4 (poly(carbazole-quaterthiophene)) as reported by Lim et al.27 Furthermore, all lower energy absorptions at 437 nm and 465 nm for P(3,6-BCQT) in solutions and films and at 472 nm and 480 nm for P(3,6-BCBDT) in solutions and films pronounce effective intrachain charge transfers (ICT) from the N atom to the B atom, resulting in an ambipolar +NB− moiety through such a direct/still conjugated N–B interaction. Thus the electrical properties of P(3,6-BCQT) and P(3,6-BCBDT) turn into quasi donor–acceptor materials instead of being major donor molecules like polythiophene/polycarbazole/polyBDTs. Their optical band gaps were calculated respectively to be 2.2 eV and 2.07 eV from their absorption onset at 557 nm and 600 nm in films, which are lower than any of the three types of homopolymers of thiophene (2.3 eV),28 3,6-carbazole (3.23 eV),29 and BDT (2.13 eV),30 suggesting at least a pseudo donor–acceptor nature from less electron efficient properties from borylated carbazole caused by direct N–B electron interactions.

Molecular simulations
Molecular simulations (density-functional theory (DFT) calculations) on the model compound of 3,6-BCBDT and 3,6-BCQT were conducted at the B3LYP level using the basis set 6-31G(d,p) with Gaussian 09.D01 and visualized using Gaussian Viewer 5 (GW5). The geometrically optimized structures are illustrated in Fig. 2. The planarity of the backbone in both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) is evidenced, as the large dihedral angles between the carbazole unit and BDT and QT, being 25.00° and 25.05°, respectively, account for the twisting and a certain coil-like polymer conformation, and furthermore lead to enhanced torsional relaxation along the backbone.31 This could be part of the reason for the relatively small red-shift (9 nm) of absorption maxima between the solutions and films for P(3,6-BDBDT), as discussed above. Furthermore, the dihedral angles of 55° between the mesityl units and the carbazole moiety prevent the overall planarity of the polymer. This is expected to have a negative influence on the band gap properties, as the spatial steric effect will affect the π–π stacking. It is important to mention that all side-chain substituents were replaced with a methyl group in order to simplify the calculations; nevertheless, the side chains typically play an important role in modeling torsion angles of conjugated polymers.32 Herein we used the same simplified side group for both BDT and QT moieties and therefore the results regarding the torsion angles between BC and BDT/QT should be reasonable. When observing the orbital distribution (Fig. 2), it becomes evident that the HOMOs of both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) are mainly distributed in the donor units, BDT and QT while the LUMOs were expanded into the B atom in the carbazole moiety (also proved by reports of Jäkle et al. and Yuan et al.), i.e., forming the quinoid form +NB−.33,34 This furthermore supports our discussion on their optical absorptions regarding the charge transfer from N–B, indicating the lower electron rich properties of the BC unit, which also improves the electron affinity of the orbitals, and leads to a possible deeper HOMO level (as will be presented further): the experimental −5.56 eV and −5.52 eV for the HOMO of P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) are all deeper than −5.22 eV for poly(carbazole-QT)27 and −5.44 eV for polyBDT.30 It is the direct conjugated N–B interaction promoting the low lying HOMO orbital level that determines a high Voc of 1.00 V (presented below) for solar cells made from P(3,6-BCBDT) and a moderately high value of 0.80 V for P(3,6-BCQT).34

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical characteristics of P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) were studied using cyclic voltammetry. The HOMO and LUMO levels, together with the electrochemical band gaps, (Eeccg) are listed in Table 2. The experimental results have the same tendency as that modulated above (Table 1), and the oxidation onset of P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) affords a HOMO level of −5.56 eV and −5.52 eV, respectively. Such deep HOMO levels imply that the introduction of direct N–B interactions endows both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) with high electron affinity, and also show high oxidation stability which is desirable for application in devices. Combining the HOMO levels with the Eg determined from the absorbance curves affords a LUMO level of −3.33 eV for P(3,6-BCQT) and a LUMO level of −3.45 eV for P(3,6-BCBDT).

The high band gap, 2.23 eV for P(3,6-BCBDT) and 2.07 eV for P(3,6-BCQT), and such deep HOMOs indicate the ambipolar characteristic of 3,6-BC, which prevents the narrowing of the bandgap normally associated with presence of both a donor and an acceptor moiety in the backbone. Comparing the HOMO level of the polymer containing the BDT moiety with polymers containing a similar moiety, this ambipolar characteristics are again evident, as the HOMO level is expected to be around −4.95 to −5.30 (reported by Hou et al.35) when compared to a large array of polymers, but combined with the 3,6-BC unit this is lowered by 0.25 eV. The HOMO energy levels calculated for P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) are −5.08 eV and −4.83 eV, which are 0.48 eV and 0.69 eV higher than the values from electrochemical measurements. We speculate that this mismatch might derive from both the lack of consideration for the π–π stacking of the polymers and, also to some extent, an underestimation of the acceptor ability of the N–B bond.
Photovoltaic performance
BHJ OPVs were fabricated using P(3,6-BCBDT) or P(3,6-BCQT) as the donor in different ratios with PC71BM as the acceptor. The device structure applied was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. PC71BM was chosen as the electron acceptor instead of PC61BM due to its better light absorption in the visible range.36J–V curves for both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) can be seen in Fig. 3 (left and middle) and the PV performance data are summarized in Table 3. For P(3,6-BCBDT) the best performance obtained was for the weight ratio of 1:3 (polymer to PC71BM), with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 8.31 mA cm−2, and a FF of 45%, affording a total power conversion efficiency of 3.82%. The optimized weight ratio of P(3,6-BCQT) was also 1:3 (P(3,6-BCQT) to PC71BM), having a Voc of 0.79 V combined with a Jsc of 4.82 mA cm−2 and a FF of 37%, affording a total efficiency of 1.44%. For P(3,6-BCBDT), the Jsc values of the devices increased from 1.05 mA cm−2 at the 1:1 blend ratio to 5.42 mA cm−2 at the 1:2 ratio, and to 8.31 mA cm−2 at the 1:3 ratio. Such enhancement of the photocurrent upon increasing the PC71BM concentration in the blend for both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(BCQT) was related to the increase of the total interfacial area at the heterojunction37 for more sufficient exciton dissociations and possibly charge transport properties as well. Therefore, it is notable that both materials showed a significantly lower efficiency when the ratios between the donor polymer (P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT)) and the acceptor (PC71BM) were 1:1 and 1:2; this could be an indication of a low exciton mobility as the efficiency increases significantly with the concentration of acceptor. In particular, such a remarkably high Voc of 1.00 V obtained for P(3,6-BCBDT):PC71BM (1:3, w/w) should benefit from the deep HOMO energy level of P(3,6-BCBDT) that was caused by direct N–B interaction in the 3,6-BC moieties as discussed above. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest Voc values reported to date for high-performance polymer:PCBM-based BHJ-type PSCs.30,38–42 The remarkably high efficiency of both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) at 3.82% and 1.44%, respectively, is especially interesting when considering the unfavorable absorbance spectrum (Fig. 1) and band gaps of 2.23 eV and 2.07 eV, respectively. Therefore EQE measurements were conducted (Fig. 3, right), showing a maximum performance of 53% for P(3,6-BCBDT) and 27% for P(3,6-BCQT). The EQE has an onset of approximately 675 nm, which falls in line with the absorbance spectrum (Fig. 1). This shows that despite high bandgap the morphology and charge separation of the polymers are of utmost importance. The performance of P(3,6-BCQT) is also superior to the unborylated (N-alkylated) carbazole-QT polymer reported by Lim et al.,27 having a PCE of 0.40%, which is only around one-third of the value reported in this work. A remarkable point is that Lim et al. also found an optimal D:A ratio of 1:3, which is consistent with the findings of this work.

The right figure shows external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the best performing devices for both P(3,6-BCQT) (black) and P(3,6-BCBDT) (red) with the ratio of 1:3 (D:A).

Free charge carrier mobility
To assess the quality of the synthesized material and to explain both the difference and the overall good performance of the polymers, the free charge carrier mobility was evaluated. The electron mobility was evaluated using an electron only device and the hole mobility was investigated using a hole only device as described in the Experimental section. The charge carrier mobility is determined by using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method and the mobility is described using the expression in the equation below:  where JSCLC is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μcc is the free charge carrier mobility (either hole or electron mobility), V is the internal potential in the device, and L is the thickness of the active layer (measured using a profilometer). The mobilities of P(3,6-BCQT) and P(3,6-BCBDT) are listed in Table 2. For P(3,6-BCBDT), the mobility of 5.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 falls in the same magnitude (1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) as that of a BDT quinoxaline based copolymer, which is also a relatively bulky polymer with pendant phenyl rings, as Duan et al. reported.43 For the mobilities of P(3,6-BCQT), an imbalance between the mobilities of electrons and holes by two orders of magnitude (see Table 2) was found. Its lower PV performance when compared to P(3,6-BCBDT) could be well attributed to this large difference, while the latter exhibits comparable charge carrier mobilities between the hole (5.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the electrons (1.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).
Film morphology
In Fig. 4 the atomic force microscopy (AFM) (both phase and topography) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the optimized polymer/PC71BM blends are shown. Generally all films are relatively smooth for P(3,6-BCBDT) with a Rsq of 0.75 nm, while P(3,6-BCQT) showed a Rsq of 0.45 nm. The AFM pictures (Fig. 4a and d, respectively) show some irregularities, with very local extremities at around 8 nm for P(3,6-BCBDT) and 10 nm for P(3,6-BCQT). The phase AFM picture for P(3,6-BCQT) shows a very uniform film, which is also in agreement with the reported roughness. The TEM images of both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) show that there are no large phase separated domains created, which again supports the notion that the films are rather smooth.

Conclusion
Based on the successful synthesis of the monomer 3,6-dibromo-N-(di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl-carbazole) (3,6-BC) proven by 1H-, 11B-, and 13C-NMR studies, novel boron containing polymers, poly(3,6-(N-di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl-carbazole)-alt-4,8-di(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene) (P(3,6-BCBDT)) and poly(3,6-(N-di(2,4,6-trimethyl)phenylboryl-carbazole)-alt-3,3′′′-didodecyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene) (P(3,6-BCQT)) have been designed and successfully polymerized via Stille and Kumada cross-coupling reactions, which were confirmed by 1H-NMR measurements. From the study on their photophysical- and electro-chemical properties and computer modelling, a quasi-donor–acceptor nature of P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) was confirmed, and band gaps of 2.07 eV for P36BCBDT and 2.23 eV for P36BCQT were obtained. The intrachain charge transfer between N–B on both P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) has been investigated, and such certified direct/conjugated N–B interaction results in ambipolarity, high electron affinity, and a deep HOMO level. The devices from P(3,6-BCBDT) and P(3,6-BCQT) have been fabricated with the structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al with an active area of 0.1 cm2. Both polymers were tested as donor materials using PC71BM as an acceptor, and the optimal weight ratio of 1:3 polymer to acceptor was concluded. P(3,6-BCQT) afforded an efficiency of 1.44%, with a Jsc of 4.82 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V and a FF of 37%. The (P(3,6-BCBDT)) polymer performed better with an efficiency of 3.82%, with a Jsc of 8.31 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.0 V based on its low lying HOMO level, and a FF of 45%. We consider these preliminary results as evidence of a wide range of potential applications of such direct N–B interactions as boron containing good and robust donor materials for future OSCs.
