    , Accepted 10th January 2011First published on 9th February 2011AbstractComplete composition-tuned CdSxSe1−x alloy layers (avg. thickness = 50 nm) were deposited on pre-grown TiO2 nanowires by the thermal vapor transport of CdS/CdSe powders, producing core–shell nanocable arrays. CdSxSe1−x alloy nanowires were also synthesized with full composition tuning by the same method for comparison. The CdSSe nanowires consisted of Se-rich and S-rich pseudo binary phases, while the nanocable shell consisted of more complex multinary phases including CdSe and CdS. Remarkably, unique CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishell structures were produced in the Se-rich composition range. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells fabricated using the as-grown nanocable arrays show higher solar photocurrents and hydrogen generation rates for the Se-rich shelled TiO2 nanocable arrays. This suggests that the CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishell structures increase greatly the PEC performance by producing novel band alignment for efficient electron–hole separation following enhanced visible-range photon absorption.
Introduction
Hetero-composition 1-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures (e.g., nanorods, nanowires, or nanotubes), including radially composition-modulated core–shell and composition-tuned alloy nanowires, have attracted much attention, because of their unique, controlled and multi-functional optoelectronic properties.1–8 In the core–shell nanocable architecture, carrier separation takes place more efficiently, because the shell serves as a return channel for the electrons running through the core or allows the holes to flow in the opposite direction.1–6 Alloy nanowires offer the advantage of a tunable band gap by adjusting the relative composition.7,8 The controlled synthesis of 1-D hetero-nanostructures would therefore extend their application range, allowing more advanced and multi-functional nanoscale photoelectronic devices to be achieved in the future.

        CdSxSe1−x alloy semiconductors have significant importance in photonics and electronics, since their band-gap (Eg) can be tuned over a wide range of 1.75 ≤ Eg ≤ 2.45 eV in the visible wavelength range. CdSxSe1−x nanowires could therefore be used in an extensive range of potential applications, such as powerful visible emission lasers and photovoltaic cells.9–12 There have been a number of reports on the synthesis and optical properties of CdSxSe1−x nanowires.13–19 Recently, the development of architectures that allow their use as a photovoltaic system has been quite a challenging subject. In particular, TiO2 or ZnO 1-Dnanostructure arrays sheathed with a semiconductor nanocrystal shell are emerging as novel photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical cells (PECs).20–27 These core–shell nanocable structures can increase the likelihood that all of the photogenerated electrons of the shell have a direct connection to the collection electrode. As a combination of core–shell and alloy nanostructures, Pan and coworkers showed the composition and light emission tuning of a CdSSe shell on a Si NW array.16c Chong et al. reported on the photocurrent properties of CdS0.7Se0.3 alloy quantum dot–TiO2 nanobelt composites.28 Our group recently reported the synthesis of composition-tuned CdSSe-shelled ZnO nanocable arrays and their PEC performance.29
In the present study, we synthesized both CdSxSe1−x nanowires (NWs) and TiO2–CdSxSe1−x core–shell nanocable (NC) arrays with a controlled composition over the whole range (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), using a relatively simple and low-cost approach, viz. the chemical vapor transport method. Their crystal and electronic structures were examined as a function of the composition by applying a comprehensive set of techniques, in order to find out whether the alloy formation is effective over all compositions and how it influences the efficiency of the PECs, which were designed to achieve a photocurrent under the illumination of AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2). The current work is a follow-up of our previous comparative study on TiO2–CdS and ZnO–CdSSe NC arrays, focusing on the formation of ZnCdSSe alloy between the ZnO NW core and CdSSe shell.29 Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the formation of the CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishell structures, which greatly enhances the photoconversion efficiency. The successful achievement of PECs using the NC arrays with shell layers having unique multicomponent phases would provide an important insight into viable nanometre-scale solar cell technology.
Experimental
For the synthesis of the CdSSe NWs, Si substrates with 3 nm thick Au layers deposited on them were placed a few cm apart from CdSe (99.99%, Aldrich), CdS (99.995%, Aldrich) or CdS/CdSe mixed powder inside the reactor. As the source powder was evaporated at 850 °C for 30 min under argon flow, the CdSSe NWs were grown at about 700 °C. The composition was controlled by changing the ratio or temperature of the CdS and CdSe powders. To synthesize the TiO2 NW array, Ti foils were used as both the Ti source and substrates. A flow of oxygen (>99.999%) at a rate of 20–50 sccm was introduced only for the reaction time of 60 min, after which the Ti foils were covered homogeneously with a white-colored NW array. To deposit the CdSSe shell layers, the TiO2 NWs (grown on the Ti foils) were placed a few cm apart from the CdSSe source. As the CdS/CdSe powder was evaporated at 800–850 °C for 10–60 min under argon flow, the CdSSe layers were deposited on the NW array at about 650–700 °C. The thickness of the CdSSe shell was controlled by adjusting the growth temperature or time, and the composition was controlled by adjusting the evaporation temperature of the CdSe and CdS powders.
The products were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4700), field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol JEM 2100F and FEI TECNAI G2 200 kV), high-voltage TEM (HVEM, Jeol JEM ARM 1300S, 1.25 MV), and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDX). High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using the 8C2 and 3C2 beam lines of the Pohang Light Source (PLS) with monochromatic radiation (λ = 1.54595 Å). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using the 8A1 beam line of the PLS and a laboratory-based spectrometer (ESCALAB 250, VG Scientifics) using a photon energy of 1486.6 eV (Al Kα). A UV-Visible-NIR absorption spectrometer (Varian, Cary 1000) was used to measure the band gap. The low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a He–Cd laser (λ = 325 nm) as the excitation source.
The time-resolved PL spectrum was measured using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system, which consisted of a mode-locked cavity-dumped Ti-sapphire laser (Mira 900, Coherent) pumped by a continuous wave Nd-YVO4 laser (Coherent Verdi) with a pulse width of about 150 fs and a repetition rate of 76 MHz. The excitation wavelength was 400 nm, produced by second harmonic generation (SHG). The intensity of the laser beam focused on the sample was ∼50 µJ cm−2. The fluorescence was spectrally resolved using a monochromator (SP-2150i, Acton) and its time-resolved signal was measured by a TCSPC module (PicoHarp, PicoQuant) with an MCP-PMT (R3809U-59, Hamamatsu). The total instrument response function (IRF) was less than 100 ps, which gives a temporal resolution of less than 10 ps. The deconvolution of the decay curve, which separates the IRF and actual decay signal, was performed using fitting software (FluoFit, PicoQuant) to deduce the time constant associated with each exponential decay. The PL decays were usually analyzed by the multi-exponential model: exp(−t/τi).
The PEC properties of the TiO2–CdSSe NC array electrodes were measured as follows. The whole set up consists of a liquid junction PEC. The photocurrent versus voltage of the cell was measured with a NC array electrode having a surface area of 0.25 cm2. A constant light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel) passed through an AM 1.5 G filter was used as the light source. The incident light intensity was calibrated by a standard crystalline silicon solar cell. An electrochemical analyzer (IVIUM, Compactstat) was used to measure the PEC response, with a conventional three-electrode system comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt foil counter electrode, and the sample electrode. Argon was bubbled through to remove the dissolved oxygen during the measurement. The incident photon-to-current measurement efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured on an IPCE measurement system (PV measurement Inc.). The data were collected in the incident wavelength range of 300–800 nm at a potential of 0 V versusAg/AgCl. The H2 evolution from the Pt electrodes of the PEC (at a potential of −0.5 V) was monitored as a function of time by gas chromatography (GC) and its quantity was calibrated using a standard H2/He gas mixture. A 1 M Na2S electrolyte solution was used for both the PEC and IPCE measurements.
Results and discussion

SEM, TEM, and EDX
The growth mechanism follows the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism, which makes use of Au catalytic nanoparticles (NPs). We successfully synthesized six composition-tuned CdSxSe1−x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) NW samples, by controlling the evaporation temperature of the CdS and CdSe powders. We refer to them as samples “C1–C6”, respectively. Fig. 1a shows a SEM micrograph of the high-density CdS0.2Se0.8 NWs, mixed with the nanobelt (NB) form, grown on the Si substrates. The TEM image explicitly reveals their straight and smooth surface and their average diameter of 80–300 nm (Fig. 1b). The Au NPs were frequently attached to the tips of the NWs, providing evidence for the VLS mechanism. The lattice-resolved TEM image and corresponding Fast Fourier-Transform (FFT) ED pattern (zone axis = [20]) of a selected nanowire reveal that it is composed of single-crystalline wurtzite (wz) CdS0.2Se0.8 (Fig. 1c and inset). The FFT ED pattern was generated from the inversion of the TEM image using Digital Micrograph GMS1.4 software (Gatan Inc.). It shows a d spacing between neighboring (002) planes of ca. 3.5 Å, which is consistent with the value calculated by Vegard's rule using the lattice parameters of bulk CdSe (JCPDC card no. 77-2307; a = 4.299 Å, c = 7.010 Å) and CdS (JCPDS card no. 41-1049; a = 4.14092 Å, c = 6.7198 Å). The ED pattern (zone axis = [20]) confirms the [0001] growth direction. The NBs usually have a growth direction of [010]. As the S mole fraction (x) is increased, their single-crystalline natures are maintained with the same morphology.

EDX line-scan and elemental mapping, and STEM image of the selected (d) CdS0.2Se0.8, (e) CdS0.6Se0.4, and (f) CdS0.8Se0.2 NBs, revealing the homogeneous distribution of Cd, S, and Se elements over the whole NB. 
The EDX line scanning and elemental mapping for the selected CdS0.2Se0.8 (C2), CdS0.6Se0.4 (C4), and CdS0.8Se0.2 (C5) NBs are shown in Fig. 1d–f. Their corresponding high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) images are also shown. Cd, S, and Se elements were distributed homogeneously over the whole NBs. The EDX data of an individual NW or NB for each of the samples are shown in the ESI†, Fig. S1. The mole fraction of S element, x = [S]/([S] + [Se]), in each sample was confirmed by the XRD pattern, as described below.
We synthesized TiO2–CdSxSe1−x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) core–shell NC array samples and refer to them as samples “TC1–TC6”, respectively. Fig. 2a shows a SEM image of the TiO2–CdS0.2Se0.8 (TC2) NC array (length = ∼10 µm) grown on the Ti substrates. A magnified scaled image reveals their rough surface morphology (inset). The TEM image reveals its nanocable morphology, in which the rough-surface outer layers are coated along the entire length of the TiO2 NWs (Fig. 2b and c). The average diameter of the TiO2 NW core is 60 nm, and the outer diameter is in the wide range of 120–200 nm and the thickness of the outer layers is 30–70 nm with an average value of about 50 nm. The lattice-resolved image and FFT ED patterns (zone axis = [111] for TiO2 and [20] for CdSSe) of the interface region reveal the zigzagged surface of the TiO2 NW with the highly crystalline CdSSe shell that consists of a number of single-crystalline domains (Fig. 2d and insets). They consist of highly crystalline rutile (tetragonal) TiO2 nanocrystals grown along the [110] direction. The distance between the TiO2 (110) planes is about 3.2 Å, which is consistent with that of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 86-0147; a = 4.594 Å, c = 2.958 Å). The (002) fringes of the shell adjacent to the TiO2 NW surface are separated by a distance of about 3.4 Å, which is rather closer to that of the bulk CdS. The lattice-resolved image and FFT ED patterns (zone axis = [20]) of the shell edge region reveal that the (002) fringes are separated by a distance of about 3.5 Å, which is closer to that of CdSe (Fig. 2e). This provides evidence for the CdS and CdSe phases at the inner and outer region of the shell, respectively, as discussed in the followings. In order to compare their photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies when used as the photoelectrodes of PECs, the shell thickness was adjusted to 50 ± 20 nm.

Lattice-resolved TEM images and FFT ED patterns (zone axis = [111] for TiO2 and [20] for CdSSe) revealing (d) the interface region of the TiO2 core and CdS0.2Se0.8 shell and (e) the outer layer region of the shell. EDX line-scan over the cross-section and elemental mapping (with STEM image) of the (f) TiO2–CdS0.2Se0.8 (TC2), (g) TiO2–CdS0.6Se0.4 (TC4), and (h) TiO2–CdS0.8Se0.2 (TC5) NCs, revealing the presence of Ti and O elements in the core part, and Cd, S, and Se elements in the shell part. 
The EDX line-scanning profile and elemental mapping identify the TiO2 core and the CdS0.2Se0.8 shell (Fig. 2f). The STEM image is also shown. Fig. 2g shows the EDX line-scanning profile (along the cross-section) and STEM image for the selected TiO2–CdS0.6Se0.4 (TC4). These two sets of EDX data commonly show that the Se and S elements are dominantly present in the outer and inner regions of the shell, respectively. Fig. 2h corresponds to the line-scanning profile and STEM image of TiO2–CdS0.8Se0.2 (TC5). At this higher S content, the S and Se elements are homogeneously distributed over the cross-section of the shell. The composition of each sample is determined as the average value from the EDX spectrum of 3–5 NCs (ESI†, Fig. S1). We observed that the distribution feature of S and Se elements depends strongly on their composition. For the Se-rich shell (0 < x ≤ 0.6), the S and Se elements are distributed predominantly in the inner and outer regions, respectively. When the S composition is increased to x ≥ 0.8, the homogeneity of the composition along the entire shell is achieved.

XRD


Fig. 3a shows the high-resolution XRD patterns of the CdSxSe1−x NW/NBs (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1; C1–C6). All of the samples are highly pure without any impurity phases. The peaks of the CdSe and CdS NWs match exactly to those of the bulk wzCdSe and CdS, respectively. As x increases, the diffraction angle shifts continuously from that of CdSe to that of CdS. From the (100) or (002) peak, we calculated the lattice constant and composition of each sample using Vegard's law. Fig. 3b displays the (100) peak in a magnified scale. The peak shape of the alloy (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) is noticeably asymmetric and the peak width is much larger than those of the CdSe and CdS NWs. As x increases to 0.6, the peak becomes significantly more asymmetric and broader.

The data points (open circles) of the (100) peaks are resolved into two peaks (dotted lines) using a Voigt function, corresponding to the CdSe-like (red color) and CdS-like (blue color) composition phases. The black line represents the sum of the resolved bands. XRD patterns of (c) the TiO2–CdSxSe1−x NCs (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1; TC1–TC6) and (d) magnified-scaled CdSSe (100) peaks. The rutile TiO2 peaks are indexed by the red color. The data points (open circles) of the (100) peaks are resolved into the Se-rich (red color) and S-rich (blue color) composition components. 
The asymmetric peak was able to be resolved into two bands corresponding to the Se-rich (red color) and S-rich composition (blue color) phases (hereafter referred to as “CdSe-like” and “CdS-like”, respectively) by means of a Voigt function. The observed band can be considered as the product of a Lorentzian natural line-shape function and a Gaussian instrument function. The fraction of the CdS-like component ([CdS]/([CdS] + [CdSe])) increases with increasing x, showing that the fraction of the CdS-like component is about the same as the x value that was measured by EDX. The separation of the binary composition is most significant at x = 0.6. From the position of the resolved bands, we calculated the S mole fractions (x) of the CdSe- and CdS-like components to be 0.52 and 0.64, respectively, resulting in an average x value of 0.6.

Fig. 3c and d show the full-range XRD patterns of samples TC1–TC6 and their magnified CdSSe (100) peaks, respectively. All of the NC samples exhibit much broader peak widths relative to those of the NWs. TC1 and TC6 show exact CdSe and CdS peaks, respectively. TC2 (x = 0.2) shows an asymmetric and broad Se-rich alloy peak (x = 0.06 from the peak position) and a small CdS peak (x = 1). The alloy peak was resolved into three components: x = 0.04, 0.18, and 0.35. The fractions of the x = 0.04, 0.18, 0.35, and 1 components are 41, 21, 28, and 10%, respectively, providing an average x value of 0.2. The x = 0.04 component is virtually approximated as CdSe phase. For x = 0.4 (TC3), the broad alloy peak (x = 0.06) emerges with the CdS peak whose relative ratio is increased. The asymmetric alloy peak was resolved into x = 0.04, 0.18, and 0.38 components. The asymmetric CdS peak was also resolved into x = 0.85 and 1 components. The respective fractions of these five components (x = 0.04, 0.18, 0.30, 0.85, and 1) are 24, 19, 23, 5, and 29%, providing an average x value of 0.4. As x increases to 0.6 (TC4), the broad and symmetric alloy (x = 0.39) and asymmetric CdS peaks appear. The CdS peak was resolved into x = 0.86 and 1. The fractions of the x = 0.39, 0.86, and 1 components are 61, 14, and 25%, respectively, giving an average value of x = 0.6. In the case where x = 0.8 (TC5), only the CdSSe alloy peak emerges. The two components x = 0.63 and 0.83 were resolved with fractions of 14 and 86%, respectively, resulting in an average value of x = 0.8.
The present synchrotron-source XRD pattern clearly demonstrates the existence of binary or multinary phases. This inference is supported by the large surface area and high crystalline domains of the nanocrystals. It is well known that the CdS–CdSe components are thermodynamically miscible over the whole range of compositions. However, since the growth of nanostructures at high temperatures usually occurs under kinetically controlled conditions, it can produce binary or multinary phases. According to the VLS mechanism (in the case of the NWs), the Au liquid droplets are saturated with the reactants supplied from the carrier gas. The precipitation at the solid/liquid interface leads to anisotropic NW growth. If the solubility of the Se and S elements in the Au NPs were different, the precipitation of Se and S into the lattice would occur at different rates, resulting in the separation of the Se- and S-rich domains. As the competitive growth rates of the two domains become comparable at equal mole fractions (x = 0.5), the separation of these binary phases is maximized. The incorporation of heteroatoms can randomly expand or compress the lattice constant, resulting in a wider composition range. Therefore, the peak broadening is also expected to be maximized at x = 0.5.
The radial growth of the CdSSe nanocrystals on the TiO2 NW surface produces more complex phases compared to the VLS growth of the NWs. The number of alloy components depends exclusively on the composition of the shell. At a higher Se content (x = 0.2 and 0.4), the CdS, CdSe, and 2–3 different composition CdSSe alloy phases form. Their EDX data and HRTEM images suggest that the CdS and CdSe phases are the inner and outer layers, respectively, with the CdSSe alloy phases as the intermediate layers. This unique CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multilayer shell (i.e. multishell) structure is produced over the Se-rich composition range. As the Se content decreases, the shell comes to consist of a lower number of alloy phases. In order to explain these results, let us assume that the growth rate of the alloy domains depends on the mobility of the elements. If the Se element has a much lower mobility than the S element, due to its heavier mass, the rich Se would create slowly a separated CdSe phase in the outer region. Meanwhile, the higher mobility of S element would consequently produce the CdS phase as an inner layer due to a higher growth rate than that of the CdSe phase. The Se-rich CdSSe alloy would grow slowly, sheath the S-rich alloy layers and have a wider composition range. As the S element becomes rich, there is no separation of the CdSe phase, resulting in the production of only CdSSe alloy layers. This tentative model needs certainly further verification in future. Nevertheless, the present results demonstrate for the first time that composition tuning using the thermal vapor transport method allows the number of alloy phases to be controlled and enables unique multishell structures to be grown.

UV-visible absorption and PL spectra

Fig. 4a displays the UV-visible absorption spectra of the CdSxSe1−x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1; C1–C6) NW samples. The onset of the absorption band occurs at 1.66 eV (747 nm) and 2.41 eV (514 nm) for the CdSe and CdS NWs, which is close to the band gap of the bulk at room temperature, viz. Eg (CdSe) = 1.75 and Eg (CdS) = 2.45 eV, respectively. The onset position of the alloy NWs was found to be 1.77. 1.89, 2.00, and 2.19 eV, respectively, for x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. Fig. 4b shows the corresponding PL emission spectra, recorded at 8 K, by 325 nm He–Cd laser excitation. The CdSe and CdS NWs exhibit band-edge emission peaks at 1.73 and 2.53 eV, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the band gaps of the bulk. For x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, the PL emission peak appears at 1.91, 2.00, 2.17, and 2.32 eV, respectively.

(c) UV-visible absorption spectra and (d) PL spectra (measured at 8 K) of TiO2–CdSxSe1−x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, and 1; TC1–TC6). The excitation source of the PL emission is a He–Cd laser (λ = 325 nm). 
The PL band-edge position shows a good match with the Eg values predicted using Vegard's rule, as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI†. This indicates that there is no optical bowing effect. The optical bowing effect (non-linearity of the band gap versusx) was reported in a number of works on CdSxSe1−x NWs (synthesized using electrodeposition and chemical vapor deposition), nanocrystals (synthesized using the solvothermal method), and bulk crystals.14,16e,30–32 The bowing constant (non-linear fitting constant) appears to be strongly dependent on the synthesis method. The present result is consistent with those of previous works on NWs and thin films synthesized using laser deposition methods.15,33 It was suggested that the bowing effect originates from structural anomalies and compositional fluctuations, in which the two bond lengths in the alloy maintain two chemically distinct values (so-called pseudo-binary phases). Although the XRD results reveal the existence of two phases, their compositional difference seems to be too small to bring about the optical bowing effect.

Fig. 4c shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the TC1–TC6 and x = 0.95 samples. TC1 shows the onset of the absorption band at 1.66 eV, which is same as that of the CdSe NWs. The same onset was observed for TC2 and TC3, due to the CdSe phase in the outer region of the shell. The absorption onsets of TC4 and TC5 appear at 1.73 and 1.78 eV, respectively, which are both red shifted compared with those of the NWs having the same composition. This red shift is ascribed to the Se-rich CdSSe alloy in the outer region. TC6 shows the onset at 2.24 eV, being red shifted compared with that of the CdS NWs. This red shift can be rationalized in terms of the band bending effect and/or crystalline defects between the single crystal domains.29 A sample with x = 0.95 was prepared to show the intermediate value of the band gap between x = 1 and x = 0.8, and was found to show a significant red shift induced by the Se-rich alloy phase in the outer region.

Fig. 4d shows their PL emission spectra measured at 8 K. In the case of TC1 (TiO2–CdSe), the band-edge emission peak appears at 1.60 eV, showing a significant red shift and broadening relative to that of the CdSe NWs. The TC6 (TiO2–CdS) and x = 0.95 samples show red-shifted band-edge emission peaks at 2.48 and 2.37 eV, respectively. Their spectra exhibit a strong broad emission band centered at 2.0–2.1 eV, which may originate from the defect sites formed at the interface of the core–shell and the single crystal domains of the shell. Samples TC2–TC5 exhibit a complex feature without any distinctive band edge emission, which is ascribed to their multicomponent phases that enhance the non-radiative quenching process through many interfacial defect sites.

Fig. 5a shows the room-temperature PL decay curves of the CdS0.4Se0.6 (C3) and CdS0.8Se0.2 (C5) NWs and TiO2–CdS0.4Se0.6 (TC3) and TiO2–CdS0.8Se0.2 (TC5) samples measured at their PL peak wavelength using 3.1 eV (400 nm) frequency-doubled Ti-sapphire laser pulses as the excitation source. The TC3 and TC5 samples exhibit faster and comparable decay rates compared to the NWs with the same compositions (C3 and C5), respectively. The experimental curves were fitted with two exponential decay response functions. The average decay time 〈τ〉 was calculated using the equation, 〈τ〉 = (α1τ12 + α2τ22)/(α1τ1 + α2τ2), where αi is the amplitude and τi is the decay time. Fig. 5b displays the 〈τ〉 values of all of the samples as a function of x. We obtained more data points using the samples with the other compositions; x = 0.75 and 0.85 for the NWs and x = 0.95 for the NCs. The 〈τ〉 values are 0.4 and 0.8 ns, respectively, for the CdSe and CdS NWs, thus increasing as x increases. The PL emissions of the TC1 and TC2 samples are too weak to measure at room temperature, indicating the existence of fast non-radiative decay channels. The 〈τ〉 value of TC6 (TiO2–CdS) is similar to that of the CdS NWs. The 〈τ〉 value of TC3 (x = 0.4) is 0.25 ns, which is smaller than that of the NWs with the same composition (C2; 0.38 ns). In contrast, TC5 (x = 0.8) shows 〈τ〉 = 0.45 ns, which is nearly the same as that of C5 (0.46 ns). Liu et al. reported the power dependence of the decay time for CdS0.6Se0.4 NWs, with a value of ∼0.4 ns being observed at 28–38 µJ cm−2, which is nearly the same as that of our NWs.16d The shorter decay time of the Se-rich TiO2–CdSSe NCs than that of the corresponding CdSSe NWs can be explained by a model in which the multicomponent phase structures reduce the decay time of the excited states by increasing the non-radiative quenching pathways.

Photoelectrochemical cell

Fig. 6a shows the photocurrent density J (mA cm−2) versus applied potential V (versusAg/AgCl) curves of the PECs fabricated using the TiO2–CdSSe NCs (TC1–TC6) as the photoanodes in 1 M Na2S electrolyte under Xe lamp illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). The dark current is very low (10−7 A cm−2) for all of the samples. The onset potentials (at J = 0) or open-circuit voltages (VOC) are in the range of 1.2–1.4 V and their photocurrent densities at V = 0 (short-circuit current, JSC) are in the range of 3.5–6.8 mA cm−2. As x increases, JSC shows an increase-to-decrease behavior. The J–V curve of TC1–TC4 samples (x ≥ 0.4) loses well-defined VOC value. This may result from the fact that the scavenging of the photogenerated holes by the same electrolyte is not optimized for the CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishells. Table 1 lists the JSC value of the PECs fabricated using the TC1–TC6 and x = 0.95 samples. The Se-rich shell NC samples (TC2–TC4) exhibit the higher photocurrent, with the highest value at x = 0.2.

 Fig. 6  (a) Photocurrent density (mA cm−2) versus potential (V versusAg/AgCl) for TiO2–CdSxSe1−x (TC1–TC6) measured under visible light illumination (100 mW cm−2) in 1 M Na2S electrolyte. (b) IPCE spectra of TC1–TC6 (in 1 M Na2S electrolyte) collected in the incident wavelength range of 300–800 nm at a potential of 0 V versusAg/AgCl. (c) Time-dependent H2 evolution (mmol cm−2) in the PEC at a potential of −0.5 V, using the NC samples (TC1–TC6) as the photoanodes. 
We performed incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements to study their photoresponse as a function of the wavelength of the incident light (Fig. 6b). The IPCE at different wavelengths is determined from the short circuit photocurrents (JSC) monitored at different excitation wavelengths (λ) to compare the photoresponse of the samples using the equation, IPCE (%) = [1240 × JSC (mA cm−2)]/[λ (nm) × Iin (W cm−2)] × 100. The IPCE of TC1 was pronounced at wavelengths of up to 700 nm and then dropped to a minimal level at wavelengths below the CdSe band gap energy (750 nm). TC2 exhibits a significantly enhanced IPCE over the same wavelength range as that of TC1. A maximum IPCE of 26% is achieved at 700 nm. TC3 and TC4 also show a considerable IPCE at wavelengths of up to 700 nm. When x was increased to 0.8, the IPCE value dropped from a shorter wavelength of 600 nm. TC6 showed a high photoactivity at wavelengths of up to about 550 nm, with a maximum IPCE value of 25%.

Fig. 6c shows a quantitative description of the evolution of H2 as a function of time for the PEC (bias voltage = −0.5 V) with a Pt cathode and NC photoanode in 1 M Na2S electrolyte under Xe light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G). During 3 h of exposure, 0.82–1.8 mmol cm−2 of H2 were generated for TC1–TC6, corresponding to rates of 270–600 µmol cm−2 h. Table 1 lists the H2 generation rate of each sample. The highest amount of H2 was obtained from TC2, which is well correlated with its having the highest photocurrent.
The PEC, IPCE, and H2 production data show that the Se-rich alloy shells (x ≤ 0.6) are more efficient in generating the photocurrent than the CdSe, CdS, and S-rich alloy (CdS0.8Se0.2 and CdS0.95Se0.05) shells, probably due to their unique CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishell structures. The CdSe phase in the outer region increases the photon absorption at wavelengths of up to 700 nm. In addition, the CdS–CdSSe layers bring on a synergy effect in increasing the photon absorption and photocurrents. Recently, a number of research groups investigated the co-sensitization of CdS and CdSe nanocrystals (or quantum dots) on ZnO NWs, TiO2 nanotubes, and TiO2 nanocrystal film photoanodes.25,34–38 The sequential chemical bath deposition of first the CdS and then the CdSe nanocrystals on TiO2 was found to be more efficient than the opposite way.36,37 This co-sensitization induced a higher photocurrent and IPCE, as compared to those of the single nanocrystal (CdS or CdSe) sensitized structures, which was suggested to be a result of the band alignment of the CdS and CdSe nanocrystals in the electrolytes. When TiO2, CdS, and CdSe are connected together, the insertion of CdS between TiO2 and CdSe provides a large driving force for the injection of photoexcited electrons to TiO2 by elevating the conduction band edge of CdSe and creating electric fields at the TiO2/CdS/CdSe interfaces.
This model can explain the present result wherein the CdS inner layers induce a higher photocurrent. The CdSe outer layers enhance the visible light absorption and the photoelectrons will be transferred from the higher conduction band to the lower energy band of CdS inner layers via the CdSSe intermediate layers, following the proposed band edge alignment. The CdSSe intermediate layers would facilitate the continuous band alignment between the CdS and CdSe layers, causing a higher photocurrent and IPCE, by decreasing the recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs. Another possibility is that if the defect bands of the CdS were positioned at 0.2–0.5 eV (at least) lower than the conduction band, as suggested by the UV-visible absorption and PL measurements, they could participate in the production of the continuous band alignment with the multicomponent alloy phases. The present CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishell architecture demonstrated for the first time in this study is an ideal model that allows for the enhanced absorption of the incident photons, as well as for the decrease in the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs, resulting in higher PEC performance. As a concluding remark, the thermal vapor transport method has the advantage of allowing for the single-step production of high-crystalline multishell structures.
Conclusion

        CdSxSe1−x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) NWs/NBs were synthesized with complete composition tuning by the thermal vapor transport of CdS/CdSe powders. They all consisted of single-crystalline wz phase CdSSe nanocrystals grown along a uniform direction. High-resolution XRD analysis revealed the existence of pseudo binary Se- and S-rich phases. TiO2–CdSxSe1−x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) core–shell NC arrays were synthesized by the same thermal vapor transport method using the pre-grown TiO2-nanowire arrays on Ti foils. When CdSxSe1−x shell layers with an average thickness of 50 nm were grown on the TiO2 NWs, more complex multicomponent phases were produced compared to that of the NWs. In the Se-rich shell, the CdS and CdSe layers exist separately in the inner and outer regions, respectively, with CdSSe intermediate layers, producing unique CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishell structures. As the S content increases, the separated CdS and CdSe phases disappear, leading to the production of only the CdSSe alloy phase. All of these results were supported by the UV-visible absorption and low-temperature and time-resolved PL spectrum analyses.
We fabricated PECs using these NC arrays as the photoanode and measured their photocurrents and H2 generation under AM 1.5 G conditions. The Se-rich composition shell results in a PEC with a higher photocurrent and H2 generation rate. This indicates that the novel band alignment of the CdS–CdSSe–CdSe multishell structures increases the PEC performance, by producing efficient electron–hole separation following enhanced visible-range photon absorption.

 	Fig. 6  (a) Photocurrent density (mA cm−2) versus potential (V versusAg/AgCl) for TiO2–CdSxSe1−x (TC1–TC6) measured under visible light illumination (100 mW cm−2) in 1 M Na2S electrolyte. (b) IPCE spectra of TC1–TC6 (in 1 M Na2S electrolyte) collected in the incident wavelength range of 300–800 nm at a potential of 0 V versusAg/AgCl. (c) Time-dependent H2 evolution (mmol cm−2) in the PEC at a potential of −0.5 V, using the NC samples (TC1–TC6) as the photoanodes.
