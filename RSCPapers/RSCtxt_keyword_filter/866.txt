    , Accepted 24th March 2014First published on 25th March 2014AbstractThe effects of different local crystalline structures on two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 sheets are studied to provide new insights into how the local characteristics affect the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) and how to tailor the local characteristics towards high-performance devices. UV–ozone post-treatment of 2D MoS2 sheets led to incorporation of oxygen atoms into the lattice of the sheets. The incorporated oxygen in 2D MoS2 sheets significantly improved the performance of OSCs, where 2D MoS2 sheets were used as hole transport layers.
Graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are currently the subject of intense research because of their unique electronic structures.1–5 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is one of the prototypical TMD materials. Single layer MoS2 consists of two planes of hexagonally arranged sulfur (S) atoms linked to a hexagonal plane of molybdenum (Mo) atoms via covalent bonds and in its pristine bulk form the individual layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces.6 Crystals of MoS2 can be easily cleaved along the layer plane due to weak van der Waals forces between the layers, which converts bulk MoS2 from an indirect band-gap semiconductor with an energy gap of about 1.2 eV to a direct band-gap of monolayer MoS2 with an energy gap of about 1.9 eV.7,8 MoS2 displays many intriguing physical and chemical properties1 with a wide range of potential applications including in dry lubrication,9 hydrogen evolution,10–12 photovoltaics,13,14 light-emitting devices,15 and photodetectors.16
Among the methods for synthesis of 2D MoS2 sheets,1 lithium intercalation, a scalable and solution based process, is a simple method to produce a single layer of MoS2 sheets, where Li-intercalated MoS2 (LixMoS2) can be exfoliated into monolayers via forced hydration, yielding a stable colloidal suspension.8,17,18 At present, all the methods cannot produce large-scale MoS2 sheets with perfect crystalline structures.19,20 In fact, there are several reports on the observation of different intrinsic structural defects and various phases mixed with a semiconducting prismatic 2H-phase and a metallic octahedral 1T-phase in monolayer MoS2 sheets.19–22 The lithium intercalation process is more prone to induce modification of the crystalline structure of MoS2 sheets.8,19 Although some studies, mostly through theoretical calculation,20–23 have shown that these features have influence on electrical and optical properties of the monolayers, there are few studies on the effects of crystalline structures of MoS2 on the performance of a device.11,24 Understanding the influence of local lattice structures of monolayer TMDs at a device level would be very helpful to design high-performance devices towards practical applications. Herein, we report on how the post-treatments of the chemically exfoliated MoS2 (ce-MoS2) affect the local crystalline structures of MoS2 sheets and in turn the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) where the 2D MoS2 sheets are used as hole extraction layers (HELs). With the optimization of local structures of MoS2 sheets by oxygen incorporation, we could achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.64% for the OSCs, which is 53% higher than that of the OSCs with as-deposited ce-MoS2 and comparable to the PCE (7.6%) of cells with standard poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the HEL.
The formation of the ce-MoS2 nanosheets and the solution-based thin film facilitates their use in devices such as OSCs.25–27 We synthesized the 2D MoS2 sheets by lithium intercalation and exfoliation followed by exhaustive dialysis.28 The successful synthesis of ce-MoS2 monolayers is evidenced through substantial characterization. A majority of the ce-MoS2 sheets have a thickness of about 1 nm with lateral sizes of 200–300 nm, suggesting that monolayers are generated by the chemical method (Fig. 1a–c).8,25 Compared to the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the bulk MoS2 (Fig. S1b†), only the peak of the (002) plane remained while the other peaks disappeared for the ce-MoS2 sheets, which is mostly due to the fact that the MoS2 sheets lay on the substrate with preferred orientation, and the (002) plane is the thermodynamically stable plane.17 The broadening of the (002) peak in the XRD pattern suggests the crystals with nanoscale sizes (Fig. 1c) and the presence of disorder in the crystals as visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1d and e). The Raman spectrum of the as-deposited ce-MoS2 film (Fig. S1c†) shows two prominent peaks at 382 cm−1 and 402 cm−1 which correspond to the in-plane E12g and out-of-plane A1g modes of MoS2, respectively.8 Compared to the peak positions at 384 cm−1 and 403 cm−1 and widths (typically 2–6 cm−1) of a mechanically exfoliated monolayer, the slight peak shifts may be caused by the weak interlayer coupling due to the rotational stacking disorder of ce-MoS2,8,24 and the broadening of E12g and A1g peaks (∼9 cm−1) may be due to the thickness inhomogeneity of our film and the presence of defects.8,24 Furthermore, the TEM images clearly depict the presence of various damages in the ce-MoS2 sheets, including various edges, tears, pinholes, and amorphous-like features (Fig. 1b, d and e). An interplanar spacing of 0.27 nm measured from the top-view high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is consistent with the d spacing of (100) planes of hexagonal MoS2.11 The presence of many dislocations and distortions can also be revealed, as indicated by white circles in Fig. 1d. Discontinuous crystal fringes along the sheet edges are observed from a few-layer sample in the side-view HRTEM image (Fig. 1e).

The MoS2 powder has sizes from a few to tens of micrometers and thickness of few micrometers. (b) Transmission electron microscopy image (TEM), obviously showing the presence of internal edges (tears and pinholes) of ce-MoS2 induced by the Li intercalation reaction.

These observations suggest the existence of local structural defects of the ce-MoS2 sheets. 

Fig. 2a shows the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of ce-MoS2 sheets. Despite the honeycomb crystalline order of MoS2, we clearly observe disordered features, voids with various sizes, and irregular edges, suggesting abundant uncontrollable defects in the ce-MoS2 sheets.19,28 The high resolution HAADF STEM image in Fig. 2b reveals honeycomb lattice intensity variations of 2H-MoS2 in various regions of the samples with high density of defects such as S vacancies as well as dislocations and different edge terminates.19,21 Such defective crystalline structures are believed to be a common feature of ce-MoS2 sheets synthesized by chemical exfoliation methods due to the violent nature of the processes.19

Our OSCs30–32 were fabricated by using the ce-MoS2 sheets as an HEL14,29,33 to investigate the influence of such local variations of crystalline structures on device performance. In state-of-the-art OSCs, a layer of PEDOT:PSS, a conducting conjugated polymer, is commonly used as a standard interfacial material, i.e. HEL, due to its suitable work function (∼5.1 eV) for efficient hole extraction (energy level alignment) and exceptional solution processability (low-cost manufacture).34,35 However, the high acidity and hygroscopic features of PEDOT:PSS often make it implicated with the poor long-term stability of devices.36 Here, we used ce-MoS2 sheets (as-deposited, oxygen-incorporated, and thermal treated) to replace the PEDOT:PSS layer. The device was comprised of an active blend of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C 71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor as shown in Fig. 4a and b.37 The ce-MoS2 HEL was prepared by multiple-steps of spin-coating from a 2 mg mL−1 solution (Fig. S2†). The thickness of the MoS2 layers on the substrates was estimated to be about 2–3 nm (Fig. S2†) after spin-coating 3 times.
We first examined the effect of phase compositions on device performance of the OSCs with the assumption of no change in other factors such as defects in the MoS2 layer. It has been documented both theoretically and experimentally8 that ce-MoS2 sheets consist of a mixture of two distinct phases (prismatic 2H and octahedral 1T) compared to the natural 2H phase in bulk MoS2. The intercalation-induced phase transformation (from 2H to 1T) can be reversed via mild annealing such that the semiconducting properties of pristine MoS2 can be restored.8 We found that the as-prepared ce-MoS2 is predominantly in the 1T phase, reaching 88.5% calculated from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement (Fig. S4 and S5†). After annealing the ce-MoS2 thin films at 150 °C and 300 °C for 10 min in a glovebox, the percentage of the 2H phase in the ce-MoS2 thin films increased to 89% and almost 100%, respectively. The PCE of the OSCs, in which the active layer was deposited on the as-deposited ce-MoS2 layer, is 4.99%. However, the PCE of the OSCs varied randomly while increasing the 2H phase by annealing ce-MoS2 at different temperatures, i.e., the PCE of the OSCs reduced from 5.77% to 4.77% while increasing the 2H phase from 89% to 100% (Fig. S6 and Table S1†). Although the change of the device performance is not in line with the percentage of 2H phase contained in the ce-MoS2 thin films, the results suggest that the phase composition has an effect on the hole extraction properties of ce-MoS2 in the OSCs.
As observed in the TEM images, there are many crystalline structural defects, such as S vacancies, in the ce-MoS2 sheets,10,19,24 thus we could expect that the filling of such S vacancies can remove the defect-induced levels in the band-gap20–23 of MoS2 and in turn reduce the trapping possibility of the free carriers separated from excitons and facilitate transport and collection of the carriers in OSCs.38 On the other hand, it is well known that interfacial engineering is a prominent way to enhance the performance of OSCs, controlling hole and electron extraction and collection.39–42 Hence, we developed a simple strategy to produce oxygen-incorporated ce-MoS2 (O–ce-MoS2) in order to tailor its structural and electrical properties. The O–ce-MoS2 layer was obtained by 3 min UV–ozone treatment on ce-MoS2 ultrathin films. We found from XPS measurements that oxygen (O) atoms penetrated into the ce-MoS2 crystal lattices after UV–ozone treatment, which might partially fill the S vacancies. The O incorporation could passivate the structural defects as schematized in Fig. 3a (also see Fig. S7†) and lead to a change of interfacial energy level alignment.

The O1s to Mo3d ratios are calculated to be 0.768 and 0.988 before and after ozone treatment, respectively. The relative change of the atomic concentrations of O1s and Mo3d, i.e. the increased O ratio after the treatment suggests the successful incorporation of O atoms. (c) XPS spectra showing O1s core level peaks of ce-MoS2 (left panel) and O–ce-MoS2 (right panel). The O1s peak was de-convoluted to two peaks at 532 eV and 530.6 eV, which are ascribed to adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen, respectively. (d) XPS spectra showing Mo3d, S2s, and S2p core level peaks of ce-MoS2 (upper panel) and O–ce-MoS2 (under panel). After Shirley background subtraction, the Mo3d and S2p peaks were de-convoluted to show the 2H and 1T contributions, represented by orange and violet plots, respectively. 
After O incorporation, the normalized peak intensity of O1s in the XPS spectra was increased (Fig. 3b). The O1s peak was de-convoluted to two peaks at 532 and 530.6 eV (Fig. 3c), which are ascribed to adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen, respectively.43 The increase in intensity of the 530.6 eV peak for O–ce-MoS2 suggests the successful incorporation of O atoms into the MoS2 crystal lattices. The Mo3d, S2s, and S2p core level peaks in Fig. 3d further suggest that the stoichiometric structure and phase composition of the MoS2 films mostly remained unchanged after the O incorporation. Notably, the peaks observed at about 236 eV, corresponding to Mo6+, were with a percentage of 7.4% in ce-MoS2 (Fig. 3d), partially due to the oxidation of Mo during synthesis. After the O incorporation, the Mo6+ content was increased to 12.8%. The additional 5.4% Mo6+ may arise from both the slight oxidation and more possibly the electrons delocalized from Mo to filled O in O–ce-MoS2. It should be noted that this short-time UV–ozone treatment (3 min) did not fully oxidize MoS2 into MoO3 as confirmed by Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra before and after the UV–ozone treatment (Fig. S8 and S9†). The retention of the E12g and A1g peaks and PL properties rule out the possibility of complete conversion from MoS2 to MoO3.
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs fabricated using the as-deposited ce-MoS2 and O–ce-MoS2 layers are shown in Fig. 4d, with relevant parameters summarized in Table 1. The device with ce-MoS2 as the HEL has a PCE of 4.99% with an open circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF) of 0.62 V, 14.29 mA cm−2, and 0.563, respectively. By comparison, the device where O–ce-MoS2 was used as the HEL had a significant enhancement in the PCE of 7.64% (53% enhancement) with a VOC, JSC, and FF of 0.73 V, 14.98 mA cm−2, and 0.699, respectively. This efficiency is comparable to that of the solar cells with standard PEDOT:PSS (7.60%) as the HEL. The enhancement in the device performance by using O–ce-MoS2 as a HEL layer could be attributed to the incorporation of oxygen atoms into the lattices, which led to the possible filling of the vacancies and the increase in the work function (WF) of O–ce-MoS2.

To examine the effect of local structural defects on the device performance, we studied the PL properties of the PTB7 active material used in our OSCs. The PTB7 film was deposited on top of the ce-MoS2 or O–ce-MoS2 ultrathin films. As shown in Fig. 4f, the PL intensity of PTB7 on the ce-MoS2 layer is much lower than that on the O–ce-MoS2 layer. The PL quenching is believed to be mostly due to the local structural defects of ce-MoS2 as observed in the TEM images (Fig. 1 and 2), which could act as a non-irradiation recombination center to quench the PL of PTB7. The S vacancies existing in ce-MoS2 could cause unsaturation of the electrons of the surrounding Mo atoms, and act as electron donors to make the MoS2 electron rich as experimentally observed previously.21 The presence of the S vacancies could introduce deep donor defect states in the band-gap.21 This result suggests that our UV–ozone treatment is an efficient approach to modify the structures of the ce-MoS2 sheets and thus the performance of our OSCs was improved. The oxygen atoms might be incorporated at the defective sites of the ce-MoS2 sheets, though further direct visualization of such oxygen atoms is needed. Efforts have been taken to justify the incorporation of oxygen atoms into the defects using STEM, however, we are not successful until now.
We studied the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of the ce-MoS2 and O–ce-MoS2 sheets to confirm the WF change after O incorporation into the lattices, which significantly influences device performance. As shown in Fig. 4h and i, the WF of MoS2 increased from about −4.50 eV to −4.93 eV after O incorporation. The mismatch between the WF of ce-MoS2 and the HOMO of PTB7 limited the build-up of VOC. VOC is normally governed by the energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials in the case of Ohmic contacts.34,35 Unlike the formation of an Ohmic contact between PEDOT:PSS and PTB7, ce-MoS2 formed a Schottky contact with the PTB7 layer. The poor electrical contact between ce-MoS2 and PTB7 could seriously deteriorate the device performance. In the case of O–ce-MoS2, the defect-induced states could be reduced due to the possible filling of S vacancies with O atoms, and in turn the Fermi level shifted down away from the minima of the conduction band minimum (normally MoS2 sheets exhibit n-type semiconductor behavior) because of the lower concentration of electron donors. The enhanced WF is beneficial for the Ohmic contact with the donor materials (Fig. 4i). As a consequence, a striking enhancement of the VOC was achieved and this led to improvement in the PCE of O–ce-MoS2 compared to ce-MoS2.
Furthermore, from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4e), we clearly see that the photocurrent of the device with the O–ce-MoS2 layer was enhanced significantly as compared to the OSC with ce-MoS2, which is consistent with the change in JSC. This current enhancement directly related to the reduction of structural defects in the O–ce-MoS2 layer which facilitated the carrier transport and the better match of energy levels between the O–ce-MoS2 and ITO electrodes which improved carrier injection at the interfaces and collection by the ITO anode. We calculated the series resistance (Rs) of these devices from the dark J–V curves. Compared to the device with ce-MoS2, the Rs value of the device with O–ce-MoS2 decreased from 4.03 to 1.88 Ω cm2 (Table 1). The reduction of Rs suggests a higher conductivity of the O–ce-MoS2 film and the FF was enhanced. To compare the charge collection between the devices with ce-MoS2 and O–ce-MoS2, the charge collection probability (PC)44 with respect to the internal voltage (Vint) under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 was calculated as shown in Fig. 4g. It shows that the PC of the device based on O–ce-MoS2 is higher than that based on ce-MoS2 in the full range from short-circuit to open-circuit conditions.43 The PC increased from 90.9% to 97.5% under the short-circuit conditions, indicating that an increase in charge collection originated from the oxygen incorporation.
In conclusion, our study of various local crystalline structures of ce-MoS2 sheets provides new insights into how these local characteristics affect the device performance and approaches on how to tailor the local characteristics towards high-performance devices. Despite the difficulty in synthesizing perfect crystals of 2D TMDs, we showed that UV–ozone post-treatment is an efficient method for improving the electronic properties of MoS2 sheets used in OSCs. The incorporation of oxygen atoms into the ce-MoS2 lattices could reduce defects and tune the electronic properties of ce-MoS2 in a manner of doping or alloy form. Our results demonstrate that the ce-MoS2 ultrathin film is an alternative HTL material to develop high-efficiency OSCs with compatibility for a flexible and solution-based process. The knowledge developed in our study could help to optimize the performance of 2D TMDs in general and to pave the way towards practical applications of these novel nanomaterials.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Local structure characteristics of ce-MoS2 sheets. (a) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of commercial MoS2 powder. The MoS2 powder has sizes from a few to tens of micrometers and thickness of few micrometers. (b) Transmission electron microscopy image (TEM), obviously showing the presence of internal edges (tears and pinholes) of ce-MoS2 induced by the Li intercalation reaction. (c) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of ce-MoS2 nanosheets deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate. (d) Top-view high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of a ce-MoS2 nanosheet. The white dash-circles highlight dislocations and distortions of the crystals. (e) Side-view HRTEM image of a few-layer ce-MoS2 nanosheet, revealing discontinuous crystal fringes along the sheet edges. These observations suggest the existence of local structural defects of the ce-MoS2 sheets.	 

 	Fig. 2  HAADF STEM images of ce-MoS2 sheets. (a) The image clearly shows irregular edges and pinholes with various sizes, indicating abundant uncontrollable defects in a typical ce-MoS2 sheet. (b) The high resolution image shows individual Mo and S atoms (represented by blue and yellow balls in the image, respectively), their honeycomb arrangement, and local crystalline defects. Such structural defects include S vacancies whose positions are shown with green dash-circles, dislocations, and different edge terminates.	 

 	Fig. 3  Chemical characterization of MoS2 sheets before and after oxygen incorporation. (a) Schematic of production of O–ce-MoS2 from ce-MoS2. (b) Whole XPS spectra of ce-MoS2 and O–ce-MoS2. The O1s to Mo3d ratios are calculated to be 0.768 and 0.988 before and after ozone treatment, respectively. The relative change of the atomic concentrations of O1s and Mo3d, i.e. the increased O ratio after the treatment suggests the successful incorporation of O atoms. (c) XPS spectra showing O1s core level peaks of ce-MoS2 (left panel) and O–ce-MoS2 (right panel). The O1s peak was de-convoluted to two peaks at 532 eV and 530.6 eV, which are ascribed to adsorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen, respectively. (d) XPS spectra showing Mo3d, S2s, and S2p core level peaks of ce-MoS2 (upper panel) and O–ce-MoS2 (under panel). After Shirley background subtraction, the Mo3d and S2p peaks were de-convoluted to show the 2H and 1T contributions, represented by orange and violet plots, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Organic solar cells with MoS2 sheets as the hole extraction layer. Chemical structures of (a) PTB7 and (b) PC71BM used in our solar cells. (c) Schematic of the device architecture. (d) J–V characteristics and (e) external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OSC devices with PEDOT:PSS, ce-MoS2, and O–ce-MoS2 as HELs, respectively, under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). (f) The steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the PTB7 film deposited on ce-MoS2 and O–ce-MoS2 thin films on a quartz substrate, respectively. The excitation light comes from the MoS2 side (quartz side) in order to easily observe PL quenching induced by the MoS2 defects. (g) Charge collection probability as a function of internal voltage for devices based on ce-MoS2 and O–ce-MoS2 HELs. (h) Ultraviolet photoemission spectra (UPS) of ce-MoS2, O–ce-MoS2, and PEDOT:PSS deposited on ITO substrates. (i) Energy diagram of the PTB7:PC71BM active layer sandwiched between the ITO anode and the Al cathode utilizing ce-MoS2 and O–ce-MoS2 as the hole extraction layer, respectively. Oxygen incorporation can increase the work function of ce-MoS2 from −4.50 eV to −4.93 eV.	 

PEDOT:PSS	Annealing	0.74	15.00	0.685	7.60	2.53
ce-MoS2	No annealing	0.62	14.29	0.563	4.99	4.03
O–ce-MoS2	No annealing	0.73	14.98	0.699	7.64	1.88
