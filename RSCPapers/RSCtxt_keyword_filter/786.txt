    , Accepted 31st July 2017First published on 31st July 2017AbstractHierarchical porous carbon (HPC) has attracted much attention in tackling global environmental and energy problems. For the state-of-the-art routes to synthesize HPC from organic compounds, the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and gaseous pollutants is inevitable during thermal carbonization. Herein, we report an environmentally benign and high-yield route to synthesize HPC from CO2via H2O-induced self-propagating reactions. By introducing an initiator of H2O, CO2 can react with lithium hydride (LiH) to produce HPC in 13 seconds at low temperatures. The as-synthesized HPC exhibits an interconnected micro–meso–macropore network structure with a high porosity of 83%. The formation mechanism of HPC is discussed on the basis of the conversion reactions from CO2 to C and the gas blowing effect in producing hierarchical porosity. The HPC evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries not only delivers a high reversible capacity of ∼1150 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, but also exhibits superior rate capability (∼825 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling properties (up to 2000 cycles). This research opens a new avenue both to synthesize HPC from CO2 on a large scale and to mitigate greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.
Introduction
An ever-increasing consumption of fossil fuels has led to the global shortage of fossil fuels and environmental deterioration. The pursuit of a low-carbon economy has stimulated considerable effort in the development of efficient conversion and storage of renewable energy, including solar, wind, water and geothermal energy.1–4 Lithium-ion batteries, which have come into powering hybrid electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles, are one of the most promising energy storage devices in terms of high energy density and good environmental compatibility. Currently, graphitic carbons are selected as the leading anode material for commercial lithium-ion batteries due to their low cost and good cycling stability. Unfortunately, the low lithium storage capacity (theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1) and limited rate capability result in graphitic carbons failing to satisfy the requirements of the onboard lithium-ion batteries with higher energy density and power density.5,6 For the large-scale applications of onboard lithium-ion batteries, therefore, it is of importance to design and synthesize novel carbon materials with increased lithium storage capacity and superior rate capability.
HPC has been demonstrated to be a high-capacity and superior-rate anode material for lithium-ion batteries.7–9 For example, 3D hierarchical porous graphenes prepared by Zuo et al.10 deliver a reversible lithium storage capacity of 932 and 400 mA h g−1 at the current density of 100 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively, much higher than that of the commercial graphite.5 The hierarchical porous structure and high specific surface area of hierarchical porous carbons are responsible for the improved electrochemical lithium storage properties. HPCs with a 1D to 3D network have been successfully synthesized from various carbonaceous sources by employing templates,11,12 chemical or physical activation,13,14 acidic etching,15,16etc. Generally, the template synthesis of HPC is time-consuming, energy-intensive and environmentally unfriendly because of the complicated synthesis procedure, limiting the industrial production. Recently, much attention has been paid to synthesizing HPC on a large scale via a template-free method.17–19
In order to achieve the environmentally benign synthesis of HPC, it is critical to select the green synthetic routes and pollution-free carbonaceous sources. Organic compounds, such as fossil-based products,20,21 polymers,22,23 biomass,24,25 and metal–organic frameworks,26,27 are the most important carbon precursors in the state-of-the-art synthesis of HPC. During the carbonization process, large amounts of CO2, the most common greenhouse gas, and gaseous pollutants are released from the organic compounds. Anthropogenic emissions of CO2 from organic compound combustion are regarded as the major contributors to the continuing global warming.28,29 It was estimated that about 13 billion tonnes of CO2 are produced from the consumption of fossil fuels each year.30 Reducing the anthropogenic emission of CO2 into the atmosphere is still a challenge.
CO2 has not been used as the carbonaceous source to produce HPCs because of its thermodynamically and kinetically stable nature. Herein, we develop a new strategy for the environmentally benign and efficient synthesis of HPC from CO2 through a self-propagating reaction between CO2 and LiH. This self-propagating reaction can be easily initialized at room temperature (RT) by introducing a small amount of H2O. The H2O-induced self-propagating synthesis of HPCs is an energy-saving and ultra-efficient method as CO2 can react with LiH to produce HPC in 13 seconds. Moreover, the as-synthesized HPC exhibits excellent electrochemical lithium storage properties with a high reversible capacity of ∼830 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 and ultra-long cycling life (over 2000 cycles). Our green and efficient strategy (Fig. S1†) will open up a new avenue in tackling the long-term challenges of the greenhouse effect, energy crisis and air pollution.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of HPC

Fig. 1 shows the key synthesis procedure of HPC from CO2. Firstly, LiH powder was dispersed at the bottom of a homemade reactor filled with gaseous CO2, followed by the introduction of a small amount of H2O into the reactor. Fig. 2a shows the time dependence of sample temperatures and gaseous pressures in the reactor. The temperature of the LiH–CO2 mixture was maintained at RT in the first stage, whereas it was raised from RT to 315 °C, which was the highest reaction temperature, in 13 seconds as a small amount of H2O was simultaneously mixed with LiH and CO2, indicating the exothermic nature of the above-mentioned synthesis reaction. The time dependence of gaseous pressures in the reactor is similar to that of the temperatures. These results imply that CO2 was gradually consumed in the above-mentioned exothermic process. The as-obtained solid residue was washed with hydrochloric acid, and then the post-washed solid residue (HPC) was collected for energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. S2†). Only C and O elements are identified. The weight ratio of C:O is calculated to be 95.3:4.7 for the HPC. The EDS result demonstrates that CO2 was successfully converted into carbon in the above-mentioned exothermic reaction process. The trace amount of O may have resulted from the oxygen absorbed by carbon.31,32

A broad diffraction peak centered at 25.6° and a weak diffraction peak centered at 42.7°, which are close to the (002) and (101) diffraction peaks of hexagonal graphite, respectively, were observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of HPC (Fig. S3†), indicating that the HPC may not crystallize well. The Raman spectrum was measured to study the degree of graphitization. Two peaks centered at 1350 and 1580 cm−1 are observed in Fig. 2b, corresponding to the D band and G band modes of the sp2 C–C bond, respectively.33 The intensity ratio of the D to G band (ID/IG) is 0.86, implying a low graphitization degree of HPC. This result is consistent with the XRD result. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to evaluate the morphology. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the as-synthesized carbon exhibits a HPC network morphology, in which the interconnected pores are randomly distributed across the carbon sheets. The hierarchical porous morphology can be observed in TEM and high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 3c–e) as well. The porosity of HPC was further assessed by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption and Hg penetration measurements. A hysteresis loop (0.45 < P/P0 < 0.98) is observed in the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 3f), which is a typical type IV curve of mesoporous adsorbents, suggesting that the interconnected mesoporous channels are present in HPC.34 The pore diameter distribution of HPC is determined by the density functional theory (Fig. 3f) and Hg penetration method (Fig. 3g). The HPC exhibits a micro–meso–macropore structure. The micropores and macropores are centered at 1.45 and 151 nm, respectively. A continuous pore diameter distribution is found in the mesopores. The Hg penetration analysis shows that the HPC possesses a high porosity of 83% and a high total pore volume of 9.51 cm3 g−1. The specific surface area is calculated to be 334 m2 g−1 using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller model. The crystalline characteristics of the HPC were further investigated by high-resolution TEM (Fig. 3e) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED, Fig. 3e), which are in good agreement with the results of XRD and Raman spectroscopy.

A static weighing method was used to estimate the yield of HPC. For a typical synthesis, a total of about 8.000 g of LiH was used to react with CO2. Finally, ca. 2.768 g of HPC was obtained after washing and drying. The yield of HPC relative to the weight of LiH is about 34.6%. Even more important, the synthesis reaction of HPC occurred at a low temperature and a low gaseous pressure and was completed within 13 seconds (Fig. 2a).
Formation mechanism of HPC
As shown in Fig. 4a, the characteristic XRD peaks of Li2O and Li2CO3 phases were clearly detected in the as-obtained solid residue derived from the reaction between LiH, CO2 and H2O. The XRD peaks of C are not observed in Fig. 4a because of its poor crystallinity. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern shows that the weight ratio of the Li2O phase and Li2CO3 phase is 3:2, corresponding to a ca. 3.7:1 molar ratio. These results indicate that the crystalline Li2O and poorly crystalline C are the major phases in the as-obtained solid residue. As a result, it can be concluded that the direct chemical reaction between LiH and CO2 may be responsible for the major products of Li2O and C. To confirm our above-mentioned deduction, the solid–gas mixture of LiH and CO2 was gradually heated in a sealed reactor. The time dependence of sample temperatures and gaseous pressures in the reactor is presented in Fig. 4b. The sample temperature was increased to 334 °C, which was the highest reaction temperature, in 20 seconds when the solid–gas mixture of LiH and CO2 was gradually heated to 212 °C. The mixture of LiH and CO2 exhibits similar changes in the time dependence of sample temperatures and gaseous pressures with the mixture of LiH, CO2 and a small amount of H2O as shown in Fig. 2a, suggesting that the small amount of H2O is not a required reactant for the conversion of CO2 to carbon.

(d) Temperature dependence of pressure differences of CO2 for the Li2O powder heated from RT to 310 °C. 
The solid product of LiH reacting with gaseous CO2 was collected for XRD analysis (Fig. 4c). A major phase of Li2O and a minor phase of Li2CO3 are observed in the XRD pattern. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern shows that the weight ratio of the Li2O phase and Li2CO3 phase is ca. 2.53:1, corresponding to a ca. 6.25:1 molar ratio. After hydrochloric acid washing, the solid residue obtained is carbon as determined by XRD and EDS analyses (Fig. S4 and S5†). The same products of C, Li2O and Li2CO3 were identified in the as-obtained solid products of the LiH–CO2 mixture with and without H2O. Moreover, H2 was detected in the gaseous reaction products of the above-mentioned two samples (Fig. S6†). The chemical reaction between LiH and CO2 can be proposed as follows: 4LiH + CO2 → C + 2Li2O + 2H2(1)
According to eqn (1), the theoretical yield of C is about 37.8%, which is very close to our experimental value of 34.6% relative to the weight of LiH.
The minor phase of Li2CO3 may be the product of the newly produced Li2O reacting with CO2 in the thermal process. The solid–gas mixture of Li2O and CO2 was heated from RT to 310 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1. The temperature dependence of pressure differences of CO2 is plotted in Fig. 4d. The pressure differences of CO2 remarkably decreased as the temperature was increased to above 210 °C, implying that CO2 was consumed at the temperature of above 210 °C. For the sample heated at 310 °C, a new phase of Li2CO3 was clearly detected in the XRD pattern (Fig. S7†). These results prove our deduction that the newly produced Li2O further reacted with CO2 to produce the minor phase of Li2CO3 as shown in Fig. 4c. Li2O + CO2 → Li2CO3(2)
Combined with the Rietveld refinement results (Fig. 4a and c), it can be known that the content of Li2CO3 is not equal for the as-obtained solid residues derived from the LiH–CO2 mixture with and without H2O. This result suggests that the content of Li2CO3 may relate to the amount of H2O. For the LiH–CO2 mixture reacting with various amounts of H2O, the XRD patterns of the as-obtained solid residues were analyzed by the Rietveld refinement (Fig. 4a and c and Fig. S8–S11†). The abundance of the major phases of Li2CO3 and Li2O is listed in Table S1. It is obvious that the content of the Li2CO3 phase increases with the amount of H2O, implying that the Li2CO3 can also be produced by the chemical reaction between LiH, H2O and CO2.
It is well known that LiH can react with H2O to produce LiOH and give off H2 at RT.35 Gaseous CO2 can be quickly absorbed by LiOH at RT (Fig. S12†). Hence, the Li2CO3 derived from the LiH, H2O and CO2 mixture can be described by the following chemical reactions. LiH + H2O → LiOH + H2(3) 2LiOH + CO2 → Li2CO3 + H2O(4)
The newly produced H2O will exist in the gaseous state because of the reactor temperature being above its boiling point, preventing the reaction between newly produced H2O and LiH. On the basis of eqn (3) and (4), the theoretical content of Li2CO3 is 20.6 wt%, which is less than the experimental value of 40.0 wt%, for the as-obtained solid residue as shown in Fig. 4a. Therefore, it can be concluded that the chemical reactions (eqn (2)–(4)) are together responsible for the Li2CO3 formation from the LiH–CO2 mixture with a small amount of H2O.
The reaction heat of eqn (3) and (4) is calculated to be −111.2 and −133.2 kJ mol−1 (Table S2), respectively, suggesting that the chemical interaction between LiH, H2O and CO2 is an exothermic reaction. As discussed above, it has been demonstrated that the reaction of eqn (1) can be initiated by heating the LiH–CO2 mixture to 212 °C. For the LiH–CO2 mixture with a small amount of H2O, the heat released from the exothermic reaction (eqn (3)) occurring at RT initiates the exothermic conversion reaction between LiH and CO2. The H2O added acts as an initiator for the chain reactions between LiH and CO2. According to the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products (Table S2), the heat released from eqn (1) is calculated to be −440.3 kJ mol−1, implying an exothermic nature for the efficient synthesis of HPC from CO2, which is consistent with the experimental phenomenon as shown in Fig. 2a. However, the chemical reaction between LiH and CO2 can occur only at the temperature above 212 °C (Fig. 4b), resulting from the high kinetic barrier. The reaction heat released from the exothermic reactions (eqn (3) and (4)) is as high as 177.8 kJ mol−1. As a consequence, this chemical reaction can be easily initiated by the reaction heat of eqn (3) and (4).
As for the formation mechanism of HPC, the gas blowing effect plays a key role in producing hierarchical porosity.14,36 A series of simultaneous/consecutive reactions including eqn (1)–(4) occurred in the synthesis process of HPC. A lot of H2 is released from these chemical reactions. The gas blowing effect of H2 is responsible for the generation of interconnected macropores in HPC as the macroporous structure can be clearly observed in the as-obtained solid residue (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the C and O elements are shown to be homogeneously distributed within the as-obtained solid residue (Fig. 5b and c), indicating that the byproducts of Li2O, Li2CO3 and LiOH are homogeneously dispersed in HPC. So, it can be concluded that the mesopores and micropores are probably produced during the removal of the byproducts (Li2O, Li2CO3 and LiOH) and/or by the chemical/physical activation of LiOH and residual CO2.37,38

Electrochemical lithium storage properties of HPC
The electrochemical lithium storage properties of HPC were evaluated using CR2032 coin-type half cells. Fig. 6a illustrates its cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves measured at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The electrochemical behaviors of the sample in the first cycle, particularly for the cathodic scan, are different from those in the subsequent cycles. In the first cathodic scan, two weak reduction peaks centered at ∼0.65 V and 1.50 V, which were only detected in the initial lithiation process, are observed. The peak around 0.65 V can be attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the carbon electrode. Another weak cathodic peak centered at ∼1.50 V may originate from the irreversible reaction of lithium ions with functional groups on the surface of the carbon electrode.39–41 These irreversible reactions are further confirmed by the galvanostatic charge/discharge result that a large irreversible capacity of 647 mA h g−1 is found in the first cycle (Fig. 6b). The dominant peak at 0–0.5 V corresponds to the reversible lithium storage of HPC. From the second to the third cycle, the CV curves have no obvious changes in voltages vs. Li/Li+ and peak current densities, demonstrating good reversibility of HPC for lithium storage. The redox peaks at 0.9/1.2 V can be clearly seen in the second and third cycle CV curves, which are associated with reversible lithium storage in the defects and pores of the HPC.18,42,43 The electrochemical behaviors of HPC are found to be similar to those of the non-graphitic carbon.

(c) Cycling properties and coulombic efficiency of HPC and commercial graphite at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. (d) Galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of HPC at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 A g−1. (e) Ultra-long cycling life and the rate performance of HPC and the cycling properties of commercial graphite cycled at 1 A g−1. 
As shown in Fig. 6c, the HPC delivers a discharge capacity of 1160 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 513 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 during the first cycle, corresponding to an initial coulombic efficiency of 44%. The low initial coulombic efficiency can be attributed to the formation of SEI layers on the large surface and interface areas of HPC and/or the irreversible lithium storage reaction of Li+ with functional groups on the surfaces.18,44 After several cycles, the HPC reaches a stable discharge capacity of ∼470 mA h g−1 and a high coulombic efficiency of ∼99%. The capacity of HPC decreases in the first several cycles may have mainly resulted from the gradual formation of the SEI layers on the HPC electrode. It should be noted that the discharge capacity increases gradually with the cycle number during continuous cycling (Fig. 6c). The discharge capacity increases from 470 mA h g−1 to 558 mA h g−1 in the 100th cycle. This phenomenon has also been observed in other carbon materials.43,45–47 The remarkable increase in discharge/charge capacity can be ascribed to the activation process of the carbon electrode during repeated Li insertion/extraction.44,48 The HPC exhibits excellent cycling properties and superior rate capability. The long cycling properties were evaluated at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 6e. It delivers a high reversible capacity of ∼830 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles, which is about 8 times and 10 times higher than that of the commercial graphite (Fig. 6e) and the amorphous activated carbon (Fig. S13†), respectively. After the initial 1000 charge/discharge cycles at the current density of 1.0 A g−1, the HPC was cycled at various current densities (Fig. 6d and e). Its reversible capacity reaches as high as ∼1150 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. It is obvious that the reversible capacity of the HPC decreases with the increasing charge/discharge current density. The discharge capacities are ∼1000, 825, 655 and 470 mA h g−1, respectively, for the HPC cycled at the current densities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 A g−1. When the current density is returned to 1.0 A g−1 after 100 cycles, the reversible capacity recovers to ∼815 mA h g−1 without remarkable capacity fading after 100 cycles. To examine the longer cycling stability, the HPC was further cycled at a current density of 2.0 A g−1. The reversible capacity of ∼555 mA h g−1 is maintained up to 2000 cycles (Fig. 6e), corresponding to a high capacity retention of 85%.
Compared with commercial graphite and other carbonaceous materials reported,7,10,18,41,45–49 the HPC exhibits a higher reversible capacity during the charge/discharge cycling and ultra-long cycle life (Table S3). The rate capability of the HPC is also superior to those of the commercial graphite and other carbon nanomaterials10,11,18,45–47 as depicted in Fig. S14.† These superior electrochemical properties are assigned to the unique nanostructure of the HPC. It has been known that the reversible lithium storage capacity of the HPC is much greater than that of graphite (Fig. S14†). The excess capacity may result from a high amount of extra lithium storage in the pores (including micropores, mesopores and macropores) and surfaces/interfaces, which act as reservoirs for electrochemical lithium storage.44 Meanwhile, the hierarchical porous structure can buffer the large volumetric effect (about 10% for lithium storage in the graphite50) during repeated intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions in the HPC, contributing to excellent cycling stability. Of course, a large irreversible capacity is inevitable during the first charge/discharge cycle as shown in Fig. 6c because of the high surface/interface area of the HPC. For understanding the superior rate capability of HPC, the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. S15†) were measured. The HPC has lower diffusion impedance and interfacial and charge transfer resistance than graphite at both open-circuit voltage and after forming stable SEI layers. It can be concluded that the interconnected porous nanostructure with a high porosity of 83% not only promotes the continuous and rapid transport of electrons, but also supplies fast transport channels for lithium ions. The synergistic effects of macropores, mesopores and micropores result in the superior rate capability of HPC.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an environmentally benign, efficient and high-yield route to synthesize HPC from a greenhouse gas through H2O-induced self-propagating reactions between CO2 and LiH. The as-synthesized HPC exhibited an interconnected micro–meso–macropore network structure with a high porosity of 83%. The formation mechanism of HPC was investigated by XRD, EDS, SEM, TEM, MS analyses and time dependence of sample temperature and gaseous pressure measurements. Owing to the unique hierarchical porous structure and high porosity, the HPC showed excellent electrochemical lithium storage properties with reversible capacities of ∼1150 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and ∼555 mA h g−1 up to 2000 cycles even at a high current density of 2.0 A g−1. Our results may provide a new avenue in tackling the long-term challenges of the greenhouse effect, energy crisis and air pollution.
Experimental section
Chemical reagents
LiH (97%, Aladdin), CO2 (>99.995%, Jingong), anhydrous ethanol (99.5%, Aladdin), Li2O (97%, Aladdin) and hydrochloric acid (AR, Sinopharm) were used as received without further purification. To prevent air and moisture contamination of LiH and Li2O, these reagents were handled in a MBRAUN glovebox filled with purified argon (>99.995%, Jingong).
Materials synthesis
The synthesis of HPC was performed in a homemade reactor equipped with 2 gas valves and a thermocouple. The sample temperatures and gaseous pressures in the reactor were monitored by using the thermocouple and pressure transducer. The reactor was sealed with a copper gasket. For a typical experiment, post-milled LiH powder (about 0.8 g) was loaded into a reactor in a glovebox (MBRAUN) filled with purified argon. About 6.5 bar CO2 was introduced into the reactor to mix with LiH powder. The chemical reaction between LiH and CO2 could be initiated by adding water and heating. In one case, a small amount of deionized water (e.g. 0.09, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36 and 0.45 g) was mixed with the solid–gas mixture LiH–CO2 through a gas valve. In the other case, the solid–gas mixture LiH–CO2 was heated from RT to 215 °C at a rate of 8 °C min−1. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was gradually cooled to RT, followed by washing the solid product with excess hydrochloric acid (6 M). The suspension of solid products was filtered from the above-mentioned solution with a microfilter. Subsequently, the as-obtained solid products were washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol. This procedure was repeated several times. Finally, the solid products were dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), in which the XRD patterns were measured on an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical Xpert Pro, MiniFlex 600) with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 15 mA. The XRD patterns were recorded over a 2θ range of 10–80°. During XRD measurements, a homemade holder was applied to protect the samples from moisture contamination. The XRD patterns of the crystalline products were refined with the Rietveld refinement program RIETAN-2000. The Raman spectra were measured using a Renishaw Invia Reflex micro-Raman spectrometer using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed using a Carl Zeiss Auriga, Oxford X-Max 80 SDD and FEI Tecnai G2 F30, respectively. The composition of gases derived from the chemical reactions between LiH and CO2 was analyzed using a mass spectrometer (QIC-20, Hiden). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained on a Quantachrome Autosorb analyser at 77 K. The specific surface area was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model, and the pore diameter distribution was analyzed on an AutoPore IV 9500 by using mercury intrusion porosimetry.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the working electrode were evaluated using CR2032 coin-type cells, which were assembled by using lithium foil as the counter electrode, Celgard membrane as the separator and 1 M LiPF6 solution of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (1:1 by volume) as the electrolyte. The assembly of coin-type cells was carried out in an argon-filled glovebox (H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 1 ppm). The active materials were mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride binder (85:15 by weight) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone to form a slurry. The slurry was coated onto copper foil and then dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The galvanostatic charge and discharge tests were conducted on a Neware battery test system. The charge/discharge cycling properties were measured in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V versus Li/Li+ at ambient temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained on a CHI650B electrochemical workstation (Chenhua).
