    , Accepted 23rd January 2017First published on 23rd January 2017AbstractA series of donor–acceptor type trans-A2B2 porphyrins and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes 5–13 have been synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The effect of the donor moieties (e.g., N-butylcarbazole, N-butylphenothiazine, and triphenylamine) on the spectroscopic properties of the porphyrins has been studied. The structural changes indeed affected the optical and electrochemical properties of these porphyrins. Higher energy shifts of the Soret bands were observed for porphyrins upon varying the donor moieties. The electrochemical studies of all the derivatives indicated increased interactions between the donor groups and the porphyrin core, which in turn are reflected in the anodic shifts in their reduction potentials. Both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies revealed effective energy transfer (EET; up to 87%) from donor groups to the porphyrin core in the porphyrins, 5–10. The palladium(II) porphyrin complexes, 11–13, showed characteristic phosphorescence in the near IR region. Density functional theory (DFT) studies support the presence of donor–acceptor interaction between the porphyrin core and the meso-substituents in the dyads. Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies showed that in 5, 8 and 11, the transitions are of π → π* type; whereas in the other molecules viz.6, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 13 intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is involved in all the respective highest intensity absorption transitions.
Introduction
Porphyrins1 are one of the essential parts in the natural photosynthetic antenna systems,2 which harvest sunlight in plants and other microorganisms efficiently.3 In the last two decades, the realm of porphyrins4 and their expanded,5 contracted,6 core-modified,7 and π-extended8 analogues has seen a phenomenal rise. The continuous upsurge in the number of publications in this area illustrates the potential applications of porphyrins in optical technology and biomedicine. Porphyrins can act as probes for a variety of diagnostic techniques including ultrasound,9 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),10 positron emission tomography (PET),11 fluorescence12 and photo-acoustic tomography.13 Porphyrin derivatives and their expanded analogues have also been used as chemosensors14 to detect anions and heavy metals.15 A porphyrin macrocycle can act as a ligand and a variety of metalloporphyrins containing alkaline earth metals like Mg(II) or “d-block” metals16 such as Fe(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Pd(II), Pt(II), and “f-block” metals (e.g., Gd(III), La(III), Yb(III), Nd(III), and Er(III))17 are well known. Combinations of the heavy metals, particularly with Pd(II) and Pt(II) lead to efficient phosphorescence materials and are suitable for oxygen sensing studies due to long-lived triplet-excited states.18 In contrast, zinc(II) porphyrin derivatives have been reported as versatile photosensitizers for applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with a high electric power conversion efficiency (η = 16–17%).19
Due to their large absorption coefficient20 in the visible region, porphyrin based D–A (donor–acceptor) type energy transfer systems21 have been used as popular models to understand the phases of photosynthesis. In the design of an appropriate D–A type energy transfer system, we have incorporated carbazole or naphthalene moieties as electron/energy donors in such molecules as functionalized corroles and 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacenes (BODIPYs) and the aza-analogues (Aza-BODIPYs).22 The selective excitation of the donor moiety in such D–A type systems is imperative to understand the energy transfer processes. An amalgamation of different chromophores with porphyrin is one of the ways to achieve selective excitation in such porphyrin conjugates.23 The substitution of energy donor moieties at the meso-positions of porphyrin is a practically useful synthetic strategy24 to make D–A type porphyrin based systems. One-pot condensation of aromatic aldehydes with pyrrole/dipyrromethane is commonly employed to prepare meso-substituted porphyrins (A4, cis/trans-A2B2 or A3B types).25 Self-condensation of dipyrromethene-1-carbinol has also been utilized to make trans-A2B2 porphyrins in good yields.26 The choice of an appropriate aromatic aldehyde, 5-substituted dipyrromethane and an acid catalyst are crucial for the porphyrin ring formation.27 Keeping this in mind, we selected three bulky aromatic aldehydes, pentafluorophenyldipyrromethane and a Brønsted acid for macrocyclization.
Herein, we report nine trans-A2B2 type porphyrins comprising two donor groups (N-butylcarbazole/N-butylphenothiazine/triphenylamine) at their meso-positions; the other two meso-positions are occupied by the pentafluorophenyl groups. A modified two-step synthetic strategy was applied to obtain trans-A2B2 porphyrins in decent yields. Using these D–A porphyrins as ligands, the corresponding Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes have also been prepared. The effect of the donor groups on the porphyrin ring was studied by UV-vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry and computational (DFT) methods. Time-resolved and steady state fluorescence studies suggested effective energy-transfer from donor groups to the porphyrin ring in these molecules.
Results and discussion
Donor–acceptor type trans-A2B2 porphyrins possessing bulky aromatic moieties like N-butylcarbazole, N-butylphenothiazine and triphenylamine were synthesized within two reaction steps. In the first step, key precursors, 5-pentafluorophenyl-substituted dipyrromethane (1) and aromatic aldehydes (2–4) were synthesized following the literature reported procedures.28 The conventional procedure25b involved the synthesis of trans-A2B2-porphyrins via one-pot condensation of aryl aldehydes with meso-aryl dipyrromethane in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) followed by treatment with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) as an oxidizing agent. Initially, we attempted the condensation of pentafluorophenylaldehyde with 5-carbazolyldipyrromethanes (Scheme 1) in the presence of TFA in dichloromethane (DCM) solution and subsequent oxidation of the mixture with DDQ. However, this method did not work in our hands and no desired porphyrin was isolated. Therefore, a modified synthetic strategy was adopted (Scheme 2).

 Scheme 2  Modified synthesis of D–A type A2B2 porphyrins 5–7. 
The combination of the substrates was likely crucial for preparation of this type of porphyrins; the condensation of the bulky electron donating aldehydes, 2–4 with 5-pentafluorophenyl-dipyrromethane 1 in the presence of the TFA catalyst followed by DDQ oxidation gave rise to the corresponding brownish-purple spot for the porphyrin-like fraction on a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. This is in fact a similar method for corrole synthesis,29 however, no corrole was observed under our reaction conditions. The desired A2B2-porphyrins, 5–7 were isolated in decent yields (15–16%) by column chromatographic techniques (over SiO2 and Al2O3) along with the trace amount of corresponding A3B type porphyrins presumably formed via scrambling.30 The formation of an A3B type porphyrin (having three C6F5 groups and one triphenylamine group) was confirmed by 1H NMR and mass spectroscopies only in the reaction of porphyrin 7. Then, the syntheses of metal complexes of porphyrins 8–13 (Scheme 3) were performed by dissolving the free base porphyrins 5–7 in DCM followed by addition of metal salts dissolved in methanol. A longer reaction time (∼24 h) was required for the formation of the Pd(II) porphyrins than that for the Zn(II) porphyrins, because of the poor solubility of palladium salts. The crude products were subjected to neutral alumina column chromatography to obtain pure compounds. Consequently, the zinc porphyrins 8–10 were obtained in 80–89% yields and the palladium porphyrins 11–13 were produced in 76–86% yields.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of Zn(II) and Pd(II) derivatives of D–A type A2B2 porphyrins. 
All the porphyrins 5–13 were characterized by standard spectroscopic techniques viz.1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MALDI-TOF or ESI-MS spectroscopies. The representative 1H and HOMO-COSY spectra of porphyrin 5 (aromatic region) are shown in Fig. 1. With the aid of a COSY spectrum, the structure of porphyrin 5 was identified; the eight β pyrrole protons showed up as two separate doublets around 9.01 and 8.78 ppm. The aryl protons of the meso-N-butylcarbazole groups appeared between 8.20 to 7.31 ppm. The upfield signal at −2.64 ppm is characteristic of the two inner N–H protons of the aromatic porphyrin core (cf. ESI†). The signals at 4.58, 2.13, 1.63 and 1.11 ppm appeared for the butyl chain of N-butylcarbazole groups. In the case of metalloporphyrins 8–13, the disappearance of the characteristic upfield signal of inner N–H protons suggests the formation of metal complexes. Furthermore, the corresponding parent mass numbers were also obtained for the other derivatives (cf. ESI†).

X-ray crystal structure
The violet colour crystals of 7 suitable for crystallographic analysis were obtained by slow evaporation of the chloroform solution over a period of two weeks. An ORTEP view of 7 (CCDC 1058840) is shown in Fig. 2, and the crystallographic data are given in Table 1. Porphyrin 7 was crystallized as a dimer in the crystal lattice. The porphyrin ring is slightly ruffled compared to the structure of the unsubstituted tetraphenylporphyrin (namely, H2TPP),31 while the observed bond lengths and bond angles of the porphyrin macrocycle are not significantly different.31 The propeller shaped meso-triphenylamine groups are lying perpendicularly to the porphyrin plane. The dihedral angles between one meso-triphenylamine group and the porphyrin plane [C77–C78–C95–C100, C79–C78–C95–C96] were calculated to be 87.0(8)° and 86.9(8)°, respectively. The torsion angles between the other meso-triphenylamine group and the porphyrin plane [C69–C88–C119–C120, C87–C88–C119–C124] were given to be 61.6(10)° and 55.9(10)°, respectively. These torsion angles between the meso-donor groups are comparatively smaller than those of the reported meso-tetraarylporphyrin31 and imply increased electronic interaction between these groups and the porphyrin core.

Absorption and steady state fluorescence studies
UV-Vis absorption spectra of all the porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were recorded in toluene at room temperature. The absorption and emission data are presented in Table 2, and the comparative absorption spectra of 5–10 are shown in Fig. 3. All the porphyrins exhibit well-defined narrow absorption bands and the absorption data (Table 2) are consistent as per the literature reports.32 In the case of free base porphyrins 5–7 (Fig. 3a) the Soret band appears in the range of 412 to 430 nm, followed by four Q-bands. In the case of 5 where the meso-substituent is N-butylcarbazole, the Soret absorption is about 10 nm bathochromically shifted compared to H2TPP. However, the wavelengths of Q-bands are not significantly altered.

This may be explained in terms of the effect of an extended π-conjugation of the N-butylcarbazole moiety which perturbs the electron density of the macrocyclic ring. In the case of 6 and 7, the presence of N-butylphenothiazine and triphenylamine at the meso-positions does not perturb the electron density of the porphyrin ring, thus the wavelengths of Soret bands are not altered. However, a clear hypsochromic shift in the Soret bands was observed upon changing the meso-donor groups from N-butylcarbazole to N-butylphenothiazine and from N-butylphenothiazine to triphenylamine in free base porphyrins 5–7. In the case of zinc porphyrins 8–10, a sharp Soret band was observed in the range of 417–432 nm followed by two Q-bands; again meso-N-butylcarbazole groups in 8 produced a 12 nm red shift in the Soret band as compared to ZnTPP.32 The first Q-bands of 8–10 were 7 to 19 nm bathochromically shifted as that of ZnTPP; in contrast to the Soret bands the presence of donor groups has significantly shifted the Q-bands of zinc porphyrins. The palladium porphyrins 11–13 showed typical absorption spectra with a Soret band around 408–428 nm and two Q-bands in the range of 525 to 557 nm (Fig. 7). The absorption spectra of palladium porphyrins 11–13 exhibited 2–22 nm red shifted Soret bands as compared to the meso-pentafluorophenyl porphyrin palladium complex (termed PdTFPP).33 The absorption wavelengths of the higher energy Q-bands were 7–8 nm red shifted as compared to that of PdTFPP;33 also unlike PdTFPP the intensity of these Q-bands was much higher than that of the lower energy Q-bands of 11–13.
The fluorescence spectra of all the porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were also recorded in toluene at room temperature. The comparative emission spectra of porphyrins 5–10 are shown in Fig. 4. The emission spectra of porphyrins often consist of two emission bands with the vibronic structures. The emission patterns of the porphyrins 5–7 were similar to the parent H2TPP with two emission bands in the range of 659 to 721 nm. The higher energy emission bands of 5–7 were 7–10 nm red shifted as compared to that of H2TPP.34 In the case of zinc porphyrin 8, two fluorescence bands appeared at 607 and 655 nm, and both were 10 nm bathochromically shifted as compared to ZnTPP.34 In the case of zinc porphyrins 9–10, both emission bands were significantly red shifted; with respect to ZnTPP porphyrins 9 and 10 showed 64 nm red shifted higher energy emission bands at 661 and 660 nm, respectively. Similarly, 9 and 10 displayed red shifted lower energy bands at 721 and 711 nm, the bathochromic shifts were 76 nm and 64 nm, respectively. Unlike ZnTPP, no distinct S2 emission was observed for the Zn porphyrins 8–10 reported in this work.34 The fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) of free base and zinc porphyrins were estimated from the emission and absorption spectra by a comparative method, using standard H2TPP (Φf = 0.11) and ZnTPP (Φf = 0.033) respectively. The fluorescence quantum yields of all the porphyrins are lower than their corresponding parent porphyrins (H2TPP and ZnTPP) which indicate pronounced nonradiative decay processes of their excited singlet states.

All the porphyrins 5–10 designed in this work represented an energy transfer event from aromatic bulky donor groups to the porphyrin core. The energy donor groups viz. N-butylcarbazole, N-butylphenothiazine and triphenylamine groups have a strong absorption in the range of 300–350 nm and the porphyrin absorbs in the range of 415–650 nm. Therefore, possibly selective excitation at the donor groups can result in energy transfer to the porphyrin core.22a The absorption and emission spectra of three donor molecules are shown in ESI, S16.† Also a comparison of absorption spectra of porphyrins 5–7 along with their 2:1 mixture of H2TPP and the corresponding energy donor groups are shown in ESI, S17.† All the porphyrins 5–10 were subjected to qualitative and quantitative energy transfer studies to understand the effect of donor groups. To demonstrate the energy transfer process in the porphyrins 5–10, qualitative steady state fluorescence experiments were carried out. In the qualitative studies, emission spectra of the mixture of the corresponding donor (i.e. N-butylcarbazole/N-butylphenothiazine/triphenylamine) and acceptor (porphyrins) in a ratio of 2:1 were recorded by selective excitation at the donor unit. A comparison of the emission spectra of porphyrins 5–7 along with their 2:1 mixture of H2TPP and the corresponding energy donor groups are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5a, upon excitation of the mixture of N-butylcarbazole:H2TPP (2:1) at 290 nm, where the donor absorbs strongly, emission was observed exclusively from N-butylcarbazole between 350 and 430 nm and a very weak emission was observed from H2TPP. On the other hand, in the case of porphyrin 5, the selective excitation of the donor N-butylcarbazole group at the same wavelength resulted in a weak and slightly red shifted emission from the N-butylcarbazole group (λem: 350–500 nm) and a strong emission from the acceptor porphyrin core at λem = 659 nm. However, in the case of a 2:1 mixture of N-butylphenothiazine and H2TPP (Fig. 5b) due to the overlapping absorption of N-butyl phenothiazine and porphyrins, the emission spectra had almost similar intensities for both the components. On the other hand, excitation of the N-butylphenothiazine group in porphyrin 6 resulted in a major emission from the porphyrin core around 650–800 nm, indicating an energy transfer from meso-N-butylphenothiazine to the porphyrin core. Similar studies were carried out for zinc porphyrins 8–10 and their corresponding energy donor groups and ZnTPP (Table 3). Thus, it has been clearly observed that, when the donor is covalently linked to the porphyrin core and is in close proximity the energy transfer occurs. When the donor and porphyrin existed as individual monomers in a solution phase (2:1 mixture), then the energy transfer could not be observed. However, more studies are required to know the exact interactions between the donor and acceptor in these D–A porphyrins.

In order to estimate the extent of energy transfer in these porphyrins, the energy transfer efficiency (ETE, %) was calculated and the data are summarized in Table 3. The ETE is a measure of total energy transfer irrespective of the mechanism, and also includes the loss in energy by a non-radiative process in energy transfer.35 The ETE % can be calculated as follows:  
For ETE estimation, the quantum yields of porphyrins were calculated at two different wavelengths, namely, excited at the donor and excited at the acceptor (porphyrin core). The calculated ETE was in the range of 70–87% and maximum ETE was observed for zinc porphyrin 9 having two meso-N-butylphenothiazine donor groups. A closer look at Fig. 5 clearly shows that the emission maxima of the donor and acceptor in porphyrins 5–10 were not altered much; thus through bond energy transfer might be feasible. Moreover, the quantum yields of the acceptor porphyrin core in 5–10 did not change much when excited at the acceptor's wavelengths. Nevertheless, the quantum yields of the donor groups in porphyrins 5–10 were reduced compared to their free corresponding donor molecules. This observation suggests an efficient energy transfer from meso-donor groups to the porphyrin core in these porphyrins.
Time-resolved fluorescence studies
To gain an insight about the extent of energy transfer from various donor groups, quantitative studies were performed on the basis of lifetime measurements. In this method, singlet excited state lifetimes of donor groups in porphyrins 5–10 and of free donor molecules (2–4) were measured separately using a time resolved fluorescence technique (Table 4). The porphyrins 5–10 were excited both at 405 and 330 nm, corresponding to their porphyrin core and meso-donor moieties. The data were collected at altered wavelengths corresponding to the emission peak maxima of the donor moieties and the porphyrin core in 5–10. The time-resolved fluorescence spectra of free base and zinc porphyrins have been shown as an overlay in Fig. 6. The fluorescence decays of free base porphyrins 5–7 (when excited at porphyrin core) were fitted to the monoexponential and observed lifetimes were in the range of 7.1 to 8.3 ns. These data are closer to the singlet state lifetime of H2TPP (Table 4).36 The observed lifetime values are slightly lower than the parent ZnTPP (1.9 ns). It has been observed that when the porphyrins were excited at the donor (330 nm), the lifetime of the donors reduced drastically which was measured through a biexponential decay profile. The other minor components (<10%) of the fluorescence decays of porphyrins 5–10 were attributed to some impurities present in the samples. The major short components (τ1) observed for 5–10 (Table 4) were designated to the corresponding donor groups. Upon excitation at the donor wavelength, this phenomenon of the reduced excited state lifetime of the meso-donor groups in porphyrins 5–10 suggests a singlet–singlet energy transfer from the donor to the porphyrin core. The singlet excited state lifetimes were used to calculate the rates of energy transfer (kENT) and efficiency of energy transfer (ΦENT) as per the literature reports.36a An inspection of Table 5 reveals that the energy transfer rates and efficiencies in the free base porphyrins 5–7 were much lower than their corresponding zinc porphyrins 8–10. The values of kENT and ΦENT were lower than those of the literature reported porphyrin based D–A systems.36 The slower rates in these D–A porphyrins could be due to the meso-pentafluorophenyl groups, which affect the electronic communication between the donor–acceptor in porphyrin based systems.36 The perpendicular orientation of meso-donor aryl groups to the porphyrins could also be an additional factor responsible for the slower energy transfer rates. It is reported that the non-planarity of the donor and acceptor in the porphyrin-based systems decreases the electronic communication, thereby reducing the rates of energy transfer.36

Phosphorescence studies
Palladium(II) porphyrins are known to be phosphorescent in nature with potential applications in materials and biology.33 The emissive properties of three Pd(II) porphyrins 11–13 were studied in deaerated toluene. The photoluminescence spectra of 11–13 are shown in Fig. 7. The emission spectra showed two phosphorescence bands for 11 and 12; whereas a single phosphorescence band was observed with a weak vibronic shoulder for 13. Negligible fluorescence was observed in these spectra due to the rapid singlet–triplet intersystem crossing in these Pd(II) porphyrins. An efficient phosphorescence was seen for all three porphyrins as a result of palladium induced spin–orbit coupling which promotes radiative decay from the triplet state (T1). The two phosphorescence bands in 11 (664 and 717 nm) and 12 (660, 725 nm) were red shifted as compared to their corresponding lowest Q-band absorption. Similarly, the major phosphorescence band in 13 (707 nm) was significantly red shifted as compared to the lowest Q-band absorption of the same. Phosphorescence quantum yields were also measured to be Φph = 0.050 for 11, 0.055 for 12, and 0.024 for 13.

Electrochemical studies
In order to gain further insight into the properties of these porphyrins and their metal complexes preliminary electrochemical studies were carried out. Cyclic voltammograms of porphyrins 5–13 were recorded in dry dichloromethane in the presence of 0.1 M TBAP as a supporting electrolyte under a N2 atmosphere. The redox potential data and cyclic voltammograms are shown in Table 6 and Fig. 8, respectively. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels and band gaps were also calculated for compounds 5–13 and a schematic energy level diagram is presented in Fig. 9. In general, for porphyrin systems two oxidation and two reduction peaks are observed in cyclic voltammetries.42 This may be ascribed to the fact that the first oxidation peak is observed due to the formation of a cation radical and the second oxidation peak which appears at a higher potential is due to the formation of a dication. Similarly, the first reduction potential appears due to the formation of an anion radical and the second at a higher potential is due to a dianion. Earlier studies have revealed that redox behaviour of porphyrins is affected by substituents on the ring which renders direct electronic influences. In the case of meso-tetraarylporphyrins, oxidation or reduction in non-aqueous media are one-electron processes with the formation of a π-cation radical and dication or a π-anion radical and dianion. In the case of freebase porphyrins 5–7 two oxidation and two reduction waves were observed in the cyclic voltammetry. Both the first and second oxidation potentials of porphyrin 5–7 showed anodic shifts as compared to H2TPP (Eox: +1.03, +1.30 V respectively).42 This indicated that porphyrins 5–7 were difficult to oxidise as compared to H2TPP. The first and second reduction potentials of porphyrin 5–7 were also anodically shifted than those of H2TPP (Ered: −1.23, −1.55 V respectively); suggesting that 5–7 were easy to reduce as compared to parent H2TPP. In the case of zinc porphyrins 8–10, both oxidation potentials exhibited anodic shifts as compared to ZnTPP (+0.80, +1.09 V respectively). Similarly, the first and second reduction potentials of 8–10 were less negative than those of the ZnTPP (−1.25, −1.65 V, respectively).42 The anodic shifts in the oxidation potentials of the porphyrins 5–10 may be ascribed to the presence of the electron withdrawing effect of two meso-pentafluorophenyl groups. The palladium porphyrins 11–13 showed two oxidation and two reduction waves, unlike Pd(OEP).43 The observed first and second oxidation potentials of 11–13 were higher than the reported oxidation potential (+0.82 V) of Pd(OEP).

The first and second reduction potentials exhibited anodic shifts as compared to the reduction potential (−1.53 V) of Pd(OEP). Thus, palladium porphyrins 11–13 were easier to reduce than the Pd(OEP). A close inspection of the data presented in Table 8 suggests that maximum anodic shifts were observed for the porphyrins having meso-triphenylamine groups (i.e.7, 10 and 13) as compared to the porphyrins having meso-N-butylcarbazole or meso-N-butylphenothiazine groups.
For organic molecules the HOMO energy level indicates the energy required to extract an electron from a molecule, which is an oxidation process. Similarly, the LUMO energy level indicates the energy necessary to inject an electron to a molecule which implies a reduction process. The HOMO and LUMO levels of porphyrins 5–13 were approximated from the electrochemical data44 given in Table 6. As per the literature reports, the electrochemically measured HOMO–LUMO gap of tetraarylporphryins is 2.25 ± 0.15 V and it is independent of the central metal ions.45 Another report by Kadish and co-workers suggested that the HOMO–LUMO gap of the porphyrins is partially dependent on the nature of the central metal ion, substituents on the ring and planarity of the ring.45 As is evident from the energy level diagram (Fig. 9), the HOMO–LUMO gap for zinc porphyrins 8–10 was slightly higher than that of freebase 5–7; and the highest bandgap energy was found for palladium porphyrins 11–13. The literature reported HOMO–LUMO gap of PdTPP is 2.44 V, whereas porphyrins 11–13 have a higher bandgap ranging from 2.01 to 2.37 V. The freebase porphyrins 5–7 have a HOMO–LUMO gap in the range of 2.13 to 2.25 V, which is very close to that of the reported H2TPP. On the other hand, the measured bandgap of ZnTPP is 2.15 V and porphyrins 8–10 have lower bandgap values ranging from 2.00 to 2.07 V. Usually oxidation of metalloporphyrins into Zn(III) and Pd(III) complexes is unlikely, thus we propose that oxidation and reduction couples observed for 5–13 in the cyclic voltammograms are ligand-centered redox processes.
In addition to intramolecular singlet excitation energy transfer (EET), the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) may also be a considerable quenching pathway in these D–A porphyrins. Hence, we evaluated the relationships of energy levels for porphyrins 5–10 using fluorescence and redox potential data (Table 6). The singlet state energies (S1) for the corresponding donor groups [N-butylcarbazole, N-butylphenothiazine and triphenylamine] were calculated from their absorption and emission data; the charge-separated state has been estimated from the first oxidation and first reduction potentials of the D–A porphyrins.37 In order to understand the possibility of photoinduced electron transfer processes (PET) in the porphyrins 5–10, we have calculated the free energy of this process by the following equation:37ΔGPET (D–A) = ECT (D–A) − E0–0 (D),where ΔGPET (D–A) is the free energy change during the electron transfer from the donor to acceptor. ECT (D–A) is the energy of the charge transfer state of the D–A molecule [D–A porphyrins 5–10] obtained from the 1st oxidation and 1st reduction potentials as determined by cyclic voltammetry measurements. E0–0 (D) is the zero–zero excitation energy obtained from the average of the frequencies of the longest wavelength absorption maxima and the shortest wavelength emission maxima of the D molecule [N-butylcarbazole, N-butylphenothiazine, triphenylamine]. These values are calculated using the above-mentioned equation for porphyrins 5–10 and the donors and the data are presented in Table 7.

The schematic energy level diagrams depicting PET and EET processes in the porphyrins, 5 and 8 having N-butylcarbazole (CBZ) as the donor and core porphyrin acceptors (H2) and (Zn) respectively, are shown in Fig. 10. The intramolecular EET from the CBZ donor group to either the freebase (H2) or zinc (Zn) porphyrin acceptor is a thermodynamically favoured process; the singlet state energy of free N-butylcarbazole is higher (3.55 eV) than that of the freebase (1.94 eV) or zinc porphyrin (2.05 eV) core in 5 and 8 respectively.37 The PET reaction from the donor CBZ to core porphyrins cannot be ruled out based on thermodynamic considerations, when excited at 330 nm. This PET reaction leads to a charge-transfer state of the type CBZ˙+–(H2)˙− or CBZ˙+–(Zn)˙− and the values of free energy change ΔGPET for porphyrins 5 and 8 were −1.02 and −1.48 eV respectively (Table 7). We believe that the co-occurrence of strong intramolecular EET and less prominent PET may be responsible for the quenched emission of the donor moiety in these porphyrins when excited at 330 nm. Similar observations were made for D–A porphyrins 6, 7, 9, 10 and the energy level diagrams are provided in the ESI, S15 and S16.†

Comparison of geometrical parameters
Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were used to optimize the structure of D–A porphyrins 5–13, also their absorption spectra were simulated using TD-DFT.38–41 A comparison of the critical structural parameters for the optimized ground state geometry of porphyrin 7 obtained by the B3LYP/LACVP* method with the experimental structure obtained by the X-ray crystallographic analysis is highly indispensable.
The largest deviation in the bond lengths of 7 is 0.0238 Å and its bond angles agree within 2.199°. Thus, the computed structures are well reproduced with the experimental one, justifying the use of the level of theory for the geometry optimization. The calculated geometrical parameters of 7 are summarized in Table 8 and its optimized structure is displayed in Fig. 11. In addition, the optimized structures of molecule 5–13 excluding 7 are given in ESI, S18 and S19.†

Absorption studies
To dig deeper into the origins of absorption bands, the transitions of the various molecules in consideration were simulated using the above-mentioned level of theory. The absorption bands of molecules 5–13 are summarized in Table 9. The absorption spectra offer excitation energies and frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) involved in the absorption process. Here using the TD-DFT method, we calculated the respective absorption spectra of porphyrins 5–13 according to their S0-geometries. Our calculations predict the first ten absorbing transitions for all the molecules. Table 9 accommodates the calculated electronic transition energies and corresponding transition oscillator strengths of 1 and 2. The most intense calculated singlet transition S0 → S6 of 5 at 458 nm and the blue shifted singlet transitions S0 → S7 of 6 and 7 at 400 nm and 398 nm respectively are all consistent with the experimental observations. Likewise, in 8–10, the calculated singlet transitions with the highest intensity are S0 → S6, S0 → S7 and S0 → S7 at 445 nm, 385 nm and 385 nm respectively. Similarly, the calculated highest intensity transitions in the case of 11–13 are S0 → S5, S0 → S6 and S0 → S6 at 441 nm, 486 and 492 respectively.

The calculated frontier molecular orbitals involved in the main electronic transitions with the highest oscillator strengths are presented in Fig. 12a–c. The results show that the most intense sixth singlet transition (S0 → S6) for 5 with an oscillator strength of 0.3523 is a dominant π → π* transition from the fourth highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO−3) to the second lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO+1), both HOMO−3 and LUMO+1 are localized at the porphyrin core. In the case of 6 and 7, the S0 → S7 transitions from HOMO−3 to LUMO having oscillator strengths of 0.9014 and 0.7542 respectively are showing a charge transfer character. Here it is obvious that HOMO−3 is spread almost over the entire molecular framework and LUMO is transferred to the porphyrin core reflecting the intramolecular charge transfer. As in the case of 5, the sixth singlet transition (S0 → S6) for 8 with an oscillator strength of 0.2664 is a dominant π → π* transition from the third highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO−2) to the second lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO+1). Both HOMO−2 and LUMO+1 are localized at the porphyrin core. While, in 9 and 10, the S0 → S7 transitions from HOMO−2 to LUMO and HOMO−3 to LUMO+1 having oscillator strengths of 1.4021 and 1.8544 respectively present a charge transfer character. Here it can be seen that HOMO−2 and HOMO−3 are spread almost over the entire molecular framework and LUMO and LUMO+1 are shifted towards the porphyrin core showing an obvious intramolecular charge transfer in 9 and 10. In the same manner, the most intense fifth singlet transition (S0 → S5) for 11 with an oscillator strength of 0.3659 is a π → π* transition occurring from the fourth highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO−3) to the second lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO+1). Both HOMO−3 and LUMO+1 are confined at the porphyrin core. In the case of 12 and 13, the S0 → S6 transitions from HOMO−3 to LUMO+1 having oscillator strengths of 0.1426 and 0.1552 respectively display a charge transfer character. It is quite evident that HOMO−3 is spread over the entire molecule in 12 and 13 while the corresponding LUMO+1 in both these molecules is shifted towards the porphyrin core revealing the intramolecular charge transfer.

In addition, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are related to the oxidation and reduction processes respectively. In organic molecules, the HOMO energy level indicates the energy required for oxidation i.e., to extract an electron from a molecule while the LUMO energy level is related to the energy needed for the reduction process i.e., to inject an electron into a molecule. The DFT calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps for 5–13 are accommodated in Table 10. It is clear from the table that the HOMO–LUMO gaps of zinc porphyrins 8–10 are less than those of the corresponding freebase porphyrins 5–7, whereas the corresponding palladium porphyrins 11–13 possessed the highest HOMO–LUMO gaps. Furthermore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are related to the redox phenomenon of porphyrins. In relation to this, the calculated low energy of HOMO of 7 in comparison with 5 and 6 indicates its lower oxidation potential than 5 and 6. Similarly, the HOMO energies of 10 and 13 are less than 8, 9 and 11, 12 respectively pointing that the 10 and 13 have a lower oxidation potential than 8, 9 and 11, 12 respectively. Likewise, the lower LUMO energies of 7 than 5 and 6 indicates the higher reduction potential of 7 in comparison with 5 and 6. Also, 10 and 13 possess lower LUMO energies than 8, 9 and 11, 12 respectively directing the higher reduction potential of 10 and 13 in comparison with 8, 9 and 11, 12 respectively. All the energy values are quite consistent with the observations of cyclic voltammetry where maximum anodic shifts were observed for the porphyrins having meso-triphenylamine groups (i.e.7, 10 and 13) as compared to the porphyrins having meso-N-butylcarbazole or meso-N-butylphenothiazine groups.

Conclusion
A series of energy D–A type trans-A2B2 porphyrins and their corresponding Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes have been successfully synthesized and characterized. The substitution of bulky aromatic donor groups like N-butylcarbazole, N-butylphenothiazine and triphenylamine affected the optical and electrochemical properties of the porphyrins. From the qualitative and quantitative energy transfer studies, an efficient energy transfer up to 87% was observed from donor groups to the porphyrin core. The S1 emission dynamics was analysed by time-resolved spectroscopy (TCSPC). Electrochemical studies revealed anodic shifts in their oxidation potentials as compared to their corresponding parent porphyrins, thus making them difficult to oxidise. The Pd(II) porphyrins exhibited phosphorescence in the range of 600–850 nm and also the largest HOMO–LUMO gap among all porphyrins. Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies showed that in 5, 8 and 11, the transitions are of π → π* type while in all the remaining molecules viz.6, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 13 there is an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) involved in all the respective highest intensity absorption transitions. All the DFT calculated HOMO and LUMO energy values are quite in agreement with the cyclic voltammetry observations representing that the oxidation and reduction potentials of porphyrins having meso-triphenylamine groups (i.e.7, 10 and 13) are lower and higher respectively as compared to the porphyrins having meso-N-butylcarbazole or meso-N-butylphenothiazine groups.
Experimental
Instrumentation and reagents
Unless otherwise mentioned, all the reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich, Acros Organics or Merck and used without further purification. Silica gel (60–120 mesh size) used for column chromatography was procured from Merck. The NMR spectra of compounds were recorded with a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz NMR spectrometer at IIT Gandhinagar. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1700 (Japan). Fluorescence emission measurements were recorded with a Horiba-Jobin Yvon Fluorlog-3 spectrometer (France). Fluorescence lifetime measurements were done using a Life Spec II spectrofluorometer, Edinburgh Instruments (UK). Phosphorescence spectra and absolute quantum yield of emission were measured with a phosphorescence quantum yield measurement system (C9920-02, Hamamatsu). MALDI mass data for compounds were recorded with a Bruker Daltonics MALDI-TOF instrument. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were carried out with an electrochemical system (CH1660E, CH instruments, USA) utilizing the three electrode configuration consisting of a glassy carbon (working electrode), platinum wire (auxiliary electrode) and saturated calomel (reference electrode) electrodes. The experiments were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere in dry DCM using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as a supporting electrolyte. All potentials were calibrated vs. a saturated calomel electrode by the addition of ferrocene as an internal standard, taking E1/2 (Fc/Fc+) = 0.38 V vs. SCE.
Computational details
All the density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programs suite.38 The geometries of all the molecules with metal and without metal in the singlet ground state were fully optimized in the gas phase using Becke's three parameter hybrid exchange and the nonlocal correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr (B3LYP).39,40 The standard 6-31G* basis set function of DFT has been employed for all the atoms (C, H, N, S, F) except the palladium (Pd) and zinc (Zn) atoms for which effective core potential (ECP) of Wadt and Hay pseudo-potential with a double-ζ valence basis set LANL2DZ41 was used. For the structural calculations of transition metal complexes, the relativistic LANL2DZ pseudopotential is the typical basis set and is identified to give close agreement between optimized and experimentally observed structures for Pd and Zn complexes. Frequency calculations were carried out to verify that the optimized molecular structures correspond to the energy minima, thus only positive frequencies were expected. The TD-DFT studies of all the molecules were performed by utilizing the same functional and the basis sets viz. B3LYP, 6-31G* for atoms (C, H, N, S, F) and LANL2DZ for Pd and Zn.
General synthesis of porphyrins (5–7)
Aldehyde (100 mmol) and dipyrromethane (200 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (40 mL) and stirred for 2 min followed by addition of trifluoroacetic acid (5 μL). The reaction mixture was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h at room temperature in the dark. After that 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ, 300 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for another 3 h under air. Formation of the desired porphyrin was identified by observation of a maroon colour spot on TLC (in 30% DCM/hexane). The crude reaction mixture was subjected to silica gel column chromatography to filter off excess DDQ and other oligomeric products using 100% DCM. Further purification was carried out with neutral alumina column chromatography and the desired porphyrins (5–7) were eluted with 20–30% DCM/hexane.
General procedure for the synthesis of Zn(II) porphyrins (8–10)
Porphyrin (0.011 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (20 mL) and zinc(II) acetate (0.034 g) dissolved in methanol (15 mL) was added to it. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h under atmospheric conditions. The formation of the desired product was identified by observation of a pink colour spot on TLC (50% DCM/hexane), where the Zn(II) porphyrin appeared more polar compared to the starting porphyrin. The desired zinc porphyrins (8–10) were purified by neutral alumina column chromatography using a 70% DCM/hexane mixture.
General procedure for the synthesis of Pd(II) porphyrins (11–13)
Porphyrin (0.01 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (20 mL) and palladium(II) chloride (0.04 g) dissolved in methanol (25 mL) was added to it. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h under atmospheric conditions. The formation of the desired product was identified by observation of an orange colour spot on TLC (80% DCM/hexane), where the Pd(II) porphyrin appeared more polar compared to the starting porphyrin. The desired palladium porphyrins (11–13) were further purified by neutral alumina column chromatography, using 90% DCM/hexane as a solvent.
