    , Accepted 17th July 2018First published on 19th July 2018AbstractIn this work, a novel oligomer based on the introduction of alkylthio-thienylenevinylene thiophene (TVT-SR) side groups into benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as a central donor unit, BDT(TVT-SR)2, is developed and used as the donor material for all-small molecule OSCs (SM-OSCs) with IDIC as the acceptor. BDT(TVT-SR)2 exhibits red-shifted absorption, a down-shifted HOMO energy level and higher hole mobility in comparison with its corresponding molecule H11 with alkylthiothienyl side chains. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the SM-OSCs based on BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC with thermal annealing (TA) at 110 °C for 10 min reached 11.1%. This TA treatment improves the film morphology, charge transport properties and thus device performance of the SM-OSCs. Besides, these devices show good morphological stability and photo-stability.
1. Introduction
Thin-film organic solar cells (OSCs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture have attracted remarkable attention because they offer a very promising outlook for producing low-cost solar cells via solution approaches that can enable high throughput fabrication on flexible substrates.1–4 Normally, BHJ OSCs are composed of a blend active layer of a p-type organic semiconductor (p-OS) as the donor and an n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as the acceptor sandwiched between the anode and cathode.5,6 By using conventional fullerene derivatives as acceptors, the rational design of both polymer and small molecule p-OS donor structures has significantly improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the OSCs, now exceeding 11%.7–10 Despite the success of fullerene acceptors, they still suffer from several limitations, such as limited visible light absorption, high cost, poor thermal stability of photovoltaic layers and so on.11,12 Therefore, recent research efforts have been devoted to exploring and understanding alternative n-OS acceptors (including n-type conjugated polymers and small molecules) to replace fullerene derivatives.2,13–17
Non-fullerene n-OS small molecule acceptors, compared to fullerene derivatives, have some remarkable advantages, including a well-defined molecular structure, good batch reproducibility, easy tuning of film absorption and electronic energy levels, high morphological stability and potentially low cost.16,18 Recently, the PCEs of non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) with small molecule acceptors have rapidly increased to over 13%.2 However, the PCEs of “all small molecule” OSCs (SM-OSCs), which consist of a p-OS molecule donor and an n-OS molecule acceptor, are still lower than those of their polymeric counterparts, and only a few papers reported PCEs over 9%.13,19,20 This is probably due to the unsuitable molecular energy levels, low dielectric permittivity, low efficiency of exciton dissociation at the heterojunction interface, relatively large non-radiative recombination, etc.12,19–23
In order to realize higher photovoltaic performance in SM-OSCs, there are two main factors to be considered. On one hand, the intrinsic properties of small molecule donors, including their absorption spectra, molecular energy levels, hole mobilities, and relevant morphologies, must be carefully tuned.3,9,24 On the other hand, n-OS small molecules generally showed relatively low electron mobility and electron affinity.25 Thus, number of n-OS acceptors should be increased to meet requirements of high electron mobility and affinity, while overcoming the sub-optimal phase separation properties caused by improper miscibility and intermolecular interactions between the donors and acceptors in the films.23,26 Considerable efforts should be dedicated to the design of numerous p-OS and n-OS small molecules for extending the pool of small molecules and for the development of novel processing strategies facilitating a well-defined morphological evolution for high performance SM-OSCs.
Polymer donors composed of conjugated BDT units have been studied extensively in the past ten years and have boosted the PCE of polymer solar cells (PSCs) to over 10%.14,27 Applying 2D-conjugated benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units (e.g. alkylthienyl- and alkylthio-thienyl-substituted BDT units) and various chemical moieties (such as para-alkyl-phenyl, meta-alkoxyl-phenyl, and 2-alkyl-3-fluoro-thienyl) can effectively improve the material and device properties,28 resulting from the modulations of the absorption spectrum, molecular energy levels, backbone conformation, charge transport properties, etc. For instance, the alkylthio-thienylenevinylene thiophene (TVT-SR) side chain substituted polymer PBT-TVT, compared to PTB7 with a similar molecular backbone, not only improved the optical absorption properties, but also down-shifted the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and enhanced hole mobility, leading to an overall improvement of photovoltaic properties compared to PTB7 cells.29 Inspired by the successful development of 2D-conjugated BDT polymers, small molecules with different types of side chains have been developed extensively within the past five years.9,10,30–32 More recently, these types of small molecule donors with BDT as the central unit exhibited an excellent PCE of over 11%.9,10 In addition, it is apparent that the SM-OSC is more beneficial than the polymeric one, because the small molecule system is free from the molecular weight distribution and batch-to-batch issues inherent to the polymeric system.12,33,34 All these factors make small molecules strongly competitive materials for OSCs. Thus, designing new molecules by incorporating and/or modifying a BDT unit might result in further advancements in solution processed SM-OSCs.
In previous investigations,13,24,30,32 it has been found that a sulfur atom possesses weaker electron-donating ability than an oxygen atom, and alkylthio or alkylthio-thienyl-conjugated side chain based BDT small molecules exhibit better material and device properties. Thus, bearing in mind the engineering of TVT-SR in BDT-based polymers as mentioned above and our deep understanding of the positive effects of TVT-SR side chains, herein we tried to investigate the synergistic effect of TVT-SR side chains in small molecule donors on SM-OSCs. In this work, we explored a highly efficient SM-OSC consisting of a novel 2D-conjugated small molecule donor (denoted as BDT(TVT-SR)2) with TVT-SR-substituted BDT as the central unit, terthiophene end-capped with the electron-withdrawing group rhodanine as two arms and the state-of-the-art high performance small molecule acceptor IDIC (Fig. 1a). By using the balanced self-assembling behavior of the BDT(TVT-SR)2 donor, we successfully demonstrate an 11.1% PCE SM-OSC via thermal annealing treatment and also elucidate the rationale behind the enhanced efficiency.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic route for the small molecule donor BDT(TVT-SR)2 is described in Scheme S1† in the ESI†, and the detailed synthetic procedures are described in the Experimental section. To benefit the absorption spectrum and charge carrier transport, the conjugated side chain of (E)-2-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)-5-(2-(thiophene-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene (TVT-SR) was introduced onto the BDT unit. Monomer 1 was synthesized from the reaction with butyllithium and trimethyltin chloride.29 The preparation of BDT(TVT-SR)2, proved by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (see Fig. S1†), was carried out through Stille coupling reaction between monomer 1 and monomer 2.13 BDT(TVT-SR)2 exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), dichlorobenzene (DCB) and chloroform (CF). The thermal stability of the small molecule was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the plot is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), from which it can be seen that the decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss is about 350 °C under a N2 atmosphere. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (see Fig. S2†) reveals that BDT(TVT-SR)2 is a crystalline molecule with relatively high values of melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (ΔHm). Its crystal structure was restored after the first melting and subsequent cooling to room temperature. Compared to H11,13 BDT(TVT-SR)2 has a sharper endothermic peak at higher temperature with a larger value of melting enthalpy, which indicates its higher crystallinity. A comparison of Tm and ΔHm values of the compounds studied thus allows concluding that elongation of the conjugated side chains of the BDT unit leads to improved ordering in the film.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of BDT(TVT-SR)2 in solution and in the solid state are shown in Fig. 1b. The absorption maximum (λmax) of BDT(TVT-SR)2 in solution was at 519 nm with an extinction coefficient (ε) of 8.16 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Table S1† and Fig. S4a†), which is slightly higher than that of the alkylthienyl-substituted small molecule (H11, 7.81 × 104 M−1 cm−1). In comparison to its absorption in solution, the absorption bands of BDT(TVT-SR)2 as a film were red-shifted significantly, extending the absorption edge from 606 nm in solution to 680 nm in the solid state, corresponding to a bandgap (Eg) of 1.82 eV. This indicates a better packing due to the strong interchain π–π interaction of molecular backbones in the bulk.19,30 In order to better understand the effect of TVT-SR substitution on the electronic properties, we compared the absorption spectra of BDT(TVT-SR)2 with those of the alkylthienyl-substituted H11 (see Fig. S4b†). Although the λmax of BDT(TVT-SR)2 and H11 is similar, the absorption bands are significantly broadened, and the absorption edge of BDT(TVT-SR)2 was red-shifted by approximately 12 nm with respect to H11 in the film states. It is possibly because the TVT-SR side groups in BDT(TVT-SR)2 not only increased the effective conjugation length to a greater extent than the alkylthienyl groups in H11, but also effectively achieved ordered intermolecular stacking via the introduction of alkylthio chains in the BDT-TVT unit.24 The absorption maximum at the shorter wavelength (ca. 400 nm) was attributed to the BDT units bearing conjugated TVT-SR side groups as well as the π–π* transition of conjugated backbones.29 As shown in the absorption spectra, this donor–acceptor pair has well-matched complementary absorption peaks that completely cover the broad wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. Furthermore, the absorption spectra of the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC blend films were significantly altered by thermal annealing, as shown in Fig. 1c. Compared to the as-cast film, the annealed film showed higher absorption peaks at 563 and 611 nm, indicating enhanced donor molecular ordering35 while the red-shifted absorption spectra with a more distinct shoulder at ca. 719 nm could be attributed to the crystalline IDIC by thermal annealing, thus suggesting the formation of donor–acceptor phase separation in the blend film.23,35
Energy level matching between the donor and acceptor materials is one of the most critical factors for obtaining high performance devices. The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of BDT(TVT-SR)2 were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) for investigating the effect of TVT-SR substitution on the electronic energy levels of 2D-conjugated molecules. From the experimental CV (see Fig. S5†), the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BDT(TVT-SR)2 are determined to be −5.33 eV and −3.18 eV, respectively (see Fig. 1d). The HOMO and LUMO of IDIC are located at −5.65 and −3.97 eV,13 respectively, suggesting that both the HOMO offset and LUMO offset between BDT(TVT-SR)2 and IDIC were sufficiently large. These results indicate that the donor–acceptor combination for solar cells is energetically suitable for efficient charge separation and carrier transport. The optical and electrochemical properties of BDT(TVT-SR)2 are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.†
To provide further insight into the fundamental aspects of the molecular architecture of BDT(TVT-SR)2, molecular simulations and optimized geometries of BDT(TVT-SR)2 and H11 were investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) basis set (Gaussian 09).36 To simplify the calculations, 2-ethylhexyl and 2-hexyldecyl groups were replaced by CH3 groups (see Fig. S6†). It can be seen that both BDT(TVT-SR)2 and H11 exhibit a linear backbone formation from the side view, suggesting that they have good planarity. In addition, the dihedral angle between the alkyl side chain and the BDT unit is 51.7° for BDT(TVT-SR)2, slightly smaller than 55.8° for H11. This difference, although quite small, might result in different molecular packings as observed by absorption spectroscopy and also in different device performances.31,37 The optimized molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals are illustrated in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† The LUMO orbitals of BDT(TVT-SR)2 and H11 are mainly located at the electron-withdrawing fluorobenzotriazole (FBTA) and ethylhexyl cyanoacetate acceptor units. In addition, for H11, the HOMO surface is well delocalized along its BDT donor backbone. However, the electron density distributions in the HOMO level of BDT(TVT-SR)2 are delocalized onto the side substituents (TVT-SR groups) in BDT units, indicating that the π electrons can be delocalized better in TVT-SR side groups which may be due to the relatively longer conjugation length of TVT-SR side groups. The theoretical calculation and molecular simulation with DFT reveal that strategically introducing the TVT-SR side chain in BDT(TVT-SR)2 slightly downshifts the molecular HOMO level (−5.11 eV) by 0.03 eV in comparison to the analogous molecule H11 (−5.08 eV).
The crystalline properties of BDT(TVT-SR)2 and H11 were further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (see Fig. S8†). Both BDT(TVT-SR)2 and H11 films exhibit diffractograms with diffraction peaks located at the same angles, suggestive of the identical crystal structure formed by both films. Thus, a hole-only device was fabricated, and the corresponding curves are provided in Fig. S9.† As expected, the BDT(TVT-SR)2 film exhibited a hole mobility of 6.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of H11 (ca. 3.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in this work and 1.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the reported work13). Therefore, the data obtained from XRD analysis and space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements illustrate that replacement of the alkylthienyl group by the functional TVT-SR group can induce a stronger molecular self-assembly ability and thus facilitate hole transport.
The photovoltaic properties of BDT(TVT-SR)2 in solution processed BHJ devices were evaluated by employing the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al. An optimal device was obtained by varying the blend ratios, thermal annealing conditions, active layer thicknesses and processing solvents. The details of the device optimization processes are provided in Fig. S10–S13,† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S2–S5.† The optimal D/A weight ratio was obtained as 2:1, and the device without any treatment shows a moderate PCE of 5.64% with a Voc of 1.01 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.22 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 54.63%. Different temperatures of the thermal annealing (TA) process were studied to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of the devices (see Table S2†). After thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, the optimized PCE increased to 11.10%, with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 15.92 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.15%, measured under 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G solar illumination. When the solar cells were subjected to annealing at even higher temperature, however, efficiencies were rather reduced (see Fig. S10†). Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells processed using high boiling point solvents (e.g. CB and ODCB, see Fig. S13† and Table S5†) is not better than that of the devices when using CF as the processing solvent. Compared to the H11:IDIC system (see Fig. 2a), the Voc of the optimized device based on BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC is similar. However, the slightly higher Jsc and FF values should be highlighted. The Jsc differences have been cross-checked with external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, as shown in Fig. 2b. The spectrum exhibits broad photocurrent generation in the 300–800 nm range that corresponds to the absorption spectrum of the blend films. Here BDT(TVT-SR)2 as the donor molecule contributes the main absorption in the short wavelength region, while IDIC contributes the intense absorption in the long wavelength region. Due to the effect of the BDT units bearing conjugated TVT-SR side groups on the absorption spectra of the blend (see Fig. S4b†), the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC device provided slightly higher EQE spectra in the range of 300–450 nm compared to the H11 system. In addition, the calculated Jsc values from the EQE spectrum are 10.23 mA cm−2 for the as-cast BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC device and 15.69 mA cm−2 for the TA-processed BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC device, respectively (see Table 1). Besides, compared to the H11 based devices, the BDT(TVT-SR)2 based devices exhibited a higher FF value, probably resulting from the fact that BDT(TVT-SR)2 may possess higher self-assembly propensity (Fig. S8†). In addition, Fig. S14† shows the AFM topography images of the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC and H11:IDIC blends in the devices, and the root mean square (RMS) roughnesses of the films are 3.43 nm and 3.45, respectively. The AFM image of the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC film exhibits larger interconnected regions and domains compared with the image of the H11:IDIC BHJ film, even though the differences between these two AFM images are not dramatic. Since surface AFM images cannot be directly correlated to the device performance, further analysis regarding physical mechanisms is required to understand the impact of the bulk microstructure on device performance as will be discussed below.

In order to further clarify the large difference of Jsc values and attain basic insight into the photocurrent generation and charge collection efficiency in un-annealed and annealed blend films, photocurrent density (Jph) versus the internal voltage (Vin) of the relevant devices are plotted in Fig. 2c. Jph is given by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Vin is defined as Vin = Vo − V, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage.38,39 As shown in Fig. 2c, a much smaller and ever increasing photocurrent with no saturation was seen for the as-cast device, illustrating that the charge extraction and collection efficiency is poor compared to that of the annealed device. In contrast, the Jph of the annealed device represents the efficiency of carrier generation, resulting in a higher Jsc and FF obtained for this device. Almost all of the free charge carriers with the un-annealed and annealed devices can be collected at a certain Vin value (≈4 V), where the internal field is strong enough to efficiently extract photogenerated charges. The Jph values at Vin = 4 V are about 13.65 mA cm−2 for the un-annealed device and 16.85 mA cm−2 for the annealed device, respectively. It's noted that a small portion of the large Jsc losses of the un-annealed device can be attributed to the poor optical absorption of the un-annealed blend. Thus, the major current loss may be attributed to the increased charge carrier recombination and poor carrier transport properties mainly resulting from an unfavorable blend morphology as discussed below.
The light intensity dependencies of device performances were studied to identify the charge recombination mechanisms in the devices.38 The light intensity dependence of the FF and Voc values of these two blends are plotted in Fig. S15.† The FF of the un-annealed device, compared to that of the annealed device, shows a larger variation at light intensities ranging from 100 to 1 mW cm−2. This indicates that the un-annealed device is space charge limited39 and could not ensure efficient charge carrier extraction. In addition, the power law dependence of Jsc upon I can be expressed as Jsc = β(I)α, where β is a constant and α is the exponential factor.38–40 As shown in Fig. 2d, the fitting slopes (α) in the devices were calculated to be 0.93 for the as-cast blend and 0.99 for the annealed blend. The low slope of the un-annealed device suggests that there is some bimolecular recombination in the device due to the less effective charge extraction. In contrast, bimolecular recombination was nearly suppressed in the annealed layer. Besides, relevant results were demonstrated in Vocversus light intensity curves in Fig. S15b.† The fitted curves of the un-annealed and annealed devices were estimated to have 1.29 and 1.04 kT/q dependencies on light intensity, suggesting that the trap assisted recombination was more involved in the former active layer.
These considerable changes in device characteristics according to the different process conditions were further investigated by the charge transport properties and BHJ morphologies. Here charge carrier mobilities were measured using the SCLC model to analyze the J–V characteristics of single carrier devices under dark conditions (see Fig. S16†). The hole only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag was fabricated for hole mobility measurements of the blended films, and the electron only device with a device architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layers/Ca/Ag was fabricated for electron mobility measurements. For the as-cast BHJ blend of BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC, the hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) are calculated to be 5.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 0.43, while after TA treatment the μh and μe values increased to 1.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In addition, the annealed film shows more balanced charge carrier mobilities with the improved μh/μe ratio of 0.76. These results correlate well with the increasing FF and Jph as well as the decreasing series resistance and bimolecular recombination. Besides, for the compared blend of H11:IDIC, the μh and μe are calculated to be 8.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 0.71. Thus, the charge carrier properties of the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC blend, compared to those of the H11:IDIC system, are more balanced. The carrier mobilities of the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC blend are slightly higher. This probably results from the unsuitable blend morphology as mentioned above.
To better understand the origin of the beneficial annealing effects, the morphological characteristics of the relevant samples were measured using lab-based X-ray diffraction (XRD), synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), AFM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Compared to the as-cast film, the annealed film shows enhanced absorption spectra within the visible region and red-shifted absorption spectra with a more distinct shoulder at ca. 718 nm, indicating enhanced donor and acceptor molecular ordering.41 The same trend holds for the EQE results (see Fig. 2b). AFM shows a smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.36 nm for the as-cast BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC blend film (see Fig. 3a). It can be seen that with TA treatment, the annealed film with a RMS roughness of 3.43 nm exhibited the enhanced crystalline domains (see Fig. 3b). Besides, the bulk morphologies of BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC blends without and with TA treatments were also studied by TEM (see Fig. S17†). The TA-treated film shows better developed bi-continuous interpenetrating networks with well-expressed domains, which should result in a high efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge transportation.42 In contrast, in the case of the as-cast film no discernible structure can be found. The crystallization behavior of the blend films without and with TA treatment was further characterized by lab-based XRD analysis (see Fig. S18†). The absence of a low-q peak in the as-cast film also implies that the thin film without annealing is highly amorphous. In contrast, a clear first order peak at q = 0.28 A−1 can be observed in the annealed blend film, suggesting that the lamellar structures of conjugated molecules were formed when annealing the as-cast film.

Besides, synchrotron-based GIWAXS was employed to probe the detailed molecular texture features of the blends with and without TA treatment. Fig. 3c–e show the 1D plots and 2D patterns of the GIWAXS measurements of the neat IDIC film and BDT(TVT-SR)2 film, and their blend films, respectively. The results (Fig. 3c and d) indicate that IDIC crystallites adopted a face-on orientation with respect to the substrate in the thin film, and BDT(TVT-SR)2 in contrast tends to form an edge-on orientation relative to the substrate as evidenced by the simultaneous appearance of the peaks of out-of-plane (OOP) (h00: laminar packing diffraction peaks) and in-plane (IP) directions. For the blend films optimized by the TA treatment, it was found that the BDT(TVT-SR)2 molecule adopted different arrangements after annealing resulting from the variation of the q value and the emergence of new peaks at q < 1 A−1, as well as the distinctively different orientation distribution. On the other hand, the crystallization of IDIC is largely suppressed in the blend after annealing, evidenced by the entire absence of the diffraction features specific to IDIC observed in the pure film. In addition, the initially edge-on oriented BDT(TVT-SR)2 turns into a random orientation in the thermally annealed films as indicated by the isotropic diffraction rings displayed in Fig. 3e. In short, all the behaviors are related to the higher crystalline characteristics of the thermally treated blend film, and the combination of the reduced edge-on orientation and the tight π–π-stacking of the molecular backbone is known to improve intermolecular charge transport and suppress the charge carrier recombination in the photovoltaic architecture,43 which eventually improves the photovoltaic performance.
In previous studies, we found that the molecular structure significantly influences the morphological stability as well as the device photo-stability on one hand.24 On the other hand, the device stability of high performance small molecule:fullerene systems generally suffered from persistent degradation under light or thermal stress.4 Thus, it is undoubtable that the stability of BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC and H11:IDIC solar cells should be tested for investigating the effects of molecular structure on photo-stability and thermal stability in the all H11:IDIC solar cells should be tested for investigating the effects of molecular structure on photo-stability and thermal stability in the all small molecule systems with the non-fullerene acceptor IDIC; normalized PCE results are shown in Fig. 4, with full device characteristics detailed in Fig. S19 and S20.† Under while light illumination, the average PCE of six H11:IDIC devices, decreased up to over 21% over 200 h under nitrogen. In contrast, the BDT(TVT-SR)2-based devices lost only 10% over the same period (Fig. 4a), indicating that the BDT(TVT-SR)2-based devices showed substantially less burn-in efficiency loss compared to the H11-based devices. While the more stable device performance in the BDT(TVT-SR)2-based system is contributed to the lower Jsc and FF losses. Under 80 °C thermal stress in the nitrogen atmosphere, the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC devices also showed substantially improved stability compared to the H11-based devices (Fig. 4b). Their performance decreased to 87% of the initial efficiency after annealing for 96 h while that of the H11 system decreased to only 51% of its initial PCE. Optical spectroscopy (Fig. S21†) and AFM (Fig. S22†) were further used to study the origin of the thermal instability. The surface morphologies of BDT(TVT-SR)2 and H11 blends show distinct but small changes during thermal annealing (2 h and 24 h). Compared to BDT(TVT-SR)2 based blends, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of H11 based blends was increased gradually with the increase of the annealing time. More significant evidence is the findings from optical spectroscopy. The higher changes of absorption spectra indicated that the H11 based blend morphologies gradually evolved toward a more crystalline/aggregated state compared to those of BDT(TVT-SR)2 based blends. The conjugated TVT-SR side chain played the determined role in reducing the thermally induced phase aggregation and enhanced the BHJ morphological stability. Here it should be recommended for more in-depth investigations to develop detailed molecular insight into the stability of SM-OSCs, including small molecule donor and acceptor materials.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we introduced alkylthio-thienylenevinylene thiophene (TVT-SR) conjugated side chains into a BDT-based A–D–A structured small molecule BDT(TVT-SR)2 for its application as a donor material in high performance SM-OSCs. The designed molecule possesses good solution processability, crystalline structure, broad absorption profile, suitable HOMO energy level and high hole mobility. Non-fullerene OSCs were fabricated with BDT(TVT-SR)2 as the donor and a narrow bandgap IDIC as the acceptor, and the PCE of the devices based on BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC (2:1, w/w) with TA treatment reached 11.1%. This high device performance is mainly due to a well-defined and phase separated microstructure in combination with high and balanced change transport properties. Apart from the promising device efficiency, BDT(TVT-SR)2 further exhibited enhanced thermal stability and photo-stability compared to the H11 system. Our results position BDT(TVT-SR)2 as a promising photovoltaic material meeting the requirements for production significantly better than alkylthiothienyl pendants.
