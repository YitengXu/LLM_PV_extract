    , Accepted 25th October 2016First published on 25th October 2016AbstractWe report a novel fluorene-based polyelectrolyte carrying hexafluorophosphate counterions to dope into PCBM as an electron transporting layer (ETL). Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells showed improved photovoltaic performance, including short-circuit current density, the fill factor, and power conversion efficiency, compared with the one using pure PCBM as an ETL.
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as the next-generation energy-harvesting technology due to their excellent intrinsic properties such as optically high absorption ability, long exciton diffusion lengths, and excellent conversion efficiency.1–3 Since the first report on solid-state PSCs employing methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% in 2012,4 tremendous improvement in PSCs has been achieved with efficiencies exceeding over 20% in the past few years.4–12 The conventional PSC structure with the oxide electrode/electron transporting layer (ETL)/perovskite/hole transporting layer (HTL)/anode configuration has widely been studied and evaluated.4–6,8,10–12 The selection of HTL materials includes spiro-OMeTAD and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), which are very expensive from commercial sources. Compact and/or mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) are usually used as ETLs for PSCs. A high-quality TiO2 layer with good crystallinity and carrier transporting properties essentially requires high-temperature processes,10,11 resulting in high power consumption and production cost that would hinder PSCs from commercializing in the future. Therefore, it is compulsory to seek an alternative fabrication process to reduce the manufacturing temperature and cost. Inverted planar heterojunction PSCs with the oxide electrode/HTL/perovskite/ETL/cathode structure are therefore proposed and implemented.7,9,13–19 First, a high-temperature fabricated TiO2 layer is no longer needed for inverted PSCs; it is possible to achieve the fabrication of PSCs on flexible plastic substrates via a low-temperature process. Second, the replacement of expensive materials spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is helpful to reduce the fabrication cost. Third, the solution coating process is applicable for the HTL, perovskite layer, and ETL, which is also beneficial to reducing the cost and shortening the manufacturing period.
Despite these advantages, the short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCE of inverted PSCs are commonly lower than the conventional ones. This phenomenon can be explained by the lower carrier mobility and conductivity of organic layers in the inverted PSCs compared with those oxide layers in the conventional ones. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is extensively used as an ETL in the inverted PSCs.13–19 The mobility and conductivity of the PCBM layer are reported to be 2.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.1 × 10−8 S cm−2,17,20 respectively, which are much lower than those of metal oxide materials.21,22 The hindrance of carrier transport and extraction, as well as increased interfacial recombination, is created and should be solved. On the other hand, one associated reason is the energy offset between the Fermi level of high work function metals (such as Ag and Au) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the organic material PCBM.15 Therefore, the enhancement of the electron transporting properties of PCBM is necessary for achieving a high performance of inverted planar PSCs. In recent years, several effective ways have been proposed to improve the performance of PCBM-containing devices such as solvent annealing,7,9 interface engineering,13 and doping techniques.17,18 Several specific materials, including an n-type derivative of perylene bisimide PDINO, graphdiyne (GD), and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (DMBI), have been proposed to be incorporated to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
In this research, we demonstrate a novel n-doped PCBM layer with optimized charge transport to improve the device performance of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs. An ionic polyfluorene derivative containing trimethylammonium hexafluorophosphate (PF6−) groups, namely P1-PF6, was doped into PCBM as an ETL. It is well known that polymers possess better film-forming properties compared with small molecular materials. There also exists Coulombic interaction between trimethylammonium cations and PCBM radical anions.15 Hence, the incorporation of P1-PF6 is expected to reduce the aggregation of PCBM and to improve the interfacial contact with the top electrode. Besides, the electron-withdrawing PF6− groups help to increase the electron transporting and extraction ability of PCBM. Both P1-PF6 and PCBM can be well dissolved in chloroform and deposited into a thin film by a spin-coating process. Inverted PSCs with the indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/pure or doped PCBM/Ag configuration were fabricated and evaluated. The device parameters including JSC, open-circuit voltage (VOC), the fill factor (FF), and PCE were collected and summarized. Miscellaneous techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), four-probe electrical measurements, and photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of P1-PF6 in doped PCBM films.
The chemical structure of P1-PF6 is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Three different amounts of P1-PF6, namely P1-PF6 (20), P1-PF6 (100), and P1-PF6 (180) (see the ESI†), were introduced into PCBM as ETLs. The device structure of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/pure or P1-PF6-doped PCBM/Ag configuration is shown in Fig. 1(b). The SEM cross-sectional image of the inverted PSC is shown in Fig. 1(c). The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS, perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, PCBM, and Ag electrodes are estimated to be 30, 250, 50, and 100 nm, respectively. It is noted that the thickness of the PCBM layer was controlled to be 50 nm, since a thicker PCBM layer would lead to higher series resistance and undesired recombination.19 Besides, large and intact perovskite crystals with submicron grain size were formed, which could suppress charge trapping and increase the mobility of the perovskite.7,14

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized devices using pure and P1-PF6-doped PCBM as ETLs are displayed in Fig. 2, and the detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The optimized device using pure PCBM exhibited a VOC of 1.02 V, a JSC of 15.68 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.7%, and a PCE of 10.67%, which is comparable with the previous report (PCE = 11.5%) based on a similar device structure.19 While using PCBM:P1-PF6 (20) as the ETL, the device performance was enhanced, especially JSC (16.93 mA cm−2) and PCE (11.56%). However, no significant change in VOC and FF was observed. The explanation for the device enhancement includes the modified conductivity of PCBM, reduced charge recombination, and flatter perovskite/PCBM surface, which will be discussed later. By doping more P1-PF6 into PCBM, the champion device with PCBM:P1-PF6 (100) as the ETL displayed even higher JSC, FF, and PCE values of 17.32 mA cm−2, 70.9%, and 12.55%, respectively. We believe that a higher content of P1-PF6 could help to increase the electron transporting properties of PCBM, to prohibit carrier recombination, and to reduce the roughness of the PCBM layer. However, the device based on PCBM:P1-PF6 (180) showed reduced performance compared with the other devices.

In order to examine the performance variation of PSCs, the device parameters from 14 devices were collected and the corresponding standard box plot is depicted (see the ESI,† Fig. S4). The device parameters were clearly improved by doping a small amount of P1-PF6 into PCBM, especially JSC improvement. Since no obvious change was observed in VOC (and some increase in the FF), the tremendous improvement in JSC is the main reason for the enhanced conversion efficiency of the inverted PSCs. This is the first report on the incorporation of conjugated polyelectrolytes into PCBM as the ETL to improve the photovoltaic properties of inverted PSCs. The J–V characteristics of all devices in the dark have also been measured (see the ESI,† Fig. S5). It is seen that the device based on PCBM:P1-PF6 (100) has the lowest dark current, indicative of the best charge extraction and effective suppression of recombination among the four devices. In contrast, the dark current of the device based on PCBM:P1-PF6 (180) early arose at 0.6 V, leading to higher carrier recombination and reduced photovoltaic properties. Besides, the device based on PCBM:P1-PF6 (100) shows the lowest dark current under the negative bias and higher rectification ratio that are responsible for the higher current output and fill factor. The J–V characteristics of the four devices with opposite scanning directions were also recorded (see the ESI,† Fig. S6). Our inverted devices show nearly hysteresis-free photocurrents at different scan directions and/or voltage sweep rates (see the ESI,† Fig. S7). The pure and P1-PF6-doped PCBM layers were further characterized by PL quenching, time-resolved PL decay experiments, conductivity measurements, UPS, and AFM techniques to realize the origin of JSC improvement.
To differentiate the extraction ability of excitons into free charges with pure and P1-PF6-doped PCBM, steady-state PL measurements of various perovskite/PCBM films were carried out and are shown in Fig. 3. The samples were prepared with the glass/perovskite/pure or P1-PF6-doped PCBM configuration. The thickness of the perovskite layer was controlled to be 250 ± 20 nm, which was consistent with the active layer used in PSCs. It is seen that the PL intensity of perovskite was largely decreased when coated with the PCBM layer compared to the pure perovskite film, indicative of the effective suppression of charge recombination. The inset in Fig. 3 demonstrates the enlarged PL spectra of perovskite covered with PCBM, PCBM:P1-PF6 (20), PCBM:P1-PF6 (100), and PCBM:P1-PF6 (180) films. The emission of perovskite was further prohibited when doping P1-PF6 into PCBM, implying that the charge transporting properties at the perovskite/doped PCBM interface was promoted. The PL emission of the perovskite/PCBM:P1-PF6 (100) film was almost quenched among all samples. Therefore, we can conclude that the devices with PCBM:P1-PF6 (100) have the highest photocurrent output, which is in good accordance with the J–V characteristics in Fig. 2. The time-resolved PL decay experiments were carried out to identify the lifetime of carriers in different samples (see the ESI,† Fig. S8). The pure perovskite sample exhibited a long carrier lifetime of 2.3 ns, while perovskite/PCBM possessed a shorter carrier lifetime of 1 ns. By blending P1-PF6 (20), P1-PF6 (100), and P1-PF6 (180) into PCBM, the carrier lifetime was determined to be 0.97, 0.83, and 1.32 ns, respectively. The result suggests that incorporating P1-PF6 (100) promotes the carrier transporting properties of the blended PCBM layer. Since the recombination of carriers was suppressed and charge transporting was modified by doping P1-PF6 into PCBM, the extraction and collection of carriers in the devices were expected, leading to higher JSC values of PSCs.

To investigate the change in the Fermi level (EF) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the pure and P1-PF6-doped PCBM layers, UPS measurements of the films were carried out. The work functions of the films are determined by subtracting the binding energy cutoffs in the high binding energy region (around 16 eV) from the He I photon energy (21.22 eV).18 From the UPS spectra in Fig. 4(a), the work function of pure PCBM is determined to be 5.04 eV, which is consistent with the previous literature.18 Furthermore, the corresponding work functions of the P1-PF6 (20) and P1-PF6 (100)-doped PCBM layers are decreased to 5.01 and 4.96 eV, respectively. It is known that the work function represents the energy difference between the EF and vacuum energy levels; hence, the decrease in work function brings the up-shift of the EF. With the up-shifted EF of PCBM by doping P1-PF6, the enhancement of electron transporting properties accompanied by an increase in current density in PSCs is expected. Furthermore, the up-shifted EF implies an increment in carrier concentration in PCBM. As for P1-PF6 (180), the work function of the corresponding blended PCBM layer is increased to 5.32 eV, which is unfavorable for electron transport. The binding energy cutoffs in the low binding energy region (around 1.2 eV) reveal the energy difference between the EF and the HOMO level. In other words, the HOMO levels of materials can be deduced. The UPS cutoffs in this energy region are quite similar (see the ESI,† Fig. S9), meaning that doping P1-PF6 into PCBM does not cause a significant change in the energy gap between the EF and the HOMO level. Combining the above UPS results, the whole energy level alignment of the PSC is constructed and depicted in Fig. 4(b). The changes in the EF and HOMO levels of pure and P1-PF6 (100)-doped PCBM are clearly indicated and smooth transport of carriers towards opposite directions are realized. To further understand the influence of P1-PF6 on the electron transporting properties of the PCBM film, the electrical conductivities of the pure and P1-PF6-doped PCBM films were measured by the four-point probe technique. The conductivity of the pure PCBM is 5.052 × 10−7 S cm−1 which is close to the previous report.15,20 By doping P1-PF6 (20) or P1-PF6 (100), the conductivity of the doped PCBM films is increased to 7.323 × 10−7 or 1.852 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. The increase in conductivity for the doped PCBM films can be attributed to those PF6− counterions on the side chain ends. With P1-PF6-doped PCBM as the ETL, the resulting PSCs have characteristics of lower overall series resistance. Besides, the conductivity of P1-PF6 (180)-doped PCBM is decreased to 8.583 × 10−8 S cm−1 due to excess incorporation of polymers.

Perovskite layers with low average roughness (Ra) values are essential for the high performance of PSCs. Apart from the enhancement in electron transport, the upper PCBM layer helps to smooth the perovskite surface and to lower the Ra value. A flat contact between the ETL and the top electrode is also important to achieve high device performance. The surface morphology of the perovskite layer with a Ra value of 10.5 nm in an area of 2 μm × 2 μm is investigated by AFM (see the ESI,† Fig. S10). To gain the uniformity of the perovskite films, pure or P1-PF6-doped PCBM layers were deposited and scanned. It is seen the Ra values are reduced to 5.04, 3.54, 2.61, and 1.39 nm for perovskite/PCBM, perovskite/PCBM:P1-PF6 (20), perovskite/PCBM:P1-PF6 (100), and perovskite/PCBM:P1-PF6 (180), respectively, revealing uniformity improvement of the perovskite by incorporating PCBM:P1-PF6 blends. The smooth surface brings better contact between the ETL and the Ag cathode, resulting in the decrease of overall series resistance.
In conclusion, a conjugated polyelectrolyte P1-PF6 was successfully incorporated into PCBM as an ETL to improve the photovoltaic performance of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs for the first time. The enhanced JSC and PCE were observed from the PCBM:P1-PF6-based devices compared with the un-doped one. The results from PL quenching, UPS, and conductivity measurements indicated that the introduction of P1-PF6 enhanced the electron transporting and charge extraction of the doped PCBM film. In brief, the introduction of an ionic polyfluorene derivative P1-PF6 provides an effective strategy for improving the performance of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs.
