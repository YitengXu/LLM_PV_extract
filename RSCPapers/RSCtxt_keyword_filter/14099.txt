Broader context
The synthesis of π-conjugated organic semiconductors is a cutting edge research area, where the main challenge is to enable organic opto-electronic devices with optimal performance. Most synthetic methodologies currently used to access these systems are demanding from both raw materials/chemical costs and environmental point of view and their large-scale production may present serious limitations. Therefore, the development of waste minimized and clean synthetic methodologies, where minimal amounts of reagents, green reaction media, and solid catalysts are used, is essential for the successful commercialization of opto-electronic devices. Since π-conjugated polymeric semiconductors are of prime importance in this field, this Review provides an overview of the synthetic approaches to these materials addressing several criteria relevant to green/sustainable chemistry.

Introduction
π-Conjugated polymers are attractive for the fabrication of diverse optoelectronic devices such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, light emitting diodes (OLEDs), thin-film transistors (OTFTs) as well as unipolar/complementary circuits, sensors and displays.1 These semiconducting polymers are not expected to overtake the performance level of the widely deployed inorganic semiconductors, but they hold the promise for cost-efficient thin-film processing, light-weight, (semi)-transparency and excellent mechanical flexibility.1,2 To date, most of the research efforts focused on the development of new organic semiconductor structures aiming at improving the device performance, such as maximizing field-effect mobility for TFTs, light emission/vertical conductivity in OLED/diodes, light absorption/transport of charge in OPVs with limited emphasis on the synthetic methodology employed and environmental impact associated with their synthesis. These problematics include toxicity of the synthetic reagents, catalysts, and byproducts to humans, animal and plants, electrical energy for their production, and transfer from laboratory to large scales.
π-Conjugated polymers have been synthesized mainly by traditional metal catalyzed step-growth polycondensation3 and chain growth polymerization reactions.4 Despite their great versatility, these reactions have drawbacks including the need for several steps to prepare the monomeric precursors, the instability of several organometallic reagents employed, difficulties in controlling the polymer architecture, and the formation of stoichiometric amounts of toxic by-products. In addition, device-quality organic semiconductors generally require extensive purification processes to remove undesired byproducts and metals.5 Therefore, the development of economically attractive and ecologically benign alternative reactions is highly desirable. In this regard, the application of principles of green chemistry for the development of waste-minimized and clean synthetic approaches to semiconductor synthesis is essential for the field of organic electronics.5b,6
Briefly, the “12 principles” for a greener chemical product or process were published by the Green Chemistry Institute in US7 and can be summarized as follows: (1) prevent waste; (2) design synthetic methods to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product (i.e. atom economy); (3) design less hazardous chemical synthesis; (4) design safer chemicals/products; (5) use safer solvents/auxiliaries; (6) increase energy efficiency; (7) use renewable raw materials/feedstocks; (8) avoid derivatization (e.g. protecting groups, temporary modification of physical/chemical processes), because it requires additional reagents and can generate waste; (9) use (selective) catalysts, not stoichiometric reagents; (10) design chemical products considering their degradation after use; (11) analyze in real-time to prevent pollution; and (12) minimize the potential for accidents, including releases, explosions, and fire.
Particularly, waste production should be reduced through the use of minimal amounts of reagents and by using easily recoverable/recyclable catalytic systems (e.g. heterogeneous catalysts) to simplify workup/purification procedures and reduce energy and production times.5,6 Particular attention should be directed towards solvents,5,6 which are a major input in the synthetic processes and typically comprise the largest fraction of the waste generated (∼90%) as well as a significant workplace hazards. For instance, highly polar solvents, i.e. N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), N,N′-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF), pyridine and chlorinated solvents, which are commonly used as media in condensation polymerization, increase air pollution and most of them are toxic/flammable. These solvents rank high in the list of harmful chemicals,8 because they are used in significant volumes, and often their volatility makes them difficult to handle. High-boiling point media are used to reduce workplace hazards in solution polymerization since these reactions can be carried out at elevated temperatures without excessive pressure buildup. However, a major drawback is related to the high energy cost of the solvent removal from the final products.
The present review article summarizes synthetic approaches to semiconducting polymers addressing several relevant criteria for green chemistry. Particularly, it focuses on poly(arylene)s (Fig. 1) because of the significant efforts devoted to their “sustainable” synthesis and their wide use for the fabrication of several opto-electronic devices including OTFTs and OPVs (Fig. 2).

 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of a conventional OPVcell and a bottom-gate top-contact OTFT structure. (A) In an OPV device the light passes through the transparent contact (typically indium tin oxide, ITO), and is absorbed in the active layer to generate hole–electron pairs (excitons), which dissociate into free charges at the donor and the acceptor interface. Holes and electrons flow in the donor and acceptor regions, respectively, and are collected at the electrodes, resulting in the generation of electrical power. Principal figures-of-merit include the power conversion efficiency (PCE), short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), defining, respectively, the ratio between the output device electrical energy vs. the input solar energy (Pin), the device current when no reverse bias is applied, the device voltage when no current flows through the cell, and the ratio between the maximum power device and Jsc × Voc, respectively. PCEs of photovoltaic cells are calculated using the following equation: PCE = FF × Voc × Jsc/Pin. (B) In an OTFT, the current flow between source (S) and drain (D) electrodes (Id) on application of a drain–source bias (VD) is modulated by the bias applied between gate (G) and source electrodes (VG). When Vg = 0 V, Id is minimal and the device is in the “off” state. When Vg ≠ 0 V is applied (VSG < 0 V for p-type transistors) the device turns “on” and charge carriers are accumulated at the semiconductor (SC)–dielectric interface, resulting in a gate-controlled Id. Principal OTFT figures-of-merit include field-effect mobility (μ), current on-to-off ratio (Ion:Ioff), threshold voltage (Vth) defining, respectively, the average charge carrier drift velocity, drain–source current ratio between “on” and “off” states, and the gate voltage at which the injected carriers are mobile. 
Specifically, in Section 1 we first introduce the Stille cross-coupling polycondensation reaction featuring relevant environmental issues9 related to the employment of this methodology. Although it is known that tin-based reactions are not green and will be difficult to be implemented for commercial product synthesis, the Stille-protocol is a prominent methodology to prepare polymer semiconductors10 since it is the only one which typically enables an excellent control over polymer molecular weight, polydispersity and regiochemistry. Furthermore, polymers synthesized following this route typically enable the best performing devices. Therefore, we have decided to include relevant examples of Stille polymerizations to provide the reader a very clear indication of the state-of-the art performance for several polymers as well as to share important contributions where attempts have been carried out to achieve certain polymers in a more sustainable (acceptable) manner. Thus, we provide representative examples of Stille-based methodologies where certain issues were addressed. Next, we give an overview of the green methodologies for metal-mediated polymerization reactions, i.e. Suzuki cross-coupling, and direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation. Section 2 refers to the progress made in establishing metal-free oxidative coupling protocols, with an emphasis on nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization. We do not intend to provide an exhaustive list of examples of such chemistries, but rather identify key developments in the field that seem particularly suitable for large-scale synthesis. Limitations and problems associated with some polymerization protocols in terms of material physical properties and performance in OTFT/OPV devices will also be illustrated and discussed.
Metal-mediated polymerization reactions
Stille cross-coupling
The most common methodology employed to synthesize π-conjugated polymers is the Stille condensation polymerization of dihalo-functionalized and bis(trialkylstannyl)-functionalized monomers, with the catalytic cycle reported in Fig. 3.10
 Fig. 3  Mechanism of the Stille cross-coupling reaction. 
Despite its broad scope and reliability, the Stille reaction has several drawbacks which may increase in severity when implemented on a large scale,9e.g. the need to lithiate the monomers to achieve their conversion to trialkylstannanes, the formation of tin-containing stoichiometric amounts of toxic by-products, and contamination of metal reactor walls by tin. In some cases, some instability of the organometallic reagents upon purification attempts may also be observed.
A recent, environmentally relevant advance in the Stille polymerization methodology is the application of microwave-assisted heating. Indeed, microwave irradiation is efficient in reducing the reaction times, which is desirable for the generation of high-molecular weight materials and, consequently, increases reaction yields while reducing the amount of byproducts.11
The first examples of semiconducting polyarylenes prepared by microwave-assisted Stille cross-coupling reactions were published by Scherf et al.12 and Tierney et al.13 Thus, in the Sherf contribution12 the synthesis of two liquid crystalline 9,9′-dialkylfluorene/oligothiophene alternating copolymers P1 and P2 and poly(1,5-dioctoxynaphthylene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl) P3 (Scheme 1) was reported. The reactions were carried out in degassed toluene under an argon atmosphere using the appropriate monomeric building blocks (i.e. bis(trimethylstannyl)bithiophene 1/9,9′-dialkyl-2,7-dibromofluorene 2 or 3) and Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. At the microwave power level of 300 W (9 min), polymer P1 was obtained with Mn = 7.8 kDa (PDI = 2.7), and anyway a partial decomposition of the soluble catalyst occurred, as indicated by a detectable deposition of palladium metal on the walls of the reaction vessel. After Soxhlet extraction with ethyl acetate to remove oligomers, Mn increased to 14.0 kDa (PDI = 1.6; 55% yield). Similar results were obtained for copolymer P2 (Mn = 15.4 kDa, PDI = 1.4, 52% yield after extraction). Note that the investigated solvent/catalytic system gave appreciable degrees of polymerization only when the reactor power levels were >170 W. The copolymers P1 and P2 obtained by conventional heating, i.e. 72 h under toluene reflux, exhibited slightly lower molecular weights (Mn = 12.3 kDa and Mn = 12.0 kDa, respectively) with very similar polydispersities (PDI = 1.6). The lower yields of the microwave-assisted reactions relative to those under conventional heating (55% vs. 83% and 52% vs. 72%, respectively) were attributed to the smaller reaction scale, which led to more significant losses during the workup procedure. Next, the results for the Stille cross-coupling between bis(trimethylstannyl)bithiophene 1 and the electron rich 1,5-dioctoxy-2,6 dibromonaphthalene 4 under both microwave-assisted and conventional heating protocols were compared. Note here that 1,5-dioctoxy-2,6 dibromonaphthalene 4 is less reactive relative to 9,9-dialkyl-2,7-dibromofluorenes 2 and 3 in the Stille coupling reaction. Interestingly, the use of microwave heating allowed copolymer P3 to be prepared with a markedly higher molecular weight (Mn = 13.7 kDa, PDI = 6.4 vs. Mn = 5.1 kDa, PDI = 2.8) as well as reaction yield (52% vs. 34%).
 Scheme 1 
Tiernay et al.13 investigated the microwave-assisted Stille coupling between 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl) thiophene 5 and 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dioctylbithiophene 6 to yield poly(3,3′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′-2′′-terthiophene) P4 (Scheme 2). Optimal conditions involved the use of the relatively inexpensive catalytic system Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 (1:2) as a palladium source, LiCl as an additive, microwave heating (200 °C, 10 min), and chlorobenzene as a medium. Note that P(o-tol)3 is an air- and light-sensitive ligand, thereby presenting serious issues for green chemistry and atom economy. Furthermore, while increasing the polymerization rate and, ultimately, P4 molecular weight, the presence of LiCl14 adds complexity to the reaction setup, which would be amplified on a large scale where multiphase reactions are more difficult to mix. A Mn as high as 16.8 kDa was obtained for P4 (PDI = 2.3). When polymer P4 was synthesized by a conventionally heated (132 °C) analogous polymerization reaction, a lower Mn was achieved after 24 h (Mn = 13.0 kDa) whereas there was no noticeable effect on the polydispersity index (PDI = 2.3). Organic field-effect transistors were fabricated using P4 prepared by the microwave-assisted Stille coupling protocol and field-effect mobilities (μ) ∼ 3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Ion/Ioff = 2 × 102) were achieved. Unfortunately, no comparison with P4 obtained under conventional conditions was reported in terms of device response.
 Scheme 2 
More recently, the microwave-assisted Stille coupling approach has proven to be successful in the preparation of a wider range of polyarylenes for high-performance organic electronic devices.15
For instance, Bazan et al.15i reported a straightforward, reproducible microwave-assisted synthetic methodology to two novel donor–acceptor copolymers, i.e. poly[(4,4′-didodecylcyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl], P5, poly[(4,4′-didodecyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl], P6, and the previously reported16,17 poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl], P7 (Scheme 3). The design rationale for P5 was to provide insights into the influence on the photovoltaic performance after replacing a branched (P7) for a linear side group. Copolymer P6 was synthesized to explore the isoelectronic substitution of silicon for carbon as the bithiophene bridge atom. Thus, the authors first explored conventional Stille cross-coupling polymerization between 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 7 and bis-stannylated cyclopentadithiophene (8 or 9) or silacyclopentadithiophene (10) derivatives, using Pd(Ph3)4 as the catalyst (5 mol%) and a 1:1 co-monomer molar ratio (∼14 mM concentration). These conditions were found to yield polymers with too low-molecular weights. For instance, by heating comonomers 2 and 4 in xylenes at 120 °C for 48 h, a maximum Mn value in the range 7–10 kDa was obtained for P6. Interestingly, when microwave heating was examined it was possible to obtain P6 with Mn = 14 kDa after 30 minutes of reaction. Furthermore, an increase in reactants' concentration (200 mM) resulted in a Mn enhancement up to 22 kDa. A stoichiometric adjustment was also examined to compensate for possible contamination of 10 by trace amounts of organometallic tin compounds which can hardly be fully removed. This led to P6 with Mn values of 34 kDa, 31 kDa and 18 kDa as the distannane equivalents increased from 1.00 to 1.15 (0.05 equivalent increments). Copolymers P5 and P7 prepared using an analogous procedure, exhibited Mn = 44 kDa and Mn = 34 kDa, respectively. The polydispersity indices for all polymers were found to be ∼2, and the reaction yields were greater than 80% after fractionation by Soxhlet extraction. Note that the previously reported P7 showed a comparable Mn value of 35 kDa (PDI = 1.3).
 Scheme 3 
Bulk heterojunction OPV cells based on copolymer P5 exhibited lower performance characterized by a Voc of 0.37 V, a Jsc of 15.5 mA cm−2, and a FF = 0.48 under simulated standard solar light (AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), giving a maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.7% (1:2 weight ratio with PC71BM). Copolymer P6 afforded a greater photovoltaic performance with a PCE of ∼ 6% (Voc = 0.57 V, Jsc = 17.5 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.61) from an analogous device configuration but with a different component ratio, i.e.P6:PC71BM = 1:1. The authors attributed the Voc difference between P5 and P6 to the difference in HOMO levels, −5.12 eV and −5.36 eV, respectively. A direct correlation was found between P6, Mn and device performance, thereby highlighting the influence of synthetic procedures. Indeed, going from Mn = 7 (conventional heating) to Mn = 14 to Mn = 34 kDa, a significant increase in Jsc from 4.2 to 17.3 mA cm−2, along with a large increase in FF from 0.35 to 0.61 was observed. These changes resulted in an increase in the PCE from 1.2 to ∼6%.
Suzuki polymerization
The Suzuki polymerization reaction of dihalo-terminated and bis(organoboron)-functionalized monomers18 is in some aspects sustainable, although it typically requires the presence of additives such as a base, water, and a phase transfer catalyst, which add significant complexity to the reaction setup. This is likely exacerbated at a large scale, where multiphase reactions are sometimes slower and more difficult to control. Fig. 4-top shows the catalytic cycle for this reaction. Furthermore, the stability of the boron-containing monomers may be an issue since commonly employed boronic acids tend to condense into trimeric cyclic anhydrides and, consequently, several synthetic protocols use an excess of boronic acid to ensure a complete conversion of the electrophilic component of the reaction.18 Furthermore, their purification on a large scale may be challenging as many of them are waxy solids. The use of boronates partially solves these problems, as pinacol or 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol boronate esters are monomers but they are expensive and their use lead to a marked decrease atom economy, which may make them less appealing. Finally, most of the synthetic approaches to boronic esters still requires a lithiation reaction of the precursor, and their purification on a large scale are often challenging.
 Fig. 4  Mechanism of the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. 
Recently, Chiechi, Hummelen and coworkers19 successfully addressed the latter two issues by using bis(pinacolate)diboron (BiPi) to generate in situ the active boronate species for Suzuki polymerization. Four dibromo-substituted thiophene-based monomers 11–14 (Scheme 4) were homo-polymerized by employing the relatively expensive 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenepalladium(II)dichloride dichloromethane complex (Pd(dppf)Cl2) catalyst (5 mol%), K3PO4 as the base (5 equiv.), a 1:1 monomer: bis(pinacolato)diboron molar ratio, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the reaction medium (110 °C, 24 h). It is important to remind here that the use of DMF, although the standard for Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, is clearly not compatible with the current drive towards more sustainable processes due to the issues listed previously.
 Scheme 4 
However, these conditions yielded copolymers P8–P11 from moderate to high yields (37–74%) with molecular weights up to Mn = 9.46 (Mw = 25.8) kDa and PDIs ranging from 1.80 to 2.86. Subsequently, the authors demonstrated that these polymers comprised chains that were terminated by only two different end-groups, i.e. Br and H, which was clearly in agreement with the use of the Suzuki homo-polymerization in place of the standard co-polymerization.20 Interestingly, monomers 11 and 12 gave predominantly H/H terminated chains, whereas 13 and 14 led to polymers having a higher fraction of Br/H and Br/Br end groups, respectively. These findings correlated with the proposed mechanism for the BiPi method, relying on two palladium-mediated catalytic cycles, i.e. Miyaura, which generated the active Br/B terminated monomer, and Suzuki, growing the polymer chain (Fig. 4).
The electron-rich thiophene moieties in monomers 11 and 12 decelerated the oxidative insertion of palladium in the rate-determining Suzuki cycle, thereby explaining the predominance of the H/H terminated polymer chains. On the other hand, the presence of a more electron-withdrawing fluorene moiety into monomer 13 accelerated the oxidative insertion step in the Suzuki reaction and balanced the two cycles, which favoured the formation of the Br/H end-capped polymer. Finally, when the monomer incorporated a thienothiophene moiety, which is also more electron-withdrawing than thiophene, as in 14, the termination of a growing chain by deboronation in the Suzuki cycle was also accelerated, and consequently the amount of polymer Br/Br end-groups increased. The authors also compared the BiPi method to the commonly used Stille co-polymerization.
The polymers P8–P11 were prepared using the appropriate dibromo-substituted and bis-(tri-n-alkylstannyl)-functionalized monomers in 1:1 wt/wt ratio, 5 mol% Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst, and toluene/DMF 3:1 v/v as the reaction medium, at reflux temperature (24 h). The average P8Mn and polydispersity were comparable to those achieved using the BiPi method (Mn = 5.87 kDa vs. 5.20 kDa; PDI = 1.61 vs. 1.84) whereas the yield was higher (90% vs. 77%). Despite the structural similarity to P8, polymer P9 was produced with a lower yield (30%), Mn (8.73 kDa) and PDI (1.85) than under the BiPi conditions (yield = 48%; Mn = 8.92 kDa; PDI = 2.56). Copolymer P10 was prepared in a similar yield of Suzuki polymerization (71% vs. 74%), but with a much lower Mn (3.97 vs. 9.46 kDa) and a similar PDI (2.20 vs. 2.73). This result was ascribed to the stronger electron-withdrawing nature of fluorenes compared to thiophenes, leading to an increased Suzuki turnover rate (vide supra). An opposite behavior was found for P11, which was obtained in higher yields compared to using BiPi (87 vs. 67%) and featured a nearly double Mn (10.09 vs. 5.72 kDa) as well as a narrower polydispersity (1.99 vs. 2.86). Notably, Mw was generally higher for the BiPi method, thereby indicating that the latter produced longer chains than the Stille cross-coupling approach. Indeed, the BiPi method involves a homo-polymerization, which does not suffer from chain terminating reactions as much as co-polymerizations. Importantly, this method avoid the synthesis of boron- or tin-containing monomers, thus enabling the preparation of copolymers P8–P11 in fewer steps than through the equivalent standard Suzuki or Stille reactions.
A promising advance in Suzuki methodology is the replacement of boronic acids/esters with trifluoroborates.22 Trifluoroborate salts may be easily accessed from the readily available and inexpensive starting materials i.e., they are chemically robust/highly tolerant functional groups stable in moisture/air as well as in chromatography, and often readily recrystallizable. Additionally, they possess a relatively low molecular weight and the byproducts from cross-coupling reactions would be relatively benign inorganic materials. However, the introduction of trifluoroborate requires both lithiation and fluorination,21 thereby adding a step to those required to synthesize conventional boronic acids/esters. Thus, recently Ober et al.22 reported the successful Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between dipotassium [2-(heptadecan-9-yl)-2H-benzotriazole]-4,7-bis(trifluoroborate) 15 and dibromobenzothiadiazole 16 to yield polymer P12 (Scheme 5) composed of all electron-accepting units. Initially, the polycondensation involved a 1:1 co-monomer molar ratio, Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalytic system, tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide as the base, and toluene/water as the reaction medium (90 °C, 2 h), and afforded a low molecular weight polymer P12 (Mn = 4.6 kDa). When LiOH·H2O was added, the reaction resulted in a Mn value for P12 as high as 120 kDa (PDI = 1.5), which was ascribed to LiOH superior ability in hydrolyzing the trifluoroborate to boronic acid.23 These findings suggested that dipotassium heteroaryl bis(trifluoroborate) can be used as a viable alternative to boronic acid/esters in the Suzuki polycondensation.
 Scheme 5 
Copolymer P13 (Mn = 29 kDa, PDI = 1.8) containing 20 mol% of a bithiophene unit was also synthesized under the same reaction conditions (Scheme 5). Both polymers P12 and P13 exhibit high decomposition temperatures (onset >400 °C), as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for P12 (−5.4 eV and −3.4 eV, respectively) and P13 (−5.0 eV and −3.15 eV, respectively) were measured from ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and optical absorption data. Solution-processed OFET devices based on both polymers showed ambipolar behaviour with hole mobilities of 4 × 10−5 to 7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and respectable electron mobilities up to 2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (P12) and 8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (P13) (Ion/Ioff ∼ 1 × 104 and ∼1 × 102, respectively).
Recent advances in the development of greener Suzuki cross-coupling protocols to semiconducting polymers include the use of microwave radiation.24
For instance, Farrell, and Sherf et al.24b reported the microwave-promoted Suzuki coupling between 2,5-dihexyl-1,4-phenylene diboronic acid 17 and 4,4′-didecyl-2′,5′-dibromoterephthalophenone 18 to yield the polymer P14 precursor to ladder-type p-phenylene P15 (Scheme 6). Optimal conditions involved the use of a 1:1 co-monomer molar ratio (60 mM concentration) and of a relatively inexpensive catalytic system Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (∼4%) in THF/4 M aq. Na2CO3 at a constant microwave power of 150 W (∼130 °C) for ∼9 minutes. Under these conditions, polyketone P14 with Mn = 12.6 kDa and a PDI of 1.8 was obtained in 61% yields. Notably, when compared to conventional synthesis (refluxing toluene/2 M aq. Na2CO3 for 1–3 days), the reaction time could be significantly reduced, although polymer molecular weights and yields were comparable. The authors also reported that by increasing the irradiating power (70 → 100 → 150 W) a corresponding progressive increase in the Mn values (3.7 → 4.2 → 12.6 kDa, respectively) was achieved.
 Scheme 6 
Within the same study 1,5-dioctoxy-2,6-bis(tetramethyldioxaborolato)naphthalene 19 was employed as the Suzuki reagent in the optimal conditions identified above. In this manner a new structurally related precursor P16 (Scheme 6) was obtained in a 60% yield (Mn = 14.2 kDa; PDI = 1.8). On the other hand, copolymer P16 obtained by conventional heating, i.e. 3 days under refluxing toluene/4 M aq. Na2CO3, exhibited a slightly lower molecular weight (Mn = 12.3 kDa), with very similar polydispersities (PDI = 1.7) but higher reaction yields (70%).
In a further study, Sherf et al.25 reported the microwave-assisted Suzuki coupling synthesis of the sterically hindered 1,5-naphthylene polyketone precursors to the polymers P17 and P18 in good yields (89% and 78%, respectively) and with a reasonable molecular weight (Mn = 13.6 and 9.0 kDa, respectively) as well as polydispersity index (PDI = 2.4 and 2.9, respectively) (Scheme 6). Satisfactory coupling reactions could be achieved employing the appropriate monomeric building blocks i.e.18/2,6-dialkyloxynaphthalene-1,5-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolate 20 or 21) in a 1:1 molar ratio and using Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (∼4%) as the catalyst. Microwave heating at 115 °C (300 W, 10 minutes) was realized under heterogeneous conditions by using powdered KOH (12 equiv.) as base in dry THF. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the polymer Mn values increased almost linearly with the quantity of base. The authors claimed that the interaction between the base and the microwaves resulted in the generation of hot-spots within the reaction mixture, the concentration of which increased as more KOH was added, and that this thermal effect accelerated the cross-coupling reaction. Interestingly, in this study, P17 and P18 were only attainable under microwave conditions.
Finally, very recently Ma et al.26 reported a simple, expeditious, energy saving microwave-assisted Suzuki polymerizationprotocol to poly(9,9′-dihexylfluorene) P19 (Scheme 7). Optimal conditions employed monomers 2,7-dibromo-9,9′-dihexylfluorene 22 and 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxoborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dihexylfluorene 23 in a 1:1 molar ratio, PdCl2(dppf) (1 mol%) as a catalyst, K3PO4 as the base (∼5 equiv.), and THF/water (3:1 v/v) as the reaction medium. At the pulsed microwave power level of 150 W (130 °C, 11 min), polymer P19 was prepared with Mw up to ∼40 kDa (PDI = 1.9; 68% yield). Further increasing the power level and/or reaction temperature/time led to the formation of some insoluble gel-like cross-linked polymers, which lowered the yield of soluble chains. Notably, the defect-free P19 polymer structure was achieved as indicated by in-depth FTIR, NMR, UV-visible, and fluorescence spectroscopy characterization methods. When polymer P19 was synthesized by a conventionally heated (80 °C) analogous protocol, a markedly lower molecular weight was achieved after 48 h (Mn = 13.24 kDa, PDI = 1.51) whereas there was no significant effect on the reaction yields (60.5%).
 Scheme 7 
The use of heterogenous catalysts may enable greener synthetic strategies to π-conjugated polymers via Suzuki cross-coupling.27 Indeed, by carrying out a reaction using an heterogeneous catalyst, purification of the desired reaction product can be simplified because of the facile recovery from the reaction mixture by filtration/centrifugation. In addition, in most cases the need for chromatography may be avoided for metal removal, thus reducing the operating costs. Importantly, the use of heterogeneous catalysts prevents metal contamination of the semiconductor which may substantially affect device performance5 (vide supra). Heterogeneous catalysts are also easier to handle, allowing us to avoid the formation of inorganic salts, and are recoverable/recyclable and safer to be stored/discarded.
H.-Y. Li, and H.-Z. Chen et al.27 reported for the first time the use of the low-cost, ligand free Pd/C catalyst for Suzuki coupling polymerization, obtaining very good results. Thus, N-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,7-(bis-4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′, 2′-dioxaboralan-2′-yi)-9H-carbazole 24 (Scheme 8) was copolymerized18 at 85 °C for 72 h with the diketopyrrolopyrrole-based bis-bromo monomers 25 and 26, respectively (1:1 molar ratio), using Pd/C as the catalyst (5 mol% Pd), K2CO3 as the base (3 equiv.), and THF/DMF/H2O (1:1:0.5 v/v) as the reaction medium. These conditions led to copolymers P20 and P21 in good yields (∼70%) and with molecular weights of Mn = 14.5 kDa (PDI = 1.5) and Mn = 13.0 kDa (PDI = 1.8), respectively, after Soxhlet extraction. Similarly to the heterogeneous Stille polymerization protocol (vide supra), the insoluble Pd/C catalyst was easily recovered after solvent extractions from the crude P20 and P21 polymers, but the activity of the recovered catalytic system decreased resulting in low molecular weights.
 Scheme 8 
For comparison, the two polymerization reactions in Scheme 8 were investigated under the same reaction conditions but using homogeneous Pd(PPh3)4. Interestingly, it was found that such a catalytic system afforded polymers P20 and P21 with a lower molecular weight (Mn = 12.0 kDa and Mn = 11.0 kDa, respectively) and yields (65% and 45%, respectively) compared to those obtained with Pd/C. Furthermore, a higher polydispersity (PDI = 2.0, PDI = 2.1, respectively) was also observed in the former case. Despite the use of the soluble Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst, atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed that both polymers P20 and P21 contained a Pd level of 3668 and 3350 ppm, respectively, whereas when the heterogeneous Pd/C was used, the Pd level was reduced to ∼100× (34 ppm and 56 ppm, respectively). In the same study,27 the effect of the residual palladium on the P20 charge OFET charge transport properties was also investigated. Thus, the optimal hole mobility of Pd/C catalyzed P21 (∼4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was found to be remarkably higher than that of the Pd(PPh3)4 counterpart (∼1.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).
Direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation
Transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions of (hetero)arene C–H bonds with aryl halides, i.e. direct (hetero)arylation (Scheme 9), have undergone a rapid development in very recent years, and is becoming a viable sustainable alternative to traditional cross-coupling polymerizations.28 This class of cross-coupling processes does not require the preparation of organometallic reagents and needs fewer reaction steps as well as can generate less waste. However, control of the regioselectivity of this reaction can be controlled only when a given (hetero)arene exhibits preferential C–H reactive positions.29 Thus, achieving regioselectivity for unbiased substrates would greatly broaden the scope of direct (hetero)arylation reactions.
 Scheme 9 
In 1999, Lemaire and coworkers30 first employed the direct arylation protocols, originally used only for small molecules, for the synthesis of semiconducting polymers.31 Thus, they prepared a series of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s P22 and P23 by polycondensation of the corresponding 2-halo-3-alkylthiophene derivatives 27 or 28, respectively (Scheme 10). The general procedure implied the use of Pd(OAc)2(5 mol%)/nBu4NBr (1 equiv.) as the catalytic system32 and K2CO3 (2.5 equiv.) as the base in DMF at 80 °C (48 h). Although the polymers were obtained in good yields (∼90%), they featured low molecular weights (Mn ∼ 2.4–3.0 kDa, PDI ∼ 1.5–2) and degrees of polymerization (DP ∼ 12–16). 1H-NMR magnetic resonance at 6.98 ppm, which is characteristic for the proton at C4-position of the thiophene rings, was used to evaluate the degree of head-to-tail P22 regioregularity. Although the presence of some additional signals in the aromatic region were observed, the authors stated that regioregular polymer chains were achieved. A regioregularity of ∼90% was reported for polymer P23. Furthermore, unsubstituted polythiophene P22a and poly(3-methylthiophene) P22b showed a mixture of iodo and hydrogen end-groups, whereas poly-(3-octylthiophene)s P22c and P23, as well as poly[3-(3-methyl-pentyl)thiophene] P22d showed a halo functionalization at one chain end.
 Scheme 10 
Recently Ozawa and co-workers33–35 successfully applied this strategy to the synthesis of a variety of conjugated polymers. For instance, the well-known head-to-tail poly(3-hexylthiophene)33 (P3HT, P24, Scheme 11) with a high molecular weight (Mn up to 30.6 kDa, PDI = 1.6) and high regioregularity (up to 98%) was prepared in quantitative yields (99%).
 Scheme 11 
Optimal direct arylation/polycondensation of 2-bromo-3-hexyl-thiophene 29 (2 M concentration) was carried out at 120 °C for 24 h employing Cs2CO3 (1 equiv.) as base, and the relatively expensive Herrmann's catalyst 30 was used to generate in situ a palladium catalyst (ca. 1 mol%) with a tertiary phosphine ligand, i.e. tris(o-Me2N)phosphine 31 (2 mol%), featuring a high coordination ability. Note here that the Herrmann's catalyst (30) converted only partially to a catalytically active species. However, this route is substantially more atom-economical than the conventional Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization to P3HT which produces a stoichiometric amount of MgBr2. To ensure the solubility of P3HT throughout the reaction, THF was chosen as the solvent instead of DMF or N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) which are the reaction media commonly used for palladium-catalyzed direct arylation. Interestingly, it was found that the head-to-tail regioregularity improved together with the molecular weight. MALDI-TOF analyses revealed that P3HT with a low molecular weight (i.e. Mn = 1.1 kDa) had chains with Br/Br and H/H end groups, in addition to those with the expected H/Br termini. The authors proposed that homocoupling reactions between C–H and C–H bonds and C–Br and C–Br bonds were operative to a considerable extent at the initial polymerization stage, whereas the cross-coupling reaction between C–Br and C–H bonds dominated at a later stage.
In a further contribution34 the same group reported the synthesis of aryl- end-capped poly(3-hexylthiophene)s Ar-P3HTs (Ar-P24, Scheme 12) via direct arylation, using different p-substituted bromobenzenes (ArBr) as capping agents.
 Scheme 12 
These reactions were carried out in THF (125 °C, 36 h) with 2-bromo-3-hexyl-thiophene 29 (1 M concentration) as the monomer and Cs2CO3 (1 equiv.) as the base. Complex [PdAr(μ-Br)(P(o-tolyl)3)]232 was employed as the palladium source (1 mol%), either in isolated form or easily generated in situ by the oxidative addition of ArBr to the relatively expensive Pd[P(o-tol)3]2. In addition, KOAc (1 equiv.) and the phosphine ligands 31 (2 mol%) were introduced into the catalytic system to ensure high efficiency of the reaction by avoiding the formation of oligomers and deposition of palladium black. Under these conditions, polymers with Mn ranging from 4.7 to 11.8 kDa (PDIs ∼ 1.7–2.5), up to 98% end-capping efficiency, and 99% of regioregularity were obtained in nearly quantitative yields. On the basis of the observed correlation between molecular weight/PDI and conversion of 2-bromo-3-hexyl-thiophene 29, a two-stage mechanism was suggested for the capped polymer formation. Until complete consumption of the monomer, the chain elongation of end-capped and non-capped P3HTs are competitive, and the molecular weight increases linearly with monomer conversion. After monomer consumption, the resulting capped and non-capped chains coupled to afford highly end-capped Ar-P3HTs featuring a higher molecular weights.
Ozawa and co-workers35a investigated also the direct arylation polycondensation between 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene (3) and 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene (33) to afford poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-phenylene)] (PDOF-TP, P25) (Scheme 13).
 Scheme 13 
Optimal conditions involved a 1:1 co-monomer molar ratio (0.5 M concentration) and THF as reaction medium (100 °C, 24 h). The use of the relatively expensive catalytic complex Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 (0.5 mol%) with the supporting ligand35 P(C6H4-o-OMe2)3 (2 mol%), together with pivalic acid36a (PivOH, 0.5 mol%) and Cs2CO3 (1.5 mol%) allowed the synthesis of P25 with an extremely high molecular weight number (Mn = 347.7 kDa, PDI = 2.83) in a nearly quantitative yield (96%). Note here that according to the reaction stoichiometry, a 1.5 mol% Cs2CO3 is necessary for trapping HBr generated during polycondensation, considering that 0.5 equiv. are converted to CsHCO3 and CsOPv owing to the use of PvOH. The UV-Vis spectrum of polymer P25 exhibited a strong absorption band at 345 nm. Furthermore, 1H- and 19F-NMR spectra indicated the presence of two different T end groups (Scheme 13), i.e. 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl and 2-methoxyphenyl moieties. This was attributed to an aryl group exchange between palladium and phosphorus atoms, which may occur in the catalytic polycondensation system.36b,c
Kanbara and coworkers37 reported the first Pd-catalyzed AA/BB type direct arylation polycondensation of 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene 33 with 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene 3 (or 3,6-dibromo-N-octadecylcarbazole 34) as monomers (Scheme 14). The optimized reaction was carried out in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol%), a phosphine ligand (PtBu2Me/HBF4, 10 mol%), and K2CO3 (2 equiv.) in N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMA) as the reaction medium (100 °C, 24 h). Under these conditions, polymer P25 (or P26) was obtained at a high molecular weight (Mn = 17.6–31.5 or 8.3 kDa; PDI = 2.68–3.45 or 1.7), with the maximum Mn value being achieved for the monomer concentration of 0.5 M. Interestingly, P25 molecular weight was ∼10× higher than that for the same polymer synthesized via the conventional Suzuki cross-coupling (Mn = 3.2 kDa) reaction.38 The reaction byproducts of these polycondensations (KBr, CO2, and H2O) were easily removed from the polymers. NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses indicated that P25 featured Br/Br terminals, whereas three Br-substituted carbazole terminals per copolymer chain were found for P26, thereby suggesting the presence of a cross-linked structure caused by the relatively high reactivity of carbazole C–H bonds. Indeed, direct arylation likely occurred at these C–H bonds as well as at the C–H bonds39 of monomer 33. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of copolymers P25 and P26 were recorded, both in solution and as thin-films. Notably, P25 in solution featured a maximum emission wavelength of 385 nm as well as a quantum yield of 66% at room temperature in air, which was a value higher than that for the polymer prepared via Suzuki coupling (55%). Note that DMA used in this reaction is a highly polar solvent, which is high in the list of harmful chemicals, being volatile and toxic/flammable. The solvent effect was also examined and, unfortunately, no polymeric product was obtained when using toluene or dichlorobenzene.
 Scheme 14 
In a subsequent work40 Kanbara and coworkers further investigated the direct arylation polycondensation of 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene 33 as the monomer by using 2,7-dibromo-N-octadecylcarbazole 35 and 2,8-dibromo-10,10-dioctyl-N-methylphenazasiline 36 as co-monomers (Scheme 14). Under the same conditions as those for the synthesis of P25 and P26, the polymerization reaction of 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene 33 with 35 gave an insoluble product (probably P27) which could not be further characterized. The authors claimed that the high reactivity of the C–H bonds at the 3- and 6-positions in the carbazole units were responsible for the cross-linking reactions. On the other hand, the polycondensation reaction of 2,8-dibromo-10,10-dioctyl-N-methylphenazasiline 36 provided a soluble polymer poly[(10,10-dioctyl-N-methylphenazasiline-2,8-diyil)-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-phenylene)], P28, in 88% yield (Mn = 12.5 kDa, PDI = 1.65). In the same study the polycondensation reaction between 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene 3 and 2,2′,3,3′,5,5′,6,6′-octafluorobiphenyl 37 under the above conditions afforded poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)-(2,2′,3,3′,5,5′,6,6′-octafluoro-4,4′-diphenylene)] (PDOF-OD, P29) with a high Mn (43.2 kDa) and 95% yield. NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses again indicated that branching structures were formed by a Pd-catalyzed oxidative C–H/C–H cross coupling side reaction between C–H bonds in the fluorene unit, likely promoted by the high reactivity of monomer 37.
The same group41 also reported the preparation of several related 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene-based alternating copolymers via direct arylation polycondensation. For instance, the direct arylation polycondensation of 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene 38 with 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene 3 using a 1:1 co-monomer molar ratio (0.30 M concentration), Pd(OAc)2 (2 mol%)/PCy-HBF4 (4 mol%) as the catalytic system, and K2CO3 (2.5 equiv.)/PvOH (30 mol%) in DMA (100 °C, 24 h) afforded a high-Mn polymer P30 (Mn = 36.1 kDa, PDI = 2.76) in good yields (82%) (Scheme 15). Importantly, by removing the phosphine ligand allowed the reduction of the reaction time (3 h) and led to good molecular weight Mn up to 31.8 kDa (PDI = 2.46) in high yields (91%). NMR analyses did not reveal the presence of any branched structures, thereby suggesting that a negligible direct arylation reaction occurred at the aromatic C–H bonds of the fluorene units. Note also that the methyl groups on the 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene monomer 38 allow us to avoid the side reactions at its β-positions. Furthermore, the reaction of 3,6-dibromo-N-octadecylcarbazole 34 as a monomer under the above phosphine-free conditions proceeded to give polymer P31 in 81% yield (Mn = 7.3 kDa, and PDI = 2.13). The extension of the reaction time up to 6 h increased the yields (99%) as well as the molecular weight of the polymer (Mn = 11.7 kDa, PDI = 1.93). However the polycondensation of 2,7-dibromo-N-octadecylcarbazole 35 afforded polymer P32 in low yields (47%), even though a very high Mn of 32.9 kDa (PDI = 5.36) was achieved.
 Scheme 15 
The authors attributed the low yields to the formation of cross-linking structures due to the high reactivity of the C–H bonds at the carbazole 3- and 6-positions (vide supra) promoting undesired side-reactions. Interestingly, when the reaction time was reduced to 1.5 h, the polymer P32 was obtained in a 96% yield (Mn = 26.0 kDa, PDI = 2.76), thereby indicating that the direct arylation of the C–H bonds in the 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene moiety proceeded preferentially over those at the C–H bonds of the carbazole moieties in the early stage of the reaction. In addition, the authors investigated the direct arylation polycondensation of 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene 38 as a monomer with 2,5-di-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-bis(4-bromophenyl)]pyrrolo[3,4-cpyrrole-1,4-dione] 39 or 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-ethylhexyl)-isoindigo 40. Under the same conditions employed for the synthesis of P30–P32, but with a different reactant concentrations (0.15 M), the reaction between 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene 38 and the dibromo-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative 39 afforded copolymer P33 with a Mn = 18.1 kDa (PDI = 2.35) in a 96% yield.
Copolymerization with brominated isoindigo derivative 40 resulted in copolymer P34 featuring Mn = 11.3 kDa and PDI = 2.76 (82%). Interestingly, NMR and MALDI-TOF analyses indicated that P33 exhibited a linear structure, with terminal C–H groups in the 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbithiophene moiety and terminal C–Br groups in the diketopyrrolopyrrole moiety. On the other hand, P34 featured a branched structure, likely resulting from the direct arylation side reaction at the C–H bonds in the isoindigo moiety. Bulk heterojunction OPV cells based on copolymers P33 and P34 exhibited poor performance characterized by a similar Voc of ∼1 V, Jsc in the range of ∼1.5–3 mA cm−2, and FF ∼ 30% under simulated standard solar light (AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), giving a maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.89% and 0.39%, respectively (1:2 weight ratio with PC61BM). The authors attributed the low short circuit current and fill factor to the methyl groups on the tetramethylthiophene moiety. Indeed, although preventing side reactions (vide supra), such bulky groups lead to a twisted polymer backbone, which was unfavorable for light absorption and charge carrier transport.
Very recently,42 Kanbara and coworkers reported the rhutenium (Ru)-catalyzed direct arylation of pyrrole derivatives (e.g., 41) with 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene 3 (Scheme 16) bearing a pyrimidinyl directing group on the nitrogen atom. Initial attempts involving43 the relatively expensive [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (5 mol%) as a catalytic system, K2CO3 (6 equiv.) as the base, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid (1-AdCOOH, 60 mol%) as an additive, and m-xylene as the reaction medium (120 °C, 48 h) afforded poly[(1-(2-pyrimidinyl)pyrrole-2,5-diyl)-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)] P35 with Mn = 10.4 kDa and PDI of 1.59 (76% yield). Replacing the additive for stronger pivalic acid (PivOH), while increasing the reaction temperature (140 °C), leading to higher molecular weights Mn (up to 19.8 kDa) and yields (86%). NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses demonstrated that the direct arylation proceeded selectively at the pyrrole α-positions and provided a well-defined polymer, with no formation of cross-linked structures. Next, the removal of the directing group from the pyrrole unit of polymer P35 was investigated. The steric hindrance of bulky substituents on aromatic repeating units might lead to limited π-conjugation along the main chain of the polymer (vide supra). Thus, the 2-pyrimidinyl group was cleaved by treating P35 with an excess KOH in NMP at 200 °C, to afford poly[(1-H-pyrrole-2,5-diyl)-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)] P36 in 82% yield. Importantly, GPC/1H NMR/MALDI-TOF-MASS data indicated minimal polymer decomposition and a nearly quantitative cleavage of the pyrimidinyl substituent. Furthermore, by comparing the optical properties it was evident that polymer P36 exhibited red shifted absorption maximum relative to P35, both in solution and in the solid state (Δλmax = 26 nm and 41 nm, respectively). This was ascribed to the enhanced coplanarity along the P36 main chain.
 Scheme 16 
Additional studies from the Kanbara group44 enabled the synthesis of bithiazole-based alternating copolymers. Thus, the direct arylation polycondensation between 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bithiazole 42 and 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene 3 using a 1:1 co-monomer molar ratio (∼0.3 M concentration), Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol%)/PCy3-HBF (10 mol%) as the catalytic system, PivOH (30 mol%) as an additive, K2CO3 (2.5 equiv.) as the base, and DMA as the reaction medium (100 °C, 3 h) afforded the rather high-molecular weight polymer P37 (Mn = 35 kDa, PDI = 1.74) in 83% yield (Scheme 17).44a
 Scheme 17 
Interestingly, a phosphine-free protocol employing a reduced catalyst load (2 mol%) yielded P37 with a molecular weight Mn up to 45.9 kDa (90%). In addition, the use of microwave heating reduces the reaction time to 30 minutes (Mn ∼ 48.0 kDa, 99% yield).45 NMR and MALDI-TOF analyses revealed minimal formation of branching structures. The UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of P37 were nearly identical to those of a similar polymer prepared via conventional Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction.46 Next, the 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bithiazole-based copolymers P38–P41 (Scheme 17) were synthesized from moderate to high yields (42–93%) under optimized conditions, by employing the appropriate dibromoarylene co-monomers. Generally good molecular weights Mn up to 35.9 kDa (PDI = 2.89) were obtained. In all cases (except for P41) the formation of cross-linking structures occurred due to side reactions at the C–H bonds of each arylene fragment (vide supra).
Kanbara and co-workers47 also focused on 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer 43 for the direct arylation polycondensation with 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dioctylfluorene 3 (Scheme 18). Thus, the authors synthesized poly[(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-2,5-diyl)-alt-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)] P42 (L-PEDOTF) in a 85% yield by employing a 1:1 co-monomer molar ratio (0.3 M concentration), Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst (2 mol%), 30 mol% of 1-adamantane carboxylic acid, 1.5 equiv. of K2CO3 as a base, and DMA as the reaction medium (100 °C, 6 h). Copolymer P42 exhibited a Mn as high as 39.0 kDa and a PDI of 2.24. Interestingly, when microwave heating was explored,47 it was possible to obtain P43 with Mn = 15 kDa after 30 minutes of reaction (98% yield). Changing the base to potassium pivalate (2.6 equiv.) while reducing the catalyst loading (1 mol%), the reaction temperature (80 °C), and the monomer concentration (0.1 M) a Mn = 45 kDa was obtained after only 5 minutes of reaction time, whereas 30 minutes were needed to afford a polymer P42 with a Mn value of 147 kDa (H-PEDOTF, 85%). Importantly, the MALDI-TOF data for P43 obtained under conventional heating (L-PEDOTF) revealed the presence of Br groups at the chain ends, due to an incomplete reaction, whereas the polymer synthesized using a microwave-assisted protocol did not contain terminal halogens, thereby indicating a highly efficient reaction. Importantly, this polymerization occurs without branching caused by side-reactions.
 Scheme 18 
Next, the authors47 compared direct arylation to the commonly used Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling co-polymerization (Scheme 18). To this end, polymer P44 (S-PEDOTF) was prepared (85% yield) using 2,5-dibromo-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene 44 and 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid bis(1,3-propanediol) ester 45 in a 1:1 wt/wt ratio, the X-Phos-containing system 46 (5 mol%) as the catalyst, K3PO4 (20 equiv.) as the base, and THF/water as the reaction medium, at 25 °C (48 h). The average S-PEDOTFMn and polydispersity PDI were 17.1 kDa and 2.08, respectively. Residual Br groups at the chain ends were observed by MALDI-TOF-MS measurements, similarly to P42 prepared via conventionally heated direct arylation (L-PEDOTF, vide supra). The absorption spectra, the optical band gap (∼2.5 eV), and the HOMO energy (∼−5.2 eV) of the polymers H-PEDOTF, L-PEDOTF, and S-PEDOTF were almost identical. To investigate the effect of different synthetic methods on the purity of the polymers P42–P44, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometric (ICP-AES) measurements were performed. Interestingly it was found that H-PEDOFT and L-PEDOFT, which were synthesized using 1 mol% of catalyst, contained ∼2000 ppm of palladium, whereas ∼2× the amount of palladium was observed in S-PEDOFT, for the preparation of which 5% mol of catalyst was employed. Furthermore, the latter contained 470 ppm of phosphorous, which originated from the phosphine ligand of the catalyst. All of these findings confirmed the importance of the synthetic method in terms of purity of the resulting polymer, along with the advantages of microwave heating.
Within the same study,47 the effect of the polymer purity on its charge transport properties was also investigated. Thus, organic field effect transistors were fabricated using P42–P44 as prepared by microwave and thermal direct arylation, as well as palladium catalyzed Suzuki protocols. The optimal hole mobility μh of H-PEDOFT (1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and Ion/Ioff ratio (∼104) was found to be slightly superior to that for L-PEDOFT (8.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼102), and remarkably higher than that for the S-PEDOFT counterpart (3.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼102) (Table 1). The authors claimed that the high polymer purity along with the high molecular weight of H-PEDOFT contributed to the good OFET performance. Similarly, bulk heterojunction OPV cells based on copolymer H-PEDOFT were the best performing, with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of ∼9.4 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.52 under simulated standard solar light (AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), giving a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.08% (1:4 weight ratio with PC71BM) (Table 2).

On the other hand, OPV cells based on L-PEDOFT/PC71BM and S-PEDOFT/PC71BM blends (1:4 wt/wt ratio) exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 2.55% (Voc = 0.78 V, Jsc ∼ 7.6 mA cm−2, FF = 0.42) and 0.48% (Voc ∼ 0.6 V, Jsc ∼ 2.6 mA cm−2, FF ∼ 0.3), respectively. Since the morphological variations of the BHJ layers were not extreme, (Fig. 5) thereby ruling out the influence of molecular weight, the authors mainly attributed the observed PCE difference within this polymer series to variation in impurities content. Indeed, it was demonstrated a significantly higher trap-assisted photogenerated carrier recombination in S-PEDOTF- as compared to L-PEDOTF- and H-PEDOFT- based OPVs.

A recent work from the Leclerc group48 investigated the direct arylation polycondensation reaction of a thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)-based polymers P45 (Scheme 19). Indeed, π-conjugated polymers containing TPD moieties are known to exhibit excellent performance both in solar cells (PCEs up to 7.3%) and field effect transistors (hole mobilities up to 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1).49 Note also that the imide group in TPD may act as an orienting/activating group for the C–H bonds at the 2- and 2′-positions.50
 Scheme 19 
Thus, the authors48 synthesized polymer P45 by employing 5-(2-hexyldecyl)-5H-thieno[3,4-c-pyrrole-4,6-dione 47/5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dioctyl-2,2′-bithiophene 48 co-monomers (1:1 molar ratio, 0.25 M), Herrmann's catalyst 30 as a palladium source (4%), tris(o-Me2N)phosphine 31 (8 mol%) as the ligand, Cs2CO3 (2 equiv.), and THF as the solvent (120 °C, 22 h) under pressure. These (optimal) conditions led to P45 with a high Mn (56 kDa, PDI = 2.6) as well as high yield (96%). For comparison, P45 was also prepared by Stille polymerization between 1,3-dibromo-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-5H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 49 and 4,4′-dioctyl-5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene 50 (1:1 molar ratio, ∼0.2 M),51 employing the 2 mol% [Pd2(dba)3] coupling catalyst, P(o-tol)3 (16 mol%) and chlorobenzene as the reaction medium (130 °C, 48 h). The copolymer P45 was obtained with a moderate molecular weight Mn = 9 kDa (PDI = 1.5, 71% yield), which was ascribed to the loss of some functional groups during the cross-coupling reaction (Fig. 6).

The two polymer samples were characterized by optical absorption, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and thin-film X-ray diffraction. The UV-Vis absorption spectra exhibited similar features, with an absorption maximum at 464 nm and 474 nm (CHCl3) for the Stille- and the direct arylation-polymerized P45, respectively. Their solid state UV-Vis absorption spectra featured a bandgap of ∼1.75 eV but the direct arylation-polymerized P45 exhibited a red-shifted (∼18 nm) absorption maximum, which was explained by the different molecular weights and/or solid-state morphology. 1H-NMR spectra were comparable to those reported for analogous polymers, only differing in the alkyl-side chain area. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed a slightly greater crystallinity as well as solid state stability for P45 obtained via the direct arylation polycondensation protocol, likely owing to its higher molecular weight. Finally, XRD diffraction patterns showed analogous features for both polymers, thereby indicating that they were similarly organized in the solid state.
Leclerc, Heeger and co-workers52 also prepared two related thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)-based copolymers P46 and P47via direct arylation polycondensation of 5-(9-heptadecanyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]-pyrrole-4,6-dione 51 with 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-didodecyl-2,2′-bithiophene 52 and 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-didodecyl-2,2′:5′,2′-terthiophene 53, respectively (∼93% yields). These reactions were carried out under the same conditions used for the synthesis of P45, to achieve a Mn as high as 50 kDa (PDI = 2) for copolymer P46 whereas P47 featured Mn = 41 kDa (PDI = 2.3). The photovoltaic properties of P46 (or P47)/PC71BM were investigated in a BHJ OPV structure consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P46 (or P47): PC71BM/TiOx/Al (Table 2). The P46-based devices demonstrated a short-circuit current density of 1.03 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.95 V, a FF of 0.38, and a PCE of 0.38% (1:1.5 weight ratio with PC71BM). When 3 vol% additive (i.e. 1-chloronaphthalene, CN) was used to process the photoactive layer, a PCE of 1.90% was achieved. The performance increase was attributed to improved thin-film P46/PC71BM film morphology, which led to enhanced Voc (0.90 V) and FF (0.42) values. On the other hand, OPVs based on P47 were found, by optimizing the donor:acceptor ratio (1:1 wt/wt), to show an outstanding PCE of ∼6% (Voc ∼ 0.9 V, Jsc ∼ 10.5 mA cm−2, and FF ∼ 0.6) for the time. The authors claimed that such a superior performance arose from the side-chain distance along the length of the conjugated backbone between P46 and P47 composed of bithiophene- and terthiophene-TPD repeat unit, respectively. Indeed, a wide side-chain gap was previously demonstrated to ensure conformational interdigitation, thereby enabling a better packing of the polymer main chains.53
In a subsequent contribution, the same group54 reported the dithienylselenophene–thienopyrrolodione copolymer P48 (Scheme 19) as an analogue of P47, where a selenium replaced the central ring sulphur atom of the terthiophene unit. The reaction conditions were modified by adding pivalic acid in the catalytic system. Thus, the coupling protocol involved 2,5-bis(4-dodecyl-5-bromothien-2-yl)selenophene 54 and 5-(9-heptadecanyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]-pyrrole-4,6-dione 51 as co-monomers (1:1 molar ratio, 0.2 M concentration), Hermann's catalyst as a palladium source (4 mol%), tris(2-methoxyphenyl)phosphine as the ligand (8 mol%), Cs2CO3 as the base (2.7 equiv.), and pivalic acid (30 mol%) in THF (120 °C, 22 h). The copolymer P48 was obtained in 94% yields with a Mn as high as 36.0 kDa (PDI = 1.97). Interestingly, BHJ solar cells fabricated using PC71BM as the electron acceptor (1:1 wt/wt) exhibited PCEs up to 5.80% (Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 10.74 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.62) when Clevious PVP was employed as the hole-transport interlayer. Note that processing additives did not seem to be beneficial in this blend system.
The high molecular weight TPD-based homopolymers P49a,b (Scheme 20) were also reported by Leclerc and co-workers.55 Note that previously reported TPD homopolymers were synthesized by Ulmann-56 or Yamamoto-type3b polycondensation with moderate Mns in the range of 2–5 kDa. The reactions were performed in THF (120 °C, 22 h) with 1-bromo-5-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 55 (∼0.2 M concentration) as the monomer, KOAc (1 equiv.) as the base, and employing Herrmann's catalyst (2 mol%) and tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine (8 mol%) as the ligand. Under these conditions, polymers with Mn ∼ 23 kDa (PDI = 1.5) were obtained in 75–85% yields.
 Scheme 20 
In the same study55 a series of so-called TPD-pseudohomopolymers, i.e. polymers composed of a TBD backbone with alternating linear and branched alkyl-substituents, were investigated. The idea was to combine sufficient solubility due to the branched alkyls and optimal packing in the solid state caused by the linear alkyls.
For instance, the regioregular polymers P50 and P51 (Scheme 20) featuring a 1/1 ratio of linear vs. branched chains were prepared by copolymerization of dibromo- and unsubstituted TPDs 56/57 and 58, respectively, by using the conditions reported for P49, except that 2 equiv. of KOAc were used. An average molecular weight number as high as 10 kDa was obtained for P50 (PDI = 1.7) whereas P51 exhibited a Mn = 8 kDa (PDI = 1.8).
Similarly, the reaction of dibromo-TPD dimer 59 bearing linear octyl moieties and 57 resulted in polymer P52 (Mn = 5 kDa, PDI = 1.6), with a 2/1 ratio of linear to branched alkyl chains.
Interestingly, the powder XRD measurements (Fig. 7) and UV-Vis absorption revealed a direct correlation between the linear/branched alkyl chain ratio and the polymer packing in the solid state.

The Leclerc group recently reported other interesting alternating copolymers57 consisting of a series of furo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione-based systems, where the sulfur atom in the heterocycle of TPD was replaced by an oxygen atom. For instance, direct arylation between 5-(octyl)furo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 60 and 2,6-dibromo-4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene 61 (Scheme 21) in a 1:1 molar ratio (0.2 M concentration) using Herrman's catalyst 30 (4 mol%), tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine (8 mol%), Cs2CO3 (2 mol%), and pivalic acid (30 mol%) in toluene (120 °C) afforded polymer P53 in a 78% yield (Mn = 18 kDa, PDI = 2.2). For comparison, the polymerizations in Scheme 21 were performed under conventional Stille conditions between equimolar amounts of 1,3-dibromo-5-octylfuro[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 62 and 2,6-bis-(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene 63 (20 mM) employing Pd2(dba)3 (2 mol%)/AsPh3 (8 mol%) as the catalytic system in toluene (110 °C, 72 h). Copolymer P53 was prepared with a markedly lower Mn (Mn = 11 kDa, PDI = 1.9) although in excellent reaction yields (95%).
 Scheme 21 
Both synthetic methods afforded P53 with a large band gap (∼1.9 eV) and the UV-Vis spectra both in solution and in the solid state were broad and similar.
Several copolymers P54 (Scheme 22) from 5-(octyl)furo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 60 with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole monomers (64–67) were also prepared using the same conditions used for the synthesis of P53, except employing 2.4 equiv. of Cs2CO3 and 40 mol% PivOH. Good average molecular weights in the range 12–16 kDa were achieved (PDIs = 1.3–2) with the maximum achieved for P54b. The polymers with methyl groups in the β-positions, i.e.P54a and P54b, featured red-shifted solid-state absorption maxima (λmax = 570 and λmax = 576, respectively) than those with dodecyl chains, i.e.P54c and P54d (λmax = 550 and λmax = 553, respectively). Note that the longest absorption maximum was observed for P54b, which had straight alkyl chains on the silicon atom, thereby suggesting a greater solid state ordering.
 Scheme 22 
Thermogravimetric analyses demonstrated that the family of P54 polymers are stable under nitrogen between 391–404 °C, with a lower stability for P54c. BHJ solar cells fabricated with the above polymers using PC71BM as the electron acceptor (1:2 wt/wt) exhibited power conversion efficiencies below 2%, with the largest measurable value for P54b (Voc = 0.76, Jsc = 7.8 mA cm−2, FF = 0.35) (Table 2). The poor results were attributed to the lack of planarity in the polymer backbone, which led to low Jsc values (Table 2).
Leclerc, Heeger and co-workers58 also explored direct arylation polycondensation to prepared-type copolymers P55 and P56 (Scheme 23) using brominated isoindigo derivative 68 and 5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 69 or 5,5′-dioctyl-1,1′-4H-bithieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,4′,6,6′(5H,5′H)-tetrone 70 as electron-withdrawing monomers, respectively.
 Scheme 23 
Under the synthetic conditions used for P45 (Scheme 19, vide supra), copolymer P55 with Mn = 24 kDa and a PDI of 2.2 was obtained in a 77% yield, whereas P56 (80% yield) featured a Mn value of 18 kDa (PDI = 2.2). Note that in the latter case tris(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine was replaced for tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate 71. The synthesis of P55 and P56 was also performed using standard Suzuki conditions between 6,6′-(N,N′-2-hexyldecyl)-pinacolatodiboronisoindigo 72 and 1,3-dibromo-5-octyl-5H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 56 (or dibromo-TPD dimer 59). Interestingly, only the catalytic system using Pd2dba3 with tri(o-tolyl)phosphine and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (toluene; 85 °C, 48 h) yielded some polymeric product P55 (Mn = 13 kDa, PDI = 1.3; 16% yield), but no copolymer P56 could be isolated. Furthermore, the Suzuki-/direct arylation-polymerized P55 as well as P56 exhibited similar thin-film UV-Vis spectra with absorption maxima located in the range of 611–618 nm, and optical band gaps of ∼1.7 eV. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of all polymers were relatively low, i.e. ∼−6.1 eV and ∼−4.1 eV, respectively, thereby suggesting they might be good acceptor semiconductors for all-polymer solar cells. Indeed, such energy levels are almost as low as PC61BM (∼−6.1 eV and ∼−4.3 eV, respectively). Finally, the authors investigated OFET properties of the direct arylation-polymerized P55 and P56, which exhibited electron mobilities (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) comparable to that of PC61BM (Table 1).
Leclerc and coworkers59 also attempted to use the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) monomer 73 as a dibromoarene coupling partner (Scheme 24). Indeed DPP is a well-studied electron-poor monomer that has been incorporated into a number of π-conjugated polymers exhibiting extremely high charge carrier mobilities, highly desirable features for organic electronics applications.1j–l Thus, polymers P57 and P58 were prepared by employing 5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione 69 and 5,5′-dioctyl-1,1′-4H-bithieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,4′,6,6′(5H,5′H)-tetrone 70 as co-monomers, respectively, under reaction conditions analogous to those for the synthesis of P53 (vide supra).
 Scheme 24 
Copolymers P57 and P58 (86–91% yields) reached Mn values of 21 kDa (PDI = 2.1) and 28 kDa (PDI = 3.0), respectively without evidence of cross-linking reactions. For comparison, the boronate DPP derivative 74 was copolymerized with dibrominated TPD 56 using previously published Suzuki cross-coupling conditions.60 Interestingly, P57 was obtained with a low Mn (Mn = 7 kDa) and a narrow polydispersity index, thereby suggesting that for this polymer direct arylation is more effective for achieving high molecular weights while reducing synthetic steps. Copolymers P57 and P58 were found to be stable up to 400 °C and exhibited a broad solid state absorption between 600–900 nm, resulting in low band gaps (1.31–1.38 eV). Preliminary OFET measurements indicated electron mobilities of ∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both polymers in agreement with their low-lying LUMO energies (<−4 eV).
In a further contribution the same group61 expanded this methodology to include the copolymerization of 2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole-based monomers 74 and 75 (Scheme 25) with different monomer units, i.e.61 (or 76) and 73, respectively. Copolymer P59 (50% yields) featured a Mn as high as 32.0 kDa (PDI = 3.4), which was comparable to that of the same polymer obtainedvia Stille coupling (98% yields)62 synthesized reacting trimethyltinderivative 63 with 4,6-dibromo-2-octylthieno-[4,6-d]thiazole 75 (∼25 mM) using Pd2(dba)3/AsPh3 in toluene/DMF (10:1 v/v) at 110 °C for 48 h. Copolymers P60 (41% yield) and P61 (60% yield) exhibited Mn of 8.0 (PDI = 1.8) and 17.0 kDa (PDI = 2.9), respectively. Importantly, for P60 the use of direct arylation was essential to achieve this polymer since no stable/pure tin or pinacol borane monomers could be prepared. Similarly, although copolymer P61 could have been synthesized via the Suzuki reaction since a pinacol borane derivative of monomer 76 was reported,63 the latter monomer was not easy to synthesize and purify.
 Scheme 25 
The solid state UV-Vis absorption spectra for the direct arylation- and Stille-polymerized P59 were comparable. In the case of P60, the solid-state UV-Vis spectrum showed a maximum absorption at 680 nm, whereas P61 exhibited a broad absorption in the 856–965 nm region corresponding to bandgaps of 1.72 (P59), 1.23 (P60), and 1.52 eV (P61).
In 2012, Scherf and coworkers64 and Horie and coworkers65 almost simultaneously reported the preparation of poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene 2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PCPDTBT, P62) by reacting 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene 77 with 4,7-dibromo-2,1-3 benzothiadiazole 7, independently (Scheme 26). The Scherf group64 optimized a ligand free direct arylation polycondensation scheme employing Pd(OAc)2 (4 mol%) and 1.5 equiv. of K2CO3 in DMA (110 °C, 24 h) without addition of any carboxylic acids. The copolymer P62 was obtained in 70% yields, with a Mn = 40.3 kDa (PDI = 3.48). Horie's optimal route65 differed in using N-methylpyrrolidone as the reaction medium (80 °C, 20 h), pivalic acid in the catalytic system (30 mol%), and an excess of K2CO3 (2.5 equiv.). The resulting polymer P62 (98% yields) featured a Mn of 37.7 kDa (PDI = 4.60), which increased to 71.7 kDa (PDI = 4.52) after Soxhlet extraction (70% yield). Interestingly, the average molecular weights of polymers from both direct arylation strategies surpassed those achieved by conventional Stille (Mn = 28 kDa, PDI = 1.5)66 or Suzuki polymerization methodologies (Mn = 15.3 kDa, PDI = 2.05).67 However, in both former cases, branched as well as cross-linked polymers formed, as indicated by 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF-Mass spectrometry analyses. BHJ solar cells with PC61(or71)BM as the acceptor component were fabricated with P62 as the donor synthesized by Horie and co-workers, using 1,8-octanedithiol as the processing additive. The highest PCEs were measured for the sample with the largest Mn (PCE up to 3.98%, Mn = 70 kDa), greater than the performance obtained for the Suzuki-coupled polymer67b (PCEs up to 3.74%) (Scheme 27).

 Scheme 27 
The Lee group68 used 4,7-bis(3,3′/4,4′-hexylthiophene-2-yl)benzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazoles 78 and 79 as building blocks to synthesize the low bandgap π-conjugated copolymer P63–P67 series (80–95% yields) via microwave-assisted direct arylation protocols using equimolar amounts of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) 44, bis-EDOT 80, and 2,3-dimethyl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine 81 (∼12 mM). The polymerization reaction was performed in DMF in the presence of KOAc (6 equiv.), Bu4NBr (2 equiv.), and a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2 (0.2 equiv.) under microwave heating (150 °C, ∼30 min). Good Mn values of 15.8–22.2 kDa were achieved (PDIs = 1.50–1.83) with the maximum value obtained for P63. Note that under thermal conditions (100 °C, 72 h) only oligomeric P63 could be prepared, with a maximum Mn = 3.9 kDa (PDI = 3.82). The authors claimed that 1H-NMR and UV-Vis spectral data of all the direct arylation-polymerized P63–P67 were identical to those of the corresponding polymers prepared via the Stille method (Table 2).
An interesting advance in direct heteroarylation methodology was recently reported by Koizumi and coworkers,69 who succeeded in preparing P3HT with a high molecular weight (Mn ∼ 16.3 kDa, PDI = 3.17) and high regioregularity (97%) by employing ligand-free heterogeneous catalysis. Optimal direct arylation/polycondensation of 2-bromo-3-hexyl-thiophene 29 was carried out at 120 °C for 24 h employing K2CO3 (2 equiv.) as the base, PivOH (1 equiv.), 10% Pd/C (2.5 mol% Pd) as the catalyst in NMP (Scheme 28). (90% yields). Notably, a clearly different polymerization behaviour was observed when P3HT was synthesized by using a homogeneous Pd(OAc)2 catalyst. The yield of P3HT was very low (10%) and a large amount of insoluble products (>55%) was obtained, as a consequence of the formation of networked structures.

Metal catalyst-free oxidative coupling reactions
Even though their importance and indispensability is unquestionable, the replacement of (transition) metal catalysts by organic surrogates may have great advantages for large-scale polymer preparation. This is readily rationalized by the relatively high costs, the contingent toxicity and the demanding removal of (transition) metals from final products, especially in the case of polymers with complex side chains.70 In addition, minimization of metal leaching into the final problem will be also beneficial for the quality and performance of the target device (see above). Consequently, the development of efficient (transition) metal-free protocols for materials synthesis represents an important field of research with remarkable growth over the last few years. Examples of these approaches include controlled radical polymerizations (CRP),71i.e. atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP), and ring opening polymerization (ROP). All the CRP methods rely on forming equilibria between active species (radicals) and various types of so-called dormant species.71 Radicals may be reversibly trapped in a deactivation/activation process according to Fig. 8A, or they can be involved in a “reversible transfer” degenerative exchange process (Fig. 8B).

Nitroxide-mediated radical polymerizations
With respect to π-conjugated polymers, the best results were obtained by using the NMRP-mediated approach. It is based on the reversible capture of the propagating species by nitroxides and formation of alkoxyamines, which are the dormant species in this process (Fig. 9). The nitroxide radical is designed to act as a persistent radical,71 so that instead of reacting with another nitroxide radical cross-couples (reversibly) with the growing species and generates the dormant species (Fig. 9).

Studer and coworkers72 recently reported the synthesis of polyfluorene P68via the nitroxide-mediated oxidative homopolymerization (Scheme 29). Optimal conditions involved the use of 7,7′-dimagnesated fluorene monomer 82 generated in situ from 7,7′-dibromo-9,9,9′,9′-tetraoctyl[2,2′]bifluorenyl 83 (∼0.1 M concentration) and butyllithium (Li–Br exchange reaction) followed by MgBr2·Et2O addition (Li–Mg transmetallation). The 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO) (2.4 equiv.) was employed as an oxidant, and ethyl ether as the reaction medium (reflux temperature, 5 h). Polymer P68 was obtained in a high yield (94%) and with a reasonable molecular weight (Mn = 9.7 kDa) as well as polydispersity index (PDI = 2.11). Notably, the hydroxylamine obtained as the TEMPO reduction product could be readily reoxidized to TEMPO by treatment with air,73 thereby making this method economically attractive. Optical absorption and emission data were congruent with those previously reported in the literature for the regioregular polyfluorene, thereby demonstrating that the formation of P68 took place selectively at the 2,7-positions. Interestingly, metal trace analysis carried out for Ni, Mn, Cu, Pd, and Co, revealed that polymer P68 prepared by the TEMPO method contained transition metal impurities in the range of 0.02 to 16 ppm, owing to the Mg used to prepare the Grignard monomer 82. On the other hand, polymer P68 prepared via a standard Ni-catalyzed Grignard metathesis (GRIM) procedure was found to contain transition metals in larger amounts (0.03–1200 ppm).

In a series of paper, Thelakkat and coworkers74,75 investigated the preparation of semiconducting perylene-bisimide (PB) polymers containing acrylates by direct NMRP. For instance, the authors recently reported on the synthesis of two novel liquid-crystalline semiconductorpolymers, i.e. poly(perylene diester benzimidazole acrylate) P69 and poly(perylene diester benzimidazole acrylate) P70 (Scheme 30), via the nitroxide-mediated radical homopolymerization. These reactions were carried out in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (∼120 °C, 50 h) with bis(2-ethylhexyl)perylene-3,4-(4-undecyloxyacrylic acid-1,2-benzimidazole)-9,10-dicarboxylate 84 (0.8 M concentration) or N-(dodecylacrylic acid)bis(2-ethylexyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyl-monoimide 85 (1.8 M concentration), respectively, as a themonomer, and employing 2,2,5-trimethyl-3-(1-phenylethoxy)-4-phenyl-3-azahexane as the unimolecular initiator ([monomer]:[86] = 100:1). Note also that these reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.1 equiv. of additional free N-tert-butyl-α-isopropyl-α-phenylnitroxide 87, to shift the equilibrium to the dormant species 86 and enhance control over the polymerization. These conditions led to polymers P69 and P70 in moderate yields (∼35%), with Mn = 9.4 kDa (PDI = 1.4) and 20.4 kDa (PDI = 1.7), respectively. The authors indicated that since a controlled radical polymerization method was used, the molecular weight distribution was rather broad, thereby indicating that termination reactions occurred. The higher molecular weight achieved for P70 compared to P69 was attributed to a better solubility of the former in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.
 Scheme 30 
Differential scanning calorimetry, polarized optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements of P69 and P70 demonstrated a liquid-crystalline order over a broad range of temperatures. The UV-Vis measurements in chlorobenzene solution revealed that the presence of the benzimidazole unit in P69 led to a significantly extended absorption in the visible range up to 670 nm compared to P70 (580 nm). Optical band gaps of 1.86 eV for P69 and 2.16 eV for P70 were determined from the absorption edges of the above absorption spectra in chlorobenzene solution. A spectral broadening for both polymers in thin-films compared to the solution spectra was observed, which indicated a change in the aggregation in the solid state. Next, HOMO/LUMO energy levels for P69 were −5.68 eV and −3.52 eV, respectively, whereas a HOMO of −5.39 eV and a LUMO of −3.53 eV were reported for P70, on the basis of cyclic voltammetry and optical absorption data. Finally, Space-Charge-Limited Currents (SCLC) measurements revealed that P69 is a n-type semiconductor with an electron mobility as high as 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas a p-type behaviour was observed for P70, which exhibited a hole mobility of 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V s−1.
Conclusions
In this review we summarized the major findings for the development of methodologies for the green synthesis of poly(arylenes), which are semiconducting systems of prime importance for the realization of unconventional (opto)electronic devices.
It is now clear that during the last three years, outstanding results in the field have been achieved. Several studies have addressed and elucidated problematic aspects when using conventional Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions for poly(arylene) preparation as well as the implications and benefits of employing alternative reaction conditions, solvents, and reactants. Particularly, direct arylation polycondensation schemes enable the preparation of a range of poly(arylenes) featuring characteristics/performance which may rival or exceed those of those achieved using conventional routes. For this approach, it remains a fundamental question, i.e. how to address selectivity as well as regioregularity issues for monomers lacking proper directing groups.
Tuning the reaction conditions in terms of temperature, catalyst loading and the use of bulky catalyst ligands enabled more accurate control of homocoupling, end-groups, residual metal and branching defects of polymers. Further efforts in these directions are certainly needed to achieve a more trustworthy and mature methodology. Among the possible routes, the proper design of catalysts and/or ligands appears to be the most promising strategy.
In this regard, the reader can also refer to a very recent highlight article by Thompson et al.29 where it nicely discusses the origin of the main chain defects of the polymer through direct (hetero)arylation, the dependence of polymer properties on these defects, and all available tools effective for their control.
For all the reviewed methods of polyarylene synthesis, future development should focus on further expanding the substrate scope, which will ultimately enable the access to the most efficient polymers for (opto)electronic devices, carefully optimizing the reaction conditions to gain a better control over the polymerization reaction, and obviously simplifying the reaction protocols in terms of elimination (or, at least, minimization) of expensive/toxic reagents. The ultimate aim of this review is to anticipate and stimulate a discussion for the need to efficiently synthesize organic semiconductors at a scale much greater than that used in the laboratories, and with minimal production of waste and toxic byproducts. Despite the impressive achievements in the field of poly(arylene) sustainable synthetic processes summarized in this review, to date there are no comprehensive reports focusing on the evaluation of their costs in terms of energy consumption, labour cost, waste disposal, also in comparison with conventional methods. Thus, it is essential to further develop the area in such a direction, as well as explore new synthetic approaches, for enabling the commercialization of π-conjugated polymer-based devices.

Broader context
The synthesis of π-conjugated organic semiconductors is a cutting edge research area, where the main challenge is to enable organic opto-electronic devices with optimal performance. Most synthetic methodologies currently used to access these systems are demanding from both raw materials/chemical costs and environmental point of view and their large-scale production may present serious limitations. Therefore, the development of waste minimized and clean synthetic methodologies, where minimal amounts of reagents, green reaction media, and solid catalysts are used, is essential for the successful commercialization of opto-electronic devices. Since π-conjugated polymeric semiconductors are of prime importance in this field, this Review provides an overview of the synthetic approaches to these materials addressing several criteria relevant to green/sustainable chemistry.


 	Fig. 1  Representative chemical structures of poly(arylene) semiconductors used for the fabrication of OPV and OTFT devices reported in the literature.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic representation of a conventional OPVcell and a bottom-gate top-contact OTFT structure. (A) In an OPV device the light passes through the transparent contact (typically indium tin oxide, ITO), and is absorbed in the active layer to generate hole–electron pairs (excitons), which dissociate into free charges at the donor and the acceptor interface. Holes and electrons flow in the donor and acceptor regions, respectively, and are collected at the electrodes, resulting in the generation of electrical power. Principal figures-of-merit include the power conversion efficiency (PCE), short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), defining, respectively, the ratio between the output device electrical energy vs. the input solar energy (Pin), the device current when no reverse bias is applied, the device voltage when no current flows through the cell, and the ratio between the maximum power device and Jsc × Voc, respectively. PCEs of photovoltaic cells are calculated using the following equation: PCE = FF × Voc × Jsc/Pin. (B) In an OTFT, the current flow between source (S) and drain (D) electrodes (Id) on application of a drain–source bias (VD) is modulated by the bias applied between gate (G) and source electrodes (VG). When Vg = 0 V, Id is minimal and the device is in the “off” state. When Vg ≠ 0 V is applied (VSG < 0 V for p-type transistors) the device turns “on” and charge carriers are accumulated at the semiconductor (SC)–dielectric interface, resulting in a gate-controlled Id. Principal OTFT figures-of-merit include field-effect mobility (μ), current on-to-off ratio (Ion:Ioff), threshold voltage (Vth) defining, respectively, the average charge carrier drift velocity, drain–source current ratio between “on” and “off” states, and the gate voltage at which the injected carriers are mobile.
