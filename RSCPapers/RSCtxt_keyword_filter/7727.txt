    , Accepted 6th December 2018First published on 6th December 2018AbstractA high-performance optoelectronic device requires efficient light harvesting and management in the electrodes. In this work, we report the integration of antireflective anatase TiO2 nanowire (TNW) arrays and CH3NH3PbI3 microcuboid (CMC) film into a new bilayer architecture. The highly porous and well-interconnected anatase TNW arrays showcase antireflective properties for enhanced light transmittance and provide a largely accessible surface area for anchoring the perovskite light absorber. The thick and compact CMC film enables efficient light absorption. Thus, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated with a hybrid TNW/CMC optoelectronic electrode achieved an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 20.1% under one sun illumination with a high Jsc of 23.2 mA cm−2, which can be attributed to the maximised light harvesting efficiency within the devices.
Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn enormous attention due to their advantages such as high efficiency, low-cost and low-temperature solution processability.1–6 Unprecedentedly rapid progress has been witnessed in power conversion efficiency (PCE), which increased from 3.8% to 23.3% (certified) over the past few years, making PSCs promising and attractive as the next-generation high-performance solar-to-electricity conversion technology.7–12 The broadband light absorption, high extinction coefficient, ambipolar transport properties and long electron–hole diffusion length of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite validate diverse device architectures, including planar, mesoscopic, mesosuperstructured or bilayer mesoporous/planar hybrid structures.1,2,13–16 In general, the optical and electrical properties of electron transporting layers (ETLs) can greatly affect the performance of PSCs. The mesoscopic PSCs commonly used TiO2 nanoparticle film as the ETL. Recently, there were some reports that demonstrated high-performance PSCs by using a Li or K doped TiO2 ETL.17,18 Though high-performance was achieved, the TiO2 nanoparticle is not the best ETL choice because of its shortfalls such as inferior light transmittance and scattering, poor perovskite infiltration and convoluted channels within the randomly packed nanoparticulate networks for inhibited light harvesting and charge collection.19 One-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures such as nanorods, nanofibers and nanotubes, which could facilitate electron transport and favour perovskite solution infiltration, have been widely investigated as ETLs for PSCs.20–25 Porous TNW thin films with interwoven wire-to-wire connection can effectively reduce its refractive index,26,27 which could improve light transmittance and thus minimize the reflection of the incident light. However, the utilization of antireflective TNW, which could help enhance the amount of incident light being absorbed by the perovskite layer and thus maximize light harvesting and boost cell performance, has not been investigated in the PSC field.
Optimisation of solution-based synthetic methods has led to fabrication of high-quality perovskite films.28–32 Among various solution-based routes, two-step sequential solution deposition, which started from initially spin-coated PbI2 films and was followed by the second MAI intercalation step to form CH3NH3PbI3, has shown promise for fabricating high-efficiency mesoscopic PSCs.2,31,33,34 On the one hand, the mesoporous metal oxide scaffold will confine the growth of perovskite crystals within the pores, which is beneficial to enlarge the interfacial contact between ETL and perovskite. On the other hand, a solid self-standing perovskite capping layer consisting of large grains would be formed on top of the perovskite-infiltrated mesoporous scaffold. The morphology and surface coverage of the perovskite capping layer also play crucial roles in controlling light harvesting and cell performance.14,35,36 The subsequent methylammonium iodide (MAI) intercalation step provides rich possibilities to control the perovskite morphology in an effective manner. It is desirable to expedite film crystallization and formation to acquire microstructure-sized grains with good surface coverage, aiming to achieve efficient light harvesting.
Herein, we present a facile hydrothermal approach for the preparation of 1D anatase TNW on FTO glass substrates. The oblique, highly porous and interconnected nanowire thin film grows directly onto the conductive FTO glass, which shows promising antireflective properties, leading to enhanced optical transparency (∼14% transmittance enhancement as compared to bare FTO glass). By optimizing the CBZ-assisted sequential deposition technique during the MAI intercalation step, CH3NH3PbI3 microcuboids (CMCs) on top of CH3NH3PbI3-infiltrated TNW substrates are prepared. Interestingly, the novel 3D electrode made of the antireflective TNW ETL and CMC capping layer forms a robust light utilization and harvesting network. The bottom TNW ETL with high optical transparency allows a higher fraction of incident light to enter into the perovskite light absorber, and the top CMC capping layer can effectively absorb the transmitted light through the active layer. A champion PCE of 20.1% has been achieved for the PSC fabricated using the porous antireflective TNW ETL and microstructured CMC film with large grains and good surface coverage.
Results and discussion
The 1D TNW structure on FTO glass was prepared via a facile one-step hydrothermal process at 190°C for 3 h using potassium titanium oxide oxalate dihydrate (PTO) as the precursor dissolved in Milli-Q water and diethylene glycol (DEG) (see the details in the Experimental section). Such a hydrothermal approach is advantageous for the fabrication of high-quality TNW structures on a TCO substrate with controlled structural, optical and electrical properties.37,38 We conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the TNW sample (Fig. S1†). The result indicates that the as-prepared NWs are mainly composed of Ti4+ and O2− species. According to our previous study, the TiO2 samples prepared in the PTO/H2O/DEG system are anatase TiO2, which is favourable to be used in solar cells.39–41Fig. 1a–d show the top-view SEM images of the TNW films on FTO glass prepared with different PTO amounts ranging from 0.050 to 0.125 g (the samples are denoted as TNW-PTO-0.050g, TNW-PTO-0.075g, TNW-PTO-0.100g and TNW-PTO-0.125g, respectively). The PTO amount strongly influences the growth rate of the TNW materials. Specifically, increasing the PTO amount leads to an accelerated nucleation rate of Ti species, which in turn benefits the growth of TNW in a faster manner. The surface topography of the TiO2 nanostructures has undergone some changes from a dense thorn-like crystal (0.050 g PTO, Fig. 1a) to porous nanowire films (0.075 g PTO, Fig. 1b). Elongated and slender nanowires are formed, featuring a highly porous and well-interconnected network when the PTO amount was further increased to 0.100 g (Fig. 1c). However, as the PTO amount was further increased to 0.125 g, a compact network of TNW with reduced porosity was observed (Fig. 1d). This is due to the over-growth of TiO2 with an excessive amount of the PTO precursor. Also, the film thickness of the TNW layer increased with increasing PTO amount, which could be controlled from 120 to 800 nm (see below discussion). The inset sketches in every SEM image show the difference of porosity and film thickness for each corresponding TNW sample.

The inset in each SEM image is the corresponding sketch of TNW with different film thicknesses and porosities; (e) optical transmittance spectra of the FTO/TNW electrodes and FTO glass; (f) optical transmittance enhancement of the different FTO/TNW electrodes as compared to the pristine FTO glass. 
All the TNW samples exhibited improved optical transmittance relative to the bare FTO glass (Fig. 1e). Fig. S2† shows the digital photos of the actual FTO glass and FTO/TNW (0.100 g PTO) electrodes. With increasing PTO amount, the optical transmittance initially increased and then slightly decreased. The TNW-PTO-0.100g sample has the highest optical transmittance as compared to other samples, which showcased a ∼14% enhancement at a wavelength of around 470 nm (Fig. 1f). Such a high optical transparency can be attributed to the intrinsic antireflective properties induced by the higher degree of porosity and lower refractive index of the TNW-PTO-0.100g sample.26 In this case, there are plenty of cavities formed throughout the network of cross-linked and interwoven nanowires, which would allow more light to pass through this layer due to the refractive index match between the porous nanowire film and air.42 Moreover, the antireflective properties of the as-prepared nanowire arrays were further confirmed by their decreased light scattering characteristics as shown in Fig. S3.† Such 1D semiconducting TNW thin films showcase multiple functions, such as a porous framework for easy infiltration of the light absorber, antireflective properties for enhanced light harvesting (light transmittance, trapping and adsorption) and salient electron transport characteristics for improved charge collection, which make TNW thin films promising for thin film optoelectronic devices, especially for state-of-the-art PSCs.
The porous TNW films allow for sufficient infiltration of the CH3NH3PbI3 light absorber into their open spaces and pores via a sequential deposition technique. For the mesoporous scaffold, the perovskite forms not only within the confined spaces of the pores, but also on top of the scaffold as an additional capping layer. It is shown that the grain size of the perovskite capping layer can be controlled by varying the MAI concentration and/or soaking/dipping time.34 Such synthetic control was based on the change of nuclei densities or the degree of MAI intercalation. It is well-known that the anti-solvent of perovskite such as CBZ introduced during fabrication was able to facilitate crystallisation of the perovskite thus forming large grains with full surface coverage.28 In this study, CBZ has been incorporated into the MAI/IPA solution (volume ratio of IPA:CBZ is 2:1) during the intercalation step, and the influence of the IPA/CBZ volume ratio on the perovskite film morphology will be discussed later. Fig. 2a, b and S4† show the top-view SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer formed on different TNW films. Fig. S5† shows the cross-sectional SEM images of the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3-deposited TNW electrodes. The thickness of the TNW films and perovskite capping layers, and the grain size distributions of the perovskite capping layer are summarised in Table S1.† After sequential deposition of PbI2 and CH3NH3I, a layer of the perovskite capping layer consisting of CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids would form on top of the TNW structure. We found that the grain sizes and thicknesses of the CH3NH3PbI3 capping layers are proportional to the porosity and film thickness of the bottom TNW scaffolds. For the shortest and dense TNW scaffolds (0.050 g PTO, ∼120 nm in thickness), the smallest perovskite cuboids of 160–420 nm in size and ∼400 nm in film thickness were formed and nearly covered the entire top area (Fig. 2a and Table S1†). For the long and porous TNW (0.100 g PTO, ∼620 nm in thickness) scaffold, the perovskite capping layers are composed of large cuboids with size up to ∼1 μm and film thickness up to ∼600 nm (Fig. 2b and Table S1†). Note that such micrometer-sized cuboids can be advantageous with less grain boundaries and thus less recombination trapping sites. Fig. 2c and d illustrate the different formation behaviours of perovskite cuboids on top of the short and dense TNW or long and porous TNW scaffold, respectively. It is worth noting that the long and porous TNW scaffold with large open spaces is beneficial to induce the growth of large perovskite cuboids on top of the TNW films. This is because the thin PbI2 capping layer can only generate less nuclei sites for subsequent MAI reaction and conversion, thus leading to the formation of large crystals.19,43 Fig. S6† shows that the porous TNW scaffolds with more accessible nucleation sites can be efficiently infiltrated and filled with photoactive perovskite materials, resulting in better TNW/CH3NH3PbI3 interfacial contact, which is beneficial to the charge collection from the perovskite to the TNW.

We fabricated PSCs by capping the FTO/TNW/CH3NH3PbI3 electrodes with spiro-MeOTAD hole transport layers and depositing ∼80 nm Au as the back contact, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b shows the typical photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs prepared using different TNW electrodes under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. In particular, the PCE was improved from 15.6% to 17.7% when the TNW film thickness was increased from 120 nm (TNW-PTO-0.050g) to 620 nm (TNW-PTO-0.100g). A deterioration of Voc and FF has been observed for the PSC based on the longest TNW film (∼800 nm for TNW-PTO-0.125g), leading to a decreased PCE of 15.7%. In particular, the PCE enhancement for the device based on TNW-PTO-0.100g is largely determined by the significant increase of Jsc associated with increased TNW length, which increased from 20.5 mA cm−2 for the devices assembled with ∼120 nm TNW to 23.0 mA cm−2 for the ∼620 nm TNW based device. The IPCE spectrum in Fig. 3c for all four samples effectively covers the entire visible region (400–800 nm) with an onset value of around 800 nm, which is consistent with the reported optical bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 (Eg = 1.55 eV).44 The relatively flat spectral profile and a high maximum IPCE of over 90% are indicative of superior light harvesting ability for devices constructed using the TNW-PTO-0.100g sample, which can be explained by the following aspects. First, the antireflective TNW-PTO-0.100g sample exhibits the highest optical transparency (Fig. 1e and f), which allows an increased fraction of incident light to enter into the photoactive layer.17 Secondly, the long length and high porosity of TNW would guarantee the high loading amount of CH3NH3PbI3 and thus afford higher light absorption efficiency.18,45 Thirdly, the thick CMC capping layer (∼600 nm in thickness), coupled with the bottom antireflective TNW layer could effectively utilize and absorb the light (Fig. S7†). For the electrode consisting of short and dense TNW and small perovskite cuboids, some portion of incident light will scatter out at the FTO/TNW interface, and some portion of light will be transmitted through the perovskite thin film (∼400 nm in thickness), thus leading to inferior light harvesting efficiency and low Jsc (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3e schematically illustrates the improved light utilization and capturing capability of the 3D electrodes consisting of both the antireflective TNW and thick CMC layers with larger perovskite cuboids, which could greatly increase the light harvesting efficiency, and therefore generate higher Jsc.38,46 In addition, the fill factor (FF) also increases from 0.69 to 0.74 when the TNW length increases from 120 to 620 nm. We believe that the increased FF is due to the decreased interfacial contact resistance between FTO and TNW induced by better surface coverage of nanowires prepared with a higher amount of PTO precursor41 and also the better interfacial contact between TNW and perovskite for reduced charge-transport resistance.47

As expected, gradual Voc reduction has been observed along with the increased TNW length. Starting from 1.10 V for the ∼120 nm TNW (TNW-PTO-0.050g) based device, the Voc decreased to 1.02 V for 800 nm TNW (TNW-PTO-0.125g) based cells, which might be attributed to the thicker ETL with a higher surface area which would provide additional sites for undesirable carrier recombination and therefore result in lower Voc.20 This is also supported by the dark current measurements (Fig. S8†). Compared with ∼120 nm TNW (TNW-PTO-0.050g) based devices, the onsets of the dark currents of the long TNW counterparts are shifted to a lower bias voltage, indicating more serious charge recombination with a thicker TNW film. In addition, as the size of the CMC increased with increasing TNW length, the connection between the microcuboid and TNW is not strong enough. Hence, some top areas of TNW are not fully covered by CMCs and therefore result in some shunt paths between TNW and hole transport materials, which would also reduce the Voc.48
The large grain size, full surface coverage and uniform grain structure of the perovskite films are highly desirable for achieving high-performance PSCs.14,28,36 Manipulation of the rate of crystallisation and growth during the perovskite film fabrication process is an effective strategy to increase grain sizes.14 We then further optimized the perovskite film growth process. During the second MAI intercalation/conversion step, the effect of IPA/CBZ volume ratio on perovskite film formation has been investigated. The volume ratio of IPA:CBZ was varied from 1:0 to 2:1 and to 1:1. The resulting films are denoted as IPA, IPA:CBZ = 2:1 and IPA:CBZ = 1:1. Panels a–c in Fig. S8† show SEM images of the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 films. The sizes of the CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids vary with the IPA:CBZ ratio. In the absence of CBZ (pure IPA), the CH3NH3PbI3 film mainly consists of relatively small cuboids with size less than 250 nm (Fig. S9a†). When CBZ is introduced (IPA:CBZ = 2:1), the CH3NH3PbI3 film is composed of many relatively large cuboids with sizes up to ∼1000 nm for the IPA:CBZ = 2:1 sample (Fig. S9b†) and up to ∼500 nm for the IPA:CBZ = 1:1 analogue (Fig. S9c†). Fig. S10† shows the dynamic changes of the film colour during the MAI intercalation process with pure IPA and IPA:CBZ = 2:1 as indicated. It is worth noting that the conversion of the PbI2 film into CH3NH3PbI3via the CBZ-assisted MAI intercalation step is found to be much faster. In the presence of CBZ, the film begins to look grey in the initial 5 s, indicating the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 within a short period of time. And after 20 s, a quite dark and hazy film is obtained, which contrasts significantly to the transparent red-brown CH3NH3PbI3 fabricated using pure IPA as the solvent. The role of CBZ in the MAI/IPA solution is to induce instant reaction of the PbI2–CH3NH3I precursor during the intercalation process, and force crystallisation and immediate precipitation of CH3NH3PbI3. In this case, the crystal growth is accelerated and a large grain is formed. Fig. S11† compares the XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared under different MAI intercalation conditions. The intensity of the main PbI2 diffraction peak (∼12.5°) decreased significantly and the intensity of CH3NH3PbI3 characteristic peaks (as indicated) enhanced upon introduction of CBZ in the MAI/IPA solution. This result suggests that CBZ-assisted MAI intercalation is beneficial to enhance the crystallinity of CH3NH3PbI3 and facilitate the reaction between PbI2 and MAI and thus decrease the residual amount of PbI2 within the final perovskite film. It is noted that a small amount of residual PbI2 can help improve the device's performance.49 A summary of the photovoltaic parameters for the PSCs based on these three samples is listed in Table S2.† Obviously, the attainable Jsc, Voc and FF of PSCs based on the CBZ-assisted MAI intercalation film are substantially higher than those derived from the pure IPA counterpart. The best PCE of 17.7% is observed for the IPA:CBZ = 2:1 based device, which can be mainly ascribed to the formation of the CMC capping layer with the largest grain size (Fig. S8b†). The CMC film with large grains and high crystallinity greatly contributes to more efficient light absorption and harvesting, and thus generates higher Jsc.24 On the other hand, larger grains possess less grain boundaries and bulk defects, which could effectively suppress charge trapping and reduce the recombination loss within the devices and thus lead to higher Voc and FF.50,51
Although the CBZ-assisted MAI intercalation step is beneficial to obtain a perovskite capping layer with a large grain size, the surface coverage of this layer is not that perfect (as indicated by the white arrows in Fig. 4a), where the uncovered TNW ETL would make contact with hole transport materials, leading to the formation of a “shunt diode” and lowering the Voc and FF.47 Herein, depositing another layer of MAI onto the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 capping layer (prepared with the aforementioned two-step sequential deposition method) has been conducted (see the Experimental section for details), and the optimized perovskite film fabrication procedure has been schematically shown in Fig. S12.† As shown in Fig. 4b, the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 film made with the optimized process exhibits a much more uniform and compact surface with well-interconnected grains. The additional deposition of the MAI layer is beneficial to induce the secondary growth of perovskite grains and thus densify the perovskite capping layer and achieve better surface coverage.10,52,53 The optimal antireflective TNW-based PSC achieved a champion PCE of 20.1% along with a Jsc of 23.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V and a FF of 0.78 (Fig. 4c). The demonstrated PCE of over 20% for PSCs based on such an intriguing 3D antireflective TNW/CH3NH3PbI3 microcuboid hybrid electrode is superior to the devices based on TiO2 nanoparticle/CH3NH3PbI3 sub-microstructured flat grains (a PCE of 18.0%)36 or TNW/CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals (a PCE of 16.0%),43 suggesting the effectiveness of the rational optoelectronic electrode design on further improving the photovoltaic performance. The Jsc value is in good agreement with the integrated Jsc value calculated from IPCE spectra (Fig. 4d). The improvement of photovoltaic performance from 17.7% to 20.1% can be ascribed to the full surface coverage of the perovskite film with suppressed charge recombination for enhanced Voc and improved interfacial contacts between electrodes for elevated FF.52 As shown in Fig. S13,† the best-performing cell achieved a PCE of 19.7%, along with a Jsc of 23.1 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V and a FF of 0.77 when measured under a forward voltage scan. The Jsc and Voc reduction was small, suggesting that such 3D hybrid TNW/CMC electrode-based PSCs have a negligible hysteresis. The measurement of light intensity dependent J–V characteristics for the champion device was conducted. As shown in Fig. S14,† the PCE slightly drops from 20.1% (Jsc = 23.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.11 V and FF = 0.78) under 1 sun irradiation to 19.4% (Jsc = 7.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V and FF =0.77) under 0.3 sun. Our purposely built TNW ETL with a unique 1D geometry and highly porous features, coupled with the facilitated pore filling of CH3NH3PbI3 and excellent surface coverage of the CMC upper layer, ensures better interfacial contact between TNW and CH3NH3PbI3 and thus boosts charge collection from CH3NH3PbI3 to TNW. This could be partially responsible for the observed small hysteresis in the corresponding PSC device.17,47 We compared the photoluminescence (PL) quenching and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) lifetime of the TNW/CMC or TNP/CMC film (the TNW and TNP were kept at a similar film thickness of ∼620 nm). When compared with the TNP/CMC film, the TNW/CMC film witnessed more significant PL quenching and shortened TRPL lifetime (Fig. S15†), suggesting the facilitated charge extraction from CMCs to TNW and thus confirming the effectiveness of using our designed TNW ETLs for more efficient carrier harvesting and management. The PCE output was stabilised to reach 19.5% at the maximum power point (0.91 V, Fig. 4e). The PCE histogram collected from a batch of 30 devices is displayed in Fig. 4f, revealing that more than 80% of the TNW/CMC-based devices yielded PCEs exceeding 18.5% under one sun illumination. These results validate the high performance and high reproducibility of these PSC devices. The shelf life of the champion PSC was evaluated. The device was stored under ambient conditions (∼25% RH and at room temperature) without encapsulation, and it retains over 95% of its original PCE after storage for 500 h (Fig. S16†).

Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared antireflective TNW thin films on FTO glass via a one-step facile hydrothermal approach. The porosity, film thickness and optical transparency of the TNW film can be controlled by adjusting the PTO concentration. Coupled with the optimized step-by-step sequential perovskite deposition technique, where the PbI2 film was immersed in CBZ-added MAI/IPA solution to form large grains followed by another deposition of the MAI layer to improve the surface coverage, the intriguing integration of the antireflective TNW film and CMC capping layer into an efficient 3D photoactive electrode has been achieved. The best-performing PSC attained an impressive PCE of 20.1%, which can be ascribed to the following aspects: (1) efficient light utilization and harvesting efficiency endorsed by both the TNW ETL with promising antireflection properties and the thick microstructured CMC layer with considerable light harvesting capabilities; (2) the 1D nanowire thin film with a porous network is beneficial to facilitate infiltration of CH3NH3PbI3 into the voids among TNWs, which ensures a good interfacial contact between the perovskite and TNW; and (3) suppressed charge recombination originating from the optimized CH3NH3PbI3 upper layer with a large grain size, well-interconnected network and good surface coverage. This work provides a guideline for the facile fabrication of a 1D nanostructured metal oxide/3D microstructured perovskite hybrid electrode with efficient light utilization and harvesting efficiency, which is also applicable to other photonic and optoelectronic applications such as electrochromic smart windows, photocatalysis, LEDs and lasers, etc.
Experimental section
Preparation of TNW films on FTO glass
The laser-patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC8, Dyesol) substrates (2.5 cm × 3 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned with soap (5% Hellmanex in water), acetone, ethanol and water for 10 min, respectively. The TNW thin films were hydrothermally grown on FTO glass without the assistance of a seed layer. To avoid the growth of TNW on the glass side of the FTO substrate, the glass side was pre-covered with Kapton tape before the hydrothermal reaction. Briefly, the cleaned substrate was immersed into a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave containing 0.050–0.125 g potassium titanium oxide oxalate dihydrate (PTO, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 5 mL Milli-Q water and 15 mL diethylene glycol (DEG, Thermal Fisher), and kept at 190 °C for 3 h. After being cooled, the samples were rinsed with Milli-Q water and ethanol several times, and the Kapton tape was removed and the glass side was washed using absolute ethanol. Then the resulting films were annealed at 500 °C for 3 h in air to improve the crystallinity of TiO2, remove any residual organic solvent and obtain the TNW structure firmly attached on FTO.
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
The perovskite film was prepared by the sequential deposition method. First, PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich) under stirring at 70 °C to yield a concentration of 460 mg mL−1. 25 μL of PbI2 precursor solution was infiltrated into the TNW scaffold (pre-warmed at 70 °C) via spin-coating at 6500 rpm for 10 s and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. After being cooled to room temperature, the PbI2-coated films were dipped into 8 mg mL−1 MAI (home-made, pre-warmed at 70 °C) in IPA and CBZ mixed solution (volume ratio of IPA:CBZ was adjusted to 1:0, 2:1 and 1:1, respectively) for 20 s. To further optimise the surface coverage of the perovskite film, 200 μL of MAI/IPA (20 mg mL−1) solution was spin-coated onto the as-prepared electrodes at 4000 rpm for 30 s. After quickly rinsing with IPA solution, the resultant CH3NH3PbI3 films were annealed on a hotplate at 70 °C for 30 min. The hole transport material solution was prepared by dissolving 41.6 mg of spiro-MeOTAD (Taiwan, Lumtec), 7.5 μL of a stock solution of 500 mg mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile and 14.4 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.5 mL). The spiro-MeOTAD layer was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm of the Au layer was thermally evaporated to form the back contact and complete the device.
Device characterization
The morphology of the as-prepared TiO2 samples and perovskite films was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The crystal structures of the perovskite films were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ= 1.5418 Å). The transmittance, diffused reflectance and optical absorption spectra were obtained with a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer installed with a 150 mm integrating sphere. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics and steady power output of the PSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel solar simulator. Before each measurement, the exact incident light intensity was determined using a calibrated Si reference photodiode (Peccell Technologies). The cells were masked with a black metal aperture of 0.16 cm2. The IPCE spectra were recorded as a function of wavelength from 330 to 800 nm on a Keithley 2400 source meter under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp fitted with an Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4 m monochromator.
