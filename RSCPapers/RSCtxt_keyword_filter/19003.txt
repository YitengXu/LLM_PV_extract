Introduction
Tin oxide (SnO2), a wide band gap n-type semiconductor, is of great importance essentially because of its wide range of applications. It has been widely used in the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes,1 rechargeable lithium batteries,2–4 gas sensors,5–9 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).10–12 Of great interest is nanostructured SnO2, whose properties could be significantly improved, compared with the bulk material, benefiting from nanometer size effects.13,14 Promoted by this expectation, various nanostructures of SnO2 and SnO2-based composites such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods, hollow nanostructures, and mesoporous solids have been synthesized.15–18 These nanostructures have demonstrated very promising results for photoelectrodes of DSSCs, gas sensing and photocatalysts. However, it is a challenge to further improve the performances of SnO2 by the utilization of tailored geometries.
Recently, bifunctional mesoporous microspheres, which are comprised of polydisperse aggregates consisting of nanosized crystallites, have received increasing attention due to their fascinating potential applications ranging from electronics and energy to catalysis.19–25 In terms of DSSCs, on the one hand, the nanocrystallites provide the films with the necessary large internal surface area, which maximizes the uptake of the dye molecules, thereby giving rise to DSSCs with large current density and high photon-to-current conversion efficiency. On the other hand, an apparent mesoporous microstructure can confine the incident light within the electrode and enhance the electron conduction. As an example, mesoporous TiO2 beads20 and ZnO aggregates,21 and hierarchically structured ZnO22,23 have been demonstrated to be efficient structures exhibiting improved photoconversion efficiency when used for DSSCs. In terms of gas sensors, the mesoporous nanobead-scaffolded microspheres structure is one of the best systems of choice because it can take both the advantages of nanometer-sized building blocks and mesoporous micrometer-sized assemblies. While the former provides high surface areas and hence is the key to the high sensitivity, the latter allows the detected gases to be preferably concentrated inside the mesopores, which will undoubtedly improve the sensitivity. Meanwhile, the existence of the pores also facilitates quick gas diffusion and mass transport in sensor materials, and guarantees favorable kinetics and fast-responding sensing behaviors.26 In terms of the photocatalyst, with a much larger specific surface area, nanobeads possess stronger adsorption ability and a larger number of surface active sites. Meanwhile, such micro-sized photocatalysts can also be easily recycled from the reaction system by simple filtering or centrifugation.
It is well-known that N-TiO2 has been demonstrated to be an efficient way to improve the performance as used for photocatalysts by narrowing the band gap.27,28 Generally, nitrified TiO2 can be effectively fabricated by calcining under NH3 flow at higher temperature. However, this synthetic procedure is not exempt of draw-backs, because they require complicated synthetic steps, and high reaction temperature. It is noteworthy that the preparation of mesoporous nanobead-scaffolded N-TiO2 microspheres has rarely been reported so far because its mesoporous structure is not thermally stable enough at an operating temperature.
In this paper, we report the synthesis of nanobead-scaffolded N-containing SnO2 mesoporous microspheres (NSMMs) through a one-pot solvothermal route with ethylenediamine (En) as solvent. All structural features of the hierarchically assembled and large well-defined spheres, diameter range, mesoporous properties, higher specific surface areas, high-level donor density, and negative shift of the conduction band gives the NSMMs versatile applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with the highest recorded short-circuit current so far among pure SnO2 photoanodes, highly sensitive and short response/recovery-time gas sensor, and highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of dye.
Experimental
Synthesis of nanobead-scaffolded N-containing SnO2 mesoporous microspheres
All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. In a typical synthesis of SnO2, 0.21 g of SnCl4·5H2O, 0.48 g of glucose (C6H12O6) and 0.86 g of CO(NH2)2 were added to 30 mL of ethylenediamine (En). After stirring for several minutes, the obtained slurry was transferred to a stainless Teflon-lined autoclave of 50 mL inner volume. The synthesis was performed under an autogenerated pressure at 200 °C for 8 h in an electric oven, followed by cooling naturally to room temperature. Then the white precipitate and colorless supernatant were obtained. The precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water and dried in air naturally.
Characterizations
Crystallographic phases and purity information of the prepared samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature. The XRD pattern was recorded in the 2θ range of 20–80° on a Rigaku-D/Max 2500 V/PC X-ray diffractometer using Cu K1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 40 kV and 200 mA. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained on an XL30 ESEM FEG scanning electron microscope operating at 20 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were observed on a JEM 200CX TEM instrument. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was collected on an ESCALab MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using non-monochromatized Mg K X-rays as the excitation source. The binding energies were corrected for specimen charging by calibrating the C1s peak to 284.6 eV. A Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrometer fitted with an integrating sphere was used to investigate the optical absorption of powder. UV-visible absorption spectra of powder samples were recorded using pure BaSO4 pellet as the reference. The surface areas were measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurement (BET) method by using N2 adsorption at room temperature on a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e apparatus. The dye-immersed photoanodes were soaked in a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution to desorb the dye. The amount of desorbed dye was quantified by measuring the optical absorption spectra.
Preparation of the electrode
Several volumes of absolute ethanol and 1 g of powder were transferred to a tall beaker and stirred for 10 min. The ultrasonic homogenization was performed with using a Ti-horn-equipped sonicator (Vibra cell 72408, Bioblock scientific). Two grams of anhydrous terpineol (Fluka) and 4 g of the mixture solution of two ethyl celluloses in ethanol were added, followed by stirring and sonication. The contents in dispersion were concentrated by evaporator at 38 °C with 120 mbar at first. The pressure was evacuated until 10 mbar. The pastes were finalized. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass (15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned with detergent, dilute HCl aqueous solution, KOH ethanol solution, and deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaner. A layer of paste was coated onto the substrate using the doctor-blade technique. After being dried at 125 °C for 30 min in air, the film was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min in air. Then the layer of film was sintered at 500 °C for 15 min in an air flow to improve the interconnection between the oxide film and the FTO substrate, as well as to remove any residual solvents or organic compounds. When being cooled to 80 °C, the film was immersed into N719 ethanol solution for 20 h. The counter electrode was a magnetron sputtered platinum mirror. The substrate, film, and counter electrode constituted a sandwich-like open cell. The electrolyte was composed of 1.0 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMIMI), 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2 and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15).
Photovoltaic characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of two DSSCs under AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) was performed with an active illumination area of 0.132 cm2 on a Keithley 236 source measurement unit under AM 1.5 illumination cast by an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator calibrated by the standard reference of a Newport 91150 silicon solar cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) curves of the DSSCs were also observed with a PAR2273 workstation (Princeton Applied Research, USA). The frequency range was from 50 mHz to 100 kHz.
Gas-sensing test
NSMMs and commercial SnO2 nanoparticle (CNP) powder were mixed with a bit of ethanol to form SnO2 pastes in a glass beaker. The SnO2 pastes were then brush-coated onto the surface of an Al2O3 microtube with four Pt electrodes. The coating process was repeated several times to form a complete coating. The SnO2-coated Al2O3 microtube was then welded on to a special pedestal with six poles by solder paste. A heating coil was then inserted through the Al2O3 microtube and its two ends were welded to the other two poles of the pedestal. The ethanol-sensing properties of the SnO2 sensors were measured using a JF02E gas sensor test system of Kunming Guiyan Jinfeng technology Co. Ltd. The sensors were infixed into an air chamber with 10 inlet sites. Different concentrations of ethanol vapors (100–800 ppm) were used as the target gas to test the sensing performance of the NSMMs and CNPs SnO2 powder. The operating temperatures were 300–400 °C, controlled by an electric heating system (applied voltages: 3.0–5.0 V).
Photocatalytic activity test
100 mL aqueous suspension of rhodamine B (RhB) with an initial concentration of 10−5 was mixed with 0.1 g of as-prepared SnO2 powder in a round glass reactor with a diameter of 8 cm. The suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to approach adsorption/desorption equilibrium. After that, the photocatalytic reaction was carried out under a 500 W xenon lamp with a current of 20 A. At given time intervals, the photoreacted solution was separated from the SnO2 powder by filtration to test the variation of the remaining concentration by measuring the UV-vis absorption spectra on a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrometer.
Results and discussion
FE-SEM images of the as-synthesized NSMMs exhibit a well-defined spherical morphology, in sharp contrast with shape-irregular commercial SnO2 nanoparticles (CNPs, see Fig. S1, ESI†). The sphere size typically ranges from 1.2 to 1.5 μm (Fig. 1a and b). The high-resolution FESEM images suggest that these SnO2 spheres are constructed of packed nanobeads (10–15 nm) that are closely interconnected with each other (Fig. 1c and d), suggesting good charge transport properties and high internal surface area for dye adsorption and potential enhancement of light harvesting efficiency. The NSMM morphology was maintained after annealing at 500 °C for 0.5 h in air with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 (see Fig. S2, ESI†).

The TEM images further reveal that the NSMMs were formed by interconnected nanobeads with a size of about 10 nm (Fig. 2a). Multiple pores formed with interbead voids were observed as indicated by arrowheads. The HRTEM image shows the resolved lattice fringes separated by 0.33 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of the tetragonal phase (Fig. 2b).
 Fig. 2  (a) TEM and (b) HRTEM images of the NSMMs. Inset: the scale bars are 200 nm in (a). 
All the XRD peaks for the NSMMs can be assigned to the tetragonal phase with lattice constants a = b = 4.738 nm c = 3.187 nm, α = β = γ = 90° (JCPDS no. 41-1445) (see Fig. S3e, ESI†). No appearance of other diffraction peaks indicates high phase purity. The XPS spectra also demonstrate the presence of Sn, O and N elements (see Fig. S4a, ESI†). The product formed with pure water as the solvent contains no N moiety. As a result, it is believed that the N 1s peak originates from the raw material, En, which is firm proof that En participated in the formation of the product in the solvothermal process. Moreover, the N amount of the NSMMs has no obvious change (from 3.17% to 3.14%) after annealing at 500 °C for 0.5 h in air (see Fig. S4b, ESI†). Compared with the spectra of CNPs, slight shifts to lower binding energies were observed for NSMMs in the Sn 3d region (see Fig. S4c, ESI†). It is known that the binding energy of an element is influenced by its electron density. A decrease in binding energy implies an increase of the electron density. Therefore, this shift is probably attributed to the change of chemical environment after N doping.29 The electrons of N atoms may be partially transferred from N to Sn, due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen, leading to increased electron densities on Sn atoms.
While the CNPs show no absorption of visible-light, due to the large band-gap energy (see Fig. S5, ESI†), the NSMMs exhibit little absorption in the visible light region. The band gap of the NSMMs estimated as 3.09 eV, is substantially smaller than that of the CNPs (3.54 eV), which is attributed to the presence of N in the SnO2, based on (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg), in which α, ν, A, and Eg signify the absorption coefficient, light frequency, proportionality constant, and band gap, respectively (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The band gap of the NSMMs, 3.10 eV, was maintained after annealing at 500 °C for 0.5 h in air with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 (see Fig. S5b, ESI†).
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the NSMMs displays a typical type IV curve (type H2 hysteresis loop) (see Fig. S7, ESI†), which is usually ascribed to the predominance of mesopores and the existence of pore connectivity effects. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution obtained from the isotherm indicates a main pore size of 3.56 nm. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area is 93.64 m2 g−1, which is impressive and much higher than that of CNPs (25.12 m2 g−1). Such a mesoporous structure should, we believe, facilitate electrolyte diffusion and promote more adsorption of the dye.
The formation mechanism of the unique SnO2 architectures was investigated by tracing the morphological evolution process. As shown in Fig. S8a†, the sample shows large loosely aggregated bulks after solvothermal reaction for 2 h. With a solvothermal time of 4 h, rough microspheres can be observed (see Fig. S8b, ESI†), and after 8 h, perfect nanobead-scaffolded SnO2 mesoporous microspheres were achieved (Fig. 1a). In the absence of glucose, SnO2 nanorods instead of microspheres were obtained (see Fig. S8c, ESI†). If water serves as solvent instead of En in the presence of glucose, only SnO2 bulks were formed (see Fig. S8d, ESI†). As a result, we believe that the synergistic effect of En and glucose is responsible for the formation of NSMMs. Fig. S3† shows the XRD patterns of the above samples.

Fig. 3 shows the Mott–Schottky (MS) plots of the electrodes based on the NSMMs and CNPs. Reversed sigmoidal plots were observed with an overall shape consistent with that typical for n-type semiconductors. The NSMM electrode (−0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl) showed a large negative shift of the conduction band as compared with the CNP-based electrode (−0.07 V vs. Ag/AgCl). In addition, the slope of the linear region for the NSMM sample showed a much lower value, clearly indicating significantly higher donor density for the NSMM electrode. The NSMMs with a negative shift of the conduction band, and high-level donor density are expected to show drastically different photocatalytic properties from those of CNPs and existing photocatalytic materials such as TiO2.1

Fig. 4 compares the solar cell response based on the NSMMs and CNPs. We can see that the cell made of CNPs possesses a η of about 1.07%, which is similar to the result reported by Qian et al.13 In contrast, the cell made of NSMMs shows a higher value of η ∼ 2.31%, which represents about a 116% enhancement compared to the former cell. Compared with the conversion efficiency of previous SnO2 nanowires (2.1%),10 SnO2 particles (0.005%),11 coral-like porous SnO2 hollow architecture (1.04%),12 and spherical SnO2 (0.42%),12 those of the NSMM SnO2 are superior. The open-circuit photovoltage of the NSMM DSSCs (Voc = 0.40 V) is higher than that obtained from the CNP DSSCs (Voc = 0.33 V). The conduction band values of the NSMMs negative movement might be caused through passivation of the sub-band-edge surface-states by doping N into the SnO2 framework30 explaining the improved Voc seen in the corresponding DSSCs (Fig. 3). Moreover, the conduction band values of the NSMMs was maintained after annealing at 500 °C in air (see Fig. S9, ESI†). The distinct photovoltaic behavior of the NSMMs is its large short-circuit current (JSC = 10.08 mA cm−2), which is the highest recorded so far among pure SnO2 photoanodes other than TiO2 or other-modified ones, to the best of our knowledge,16,18 also relatively with the CNPs (JSC = 6.71 mA cm−2). This superb photocurrent can be considered following three combined effects: (1) better dye adsorption, due to increased active surface area. As listed in Table 1, the dye desorption measurement shows that the NSMM photoanodes possess much better dye adsorption properties than CNP photoanodes. The improved dye adsorption on the NSMMs can be better explained by the larger surface area. (2) Better light-harvesting efficiency, due to the spherical structure. This is supported by the result shown in Fig. 5 which features diffused reflectance spectra of the photoanode films. Compared with the reflectance of the CNP film, the NSMM film had a higher diffuse reflection capability in the visible regions (from 400 nm to 800 nm) both before and after the dye absorption, revealing that the incident light was more efficiently scattered by the film made of NSMMs due to the larger micrometer size of the mesoporous spheres.5–7 The improved light scattering effect can thus increase the light traveling path and enhance the interaction between SnO2 and dye molecules, resulting in higher light harvesting efficiencies and a correspondingly higher photocurrent. (3) In addition, the charge transport through the photoanode films made of mesoporous SnO2 spheres might be improved due to better interbead connectivity caused by the close attachment of primary beads, as previously discussed in connection with the FESEM in Fig. 1c and d, which contributes to better charge collection and higher Jsc.31

To investigate the electron transport properties in SnO2 film electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed in the frequency range of 50 mHz to 100 kHz (Fig. 6 and Table 1). There were two semicircles, the smaller semicircle occurring at higher frequencies and the larger one in the lower frequency region signifies the resistance of the FTO sheet substrates (Rs) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) occurring at the SnO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively.32–35Rs corresponding to NSMM-DSSCs and CNP-DSSCs show no obvious difference among them. The fitting value of Rct corresponding to NSMM-DSSCs (77.8 Ω) is much smaller than that of CNP-DSSCs (104.8 Ω). The low transfer resistance could be owed to better interbead connectivity caused by the tightly packed nanobeads, which favors electron transport through a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance.13 Intersectional contact with one another of the nanobeads of neighboring spheres increases the transport channel of the injected electrons through the adjacent spheres. The lifetime of electrons in the oxide film (τe) can be estimated from the maximum angular frequency (ωmax) of the impedance semicircle arc at middle frequencies, according to the relation τe = 1/ωmax = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the maximum frequency of the middle-frequency peak.36 As shown in Fig. 6a, the fmax are located at 18.7 Hz for the CNP cell and 5.46 Hz for the NSMM cell, respectively. The electron lifetime (τe) for recombination is estimated to be 8.5 ms and 29.2 ms, respectively (Table 1). A significant increase in the τe value reveals the effective retardation of the charge recombination reaction between photo-injected electrons with I3− during the electron transport through the film of NSMMs, as compared to the CNP-based film. There is no doubt that the longer electron lifetimes enable the NSMM film to achieve higher overall photoconversion efficiencies. Meanwhile, the characteristic frequency in the Bode phase plot of the NSMM device shifted to a lower frequency relative to those of the CNP device (Fig. 6b), further indicating that the charge-recombination rate is reduced in the NSMM systems and leads to the capture of more electrons and the enhancement of the cell efficiency.37

Furthermore, we also investigated the performance of the NSMMs and CNPs as gas sensors for the detection of ethanol gas. Fig. 7a depicts the sensitivity of the two sensors to ethanol gas at different concentrations, suggesting that the obtained NSMMs have better gas sensitivity to ethanol gas than the CNPs, and have good response to ethanol gas with a good linear dependence on the ethanol concentration (correlation coefficient R = 0.9899). The sensitivity of the NSMMs is much higher than that of the CNPs sample. For example, at the ethanol concentration of 200, 800 ppm, the NSMMs have sensitivities of 130, 325, while the sensitivities are about 43, 70 for the CNPs. Compared with the ethanol gas-sensing properties of previous SnO2 nanorods (31.4 to 300 ppm),38 Sb-droped SnO2 nanowires (2.5 to 200 ppm),39 and SnO2 nanosheets (98.40 to 200 ppm),40 those of the NSMMs SnO2 are superior. The response and recovery times (time for 90% of total response change) were about 9 s and 11 s for the 800 ppm C2H5OH, respectively (Fig. 7b). These times are short enough for practical use. For SnO2-based sensors, the sensing mechanism is mainly due to the surface conductivity modulation by the adsorption and desorption of gas molecules.41 Therefore, the diffusion of gas molecules across the surface of the sensing structure affects the sensitivity remarkably.42,43 For the SnO2 sensor described here, we believe that the higher sensing performance can be attributed to the novel mesoporous nanobead-scaffolded microspheres. On the one hand, the microstructures result in the formation of two 3D networks, one consisting of interconnected SnO2 nanobeads and the other consisting of interconnected pores.44 While the former can improve interconnection of nanosized components and hence shorten the transfer of electrons or signals, the latter is favorable for condensation of the detected gas inside mesopores to increase local concentration, and the target gas transportation and accessibility.45 On the other hand, the nanosized SnO2 nanobeads provide a large contact area between sensing materials and sensing species and thus are key to the much enhanced sensitivity.46

As a potential large band gap semiconductor used for photocatalysis, SnO2 has been widely applied in the photocatalytic degradation of organic reagents. We examined the photodegradation of the dye rhodamine B (RhB) using the synthesized NSMMs as well as CNPs for comparison purposes under simulated sunlight irradiation. The temporal evolution of the spectral changes accompanying the photodegradation of RhB over NSMMs is shown in Fig. 8a. From the characteristic absorption peak at 553 nm, we find the NSMMs exhibit strong adsorption ability in the dark, and they can adsorb as much as 12% of the RhB within 30 min. As for the degradation step under irradiation, the concentration of the remaining organic matter decreases rapidly as time goes by. Fig. 8b shows the temporal concentration changes of RhB over two samples. The normalized concentration of the solution (C0/C) is proportional to the normalized maximum absorbance (A0/A), and therefore we used C0/C instead of A0/A. As shown in Fig. 8b, the photodegradation of RhB catalyzed by the SnO2 nanostructures follows a first-order rate law, ln(C0/C) = kt, where k is the apparent rate constant of the degradation. In our experiment, k was found to be 0.0143 min−1 for the NSMMs, and 0.0072 min−1 for CNPs, respectively. Clearly, the loss of RhB over NSMMs was faster than CNPs. After illumination for 105 min, there is only 16% of RhB remaining when the NSMMs are used as the photocatalyst, implying a 3.5 times quicker degradation rate than the CNPs (54% remained, see Fig. S10, ESI†). The specific surface area is first supposed to account for the promotion of photocatalytic activity. Many reports have studied the remarkable effect of surface area on the photocatalytic performance.47–49 With a much larger specific surface area, nanobeads possess a stronger adsorption ability and a larger number of surface active sites. On the other hand, it has been identified that the doping of nitrogen in SnO2 gave rise to the enhanced absorption in the visible region, which may also be the main reason for the enhancement. Moreover, NSMMs can be recycled at least three times without appreciable loss of photocatalytic activity (Fig. 8c).

Conclusion
A facile method was developed for the synthesis of mesoporous nanobead-scaffolded SnO2 microspheres with a high surface area. Inspired by the unique structure, the hierarchically assembled and large well-defined sphere diameters, mesoporous properties, higher specific surface areas, high-level donor density, and negative shift of the conduction band, NSMMs have applications in a variety of areas. The NSMM DSSCs demonstrate larger short-circuit current, longer electron lifetimes, and increased dye loading than the CNPs counterparts, and consequently a high photoconversion efficiency of 2.31%, a 116% improvement compared to the CNP film. Meanwhile, the NSMMs exhibit high sensitivities toward ethanol gas, remarkably short response/recovery times, and good photocatalytic performance for the degradation of rhodamine B solution under simulated sunlight irradiation.
