Morphological evolution as a function of reaction time was carried out to gain insight into the formation mechanism of the nanorod microspheres. Unlike traditional bulk rutile TiO2 particles, the nanorod microspheres could provide dual-functions of adsorbing dye molecules and strong light-harvesting efficiency when they were fabricated as a scattering overlayer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Furthermore, the inherent nanorods would provide excellent electron percolation pathways for charge transfer as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Consequentially, DSSC with the scattering overlayer exhibited a 39% increment of cell efficiency (7.32%) compared with the DSSC without one (5.28%), and the efficiency was also a little higher than the DSSC with the same thickness composed of only nanocrystallites (7.14%).
Introduction
With the strong demand in sustainable and renewable energies, solar power is attracting global attention nowadays. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with advantages of low manufacturing cost and high theoretical efficiency, have been considered as promising candidates for next-generation solar cells.1–3 More recently, Grätzel et al. updated the record of energy conversion efficiency of DSSC to 12.3% under simulated air mass 1.5 global sunlight, bringing it closer to commercial production.4
In a typical DSSC, light is absorbed by dye molecules which are anchored on the mesoporous metal oxides to generate free electrons. Therefore, light-harvesting efficiency has been one of the key issues affecting the DSSC performance. Compared with designing novel dye sensitizers for absorbing a wider range of light, constructing the photoanodes to enhance light scattering is relatively simple and straightforward to improve light-harvesting because conventional photoanode films made from tiny TiO2 nanocrystallites usually exhibit high transparency.5–8 Intensive researches have been proposed in order to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs to date. For example, the micron-sized spherical voids or TiO2 particles as scattering centres were mixed into a transparent (semi-transparent) matrix containing nanoparticles, which would confine the incident light within an electrode, thus increasing the probability of photons being absorbed.9–11 However, voids or large particles inevitably decrease the total surface areas of the photoanode films which in turn decrease the dye loading.12 The bi-layer structure with a light-scattering film placed on top of the nanocrystalline film has also been widely adopted as it increases the optical path of light and thereby enhances the photocurrent density.13,14 However, except for their role in the actual light scattering, these scattering particles hardly adsorb dye molecules and have relatively low energy contribution due to their low specific surface areas. Therefore, dual-functional materials offering both light-scattering and electricity-generation properties were proposed.15–19 For instance, mesoporous spheres composed of tiny anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites which clustered together to form larger secondary particles have been synthesized. They functioned as light scatterers without sacrificing the internal surface area needed for effective dye uptake.19
Rutile TiO2 has a higher refractive index than that of the anatase form which leads to a stronger scattering effect, and has been applied as a scattering layer in DSSCs extensively.13,20,21 However, the low specific surface area of the bulk rutile TiO2 restricts their further application. Herein, we synthesized sub-micrometer sized rutile TiO2 nanorod microspheres via a salt-assisted hydrothermal method and used them as a scattering layer in DSSCs. The nanorod microspheres exhibit a relatively large surface area for efficient dye adsorption, strong light scattering in the visible-light region for more efficient light-harvesting, and furthermore, the one-dimensional nanorods provide direct electron pathways for electron transport. Thus, distinctive enhancement of energy conversion efficiency was achieved.
Experimental section
Materials synthesis
The synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 for the underlayer and the preparation of DSSC pastes were mainly according to Grätzel's work.22 The crystallite size of the nanocrystalline TiO2 was about 20 nm as shown in the FESEM image and the specific surface area was 100.2 m2 g−1 (Fig. S1 and S2 in ESI†). The synthesis of rutile TiO2 nanorods was similar to our previous paper,23 but there was a salt-assisted route to synthesize the nanorod microspheres. In brief, pure TiCl4 was added dropwise into ice-cold distilled water under vigorous stirring to obtain 2 M stock solution. The aqueous solution was diluted with distilled water at room temperature, and then the NaCl solution was added to adjust the concentration to 0.3 M TiCl4 and 3 M NaCl. Subsequently, the solution mixture was hydrothermally treated at 120 °C for 12 h. The nanorod microspheres were obtained after washing the hydrothermal products with distilled water. To investigate the morphological evolution of the TiO2 nanorod microspheres in the solvent and find out the possible growth mechanism, a series of time-dependent experiments (3, 6, 9 h) were also carefully carried out.
Electrode preparation and solar cell assembly
FTO glass was cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, and then rinsed with water and ethanol. The TiO2 paste was coated on the FTO glass by the doctor-blade method, and then dried for 6 min at 125 °C in an electronic oven. The thickness of the films was confirmed by the optical profiler. The electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min under air atmosphere. After cooling to 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed for 24 h in an ethanolic solution of ruthenium dye N719 at a concentration of 3.0 × 10−4 M. The electrodes were then rinsed with ethanol to remove excess amounts of dye and dried in a vacuum oven. The solar cells were assembled by placing a platinized counter electrode on the top of the sensitized photoanode.22 The two electrodes were clamped into a sandwich type cell with a Surlyn hot-melt foil as a spacer frame. The redox electrolyte was introduced into the space through the hole predrilled on the back of the counter electrode. After the assembling, the solar cells were immediately measured using a 0.25 cm2 mask aperture.
Characterization
The powder phase composition was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipment (Model D/max 2550 V, Rigaku Co. Tokyo, Japan) by using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The morphology and the size of the resultant titanium dioxide were observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Model S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100F, JEOL Co., Japan). The specific surface area and pore size distribution of TiO2 powder were measured at the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, for specific surface area) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH, for average pore diameter) methods using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1-MP analyzer. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the resulting TiO2 films and absorbance of desorption dye solution were collected on a spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin-Elmer, USA). The thickness of the films was measured by an optical profiler (Wyko NT9100, Veeco Co., USA). Current–voltage curves of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under illumination of simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) provided by a Newport solar simulator (Model 96160) with an AM 1.5G filter. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800 nm using a specially designed IPCE system (Newport Co., USA). Impedance spectroscopy was performed using an electrochemical analyzer (Zahner–elecktrik, Germany). Impedance measurements were carried out by applying a DC bias at open circuit voltage and an AC voltage with an amplitude of 10 mV in a frequency range from 100 MHz to 100 kHz under AM 1.5G illumination.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show the low magnification and high magnification FESEM images of the microspheres, in which particle sizes range from 500–700 nm. It is shown that the short nanorods with length range from tens to a few hundreds of nanometers radiate from the centre and form the dandelion-like structure. The microstructure of the microspheres was further examined by high-resolution TEM (Fig. 1c). From the HRTEM image, the single-crystalline nature of the nanorods is clearly observed. The nanorods grow along the [001] direction, and the lattice spacing of 3.25 Å can be ascribed to the (110) planes of rutile TiO2. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the TiO2 nanorod microspheres is shown in Fig. 1d. The diffraction peaks agree well with the rutile phase (JCPDS file No. 21-1276), while the crystallite size is about 9.7 nm as estimated from the full width at half maximum of the (110) peak using the Scherrer equation. Furthermore, the relative intensity of the (002) peak has increased about two times from 10% to 20% compared to the standard file. These results further validate that the dandelion-like microspheres were clustered by nanorod crystals. Fig. 1e shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the corresponding pore size distribution curve of the nanorod microspheres. The isotherm displays a typical type IV curve while the hysteresis loop is associated with narrow slit-like pores in the sample which can also be confirmed by the pore size distribution curve. The BET specific surface area of the microspheres is about 63.7 m2 g−1, a little lower than the nanocrystalline TiO2 for the underlayer, but it is much larger than the conventional bulk scattering particles. This guarantees a larger amount of dye adsorption while enhancing the light harvesting of the photoanode simultaneously.

To investigate the morphological evolution of the TiO2 nanorod microspheres in the solvent and discern the possible growth mechanism, a series of time-dependent experiments were carefully carried out to gain insight into the formation process. At the initial stage of reaction, a large number of TiO2 microspheres assembled by nanoparticles were formed as shown in Fig. 2a and b. With increasing the reaction time to 6 h, short nanorods were observed on the surface of the microspheres (Fig. 2c and d). Further extension of the reaction time to 9 h, the shorter nanorods transformed to elongated nanorods and were aligned perpendicularly to the spherical surface, thus TiO2 nanorod microspheres gradually formed (Fig. 2e and f).

Based on the above results, the possible growth process of the TiO2 nanorod microspheres is illustrated schematically in Scheme 1. In the initial stage, a large number of TiO2 nuclei were formed and then aggregated into the ball-like microspheres. When the reaction time increased, the nanoparticles stopped aggregating, instead, the surface nanoparticles of the microspheres were dissolved and recrystallized to single-crystalline nanorods. Further extension the reaction duration led to a perfect dandelion-like structure. This mechanism for the formation of the nanorod microspheres, different from the well-known “nucleation–growth–assembly” mechanism, is “nucleation–assembly–dissolution–recrystallization”.24–27 At the initial stage, the nanoparticles aggregated into the microspheres in a nucleation and self-assembly process. As the reaction time increases, the tiny nanocrystallites and amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles were dissolved and recrystallized to single-crystalline nanorods by crystallographic fusion in order to attain a more stable thermodynamics state,27 in a process called dissolution and recrystallization. A remarkable character of such a formation process is that the diameters of the microspheres change little or even decrease when the synthetic process is extended.25,26 The salt played a crucial role in yielding the radial microsphere structure. Fig. S3, ESI,† shows the sample obtained in the absence of NaCl. No TiO2 nanorod microspheres were produced, and only irregular tiny nanoparticles and a few agglomerates were formed. These TiO2 were not suitable for the scattering layer in DSSCs. We considered that the high ionic strength inhibited the hydrolysis of TiO2+ in the solution and compressed the thickness of the DLVO layer of the colloidal nucleus in the initially formed TiO2 aggregates, and much fewer nuclei were available for the further growth in the presence of NaCl.23 On the other hand, Cl− ions preferentially adsorbed and retarded the growth rate of the (110) plane of rutile TiO2, promoting anisotropic growth into nanorods along the [001] direction.28

The rutile TiO2 nanorod microspheres with relatively large specific surface area are an ideal scattering material for DSSCs. Four different DSSC photoanodes were prepared to investigate the scattering effect in this study: two monolayer photoanode films prepared from nanocrystalline TiO2 (NC) and nanorod microspheres (NM) with the thickness of about 7 μm, a 14 μm thick film (NC–2L) prepared from nanocrystalline TiO2, and a bi-layer film (NC–NM) constructed by a 7 μm thick NM layer on top of the 7 μm thick NC underlayer.

Fig. 3a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of the four bare electrode films. The NC and NC–2L films fabricated from nanometer-sized crystallites exhibit a weak scattering effect and large amounts of visible light in the long-wavelength region transmitted through the film directly, whereas the NC–NM film with a scattering layer shows much stronger reflectance. Because the particle size of the TiO2 nanorod microspheres is analogous to the wavelength of visible light it can lead to a strong scattering effect according to Mie theory.15 Furthermore, the relatively higher refractive index of rutile TiO2 (2.75) than the anatase counterpart (2.52) also contributes to an enhanced light reflectance. UV-vis absorption spectra of the photoanode films after the dye uptaking process would provide further information about light harvesting. As shown in Fig. 3b, the NC–NM film exhibits the strongest absorption intensity over the entire spectrum, implying an effective utilization rate of the incident light.

Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the four DSSCs, and the resultant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. NM DSSC shows a lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) than that of the NC one due to a lower amount of dye absorption. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the NM DSSC are also low; this may be ascribed to inferior interface adhesion between the large microspheres and FTO. The NC–2L photoanode film is 2-fold thicker than the NC one, but the Jsc of the NC–2L DSSC is not 2-fold larger as expected, even the Voc is decreased. Because trap-sites including defects, surface states, and grain boundaries in the film act as electron loss centers, not all photoelectrons are collected by the external circuit. Comparing the NC–2L and NC–NM DSSCs, the latter one shows a higher Jsc, thus leading to a higher energy conversion efficiency (η). Although the NC–NM DSSC adsorbed lower amounts of dye molecules than that of the NC–2L one, the greater scattering effect of the nanorod microspheres compensated for this, leading to a 39% increment of η compared with the NC DSSC without a scattering layer.

The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra would offer detailed information on the light harvesting ability of the DSSCs in Fig. 4b. The IPCE spectra of the NC–2L and NC–NM DSSCs show a considerable increase over the entire range of light than the P25 and NM DSSCs because of the high amount of dye-loading, and in the longer wavelength region of 600–750 nm the quantum efficiency of the NC–NM DSSC is much more prominent than that of the NC–2L one which can be ascribed to the enhanced light scattering effect.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at an applied bias of Voc with an AC amplitude of 10 mV under illumination to reveal the internal resistance and charge-transfer kinetics.29–31Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of NC–2L and NC–NM DSSCs, in which two well-defined semicircles corresponding to charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte–Pt–FTO interface (Rce) and charge transfer resistance at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface (Rct) are observed. The equivalent-circuit model of the DSSCs is also shown in Fig. 5a. The serial resistance (Rs) of the NC–NM DSSC is a little larger than the NC–2L one which leads to a lower fill factor as the J–V curves mentioned. The Rce resistance of the two DSSCs are almost the same, whereas the Rct resistance of the NC–NM cell is smaller. The Rct values of the two DSSCs are about 15.9 Ω for the NC–2L DSSC and 14.6 Ω for the NC–NM DSSC which are obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots with the equivalent-circuit model, indicating acceleration of the electron-transfer process in the bi-layer DSSC. This can be attributed to the enhanced light-harvesting efficiency, as confirmed by the UV-vis spectra. In the photoanode of the NC–NM DSSC, the rutile nanorod microspheres confine the incident light within the electrode and increase the numbers of photoelectrons. On the other hand, it is known that charge transport is largely influenced by the surface charge trap-site density.31 For the photoelectrons far from the FTO substrate, they need to be transported a longer distance in the film, leading to an increased probability of recombination. Because many traps formed by grain boundaries and defects are present in the DSSC fabricated from nanocrystalline TiO2, recombination reactions easily occur. Contrarily, for the NC–NM DSSC, a nanorod–microsphere layer takes the place of the nanocrystalline layer, in which the nanorods would provide excellent electron percolation pathways for charge transfer.
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode-phase plots of DSSCs based on the photoanode films made from NC–2L and NC–NM; the inset displays the equivalent circuit of the DSSC. 
The electron lifetime (τr) in the mesoporous films can be estimated according to the relation τr = 1/ωmax = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the middle frequency peak.29 As shown in the inset of Fig. 5b, the fmax values for the NC–2L and NC–NM DSSCs are 20.3 and 13.7 Hz, respectively. Using the above-mentioned relation, the electron lifetimes are estimated to be 7.8 ms for the NC–2L DSSC, and 11.6 ms for the NC–NM DSSC. The longer lifetime of the NC–NM DSSC is attributed to the high crystallinity and fewer defects of the nanorods which suppress electron recombination. Thus, the nanorod–microsphere scattering layer can not only enhance the light harvesting but is also beneficial to electron transfer.
Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized sub-micrometer sized rutile TiO2 nanorod microspheres via a salt-assisted hydrothermal method. Morphological evolution as a function of reaction time showed that the nanorod microspheres were formed through a “nucleation–assembly–dissolution–recrystallization” mechanism. The microspheres assembled by rutile TiO2 nanorods were of 500–700 nm in diameter and with a specific surface area of 63.7 m2 g−1. When they were fabricated as a scattering overlayer in DSSCs, they provided dual-functions of adsorbing dye molecules and strong light-harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, the nanorod microspheres would provide excellent electron percolation pathways for charge transfer as confirmed by EIS spectra. Thus, DSSC with the scattering overlayer exhibited a 39% increment of cell efficiency (7.32%) compared with the DSSC without one (5.28%), and the efficiency was also a little higher than the DSSC with the same thickness composed of only nanocrystallites (7.14%). We consider that this facile wet-chemical route would have good potential for mass production.
