    , Accepted 30th March 2020First published on 31st March 2020AbstractA series of systematically tailored aryl acyclic (biphenyl, dye 1 and 2), cyclic (phenanthrene, dye 3 and 4) and methyl-substituted (dye 5) imidazole derivatives were synthesized and characterized for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The anisole ancillary donor was attached to the –NH position in the imidazole center to obtain dyes 2 and 4. Cyclic voltammetry and UV-visible studies of all the dyes indicate their suitability for DSSC applications. Among the as-synthesized dyes, dye 4 with a phenanthrene donor and anisole ancillary donor showed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.16% (JSC = 13.07 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.831 V, FF = 0.659). Dye 2 displayed the highest electron lifetime in the conduction band of the photoanode; hence, the open circuit voltage of the DSSC based on dye 2 was the highest among the studied dyes (0.865 V). By using a novel potential-assisted dye staining process, the dye loading on the photoanode was enhanced by 18% in 1 h, which in turn enhanced the PCE to 8.10%.
1. Introduction
Incredible progress has been made over the past decades in the development of donor–acceptor (D–A) systems bearing organic π conjugated molecules and organic polymers due to their potential applications in organic electronics, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1,2 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)3–6 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).7 Compared with organic polymers, small organic conjugated molecules have great advantages for photovoltaics in terms of well-defined organic structures, reproducibility, solubility, unique charge transfer properties, tunable band gap and facile fabrication of devices.8–19
In recent years, a wide variety of organic D–π–A molecules based on anthracene, phenothiazine, carbazole, fluorene, pyrene, quinoxaline, and triphenylamine have been widely used as light absorbers in DSSCs; all of these delivered efficiencies in the range of 5–9%.20–27 The major drawbacks of the rod-like D–π–A metal-free organic molecules are their low power conversion efficiency (PCE) in DSSCs due to the formation of dye aggregates on the semiconductor surface and the recombination of electrons in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 with I3− electrolyte. To overcome these issues, we introduced the imidazole moiety into the D–π–A system to obtain non-linear organic structures, which can retard the charge recombination dynamics.28 Jia et al. reported a PCE of 4.11% with CD4 dye containing an imidazole moiety functionalized at its 4 and 5 positions.29 Lin et al. synthesized a triphenylamine-functionalized imidazole moiety that exhibited a PCE of 6.35%.30 There are several reports on imidazole-containing dyes whose PCEs range between 1% and 6%.6,29–37
In this study, we report the synthesis of two types of imidazole-based dyes. Type I are basically 4,5-disubstituted imidazole derivatives wherein the substituents are biphenyl units, represented by compounds 1 and 2. Usually, in the literature, the imidazole ring is substituted with a triphenylamine moiety to serve as an electron donor. The type II dyes are imidazole derivatives with a fused phenanthrene residue embedded in the structure; these are represented by 3 and 4. The planarity of the phenanthrene unit ensured effective π conjugation/delocalization compared to dyes 1 and 2. The corresponding molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the imidazole scaffold in the dyes contains two types of lone-pair electrons. One is on the pyrrolic nitrogen, which is delocalized and endows the pyrrolic nitrogen with acidity. The other is on the pyridinic N, which is basic and carries a non-Hückel lone pair. Due to this, the two nitrogens have different pKa values (∼7.0 and 14.9); hence, the imidazole is amphoteric in nature. Any substitution at the pyrrolic site may increase or decrease the pKa value of the pyrrolic nitrogen. However, substitution with an electron-donating group such as anisole (if it is in plane with the imidazole moiety) may increase the basicity of the pyrrolic site, thereby decreasing the difference in the pKa values of the two nitrogen sites in the imidazole moiety; this aids the delocalization of the electrons in the fused aromatic ring.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of dyes 1–5. 
The embedded anisole part in the imidazole moiety performs a dual role of increasing the hydrophobicity and inhibiting the penetration of the electrolyte through the dye layer. The proposed imidazole-based dyes have been synthesized and studied. We also propose a new dye-adsorption technique, electrosorption, which accelerates dye staining of the TiO2 semiconductor and enhances the overall performance of DSSCs.
Different dye staining methods have been reported in the literature.38–42 This is the first report in the area of DSSCs where the dye staining time is shortened and the dye loading is improved by applying a low potential (under 1 volt). The study shows better performance compared to the imidazole-based dyes reported in the literature (Table 1).6,29–37

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Phenanthrene-9,10-dione, titanium(IV)chloride, piperidine, t-amyl alcohol, and t-butyl alcohol were purchased from Spectrochem. 4,4′-Dibromobenzil, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (0) [Pd2dba3], 2-dicyclohexyl phosphino-2′,4′,6′-triisopropylbiphenyl (X-Phos) and terephthalaldehyde were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Ammonium acetate (NH4OAc), acetic acid and sodium hydroxide were obtained from Merck. P-anisidine, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), potassium phosphate tribasic (K3PO4), valeronitrile, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, iodine, lithium iodide, and cyanoacetic acid were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Titania (mp-TiO2) paste (18NR-T) and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass (MS001695-10) were purchased from GreatCell Solar Ltd., Australia. Ti-nanoxide R/SP (BN148/141117FM) was obtained from Solaronix. Laboratory grade solvents were used without further purification. Dried toluene was obtained by distilling laboratory grade toluene in the presence of Na–Ph2CO. CaH2 was used to distill N,N′-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Precoated silica gel sheets (obtained from Merck, Germany) were used to perform thin layer chromatography (TLC) monitoring of the running reactions. 100–200 mesh silica gel was used as the stationary phase in the column chromatography. A combination of ethyl acetate/dichloromethane (DCM) and hexanes was used as the mobile phase. The melting points of the synthesized dyes and the intermediates were obtained by the open capillary method and are reported uncorrected. IR spectra of the imidazole-based dyes were recorded with a JASCO FT/IR-4100 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer using a KBr cell. The 1H NMR (400 or 500 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 or 125 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer in CDCl3, acetone-d6 or DMSO-d6 solvent with tetramethyl silane as an internal standard. HRMS was recorded with a MICRO-Q TOF mass spectrometer using the ESI technique at 10 eV.
2.2. Instrumentation
UV-visible absorption spectra of DCM solutions of the dyes were recorded with a JASCO-V650 instrument. Spectra in the solid state were acquired using a JASCO-V570 instrument. Cyclic voltammetry of the dye in DMF (1 mM) was performed using a 5 mm diameter glassy carbon electrode (GCE), Ag/AgNO3 in acetonitrile and a platinum coil as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. 0.1 M TBAPF6 was used as the supporting electrolyte. The Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene (1 mM) in DMF. All the experiments were carried out in N2 saturated solutions using a Metrohm Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat. The active area of the DSSC was 0.196 cm2, which was illuminated using a solar simulator (LOT Technologies) containing a 150 W xenon lamp. In order to create 1 sun conditions, an AM 1.5 filter was placed between the DSSC device and the lamp. The spectral intensity of the solar simulator was adjusted using the short-circuit photocurrent of a silicon solar cell standard (Type: RC2-1010, SN: 0520160006, SPD Laboratory, Inc.). A black mask sticker with a circular opening was carefully centered over the active area of the DSSC. In addition, the edges of the DSSC were covered with the black mask. Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed using an Autolab 302N potentiostat with an FRA32M module.
2.3. Computational details
The UB3LYP43 functional with the 6-31G(d,p)44–47 basis set was chosen to carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the dyes. Using DFT studies, the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) as well as the energy difference between them (Eg) were measured.
2.4. Photoanode fabrication by the electrosorption method
In the electrosorption method, it is crucial to find a suitable potential at which dye adsorption on TiO2 is accelerated. To identify this potential, we monitored the potential of the photoanode when it was dipped in a dye solution using an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. As the dye adsorbs on TiO2, the double layer undergoes reconstruction around the photoanode; hence, the galvanic potential across the double layer changes with time. The potential measured at the end of 12 h was chosen as the potential to apply for the electrosorption. Upon applying the potential (chronoamperometry), a minimal background current flowed due to charging of the interface; it was found that within an hour of electrosorption, the dye loading surpassed the loading obtained using the conventional dye staining method. Note that the potential for electrosorption measurement is only required to be identified once for a given dye. Once the potential was identified, it was applied to fresh FTO/TiO2 electrodes to quickly generate photoanodes. The entire process is summarized in Scheme S1 in the, ESI.†
2.5. DSSC fabrication
FTO glass obtained from GreatCell Solar (MS001695-10) was cut into 2 × 1.5 cm−1 sized plates, which were immersed in detergent solution for 10 min. The detergent removed organic/greasy matter from the FTO plates. Further, the FTO plates were cleaned by subsequent sonication in distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol (20 min each). Finally, the cleaned FTO plates were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. Each plate was dip-coated with 40 mM aq. TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. After repeating the dip coating procedure 2 more times, the plate was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in an air oven. TiCl4 dip coating is mainly performed to avoid direct contact of the electrolyte of the DSSC with the FTO. Upon annealing, TiCl4 transformed into a transparent TiO2 layer. A piece of scotch tape containing a circular hole with an area of 0.196 cm2 was stuck to the surface of the dip-coated TiO2. This circular hole was filled with 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles by applying TiO2 paste with the doctor blade technique. After drying the TiO2 paste at 70 °C and peeling off the scotch tape, the plate was subjected to annealing at 500 °C for 30 min to realize a transparent TiO2 layer that was 6 μm thick (as measured by a profilometer).27 On this, a 5 μm-thick scattering layer of TiO2 was applied by the doctor blade technique, and the plate was sintered at 400 °C for 30 min to form a light reflecting layer. After cooling to 70 °C,36 the plate was immersed in 0.5 mM dye (1–5) in acetonitrile: t-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution and maintained at 25 °C for 12 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface. Another variant of the photoanode was fabricated using chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent. The co-adsorbent CDCA was used to reduce aggregation on the TiO2 surface during dye staining. The FTO/TiO2 was immersed in 0.5 mM dye (1–5) and 10 mM CDCA in acetonitrile:t-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution, then maintained at 25 °C for 12 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface. The photoanode was taken out of the dye bath and rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile to dislodge any unadsorbed dye from the electrodes. A 0.5 mm thick platinum sheet and photoanode were superimposed on each other with a hot melt polymer film as a gasket between the two electrodes. The gap between the photoanode and platinum sheet was filled with I−/I3− electrolyte. The electrolyte was composed of 0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.6 M and 0.5 M iodine, lithium iodide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and t-butyl pyridine, respectively, in 15:85 v/v% valeronitrile and acetonitrile mixed solvent.
2.6. Estimation of dye loading of the photoanodes
The photoanodes were immersed in 0.1 M NaOH in THF/H2O (1:1 v/v%) for 3 h to achieve complete desorption of dye from the electrode surface. Upon desorption, the absence of trace dye on FTO/TiO2 was ensured by recording a solid-state UV-Vis spectrum of the photoanode. The solutions containing the desorbed dye were subjected to UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Combining the absorbance obtained with the extinction coefficient of the dye, the concentration of the dye was calculated.

3. Results and discussion
A series of systematically tailored imidazole-based dyes were synthesized, and the synthetic routes are depicted in Schemes 1–3. The imidazole compounds 7 and 9 (with p-anisidine) were synthesized by treating commercially available dibromobenzil (6) with terephthalaldehyde, ammonium acetate and acetic acid (Scheme 1). The Suzuki coupling of 7 with 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid using palladium catalyst and X-Phos furnished compound 8. The aldehyde functionality in 8 then underwent Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid to afford dye 1. The same procedure was followed to obtain compound 10 and dye 2. The synthesis of cyclic aryl-substituted imidazole compounds 3 and 4 is shown in Scheme 2. 3,6-Dibromophenanthrene-9,10-dione (11) was synthesized according to a procedure reported in the literature.48 The first step of the synthesis was the multicomponent reactions of compound 11 with terephthalaldehyde and ammonium acetate in acetic acid medium, leading to the formation of imidazole intermediates 12 and 14 (with p-anisidine as an additional component), respectively. The methoxy phenyl donor group was incorporated through the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling method by reacting substituted imidazole compounds 12 and 14 with 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid. The obtained Suzuki coupled products, 13 and 15 respectively, were subjected to Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid to furnish the final compounds, dyes 3 and 4, respectively.

 Scheme 3  Synthesis of dye 5. 
For the synthesis of 4,5 dimethyl-substituted imidazole-based dye 5, the condensation of 2,3-butadione with terephthalaldehyde in acetic acid and ammonium acetate failed to yield the anticipated 2-aryl-imidazole intermediate 16. Several methods for the construction of the imidazole ring49–53 were explored for the preparation of 16; however, none of them were found to be useful. Finally, replacing acetic acid with trifluoroacetic acid was observed to be fruitful; it afforded the intermediate 16, although in poor yield (15%, Scheme 3). The obtained compound 16 was condensed with cyanoacetic acid to afford dye 5. All intermediates and final dyes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S15–S28, ESI†) and mass spectroscopy.
3.1. Optical properties
The absorption spectra of acyclic (1 and 2), cyclic aryl (3 and 4) and alkyl-substituted imidazole (5)-based dyes in dichloromethane solutions (1.6 × 10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 2, and the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) and molar extinction coefficient (ε) values are displayed in Table 2. Two types of absorption bands were observed for dyes 1 to 4. The band appearing in the range of 250–350 nm (higher energy region) corresponds to the π–π* transition, and the band appearing in the range of 370–500 nm (lower energy region) was due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) occurring from the donor to the acceptor moiety. In the case of dye 5, the absorption band is seen in the range of 320–440 nm, which is probably due to its less conjugated structure in comparison to dyes 1 to 4. In order to confirm the presence of ICT, absorption spectra of the dyes along with their corresponding aldehydes were recorded. The incorporation of the cyanoacetic acid moiety clearly red shifted the λmax, indicating the presence of ICT in the dye molecule, as presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The increase in λmax from dye 1 to dye 2 can be attributed to the anisole group embedded in the imidazole ring. For the same reason, a change in λmax was observed between dyes 3 and 4. The change in λmax between dyes 1 and 3 is 1 nm and that between dyes 2 and 4 is 10 nm. The λmax is higher for dye 4 in comparison to dye 2 because as shown in Fig. 3 (optimized structure of dyes 1 to 4 in the gas phase), the dihedral angle ∠C9 C12 C13 C14 is ∼176.88° for dye 4, which is nearly planar; this allows effective delocalization, causing a red shift in comparison to dye 2, which has ∠C1 C3 C4 C5 of 125°. The onset of the absorption spectra (λonset) of dyes 1 to 5 were 511, 490, 548, 518, and 446 nm, respectively. The obtained ε values and the onsets of the absorption spectra of all the dyes emphasize their good light harvesting abilities; thus, they are suitable for photovoltaic applications.

 Fig. 3  Dihedral angle (yellow color) in frontier orbital view of the imidazole cores of dyes 1 to 4. 
The absorption spectra of imidazole dyes 1 to 5 adsorbed on a transparent TiO2 film around 6 μm thick are displayed in Fig. 4, and the values are listed in Table 2. The absorption spectra are broad and red shifted (dyes 1, 3 and 4) in comparison to those of the corresponding dyes in solution. The red shift values of dyes 1, 3, and 4 were 18 nm, 68 nm, and 24 nm, respectively. This red shift of absorption indicates strong interactions between the imidazole-based dyes and the semiconductor TiO2 surface. This red shift is attributed to J aggregation of the dyes, which enhances the light harvesting in the visible region; this is favorable to achieve higher short circuit current density (JSC) in DSSCs.55 Dyes 2 and 5 show broad absorptions and blue shifting of 8 and 33 nm, respectively, compared to the solution state; this can be attributed to deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.55–57
 Fig. 4  UV-Visible spectra of synthesized dyes 1–5 on TiO2 film. 
From the solid-state UV-Vis spectra, it is clear that dye 2 is blue-shifted in comparison to dye 1; similarly, dye 4 is blue-shifted with respect to dye 3. This indicates that the introduction of freely rotating anisole groups prevents dye aggregation, resulting in the blue shift. Further evidence is shown in Table 3, where the dye loading of 2 and 4 is nearly one order of magnitude lower than that of the corresponding dyes devoid of the anisole moiety.

3.2. Electrochemical properties
To be suitable for DSSC applications, in addition to the necessary optical properties, dyes should possess appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels for seamless electron injection into the CB of TiO2 and dye regeneration by the electrolyte. The ground state oxidation potential (energy level) corresponding to the HOMO was measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements with a three-electrode setup. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the CV of imidazole-based dyes 1 to 5. The calculated HOMO, LUMO, and Eg values are listed in Table 2. The first oxidation potential was used to derive the energies of the HOMO levels of the imidazole-based dyes. There is not much difference in the oxidation potentials of dyes 1, 3 and 5. This is due to the fact that the HOMO orbital is mainly localized on the imidazole moiety attached to the biphenyl, phenanthrene and methyl groups in dyes 1, 3 and 5, respectively. Introduction of the anisole moiety in the imidazole ring of dyes 2 and 4 shifted the oxidation potentials to more positive values, from ∼1 to 1.28 V vs. NHE for dye 2 and from ∼1 to 1.25 V vs. NHE for dye 4. Dye 5 displays an irreversible oxidation peak, while the others show quasi reversible behaviour. The optical gap (Eg = 1240/λonset) can be calculated from the onset of the absorption spectrum. The LUMO energy values were estimated from the difference between the HOMO energy level and the optical gap (Eoxonset − Eg). The obtained LUMO values indicate that all the dyes (1–5) are capable of injecting an electron into the CB of TiO2. Additionally, the stability was analyzed through studying the electrochemical properties in DMF solution at different scan rates. All the imidazole-based dyes show electrochemically stable quasi-reversible peaks in the scanning region of 50–1000 mV s−1 (Fig. S3–S7, ESI†). The plot of the anodic peak current vs. the square root of the scan rate was linear for all the dyes, indicating that the oxidation of the dyes is a diffusion–controlled process (Fig. S8, ESI†).

Fig. 5 shows a schematic of the energy levels of the imidazole-based dyes with the TiO2 and electrolyte energy levels. Because the potential of the HOMO level of the dyes is more positive than that of I−/I3− electrolyte (0.4 V vs. NHE), efficient dye regeneration by I−/I3− from the electrolyte is feasible. The obtained potential of the LUMO of the dyes is favorable for electron injection into the CB of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE). These electrochemical data support the thermodynamic driving force for efficient dye regeneration and electron injection in DSSCs.
 Fig. 5  Schematic of the energy levels of the imidazole-based dyes, TiO2, and electrolyte. 
The ground (HOMO) and excited (LUMO) state energies of imidazole-based dyes 1 to 5 were calculated by employing DFT studies (UB3LYP/6-31G(d,p)), and the values are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in the frontier orbital diagram, the charge density in the HOMO levels of dyes 1 to 4 is localized mainly on the 4,5-subsituted imidazole part (donor moiety); however, it is shifted towards the cyanoacrylic acid (acceptor moiety) at the LUMO level. Possible complete charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO of dyes 1–4 can be clearly seen from the frontier orbital diagrams (Fig. S9, ESI†). For structure 5, the charge density is localized on the methyl-substituted imidazole and spacer part (HOMO), whereas in the LUMO, the charge density is on the spacer and cyanoacrylic acid part. In contrast to dyes 1–4, charge transfer is incomplete in the case of dye 5.
3.3. Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 6A depicts the current density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of dyes 1–5 measured under 1 sun simulated AM 1.5 irradiation. The photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 3. The short circuit current density (JSC) of dye 4 (12.15 mA cm−2) is higher than that of dye 3 (11.19 mA cm−2). This can be attributed to the anisole group present in the imidazole ring, which promotes charge transfer towards the anchoring group rather than the –NH group in dye 3. Further confirmation was obtained from the absorbance studies, wherein a substantial red shift in λmax was observed upon linking the anisole moiety in comparison to the λmax of the corresponding dye in the solution phase. However, in the case of biphenyl-substituted imidazole dye 2 (4.85 mA cm−2), JSC is lower than that of dye 1 (9.38 mA cm−2) because the insertion of the anisole group in dye 2 leads to a reduction in the dihedral angle from φ′ = 144.69 to φ′ = 125.83 (shown in Fig. 3), which is responsible for lowering the performance of dye 2 (Table 3).
 Fig. 6  
J–V characteristics of imidazole-based dyes in the absence and presence of CDCA under standard conditions. 
The JSC values are consistent with the absorption onsets of imidazole-based dyes on TiO2 films.58 When comparing the biphenyl (1 and 2) and phenanthrene (3 and 4)-substituted imidazoles, the latter shows higher JSC than the former, indicating that the cyclic system can increase the effective conjugation and reinforce more charge transfer than the freely rotating acyclic compounds. The predicted ICT from the frontier orbital diagram for dye 5 is very low, which leads to a lower JSC of 0.25 mA cm−2. All the aromatically substituted imidazole-based dyes show higher open circuit voltages (VOC) than the aliphatic compounds. Among the dyes, dye 2 (0.865 V) shows the highest VOC, suggesting that the presence of the lone pair on the nitrogen, the anisole group, the free-rotating imidazole group and the non-planar region (as inferred from the DFT studies) are beneficial to suppress the recombination of injected electrons at the dye–TiO2/electrolyte interface. Among all the dyes, the dye 4-based DSSC exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.71% (JSC = 12.15 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.838 V, FF = 0.659). This is the highest efficiency reported for imidazole-based dyes for DSSC applications.6,29–37 Under similar fabrication conditions, using metal-based ruthenium dye (N719) as a reference, a η of 7.62% was achieved (JSC = 14.62 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.803 V, FF = 0.649).
Furthermore, to ensure suppression of dye aggregation on TiO2, CDCA was used as a co-adsorbent. The electrical performance measured under simulated 1 sun conditions is displayed in Fig. 6B, and the calculated parameters are listed in Table 3. As expected, in the presence of CDCA, the JSC value increased from 12.15 to 13.07 mA cm−2 for dye 4 due to suppression of aggregation of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface.59 The order of the PCEs of the imidazole-based dyes explored in this study is 4 (7.16%) > 1 (5.91%) > 2 (5.43%) > 3 (5.39%) > 5 (0.43%). The reproducibility of the device performance was assessed by characterizing 6 cells with each dye. The box charts of the photovoltaic parameters of these devices (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†) indicate excellent reproducibility.
The cell stability of the fabricated DSSC was studied through J–V measurements by comparing the performance on the 1st, 30th and 60th days (Fig. 7 and Table S2, ESI†). Amongst dyes 1–5, dye 4 was found to be stable up to the 30th day; when the same cell was measured on the 60th day, there was a ∼31% drop in efficiency. To achieve long-term stability of the device, dye desorption from the TiO2 surface due to iodide ion or trace amounts of water in the electrolyte must be suppressed.60 In this study, the dye was adsorbed from ACN and TBA (1:1 v/v%) solution, and the electrolyte contained a valeronitrile and ACN mixture (15:85 v/v%) solution. The dye desorption energy is dependent on the solvent; hence, the equilibrium concentration of dye molecules on TiO2 can be very different in different solvent environments. The efficiency decreased between the 1st, 30th and 60th days (Fig. 7), which is possibly due to dye desorption from TiO2 to reach another steady state due to the change of the solution (i.e. different from the dye solution used for staining TiO2) in contact with the TiO2–dye interface.60 Because this desorbed dye cannot participate in light harvesting, a noticeable decrease in the performance of the DSSC is observed. Overall, the imidazole-based dyes sustain stability with less decrease in efficiency. Moreover, we are optimizing the electrode preparation and electrolyte composition to further extend the stability of the DSSCs.
 Fig. 7  Stability data of dye 4 through J–V curves recorded on the 1st, 30th and 60th days. 
3.4. Impedance studies
The EIS results (Nyquist plots) of the imidazole-based dyes with and without CDCA are displayed in Fig. 8A and B and Fig. S12 (ESI†). The R values correspond to the contact-cum-electrolyte resistance. The first semicircle (R1) is attributed to charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, while the second semicircle (R2) is accorded to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Table 4). The second semicircle in the middle frequency range reflects the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface while shining light under 1 sun conditions. The equivalent circuit used for fitting is given in the insets to Fig. 8A and B. At the open circuit potential generated at 1 sun condition, the transport resistance in TiO2 layer would be negligible because the Fermi level is closer to the CB and the trap states are occupied. Hence, the transmission line model61 can be simplified, as shown in the insets to Fig. 8A and B. In open circuit conditions under 1 sun illumination, the R2 of the photoanode signifies the back-electron recombination rate. This is also a function of the open circuit voltage. Table 3 reports that the VOC values of the DSSCs fabricated with dyes 2 and 4 decreased if the dye adsorption was performed in the presence of CDCA. Because the VOC value is significantly lower in the presence of CDCA for dye 2, the driving force for the back-electron transfer (through the TiO2/dye–electrolyte interface) was lower in the presence of CDCA. This is clearly reflected in the diameters of the 2nd semicircle of the DSSCs fabricated with (56.7 Ohm) and without (35.5 Ohm) CDCA (Table 4). For dye 4, because VOC is almost the same both in the presence and absence of CDCA, there is not much variation in the diameter of the 2nd semicircle. In contrast, for the DSSCs containing dyes 1 and 3, the VOC is enhanced in the presence of CDCA. Hence, the driving force for the electron recombination increases, leading to smaller semicircles in comparison to their CDCA-free counterparts.

In all the DSSCs, in the presence of CDCA, the concentration of the dye on TiO2 decreases by nearly one to two orders of magnitude; this is helpful in reducing aggregation-induced quenching of excitons, thereby allowing effective electron injection into the CB of TiO2. Note that the dye loading of dyes 2 and 4 is nearly one order of magnitude lower than that of dyes 1 and 3; this is due to the freely rotating anisole moiety, which prevents dye aggregation. Among the photoanodes, those fabricated with dyes 1 and 3 had a maximum decrease in dye loading (about 2 to 1.5 orders of magnitude) while co-adsorbing the dye with CDCA; hence, the trap states introduced by CDCA62 by adsorption on TiO2 were maximal for the photoanodes with dyes 1 and 3. These trap states negatively affect the lifetime of the electron (τ) in the CB of TiO2 and the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) (Table 4).

Fig. 8C, D and Fig. S12 (ESI†) show the Bode phase plots recorded under illumination conditions for the DSSCs fabricated with imidazole-based dyes. The electron lifetimes in the CB of TiO2 obtained from these plots were in the order 2* (15.92 ms) > 1* (12.6 ms) > 3* (10 ms) > 4* (7.96 ms). The higher electron lifetimes observed for dyes 1* and 2* suggest the beneficial role of non-planar substituted imidazole compounds in hindering the approach of the electrolyte towards TiO2;32 hence, dye 2* showed the highest VOC among the dyes.29
3.5. IPCE studies
Based on the wavelength-dependent J–V curves, the calculated IPCEs of the DSSCs containing the imidazole-based dyes with CDCA as the coadsorbent are displayed in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Similar to the UV-vis absorption spectra, two broad bands can be seen in the IPCE spectra of dyes 1 to 4 and one band in that of dye 5. The onset of the IPCE spectrum of dye 1 appears at 574 nm, that of dye 2 appears at 525 nm, that of dye 3 appears at 635 nm, that of dye 4 appears at 603 nm and that of dye 5 appears at 449 nm. The changes in the IPCE spectra are consistent with the absorption spectra of the imidazole-based dyes on TiO2 film. The IPCE value of dye 3 at 451 nm (69%) is slightly lower than that of dye 4 (74%), suggesting that the anisole moiety present in the imidazole ring converts more photons to current than the –NH group of imidazole. In contrast, dye 1 (65%) shows higher IPCE than dye 2 (62%) due to the non-planarity of dye 2. There is no electron-rich π–π conjugation in dye 5 (20%), which leads to a lower IPCE value. Generally, one expects a close match between the solid-state UV-Vis spectra and IPCE. However, due to the presence of I−/I3− and other aromatic compounds in the electrolyte, there is a possibility of a mismatch between the solid-state UV-vis and IPCE spectra as the components of the electrolyte absorb the light. The iodine electrolyte absorbs in the region from 300 to 400 nm (Fig. S13, ESI†). Therefore, the peak seen at around 350 nm in the IPCE spectra is a combination of the responses of the dye and electrolyte. Because the light is mostly adsorbed by I3− (at <450 nm), only a fraction of the applied light intensity may be available for photocurrent generation in the wavelength range from 300 to 420 nm. Beyond 450 nm, the trend in the solid-state UV-Vis spectra qualitatively matches that of the IPCE spectra.
3.6 Electrosorption to enhance dye loading and DSSC performance
Generally, dye adsorption from a bath on FTO/TiO2 requires about 12 to 24 h for the dyes to adsorb completely on the surface of the TiO2. Herein, we introduce a novel potential-assisted method (electrosorption) which decreases the dye adsorption time to as short as 1 h while retaining the same or higher DSSC performance. In order to execute electrosorption, it is important to identify the correct potential to expedite dye adsorption. The suitable potential was identified for dye 4, as discussed in Section 2.6 and shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). The identified electrosorption potentials of dyes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are −0.44 V, −0.44 V, −0.04 V and −0.06 V, respectively. The identified potential vs. Ag/Ag+, i.e. −0.060 V (dye 4), was used to carry out chronoamperometry for 1 h on a fresh FTO/TiO2 electrode immersed in a dye bath. This chronoamperometry is called the potential-assisted dye adsorption method or electrosorption in this study.
DSSC devices were fabricated using photoanodes made by the electrosorption technique, and their J–V curves were recorded (Fig. 9). The electrical parameters obtained and calculated along with the dye loading obtained in the electrosorption process are displayed in Table 5. The efficiency of dyes 3 and 4 was greatly enhanced by the electrosorption process, which is in line with the observations made by the IPCE measurements (Fig. S13, ESI†) and Rs values reported in Table 4. For instance, the electrical properties of the DSSC with dye 4 attached by electrosorption (JSC = 13.38 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.849 V, FF = 0.713, η = 8.10%) are better than those of the DSSC containing a photoanode fabricated by a conventional dye staining method (JSC = 13.07 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.831 V, FF = 0.659, η = 7.16%). DSSCs containing photoanodes generated by the potential-assisted staining method showed higher efficiency (from 7.16% to 8.10%) than those with photoanodes generated by the conventional staining method. This is probably due to the 18% enhancement in dye loading in comparison to the conventional dyeing process. Earlier, our group reported improved DSSC performance for the dyes N719, Z907, D2d27 and TSB-C63 while employing electrosorption-based dye staining. We believe that the application of voltage changed the double layer around the electrode and, hence, the surface energy of the electrode. This change in surface energy may have accelerated the dye adsorption process.

Moreover, the applied potential may enhance the electrosorption of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface because it can influence the following esterification equilibrium:  
This would enhance the dye coverage on the TiO2 surface. In addition, the applied potential can improve the wetting of the TiO2 surface by the dye solution because it can change the surface energy of the TiO2 surface.
To best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the area of DSSCs on improving dye loading by electrosorption on the photoanode (FTO/TiO2) with application of a potential less than ∼1 V. A few other methods of enhanced dye loading have been reported in the literature. For instance, Mamun et al.38 explored the vapor phase deposition of carboxylate dye on TiO2 to significantly reduce the dye deposition time in comparison to that of the conventional dip-coating method. They were able to enhance the PCE from 4.36% to 5.03% for (4-(diphenylamino) phenyl)thiophene-2cyanoacrylic acid and for 3-(5-(4-(diphenylamino)styryl)thiophen-2-yl)-2cyanoacrylic acid from 5.35% to 5.46%. Hyunwoong Seo et al.39 reported a faster dye adsorption process wherein voltages between 500 and 10000 V were applied for 3 h across two conducting metal plates placed 15 mm apart in a 0.2 mM N719 dye solution. A TiO2-coated FTO plate was inserted close to the positive plate. The applied voltages created an electric field in the solution, which was expected to pull the negatively charged dye species towards the positively charged plate. According to the authors, this applied field increases the density of dye molecules near the positively charged plate, causing rapid dyeing of the TiO2/FTO plate. The authors reported a PCE of ∼5% with a VOC value of ∼0.8 V. Although the absorbance of the photoanode increased under the electric field, the actual dye loadings were not provided. The same authors reported a larger DSSC with an area of 12 cm2 and an VOC of 0.65 V.40 In addition to this, Jin et al.41 showed electrosorption of Alizarin red (AR) from an aqueous solution of pH 12.6 at 0.6 V. When the potential was applied for 600 minutes, AR loading on the TiO2/carbon aerogel increased from 2.16 to 3.58 mg cm−2. Similarly, electrosorption was demonstrated for the removal of polycyclic dye (basic blue-7) from aqueous solution.42
In contrast to the dye adsorption techniques reported in the literature, it is evident from the current experimental results that this proposed potential-assisted method enhances the rate of dye adsorption from 12 h to 1 h under the OCP used. Dye 4 showed a 13% enhancement of its original efficiency compared to the conventional dye staining method. The photoanodes prepared by the potential-assisted method possess high dye loading, and the corresponding DSSCs possess higher efficiency than the DSSCs fabricated with photoanodes obtained by a conventional dye soaking process.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized new imidazole-based dyes that are devoid of triphenylamine units, a residue that is usually used as an electron-donating substituent. The optoelectronic properties of the dyes were thoroughly investigated by UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry studies. The UV-vis spectra of the dyes and their corresponding aldehydes clearly indicate a red shift in λmax upon attaching the cyanoacetic acid moiety. This experiment clearly reveals the presence of ICT on these molecules. In comparison to the parent dyes (1 and 3), the dyes with the anisole-substituted imidazole (2 and 4) exhibited red-shifts in solution state absorption and positive shifts in oxidation potential due to electron delocalization by the anisole moiety. These molecules were successfully applied in DSSCs as light absorbers. Among these, dye 4 showed a PCE of 7.16%. When dye 4 was applied on a TiO2 surface by the potential-assisted method, the dye loading was enhanced by 18%; as a result, the PCE was enhanced to 8.10%. To the best of our knowledge, dye 4 synthesized herein shows the highest PCE among imidazole-based dyes reported to date. The new potential-assisted dye staining method will pave the way for attaining high efficiency in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells.
