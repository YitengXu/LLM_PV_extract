    , Accepted 25th September 2017First published on 27th September 2017AbstractA simple molecular structure of ortho-derived perylene diimide (PDI) diploid (oo-2PDI), a PDI derivative, as well as two bay-derived PDI diploids (bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI), was designed and efficiently synthesized by efficient Ullmann coupling reactions. The photophysical and electrochemical properties indicate that oo-2PDI exhibits much stronger absorption than bb-2PDI in the visible region and a slightly higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, which are beneficial for harvesting much sunlight and improving open circuit voltage in the organic solar cell (OSC) devices. On using PTB7-Th with appropriate energy level alignment and well matched absorption as the electron donor, the active layer of PTB7-Th:oo-2PDI exhibits a favorable morphology, higher carrier mobilities and more balanced carrier transport. As a result, the device based on PTB7-Th:oo-2PDI shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 8.30% and a high short circuit current (JSC) of 18.79 mA cm−2, which are much higher than those of the other two PDI diploids (bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI), highlighting the potential of ortho-derived PDI diploid to realize high efficiency non-fullerene OSCs. Such a concise molecular structure and the high efficiency make this compound promising for practical applications in OSCs.
Introduction
Non-fullerene electron acceptors, due to their strong light absorption, tunable chemical structure, and accessible synthesis, have attracted much attention in organic solar cells (OSCs).1–15 After a long period of investigation, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, as the first electron acceptor materials in OSCs,16,17 have realized great success in the past two years and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are even superior to those of classic fullerene-based OSCs,10,11,18–21 which indicates that the PDI derivatives have great potential to be electron acceptors for high efficiency OSCs. That is to say, the rational modification of the molecular structure, which directly relates to the molecular solubility, optoelectronic properties, film micromorphology, and charge mobility, is the crucial issue to determine the efficiencies in OSCs.

PDI diploids,22–24 one of the important PDI derivatives, are directly bonded by the singly, doubly, or triply linked bonds between the two PDI monomers. Among them, the PDI diploid linked by a single bond has successfully realized high efficiency non-fullerene OSCs with the maximum PCE of about 5.3% because of the better matching energy levels, flexibility and twisted structures.25–27 Furthermore, the singly-linked PDI diploid could be used as a building block to construct new PDI derivatives for higher efficiency OSCs. One of the most effective strategies is the incorporation of the heteroatoms S, N, or Se into bay positions of the PDI frameworks, which has a remarkable effect on both the inter- and intramolecular properties. Ultimately, the PCE values in the non-fullerene OSCs are up to 7.1%, 7.6% and 8.4% for the S, N, and Se annulated derivatives, respectively,28–30 which are much higher than that of the PDI diploid. All these results indicate that the PDI diploid and its derivatives could realize high efficiencies in non-fullerene OSCs. However, it should be noted that all these PDI diploids are based on bay-linked derivatives, whereas ortho-derived PDI derivatives used in high efficiency non-fullerene OSCs are rarely investigated,10,31–33 because the ortho positions of PDI are less reactive toward electrophilic substitutions than the bay ones.34–36 Even so, several ortho-derived PDI derivatives had achieved superior photovoltaic performance, because they show better planarity and maintain the prototypically optical and electronic nature of the PDI monomer.10,31 Inspired by these encouraging achievements of the bay-derived PDI diploids, we have a strong desire to investigate whether ortho-derived PDI diploids can achieve high efficiency non-fullerene OSCs.
Herein, a simple molecular structure of the PDI diploid acceptor (oo-2PDI) (Scheme 1), which was connected directly by the singly-linked bond via the ortho-position of the PDI monomers, was developed and characterized in detail. For comparison, two PDI diploids, one is a bay-derived one (bb-2PDI) and the other is a bay-position connected with the ortho-position one (bo-2PDI), were synthesized in this work. From the point of molecular design, we chose herringbone 3-pentylamine to functionalize the imide position of PDI. On one hand, the herringbone PDI acceptors undergo more rapid charge separation than other stacked PDI ones.33 Moreover, due to the steric hindrance effect, the shorter alkyl chains, rather than the longer ones, are beneficial for charge transport. On the other hand, the price of commercial 3-pentylamine is very low, while the other amines are usually synthesized through several synthetic steps or bought from the suppliers at an expensive price. Thereby, N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimide (PDI) should be a potential building block to develop PDI derivatives for high performance OSCs. As a result, the device based on PTB7-Th:oo-2PDI shows a PCE as high as 8.30% and a high short circuit current (JSC) of 18.79 mA cm−2. The optimized PCE is much higher than those of the bay-derived PDI diploids,9,10,18,20 which demonstrates that the ortho-derived PDI diploid, with a simple molecular structure, has great potential to be electron acceptors in future OSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI are shown in Scheme 1. For the parent PDI, there are two different reactive positions of ortho-(o-) and bay-(b-) positions. Because the bay positions of PDI are more reactive toward electrophilic substitutions, a bay-substituted bromo-PDI derivative (Br-b-PDI) was easily synthesized with high a yield.37 While ortho-substituted PDI derivatives are difficult to obtain due to their low reactive properties. Fortunately, the new catalytic systems of Ru- and Ir-based catalysts that specifically catalyzed the ortho-positions of PDI provide an opportunity to synthesize this type of PDI derivative.34–36,38 Therefore, at first, we chose the Ir-based catalyst system to synthesize the ortho-derived PDI borates.38 After a 48 h reaction, B-o-PDI, which is an important intermediate, was obtained with a yield about 40% by silica gel column chromatography. Then ortho-derived bromo-PDI was produced with a high yield. Finally, two compounds bb-2PDI and oo-2PDI were synthesized through classical Ullmann coupling reactions with high yields of 76% and 66%, respectively, while bo-2PDI was synthesized through the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with a yield of 59%. Three compounds were fully characterized with 1H-, 13C-NMR and MALDI-TOF/MS (ESI†). In addition, although the alkyl connected with the imide position of the PDI is short, three compounds exhibit good solubility in chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and chloroform at room temperature, which is attributed to the rigidity of the conjugated framework in which the steric hindrance results in a non-coplanar structure. As demonstrated by quantum-chemical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) (Fig. S1, ESI†), the dihedral angles between the two PDI monomers are of 70, 67, and 87° for bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI, respectively. The thermal stability of the compounds was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the results are presented in Fig. 1. All the compounds bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI show good thermal stability with 5% weight-loss at temperatures (Td) of 189.5, 343.8, and 228.6 °C, respectively.

Optical properties
The ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the compounds in dilute dichloromethane solution (10−5 M) and thin films are recorded in Fig. 2 and Table 1. In solution (Fig. 2a), bo-2PDI and oo-2PDI show narrow spectra from 450 nm to 550 nm similar to those of the prototype PDI, while bb-2PDI shows a broadened absorption band in the range of 400 to 600 nm. Furthermore, bo-2PDI and oo-2PDI exhibit strong absorption in the visible region at the same maximum absorption peak of 529 nm with the high maximum molar extinction coefficients of 1.3 × 105 and 1.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which are over two times of that of bb-2PDI. In thin films (Fig. 2b), all the absorption spectra have a slight red shift of about 6 nm compared with those in solution. And the values of the red shift are smaller than that of PDI (15 nm), which indicates that the diploids can reduce the intermolecular aggregation. Thus, all the compounds show much broadened absorption bands with the absorption edges over 600 nm. In addition, the donor polymer PTB7-Th strongly absorbs in the wavelength range from 550 to 750 nm, which is matched well with these diploids and will enhance light harvesting in the range of the solar spectra.

Electrochemical properties and theoretical calculations
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is employed to investigate their electrochemical properties (Fig. 3a). Both bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI exhibit four reduction waves in dichloromethane, while oo-2PDI gives two reduction waves, as the PDI monomer does. From the onset reduction potentials, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are estimated to be −3.99, −4.02, and −3.90 eV for bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI, respectively. The LUMO level of oo-2PDI, slightly higher than those of the other two devices, is close to that of PDI, which indicates that the ortho-derived PDI derivatives retain the prototypically electronic nature of the PDI monomer while bay-derived PDI derivatives does not. To obtain further insights into the electronic structures of bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI and oo-2PDI, their geometries were optimized by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level. As shown in Fig. 3b, similar to that of PDI, the LUMO and HOMO electron densities of bb-2PDI and oo-2PDI mainly distribute equally on the two PDI monomers, while for bo-2PDI, the LUMO electron density is mainly located on the ortho-connected PDI unit and the HOMO electron density is mainly located on the bay-connected PDI unit, which indicates that when the molecule is excited, intramolecular charge transfer can occur from ortho-connected PDI to the bay-connected PDI unit. The calculated LUMO levels are −3.84, −3.85 and −3.67 eV for bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI and oo-2PDI, respectively, for which the regularity is consistent with the experimental data.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to estimate the ortho-derived PDI diploids' photovoltaic properties, non-fullerene OSCs were fabricated with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, or oo-2PDI/MoO3/Al, where ITO denotes indium tin oxide and ZnO and MoO3 were used as the n- and p-type interfacial layers, respectively, to facilitate charge transport and collection. PTB7-Th, which has complementary absorption with the electron acceptors (Fig. 2b) and well matched energy levels, was chosen as the electron donor. Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and the photovoltaic performance data are listed in Table 2 for a clear comparison. Firstly, the devices with varying PTB7-Th/oo-2PDI mass ratios from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 were prepared and tested. The solar cells with a 1:1 blend ratio show an optimized average PCE of 5.83% with a JSC of 14.87 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.784 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 50.0%. Under the same conditions, the other two devices based on bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI exhibit relatively low PCEs of 5.03% and 1.71%, respectively.

To further enhance the performance of devices, some additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), chloronaphthalene (CN), and diphenyl ether (DPE) are often used to improve the morphology of the blend films. In our system with the optimal D/A weight ratio of 1:1 (Table 3 and Fig. 4), when utilizing different amounts of DIO as the processing additive, all the blend films showed optimal photovoltaic performance, while the PCEs after adding CN and DPE are not improved. It is found that the addition of 1% DIO can dramatically improve the JSC of devices from 14.87 to 18.79 mA cm−2, accompanied by a slight increase of the VOC and FF values for oo-2PDI-based devices. Therefore, the device based on PTB7-Th:oo-2PDI (1:1) with 1% DIO additive shows the best performance: a JSC of 18.79 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.799 V, FF of 55.3%, and PCE of 8.30% (average PCE over 20 devices: 8.12%). At the same time, we also optimized the devices based on bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI (Tables S1 and S2†). As a result, the devices based on PTB7-Th:bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI with a weight ratio of 1:1 and 1% DIO additive give the improved PCEs of 6.41% with a JSC of 16.70 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.780 V, an FF of 49.2% and 2.01% with a JSC of 7.63 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.669 V, and an FF of 39.4%. The PCE of 8.30% for the device based on oo-2PDI is about 30% higher than that (6.41%) of the bb-2PDI and three times higher than that (2.01%) of bo-2PDI. And the high JSC value (>18 mA cm−2) is comparable with those (15–19 mA cm−2) of the fullerene OSCs based on PTB7-Th/PC71BM.40,41 More importantly, we note that the state-of-art performance with a concise structure is much higher than those of the PDI diploid derivatives and even comparable with the best bay-derived Se annulated PDI diploid.28–30,32,42 Furthermore, due to the low FF values (<0.6) in the OSC devices, the performance has the potential to be further improved.

The high JSC values of the devices with 1% DIO additive can be confirmed from their incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimized devices (Fig. 4b). Along with the broad photo response from 300 to 800 nm, both devices based on oo-2PDI and bb-2PDI show strong photoresponses at 520 nm with the maximum values about 80% and 75%, respectively, while the device based on bo-2PDI exhibits weak photoresponses below 40%, which indicates that the device based on bo-2PDI gives lower PCE than those of the other two devices. The spectral shape of the IPCE curves is similar to that of the absorption spectra of blend films, which reveals that the IPCE and JSC are contributed by both donors and acceptors. The integrated short circuit currents from the IPCE spectra are 15.83, 7.74, and 18.54 mA cm−2 for devices based on bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI, respectively, which are consistent with experimental data obtained from the J–V measurement with a small deviation of less than 5%.
PL quenching and carrier mobilities
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching of the thin blend films was measured to determine the percentage of excitons that can reach and dissociate at the donor/acceptor interface (Fig. 5). From Fig. 5a, it can be seen that the pure film of oo-2PDI gives a strong fluorescent emission, while the pure films of bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI show relatively weak fluorescent emission. When blended with the donor PTB7-Th, all blend films exhibit almost completely quenched fluorescent intensity with the fluorescence quenching of 94.2%, 92.6% and 98.6% for the blend films based on bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5b, compared with the pure film of PTB7-Th, the fluorescence quenching of PTB7-Th with 90.5%, 86.2 and 92.1% were obtained for the blend films based on bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI, respectively. All these results indicate that the non-radiant electron transfer occurs efficiently at the interfaces of the donors and the acceptors, especially for the blend film based on oo-2PDI.

To further investigate the carrier transport properties of the devices under the optimal conditions, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole and electron mobilities with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/Active layer/Ca/Al, respectively.43 In their SCLC devices (Fig. S2, ESI†), the high hole mobilities of 1.12 × 10−4, 7.89 × 10−5, and 1.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for PTB7-Th:bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI blend films, respectively. And in their electron-only devices, the electron mobilities of 2.24 × 10−5, 1.49 × 10−5, and 5.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for PTB7-Th:bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI blend films, respectively. Comparing the hole mobilities with the electron ones, the former ones are all much higher than those of the latter corresponding ones. And the ratios of hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) are 5.3, 5.0, and 2.1 for PTB7-Th:bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI blend films, respectively. Obviously, the blend film based on PTB7-Th:oo-2PDI possesses the higher electron mobility, which is about two times higher than those of the other two solar cells. Therefore, the more efficient non-radiant electron transfer, higher carrier mobilities and more balanced carrier transport can partially explain the better solar cell performance observed in the oo-2PDI-based solar cells than the other two solar cells.
Morphological characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were used to investigate the morphologies of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 6, the surface of the blend films is smooth and uniform with a similar small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.68, 0.64, and 0.74 nm for PTB7-Th:bb-2PDI, bo-2PDI, and oo-2PDI, respectively, indicating that the favorable morphology is beneficial for the high charge mobility. From the height images, the blend films based on bb-2PDI and bo-2PDI showed a much bigger aggregation domain than the oo-2PDI-based device. As a result, the homogeneity of hole and electron domains based on oo-2PDI is much superior to those of the other two domains, which would provide continuous pathways for the charge separation and transport. In the TEM images, there is no large-size aggregation observed for the three blend films. Among them, the film based on bo-2PDI showed a relatively bigger aggregation domain than those of the other two films and the oo-2PDI-based blend film exhibited an obvious fibrillar structure, which is similar to those of the AFM images. These results agree well with the increased FF and JSC observed and therefore the highest PCE in PTB7-Th:oo-2PDI devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a simple molecular structure of PDI derivatives, an ortho-derived PDI diploid oo-2PDI, was designed and efficiently synthesized with high yield. Due to the unique properties of ortho-position functionalized PDI possessing better planarity and retaining the prototypically optical and electronic nature of the PDI monomer, oo-2PDI exhibits a much higher maximum molar extinction coefficient than that of bb-2PDI in the region from 400 to 600 nm. And the LUMO level (−3.9 eV) of oo-2PDI is slightly higher than that (about −4.0 eV) of bb-2PDI, which is beneficial for higher VOC in OSCs. Benefiting from the appropriate energy level alignment and favorable morphology, the device based on PTB7-Th:oo-2PDI by using a small amount of 1% DIO as the additive gives the best PCE of 8.30% with a JSC as high as 18.79 mA cm−2, which are about 30% higher than those of the bay-derived PDI diploid bb-2PDI. These observations demonstrate that the ortho-derived PDI diploid with such a concise molecular structure and high PCE, holds great promise as an electron acceptor for practical applications in future OSCs.

PTB7-Th is purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc., while other commercially available reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Alfa Aesar Co., TCI chemical Co., and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Solvents for chemical synthesis were purified according to standard procedures. All chemical reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere. The indium-tin oxide (ITO) on glass was purchased from Xiangcheng Science and Technology Co. Ltd. All chemical reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 500 MHz Bruker in CDCl3 at 293 K using TMS as a reference. Accurate mass correction was performed with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (MALDI micro MX). UV-vis spectra were measured with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Model HP8453) in a 1 cm quartz cell. PL spectra were measured with a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) on the glass substrates. TEM images were obtained on a Tecnai F30 (FEI) microscope at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on a BSA100B/W electrochemical workstation using glassy carbon discs as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, the Hg/Hg2Cl2 electrode as the reference electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. 0.05 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) dissolved in dichloromethane was employed as the supporting electrolyte, which was calibrated by the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the redox couple. The energy of Fc/Fc+ is 5.08 eV relative to vacuum.39 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow of 20 mL min−1. Geometry optimizations were optimized by the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program. To simplify the calculation, alkyl chains were replaced by CH3 groups.

Devices fabrication and testing
The ITO glass plates were cleaned in a sonication bath in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water sequentially, dried by blowing nitrogen, and then treated with O2 plasma for 15 min before use. An about 25 nm thick ITO-modifying layer of ZnO was spin-coated on top of ITO and then baked for 30 min at 200 °C. Then the PTB7-Th and bb-2PDI (bo-2PDI, or oo-2PDI) blend liquid was spin-coated on the ZnO layer to get an 80 nm thick film. Finally, MoO3 and Al layers were evaporated on top of the active layer. The device area, the overlapping section between the ITO and Al electrodes, was 7 mm.2 The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source-measure unit under illumination of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator (Newport USA, Model: 94023A) with an AM 1.5 filter in ambient air. The IPCE characterization of all devices was performed in ambient air by a Hypermono-light (SM-25, Jasco Co. Ltd., Japan). A calibrated Si photodiode (818-UV Newport) was used as a reference in order to determine the intensity of the light incident on the device, allowing the IPCE spectrum to be deduced.
