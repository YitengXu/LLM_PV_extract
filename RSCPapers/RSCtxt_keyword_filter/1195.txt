    , Accepted 17th October 2013First published on 17th October 2013AbstractWe have synthesized symmetrical and unsymmetrical Zn-phthalocyanine derivatives (PZnPc, MPZnPc and TPZnPc) for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Steady state and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence studies were performed in DMF solvent and on a TiO2 surface. The mode and extent of aggregation (H- and J-aggregates) of ZnPc adsorbed on a TiO2 surface were demonstrated. MPZnPc shows both H- and J-aggregation, while TPZnPc shows only H-aggregation. Moreover, the fluorescence of ZnP/TiO2 was completely quenched and this was assigned to electron injection from excited ZnPc to TiO2. Energy level calculations show both ZnPc deriviatives have enough driving force to inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. Furthermore, the radical cation of ZnPc was observed in nanosecond transient absorption measurements.
1. Introduction
Since Grätzel et al. developed dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991, much attention has been paid to them due to the relatively high solar energy conversion efficiency (η = 11%) and potential low cost.1 As part of this work, several research groups have been devoted to exploring efficient dyes in order to improve the cell performance to over 11% efficiency. So far, many dyes have been tested for this; among them Ru-complexes and porphyrin derivatives show improved power conversion efficiency.2 Recently, Yeh, Diau and Grätzel et al. reported a YD2-based solar cell (so-called porphyrin sensitized solar cells, PSSCs) with an overall efficiency3 exceeding ∼12%. On the other hand, in DSSCs, light harvesting is a crucial factor, i.e., the sensitizer should be able to accomplish efficient absorption in the visible to near IR (NIR) region of the solar spectrum.
Therefore, the synthesis of NIR-absorbing dyes has become a more interesting topic, since the solar photon flux is higher in that region.4a Therefore, many efforts have been focused on the design and synthesis of various dyes. Among the dyes under investigation, porphyrins4b are considered as some of the most efficient sensitizers for DSSC applications because of the vital roles of porphyrin derivatives in the photosynthesis, the strong absorption in the visible region, and the ease of modification of the chemical structures for light harvesting. Similarly, phthalocyanines are also attractive to researchers because of their intense absorption in the NIR, and their outstanding photochemical and thermal stability, which are advantageous for DSSCs.5a,b In 2010, Mori and co-workers6a reported 4.6% power conversion efficiency for phthalocyanine-based solar cells. Recently, Grätzel et al. have reported the highest power conversion efficiency6b of 6.1% for phthalocyanine bearing carboxyethynyl anchoring ligands.
On the other hand, in the literature, it is well known that phthalocyanines exhibit strong aggregation7 and this limits the usage of phthalocyanine and its derivatives in DSSCs, in spite of their strong NIR absorption, and chemical and thermal stability. The mode of aggregation of phthalocyanine derivatives on a TiO2 surface is yet to be resolved. At this juncture, it is necessary to understand the mode and extent of aggregation of phthalocyanine derivatives on a TiO2 surface. In the present work, we have synthesized symmetrical (TPZnPc) and unsymmetrical (MPZnPc) Zn-phthalocyanine derivatives having tetra-carboxyl and mono-carboxyl anchoring groups, respectively. The aggregation behavior, mode (H- and J- aggregation) and the extent of aggregation were studied. The interfacial electron injection/recombination dynamics of ZnPc on TiO2 film were also studied by time-resolved absorption and emission techniques.
2. Experimental section
All the solvents were purchased from Fischer Scientific and used without further purification and the materials employed in the synthesis were purchased from Aldrich. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) for electrochemical studies was purchased from Alfa Aesar. For spectroscopic studies, we used HPLC grade solvents. DMF was used as the solvent for all photophysical studies.

Synthesis of zinc phthalocyanine derivatives. 
ZnPc derivatives were synthesized by employing conventional methods. The hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) acts as a nitrogen source, which involves the cyclization of phthalonitriles co-ordinated by the zinc metal ion. Generally, regioisomers of phthalocyanines are obtained, which cannot be separated by column chromatography. The synthesis of unsymmetrical phthalocyanine yields mono and disubstituted derivatives that can be separated by column chromatography. The 1H NMR spectral lines of ZnPc derivatives are broad due to aggregation.

4-Phenoxyphthalonitrile (0.74 g, 3.36 mmol) was mixed with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) (1.4 ml, 6.64 mmol), ZnCl2 (0.11 g, 0.85 mmol) and 0.85 ml of DMF under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was heated to 100 °C for 10 h with constant stirring. The product obtained was washed with water and dried. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using petroleum ether–chloroform (v/v, 1:1) as the eluent.

2.2. TiO2 film preparation and dye coating
4 μm TiO2 nanocrystalline films were prepared from a commercially available TiO2 paste (Solaronix SA, Ti-nanoxide HT/SC series). This paste was deposited on a transparent glass substrate using the doctor blade technique. The prepared films were annealed for 30 min at 450 °C. The TiO2 films were sensitized in a 50 μM ZnPc solution at room temperature for 5 h. After removal from the ZnPc bath, the non-adsorbed molecules were washed off by rinsing the film with the same solvent and the film was dried at room temperature for ∼20 s.
2.3. Experimental setup
The IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific NICOLET iS5 model using iD1 transmission with KBr pellets. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 MHz instrument. HR-MS was recorded on a Micromass Q-TOF microanalyzer with a Q-TOF LockSpray dual electrospray source.
The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-vis diode-array spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectral measurements were carried out using a FluoroMax-4 spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Time-resolved picosecond fluorescence decay measurements were obtained by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, R3809U) as a detector and the second harmonic (410 nm) was used as the excitation source. The instrument response function for the TCSPC system is 50 ps. The decay for MPZnPc and TPZnPc in DMF and on TiO2 film was recorded at a higher time-resolution (12.25 ps per channel). The data analysis was carried out by the software provided by IBH (DAS-6), which is based on a deconvolution technique using nonlinear least-square methods. Transient absorption experiments were carried out using nanosecond laser flash photolysis (Applied Photophysics, UK). The second harmonic (532 nm) of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray, LAB 150, Spectra physics, USA) with 8 ns pulse width and 150 mJ pulse energy was used to excite the sample. The transients were probed using a 150 W pulsed Xenon lamp, a Czerny–Turner monochromator, and a Hamamatsu R-928 photomultiplier tube as the detector. The transient signals were captured with an Agilent Infiniium digital storage oscilloscope and the data were transferred to a computer for further analysis. For laser flash photolysis studies, samples were purged with argon gas for 45 min prior to the laser irradiation. The electrochemical studies were carried out with an Electrochemical Analyzer CHI-620B series instrument using cyclic voltammetry. TBAPF6 was used as the electrolyte. The measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system by using platinum as the working electrode, silver/silver chloride as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. The measurements were carried out with reference to Fc/Fc+.
2.4. Quantum yield measurements
Fluorescence and triplet quantum yield measurements were carried out using the following methods as reported earlier.9

Fluorescence quantum yield. 
Fluorescence quantum yields were recorded by fixing the absorbance at the excitation wavelength for reference and sample. Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) was used as the reference (Φf = 0.20 in DMSO). All the samples were excited at 610 nm and the corrected fluorescence spectra were measured. Fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) were calculated using eqn (1). The calculated values are given in Table 1. Φf = FsA0Φ0f/(F0As)(1)where Fs and F0 are the integrated fluorescence intensities of the sample and reference. As and A0 are the absorbances at the excitation wavelength of the sample and reference. Φ0f is the fluorescence quantum yield of the reference.

Triplet quantum yield. 
The triplet–triplet absorption coefficients (ε) were obtained by using the following eqn (2) εT = εSΔAT/ΔAS(2)where ΔAS and ΔAT are the absorbance changes of the triplet absorption spectrum at the minimum of the bleaching band and the maximum of the positive band, respectively. εS is the ground state molar absorption coefficient. The triplet quantum yield (ΦT) was obtained by comparing the ΔAT of the optically matched sample solution at 355 nm to that of the reference ZnPc (ΦT = 0.65) and the values were calculated using eqn (3). The calculated values are given in Table 1. ΦT = ΦZnPcTΔAT/ΔAZnPcTεZnPcT/εT.(3)

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Photophysical characteristics of ZnPc in solution
From the steady state absorption spectroscopy, we observed that all the derivatives (PZnPc – phenoxy Zn-phthalocyanine, MPZnPc – monocarboxyl phenoxy Zn-phthalocyanine and TPZnPc – tetracarboxyl phenoxy Zn-phthalocyanine) give rise to similar spectral behaviour with an absorption maximum of the Q-band centered at 677 nm and the B-band at 355 nm in DMF, meaning that electronic structures of the PZnPc core are not largely perturbed by the substitution of the carboxyl group. The absorption at shorter and longer wavelengths corresponds to the π–π* transition. Moreover, there is no spectral evidence for dimerization or aggregation of all the ZnPc derivatives in their ground state in DMF, which is evidenced by the absence of the typical broad dimeric band in their absorption spectra (Fig. 1a).10 All three derivatives gave rise to similar emission maxima at 688 nm (Fig. 1b) when excited at (677 nm), their Q-band maximum. The fluorescence quantum yields were calculated and summarized in Table 1. The fluorescence quantum yields were affected by substitution of the carboxyl group, i.e., increasing the number of carboxyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield.

The fluorescence decay was recorded by exciting the ZnPc derivatives at 410 nm and monitoring the decay at 688 nm (Fig. 1c). The fluorescence decay of all the three derivatives can be fitted to a single exponential function with a lifetime of around 3 ns, corresponding to the conversion from S1 to S0. The transient absorption spectra of the ZnPc derivatives were measured in DMF and they all show a broad absorption band from 400 nm to 600 nm (Fig. 1d), which corresponds to the triplet–triplet absorption, and bleaching at 690 nm that corresponds to the ground state absorption. The triplet lifetimes of the ZnPc derivatives were obtained from the kinetic traces (Fig. 2) at 500 nm, and the values obtained are listed in Table 1. Correlations between the singlet and triplet quantum yields are shown in Fig. 2b. From this figure, one can clearly visualize that increasing the number of carboxylic acid groups in ZnPc results in a decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield and an increase in the triplet quantum yield. This may be ascribed to the enhancement of the n–π* character of ZnPc absorption. Since the energy of the n–π* transition is less than the π–π* transition, the presence of a carbonyl group in an aromatic ring generally favours intersystem crossing.11,12

3.2. Steady state and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence characteristics of ZnPc on TiO2 film
The absorption spectra of adsorbed ZnPc/TiO2 show broad absorption in the range of 550–800 nm (Fig. 3a and b) with two absorption maxima. MPZnPc/TiO2 gives rise to an absorption maximum at 630 nm, which corresponds to the dimer (H-aggregate) or higher order aggregate,10 and another peak at 682 nm, which is 5 nm redshifted with respect to MPZnPc in DMF. Similar behaviour is shown by TPZnPc/TiO2, but without the 5 nm redshift. The 5 nm redshift of MPZnPc/TiO2 is due to the formation of a J-aggregate, which is absent in the case of TPZnPc/TiO2, due to multiple anchoring of TPZnPc on the TiO2 surface. The dimer absorption peak (630 nm) of MPZnPc/TiO2 (Fig. 3b) is more intense than that of TPZnPc/TiO2, which reveals that MPZnPc has a greater tendency to form a H-aggregate than that of TPZnPc on the TiO2 surface. Aggregation behaviours of these molecules are visualized in Scheme 2. The presence of multiple anchoring groups facilitates the greater adsorption of TPZnPc on the TiO2 surface than that of MPZnPc, as observed from absorption spectral studies. On the other hand, in order to confirm which group of ZnPc is responsible for the interaction with the surface of TiO2 film, we have done comparative experiments with the model compound of PZnPc. For the PZnPc/TiO2 film, no PZnPc absorption was observed (Fig. 3a), indicating that there is no interaction between PZnPc and TiO2. Put simply, PZnPc can not be adsorbed on the surface of TiO2, while the other two ZnPc derivatives are adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. This reveals that the presence of carboxyl groups facilitates the adsorption of ZnPc on the TiO2 surface. In addition, MPZnPc/TiO2 and TPZnPc/TiO2 films were prepared at two different dye concentrations (Fig. 4a and b) and the absorption and emission spectra were recorded. With increasing dye concentration, the Q-band absorption increased and the emission intensity was completely quenched. Moreover, at high surface coverage, a dye–dye interaction is an additional route for deactivation of the excited state of the dye that reduces the electron injection efficiency. So, it is suggested that relatively low optical density (∼0.3) dye/TiO2 films are used for electron injection studies.13,14 In the present work, TiO2 films with low absorbance of dye was prepared for the photophysical studies, in order to get an efficient electron injection process.

Complete quenching of ZnPc emission on the TiO2 surface is attributed to the efficient electron injection from the excited ZnPc to the conduction band of TiO2. This was further confirmed by measuring injection kinetics of MPZnPc and TPZnPc adsorbed on TiO2 films using the time-resolved fluorescence technique. The observed fluorescence decay (Fig. 5a and b) clearly reveals that there is a quenching of ZnPc emission,15a,b which indicates electron injection from the singlet state of the ZnPc. TCSPC is a simple and reliable technique to measure the electron injection kinetics in DSSCs.16,18 It has been previously established that sensitizer molecules adsorbed on a TiO2 surface have a significantly shorter lifetime than free dye molecules. Anchored TPZnPc shows faster injection when compared to anchored MPZnPc (Fig. 5c and Table 2). One can calculate the rate of electron injection process with the following expression, kinj = 1/τads − 1/τfree(4)The calculated kinj values are listed in Table 2. Remarkably, the kinj values of both TPZnPc and MPZnPc are higher when compared to the other reported systems listed in Table 3. However, it should be noted that the variation in the environment (solvent used) and the energetic of the excited sensitizer were expected to influence the electron injection process at the semiconductor/sensitizer interface.

Furthermore, the oxidation potentials of the ZnPc derivatives were estimated from electrochemical studies using cyclic voltammetry. The first oxidation potentials of MPZnPc and TPZnPc were found to be 0.97 V and 0.92 V, respectively. Therefore, TPZnPc is more easily oxidised than MPZnPc. The energetics for electron injection were estimated from electrochemical data and the excitation energy of the ZnPc derivatives. The excited state oxidation potentials were calculated according to eqn (5) (5)where  is the ground state oxidation potential of ZnPc, and Es is the singlet state energy of ZnPc. The calculated values show both the ZnPc derivatives having sufficiently negative excited state potentials17 for injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V). The calculated ΔGinj values for electron injection are given in Table 4. A comparatively more negative excited state potential of TPZnPc than that of MPZnPc indicates that TPZnPc has increased electron injection over MPZnPc. A similar trend was observed in fluorescence lifetime studies. Furthermore, the driving forces for electron recombination from the conduction band of TiO2 to the ground state of ZnPc were calculated and the values are given in Table 4. MPZnPc has a more negative value than TPZnPc, which means MPZnPc shows a tendency for slightly faster recombination. The schematic energy levels of MPZnPc, TPZnPc and TiO2 are shown in Scheme 3.

Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is a very useful technique used to investigate the electron recombination processes of dye/TiO2 films. If electron injection from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor occurs, subsequently the radical cation of the dye should be detectable using this technique. The TA spectra (Fig. 6a and b) of MPZnPc and TPZnPc adsorbed on TiO2 film show a maximum at 520 nm, which is 20 nm redshifted compared with the triplet–triplet absorption maximum of dye alone in DMF. The peak at 520 nm was assigned to the cation radical18 of the ZnPc. The rate constant for electron recombination has been determined using decay monitored at 520 nm and is found to be 4.3 × 105 s−1. It should be noted here that both MPZnPc & TPZnPc derivatives gave rise to a similar rate constant (Fig. 7).

However, the differences between kinj and krec are found to be five and six orders of magnitude for MPZnPc and TPZnPc, respectively. This further demonstrates that TPZnPc has a larger charge separation and it can be used in the conversion of light into electricity under irradiation. Overall, based on the above findings, our suggestion is that tetra-carboxylated derivative (TPZnPc – symmetrical) is more suitable for DSSCs compared with the mono-carboxylated derivative (MPZnPc – unsymmetrical). TPZnPc shows faster electron injection than that of MPZnPc, while the electron recombination process is very similar for both molecules. In addition, MPZnPc has a greater tendency to form aggregates (both H- and J-aggregates) on a TiO2 surface than that of TPZnPc.
4. Summary
Synthesis, aggregation behaviour and the electron injection and recombination dynamics of derivatives of symmetrical and unsymmetrical ZnPc/TiO2 systems were presented. The photophysical and photochemical studies involving steady state and time-resolved techniques revealed the occurrence of electron injection from the excited state of ZnPc to the TiO2 surface. The tetra-carboxylated ZnPc (symmetrical) shows no J-aggregation and less H-aggregation than that of mono-carboxylated (unsymmetrical) ZnPc. The mono-carboxylated ZnPc has a tendency to form both H- and J-aggregates on a TiO2 surface. The emission of ZnPc derivatives on TiO2 was completely quenched as evidenced from time-resolved fluorescence spectral studies, due to the electron injection from singlet ZnPc to the TiO2 surface. The electron recombination process is evidenced from the detection of ZnPc cation radicals at 520 nm using transient absorption spectral studies. We believe that these results give us new insights for the development of high performance phthalocyanine-based solar cell devices.
