    , Accepted 11th July 2013First published on 12th July 2013AbstractA series of new π-conjugated systems bearing arenedithiocarboxyimides (dithioimides) as electron-accepting terminal units were prepared utilizing thionation of the imide compounds in the final step of the synthesis. The thermal properties of the dithioimide compounds demonstrated that they had a weak crystallization nature, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were significantly different from those of their imide analogs. As a result, the dithioimide compounds had narrower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) – lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gaps, and lower LUMO energy levels than those of the corresponding imide compounds. Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on the dithioimide compounds showed good electron-transporting characteristics. Furthermore, the observed OFET performances were dramatically improved compared to those for the crystalline films of the corresponding imide derivatives, despite their tendency to form amorphous films. This unexpected phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of strong intermolecular electronic interactions for the dithioimide compounds, which induced the construction of a non-directional charge-transport pathway. Thus, the increase in electron mobilities for the dithioimide compounds was attributed to the combined effect of the low-lying LUMO energy level and the strong intermolecular electronic interactions in the solid state. Organic photovoltaics based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) as the hole-transporting material and the dithioimide compounds as the electron-transporting material exhibited poorer performances due to the high miscibility between the two compounds.
Introduction
π-Conjugated systems have been the subject of extensive studies owing to their application as semiconducting materials in organic electronics such as organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs).1 Significant accumulated research has revealed the potential of π-conjugated molecules for organic semiconducting materials, with most of these systems known to exhibit hole-transporting (p-type) characteristics.2–4 In contrast, the development of new π-conjugated systems with electron-transporting (n-type) characteristics still lags behind, despite their indispensability in the fabrication of n-type OFET and OPV devices.5,6 This discrepancy is mainly due to difficulties associated with the molecular design of π-conjugated systems suitable for n-type materials, although a rational strategy for the acquirement of n-type characteristics has been proposed as follows: (1) lowering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level for efficient electron injection and (2) invoking strong intermolecular interactions for dense alignment of π-conjugated backbones, leading to efficient electron transport in the solid state. To date, the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups into π-conjugated systems has been recognized as a general approach to decreasing the LUMO energy level, and several functional groups such as fluorine,7 perfluoroalkyl,8–10 carbonyl,11–15 and dicyanomethylene16–22 have been utilized to provide n-type characteristics. However, the precise control of molecular alignment, even in the presence of these functional groups, has faced significant hurdles, since the intermolecular interactions are delicately influenced by the position, number, size, and combination of substituents in the molecule.23
Electron-withdrawing imide groups are most commonly inserted into π-conjugated systems to apply to not only n-type OFET and OPV materials,24–35 but also to donor–acceptor p-type materials.36–47 However, in terms of increasing the intermolecular interactions in combination with reducing the LUMO energy level, the discovery of new electron-accepting units applicable to n-type materials is still a matter of significance. With this point in mind, we focused on dithioimide groups and calculated the molecular orbitals of N-methyldithiophthalimide (S-Imi(Me)) and N-methylthiophene-2,3-dithiocarboxyimide (dithiothienoimide: S-TImi(Me)), together with N-methylphthalimide (Imi(Me)) as a reference, using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. As shown in Fig. 1, the thiocarbonyl groups of S-Imi(Me) participated more strongly in the LUMO than did the carbonyl groups of Imi(Me), and as a consequence, S-Imi(Me) possessed a notably lower LUMO energy level than Imi(Me). The calculation also predicted an even lower LUMO energy level for the dithiothienoimide S-TImi(Me). Furthermore, from the large coefficients on the sulfur atoms in the dithioimides, an increase in the intermolecular overlap of LUMOs in the solid state can be expected. This is similar to the case where the sulfur atoms with large coefficients of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in thienoacene derivatives contribute to intermolecular HOMO overlap.3 Based on this assumption, we designed new π-conjugated systems S-Imi-a-BT, S-Imi-TzTz, and S-TImi-TzTz, which consist of arenedithiocarboxyimides and an electron-accepting central unit (Fig. 1). To investigate the influence of central units on the properties of π-systems, we chose the typical electron-accepting benzothiadiazole and thiazolothiazole units.48 There are few reports concerning dithioimide-containing π-conjugated systems, inferring that accomplishment of such a synthesis poses serious challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of S-Imi-a-BT, S-Imi-TzTz, and S-TImi-TzTz. Furthermore, the properties and n-type performances in OFETs and OPVs of these compounds will be discussed in comparison with their imide analogs (Imi-a-BT, Imi-TzTz, and TImi-TzTz).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
An outline of the synthesis of the target compounds is shown in Scheme 1. We first planned to use dithioimide compound 2 as the starting unit; however, all attempts at Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions using 2 as a substrate resulted in complex mixtures owing to the catalytic poisoning of the thioimide group. To overcome this problem, we applied thionation after constructing the π-conjugated framework. Thus, Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling of 1 with diethynyl compound 349 in THF/N(i-Pr)2Et gave Imi-a-BT, which was then thionated with Davy's reagent (DR) to form S-Imi-a-BT in 88% yield. Since the thiazolothiazole (TzTz) structure can be synthesized by the condensation reaction of an aldehyde with ethanedithioamide, we established the synthetic route of the key aldehyde unit 4 from commercially available 4-methylphthalic anhydride (Scheme S1, see the ESI†). After completing the synthesis of Imi-TzTz, subsequent transformation with DR gave S-Imi-TzTz in 88% yield. Owing to the presence of branched alkyl chains, these compounds were soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. However, the solubilities of the dithioimide compounds were considerably lower than those of the imide compounds. For example, the solubilities of S-Imi-a-BT, S-Imi-TzTz, Imi-a-BT, and Imi-TzTz in chlorobenzene were found to be 1.2, 1.0, 11.0, and 8.0 mg mL−1, respectively. Synthesis of corresponding thienoimide compound TImi-TzTz and dithiothienoimide compound S-TImi-TzTz could be accomplished in the same manner. However, the extremely poor solubility of S-TImi-TzTz in common organic solvents limited the investigation of its properties and device performances. All new compounds were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.

The thermal properties of the synthesized compounds were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. S1,† the TGA curves of S-Imi-a-BT, S-Imi-TzTz, Imi-a-BT, and Imi-TzTz showed 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) at 367, 343, 450, and 414 °C, respectively, indicating that these compounds were sufficiently stable for use in device application, although the replacement of imide groups by dithioimide groups reduced the thermal stability to some extent. The DSC traces of S-Imi-a-BT show no obvious peaks up to 300 °C during heating, whereas the trace of Imi-a-BT shows a clear melting peak at 223 °C (Fig. 2). Compared to Imi-TzTz, the peak of crystallization for S-Imi-TzTz has a larger separation from the melting peak, and is broader. These results indicate a weak crystallization nature of the dithioimide compounds. On the other hand, the higher melting temperature of S-Imi-TzTz compared to that of Imi-TzTz is likely the result of strong intermolecular interactions, which is consistent with the presumption from the observed low solubility of the dithioimide compounds (vide supra).

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the new π-conjugated compounds were measured in chloroform solution and as a film on a quartz plate, and the photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorption spectra of the dithioimide compounds in solution exhibit two clear absorption bands, while the imide compounds exhibit one absorption band. According to time-dependent DFT calculations of the dithioimide compounds at the Coulomb attenuated method (CAM) corrected B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level, the band at the longer wavelength is mainly ascribable to the transition between HOMO and LUMO (see the ESI†). Thus, the measured spectra indicate that the HOMO–LUMO gaps of the dithioimide compounds were narrower than those of the imide compounds. Moreover, the HOMO–LUMO transition band of the dithiothienoimide compound S-TImi-TzTz is further redshifted compared to that of the dithiophthalimide S-Imi-TzTz, and the value of the shift (62 nm) is markedly larger than that between the corresponding imide derivatives TImi-TzTz and Imi-TzTz (39 nm). Compared to the spectra of the imide compounds in solution, an additional well-structured shoulder is evident in their absorption spectra in the solid state, which is attributed to intermolecular electronic interactions of π–π stacked backbones.50 In contrast, the absorption spectra of the dithioimide compounds in the solid state were markedly redshifted, with a concomitant broadening, compared to those in the solution state. This is also an indication of strong intermolecular electronic interactions. These results imply that the replacement of the imide oxygen with sulfur in π-conjugated systems induces different organizations and/or intermolecular interactions in the solid state. From the onset of the absorption in the film state, the optical HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (ΔEopt) of S-Imi-a-BT, S-Imi-TzTz, and S-TImi-TzTz were estimated to be 2.24, 2.20, and 1.80 eV, respectively, values that are notably reduced compared with those similarly estimated for the imide compounds (Imi-a-BT: 2.58 eV, Imi-TzTz: 2.72 eV, and TImi-TzTz: 2.37 eV).

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electrochemical properties of the imide and dithioimide compounds, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were employed. Fig. 4 and S2† depict the cyclic voltammograms and differential pulse voltammograms of these compounds, respectively, and the electrochemical data extracted from the cyclic voltammograms are listed in Table 1. Owing to the low solubility of S-TImi-TzTz, its CV was measured in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) at 80 °C, rather than o-dichlorobenzene/acetonitrile at rt used for the other compounds. This caused a narrow potential window up to −1.0 V, relative to ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). All the compounds gave reversible reduction waves, as the presence of electron-accepting terminal units in the π-system contributes to both decreasing the LUMO energy level and increasing the thermodynamic stability of the resulting anionic species. Interestingly, replacing the imide group with a thioimide group dramatically changed not only the above-mentioned photophysical properties, but also the electrochemical properties of the π-systems, which provides two notable points to mention. The first half-wave potentials (Ered1/2) of the dithioimide compounds are positively shifted compared to those of the imide compounds. This can be explained by the fact that the introduction of strong electron-withdrawing dithioimide units contributes to increasing the electron-accepting nature of the π-system. Moreover, the dithiothienoimide unit has more electron-accepting characteristics than the dithiophthalimide unit, as predicted by the theoretical calculations (vide supra, Fig. 1). The second point to note is that each reduction wave of the phthalimide compounds, Imi-a-BT and Imi-TzTz, consists of a one-electron process (Fig. S2†); however, the first reduction wave of the dithiophthalimide compounds, S-Imi-a-BT and S-Imi-TzTz, indicated two-electron transfer. This remarkable difference is rationalized by the large participation of both terminal dithiophthalimide units in the LUMO, resulting in the effective reduction of on-site coulombic repulsion in the dianionic state. This assumption is supported by the DFT calculations on the model compounds, which indicate that the LUMO+1 energy level of the dithiophthalimide compound is closer to the LUMO energy level, in comparison to the phthalimide compound (Fig. S3†). As listed in Table 1, the LUMO energy levels for the dithioimide and imide compounds were estimated from their first Ered1/2 values relative to Fc/Fc+, under the assumption that the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is −4.8 eV below the vacuum level.51 As the dithioimide and imide compounds did not show any oxidation waves within the potential window of the electrochemical measurements, the HOMO energy levels of these compounds were determined by their ionization potentials obtained from photoemission yield spectroscopy in the solid state (Fig. S4,†Table 1). The obtained values indicate that the HOMO energy levels of the dithioimide compounds were slightly lower or the same as that of the corresponding imide compound. These estimated LUMO and HOMO energy levels are in good agreement with the theoretical results (Fig. S3†). Note that the estimation of LUMO energy levels from the ionization potential and ΔEopt may lead to underestimated values due to the large redshifts of the dithioimide compounds in the solid state; however, these estimated values are in qualitative agreement with the values obtained from the electrochemical reduction potentials.

OFET performances and film morphologies
To investigate the influence of the above-mentioned properties on the charge-transport properties, OFETs with a bottom-contact and bottom-gate configuration were fabricated using the respective dithioimide and imide compounds as semiconductors. The fabrication conditions of the active layers were optimized by varying the fabrication methods and thermal annealing temperatures. The active layers of S-Imi-a-BT, S-Imi-TzTz, Imi-a-BT, and Imi-TzTz were formed by drop-casting from a chlorobenzene solution on the octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS)-modified SiO2 dielectric at a solvent-evaporation temperature of 90 °C and subsequent annealing at 160 °C for 1 h in a vacuum. The active layers of S-TImi-TzTz and TImi-TzTz were fabricated by spin-coating from a 2,5-dichlorothiophene solution at 120 °C and subsequent annealing at 160 °C for 1 h in a vacuum. The OFET measurements were performed in a vacuum in order to minimize the influence of O2 and H2O.13e The electron mobilities (μe) in Table 2 were determined from the equation IDS = W/(2L)Ciμe(VGS − Vth)2, where IDS, W, L, Ci, VGS, and Vth are the source–drain current, channel width, channel length, capacitance of the SiO2 dielectric layers, gate voltage, and threshold gate voltage, respectively. All of the compounds exhibited typical n-type OFET responses, as expected from the estimation of the low-lying LUMO energy levels, and their transfer characteristics are shown in Fig. 5 and S5.† It should be mentioned that the μe's of the dithioimide compounds were found to increase by two orders of magnitude or more compared to those of the imide compounds, and the highest μe of 1.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for the device using S-Imi-TzTz. Owing to its lowest LUMO energy level, S-TImi-TzTz-based OFETs can operate even after being exposed to the air, though one order of decrease in electron mobility (1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was observed.

Since the charge-transport characteristics in OFETs are known to be strongly dependent on the morphology and structural order of molecules in the solid state, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) of these thin films were carried out. As shown in Fig. S6,† the AFM images of all these films demonstrate similar submicrometer-sized grains without observable grain boundaries, indicating no obvious differences in the film morphology among them. The XRD measurements of the films made by the imide compounds exhibited clear reflections (Fig. 6), indicating the formation of a crystalline ordered structure. On the other hand, surprisingly, the XRD patterns of the dithioimide compounds do not show any reflections in both out-of-pane and in-plane observation modes (Fig. 6 and S7†), indicating that these films had an amorphous nature. This film behavior of the dithioimide compounds is generally considered to be a disadvantageous orientation for charge transport in the OFET geometry.23 We tentatively explained this unexpected phenomenon as follows: the presence of strong intermolecular electronic interactions for the dithioimide compounds, which was implied by the UV-vis measurements in the solid state, induced the construction of non-directional charge-transport pathways. These were able to compensate for the low crystallinity-derived deformation by desirable molecular alignment. Therefore, the high electron mobilities of the thioimide compounds might be ascribed to the combination of both the low-lying LUMO energy level in molecule-based properties and strong intermolecular electronic interactions in the bulk solid state.

OPV performances
The film properties and n-type OFET characteristics of the dithioimide compounds motivated us to examine the n-type performances for OPVs. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with a device structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al were utilized for this investigation. The active BHJ layers, composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the p-type polymer and energetically matched n-type materials (SImi-a-BT, SImi-TzTz, and Imi-a-BT), were prepared by spin-coating from their blended solutions in chlorobenzene, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The fabrication conditions of the active BHJ layer were optimized by varying the blend compositions, processing solvents, and thermal annealing temperatures. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OPV devices are shown in Fig. 7(a) and S8,† respectively, and their key photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† While the device based on Imi-a-BT showed moderate OPV performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.58%, contrary to our expectations, the dithioimide compounds exhibited poor PCEs. To gain further insight into this, we compared the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and the AFM image of the P3HT/S-Imi-a-BT blend film with those of P3HT/Imi-a-BT. The PL spectra of both films show effective quenching of the fluorescence from P3HT (Fig. 7(b)), implying that photoinduced charge separation between P3HT and the acceptor materials takes place effectively. On the other hand, the AFM image of P3HT/Imi-a-BT showed the formation of nanometer-scale domains appropriate for carrier-transporting, while the P3HT/S-Imi-a-BT-based film showed a very flat film surface without observable domains (Figs. 7(c) and (d)). Considering that the surface energies of S-Imi-TzTz (19.3 mJ m−2) and S-Imi-a-BT (13.1 mJ m−2), which were determined from their contact-angle measurements, are closer to that of P3HT (9.7 mJ m−2) than those of well-known acceptor material PC61BM (33.7 mJ m−2) and Imi-a-BT (26.1 mJ m−2),52,53 we can conclude that high miscibility of P3HT and the dithioimide compounds might disturb the formation of phase-separated nanomorphology in the blend films, causing the observed decrease in OPV performance.

Conclusions
In summary, a new family of π-conjugated systems, whose structures contained arenedithiocarboxyimides (dithioimides) as electron-accepting terminal units, were designed and successfully synthesized. The utilization of thionation of the imide compounds in the final step of the synthesis enabled us to complete the construction of dithioimide-containing π-systems. The thermal, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the dithioimide compounds were significantly different from those of the imide compounds, clearly demonstrating the uniqueness of the dithioimide as a new electron-accepting unit. It was also observed that the OFET performances of the dithioimide compounds were dramatically improved, despite their tendency to form amorphous films, compared to those for the crystalline films of the corresponding imide derivatives. This trend is in contrast to the conventional understanding that a crystalline state of the active layer in thin films is essential for obtaining good OFET characteristics. It should be emphasized that these distinctive features were observed regardless of the type of central π-conjugated unit used, as well as the arene in the dithioimides. This indicates that dithioimide units have a dominant influence on the properties of these π-conjugated molecules. Thus, this study suggests that dithioimide-containing systems are promising candidates as newly categorized n-type semiconductors, exhibiting good electron-transporting characteristics, even in the less-ordered state. Furthermore, a preliminary investigation into OPVs employing the dithioimide compounds as the n-type material provided important information for use in the molecular design of devices with improved performances. Further research into the development of n-type OFET and OPV materials based on structural functionalization, with the objective of fine-tuning the properties, is currently underway in our laboratory.
