    , Accepted 16th August 2021First published on 17th August 2021AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) have been considered as a promising, cost-effective alternative to the silicon-based solar cells due to their light weight, mechanical flexibility, and easy fabrication features. Over the past decades, organic semiconducting materials have been developed rapidly for use in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs. Among them, porphyrin-based small molecules have been widely applied as electron donors and electron acceptors in BHJ OSCs due to their large conjugated planar structures and strong UV-visible and near-infrared absorption. In this short review article, we mainly focus on summarizing the recent progress of the rational design of push–pull porphyrin-based small molecules for BHJ OSC applications. After various structural developments, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of porphyrin-based small molecules as electron donors in OSCs have exceeded 12%. Apart from that, a PCE of 9.6% has been recorded for a device based on a porphyrin electron acceptor. This paper will provide a good insight into the structure–performance correlation and molecular engineering strategies of porphyrin-based small molecules in a stepwise manner.

1. Introduction
Energy shortage has become an essential problem in the modern world due to the combustion of excessive fossil fuels. Therefore, it is urgent to develop renewable energy power sources. Although there are several renewable energy sources, solar energy stands out as inexhaustible clean energy and has become an environmentally friendly option. Among the various technologies that have been developed to date to harness this energy source, photovoltaic (PV) technology has shown an extensively attractive route to global industry. Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been regarded as a rising star in the field of PV technology for the last two decades due to their significant features, such as low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, and ease of fabrication. Most importantly, they have been considered as a promising cost-effective alternative to the inorganic (silicon-based) solar cells.1–4
A typical OSC mainly has a composition of an electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A), which constitutes the active layer and are sandwiched between the two electrodes of anode and cathode. The bilayer OSC (Fig. 1(a)) is an example of a typical OSC and is called an organic Schottky cell; it was used widely in the early days. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were lower than 2% in this kind of cells due to the short exciton diffusion length in the D–A interface.5 Later, Yu et al.6 and Halls et al.7 fabricated the first bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSC device, in which they proposed the concept of bicontinuous and interpenetrating D–A composites as a blend film, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Since then, the architecture of BHJ solar cells has been considered the standard device in the OSC industry with significantly good performance.

During the past several years, there has been growing research progress in developing new organic semiconducting materials, including polymers and small molecules, as donors and acceptors in BHJ OSCs. Small-molecule donors have grabbed attention from their polymer donor counterparts due to their attractive features such as easily modified structural layouts, definite molecular weights, easy purification, and minimum batch-to-batch variations.9–12 Porphyrin, a familiar photosensitizer, and its derivatives play vital roles in many biological, catalysis, and artificial photosynthesis processes; they function like chlorophylls as natural light harvesters in photosynthesis. The word porphyrin originates from the Greek ‘porphura’ (πoρφúρα), which means purple, and it is a tetrapyrrolic 18 π-electron aromatic macrocycle. Recently, porphyrin analogs have received growing attention as electron donors and acceptors in BHJ OSCs, due to a number of intrinsic features associated with them: (1) wide absorption regions (Soret and Q bands in the ultraviolet-visible range) with high molar extinction coefficients (ε), (2) easily tunable electronic properties by changing the different substituents at the peripheral positions (meso- and β-) and various metal insertions at the central core of the porphyrin (Fig. 2), (3) good thermal stabilities, and (4) efficient materials for electron transfer reactions.
 Fig. 2  Typical structure of a porphyrin featuring four meso- and eight β-positions to be functionalized for tunable electronic and photophysical properties. 
It is known that many porphyrin derivatives are found widely in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as photosensitizers and in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as interlayers.13–16 By tuning the structures of porphyrins, the PCEs have surpassed 13% in DSSCs.17,18 On the other hand, porphyrins were eventually studied as electron donors in solution-processed BHJ solar cells; however, their inferior performance in early years was discouraging when simple porphyrin chromophores such as tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) were employed as a donor in BHJ devices. Later, after the rapid development of modified porphyrin-based π-conjugated systems, they were substantially employed as electron donors and acceptors in BHJ OSCs, and their performance has been improved significantly in the last few years.18–21 To the best of our knowledge, very few reviews have been reported on porphyrin-based photovoltaic materials for BHJ OSCs from various points of view. In this mini-review, we will briefly outline the rational design of π-extended porphyrin-based small molecules as electron donors and acceptors and their performance in BHJ OSCs.
2. Porphyrin small molecules as electron donors
2.1 Influence of porphyrin molecular design for efficient organic solar cells
Porphyrins can be synthesized easily by different methods, and a simple method to prepare tetrasubstituted porphyrins, for example, TPP, involves the condensation of pyrrole and aldehyde precursors in the presence of acid catalysts (Fig. 3). However, the performance of simple porphyrin donors in OSCs was discouraging in early 2012, with PCEs <1%22 due to the poor crystallinity and low charge mobility with fullerene acceptors. Furthermore, porphyrins were flanked by ethynylene-substituted electron-donor or acceptor building blocks, which enabled the D–A conjugated configuration. This molecular design has received great interest in solution-processed OSCs to study the intramolecular charge and electron transfer within the conjugated molecule and to stabilize the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the D–A structure. Consequently, the trans-A2B2 porphyrin molecule performed better with a fullerene acceptor because the trans pattern enables the push–pull electronic interactions and favors a more desirable surface morphology than the cis-A2B2 porphyrin (Fig. 3).23,24
 Fig. 3  The chemical structures of porphyrin-based donors. 
2.2 A–D–A-based porphyrin small molecule donors for fullerene-based devices
To further improve the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of D–A porphyrin and extend the absorption into the near-infrared (NIR) region for a better use of solar light irradiation, a typical A–D–A structural configuration has been introduced for the molecular design of porphyrins. The use of a strongly electron deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit in the porphyrin core via ethynylene bridges is effective in red-shifting the absorption and thus elevates the photovoltaic performance. The DPP moiety has been widely used in OSCs as an electron withdrawing chromophore due to the rigidity and planarity of its building block, which facilitates intermolecular packing in the solid state.25–27 The porphyrin core for these small molecules can be synthesized in good yield by using dipyrromethane and an alkyl or aryl-substituted aldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and dichloromethane (DCM) as a solvent, followed by oxidation of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) (Scheme 1). Furthermore, bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) followed by metalation would afford the key precursor of Br–P–Br, which can be finally coupled with mono-ethynylene-substituted DPP by Sonogashira reaction to obtain A–D–A porphyrin–DPP-based small molecules in good yields.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for the A–D–A porphyrin–DPP-based small molecules. 
Peng et al. for the first time in 2013 reported a porphyrin–DPP-based small molecular donor in an A–D–A configuration (P1, Fig. 4), in which the bis(dodecyloxy)phenyl meso-substituents on the porphyrin core ensure high solubility for solution processing. The extended π-conjugation of P1 spanned the absorption from the visible to the NIR region, and a PCE of 3.71% (Table 1) was achieved for the BHJ device based on P1:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Furthermore, the PCE was improved to 4.78% using pyridine as a solvent additive.25

To study the impacts of different lengths of alkyl side chains on the thiophene units on the crystallinity of the active layer and the cell performance, Peng's group continued to report a series of porphyrin–DPP based small molecular donors by varying the vertical meso-substituents on the porphyrin core with 2-ethylhexylthienyl, 2-butyloctylthienyl and 2-hexyldecylthienyl groups, respectively (P2–P4, Fig. 4). The molecules P2–P4 with different alkyl chains showed similarly strong absorption profiles in the NIR region and similar energy levels due to the similar π-conjugation of the backbone. Under the optimization conditions of a pyridine and 1,8-diiooctane (DIO) mixture, the best device P3:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) demonstrated an outstanding PCE of 9.06% with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 19.58 mA cm−2. The devices P2:PC71BM and P4:PC71BM also exhibited decent PCEs of 8.08% and 8.24%, respectively.26,28 The best performance of the device P3:PC71BM was mainly due to the well-ordered surface morphology of D–A domains, which led to increased crystallinity and thus gave rise to high JSC and FF values. Therefore, the compound P3 with a 2-butyloctylthienyl side chain can be a model molecule for further optimizing device performance. Subsequently, by the same group, the device P3:PC71BM was employed as the rear subcell to fabricate a tandem OSC, while the DR3TSBDT small molecule was used as a front subcell; thus, the tandem device afforded an excellent PCE of 12.5% under 1 sun.29
To improve the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the cells, Peng et al. further reported a small molecular donor P5 (Fig. 4) with the same porphyrin–DPP backbone by introducing benzothiophene groups to the meso-porphyrin core. Under pyridine addition, thermal annealing (TA) and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatments, the optimal device P5:PC61BM exhibited a PCE of 9.08% (Table 1) with a VOC of 0.80 V.30
2.3 3-Ethylrhodanine (RH) capped A–π–D–π–A porphyrin small molecules
The concept of a push–pull structure is of great interest and has been demonstrated as a successful strategy in the field of porphyrin-based OSCs. Another state-of-the-art design of A–π–D–π–A porphyrin-based donors can be realized by symmetrically introducing a phenylene ethynylene or thienyl ethynyl π-linker to the meso-substituted porphyrin core and then end-capping with 3-ethylrhodanine (RH) as a typical electron withdrawing unit. It was believed that introducing π-linkers to the porphyrin chromophores could further extend the conjugation as well as control the film morphology and crystallinity, and the strong acceptor RH could enhance the ICT and improve the light absorption capability. In 2014, Palomares et al. reported a conjugated A–π–D–π–A porphyrin donor P6 (Fig. 5), in which the ethylidenemalononitrile units were end-capped symmetrically to the porphyrin core via thiophene ethynyl π-bridges. The donor P6 showed a strong absorption profile due to the strong ICT of the electron withdrawing ethylidenemalononitrile group. Based on the P6:PC71BM films processed from THF only and pyridine-THF, respectively, the cell performance was enhanced from 3.65% to 5.24% (Table 2).31 In 2015, Palomares et al. further synthesized a porphyrin small molecule P7 (Fig. 5), which has a longer π-linker terthiophene-ethynylene unit symmetrically conjugated to the porphyrin core and is terminated with RH units symmetrically. The blend film P7:PC71BM afforded a moderate PCE of 5.5% after the addition of pyridine and TA treatment. It was found that the impurity of P7 might affect its photovoltaic performance, although the device afforded a good VOC of 0.82 V.32 Therefore, it is suggested that those porphyrin-based small molecules should be purified as much as possible.33 Using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques could help ensure the purity at HPLC grade rather than nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) grade.34

In early 2015, Zhu et al. investigated the role of alkyl chains in the vertical meso-porphyrin core and introduced phenylene ethylene as the π-linker between the porphyrin and RH units to afford an A–π–D–π–A architecture. The three porphyrin donors had different alkyl groups of 5,15-bis(2-octylundecyl) (P8), 5,15-bis(3-octyl-1-tridecyl) (P9), and 5,15-bis(4-octyl-1-tetra-decyl) (P10) (Fig. 5). The PCEs were recorded under optimized conditions for P8 (6.49%), P9 (2.53%), and P10 (5.12%) with PC71BM as an electron acceptor. Unexpectedly, the device P9 showed lower PCE than the devices P8 and P10 due to inefficient phase separation and insufficient exciton separation.35 To further increase the cell performance while maintaining the same backbone of porphyrin-based small molecules, a series of porphyrins were developed by introducing the long alkyl aromatic and aliphatic peripheral substituents at the meso-porphyrin core. They are (5,15-bis[3,5-di(dodecyloxyl)phenyl]-porphyrin) (P11), [5,15-bis(4-dodecyloxylphenyl)-porphyrin] (P12) and [5,15-bis(2-hexylnonyl)-porphyrin (P13)] (Fig. 5).36 The conventional device based on P13:PC71BM showed a higher PCE of 7.7% with a VOC of 0.91 V. It was found that the inverted device based on P13:PC71BM showed comparable performance, with a PCE of 7.55%, and retained 83% of the original value even after storage in air for 30 days. On the other hand, the devices based on P11:PC71BM and P12:PC71BM exhibited PCEs of 3.21% and 5.07% (Table 2), respectively. The highest PCE for P13 with the aliphatic substituted porphyrin was mainly attributed to the well-ordered surface morphology and stronger intermolecular π–π stacking, which led to higher JSC and FF values.
However, it is still a bottleneck to enhance the intermolecular interactions between porphyrin molecules and to expand the backbone conjugation for the optimal energy levels to ensure decent charge carrier mobility. Therefore, Zhu et al. replaced the phenylene ethynylene with 3,3′′-dihexyl-terthiophene (TT) ethynylene as the linker and end capped it with electron-withdrawing RH for P14 and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine (CNR) for P15 (Fig. 5).37 Interestingly, both P14 and P15 compounds showed stronger absorptions in solution and the solid state, and the optimized device based on P15:PC71BM exhibited a higher PCE of 8.21%, while the device P14:PC71BM obtained a PCE of 7.66% (Table 2).
Supramolecular self-assembly of molecules is indeed useful to obtain nano-scale interpenetrated morphologies to further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.38 Some reports highlighted that organic polymers with alkylthio groups can enhance the supramolecular self-assemblies via sulfur–sulfur intermolecular interactions, which could be beneficial for high performance in OSCs.39,40 In order to study the self-assembly of porphyrins, Zhu et al. further modified the peripheral substitutions on the porphyrin core by replacing alkoxy phenylene ethynylene linkers with alkyl and alkylthio phenylene groups to afford P16 and P17 (Fig. 5). After the addition of pyridine and SVA treatments, the blend film P17:PC71BM demonstrated a higher PCE of 8.04% (Table 2) compared with the device P16:PC71BM (5.86%). The higher performance of P17 is mainly attributed to the preferential J-aggregation self-assembly with PC71BM, which could be driven by sulfur–sulfur interactions from the substituents.41
The previous structure–property correlation studies on porphyrin small molecules disclosed that the photovoltaic performance is also affected by the π-linkage. Zhu et al., therefore, designed and synthesized three porphyrin small molecules P18, P19, and P20 (Fig. 5) and investigated the effect of the π-conjugation length by introducing oligo(phenyleneethynylene)n (n = 1, 2, 3) linkers between the porphyrin core with 5-alkylthio-2-thienyl peripheral substituents and the ending RH units. All three molecules P18–P20 possessed stronger absorption profiles from 400 nm to 750 nm. After being blended with PC71BM and under optimization conditions, the device based on P18 having a short π-linkage afforded a notable PCE of 8.66%, while the other devices demonstrated lower PCEs of 8.29% and 7.93% on P19 and P20, respectively (Table 2). Although P19 and P20 films gave rise to lower PCEs than P18, higher FF and hole mobilities were recorded, which can be attributed to the longer π-conjugation length with better morphology.42
2.4 Porphyrin-based dimers for near-infrared absorption
As we discussed earlier, A–D–A and A–π–D–π–A-based porphyrin donors have greatly shown impressive photovoltaic performance in OSCs. However, most of these porphyrin-based small molecular donors showed limited absorption of less than 850 nm. To further extend this absorption into the near-infrared region, Langa et al. designed and synthesized a conjugated D–A–D-based porphyrin dimer P21 (Fig. 6) bridged with DPP-ethynylene and terminated with thiophene groups. The cell based on the dimer P21 with PC71BM exhibited a high PCE of 8.03% (Table 3) with low energy loss and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at over 900 nm.43 Peng et al. also developed a series of largely conjugated porphyrin donors based on the A–π–D1–D2–D1–π–A architecture by flanking three different electron-rich units (diethynylene, diethynylene-dithiophene, and diethynylene-phenylene) between the two porphyrin cores and replacing RH with DPP as terminal units via an ethynylene linkage to afford P22, P23, and P24 (Fig. 6), respectively.44 Due to the elongated π-conjugation, the three compounds showed improved ICT, which lowered their bandgaps. The optimized device based on P22:PC61BM accumulated a higher PCE of 6.42% than the other devices, P23:PC61BM (4.5%) and P24:PC61BM (5.5%). This can be attributed to the suitable energy levels and better film morphology of the donor–acceptor interfaces. The same group further modified the former structure of the porphyrin dimers and synthesized a new dimeric porphyrin, P25 (Fig. 6), using an ethynylene linker. Impressively, the optimized device P25:PC61BM showed a broad photoresponse up to 1000 nm, and the blend film recorded a remarkable PCE of 8.45% (Table 3) with an impressive JSC of 19.65 mA cm−2.45

In addition to those porphyrin dimers with DPP terminating units, Zhu et al. synthesized an A–π2–D–π1–D–π2–A-configured porphyrin dimer P26 (Fig. 6) by employing electron withdrawing RH as ending units via a phenylene ethynyl linker.46 As expected, the targeting molecule further extended the absorption edge over 1100 nm; after being blended with PC71BM and after TA + SVA treatments, the device furnished a respectable PCE of 8.29% (Table 3) with a high FF of 70%. Apart from the efficiency, the device showed an energy loss (Eloss) of 0.43 eV, which is the lowest value among those reported in porphyrin-based BHJ OSCs.
Recently, Peng et al. incorporated an electron-deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) as the bridge to dimeric porphyrin and RH as terminals through thiophene linkers to afford P27 (Fig. 6) with an A1–π–D–A2–D–π–A1 configuration. The compound P27 with enhanced ICT showed elongated π-conjugation, strong absorption in the NIR region, and deeper HOMO energy levels. The device based on P27:PC61BM processed with a pyridine additive and SVA treatments led to a promising PCE of 10.02% (Table 3) with increasing values of JSC and VOC.47
Very recently, Langa et al. synthesized two D–A–D porphyrin dimers by introducing DPP as the central unit, differentiating by two electron-donating bis(dodecyloxy)phenyl (P28), 5-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl (P29) substituents at the meso-porphyrin cores (Fig. 6).48 The dimer P29 possessed a higher charge carrier mobility and more balanced charge transport properties compared to P28 due to the strong electron donating property of the thieno-thiophene unit. The optimized blend films with PC71BM exhibited overall PCEs of 8.05% for P28 and 8.89% for P29 (Table 3) with stronger absorption profiles up to 900 nm.
2.5 Ternary organic solar cells based on porphyrin small molecules
Indeed, porphyrin derivatives have been successfully explored in BHJ OSCs due to their excellent light-harvesting properties in the visible and NIR regions. However, there is still a weak absorption between the Soret and Q bands.49 On the other side, the absorption towards the NIR region is still a bottleneck for binary layer OSCs based on wide bandgap electron donors. Thanks to the new concept of ternary organic solar cells, the light harvesting capability can be improved by employing one donor and two acceptors or two donors and one acceptor with complementary absorption profiles in the active layer.50 It has been revealed that the addition of a third component can enable manipulation of the film morphology and charge transport properties, thus leading to enhanced photovoltaic performance of a solar cell. Without any doubt, porphyrins are excellent light absorbing materials and can be fabricated for ternary devices to strengthen UV-visible-NIR light harvesting and achieve high efficiency in BHJ OSCs.
In 2016, Peng et al. constructed a ternary solar cell by the introduction of low bandgap porphyrin (P30, Fig. 6) into a PTB7 (poly-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene):PC71BM blend film.51 The ternary device exhibited an improved PCE of 8.39% (Table 4), which is 12% higher than that of the binary layer of PTB7:PC71BM (7.23%). The better performance of the ternary device than the binary one is mainly attributed to the full photoresponse over 900 nm. Inspired by the previous results of P30 in the ternary OSC, the same group fabricated a ternary device based on the addition of 30% P2 (Fig. 4) to PTB7:PC71BM. Impressively, the blend film exhibited an expanded full photoresponse and enhanced the device performance. It resulted in a promising PCE of 11.03% (Table 4) with a JSC of 18.94 mA cm−2, an FF of 75.63%, and a VOC of 0.77 V.52 The high performance of the device could be attributed to the complementary absorption in the NIR region and well-balanced charge extraction and recombination dynamics.

Recently, Langa et al. constructed a ternary device by the addition of two porphyrins, P31 and P32 (Fig. 6), as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor.53 The ternary device based on P31:P32:PC71BM (0.2:0.8:2) showed a PCE of 6.72%, and the PCE was further improved to 9.44% (Table 4) after SVA treatment together with a JSC of 15.98 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 0.85 V. The binary layers held comparatively low PCEs of 3.11% for P31:PC71BM and 4.03% for P32:PC71BM. The enhanced efficiency of the ternary solar cell could be ascribed to the well-ordered nano-scale morphology of the active layer, which is beneficial for enhancing the charge transport properties and, thus, the device performance.
Subsequently, Zhu et al. designed and synthesized an A2–π–D–A1–D–π–A2 porphyrin dimer P33 (Fig. 6) as the donor for ternary solar cells.54P33 has two porphyrin units flanked by electron deficient DPP units as the core, endcapped with RH units via a phenylene ethynylene linker. The compound P33 exhibited a stronger absorption range from 400 to 900 nm with a small valley at 550–650 nm in both liquid and solid states. To compensate for the absorption gap between the Soret and Q bands, a wide bandgap small molecule donor, DR3TBDTTF,55 with a complementary absorption (Fig. 7a) was used as the second donor for ternary solar cells. By using PC71BM as an acceptor, the device based on the ternary layer of P33:20% DR3TBDTTF:PC71BM provided a remarkable PCE of 11.15% (Table 4) with a panchromatic photoresponse. The PCE of the binary device based on P33:PC71BM was determined to be 9.30% (Fig. 7b). It is obvious that this ternary combination with porphyrin-based small molecules as one component in the ternary active layer can significantly improve the device performance through enhancing the light-harvesting capability to over 1000 nm. These results demonstrate that the choice of the third component is quite crucial for highly efficient ternary solar cells.

2.6 Porphyrin-based donors for nonfullerene organic solar cells
Although the fullerene derivatives PC61BM and PC71BM are employed as efficient electron acceptors in BHJ solar cells, they still suffer from intrinsic shortcomings, such as limited absorption and poor mechanical properties.56–58 At the same time, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been developed rapidly to overcome the above issues of their fullerene counterparts. Apart from that, they possess extensive properties, such as easy synthesis, tunable electronic properties, and more balanced charge mobilities, for the future commercialization of OSCs. The PCEs of OSCs based on polymer donors and NFAs have recently increased from 9% to 18%.59–62
Recently, Peng et al. used porphyrin small molecule P3 (Fig. 4) as the donor and one terthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (6TIC)-based acceptor to construct nonfullerene OSCs.63 Usually, it is very rare to show high efficiency in a device based on all small-molecule OSCs rather than using polymer counterparts. Surprisingly, upon the addition of DIO and SVA treatment, the optimized device P3:6TIC afforded an outstanding PCE of 12.08% with a remarkable JSC of 20.44 mA cm−2. The better efficiency of the device is mainly attributed to the increasing crystallinity after SVA treatment and the formation of multi length scale morphology.
Wan et al. synthesized a porphyrin donor P34 (Fig. 8) by introducing a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) unit at the vertical meso-porphyrin core, and they fabricated all small-molecule OSCs with NFA IDT-C8 as an acceptor. At the optimized conditions, the device P34:IDT-C8 showed a moderate PCE of 5.14%. Although the two molecules exhibited complementary absorption to each other, they formed unfavorable phase morphologies, which could be the reason for the low JSC.64
 Fig. 8  The chemical structures of conjugated porphyrins for nonfullerene OSCs. 
Very recently, Zhu et al. synthesized two A–π–D2–D1–D2–π–A dimeric porphyrin small-molecule donors P35 and P36 (Fig. 8) bridged by 2-ethylhexylthienyl and 2-ethylhexylthiothienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT), respectively.65 Both compounds have a similar strong photoresponse range from 400 nm to 900 nm with a small valley at 600 nm. Under optimal processing conditions with 6TIC as the acceptor, the donor P36 with sulfur linkages on BDT exhibited a high PCE of 10.39% and a high JSC of 19.53 mA cm−2, while the device P35:6TIC showed a slightly lower PCE of 8.73% with a lower JSC of 17.75 mA cm−2. The results indicated that side chain engineering could influence the device performance by changing the surface morphology and enhancing the charge mobility and charge extraction.
2.7 Porphyrin-based small molecule donors for indoor photovoltaics
As discussed above, those porphyrin-based small molecules and their device performance have shown promising results in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, to achieve high efficiencies, researchers have developed a new strategy for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) by using ambient light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescent tubes instead of AM1.5G 1 sun illumination. These indoor lights can easily emit light in the visible region from 400 nm to 750 nm, which is beneficial for spectral overlapping with the absorption of the OPV materials.66–69 Recent literature references have reported PCEs surpassing 31% based on indoor OPV devices.70–74
For the first time, Zhu and co-workers reported porphyrin-based donor P13, which is not only a promising material for 1 sun light but also for indoor illumination. The optimized device based on P13:PC71BM yielded a high PCE of 19.2% with a VOC of 0.75 V, a JSC of 29.56 μA cm−2, and an FF of 66.1% under a 300 lux LED tube.75 Next, the same group demonstrated that porphyrin donors are promising materials to construct semitransparent and high-performance indoor solar cells. Therefore, we screened out several porphyrin donors, P8, P19, P20, and P33, from our early reports, and fabricated devices with PC71BM under 300 lux LED illumination. Among them, the P8-based device showed a decent PCE of 11% with illuminance transparency of 68%, while the PCEs of the other devices were recorded for P19 (10.7%), P20 (8.7%), and P33 (8.2%).76
3. Porphyrin-based small molecules as electron acceptors
We have discussed that porphyrin-based small molecules as donors with various structural configurations (A–D–A, A–π–D–π–A) have shown tremendous results in BHJ OSCs. On the other hand, researchers have also been intrigued to investigate porphyrin derivatives as electron acceptors in OSCs. A very early study with inferior results (PCEs <3.3%) showed the development of porphyrin-based acceptors.77,78 In 2017, Li et al. reported a star-shaped porphyrin-based acceptor by appending four strong electron-deficient perylenediimide (PDI) units at the meso-porphyrin core via ethynylene linkages to afford P37 (Fig. 9).79 Interestingly, the compound P37 showed strong absorption bands from 300 nm to 850 nm with balanced energy levels; when it was employed as an electron acceptor with a PBDB-T polymer donor, the optimized device based on P37:PBDB-T exhibited an outstanding PCE of 7.4% with a JSC of 14.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.78 V, and an FF of 66% (Table 5). These results motivated the scientific community to develop more efficient porphyrin-based acceptors in the field of OSCs. Jang et al. modified the structure of P37 and synthesized an n-type porphyrin acceptor by keeping two PDI units with ethynylene groups at the meso-porphyrin and introducing two thiophene groups to the vertical porphyrin core to obtain P38 (Fig. 9).80 The BHJ device was fabricated by using PTB7-Th as the polymer donor and P38 as the electron acceptor to lead to a PCE of 5.25%. In addition, the blend film showed panchromatic absorption from 350 nm to 900 nm with a remarkable Eloss of 0.54 eV.

In order to improve the electron mobility and light harvesting ability of porphyrin acceptors in OSCs, very recently, Zhu and his co-workers designed and synthesized the PDI-porphyrin based acceptor P39 using p-phenylene instead of ethynylene as linkages (Fig. 9). For comparison, P40 (Fig. 9) was synthesized with two PDI units similarly appended to porphyrin.81 The purpose of introducing p-phenylene bridges is to control the excessive steric interference between the PDI and porphyrin units; therefore, it can essentially disrupt the π-conjugation and maintain the electron accepting ability of PDI and donating ability of porphyrin simultaneously. The BHJ active layer was prepared by using PBT7-Th as a polymer donor and porphyrin acceptors (P39, P40); a high PCE of 9.64% was achieved for the blend film P39:PBT7-Th with high electron mobility, while the device based on P40:PBT7-Th afforded a PCE of 6.38% (Table 5).
Recently, Li et al. investigated the effect of side chains on the peripheral porphyrin core to influence the device performance. Therefore, they introduced four different side chains attached to the porphyrin core at the vertical meso positions that differed by 2,6-di(dodecyloxy)phenyl (P41), (2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl (P42), pentadecan-7-yl (P43), and 3,5-di(dodecyloxy)-phenyl (P44) (Fig. 9)82 and were endcapped with two PDI units via ethynylene bridges to the porphyrin. These acceptors were fabricated respectively with a PBDB-T polymer donor for BHJ OSCs, and the optimized blend films showed PCEs of 1.87% for P41, 3.79% for P42, 4.23% for P43, and 5.34% for P44 (Table 5). These results indicated that the choice of side chains is important in order to enhance the device performance of OSCs because they could affect the electronic properties, crystallinity, and microphase morphology of the active layers.
To date, porphyrin-based acceptors have been reported with PDI substituents on a porphyrin core, and they demonstrated promising performance in OSCs. Naphthalene diimide (NDI) is another efficient electron withdrawing acceptor and less bulky analogue than the PDI unit, and it was employed to build polymeric nonfullerene acceptors in OSCs. In 2018, Jang et al. developed an efficient porphyrin-based acceptor which contained four NDI units incorporated at the perimeter of the porphyrin core through ethynylene linkages to afford P45 (Fig. 9).83 The BHJ device based on a P45:PBT7-Th film exhibited a notable PCE of 8.15% (Table 5) with a very low Eloss of 0.61 eV. Apart from that, the absorption of compound P45 was red-shifted to the NIR region over 930 nm due to the effective π-conjugation between the NDI and porphyrin units.
Despite the aforementioned advantages of tetrasubstituted porphyrin acceptors based on PDI or NDI groups and their performance in OSCs, it is still challenging to obtain high VOC and balanced charge carrier mobility simultaneously. Very recently, Lin et al. reported for the first time a series of n-type porphyrin derivatives endcapped with a strong electron deficient 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (2FIC) acceptor via thiophene π-linkers based on a push–pull structure. The three molecules differ by their three different side chains: 3,4,5-tridodecyloxyphenyl (P46), 2,6-didodecyloxyphenyl (P47), and 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl (P48) at the vertical meso-porphyrin core (Fig. 9).84 Furthermore, the three porphyrin acceptors were successfully fabricated with a PTB7-Th polymer donor in OSCs. The P47-based device showed a remarkable PCE of 7.23% with a VOC of 0.80 V, a JSC of 13.94 mA cm−2, and an FF of 64.8% over the devices based on P46 (4.10%) and P48 (5.48%) (Table 5). The better performance of P47 could be attributed to the controlled molecular aggregation of the porphyrin surrounded by the alkoxy chains, which should be beneficial to form face-on orientation and thus enhance JSC and VOC.
4. Conclusion and future perspectives
In summary, we have briefly discussed the recent progress in the development of porphyrin-based materials as efficient donors and acceptors for BHJ OSCs by structural engineering of the π-conjugated porphyrin backbone and peripheral substitutions on the porphyrin cores and π-linkers. Among them, A–D–A porphyrin–DPP-based small molecules have been tremendously explored as electron donors, and impressive PCEs up to 9% were recorded. Introducing electron-deficient units via π-linkers to the porphyrin core is another strategy to develop A–π–D–π–A porphyrin-based small molecular donors with enhanced intermolecular ICT, intramolecular π–π interaction, and light-harvesting capability. The state-of-the-art A–π–D–π–A porphyrin donors revealed PCEs of over 8.6%. Typically, the absorption spectra of porphyrin-based small molecules have been vastly extended to the NIR region over 1100 nm by incorporating several conjugated chromophores, such as DPP, BT, and porphyrin units, via ethynylene linkages. Moreover, porphyrin-based ternary solar cells exhibited PCEs of over 11% with a panchromatic absorption profile. In addition, the devices based on porphyrin donors with nonfullerene acceptors showed an outstanding PCE of 12%. Furthermore, porphyrin derivatives have been proven to be not only good materials for electron donors but also efficient candidates for electron acceptors, and the maximum PCE of 9.6% was demonstrated using porphyrin acceptors. Last but not least, the porphyrin-based OSCs also showed high efficiency of 19.2% under indoor light illumination.
To further improve the high efficiency of porphyrin-based donors, researchers need to focus on developing more rationally designed porphyrin structures. For example, replacing the zinc at the porphyrin core with platinum would produce triplet excited states with longer lifetimes, therefore potentially leading to more efficient charge separation and transportation.85 On the other hand, it would be very promising to develop highly efficient and stable ternary organic solar cells by using porphyrin small molecules as the third component. By a careful selection of other two or more components for the photoactive layer, those key photovoltaic parameters would be simultaneously elevated within the ternary organic solar cells, resulting in record-high efficiency for commercial photovoltaic applications.
The morphology of the active layers affects the charge generation, dissociation and transportation process in OSCs and therefore is a key factor to enhance the device performance. To balance the strong π–π aggregation of porphyrin molecules, the combination of a suitable wide bandgap small molecule as the second electron donor in ternary solar cells has been demonstrated to be effective and should be the focus of the future research in improving the device performance via film morphology engineering. On the other side, the development of narrow-bandgap porphyrin-based acceptors characteristic of strong NIR absorption will be beneficial to boost the JSC value for better device performance.
