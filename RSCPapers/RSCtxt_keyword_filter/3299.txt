    , Accepted 28th May 2019First published on 30th May 2019AbstractThis work focuses on developing high-efficiency perylene diimide (PDI)-based small molecular nonfullerene acceptors with a simple synthetic strategy. We reported a new electron acceptor, Py-e-PDI, obtained via cross-coupling four PDI units with a planar pyrene core through ethynyl groups. Although the ring-fusion synthetic procedure was omitted, the large planar core and significantly reduced intramolecular steric hindrance endowed this nonfused PDI-tetramer derivative with moderate planarity. Differing from most of the PDI-tetramers with highly twisted geometries, Py-e-PDI could self-assemble into a highly ordered structure. The inverted solar cells with PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI blends exhibited the best power conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which mainly resulted from the combined contribution of complementary absorption with a donor polymer, desirable aggregation and high electron mobility. Most importantly, this result demonstrates that simply planarizing 3D nonfused perylene diimide based acceptors is effective to improve the performance of the corresponding non-fullerene (NF) acceptors.
Introduction
Conventional fullerene derivative-based organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved great success in the past decade and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached beyond 10% since 2014.1–4 However, in the last several years, the further efforts of scientists to improve the efficiency of this type of OSC have resulted in no substantial progress due to the serious drawbacks of fullerene acceptors. Fullerene acceptors do not significantly contribute to light harvesting at wavelengths greater than 600 nm, and their energy levels cannot be fine-tuned to match the donor materials to maximize the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and minimize the energy loss.5,6 Recently, an emerging class of nonfullerene small molecule acceptors has rivaled the dominance of fullerene-based acceptors.7–9 The single-junction non-fullerene OSCs can now achieve much higher PCEs (>14%) than fullerene-based ones.10–12 Furthermore, very recently, 17.3% PCE has been realized for a tandem device.13 The great adjustability of molecular structures for small molecule acceptors offers a wide range of optoelectronic tunability.
Among the numerous non-fullerene electron acceptors, perylene diimide (PDI) based acceptors have been one of the most intensively studied and promising alternatives to fullerene derivatives because of their appropriate low-lying energy levels, high electron mobility and strong absorption in the visible region.14–17 And it is worth mentioning that PDI, the most extensively used dye in industries, is readily scalable at low-cost, making it one of the few feasible candidates for commercial OSCs. Moreover, PDIs have complementary absorptions (300–600 nm) with the typical narrow-band gap polymer donors, such as PTB7 and PTB7-Th. However, PDIs exhibit a strong tendency of forming large aggregates due to their rigid polycyclic aromatic core. Therefore, a twisting strategy had been proposed to produce a twisted molecular geometry in PDI derivatives, which can suppress the strong aggregation and assure effective dissociation of photogenerated excitons into free charges.18 However, a challenge involved in this effort is the difficulty in maintaining the effective charge transport due to reduced π–π stacking between nonplanar PDIs. How much twisting would be needed? The PDI-based acceptors have experienced three stages of development, PDI monomers,19,20 twisted PDIs (dimers,21–25 trimers26–29 and tetramers30–37) and fused PDIs.38–45 Most of the twisted PDIs showed a PCE below 6%, while the fused PDIs obtained from oxidative cyclization exhibited significantly improved efficiency. It is obvious that in some PDI derivatives the twisted geometries greatly suppressed their crystallinities.29–33 After final oxidative cyclization, the highly twisted molecules could be changed to more planar molecules and their crystallinity was thus significantly improved. According to the reported PDI based acceptors, a guiding principle can be summarized as follows: when nanoscale phase separation is within a reasonable range, i.e., not too large for efficient exciton dissociation, the intermolecular π–π stacking is essential to endow the device with good charge transport, which usually plays a dominant role in the overall device performance. To develop high-efficiency PDI non-fullerene acceptors, the trade-off between the phase separation and strong π–π stacking should be considered.
Encouragingly, the efficiency of the champion PDI based device has been boosted to over 10%,39 which is very close to the high-efficiency of NF acceptors with an A–D–A structure, such as ITIC. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the PDI-based acceptors with a PCE over 7% involved ring-fusion of PDI units and only a few contained no fused structure.27,28,46–49
We focus on developing efficient PDI-based small molecular acceptors by a simple synthetic procedure. A large molecular skeleton and slightly twisted configuration are considered as a suitable geometry to achieve high electron mobility and good film-forming properties. Tetraphenylcarbon (TPC),50 tetraphenylethylene (TPE)30 and spirofluorene (SF)32,33 cores possess three-dimensional (3D) molecular structures, which usually results in highly twisted molecules. Moreover, one molecule with three or four PDI units in a limited periphery would be overcrowded due to the big fused ring aromatic structure of PDI. Therefore, the periphery of the core should be expanded. In 2017, Li and Wang et al. reported a high-efficiency NF acceptor (PBI-Por), which has four PDI units connected at the meso-positions of a porphyrin ring through acetenyl groups.46 In order to reduce the intramolecular steric hindrance of PDI-based acceptors, C–C triple bonds were also inserted between 3D51 or small52 cores and PDI units as linkages to give PCEs of 5.84% and 6.0%, respectively (Fig. 1). And also, in the past two years, other types of small molecular acceptors with ethynyl groups as linkers were developed.53,54 Here, through a simple synthetic strategy, we constructed a planar four-PDI based electron acceptor (Py-e-PDI) by introducing a planar pyrene unit as the core, which is a four fused ring structure of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Similarly, a C–C triple bond was used to link the pyrene core and PDI units for the sake of enlarging the distance between the pyrene core and PDI units (Fig. 2). A detailed investigation of the photophysical, electrochemical, and self-assembly properties was performed. This PDI derivative was also investigated as an NF acceptor pairing PTB7-Th to fabricate OSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of Py-e-PDI involves only a two-step reaction. Fig. 2a shows the synthetic route to convert 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene into the corresponding tetra acetylene derivative (3) with high yield. A further Sonogashira coupling reaction between compound 3 and mono-brominated PDI (Br-PDI) at a molar ratio of 1:6 afforded the desired four-arm molecule Py-e-PDI in moderate yields (around 50%). Although the PDI units bear two branching alkyl chains, Py-e-PDI is less soluble in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 than in aromatic solvents, such as toluene, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene. However, this limited solubility in CH2Cl2 does not affect the purification procedure through sol–gel column chromatography using CH2Cl2 mixed with a small amount of hexane as an eluent. The chemical structure of Py-e-PDI was confirmed by high-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy in ortho-dichlorobenzene-d4 (Fig. S2, ESI†), both low and high-resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
In order to reveal the intramolecular steric hindrance, the optimized ground state geometry of Py-e-PDI was calculated using the Gaussian 09 software package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory in the gas phase using density functional theory (DFT). In the calculations, the alkyl side chains of the molecule were replaced by methyl groups. The corresponding ground-state geometries (side view and top view) are shown in Fig. 2b. Normally, the introduction of a C–C triple bond can remarkably enlarge the space between two connected groups and thus largely reduce the steric hindrance between them. As expected, in the Py-e-PDI model, four PDI units lie nearly in the plane of the pyrene core with an interplanar angle of only 8°, which leads to less intramolecular twist. Such a geometry is beneficial for improving intermolecular packing and thus enhances the charge-transport ability of the NF acceptor.
Optical properties
The optical properties of Py-e-PDI were characterized using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of this PDI derivative in dilute toluene solution and in thin film. In toluene solution, Py-e-PDI showed several distinct absorption bands including a weak band in the shorter wavelength region and a strong band in the longer wavelength region (450–650 nm). Noticeably, an obvious vibronic structure was observed for both absorption bands. The shorter wavelength absorption band (300–450 nm) is associated with the 1,3,5,7-tetraethynylpyrene core,55 while the longer wavelength absorption originating from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is associated with the PDI derivative. Interestingly, in dilute solution, apart from the intense absorption in the region of 450–650 nm, a new small band at 606 nm appears for Py-e-PDI. However, this shoulder peak still exists even if the dilute solution was heated to 70 °C (Fig. S6, ESI†). It is obvious that the longest wavelength feature is not assigned to an aggregate-based feature and probably originates from pyrene-to-PDI charge-transfer. In thin film, the absorption band of Py-e-PDI is significantly broadened at the long-wavelength direction close to the absorption edge and extends the absorption onset to 675 nm, yielding an optical band gap of 1.83 eV. Additionally, the small absorption band at around 600 nm was clearly red-shifted (13 nm) and became more evident. But mostly importantly, to evaluate the new acceptor and maximize the cell efficiency, donor polymers with complementary absorption must be found. Fig. 3b shows that the absorptions of both PTB7 and PTB7-Th donor polymers are complementary to that of Py-e-PDI. Nevertheless, since the absorption of PTB7-Th mainly lies in the range of 550–800 nm, the PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI blends (Fig. 3c) could produce extended absorption spectra to favor solar energy harvesting.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry measurement was performed to determine the HOMO and LUMO of the novel PDI derivative. As shown in Fig. 3d, Py-e-PDI undergoes a reversible multiple-electron reduction originating from the successive reduction of the peripheral PDI units. The onset reduction potential and onset oxidation potential are found to be −0.54 and 1.50 V (versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)). Therefore, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels are calculated to be −3.86 eV and −5.90 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that, in comparison, the HOMO and LUMO offsets between PTB7-Th and Py-e-PDI are 0.68 eV and 0.20 eV, respectively. Although the LUMO offset is less than 0.3 eV, more and more studies revealed that an energy offset below 0.3 eV was also sufficient for charge separation in fullerene-free solar cells.56
Morphology of the self-assembled nanostructures
Now that solution-processed manufacturing technology is employed to fabricate the organic semiconductor materials into thin-film active layers in organic optoelectronic devices, in all probability, the intrinsic molecular self-assemblies of the organic materials are involved. The morphology of the self-assembled nanostructure of Py-e-PDI was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4, interestingly, planar Py-e-PDI assembled into a highly ordered structure. A close examination of the structures deposited from dilute toluene and chlorobenzene solutions revealed that some rectangular flakes with different sizes (from hundreds of nanometers to several microns) parallel to the substrate were formed (Fig. 4a and b). Moreover, for the sample prepared from chlorobenzene solution, thermal annealing results in a slight increase of order in the morphologies (Fig. 4e). Additional experiments with TEM confirmed the existence of micron flakes (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, electron diffraction has been used to determine the molecular packing structure of self-assembled small molecules. As shown in Fig. 4f, data quickly collected for Py-e-PDI showed patterns consistent with highly crystalline structures but are not sufficient for further analysis. In particular, it can be expected that a Py-e-PDI film with highly ordered morphologies will exhibit better charge transport properties.57

Photovoltaic performance

Py-e-PDI was used in bulk heterojunction solar cells, pairing PTB7-Th as the donor material due to its complementary absorptions and appropriately matched energy levels. OSCs were fabricated with the inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:Py-e-PDI/MoO3/Ag and tested under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. First, we performed the optimization of the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs of PTB7-Th:Py-e-PDI blends by changing the D/A weight ratios from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5. The details on the effects of the blend ratios, the thermal annealing and the thickness of active layers are provided in Table S1 (ESI†). The solar cells with a 1:1.5 blend ratio show an optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.10% with Jsc of 15.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.90 V, and FF of 49.8%. Similar to most of the reported PTB7-Th involved OSCs, thermal annealing has no positive role in improving the device performance based on the Py-e-PDI acceptor. Nevertheless, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive was proved to be effective to further enhance the performance of devices. As shown in Table 1, addition of a small amount of DIO (0.5% v/v) substantially improved the PCE from 6.10% to 7.59%, which is the highest PCE. It is worth noting that the PCE enhancement is due to the obvious increase of both FF and Jsc despite the reduced Voc. However, a deterioration of the performance is observed when continuing to increase the concentration of DIO. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized device are presented in Fig. 5a.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) plot of optimized solar cell devices based on Py-e-PDI is shown in Fig. 5b. The EQE curve covers a broad spectral response range from 300 to 800 nm. Apparently, the range of 330–580 nm is dominantly from the photocurrent contributed by NF acceptors. One can find that an obvious difference exists in the range of 300–400 nm when comparing the EQE curve with the absorption of the PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI blend film (Fig. 3c), indicating a less efficient incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency in this range.
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobilities of the pristine acceptor and blend films were measured. The structure of the hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al, and the structure of the electron-only devices is ITO/PFN/active layer/PFN/Al. The pure Py-e-PDI film exhibited a relatively high electron mobility (μe) of (3.77 ± 0.8) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, suggesting ordered molecular packing in pristine films. However, normally, when blending with donor polymers, the electron mobility decreased largely due to a reduced ordered structure. The PTB7-Th:Py-e-PDI blend with 0.5% DIO showed a hole mobility (μh) of (1.70 ± 0.4) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of (5.97 ± 0.7) × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Clearly, quite balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 2.8 ± 0.3) are observed for this optimized blend. SCLC J–V plots are provided in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to reveal the morphological structure of the as-cast pure Py-e-PDI and PTB7-Th films.58 As shown in Fig. 6(a), the lamellar distance of Py-e-PDI is 22.0 Å (q ∼ 0.285 Å−1), while the face to face stacking distance is 4.91 Å (q ∼ 1.28 Å−1) with a random orientation. PTB7-Th has a face-on orientation with a lamellar distance of 24.2 Å (q ∼ 0.260 Å−1) and a π–π stacking distance of 3.88 Å (q ∼ 1.62 Å−1). Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements were employed to investigate the nanoscale phase separation information of these blend thin films.59 The two-dimensional GISAXS patterns and the corresponding in-plane intensity profiles are presented in Fig. 6(b). We adopted a fractal-like network model to account for the scattering contribution from the acceptor domains. The uplift in the small q (<0.006 Å−1) regions was fitted with q−4 dependence to account for scattering resulting either from the surface roughness of the film or from the tail of a large amorphous regime.60 The acceptor domain sizes (2Rg) of the as-cast PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI film are estimated to be 42.2 nm. When 0.5% DIO was added, the domain size decreased substantially to 20.5 nm. The smaller pure phase domain size would be beneficial to the charge separation thus increasing Jsc and FF. The results are consistent with the device performance.

Conclusions
In this study, we introduced a pyrene unit as the core to generate moderately planar PDI-tetramer based NF acceptors. DFT calculations revealed that the nonfused Py-e-PDI displayed reduced intramolecular twisting owing to an acetylene linker and thus showed obvious crystallinity. GISAXS characterization showed that the acceptor domain sizes (2Rg) of the as-cast PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI film were estimated to be 42.2 nm. When 0.5% DIO was added, the domain size decreased substantially to 20.5 nm. The smaller pure phase domain size contributed to the effective charge separation thus increasing Jsc and FF. The optimized solar cells based on PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI (1:1.5, 0.5% DIO) have resulted in a PCE of up to 7.59%, which is among the highest reported efficiencies for nonfused PDI based acceptors. Most importantly, this result demonstrates that using PAH as the core combined with an acetylene spacer to construct multiple PDI derivatives is an effective strategy for designing high performance non-fullerene OSC acceptors.
Experimental
Materials
All reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used as received. Toluene was dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled prior to use. Triethylamine was dried over solid KOH.
Measurements and instruments
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 400 (1H NMR 400, 500 MHz) spectrometer. The mass spectra were obtained using an Ion-Spec 4.7 T HiRes MALDI instrument. UV absorption spectra were obtained using a Scinco S-3150 UV/vis spectrophotometer. TGA measurements were performed on a Netzsch TG209 apparatus. The electrochemical cyclic voltammogram was obtained using a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk, a Pt plate, and a standard calomel electrode (SCE) as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) CH2Cl2 solution or CH3CN solution. The surface morphologies of pure Py-e-PDI films were examined using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss ultra plus and HITACHI S-4800) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector. TEM was performed with a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operating at 200 kV. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern was collected using the same instrument. Samples for TEM were prepared by dropping on the amorphous carbon film supported on a copper grid.

DFT calculations. 
Geometry optimizations were carried out by the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G level. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program.

Device fabrication and characterization
Organic solar cells were fabricated on glass substrates commercially pre-coated with a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) with the inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:Py-e-PDI/MoO3/Ag. Prior to fabrication, the substrates were cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol consecutively every 15 min and then treated in an ultraviolet ozone generator for 15 min. A thin layer of sol–gel ZnO (≈40 nm) was spin coated onto precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates and then annealed at 180 °C for 15 min. The PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI active layers were deposited from 20 mg mL−1 solutions without or with DIO as the additive in chlorobenzene by spin-coating at 3000 rpm, resulting in an active layer thickness of about 100 nm. MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were evaporated through a shadow mask, giving an active area of 5.2 mm2 per device.
The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured with Keithley 2400 measurement source units at room temperature in air. The photocurrent was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300 W) at 100 mW cm−2, and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic reference cell. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured with a Stanford lock-in amplifier 8300 unit.
The hole and electron mobilities of Py-e-PDI and blends were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated in a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/pure Py-e-PDI or PTB7-Th/Py-e-PDI/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). Electron-only devices were fabricated in a structure of ITO/PFN/PTB7-Th:Py-e-PDI/PFN/Al. The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias using the SCLC expression described by the Mott–Gurney law.
Morphology characterization
GIWAXS and GISAXS measurements were carried out with a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline using a Cu X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus3R 300 K detector. The incidence angle is 0.2°.
Synthetic procedures

While stirring, the reaction mixture was heated to 60 °C and trimethylsilylethyne (0.28 g, 2.88 mmol) was injected. The resulting mixture was brought to reflux overnight and then cooled down to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water, and the layers were separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 three times, and the combined organic phase was washed with brine and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane) to afford compound 2 as an orange solid (228 mg) (yield: 81%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.61 (m, 4H), 8.32 (s, 2H), 0.38 (s, 36H).


Compound 3. 
Compound 2 (1 g, 1.7 mmol) was suspended in methanol (100 mL). K2CO3 (1.9 g, 13.6 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight and then poured into water (500 mL) and filtered. The filter was washed with water until the filtrate was neutral to afford compound 3 as a slightly brown solid (51 mg). Compound 3 is insoluble in common solvents and was used in the next reaction without NMR characterization.

To a 50 mL two necked round-bottom flask were added compound 3 (29.8 mg, 0.1 mmol), PDI-Br (416 mg, 0.5 mmol), anhydrous toluene (12 mL) and triethylamine (6 mL), and then the mixture was deoxygenated with argon for 30 min before Pd(PPh3)4 (11.55 mg, 0.01 mmol) and CuI (1.9 mg, 0.01 mmol) were added. The resulting mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 72 h under argon. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was quenched with water, and the layers were separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 three times, and the combined organic phase was washed with brine and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, CH2Cl2/hexane) to afford Py-e-PDI as a purple solid (155 mg) (yield: 48%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4) δ 10.41–11.26 (m, 4H), 9.14–9.82 (m, 10H), 8.61–9.09 (m, 8H), 8.09–8.50 (m, 12H), 5.43–5.73 (s, 4H),4.87–5.33 (m, 4H), 0.55–2.77(m, 208H).
