    , Accepted 12th February 2018First published on 14th February 2018AbstractDue to the use of a low-temperature solution process and the absence of hysteresis, PEDOT:PSS based p–i–n perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have some obvious advantages, such as simple device technology, suitability for flexible and large size substrates, and long-term stability. However, so far their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been much lower than that of other types of PVSCs, and in particular, they have a much lower open-circuit voltage (VOC). In this research, PEDOT:PSS based PVSCs achieve a large enhancement of VOC, PCE and device stability by using 2D materials like graphene oxide (GO) and MoS2 as interfacial layers. The CH3NH3PbI3 based PVSC with the GO and MoS2 layers shows an increased VOC from 0.962 to 1.135 V and an enhanced PCE from 14.15% to 19.14%. When a Br-doped perovskite of CH3NH3PbI2.5Br0.5 is used as the active layer, the VOC is enhanced from 1.010 to 1.176 V. The modified energy match at electrode interfaces plays a key role in the enhancement of device performance. This work indicates that 2D materials are important materials for use in interfaces of perovskite solar cells to largely enhance device performance and stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years due to the simple growth process of perovskite semiconductor crystals, high carrier mobility, long charge diffusion length, low trap-state densities and intense broadband absorption.1–5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) reported in the literature increased rapidly from 3.8% in 2009 to 22.1% in 2017.6,7 With internal quantum efficiency close to 100% in the absorption spectrum range,8,9 photocurrents in PVSCs will approach the theoretical limits due to light absorption. Therefore, it is significantly important to enhance the open-circuit voltages (VOC) to achieve a breakthrough in the PCE. As is known, the perovskite material CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) has a bandgap of 1.55 eV,10 so the devices based on MAPbI3 films could exhibit a VOC that can be as high as 1.25 V.11,12 However, the voltage obtained in practice is usually much lower than this value. The reasons for the voltage loss are complex and not completely clear, but it is usually thought that carrier recombination in devices, including the recombination at grain boundaries and interfaces, is a key factor.13,14
The solar cells based on perovskite materials are found in two types of device structures, the n–i–p mesoscopic structure and the p–i–n planar structure. For the latter, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS) is usually used as the hole transport layer (HTL), while phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is usually used as the electron transport layer (ETL). Compared with the other structures, the p–i–n structure shows large commercial potential because of its obvious advantages such as low-temperature processes, simplified device fabrication, and feasibility of large-scale and flexible manufacturing.15,16 Zhu et al. reported a p–i–n PVSC with a PEDOT:PSS HTL with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3% and a stabilized output PCE of 17.6% by utilizing methylammonium bromide (MABr) as an additive in a Pb(Ac)2-based precursor solution.17 Fung et al. introduced PEDOT:PSS doped with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) as the HTL to obtain a p–i–n PVSC with a PCE of 17.22%.18 Yang et al. modified the HTL of PEDOT:PSS with grafted sulfonated-acetone-formaldehyde lignin (PEDOT:GSL) to increase the work-function of the HTL and achieved a PCE of 17.8%.19
Despite these advances, PEDOT:PSS-based p–i–n PVSCs still have a much lower PCE than PVSCs with a conventional n–i–p structure. Moreover, in the devices with the p–i–n structure, using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL usually results in a device performance weaker than using other HTL materials such as metal oxides and organic materials. For example, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was used by Huang et al. to obtain a PCE of 19.4% with a VOC of 1.13 V,20 and their devices recently showed an enhanced PCE up to a certified value of 20.59 ± 0.45% by defect passivation.21 CuI was also introduced in inverted planar perovskite solar cells, and a PCE of 19.9% was obtained along with a VOC of 1.1 V.22 Wang et al. used the organic molecule 4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl) benzenamine] (TAPC) to replace the PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, leading to enhanced PCEs of the p–i–n solar cells from 12.90 to 18.80%.23 NiOx is another efficient hole transport material. Choy et al. reported a simple and low-temperature solution process to obtain high stability and reproducibility in flexible PVSCs with a NiOx HTL. The high hole extraction ability of NiOx led to high efficiencies above 17% on ITO and 14% on flexible substrates.24,25 These examples indicate that PEDOT:PSS-based PVSCs still have large room for performance enhancement relative to other types of PVSCs. The low VOC is an important factor that gives rise to the weak PCE of PVSCs with a PEDOT:PSS HTL. In previous reports, the VOC of p–i–n PVSCs with a single PEDOT:PSS HTL is a little higher than 1.0 V.
The mismatch of the energy levels at contact interfaces, including the interface between the HTL and the perovskite film and the interface between the ETL and metal cathode, was found to be the main factor that leads to non-radiative recombination for energy losses and decreased output voltage.26,27 On the anode side, the work-function of PEDOT:PSS is approximately 5.0 eV, which weakly matches with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of MAPbI3 (−5.4 eV). On the cathode side, a stable metal such as Ag and Au is usually used because an active metal easily undergoes a chemical reaction to degrade the device. However, the work functions of Ag (4.7 eV) and Au (5.1 eV) have a huge mismatch with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of PCBM (−4.0 eV). Therefore, energy level matching is crucial for further enhancing the VOC and PCE. Insertion of interfacial layers has been demonstrated to be a feasible method for tuning the surface work-function for improving the energy level match in organic solar cells28,29 and perovskite solar cells.30–33 The range of possible interfacial materials is very wide, covering inorganic compounds, metal oxides, organic small molecules, conjugated or insulating polymers, zwitterions, and biomolecules. However, to date, there are still few interfacial materials demonstrating planar MAPbI3 PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL achieving a high VOC > 1.1 V and PCE > 19%.
In this work, we employ two typical two-dimensional (2D) materials, graphene oxide (GO) and MoS2, as interfacial layers to enhance the energy level matching. GO exhibits a high work-function, which is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS and better matches with the HOMO of perovskite MAPbI3. MoS2 has an effective result in reducing the work-function of the Ag surface to modify the match of the work-function of the cathode with the LUMO of PCBM. In addition, these 2D materials possess excellent electrical, optical and frictional properties. Due to the ingenious energy match in the device as well as the specific electric and chemical properties of the 2D materials, the PEDOT:PSS-based PVSCs achieve a substantial enhancement of VOC, PCE and stability.
Results and discussion
The device structure of PVSCs is a p–i–n structure as shown in Fig. 1(a), and the cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Fig. S1,† where ITO covered by PEDOT:PSS and metal Ag act as the anode and cathode, respectively, while MAPbI3 is used as the light absorption layer (about 350 nm), and PC61BM is used as the electron transport layer. A thin layer of MoS2 of 2 to 5 nm is thermally evaporated on top of PC61BM for the energy match with the Ag electrode, while a spin-coated thin film of GO blended with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) is used to increase the work-function of PEDOT:PSS to make it match with the energy level of the perovskite layer. The AFM image of MoS2 on top of PCBM is shown in Fig. S2b,† and the AFM image of the PEG:GO film on the surface of PEDOT:PSS is shown in Fig. S2a.† The schematic energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 1(b). In the original device, the work-function of the Ag metal cathode (4.7 eV) is too high to match well with the LUMO level of PCBM (4.0 eV). In the new device, the work-function of the anode is increased to near the HOMO level of MAPbI3, as well as the MoS2 modified Ag electrode has a lowered work-function to be close to the LUMO of PCBM.

The perovskite films are prepared by a simple one-step method and a rapid film-forming process without any other anti-solvents and vacuum flash-assisted processes, as shown in Fig. 1(c), which is exactly suitable for the actual large-scale commercial production. The high weight ratio of the organic amino hydrochloride additive plays a key role in the rapid growth of high quality perovskite films. The process of film preparation is similar to the one reported in our earlier research.34 Based on the previously reported work, the fabrication in this research involves many optimizations for the modification of the device performance characteristics. The optimization process mainly includes device fabrication techniques such as preheating treatment of the substrates for the spin-coating of PEDOT:PSS, the heating temperature and time of PEDOT:PSS prior to the spin-coating of the perovskite solution, and the thickness of the Ag electrode. The details of the optimized technique are shown in the “Experimental Section”. The performance characteristics of the original ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag device before and after optimizations are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1.†
To evaluate the effects of the insertion of the GO and MoS2 interlayers on the performance of PVSCs, various device parameters were measured. The J–V characteristics of the devices with and without the two modified layers are presented in Fig. 2(a), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the PVSCs are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2(b) shows the EQEs of the devices which are exactly consistent with their short circuit currents (JSC) as shown in Table 1. The results show that the original device without any interfacial modification has an average VOC of 0.962 V and a PCE of 14.15%. After the insertion of the MoS2 layer between the PCBM and the Ag, an obvious enhancement of the average performance is observed, with the PCE increasing to 16.89%, along with the increase of VOC, JSC and FF to 1.062 V, 22.423 mA cm−2 and 71.0%, respectively. The VOC displays a great increase of 0.1 V. This improvement is attributed to the reduced work-function of the Ag surface after the insertion of MoS2. Fig. 3(a) shows that the work-function is reduced by about 0.5 eV from Ag to MoS2/Ag. Without the MoS2, the work-function of Ag (4.7 eV) has a large difference from the LUMO of PCBM (−4.0 eV), easily producing a Schottky barrier at the Ag/PCBM interface to block the electron collection. With the MoS2 layer, an enhanced ohmic contact can facilitate the rapid transfer of electrons across the MoS2/Ag interface for collection. Meanwhile, the MoS2 layer also acts as a hole blocking layer to decrease the recombination at the interface near the cathode. As shown in Fig. S4,† the dark currents of the devices show an obvious decrease after the insertion of MoS2, indicating the charge blocking role of the interfacial layers. The original mechanisms of the work-function reduction can be due to the dipole formation of MoS2 on the surface of Ag and/or the intrinsic electronic properties of MoS2. As a 2D semiconductor, MoS2 has its featured intrinsic electronic properties, which are different from those of other materials used as the modifiers of interfaces. It is believed that the electronic properties could play important roles in the work-function reduction, and they are interesting and worth studying in detail in our future research studies.

As is well known, MoS2 with a single layer or several layers has structures similar to that of graphene and better electrical properties with a direct bandgap of 1.9 eV, but with the increase of the number of layers, the energy levels can be adjusted to give an indirect bandgap of 1.2 eV.35,36 This could be detrimental to the device performance. To prove these estimations, some investigations were made to study the effect of MoS2 thickness on the device performance. As shown in Fig. S5(a) and Table S2,† the results of PVSCs with different thicknesses of MoS2 show that the optimal thickness is 3 nm. Up to 5 nm, the VOC and the total performance show a rapid reduction. As shown in Fig. S5(b),† all devices exhibit an EQE spectrum covering the range from the visible to the near-IR regime (from 300 to 800 nm). When the thickness of MoS2 increases to 3 nm, a higher EQE leads to the increase of JSC from 21.743 to 22.423 mA cm−2. In contrast, the device with the 5 nm MoS2 layer exhibits a sharp decline of EQE from approximately 90% to 70%. The EQE results also imply that a MoS2 thickness of 3 nm is the most suitable. These results are very consistent with the predictions based on the dependence of the bandgap on the layers of MoS2.
Based on the results for the device with the MoS2 layer, GO:PEG is used to remedy the low work-function of PEDOT:PSS that has a mismatch with the HOMO of the MAPbI3 layer. Here, the GO:PEG film had an ultra-thin thickness of about 1 nm, which was measured by AFM, as shown in Fig. S6.†Fig. 2(a) shows that the solar cells display a further increase of the average PCE up to 19.14%. The increased PCE is mainly due to the large enhancement of the VOC that is high up to 1.135 V. This enhancement is attributed to the higher work-function of GO than PEDOT:PSS, which better matches with the HOMO of MAPbI3. Using UPS measurements, the work-functions of PEDOT:PSS/GO:PEG and bare PEDOT:PSS are approximately 5.26 eV and 4.9 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The better energy level matching of the interface between GO and MAPbI3 as well as the interface between MoS2 and Ag reduces the recombination of carriers at the two electrode interfaces, leading to a large enhancement of VOC and PCE.
To further discover the effect of the interfacial layers on the device performance, we investigated the PVSCs in which a Br-doped perovskite of MAPbI2.5Br0.5 is used to replace MAPbI3 as the active layer. From the results shown in Fig. 2(c), the VOC is enhanced from 1.010 to 1.176 V after the interfacial modification. The value of VOC was very high in previously reported PVSCs with high PCEs around 20%.
Using the data of 30 samples for each device, the statistical distributions of the obtained PCE values are shown in Fig. 2(d). For the two-IL device with both MoS2 and GO, the PCE is mostly located in the range of 17–19% with the fitting line sharper than that of the other two devices. This means that an interfacial layer may not only enhance the device performance but also increase reproducibility. The PCE shows high reproducibility when GO is used, which can be attributed to the effect of GO on the quality of the perovskite film as shown in Fig. 4. The grain size of the perovskite film on top of the GO-covered PEDOT:PSS is increased to 1 μm (Fig. 4(b)) from 0.5 μm (Fig. 4(a)) of the film on the bare PEDOT:PSS. The perovskite film grains in Fig. 4(b) are also more homogeneous and smoother than those in Fig. 4(a). All these crystal characteristics lead to the better light response of the perovskite film in the near-infrared (NI) region of the spectrum. Many researchers have proved that solar cell performances could be obviously enhanced by enlarging the grain size of perovskite films.8,37 In particular, Li et. al.8 demonstrated that the smoother, more compact morphology of perovskite films with larger grains led to a much stronger absorbance in the 500–800 nm range. This is also consistent with the results that, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the EQE near the absorption edge is greatly strengthened after the insertion of GO. This indicates that the GO layer can modify the crystal morphology of perovskite films to lead to large grains, which can decrease the defect concentration and slow down non-radiative recombination, increasing the VOC.

From the curve fitting of dark current curves in Fig. S4,† the main parameter ideality factor (η) which reflects carrier recombination on interfaces can be calculated using the equation38 (1)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the operating temperature (here 300 K) and q is the elementary charge. For the device without a modified interface, the ideality factor is 4.30, and as single and coupled interfacial layers are introduced, the ideality factor decreases to 1.91 and 0.84, respectively. As the ideality factor comes close to unity, it means that the device is more like an ideal diode. The lower leakage current and the ideality factor demonstrate that the application of the interfacial layer leads to reduction of carrier recombination. This result agrees with the increase of VOC and FF shown in Fig. 2.
To investigate the electrode contact influenced by different ILs, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. All samples were tested in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 2 Hz with a bias of 1.0 V. Then, we obtained the typical Nyquist plots illustrated in Fig. 5(a and b). The inset figures show the equivalent circuit used to fit the tested curves. Here, the series resistance (RS) is generally affected by the interfacial contact between different layers. R1 represents the mass transfer resistances in parallel with the chemical capacitance CPE1 in EIS.39,40Rs is related to the contact resistances of the interfaces which indicates charge transfer from one layer to the other layer. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and Table S3,† when GO:PEG is deposited on PEDOT:PSS, RS decreases from 30 to 20 Ω, while R1 increases from 1660 Ω to 2970 Ω. The same phenomenon is found when MoS2 is used, and is shown in Fig. 5(b). The results could be attributed to the enhanced ohmic contact at the interfaces with the modification layers, which leads to the reduction of the series resistance (Rs). Thus, both JSC and FF are enhanced so that the PCE of the solar cells is increased.

The equivalent circuits are shown in the insets. Normalized transient photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra (fitting data) of (c) perovskite films on ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/GO:PEG and (d) the films of MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag and MAPbI3/PCBM/MoS2/Ag, respectively (excitation wavelength: 700 nm pulsed laser). 
To further investigate the charge dynamics for PVSCs with different ILs, time-resolved transient PL measurements were carried out. For the PL measurements, there are two quenching processes: the fast decay process (τ1) for quenching via trap states or interfacial charge transfer and the longer quenching process (τ2) for recombination.41,42 Here, a biexponential decay model was utilized to fit the PL decay curves as follows: (2)
According to the PL decay curves and fitting data in Fig. 5(c and d), the decay time is summarized in Table S4.† When a perovskite film is deposited on ITO/PEDOT:PSS, τ1 and τ2 are 4.4 ns and 35.0 ns, respectively. When GO:PEG is introduced, both τ1 and τ2 decrease, down to 1.8 ns and 15.2 ns. Here, τ1 is mainly dependent on the time of carrier extraction from the perovskite to the carrier transport layers, and τ2 can represent the decay partly in the perovskite material and partly at the interface. For the part of τ2 in the perovskite material, longer time is preferred because it means less recombination and fewer defects in the perovskite, which generally exist in a high-quality film. However, for the part of τ2 at the interface, shorter time is preferred because it will be strongly dependent on the charge transfer between the two materials at the interface. A fast charge transfer at the interface will obviously reduce the decay time. In this work, the film quality is enhanced as shown in Fig. 4 which shows compact and smooth films with larger crystal sizes after the insertion of the interfacial layer. Therefore, the shorter τ2 after the modification is mainly due to the fast charge transfer at the interface, which is consistent with the shorter τ1 in the case. Therefore, PEDOT:PSS/GO:PEG shows more efficient electron extraction than the PEDOT:PSS at the interface. These data are in accordance with the above results shown in EIS figures. With the same results, after MoS2 is used, τ1 and τ2 also decrease, which proves that the interfacial MoS2 layer makes the electrons transfer faster from the perovskite film to the Ag cathode, in accordance with the above discussion of energy levels. These data indicate that either MoS2 or GO:PEG as the interfacial layer greatly promotes charge extraction and transfer and prevents charge recombination at the interfaces.
To investigate the device stability, steady-state measurements of JSC, VOC and PCE values for the device with or without different interfacial layers are compared. Fig. 6(a) shows the change of the device performance at different times via the process of the illumination of the solar cells under one simulated solar light with AM1.5 G. After 400 min, the JSC, VOC and PCE of the device without any interfacial layer obviously decrease and they change from 21.7 mA cm−2, 0.962 V, and 14.1% to 20.7 mA cm−2, 0.94 V and 13.0%, respectively. With a single MoS2 layer, there is a slight decrease of the device performance. With both MoS2 and GO layers, the stability of the device is strongly improved. In this case, the JSC fluctuates in a very small range, while the VOC and PCE are nearly steady. The enhancement of device stability can mainly be attributed to the blocked diffusion of the ions at the PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 and PCBM/Ag interfaces.43 Because PEDOT:PSS is an acidic polymer, it also may etch the conductive ITO electrode and decompose the perovskite to affect the device stability.44 Moreover, according to our previous report45 and the results in this research, the introduction of a 2D material into the carrier transport layers or electrode interfaces will significantly favor the stability of perovskite based solar cells. The reasons are unknown, but we believe that the feature of the 2D layered structure with good chemical stability and ion implantation capability into the layer structure for steadiness plays an important role in the long-term stability.
 Fig. 6  (a) Steady-state measurements of JSC, VOC and PCE for devices with different ILs. (b) Devices measured using a forward scan model and reverse scan model (50 mV s−1). (c) Devices measured with different scanning steps: 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 2 mV. The measurement was tested under illumination in a glovebox without device encapsulation. And the steady-state power output of the perovskite solar cells was measured real-time under a constant voltage bias at the maximum power-point. 
The effects of MoS2 on device lifetime are also investigated by observing the chemical reaction in the perovskite solar cells. In general, they show high chemical activity between the metal and MAPbI3.46 This is one of the main reasons that most perovskite solar cells use highly stable metals, such as Au and Ag, as the metal electrode. As shown in Fig. S7,† the XRD spectrum discloses that, when MoS2 is introduced, ions such as I− can be blocked so that the reaction between MAPbI3 and Ag will be limited. This ion transfer limit has been proved in the above EIS tests. If no MoS2 is deposited in the device, the perovskite film has degradation as shown in the upper curves of Fig. S7(b)† which exhibits some new peaks (marked with blue “*”), compared with the XRD spectrum of the original MAPbI3 (marked with black ★). Also, from the image of the devices, the Ag electrode is destructed seriously. After MoS2 is used, the destruction phenomenon disappears. When Ag is replaced with Al as the metal cathode in the device with the MoS2 layer, the performance has no obvious change, as shown in Table S5.† The results imply that interfacial stability is independent of the type of metal after the MoS2 insertion.
Compared with the common PVSCs with a mesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) of TiO2, inverted planar heterojunction PVSCs with an ETL of PCBM have an important advantage in that their J–V curves do not show any hysteresis phenomenon. The hysteresis characteristics of the solar cells in this research are also investigated. The results are also shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6(b), the J–V curve obtained from forward scanning is nearly the same as that obtained from reverse scanning. Additionally, the J–V curves recorded from the measurements via different scanning steps of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 2 mV are shown in Fig. 6(c). The J–V characteristics show little dependence on the scanning step. These results indicate that the PVSCs do not exhibit a hysteresis phenomenon.

Preparation of graphene oxide (GO)
GO used in this work was synthesized via a modified Hummers' method reported in our previous work.47 A total of 25 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was instilled into a mixture of 1.0 g of graphite and 0.6 g of NaNO3 (sodium nitrate) at room temperature. Then, 3.7 g of KMnO4 (potassium permanganate) was added slowly to keep the reaction temperature below 5 °C. Sulfuric acid was inserted into the graphite layers at this stage. The reaction temperature of the mixture was kept at 35 °C with stirring for 2 h and then was increased to 60 °C for heating for 6 h. Then, 45 mL of water was slowly poured into the solution under vigorous stirring, and a dark brown suspension was produced. The suspension was treated further by adding a mixture of aqueous hydrogen peroxide (3.5 mL, 34.5%) and water (22.5 mL) to convert the residual permanganate and manganese dioxide into soluble manganese sulfate. Graphene oxides were separated from the reaction mixture by ultrasonication. The graphene oxide powder was washed 3 times with diluted hydrochloric acid (1.0 mol L−1, 25 mL). Ultrasonic treatment was carried out for 10 minutes before washing. The obtained product was dried for 24 h under vacuum and placed in a dryer with low humidity. The prepared GO was ground and dissolved in absolute ethyl alcohol with PEG. The concentrations of GO and PEG were 10 mg mL−1 and 1 mg mL−1, respectively. The fabricated solution was ultrasonically treated and stirred to be completely dissolved.
Characterization of materials
Perovskite films deposited on different substrates such as PEDOT:PSS or its surface modified with GO:PEG were examined with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4700). The thicknesses of the films in perovskite solar cells used in this paper (shown in Fig. 1(b)) were measured with a step profiler (Dektak-150, Veeco) for PEDOT:PSS, perovskite, and PCBM and an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker icon) for GO:PEG (shown in Fig. S6†). The work-function of the film surfaces reported in this work was measured by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). UPS measurements were performed with an unfiltered He (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp and a total instrumental energy resolution of 100 meV. The kinetic energy (EK) can be determined using the equation: EK = hν − EB(3)where hν is the energy of UV which is equal to 21.2 eV, EB is the binding energy in the original UPS spectrum. And the work function is the low energy cutoff of kinetic energy in the UPS spectrum.
Fabrication and characterization of perovskite solar cells
MAI, PbI2 and DEACl were dissolved in DMF with a molar ratio of 1:1:0.4. The concentration of MAI was 1 M (mol L−1). The MAPbI3 solution was stirred on a hot plate at a temperature of 70 °C for 12 hours. PEDOT:PSS (4083) was spin-coated on ITO, which was preheated on a hot plate at the temperature of 75 °C for 5 min, at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and annealed on a hot plate at 130 °C for 15 minutes in a N2 glovebox. Some samples were treated with the prepared GO:PEG solution. The GO:PEG solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS film at a rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hot plate at a temperature of 90 °C for 30 min. The MAPbI3 and DEACl mixture solution was spin-coated on top of the substrates with the PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS/GO:PEG layer to produce a perovskite film with the rate of 4000 rpm for 30 seconds, and annealed on a hot plate at 90 °C for 10 minutes. After the perovskite film was formed, an ETL (electron transfer material) (15 mg of PCBM was added into 1 mL of chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at a rate of 1500 rpm for 30 seconds. Finally, different thicknesses of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and 140 nm of silver (Ag) were successively deposited on top of the PCBM layer via a thermal evaporation process in a vacuum chamber with a pressure of less than 10−4 Pa. The typical active area of the devices was approximately 0.12 cm2, as determined using a shadow mask during the top electrode evaporation. The solar light source was simulated by AM 1.5 sunlight with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 provided by a solar simulator. The current density (J)–voltage (V) was recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out with a quantum efficiency (QE)/IPCE measurement system (SR830, Stanford Research Systems). A standard Si photodiode calibrated from Hamamatsu was tested as a reference prior to each sample measurement. J–V measurements were carried out in a N2 glovebox, and EQE was measured in air under the conditions of the devices with encapsulation. Steady-state measurements of the solar cell devices were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (CS150H, Wuhan Corrtest Instruments Corp., Ltd.). In the stability tests, the device was tested under continuous illumination in a glovebox with no encapsulation. The steady-state power output of the perovskite solar cells was measured real-time under a constant voltage bias at the maximum power-point. Time-resolved transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PL spectrometer, FLS 900, Edinburgh Instruments, excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-445) and measured at 405 nm after excitation. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were done using a frequency response analyzer (PSM1735 NumetriQ) from 1 Hz to 106 Hz under dark conditions at a 1 V applied bias.
Conclusions
In summary, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), power conversion efficiency (PCE) and device stability are strongly enhanced by employing interfacial layers of 2D graphene oxide (GO) and MoS2 materials to promote energy matching in the PEDOT:PSS-based p–i–n PVSCs. With CH3NH3PbI3 as the perovskite active layer, the device with both GO and MoS2 has a VOC of 1.135 V and a PCE up to 19.14%. When CH3NH3PbI2.5Br0.5 replaced the MAPbI3 as the active layer, the VOC is enhanced from 1.010 to 1.176 V after the interfacial modification. These results show that PEDOT:PSS-based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) display high potential for obtaining high device performance comparable to or even greater than that of the other types of perovskite solar cells with high efficiency but a complex and sensitive fabrication process. The obvious advantages, such as simple device technology, low-temperature solution processes for suitability on flexible and large size substrates, and no hysteresis phenomenon for long-term stability, make PEDOT:PSS-based PVSCs very suitable for commercial production. This work indicates that 2D materials are important materials for promoting energy match of the electrode surface to enhance the VOC, PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells, thus providing a novel and interesting pathway to achieve high-efficiency and long-lifetime perovskite devices.
