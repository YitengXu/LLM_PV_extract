    , Accepted 23rd June 2014First published on 25th June 2014AbstractPyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline was first employed as a π-linker in D–π–A type dyes, exhibiting an unusually broad and intense spectral absorption ranged from the visible to the near infrared region. A power conversion efficiency of 6.86% was achieved in dye-sensitized solar cells.
Introduction
As one of the most promising alternatives to the conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted intense attention due to their potentially low-cost production and high conversion efficiencies.1 In the DSC, a monolayer of sensitizer molecules adsorbed on a mesoporous oxide film (usually TiO2) is employed to extend the light absorption window of the photoanode in the solar spectral region, exerting a significant influence on the power conversion and stability of the devices. DSCs with ruthenium complexes achieved a high power conversion efficiency of up to 12%.2 On the other hand, a large number of organic dyes have been developed over the past two decades because of their molecularly tailored flexibility, raw-material abundance, and high efficiencies comparable to Ru complex-based DSCs.3
Organic dyes used in DSCs commonly consist of an electron donor and an electron acceptor linked by a π-conjugation linker (i.e., typically D–π–A configuration). Accordingly, different π-conjugated linkers have been utilized to bridge a donor (such as triarylamines) and an acceptor (like cyanoacrylic acid).3 In fact, the π-linker is of paramount importance in tuning the energy gap as well as the electronic and steric properties of the dye molecule, which would strongly affect the device performances. Especially, linkers with the electron-poor property such as benzothiadiazole,4 benzotriazole,5 quinoxaline,6 diketopyrrolopyrrole,7 squaraine,8 boradiazaindacene,9 isoindigo,10 and phthalimide11 were preferred to develop low-band gap sensitizers for improving light harvesting ability in the red and near-infrared region.
Pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline (PQ) is an electron-deficient and rigid unit, and has been extensively employed as a building block in combination with different electron-donating units in constructing low-band gap polymers for bulk heterojunction solar cells.12 In this article, we first introduced pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline into two small molecular organic dyes for DSCs, where pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline as a linker to bridge a triarylamine donor and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. The two dyes were denoted as PQ-1 and PQ-2, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Structures of pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline-bridged donor–acceptor dyes PQ-1 and PQ-2. 
The incorporation of PQ into the dye molecules efficiently extends the spectral absorption range in the visible and infrared region due to their electron-deficient and rigid properties. In addition, the rigid and planar PQ favors a charge transfer from a triarylamine donor to a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. It should be noted that the dyes with a planar and rigid PQ unit may easily aggregate on a TiO2 surface through the cofacial π–π interactions between the macrocycle discs, which would deteriorate the device performances. With this in mind, four lateral bulky alkoxy-substituted phenyl units were specifically introduced onto the planar PQ to reduce the molecular aggregation and increase the solubility. In our experiment, the DSC based on dye PQ-1 gave the power conversion efficiency of 6.86% under standard AM 1.5 conditions.
Experimental section
Measurement and characterization
NMR spectra were recorded using a BRUKER AVANCE 400 MHz instrument. The residual solvent protons (1H) or the solvent carbons (13C) were used as internal standards. 1H NMR data are presented as follows: the chemical shift in ppm (δ) downfield from tetramethylsilane (multiplicity, coupling constant (Hz), and integration). The following abbreviations are used in reporting NMR data: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; and m, multiplet. IR spectra were recorded using a BRUKER EQUINOX55 instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were acquired using a Bruker Daltonics Inc. spectrometer. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded at room temperature using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2, Oriel, 67005). The action spectra of the monochromatic incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were collected using a commercial setup (PV-25 DYE, JASCO). A 300 W xenon lamp was employed as the light source for generation of a monochromatic beam. Calibrations were performed with a standard silicon photodiode. The IPCE is defined as IPCE (λ) = hcJsc/eφλ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, e is the electronic charge, λ is the wavelength in meters (m), Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density (A m−2), and φ is the incident radiation flux (W m−2).
Materials
All of solvents were purified according to standard methods. All reagents were commercially obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. and J&K Chemical Co. and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. All manipulations involving air-sensitive reagents were performed in an atmosphere of dry argon. 4,7-Dibromo-5,6-dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) was synthesized according to the reference procedure.13
Synthesis of 4
The compound 1 (0.60 g, 1.6 mmol) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (30 mL), followed by adding activated zinc powder (2.4 g) in one portion. After stirring at 70 °C for 1 h, the solution mixture including the intermediate 3,6-dibromo-1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine 3 which was extremely sensitive to air was filtered to remove the unreactive zinc powder. To the filtrate was added 4,4′-(hexyloxy)benzil (1.3 g, 3.2 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 100 °C for another 20 h. After removal of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL), washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution (100 mL), water (100 mL), and brine (100 mL), respectively. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, concentrated in vacuum and purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluting with dichloromethane–petroleum ether, 20/50, v/v) to afford the quinoxaline product 4 (0.33 g, 20%) as an orange solid. M.p. 175–177 °C 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 0.92 (t, J = 13.2 Hz, 12H), 1.26–1.54 (m, 24H), 1.78–1.84 (m, 8H), 4.00 (t, J = 12.9 Hz, 8H), 6.91 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 8H), 7.77 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 8H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz): δ 160.86, 154.37, 138.17, 131.91, 130.44, 114.41, 68.16, 31.59, 29.17, 25.71, 22.61, 14.05.

Synthesis of 5
A mixture of the compound 4 (150 mg, 0.14 mmol), 4-(bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino)phenylboronic acid (70 mg, 0.17 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (25 mg, 15 mol% relative to the compound 4), K2CO3 (83 mg, 0.6 mmol) in toluene (20 mL) and H2O (3 mL) was refluxed for 15 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After removal of the solvents, the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), washed with brine (50 mL), and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluting with dichloromethane–petroleum ether 20/50, v/v) to afford a mixture of compound 5 and the double cross-coupling compound. The mixed products were difficult to separate and thus the crude compound 5 was directly used in the next reaction.
Synthesis of 6
A mixture of the crude compound 5 (150 mg), 4-formylphenylboronic acid (25 mg, 0.17 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (20 mg, 15%mol), K2CO3 (69 mg, 0.5 mmol) in toluene (20 mL) and H2O (3 mL) was refluxed for 15 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After removal of the solvents, the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), washed with brine (50 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvent, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluting with dichloromethane–petroleum ether 20/50, v/v) to afford the crude compound 6 (95 mg, 62%) as a brown solid which was unpurified and directly used in the next reaction.
Synthesis of PQ-1
To a solution of the crude compound 6 (95 mg), cyanoacetic acid (10 mg, 0.12 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) was added a few drops of piperdine and then the reaction mixture was refluxed for 8 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the completion of the reaction, acetic acid (2 mL) was added into the mixture, and the solvents were removed under a reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), washed with water (30 mL) and brine (30 mL), respectively. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvents, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluting with methanol–dichloromethane 10/100, v/v) to afford the dye PQ-1 (56 mg, 56%) as a deep brown solid.

DSC fabrication
Nanocrystalline TiO2 pastes (particle size, 20 nm) were prepared using a previously reported procedure.14 Fluorine doped thin oxide (FTO, 4 mm thickness, 10 ohm sq−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) conducting electrodes were washed with soap and water, followed by sonication for 10 min in acetone and isopropanol, respectively. Following a period of drying, the electrodes were submerged in a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 75 °C, and then washed with water and ethanol. Using the electrodes, an 11 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and a 6 μm thick TiO2 light scattering layer (particle size, 400 nm, PST-400C) were prepared by the screen-printing method. The TiO2 electrodes were heated at 500 °C for 30 min, followed by treatment with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 75 °C and subsequent sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The thickness of TiO2 films was measured using a profiler, Sloan, Dektake.
The electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.2 mM PQ-1 or PQ-2 and 20 mM 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid) in a mixed solvent of 4-tert-butanol–acetonitrile–tetrahydrofuran (1:1:0.2, v/v/v) and kept for 24 h at room temperature. The dyed electrodes were then rinsed with the mixed solvent to remove the excess dye. A platinum-coated counter electrode was prepared according to a previous report,15 and two holes were drilled on its opposite sides. The two electrodes were sealed together with a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through one of the two holes into the counter electrode, and the holes were sealed with the thermoplastic Surlyn. The electrolyte contains 0.68 M dimethyl imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.10 M LiI, 0.05 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.40 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). All the devices were prepared with a photoactive area of about 0.3 cm2, and a metal mask of 0.165 cm2 was used to cover the device for photovoltaic property measurements.
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties
As an example, the synthetic route to PQ-1 is schematically presented in Scheme 1. The UV-vis absorption spectra of PQ-1 and PQ-2 in dichloromethane solution are presented in Fig. 2. Both PQ-1 and PQ-2 exhibited similar absorption features with two absorption bands in the visible region. The band at 484 nm (PQ-1) or 510 nm (PQ-2) corresponds to the π–π* transition of the conjugated system. The longest wavelength absorption of PQ-1 (λmax = 565 nm) is assigned to a charge transfer (CT) transition, being significantly blue-shifted compared to the CT-band of PQ-2 (λmax = 638 nm). The blue-shift means a larger torsion produced at the both ends of pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline with the two adjacent phenyl units in PQ-1 than with the two thienyls in PQ-2. The absorption spectra of both the dyes adsorbed on 3 micrometer transparent TiO2 films show features similar to those in the corresponding solutions. PQ-2, however, shows a large red-shift of 26 nm mainly due to the strong aggregation on the TiO2 surface. Their fluorescence emission spectra were recorded as shown in Fig. S1.† The photophysical properties of the two dyes are summarized in Table 1.

Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in a 0.1 M dichloromethane solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate with ferrocene as the internal standard at 0.63 V vs. NHE. As shown in Fig. 3, the first oxidation potentials (E+/0) of PQ-1 and PQ-2 were observed to be 0.93 and 0.95 V vs. NHE, respectively, which are assigned to the oxidation of the triphenylamine unit. Both the potential values are substantially more positive than the iodide/triiodide couple redox (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the ground-state sensitizer regeneration is energetically favourable for DSCs.9a The optical transition energies (E0–0) were 1.84 eV for PQ-1 and 1.48 eV for PQ-2, estimated by using the onset of the UV-vis spectra in dichloromethane. The excited-state redox potential, E+/*, determined by subtracting E0–0 from E+/0, were −0.91 V for PQ-1 and −0.53 V for PQ-2. The value of −0.91 V for PQ-1 is negative enough to allow their excited-state electron transfer into the TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE),10a while the high value of −0.53 V for PQ-2 may imply a deficient driving force for the electron transfer.

Density functional theory calculations
In order to get insight into the geometrical configuration and electron distribution of the frontier orbitals of the two dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were made on a B3LYP/6-31G level. Their optimized ground state molecular structures and the corresponding dihedral angles were presented in the ESI.† In the structure of PQ-1, the dihedral angles of pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline with the two neighbouring phenyl rings are 46.8° and 49.9°, while in the case of PQ-2, the dihedral angles of pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline with the two adjacent thienyl rings are 15.3° and 15.4°. It is clear that PQ-2 is much more planar in a molecular configuration than PQ-1. Naturally more planar PQ-2 favors a broad electron density distribution of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals compared to PQ-1, as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the significantly red-shifted spectrum of PQ-2 observed in Fig. 2 could result from its high planar characteristic that would cause an efficient charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor. On the other hand, the dye molecules with a planar configuration may deteriorate the device performances due to their potential aggregation on the TiO2 surface.

Solar cell performance
The photovoltaic performance of PQ-1 and PQ-2 dyes as sensitizers for DSCs was tested with liquid electrolytes. Double-layer TiO2 films were employed for dye adsorption. In the case of no CDCA co-adsorbant in dye solutions, the PQ-1 based device gave a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.25 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 733 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.64, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.81%, while the PQ-2 based device gave a Jsc of 1.12 mA cm−2, a Voc of 422 mV, a FF of 0.41, and a η of 0.19%. With the addition of the CDCA co-adsorbant in the dye solutions, the performance of the PQ-1 based device improved significantly. At the optimized condition of 20 mM CDCA, the PQ-1 based device gave a Jsc of 13.13 mA cm−2, a Voc of 768 mV, a FF of 0.68 with a η of 6.86%, while the PQ-2 based device gave a Jsc of 1.86 mA cm−2, a Voc of 432 mV, a FF of 0.43, and a η of 0.34%, as shown in Fig. 5a. The dye amounts on TiO2 films were comparable for PQ-1 (1.50 × 10−7 mol cm−2) and PQ-2 (1.71 × 10−7 mol cm−2) in the devices. The results indicate that PQ-1 and PQ-2 dyes with the lateral bulky alkoxy-substituted phenyl units are still inclined to aggregate on TiO2 films, and the CDCA co-adsorbant can effectively reduce the tendency. Both the device efficiencies were found to decrease with further increasing CDCA content, mainly due to the decrease of the photocurrent. Under the same conditions without CDCA, the N719-based DSC gave a Jsc of 18.22 mA cm−2, a Voc of 728 mV, a FF of 0.69 and a η of 9.15%. Considering the low LUMO levels of PQ-2 (−0.53 V), we tried to increase the content of LiI (0.3 M) in the electrolytes with no 4-tert-butylpyridine in order to shift the TiO2 conduction band downward for efficient charge transfer, but there is no considerable improvement in the performance (Jsc, Voc, FF and η are 2.24 mA cm−2, 428 mV, 0.48, 0.46%, respectively). The poor efficiency for PQ-2 comes from all the poor parameters (Jsc, Voc and FF), and may be explained by the low driving force between its excited-state redox potential and the TiO2 conduction band as mentioned above. In addition, the high planar configuration of PQ-2 may cause the dye strong aggregation on the TiO2 surface and thus deteriorate the device performances.16 The results indicate that the energy level alignment is important in the design of the low-band dye in the DSC system.17,18 The further molecular modification of the indigo-based dyes is under progress.

Fig. 5b shows an action spectrum (IPCE), which is consistent with the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 2. The PQ-1 based device clearly exhibited a stronger and broader response in the entire visible spectral region.
For further elucidating the large difference in performance for PQ-1 and PQ-2, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the FTO/TiO2/dye interfaces. The Nyquist plots of DSCs were recorded in the dark with a forward bias of 0.70 V, as shown in Fig. 6. Two semicircles from left to right in the Nyquist plot were assigned to the resistances of charge transfer (RPt) on the Pt counter electrode and charge recombination (Rr) at the interface of the TiO2–electrolyte. It is clear that the semicircle for Rr is much larger in PQ-2 than that in PQ-1, which may indicate inefficient charge transfer at the TiO2/PQ-2 dye interface due to the low driving force for electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2 as mentioned above.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two new pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline-based dyes, PQ-1 and PQ-2, have been designed, prepared and employed as sensitizers in DSCs. Our results demonstrated that the pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline unit is a promising π-linker for the construction of low band gap sensitizers in DSCs. In the DSCs, PQ-1 gave a power conversion efficiency of 6.86%, while more planar PQ-2 gave only 0.34% under the same conditions. This work may provide a valuable, basic guideline for rational design of D–π–A molecules for high performance DSCs.
