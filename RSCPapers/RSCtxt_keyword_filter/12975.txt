    , Accepted 11th December 2011First published on 8th February 2012AbstractHollow mesoporous one dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanofibers are successfully prepared by co-axial electrospinning of a titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) solution with two immiscible polymers; polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) using a core–shell spinneret, followed by annealing at 450 °C. The annealed mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers are found to having a hollow structure with an average diameter of 130 nm. Measurements using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method reveal that hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers possess a high surface area of 118 m2 g−1 with two types of mesopores; 3.2 nm and 5.4 nm that resulted from gaseous removal of PEO and PVP respectively during annealing. With hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers as the photoelectrode in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC), the solar-to-current conversion efficiency (η) and short circuit current (Jsc) are measured as 5.6% and 10.38 mA cm−2 respectively, which are higher than those of DSSC made using regular TiO2 nanofibers under identical conditions (η = 4.2%, Jsc = 8.99 mA cm−2). The improvement in the conversion efficiency is mainly attributed to the higher surface area and mesoporous TiO2 nanostructure. It facilitates the adsorption of more dye molecules and also promotes the incident photon to electron conversion. Hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers with close packing of grains and crystals intergrown with each other demonstrate faster electron diffusion, and longer electron recombination time than regular TiO2 nanofibers as well as P25 nanoparticles. The surface effect of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers as a photocatalyst for the degradation of rhodamine dye was also investigated. The kinetic study shows that the hollow mesoporous surface of the TiO2 nanofibers influenced its interactions with the dye, and resulted in an increased catalytic activity over P25 TiO2 nanocatalysts.
Introduction
Electrospinning has been popular in producing one dimensional (1D) metal oxides fibers or polymer fibers for energy based applications, including as electrode in photovoltaics, fuel cells, energy storage devices and as photocatalysts.1–3 High molecular weight polymers as structure directing agents, were blended with metal oxide precursors and drawn into composite fibers through a spinneret by applying a high voltage. Besides their use in energy applications, electrospun fibers can be also be used in other areas including wetting of materials, etc. Besenbacher et al. produced light responsive biodegradable polycaprolactone nanofibers by functionalizing their surface with photoresposive azobenzene and showed reversible light-driven wettability changes.4
Nanofibers may be preferred over nanoparticles in energy applications for the following reasons: faster electron diffusion than in nanoparticles; fibers of diameter less than 150 nm provide an additional energetic barrier to recombination due to the formation of a space–charge region; 1D nanofibers ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated by the reducing surface.
A standard dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consists of a TiO2 nanoparticulate film as photoelectrode on transparent conducting oxide glass (fluorine doped tin oxide, FTO), a photosensitizer (dye), a platinum-coated FTO as counter electrode and an iodide/triiodide redox couple electrolyte.5–8 Upon illumination, the sensitized dye injects electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2, which transports through the nanoparticulate matrix to FTO.9 The electron-deficient dye is subsequently regenerated by the redox electrolyte. The performance of DSSCs was more closely related to the surface area of TiO2 films.10 More dye molecules could be anchored efficiently if the metal oxide is provided with a larger surface area, leading to stronger absorption of solar irradiation from the adsorbed dye.11 There also has been a strong motivation to increase the active surface area of TiO2 and also to produce novel morphologies because of its excellent catalytic activity. TiO2 as photocatalyst has many advantages including its UV absorption range, excellent chemical stability and is relatively abundant availability.
Much research activity has been directed to develop the methodologies that produce metal oxide nanostructures with higher surface area as this facilitates the adsorption of more dye molecules in photovoltaics and a greater catalytic activity. Methods such as electrodeposition, hydrothermal, potentiostatic anodization, chemical and bio-based templates were employed to obtain higher surface area. Meng et al.12 and Grimes et al.13,14 prepared hollow hemispherical nano-TiO2 and TiO2 nanotube arrays respectively using a radio frequency (RF) sputtering method.
There are a few drawbacks associated with the synthesis of TiO2 nanotube arrays directly on FTO for energy applications. For example, loose packing of TiO2 nanotubes on FTO is common using a synthetic method that results in recombination loss, reducing the conversion efficiency in solar cells. For the improvement of adhesion of TiO2 nanotubes onto FTO, a thin layer of the TiO2 nanoparticle film has been employed that could however render more free-contact space and increase the Ohmic loss and the dark current in solar cells.
Using electrospinning, well-defined hollow structured materials were achieved either by using polymers as additive or volatile solvents or soluble oils as additives, or process temperature.15 Xia et al.16 demonstrated the formation of hollow TiO2 nanowires using polystyrene (PS) in the electrospinning blend. However, no data about the surface area and also no specific applications were reported by these authors. Another group led by Kim17,18 produced fine TiO2 nanorods with higher surface area of 138 m2 g−1 by electrospinning the blend with their lab-synthesized polymer PVAc (polyvinyl acetate, MW = 106). Nanorod morphology is relatively inferior for energy applications because of the number of contact points between the rods is much greater, hence electron trapping is expected to be significant in nanorods.19
The formation of a porous structure enhances the interfacial surface area, which is beneficial for energy devices. For instance, a larger interfacial area between TiO2 and the dye in solar cells leads to a high visible-light absorbance from the numerous successive monolayers of adsorbed dye, and also improves the accessibility of the electrolyte to electrode.
Lofton et al.20 produced porous TiO2 fibers by electrospinning the sol gel precursor with sodium chloride/calcium carbonate, and subsequent removal of salt through leaching. This approach however also led to the formation of micro-sized pores, which are undesirable for applications in solar cells. The electron transport would be affected within the porous structure of TiO2, in turn causing electron–hole recombination. The higher surface area of the porous TiO2 film with a smaller pore size (<5 nm) is critical for efficient device performance.
Considering the advantages of higher surface area and larger interfacial area of hollow and mesoporous structures respectively, an electrospinning method that is capable of generating both hollow and mesoporous structures within each fiber using cost-effective polymers has been developed. TiO2 fibrous mat that possesses both hollow and mesoporous structures in each fiber was produced using co-axial electrospinning of precursors with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in the core, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution alone in shell part of the spinneret, followed by annealing to 450 °C at ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. DSSCs were constructed using the as-prepared hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers as photoelectrode, and their performances were evaluated in comparison to regular and smooth TiO2 nanofibers. It was found that DSSCs based on hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers exhibited a significant increase of 33% in solar-to-current conversion efficiency over regular TiO2 fibers.
The as-obtained hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers mat was also investigated for its catalytic performance against the degradation of organic dye (rhodamine B) and compared with the P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The study revealed that the higher surface area resulting from the hollow mesoporous structure appears to be a promising morphology for TiO2 to be a more effective photocatalyst.
Experimental
a. Materials
Titanium tetraisopropoxide [Ti(OiPr)4; 97%], solvents N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), ethanol (100%) and acetic acid (99.7%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Singapore). All chemicals were used as received without further purification. cis-Di(thiocyanato)-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4-carboxylate-40-carboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) (N719) dye was purchased from Solaronix and used as a sensitizer to harvest the solar radiation. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
b. Core–shell electrospinning
Core–shell spinneret (Scheme 1) was set up with two needles of size of 27 G (core) and 21G (shell) fixed coaxially. Two precursor gels were chosen such that they were immiscible in nature, one for the core liquid and another for the shell liquid.
 Scheme 1  Set up for co-electrospinning and core–shell nanofibers and removal of organic polymers from core and shell layers. 
For this study, the precursor solution for the shell side was prepared by dissolving 0.9 g of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 100000, Aldrich) in 10 ml of ethanol followed by the addition of 3 ml acetic acid. Titanium tetraisopropoxide (1.5 g) was then added into PVP solution under vigorous stirring for 12 h. The precursor for core fluid was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of polyethylene oxide (PEO, Mw = 900000, Sigma-Aldrich) in 5 ml of DMF under heating at 50 °C. As-prepared two precursor gels were loaded into two plastic syringes (5 ml) and connected to a coaxial core–shell spinneret (Scheme 1). A high-voltage power was applied to the needle tip. The flow rate for core and shell fluids was set to 0.2 ml h−1 and 0.6 ml h−1 respectively. The electric field strength was 15 kV and an aluminum foil wrapped plate collector was placed at 12 cm below the needle tip for the collection of fibers.
A compound (core and shell) droplet formed at the edge of spinneret nozzles and transformed into a Taylor cone21 with a compound jet co-electrospun from its tip. The core–shell electrospun fibers were produced as in the simple electrospinning, the jet was pulled by the electric field, and stretched by the bending instability. The solvents from core and shell solution were evaporated rapidly due to set-humidity of 50% and concentrated core and shell solutions in the traveling path. The compound Taylor cone was subsequently formed with a shell droplet surrounded core solution droplet at the core–shell spinneret tip. PEO and PVP-TiO2 were obtained as core and shell nanofibers respectively (Scheme 1).
The electrospun core–shell nanofibers were calcined at 450 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to remove polymers, obtained hollow mesoporous nanofibers.
For performance comparison with regular TiO2 nanofibers, the precursor gel consisting of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (1.5 g), 0.9 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 100000, Aldrich), 10 ml ethanol and 3 ml acetic acid was loaded into a plastic syringe and a 15 kV DC voltage was applied to the single nozzle spinneret. The flow rate was set to 1 ml h−1. The collector was grounded and placed at a distance of 10 cm below the spinneret.
c. Characterizations
The morphology of the samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL-6701F, Japan) operated at voltage of 10 kV after platinum coating (20 mA, 30 s). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is attached with the SEM machine. The average diameter of the TiO2 nanofibers was measured using the software. Further examination of the calcined TiO2 nanofibers was done using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010, Japan) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) operating at 200 kV. The samples were prepared with an ultrasonic bath to disperse the TiO2 nanofibers in ethanol followed by dropping of the suspension on a carbon-coated copper grid. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was measured with Cu-Kα X-ray radiation at λ = 1.54056 Å with diffract grams recorded for 2θ between 10° and 70°. The surface area and pore volume were determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET, Micromeretics Tristar 2000, surface area and pore size analyzer). The samples were degassed under inert nitrogen (N2) at 300 °C for 12 h prior to BET measurements (under standard protocols at 77 K). UV-Vis spectra were measured using Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with a spectral resolution of 1 nm.
d. Photoelectric measurements
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with DI water, acetone, and α-propanol. The paste was made by adding 3.75 g hollow mesoporous nanofibers and 18.7 g ethyl cellulose (Aldrich) into 15.2 g α-terpineol (Aldrich). The paste was then sonicated for 2 h until a homogenous suspension without aggregate was obtained. After that, the TiO2 paste was bladed on a FTO glass to a thickness of 12 ± 2 μm using a doctor-blading technique. The TiO2 electrode was dried in air at 90 °C for 30 min and calcined at 450 °C for 1 h to completely remove ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol. Anchoring of the dye molecules on the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers electrode surface was done by soaking the electrode in a 1:1 volume mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol of N719 dye (0.5 mM) for 24 h at room temperature. The TiO2 photoelectrode was then washed with DI water to remove unanchored dye molecules and dried in desiccator. A 50 μm space was covered the TiO2 electrode. A DSSC was assembled by sandwiching TiO2 photo anode, counter electrode and filling with electrolyte solution which containing 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-imethylimidazoliumiodide (acetonitrile as solvent).
The performance of the DSSC was obtained by photocurrent measurements of the assembled DSSC under irradiation of a 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp (Thermo Oriel Xenon Lamp 150 W: Model 66902) with AM 1.5 G, 1 sun condition. I–V curve was obtained via a potentiosat (Autolab PGSTAT30, Eco Chemie B.V, and The Netherlands). The amount of chemisorbed dye was performed by measuring the concentration of dye which was desorbed into a equal volume (20 mL) of diluted NaOH solution (0.1M). The relative difference of absorbance is translated to the relative difference of dye loading of TiO2 electrode. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by using a monochromator and a 300 W Xenon lamp with a spectral resolution of 5 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using AutoLab PSTAT30 with a frequency range of 0.05 Hz–30 kHz in the dark. The amplitude of the ac signal was set at 10 mV.
e. Photocatalytic measurements
Rhodamine B was chosen as a model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the samples. 0.05 g of the TiO2 sample was added to a 50 mL rhodamine B solution with a concentration of 20 mg L−1 in a quartz photoreactor. The mixed solution was stirred for 30 min in the dark to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The reaction solution was then irradiated with visible light using a 200 W lamp. A glass filter was used as a cutoff for the short-wavelength components of light. A water-cooling system was used to maintain the reaction solution at room temperature. The mixture solution was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore membrane filter to filter out the catalyst. The concentration of rhodamine B was then measured by a UV-vis spectrophotometer with an acceptable error of ±3%. The absorbance peak of rhodamine B was at 552 nm.
Results and discussion
a. Morphology characterization
The morphology of the TiO2 nanofibers obtained by coaxial electrospinning using PEO as core and PVP mixed with titanium tetraisopropoxide as shell material were investigated. As-spun core–shell (PEO/TiO2-PVP) composite nanofibers were found to be continuous as shown in Fig. 1(a). The inset is the as-spun core–shell (PEO/TiO2-PVP) composite nanofibers deposited on aluminum foil. The fiber diameter varied between approximately 40 nm and 190 nm. A high magnified SEM image the core–shell (PEO/TiO2-PVP) composite nanofibers are shown in Fig. 1(b). The surface of the composite nanofibers is relatively smooth. Fig. 1(c) illustrates the TEM image of these composite nanofibers. There is a thin layer of TiO2-PVP composite shell uniformly covering the entire length of the core nanofibers (PEO). However, the shell layer is slightly unsymmetrical.

Upon sintering at 450 °C in the air for 1 h, the core–shell (PEO/TiO2-PVP) nanofibers were converted to hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers. Fig. 1(e) shows the SEM micrographs of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers. The average diameter of synthesized hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers was measured to be 130 ± 80 nm. PEO, which was used as the core material, was found to be decomposed and removed during sintering, yielding the hollow structure in the core. Meanwhile, the PVP phase present in the shell layer was also found to be decomposed during sintering and produced ceramic TiO2 with uniform mesopores in the shell structure. SEM Fig. 1(f) and (g) confirmed the formation of hollow nanostructures in the core and also a mesoporous surface in the shell. The wall thickness of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers was measured to be 28 ± 18 nm with a slight asymmetry. The cross-sectional view of the elliptical tubular tip is illustrated in Fig. 1(h). As shown in Fig. 1(d), only Ti and O peaks are seen in the EDX spectrum and the molar ratio of Ti to O is around 1:2, which agrees well with the stoichiometric ratio of TiO2. The inset is an optical image of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers after sintering.
The microstructure of the hollow mesoporous TiO2 fibers after sintering was further examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1(i) shows the typical microstructure of a bundle of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers. A single hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofiber is illustrated in Fig. 1(j). The tubular shape and the pores on the surface of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers were clearly observed. The corresponding crystalline diffraction rings of (101), (004), (200), (105) and (204) in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 1(k)) confirm that an anatase phase of TiO2 nanofibers was formed. This also demonstrates that the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers were polycrystalline.
As shown in Fig. 1(l), the high resolution TEM image revealed that the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers possessed a well-crystallized structure and lattice fringes having an interplanar spacing of 0.352 nm, corresponding to TiO2 anatase (101) plane.
The crystal structure of the hollow mesoporous TiO2 fibers were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 2). All diffraction peaks at 25.3° (101), 37.8° (004), 48.2° (200) and 54.1° (105) were assigned to the pure anatase phase and there were no crystalline products. The peaks were rather sharp and in excellent agreement with the results from SAED analysis, indicating that the fibers were highly crystalline. There were no additional peaks observed in the XRD spectrum indicating no detectable impurities. The average grain size of the annealed hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers from the corresponding XRD peaks were determined by the Scherrer equation:22 D = Kλ/(βcosθ)(1)where D is the crystallite size, K is a shape factor and taken as 0.94 for a small cubic crystal of uniform size, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the full width at half the maximum intensity (FWHM) in radians and θ is the Bragg angle. The average crystallite size was calculated to be 9.6 nm.

The morphology of regular TiO2 nanofibers was first investigated using SEM. Regular TiO2 nanofiber mats obtained after annealing at 450 °C in the air for 1 h were found to be continuous (Fig. 3(a),(b)). The average diameter of synthesized regular TiO2 nanofibers was measured to be 100 ± 63 nm. High crystallinity was observed on the surface of regular TiO2 in Fig. 3(c),(d).

b. Texture properties

Fig. 4(a) shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and regular TiO2 nanofibers. All the fibers exhibit the type IV isotherm curves with a well-defined characteristic condensation step at P/Po ∼ 0.3–0.5. It clearly indicates that TiO2 possesses a mesoporous structure.23,24 The point of inflection of P/Po ∼ 0.4 (hollow mesoporous nanofibers) is characteristic of capillary condensation within the uniform mesopores.
 Fig. 4  (a) N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm of regular TiO2 nanofibers and hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers. (b) Pore size distribution (inset) of regular TiO2 nanofibers and hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers. 
The intersection point in the N2 adsorption and desorption curves of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers demonstrate that there were mainly two sizes of pores on the surface. The two types of mesopores; 3.2 nm and 5.4 nm in hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers were observed in the pore size distribution curve (Fig. 4(b)). This effect is ascribed to the evaporation of two polymers; PEO and PVP that were removed during sintering from the core and shell components of the nanofibers respectively.
These polymers have a different thermal degradation temperature and different size and shape. The evaporation of the polymers from the solution will leave void space/pores inside the structure. The pore size distribution was calculated based on Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. A narrow pore-size distribution with a pore diameter of 5.8 nm was observed for regular TiO2 nanofibers. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, average pore diameter and total pore volume are summarized in Table 1. BET study revealed that the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers had a surface area of 118 m2 g−1, which is about 2 times higher than that of regular TiO2 nanofibers (59 m2 g−1). The average pore diameter further confirmed the mesoporous structure of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers. The total pore volumes of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and regular TiO2 nanofibers were found to be 0.281 and 0.168 cm3 g−1 respectively, indicating the hollow mesoporous structure improves the porosity of one dimensional nanofibers.

The surface area of the commercial P25 (Degussa AG, Frankfurt, Germany) was measured to be 53 m2 g−1 and the comparison of P25 and hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers on the electrochemical properties and photocatalytic activities were also discussed in this report.
c. Photovoltaic performance
Photovoltaic properties of as-prepared TiO2 architectures were evaluated by constructing DSSCs and the overall light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency was evaluated using the equation η = FF·Jsc·Voc/Pin, where FF is the fill factor, Jsc is the short circuit current density, Voc is the open circuit voltage, and Pin is the incident light power density. Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs based on the hollow mesoporous and regular TiO2 nanofibers.

Fig. 6 compares the absorption spectrum of the N719 dye anchored on the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and regular TiO2 nanofibers. It shows that hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers with a high surface area (118 m2 g−1) absorbed more dye than regular TiO2 nanofibers (59 m2 g−1). The amount of chemisorbed ruthenium dye (N719) was determined by the Beer law, A = εCL(2)where A is the light absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, L is the distance the light travels through the material and C is the concentration of absorbing dye molecules.
 Fig. 6  UV-vis absorption spectra of the absorbed dye molecules (N719 dye) on TiO2 hollow mesoporous nanofibers and TiO2 regular nanofibers based devices. 
The dye loading of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and regular TiO2 nanofibers electrodes were calculated to be 3.86 and 1.68 × 10−6 mol cm−2, respectively. This result revealed that the absorption intensity of dye molecules on the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers electrode is 2 times more than that of regular TiO2 nanofibers electrode of same thickness, indicating the enhancement of incident light absorption.
The calculated solar cell parameters were given in Table 2. The short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the DSSC using the hollow mesoporous fibers were found to be 10.38 mA cm−2, 0.758 V and 0.72 respectively.For regular TiO2 nanofibers based DSSC, Jsc of 8.99 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.738 and FF of 0.64, and power conversion efficiency of 4.17 ± 0.08% were obtained.

The reduced current density obtained with regular TiO2 nanofibers was due to insufficient light harvesting by TiO2 films. The lower surface area of regular TiO2 nanofibers limited the anchoring of more dye molecules on the surface of TiO2 films, thus leading to poor optical absorbance. The conversion efficiency of DSSC using hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers was about 1.4 times higher than that of DSSC using regular TiO2 nanofibers. The improved energy conversion efficiency was mainly from the increase in Jsc compared to that for regular nanofiber based DSSCs, indicating that the hollow mesoporous structure facilitates the electron injection density with a large interface between dye molecules and nanofibers.
The higher surface area is related to the larger amount of adsorbed dyes. Voc is related to the energy gap between Fermi level of the semiconductor and the Nernst potential of the redox couple.25 It is influenced by the electron affinity of the semiconductor, the ionization potential of the dye and the dark current. Raising the conduction band of the semiconductor could reduce the recombination loss, which results in a higher open circuit voltage.26 The Voc was found to be improved for the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofiber based DSSC, attributable to better penetration of the electrolyte into the TiO2 electrode, which suppressed back electron transfer and enhanced the redox process between the dye molecules and the electrolyte. The presence of a mesoporous structure promotes better contact with the electrolyte and more adsorption of the dye in the hollow nanofibers. The retardation of surface recombination between the conduction band electrons and I3− species in the Nernst potential of the electrolyte in hollow mesoporous nanofibers should be able to offset the adverse shift of the band edge toward a positive potential and produce a net Voc gain of about 20 mV. In the literature, TiO2 nanorod/nanofiber based DSSCs were reported to have an efficiency, η, up to 7.2%, which was however achieved using the C101 dye.27 The C101 dye possesses a heteroleptic polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complex structure, is characterized by a high molecular extinction coefficient that facilitates a conversion efficiency of 7.2%. Efforts aimed at decreasing the diameter of the nanofibers and thus increasing the roughness factor of the fibrous photoelectrode are currently pursued by us.
Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of devices fabricated by hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and regular TiO2 nanofibers are shown in Fig. 7. The IPCE value was determined by IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)φinjηc,28 where LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency for photons of the wavelength λ, φinj is the quantum yield for electron injection and ηc is the electron collection efficiency. The maximum IPCE was increased from 58.6% to 67% at 520 nm by hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofiber based cells. The improvement of ∼15% suggests that the devices based on hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers have more electron injection and better electron transportation behaviour than that of regular TiO2 nanofibers. Although the electron transport efficiency obtained with the single-crystal electrode is theoretically higher than that obtained from the polycrystalline form due to the lack of domain boundaries and defects in the single crystal, Gratzel et al. demonstrated that the IPCE value obtained with the single-crystal TiO2 anatase electrode was much smaller than that of the polycrystalline TiO2 anatase electrode. This dramatic improvement is mainly due to the better light harvesting due its dye-sensitized polycrystalline nature.7 A. J. Frank et al. further proved that the anatase film was 25% and 14% higher than the rutile film in the overall energy conversion efficiencies and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency respectively, which is mainly due to differences in their surface area (i.e. the amount of dye adsorbed).29 The 1-D hollow dimensional anatase film, having a high surface area synthesized by the electron-spinning method could be one possible solution to high efficiency electron conduction in DSSCs.

d. Electronic transport analysis
To investigate the transport characteristic of an injected electron in the hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofiber film and the electron recombination between the quasi Fermi level and the redox potential, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. Fig. 8 shows a general transmission line model which was developed by Bisquert et al.30 Various interfaces in DSSC were modeled by a parallel RC circuit. The resistance element models charge exchange and the constant phase element (CPE) denotes charge accumulation at double layer interface. The I3− redox process in electrolyte was modeled by a finite Warburg element. By fitting the impedance spectra, the electron recombination lifetime (τn) and collection lifetime (τd) were calculated using the correlation τn= (RctQk)1/β and τd = (RtQk)1/β,where β is the CPE exponent. The effective electron diffusion coefficient was measured as follows; Deff = L2/τd.
 Fig. 8  Transmission line model of DSSC. RFTO/TiO2, RFTO/electrolyte and Relectrolyte/Pt are the charge transfer resistance at the FTO–TiO2, FTO–electrolyte and electrolyte–Pt interfaces respectively; CPE FTO/TiO2, CPEFTO/electrolyte and CPEelectrolyte/Pt are the double layer capacitance between FTO–TiO2, FTO–electrolyte and electrolyte–Pt contacts respectively; rt is the transport resistance of TiO2 film, rct and qk are the electron transfer resistance chemical capacitance contributed by the electronic states and the space charge of the electron recombination process between the TiO2 film and the I3− electrolyte; Rs is the series resistance including the sheet resistance of FTO glass and the contact resistance of the cell. 

Fig. 9(a) and (b) illustrate electron diffusion coefficient (Deff) and recombination lifetime (τn) in the transmission line model, compared to the data of regular TiO2 nanofiber based DSSCs from our previous research work31 and P25 TiO2 nanoparticles based DSSC (Jsc = 10.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.748 V, FF = 0.65, η = 5.02 ± 0.1). The fitting results of the electron transport resistance Rt, electron recombination resistance Rct and chemical capacitance Qk are shown in the supporting information.† The electron effective diffusion coefficient of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofiber, P25 nanoparticle and regular TiO2 nanofiber based DSSCs showed a decrease in the following order; hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers > P25 nanoparticles > regular TiO2 nanofibers. This suggests that one dimensional (1D) hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers with a close packing of grains and crystals intergrown with each other have better directivity. The higher surface area of the hollow mesoporous morphology allowed for anchoring of more dye molecules and better electrolyte penetration which resulted in faster electron diffusion and shortened the electron collection time. In the electron recombination between the Fermi level and Nernst potential, the electron recombination resistance of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers based DSSCs were found to be higher than that of P25 nanoparticles, and also regular TiO2 nanofiber based DSSCs. The chemical capacitance of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers was slightly lower than that of P25 nanoparticles, which reveals the relatively lower charge accumulated in the space charge region of the 1D nanostructure. The electron recombination life time was found to be decreased in the following order; hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers > P25 nanoparticles > regular TiO2 nanofibers, indicating electron recombination rate is slower in hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers.

The higher surface area of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers increases the effective contact points between TiO2 grains and triiodide in the electrolyte. The higher surface area of the nanofibers showed a positive electron trapping and de-trapping effect on the surface of nanofibers and suppressed the electron back reaction. Grätzel et al. demonstrated that the trapping of carriers was reduced in TiO2 fibers and the electron transfer rate to the dye oxidized state was higher than that of the TiO2 nanoparticles. This accelerating effect is attributed to the particular morphology of pores surrounding the oxide fibers. Triiodide ions in the electrolyte have the possibility to escape faster and further and to diffuse more freely to the counter electrode in the one dimensional (1D) nanofiber mat.27 Although a high surface area gives rise to defect states in the bandgap that perform as trap centers for the free carriers, this slow-down effect was overcome by the large promotional effect of the 1D nanofiber structure.
e. Photocatalytic activities
The photocatalytic performance of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers was evaluated by carrying out a degradation study on the Rhodamine B dye. Commercial P-25 (Degussa AG, Frankfurt, Germany) was also adopted for comparison.
The photodegradation profiles (concentration change) of Rhodamine B in the presence of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and P25 TiO2 NPs under visible light irradiation are shown in Fig. 10(a). Rhodamine B was clearly seen to be stable in the absence of catalysts. The decomposition rate (C/C0) of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers was observed to be higher than that of P25.
 Fig. 10  Photocatalytic degradation profile of rhodamine B (a) and kinetic linear simulation curve (b) over hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and P-25. 
Using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, the degradation profile of Fig. 10(a) was converted to a kinetic plot. Fig. 10(b) shows that the kinetic plots of hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and P25 followed approximately first order. The apparent rate constant kapp was determined by ln(C0/C) = kappt32(3)
The value of kapp was calculated to be 0.061 min−1 for hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers and 0.039 min−1 for P25. The enhanced photodegradation activity is attributed to factors including surface area, grain size, crystalline and morphology.33–37 As the catalytic activity takes place on the surface of the photocatalyst in general, a major contributing factor is the higher surface area (118 m2 g−1) of hollow porous TiO2 fibers than that of P25 (53 m2 g−1). Another possible factor can be ascribed to the grain size (9.6 nm) of hollow mesoporous nanofibers, which is significantly smaller than that of P25 (20.3 nm). These factors might act as a charge separation center for enhancing photoexcited electron–hole separation.
Conclusions
Electrospinning has so far been used for producing anatase 1D TiO2 in either the hollow form or mesoporous structure. Herein we demonstrated for the first time that the individual anatase TiO2 fiber was produced with both hollow and mesoporous structures by selecting suitable polymers and optimising the polymer/precursor ratio and post-process conditions. Annealing of the core–shell nanofibers prepared using PEO/TiO2-PVP at 450 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 yielded a hollow mesoporous structure in TiO2 nanofibers. The method presented in this study is undoubtedly a cost-effective approach in making high surface area TiO2 nanofibers by electrospinning, and also a potential alternative to the currently available methods like hydrothermal synthesis, conventional electrospinning and template assisted fabrication. In comparison to the regular TiO2 nanofiber based DSSCs, the enhancement of power conversion efficiency was observed in hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanostructured fibers due to greater dye loading and faster electron transport. The characteristics of transient photocurrent/photovoltage measurements on hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers are under further investigation. Hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers should offer obvious advantages that will inspire new developments in the design of high efficient heterojunction structures in DSSC and hybrid solar cell applications. The hollow mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers also showed a higher catalytic activity than that of TiO2 nanoparticles, which is attributable to its higher surface area that enabled strong interactions between the TiO2 and dye. Studies of the catalytic mechanism of TiO2 nanofibers on the various organic pollutants and relation between materials morphology and surface structure versus organic molecular structures are currently under investigation.
