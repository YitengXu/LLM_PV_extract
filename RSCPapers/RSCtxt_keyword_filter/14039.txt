    , Accepted 14th February 2022First published on 18th February 2022AbstractA highly efficient luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) composed of a nanosized metal-cluster as a molecular luminophore copolymerized with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was fabricated through a simple solution process. Organic–inorganic salts such as (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] and (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] (where dMDAEMA is 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl dimethyldodecylammonium) were copolymerized with PMMA to generate a highly effective, transparent, and robust LSC waveguide. This hybrid luminophore enabled the development of a highly efficient UV-vis sunlight harvesting device due to strong absorption at UV-vis wavelengths up to ∼500 nm and a large downshift of luminescence at near-infrared wavelengths (∼850 nm). Si photovoltaic cells were placed at the edge of the LSC waveguide plate to collect the concentrated luminescence by internal reflection. LSCs fabricated with a 2.0 × 2.0 × 0.3 mm3 size had the highest observed power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.24% and a transparency of ∼85%, which were much higher than those of LSCs made from other luminophores with the same Si photovoltaic cell. Our LSC with chemical/physical durability, robustness, and solution processability for any desirable plate size and thickness suggests a practical future direction for smart windows of urban buildings where traditional Si photovoltaic cells cannot be directly employed.
Introduction
In recent years, the demand for solar energy harvesting technologies has continuously increased. For example, Si photovoltaic cells have achieved tremendous progress in terms of capacity and energy price. However, the use of conventional Si-based photovoltaic (PV) devices in urban areas is mostly limited to roof-top installations for application in building integrated PVs (BIPVs). The additional disadvantages of traditional Si PVs for building integration include a lack of transparency, the heavy weight of modules, and limited coloration choices (usually black or dark blue), such that aesthetic appeal is limited. Among solar harvesting systems for BIPV applications, luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) devices can offer remarkable advantages such as aesthetic compatibility, structural flexibility, light weight, and transparency. Since the LSC technique first appeared in the 1970s as a device to economically harvest solar energy, the concept of LSCs has re-emerged as a complementary route to conventional Si PV solar panels.1,2 LSCs consist of waveguide coated or doped with luminescent dyes within transparent and highly refractive plastic slabs, and PV cells are placed at the edges of the slabs. The luminescent dyes extensively absorb sunlight and emit light at a longer wavelength range for efficient collection by PV cells, where the concentrated photoluminescent light by total internal reflection is converted into electricity. Despite many researchers having proposed various luminescent dyes for LSCs, the widespread use of LSCs is limited by the lack of suitable emitters. For example, state-of-the-art highly efficient organic dyes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) have constraints on their use in architecture because of their strong coloring and instability under UV light. Likewise, inorganic quantum dots have limitations to practical applications due to their complexities in size and composition control for optimal emitting wavelengths to cover the solar spectrum and difficulties to disperse them within a polymer LSC matrix.
In this study, we synthesized a new polymer–metal cluster hybrid based on a highly emissive nano-sized hexamolybdenum cluster and fabricated robust LSCs with high power efficiencies and high transparencies to visible light. LSCs incorporated with the nano-sized inorganic metal clusters are stable under UV light and transparent enough to be used as windows with acceptable color rendering. Inorganic cluster anionic dyes can be uniformly encapsulated within a copolymerized cationic matrix by electrostatic interactions; therefore, the optical losses such as non-radiative energy loss by interaction between clusters and scattering loss due to aggregated nanoparticles could be minimized.
For high-performance LSCs, we adopted a nano-sized hexanuclear halide cluster [Mo6I14]2− as an inorganic dye, which has strong absorption within the UV-vis range and broad emission with a large downshift toward the red and near-infrared (NIR) regions and is well-suited for harvesting solar radiation. Hexanuclear metal cluster complexes with the general formula [M6X8L6]n− (where M = Mo, W or Re; X = a halide inner ligand; and L = an inorganic or organic apical ligand) are well-defined, nanosized cluster units, where six metal atoms formed an octahedron with eight strongly bonded face-capped inner ligands and six relatively weakly bonded apical ligands connected to each vertex of the octahedron.3–9 Previously, such cluster complexes in the form of molecular emitters were applied to LSCs with dimensions of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 0.1 cm, which were the same dimensions of our LSCs, and their maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) was reported to be relatively low, about 0.44%. In this study, the potassium or tetrabutylammonium salt of the chloride hexamolybdenum anionic cluster [Mo6Cl14]2− and polymers such as poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) and poly(butyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate) (PBMMA) were blended for the LSC waveguide.10 Here, we demonstrate a new strategy for LSCs with a high efficiency of 1.24% and a transparency of ∼85% and suggest their potential for its future practical application as large window sized (∼1 m × 1 m) LSCs.
Results and discussion
To fabricate highly efficient and transparent large-area LSC plates, the metal cluster dyes must be homogeneously dispersed within a polymer waveguide without aggregation. There are some examples of synthesis of metal cluster–polymer hybrids in which the apical organic ligand L in [M6X8L6]2− is covalently bonded to the host polymer matrix producing a homogeneous clear solid.11 However, in such hybrids, covalent bonding between the cluster and polymer matrix often negates the inherent photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of the metal cluster dye.12 To preserve the high emissivity of the LSC plate, we prepared a salt consisting of an inorganic cluster dianion with a polymerizable organic cation, and then co-polymerized this organic cation with methyl methacrylate (MMA) to form the solid inorganic cluster–polymer hybrid. The synthesis of this cluster–polymer hybrid is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The cesium cation in Cs2[Mo6I14] was exchanged with a polymerizable organic cation [2-(methacryloyloxy)-ethyl]-dimethyl-dodecylammonium (dMDAEMA+) to form a salt (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] via cationic metathesis. Because the organic cation, dMDAEMA+, possesses a methacrylate moiety at one end, it could be co-polymerized with MMA, and the long aliphatic chain (–C12H25) at the other end could increase its solubility in MMA used as a solvent. The maximum solubility of the salt in MMA was 15.20 mg mL−1. The final product obtained was a hybrid that consisted of hexanuclear metal cluster dyes uniformly copolymerized with PMMA, namely (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA, with excellent intrinsic optical properties for an ideal LSC plate. In the resulting hybrids, the dianionic metal cluster dyes were immobilized on the cationic sites of the polymer backbone, isolating each cluster within the PMMA matrix. The isolation of each metal cluster dye within the host polymer matrix was important to preserve the transparency and the intrinsic optical properties of the cluster cores because cluster–cluster interactions could cause reabsorption or non-radiative PL quenching. For comparison, an analogous hybrid with an incorporated [Mo6Cl14]2− cluster from MoCl2 and CsCl was prepared through a similar method as [Mo6I14]2−.33 However, (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] was also obtained by the reaction of Cs2[Mo6Cl14] with dMDAEMACl in acetone according to a procedure described in the literature.34

The cesium ions in the hexane clear metal cluster Cs2Mo6I14 are exchanged by polymerisable organic cations dMDAEMA+ and the organic cations are co-polymerized with MMA monomers used as a solvent such that the metal clusters dyes are copolymerized on polymer chain backbones without cluster–cluster contact in the PMMA matrix.

The terrestrial spectrum of solar radiation is shown (grey shading). The EQE curve of the Si photovoltaic cell used for LSCs is shown by the dashed black line. (c) The square shape of the LSC plates under illumination of daylight (top) and UV light (bottom), where the (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA (right) and (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14]–PMMA (left) hybrids were incorporated as dyes with a concentration of C = 1 mg mL−1. 
The absorption and emission spectra of the hexanuclear halide cluster salt (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] in acetonitrile and the (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA hybrid in the solid state fabricated as a LSC plate are essentially identical as seen in Fig. 1(b). They possess an absorption up to 550 nm with a peak maximum at 305 nm and emit light at a longer wavelength range between 600 and 900 nm with a peak maximum at 695 nm. The solution revealed a large ∼390 nm downshift in acetonitrile. At the same time, the hybrid solid yielded similar spectra with slightly red shifted absorption and PL spectrum. The square shaped LSC plates of (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA and (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14]–PMMA hybrids were shown under daylight and UV light illumination, where the incorporated dye concentration was 1 mg mL−1 and the thickness was 1 mm (Fig. 1(c)). They were transparent and nearly colorless under daylight. When irradiated with UV light, PL was strongly concentrated on the edges of the LSC plate.
The transmittance of (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] LSCs prepared at each concentration was also measured as shown in Fig. 2(a). All concentrations of LSCs showed a transmittance of up to 85% in the visible region. The color coordinates of the (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14]–PMMA LSCs and pure PMMA plates were within the central region of the chromaticity diagram, indicating excellent achromatic sensation. In comparison to the former, the color coordinates of the (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA plate were slightly shifted toward the yellow-orange region with the increasing concentrations as shown in Fig. 2(b). The color rendering index (CRI) is a quantitative measure of the colors compared to an ideal or natural light source.

(b) A CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram reporting the color coordinates of the film (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA LSCs at various concentrations and thicknesses. For comparison, the color coordinates of film (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14]–PMMA LSCs and the film of the pure PMMA were also calculated. The color coordinates (x and y) for each sample are listed in Table 1. 
The estimated CRI values ranged from 100% to 99% for the pure PMMA without the dye and for 1.0 mg mL−1 of [Mo6Cl14]2− contained solid hybrid. Almost no CRI change was observed upon increasing the concentration of [Mo6Cl14]2−, whereas increasing the concentration of [Mo6I14]2− from 0.25 mg mL−1 to 1.0 mg mL−1 led to a change in the CRI from 98% to 80%, respectively, with a 3 mm plate thickness (Table S1, ESI†). Since the ∼80% CRI value is the general baseline for acceptable color rendering for most indoor and commercial lighting applications, the [Mo6I14]2− cluster dye can be a promising LSC luminophore for BIPVs. For comparison of the optical properties of salts with a non-polymerizable cation or different halide ligands, (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14], (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14], (Bu4N)2[Mo6I14], and (Bu4N)2[Mo6Cl14] were prepared (Bu4N: tetrabutylammonium cation). Acetonitrile solutions of (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] and (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] yielded very high extinction coefficients of ∼105 and ∼104 M−1 cm−1 at 305 nm, respectively, which were comparable to those of typical photovoltaic materials such as GaAs and c-Si with values of ∼5 × 105 and 4.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†).13 Preliminary PCE measurements suggested that (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] was better than its chloride analogue (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] for LSC systems (Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†). The hybrid with (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] has a low absorbance in the visible region compared to that with (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]; therefore, (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] has an advantage of being colorless; however, (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] is better for highly efficient LSCs. Furthermore, the salts with the polymerizable cation dMDAEMA+ exhibited excellent solubility in MMA (15.2 mg mL−1), which was essential for fabrication of large-area LSC devices. On the other hand, the salts with Bu4N+ cations could be dispersed within the polymer matrix at very low concentrations below C = 0.01 mg mL−1. We prepared several concentrations of (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] in MMA (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg mL−1) and copolymerized them with various thicknesses of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 mm by pouring different volumes of solutions into the glass molds and solidifying. The solid plates were removed from the glass molds and cut to the desired sizes polished. The final plates were a very clear hard solid. The transmittance for each thickness of LSCs was also measured, and as the thickness of plates increased, the transmittance decreased as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
The PCE is the ratio of the electrical power output to the incident power and defined as PCE = JSC × VOC × FF/Pin, where JSC is the short-circuit density, VOC is the open-circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor and Pin is the incident power. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of 2.0 × 2.0 × 0.3 cm3 LSC systems with different concentrations of a cluster complex (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14], equipped with a four edge-mounted Si PV cell (2.0 × 0.3 cm2), are shown in Fig. 3(a) and the corresponding PCEs are summarized in Table 1. A maximum PCE of 1.24 ± 0.05% was observed at a dye concentration of 1 mg mL−1 (3 mm thickness) corresponding to a geometric gain value G = 1.67, where G is the ratio of the surface area of the top of the concentrator and the edge area of the attached solar cells. The JSC value was 3.79 ± 0.1 mA cm−2 with a VOC of 0.51 ± 0.01 V and a FF of 0.64 ± 0.01. The PCE was three times higher than the previously reported result of 0.44 ± 0.05% for a similar G = 6, where a similar dye (TBA)2[Mo6Cl14] was blended with polymers (PBMMA–PEMA) at C = 1 mg mL−1 and drop cast onto a glass substrate.10 The same anion cluster [Mo6Cl14]2− with a different cation (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] exhibited the highest PCE of 0.59 ± 0.05% (Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†). Therefore, it can be said that the performance of LSCs is mainly affected by the halide ligands bonded to the same inorganic hexametal cluster and cations. PCEs of different square sized LSCs with different G were the same as shown in Table 1, indicating the validity of measurements, i.e. larger square LSC plates 60 × 60 × 3 mm3 with G = 5 and 80 × 80 × 3 mm3 with G = 6.67 yielded similar PCEs of 1.23% and 1.24% as that of 20 × 20 × 3 mm3 PCE = 1.24% with G = 1.67. The PCE for the bare PMMA LSC prepared by the same method without a luminophore was very low at 0.07%, which indicated that the power conversions of the LSC systems mainly attributed to the dyes. The J–V curves of LSC devices with a dye concentration of 1 mg mL−1 for various thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3(b) and the detailed results are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The results of Fig. 3(a and b) indicated that the balance of the dye concentration and the LSC plate thickness considering self-absorption is important for maximizing the concentration of solar energy.

We carried out external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements to examine the validity and consistency of photocurrent densities extracted from J–V characteristics in PCE measurements. EQE measurements were performed for a one edge PV cell attached LSC using a home-built set-up that consisted of a solar simulator with a 1000 W xenon lamp and 23 bandpass interference filters covering the 300–950 nm region. The spectrally resolved EQE of the LSC system as a function of the wavelength is shown in Fig. 3(c). The integrated current density from the EQE spectra was 0.89 ± 0.05 mA cm−2, which corresponds to 3.58 mA cm−2 for a four edge PV cell attached LSC, showing 94.3% consistency compared with 3.79 mA cm−2 measured in the PCE for the four edge PV cell attached LSC as shown in Table 1.14
It is well known that the long-lived emission of octahedral molybdenum cluster complexes in solutions is quenched by oxygen, leading to the generation of singlet oxygen.15,16 However, such non-radiative quenching could be avoided when dye compounds are encapsulated within a polymer.17 The absolute PLQY of the (dMDAEMA)2Mo6I14–PMMA hybrid solid (thickness = 3 mm) was 0.816 ± 0.001 at an excitation wavelength (λex) of 330 nm, 0.33 ± 0.02 at λex of 345 nm, and 0.12 ± 0.02 at λex of 375 nm. The PLQY of the hybrid solid at λex of 375 nm was comparable to that of a deaerated acetonitrile cluster solution (∼0.10 at λex of 380 nm), and that was considerably greater than that of an aerated acetonitrile cluster solution (0.01 at λex of 375 nm).18 A summary of the optical properties and PCEs of similar inorganic–organic salts containing LSCs are shown in Table S4 (ESI†).19–21 The high PLQY of this LSC plate at a shorter excitation wavelength, 81.6% at 330 nm, was comparable to that of the LSC film prepared by blending the similar dye (TBA)2Mo6Cl14 with polymers (PBMMA and PEMA) yielding 75% of the PLQY at λex of 325 nm.10,22 These high PLQYs at short wavelengths could be attributed to interactions between the polymer PMMA matrix and the dye clusters as suggested in previous report.10,22
However, one cannot rule out the contribution of scattering on such high PLQYs at short wavelengths from the solid sample during PLQY measurements. The LSC devices showed high stability with a negligible decrease in PLQYs after 15 months (Fig. S4, ESI†). We kept the LSC devices on our laboratory bench at ambient temperature (20–25 °C), humidity (20–60%) and light (200–300 lux), and the PLQYs were measured. We believe that PMMA copolymerized with hydrophobic counter cation anchoring anionic cluster dyes is an excellent waveguide in terms of stability for a practical LSC system.

Fig. 3(d) shows a simulation of the LSC system efficiency as a function of the waveguide plate length and the experimental results of our LSC efficiencies were marked. For the simulation, the dependence of LSC performance (ηLSC) on the side length of the module (L) was calculated using an equation suggested by J. S. Batchelder group as follows: , where  is the normalized efficiency of the photovoltaic cell and ηOpt is the optical efficiency of the waveguide, which depends on the module side length L.23 (1) can be estimated using the absorption efficiency of the PV material under an AM 1.5 G spectrum, ηPVABS(AM 1.5 G), and the external quantum efficiency of the PV material, ηEQE(λ), as shown in eqn (1). Here, PL(λ) is the luminophore photoluminescent emission spectrum and ηPV(AM 1.5 G) is the edge mounted PV cell efficiency under AM 1.5 G illumination. The measured efficiencies of LSCs fabricated with square plate sizes of 2 cm, 6 cm, and 8 cm showed a good agreement with the simulated efficiencies. Therefore, when the size of the LSC is increased up to 1 m, the efficiency of the LSC is expected to maintain about 0.88%. The results of simulation suggest its promise for window size LSC systems (Fig. 3(d)).
The efficiency of the LSC can be evaluated in terms of the optical efficiency (ηOpt), which is a fundamental parameter for its performance. The ηOpt is defined as the number of photons emitted from the LSC edge over the total number of photons arriving on the surface of the LSC. It can be calculated as ηOpt = (1 − R)·ηAbs·ηRA·ηPL·ηTrap, where R is the front face reflection, ηAbs is the solar spectrum absorption efficiency of the luminophore, ηRA is the efficiency accounting for reabsorption losses, and ηTrap is the waveguide efficiency. A detailed estimation of  and ηOpt was found in the literature.10,24
To obtain information on the reabsorption loss within the LSC waveguide, we investigated the Si PV response as a function of the distance (d) between the PV cell and the excitation position (Fig. 4). Therefore, the PL intensities and the current density JSC are expected to decrease with the increasing d due to the combined effect of light scattering, escaping from the waveguide and reabsorption losses by the dye. The maximum JSC was achieved when the excitation position was close to the PV cell and it gradually decreased as d increased from 1 cm to 8 cm (∼40% decrease linearly for 8 cm). It is well known that PL of an organic luminophore such as Lumogen R305 (BASF) used in state-of-the-art LSCs exhibited an exponential decrease with increasing d, which is mainly due to reabsorption losses.25 Also, it was reported that in the LSC with inorganic quantum dots such as Si, PbS, CdSe, and CuInSeS, the effect of reabsorption losses overwhelms losses due to escaping of PL from the waveguide.26–29 The feature of JSC reduction with increasing d observed in our cluster dye LSC exhibited a similar feature to those of PL decrease due to only photon escaping (30–70% decrease).29 We found the similar feature of JSC response as a function of d in the LSC consisting of ZnCuGaS/ZnS core/shell quantum dots. This LSC exhibited an exponential decrease of JSC with 90% loss over an 8 cm length of d.30 The light scattering losses at optical-defect with in the PMMA plate appear to be not significant because the absorption and emission spectra of (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] in acetonitrile and the (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA hybrid in the solid state LSC plate are essentially identical (Fig. 1(b)). Therefore, JSC reduction of ∼40% as a function of d seems mainly attributed to photon escaping from the surface of the LSC plate, even if there might be small losses due to reabsorption. These small reabsorption losses as a function of d observed in the (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA hybrid solid is due to a large downshift of the PL of ∼390 nm suppressing reabsorption. Therefore, this result suggests the potential of our LSC materials for the realization of large-area photovoltaic windows.

The performances of our LSCs are still low for practical applications with PCE. However, there are significant advantages in the hexanuclear cluster family (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I8L6] hybrids. Their absorption in the 400–450 nm range can be intensified by selecting other optically active organic ligands at L6 sites.31 Also, their PLQYs can be further improved by changing cations (dMDAEMA)+ by adopting well known luminescent inorganic cations such as rare-earth Yb3+, which can absorb photons in the 400–450 nm range and down-convert one high energy photons into two lower energy photons (∼980 nm).32
Experimental
Materials
Synthesis of LSC materials: Mo 99.8% was purchased from Plansee, and I2 99.8% and CsI 99.99% were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methyl-methacrylate (MMA), 2,2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate, 1-iodododecane and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) (12 wt% in acetone) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MMA was washed with 1 M aqueous solution of NaOH and dried first over magnesium sulfate and then stored over activated molecular sieves (3 Å) for at least 48 h prior to polymerization. AIBN was recrystallised from methanol.
Synthetic procedures
Cs2Mo6I14 used as a starting material for a luminophore was synthesized from MoI2 and CsI according to the procedure described in the literature and its purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction.33 First, MoI2 was synthesized by heating a stoichiometric mixture of Mo and I2 at 700 °C for 4 days in a vacuum sealed silica tube. Afterwards, Cs2[Mo6I14] was prepared from stoichiometric amounts of MoI2 and CsI. The mixture (0.5 g) was ground, formed as a pellet, and placed into silica tube, which was sealed under vacuum. The tube was heated for three days at 700 °C. After the reaction, the X-ray powder pattern of the final product, recorded using a Rigaku diffractometer using Cu Kα1, showed a good agreement with the theoretical one, simulated for Cs2[Mo6I14] (Fig. S5, ESI†). The organic cation [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyldodecylammonium iodide (dMDAEMAI) was synthesized from 2,2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and 1-iodododecane. The mixture of 2,2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (5 mL, 0.030 mol) and 1-iodododecane (7.5 mL, 0.030 mol) were dissolved in chloroform (50 mL) and heated at 50 °C for 18 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and precipitated in cold diethyl ether. The obtained white solid was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. The synthesized dMDAEMAI was confirmed by (CDCl3)–δ(1H) NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S6, ESI†).
To synthesize (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14], 1.0 g (0.38 mmol) of Cs2[Mo6I14] and 1.0 g (2.21 mmol) of dMDAEMAI were stirred in acetone (150 mL) for 24 h. The obtained product was filtered, and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The solid product was washed to remove excess CsI with a 1:1 mixture of CH3OH/H2O, giving a maroon-colored powder. The synthesized (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] was confirmed by (CDCl3)–δ(1H) NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S7, ESI†). The (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6Cl14] complex was also synthesized through a similar methods used in the (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] synthesis using Cs2[Mo6Cl14].34
LSC fabrication procedures
To fabricate LSC modules, solutions of (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] in MMA with concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg mL−1 were prepared and sonicated for 30 minutes in an ultrasound bath to dissolve (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14], and then AIBN as an initiator was added in a volume ratio of AIBN(μL):MMA(mL) of 5.5:1. This mixture was sonicated for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous solution, poured into a glass mold (a round glass vial with a diameter of 10 cm), and kept in a dry oven for 24 h at 60 °C. The mixture turned into a hard polymer after 12–24 h. The final hybrid materials in the solid state were cut into square shape of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 with thicknesses of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 mm. All LSCs were polished with sand paper (100, 600, 1000, and 2000) and cloth (MD-Nap 200 mm diameter purchased from Struers). For large LSC plates over 6 cm in length, instead of pouring the solution into a glass mold, the mixture was injected into molds consisting of two glass slides separated by ∼3 mm thick flexible TYGON E-3603 vacuum tube spacers.
For the PCE measurement, Si PV cells were attached to four edges of the LSCs and four cells are connected in a parallel fashion. For the EQE measurement, a Si PV cell was attached to one edge of the module using epoxy with the same refractive index as PMMA, and the three edges without the PV cell were covered by a black tape. The PV cell used in this work consisted of monocrystalline silicon, which was purchased from a commercial supplier (NSP-Neo Solar Power, NS6QL-1900) with an efficiency of 19%. The Si PV cells were cut using a laser into strips with a light harvesting are of 2.5 cm × 0.3 cm. After wire soldering, the efficiency of the Si PV strip decreased to 16.00 ± 0.1% at 1 sun (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Characterization
The PLQY of the cluster–polymer hybrid was measured in the 300–375 nm range using a UV-NIR absolute PLQY measurement system (Hamamatsu Photonics C11347-11) with xenon excitation light. The PLQY is a ratio of the number of emitted photons to the number of absorbed photons. The emission spectra of (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14] solution in acetonitrile, in MMA, and the solid (dMDAEMA)2[Mo6I14]–PMMA hybrid were measured using a PerkinElmer LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer equipped with a xenon lamp at 298 K. The emission spectra are recorded in the range of 500–900 nm with an excitation wavelength of 345 nm.
The PCE of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. An AM 1.5 G simulator was used (Mc Science K201 LAB50, Oriel) to simulate the solar spectrum. The front face of the LSC waveguide near Si PV cell attached edges was masked by the black electrical tape to avoid any direct illumination of the solar source, ensuring that the measured current only generated from the emission of luminophores in the LSC was measured. The EQE of the attached Si PV cells, which shows the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency as a function of the wavelength, was measured under monochromatic light generated from a 300 W xenon lamp in the range 320–1100 nm using a K3100 EQX (McScience, Korea) and the result is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The EQE of the devices were then calculated using the measured EQE and current (ISC) of the attached PV Si cell as a reference following eqn (2)35 (2)
The current ISC of the device as a function at various wavelengths was measured under a solar simulator using a home-built set-up, consisting of 23 bandpass interference filters.
Conclusions
We synthesized a hexamolybdenum metal cluster–polymer hybrid and fabricated a robust LSC system with a high PCE of 1.24% and a high transparency of 85%. The high transparency to visible light was due to the uniform dispersion of nano-sized cluster dyes anchored electrostatically on the backbone of the polymer matrix. A large downshift and extended coverage of the solar spectrum of the hybrid solid in the UV-vis range of 350–600 nm provided reabsorption free large window scale LSCs. We demonstrated that the nano-sized molecular complex incorporated LSC waveguide can be easily realized by a solution process without chemical decay, size control, and complex spectral tuning as known in the process for various conventional inorganic QDs. This LSC waveguide consisting of a new inorganic–organic salt co-polymerized within the polymer matrix offers a new direction for the development of a practical LSC system for building-integrated energy harvesting smart windows.
