    , Accepted 31st January 2021First published on 1st February 2021AbstractOxide perovskites are promising candidates for future solar energy conversion applications due to their intriguing properties, e.g. above bandgap photovoltage, which can be beneficial to overcome fundamental limitations of well-established semiconductor materials. Yet, their inherent wide bandgap remains a hurdle. This work revisited the long-standing concerns about the bandgap reduction in bismuth layered perovskite oxides through a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches. Ab initio calculations suggest that the reduced bandgap in cobalt-doped bismuth titanate can be attributed to the increase of density-of-states in the vicinity of the valence and conduction band edge. More importantly, comparison of the energy landscape for different cobalt substitution sites and its correlation with electronic bandgap shows that substituting Ti with cobalt equally in both inner and outer perovskite blocks with respect to the vicinity of Bi2O2 layer, is the most energetically favoured configuration with a significant 45% reduction of bandgap compared to the undoped bismuth layered oxide. The experimental replication of the bandgap tuning in cobalt modified Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 thin films prepared under optimal processing conditions strongly underpins the validity of our DFT prediction. Such compositional and structural engineering enabled a much narrower bandgap (∼1.7 eV) followed with an approximately 8-fold enhancement of the photocurrent density compared to the parental structure. This work will facilitate the design and synthesis route for tailoring the conventional wide bandgap ferroelectric oxides to be applied in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Photoferroelectrics have spurred lots of interest in the research community as a promising candidate for pairing the photovoltaic effect with other functional properties. The photovoltaic effect in ferroelectrics fundamentally differs from that of conventional semiconductors. The spontaneous electric polarization is the driving force for the separation of photo-induced charges, and thus in contrast to the p–n junction solar cells, an above-bandgap photovoltage is expected, which may result in power conversion efficiency exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit.1 Ferroelectric oxides also show good resistance to humidity and ultraviolet light that gives them an edge over hybrid halide perovskite cells. However, the major drawback of the photoferroelectrics is their intrinsic wide bandgap, which only allows the absorption of up to 20 percent of the solar spectrum. The wide bandgap of ferroelectric oxides is originated from the ubiquitous orbital interactions in this material, occurring between the transition metal d-orbital at the conduction band minimum and oxygen 2p-orbital at the valence band maximum. Hence, the quest for narrow-bandgap ferroelectric materials is essential to enhance the light absorption in the visible wavelengths, particularly through modifying their orbital interaction. To date, a limited number of ferroelectric oxides with narrow bandgap comparable to that of Si have been identified, such as [KNbO3]1−x[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3−δ]x (Eg = 1.1 eV),2 and Bi2FeCrO6 (Eg = 1.4 eV).3 Inspired by the bandgap tuning attempted in previous studies, one can rationally explore the compositional modulation for engineering the bandgap since bandgap characteristic generally arises from strongly localized d-electrons in ferroelectric oxide with a transition metal at cation site.4 Nevertheless, the trade-off between bandgap reduction and other intriguing physical properties has prevented the progress toward low bandgap photoferroelectrics.
Recently, Aurivillus bismuth-layered perovskites, such as Bin+1Fen−3Ti3O3n+3, are gaining renewed attention for photovoltaic application, driven by their lead-free nature and inherent potential for adjusting their physical properties. Their complex structure bestows numerous avenues to fine-tune the design of material through varying the number of layers, multi-site chemical substitution and applying strain to the crystal lattice. Many studies have focused on narrowing the bandgap of Bi-containing layered perovskite via incorporation of transition metals into the crystal lattice, for instance, the values within 1.28–3.1 eV have been reported for Bi6Fe2−xAxTi3O18 (A = Ni and Co).5–7 Moreover, four-layer material system (n = 4) exhibited the enhanced PV effect modulated by FE polarization,8–10 and magnetostriction,11 providing a powerful degree of control to change both magnitude and direction of the photo-response. A comprehensive review on the recent progress of Aurivillus-type layered oxides can be found elsewhere.12
The n = 3 Aurivillius phase with chemical formula of Bi4TiO3O12 (BiT) possesses a highly anisotropic pseudo-orthorhombic structure (a = 5.450 Å, b = 5.406 Å, and c = 32.832 Å) belonging to B2cb symmetry (space group No. 41).13 It consists of two distinct alternating layers i.e. one fluorite-like bismuth oxide (Bi2O2)2+ layer connected to two perovskite (Bi2Ti3O10)2− layers with an additional oxygen plane (see Fig. 1(a)). The distortion of octahedra in perovskite blocks is known to be the origin of ferroelectricity, and in contrast to other perovskites, retention of ferroelectricity in BiT is less susceptible to the presence of oxygen vacancies to some extent,14 which provides new avenues for tuning its optical properties while maintaining ferroelectricity. Several studies have been conducted to understand the substitutional impact of rare-earth elements on ferroelectric properties of BiT.15–17 The lanthanide ions exhibit a noticeable site preference for A-site substitution and of all, La-substituted BiT (Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12, BLT) shows a combination of preferred properties of the low coercive field, large remanent polarization and high fatigue endurance, which makes it promising for applications in non-volatile memory devices.18 From the electronic structure perspective, the charge transfer excitation between the O-2p and Ti-3d states governs the bandgap of BiT, which results in a wide bandgap of ∼3.55 eV.19 Since La doping is expected to induce minor changes on the bandgap of BiT, efforts to narrow the bandgap of BiT were primarily devoted to B-site substitution by transition metals. For instance, Choi et al. studied the LaTMO3 alloying of BiT and found that transition metal doping can reduce the bandgap through creating a split-off state immediately below the conduction band of BiT.20 In particular, Mott-insulator LaCoO3 (LCO) was found to significantly reduce the bandgap of BiT to 2.65 eV via site-specific substitution of titanium with cobalt ions at interfaces of BiT/LCO artificial superlattice thin films.4 By utilizing simple conventional doping approach, a more recent study showed light absorption of epitaxial (Fe,Co) co-doped BLT (001) thin films extends to the visible region up to 500 nm wavelength,21 which is still far from the solar spectrum maxima, i.e. 1.4 eV. In both studies, the role of cobalt doping found to be decisive in the reduction of bandgap. However, there are some discrepancies about the position of cobalt ions in the complex Aurivillus structure of doped-BiT thin films.

(c) Energy landscape for Bi3.25La0.75Co1Ti2O11.5 and the lowest energy structure. 
Here, we performed a thorough density functional theory (DFT) calculation to shed light on the preferred position of cobalt ions in perovskite layer and its correlation with bandgap reduction. Although consistent with previous studies relating the bandgap reduction to the occurrence of mid-gap state via cobalt doping, our result, by contrast, clearly shows replacement of Ti with cobalt equally in both inner and outer perovskite blocks with respect to vicinity of Bi2O2 layer, is the most energetically favored configuration with about 45% bandgap reduction compared to BLT. Furthermore, we empirically studied the impact of chemical substitution on the bandgap and photocurrent response of epitaxial BLT-based thin films. Through judicious control of the deposition parameters, the bandgap of BLT was effectively narrowed down from 3.63 eV to 1.7 eV for Bi3.25La0.75Co1Ti2O12 (BLCT), which is so far, to our knowledge, closest to the optimal bandgap value of 1.4 eV reported for the Aurivillius three-layered bismuth titanate thin film. The realization of bandgap reduction by ∼53% in epitaxial BLCT thin film evidently underpins the DFT results with high level of certainty. Moreover, a substantially enhanced photocurrent density was observed for the doped-BLT films that can be possibly explained by the increased absorption of the visible light concomitant with the bandgap reduction.
Experimental method
Density functional theory calculations were performed at the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) level of theory using the VASP code. To consider the strongly correlated nature of d- and f-electronic states for Co, Ti, Fe and La, the GGA+U correction schemes are applied throughout with on-site potentials of 5, 5, 5.3 and 9 eV. All calculations were carried out with explicit spin-polarisation at an energy cut-off of 400 eV for the projector augmented planewaves (PAW). For structural optimisations, both the atomic positions and lattice parameters were fully optimized until the energy change is less than 10−4 eV. Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling is used at a uniform grid spacing of 0.04 Å−1 in the reciprocal space throughout.
BLT, BLFT and BLCT thin films were fabricated via laser molecular beam epitaxy (KrF excimer laser, λ = 248 nm) on (001) single-crystal SrTiO3 substrate (Shinkosha, Co Ltd, Japan). All films were grown through ablation of ceramic targets prepared by the solid-state reaction with starting oxides, including Bi2O3, La2O3, Co3O4, Fe2O3 and TiO2 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich). Excess bismuth oxide (10 wt%) was used to compensate for volatilization of bismuth during film deposition and target preparation. Deposition was conducted at substrate temperature 720–760 °C, in a dynamic partial oxygen pressure of 100 mTorr, and with laser energy density of about 2 J cm−2. To maintain consistency, the same number of pulses was used to fabricate all the samples (yielding thickness of approximately 215 nm. (Fig. S1, ESI†)). Co-planar Au electrodes were deposited on the film surface through a shadow mask consisting of the linear channel pattern (spacing: 0.03 mm) using metal thermal evaporator for photovoltaic characterizations.
The phase identification, crystal structure and epitaxial features of the thin films were studied using X-ray diffraction, i.e. MRD Panalytical X-ray diffractometers with CuKα radiation. The surface morphology and roughness were studied from topography images using an atomic force microscope (Bruker Dimension Icon). The X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a ESCALAB250Xi (Thermo Scientific) spectrometer using a mono-chromated Al Kα source (160 W) at base pressure below 2 × 10−9 mbar. The acquired spectra were adjusted with reference to the binding energy of adventitious hydrocarbon (C-1s = 284.8 eV).
The optical properties of doped and undoped BLT thin films were investigated using variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam M-2000 DI) over the wavelengths ranging between 200 to 1000 nm at room temperature. The ellipsometry data was analysed through an optical model composed of the substrate, thin film and layer of surface roughness on top represented by Bruggeman effective medium approximation (50% void and 50% bulk film).22 Parametrization of the optical constant consists of multiple Gaussian oscillators to fit the data with minimized mean square error (typically less than 10). The bandgap energy was estimated using Tauc's extrapolation method.23 The photocurrent characterizations of the thin films were conducted with a standardized set up consisting of a light source (Sciencetech Tunable Light Source TLS55-X300), a source meter (Keithley 4200) with probe station for sourcing and measurement. Photocurrent density (J) was measured between two coplanar Au electrodes at a voltage from 0 to 1 V under the illumination generated from a 300 W lamp.
In order to confirm ferroelectric nature of samples, BLT-based thin films were deposited on La2/3Sr1/3MnO3-buffered SrTiO3 (111) oriented single crystal substrates by LMBE under exactly the same conditions as their (001) oriented counterparts. Polarization–electric field (P–E) loops of these thin films were obtained using ferroelectric workstation (Radiant, Multiferroic II) at 1 kHz under ambient condition. Prior to the measurements, Au top electrode pads (100 μm diameter) were sputtered through a shadow mask on the thin film surface.
Results and discussion
The electronic structure of bismuth titanate was investigated using density functional theory calculation in order to unfold the effectiveness of chemical substitution in reducing the bandgap. Total and projected density of state (DOS) of each atom for BiT structure (in a Bi16Ti12O48 supercell) are shown in Fig. 1(b). It is evident that major contribution of the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum are from O-2p and Ti-d states, respectively. Note that the estimated bandgap energy of material is generally smaller than experimental value because of underestimation of DFT calculation. Next, the structure of Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 was modelled with a (2 × 1 × 1) supercell in which three Bi atoms are substituted by La atom, leading to four possible configurations. The lowest energy structure for BLT contains one La dopants per the (Bi2O2)2+ layer and two La in the perovskite-type (Bi2Ti3O10)2− layer arranged diagonally across in the supercell. Such configuration maximally reduces the dopant-induced strain, forming the most stable structure. Spin resolved DOS for BLT reveals the La-f states mainly distribute at high-energy position of conduction band (4–5 eV) and slightly interact with the unoccupied Ti-d states in the conduction band. Thus, the electronic bandgap opens up slightly upon La-doping.
The atomistic model of Bi3.25La0.75Co1Ti2O11.5 was built based on the optimized lowest-energy structure of BLT. Assuming charge neutrality upon off-valent doping, two furthest-distanced oxygen vacancies were introduced into doped-BLT atomic structure, one in each (Bi2O2)2+ layer, which is deemed to be the preferred site for the formation of oxygen vacancy in the bismuth-layered structure (see Fig. 1(c)).21 This strategy is adopted to avoid further sampling for the positions of oxygen vacancies in combinations of different Co dopant positions, which is not computationally tractable. Sampling random distribution of Co3+ to replace Ti4+ ions gives a total of 62 structurally unique configurations. The ground state configuration of Bi3.25La0.75CoTi2O11.5 shows the bandgap closed up upon cobalt substitution, since the Co-d states are located at a lower energy in the conduction band compared to Ti-t2g state. More fundamentally, the downshift of the conduction band edge is not caused by the shifting of Ti-d states, the energetic position of which remain roughly the same as BLT, rather, it is the d-electronic states from newly doped Co ions that gives rise to this shallow conductive band. In this sense, this Co-d states at the conduction band edge may also be considered as new intermediate states that are introduced into the band gap of BLT.
Positional configuration of cobalt dopant in BLT structure seems to have a nontrivial impact on the magnitude of bandgap. Fig. 2(a) shows probable substitution sites for cobalt ions in perovskite blocks. Evidence regarding the importance of dopant substitutional site is presented in two previous studies, but still inconclusive. Choi et al. presumed cobalt ions preferentially replace Ti in perovskite block adjacent to Bi2O2 layer even though they could not directly confirm their presumption by electron energy-loss spectroscopy,4 while the other study claimed replacing Ti-sites positioned farther from Bi2O2 layer with cobalt is energetically favoured by 116 meV per formula unit.21 Hence, a more detailed study has been conducted on the preferred position of cobalt ions in the perovskite layer and its correlation with the bandgap reduction. Fig. 2(b) shows the relationship between the total energies (stability, left panel) of BLCT, with respect to the percentage change in the electronic bandgap energies for BLT (right panel). The red line corresponds to the dopant configuration where all Co are placed in the BBBB or BBBA configurations (i.e. at least three Co are placed in B-site). Similarly, the blue lines correspond to AAAA or AAAB configurations. As shown, A-dominant substitution is statistically more preferred configuration compared to B-dominated configurations consistent with site-specific substitution study reported earlier;4 but both configurations occur high up in energy landscape. Thus, from an energy and statistical points of view, 50% mixture between A-site and B-site doping of Co in BLT should be the preferential case. Here, an eminent observation is that 50–50 distribution of cobalt in the inner and outer perovskite blocks with respect to proximity to Bi2O2 layer is statistically the most energetically favored configuration, resulting in approximately 45% bandgap reduction compared to the bandgap of La-doped BiT.

(b) Total energy-bandgap reduction relationship compared to La-doped BiT, red (blue) lines represent Co occupying B (A) sites only whereas yellow lines represent Co present in both A and B sites. A total of 62 different possible configurations were computed. 
To cross-compare the effect of different dopant with Co, all Co ions were replaced by Fe in the lowest energy structure of Bi3.25La0.75Co1Ti2O11.5, and subsequently re-optimized under identical setting. Different effects can be observed in the electronic density-of-states when Fe3+ ions are introduced to the BLT structure as shown in Fig. 1(b). First, the electronic structure shows weak spin polarisations at the band edge. Second, both the original valence and conduction band edges for BiT shift downward, making the Fermi level resides in the middle of the band gap. The valence band edge DOS, originated from O-p states significantly reduced compared to BLCT, which reduces the carrier concentrations that can be photoexcited across the band gap. Furthermore, Fig. 3 compares the eg–t2g ligand field splitting for the transition metal cation d-states in variously doped Bi4Ti3O12 systems. The small band gap widening in Bi3.25La0.75Ti3O12 is predominantly caused by the upshift of Ti-t2g states which subsequently reduces the eg–t2g splitting (Fig. 3(a and b)). This is probably correlated with the structural distortion in the perovskite-type layer induced by the La doping. The magnitude of eg–t2g splitting for Ti-d states do not seems to be much affected by the Co or Fe doping, but the downshifting of both Ti-eg and Ti-t2g is very significant in the case of Fe doping (Fig. 3(c and d)). The most significant finding here is that unlike the Ti-t2g or the Fe-t2g states, the Co-t2g states are completely occupied, meaning that Co doping can introduce additional electrons to be photoexcited, and thus enhance the photoconductivity (Fig. 3(e and f)).

To ascertain the possibility of bandgap tuning based on a priori results, doped and pristine BLT thin films were epitaxially deposited on STO (001) substrates as described in experimental method. Fig. 4(a) shows the XRD θ–2θ scan patterns of films deposited under the optimized conditions. Only the (002l) peaks of Aurivillus phase are detected, revealing that no secondary phase is present in the resolution limit of our XRD machine. The (002l) diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns indicate the layered perovskite structure.25,26 The (002l) diffraction peaks also suggest that the thin films were successfully grown with out-of-plane axis parallel to the surface normal of the substrate. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the XRD (008) peak position for BLCT film slightly shifts toward a higher angle, which corresponds to smaller d-spacing. The c-axis lattice parameter calculated from XRD (008) peak remained almost constant upon Fe-doping (32.63 Å), while it decreased to 32.53 Å for BLCT film. This suggests the lattice contracted marginally upon introduction of Co3+ ions as the ionic radii of Co3+ is smaller than that of Fe3+ in both high and low spin states.27 More detailed study on the valence state of constituents in the BLCT thin film is presented in supplementary file (Fig. S2, ESI†). It is also shown that XRD peaks are broader for Fe-doped samples compared to that of Co-substituted thin films. Incorporation of dopant with large ionic radii, e.g. Fe3+, may induce inhomogeneous strain and lattice imperfection, while this effect gets less pronounced with increasing the atomic number of dopant, i.e. from Fe to Co, which is in agreement with previous study.20 The impact of the induced disorder upon doping is also clearly evident from intensity diminution of lower order peak (i.e. (002) diffraction). Nonetheless, the overall XRD pattern for all samples remains nearly unaltered, suggesting the layered structure of bismuth titanate is maintained upon incorporation of dopants into the lattice.

(ed) XRD pole figure of (00l)-oriented BLT film where 2theta angle were fixed at 30.06° and (e) 32.9° (f) schematic drawing of lattice relationship between STO substrate and BLT thin film (BLT [010] || STO [110]). 
In addition to substrate temperature and oxygen partial pressure, laser repetition rate and fluence were found to have a pronounced impact on the phase and structure of the deposited films. Broad θ–2θ scan of films (Fig. S3, ESI†) revealed the absence of signature peaks when deposition rate was either high or low due to volatile nature of bismuth. Splitting of the (0012) peak was also observed when laser fluence deviated from the optimum value, which is frequently reported in highly oriented Aurivillius perovskite films due to the formation of out-of-phase boundaries (OPB) resulted from change in local stoichiometry by loss of bismuth.28–30 This clearly demonstrates the intricate procedure for optimizing the processing conditions that led to a very narrow deposition window as outlined in experimental method.
Although θ–2θ scan and rocking curves are sufficient to determine the structure and crystallinity of films, it is difficult to confirm the in-plane textured relationship between the film and substrate by 1D scan, especially for (001)-oriented BiT/STO heterostructure in which BiT lattice may have a 45° rotation with respect to the substrate lattice.31 Therefore, pole figures were used to confirm the in-plane orientation and lattice offset between the BLT film and the substrate. Fig. 4(d) and (e) show representative pole figures of BLT films at fixed Bragg reflection of 2θ = 30.06° and 32.9° corresponding to the BLT (117) and STO (110)/BLT (200) diffractions, respectively (also see Fig. S4, ESI†). Presence of four peaks separated by 90 degrees confirms four-fold symmetry, indicating BLT has a pseudo-tetragonal unit cell. This result provides evidence of a coherent in-plane orientation in the BLT films, which is associated to the thermodynamic stability on STO (001) substrate. Growth of thin film on a largely mismatched substrate requires the interfacial energy to be minimized. Thus, the BLT films with 1.2–2.1% lattice mismatch with respect to STO(001) substrate have been reported to grow in the (001) plane that has the lowest surface energy when the adatoms have the adequate mobility, for instance at high substrate temperature.32 As (001) planes are closely packed in BLT film, interfacial energy can be minimized when c-axis oriented film is formed with coherent in-plane orientation.33 Furthermore, there is an angle offset of 45° between BLT (200) and STO (110) peaks (see Fig. 4(e)), indicating BLT film has been deposited epitaxially along (001)-orientation with 45° in-plane rotation of the lattice with respect to the STO substrate as shown in Fig. 4(f). The surface morphology of samples was also studied using atomic force microscopy (Fig. S5 in ESI†), which further corroborates superior quality of the fabricated thin films. High quality epitaxial films are highly desired to exclude the performance variation associated with the nonuniformity of randomly oriented polycrystalline films.34
The optical bandgap was determined using extrapolation method proposed by Wood and Tauc.23Fig. 5(a–c) show (αhν)0.5 plots vs. photon energy in UV-vis spectrum for doped and pristine BLT films deposited under the optimised conditions, where α is the spectral absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy. The value of superscript was determined to be 0.5 from the extracted data, showing an indirect characteristic of the bandgap. This observation is in close accord with the theoretical calculation as delineated in supplementary information (Fig. S6, ESI†). The resultant bandgap for BLT films was estimated to be Eg =3.63 eV, which is slightly larger compared to that of pristine BiT films reported earlier.35,36 From Fig. 5(b), the substitution of Fe for Ti effectively narrowed down the bandgap to Eg = ∼2.9 eV. Here, more electronegative Fe ions preferentially substitute titanium sites,37 lowering the conduction band as the Fe energy level is lower than that of Ti 3d. As mentioned earlier, the bandgap energy of BiT depends on the O-2p and B-site cation d states. Thus, B-site substitution can alter the electronic band structure of BiT. Tauc plot further confirms the reduction of bandgap with cobalt substitution to Eg = ∼1.7 eV, which is notably lower than that of our Fe-doped BLT thin films. In contrast to BLFT thin films, two clear features are recognised for BLCT thin films (see Fig. 5(c)). First, the strong absorption at around 3.5 eV can be attributed to the charge transfer between O 2p and Ti 3d (eg). Next, the presence of an additional absorption peak located at lower photon energies is evidence of forming mid-gap state consistent with previous study,4 probably due to the transition between O 2p and unoccupied Co 3d (eg) states. Although similar analogy was applied hypothetically by An et al. to evaluate association of the bandgap reduction with geometric configuration of cobalt dopant in BLT structure,21 but regardless of narrowed bandgap of Co-doped BLT film, no extra absorption peak was clearly detected in the plot extracted from ultraviolet-visible spectrometry data that can be linked with the claimed split-off density of state in conduction band. Of note, the latter study assumed a direct bandgap for doped-BLT thin films, while both experimental and theoretical result presented here confirm indirect characteristic of the optical transition. One may also question the probable influence of undesired cobalt oxide phases; however, using optical data of BiT and cobalt oxide phases, Choi et al. previously refuted the influence of unexpected cobalt phase on the bandgap reduction in site-specific substituted BiT thin films.4 On a similar note, no features were observed in this study at approximately 1.7 or 2.9 eV which are absorption bands representing charge transfer processes related to Co+3/Co2+ d orbital and O2−/Co2+ p-d orbital, respectively.38 Therefore, the presence of parasitic cobalt oxide phase and its impact on the bandgap reduction can be disregarded here. These results affirm that successful modulation of bandgap can be achieved upon simplified doping approach, which has less complexity compared to site-specific substitution reported earlier.4

To ascertain the ferroelectric properties of our samples, we studied the polarization–electric field (P–E) hysteresis loops of a non-c-axis oriented, namely (111)-oriented BLT-based thin films having the same compositions. Given the large polarization anisotropy in compounds of Aurivillius family, polarization along c-axis is very weak owing to the dominance of a–b plane spontaneous polarization.26,39,40Fig. 5(d) shows polarization-electric field relationship of pristine and doped BLT thin films deposited on STO (111), confirming the ferroelectric nature of all samples through exhibiting a well-defined hysteresis loop. As expected and confirmed by DFT, incorporation of transition metal into BLT lattice introduce extra charges that causes degradation of remanent polarization upon doping.
In order to confirm the effect of bandgap reduction, the photocurrent density of the films was measured between two coplanar electrodes (see Fig. 5(e)) under dark and white light illumination conditions. The current density enhancement is clearly observed for all the samples when illuminated with white light. Moreover, the maximum photocurrent density under external bias of 1 V is drastically enhanced from 22.8 nA cm−2 to 118.6 and 171.0 nA cm−2 for BLFT and BLCT films, respectively. The rise of photocurrent in BLCT thin films can be possibly explained by the increase of both densities-of-states in the vicinity of the valence and conduction band edge compared to the undoped BiT. This effect along with narrowed bandgap can increase the joint-DOS which leads to an enhancement of photocurrent. Besides, the bulk properties of ferroelectric oxides, e.g. light absorption, carrier lifetime and electrical conductivity, influence the photocurrent considerably.41 Here, the reduced bandgap of BLT films through doping resulted in higher absorption of the visible light that clearly yields in more mobile carrier and facilitates the charge transport. Moreover, the possible mechanism for the enhanced electrical conductivity is the formation of oxygen vacancies that can be easily tailored via B-site doping. Upon substitution of Ti4+ with transition metal dopants, the presence of oxygen vacancies is inevitable for maintaining the charge balance, due to the difference in oxidation state between titanium ion and that of dopants, i.e. 2+/3+ for Co and Fe. The dissimilar photocurrent for cobalt and iron as dopants can be explained by the difference in transition metal-t2g states. As discussed earlier in Fig. 3, the Co-t2g states, unlike the Ti-t2g or the Fe-t2g states, are completely occupied, indicating that Co doping can introduce additional electrons to be photoexcited, and thus enhance the photoconductivity.
Our ascertainment of bandgap tuning via transition metal doping was based on combined theoretical and empirical studies that were entirely consistent. Previous reports, although, have successfully narrowed the bandgap of layered bismuth titanate, but each has certain limitation such as intricate fabrication process or not completely matching predicted result. Table 1 provides a comparison of the bandgap reduction and related enhancement of photocurrent responses of our BLCT epitaxial thin films with those of representative BLCT-based thin films. Note that tabulation of this information did not intend to grade the results, in particular the absolute amplitude of photocurrent density, given the difference in light intensity, strength of applied electric fields and electrode materials between our work and previous studies, but rather to provide insights on the recent progress on the bandgap tuning of the bismuth layered perovskite thin films. These findings affirm the quintessentially significant impact of cobalt on the bandgap of the bismuth layered perovskite oxide. Yet, adoption of less-costly dopant should also be considered in future studies since dramatic rise in the price of cobalt was seen in 2017–2018 in response to the rapid expansion of the Li-ion battery industry.42 In future works, it is also worth investigating the influence of other factors like thickness and strain, etc. on the optoelectronic properties to determine whether the observation seen for other perovskite oxide thin films holds for the Aurivllius-type bismuth titanate.

Conclusions
In a nutshell, the present study provides insightful grounds on the underlying mechanism of bandgap reduction in bismuth layered perovskite oxides. Our DFT calculation not only shows that cobalt doping introduces intermediate states into the bandgap of pristine BLT structure, which corresponds to the largely narrowed bandgap of BLCT film but also confirms the preferred site for dopant is the equal distribution of cobalt in both inner and outer perovskite blocks with respect to proximity to Bi2O2 layer. These findings were underpinned by fabrication of high-quality doped BLT films through precise control of L-MBE processing parameters. Finally, as evidenced by our experimental results, the simplified doping strategy greatly boosts up the photocurrent that will be advantageous for the development of high efficiency photoferroelectric devices.
