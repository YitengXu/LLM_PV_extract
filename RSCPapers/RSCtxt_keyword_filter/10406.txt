    , Accepted 4th May 2016First published on 4th May 2016AbstractAll inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with 50–85% photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission in the range of 440–682 nm have been successfully synthesized at room temperature in open air. This facile strategy enables us to prepare gram-scale CsPbBr3 NCs with a PLQY approaching 80%.
Lead halide-based perovskites have been extensively investigated as the absorbing materials of thin film solar cells in the past six years,1–10 and a record power conversion efficiency of 20.1% has been achieved.10 Comparatively, the lead halide-based perovskites have received little attention as luminescent materials.11–24 Several recent reports have demonstrated that lead halide-based perovskites can serve as promising emitters in light-emitting diodes (LEDs).11–15 Therefore, the synthesis of highly luminescent perovskite colloidal nanocrystals has become a particularly important research topic.16–24 Recently, Kovalenko et al. firstly synthesized all inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals in an organic high-boiling-point solvent (1-octadecene) by a hot-injection approach.16 The reaction was performed by swiftly injecting cesium oleate precursor solution into PbX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) precursor solution at a temperature of 140–200 °C. As-prepared CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals exhibit a tunable emission in the wavelength range of 410–700 nm, narrow PL full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 12–42 nm and high PLQYs of 50–90%,16 which are comparable to or even better than those highly luminescent CdSe quantum dots (QDs) in the literature.25–29 Compared with chalcogenide-based II–VI and I–III–VI semiconductor QDs, highly luminescent PNCs can be synthesized at lower temperatures in several seconds.16–23 More importantly, the emission peaks of the perovskite nanocrystals can be finely controlled by an anion-exchange reaction.17,18 For a hot-injection reaction, the size of nanocrystals is highly related to the reaction temperature, whereas the reaction temperature is uncontrollable upon the injection of cold precursor solution, which leads to low batch-to-batch reproducibility. This problem will become more prominent in the large-scale production, and it can be resolved by developing a room-temperature synthetic strategy. The crystalline organic/inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) thin films30,31 and nanocrystals20–23 can be formed at room temperature, which motivates us to synthesize highly crystalline CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs at room temperature. Recently, there have been two reports on the room-temperature synthesis of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs by a heterogeneous reaction.32,33 PbX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) were used as the starting materials and dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). However, DMF can severely degrade and even dissolve CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs, which will lead to a decrease in production yield of PNCs.20 Therefore, developing a homogeneous approach is of great significance for the large-scale production of high quality CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs.
Herein, we present a facile and rapid approach for the synthesis of highly luminescent CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs. Firstly, fatty acid-capped CsPbBr3 PNCs were obtained by mixing the Cs+ and Pb2+ toluene solution with Br− toluene solution at room temperature. A variety of fatty acids with different chain lengths were used to prepare Cs+ and Pb2+ precursor solution by dissolving CsOH (or Cs2CO3) and PbO, and the excess fatty acids served as the capping agents. Note that all experimental procedures were conducted in open air. No aggregation was found in the crude solution of CsPbBr3 PNCs. Then, alloyed CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs were synthesized via an in situ anion exchange reaction by the addition of a certain amount of tetrabutylammonium chloride or tetrabutylammonium iodide. Finally, as-prepared PNCs were purified by using γ-butyrolactone and were re-dispersed in toluene for various characterization. The experimental details are provided in the ESI.†

Fig. 1a shows a series of UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of CsPbBr3 PNCs using fatty acid as the capping agent with different chain lengths (C4–C18). Although a variety of fatty acids can be used to prepare well-dispersed CsPbBr3 PNCs, their PLQYs exhibit an increasing trend with increasing alkyl chain length (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The PLQY of CsPbBr3 PNCs can exceed 80% when myristic acid or oleic acid was used as the capping agent, whereas butyric acid-capped CsPbBr3 PNCs possess a low PLQY in the range of 20–30%, probably due to a weak bonding strength. However, these short-chain fatty acid-coated PNCs could provide better carrier transportation, which makes them very attractive for the optoelectronic device applications such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Apart from fatty acids, some organic amines (butylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, oleylamine, and trioctylamine), 1-dodecanethiol, trioctylphosphine, trioctylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphine oxide were also used to synthesize CsPbBr3 PNCs at room temperature. However, no CsPbBr3 PNCs were observed in the presence of these strong capping agents since the nucleation of CsPbBr3 PNCs will be completely inhibited at room temperature.

In our case, hydrophobic tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) was dissolved in toluene and was used as the Br− precursor. Other quaternary ammonium bromides including tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and dihexadecyldimethylammonium bromide were also chosen to synthesize CsPbBr3 PNCs. Note that these quaternary ammonium bromides have low solubility in toluene, thus chloroform was used as the solvent to synthesize CsPbBr3 PNCs. It was found that the highly luminescent CsPbBr3 PNCs can be only prepared by using TOAB and TBAB as the precursors. Additionally, the effect of organic solvents on the synthesis of oleic acid-capped CsPbBr3 PNCs was studied. For the hot-injection reaction, 1-octadecene was commonly used as the solvent. Because our synthesis was performed at room temperature, various nonpolar organic solvents such as toluene, xylene, chloroform, dichloromethane, and hexane can be adopted to prepare CsPbBr3 PNCs. Fig. S2 (ESI†) presents UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of oleic-acid-capped CsPbBr3 PNCs synthesized in various organic solvents. When toluene and xylene are used as solvents, the PL quantum yields of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are higher than those of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals synthesized in hexane and dichloromethane (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Additionally, the reaction temperature has a profound effect on the PLQY of CsPbBr3 PNCs. As the reaction temperature increases from 30 °C to 90 °C, we observed a dramatic decrease in PLQY (Fig. S4, ESI†). The optimum reaction temperature was found to be 20–30 °C. Surprisingly, even though the synthesis of CsPbBr3 PNCs was performed at 0 °C, the PLQY can still reach as high as 68%. In previous reports, group II–VI and I–III–VI core QDs usually exhibited a bi-exponential or a tri-exponential fluorescence decay, and the surface-related emission was commonly observed.34–37 The photoluminescence of CsPbBr3 PNCs was dominated by the band-edge emission. Unlike II–VI and I–III–VI core QDs, all fluorescence decay curves of different fatty acid-capped CsPbBr3 PNCs can be well fitted with a single exponential function (Fig. 1b and Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating that there is only one radiative recombination center in CsPbBr3 PNCs, which favors attaining high PLQY. For butyric acid-, hexanoic acid-, octanoic acid-, dodecanoic acid-, tetradodecanoic acid-, and oleic acid-capped CsPbBr3 QDs, they have a PL lifetime of 13.3, 9.4, 9.8, 9.3, 13.3, and 20.4 ns, respectively, and these values are consistent with the earlier report of CsPbBr3 PNCs.16
The crystal structure of CsPbBr3 PNCs was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1c. As-prepared CsPbBr3 PNCs possess a cubic structure (JCPDS No. 54-0752), demonstrating that crystalline CsPbBr3 PNCs can be formed at room temperature. The XRD peaks located at 2θ = 15.3°, 20.9° and 31.0° can be assigned to the diffractions from (100), (110), and (200) planes, respectively. The chemical composition of CsPbBr3 PNCs was determined by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), as shown in Fig. 1d. CsPbBr3 PNCs have a Cs/Pb/Br molar ratio of 1.00:1.07:3.23, which is close to 1:1:3 stoichiometry. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine the morphology and the particle size of CsPbBr3 PNCs, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. Oleic acid-capped CsPbBr3 PNCs have an average size of 7.8 nm and a narrow size distribution (Fig. 2c). A high-resolution TEM image of CsPbBr3 PNCs (Fig. 2b) revealed high crystallinity with a lattice spacing of 0.295 nm, which is very close to that of the (200) plane measured by XRD (0.297 nm). The nanoparticle morphology of CsPbBr3 PNCs was further confirmed using the 3D atomic force microscopy (AFM) image, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

Although highly luminescent CsPbBr3 PNCs have been successfully synthesized by a hot-injection approach in the literature, only a small amount of CsPbBr3 PNCs was produced.16–19 Since our CsPbBr3 PNCs were prepared at room temperature in open air for only 10 s, this facile synthetic procedure can be readily extended to a gram level. ∼1.0 L of the crude solution of CsPbBr3 PNCs can be obtained in one batch, containing ∼1.0 g of CsPbBr3 PNCs. Optical characterization indicated that these large-scale CsPbBr3 PNCs are of high optical quality and have a PLQY of up to 78%, which is close to that of the best small-scale CsPbBr3 PNCs (85%), confirming that our synthetic process is very simple and highly reproducible. Fig. 3a and b present a comparison of large-scale and small-scale CsPbBr3 PNC solutions under normal indoor light (a) and UV light (b) illumination. TEM observations show that large-scale CsPbBr3 PNCs have an average size of 8.4 nm and a narrow size distribution, as shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. S7 (ESI†). The HR-TEM image (Fig. 3c, inset) revealed that large-scale CsPbBr3 PNCs were single crystalline.

The optical band gap of quantum dots can be adjusted by changing their sizes and/or tuning their compositions.16 Because the PLQYs, emission peak positions, and emission spectral widths of quantum dots are highly dependent on their sizes and size distributions, varying the chemical compositions of the quantum dots is more feasible to adjust the band gaps of the quantum dots, especially for CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs. The emission peak positions of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs can be finely controlled in a wide range of 410–700 nm by a simple anion post-exchange reaction.17,18 Once the highly luminescent CsPbBr3 PNCs are obtained, high quality alloyed CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs with full color emission can be easily synthesized by substituting Br− ions with Cl− or I− ions. Upon the addition of tetrabutylammonium chloride or tetrabutylammonium iodide to the crude solution of CsPbBr3 PNCs, a continual blue shift or a red shift of the PL peak position was observed, indicating that Br− ions in CsPbBr3 PNCs were gradually replaced by Cl− or I− ions, which leads to a series of tunable PL in the range of 440–682 nm, as shown in Fig. 4. FWHMs of the photoluminescence of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs are very narrow (12–34 nm), and their PLQYs are 50–85% relative to coumarin 6 in ethanol (QY = 78%). Alloyed CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) PNCs were confirmed using their XRD patterns and elemental analyses, as shown in Fig. S8 and Table S1 (ESI†).

The chemical and thermal stability of PNCs is critically important for their long-term applications. Although the lead halide-based perovskites exhibit excellent optical properties, they can be rapidly degraded by water, methanol, and ethanol.38 The main challenge of PNCs is their low stability in the presence of moisture. To evaluate the stability of CsPbBr3 PNCs, the PL spectra were recorded for the crude solution of oleic acid-capped CsPbBr3 PNCs which was stored under ambient moisture conditions (RH ≈ 40–60%). It was found that the PL intensity of CsPbBr3 PNCs shows a maximum value after one day air storage, which is 10–20% improvement with respect to that of as-prepared PNCs (see Fig. 5a). This enhancement is probably due to the molecular adsorption of water on the surface of CsPbBr3 PNCs by the formation of perovskite hydrate, which can effectively passivate the surface defects and improve the PLQY of PNCs. This observation is consistent with the recent report.39 Snaith et al. found that the moisture can significantly improve the PLQY of the CH3NH3PbX3 thin film by passivating the defects at the grain boundaries.39 Nevertheless, a gradual decrease in the PL intensity was observed when further prolonging the storage time, which is mainly associated with the gradual settlement of PNCs at the bottom of the bottle. These aggregated CsPbBr3 PNCs cannot be re-dispersed, but they still exhibit strong photoluminescence under UV light illumination, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Finally, the temperature-dependent PL properties of the CsPbBr3 PNC thin film were investigated. The CsPbBr3 PNC thin film was deposited by spin-casting a purified CsPbBr3 PNC solution. Temperature-dependent PL spectra were monitored using a CCD-based fiber optic spectrometer in air at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The CsPbBr3 PNC thin film shows a continual decrease in PL intensity as the temperature increases (see Fig. 5b), whereas the PL peak positions remain almost unchanged, which is different from those of group II–VI QDs. After three heating/cooling cycles, the PL intensity of the CsPbBr3 PNC thin film shows a 24% decrease.

In summary, we report a room-temperature synthetic strategy for preparing highly luminescent CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite quantum dots. CsPbBr3 PNCs were synthesized by a homogeneous reaction in a variety of nonpolar organic solvents by using cesium(I) and lead(II) fatty acid salts as well as quaternary ammonium bromides as the precursors. All the experimental procedures are conducted in open air, and our approach can be readily extended to a gram level. As-prepared CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals exhibit tunable photoluminescence in the range of 440 nm to 682 nm and high photoluminescence quantum yields of 50–85%. These high quality CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals could have high potential as emitters in light-emitting diodes.
