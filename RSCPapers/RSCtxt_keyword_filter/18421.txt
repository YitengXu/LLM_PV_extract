    , Accepted 23rd September 2016First published on 23rd September 2016AbstractWe studied fullerene-free organic solar cells based on electron-donating (BDT3TR) and -accepting (O-IDTBR) small molecules. Bulk heterojunction devices comprising BDT3TR:O-IDTBR showed an excellent power conversion efficiency exceeding 7% and much better thermal stability than BDT3TR:PC70BM devices after ageing at 120 °C for 300 hours.
Non-fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have been extensively studied to replace phenyl-C60 (or C70) butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM or PC70BM) with electron-accepting small molecules (SMs).1–9 Fullerenes are considered to be the best electron acceptors for use in BHJ-type OPVs because they provide a high electron mobility, facilitate three-dimensional electron transfer, and easily form a bicontinuous nanomorphology with electron donors.10–15 However, they are expensive, provide weak absorption over the solar radiation spectrum, and gradually lead to phase separation in blend films due to the highly different surface energy between the donors and acceptors.16 In efforts to enhance the thermal and long-term stabilities, a variety of electron-accepting organic materials containing several electron withdrawing end groups such as perylene diimide (PDI),8,17–23 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),24–29 naphthalene diimide (NDI),30 dicyanovinyl,31–33 and rhodanine34–36 moieties with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 5% have been studied. Zhan et al. reported a PCE of 9.6% for the blend film devices of the PDBT-T1 polymer:ITIC-Th acceptor.37 Hou et al. showed further enhancement in the PCE of over 11% using PBDB-T as a polymer donor and ITIC as a small molecule acceptor.38 Holliday et al. reported a PCE of 6.4% based on a P3HT donor with a rhodanine terminated acceptor (O-IDTBR).36 In contrast to the high efficiencies of polymer donor-based non-fullerene solar cells, the highest PCE of all-small molecule solar cells remains at around 6%.39–46 However, all-small molecule solar cells offer a unique advantage of high reproducibility without batch-to-batch variation or molecular weight distribution,47,48 and thus research toward a breakthrough in the efficiency is necessary.
The introduction of an electron-withdrawing rhodanine end group into a small molecule donor has shown excellent photovoltaic performance of more than 9% in fullerene-based solar cells.49–52 In light of this, we studied the possibility of an all-rhodanine terminated small molecule donor and acceptor system for high efficiency fullerene-free solar cells in the present study.
As shown in Fig. 1, as a rhodanine donor, we synthesized the (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-(((4,4′,4′′,8,8′,8′′-hexakis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-[2,2′:6′,2′′-terbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene]-6,6′′-diyl)bis(3,3′′-dioctyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5′′,5-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (BDT3TR) small molecule, which was recently reported to provide a PCE of over 7% in fullerene-based devices.53 As a rhodanine acceptor, O-IDTBR, reported by Holliday et al.,36 was synthesized and used. The combination of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR showed complementary absorption in blend film states and ideal energy level matching. Thus, the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices showed a promising PCE of 7.09%, which is comparable with that of BDT3TR:PC70BM devices (PCE = 7.14%). More importantly, BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices have shown much better thermal stability than BDT3TR:PC70BM devices. The photovoltaic J–V characteristics and thermal stabilities were investigated and discussed in terms of the molecular structure, orientation, and morphology of the blended film.

BDT3TR and O-IDTBR were synthesized according to the synthetic routes described in Scheme S1,† and the detailed procedures are summarized in the ESI.† Compounds 5 and 6 were obtained via Stille coupling of distannylated compounds 151 and 2 with monobrominated compounds 334 and 4,54 respectively. The final small molecules, O-IDTBR and BDT3TR, were successfully synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of the rhodanine and dialdehyde compounds (5 and 6), respectively. Both small molecules displayed excellent solubility in common organic solvents (e.g., toluene, THF and chloroform).
The absorption spectra of the small molecules were measured in chloroform solutions and in films (Fig. 2), and their properties are summarized in Table S1.† The absorption maxima of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR were 505 and 664 nm in solution, respectively, and 572 and 689 nm in films, respectively. The O-IDTBR acceptor exhibited highly red-shifted absorption spectra compared to the BDT3TR donor because the difference in the donor–acceptor strength in O-IDTBR containing an electron withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit is much larger than that in BDT3TR composed of electron donating moieties, BDT and thiophene. The absorption onsets of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR in the film state were observed at 681 and 785 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.82 and 1.57 eV, respectively. The significant differences in the absorption coverage and the bandgap of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR are advantageous for solar radiation harvesting because the compounds provide complementary absorption properties.55

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (ECVHOMO) and lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (ECVLUMO) of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR were verified using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements based on the oxidation and reduction onset potentials relative to ferrocene as an internal standard,56 respectively, and their cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 3(a). The ECVHOMO values of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR were calculated to be −5.10 and −5.46 eV, respectively, and the ECVLUMO value of O-IDTBR was −3.62 eV. Unfortunately, the reduction potential of BDT3TR could not be measured using the CV method. Thus, the LUMO energy levels (EOptLUMO) of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR, calculated from ECVHOMO and the optical bandgap, were determined to be −3.28 and −3.89 eV, respectively. O-IDTBR showed much deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels than BDT3TR because O-IDTBR has both electron withdrawing rhodanine and BT moieties. As shown in Fig. 3(b), differences in the energy levels of BDT3TR and O-IDTBR were considered to be sufficient to stabilize charge separation and transport in photovoltaic devices.57 The high-lying LUMO energy levels of O-IDTBR compared to those of PC70BM are expected to yield a high open circuit voltage (VOC) in photovoltaic devices.58

Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated in the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDT3TR:O-IDTBR/ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)/CPE/Al. The detailed experiments on the top electrodes are shown in Fig. S1–S3 and Tables S3–S5.† The current (J)–voltage (V) characteristics and the corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR blend films are shown in Fig. 4, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables 1 and S2.† The BDT3TR:O-IDTBR device was optimized by integrating ZnO and poly(9,9-bis(6′-N,N,N-trimethylammonium-hexyl) fluorine phenylene) bromide (conjugated polyelectrolyte, CPE), which improve the electron injection and transport to the cathode from the photo-active layer (BDT3TR:O-IDTBR).59 The energy diagram of the photovoltaic devices is presented in Fig. 3(b). In the Ca/Al system, the energy level (−4.3 eV) is not matched with that of O-IDTBR (−3.89 eV), implying S-shaped characteristics in the J–V curve, which leads to decreased solar cell efficiency. ZnO/Al also has similar energy levels (−4.3 eV). As a result, the PCE is obtained as 5.35% for Ca/Al and 5.70% for ZnO/Al (Fig. S1 and Table S3†). However, when a cationic CPE is applied under the Al electrode, the work function of Al is up-shifted by the interfacial dipole of the CPE layer as shown in Fig. 3(b),60 approaching the LUMO energy level of the O-IDTBR acceptor, resulting in better electron transport and enhancement of the PCE up to 6.51% (Fig. S2 and Table S4†). In addition, ZnO NPs are introduced as a hole blocking layer to prevent charge recombination. The ZnO/CPE/Al facilitates electron injection and transport by reducing the energy barrier between the cathode and the photo-active layer (BDT3TR:O-IDTBR), and thus the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices exhibited the highest PCE, 7.09%, with a VOC of 1.06 V, a JSC of 12.10 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56% (Fig. 4(b)). It should be noted that the obtained PCE is similar to that of fullerene based devices (BDT3TR:PC70BM, PCE = 7.14%).51 BDT3TR:O-IDTBR showed a much higher VOC of 1.06 V than the BDT3TR:PC70BM devices (VOC = 0.90 V) due to the high-lying LUMO energy level of O-IDTBR (Fig. 3(b)), and the JSC of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR (12.10 mA cm−2) was even higher than that of BDT3TR:PC70BM (11.34 mA cm−2) because of the broad absorption covering a longer wavelength area in the blend film (Fig. 4(a)). Although the FF of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR was lower than that of BDT3TR:PC70BM, the overall device performance of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR was similar to that of the BDT3TR:PC70BM device.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR blend films were collected to verify the surface uniformity and morphology, and are shown in Fig. S4.† The BDT3TR:O-IDTBR film showed a highly uniform surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1 nm, indicating a well-mixed complex. The two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) patterns collected from the neat materials and blend films of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts are displayed in Fig. S8 and S9.† As shown in Fig. 5, BDT3TR showed strong edge-on orientation with an average interval of (h00) reflections along the out-of-plane (Qz) axis of 0.264 Å−1 and (010) Qxy peak at 1.70 Å−1, corresponding to a layer spacing of 23.77 Å and an intermolecular π–π distance of 3.69 Å, respectively. On the other hand, O-IDTBR exhibited strong face-on orientation, as indicated by the (010) Qz peaks at 1.81 Å−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.46 Å. In the blend films as shown in Fig. 5(b), BDT3TR:O-IDTBR showed both face-on and edge-on orientations, indicating the coexistence of vertical and parallel charge transport from the substrates. As a result, the well-mixed nanomorphology with three dimensional charge pathways of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR blend films offered excellent JSC values in OPVs.

Importantly, as shown in Fig. 4(e), when the devices are fabricated after heat treatment of the active layer at 85 °C for 50 hours, the PCEs of the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices were unchanged from the initial state, whereas those of the BDT3TR:PC70BM devices gradually decreased. This indicates that the active layer of BDT3TR:PC70BM is quite unstable under hot conditions, which is a serious problem for commercialization, while the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR blend films have excellent thermal stability. From the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of O-IDTBR and PC70BM, we found that O-IDTBR and PC70BM did not show any significant thermal motion at around 80–100 °C (Fig. S11†). Thus, we speculated that the thermal stability of the active layer is mainly caused by the mixing stability of the donor and acceptor. Thus, we measured AFM images of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR and BDT3TR:PC70BM blend films after heating at 85 °C for 50 hours (Fig. S5†). After 50 hours, BDT3TR:PC70BM started to show phase separation. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the BDT3TR:PC70BM film increased from 0.35 nm to 0.43 nm. In contrast, the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR film showed a similar surface morphology before and after heating, and the RMS roughness of the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR film was not changed. It is believed that the stronger intermolecular interaction between BDT3TR and O-IDTBR led to better thermal stability of the blend films by suppressing the thermal motion. The enhanced thermal stability of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR blend films directly affected the stability of the complete devices. As shown in Fig. 4(f), after heat treatment of the devices at 120 °C for 300 hours, the BDT3TR:PC70BM devices showed a severe efficiency drop, as indicated by the approximately 60% drop in the PCE, whereas the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices exhibited much stronger thermal durability (30% decline of the PCE). We surmise that the strong intermolecular interaction between conjugated backbones stabilizes the interfaces and morphology of the blend films, and mitigates kinetic motions at high temperatures, resulting in higher thermal stability of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices.
Conclusions
We studied all-small molecule solar cells based on a rhodanine terminated BDT3TR donor and an O-IDTBR acceptor. The BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices exhibited a promising PCE of 7.09% with a VOC of 1.06 V, a JSC of 12.10 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56% mainly due to the complementary absorption between BDT3TR and O-IDTBR, as well as the high-lying LUMO level of O-IDTBR (−3.89 eV) compared to that of PC70BM (−4.1 eV). To our knowledge, this is the first report of fullerene-free and all-small molecule BHJ solar cells with a PCE >7%. Importantly, the BDT3TR:O-IDTBR devices showed much higher thermal stability than the BDT3TR:PC70BM devices, which is one of the important advantages of non-fullerene acceptors. Currently, we are studying several rhodanine terminated donors and acceptors to reveal the effect of the rhodanine end groups on the photovoltaic properties and stabilities of non-fullerene solar cells.
Experimental
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
In order to fabricate the all-rhodanine terminated small molecule solar cells with the conventional architecture, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photo-active layer/top electrode, the ITO glass was first cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each and subsequently dried in an oven for 5 h. Then thin PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) as a hole transport layer was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrate and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min in air. For deposition of the active layer, blending solution of BDT3TR:O-IDTBR (1.0:1.0 w/w) dissolved in chloroform was spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. ZnO NPs61–63 as an electron transport layer were spin-coated (3000 rpm, 50 s) on top of a photo-active layer. Then the PFQ-Br (1-Material, OS0364), a conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE), with a concentration of 0.02 wt% dissolved in methanol was spin-coated (4000 rpm, 30 s) on the ZnO NP layer. The thicknesses of the ZnO NPs and CPE layer are ∼30 nm and ∼10 nm, respectively. Aluminium contact was formed by vacuum deposition at pressures below 3 × 10−6 Torr, providing an active layer of 0.09 cm2. The thermal stability of the devices was measured under heating at 120 °C in N2. Solar cell efficiencies were characterized under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G irradiation from a Xe arc lamp with an AM 1.5 global filter. Simulator irradiance was characterized using a calibrated spectrometer, and the illumination intensity was set using an NREL-certified silicon diode with an integrated KG1 optical filter. The EQE was measured by underfilling the device area using a reflective microscope objective to focus the light output from a 100 W halogen lamp outfitted with a monochromator and an optical chopper; the photocurrent was measured using a lock-in amplifier, and the absolute photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode. All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
