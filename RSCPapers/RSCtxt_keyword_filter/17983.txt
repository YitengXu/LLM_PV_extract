    , Accepted 27th October 2016First published on 27th October 2016AbstractOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with TiO2-based architectures have emerged for highly efficient photovoltaic conversion in recent years, while their serious light soaking instability limits their practical applications. Here, we have successfully introduced fullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(methyl)-amino)-ethyl ester (PCBDAN) as an interfacial modifier for the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) in planar PSCs, which can significantly improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency and light soaking stability of the devices. The quality of the perovskite film and electron extraction efficiency between the perovskite and ETL are both improved by introducing the PCBDAN interfacial layer. An improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.78% can be obtained for the device with PCBDAN under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). And the light soaking stability of the planar device is greatly improved after modification. This work provides a feasible way by interfacial modification for the realization of highly efficient devices without light-soaking degradation.
1. Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into electricity with photovoltaic devices offers a sustainable and environmental solution to meet the increasing energy demand.1,2 Recently, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn enormous attention due to their boosting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and low manufacture cost.3–10 A certified efficiency of 22.1% has been achieved and a theoretical limit of 31% is predicted for PSCs according to the photon recycling effect.11,12 Typically, PSCs with mesoscopic architectures are composed of an electron transport layer (ETL) of compact TiO2 film, an ∼150 nm TiO2 scaffold, a perovskite absorption layer and a hole transport layer (HTL) of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,90-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Compared to the mesoscopic structure which needs twice annealing processes, N–I–P planar PSCs without a TiO2 scaffold exhibit considerable advantages with versatile fabrication processes, simple device architectures and respectable PCEs above 19%.13,14 Alternatively, the novel solution-processed organic ETLs are reported to replace TiO2 in planar PSCs for improving their optoelectronic properties, low-temperature fabrication processes and fast electron extraction properties.15,16
However, PSCs exhibit reduced stability of photovoltaic performances under UV light illumination, even though they were encapsulated from air conditions.17–21 It is urgent to understand and solve the underlying mechanism of device instability. It has been reported that this degradation of perovskite photovoltaic devices is dominantly related to the changes occurring in the TiO2 layers. Snaith et al. have reported that deep traps are caused by oxygen vacancies at the surface of TiO2 under UV light illumination and lead to the recombination loss of photo-generated charges.21 On the other hand, the strong oxidative photon-generated holes in TiO2 can react with I ions from bulk CH3NH3PbI3, resulting in the degradation of perovskite thin films.22 As a result, PSCs show severe instability, low photovoltaic performance and an anomalous hysteresis phenomenon in J–V curves. To solve the instability problem of PSCs, some important research studies have focused on the interfacial modification between the perovskite and TiO2 for improving the device stability or/and performances, including inorganic materials like CsBr22 and Sb2S3 (ref. 23) and organic materials like self-assembled monolayer fullerene C60-SAM.24 However, Sb2S3 itself is not stable under air conditions even though it can improve the device performance.23 The CsBr interfacial modifier cannot effectively eliminate the hysteresis phenomenon of PSCs.22 For the C60-SAM modifier, it takes over 24 hours for the anchoring which is inconvenient for future mass production.24 Thus, a more powerful interfacial modifier is still needed to be explored for PSCs, not only for enhancing photovoltaic performance, but also for improving the device stability and suppressing the hysteresis phenomenon.
Recently, fullerene derivatives have not been used to modify TiO2 in perovskite solar cells, like C60-SAM,24 [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)25 and PCBB-2CN-2CB.26 These materials have been reported to effectively improve the device performance and suppress the hysteresis behavior. In this work, a novel amine-based fullerene derivative of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(methyl)-amino)-ethyl ester (PCBDAN)27–30 is introduced as an interfacial modifier between the TiO2 and perovskite layers for the first time. The PCBDAN interfacial layer can effectively control the grain nucleation and therefore improve the quality of perovskite films. Furthermore, it can also reduce the interfacial barrier of TiO2/perovskite layers and enhance the electron extraction efficiency. More importantly, the PCBDAN can suppress the photocatalytic capability of TiO2, and therefore the solar cells show improved light-soaking stability.
2. Experimental section
Substrate preparation
F-Doped SnO2 glass (FTO, NSG, TEC-8) was etched with 2 mol L−1 HCl and zinc powder. Then it was cleaned sequentially with Hellmanex™ detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath. The FTO was dried with N2 flow and cleaned in a UV-ozone cleaner for 30 min. An electron extraction layer (ETL) of compact TiO2 was deposited on the clean FTO glass by spray pyrolysis with 0.4 M Ti(IV) bis(ethylacetoacetal)-diisopropoxide in ethanol solution, which was then annealed in air at 550 °C for 60 min and kept at 150 °C before use. The PCBDAN interfacial modification layer was prepared by spin-coating a PCBDAN solution with a concentration of 0–3 mg mL−1 in CB, at 2000 rpm for 45 s, and then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min to remove the solvent.
Device fabrication
Methylammonium iodide (MAI) paste was synthesized according to the method described elsewhere. The perovskite films were formed on the ETL with a stoichiometric precursor solution by a one-step spin-coating procedure. The precursor solution was prepared with 461 mg PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 159 mg MAI in DMF/DMSO hybrid solvent. Then, the perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the ETL at 1000 rpm for 5 seconds and 5000 rpm for another 20 seconds, and 0.6 mL of anti-solvent diethyl ether was drop-casted on the substrate after this length of time. After spinning, the films were dried at 70 °C for 1 min and then crystallized at 100 °C for 10 min. A solution of spiro-oMeTAD was prepared by dissolving 72.25 mg of spiro-oMeTAD, 28.75 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. And the hole transport layer was formed by spin coating 20 μL of this spiro-oMeTAD solution at 3000 rpm for 45 s. Finally, 120 nm of Au was thermally evaporated as an electrode through a shadow mask. The cell area is defined as 0.10 cm2.
Device characterization
The work function was measured by using a Kelvin probe digital control unit system (KP Tech.) with an Owon smart oscilloscope (DS5032EV). The AFM images were taken in tapping mode with an Atomic Force Microscope (Bruker Dimension Edge). XRD patterns were characterized by X-ray diffraction powder diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), 40 mA and 40 mV. Optical absorbance spectroscopy was performed on a spectrophotometer (UV4100, HITACH, Chiyoda-ku, Japan) in the wavelength range from 300 to 850 nm. Surface and cross-section morphologies were investigated with a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, HITACH-S4800). Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL decay spectra were measured with a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments), where the excitation wavelength was 325 nm and detected in the wavelength range from 600 to 850 nm with 10 nm increments. Time-resolved PL decay measurements were performed using a 325 nm laser head and monitored at 770 nm. The photovoltaic measurements of current density–voltage (J–V) curves were carried out under AM 1.5 G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (94022A, Newport®) with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was adjusted with a standard Si solar cell (PVM937, Newport®). When measuring, a delay of time of 100 ms was fixed with different scan directions. The sweeping rate was 10 mV per step. The EQE of solar cells was measured by using an EQE measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurement, Inc.) across a wavelength range from 300 to 900 nm. The steady-state test was performed under a constant bias voltage of the maximum power output for 100 s. For the UV light soaking test, the perovskite solar cells or perovskite thin films were characterized under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) from the FTO side for different time periods. Meanwhile, the perovskite thin films were illuminated under a xenon lamp (300 mW cm−2) for XRD and absorption measurements for 10 hours.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic structure of planar hetero-junction PSCs with a PCBDAN interfacial modifier between the TiO2 and perovskite layers. The device is composed of glass/FTO, compact TiO2 (∼40 nm), a PCBDAN layer, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite (450 nm), spiro-oMeTAD (180 nm) and an Au electrode (80 nm) from bottom to top. The corresponding energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 1b. Note that the work function of TiO2 becomes smaller from 4.21 to 3.93 eV due to PCBDAN modification, which has been clarified by Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) measurements as shown in Table S1.† On the other hand, the electron extraction is more efficient from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, 3.9 eV) of MAPbI3 to the conduction band of TiO2, compared to that in the planar device without PCBDAN. Generally, the solubility of the interfacial modifier in orthogonal solvents is the precondition to form its film in the multi-layer structure of PSCs.25,31–33 Here, it should be noted that the stability of the interfacial modifier against the dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent is very important, which is usually used for perovskite materials. For instance, the interfacial modifier layer like PCBM is soluble in DMF solvent and cannot be utilized since it is easily damaged in the following process of perovskite films. Fig. 1c shows the solubility of PCBDAN in DMF and chlorobenzene (CB), which are common solvents. It can be seen that the PCBDAN is almost insoluble in DMF, while it is highly soluble in CB. This result indicates that the PCBDAN solution in CB can be used for the PSC fabrication, without worrying about its dissolution in the following fabrication step of the perovskite layer. After the modification of PCBDAN, the substrate in Fig. S1† demonstrated a decreased surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness from 27.7 nm to 27 nm (Fig. S2†) which is also beneficial for the formation of flat perovskite layers.

The introduction of the PCBDAN interfacial modifier can have strong influence on the formation of perovskite films in the fabrication of PSCs. Fig. 2a and b show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) plane-view micrographs of perovskite films on the TiO2 films with and without PCBDAN modification, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the average grain size of the perovskite film on the TiO2 film is 178.43 nm, which is consistent with those reported previously.5,32 However, the average grain size of the perovskite film on the PCBDAN modified TiO2 film (TiO2/PCBDAN) is 345.5 nm. Moreover, the surface RMS roughness of the perovskite film decreases from 18.9 nm to 9.9 nm due to the PCBDAN modification on the TiO2, as shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 2c and d show the SEM cross-sectional micrographs of PSCs with and without PCBDAN, respectively. It is clearly clarified again that a larger grain-sized perovskite layer has been formed in the modified devices. Here, we should mention that the surface contact angle of the polar solvent (DMF) on the hydrophobic PCBDAN is 110°, much larger than that on the TiO2 (28°), as shown in Fig. S3.† This leads us to deduce that the significant increase of the surface contact angle could cause less anchoring effect for the perovskite crystallization process and therefore result in larger grain-sized perovskite films. Nevertheless, the formation of large-sized grains for perovskite films must effectively reduce the density of grain boundaries (GBs) in perovskite films, which are active recombination centers for carriers and therefore benefit the performance improvement.35–37

Fig. 3a shows the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of perovskite films on TiO2 with and without PCBDAN. The absorption intensities are almost the same except for the small difference in the wavelength range below 500 nm, where they are slightly enhanced by PCBDAN modification. Since the thicknesses of the perovskite films are identical as confirmed by the SEM images in Fig. 2c and d, we suppose that this slight absorption enhancement at short wavelengths originates from the PCBDAN. Urbach energies (Eμ), a sign of the band tail of perovskite thin films, are also analyzed to discuss the levels of energetic disorder in bulk perovskites.38–40Fig. 3b shows the exponential relationship of absorbance (α) versus photon energy (E). The Eμ (inset in Fig. 3b) can be obtained by fitting the curves with the following formula: α = α0exp(E/Eμ)(1)where α0 is an absorption constant related to the thickness of perovskite films. In contrast to Eμ with an average value of 16.50 meV for the perovskite on TiO2, a lower Eμ with an average value of 10.84 meV for the perovskite on the TiO2/PCBDAN is obtained. The decrease of Eμ actually reflects relatively low levels of energetic disorder, which should be attributed to the reduction of GB density in large-sized perovskite films on the TiO2/PCBDAN. The electron extraction behaviors between the perovskite and TiO2 ETL layers after PCBDAN modification are investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. Fig. 3c shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite thin films on TiO2 and TiO2/PCBDAN. Generally, perovskite films with larger grain size should generate higher PL intensity due to the reduced non-radiative recombination loss.36,41 However, the PL intensity of the perovskite on TiO2/PCBDAN is almost half that on TiO2. It has been reported that PCBDAN is a strong electron acceptor and possesses faster electron mobility than TiO2.7,42 Therefore, PCBDAN provides fast electron transport channels at the interface between the perovskite and TiO2, resulting in significant quenching of PL intensity. Furthermore, time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay behaviors are characterized in a 770 nm emission window. We have fitted the TRPL curves to quantify the characteristic parameters of time constants with a bi-exponential decay function, I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + y0(2)where τ1 represents fast decay from quenching of free carriers in the perovskite to the ETL and τ2 represents the slow decay process from radiative decay.35,43 The derived data are summarized in Table S2.† It indicates that the charge transfer is the dominating decay mechanism. The values of τ1 (1.76 ns) and τ2 (21.96 ns) for the perovskite on TiO2/PCBDAN are both shorter than those for the perovskite on TiO2 (τ1 = 3.12 ns, τ2 = 34.3 ns). The smaller τ1 reflects less trap charge recombination and faster carrier extraction efficiency at the interface due to the introduction of the PCBDAN modifier. However, it seems that the smaller τ2 could be a result of complex effects from bulk perovskites or/and interface electronic coupling.26,33

Photovoltaic performance
To verify the effect of PCBDAN modification on the photovoltaic performances, we fabricate planar PSCs using different concentrations of PCBDAN. The statistics of photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S4.† It can be seen that the optimized PCBDAN concentration is 1.5 mg mL−1 which helps achieve the highest photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs. We then systematically investigate the photovoltaic performance and hysteresis phenomenon of various PSCs with different scan directions and voltage delay times which are very sensitive to the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices.17,34 The J–V curves of various champion devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. The device without PCBDAN modification has a PCE of 13.64%, with a Voc of 1.01 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.95 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 67.69% in the forward direction (from 1.4 to 0 V). After PCBDAN modification, the device shows a much higher PCE of 16.78%, with a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 21.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.05% in the same direction. As it has been mentioned above, the improvement of Jsc originates from sufficient electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL with PCBDAN, which has a 4-fold electron mobility of PCBM (2.92 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).29,30 The improvement of Voc mainly comes from the energy offset of TiO2 with PCBDAN modification from 4.2 to 3.93 eV, and meanwhile the higher quality of perovskite films with decrease of Eμ corresponds to the smaller loss of Voc on TiO2/PCBDAN than that on the TiO2 ETL.43 The high quality of perovskites with large and homogeneous grain size can decrease the bulk recombination which accounts for the improved FF. The hysteresis effect is a very complex issue for perovskite solar cells which influences the accurate evaluation of the photovoltaic efficiency of devices.17,44 It is dependent on many factors, including device structures, filming technologies and measurement conditions.25,26,45 In Fig. 4a, the device with bare TiO2 presents obvious hysteresis. The values of Voc, Jsc and FF are reduced to 1.00 V, 18.33 mA cm−2 and 48.56% in the reverse direction (from 0 V to 1.4 V), respectively, which results in a PCE of 8.90%. We suppose that such enormous hysteresis is caused by the large amount of trap states at the TiO2 surface, which leads to a large deviation of efficiency in different scan directions.25 However, the hysteresis of the device is significantly suppressed due to the PCBDAN modification, and the PCE becomes 15.99% in the reverse direction. To some extent, fullerene derivatives have been reported to passivate the bulk trap states in perovskites and thus suppress or eliminate hysteresis behaviors.18,46 Our interfacial strategy profits the direct contact between the perovskite and PCBDAN, which can also allow the effective passivation for bulk traps. Moreover, the details of J–V testing method such as sweeping rate and voltage range will also affect the hysteresis of the device.25,26 Here, the voltage range was from 1.4 to 0 V or 0 to 1.4 V, the decay time was 100 ms and the sweeping rate was 10 mV per step. The J–V curves with different delay times (30, 50, 100 and 200 ms) are shown in Fig. S5;† the long delay time (200 ms) leads to a slight change of Jsc. It is believed that the interfacial trap state is effectively passivated by PCBDAN modification and thus the hysteresis effect is effectively suppressed.

Furthermore, we test the best device with PCBDAN modification under steady-state conditions for 100 s with a bias voltage of 0.895 V under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, as shown in Fig. 4b. The stabilized PCE is 16.3%, which is quite close to the performance in J–V curves. However, it can be obviously seen that the Jsc of the control device is relatively smaller than that from the J–V test (Fig. S6†). Fig. 4c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices with and without PCBDAN. The EQE of the device is significantly improved in the whole range from 300 to 850 nm, and the corresponding integrated Jsc increased from 16.1 to 20.1 mA cm−2, due to the PCBDAN modification. Note that the integrated Jsc from EQE for the planar PSC without PCBDAN modification is obviously smaller than that obtained from the J–V curve in the forward direction because of the existing hysteresis effect. Fig. 4d shows the statistical histogram of the PCEs from 70 PSCs. It shows that 50% of the devices with PCBDAN modification deliver a PCE over 15.5%, compared with 12.5% for the devices without PCBDAN. This result strongly highlights the reproducibility of device efficiency enhancement with PCBDAN modification.
Light soaking stability of PSCs
Stability is another key issue for PSCs, which determines their commercial feasibility.47,48 Therefore, the stability of our PSCs is investigated under light soaking conditions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the perovskite materials on TiO2 and TiO2/PCBDAN ETL are shown in Fig. 5a. Before light soaking, the weak peak located at 12.6° is the diffraction peak of PbI2 formed during the perovskite filming process under air conditions for both kinds of samples. After light soaking, it can be seen that the intensity of the PbI2 peak increases largely for the perovskite on TiO2, which means serious decomposition of the perovskite film on TiO2. As mentioned above, this UV-induced photocatalytic decomposition of the perovskite from the TiO2 side can generate a large number of defects, resulting in a fast drop of the photovoltaic performance.22 However, the intensity of the PbI2 peak almost remains constant for the perovskite on TiO2/PCBDAN. This strongly indicates that the PCBDAN can effectively passivate or eliminate the trap states at the TiO2 surface25 and suppress the decomposition of the perovskite film. Correspondingly, this degradation process can also be monitored by the absorption spectra of the perovskite film. The normalized absorption intensities of the perovskite film at 600 nm are shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that the absorption intensity of the perovskite on bare FTO maintains 98% of its initial value, which means that no degradation is caused by light in the absence of TiO2. For the perovskite on TiO2, the absorption intensity decreases to 80% of its initial value, but it can maintain 97.5% on TiO2/PCBDAN, both of which are consistent with the previous XRD analysis. It can also be seen that the absorption intensity of FTO/perovskite/PMMA and FTO/PCBDAN/perovskite/PMMA samples remains constant under light soaking in the case of the TiO2 being absent. Thus, we conclude that the decomposition of the perovskite in light soaking is related to the TiO2 and suppressed by PCBDAN modification. Furthermore, the light-soaking stability of PSCs without encapsulation under air conditions under AM 1.5 G illumination has been evaluated. Fig. 6a–d represent the evolution of PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF, respectively. It can be seen that the device with TiO2/PCBDAN shows much higher stability than the device with bare TiO2. The PCE of the device with bare TiO2 rapidly drops to 50% of its initial value after light soaking for 20 min, but that of the one with TiO2/PCBDAN only drops by 10%. The other photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc and FF show the same tendency. As illustrated in the XRD spectra and normalized absorption spectra, it can be concluded that the improved stability of the device with TiO2/PCBDAN mainly originates from the reduced trap states of TiO2 and suppressed decomposition of the perovskite, while the origin of the fast drop of photovoltaic performance caused by the decomposition of perovskite can't be found obviously in a short time from XRD spectra. However, it will electrically cause a lot of traps and affect the device stability.21 These traps will lead to the degradation of the perovskite and result in the fast drop of device performance.26 Thus the control device demonstrates the fast decrease of FF in the initial period under light soaking. It must be pointed out that the performances of the device with TiO2/PCBDAN also show certain degradation in a relatively humid atmosphere. We think that this instability of the devices with TiO2/PCBDAN should mainly originate from the degradation of the spiro-oMeTAD hole transport layer due to the oxidation or loss of additives (LiTFSI and tBP) under air conditions.49,50 In order to further verify the stability of the PSCs with PCBDAN modification, the devices have been encapsulated using ultraviolet curable adhesives for long-time light soaking tests. The encapsulated device almost maintains 85% of its initial efficiency, as shown in Fig. S8.† This strongly suggests that the PCBDAN modification can significantly improve the stability of the devices under long-term light soaking conditions.

4. Conclusions
We have successfully used PCBDAN as a novel interfacial modifier for the ETL in planar PSCs, which can promote photovoltaic performance, suppress hysteresis and improve light soaking stability of the devices. Smoother and larger grain-sized perovskite films are obtained on the TiO2/PCBDAN ETL than on TiO2. With PCBDAN modification, carrier extraction accelerates and interfacial recombination reduces, resulting in above 23% improvement of PSCs in efficiency. We demonstrate the devices with high efficiency over 16% and good light soaking stability. These results provide a simple process with PCBDAN interfacial modification for the realization of PSCs for future applications.
