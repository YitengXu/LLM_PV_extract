    , Accepted 14th September 2017First published on 14th September 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) usually suffer from a hysteresis effect in current–voltage measurements, which leads to an inaccurate estimation of the device efficiency. Although ion migration, charge trapping/detrapping, and accumulation have been proposed as a basis for the hysteresis, the origin of the hysteresis has not been apparently unraveled. Herein we reported a tunable hysteresis effect based uniquely on open-circuit voltage variations in printable mesoscopic PSCs with a simplified triple-layer TiO2/ZrO2/carbon architecture. The electrons are collected by the compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 (c-TiO2/mp-TiO2) bilayer, and the holes are collected by the carbon layer. By adjusting the spray deposition cycles for the c-TiO2 layer and UV-ozone treatment, we achieved hysteresis-normal, hysteresis-free, and hysteresis-inverted PSCs. Such unique trends of tunable hysteresis are analyzed by considering the polarization of the TiO2/perovskite interface, which can accumulate positive charges reversibly. Successfully tuning of the hysteresis effect clarifies the critical importance of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface in controlling the hysteretic trends observed, providing important insights towards the understanding of this rapidly developing photovoltaic technology.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have captured intensive attention due to their advantages of low material cost, simple fabrication process, and high efficiency. In particular, the extremely fast increase in efficiency, from 2.19% in 2006 to the current 22.1%, has enabled this photovoltaic technology to challenge the current commercialized solar cells. However, PSCs usually suffer from a hysteresis effect in current–voltage (J–V) measurements, which leads to an inaccurate estimation of the device performance. This paper reports a tunable hysteresis effect for printable mesoscopic PSCs based on a triple-layer TiO2/ZrO2/carbon architecture. By optimizing the deposition of the compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer, the normal hysteresis effect where the forward scan (from short-circuit to open-circuit) leads to a poorer device performance than the backward scan (from open-circuit to short-circuit) can be firstly eliminated, and then inverted. Interestingly, the difference of the J–V curves measured with opposite scan directions mainly lies in the open-circuit voltage, not the current density or fill factor. The results are interpreted in terms of the interaction of charge accumulation and recombination effects. The demonstration of such tunable hysteresis effect not only shows the critical importance of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface for PSCs, but also provides significant understanding of this emerging photovoltaic technology.

1. Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX3, X = halogen) and its analogues as the light absorber have rapidly developed.1–3 These perovskites have a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long diffusion length and direct band gap, which makes them ideal semiconductors for efficient photovoltaics.4–6 Besides, they are composed of earth-abundant materials and can be deposited by low-temperature solution methods, thus providing a promising prospect for applications. In the past several years, great efforts have been devoted to achieving high efficiency and developing beneficial device fabrication processes, launching the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to over 22%.7 At the same time, many attempts to understand the fundamental working principle and mechanism of PSCs have been reported,8–11 especially the current–voltage (J–V) hysteresis behavior.12–16 This hysteresis behavior has been further complicated by the emergence of an ‘inverted hysteresis’ phenomenon recently. In general, ‘normal’ hysteresis is the case where there occurs a large loss of photocurrent and fill factor (FF) during the scan from reverse voltage (R) to forward voltage (F), (also leading to a reduced open-circuit voltage, VOC), as compared to the forward to reverse scan.14 Inverted hysteresis has been observed as a reduction in the short-circuit current (JSC) for F–R scans compared to R–F scans by Shen et al.17 and Nemnes et al.18 while Tress et al.19 observed a loss in the FF in the form of an S-shaped kink for the F–R scan. Both normal and inverted hystereses trends have been observed to become more acute for faster scans.
Since the observed trends in the literature are mostly strong variations in the photocurrent, the general models employed to explain these types of hysteresis were based on variations in the collection efficiency of PSCs, which is modulated by the screening of the internal electric field by the mobile ions.14,20 Therefore, normal hysteresis was explained based on the fact that a forward bias voltage corresponded to a favorable charge extraction situation as compared to a short-circuit, while this trend is reversed for inverted hysteresis due to a possible extraction barrier at the TiO2/perovskite interface, where the accumulation of anions at short-circuit creates a dipole that facilitates band alignment and hence efficient charge extraction.19
Previously, we have developed a triple-layer architecture of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon to fabricate a hole-conductor-free printable mesoscopic PSC.21,22 By optimizing the mesoporous scaffold and perovskite absorber, hysteresis-less devices have been obtained with TiO2 as the electron transporting layer (ETL).23,24 In this study, it was found that the type of hysteresis effect in printable mesoscopic PSCs was highly dependent on the interlayer of c-TiO2. Through controlling the deposition of the c-TiO2 layer, we realized normal and inverted hysteresis effects for such printable mesoscopic PSCs. Furthermore, the observed hysteresis was uniquely different from the typical hysteresis for PSCs as detailed previously, with the main difference in the J–V curves between the forward and backward scans being the VOC, and not the JSC or FF. We analyzed the trends of such tunable hysteresis effects by considering the polarization of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface, and proposed that this phenomenon is associated with the kinetics of accumulation and recombination of ions and charges at this interface during J–V scans.
At present, there have been many reports of hysteresis-less PSCs that in some cases have been obtained by combination of excellent bulk morphologies and manipulation of the contacts, often avoiding the use of metal-oxides.13,25,26 In this work, we show that robust devices fabricated with carbon hole extraction electrodes, still show a degree of dynamic hysteresis that is completely controlled by the quality of the thin TiO2 contact layer. We relate the extent of hysteresis observed in different conditions of dynamic scans and waiting times. Remarkably, the transient effects maintain the good features of the photocurrent and the shape of the J–V curves, but affect mainly the apparent photovoltage. The results will be interpreted in terms of the interaction of charge accumulation and recombination effects, following previous observations of transient decay dependence on slow ionic kinetics.27 The analysis of photovoltage changes provides a general standpoint for understanding the operation of contacts in the perovskite-based photovoltaics.
2. Results
2.1 Device configuration and working mechanism
The device architecture used in this study is shown in Fig. 1a, where c-TiO2, mp-TiO2, ZrO2, and carbon layers are deposited on a single FTO glass substrate layer by layer as the scaffold for depositing the perovskite absorber. Typically, the three mesoporous layers have a thickness of ca. 1.0, 2.0 and 10.0 μm, respectively. A mixed-cation perovskite of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 (5-AVA = 5-ammoniumvaleric acid) is infiltrated into the three mesoporous layers as the light absorber, and no HTM layer is needed in the device. The energy band alignment of the device (Fig. 1b) demonstrates that the electron–hole pairs generated in the perovskite absorber separate by injecting an electron into mp-TiO2 and transporting the holes to the carbon back contact.22 In this process, the ZrO2 layer effectively prevents direct contact between TiO2 and the carbon layer. The c-TiO2 layer prevents the valence band holes in the perovskite from reaching the FTO-covered front electrode. With the construction of these selective contacts, the electrons generated in the perovskite absorber are effectively collected by the ETL of the mp-TiO2 and transferred to the FTO front electrode via the c-TiO2, and the holes are collected by the carbon back contact. The mp-TiO2 layer has been considered mainly responsible for the hysteresis in conventional structured PSCs.13,25 Particularly, the thickness, pore size, and treatment process of the mp-TiO2 layer have been reported to influence the hysteresis of the devices.28–30 Here, for printable mesoscopic PSCs using a 1 μm-thick mp-TiO2 layer, hysteresis-less devices have been fabricated and reported.22 We consider that the mp-TiO2 scaffold with extremely large surface area is able to provide efficient pathways for electron extraction and transportation rather than causing charge accumulation and possible hysteresis. On the contrary, for the c-TiO2 layer that blocks hole injection from the perovskite into the FTO layer, it is critical to achieve a balance between the recombination suppression and the charge carrier transportation. We have found that the properties of the c-TiO2 layer and corresponding interfaces significantly affect the J–V hysteresis in the simplified triple-layer architecture-based PSCs. For the deposition of the c-TiO2 layer, we first treated the FTO glass substrates with UV-ozone for 2.5 min, and then employed an aerosol spray pyrolysis method to prepare a c-TiO2 layer with different spraying cycles (Fig. S1, ESI†).

2.2 Hysteresis effect for printable mesoscopic PSCs
To evaluate the hysteresis effect of the devices based on a c-TiO2 layer with different spray deposition cycles, J–V curves were measured under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 sunlight at a scan rate of 250 mV s−1 in the two directions: from reverse voltage, to forward voltage, denoted R–F, and in the backward scan direction, from forward bias to reverse bias, denoted F–R. Note that the scan direction is indicated as R–F or F–R, and any waiting time at R or F bias is noted. Before J–V scans, the devices were illuminated for several minutes, which can minimize the influence of the trap states and obtain a steady state. For a typical J–V hysteresis phenomenon in PSCs, the photocurrent and efficiency for the F–R scan are higher than those for the R–F scan. When 4 or 3 spraying cycles of the c-TiO2 layer were applied for printable mesoscopic PSCs, the same trend was observed and we defined this case as hysteresis-normal (Fig. 2a). When we reduced the spraying cycles, it was found that the normal hysteresis effect could be firstly eliminated for 2 cycles (Fig. 2b), and then be inverted (Fig. 2c) completely for 1 cycle, which is regarded as a tunable hysteresis effect for printable mesoscopic PSCs. The corresponding devices are coded as hysteresis-normal, hysteresis-free, and hysteresis-inverted. Besides the spraying cycles of the c-TiO2 layer, such tunable hysteresis effect is also related to the UV-ozone treatment (Table S1, ESI†). It is important to remark that the dynamic hysteresis in our devices mainly affects the apparent photovoltage, and as a consequence the FF, which indicates that recombination changes occurring along the dynamic scan might play a dominant role in the observed changes. Further details on interpretation are presented in the last section of this work.

(F–R: from forward bias to reverse bias; R–F: from reverse bias to forward bias; scan rate 250 mV s−1). 
The photovoltaic parameters of the devices showing different hysteresis effects are summarized in Table 1. Generally, the devices fabricated with different cycles of sprayed c-TiO2 layers show similar performance, especially for the JSC and PCE. When the number of spray deposition cycles was reduced from 4 to 1, the VOC decreased from 0.92 V to 0.86 V, and the FF increased from 0.63 to 0.69. For the parameters measured with F–R and R–F scans, the main differences lie in VOC rather than JSC or FF. This is quite different from the trend of typical hysteresis phenomena for PSCs.12

Besides scan direction, the scan rates also influence the hysteresis behaviors of PSCs. To investigate the rate-dependent hysteresis effect of the devices, the photovoltaic parameters were measured at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1, 50 mV s−1, 100 mV s−1, and 250 mV s−1, and compared in Fig. 3. Although the parameters measured at different scan rates varied, the differences between the values obtained with F–R and R–F scans still provide essential information for the hysteresis behaviors of the printable mesoscopic PSCs. For hysteresis-normal devices (Fig. 3a), the difference in VOC for F–R and R–F scans reduced from ∼70 mV to ∼20 mV when the scan rate decreased from 250 mV s−1 to 25 mV s−1, while the difference in JSC increased slightly. For the overall PCE, F–R at all scan rates led to a higher value than R–F. For hysteresis-free devices (Fig. 3b), F–R and R–F scans showed almost the same photovoltaic parameters of VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE at all different scan rates, though the values decreased slightly when the scan slowed down. For hysteresis-inverted devices (Fig. 3c), the R–F scan resulted in a higher VOC and FF and a lower JSC than the F–R scan, leading to a higher PCE, and the difference between the R–F and F–R scans did not change much for all the scan rates.

The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) of the devices with different hysteresis behaviors are also summarized in Table S2 (ESI†) and compared in Fig. S2 (ESI†). All RS slightly decreased as the scan rate increased from 50 to 250 mV s−1, while RSH shows much more stable values as scan rates increased. In particular, the hysteresis-free devices showed slightly larger RS, but similar RSH, compared with the hysteresis-normal and hysteresis-inverted devices independent of the scan rate. For RS and RSH measured at F–R and R–F scans, hysteresis-normal and hysteresis-inverted devices showed similar RS, but larger RSH at F–R scans. Hysteresis-free devices showed similar RSH, but smaller RS at F–R scans.
2.3 Hysteresis index characterization
A hysteresis index has been defined to describe the differences in J–V curves appearing near open-circuit condition.28 In our case, since the hysteresis has been inverted causing the R–F scan to show higher current density and overall performance, a modified J–V hysteresis effect index (HEI) is defined by eqn (1). (1)where JFR(0.8VOC) and JRF(0.8VOC) represent current-density at 80% of VOC for F–R and R–F scans, respectively. Even though our observations differ markedly for the early observations that lead to the definition of HEI in terms of the current difference,15 the HEI shown in Fig. 4 still serves to illustrate the consistent evolution of J–V curves depending on the changes of the c-TiO2 layer. For hysteresis-normal devices, the JFR(0.8VOC) is higher than JRF(0.8VOC), leading to a positive HEI value. On the contrary, hysteresis-inverted devices show negative HEI values, as shown in Table 1. The reduction of c-TiO2 spray deposition cycles resulted in a significant decrease in HEI from positive values of 0.0422 and 0.017 to 0.001, then to a negative value of −0.0434 (Fig. 4a). The transition of HEI from hysteresis-normal to hysteresis-inverted is almost linear to the spray deposition cycles of c-TiO2. Due to the relatively stable JSC at different scan rates, the HEI values of all three types of devices also stayed almost unchanged as the scan rate decreased (Fig. 4b). Considering that such printable mesoscopic PSCs show different trends for hysteresis effects, the variations in VOC provide more key information for analyzing such tunable hysteresis for printable mesoscopic PSCs.

2.4 Characterization of the c-TiO2 layer
Ion migration within the perovskite film, high trap-state density for charge carriers at the perovskite surface, and unbalanced charge carrier transport have been considered as the origins of the hysteresis effect for PSCs.3,27,28 Great efforts have been made to develop deposition methods that are able to obtain high-quality perovskite crystals. Typically, perovskite layers with large grain size, uniform morphology, and appropriate composition will possess low defect density and show restricted ion migration, which enables hysteresis-free/less devices with various architectures.25,31,32 In our case, the formation of the perovskite crystals was first templated by 5-AVA cations with preferential growth in the normal direction, and then hosted by the scaffold of the TiO2/ZrO2/carbon triple-layer. Thus, the hysteresis effect originating from the quality of the perovskite crystals has been minimized. Considering the remarkable device stability under working conditions, we propose that the J–V hysteresis effect in our devices is mainly due to the charge accumulation at the interfaces rather than the composition change in the perovskite crystals, which would cause severe performance degradation of the devices.33,34 In printable mesoscopic PSCs, the mp-TiO2 collects and transfers the electrons as the ETL, while the c-TiO2 layer works as a selective contact layer that transports electrons but blocks holes. Without a c-TiO2 layer, the perovskite absorber will directly contact the FTO front electrode, resulting in a significant charge recombination and voltage loss for the device (Fig. 5a). Unfortunately, the electron mobility of TiO2 is only about 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1,35,36 which is much lower than the transportation of charge carriers in MAPbI3 (10−2–100 cm2 V−1 s−1).37 Thus, it was proposed that the mp-TiO2 layer in conventional structured PSCs would limit the electron transport, and cause capacitive hysteresis.38,39 Herein we show that the hysteresis in c-TiO2 and mp-TiO2 based PSCs is mainly dependent on the c-TiO2 layer and associated interfaces, not on the mp-TiO2 layer.

(b) AFM images (scan area: 2 μm × 2 μm) of the bare FTO substrate and c-TiO2 sprayed FTO substrate. (c–e) Dark J–V curves at room temperature in logarithm scaled current representation at different scan rates for hysteresis-free, hysteresis-normal, and hysteresis-inverted devices. The arrows in the vertical scale indicate the direction of increasing current, either positive or negative. 
As we show later, the c-TiO2 surface meets the perovskite layer and here the ionic and electronic carriers find a barrier and establish essential charge accumulation and band bending that when combined with surface recombination rates play a key role in the apparent voltage in transient conditions. In addition, the accumulation of electrons at the thin c-TiO2 itself is also an important factor to control the measured voltage. These elements will form the main considerations in our model, which motivates further analysis of the structure of the c-TiO2 layer.
It should be noted that the deposition of the c-TiO2 layer between the mp-TiO2 and FTO layers also improves the contact and facilitates the charge transfer at the interfaces. Atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were performed to unravel the differences of the surface morphology of bare and c-TiO2 sprayed FTO substrates (Fig. 5b and Fig. S3, ESI†). The FTO substrate possessed a polyhedron composed morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 15.12 nm. After spraying a c-TiO2 layer, the surface became composed of sphere-shaped particles and the roughness decreased slightly to 14.18 nm. Due to the rough surface of the FTO layer, we cannot accurately obtain the thickness of the c-TiO2 layer sprayed on the FTO substrates with 1–4 cycles. Instead, we sprayed the c-TiO2 layer on a silicon wafer with 8 cycles, and measured its thickness by a profilometer. The thickness of the c-TiO2 layer was 52.7 ± 5.50 nm. Thus, we suppose the thickness of the c-TiO2 layers sprayed with 1–4 cycles is 6.59 ± 0.69 nm, 13.18 ± 1.37 nm, 19.76 ± 2.06 nm, and 26.35 ± 2.75 nm, respectively. It is expected that the FTO particles are wrapped by an ultra-thin TiO2 film, and this can be regarded as an interface modification rather than the formation of an extra interlayer.
The XPS measurements were carried out to investigate the Ti element in the 1–4 cycle c-TiO2 sprayed FTO substrates. The Ti peak areas were summarized and compared using the Sn peak as a reference peak. The Ti/Sn ratio increased significantly from 1.581 to 3.93, then to 10.3 and 22.1 for 1–4 cycle c-TiO2 spraying (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, the work function of the c-TiO2 sprayed FTO substrates was characterized, which decreased slightly from 4.79 eV for the bare FTO to 4.45–4.62 eV for the 1–4 cycle c-TiO2 sprayed FTO (Fig. S5, ESI†). The influence of the c-TiO2 layer on the charge extraction was investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. S6, ESI†). Semi-devices of the FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/ZrO2/perovskite were fabricated with 1–4 cycle sprayed c-TiO2 layers. A very fast decay followed by a slower decay was observed for all samples, as also observed elsewhere.40 The curves were fitted by a biexponential decay function, and the results are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). It was found that τ1 and τ2 are almost identical as the c-TiO2 spraying cycles increased, indicating that a thicker c-TiO2 layer does not significantly modify the charge extraction of the c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 bilayer.
2.5 Capacitive hysteresis characterization
Capacitance analysis of the voltage sweep in the dark was performed to investigate the capacitive hysteresis effect in printable mesoscopic PSCs (Fig. 5c–e), which was proposed to be caused by the charge accumulation at the TiO2/perovskite interface.38,39 The voltage variation, ΔV, applied to the solar cell produces a transient response before reaching the steady state. The time interval Δt between the applied voltage steps might be shorter than the time of relaxation. In the cases in which a charging process occurs, an additional transient current is expected to be observed caused by the time variation of the accumulated charges. Furthermore, capacitive currents should vanish as the scan rate approaches the steady-state conditions. For the hysteresis-normal device (Fig. 5d), significant capacitive hysteresis was observed along with similar dark current density with hysteresis-free and hysteresis-inverted devices at a forward (positive) bias. When the number of spraying cycles for the c-TiO2 layer decreased from 4 to 1, the capacitive hysteresis effect first vanished (Fig. 5c), and then came back (Fig. 5e). The dark capacitive trends indicate that a strong polarization may exist at the c-TiO2/perovskite interface,38 which can have a significant impact on the hysteretic trends under illumination.
2.6 Effect of delay time
As mentioned in the previous section, for the hysteresis effect of the printable mesoscopic PSCs, the main difference between F–R and R–F scans lies in VOC rather than JSC or FF. Thus, we summarized and compared the VOC for F–R and R–F scans, presented as [VOC(F–R) − VOC(R–F)] versus scan rates in Fig. 6. Notably, we found that the intervals and sequence between J–V scans also influence the device performance, which can provide us with some key information. In this case the VOC was measured by sequential scans with an interval of 0 s or 60 s at 250 mV s−1, 100 mV s−1, 50 mV s−1, and 25 mV s−1 first in the F–R direction, and then in the R–F direction. The dependence of VOC on scan rate is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Dependence of [VOC(F–R) − VOC(R–F)] on scan rates. The hysteresis (a) -normal, (b) -free, and (c) -inverted devices were continuously scanned with an interval of 0 s or discontinuously scanned with an interval of 60 s at 250 mV s−1, 100 mV s−1, 50 mV s−1 and 25 mV s−1 firstly in the F–R direction, and then in the R–F direction. The VOC values were summarized and compared as [VOC(F–R) − VOC(R–F)] versus scan rate. 
Without any delay (interval of 0 s) between scans, [VOC(F–R) − VOC (R–F)] decreased as the scan rate slowed down from 250 mV s−1 to 25 mV s−1 for hysteresis-normal and hysteresis-free devices, while it increased for the hysteresis-inverted device. Remarkably, in this condition, the hysteresis-inverted device showed higher VOC and PCE for F–R scans. In other words, this hysteresis-inverted device showed a normal hysteresis effect. When an interval of 60 s was applied between the scans, the evolution of the VOC changed significantly. For hysteresis-normal and hysteresis-free devices, [VOC(F–R) − VOC (R–F)] increased as the scan rate slowed down, which showed completely opposite trends against the results obtained with an interval of 0 s. Significantly, the values of [VOC(F–R) – VOC(R–F)] for the hysteresis-inverted device became negative, which was consistent with the results discussed in the previous section.
3. Discussion
Since the VOC is the main photovoltaic variable modified in the type of hysteresis in our cells, the mechanisms of hysteresis cannot be explained based on the models of charge collection presently dominant in the literature. The observation of a consistent JSC irrespective of the scan rate and direction indicates that charge transport and extraction are identical at low F biases, pointing to a preferential recombination mechanism at large F biases, modifying the output voltage. In consideration of the above arguments, we explain the trends observed by considering the dominant contribution of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface. Fig. 7 provides a picture of the charge accumulation and polarization features at the interface. The formation of an accumulation of cations and electronic holes at the c-TiO2/perovskite interface under illumination has been discussed in a surface polarization model41 and is shown in Fig. 7c. Note that the morphology of the mesoporous layer is neglected as it is assumed that rather narrow band bending occurs at the perovskite side. This accumulation of cations and electronic holes in a stabilized situation creates excess potential at the c-TiO2/perovskite interface that enhances VOC. It also serves as a strong source of surface recombination, by electrons coming from the TiO2 side of the contact.
 Fig. 7  Schematic diagram of the c-TiO2 (blue layer)/perovskite (orange film) interface indicating the processes governing the VOC. We consider a p-type perovskite at short circuit conditions shown in (a) with a built-in potential at the perovskite/c-TiO2 interface (electrons represented in red, holes and cations in blue and green respectively). (b) The PSC under an applied forward bias. Process 1 indicates the kinetics of drift of cations and holes towards the interface. (c) The PSC at large forward bias (VOC). The accumulation of cations and holes at the interface creates an upward band bending which can be described by a surface voltage Vs represented in 2. These accumulated charges can act as a preferential zone for both recombination with electrons in the bulk (3) and in the c-TiO2/FTO region. Recombination pathway 4 is crucially dependent on the thickness of the c-TiO2 layer, and is the dominant mechanism controlling recombination rates of accumulated charges and the output VOC in a transient scan. 
Slow kinetic features result in hysteresis patterns that are mainly induced by the sluggish ionic dynamics, as already indicated in the capacitive response in Fig. 5. The ionic displacement is completed at F voltage at the start of an F–R scan, causing the large accumulation, Fig. 7c, which is almost a steady-state value that is not modulated by ionic drift rates. Contrarily, for the R–F scan, the accumulation is delayed, which creates an asymmetry of VOC values. In an R–F scan, the ions are moved away at R bias, so that the voltage cannot reach the same value as that of the F–R scan, explaining the normal hysteresis. It is noted from Fig. 2 that the F–R VOC is identical for normal hysteresis and hysteresis-free devices but is reduced by ∼50 mV for the inverted hysteresis samples. This indicates that another major factor to consider in the variation of photovoltage is the amount of recombination, as commented on before. For thinner c-TiO2 layers, the covering of FTO may be incomplete, facilitating recombination of surface electrons as indicated in Fig. 7c. (process 4). The R–F scan VOC is increased by ∼70 mV for the hysteresis-free and inverted hysteresis devices. This is also attributed to the larger work function of the thin c-TiO2 layers (Fig. S5, ESI†), creating smaller built-in potential for the perovskite, which allows for larger accumulation at a given F voltage in the R–F scan. For the inverted hysteresis devices, the large R–F voltage is sustained likely due to the sluggish kinetics of the surface recombination indicated in (4) in Fig. 7c. The improved R–F VOC values contribute to the hysteresis-free behavior, and in conjunction with the VOC drop in the F–R direction for a very thin c-TiO2 layer, yields the inverted hysteresis trend in our samples. TRPL analysis showed that the kinetics of charge extraction is rather similar in the different thickness cases so that the differences of interfacial kinetics do not appear to be a significant factor controlling the changes of hysteresis patterns.
We now proceed to explain the rich variety of behaviors of the dependence of VOC on the scan rates (Fig. 3) and waiting times (Fig. S7, ESI†). For the F–R scan, the accumulated positive charges at the surface at steady state recombine immediately upon cycling the voltage. Therefore, faster scans provide a larger VOC in the F–R direction. This is observed for all devices, irrespective of the type of hysteresis, Fig. 3. The effect of waiting time under illumination is identical, where the accumulation is enhanced due to the photogenerated carriers, providing larger output voltages in all devices except the hysteresis-inverted devices. This could occur due to the increased surface recombination of the photogenerated carriers for very thin c-TiO2 layers previously described. For the R–F scans, the VOC improves for faster scan rates since the positive ions do not have enough time to drift away from the c-TiO2 layer, thereby improving the VOC. The effect of waiting time under illumination is for the photovoltage to drive positive ions towards the c-TiO2, thereby facilitating accumulation and also enhanced VOC during the RF scan.
In summary, we observe that the interplay of slow dynamics of charge accumulation and changes of recombination rates explain the observed hysteresis patterns. Hysteresis in PSCs is regarded as a combination of processes inherent to the operation of this device and not as a single effect that can be removed. However, high quality materials and interfaces do minimize the influence of dynamic hysteresis, which mainly affects the photovoltage according to the scanning procedure.
4. Conclusions
We have identified a tunable hysteresis effect consisting of VOC variations where the type of hysteresis can be altered solely through the modification of the c-TiO2 layer. The trends in the tunable hysteresis effect are considered here to be caused by the polarization of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface, and are related to the kinetics of accumulation of positive charges at this interface during J–V scans, in combination with the extent of surface recombination. The nature and properties of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface are critical for the recombination rates of the accumulated charges at this interface, which is the dominant mechanism controlling the hysteretic trends in the PSCs. The demonstration of such tunable hysteresis effect in printable mesoscopic PSCs shows that the properties of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface are crucial for controlling the device performance metrics. We showed that hysteresis-free devices can be formed by adapting specific conditions of the contact from a broad range of possibilities, and that hysteresis-free devices may not coincide with the optimal solar cell operation. Therefore, we suggest that understanding the phenomenon of hysteresis is necessary for a better control of PSC materials and interfaces.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have captured intensive attention due to their advantages of low material cost, simple fabrication process, and high efficiency. In particular, the extremely fast increase in efficiency, from 2.19% in 2006 to the current 22.1%, has enabled this photovoltaic technology to challenge the current commercialized solar cells. However, PSCs usually suffer from a hysteresis effect in current–voltage (J–V) measurements, which leads to an inaccurate estimation of the device performance. This paper reports a tunable hysteresis effect for printable mesoscopic PSCs based on a triple-layer TiO2/ZrO2/carbon architecture. By optimizing the deposition of the compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer, the normal hysteresis effect where the forward scan (from short-circuit to open-circuit) leads to a poorer device performance than the backward scan (from open-circuit to short-circuit) can be firstly eliminated, and then inverted. Interestingly, the difference of the J–V curves measured with opposite scan directions mainly lies in the open-circuit voltage, not the current density or fill factor. The results are interpreted in terms of the interaction of charge accumulation and recombination effects. The demonstration of such tunable hysteresis effect not only shows the critical importance of the c-TiO2/perovskite interface for PSCs, but also provides significant understanding of this emerging photovoltaic technology.
