    , Accepted 5th April 2018First published on 10th April 2018AbstractIn the last decade, fluorination has been successfully applied to organic semiconductor materials, especially to donor or acceptor materials for non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Currently, the power conversion efficiency based on these fluorinated materials is higher than that of the fullerene-based ones. Thus fluorination can down-shift the frontier molecular orbits, enhance inter/intramolecular interactions and reduce the Coulombic potential between holes and electrons. However, the key role of fluorine in improving the charge mobility of electron acceptors has yet to be systematically investigated. Here, we comprehensively explore the intermolecular interactions and electron mobilities in amorphous ITOIC and ITOIC-2F films by multiscale simulations. The simulations indicate that the electrostatically driven fluorine–π (F–π) interaction can exhibit a key role in increasing the intermolecular interactions and reducing the distance between the terminal groups of the fluorinated material ITOIC-2F. This phenomenon ultimately increases the intermolecular transfer integral and leads to an increase in electron mobility. Our work suggests that adding fluorine to the appropriate position of the phenyl ring can effectively inverse the electrostatic potential and produce intermolecular F–π interactions, which will be an effective way to improve the electron mobilities of the fluorinated electron acceptors for non-fullerene OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received great attention in recent years because of their ability to form flexible large-area photovoltaic panels under low-cost solution-process conditions.1,2 The broad application of OSCs ranges from flexible low-weight solar modules to photon recycling in liquid-crystal displays.3,4 Fullerenes and fullerene derivatives, such as PC60BM ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester),5 PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester)6 and ICBA (indene-C60bisadduct),7 have been used as traditional electron acceptor materials for OSCs over the last two decades, and these materials possess strong electron affinity and high electron mobility.8 However, fullerene derivatives are limited by narrow and weak absorption of sunlight and poor tenability of energy levels which cause fullerene-based OSCs to suffer from large energy losses.9 The current power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of fullerene-based OSCs are limited to 10–12%.10–16 Fused-ring electron acceptors for non-fullerene OSCs with synthetic flexibility have shown great potential to overcome the limitations of fullerene derivatives and thus have recently emerged as a major topic in the field of organic photovoltaics.17–20
In the past few years, many efficient molecular design strategies have been used to improve the parameters of non-fullerene OSCs.13,19,21 The strategies include the introduction of the most electronegative atom with the smallest size in the periodic table (fluorine), which is very useful in fine-tuning the energy levels22 and improving the optoelectronic properties.13,23–25 Kawashima et al. developed a series of fluorinated polymers for OSCs, and the device demonstrated outstanding performance with a PCE as high as 10.5%.26 The device used fluorinated materials in favour of charge generation and recombination in the polymers and their ordering structures. Not only for polymer molecule materials, fluorinated small-molecule materials also been reported for inverted OSCs and exhibited an average PCE of about 12%.13,27 The authors attribute the good performance to fluorinated materials, which resulted in an optimal active layer morphology, including enhanced domain purity, hierarchical domain size and directional vertical phase gradation. Zhao and co-workers reported a new fluorinated polymer donor and a new small-molecule acceptor for fullerene-free OSCs, and the device showed a record high efficiency of 13.1%23 because of the broad optical absorption range and the enhanced absorption coefficient of the fluorinated materials. The open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and the short-circuit current (Jsc) of the OSCs correspond to three decisive parameters for obtaining highly efficient OSCs. Both the Jsc and FF can be improved by enhancing the charge mobility of the donor and acceptor materials,28,29 especially for the fused-ring electron acceptors for non-fullerene OSCs because the electron mobility of these materials is lower than those of the fullerene derivatives.21,30,31 As mentioned above, fluorination is an effective method for designing high-performance electron acceptor materials, but how it affects the charge mobility of the fluorinated materials has yet to be studied.
In this work, we focused on comprehensively investigating the key role of fluorine in improving the charge mobilities of the electron acceptors for non-fullerene OSCs. A newly developed small-molecule acceptor, ITOIC, and its fluorinated reference material, ITOIC-2F (Fig. 1a), are used to explore the charge mobility using a multiscale simulation approach. We find that the replacement of hydrogen atoms by fluorine on the terminal groups’ phenyl ring of ITOIC can greatly change the physical and chemical properties caused by the electronegativity of the fluorine atoms. Such changes include increasing the electron affinity of ITOIC-2F and making the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the terminal group's phenyl ring inverse to that of ITOIC. Therefore, the terminal group's phenyl ring of ITOIC-2F has an electron-deficient aromatic surface, and it can combine with fluorine to produce the fluorine–π (F–π) interactions between ITOIC-2F molecules in the amorphous film. This interaction is electrostatically driven, stronger than the other halogen–π interactions and more stabilizing than the CH–π interactions.32,33 Furthermore, intermolecular interactions increased while the distance between the terminal groups of ITOIC-2F was reduced, which ultimately increased the intermolecular transfer integral and led to an increase in electron mobility. This work suggests that the introduction of fluorine atoms on the terminal groups’ phenyl ring can effectively inverse the ESP and produce the intermolecular F–π interactions, and this method plays a key role in improving the electron mobilities of the fluorinated electron acceptors for non-fullerene OSCs.

Computational methods
Quantum chemical calculations
The geometry optimization and spatial distribution of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and LUMO−1 of the ground states for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F are calculated using the B3LYP hybrid functional with the basis of def2-SVP. No imaginary frequency is detected in these calculations. The vertical and adiabatic electron affinity (VEA/AEA) and the reorganization energy for electron transfer (λ−) are calculated with the same hybrid functional and a more exact basis of def2-SVPD. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels were calculated at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP level. All calculations are carried out using the ORCA34 Revision 4.0.0 program with the auxiliary basis def2/JK.35
Molecular dynamics simulations
The geometries of ITOIC and ITOIC-2F are optimized using the method mentioned above. The Gromacs 5.1.4 molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package36 is used to accomplish the MD simulations for all systems. The atom types and intra- and inter-molecular interaction parameters of ITOIC and ITOIC-2F are taken from the GROMOS 54A7 force field17 with MOPAC charges.18 The ITOIC and ITOIC-2F systems are built and imitated using the following procedure: (1) 100 molecules are randomly placed in a large box (10 × 10 × 10 nm3) to generate the initial geometry; (2) 50000 steps of the steepest descent are conducted on the system to remove the undesired forces and structural distortion; (3) 600 K and 100 bar are simulated at 5 ns to quickly close the gap between the molecules; (4) 600 K and 1 bar are simulated at 10 ns and then cooled down to 300 K at 3 ns; and (5) the system is kept at a temperature of 300 K for 20 ns to achieve a completely converged system. A stochastic velocity-rescaling thermostat37 is used to maintain a constant temperature with a relaxation time of 0.2 ps. Pressure coupling is controlled by the Parrinello–Rahman approach38 with a relaxation time of 5.0 ps. A spherical cut-off of 1.2 nm for van der Waals and Coulombic interactions and the long-range electrostatic interactions are calculated by the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method.39 The equations of motion for all simulations are integrated with a time step of 0.001 ps.
Charge mobility calculations
Generally, the charge transport models of organic semiconductor materials appear in two kinds: the band model40 and the hopping model.41 We employed the hopping model to calculate the electron mobility because the reorganization energies are large and the electronic couplings are not strong for our studied system. The charge hopping rate from one molecule to another can be described by the Fermi golden rule, which is a quantum version of charge transfer.20,41 (1)
Considering the high temperature limits (ℏωj/kBT ≪ 1, j ≈ kBT/ℏωj, the classical limit) in this study, the short-time approximation can be applied. Therefore, eqn (1) is transformed into the widely used charge hopping rate formula, the Marcus formula, as follows: (2)where ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant, Vij is the transfer integral between the ith and jth molecules, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and is set to 300 K in this work, and λ denotes the reorganization energy. Eqn (2) is often used to describe the charge transport in organic semiconductor materials.41–45 The reorganization energy λ is the sum of two relaxation energy terms: (i) the energy difference between the neutral molecule in the optimal charged geometry and the equilibrium neutral geometry and (ii) the energy difference between the charged molecules in these two geometries. The transfer integral Vij for molecular dimers (the shortest interatomic distance between the backbones which is less than 0.5 nm) is computed using the Zerner's intermediate neglect of the differential overlap (ZINDO) method.46
The charge transport can be characterized by a diffusion process within the considered hopping rates. In this method, the charge can hop between adjacent molecular dimers according to the above hopping rates. In the low field limit, the carrier mobility can be described by the Einstein formula, (3)where e is the electron charge and D is the charge diffusion coefficient. In the n-dimensional system, D is defined as the ratio between the mean-square displacement and the diffusion time.47 (4)where r(t)2 is the mean-square displacement. To obtain a linear relationship between the mean-square displacement and the diffusion time, 1000 diffusion processes are simulated with a random starting molecule. These processes are performed using a random walk (Monte Carlo) simulation approach, as mentioned in previous studies that simulated the charge mobility of crystal materials.41,48–50
In this work, we used the MD simulation system as a primary cell, and the periodic boundary conditions are set in all directions for both MD and Monte Carlo simulations to build the amorphous film. The entire computational and simulated processes are shown in our early work.51
Results and discussion
Molecular properties
The chemical structures of ITOIC and fluorinated ITOIC-2F are illustrated in Fig. 1a. To gain further insights into the molecular structural properties of these materials, the bond critical point (BCP) analysis based on the atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory52 is conducted. The intramolecular BCPs are shown in Fig. 2.

This figure demonstrates the four kinds of intramolecular interactions of S⋯O, O⋯H, N⋯H and H⋯π. We found that the S⋯O and H⋯π interactions play an important role in confirming the planar conformation of the backbones of ITOIC and ITOIC-2F. A topological analysis of the electron density is also performed to investigate the BCP properties. The electron density (ρ) and the Laplacian of the electron density (∇2ρ) at these four types of BCPs are shown in Table 1. The ∇2ρ values for S⋯O, O⋯H and H⋯π are greater than 0.02 a.u., which indicate that these bonds are stronger than that of N⋯H.53 The ρ values for S⋯O and H⋯π are 0.021 a.u. and 0.012 a.u., respectively, which are much larger than that of a typical hydrogen bond (0.002 < ρ < 0.0034 a.u.). Therefore, the S⋯O and H⋯π intramolecular interactions are responsible for maintaining the planar conformation of the backbone. This finding agrees with the recent experimental findings that noncovalent interactions play an important role in locking the conformation of small molecular acceptors.19 The results are obtained using the Multiwfn 3.4.1 package.54

According to the calculated results, the replacement of hydrogen atoms by fluorine on the terminal group of ITOIC has a minimal effect on intramolecular interactions. Simultaneously, we investigated the spatial distributions of the LUMO and LUMO−1, the main frontier orbitals for electron transfer. We found that the effect of fluorination on the distribution of the LUMO and LUMO−1 is still not significant. The electrons are mainly delocalized on the backbone for both ITOIC and ITOIC-2F, as shown in Fig. 3.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels, VEA/AEA, and λ− of ITOIC and ITOIC-2F are calculated at the B3LYP/def2-SVPD level. The results in Table 2 show that fluorination can down-shift the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and increase the electron affinity (VEA/AEA), which are all in favour of the better-accepting electrons. Although fluorination allows the molecule to acquire the electrons more easily from the fluorine's electronegativity, no effect is observed on λ− which is 0.12 eV for both ITOIC and ITOIC-2F.

Amorphous films
Reorganization energy and transfer integral are important parameters, and both can thus affect charge mobilities. The solution-process conditions (spin-coating and thermal annealing) to prepare the ITOIC/ITOIC-2F thin films are within 10–30 minutes, and thus the structures of these solid films are likely amorphous. Therefore, based on the equilibrated structures obtained from the MD simulations, we constructed adjacent molecular dimers for each molecule under periodic conditions. Subsequently, we used the ZINDO method to obtain the electronic couplings and calculate the transfer integral for each dimer. We simultaneously obtained the coordinates of each molecular centre-of-mass (COM) which are used as the electron-hopping points in the Monte Carlo simulation.
The charge transport in the amorphous organic semiconductor film is determined by a mesoscopic conductive network that depended on the number of the nearest neighbours and the strength of the intermolecular transfer integral.45 Considering the reorganization energy for electron transfer, transfer integral and coordinate of the hopping point at hand, we used a simple and powerful extension graph approach to describe the mesoscopic relationships among the interacting molecules.55
Firstly, in the Monte Carlo simulations, we randomly selected one molecule (i) as the initial charge centre. Then, the charge hops between the centre molecule i and its adjacent molecule (j) and is expressed as the probability , where n is the number of molecular dimers built with molecule i. The hopping time is 1/kij and the hopping distance is assumed to be the molecular COM–COM distance. At each hopping step, a random number r that is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 is generated. If , then the charge is assumed to move from molecule i to the αth adjacent molecule j, followed by the next hopping step starting from this molecule. The squared displacement and time are recorded every 10 ns which is much larger than the time cost in one hopping step. The time for each Monte Carlo simulation is set to 1 μs.
As described in eqn (4), to obtain a diffusion constant, we need a linear relationship between the square of the diffusion distance and the diffusion time. Five typical simulations for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F are conducted (Fig. 4), but achieving a linear behaviour in one of the Monte Carlo simulations is incidentally impossible. However, after 1000 simulations, the average squared displacement achieved a linearity with respect to time. Fig. 4 shows the average squared displacement over 1000 Monte Carlo simulations exhibiting a very good linear relationship with hopping time. The diffusion constant for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F is 7.00 × 10−6 and 1.08 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, respectively. As described in eqn (3), the Einstein diffusion model is used to estimate the electron mobilities of ITOIC and ITOIC-2F. The corresponding modelling values are 2.71 × 10−4 and 4.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which agree well with the experimental results of 2.43 × 10−4 and 6.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F, respectively.56

The results indicate that the electron mobility of the fluorinated material ITOIC-2F is nearly twice that of the control material ITOIC. To identify the key factors that affect the electron mobility of the fluorinated material, we investigated the distribution of the electronic transfer integral, the electronic connectivity and the proportion of the largest network for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F (Fig. 5). In the simulation, the ITOIC and ITOIC-2F systems have 734 and 735 effective dimers, respectively. Fig. 5a and c present the electronic transfer integral distributions of these dimers with thresholds of 0.1 and 1 meV, respectively. The number of ITOIC-2F dimers in each transfer integral region is notably larger than that of ITOIC. Electronic connectivity is defined as the average number of neighbours for each molecule with electronic transfer integral larger than the given threshold (VT), and this electronic connectivity (Fig. 5b) is used to explore the charge transport network. Generally, a continuous and robust network can be formed only when the electronic connectivity is ≥245. When the electronic connectivity is almost 2, the threshold transfer integral of ITOIC and ITOIC-2F is 0.5 and 1.0 meV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5d, the proportion of molecules in the largest network represented as a function of VT. When the VT is 0.5 meV, the proportions are 90% and 99% for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F, respectively. Most of the molecules can be connected in the amorphous films to form a continuous and robust network for electron transport. However, when VT increased to 1 meV, only 73% of the molecules are involved in the electronic transport network for the ITOIC amorphous film. By contrast, ITOIC-2F maintained a high level of connectivity at 88%. These results demonstrated that when the electronic transmission network is continuous and robust, the electronic transfer integral of the fluorinated material ITOIC-2F is higher than that of ITOIC. This is the main reason for the high electron mobility of the fluorinated materials.

To understand the key role of fluorine in improving the charge mobility of ITOIC-2F, we investigated the ESPs of ITOIC and ITOIC-2F and plotted the colour-filled molecular surface maps, as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The blue, white and red marks represent the ESPs varying from −38 to 22 kcal mol−1. The minimum and maximum ESPs on the surface of the terminal group's phenyl ring of ITOIC (Fig. 6a) are −5.0 and −2.5 kcal mol−1, respectively. By contrast, when the fluorine is used to replace the hydrogen atom on the terminal group's phenyl ring, the ESP is reversed to a positive value. As shown in Fig. 6b, the minimum and maximum ESPs on the surface of the terminal group's phenyl ring are 2.5 and 8.5 kcal mol−1, respectively, which indicate that this phenyl ring can provide an electron-poor aromatic surface. The fluorine is the most electronegative atom and it attracts the electrons on the phenyl ring to its own side. Subsequently, the ESP of the phenyl ring becomes positive while that of the fluorine becomes negative. To gain deep insights into the changes in the ESPs caused by fluorination, the distributions of the molecular surface area in each ESP range for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F are also shown in Fig. 6c and d. The figures clearly demonstrate that fluorination causes the ESP of the phenyl ring of ITOIC-2F to become positive, resulting in an increase of the molecular surface area with the ESP between 0 and 10 kcal mol−1. Although the ESP around the fluorine is negative, the molecular surface area located in the negative area did not increase because of its small atomic volume. To investigate the packing modes for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F affected by the changed ESP, we depicted the COM radial distribution functions (RDFs) g(r) for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F in simulated amorphous films as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The results show a distinctive peak at 5 Å for the ITOIC-2F system which indicated that the ITOIC-2F molecules have a stronger aggregation within a short range.

The most electronegative fluorine atom and the electron-poor aromatic surfaces exist simultaneously in the ITOIC-2F amorphous film. This phenomenon facilitates the formation of F–π interactions between the adjacent molecules. A typical F–π interaction formed a dimer in the ITOIC-2F amorphous film and is shown in Fig. 7a. This interaction is electrostatically driven, stronger than other halogen–π interactions and more stabilizing than the CH–π interactions.32 Therefore, the intermolecular interactions between the terminal groups in the ITOIC-2F amorphous film will become stronger than those in the ITOIC film because of the existence of the F–π interactions. Consequently, the distance between the COM of the terminal groups is decreased and the orbital overlap is increased to improve the electronic transfer integral and electron mobility of ITOIC-2F.

As shown in Fig. 7a, the COM RDFs g(r) of the ITOIC and ITOIC-2F terminal groups do not exhibit any distinct peaks which confirm the amorphous arrangement for these films. The RDFs increased from 3.4 and 4.0 Å in the ITOIC-2F and ITOIC films. At the small distance range of 3.4–4.5 Å, the COM RDFs g(r) of terminal groups in the ITOIC-2F film are always larger than that of ITOIC. The findings indicate that the COM of the terminal groups has a closer distance in the ITOIC-2F amorphous film. Fig. 7b shows the graphs of bulk density and concentration versus simulation time. The concentration of ITOIC-2F is 867 mol m−3 and larger than that of ITOIC (860 mol m−3). This finding agrees well with the RDF analysis. Therefore, both the COM RDFs of the terminal groups and the concentration prove that the F–π interactions exist and can decrease the distance between the COM of the terminal group, thus making the ITOIC-2F system more compacted.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we used a multiscale simulation approach to systematically investigate the key role of fluorine in improving the electron mobility of the electron acceptor for non-fullerene OSCs. Although the spatial distribution of the electron transport orbitals (LUMO and LUMO−1 mainly located on the backbone) and the electron reorganization energies are almost the same for ITOIC and ITOIC-2F, the electronic transfer integral of the fluorinated material ITOIC-2F is always larger than that of ITOIC which results in a relatively higher electron mobility. This phenomenon can be attributed to the existence of strong and stable F–π interactions between the terminal groups in the ITOIC-2F amorphous film. Our results suggest that the replacement of hydrogen by fluorine at the appropriate position (by inversing the ESP of the phenyl ring and generating F–π interactions in the amorphous film) can effectively improve the electron mobility in the electron acceptor films.
