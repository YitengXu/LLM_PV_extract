    AbstractThiophene enriched fused-aromatic thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine systems were designed and employed to produce low band gap polymers (Eg = 1.0–1.4 eV) when copolymerized with fluorene and cyclopentadithiophene. The copolymers are mainly investigated for organic thin film transistor and organic photovoltaic applications. Molecular packing in the thin films of these polymers was investigated using Grazing incidence X-ray Scattering. Although both fluorene and cyclopentadithiophene polymers follow similar face to face π–π stacking, the latter polymers show much smaller lamellar d-spacings due to side-chain interdigitation between the lamellae. This lead to the higher charge carrier mobilities in cyclopentadithiophene polymers (up to 0.044 cm2/V.s) compared to fluorene polymers (up to 8.1 × 10−3 cm2/V.s). Power conversion efficiency of 1.4% was achieved using fluorene copolymer in solar cells with a fullerene derivative as an acceptor. Although the cyclopentadithiophene polymers show lower band gaps with higher absorption coefficients compared to fluorene copolymers, but the power conversion efficiencies in solar cells of these polymers are low due to their low ionization potentials.
1. Introduction
Development of new polymer semiconducting materials has become an active area of research in recent years due to their potential uses in light weight and flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs).1–5 However, in many instances, the lower efficiency and limited air stability of polymers has limited their commercial use.1 A combination of donor polymer and fullerene derivative (as acceptor) is commonly used in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. In most of these solar cells, a small region of the solar spectrum is absorbed, mainly in the visible region. For example, poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV)6 and poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT)7 have band gaps larger than 1.9 eV, and thus absorb only 30% from the AM1.5 (air mass) solar photon flux. Lower band gap polymers can achieve absorption of a greater fraction of light from the solar spectrum and enable a higher efficiency solar cell.8 In addition, it is important for the polymer to have good charge-carrier mobility for efficient charge dissociation.9
Recently, we have reported electron-deficient fused aromatic thienopyrazine (TP) units for donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers.10,11 The fused TP unit provides a planar and electron rich π-face that enhances π–π stacking between the polymeric chains.12,13 It was shown that a field-effect mobility as high as 0.2 cm2/Vs can be achieved using acenaphthylthienopyrazine type copolymers.10 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was limited to only 1.4% for BHJs with the polymers in this class, which may be due to higher band gaps (∼1.65 eV) and lower absorption coefficients (3–6 × 104 cm−1).11 Interestingly, the band-gap can be significantly lowered by replacing acenaphthyl with phenanthrene in the TP unit. However, the absorption coefficient in the latter polymer became rather low (3.4 × 104 cm−1) and the charge carrier mobility was also reduced. We conjectured that the lower mobility could be due to lower molecular weight of the phenanthrene-based polymer,14 which was again limited by poor solubility. This was also responsible for the poor device performance.
In this study, we describe the design and synthesis of fused TP units enriched with thiophene groups in the form of benzodithiophene (BDT) – the dithiophene analog of phenanthrene. Detailed quantum-chemical characterization was carried out using density functional theory (DFT). Thiophene-rich fused aromatic units in conjugated polymers are of particular importance due to in general their lower reorganization energies and improved device performance compared to the corresponding benzene analogs.15 Thiophene derivatives are also well known to provide better solubility in organic solvents compared to their benzene analogs. Copolymers of these thiophene enriched fused-aromatic TP with fluorene (FL) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) derivatives (Chart 1) are synthesized. 3-(2-Ethylhexyl)thiophene groups were introduced to both sides of a fused aromatic TP to enhance the solubility in common organic solvents. 2-Ethylhexyl groups (branched alkyl chains) were chosen for this study as this class of polymers with branched alkyl chains have shown better efficiency in BHJ solar cells compared to the ones with linear alkyl chains.11 The synthesized polymers were used to fabricate OTFT and BHJ solar cell devices and the performance of these devices is discussed. Packing in the thin film was investigated using Grazing incidence X-ray Scattering. The observed differences in device performance appear to be related to variations in interchain π–π interactions and lamellar d-spacing. The CPDT polymers show lower band gaps, higher absorption coefficients, and higher charge-carrier mobility compared to the FL copolymers; they also form smoother thin films. However, the FL copolymers present higher power conversion efficiencies in solar cells.

2,5-Bis(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiophene-3,4-diamine (4) was synthesized almost quantitatively by reducing 2,5-bis(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-3,4-dinitrothiophene (3) using SnCl2/HCl in ethanol (Scheme 1).17 Dinitro compound 3 was prepared following a microwave assisted Stille coupling reaction between two equivalent of 3-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-tributylstannylthiophene (1) and one equivalent of 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene (2). Condensation between diamine 4 and benzo[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione (5) and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione (6) in chloroform yielded fused aromatic TPs; 8,10-bis(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)trithieno[3,4-b:2′,3′-f:3′′,2′′-h]quinoxaline (BDTdn, 7; 57%) and 8,10-bis(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)trithieno[3,4-b:3′,2′-f:2′′,3′′-h]quinoxaline (BDTup, 8; 78%), respectively. Quinone 5 was synthesized with 76% yield by a reported Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction of 3,3′-bithiophene with oxalyl chloride.18 Synthesis of quinone 6 was achieved by a intramolecular benzoin condensation of 2,-2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboxaldehyde with 38% yield.19 Bromination of 7 and 8 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in DMF afforded 8,10-bis(5-bromo-3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)trithieno[3,4-b:2′,3′-f:3′′,2′′-h]quinoxaline (9, 46%) and 8,10-bis(5-bromo-3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)trithieno[3,4-b:3′,2′-f:2′′,3′′-h]quinoxaline (10, 49%), respectively (Scheme 2).11 These compounds contain the bromo polymerizable sites that were used for the polymerization. They are also relatively stable and readily soluble in chlorinated organic solvents.

 Scheme 2 
Donor–acceptor type copolymers of these fused TPs with fluorene (FL) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT)15,20 were synthesized via Suzuki and Stille polycondensation reactions, respectively (Scheme 3). The TP units are electron poor and act as acceptor units, whereas FL and CPDT are donor units in the polymer chain. The Suzuki coupling between 9 and 10 with 2,7-bis(trimethyleneborate)-9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)fluorene (11) yielded FL copolymers BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL, respectively, with good yields.21,22 These polymers were end-capped with phenyl groups. When toluene was used as solvent for polymerization reactions, the molecular weights (Mw) of the polymers were very low. We assumed that the lower solubility of the polymers in toluene was responsible for low Mw. Polymerization in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) afforded relatively higher Mw polymers, since conjugated polymers are usually more soluble in chlorinated solvents and higher temperature can be used for polymerization due to the higher boiling point of ODCB. For example, the number average molecular weight (Mn) of BDTup-FL was increased to 13000 g/mol from 6000 g/mol by changing the solvent from toluene to ODCB for polymerization.
 Scheme 3 
Microwave assisted Stille coupling reactions were carried out between 9 and 10 with 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (12) in toluene to synthesize the CPDT copolymers BDTdn-CPDT and BDTup-CPDT, respectively. Any tin complex remaining in these polymers were hydrolyzed with dilute HCl in MeOH to yield bromo or hydrogen end-capped polymers. Microwave assisted polymerization has advantages over the traditional thermal polymerization reactions.23 High Mw polymers can be synthesized within a very short time period using microwave. It is believed that decomposition of any reactive intermediates are minimized by the very fast microwave-assisted heating. In our case, we carried out the polymerization for one hour. Mws are increased during the successive irradiation in the first 20–30 mins, as observed during the optimization processes. A relatively low Mw polymer was synthesized following the traditional thermal polymerization reaction, even though the reaction was carried out for more than 5 days. The Suzuki coupling reaction could not be optimized as it uses a heterogeneous aqueous reaction mixture and the solution boils vigorously under microwave radiation.
After both Suzuki and Stille coupling reactions, polymers were precipitated from the reaction mixtures into MeOH. The precipitate was filtered and redissolved in chloroform with palladium scavenger in order to remove any residual palladium catalyst.24 Precipitation in methanol followed by filtration and washing with acetone and hexane afforded pure polymers. These polymers are soluble in hot tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, chlorobenzene, and ODCB.
3.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated in ODCB and in thin films and are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of the thin films of the FL copolymers (BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL) are compared with acenaphthyl- and phenanthrene-based FL copolymers11 in Fig. 1. The absorption peaks are mainly located in two regions; around 300–500 nm and around 525–775 nm for acenaphthyl and 600–950 nm for the others. The absorption spectra of the BDT-based FL copolymers are very similar to those of the phenanthrene-based FL copolymers with significant absorption in the near-infrared region of the solar spectrum. This can help in generating higher photocurrent in photovoltaic devices by absorbing more sunlight. The fused aromatic unit used for TP strongly affects the band gap of the resulting polymer. It was shown that the band gap or the absorption edge could be efficiently reduced by more than 0.2 eV by changing the aromatic unit from acenaphthyl to phenanthrene.11 Band gaps can be further reduced by ∼0.1 eV by introducing BDT units, the thiophene analogs of phenanthrene. However, no dramatic changes in the absorption coefficients were observed. Absorption coefficients are in the range of 3–3.5 × 104 cm−1 in the thin films of BDT and phenanthrene-based FL copolymers.

 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of the thin films of acenaphthyl, phenanthrene, and benzodithiophene-based FL copolymers. The general structure of the polymers is given in the inset. 
The electronic properties of the monomer units and oligomer structures of the BDT copolymers were calculated (as isolated molecules) at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The frontier energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) were characterized for the neutral electronic states. The vertical and adiabatic ionization potentials (IP) and electron affinities (EA) were computed using the neutral and ionic potential energy surfaces, and the lowest singlet excited state transitions were calculated using Time Dependent (TD) DFT methods (Table S3). The properties of the polymers were extrapolated from oligomer calculations and Kuhn fits of energy versus 1/N where N is the number of formal double bonds in the molecule.25 Note that the calculations were performed on model systems of BDT copolymers where all side-chain substituents were replaced with methyl groups (this has only minimal effect on the electronic properties).
The calculated HOMO levels among the fluorene-containing copolymers (AC-FL, PH-FL, BDTdn-FL, and BDTup-FL) display similar characteristic and have energies within a narrow range of −4.3–−4.4 eV (Table 6). The LUMO levels are more affected by the nature of the electron-accepting group and exhibit a larger energy variation ranging from −2.50 eV for AC-FL to −2.83 eV for BDTdn-FL. The lowest-energy LUMOs and corresponding smaller HOMO–LUMO gap energies (which we denote here as Eg) occur in the systems containing BDT groups. The Eg values extrapolated for BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL are 1.51 and 1.59 eV, respectively, and are as much as 0.4 eV lower than that of the AC-FL copolymer and 0.1 to 0.2 eV lower than that of the PH-FL copolymer. A similar effect is observed from the calculated IP, EA, and transition energies, where the S1 transition energies of the BDT polymers are noticeably lower than those of the AC-FL and PH-FL polymers; the S1 transition energy (optical gap) for the BDTdn-FL polymer is calculated to be 1.24 eV.
The differences in the electronic energy levels calculated for the copolymers are attributed to shifts in the LUMO levels originating from the nature of the aromatic group fused onto the electron-accepting moieties. The HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions of the PH-FL and BDT copolymers are shown in Fig. 2. For each copolymer, the LUMO wavefunction localizes onto the fused aromatic groups and thus is more affected by the electron-accepting nature of the acceptor, while the HOMO wavefunction is more delocalized along the polymer backbone and only marginally affected by the acceptor characteristics. The thiophene-enriched BDT groups enhance the electron-accepting nature of the thienopyrazine group of the acceptor.
 Fig. 2  HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions of the (a) PH-FL, (b) BDTdn-FL, and (c) BDTup-FL oligomer (n = 3) model systems calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. 
The HOMO (ionization potential) and LUMO (electron affinity) energies were determined from cyclic voltammetry, performed under argon atmosphere with a supporting electrolyte of 0.05 M n-Bu4NPF6 in anhydrous ODCB. The HOMO of the CPDT copolymers (4.6 eV) is located higher than in the FL copolymers (∼4.85 eV) in solution. However, the LUMO energy of both the FL or CPDT copolymers remains constant, since they share the same electron-accepting units. For example, the LUMO energy of both BDTdn-FL and BDTdn-CPDT polymer is ∼3.52 eV. The ionization potentials (IPs) of the polymer films were measured by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). IPs of BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL are 5.16 and 5.0 eV, respectively. The PES measurement in air becomes erroneous for CPDT copolymers; this is probably due to oxygen doping25 in the polymer films with lower IPs. In the present instance, the LUMO energies in the thin films can be estimated from the HOMO energies and optical band gap of the polymer films (λonset of the absorption spectra); that the optical band gaps can be used for this purpose is due to the fact that the electrochemical band gaps (Eg = ELUMO - EHOMO) are very similar with the optical band gaps determined from solution. For the PH-FL and the BDT copolymers in solution and in thin films, the trends observed from the experimental Eg and optical gap values reported in Table 1 are supported by the calculation results. In agreement with the calculations, the experimental Eg values for the BDT copolymers are also ∼0.1 eV lower than those of the PH-FL copolymer.
Absorption coefficients (α) are significantly enhanced by copolymerizing these BDT monomers with CPDT units. For example, α is increased by almost a factor of two from the FL copolymer BDTup-FL (3.5 × 104 cm−1) to the CPDT copolymer BDTup-CPDT (6.2 × 104 cm−1), Fig. 3. Absorption of CPDT copolymers (BDTdn-CPDT and BDTup-CPDT) becomes relatively broader compared to FL copolymers (BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL) and extends up to 1210 and 1125 nm with band gaps of 1.03 and 1.11 eV for polymers BDTdn-CPDT and BDTup-CPDT, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of the thin films of BDTup-FL and BDTup-CPDT. 
Comparing the polymer absorption of thin films and in solution, the BDTdn copolymers are red shifted by only 5–10 nm, whereas the BDTup copolymers are red-shifted by ∼30 nm. This suggests stronger intermolecular interactions and hence tighter inter-chain packing for BDTup polymers compared to BDTdn polymers (vide infra). Absorption coefficients of the BDTup copolymers are also 1.2–1.5 times higher compared to BDTdn copolymers due to tighter inter-chain packing.
3.3 Thermal properties and molecular packing
The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All of these polymers showed thermal decomposition temperature in the range of 400–420 °C under nitrogen by TGA, indicating good thermal stability. No thermal transition signals were observed from 0 °C to 350 °C in the DSC for these four polymers. DSC signals could be observed only for the polymers in this class that are substituted with linear alkyl chains;11 polymers with branched alkyl chains usually do not show any DSC peaks due to poor ordering.
Grazing incidence X-ray Scattering (GIXS) was employed to investigate crystallinity and packing of the benzodithiophene-based polymers. The data are summarized in Table 2 and room temperature GIXS images of polymer films spin casted on bare silicon (in situ annealing temperature ∼200 °C) are shown in Fig. 4. The sulfur atoms in the benzodithiophene unit face towards the polymer main chain in BDTdn-FL and BDTdn-CPDT, while they point away from the polymer main chain in BDTup-FL and BDTup-CPDT. In addition, alkyl side chains on the donor units and the fused aromatic rings are very likely on the same side for the CPDT copolymers while they are expected to point in opposite directions in the FL copolymers. These structural differences have a marked impact on the film morphology of the FL copolymers while their influence in the CPDT copolymers appears to be only marginal; we found differences on the order of 2.7 Å and more than 0.5 Å in lamellar d-spacing and π–π stacking distances for FL copolymers, respectively, while for the CPDT copolymers the lamellar d-spacings differ by less than 1 Å and the π–π stacking distances are nearly equal.

With regards to interlayer d(100) lamellar spacings, they are significantly smaller in CPDT copolymers (12.8∼13.7 Å) than in FL copolymers (19.9∼22.6 Å). This is likely due to interdigitation of the side chains in the CPDT copolymers (vide infra). It is also apparent from the images shown in Fig. 4 that the BDTdn-FL polymer has better order than the other polymers. The other polymers have only two or three broad reflections, showing that they are poorly ordered. It is interesting to note that the film texture (crystallographic orientation) of all these polymers is different than the usual (100) orientation. The GIXS images in Fig. 4 show that the π–π stacking direction is nominally oriented normal to the substrate surface and the (100) reflections predominate in the substrate plane. We suspect that this is due to the two dimensional like structure of the polymers.
In order to shed some light on the nature of the interchain packing in these polymers, four possible dimer forms of each donor–acceptor monomer unit were optimized (Fig. 5) with the Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) methodology,26,27 which is a semi-empirical type of approach able to describe well intermolecular interactions. Note that in these calculations all the long alkyl side chains are replaced with methyl groups; this simplification is justified by the fact that we are mainly interested here in evaluating the π–π interactions between the monomers, to which the longer alkyl chains contribute little (the long alkyl chains are, however, expected to impact significantly the interlayer d-spacings, see below). In all cases, the orientations involving antiparallel configurations between the fused TP units (orientation 2, Fig. 5) are calculated to be the most stable.
 Fig. 5  Four different orientations of BDTup-CPDT obtained from DFTB calculations (tilt view, see Figure S1 for additional views); similar orientations of the monomer units were considered for BDTdn-FL, BDTup-FL, and BDTdn-CPDT. Note that for orientations 1 and 3, accepting units are on the same side while for orientations 2 and 4, they are pointing in opposite directions. 
The calculations and GIXD data concur in providing very similar packing structures for BDTdn-CPDT and BDTup-CPDT. For the FL polymers the calculations suggest similar orientations (orientation 2) with similar π–π stacking distances for BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL. However, the experimental results are very different. The interchain interactions in type-2 orientations between CPDT units (π–π distance ∼3.9 Å) are stronger than those between of FL units (π–π distance ∼4.7 Å). Thus, it is possible that packing of the CPDT polymers is dominated mainly by the interchain CPDT interactions irrespective of the nature of acceptor units including the position of the sulfur atoms in the fused TP units. In addition, the effects of side alkyl chains are practically the same for both polymers. However, due to the weaker interactions between the FL units, the positions of the sulfur atoms in the TP units and the side chains might play a more significant role in the thin-film packing of BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL, which could explain that these polymers follow very different packing schemes.
In order to shed some light on the origin of the interlayer d-spacings in the polymers, plausible packing structures were constructed on the basis of the type-2 orientations in Fig. 5, using monomer units including the full alkyl side chains, see Fig. 6. The DFTD results suggest that, in the case of the CPDT polymers, the alkyl chains on the thiophene rings can “open up” to accommodate in between them the alkyl chains of a CPDT unit on a neighboring polymer. For the FL polymers, on the other hand, given that all the alkyl side chains of the thiophene and FL units are located on the same side, the steric hindrance among these chains prevents the same type of interdigitation as in the CPDT polymers. This feature could provide the origin for the longer d-spacing in the FL polymers vs. the CPDT polymers. However, more work, including classical molecular dynamics simulations, is warranted to reach a more definitive picture.28

3.4 Field-effect transistor characterization
The mobility of charge carriers (holes) in semiconducting polymers determines their applicability to transistors and OPV devices. High charge-carrier mobilities can lead to increased on-currents and faster switching speeds in transistors, and to increased photocurrent and power conversion efficiency in solar cells. Top-contact organic thin-film field-effect transistors (OTFT) were fabricated to measure the field-effect mobilities of the polymers. Although the diode mobility is more pertinent for PV applications, FET mobilities usually tend to correlate well with diode mobilities.29 Polymer solutions in ODCB were drop-cast on octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS)-treated, heavily-doped, n-type SiO2 (300 nm)/Si wafers. The average thickness of these polymer films was ∼30 nm. The thin films were annealed at different temperatures and gold electrodes (40 nm) were deposited through shadow masks. Electrical performance was tested under dry N2 atmosphere (glovebox). The results from optimized OTFTs for each polymer are summarized in Table 3. Representative I–V characteristics of OTFT devices fabricated from BDTdn-FL are shown in Fig. 7.

 Fig. 7  Representative I–V and output curves of p-type OTFTs of BDTdn-CPDT (a, b) tested in the inert and dry atmosphere (glove box). 
All of these polymers showed p-channel transport (h+) with mobilities in the range of 10−5 to 10−2 cm2/(Vs) with a moderate on/off ratio (in the order of 103) and low threshold voltages. A high hole carrier mobility of 0.2 cm2/(Vs) was obtained using the FL copolymer (AC-FL) with all linear alkyl chains.10 The hole carrier mobility decreased to 0.07 cm2/(Vs) when linear alkyl chains were replaced by branched 2-ethylhexyl alkyl chains in the polymer.11 This was rationalized based on differences between film morphology. Mainly, the polymer with linear alkyl chains was more crystalline than that with branched alkyl chains.11 Compared to AC-FL, its phenanthrene analog PH-FL showed significantly reduced carrier mobility (μmax ∼ 10−4 cm2/(Vs)) and its threshold voltage (Vth) for p-channel transport increases from 1.4 V to 8.8 V. Furthermore, replacing the aromatic unit by benzo[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene in polymer BDTdn-FL further reduces the carrier mobility (∼10−5 cm2/(Vs)) and Vth shifts to 17 V. This is consistent with the lower oxidation potential of the electron-rich phenanthrene- and benzodithiophene-type polymers. However, Vth (−23 V) shifts to a high negative voltage in the case of the benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-based polymer, BDTup-FL, and much higher carrier mobility (∼10−2 cm2/(Vs)) is achieved, which we attribute to the larger π–π stacking distance in BDTdn-FL. This leads to a small overlap between π orbitals on adjacent molecules and thus reduces the charge carrier mobility, despite the better order in this polymer compared to the others (see Fig. 4). In addition, BDTdn-FL produces a very rough film compared to BDTup-FL as indicated by AFM (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Tapping mode AFM images of polymer films (a) BDTdn-FL, (b) BDTup-FL, (c) BDTdn-CPDT, and (d) BDTup-CPDT. 
The side chain interdigitation helps registration between the adjacent lamellae of CPDT polymers,29 and is probably leading to high charge carrier mobilities compared to FL polymers. A hole carrier mobility of 0.044 cm2/Vs is found for BDTup-CPDT. The mobility of BDTdn-CPDT is still lower and on the order of ∼10−4 cm2/Vs. The thin film morphologies CPDT copolymers (BDTdn-CPDT and BDTup-CPDT) are also smoother compared to their FL analogs (BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL) as indicated by the AFM images (Fig. 8).
3.5 Photovoltaic characterization
Solar cell devices were fabricated using blends of each of these polymers and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC[61]BM) with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymer:PCBM/Al. Though several weight ratios of these polymers and PC[61]BM were tested, blends with a 1:4 ratio usually produced higher short-circuit current densities (Jsc), possibly due to formation of stable bimolecular structures of fullerene intercalated between the side-chains of the semiconducting polymer.30 The solar cell data collected under simulated 1 sun AM 1.5G radiation are summarized in Table 4 and the representative I–V curves are shown in Fig. 9. The phenanthrene-based FL copolymer (PH-FL) was reported earlier11 and its solar cell data are compared with the BDT copolymers. Polymer BDTup-FL shows the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) among these FL copolymers; this is likely due to its higher hole carrier mobility compared to PH-FL and BDTdn-FL. A slight increase in the Voc was observed in BDTup-FL cells (∼0.6 V) compared to PH-FL (∼0.48 V) due to its higher ionization potential. Higher Voc is expected in BDTdn-FL compared to BDTup-FL based on their HOMO energies. However, the Voc (0.4 V) was significantly reduced in the case of the BDTdn-FL based solar cell, even though a similar Jsc was obtained (3.2 mA/cm2). AFM of thin films of the blends indicates that BDTdn-FL tends to phase separate from PC[61]BM on long (100 nm) length scales (Fig. 10a). Since this is much longer than the exciton diffusion length, this contributes towards its poor performance. In addition, film quality of BDTdn-FL-based devices was bad due to its poor solubility in organic solvents. In contrast, BDTup-FL blends forms a very smooth films with PC[61]BM or with PC[71]BM irrespective of blending ratios (Fig. 10b–d), suggesting a much finer phase separation.

Solar cell efficiency of BDTup-FL was further optimized using different blending ratio of polymer with acceptor PC[61]BM and PC[71]BM (Table 5, Fig. 11). An optimized PCE of 1.38% (Jsc - 5.45 mA/cm2, Voc - 0.605 V, FF - 0.42) could be achieved using this polymer with PC[61]BM (1:3 blend ratio). Solar cell devices respond well in the visible to NIR region up to 980 nm, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 14% at 750 nm and 30% at ∼480 nm (Fig. 12). The previously reported FL copolymer without ring fusion showed maximum PCE of 2.2%.31 For this copolymer, a higher Jsc (8.2 mA/cm2) was achieved in optimized devices, while Voc and FFs remain comparable to our devices made of FL copolymers, such as the BDTup-FL devices. Higher current is usually obtained by replacing PC[61]BM with PC[71]BM as an acceptor in the active layer, as the latter has higher absorption in the visible region.32 However, the PCE could not be improved for BDTup-FL solar cells by using a PC[71]BM acceptor; this may be due to morphological changes in BDTup-FL. A similar effect was observed in some other recently reported TP copolymers.33

Power conversion efficiencies of CPDT copolymers (0.14–0.40%) are low due to low open circuit voltages (0.35–0.38 V). As indicated earlier, ionization potentials of the CPDT polymers are lower compared to FL copolymers and thus reduce the Voc and limit the efficiency. These CPDT polymers are among very few low band-gap polymers with band gap approaching 1 eV, some of which have been successfully used as donor material in the bulk heterojunction solar cell structure with fullerene derivatives as acceptor, but with very low PCE (<0.1%).34
We were able to achieve the desired low band gap for BHJ solar cells (<1.5 eV) and to induce a favorable packing of the donor–acceptor polymers by introducing novel fused aromatic units in the thienopyrazine structure as evidenced by the enhancement of charge carrier mobilities. Despite this achievement, low absorption coefficients (3–6.2 × 104 cm−1) and high HOMO energies in these polymers limit their PCE. DFT calculations confirm that the electron density in the LUMO wave function is more localized on the acceptor fused TP unit of the polymers, while the electron density associated with the HOMO wave function is delocalized over both the acceptor and donor units (Fig. 3). The localization of the LUMO decreases orbital overlap with the HOMO, which can be detrimental to the strength of the lowest S0 → S1 absorption. We have recently shown that the absence of the adjacent thiophenes around the acceptor enhances the HOMO/LUMO overlap and thus enhances the absorption coefficient for the lowest optical transition (which is dominated by HOMO-to-LUMO electron excitation).35 This also raises the ionization potential. As a consequence, significant enhancement in PCE was observed in solar cell devices using the fused TP based polymer without adjacent thiophenes, due to increased open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. Further investigation is underway to achieve higher efficiency solar cells.
4. Summary and conclusions
In summary, two isomers of benzodithiophene were fused into the aromatic thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine system and their fluorene copolymers are compared with the previously reported analogous polymers based on acenaphthyl and phenanthrene fused aromatic units. It can be concluded that introduction of fused aromatic units within thienopyrazine is a convenient approach to tune the optoelectronic properties of donor–acceptor polymers (Eg = 1.3 to 1.6 eV, HOMO = −4.9 to −5.2 V). We demonstrate that the improved π–π stacking afforded by the fused thienopyrazine units results in high hole mobilities (up to 0.2 cm2/Vs). These polymers also show moderate power conversion efficiencies, up to 1.4% (BDTup-FL - Jsc = 5.45 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.605 V, FF = 0.42), in bulk heterojunction devices. The band-gap of these fused thienopyrazine polymers could be further lowered by co-polymerizing with cyclopentadithiophene (Eg ∼ 1 eV). Although both fluorene and cyclopentadithiophene polymers afford similar face-to-face π–π stacking cyclopentadithiophene polymers show higher charge carrier mobility (μFET = 0.044 cm2/Vs) in thin film transistor devices compared to the analogous fluorene polymers (μFET = 8.1 × 10−3 cm2/Vs). This result can be ascribed to decreased lamellar d-spacings of cyclopentadithiophene polymers as compared to the fluorene polymers yielding from side chain interdigitation between lamellae. However, the power conversion efficiencies of these cyclopentadithiophene polymers are limited due to low open circuit voltages caused by low ionization potentials. Maintaining all the properties of these cyclopentadithiophene polymers along with high ionization potential (>5.2 eV) will be necessary to achieve high efficiency solar cells.

We note that the DFTB approach followed here, while providing a meaningful picture, remains too simple to address the full structural complexity of the polymer films. For instance, even in the case of the dimer packing structures considered here, configurations other than those we presented, such as configurations slightly displaced along the backbone axis, could also exist in the polymer films. A complete analysis of all possible packing structures in the films, based on molecular dynamics / molecular mechanics calculations, is however beyond the scope of this work.
