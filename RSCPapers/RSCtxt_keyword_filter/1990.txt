    , Accepted 3rd December 2020First published on 7th December 2020AbstractAs an archetypal functional molecule, porphyrin is the nature's best photosynthetic pigment in plants, which mimics the principles of solar energy conversion. Considering the prodigious ability of porphyrin to harvest light, we present the stepwise synthesis of a novel conjugated meso-substituted porphyrin dyad entangled with carboxyl functionalized benzimidazolium moieties (CPDCFBM) as a sensitizer for application in a dye sensitised solar cell (DSSC). 1,4-Di(4-amidostyryl)benzene functionalised with a benzimidazole moiety served as a spacer between two substituted porphyrin moieties. The dyad was characterized using analytical techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, BET surface area analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The band gap measured using UV-vis spectroscopy was found to be 1.42 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels calculated from CV studies revealed that the frontier orbital energy levels make the system suitable for use as a sensitizer in conjugation with TiO2 in DSSCs. A DSSC fabricated using dyad sensitized TiO2 as an iodide tri-iodide redox couple exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 6.9%, under illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with a sensitization time of 4 h without adding any efficiency booster and anti-aggregating agents. The strong tethering of the dyad to the TiO2 surface was achieved via linking through six carboxylate groups to form an envelope around TiO2 to ensure excellent electronic communication and good stability against the aggregation of the dyad. An EIS study demonstrated that the dyad shows faster electron injection than recombination.
1. Introduction
Ever increasing energy demands in the context of dwindling fossil fuel reserves is the most important global issue that needs to be tackled soon. To this aim, solar energy produced using solar cell technology has emerged as a cheap, efficient, clean and green alternative to fossil fuels. To harness solar energy, four generations of solar cells are available.1 Among them, organic sensitizer (dye) based solar cells (DSSCs) are quite popular owing to their easy design and synthesis, tailorable absorption profiles and properties, quick junction formation, non-toxicity and low production costs over those of their inorganic counterparts.2,3 To date, ruthenium-based organic complexes (polypyridyl complexes, viz. N3, N719, and N749) have been used to achieve lab-scale power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 14.3% in DSSCs due to the effective channeling of excitation energy from the Ru metal core to the semiconductor.4 However, the rarity, high cost, purification difficulty, toxicity of Ru and the low absorption coefficient of the Ru–dye inhibit the widespread application of these complexes.5,6 Therefore, metal-free organic dyes with numerous molecular structures featuring a π-bridging extension between the donor and acceptor have been screened and proposed as viable alternatives to Ru complexes. Using this strategy, an organic, non-porphyrin based thiophene derivative dye was shown to achieve a maximum PCE of 7.19%.7
Another class of dyes used in DSSCs is based on the archetypal functional molecule, porphyrin. This is a natural pigment that can be used to achieve photosynthesis, charge/energy transfer, catalytic conversions, and transport and storage in plants and animals.8,9 In the natural process of photosynthesis, porphyrin mimics the principles of solar energy conversion and therefore can be evolved as a parallel, smart and green way of light harvesting.5,10 A typical porphyrin has a conjugated aromatic 18 π electron macrocyclic system formed by the linking together of four pyrrolic subunits via a methine bridge as an active centre with numerous functional molecules attached to its periphery.11,12 After the pioneering study on β substituted chlorophyll reported a 2.6% PCE in 1993 for DSSCs,13 numerous research studies have been reported, with a continuous enhancement made in the PCE achieved by making modifications to the structure until a 6.0% benchmark efficiency was reached, very close to that reported for the ruthenium-based N3 dye in 2009.8,14 Further efforts made on the design and synthesis of numerous porphyrin derivatives via the functionalization of four meso and eight beta positions realized enhanced absorption ability in terms of the reshuffling of a characteristics Soret band (400–500 nm) and several Q-bands (550–750 nm).11 Based on this principle, several research studies were reported in the literature with PCEs of more than 10% for DSSCs.5,6,12,15–19 Probing further to design a porphyrin via the attaching of suitable electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties on opposite sides of the porphyrin exhibited an important electronic push–pull, as first observed in 2009, reported to have an efficiency close to the well-known ruthenium-based dye N719 under similar conditions.14 Modification to the periphery of the porphyrin, often called D–π–A engineering, provides an effective way to separate the photogenerated excitons before their recombination, and led to a record 12% PCE in 2011 for a zinc-doped monomer porphyrin using cobalt-based electrolytes.20 However, this type of electronic push–pull mechanism is absent in inorganic based solar cells, leading to poor PCE performance as charge recombination predominates before separation is achieved.21 Based on the D–π–A framework and Soret band engineering, a Zn-doped porphyrin dye with dialkyl/aryl amines as donors and ethynyl benzoic acid as an acceptor set another benchmark record of a PCE of 13% for DSSCs in 2014 using a cobalt-complex redox mediator.22 However, the record in efficiency was set with the use of a special cobalt-based electrolyte, indicating that further efficiency augmentation is based not only on the porphyrin engineering but also on advances in the redox couple.22 Furthermore, with the inherent limitations of the porphyrin to exhibit a relatively low PCE (10–14%) under standard conditions, the task of improving the PCE beyond 14% underlines the need for also achieving advances in the other components of the DSSC (viz., counter electrodes and working electrodes).5
There are four important components of a working DSSC, namely, the dye (porphyrin/organic based), the semiconductor electrode (working photoelectrode, WPE), the counter electrode (CE), and the redox couple dissolved in a suitable electrolyte. The overall efficiency depends on each of these components; therefore, they need to be investigated individually before their combination to evolve an efficient DSSC device.
A redox couple constitutes one of the key components of a DSSC that helps to transport photogenerated charge carriers across the electrodes. The maximum extractable voltage (Voc) from a DSSC greatly depends on the redox potential of the redox couple chosen and corresponds to the energy difference between the redox potential of the redox couple and the Fermi level of the semiconductor. A selected redox shuttle needs to be matched in energy with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye for the normal working of a DSSC.23 The common redox couples used in DSSCs are iodide/tri-iodide, sulfide/polysulfide and an equimolar mixture of Co2+/Co3+, Fe2+/Fe3+, Ru2+/Ru3+ complexes.20,24,25 Using a state-of-the-art metal-incorporated redox couple in porphyrin based DSSCs, encouraging results (up to 13% PCE) have been reported via the intentional setting of energy profiles (of the dye and redox couple) to achieve a higher Voc value.5,20,22,26 Using this strategy, a Fe2+/Fe3+ complex (bipyridyl) exhibiting readily exchangeable ligand platform set a record photovoltage of 1.42 V for a DSSC in 2018.27 The state of the electrolyte-containing redox couple, is another concern, which largely decides the long-term applicability and stability of the device. The state varies from liquid, quasi-liquid to solid depending upon the state of the solvents/additives used. For organic based DSSCs, organic solvents (acetonitrile, DMSO, MPN) are preferred, however, they often suffer from leakage and stability issues, so, the use of non-toxic, non-flammable aqueous-based electrolyte or electrolytes trapped in a solid or quasi-solid matrix (gel/hydrogel) has been suggested.28–30 Multi-functional, multi-polymer membranes31 and a surface-modified photo-polymer electrolyte membrane32 (PEM) with tailored surface characteristics have been demonstrated to be promising solid electrolytes in DSSCs.
The assembly of electrodes is another important component of DSSCs. This includes a working photoelectrode (WPE) and a counter electrode (CE). A WPE is a dye impregnated semiconductor layer, deposited over a conducting glass plate. Upon illumination, the dye molecule excites and injects photogenerated charge carriers from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of a dye to the conduction band (CB) of a semiconductor, traveling further to the external circuit via the conducting base. To compensate for this, the hole in the HOMO of the dye is filled up via the oxidation of a redox species in the electrolyte. For injection to occur, the energy profile of the semiconductor and the dye should match (ECB < Edye-LUMO). A better performing DSSC needs a crystalline, wide band gap semiconductor with a nano/mesoporous surface area to ensure good dye loading and charge transport. The most commonly used wide band gap semiconductors are ZnO, NiO, TiO2, BaSnO3, Zn2SnO4 and SrTiO3.33,34 Among them, a Zn2SnO4 based WPE has shown the highest ∼28% incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs (not overall efficiency).35 Recently, a barium titanate based perovskite material (BaSnO3, Eg ∼ 3.2 eV) exhibited 6–7% PCE in a DSSC owing to its high dye absorption rate (towards N719), high electron mobility and the presence of numerous defect sites, which facilitate charge transfer in DSSCs. However, the persistence of issues such as phase purity and incomplete phase conversion limits their use.34,36 WPEs based on TiO2 are still preferred owing to their non-toxicity, low cost, ready availability and eco-friendly nature.22,33 Another electrode of a DSSC is the counter electrode (CE), which assists in the transfer of electrons from the external circuit back to the redox couple via the electrolyte medium. The CE is responsible for the regeneration of redox species and the completion of the circuit. The most common CE used in DSSCs is platinum, but owing to its scarcity, high cost and lack of stability, other materials such as alloys, carbon materials, conductive oxides, polymers and transition metal chalcogenides have been developed.37 Among them, a meso/nano-porous organic polymer (PCE – 7%),29 carbon black (PCE – 8.4% with N719)38 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs, PCE – 7.8%)39 have exhibited good and stable PCE performance due to their good electron transfer kinetics and stability compared to those of their platinum counterparts.40 Recently, a high performing CE based on heterogeneous FeNi3/nickel ferrite nanoparticles decorated on a graphene network was developed as a stable and low cost, electrocatalyst CE for organic-based DSSCs, demonstrating a 12.14% PCE versus 8.3% with platinum.41
The dye, a basic component of a DSSC, is considered as the ‘heart’ of the device, and therefore needs to be carefully designed for maximum performance. The design and engineering of porphyrins, in general, involves the following popular strategies: (i) attaching donor or acceptor groups at meso or β positions,22,42–44 or attaching spacers such as alkyl chains at the ends,8,19,45 called Soret band reshuffling (in the absence of an acceptor molecule, the porphyrin moiety itself behaves as an acceptor); (ii) attaching a donor and acceptor to opposite ends of porphyrins,46 (D–π–A engineering, to allow efficient charge separation); (iii) metalation of free porphyrin with zinc,47 direct fusion of porphyrins18 or attaching two or more porphyrin rings with appropriate spacer molecules,10,14 or the introduction of a π-extended chromophore (conjugation extension) on the porphyrin ring9,10,48,49 (to reshuffle the band gap and to enhance the absorption profile); (iv) attaching an appropriate anchoring group at the edge of the dye50,51 (to link the dye with a semiconductor for electronic communication); (v) modifications to the base structure of the porphyrin, e.g. replacement of N by S or linking of the carbon chain to N in the porphyrin core52 (causes subtle changes in the electronic properties of the dye) and (vi) attaching multiple anchoring groups at the edges of the dye53–55 (to prevent the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and quenching of the photovoltaic effect). The ease in design and engineering, besides other advantages such as non-toxicity, low cost, etc., have made this archetypal molecule popular for the renaissance of third generation solar cells.56,57
Although porphyrin exhibits an efficiency of more than 13% in DSSCs, the commercialization of devices still needs to address related issues such as severe aggregation, long-term stability, toxicity, volatility and leakage of the solvents and the use of numerous additives (such as hole scavengers, efficiency enhancers, stabilizing agents, anti-aggregating agents, dopants, etc.). The latter makes the DSSC a ‘chemical generator’ rather than an ‘electricity generator’.58
In view of these issues, we propose a facile synthesis of a dyad by coupling two porphyrin moieties via 1,4-di(4-amidostyryl)benzene functionalized with a benzimidazole moiety to serve as an electron accepting spacer, while the periphery of the porphyrins is entangled at the meso positions with carboxyl functionalized benzimidazolium serving as a donor to evolve a D–π–A system. A strong electronic push–pull mechanism between the extensively conjugated spacer (acceptor) and six serving carboxylate moieties is expected to alter the electronic and optical profiles of the dyad besides resulting in effective charge separation. The strategy to incorporate six carboxylate groups per dyad molecule is expected to provide better electronic coupling via six-fold tethering to TiO2, leading to excellent stability against aggregation. In this article, we emphasize the use of a metal-free porphyrin dyad, TiO2 semiconductor, and aqueous iodide–tri-iodide based electrolyte with no additives to evolve a simple, green, true energy generator device.

2.2 Electrode preparation

2.2.1 Slurry preparation. 
A slurry of titanium dioxide and CNTs dispersed in NMP solvent was used to obtain the TiO2/FTO and CNT/FTO films respectively. The titanium dioxide and CNTs (100 mg each) were dispersed separately in 5 ml of NMP solvent under sonication for 30 min.


2.2.2 Dyad solution preparation. 
The dyad solution was prepared by sonicating 0.1 M dye in NMP solvent for 1 h.


2.2.3 Electrodes and film fabrication. 
2.2.3.1 Preparation of electrodes for DSSCs. 
FTO glass slides (80% transmittance) were used to prepare dyad/TiO2/FTO and CNT/FTO electrodes. The FTO slides were cleaned by sonicating them successively in deionised water, ethyl alcohol and acetone each for a period of 30 min. To prepare TiO2/FTO, a cleaned glass slide was coated with a slurry of TiO2 using the Doctor blade technique59 and subsequently annealed in an oven under vacuum at 200 °C. To prepare a dyad/TiO2/FTO photoanode, a TiO2/FTO film was sensitized with the dyad by dipping it in a dyad solution for 4–8 h and subsequently drying it in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h. Similarly, a cathode electrode was prepared by coating a cleaned FTO glass slide with a dispersion of CNTs followed by the removal of solvent at 200 °C in an oven under vacuum. A 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 workable area of the photoanode was used for DSSC measurements.
2.2.3.2 Preparation of electrodes and electrolytes for cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 
For CV and EIS measurements, a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) (active area 0.7 cm2) sensitised with the dyad was used. A layer of dyad was deposited on a clean GCE by dipping it in a slurry of dyad in NMP and subsequently drying it at 100 °C in an oven under vacuum. A platinum wire and a homemade Ag/Ag+ electrode in ethanol were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (NBu4PF6) in DMF was used as an electrolyte. All solutions were purged with dry nitrogen (N2) gas before measurements were carried out.

2.3 Characterization techniques
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the dyad were recorded in DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 on a Bruker spectrometer operating at 400 MHz using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the dyad was carried out in the range of 30–800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere on a thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) SII thermoanalyzer, 7200 (Seiko, Japan). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the dyad, dyad/TiO2/FTO and CNT/FTO were recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR spectrophotometer using the KBr pellet method. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements were carried out at 77 K (liquid N2) using a Quanta chrome nova-1000 instrument analyser. Specific surface area, average pore diameter and pore volume were measured from N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Before analysis, samples were degassed at 250 °C for 5 h under vacuum for the removal of moisture and unwanted adsorbents. CV and EIS measurements were performed using an Auto-Lab electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT204) in DMF solvent containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as an electrolyte across a potential window of −2.0 to 1.2 V. A three-electrode configuration consisting of a GCE as the working electrode, Ag/Ag+ (non-aqueous) as a reference electrode and platinum (Pt) wire as the counter electrode was used. The scan rates were set as 0.025, 0.050, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 V s−1. Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) was used to investigate the photoelectrochemical performance of the DSSC. The surface morphology and compositional analysis of the electrode materials used for the DSSC were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Carl Zeiss EVO-18) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectrometer. The data measurements were performed within the instrumental error limits of the respective instruments.
2.4 DSSC device fabrication and methodology
A special homemade square cell with dimensions of 3 cm (l) × 3 cm (b) × 4 cm (h) with a flat surface was used to make a DSSC device. The photoanode (dyad/TiO2/FTO) and the cathode (CNT/FTO), each with a surface area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 were dipped in a 30 ml aqueous solution of electrolyte containing an aqueous iodide–tri iodide redox shuttle (0.05 M KI, 0.01 M I2) to form a DSSC. The rest of the area of both electrodes was masked using M3 adhesive tape. The distance between the electrodes was kept at ∼2 cm. The cell was kept in the dark for 1 h to establish an equilibrium between the electrodes and electrolyte before the actual measurements were carried out. All measurements were conducted using a xenon light source with an input power of 100 mW cm−2. The source was calibrated using a standard Lux-meter (Meco). An Auto Lab electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT204) in linear scan mode (LSV) was used to acquire the data. The leads supplied with the instrument were used for electrical connection purposes. The stability and accuracy of the DSSC were checked by the setting up of five experimental devices. The efficiency was found to be stable (within the experimental error of 1%) for 25 cycles studied at the experimental level (under controlled temperature of the electrolyte, not exceeding 50 °C).
2.5 Synthesis of dyad-CPDCFBM (3B)
A series of substitution reactions were carried out to obtain various intermediate and final products, as displayed in Scheme 1.

2.5.1 Synthesis of 1,4-phenylene bis(ethene-2,1-diyl)dianiline: (1A). 
Divinyl benzene (DVB) was destabilized by repeated washing with 1% of NaOH followed by water. The organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate for 4–5 h. The product (1A) was obtained by reacting 4-bromoaniline with DVB in a 2:1 ratio. Typically, carbon–carbon coupling (Heck reaction) of 4-bromoaniline (13.7 g: 80 mmol) and DVB (5.20 ml; 40 mmol) in ethanol as a solvent was carried out in a 100 ml beaker under 5 W light-emitting diode (LED) white light (a source of UV-vis light) for 24 h at ambient temperature, as described by Bhansali et al.60 The obtained red coloured product was shaken in a separating funnel with a mixture of ethyl acetate and saturated solution of NaCl in a 1:1 ratio. The product dissolved in the organic layer leaving behind unreacted reagents in the aqueous phase. Traces of water in the organic layer were removed by adding anhydrous sodium sulphate to it for 3–4 h. Finally, the sodium sulphate was filtered off and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum using a rotary evaporator to obtain a red coloured liquid of 1A (10 ml, 44%).

The second step involved the functionalization of 1A with chloroacetyl chloride to produce the intermediate 1B. In a 50 ml round-bottom flask, 2 g of NaOH was dissolved in an adequate quantity of water. To this clear solution, 1A (10 g; 22 mmol) was added and stirred magnetically to obtain a homogenous suspension. The flask was then placed in a freezing mixture (ice and salt) and after keeping it at low temperature, chloroacetyl chloride (4.95 g; 44 mmol) was added dropwise, carefully in such a way that the temperature did not exceed 5 °C. After complete addition, the magnetic stirring of the reaction mixture was continued for 44–48 h.61 Finally, the sticky green coloured product was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove unreacted reactants and dried in an oven at 110 °C for 2–3 h. The product was recrystallized using ethanol to get obtain 1B (6 g, 52%).

2.5.3 Synthesis of 5-(chloromethyl)-2-hydroxy benzaldehyde: (2A). 
A chloromethylated salicylaldehyde intermediate (2A) was prepared by reacting salicylaldehyde with formaldehyde. A 200 ml conc. HCl solution, taken up in a 500 ml round-bottom flask was stirred for 5 min in an ice bath. To this, 37% formaldehyde (36 ml, 402.1 mmol) was added dropwise with stirring. The stirring was then continued for a further 10 minutes. Finally, salicylaldehyde (30 ml, 288 mmol) was added with continuous stirring. After 48 h, the excess acid from the product was removed by washing it with water using a decantation technique.62 The product was recrystallized from n-hexane solvent to obtained a white solid of 2A (9 g 44%).

1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 10.92 (s, 1H), 10.27 (s, 1H), 7.71 (s, 1H). 7.27 (d, 1H, J = 1.95 Hz), 7.58 (dd,1H, J = 8.95, 2.30), 7.03 (d, 1H, J = 8.48 Hz), 4.75 (s, 2H) [see Fig. S5 in the ESI†].

2.5.4 Synthesis of 5-((1H-benzoimidazole-1-yl)methyl)-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: (2B). 
A 60% dispersion of sodium hydride in paraffin oil, (2.64 g; 110 mmol) was mixed under stirring with n-hexane in a 250 ml two-neck round-bottom flask. The paraffin oil dissolved in n-hexane was removed via decantation and finally, any traces of n-hexane were removed via air drying. To this, benzimidazole (13.8 g; 118 mmol), dissolved in 40 ml of THF was added slowly. After addition, the flask fitted with a condenser was heated in an oil bath at 60 °C under continuous stirring. After around 2 h, 2A (20 g; 118 mmol), dissolved in 40 ml of THF was charged slowly into the reaction mixture under reflux conditions. After 44–48 h, a dark brown viscous product was obtained by evaporating the THF solvent from the organic layer using a rotary evaporator. The crude product was shaken with a mixture of ethyl acetate and brine solution in a separating funnel to separate the unreacted reactants from the product. The separated organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate for 3–4 h, and the solvent was then evaporated to obtain the product.63 This product was then further washed with diethyl ether under magnetic stirring for 2–4 h to obtain a fine yellowish powder of 2B (14 g, 44%).

1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 10.78 (s, 1H), 10.22 (s, 1H), 8.40 (s, 1H), 7.63 (s, 2H), 7.51 (s, 2H), 7.19 (s, 3H), 6.97 (d, 1H, J = 8.35Hz), 5.44 (s, 1H) [see Fig. S7 in the ESI†].

2.5.5 Synthesis of 3-(-2-carboxyethyl)-1-(-3-formyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-1H-benzoimidazole-3-ium: (2C). 
This step involves the functionalization of the benzimidazole nitrogen with 3-bromopropionic acid to obtain 2C. In this reaction, 2B (13 g, 51.6 mmol) was dissolved in 40 ml of chloroform in a 100 ml round-bottom flask, and to this, 3-bromopropionic acid (7.84 g, 51.6 mmol) was added and the mixture was refluxed at 60 °C. After 44–48 h, a viscous yellow liquid product was obtained by evaporating the solvent from the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator64 (3.7 g, 22%).

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Dyad (CPDCFBM, 3B) characterization
The as-prepared dyad has a carboxylate tethered substituted benzimidazole moiety attached at the meso position of both the porphyrins at three sites, while the extended π conjugated spacer (3A) joins both porphyrin moieties at the remaining meso position. The FT-IR spectra of the intermediate 1B (black) and 3A (red) are shown in Fig. 1(a). The FT-IR spectrum of 1B shows a broad band between 3200 and 3300 cm−1 corresponding to stretching vibrations of the amino groups. The peak at 740 cm−1 represents a characteristic C–Cl stretching frequency. The formation of 3A from 1B was confirmed by the disappearance of the C–Cl band in the FT-IR spectrum of 3A, indicating the conversion of C–Cl to a C–N bond. The incorporation of a hydroxyl group in 3A results in the introduction of a broad peak in the region of 3100 to 3400 cm−1 along with peaks due to aromatic aldehydes in the 1400 to 1600 cm−1 range, indicating the entwining of benzimidazole with salicylaldehyde. The FT-IR spectrum of CPDCFBM (3B) is shown in Fig. 1(b). It exhibits a characteristic band at 1692 cm−1 due to carboxylic groups located at the periphery of the porphyrin dimer.67 A broad peak in the range of 3200 to 3500 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching of amino (N–H) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups. The bands at 1258 (C–N) and 1395 cm−1 correspond to N–H and CN, confirming the formation of CPDCFBM (3B) [see Fig. S15 in the ESI†].
The thermal stability of the dyad was explored via TGA analysis. Fig. 1(c) displays a thermogram of the dyad. An initial 6.59% weight loss can be observed in the thermogram, which begins at 101 °C, attributed to the loss of physiosorbed moisture from the dyad. The desorbed dyad shows thermal stability up to 205 °C, thereafter, it rapidly decomposes up to 500 °C, registering a total weight loss of 47.55%. This loss can be ascribed to the degradation of the benzimidazole moiety. Beyond 500 °C, a continuous but slow loss up to 800 °C is observed, accounting for the systematic degradation of remaining porphyrin moieties.
The surface area and pore size analysis of 3B was performed using BET theory, and Fig. 1(d and e) show the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution, respectively. The nature of the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm is clearly recognized to be type II (or type IV), suggesting the mesoporous pore texture of the dyad (3B). The analysis gave a pore size of 0.713 nm and a high surface area of 500.335 cc g−1 with a pore volume of 1.045 cc g−1.
3.2 UV-vis studies
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of porphyrin exhibits several characteristic, recognizable transitions comprising Q bands in the visible region (490–650 nm), Soret or B bands in the near-UV (400–436 nm) and N, L and M bands in the deep UV regions (200–350 nm). Metal-free porphyrin shows four Q (I, II, III, IV) bands while a metallised porphyrin exhibits only two Q (α,β) bands. The Q bands are considered as being the most sensitive bands to the environment of the porphyrin.68 A typical proto-porphyrin exhibits moderate intensity Q bands at 506, 541, 576 and 605 nm and a strong, narrow B band at around 400 nm. Fig. 2(a) displays the UV-vis spectrum of the designed dyad. It shows the presence of four broad Q bands and a strong Soret band. The peaks that can be identified as medium intensity Q bands are at 427, 519, 833, and 855 nm and there is also a strong Soret band. The broadening of the Q bands indicates strong electronic coupling between the two porphyrin rings in the dyad via the linker.5 The strong red shifting of the Q bands and strong blue shifting of the Soret band (∼150 nm) can be observed. The bathochromic shifting of the Q bands is due to the basic nature of the benzimidazole moiety, which easily donates non-bonding electrons present on the N atom, thus requiring less energy for transitions to occur.69 The π-conjugation and dimerization on the dyad also helps to change the electron density distribution on the porphyrin, decreasing the HOMO–LUMO gap.56,70,71Fig. 2(b) shows a normalised low energy band to calculate the E0–0 energy (band gap). Steady-state absorption spectroscopy was used to calculate the energy of the band gap. According to the measurements, the dependence of the absorption coefficient near the absorption edge on the photon energy is given by the equation:72 (αhν) = (hν − Eg)n(1)where α is the absorption coefficient of the absorbing material, I0 and It are the intensities of the incident and transmitted light, respectively, hν is the photon energy, Eg is the band gap of the material and n depends upon the types of transition involved. It takes a value of ½ for a direct allowed type band gap and 2 for indirect allowed (transition). The direct bandgap is estimated from the extrapolation of the linearity (after divergence) of the (ahν)2vs. (hν) plot to the x-axis (Fig. 2(c)). The gap was estimated as 1.42 eV, which is lower than that of free porphyrin (∼2.0 eV) due to the strong bathochromic shift, as expected. In the case of porphyrin, zero-zero energy (E0–0) between the ground and the excited electronic state in the lowest vibrational level corresponds to a band gap (Eg). A similar type of band gap lowering (1.16 eV) was observed by Zhang et al. due to the extensive conjugation via a naphthoquinodimethane bridge between porphyrin dimers.71

3.3 Characterization of the photoelectrode
The FT-IR spectra of the pure dyad and dyad adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface are displayed in Fig. 3, recorded in order to establish the anchoring ability of the dyad to TiO2. The FT-IR spectrum of the dyad (Fig. 3, black) exhibits a characteristic absorption band at around 1694 cm−1, which corresponds to the ν(CO) stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group. In the FT-IR spectrum of dyad/TiO2 (Fig. 3, black), the absorption band due to ν(CO) has completely disappeared, whereas a significant increase in intensity is observed for the symmetric νsym(COO–) and asymmetric νasym(COO–) stretching frequencies of the carboxylate group at 1406 and 1642 cm−1, respectively. The disappearance of ν(CO) and the increased intensity of νsym(COO–) and νasym(COO–) indicates that a proton is detached from the carboxylic acid group during the adsorption of the porphyrin onto the TiO2 surface, leading to strong binding and electronic coupling of the dyad to the TiO2 surface through carboxylate groups.67

3.4 CV studies
CV is a popular method for estimating the standard electrochemical redox potentials (E0) of the molecular species. A strong correlation of E0 with the energy levels of frontier orbitals (HOMO, LUMO) and the band edge defines the invaluable importance of CV for electronic characterization of molecules.73,74 The half-wave potentials (E1/2) are the preferred representation for E0 for the reversible reduction and oxidation processes. The usual way to obtain E0 is to take average between the anodic (Ea) and the cathodic (Ec) peak potentials from voltammograms manifesting reversibility. However, a more accurate method involves the use of inflection potentials (Eia and Eic) instead of half-wave peak potentials. This method is applicable for estimating E0 for irreversible/semi-reversible/quasi-irreversible (i.e., chemically reversible but electrochemically irreversible) and oxidation/reduction processes exhibiting a slower rate of interfacial electron transfer than mass transport.74 We adopted this method to estimate E0 for the oxidation and reduction processes. The CV measurements were performed in DMF solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (NBu4PF6) using a dyad-GCE as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ (in ethanol) as a reference electrode. A ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal standard. The standard redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was calculated at +87 mV using a Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3) electrode in DMF containing 0.1 M NBu4PF6 electrolyte.75Fig. 4 shows the voltammograms of the dyad measured at different scan rates (0.025 to 0.9 V s−1) in the potential window of −2.75 to 1.0 V at 25 °C under the purging of N2 gas. The voltammogram exhibits two anodic peaks (positive voltage), the first peak corresponding to the oxidation of ferrocene and the second peak due to the slow oxidation of porphyrin moieties. The second peak exhibited its reversibility only at higher scan rates (300–900 mV s−1) as the electron transfer kinetics match the higher scanning rate. The negative side (negative voltage) of the voltammogram clearly displays three reversible cathodic peaks. The first peak corresponds to the reduction of ferrocene, the other two peaks correspond to the stepwise reduction of the di-cationic porphyrin moieties in the dyad. A small peak observed at low scan rates (at ∼−0.75 V) may be attributed to the feeble reduction of the benzimidazole moieties, this peak, however, disappears at a higher scan rate. A similar peak at a potential of −0.1 V exhibits a high peak-to-peak separation due to unknown impurities. The quasi reversible oxidation wave exhibits an inflection potential of 0.56 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) corresponding to ground-state oxidation potentials (+0.858 V vs. saturated calomel electrode, SCE) and represents the HOMO levels of the dyad. The first irreversible reduction wave of the dyad exhibits an inflection potential of −1.22 V vs. Ag/Ag+ (−0.922 V vs. SCE), corresponding to the excited state (reduction) potential and represents the LUMO energy of the dyad. The second irreversible reduction potential involves the reduction of a mono anion to obtain a dyad. The energies of the LUMO and HOMO levels (vs. SCE) can be calculated using the empirical equations:76 EHOMO = −[E1oxvs.ferrocene + 4.988] eV(2) ELUMO = −[E1redvs.ferrocene + 4.988] eV(3)where Eox and Ered are the first oxidation potential and the first reduction potential of the dyad respectively, and −4.988 eV is the reference value of the Fc/Fc+ redox potential. Accordingly, the HOMO and LUMO of the porphyrin dimer were calculated as −5.841 and −4.066 eV (vs. SCE), respectively. The exhibition of a single quasi reversible oxidation potential (positive voltage) suggests strong electronic coupling between the two porphyrin moieties via the extensive conjugation between them, giving a good HOMO level corresponding to the single ground states of the dyads.77 The difference in the HOMO and LUMO gaps calculated from CV measurements corresponds to the band gap of the dye. This value (1.71 eV) is somewhat higher than the E0–0 energy gap (1.42 eV) calculated from the UV-vis absorption spectra. This deviation possibly occurs due to the presence of multiple excited states in the organic molecules.78Table 1 displays the data obtained from CV curves and those calculated from the UV-vis spectrum along with the calculated electron injection and regeneration energies.

3.5 SEM characterization of the electrode
The surface morphology and composition of the dyad/TiO2/FTO and CNT/FTO were obtained using a SEM instrument attached to an EDAX probe. Fig. 5(a) depicts the SEM of the TiO2/FTO film. An aggregation of spherical nanoparticles producing colloids of around 300 nm in size can be clearly observed. This is often called a mesoporous morphology, which is highly desirable for efficient dye absorption and enhancing photochemical reactions. Fig. 5(b) shows a SEM image of the TiO2/FTO surface coated with the dyad, obtained via dip coating. The process involves dipping the TiO2 in a dyad colloidal solution for 4 h followed by solvent evaporation and annealing. The dyad/TiO2/FTO SEM image clearly exhibits an almost similar type of mesoporous morphology to that of bare TiO2/FTO, except for an increase in the colloidal size. This is expected as the dyad forms a uniform sheath over the TiO2 surface via strong bonding between multiple carboxylic acid groups with the TiO2 mesoporous surface,67 leading to a non-planar covering of the dyad over TiO2. This leads to an increase in the size of the crystallites as observed. The strong linking of the dyad with TiO2 helps to prevent dyad aggregation, which otherwise hampers the long term applicability of a DSSC.79 The EDAX of the bare dyad [see Fig. S16 in the ESI†] exhibits peaks corresponding to C, N and O, while the dyad coated on the TiO2 surface [see Fig. S17 in the ESI†] displays the peaks related to Ti, O and C only, indicating the formation of a dyad layer on the TiO2 surface (the N peaks are not observable due to relatively low concentration). Fig. 5(c) displays the surface morphology of the counter electrode used. CNTs with an average size of 40 nm and length of around 400 to 450 nm, composed in a bunch and dispersed on the FTO surface, were observed. The film texture is highly porous, exhibiting a high surface area upon which to execute counter reactions promptly.

3.6 Photoelectrochemical studies
A schematic of the processes involved during the working of a DSSC device is displayed in Fig. 6. A dye is a crucial part of the DSSC device. A chosen dye must have optimal band gap (∼1.2 to 1.8 eV – to absorb maximum a maximum amount of solar energy), a higher frontier orbital (LUMO) energy than the conduction band energy of the semiconductor (ECB < Edye-LUMO) (to inject the excited charges easily) and a lower HOMO energy of the dye than the redox potential of the redox couple (Eredox > Edye-HOMO) (for quick regeneration of redox couple) to function as an energy generator.1
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation exhibiting the important processes of a DSSC marked with the potential scale vs. SCE (on the right side). 
The photovoltaic properties of the metal-free dyad on the TiO2 surface were evaluated under 100 mW cm−2 illumination in 0.05 M KI, 0.01 M I2 electrolyte using an Auto Lab electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT204). We performed the measurements using a well-behaved redox system containing no additives. So far, additives such as guanidinium thiocyanate, 4-tert-butylpyridine, etc., have been used in almost all literature as efficiency boosters, that work via the shuffling of Fermi levels or assist to scavenge holes rapidly. Chenodeoxycholic acid, CDCA, is often used as an aggregation inhibitor. All these additives, however, make the DSSC unlikely to be stable over time, because of the various oxidation processes involving them, distracting the purpose of the ‘electricity generator’ towards a ‘chemical generator’.58
The measurements were performed on five similar DSSC devices. All of them exhibited a PCE in the range of 6.78 to 7.01%, with an average of 6.9%. The observed variations are probably due to uncertainties in exposing the exact 0.25 cm2 area of the photoanode to illumination. Fig. 7 shows the IV data obtained for a fabricated DSSC.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage (CV) plot of the DSSC in iodine electrolyte under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. 
The IV curve (Fig. 7) displays the open circuit photovoltage, 0.610 V (Voc), and the short circuit current density, 14.8 mA cm−2 (Jsc), furnishing a maximum obtainable power of 0.0069 W (under the square) and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76. The conversion efficiency of the DSSC device was calculated as 6.9%. We observed a diminishing in the PCE by around 10% with the heating up of the electrolyte solution to 50–55 °C due to prolonged irradiation (heating effect). At this stage, cooling of the device to room temperature was found to regain the same PCE reversibly without any notable change in the successive 25 cycles studied, indicating the appreciable stability of the dyad and also that of the photoelectrode. However, the heating effects beyond 80 °C lead to a more than 50% loss in the PCE, probably due to un-estimated deteriorations in the electrolyte or electrode surfaces.
To assess the stability of the dyad against aggregation, we performed DSSC measurements on the dyad for different sensitization times (4, 8, and 10 h). The data shows no appreciable variations (>2%) in the DSSC performance, indicating good stability of the dyad against aggregation.48 The annealing of the dyad electrode was observed to be crucial in obtaining a stable PCE. The annealed dyad exhibits much better and stable performance than the unannealed dyad. The lowering of the performance may be attributed to poor electronic linking of the dyad to the TiO2 surface. The annealing ensures firm chemisorption of the dyad via strong carboxylate bonding, in addition to hydrogen bonding, leading to better electronic coupling between the dye and the semiconductor.
The synthesized metal-free dyad exhibited an encouraging PCE of 6.9% and better stability against aggregation in a true energy generating DSSC (without any additives). After careful searching of the literature, we found no exact match for the dyad we synthesized to compare with. Although a huge amount of literature is available on monomeric, zinc-doped porphyrin dyes, only a few reports are available for metal-free dimeric versions. A similar type of metal-free dimer, available in the literature was reported to have a PCE of 2.86% for a conjugated meso Schiff-base substituted metal-free porphyrin with thienyl or p-methylphenyl functional groups.10 Some of Zn-doped dimers have been reported to have efficiencies of lower than 6.9%, for example, a 1,3,5-triazine bridged Zn-doped porphyrin dimer (5.28%),67 an acetylene bridged Zn doped-porphyrin dimer with multiple electron donating groups (6.21%),42meso–meso directly linked Zn-doped porphyrin dimers tethered at β positions with 2-propenoic/2,4-pentadienoic acids and polyethylene glycol (4.2%),80 a Zn-doped meso–meso directly linked porphyrin dimer based on a double D–π–A sensitizer (5.33%)81 and a Zn-doped porphyrin trimer linked with acetylene at the meso position (4.17%).82 However, a few reports exist on Zn-doped porphyrin dyads reporting PCEs of ∼10%, wherein, the long-lived singlet excited state exists and fast injection dynamics lead to high PCEs.49,77 These dyes set excellent examples of Soret band and D–π–A porphyrin engineering.16

Table 2 displays a summary of the reported performance of DSSCs employing dimer sensitizers with our metal free dyad. Herein, the data on undoped/doped type dimers are compared with our dyad concerning doping, dimer attachments, number of functional/anchoring groups present, set experimental parameters including additives used, and the obtained result.

The Voc (0.610 V) value obtained for the dyad was found to be commensurate with the theoretical value, which is the difference in energy between the quasi Fermi energy level of TiO2 (−0.450 V SCE) and the Nernst redox potential of the redox couple (0.160 V vs. SCE). Other key energy parameters, such as charge injection energy (ΔGinj) and dye regeneration energy (ΔGreg) have been calculated to ensure feasibility of the important processes in DSSCs. ΔGinj corresponds to the energy difference between the LUMO of the dyad (−0.922 V vs. SCE) and the CB of the TiO2 (−0.750 V vs. SCE), estimated as −0.172 V. A more negative value obtained acts as a driving force for injection of the electrons from the dye molecule to the semiconductor. Similarly, ΔGreg, corresponds to the difference between the HOMO energy of the dyad (+0.858 V vs. SCE) and the redox potential of the redox couple (+0.160 V vs. SCE), estimated as +0.698 V (vs. SCE). A positive value obtained ensures the effective regeneration of the dye molecules in the DSSC. The driving energy parameters, which favour the important thermodynamic processes in DSSCs, are exhibited in Table 1 and are also scaled on the right hand side of Fig. 6 for easy reference.
DSSCs based on monomer porphyrins set a record PCE of ∼13%, their commercialization however, needs further addressing of the issues related to stability against aggregation and ill effects of the numerous additives. Although we got an encouraging PCE of ∼7% and excellent anti-aggregation stability for our novel metal-free dyad under ‘true energy generation’ conditions, we need to improve the PCE further via metalation of the dyad and explore an advance redox couple, electrode materials, etc.
3.7 EIS studies
The EIS measurements of the DSSC exhibit the impedance of the interfacial charge transport, transfer and accumulation processes. The important charge transport occurring in the DSSC includes electron injection in the TiO2, ionic diffusion in the electrolyte solution, charge recombination at the electrode–electrolyte interface, electron transfer at the counter electrode and charging of the capacitive elements in the cell.83 The EIS data is measured under forward bias at Voc (under no current conditions) in the 0.01–100 kHz frequency range under illumination. The data is displayed in the form of Nyquist and Bode plots. A Nyquist plot shows several time constants in terms of semicircles (usually three or less), corresponding to specific charge transfers in the DSSC. A small semicircle in the 0.1 to 1 Hz range indicates the diffusion of electrolyte into the solution with ωD frequency (called the Nernst/Warburg diffusion process), a larger middle semicircle in the 1–1 kHz frequency range represents charge transfer at the working photoelectrode–electrolyte interface and another small semicircle beyond the 1 kHz frequency is associated with charge transfer at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface with characteristic frequency, ωCE.84

Fig. 8(a and b) display the EIS data measured for the DSSC at a forward bias of 0.610 V under illumination in the 0.01–100 kHz frequency range. We identified a middle semicircle in the intermediate frequency range and an incomplete small semicircle in the lowest frequency range converging to a line with a slope of 45° in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 8(a)). The latter accounts for the occurrence of a mixed type process (faradaic charge transfer and mass transfer) across the nonpolarizable electrode–electrolyte interface, called the Warburg impedance (W) and is indicated as the break point in the low frequency region of the Bode plot85 (Fig. 8(b)). The absence of a semicircle in the highest frequency region is an indication of rapid electron exchange between the CE and electrolyte.
 Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plot (Z′′ vs. Z′) exhibiting the time constant for charge transfer and recombination (a semicircle) and Warburg impedance due to ion diffusion (a straight line at low frequency) (an equivalent impedance circuit is shown in the inset) and (b) Bode plot (Z vs. logF) showing inflections corresponding to various impedances. 
The middle circle is associated with the two important charge transfer processes (two frequencies/time constants), the injection of photoexcited electrons from the dye to the TiO2 electrode (ωd) and the back reaction/recombination at the photoelectrode (ωk). The ωd and ωk values were obtained as 95.6 and 9 Hz, from the Bode plot (Fig. 8(b)), as inflection points that appear in the high frequency and low frequency regions, respectively. The ωd and ωk frequencies are associated with two process time constants, τ1 (1/ωd) and τ2 (1/ωk), corresponding to electron transport/diffusion to TiO2 (injection time) and electron back reaction/recombination (lifetime), respectively. τ1–τ2 also represent the charge transport in the semiconductor/injection resistance (Rt) and the charge recombination resistance (Rct), respectively. From the values of ωd and ωk, the two time constants were evaluated to be τ1 = 1.6 ms and τ2 = 17.7 ms. It was found that τ1 < τ2 and Rt < Rct, indicating that the electrons are able to reach the photoelectrode before recombination occurs. This is an important criterion for the functioning of the DSSC as an energy generator.
The transport properties are often summarised through the introduction of the diffusion length (Ln), which is given by: Ln = (τ2Dn)1/2(4)where τ2 is the electron lifetime and Dn is the chemical diffusion coefficient. Dn can be evaluated using the relationship: Dn = d2/τ1(5)where d is the thickness of the TiO2 film. The value of Ln was found to be 13.3 μm, even higher than the thickness of the TiO2 film used (d = 4 μm), meaning that all of the photogenerated charge carriers are statistically collected. The calculated EIS parameters are summarised in Table 3. The higher magnitude of Rct, Ln and τ2 than those of Rt, d and τ2 suggest that the process of electron injection into the TiO2 semiconductor is efficient. The higher Rct observed (meaning less tendency for recombination to occur) can be correlated to the introduction of the benzimidazole moiety, which effectively blocks the close contact of the oxidized electrolytes with the TiO2 surface.86 The long recombination time (τ2 −17.7 ms) observed is comparable with that of a similar type of triazine linked Zn-doped porphyrin dimer (16.1 ms), conveying the excellent charge separation capability of the system.67

The EIS data obtained is usually fitted to an equivalent impedance circuit that models a DSSC. A DSSC with two electrodes dipped in electrolyte is often represented as a solid–liquid interface in terms of the Voigt element (a parallel combination of the charge transfer resistance, Rct, and the double layer capacitance, Cμ). This is augmented by the resistance of the solution (Rs). The charge transfer resistance (Rct) due to a diffusion process, called the diffusion (Warburg) element is put in series to obtain a circuit, called the Randles circuit. Fig. 8(a) (inset) shows a Randles circuit equivalent impedance circuit for a DSSC. The beginning of the Nyquist plot (high frequency arc) corresponds to Rs (50 Ω), and this accounts for the total resistance due to solution, photoelectrode base (FTO sheet) and electrical wiring. In fact, every arc in the Nyquist plot is associated with the corresponding resistance, the values of which can barely be obtained from its diameter. For a semicircle in the middle frequency range (1 to 1 kHz), the maximum of Z′′ appears at the Z′ value (Fig. 8(a)) corresponding to a characteristic charge transfer frequency (ωk). The capacitance of the electrode–electrolyte interface (Cdl) accounts for photoanode chemical capacitance. The total chemical capacitance can be obtained by multiplying it by the thickness of the oxide layer. The calculated equivalent impedance circuit data are displayed in Table 3.
4 Conclusions
We have synthesized and characterized a novel conjugated meso-substituted porphyrin dyad entangled with carboxyl functionalized benzimidazolium moieties (CPDCFBM). A 1,4-di(4-amidostyryl)benzene functionalised with benzimidazole moiety served as a conjugated spacer between the two substituted porphyrin moieties. The photophysical and electrochemical measurements of this novel sensitizer reveal that it has suitable energy levels for efficient electron injection and regeneration processes, when used as a sensitizer for DSSCs. The free base dyad exhibited encouraging PCE values of 6.9% with good anti-aggregation stability, and these results provide new directions and ideas for further improvements.
