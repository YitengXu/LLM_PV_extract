    , Accepted 9th May 2017First published on 10th May 2017AbstractIn the present investigation, hollow and split nanostructures of rutile TiO2 have been synthesized using simple hydrothermal and chemical etching processes. Two typical structures such as TiO2 nanorods and nanoflowers were used as electron transporting layers (ETLs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The optimized nanostructured ETLs were then used for mixed halide PSCs such as methyl ammonium iodide (MAPbI3), methyl ammonium iodide/chloride mixed-halide perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (herein FAPbI3 = formamidinium lead halide and MAPbBr3 = methylammonium lead bromide). The optimized results show a η = 15.87% efficiency (JSC = 20.75 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.034, FF = 0.74) and a η = 17.55% efficiency (JSC = 21.72 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.073, FF = 0.76) for (MAPbI3−xClx) and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, respectively, for etched TiO2 with a split structure.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI3), formamidinium lead halide (FAPbI3), and their different compositions, have attracted great interest due to their excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 22%.1–4 The fabrication technology is much easier than that for traditional silicon photovoltaics and they show a higher power conversion efficiency than that of solution-processed, low-cost solar cells. The electron transporting layer (ETL), hole transporting layer (HTL) and perovskite absorbing layer are the key parameters of PSCs. However, the optimization of these layers is one of the major issues in PSCs.3–8 Therefore recently, n–i–p bi-layered-type PSCs based on one dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as rutile 1D TiO2 have been used with an efficiency of 11.9% (for small area devices) and 10.5% (for large area devices).9–12 Optimization of the unique composition of the perovskite, its deposition and the thickness of each layer, are the key factors of the experimental process for achieving better efficiency. After the breakthrough efficiencies reported by Grätzel et al. (2013),1 Seok et al.,2 and Snaith et al.,3, remarkable research has started once again in PSC technology.13 So far, different aspects have been utilised in order to improve the power conversion efficiency, such as different compositions of perovskite cations and anions, dual-thermal evaporation and lead-free perovskites such as MASnI3−xBrx, (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9, etc.,14–16in situ synthesis, ex situ synthesis, temperature dependent spin coating, solvent-compositional engineering, moisture assisted growth, additives and intramolecular exchange processes (IEPs)13 have been used in order to push the PCE up to 22.0%.17
Metal oxides such as Al2O3,18 NiOx,19 ZnO,20 and graphene/TiO2,21 Zn2SnO4 and Au@TiO2 nanofibers have been used as ETLs.22 Furthermore, rutile TiO2 nanorods10,23 and anodized anatase TiO2 nanotubes have also been used as ETLs.24 Wu et al. used a hydrothermal approach and an etching process to prepare TiO2 with honeycomb nanostructures, which could be used for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with a power conversion efficiency of 6.69%.25 Xiao et al. synthesized nanoporous TiO2/perovskite by an in situ technique and used it in HTM-free PSCs with a PCE of 10.03%.26 Lead (Pb) doped TiO2 nanofibers have previously been synthesized by an electrospinning technique and used in HTM-free PSCs with a 9.03% PCE.27 The layer thickness of the TiO2 ETL was optimized in order to improve performance and demonstrated a PCE of 12.22% for a 0.80 μm thick TiO2 photoanode.28 Recently another ETL, with high electron mobility as in SnO2, was successfully used and demonstrated a 20.8% PCE29 for planar n–i–p type PSCs and 9.19% PCE for rare-earth doped SnO2:(Tb3+, Eu3+) for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).30 Therefore, the fabrication of PSCs based on TiO2 nanostructures and the optimization of the ETL thickness provide a new approach for efficient PSCs.31–36 These nanostructures provide fewer grain boundaries and high crystallinity, which facilitates effective charge separation and collection, and a large surface area. To the best of our knowledge, there are very few reports available on etched TiO2 nanorods or nanoflower/nanowire-based perovskite solar cells. Here, we report a 1D TiO2 nanostructure as an efficient ETL, prepared by a hydrothermal process followed by etching, and used for mixed halide MAPbI3, MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of 1D TiO2 nanorod ETL
Pattern fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) (TEC15, Pilkington) substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in an alkaline, aqueous washing solution and then rinsed with de-ionized water, ethanol and acetone. A ∼40nm thick blocking layer of TiO2 (Bl-TiO2) was deposited on the substrates by spin coating of 0.15 M and 0.3 M commercial titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:39, volume ratio) as a precursor. Subsequently it was annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 nanorods were deposited directly onto the FTO substrate using a technique reported elsewhere.32 Briefly, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was hydrolyzed in equal volumes of HCl:H2O at 180 °C for 3 h. The films were washed several times with water/ethanol and used for further processes. The as-prepared, rutile TiO2 nanorod-coated FTO sample was further used for a secondary hydrothermal process (etching). In a typical experiment, nanorod-coated FTO substrates were immersed in an acidic solution of HCl:H2O (2:1 v:v%) and maintained at 150 °C. The etching time was varied from 0 h (as deposited), 3.0 h, 3.5 h and 4.0 h. After completion of the etching process, the etched TiO2 nanorods were rinsed extensively with de-ionized water and dried in air. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated with a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, rinsed with de-ionized water and dried at 500 °C for 20 min.
2.2 Synthesis of 3D TiO2 nanoflower ETL
To synthesise the TiO2 nanoflowers, titanium(IV) butoxide was hydrolyzed in an equal volume of concentrated HCl (37% Sigma Aldrich) at 180 °C for 3 h.33 After TiO2 nanoflower synthesis, the samples were etched as per the method described above (for 0 h, 3.0 h, 3.5 h and 4.0 h) and used for TiCl4 treatment and then dried at 500 °C for 20 min. Please note that fresh hydrothermal and TiCl4 treatment solutions were prepared before each experiment.
The length, diameter, density and nanostructure of the TiO2 nanorods were optimized via solution concentration and etching time. The amount of TiO2 precursor (TTIP or TBT) was varied from 100 μl to 240 μl and the etching time was varied from 3 h to 4 h at 150 °C, for optimization of efficiency. More details are discussed in Table S1.†
2.3 Preparation of the perovskite MAPbI3 precursors
Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) (i.e. MAPbI3) was synthesized as in previous literature.24 Briefly, hydroiodic acid was added dropwise to a solution of methyl-amine (aqueous, 40 wt%, TCI Chemicals) in an ice bath, and then stirred for 2 h, before the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The resulting white solid product was dried under vacuum overnight at 50 °C. The MAPbI3 solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar amounts of MAI and lead iodide (PbI2) in anhydrous γ-butyrolactone (GBL). The clear, filtered yellow solution was spin coated on top of the 1D or 3D TiO2 samples followed by heat treatment on a hot plate for 10 min to form dark-brown crystalline MAPbI3.
2.4 Synthesis of mixed halide perovskite thin films
For the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite layer, the desired amount of MAI powder was mixed with PbI2/PbCl2 in a GBL/DMF (3:1 v/v) binary solvent and stirred at 60 °C for 12 h. Furthermore, the formamidinium NH2CHNH2I (FAI) was first synthesized by reacting hydroiodic acid and formamidine acetate. (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 was synthesized by reacting the desired amounts of FAI, MABr, PbI2 and PbBr2 powder in DMF/DMSO (4:1 v/v) solution. The filtered, yellow, transparent solution was spin coated on hydrothermally grown and etched TiO2 nanoflower samples. One drop of toluene or chlorobenzene was drop-cast during the second spin-coating step, followed by a heat treatment on a hot plate for 10 min to form a dark-brown, crystalline, compact, pinhole-free perovskite layer.
The hole transport material (HTM) was prepared by a standard procedure reported elsewhere with a few modifications.9 180 mg of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, Merck) was dissolved in 1 ml of chlorobenzene (99.8%, Aldrich) with the addition of 37.5 μl of bis(trifiuoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) (170 mg ml−1) in acetonitrile and 17.5 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich). For the poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)-based HTM, 15 mg of PTAA (EM Index, Mw = 17500 g mol−1) in 1.5 ml of toluene was mixed with 15 μl of LiTFSI (170 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine.34 The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 substrate was coated with a HTM solution, using the spin-coating method at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and evacuated to a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. For the Au counter-electrode, 80 nm thick Au contacts were deposited on the top of the HTM overlayer by thermal evaporation (growth rate of ∼0.5 Å s−1) at a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The active areas of all of the devices were 0.09 cm2.
2.5 Characterizations
The top-surface and cross-sectional images were recorded by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; S-4700, Hitachi). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a D/MAX Ultima III XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a Cu K line of 1.5410 Å. The cells were illuminated using a solar simulator at AM 1.5 G for 10 s, and the light intensity was adjusted using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter to 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 1100 nm, using a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a photoluminescence spectrometer (f = 0.5 m, Acton Research Co., Spectrograph 500i, USA) and an intensified CCD (PI-MAX3) (Princeton Instrument Co., IRY1024, USA). A DPSS (diode pumped solid state) laser (Ekspla), with a wavelength of 266 nm and a power of 310 mW, was utilized as an excitation source for PL measurement.
3. Results and discussion
In the present investigation we have used a simple hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures and have designed hollow nanostructures via an etching process. Recently, Cai et al. synthesized 1D rutile TiO2 nanorods of different lengths via an acid-free route, and these were then used for perovskite solar cells. The author suggested that a 0.7 μm NR-based device shows an 11.1% PCE with a FF = 0.615 and JSC = 18.6 mA cm−2.43 Furthermore, Park et al., reported that in PSCs, shorter TiO2 nanorods are more beneficial in obtaining a high power conversion efficiency than longer ones.9 From these results it is clear that the fill factor (FF) and PCE strongly depend upon the nanorod length. Therefore, in our methodology we have explored the effect of nanorod length and etching time. Highly transparent TiO2 films with different nanorod lengths were deposited with different deposition times and solution concentrations (Fig. 1). More details are explained in the ESI (Fig. S1 and S2†). From Table S1, Fig. S1 and S2†, it is clear that the nanorod length has an almost linear relationship with the precursor concentration. Moreover, the etching time affects the nanorod length and density significantly (ESI Fig. S2 and S3†). In our experiment, there was no deposition of either TiO2 nanorods or nanoflowers as the concentration increased from 10 μl to 120 μl in 20 ml (HCl:H2O v:v%). This may be due to very low concentrations of the titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) precursor. However, in the sample with 140 μl of TTIP in 20 ml (HCl:H2O), a very thin and transparent deposition of TiO2 occurred. Furthermore, we increased the precursor concentration from 180 μl to 240 μl and synthesized nanostructured TiO2 samples, which were used for the etching process (Table S1†). It was also observed that when we used very thin samples (∼400 to 500 nm) for the etching process, even with a 1 h etching time, all of the TiO2 deposit was detached from the FTO substrate. Similar results were observed for titanium butoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4) (TBT) samples. More detailed study of the concentration, deposition time, reaction temperature and etching time would be exhaustive, therefore, we have varied only three combinations: TiO2 nanorods of 300–500 nm in length, TiO2 nanorods (TBT) of 300–500 nm in length and TiO2 nanoflowers of 500–800 nm in diameter (ESI S3†).
 Fig. 1  The effect of etching time on TiO2 nanostructures. All samples were deposited at 150 °C for 3 h and then etched at 150 °C for different time periods. (a) FESEM images of the TiO2 nanorods obtained from the TTIP precursor and etched for different periods of time, (b) FESEM images of TiO2 nanorods prepared from TBT precursor and etched for different periods of time, (c) FESEM images of TiO2 nanowires, and (d) FESEM images of etched TiO2 nanoflowers. All scale bars are 500 nm. 

Fig. 1 shows the FESEM images of TiO2 nanorods and nanoflowers etched for different time periods. These nanostructures were deposited at a low concentration (200 μl TTIP and TBT) and the deposition temperature was 180 °C, for 3 h. Please note that the etching temperature was kept fixed at 150 °C. While the TiO2 nanorods that were etched for 3 h showed a hollow tube-like morphology, as we increased the etching time from 3 h to 3.5 h, the hollow nanostructures were further etched and split into small, secondary TiO2 nanorods, with diameters ranging from 40–60 nm (Fig. 1(a)and S4†). This split nanostructure provides a higher inner surface area than hollow nanostructures. The sample etched for 4 h showed that the TiO2 was dissolved in etching solvent. Only a few nanorods remained on the FTO substrate. This may be due to the short length of the TiO2 nanorods.
Short nanorods prepared from TBT (220 μl) precursor and etched for 3 h showed well-formed hollow nanostructures with inner diameters of 80 nm (Fig. 1(b)). The 3 h etching time sample shows randomly distributed, short TiO2 nanorods throughout the substrate. When the etching time was further increased to 3.5 h, the sample showed that these hollow nanotubes split into nanowires with an average diameter of 30–40 nm. Fig. 1(c) shows FESEM images of TiO2 nanowire arrays prepared from TBT precursor. The as-deposited sample shows diameter of ∼90–120 nm, which were further reduced to 60–70 nm after 3 h of etching. The sample etched for 3.5 h shows an aligned TiO2 nanowire-like morphology with diameter of ∼30–40 nm, however, the TiO2 nanowire sample etched for 4 h shows bulk, randomly oriented, shorter TiO2. Fig. 1(d) shows FESEM images of TiO2 nanoflowers etched for different time durations. The sample etched for 3 h shows hollow nanostructures with diameters of ∼80–100 nm. When the etching time was increased to 3.5 h, the hollow nanoflowers were converted into nanowire flowers. However, 4 h of etching caused the nanowire nanoflowers to collapse and randomly oriented nanorods were formed. We used these nanostructures for fabrication of MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells. In this process, we deposited MAPbI3 from GBL solution via a solvent engineering route. One drop of toluene was added during the second-step spin coating.17
The etched TiO2 nanorods were further analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2(a–d) show TEM images of etched TiO2 nanorods, which confirms that the etched nanoflowers are also single-crystalline and defect-free. The spotted SAED pattern depicts the single-crystalline nature of etched TiO2 nanorods. The lattice spacing of d001 = 0.29 nm along the longitudinal axis direction pertains to the d-spacing of rutile TiO2 (001) crystal planes. The calculated lattice spacing parallel to the side wall is d110 = 0.32 nm, in accordance with the (110) planes of rutile phase TiO2. During the secondary hydrothermal process, concentrated HCl plays an important role in the formation of the hollow nanostructures.35–42 It acts as a surface etchant of TiO2, leading to more reactive side etching in the (001) direction. It is well known that the dissolution rate in the long-axis (001) direction is much faster than that in the side-wall direction. In order to analyze this in depth, we have recorded the surface area of the as-deposited and etched TiO2 nanorods. The XRD pattern of etched TiO2 nanorods revealed the rutile phase of TiO2 (Fig. 2(e)). It is also noted that the crystallinity of the etched nanorods is intact. Fig. 2(f) shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves of the as-deposited and chemically etched TiO2 nanorods. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the as-deposited TiO2 nanorods is 46.5 m2 g−1, which increases to 105 m2 g−1 for etched hollow TiO2 nanorods. From the above discussion it is clear that the highly crystalline, etched TiO2 nanorod samples provide a high surface area, which is beneficial for effective charge separation from the perovskite absorber.

Fig. S3† shows typical cross sectional FESEM images of perovskite devices (note that Au contact is not shown in these devices). The device configuration is FTO/Bl-TiO2/etched (or bare) TiO2 nanostructures + MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD. Fig. S3(a–c)† shows the cross sectional FESEM images of etched TiO2 nanoflowers, however, nanoflower morphology is not clearly seen in these samples. This may be due to irregular growth of the TiO2 nanoflowers and nanorods. The samples etched for 3 h and 3.5 h show TiO2 of 435 nm and 335 nm in length (Fig. S3b and c†) (for further optimization of different nanorod lengths and etching please check Fig. S3†). Fig. S3(d–f)† shows the TiO2 nanowires deposited from 180 μl of TBT precursor and etched for 3.0 and 3.5 h. Obviously, as-deposited TiO2 showed a broader nanorod diameter and these nanorods were converted into nanowires after 3 h etching. After 3.5 h etching the nanorod length reduced to 680 nm. Fig. S3(g–i)† shows 795 nm long TiO2 nanorods deposited from 200 μl of TBT precursor. The samples etched for 3 h and 3.5 h were 525 and 515 nm in length, respectively. Fig. S3(j–l)† shows cross sectional images of an as-deposited TiO2 nanorod (220 μl of TBT) based device. The vertically aligned, 985 nm long TiO2 nanorods are covered with MAPbI3 nanoparticles. An HTM layer nearly 380 nm thick was deposited onto the TiO2 + MAPbI3 composite. A 3 h etched sample showed nanoparticles of around 540 nm in length with hollow structures. It is also observed that the 3 h etched sample shows larger separation between the nanorods. The sample etched at 3.5 h showed nanorods of nearly 530 nm in length. Moreover, it is also observed that the device thickness, including the spiro-MeOTAD layer, has been drastically decreased. This may be due to proper penetration of the MAPbI3/GBL solution between the split nanorods. However, further increasing the etching time showed that the TiO2 film detached from the FTO substrate, therefore we did not prepare the device with 4 h etching (4 h etched devices failed, not shown).
Fig. S5† shows the J–V curves for the corresponding devices fabricated with different nanorod lengths and etching times. The nanorods 985 nm in length exhibited a VOC = 0.837 V, a JSC = 19.65 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.58 leading to a η = 9.54% PCE. The etched hollow TiO2 nanorod (i.e. TiO2 nanotube) based perovskite device shows a 10.02% PCE with a VOC = 0.923 V, a JSC = 17.87 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.61. The sample etched for 3.5 h exhibited a VOC = 0.941 V, a JSC = 17.60 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.65 which results in a PCE of 10.76%. Interestingly, it is also observed that the FF and VOC of the device increased with respect to etching time. This may be due to uniform deposition of MAPbI3 material and proper penetration of the MAPbI3-GBL solution. From the cross sectional images it is also clear that the over layer of the etched sample is higher than the bare one. The TiO2 nanorods prepared from the TBT precursor show a VOC = 0.824 V, a JSC = 19.59 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.59, which results in a PCE of 9.52%. However, the 3 h etched sample shows a JSC = 18.03 mA cm−2, a VOC = 0.949 V and a FF = 0.60, which results in a 10.26% PCE. The 3.5 h etched sample shows an 11.15% PCE with a VOC = 0.960 V, a JSC = 17.86 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.65. Both samples showed higher FFs, but a lower JSC value. This may be due to the low amount of perovskite deposited on the surface of short TiO2.
In the case of TiO2 nanorods prepared from TBT precursor, these exhibited a VOC = 0.911 V, a JSC = 17.86 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.57, leading to a 9.27% PCE. These samples further etched for 3 h, 3.5 h and 4 h showed PCEs of 9.46%, 9.41% and 2.97% respectively. It is also observed that the VOC of the device increased from 0.911 V to 0.968 V, as the etching time increased from 0 h to 3.5 h. However, the 4 h etched sample shows a lower VOC = 0.770 V with a η = 2.97%. This may be due to the higher etching and random orientation of TiO2 nanorods (Fig. S5†).
The nanoflower sample with a thickness of 610 nm exhibited a VOC = 0.926 V, a JSC = 19.88 mA cm−2, a FF = 0.62, and a η = 11.41%. The 3 h etched sample shows a VOC = 0.955 V, a JSC = 18.38 mA cm−2, a FF = 0.65, and a η = 11.41%. Further etching to 3.5 h results in a η = 12.89% with a VOC = 0.969 V, a JSC = 19.56 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.68. Interestingly, for the TiO2 nanoflowers, all of the samples showed higher FFs compared to other samples. The 4 h etched sample shows a drastic decrease in the PCE up to 0.97%. This may be due to the random orientation of TiO2 nanorods, the very low thickness of the TiO2 sample or sparse nanorods. In this case, the MAPbI3 and HTM may be directly in contact with the FTO substrate so that the device shows ohmic behavior. Table S2† summarizes the extracted solar cell parameters of TiO2 deposited from TTIP and TBT precursors and etched for different periods of time.
From the above samples, we selected the optimized TiO2 nanowire and nanoflower samples with respect to the precursor concentration and the etching time. Fig. 3(a) shows a typical cross section of our champion cell. The TiO2 nanorods were deposited from 180 μl of TTIP and etched at 3.5 h and used for perovskite device fabrication. The 3.5 h etched sample showed a thickness of around 380 nm, which is covered with MAPbI3 nanoparticles. An over layer of nearly 120 nm was observed and a 250 nm spiro-MeOTAD layer was deposited on it. Fig. 3(b) shows a typical cross section of a champion cell fabricated from etched nanoflowers. The TiO2 nanoflowers deposited from 190 μl of TBT precursor and etched for 3.5 h resulted in the formation of 335 nm thick, hollow nanostructure/nanowires. It is noted that if we use very low concentrations of TBT (up to 120 μl) then nanoflowers are not formed. Therefore, we have denoted the sample as TiO2 nanoflower/nanowires. Fig. 3(b) shows a 335 nm thick HTM layer covering a TiO2 nanowire + MAPbI3 composite. Fig. 3(c) and (d) show the J–V plots of respective samples. The 3.5 h etched TiO2 nanorods of 380 nm in length show a VOC = 0.972 V, a JSC = 17.87 mA cm−2, and a FF = 0.66, leading to a PCE of 11.46% in the forward scan. The reverse scan exhibited a VOC = 0.944 V, a JSC = 18.37 mA cm−2, and a FF = 0.68, leading to a PCE of 11.79%. The forward scan of the etched nanoflowers (335 nm)-based perovskite solar cell exhibited a VOC = 0.987 V, a JSC = 19.97 mA cm−2, a FF = 0.70, and a η = 13.79%. The reverse scan exhibited an almost similar PCE of 13.15% with a VOC = 0.979 V, a JSC = 19.47 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.69. Table 1 summarizes the extracted solar cell parameters in the forward and reverse modes of the champion cell based on spiro-MeOTAD HTM. The average PCE of both the etched nanorod and nanoflower champion devices show PCEs of 11.66% and 13.27% respectively. It is noted that the hysteresis tolerance is almost nullified for both devices.

Fig. 4(a) and (b) show histograms of the average PCEs for 380 nm and 335 nm thick PSCs, fabricated independently. Nearly 80% of the fabricated devices show a PCE >11% and >13% for etched nanorods and etched nanoflowers. These results demonstrate the key role of the etching time and the thickness of the nanostructured TiO2. Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the stability of the champion perovskite devices. For the evaluation of the their stability, we stored the devices in a nitrogen glove box at room temperature without encapsulation. The current density and VOC of both devices were almost constant, however, a small decrement was observed in the FF, hence the reduced efficiency after 100 h.

(a) A histogram of the average efficiencies of 100 devices with etched nanorods, (b) a histogram of the average efficiencies of 100 devices with etched nanoflowers, and (c and d) stability measurements of TiO2 nanorod and nanoflower-based perovskite solar cells. The device configuration is FTO/Bl-TiO2/TiO2 (NS)* + MAPbI3/HTM/Au. To take stability measurements, all devices were stored in the dark without any encapsulation. *Note: NS is either a nanorod or nanoflower morphology etched for 3.5 h. 
Furthermore, we have used our champion cell with a 345 nm TiO2 ETL for a PTAA HTM-based device. Fig. 5(a) shows a typical cross sectional image of the champion device based on the etched TiO2 nanoflowers/nanowires (345 nm). Vertically aligned TiO2 nanowires of nearly 345nm were covered with MAPbI3 perovskite (for more detailed information of the device cross sections based on PTAA HTM, please check Fig. S6†). Furthermore, a ∼170 nm over layer of MAPbI3 was observed on top of the MAPbI3 + nanowires composite and a ∼190 nm thin PTAA HTM was deposited by spin coating. Fig. 5(b) shows a schematic of the typical device architecture, based on PTAA HTMs, in the present study. In a typical PSC, the absorber layer (MAPbI3) is sandwiched between the ETL and the HTM. The compact titanium oxide blocking layer (Bl-TiO2) with nanostructured TiO2 acts as the ETL. The PTAA HTM and the counter electrode (Au, Ag or Al) are the key components of the HTL. Fig. 5(c) and (d) show the J–V plots of TiO2 nanorods and TiO2 nanowire/nanoflowers-based PSCs. Average PCEs of 12.87% and 14.36% have been achieved for TiO2 nanorods and nanoflowers respectively. Table 2 summarizes the extracted solar cell parameters in the forward and reverse modes of the champion cell based on the PTAA HTM. Interestingly, the current density for the TNF sample is increased from 17.385 to 19.175 mA cm−2 with the same fill factor of these devices. It is well known that the perovskite overlayer plays an important role in the improvement of the device’s performance. The dense and highly crystalline large perovskite grains (100–100 nm) facilitate better charge transport.44 Therefore, both devices show a higher FF and current density. It is also observed that both devices show negligible hysteresis in the forward and reverse scans. We have also recorded IPCE spectra of these champion devices. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show typical IPCE spectra of the respective devices. It is observed that the region between 550 nm to 700 nm has drastically increased for both samples. These results indicate that the recombination loss in both thin devices is very low compared to that in thick devices. The calculated integrated JSC values for 3.5 h etched TiO2 nanorods and nanoflowers are 17.08 mA cm−2 and 18.75 mA cm−2respectively. Fig. 6(c) and (d) show histograms of the average PCEs for 380 nm and 345 nm thick PSCs fabricated independently. More than 80% of fabricated devices show PCEs >13% and >14% for etched nanorods and etched nanowires/nanoflowers respectively. For comparison, we have fabricated regular mp-TiO2-based PSCs and recorded their J–V performance (please check Fig. S7†).

 Fig. 6  The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of (a) a TiO2 nanorod (380 nm) based PSC device and (b) a TiO2 nanoflower/nanowire (345 nm) based PSC device, and (c and d) histograms of average efficiencies for 100 devices, respectively. The IPCE data was collected under the constant energy DC mode with a delay time of 10 ms under a light intensity of 50 μW cm−2. 
From the J–V plots of thick (>1 μm), bare TiO2 and thick TiO2 nanoflowers, it is also observed that the fabricated devices show relatively low shunt resistance (Rsh). This may be due to imperfection in the devices resulting in a dark leakage current, which has manifested itself electronically as a low shunt resistance with the impact of reducing the VOC. The Rsh is mainly dependent upon whether the solar cell is illuminated or not, adding further variability to the VOC. The lower photocurrents, consistent with lower charge generation, result in a lower VOC than expected. Therefore, the leakage current density in samples etched for longer (>3.5 h etching time) is observed to be smaller than 3.0 h etched devices and bare TiO2 nanorod-based devices. It is well known that Rsh and FF are directly proportional to each other. The etched sample provides relatively shorter TiO2 nanostructure length and facilitates a small number of grain boundaries due to uniform deposition of perovskite + etched TiO2 nanorods, and formation of the crystalline perovskite overlayer. These parameters are beneficial for a decrement in series resistance (Rs) and improvement in FF. The Rsh value for the 3.5 h etched nanoflower-based device is much higher. Therefore, the FF of the etched device increased from 0.62 for the bare nanoflower to 0.72 for the etched nanoflower sample, resulting in a higher PCE. On the other hand, the >3.5 h etched sample shows ohmic behaviour due to direct contact between the HTM and the FTO. Therefore, the 4 h etched samples show a very low FF and PCE. In the present case, fill factors of 0.39 and 0.21 were observed for the 4 h etched TiO2 nanorods and the 4 h etched TiO2 nanoflower-based PSCs (Table S2†).
In order to check the reliability of our developed method, we tested the photocurrent and PCE under stable illumination in the air. Fig. 7 shows the evolution of stable photocurrent measurements and solar cell performance over time, under illumination. Prior to each measurement the devices were biased at open circuit conditions. To obtain a more reliable PCE, Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the photocurrent stability and the PCE performances of the champion devices using mp-TiO2, etched TiO2 nanorods and etched TiO2 nanowire-based perovskite solar cells. The device configuration for all samples was either FTO/Bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2 or TiO2 NS/HTM/Au. These measurements were measured as a function of time at a forward bias set at their respective open circuit potential. For the mp-TiO2-based device (black line), the current density at 10 s was 14.85 mA cm−2 but increased to 17.81 mA cm−2 after 30 s of constant illumination. Similar behaviour was observed for bare TiO2 nanorods and bare TiO2 nanowires. On the other hand, for the etched TiO2 nanowires based device, the photocurrent density initially reached values of nearly 20 mA cm−2, but stabilized after 6–10 s and decreased to 19.5 mA cm−2. However, the etched sample shows stable photocurrent density after 10 s of constant illumination. The champion device using etched TiO2 nanorods shows a stable current density and PCE of 18.50 mA cm−2 and >13.8%, while etched TiO2 nanoflowers exhibit a stable current density of 19.80 mA cm−2 current density with a stable PCE of >14.80% over a 300 s measurement window. These values are very close to the PCE obtained from the reverse scan for the J–V measurement. It is also observed that it took a very short time for the switching of the etched TiO2 nanostructure-based PSCs. These stable photocurrent measurements under illumination represent excellent stability and no performance degradation even after 300 s.

Before measurements, the devices were stored in a nitrogen filled glove box in the dark. All measurements were carried out in air at room temperature. 
In order to verify our method with different perovskites we have synthesized mixed halide perovskite films (MAPbI3−xClx) and formamidinium-based mixed lead halide (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 as per available literature. The optimization of the annealing temperature was optimized as per XRD analysis. Fig. 8(a) represents the XRD patterns of MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x, x = 0.15. From XRD analysis, it is clear that for both MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 an annealing temperature of 100 °C is enough for phase formation.45,46Fig. 8(b and c) show the J–V curves of perovskite solar cells based on etched 1D TiO2 nanoflowers + MAPbI3−xClx/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 absorbing layers. These details are summarized in Table 3. The MAPbI3−xClx based on the etched TiO2 nanoflowers ETL device shows a JSC = 20.75 mA cm−2, a VOC = 1.054 V and a FF = 0.74 leading to a η = 15.87%. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based sample exhibits a JSC = 21.52 mA cm−2, a VOC = 1.073 V and a FF = 0.76 leading to a η = 17.55% (Table 4). The MAPbI3−xClx-based perovskite device exhibits an IPCE of ∼75%, while the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based device has an ICPE of ∼85% in the visible spectrum. Both IPCE spectra show respective band edges which agree well with previous reports. The calculated integrated current density values were 19.49 mA cm−2 and 21.73 mA cm−2 for MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based devices, respectively.

Furthermore, the charge extraction properties of different perovskite layers in contact with the etched TiO2 ETL have been investigated by PL and TRPL analysis. In the present investigation, we have analyzed only champion devices for PL and TRPL analysis. Fig. S8(a)† shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the MAPbI3, MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite layers in contact with the etched TiO2 ETL. The samples show luminescence peaks at ∼775, ∼775 and ∼765 nm for MAPbI3, MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 respectively, which is consistent with previous reports.48 The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profile data was fitted to a bi-exponential function of the form: (1)where τ1 and τ2 are the first and second order decay time, and A1 and A2 are respective weight factors of each decay channel. The non-radiative fast-decay lifetime (τ1) and radiative slow-decay lifetime (τ2) originated from the quenching of charge carriers and free charge carriers before the charge collection, respectively. The average recombination lifetimes 〈τavg〉 for the respective samples were calculated from lifetime values and weight fraction amplitude values (%) using the following equation:49 (2)
and the calculated average lifetimes 〈τavg〉 of the MAPbI3, MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite layers were found to be 182.3, 47.6 and 33.4 ns respectively. For the sample of etched TiO2/MAPbI3, the fast decay time is 24.582 ns with a fraction of 0.38, and the slow decay time is 140.03 ns with a fraction of 0.62. Etched TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx exhibits a fast decay time of 22.406 ns and a slow decay time of 75.845 ns, with weight fractions of 0.21 and 0.79, respectively. In contrast, the etched TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 sample exhibits a fast decay time of 10.088 ns with a weight fraction of 0.24 and a slow decay time of 50.711 ns with a weight fraction of 0.66. This indicates that the charge transfer from the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 layer to the etched TiO2 ETL is much faster than the other perovskite absorbers. Therefore, in the present case, the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based device shows a much higher PCE.

Fig. 9 shows the J–V curves of the MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 devices in the forward and reverse scan directions. The MAPbI3−xClx PSC exhibited a PCE value of 15.87% (VOC = 1.055 V, JSC = 21.24 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.71) and 14.24% (VOC = 1.019 V, JSC = 21.18 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.66) for the reverse and forward scans, respectively. The (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSC exhibited PCE values of 17.55% (VOC = 1.073 V, JSC = 22.10 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.76) and 15.82% (VOC = 1.062 V, JSC = 21.60 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.69) for the reverse and forward scans. Both devices show ∼1% hysteresis, revealing good optimization of the TiO2 ETL thickness. However, this negligible hysteresis could also be eliminated by optimizing the grain size and thickness of the ETL.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, PSCs based on hierarchical TiO2 ETLs have been successfully synthesized and demonstrate a PCE of >17%, which represents an improved photovoltaic performance with enhanced photocurrent and increased power conversion efficiency. The developed etching process is beneficial for the improvement of the open circuit voltage (VOC) as well as the current density (JSC). Our best optimized device deposited from 200 μl TTIP and 180 μl TBT and etched for 3.5 h at 150 °C shows nanowire-like morphology with a thickness of 380 nm and 345 nm, respectively. Further, fabricated devices exhibited negligible hysteresis with average PCEs of 11.66% and 13.27% for the etched nanorods and the etched nanoflower morphologies, respectively, with device configurations of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. Furthermore, a 14.36% efficiency has been achieved for PTAA-based HTMs with a VOC = 1.062 V, a JSC = 19.175 mA cm−2 and a FF = 0.705. The photocurrent stability results showed a stable PCE even after 300 s under continuous illumination. The optimized TiO2 ETL conditions were further used for mixed halide MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite based absorbing layers. Our champion devices show a η = 15.87% and 17.55% for MAPbI3−xClx and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, respectively, based on the etched TiO2 ETL, which is much higher than a previous report.47 This successful finding indicates that the low temperature process for 1D etched TiO2 hollow nanostructures results in a promising ETL for PSCs. Therefore, it is concluded that, the secondary hydrothermal etching parameters act as high potential tools for tuning the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
