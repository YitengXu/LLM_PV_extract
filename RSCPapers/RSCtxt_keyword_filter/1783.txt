    , Accepted 7th December 2022First published on 9th December 2022AbstractWe theoretically investigate lead iodide perovskites of general formula APbI3 for a series of metallic cations (namely Cs+, Rb+, K+, Na+ and Li+) by means of density functional theory, the GW method and the Bethe–Salpeter equation including spin–orbit coupling. We demonstrate that the low-energy edges (up to 1.3 eV) of the absorption spectra are dominated by weakly bound excitons, with binding energies Eb of ∼ 30–80 meV, and the corresponding intensities increase as metallic cations become lighter. The middle parts of the spectra (1.8–2.4 eV), on the other hand, contain optical dipole transitions comprising more confined excitons (Eb ∼ 150–200 meV) located at PbI3. These parts of the spectra correspond to the optical-gain wavelengths which are experimentally achieved in optically pumped perovskite lasers. Finally, the higher energy parts, from about 2.8 eV (LiPbI3) to 4.3 eV (CsPbI3), contain optical transitions with very confined excitons (Eb ∼ 220–290 meV) located at halide atoms and the empty states of the metallic cations.
Introduction
Lead halide perovskites, with general chemical formula APbX3, where A and X stand for a cation and a halide anion, respectively, are members of a family of compounds which have revolutionized the field of optoelectronics since the first decade of this century.1 The chemical composition, fabrication routes and morphological design are factors which provide lead halide perovskites with an exceptional set of physico-chemical properties, including a large absorption coefficient, long diffusion lengths for bipolar charge transport, a high photoluminiscence quantum yield, low defect state densities and narrow linewidths, which make them find applications as components of solar cells, photodetectors, light emitting devices and optically pumped lasers, among others.2,3
In particular, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (HPs) have gained considerable interest, mainly in relation to their use as components of high-performance solar cells.4–8 In these perovskites, the A+ cation is typically methylammonium [CH3NH3+, MA] or formamidinium [CH(NH2)2+, FA], and doping species are often added to improve the stability of performance. In this context, relevant advances have been reached in terms of the efficiency of HP solar cells, which has evolved from the preliminary 3.8%1 in 2009 to the maximum value of 25.6% reported so far;9 as a reference, the efficiency of first-generation silicon cells is around 30%. Considering that HPs are relatively cheap to synthesize, one may be tempted to think that they are optimal candidates to replace the costly Si-based solar cells. Unfortunately, the current situation is not so ideal, and the use of HPs in commercial devices is severely complicated by the presence of toxic metals and by structural instability issues.5,10 Briefly, these are related to the exposure to environmental humidity (which irreversibly decomposes the HPs into their precursors and volatile acid compounds),11 heat (decomposition occurs for some perovskites at temperatures as low as 40 °C)12 and oxidation in the presence of light, even for very low oxygen levels,13,14 among others. Several strategies are being adopted to improve the stability of HPs, including standard encapsulation and composition tailoring, to enhance tolerance to oxidation and doping, but none of them ensure the reliability of HP-based solar cells under working conditions for a long time.10
Degradation of HPs is partially due to the fact that the MA and FA organic cations are volatile. Their structural stability may be improved by replacing these cations by inorganic (typically alkaline) ones.15–18 Apart from an enhanced stability in many cases, all-inorganic perovskites (IPs) exhibit interesting optoelectronic properties including long diffusion lengths and lifetimes for recombination of charge carriers19–21 and strong optical absorption,22 which makes them promising components not only for solar cells, but also for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers.23–25 By varying the A+ cation, as well as the halides (Cl, Br, and I) and B-site metals (typically Pb, Sn and Ge), one obtains virtually a myriad of IPs, and most of them are still not well (or not at all) characterized. The archetypical IP is the CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 system, that was extensively studied elsewhere.2 In the context of this work, the following comments are pertinent:
1. Despite the aforementioned enhanced structural stability of IPs, they display a rich phase transition phenomenology which affects their performance. For instance, CsPbI3 crystallizes in the the cubic α-phase (with a gap of 1.7 eV) above 593 K, and decomposes into orthorhombic phases below room temperature.26 Furthermore, there is a severe decomposition of the β and γ orthorhombic phases to the photovoltaically inactive non-perovskite δ-phase in the presence of water vapor.27–29 The origin of this decomposition is the relatively small radius of Cs+, which does not suffice to stabilize the PbI6 octahedra of the perovskite structure. Despite the phase transformation being reversible upon annealing, the optoelectronic properties of the non-perovskite phase are poor. Strategies such as microstructural or dimensional control, doping and molecular modification have been used with the aim to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbI3-based solar cells, but it remains inadequate for efficient photovoltaic devices.2 Bulk CsPbBr3 is stable in an orthorhombic perovskite phase at room temperature, but its gap (∼2.3 eV) is too high for photovoltaic applications.30 The mixed halides CsPb(BrxI1−x)3, on the other hand, display gaps between 1.7 and 2.3 eV, which overlap the optimum range for photovoltaic devices, and are stable for some compositions.31 The most widely studied member of this group is perhaps CsPbI2Br, whose gap ranges between 1.8 and 1.9 eV. This makes it a prominent candidate for solar cell applications, although its highest PCE is still well below that of HPs. Moreover, a very short exciton lifetime in CsPbI2Br makes it also a promising material for LEDs and lasers.32
2. Regarding mixed-halide perovskites, several approaches have been adopted.2 For the purpose of this work, we will limit ourselves to chemical modification. Noticeable structural stabilization and increased PCEs from ∼4% of undoped CsPbI2Br have been achieved by incorporating cations such as Ge2+, Sn2+, Sr2+, Bi3+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Sb3+, and Ni2+ and lanthanides La2+, Sm2+ and Eu2+17,33–42 and, in particular, halides such as SrCl2 (PCE = 16.07%),43 GdCl3 (PCE = 16.24%),44 FeCl2 (PCE = 17.1%)45 and InCl3 (PCE = 17.45%).42 All these cations are incorporated into the perovskite structure at the Pb-site, which enhances the structural stability because the doping cation shrinks the octahedral perovskite voids and reduces the lattice energy. The effect on the optical and transport properties is related to the fact that the bottom most conduction band arises mainly from the Pb p-orbitals. The possible candidates for the A+ cation, apart from Cs2 +, have been more scarcely considered, despite early theoretical works having pointed out that the bandgap of metal–halide perovskites depends on the metal–halide–metal bond angle and, therefore, it could be tuned by adequate choices of the A+ cation.46 In this context, the successful fabrication of Rb-based perovskites in their nanocrystal form has been reported,47,48 although Rb (as also K) usually acts as a co-dopant.48–50 Even smaller cations such as Na+ could be incorporated into double perovskites as well, like in Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2NaSbCl6, but they are located at the B-sites (occupied by Pb in single perovskites) in order to alternate and balance the trivalent cations (Bi3+ and Sb3+).51–54
3. From the point of view of applications, perovskites are used in photovoltaic or optoelectronic devices in such a way that, under working conditions, different regions of their optical spectrum are excited. In particular, this means that IPs must work under diverse exciton binding energy (Eb) conditions. For instance, recent advances in perovskite-based solar cells have been reviewed elsewhere.55,56 In general, their usage as parts of photovoltaic devices (such as solar cells) is affected by materials chemistry and structure (crystallization control during fabrication, defect and interface engineering, etc.2) and by physical factors, namely a suitable bandgap and weakly bound excitons, easily dissociable into free charge carriers, to form at the onset of the optical absorption spectrum. On the other hand, their use in light-emitting devices requires an appropriate bandgap and the existence of more strongly bound (thus more stable) excitons, since these ease efficient recombination even at low carrier densities.57 In this respect, despite that a number of papers deal with advances on laser devices with perovskites as optical-gain materials,3,58–62 there is much room for performance enhancement, especially for optically pumped lasers. These devices may be classified according to their chemical structure, morphology and dimensionality, as well as to the lasing mode, emission wavelength and energy density threshold for optical excitation.3 Bulk, quasi-2D structures and nanocrystals were reported to work under pumping thresholds ranging from 0.25 to 420 μJ cm−2, with emission wavelengths reported between 400 and 790 nm (1.56–3.1 eV). The common property of all this family of devices is the excitation energy for laser pumping (2.2–3.5 eV), which is well above the conduction band minimum in each case. This contrasts with electrically pumped lasers, for which the driven excitation locates near the fundamental bandgap–incidentally, there is still a quest to construct first such a device with either IPs or HPs. In summary, perovskites entering into components of lasers must fulfill different requirements for optimal performance depending on the pumping mechanism: optically pumped lasers require strongly bound excitons to be located below the pumping energy in the optical absorption spectrum, whereas electrically pumped ones require excitons to form at the absorption edge.
With these ideas in mind, the main goal of this paper is to study the effect of the central A+ cation between the inorganic PbI6 octahedra in the all-inorganic perovskite APbI3 structure. In particular, we aim to investigate first which energetic position of the A+ states, and which transitions between the later and PbI3 states, could be interesting for lasing applications. Just a few experimental works, and even less theoretical studies, focus on the role of inorganic A+ cations. The most popular among experimentalists is Cs+, which is reported as the more effective element for enhancing photostability when incorporated as a co-dopant in FA-based HPs.63–65 Pure Cs-based perovskite lasers have been constructed as well,66–70 but no attention has been paid to other doping species which, according to the previous discussion, enhance stabilization and modify the bandgap of IPs.
Second, we aim to investigate the possible formation of excitons in these perovskite systems, not only close to the absorption edge, but also at much higher excitation energies. This interest arises from the fact that high-energy regions of the absorption spectrum could be achieved during the operation of pumped lasers. As will be discussed below, inorganic cations considered herein yield a single empty state within the conduction manifold of up to 5 eV above the bandgap. This empty state is well localized (i.e., not hybridized with the lead-halide frame) at the A+ cation, and it gives rise to the formation of bound excitons. By contrast, organic cations yield many empty states, which obscures the theoretical analysis. Incidentally, we have focused on inorganic cations because, unlike organic ones, they do not rotate. Rotations of the relatively large organic cations cause large distorsions of the inorganic frame71–73 and switches the gap to indirect,74 with both effects making difficult any study of optical properties.
Third, we will be interested in establishing the nature of optical transitions in terms of electron and hole states and their location within the band structure, since this could set the basis for future developments. The experimental detection of optical absorption spectra does not help in distinguishing between electron excitations purely localized at the PbI3 states and those involving also empty states of the A+ cation. Therefore, theoretical tools become indispensable to examine the origin of the optical transitions. Typically, theoretical studies adopt ab initio many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) schemes, namely the non-selfconsistent GW and the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) methods,75,76 built on top of the Bloch functions, which are spinors if spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is included, and computed within the density functional theory (DFT) formalism. This is the approach used in this work, where the absorption spectra of lead iodide perovskites APbI3, with A = Cs, Rb, K, Na and Li, are examined up to 5 eV to investigate the band contribution to optical transitions and the corresponding exciton binding energies. The first three compounds give rise to stable structures, whereas the later two, too light to yield stability, must be considered as “theoretical limits” in this context. Special attention is paid to optical transitions from iodide to A+ cations and those from I to Pb.
Theoretical details
Lead halide perovskites exist in the cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic systems, depending on the chemical composition and temperature.31 In this work, we have considered the cubic structure for simplicity; Fig. 1 shows the archetypical perovskite structure. For each choice of the A+ cation, the lattice parameter was set to the experimental value of CsPbI3 (6.297 Å26) and subsequently optimized by the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm.

DFT calculations including spin–orbit coupling (DFT + SOC) were performed using the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) using the Quantum ESPRESSO plane-wave package.77 For completeness, a set of calculations using DFT without SOC were carried out as well. The atomic cores were described with Martin-Troulier norm-conserving full-relativistic pseudopotentials using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parametrization of the exchange–correlation functional. A plane-wave energy cutoff of 100 Ry was used, and the Brillouin zone (BZ) was sampled with a 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst-Pack mesh.78 The DFT band structures were interpolated from maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs)79,80 using the Wannier90 code81 and plotted along high-symmetry lines, namely .
Non-selfconsistent GW and BSE calculations were performed on top of the DFT + SOC solutions using the Yambo code.82,83 GW calculations were carried out using the plasmon-pole approximation.84 The plane-wave energy cutoffs were set to 30 Ry for the Coulomb and exchange interactions and 6 Ry for the response block size, and 1000 bands were included in the response and GW summations; these values were set after convergence tests for the corresponding magnitudes. The BZ sampling for the GW method was 4 × 4 × 4. For the bare DFT + SOC, the GW energies were transferred to the Wannier90 code for band interpolation and projection onto MLWFs localized at the A+ cation.
The BSE was solved in two ways: (1) using a very dense 18 × 18 × 18 Monkhorst-Pack mesh to sample the BZ, in order to obtain the convergent absorption spectrum within the Haydock solution scheme (which does not imply the full diagonalization of the BSE Hamiltonian), and (2) using a moderate 8 × 8 × 8 mesh for the full-diagonalization scheme, which is required to analyze the optical transitions in terms of interband excitations at specific k-points. For the systems considered herein, denser k-point meshes for full diagonalization were beyond our computational capabilities. For the BSE, 200 bands were summed to build up the polarization function, while 36 bands were occupied. The plane waves up to energies of 10 Ry for the exchange components and 4 Ry for the screening and response block-size were used. For the GW method, these values were set after convergence tests. The electron–hole (e–h) pairs were formed by the 6 occupied and 8 unoccupied bands.
Results and discussion
Band structure
The band structures obtained using the GW + SOC approximation for the perovskites considered in this work are shown in Fig. 2. For completeness, the corresponding bands obtained using DFT and DFT + SOC are shown in Fig. S1 and S2, respectively, in the ESI† file. In all cases, the band extrema (conduction band minimum, CBM, and valence band maximum, VBM) are at R, with secondary extrema at M. In contrast, the GW + SOC gaps, band widths and lattice parameters depend on the particular A+ cation, as shown in Table 1. Also, for completeness, the corresponding values for DFT and DFT + SOC are given in Table S1 in the ESI.†

In relation to the lattice parameters, the calculated value for CsPbI3 (6.38 Å) is slightly larger than the experimental value. This discrepancy was expectable, since the GGA generally overestimates bond lengths. The lack of experimental data impedes an appropriate analysis of our results. Nonetheless, it is noticeable that the computed lattice parameters change by roughly 0.12 Å for the whole cation series considered herein. This change is smaller than that occurring when iodine is replaced by lighter anions: we remark that the lattice parameters of CsPbI3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 are 5.61 Å, 5.87 Å and 6.38 Å, respectively.
A relevant feature for the subsequent discussion is the existence of an unoccupied band manifold associated with the A+ cation, which may be evinced by projecting the computed bands onto MLWFs centered at each A+ site. In Fig. 2, the color code quantifies this projection, with the red (blue) color corresponding to the maximum (minimum) value. Our calculations reveal the existence of A+ doublet states within the conduction band in each case. As a general conclusion, the band gap lowers and the empty A+ cation band shifts down towards the CBM with the decreasing A+ cation mass, as reported in Table 1. Nonetheless, except at Γ (where the bandgap is much larger than that at R), the empty states of A+ cations do not fall below the local CBM. The minimum of the A+-band is at Γ in all cases, with a secondary one at R, and its width decreases with the mass of the A+ cation as well. We have checked that the lowering of the A+ cation empty states has a chemical nature (i.e., it is due to the individual cation in each case), and it is not just a geometrical effect (i.e., shorter chemical bonds as the lattice parameter decreases). To this end, we have computed the band structure of CsPbI3 using the lattice parameter of LiPbI3, and vice versa. The results, shown in the ESI,† Fig. S3, evidence that the aforementioned lowering is insensitive to changes of the lattice parameter. The effect could be related instead to a weakening of the hydrogen bonds between the A+ cations and the free electron pairs of the iodides. A fingerprint of this weakening is the fact that the bandwidths of the A+ empty states are smaller for the lighter cations. In any case, this issue has not been further investigated herein.
The A+ cation empty state is an s-type function, which indicates an interaction with the neighbor A+ and not the with the lead halide lattice. The proof of that is included in Fig. S4 in the ESI,† where the band structures and spreads of the MLWFs for the cation empty states are presented for CsPbI3 in two periodic lattices: (1) akin to that of the corresponding perovskite (a = 6.38 Å) and (2) with a much larger lattice parameter (a = 10.58 Å). In relation to the optical spectra, an important implication of the absence of hybridization between the A+ cations and the BX3 units is a strong spacial localization of electrons at the highly excited states, which do not possess the diffuse character that is usual for conduction states in ordinary semiconductors.
Optical spectra and excitonic behavior
The light absorption spectra computed by solving the BSE on top of the GW + SOC calculations for the series of perovskites considered herein are shown in Fig. 3. The reliability of the calculations has been assessed by checking the convergence of the BSE spectrum with respect to the BZ sampling, which is demonstrated in the ESI† (Fig. S5). Regardless of the particular metallic cation, the optical spectra feature two prominent peaks, located at similar excitation energy ranges, namely 1.7–1.8 eV and 2.6–2.8 eV. Note that their relative intensities depend upon the particular A+ cation, though, the first peak being more intense only for the heavier cations (K+ to Cs+). There is also a low-energy peak at the absorption edge, which decreases in intensity and shifts to the blue with the increasing mass of the A+ cation. Above 3.5 eV, less intense but still well pronounced peaks are found in all cases. As will be discussed below, the origin of these peaks is different for heavy and light cations. For cations from K+ to Cs+, the peaks are related to optical transitions (and the accompanying charge redistribution) from iodide to the A+ empty states. For the lighter cations Li+ and Na+, the high-energy peaks in the absorption spectrum correspond to Pb–I transitions.
 Fig. 3  Optical absorption spectra calculated for the perovskite series considered in this work. 
The peaks of the absorption spectra, particularly those at the low-energy edges, indicate the existence of excitons in the systems. Actually, in all cases, the whole spectra up to 6 eV consist of about twenty thousand excitons, a number high enough to impede their entire characterization. Instead, only selected optical transitions from low (up to 1.3 eV), middle (1.8–2.8 eV) and high energy (3.3–4.7 eV) parts of the absorption spectra have been analyzed. Particularly, we examined about twenty excitons for all cations, representative for the each spectrum up to about 4.7 eV. Special attention has been paid to optical excitation composed of interband transitions around the gap at R, the secondary extrema near the M point and the local minimum of the A+ cation band near Γ, as well as to transitions near X. All these transitions occur at different energies depending on the particular A+ cation. In general, the description of absorption and corresponding emission lines should include effects such as the formation of polarons and strong electron–phonon coupling.85,86 These effects are manifested by the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence (PL) intensity and the Stokes shift appearing, for example, in triple halide perovskites.87 However, the effect of phonons85 is beyond our theoretical capabilities, and has not been taken into account in this work.
The spectra have been analyzed as follows. Each exciton possesses an excitation energy EI and an oscillator strength and consists of many single dipole transitions (SDTs). SDTs occur between occupied states [bh, numbered down in energy as H−1,−2,… from the highest occupied (H) state] and unoccupied ones [be, numbered up in energy as L1,2,… from the lowest unoccupied (L) state]. In general, two k-points in the BZ are involved for each SDT, those for the initial (ki) and the final states (kf); herein, all SDTs were chosen as direct, so that ki = kf ≡ k. On the other hand, each SDT may contribute to several excitons with different weights; in this work, a threshold of 5% for the SDTs weights was chosen. In other words, for a given exciton, only SDTs contributing to the intensity by more than 5% were considered.
The energy of each SDT, EGW(t), where t denotes the set {ki,kf,bh,be}, is the difference between the energies of the final and initial states, obtained using the GW method, hence excluding any e–h interaction correction. From it, we define the excitation binding energy (Eb) as Eb(t) = EGW(t) − EBSE(t) ≡ EGW(t) − EI(t)(1)where the energy EBSE(t) is obtained using the BSE method and accounts for the e–h interactions. For bound excitons (with attractive e–h interactions), the EBSE(t) energies are lower than the interband energies EGW(t) and, hence, the values of Eb are positive. Note that, since a given SDT (characterized by a set t) may contribute to many excitons, there is not a single EI(t), but actually a range [Emin(t) and Emax(t)] corresponding to the excitons contribute to the SDT. According to eqn (1), the highest Eb(t) (that is, the maximum binding energy of the SDT) is for the lowest exciton energy that contains the chosen SDT with the weight above the threshold, EminI(t). Note that, according to this definition, Eb(t) is mathematically univocal.
We are interested in four characteristics of the excitations: (i) their chemical composition, which is given by the projection of the involved bands onto atomic states, (ii) their location at high-symmetry k-points within the BZ, (iii) the EminI values to which they contribute, and (iv) the value of Eb. As was mentioned above, to sample the BSE spectrum we have restricted ourselves to selected transitions at low (up to 1.3 eV), middle (1.8–2.8 eV) and high energies (3.3–4.7 eV), namely those transitions exhibiting the highest oscillator strengths. The selected optical transitions are shown in Fig. 4 for all cation species, where the blue lines are for transitions located at the PbI3 moiety of the crystal, and the red ones for those transitions involving the A+ empty states. Table 2 shows the above four characteristics for these selected SDTs. The numbering of the SDTs in Fig. 4 corresponds to the d indexes listed in Table 2, and the transitions involving the A+ empty states (in red in Fig. 4) appear in bold in Table 2.

For all cations, the highest binding energies of excitons correspond to transitions within the ranges of 3.8–4.3 eV for heavy cations (K+ to Cs+) and 2.8–3.2 for lighter ones, which involve the A+ empty states. Very interestingly, these transitions are located not exactly at Γ, but at points shifted towards X or M, which correspond to the valence band maxima in this region of the BZ. This fact indicates that the hole density of states (i.e., the iodide contribution to the transition) affects Eb more than that of the electron, since the minimum of the A+-derived state is exactly at Γ in all cases. By comparison, the values of Eb computed exactly at the Γ-point are given in parentheses in Table 2.
Less strongly bound excitons were observed for transitions from iodine anions to Pb (in blue in Fig. 4); these are transitions number 4 for CsPbI3, number 5 for RbPbI3 and number 3 for LiPbI3, all of them located at the M point. These transitions correspond to the local valence band maxima and conduction band minima, and yield excitation energies within the range of 2.20–2.40 eV. High values of Eb were also obtained in some cases for the excitations at the X point, where band flattening is observed in Fig. 2. These correspond to transition numbers 5, 8 and 5 for CsPbI3, RbPbI3 and KPbI3, respectively, and correlate with excitation energies around 3.1–3.3 eV. Finally, the low-energy excitations at the absorption edge are characterized by very low values of Eb, ranging roughly between 30 and 80 meV, and appear at the R symmetry point.
Discussion
Before analyzing and discussing the previous results, a comparison of these with experimental or theoretical values reported in the literature is desirable. In this respect, we must admit that performing such a comparison is not a straightforward task. The first reason is that Eb values are extremely sensitive to factors such as the structure, chemical composition, measurement technique, dimensionality, and fabrication routes.28,86–90 Besides, in contrast to the huge number of papers describing the optical performance of HPs, those focused on IPs are much more scarce. Yunakova et al. report the binding energy of CsPbI3 thin films to be Eb = 0.157 meV, but their result is not comparable to ours because their crystals were orthorhombic and, besides, chemically impure.29 Yang et al., on the other hand, used magneto-transmission measurements to estimate Eb = 15 meV for CsPbI3 stabilized in the cubic phase by annealing.28 Their results are admittedly lower than those obtained by magneto-optical techniques, which could be due to the fact that the samples are metastable.
As for theoretical works, it has been recognized that the predicted exciton binding energies are usually well higher than experimental ones.85,91,92 In particular, Filip et al. compute Eb = 39 meV by solving the BSE using dynamic screening approximation.85 The value of Eb calculated herein for CsPbI3 at the absorption edge overestimates the results by Filip et al. due to two reasons: (1) we adopted a static screening approach which completely ignores the screening of the e–h interactions by phonons, and (2) we studied the α cubic phase of CsPbI3 while these authors investigated the orthorhombic phase, among other compounds. Some comments can be made in this respect. For instance, the bandgaps and absorption edges of lead halide perovskites increase as the symmetry decreases from the cubic to the orthorhombic structures (see Table 3 in our previous work71). This fact suggests that the above rule could be also true for exciton binding energies at the absorption edges, provided that one ignores the phonon screening of the e–h interactions. In this sense, it would be very interesting to check the effect of phonons for excitons in different structures, as also for excitations at various k-points in the BZ. The indirect evidence for a large variety of the excitonic binding energies is given by a measurement of the exciton lifetimes, since they are inversely proportional to the Eb values.86
It is also interesting to compare the computed and measured absorption spectra. In this case, the difficulty arises because the experimental data refer mostly to the mixed A+ cation and mixed halide compounds. Besides, the high energy region of the absorption spectra has not been explored by optical pumping to date (although UV lasers up to 5 eV are available), to our knowledge of the literature. Still, one may get additional indirect support to the theoretical prediction of an important role of the A+ cation on the optical performance. For example, the photostability of (Cs,FA)Pb(I,Br)3 increases very efficiently with a change of a laser pumping energy of only 0.1 eV,93 which is consistent with the highest peak shifts calculated herein for the corresponding A+ cations and could be an indirect sign of the role played by them. Also, increasing the Cs content with simultaneous decreasing that of Pb enhances the crystal stability during lasing operation.65 Finally, recombination centers for excitons are formed when the mixed A+ cations segregate to yield an inhomogeneous distribution.49
As we pointed out in the Introduction, different parts of the absorption spectrum of perovskites may be excited depending on their use as component of optical devices. In particular, optically-pumped lasers are excited approximately within the range of 2.2–3.5 eV, for which strongly bound excitons are desirable. Our results indicate that such an interval could be realized for suitable choices of the A+ cation in lead halide perovskites. The corresponding excitons exhibit high binding energies and, importantly, involve A+ empty states. In other words, one gets very strongly bound excitons with the electron located at A+ which likely yields high power lasing. Generally, experimental works for optically-pumped lasers based on the mixed cation and halide perovskites report the optical gain obtained at the corresponding wavelengths.3,93 However, there are troublesome issues related to crystal deionization during strong laser pumping, since excitations from iodine to the A+ cation change I− and A+ to the neutral pairs I0 and A0, which destabilizes the ionic structure of the PbI3 moiety. The results reported herein suggest that this problem could be partially solved by designing mixed-cation (A1A2)PbI3 compounds, with dissimilar concentrations of A1+ and A2+ in such a way that the majority cations serve as donors for the PbI3 ionic bonds, whereas the minority ones add their empty states to be used in excitonic purposes. This is a plausibility argument that will be explored further in future works.
The low-energy edge of the absorption spectrum is rather dominated by weakly bound excitons, Eb ∼ 30–80 meV. We have already pointed out that the intensity of these peaks increases as the A+ cation becomes lighter. Both facts are compatible with the use of APbI3 perovskites as parts of solar cells and could be promising for the realization of electrically pumped perovskite lasers too, although this is a highly speculative prediction with the data available to date.
Summary
Focusing on excitonic properties, we have performed ab initio MBPT calculations for a series of inorganic lead halide perovskites, namely APbI3 with A = Cs, Rb, K, Na and Li. The results show a marked effect of the A+ cation on the electronic structure and the optical performance of these systems. The band structures obtained using the DFT, DFT + SOC and GW+SOC formalisms, projected on the MLWFs centered at A+, show that the energy of the A+ empty states lowers as cations become lighter. On the other hand, the BSE absorption spectra reveal that the peaks at the low-energy edge increase for perovskites with lighter cations, Li+ and Na+.
The low-energy edge of the absorption spectrum is dominated by weakly bound excitons, Eb ∼ 30–80 meV, values not too high for the realization of solar cells. The corresponding transitions take place from the VBM to the CBM at R. Further, the middle part of the spectra contain transitions characterized by more strongly confined excitons (Eb ∼ 150–200 meV) located at PbI3, without any contribution of the A+ states. These transitions take place at M and X, as well as along the high-symmetry line between the R and M points. This energetic region includes the highest of the absorption spectrum and the neighboring saddle point. Finally, the higher energy part of the spectrum, from about 2.8 eV (for LiPbI3) to 4.3 eV (for CsPbI3), is characterized by very strongly confined excitons, with Eb ∼ 220–290 meV, located at the halide atoms and the empty states of A+.
