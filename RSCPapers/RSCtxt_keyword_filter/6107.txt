    , Accepted 13th August 2021First published on 14th August 2021AbstractMetal sulfides have emerged as promising materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications due to their favorable light absorption ability, tunable structural and optical properties. With the rapid development of PEC systems, an increasing number of studies have successfully designed high-performing metal sulfide photoelectrodes. Given the tunability of p-type and n-type behaviors of metal sulfides, they have been extensively employed as both photocathodes and/or photoanodes in a PEC system. While metal sulfides have been demonstrated to be a good photoabsorber, some studies have constructed sulfide-based composite photoelectrodes to further improve the charge transfer and consumption capabilities. In this review, we focus on assessing recent publications that used metal sulfide photoelectrodes for PEC applications, with the aim of evaluating the vital parameters required for the design of metal sulfide photocathodes and photoanodes. Detailed discussions of various metal sulfide photocathodes and photoanodes used for PEC applications are provided. Apart from the most commonly used binary metal sulfides (CdS, MoS2 and ZnS), ternary and quaternary metal sulfides (including the recently explored ZnIn2S4, Cu2ZnSnS4 and CuInGaS2) will also be reviewed thoroughly. More importantly, we summarize the key design strategies to design a high-performing metal sulfide photoelectrode by providing an overview of the design criteria as well as highlighting the main differences in fabricating metal sulfide photocathodes and photoanodes.Cui Ying ToeCui Ying Toe received her PhD degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, in 2018 and bachelor's degree from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Malaysia, in 2014.

1. Introduction
For the past few decades, climate change has been a major concern of humanity. To mitigate climate change, transition to renewable clean energy is crucial to meet the rising global energy demand in a sustainable manner. Photoelectrocatalysis that enables the direct conversion of solar energy into chemical fuel is a promising strategy to alleviate the current energy issue and produce renewable clean fuel. Although photovoltaic integrated electrochemical systems (PV-EC) have achieved practical solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH) for commercialization, there exists significant potential for in-depth investigation of photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems.1 In particular, by combining PV with PEC systems, a recent study demonstrated that a standalone solar water splitting system composed of a perovskite solar cell and a silicon photocathode can achieve a ηSTH of more than 17%.2 Apart from PEC water splitting that produces H2 and O2,3–7 various other promising PEC applications, including CO2 reduction,8–10 organic waste degradation and organic synthesis,11–13 exist as attractive alternatives for further investigation.
Sulfide-based materials have recently attracted tremendous attention in various applications, such as photovoltaics,14 photo(electro)catalysis,15,16 sensing17,18 and energy storage.19,20 In particular, they have been widely reported as highly efficient photocatalysts for photochemical reactions, including photocatalytic hydrogen generation,21,22 CO2 reduction23,24 or organic degradation25–27 due to the excellent light absorption ability and charge transfer properties. Metal sulfides were formed from one or more metal elements incorporated with S elements, as highlighted in the periodic table (Fig. 1) that demonstrated all the existing metal sulfides used for PEC applications. Based on the number of metallic elements, they are usually classified into binary (i.e. CdS and ZnS), ternary (i.e. ZnIn2S4 and CuInS2) and quaternary sulfides (i.e. Cu2ZnSnS4). Generally, the less positive valence occupied by the S 3p orbital (when compared to O 2p) and small effective mass carriers allow metal sulfides to possess an appropriate energy band structure, wide photoabsorption range and fast charge carrier dynamics, making them promising alternatives in photovoltaic, photocatalytic and PEC devices.28 For PEC applications, metal sulfides have stood out among various other photoelectrodes, owing to their outstanding light absorption ability, appropriate band structure and structural tunability (in terms of size, morphology, crystallinity and chemical composition) that resulted in tailorable chemical, physical, optical and electronic properties. For instance, ternary Cu–In–S materials with different crystal morphologies, compositions, and switchable n-type and p-type semiconducting properties can be fabricated by tuning the rate of cation exchange or varying the amount of the sulfur precursor during the synthesis process.29
 Fig. 1  Common metal elements (highlighted in red) used to construct binary, ternary or quaternary sulfide photoelectrodes for PEC applications. 
Most of the metal sulfide photoelectrodes (except for ZnS and MnS) are visible light active with band gaps lower than 3.0 eV. For instance, CdS is a widely studied semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 2.4 eV, excellent charge transport properties, ideal band positions and high electronic mobility.30 In addition, quaternary sulfide materials, such as copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) and copper indium gallium sulfide (CIGS), possess a band gap as low as 1.4 eV and 1.1 eV,31,32 respectively and are often employed as photoabsorbers. The diverse design of metal sulfides indicates the flexibility in regulating the structural, optical and electronic properties with respect to the desired applications. One of the most attractive features of metal sulfide materials is their tailorable semiconducting type (i.e. n- or p-type). It is generally known that chemical doping or defect formation alters the semiconducting type, thus enabling the flexibility of metal sulfides to be employed as either a photocathode or photoanode. For instance, modulation of n- and p-type behavior of copper indium sulfide (CIS) can be attained by varying the rate of ion exchange reaction or performing oxidation stripping treatment via an electrochemical method.29,33 Applied potentials to the electrode allow for the injection of electrons or holes that resulted in the tunable properties of CIS between n-type and p-type, respectively. Likewise, n- and p-type ZnS was distinctively obtained in high and low Zn2+ precursor concentration during electrodeposition.34 Another common approach for tuning the semiconducting type of metal sulfides is by inducing cationic or anionic defects. For instance, indium-rich CIS materials possess n-type properties, while Cu-rich CIS materials show p-type semiconducting behavior.35 While n-type materials are used as photoanodes for oxidation reaction, p-type materials are made into photocathodes for reduction reaction. Under certain circumstances, a p-type semiconductor will be coupled with an n-type semiconductor, forming a p–n junction to optimize the charge separation efficiency. The passivation of an n-type CdS layer on a p-type CZTS photocathode and coating of p-type MoS2 on an n-type CdS photoanode are two examples that induced built in potential gradient within the junction to achieve higher charge injection efficiency.
Unlike photocatalysis that allows for photoreduction and photooxidation to occur on the same photocatalyst, the distinct roles of the photocathode and photoanode (for reduction and oxidation, respectively) during PEC application also indicate that different design criteria are required for constructing metal sulfide photocathodes and photoanodes.36 With an increasing number of studies focusing on the design of active metal sulfide photoanodes and photocathodes, it is of interest to have a comprehensive review that compiles and compares the existing metal sulfides used in PEC systems. Other review papers published recently have highlighted some common strateiges to improve metal sulfide photoelectrodes based on controlled fabrication or specifically referring to metal sulfide/oxide heterostructures. However, no one has discussed the different requirements that need to be considered when constructing a photocathode or photoanode. Therefore, this article not only reviews the recent publications that use metal sulfide photoelectrodes for various PEC applications, but our perspective on the key considerations for the design of metal sulfide photocathodes or photoanodes is discussed.
2. PEC configurations

Fig. 2a shows the common PEC configuration with an n-type photoanode employed for oxidation reaction due to its upward band bending, which is beneficial for driving the photogenerated holes to the electrolyte. Likewise, a p-type semiconductor is usually used as a photocathode owing to its downward band bending upon illumination (Fig. 2b), allowing photogenerated electrons to transfer from the semiconductor to the electrolyte for the reduction reactions. In both cases (Fig. 2a and b), a counter electrode is used to drive the other half reaction. In addition, different from photocatalytic reactions, PEC systems generate oxidized and reduced products in separate electrodes, which can effectively avoid the mixing of oxidized and reduced products, easing the post-treatment processes.37 In most instances, external bias is required to assist the overall reaction when only one photoelectrode is applied to drive the half reaction. More recently, photovoltaic modules are used to provide the external bias, forming a PV-PEC tandem system (Fig. 2c), where light with photon energy smaller than the bandgap penetrates the photoelectrode and is then absorbed by the PV module. This enables an enhanced utilization of the solar spectrum which also provides additional photovoltage originating from the PV module to assist the overall reaction. Apart from the half reaction photoelectrode, both a photoanode and photocathode can be integrated in one PEC configuration, which enables self-biased photo-oxidation and photo-reduction reactions (Fig. 2d).
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagram of different PEC configurations: (a) an n-type semiconductor photoanode electrically connected to a metal counter electrode, (b) a p-type semiconductor photocathode electrically connected to a metal counter electrode, (c) an n-type photoanode-PV module tandem system electrically connected to a metal counter electrode and (d) an unbiased PEC system with both a photoanode and photocathode. 
Recently, unbiased PEC systems are attracting increasing research interest as they enable the direct conversion from solar energy to chemical energy, which is driven by the photovoltage difference between the photocathode and photoanode. Different light illumination directions and the photoelectrode stacking of unbiased PEC systems can be categorized into three distinct configurations. First, photoelectrodes are connected using an external circuit while light is illuminated from one photoelectrode and the portion of light that is not absorbed will penetrate to another photoelectrode (Fig. 3a). The other similar configuration is stacking the photoelectrodes back-to-back on a transparent conductive layer (Fig. 3b); no visible wire is required as the photogenerated electrons and holes can move spontaneously through the conductive layer upon illumination. In both configurations, the front photoelectrodes are required to be more transparent to enable a portion of light passing to the other photoelectrode.38 The front photoelectrode usually absorbs the solar spectrum of shorter wavelength and the back photoelectrode utilizes the transmitted long-wavelength light. Another configuration involves both photoelectrodes connected through an external circuit and illuminated parallelly (Fig. 3c). The tandem configurations allow for the solar spectrum to be efficiently utilized when compared to the parallel configurations. Note that it is also more technique demanding to fabricate photoelectrodes with stacking configuration. In addition to the configuration, onset potential is also an important criterion when designing unbiased PEC systems as it determines the flat-band potentials of the photoelectrodes and, in turn, determines the photovoltage. By evaluating onset potential, compatible photoelectrodes can be chosen to construct a complete tandem cell. Boosted research interest and great progress have been achieved in developing high performance unbiased PEC systems and the latest publication showed that large scale (5 cm × 5 cm photoelectrodes) efficient water splitting systems can achieve an overall solar to hydrogen efficiency of 3.17% in an unbiased PEC system with tandem illumination.39

3. Metal sulfide photocathodes
As mentioned above (Fig. 2b), the downward band bending of the p-type semiconductor is beneficial for driving photoelectrons to the electrolyte for reduction reaction. Given that the most commonly used binary sulfide materials (e.g. CdS and ZnS) exhibit intrinsic n-type properties, there are only limited studies that investigated a standalone binary sulfide semiconductor as a photocathode. Nonetheless, n-type sulfide materials play an important role as a surface modification layer or co-catalyst on other p-type semiconductors, to form a p–n heterojunction or electron sink for improved charge transfer. In contrast, quaternary sulfides mainly serve as the photocathode due to their intrinsic p-type properties. The recent explorations of quaternary sulfide photocathodes for PEC applications are mainly due to the promising performance of these materials in photovoltaic systems. In this section, we review the studies that used binary, ternary and quaternary sulfide materials as photocathodes for PEC reduction reaction.
3.1 Binary sulfide photocathodes
As the simplest metal sulfides, binary sulfides (such as CdS, ZnS, CuxS, MoS2 and SnSx) are widely investigated due to their flexible synthesis process, relatively simple chemical structure, and promising performance. Among them, Cu2S and SnS are known as good p-type photoabsorbers with a suitable band gap and high light absorption coefficient. However, they are not often used as a standalone photocathode because of the rapid charge recombination that leads to a very low PEC performance. In contrast, some other binary sulfides, such as CdS and SnS2, show intrinsic n-type properties, which are also seldom used as the main photoabsorber of photocathodes because of the upward band bending that suppresses the photogenerated electron injection into the electrolyte (as shown in Fig. 2). As a well-established sulfide material, elemental doping of CdS has demonstrated successful transition from n-type to p-type properties, thereby enabling its applications as a photocathode. For instance, a p-type CdS:Cu photocathode was constructed by introducing Cu doping via thermal diffusion during the growth of a CdS thin film.41 It revealed that the p-type CdS is a feasible photocathode candidate for water splitting and can overcome the shortcomings of n-type CdS with an upward band bending upon illumination. Likewise, another study demonstrated that cationic exchange-induced Cu+ doping transformed an n-type Au@CdS photoanode into a p-type Cu-doped Au@CdS photocathode, as illustrated in Fig. 4a and b.42 By combining the n-type undoped Au@CdS photoanode with the p-type Cu-doped Au@CdS photocathode, a tandem PEC cell was constructed for unbiased overall water splitting reaction.

In fact, most of the binary metal sulfide materials are seldom used as a standalone photocathode due to their limited light absorption range, sluggish charge transfer properties or photocorrosion issues. In this regard, the combination of binary sulfides with other semiconducting materials is a common and effective strategy to exploit their benefits and at the same time mitigate the above-mentioned drawbacks. Integration of binary sulfides with other sulfide, oxide, nitride or phosphide materials is summarized in the following sections.

3.1.1 Formation of sulfide–sulfide heterostructures. 
Generally, Cu2S exhibits a direct band gap of 1.8 eV and an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV, which can theoretically deliver a power conversion efficiency of 30% as a single-junction solar cell.43 Benefiting from its high light absorption coefficient and low cost, heterojunction design of Cu2S with another binary sulfide has also formed promising photocathodes for PEC water splitting.44 As illustrated in Fig. 5a and b, the cationic exchange method was used to prepare Cu2S/CdS photocathodes with TiO2 as the protection layer and RuOx as the hydrogen evolution co-catalyst.45 With the construction of a Cu2S/CdS heterojunction, the charge separation of pristine Cu2S was intensively improved while the coating of the TiO2 layer and decoration of RuOx further enhanced the overall stability and hydrogen evolution performance. A photocurrent density of up to −7.0 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V and an onset potential of 0.48 V vs. RHE have been achieved under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight illumination.

Similarly, SnxS is also a well-known metal sulfide consisting of only earth-abundant elements. Orthorhombic phase of SnS is a p-type semiconductor with a two-dimensional layered structure. It exhibits a suitable band gap (1.3 eV) for light harvesting and high hole mobility as well as appropriate carrier concentration.46 Incorporation of ultra large SnS nanosheets with CdS to form a FTO/SnS/CdS/Pt photocathode has attained a photocurrent density of −389.5 μA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl.47 Recently, the (111)- and (101)-oriented SnS nanoplate based photocathodes have been coupled with n-type CdS and TiO2 by Moon et al., forming favorable band alignment for reduction reaction.48 As illustrated in Fig. 5c, both horizontally aligned and vertically aligned SnS were prepared via modulating the seed-layer orientation. It was found that the vertically aligned SnS nanosheet exhibited better PEC performance when compared to the photocathode with horizontally aligned SnS. The as obtained Pt/TiO2/CdS/SnS/Au/FTO photocathode exhibited a boosted photocurrent density of −19 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, establishing a new benchmark for SnS photocathodes. In addition, an onset potential of around 0.25 V vs. RHE is observed regardless of the SnS seed type, which also originates from the interfacial engineering of SnS. SnS2, which has a wider band gap (2.2–2.4 eV) when compared to SnS, is an intrinsic n-type semiconductor.49 Therefore, it is more suitable to be employed as an n-type overlayer on the photocathodes. For example, Cao et al. demonstrated a facile one-pot method to fabricate a SnS/SnS2 nanosheet photocathode. The SnS/SnS2 p–n junction was established to enhance the charge transport properties; thus, the as obtained FTO/SnS/SnS2/Pt photocathode displayed a photocurrent density of more than 2 times higher than that of the FTO/SnS/Pt photocathode.50


3.1.2 Formation of sulfide-oxide heterostructures. 
Given that binary metal sulfide often has n-type semiconducting properties, it has been used as the surface modification layer on p-type metal oxide photocathodes to form p–n junctions with improved charge separation efficiency. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is widely studied as an oxide photocathode material due to its intrinsic p-type properties induced by the presence of Cu vacancies. Owing to its serious photocorrosion issue, passivation of an overlayer on the Cu2O photoabsorber is one of the most promising strategies to improve the charge separation efficiency and reduce the photocorrosion tendency.51 As such, passivation of CuxS on Cu2O is an attractive approach due to the simplicity in coating CuxS via the direct ion exchange method.52 Zhang et al. have fabricated a Cu2S–Ni/Cu2O photocathode via the ion exchange method in the presence of 0.5 M Na2S (Fig. 6a).53 The presence of the Ni interlayer does not only enhance the overall conductivity of the film, but also increase the CuxS formation rate on the surface of Cu2O. This has led to a better photocurrent density (up to −3 mA cm−2 at −0.15 V vs. RHE) as well as better stability when compared with pristine Cu2O. Likewise, another study has incorporated CuS into Cu2O/Cu to create the gradient band structure, thereby facilitating the photogenerated charge transfer.54 With the lower conduction band position of CuS than Cu2O, the photoexcited electrons can be effectively transferred to the CuS for surface reduction reaction upon illumination, improving the overall PEC wastewater treatment performance. Apart from CuxS, coating of the CdS layer on the CuO photocathode also enabled the construction of a p–n junction.55 A photocurrent density of up to −1.68 mA cm−2 was achieved at 0 V vs. RHE with the coating of the CdS buffer layer, TiO2 protective layer and deposition of Pt co-catalyst (Fig. 6b and c). In a separate study, CdS was coated on a ternary oxide material (CuFe2O4), to form a CuFe2O4/CdS heterostructure for PEC CO2 reduction to methanol.56 The well-aligned band structure of CdS and CuFe2O4 has contributed to a six times higher photocurrent density and improved stability of the CuFe2O4/CdS photocathode when compared to bare CuFe2O4.

3.1.3 Other binary sulfide-based heterostructures. 
Apart from sulfide–sulfide and sulfide-oxide composites, binary sulfide has also been incorporated with nitride, phosphide or other semiconductors. Given that most of the well-established oxide materials (e.g. TiO2, ZnO, WO3 or SrTiO3) are n-type materials, less attention has been devoted to the development of oxide photocathodes (except for Cu2O and doped-SrTiO3). In contrast, g-C3N4, GaInP2, Sb2Se3, InPx and Si semiconductors (the most recognized solar cell material) have all been loaded with binary metal sulfide co-catalysts to be employed as photocathodes in PEC applications.57–61 For example, a g-C3N4/CdS heterojunction photocathode was fabricated for PEC nitrofurazone degradation, in which g-C3N4/CdS exhibited an extended light absorption range as well as improved charge separation efficiency when compared to bare g-C3N4.57 For MoS2, Jing Gu et al. demonstrated that constructing a bilayer of amorphous TiOx and MoSx on a GaInP2 photocathode resulted in a current density of −11 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE with superior stability.58 Bulk MoS2, which naturally occurs as molybdenite, has a layered hexagonally packed structure consisting of S–Mo–S sheets held together in stacks by van der Waals interactions.62 The S atoms present at the Mo-edge sites are excellent active sites for H binding, making MoS2 a promising HER catalyst with comparable performance to Pt.63 However, as the conduction band position of MoS2 is slightly less energetic than that for the HER, it can only be used as a photocathode material for the HER under negative applied potential.64 Therefore, MoS2 is more commonly used as a co-catalyst rather than a photoabsorber. For instance, MoS2 was also used as a co-catalyst and protective layer on Sb2Se3 nanorod (NR) arrays. The fabricated MoS2/Sb2Se3 NR PEC device has achieved a photocurrent density of −10 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE in a buffered solution (pH 6.5) under a standard simulated air mass 1.5 solar illumination.59

3.2 Ternary sulfide photocathodes
Despite the great progress achieved in binary sulfide-based photocathodes, their intrinsic drawbacks such as photocorrosion, limited chemical composition and band gap are a challenge. In this regard, ternary and quaternary metal sulfides have attracted increasing research interest as they retain high light absorption coefficient and carrier mobility while at the same time possess adjustable chemical composition and tunable band gaps.65,66 Ternary sulfides consist of two metal elements and a sulfur atom. There are a variety of ternary metal sulfides, such as the most commonly studied CuInS2, CuGaS2, ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4. Given that copper-based semiconductors are a promising photocathode material (due to their intrinsic copper deficiency that induces p-type semiconducting properties), CuInS2 and CuGaS2 are the ternary sulfides that show intrinsic p-type properties and are commonly used as photocathodes. In contrast, ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4 are intrinsic n-type semiconductors that are commonly used as photoanodes (refer to Section 4.2 for more details).

3.2.1 Copper indium sulfide. 
Copper indium sulfide (CuInS2) is a frequently used metal sulfide photocatalyst (with a band gap of approx. 1.55 eV) given its high carrier mobility, high light absorption coefficient and optimal energy band structure.67 As a visible light photoabsorber, the bare CuInS2 thin film photocathode exhibited limited photocurrent density due to its serious charge recombination. Therefore, CuInS2 has been widely incorporated with other materials to improve the overall PEC performance. Coating of an In2S3 buffer layer and deposition of Pt co-catalyst on CuInS2 has significantly improved the photocurrent density of the bare CuInS2 photocathode.68 The construction of a p–n heterojunction has improved the photogenerated charge separation due to the induced built-in electric field between CuInS2 and In2S3. Another study synthesized a hybrid dot-disk Au–CuInS2 photocathode by controlling the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of CuInS2 on Au seeds. The half-cell constructed using the Au–CuInS2 photocathode reached a solar-to-hydrogen evolution efficiency of 4.29% at −0.438 V vs. RHE. This was attributed to the heterostructure and the plasmon-exciton coupling in Au–CuInS2, facilitating the photogenerated electron transfer as well as the hydrogen generation rate.69 Similarly, the coating of FeOOH and Pt layers on both sides of the CuInS2 photoabsorber layer demonstrated enhanced overall PEC water splitting performance (Fig. 7a and b). FeOOH worked as a hole-capturing layer to effectively extract photogenerated holes, while Pt was the electron sink that increased the electron transfer rate from CuInS2 to the electrolyte.70 A significantly improved photocurrent density up to −6.79 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. RHE was evidenced in FeOOH/CuInS2/Pt, which is 3.1 times higher than that of pure CuInS2 (−2.17 mA cm−2). Apart from the commonly used metal co-catalysts, other hydrogen evolving co-catalysts, such as SnS2,71 MoS2 (ref. 72) or TaOx,73 have also been used to enhance the PEC hydrogen evolution performance of CuInS2 photocathodes. Deposition of SnS2 nanosheets on CuInS2 was demonstrated to construct a p–n junction between CuInS2 and SnS2, which contributed to better charge transfer across the photocathode when compared to bare CuInS2 photocathodes.71 In addition to p–n junction engineering, type II NaNbO3/In2S3/CuInS2 (Fig. 7c) and Z-scheme NaNbO3/CuInS2/In2S3 core/shell (Fig. 7d) photocathodes have been designed and compared.74 The obtained Z-scheme NaNbO3/CuInS2/In2S3 photocathodes effectively separated the reduction and oxidation sites, leading to an enhanced charge transfer. Upon illumination, the photogenerated electrons at the conduction band of In2S3 recombined with the holes at the valence band of CuInS2, which enabled the electrons at the conduction band of CuInS2 to be transferred to NaNbO3 for surface water reduction reaction.

Apart from HER applications, the CuInS2 photocathode was also used for PEC CO2 reduction, benefiting from its relatively high conduction band.75 Methanol was detected as the main product of the bare CuInS2 photocathode fabricated via an electrodeposition method, achieving a faradaic efficiency of 97%. By further combining with other co-catalysts (i.e. CuFeO2 nanoparticles), a longer chain carbon product (i.e. ethanol) was also detected.76 CuFeO2 was decorated on CuInS2 thin films by pulse electrodeposition, which formed a Cu-rich surface on the CuFeO2/CuInS2 photocathode. The Cu-rich surface has contributed to an accelerated charge transfer performance and promoted the production of *CO intermediate, resulting in an enhanced methanol and ethanol yield rate when compared to bare CuInS2. It was also confirmed by Takashima et al. that when Au or Ag was loaded on the CdS-modified CuInS2 photoelectrode, CO was produced as the main product from PEC CO2 reduction reaction.77
Nanostructure engineering is also an effective strategy to regulate the optical properties and increase the active surface area of metal sulfide photoelectrodes. As illustrated in Fig. 8a and b, three-dimensional hexagonally ordered micro-bowl arrays (MBA) were designed as the substrate for the growth of CuInS2 nanosheets for efficient visible-light-driven solar water splitting.78 By further decorating CdS quantum dots on the CuInS2 nanosheets, the CuInS2/CdS@MBA photocathode obtained an enhanced photocurrent density (−165 μA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE). This was attributed to the hierarchical structure that enhanced light trapping ability and increased the surface area for CuInS2 and CdS loading. Furthermore, CuInS2 nanowires were obtained via a self-sacrificial template-directed method using Cu2S nanowires as a template. It was confirmed that the light absorption ability of CuInS2 nanowires was greatly enhanced compared with the pristine Cu2S nanowires. After further decoration of CdS quantum dots, the overall PEC performance of CuInS2/CdS photocathodes was enhanced due to the improved light absorption of CuInS2 nanowires and accelerated charge transfer with CdS decoration.79 Cation exchange between Cu+ and In3+ ions was reported to fabricate hollow-structured CuInS2 nanododecahedrons from solid Cu2−xS templates (Fig. 8c). Inward diffusion of In3+ over the lateral facets and the directional anisotropic diffusion of Cu+ ions formed a hollow structure, enabling improved light trapping and scattering ability. The PEC hydrogen evolution performance of the hollow CuInS2 photocathode was also significantly improved with prolonged ion-exchange reaction time (up to 2 hours as shown in Fig. 8d).80

3.2.2 Copper gallium sulfide (CuGaS2). 
Unlike CuInS2, CuGaS2 exhibits a larger band gap of 2.4 eV and is a visible light active ternary sulfide material.81 The CuGaS2 thin film has been employed as a photocathode for PEC CO2 reduction82 and organic reduction,83 owing to its favorable conduction band position. Kodo et al. have incorporated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into the CuGaS2 photocathode for enhanced PEC water reduction to hydrogen. The intimate contact between 2D rGO sheets and CuGaS2 particles improved the charge transfer efficiency, thereby achieving higher photocurrent density under visible light irradiation (Fig. 9a and b).81 Moreover, close to 100% faradaic efficiency towards the hydrogen evolution reaction was achieved by the rGO/CuGaS2 photocathode. Subsequently, an unbiased PEC water splitting system was also set up using rGO/CuGaS2 as the photocathode and Co/BiVO4 as the photoanode (Fig. 9c). CuGaS2 has also been used as a photocathode for nitrobenzene reduction to aniline.83 By virtue of Bi doping, the band gap of CuGaS2 was red shifted, enabling absorption of a broader light spectrum (Fig. 9d). With the improved light absorption, Bi-doped CuGaS2 converted 83% of nitrobenzene to aniline within 100 minutes, which was approximately 40% higher than that of the undoped CuGaS2 photocathodes.

3.2.3 Cadmium zinc sulfide. 
Ternary sulfides are often formed by doping or substitution of metal elements in the binary sulfides with another transition metal element. Apart from the p-type copper-based ternary sulfide photocathode, CdxZn1−xS is revealed as an alternative to ZnS and CdS with tunable compositions and band structures. A variety of methods have been demonstrated to successfully tune the band structures of CdxZn1−xS, including successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction,84 hydrothermal method85 and chemical bath deposition.86 By varying the x value in CdxZn1−xS, a series of ternary metal sulfides can be obtained with tunable band positions, which are known as promising n-type modification layers on many photocathode materials.87,88 For example, the CdxZn1−xS layer was applied via a chemical bath deposition method on the Sb2Se3 photocathode.87 It was found that the ratio of Zn/Cd significantly influenced the properties of the Sb2Se3/CdxZn1−xS/Pt photocathode. By carefully tailoring the composition of the CdxZn1−xS layer, the Sb2Se3/Cd0.5Zn0.5S/Pt photocathode achieved the best photocurrent density of −17.5 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE with a remarkably high onset potential of 0.8 V vs. RHE, which contributes to a promising half-cell solar to hydrogen efficiency of 2.19%. Similarly, a columnar cactus-like 2D/1D CdxCu1−xS@CuO shell–core structure was constructed via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method, contributing to an increased specific surface area, broadened visible light absorbance, effective charge transfer and improved PEC performance.89

3.3 Quaternary sulfide photocathodes
As a type of relatively complicated metal sulfide, the development of quaternary metal sulfides in PEC applications is fraught with challenges due to their tedious preparation method, complex structure and composition. However, with the boosted progress of quaternary metal sulfides in photovoltaic devices, increasing research interest has been aroused to develop effective quaternary metal sulfide photocathodes. Copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4) and copper indium gallium sulfide (Cu(In,Ga)S2) are two most studied quaternary sulfide materials that possess a promising photovoltaic efficiency of 11% and 16.9%, respectively.90,91 The well-designed PV structures of these quaternary sulfide materials have recently been adopted for PEC studies for PEC H2 generation or CO2 reduction.

3.3.1 Copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS). 
Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is considered a promising p-type semiconductor for PEC solar water splitting due to its earth-abundance, low toxicity, outstanding light absorption ability, and high carrier mobility properties. It exhibits a band gap of 1.5 eV, leading to an ideal open-circuit voltage (Voc) and photocurrent for solar cells and solar water splitting.92 A variety of methods can be used to prepare CZTS thin films, such as electrodeposition,93 hybrid ink deposition94 and vacuum sputtering.95 In addition, uniformity and phase purity are the key factors affecting the quality of CZTS thin films. The formation of secondary phases such as ZnS and Cu2S resulted in the decreases in charge collection efficiency and device active area.96 In order to increase the charge separation performance of pristine CZTS, an n-type semiconductor layer, such as CdS, is often used as a buffer layer to construct a p–n junction, which is proved to effectively enhance the charge transfer efficiency as well as the onset potential.97 Apart from constructing p–n junctions, different strategies have been applied to prepare different overlayers or protective layers on CZTS in order to increase the photocurrent density and stability, as well as high solar to hydrogen efficiency. For example, a Pt/In2S3/CdS/CZTS photocathode has been studied with novel In2S3/CdS as the buffer layer on a CZTS thin film. An appreciable enhancement of the photocurrent (−9.3 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE) and an onset potential of 0.63 V vs. RHE were observed, resulting in a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 1.63% obtained with significantly improved stability.98 In 2018, a CdS/CZTS photocathode modified with a 6 nm thick HfO2 layer achieved a solar to hydrogen efficiency of 2.7% with an improved long-term PEC photocurrent stability over 10 h.92 An unbiased solar water splitting device based on the Pt/HfO2/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 photocathode in tandem with a BiVO4 photoanode has also been constructed, contributing to a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.046%, as illustrated in Fig. 10a and b.92 Recently, Pt nanoparticles (Ptnp) were deposited on TiO2 nanoballs (NB) by Li et al. and were applied as the overlayer on the CZTS/CdS photocathode (Fig. 10c and d). The as-obtained Ptnp/TiO2-nanoball/CdS/CZTS photocathode exhibited better photogenerated electron collection efficiency and suppressed charge combination rate, resulting in the highest solar to hydrogen efficiency of more than 3.5%.99

Apart from the different overlayers on CZTS, cation substitution,100 element doping,101 and metal alloying were also effective methods to promote the PEC performance of CZTS thin films.102 In addition, due to the favorable band structure of CZTS, it has also been used as a photocathode in PEC CO2 reduction. In 2018, Umezawa et al. confirmed that CZTS has a sufficient conduction band minimum (CBM) position to drive the CO2 reduction reaction.103 CO was detected as a CO2 reduction product under visible light irradiation with an applied potential of −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Recently, Zhou et al. has also demonstrated the capability to tune the product selectivity of PEC CO2 reduction via surficial vacancy engineering of CZTS/CdS photocathode, favouring C–C coupling pathways that generated methanol and ethanol products.225 Moreover, it was also shown by Wang et al. that the CZTS/CdS/Pt photocathode can directly convert toluene to methylcyclohexane, which was one of the most promising systems for hydrogen storage.93


3.3.2 Copper Indium Gallium Sulfide (Cu(In,Ga)Sx, CIGS). 
Similar to CZTS, Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) is also a p-type semiconductor with a chalcopyrite crystal structure and tunable band gap from 1.5 to 2.4 eV by adjusting the elemental ratio of Ga/(In + Ga).104 CIGS is an excellent photocathode material, owing to the tunable band gaps, high light absorption coefficients and high carrier mobility.105 However, pristine CIGS photocathodes suffer from poor stability and serious bulk charge recombination. In this regard, different overlayers and co-catalysts have been developed to improve the performance of CIGS-based photocathodes and great progress has been achieved. For example, Guijarro et al. demonstrated an all-solution-based route for fabricating Cu(In,Ga)S2 photocathodes coated with CdS, TiO2, and Pt, which exhibited a photocurrent density up to −8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE.106 Subsequently, the C3N4−xS3x/2/CdS/CIGS heterojunction photocathode was fabricated and achieved a maximum photocurrent of −5 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V vs. RHE with a positively shifted onset potential when compared to the bare CIGS photocathode.107 It also exhibits outstanding stability of up to 20 h in neutral electrolytes in the absence of co-catalysts. Antimony halide was also used as a grain growth promoter for the fabrication of solution-processable CIGS photocathodes, which was shown to induce the coalescence of the initial CIGS nanocrystals. It was shown that a photocurrent density of −5 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE and an onset potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE were attained by the CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2 photocathode that was fabricated using SbI3 as the grain growth promoter instead of SbCl3 (−1 mA cm−2).108 In addition, successful fabrication of high-performing CIGS photocathodes without the deposition of an n-type charge extraction overlayer originated from the reorganization of surface energetics in the presence of the growth promoter and the reduction in grain boundaries (increase in grain size). In a separate study, the co-deposition of Ni–Mo on the CdS/CIGS photocathode was also achieved without using a noble metal co-catalyst, obtaining a high photocurrent density of 15–25 mA cm−2.109
The sulfur atom in CIGS has often been substituted by the Se atom to form Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe). Kim et al. presented a CIGSSe photocathode with grown-in CuxS hydrogen evolving catalysts, enabling solar water splitting without the deposition of additional n-type overlayers. The controlled two-step chalcogenization using a Cu-rich CuInGa precursor film resulted in the formation of the CuxS co-catalyst at the CIGSSe surface, leading to a maximum photocurrent density of −25.7 mA cm−2 and improved stability.110 Apart from different overlayers or co-catalysts deposited on CIGS thin films, doping111 and composition engineering112 are also powerful methods for tuning the optical and PEC performance of CIGS based photocathodes.


3.3.3 Other quaternary sulfides. 
There are also some other quaternary sulfides with a similar kesterite structure or chalcopyrite structure. For example, it is reported that CZTS exhibits intrinsic defects including cationic disorder and antisite defect originated bandtail disadvantage.113 In this regard, Zou et al. demonstrated a cost-effective and reproducible aqueous solution approach to prepare large-grain p-type Cu2BaSnS4(CBTS) films, which obtained a photocurrent density of −4 mA cm−2 for bare Mo/CBTS photocathodes at 0 V vs. RHE under 100 mW cm−2 illumination.114 Similarly, Cu2ZnGeS4 (CZGS) with a relatively wide bandgap and negative conduction band minimum when compared to CZTS has been discovered by Kudo et al. The more negative conduction band makes it a suitable candidate for PEC CO2 reduction when a large overpotential is required.115 Moreover, the family of quaternary sulfides is becoming larger and larger with the development of modelling and theory calculations. Recently, quaternary sulfides such as Cu2SrSnS4,116 AgCuInS2 (ref. 117) and AgFeNi2S4 (ref. 118) have also been used as photocathodes for PEC applications.

3.4 Photocathode's outlook
As summarized in Table 1, great development has been made over the last few years on metal sulfides as photocathodes. Although most of the binary metal sulfides are n-type semiconductors, elemental doping method is an effective alternative to achieve the transformation from n-type to p-type semiconductors. In addition, these n-type metal sulfides can work as an excellent overlayer on other photocathode materials to construct p–n junctions or serve as co-catalysts, which is known to effectively raise the onset potential. Ternary metal sulfides like CuInS2 exhibit boosted PEC performance over the past few years, which originates from their excellent light adsorption ability and feasibility in preparation. In addition, inspired by the highly efficient photovoltaic devices, quaternary metal sulfides such as CZTS or CIGS have been regarded as one of the most promising photocathode materials for the future industrial applications in PEC water splitting.

According to the state of the art photocathodes, many of the photovoltaic structures have also been proved to be effective in PEC reactions. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the knowledge transfer from photocatalysis and photovoltaics, such as constructing Z-scheme structures,119,120 optimizing the band alignment121,122 and applying ultra-thin overlayers.73,123 In addition, coupling with other high performance electrocatalysts can also be considered when designing the photocathodes as these strategies are all known to efficiently shift the onset potential and increase the overall PEC performance. Meanwhile, using theoretical calculations to provide guidance on photocathode material synthesis or configuration design can also be taken into consideration in the future. It is also worth noticing that most of the photocathodes in this review are mainly for PEC water splitting, while many other reduction reactions, including CO2 reduction, organic synthesis, ammonia production and pollutant reduction, can also be further explored.
4. Metal sulfides as photoanodes
Unlike photocathodes that are often a p-type semiconductor, n-type semiconductors are commonly used as photoanode materials for PEC oxidation reactions. Owing to the sluggish charge kinetics of oxidation reactions (i.e. water or organic oxidations), the overall oxidation efficiency is highly dependent on the photoanode design. Generally, an energetic valence band that is more positive than the reaction redox potential is desired to achieve high oxidation rate.28 Nonetheless, proper tuning of the valence band position is also important to avoid over-oxidation of organics for selective oxidation reaction.136 Following the discovery of the TiO2 photoanode for PEC water splitting in 1972,137 various other metal oxide photoanodes (e.g. ZnO, Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4) have progressively been developed. Although metal oxide photoanodes possess a deep valence band consisting of the O 2p orbital and are commonly known to be stable, the photoactivity is still limited by their low light absorption capability and poor charge kinetics.
Similar to photocathode development, recent advancement in photoanodes has seen a strong interest in metal sulfide semiconductors due to their suitable band structure, excellent charge kinetics, tailorable architecture, chemical composition and optical properties.28,138 Although most of the binary and ternary sulfide materials (e.g. CdS, WS2, ZnS, MoS2, Bi2S3, CuInS2 and Zn2InS4) tend to possess n-type properties due to the unavoidable formation of sulfur vacancies during synthesis, the semiconducting properties are known to be tunable based on the change in crystal structures and phases upon post-synthesis treatment. Herein, we discussed the recent findings of metal sulfide photoanodes in various PEC applications, focusing on the benefits and issues of each metal sulfide photoanode, strategies to improve the overall performance and our perspective for future development of metal sulfide materials. Given the intrinsic n-type properties of binary sulfide materials, many studies have focused on integrating two or more sulfide, oxide or nitride materials to construct an active and robust photoanode.
4.1 Binary sulfide photoanodes
Since possessing n-type properties is one of the essential aspects of photoanode materials, CdS, ZnS, MoS2 and WS2 that are commonly fabricated as n-type materials are some commonly used photoanode sulfide materials. The most studied metal sulfide material, CdS, has been long discovered as a promising photoanode material (despite its photocorrosion issue), given its n-type properties, strong visible light absorption, high electronic mobility, and suitable valence band position to drive oxidation reactions. Bare CdS photoanodes often achieved few hundred μA cm−2 photocurrent density which can be further improved to the mA cm−2 range via co-catalyst deposition or heterojunction formation. For instance, deposition of Pt and Co-Pi on the CdS photoanode has enhanced the photocurrent density by 8.3 times, attaining a photocurrent density of 5 mA cm−2 at 0.28 V vs. RHE (Fig. 11a).139 Without the aid of a co-catalyst, a large area CdS photoanode (up to 37.5 cm2) has also been synthesized via the spray pyrolysis method, achieving 5 mA photocurrent upon solar simulator irradiation (80 mW cm−2) at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 11b).140

Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a II–VI semiconductor, is a promising n-type photoanode owing to its rapid generation of the electron–hole pairs during photoexcitation and highly energetic conduction and valence band positions.141 Unlike most of the other sulfide materials that encounter photocorrosion issue, ZnS is relatively stable upon illumination.142,143 Despite all the superiority, ZnS possesses a wide bandgap of 3.6 eV, which can only be activated by UV light and is not ideal for solar irradiated-PEC applications. Nevertheless, the wide band gap of ZnS has the benefit of being transmittable by visible and infrared light, which served as a good overlayer in a photovoltaic system. To improve the visible light response of ZnS, sulfur and zinc vacancies have both been separately introduced into ZnS for visible light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen generation.141,143 Likewise, co-doping of In and Cu in the ZnS photoanode has improved the water oxidation reaction, which indirectly improves the cathode hydrogen evolution rate for PEC water splitting reaction.144 Owing to the higher surface area and lower charge transfer resistance upon 4 mol% In and 4 mol% Cu co-doping, the resulting photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 12.2 mA cm−2 at 1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
In recent years, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted significant attention due to the versatility in tuning its chemical and physical properties. MoS2 can be tuned from an n-type to p-type material, depending on the chemical structures and phases. Similar to a photocathode, MoS2 has not been utilized as a standalone photoanode or the main photoabsorber (it is often used as a secondary overlayer or co-catalyst on the primary photoanode) because of its small band gap that induces high charge recombination rate. Apart from the above-mentioned metal sulfides, some other binary sulfides that have been used as photoanode materials are PbS,145 In2S3,146 Ag2S,147 CoS,148 Ni3S2,149 SnS2,49 and WS2.150 These sulfide materials were often integrated with other active photoanode materials (e.g. ZnS, TiO2 or ZnO) to enhance the overall charge transfer efficiency and photostability.
Most binary sulfide materials, other than ZnS, are known to have serious photocorrosion issue under prolonged illumination. Unlike Cu2O that undergoes both self-reduction and self-oxidation,151 metal sulfides tend to be oxidized upon illumination, thereby causing a detrimental effect when employed as photoanodes. Meanwhile, the downsides of ZnS with poor light absorption ability and MoS2 with low charge carrier lifetime have limited their capability to be constructed as a standalone photoanode. To overcome these major drawbacks, these binary metal sulfides are commonly integrated with other photocatalysts to boost the charge excitation, transfer and consumption efficiencies. The design of the photoanode based on appropriate band alignment (mostly type II heterojunction) allows for efficient charge injection from one photocatalyst to another, facilitating the charge separation and prolonging the charge lifetime within the materials. As a photoanode material, photoexcited electrons need to be transported effectively through the substrate to the cathode for reduction reaction, while effective consumption of photoinduced holes on the photoanode surface for oxidation reaction is crucial. More importantly, the efficient transfer of holes away from the unstable sulfide photocatalyst will greatly reduce the tendency of self-oxidation reaction. Herein, we summarized studies that have coupled binary sulfide materials with other sulfide, oxide or nitride semiconductors.

4.1.1 Formation of sulfide–sulfide heterostructures. 
Formation of a heterojunction between different binary sulfide materials is a promising route that takes advantage of the favorable properties of each material. For instance, ZnS, which is one of the most stable binary sulfide photocatalysts, was coated on CdS to suppress the photocorrosion of CdS. Meanwhile, the downside of ZnS for having low light absorption ability (due to its large bandgap) can be improved with the presence of visible light active CdS. Zhang et al. have demonstrated that the CdS/ZnS photoanode exhibited 7.8 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 0 V vs. SCE, four times higher than that of uncoated CdS nanorods (Fig. 12a).152 Upon prolonged irradiation, the passivation of ZnS was shown to improve the photostability of CdS nanorods, with a stable photocurrent density of 5.5 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp irradiation (Fig. 12b). A similar phenomenon has been observed for the ZnS/CdS/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) photoanode fabricated via a hydrothermal process.153 Continuous irradiation of the ZnS/CdS/rGO photoanode at a fixed potential of −0.4 V vs. SCE has displayed a more stable photocurrent of 5.8 mA cm−2 when compared to CdS/rGO. The better stability of the ZnS/CdS/rGO photoanode indicated that the presence of ZnS on CdS accelerated the transfer of photogenerated holes to the interstitial sulfur (Is) and zinc vacancies (VZn) of ZnS (Fig. 12c), suppressing CdS photocorrosion. The study has postulated that CdS was excited to generate electron–hole pairs under visible light illumination (note that ZnS will not be activated upon visible light irradiation), which were subsequently separated across the heterojunction interfaces of CdS/rGO and ZnS/CdS. The photoexcited electrons were transferred to the conductive rGO sheets while the holes were transported to ZnS for surface oxidation reaction. CdS has also been integrated with MoS2 to form a p–n junction.154 The loading of 0.14 mol% MoS2 on CdS has increased the photocurrent density from 4 mA cm−2 to 28 mA cm−2. The formation of a p–n junction allows for the photoexcited electron–hole pairs to separate promptly due to the built-in electrostatic field at the MoS2/CdS interface, leading to better charge separation and charge transfer. The excited electrons will be preferentially transferred to CdS and subsequently, to the counter electrode for reduction reaction. Meanwhile, the holes are accumulated in the valence band of MoS2 to be consumed for oxidation reaction on the photoanode surface (Fig. 12d).

Apart from CdS-based heterostructures, other binary sulfide heterostructures, such as MoS2 and WS2 photoanodes, have also been investigated. The MoS2/WS2 photoanode exhibited promising performance for PEC oxidation reaction due to its complementary lattice parameters that allow for rapid charge separation and transfer across the interface.155,156 It was first demonstrated that the formation of a bulk-heterojunction between MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets has increased the rate of water oxidation and improved the PEC performance by up to 10-fold when compared to the MoS2 photoanode, achieving a photocurrent density of 0.45 mA cm−2 upon stimulated solar irradiation (Fig. 13a and b).155 Subsequent fabrication of the large-area MoS2/WS2 photoanode with a flake-like morphology further attained a photocurrent density of 1.7 mA cm−2 under visible light irradiation.156 The MoS2 and WS2 heterostructures form a type-II heterojunction, exhibiting fast separation of the photogenerated charge carriers across the junction. The exceptionally large MoS2/WS2 flakes (>100 times larger in size than commonly synthesized MoS2/WS2) were shown to have high crystallinity and minimal bulk defects, which suppressed the electron–hole recombination rate within the bulk structure, enabling efficient charge transfer across the heterojunction interface.

4.1.2 Formation of sulfide–oxide heterostructures. 
As a photoanode with superior visible light absorption but sluggish electron–hole separation, CdS was commonly integrated with TiO2,157–163 the most established photocatalyst. The wide bandgap, high stability, non-toxicity and high abundancy of TiO2 have well-supplemented the favorable properties of CdS, improving the overall performance of the single component CdS or TiO2 photoanode. For instance, Wang and co-workers161 have successfully demonstrated that the deposition of CdS on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNA) improved the overall light absorption efficiency and photocurrent density during PEC measurements. The use of the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method enabled homogeneous distribution of CdS on TNA, while subsequent annealing at 430 °C for 2 hours ensured a good interfacial contact between CdS and TNA (Fig. 14a–c). The annealed CdS/TNA photoanode (A-CdS/TNA) exhibited a higher photocurrent density of 4.56 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, when compared to the unannealed CdS/TNA (2.57 mA cm−2) and bare TNA (0.63 mA cm−2) photoanodes (Fig. 14d). Similar correlation was observed by Bhat et al.,162 where increased photocurrent density with negatively shifted onset potential was seen upon CdS deposition on TiO2 nanorods. This study also showed that incorporation of MoS2 on CdS/TiO2 further improves the charge separation efficiency, evident by the significantly enhanced photoresponse of the MoS2/CdS/TiO2 photoanode (Fig. 14e–g). Another study showed that coating a protective layer of TiO2 on CdS enhanced the PEC efficiency and stability of the CdS photoanode.163 The use of the atomic-layer deposition (ALD) technique to passivate the ultrathin layer of amorphous TiO2 allows the CdS@TiO2 photoanode to attain a photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm−2 in an unbiased PEC system. More importantly, prolonged stability of the CdS@TiO2 photoanode was achieved with only 9% reduction in photocurrent density upon 9 h of PEC measurement (the photocurrent of the bare CdS photoanode was decreased to zero after 3 h of measurement).

CdS has also been integrated with ZnO to form a type-II heterojunction for enhanced PEC oxidation reaction.164–171 While most studies deposit CdS on ZnO using the SILAR method,164,165 coating of CdS on ZnO nanorods via pulsed electrodeposition can yield a uniformly wrapped ultrathin layer of CdS on ZnO nanorods (Fig. 15a and b).166 The pulsed-electrodeposited CdS/ZnO photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, significantly higher than that of the conventionally synthesized CdS/ZnO photoanode (typically 1–2 mA cm−2) and bare CdS or ZnO photoanodes (Fig. 15c). This is due to the lower charge recombination rate within the heterostructure formed by CdS/ZnO, as illustrated in the lower photoluminescence emission of CdS/ZnO (Fig. 15d). Subsequent studies also revealed that deposition of a small bandgap semiconductor on CdS/ZnO to form a dual heterojunction photoanode has further improved the overall PEC performance. For instance, deposition of PdS (bandgap of 1.8 eV) or Cu2O (bandgap of 2.2 eV) have both displayed favorable band alignment for accelerated electron transfer through the ZnO nanorods to the substrate and hole transfer to the surface for photooxidation reaction, as illustrated in Fig. 15e and f, respectively.168,169

Integration of ZnS with ZnO to form a heterostructure has been another popular photoanode design due to the ability for direct sulfurization of ZnO into ZnS. Direct conversion of ZnO into ZnS (in the presence of a sulfur source, such as thioacetamide or sodium sulfide, Na2S) ensures optimum interfacial contact between the ZnO and ZnS, therefore beneficial for charge separation. The ZnS/ZnO structure has been widely employed as a photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells,172,173 in which the ZnS layer served as the tunnelling layer that allows electrons to transfer from the electrolyte to ZnS and then to the ZnO core structure. For PEC study, Kushuwaha and Aslam have grown ZnS on ZnO nanowires by simply dipping the ZnO photoanode in Na2S solution.174 It was demonstrated that the degree of sulfurization varies with different temperatures. A thicker ZnS layer was obtained at 70 °C when compared to room temperature sulfurization due to the higher rate of ion exchange between O and S, as illustrated in Fig. 16a–f. This leads to a photocurrent density of 0.44 mA cm−2 upon visible light illumination for ZnS/ZnO synthesized at 70 °C, higher than that of both the bare ZnO and ZnS/ZnO synthesized at room temperature. It is postulated that intimate contact between the ZnS and ZnO enables the interface to have a new “redesigned bandgap” (Fig. 16g) for visible light excitation, but it is rather ambiguous on how bare ZnO with a bandgap of 3.32 eV was excited by visible light to achieve a photocurrent density of 0.28 mA cm−2.

To further improve the rate of surface reaction for the ZnS/ZnO photoanode, 3D hierarchical ZnO/ZnS heterojunction branched nanowires were synthesized via metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as shown in Fig. 17a.175 The enhanced photocurrent density (from 0.7 to 2.2 mA cm−2) and photoconversion efficiency (from 0.22% to 0.46%) achieved by the 3D hierarchical ZnO/ZnS when compared to the conventional main trunk ZnS/ZnO photoanode are attributed to the higher surface area of the branched nanowire morphology (Fig. 17b and c). In contrast the formation of type-II band alignment between ZnS and ZnO also reduces the carrier recombination and enables rapid charge separation. Liu and co-workers have further coated an overlayer of Au on the ZnO/ZnS photoanode for PEC water splitting.176 The photoconversion efficiency of the PEC system reached 0.21%, which was 2 times and 3.5 times that of ZnO/Au and pristine ZnO photoanodes, respectively. Moreover, the photocurrent density was also improved from 0.18 mA cm−2 and 0.37 mA cm−2 for pristine ZnO and ZnO/Au photoanode to 0.58 mA cm−2 for ZnO/ZnS/Au at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The passivation of the Au layer induced surface-plasmon resonance, while introduction of the ZnS interlayer favored the injection of photoexcited electrons into ZnO, which consequently reduced the recombination at the photoanode–electrolyte interface.

4.1.3 Formation of sulfide–nitride heterostructures. 
Integration of binary sulfides with nitride-based semiconductors, primarily carbon nitride (C3N4), is another potential route due to the stability, earth abundancy and non-toxicity of C3N4. C3N4 is a metal-free visible light responsive material that possesses n-type properties and a bandgap of 2.7 eV.177 However, the photoactivity of C3N4 is generally lower than that of the well-established metal sulfide, CdS. Hence, incorporation of CdS on C3N4 mitigated both the issues of CdS (photocorrosion) and C3N4 (low photoactivity). Wang et al. demonstrated that the intimate contact between CdS and graphitic C3N4 accelerated the separation and transfer of photoinduced charges (as illustrated in the photoluminescence spectra, Fig. 18a), which suppressed CdS photocorrosion.178 Upon prolonged irradiation, the C3N4/CdS photoanode exhibited improved photocurrent density and stability, with only 7.2% decrement in its photocurrent density for 9 h measurement (Fig. 18b). Apart from CdS, SnS2 was recently sandwiched between the rGO underlayer and mesoporous graphitic C3N4 (mpg-C3N4) overlayer, forming a promising photoanode for PEC water splitting (Fig. 18c).179 During the illumination, the photoexcited electrons were transferred to the conduction band of SnS2 through the heterojunction and subsequently proceeded to rGO. Meanwhile the photogenerated holes travelled in an opposite direction to mpg-C3N4, preventing carrier charge recombination (Fig. 18d). An increase in the photocurrent density was observed for the mpg-C3N4/SnS2/rGO photoanode (∼1.45 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which was 23 times higher than that of pristine SnS2 and 5 times higher than that of the binary composite of SnS2 and mpg-C3N4 (Fig. 18e). The similar photocurrent onset potential observed for all the SnS2-based photoanodes (Fig. 18f) also indicates that the enhanced PEC performance of C3N4/SnS2/rGO is mainly attributed to the efficient charge separation but not the change of surface structure or composition. Apart from g-C3N4, gallium nitride (GaN) has been coupled with sulfide metal (i.e. ZnS) for PEC water splitting. GaN is considered as a good photoanode materials owing to its controllable bandgap and good light absorption capability.180 The introduction of ZnS on the gallium nitride (GaN) photoanode has improved the performance of the GaN photoanode in PEC water splitting.181 The GaN photoanode coated with 1.5 nm thick ZnS showed a significantly improved photocurrent density (1.75 times higher at zero bias) and stability (upon 6 h of continuous illumination) when compared to the bare GaN photoanode.

4.2 Ternary sulfide photoanodes
While binary sulfide photoanodes have shown promising photooxidation activity, the inherent drawbacks have prompted researchers to explore further. Integration of a secondary element to form ternary sulfide materials is one of the key techniques that improve the overall PEC efficacy. Moreover, ternary sulfide materials often have an adjustable bandgap and tailorable chemical structures that benefitted the photoinduced electron–hole separation rate and reaction kinetics. As such, cadmium zinc sulfide (CdxZn1−xS) and cadmium indium sulfide (CdxIn1−xS) are two commonly employed ternary sulfide materials derived from CdS for PEC oxidation reaction. More recently, attention is diverted to the zinc indium sulfide photoanode due to its outstanding stability and non-toxicity.

4.2.1 Cadmium zinc sulfide. 
Cadmium zinc sulfide (CdxZn1−xS) is a solid solution that has been widely used in suspended photocatalytic systems owing to its controllable bandgap, promising photoactivity and photostability when compared to its binary counterparts (i.e. CdS and ZnS). One of the earliest studies by Xing and co-workers has demonstrated the tunability of the band structure for a series of CdxZn1−xS materials with the composition ranging from x = 0–0.92. These CdxZn1−xS photocatalysts were fabricated via the coprecipitation method in the presence of different ratios of Cd:Zn precursors.182 It was reported that the bandgap was blue shifted and the positions of conduction and valence bands were negatively and positively shifted, respectively, with the increasing amount of zinc (Fig. 19a). Similarly, Li et al. have fabricated hexagonal wurtzite CdxZn1−xS photoanodes with various compositions that possessed the band gaps between 2.45 and 3.72 eV.183 In this study, CdxZn1−xS was spray-coated onto an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate using the spray pyrolysis method, attaining a grain size of 40–200 nm and a thickness of 230 nm (Fig. 19b). Although the overall PEC performance of CdxZn1−xS was comparable to that of CdS (Fig. 19c), the flat band potential of CdxZn1−xS photoanodes was negatively shifted with increasing ratio of Zn to Cd (Fig. 19d), indicating the changes in conduction and valence band edges of the materials.

Given the superior electrical conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), it has been commonly incorporated into CdxZn1−xS photoanodes to improve the overall charge transfer efficiency. By anchoring Cd0.6Zn0.4S nanorods on rGO nanosheets, an anodic photocurrent density of 0.3 mA cm−2 was attained at 0.55 V vs. RHE, approximately four times higher than that of the Cd0.6Zn0.4S photoanode (Fig. 20a).184 The improvement is associated with the intimate interfacial contact of CdxZn1−xS with 2D rGO sheets, which reduced the charge transfer resistance within the film, as illustrated by the significantly smaller arc diameter in Fig. 20b. In the presence of an rGO layer, the photoexcited electrons in CdxZn1−xS were rapidly transferred from its conduction band to the rGO conducting layer and then to the external circuit (Fig. 20c), improving the charge separation efficiency. Loading and doping of transition metals (i.e. Ni, Mo and Cu) on the rGO/CdxZn1−xS photoanode have also been performed to improve the PEC performance.185 While the overall results indicate that photodeposition of Mo or Cu on the rGO/CdxZn1−xS photoanode synthesized through the solvothermal process was detrimental, the loading of Ni has improved the photocurrent density by three times when compared to the bare rGO/CdxZn1−xS photoanode, exhibiting up to ∼7.00 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 0.42 V vs. RHE. Apart from rGO, a very recent study by Patil et al. has reported the integration of CdxZn1−xS porous nanosheets with ZnO nanorods.186 The dual nanostructured thin films were used as the photoanode (working electrode) in a three-electrode PEC system, where hydrogen will be evolved at the Pt counter electrode (Fig. 20d and e). By tuning the synthesis condition, the optimized ZnO/CdxZn1−xS photoanode was obtained, exhibiting 6.60 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under standard 1 sun irradiation.

Although CdxZn1−xS was shown to be a promising photoanode, investigation on its improvement strategies is still limited. Although there is still room for exploration of CdxZn1−xS (e.g., coupling with another semiconductor to create a composite with a heterojunction, surface defect engineering, and so on), the future utilization of the CdxZn1−xS photoanode on the industrial scale might be constrained owing to the toxicity of Cd which is being a major drawback for CdS and other Cd-based photoanodes. Some researchers have replaced Cd with another environmentally benign material such as indium, which shows excellent response under visible light illumination.


4.2.2 Cadmium indium sulfide. 
Cadmium indium sulfide (CdIn2S4) is an n-type metal sulfide semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.1 to 2.7 eV. CdIn2S4 has long been discovered as a photosensitive material and was subsequently developed into promising materials for various light induced applications, such as solar cells, optical sensing, photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.187–190 As a visible light active photocatalyst, CdIn2S4 has received much less attention than the well-established metal sulfide photocatalyst, CdS. Nevertheless, this ternary chalcogenide material that is categorized as the AB2X4 family possesses good light absorption, an appropriate band structure for water splitting, good stability and high catalytic activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that the CdIn2S4 photocatalyst performed better than CdS during photocatalytic oxidation of methylene blue and aromatic alcohols.191,192 As such, the passivation of CdIn2S4 on the CdS photoanode for PEC water splitting was demonstrated to improve the rate of water oxidation as well as the overall stability of the system.193 The CdIn2S4 surface layer was obtained via cation exchange of CdS nanoflakes (CdS NFAs) in the presence of InCl3 precursor at 500 °C (Fig. 21a). The enhanced photocurrent achieved by the CdS@CdIn2S4 photoanode when compared to the bare CdS photoanode was attributed to the formation of a type II heterojunction, which improved the charge separation efficiency and hole injection rate (Fig. 21b and c).

Surface tunability of CdIn2S4 is another attractive property that leads to its exploration as a photoanode material. Wang et al. have successfully fabricated CdIn2S4 nanocrystals with surface sulfur vacancies by annealing them in an Ar/H2 environment at 500 °C (Fig. 22a).138 The sulfur deficient CdIn2S4 photoanode has shown a high photocurrent density of 5.73 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 1 sun illumination (Fig. 22b). Detailed optical characterization of the sulfur deficient photoanode suggested the enhanced charge separation and injection efficiencies owing to the presence of sulfur defects. In addition, theoretical calculations of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) free energies on modelled CdIn2S4 and sulfur deficient CdIn2S4 surfaces further proved that the surface sulfur defects not only play an important role in the interfacial charge separation and transfer kinetics, the accumulation of charges at the surrounding atoms (i.e. Cd and In) can also serve as the active sites for the OER. With the improved rate of the OER (commonly known as the limiting reaction), a higher amount of hydrogen gas was also achieved at the cathode when sulfur deficient CdIn2S4 was employed as the photoanode (Fig. 22c).

Although CdIn2S4 can be used as a standalone photoanode,194 it is preferentially integrated with another photocatalyst to form a heterojunction, to attain better charge separation efficiency. Deposition of CdIn2S4 on TiO2 has been reported by a few past studies. For instance, Dhandole et al. have successfully fabricated a three-dimensional CdIn2S4/TiO2 photoanode via a two-step hydrothermal method.195 CdIn2S4 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed on the TiO2 nanorods grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, as illustrated in Fig. 23a and b. The resulting CdIn2S4/TiO2 photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 3.88 mA cm−2, which was more than three times higher than that of the bare counterpart (1.1 mA cm−2 at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl). A separate study further demonstrated that the presence of an inorganic–organic hybrid composite (i.e. CdSe-ethylenediamine, CdSe(en)0.5) on the CdIn2S4/TiO2 photoanode further enhanced the photoanode activity.196 The enhanced PEC performance was attributed to the hole scavenging ability of CdSe(en)0.5, facilitating hole transfer from TiO2 to CdIn2S4 and then to the surface CdSe(en)0.5 complex. Very recently, CdIn2S4 was sandwiched between the TiO2 underlayer and NiO overlayer via facile magnetron ion-sputtering, forming an efficient TiO2/CdIn2S4/NiO photoanode for PEC water splitting.197 Higher photocurrent was achieved in the presence of both TiO2 and NiO layers when compared to the bare CdIn2S4 or CdIn2S4 photoanode with only the TiO2 or NiO layer (Fig. 23c). The TiO2/CdIn2S4/NiO also possessed the lowest impedance value as displayed by the smaller arc radius in Fig. 23d. This study revealed that the TiO2 underlayer was responsible for transporting photogenerated electrons from CdIn2S4 through the FTO substrate to the external circuit, while NiO served as the oxidation co-catalyst, which induced built-in potential gradient between the CdIn2S4/NiO interface and further improved the overall charge transfer efficiency (Fig. 23e and f).

Apart from TiO2, CdIn2S4 was deposited on a WO3 photoanode to improve the light absorption ability and charge separation efficiency during PEC water splitting reaction.198 In addition, it has also been integrated with In2S3 to form a photoanode heterostructure, which was further passivated with a thin amorphous layer of SnO2.199 While the CdIn2S4/In2S3 photoanode displayed a photocurrent density of 1.89 mA cm−2 (more than 6 times higher than that of bare CdIn2S4), the photocurrent exhibited by the CdIn2S4/In2S3/SnO2 thin film was approximately 10 times higher, reaching 2.98 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. These studies demonstrated the beneficial roles of heterojunction formation of CdIn2S4 with secondary materials. While surface defects are shown to be beneficial,138 high quality CdIn2S4 is required to prevent the formation of bulk or interfacial defects that commonly serve as the charge recombination sites. In addition, it has been shown in photocatalysis research that the photoactivity of CdIn2S4 is shape dependent, whereby the morphology of CdIn2S4 can be tuned (e.g. spheres, nanotubes, nanopyramids, nanosheets and marigold structure) by varying the synthesis methods and conditions.190,191,200,201 Despite all the above-mentioned benefits and its early discovery, the number of studies on CdIn2S4 photoanodes is still limited, mainly related to the poor intrinsic charge transfer properties of the low quality CdIn2S4 film (e.g. the Hall coefficient and resistivity vary significantly depending on the quality of the film), the complexity of the synthesis method in attaining high quality CdIn2S4 films and the higher cost of indium when compared to cadmium, zinc or copper.202


4.2.3 Zinc indium sulfide. 
Zinc indium sulfide is a relatively new photocatalyst with the most common stoichiometry of ZnIn2S4, a AB2S4 ternary chalcogenide layered structure. ZnIn2S4 is present in three different crystal polymorphs, including cubic, hexagonal and rhombohedral phases, with all three phases being photocatalytically active under visible light.203 ZnIn2S4 has a tunable band gap of 2.06–2.85 eV, depending on the size and shape. It possesses great prospects in various photo-related applications, such as photocatalytic and PEC hydrogen generation, CO2 reduction and PEC sensing, due to its favorable optical properties and good stability. When compared to CdS, CdxZn(1−x)S and Cd2In4S discussed above, ZnIn2S4 has the additional benefit of being environmentally benign, without the presence of toxic Cd component.
Li et al. have first developed a spray pyrolysis method to fabricate a ZnIn2S4 photoanode that achieved almost 0.8 mA cm−2 photocurrent density upon 1.0 V vs. SCE applied potential.204 Chemical bath deposition, hydrothermal and spin coating methods were subsequently developed to fabricate ZnIn2S4 thin films for PEC applications.205–207 Among these, the hydrothermal method is the most used method due to its simplicity and flexibility to tune the thin film properties by varying the synthesis condition. A homojunction between ZnIn2S4 hexagonal and cubic phases was grown on FTO via a two step-hydrothermal synthesis using different sulfur sources.208 The surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements indicated that the n–n homojunction ZnIn2S4 photoanode exhibited higher SPV response intensity than both mono-phases, indicating an efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charges across the junction. This resulted in higher photocurrent density of the homojunction ZnIn2S4 photoanode (0.53 mA cm−2) when compared to hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (0.39 mA cm−2) and cubic ZnIn2S4 (0.28 mA cm−2). Likewise, a hybrid 0D/2D ZnIn2S4 photoanode (with nanoparticles and nanoflakes) was also shown to exhibit higher photocurrent density because of the improved light absorption and charge transfer efficiency.209 Moreover, deposition of Co–Pi and Pt nanoparticles at the top and bottom of the 0D/2D ZnIn2S4 photoanode further enhanced the PEC performance.
Chemical doping of the ZnIn2S4 photoanode is another approach that has been explored to enhance the overall PEC performance. Upon Cu doping, the Cu–ZnIn2S4 photoanode exhibited 1.15 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M K2SO4 solutions, two times higher than that of the undoped ZnIn2S4 photoanode (0.47 mA cm−2).210 Careful investigations have shown that Cu doping resulted in the reduction of bandgap, thus improving the light absorption ability and photocurrent density. An atomic ratio of 0.08 for [Cu]/[Cu + Zn] was determined as the optimum dopant concentration. A further increase of the Cu dopant concentration led to a decrease in photocurrent density, potentially due to the decrease in crystallinity and distortion of the layered structure of ZnIn2S4. Similarly, the Ni-doped ZnIn2S4 photoanode has shown augmented PEC performance in comparison to the undoped ZnIn2S4 photoanode.211 The 2 wt% Ni-doped ZnIn2S4 photoanode exhibited 0.24 mA cm−2 photocurrent density at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight illumination, which is not only higher but more stable than that of the undoped ZnIn2S4, as illustrated in Fig. 24a. Based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 24b), this study also demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance of the 2 wt% Ni-doped ZnIn2S4 photoanode (110.3 Ω) was significantly lower than that of the undoped photoanode (216.2 Ω).

ZnIn2S4 has also been deposited on the CdS photoanode for PEC dopamine detection. The formation of a heterojunction between ZnIn2S4 and CdS increased the overall photocurrent density of the photoanode, thereby advancing the sensitivity of dopamine detection (from 0.3 to 300 μM).213 Heterojunction formation of ZnIn2S4 and TiO2 has also been broadly studied.214–216 In general, the presence of ZnIn2S4 on TiO2 improved the light harvesting ability of TiO2 and at the same time increased the overall charge separation efficiency. Deposition of ZnIn2S4 on the ZnO photoanode has also been demonstrated.212,217 Given the ease of synthesizing ZnO with various morphologies (in particular, when compared to TiO2), Han et al. designed ZnIn2S4 deposited on a ZnO nanotube array as a photoanode for PEC applications (Fig. 24c).212 Although several experiments such as metal doping, junction construction and surface modification have been extensively investigated, there is room for improvement for the ZnIn2S4 photoanode. It has been widely reported that metal doping narrowed the bandgap and increased the charge carrier mobility for ZnIn2S4.218 However, the excessive and unsuitable dopants will act as the charge recombination sites.219 Moreover, the usage of a sacrificial agent as a hole scavenger is still being the major drawback for ZnIn2S4 as it makes the overall PEC reactions become costly and economically unfeasible for large-scale production. Therefore, a thorough and systematic research is needed to improve the ZnIn2S4 photoanode for PEC application.


4.2.4 Other ternary sulfide. 
A number of other ternary sulfides, such as Ag8SnS6,220–222 CuSbS2,223,224 CuInS2 (ref. 227) and Cu2SnS3,226,227 have also been employed as photoanodes for PEC applications. Apart from Ag8SnS6 that is an n-type semiconductor,228 other ternary sulfide materials mostly exhibited p-type conductivity and were first discovered as photoabsorbers for photovoltaic applications.229–231 Inspired by their development as solar cell thin films, researchers also explored their capability as photoanodes in PEC applications. Orthorhombic Ag8SnS6 has been fabricated as the photoanode for PEC water splitting, achieving a photocurrent density of 2.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.232 In general, other p-type ternary sulfide materials were deposited or passivated on other photoanode materials to form heterostructures for enhanced charge transfer and stability. For instance, CuSbS2 quantum dots were deposited on the graphene coated TiO2 nanorod photoanode for enhanced PEC performance (photocurrent density increased by more than 5 times when compared to the photoanode without CuSbS2).223 Xu et al. also deposited CuInS2 and Cu2SnS3 on ZnO nanorod arrays, exhibiting a photocurrent density up to 5.98 mA cm−2 and 4.85 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. NHE, respectively (only 0.46 mA cm−2 was observed for bare ZnO nanorod arrays).227

4.3 Photoanode's outlook

Table 2 summarizes the PEC performance of all the sulfide photoanodes discussed in this review paper. As the simplest form of metal sulfide, binary sulfides have been extensively investigated (filled up more than half of Table 2) as a photoanode for a variety of PEC applications. Every binary sulfide photoanode has its own distinctive advantages and inherent drawbacks. CdS is the most used photoanode among other binary sulfides owing to its high photoactivity upon visible light illumination. However, the self-photooxidation and toxicity issues are yet to be utterly mitigated. In2S3 possesses reasonable photoactivity, but high cost of indium and photocorrosion issue impede its use for practical applications. On the other hand, MoS2 is favored due to its controllable properties, but it suffers from high photoinduced charge recombination rate. Unlike other binary sulfide materials, ZnS, which can only be activated with UV light, is known to have superior stability during PEC measurements. To date, numerous studies were conducted to improve the photoactivity and suppress the photocorrosion of binary sulfide photoanodes. The ultimate goal is to design photoanodes with rapid charge transfer and surface hole consumption to boost the photoresponse and photostability.

As discussed above, proper designs of heterojunctions by integrating binary sulfides with another sulfide, oxide or even nitride material are critical to improve the onset potential, overall charge separation and transfer efficiencies. Band structures and band alignments of different heterojunction formations are important aspects to be considered during photoanode designs. Proper band alignment of heterostructures often leads to enhanced photoactivity attributed to the better charge separation and potentially negatively shifted onset potential. In addition, deposition of a co-catalyst is known to further improve the charge consumption rate on the surface of the photoanode. Given that surface properties determine the reaction pathway, surface defect engineering is another potential strategy that can be used to improve the photoactivity. Similar to the beneficial role of oxygen vacancies in metal oxide photocatalysts,233,234 the presence of surface sulfur defects that act as the surface-active sites was demonstrated to facilitate surface charge consumption during photocatalytic applications.235,236 While there are fewer studies on photoanode surface defect-engineering for PEC applications, the knowledge attained from photocatalytic studies should be employed to aid photoanode designs.
Apart from the above-mentioned strategies, constructing a ternary sulfide photoanode was shown to be a promising approach to design an efficient sulfide based photoanode owing to its controllable bandgap, tailorable chemical and crystal structures. CdxZn1−xS, CdIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4 are some common ternary sulfides used as photoanodes. Given that most ternary sulfide photoanodes have not been thoroughly explored, there exist tremendous possibilities in designing a highly active ternary sulfide photoanode with multi-junction formation. Whilst Cd, Zn, In and Cu are the most studied elements, other elements (e.g. Ag, Sn, Sb, Bi or Pb) can also be further investigated. Unlike photocathodes, investigation of quaternary sulfide photoanodes is very limited (CuZnInS3 is the only quaternary sulfide that has been recently reported as a photoanode).237 Nevertheless, there are a few studies that demonstrated the use of doped-ternary sulfide photoanodes (e.g. Cu-doped ZnIn2S4 and Cu-doped AgInS2),210,238 which indicates that the design of quaternary sulfide photoanodes is possible. Likewise, transfer of knowledge from photovoltaic cell design for optimum light absorption and charge transfer capabilities is essential to accelerate the discovery of highly active photoanodes.
5. Key consideration for sulfide photoelectrodes
Over the past decades, metal sulfides have been extensively investigated as both photocathodes and photoanodes for various PEC applications. To achieve efficient solar conversion, it is of great importance to select and design metal sulfide photoelectrodes to possess optimum charge transfer kinetics (with minimal charge recombination and high rate of charge consumption) within the photoelectrode and on its surface. Based on our own understanding and knowledge from the available literature, we have summarized the key aspects that need to be taken into consideration when designing metal sulfide photocathodes and photoanodes, as illustrated in Fig. 25. While other review papers have emphasized the common requirements of both photoelectrodes, one needs to take into account the distinctive requirements when constructing a photocathode or photoanode.
 Fig. 25  Similarites and differences in designing photoanodes and photocathodes. 
Apart from the general requirements, specific considerations that are highly dependent on the surface reactions (either reduction or oxidation) that need to be assessed during photocathode or photoanode design, as illustrated in Fig. 26. Firstly, the semiconducting type of metal sulfides is one of the most essential considerations. p-type semiconductors should be applied as the photocathode for reduction reactions, whereas n-type semiconductors are used as photoanodes for oxidation reactions (this statement has been repeatedly emphasized throughout the review paper). This is because the intrinsic electronic properties of a p-type or n-type semiconductor will induce “upward” or “downward” band bending across the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, respectively, thereby promoting the charge transfer towards a desired direction (electrons flow from the photoanode to the photocathode), as illustrated in Fig. 2.7 In addition to that, p-type or n-type metal sulfides were also introduced as the surface modification layer for photoanodes or photocathodes, respectively, to form p–n junctions for improved charge transfer kinetics. Notably, most metal sulfides have tunable semiconducting properties, which are dominantly dependent on the crystal structure, type of dopants and/or defect states. Moreover, different synthesis methods of the same materials could result in sulfide materials with different semiconducting types; hence, proper control of the crystal formation to achieve desired semiconducting properties during photoelectrode fabrication is crucial.
 Fig. 26  The three distinctive requirements when designing photoanodes and photocathodes. 
As discussed above, formation of a heterojunction is the key strategy employed to improve the overall PEC performance of photoelectrodes. Therefore, the second consideration falls upon the band alignment of single or multi-junction photoelectrodes. The band structure of each component in the heterostructure composite should be well-aligned to facilitate the charge migration across the interfaces towards the desired direction. Upon illumination, photogenerated electrons migrate towards the photocathode surface for reduction reaction. In contrast, photogenerated electrons within the photoanode will transfer to the conducting substrate through the external circuit to the cathode, leaving holes on the photoanode for surface oxidation reactions. Inappropriate band alignment will induce high interfacial resistance, therefore creating a barrier for charges to transfer across the heterojunction. More importantly, optimum band alignment can result in improved charge transfer capability and photostability (when charges are effectively migrated to another more stable component). For instance, when metal sulfide materials (e.g. CZTS and CIGS) were used as the photoabsorber in the photocathode, the passivation layer (e.g. CdS) often has a conduction band potential similar to or lower than that of the main photoabsorber, to facilitate electron transfer to the photocathode surface. Formation of a heterostructure between the CdS photoanode and MoS2, CdxZn1−xS or CdIn2S4 surface layer has again constructed a favorable band alignment (with CdS having a more positive valence band) for photoinduced holes to transfer to the surface for oxidation reactions. Therefore, different band alignments and charge transfer considerations are necessary to fabricate high performing photocathodes and photoanodes.
Thirdly, the band positions of the metal sulfide should be considered based on the type of applications, in particular when the metal sulfide is coated as the outer layer and is responsible for surface reaction. As such, metal sulfide photocathodes need to have a conduction band potential that is more negative than the redox potential of the desired reduction reaction. Similarly, the valence band potential of the metal sulfide photoanode must be more positive than the potential of the oxidation reactions. For photocathode design, different conduction band potentials are required for water (0 V vs. RHE), CO2 or nitrate (a wide range of electrochemical potentials depend on the reaction pathways that involve multielectron transfer) reduction reactions.239,240 More importantly, the less energetic water reduction reaction is often a competing reaction during CO2 or nitrate reduction reactions. On the other hand, water and organic oxidations are the most common reactions occurring at the surface of the photoanode. It is generally known that a more energetic valence band leads to higher rate of oxidation reaction. Nonetheless, recent effort has been diverted to tuning the selectivity of organic oxidation, which can prevent the generation of CO2 from complete oxidation and facilitate the production of valuable organics (metal sulfide is often a suitable candidate due to its shallow valence band position when compared to metal oxide).12,136 However, this brings in more challenges, whereby selection of metal sulfide photoanodes with an optimum valence band position is essential to suppress the generation of highly oxidizing radical species (i.e. hydroxyl radicals) and at the same time maintain a high oxidation rate.
Apart from the metal sulfides that have been reviewed above (for PEC applications), there exist some potential metal sulfides, such as Bi2S3, Co9S8 and Ni2S, that have been commonly used in energy storage, sensing or electrocatalysis applications. Favorable electrical properties of these metal sulfides indicate that they are worth exploring for PEC applications if a proper strategy can be applied to attain excellent light harvesting ability, appropriate semiconductor type, efficient charge separation and promising surface catalytic activity. Apart from employing them solely as the photoelectrodes, deposition of these metal sulfides as co-catalysts of the existing photoelectrodes could also be beneficial. As such, one of the biggest challenges is the development of modern fabrication techniques to enable the synthesis of metal sulfide materials with desirable properties and/or excellent interfacial contact.
In general, an active photoelectrode needs to possess (i) good photoabsorption for optimum charge excitation/generation, (ii) efficient charge transfer with low charge recombination and (iii) high durability (physical and chemical stability) to ensure viable operation of the photoelectrode. While good light absorption ability and efficient charge transfer have been achieved, the chemical stability of metal sulfides is still a severe issue that needs to be addressed. It is known that metal sulfides are generally more susceptible to photocorrosion when compared to other metal oxide (except for Cu2O) or nitride photocatalysts, in particularly when they are used as photoanodes, which causes self-oxidation. Therefore, additional considerations are required when designing metal sulfide photoelectrodes and PEC systems. Surface passivation has been one of the strategies used to prevent the dissolution of sulfur into the electrolyte during PEC measurements. In addition, the use of sulfide containing redox mediators (i.e. Na2S and Na2SO3) has been demonstrated to effectively suppress the chemical dissolution of metal sulfides under illumination.241
Lastly, one of the most important considerations for metal sulfide photoelectrode design is the safety consideration (which is widely known but was not emphasized). It is important for the experimentalist to be aware of the potential hazards involved during the synthesis of metal sulfide materials (in particular, researchers that are new to the field). For instance, careful handling of the Cd-based sulfide materials needs to be highlighted due to the toxicity of Cd that is known as a human carcinogen.242 Moreover, fabrication of metal sulfides often involves the use of highly toxic H2S for sulfurization,243 in which proper controls (e.g. installation of appropriate ventilation, process enclosure to prevent its release, etc.) are essential during the process to minimize the human exposure. Negligence of these aspects could be life-threatening, particularly after prolonged exposure. Alternatively, these safety concerns could be greatly reduced by avoiding the use of highly hazardous materials. As such, less hazardous metals (e.g. Zn, Cu or Mo) can be used to substitute Cd and other milder sulfur sources (e.g. Na2S or Na2S2O3) can be used to replace H2S during the synthesis of metal sulfides.
6. Outlook and perspectives
Metal sulfides have great potential to be constructed as photocathode or photoanode materials for PEC applications. This review discussed the role of metal sulfides as photocathodes or photoanodes for various PEC applications. Apart from simple binary sulfide materials, ternary and quaternary sulfides possess huge potential due to their tunable physical and chemical properties. More importantly, we reviewed similar and different key considerations for photocathode and photoanode designs based on our perspectives, which provided future insight into the design of metal sulfide photoelectrodes. Similar to other photocatalysts, a high quality sulfide photoelectrode should have (i) superior charge generation, (ii) efficient charge transfer and (iii) rapid charge consumption. By summarizing the key design criteria of metal sulfide photoelectrodes, the first criterion was achieved by having an appropriate band gap and good light absorption ability, which is one of the key advantages of employing visible-light active metal sulfide photoelectrodes. To achieve high charge transfer rate (the second criterion), distinct considerations are required when designing photocathodes and photoanodes. The selection of sulfide photocatalysts with desired semiconducting types (p-type for photocathodes and n-type for photoanodes) and proper design of band alignment (facilitating electron transfer to the surface of the photocathode and hole transfer to the surface of the photoanode) could greatly improve the overall PEC performance. Thirdly, the charge consumption rate is highly dependent on the type of reduction or oxidation reaction. The photocathode's conduction band position (for surface reduction reaction), photoanode's valence band position (for surface oxidation reaction), surface active sites and reactant adsorption ability are some determining factors that enable successful surface reduction and oxidation reactions.
The durability (high physical and chemical stability) of the sulfide photoelectrodes is also another criterion that needs to be taken into consideration to ensure feasible design of future PEC systems. In terms of physical stability, detachment of the thin film from the substrate (peeling off phenomenon) must be mitigated by improving the interfacial contact between the substrate and the photoactive materials (and between two photoactive materials). Likewise, the poor chemical stability of sulfide materials (sulfur leaching via oxidation), particularly when they are used as the photoanode, also needs to be addressed. To further mitigate the photocorrosion issue of sulfide photoanodes, realization of selective organic oxidation at the photoanode is one key strategy. The presence of an organic reactant at the photoanode compartment does not only promote the oxidation performance (water oxidation is known to be the limiting reaction) but it could potentially improve the overall photostability of sulfide photoanodes by rapidly scavenging photogenerated holes from the photoanode surface to prevent self-oxidation.
Finally, based on Tables 1 and 2, we note that the photocurrent density achieved from the half-cell metal sulfide photocathode is generally higher than that of the photoanode. In our opinion, this is because studies of sulfide photocathodes often used multi-junction photocathode designs that were adopted from solar cell designs with record high efficiency in the field of photovoltaics (for instance a CZTS-based photocathode has achieved a photocurrent up to −28 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE).39 In these studies, the charge generation and charge transfer efficiency (the first two steps of photocatalysis) have been optimized; therefore, efforts can be devoted to optimizing the surface properties for rapid charge consumption. The idea of p–n junction formation in solar cells by passivating an n-type semiconducting layer on a p-type photocathode to enhance the overall charge transfer rate should also be implemented in the photoanode design (p-type materials passivated on n-type photoanodes). The concept of n–p junction formation and band alignment for photoanodes should be further investigated to facilitate the discovery of high-performing multi-junction photoanodes.
With the ultimate goal of achieving bias-free solar-to-chemical energy conversion, it is important to note that most of the present photoelectrodes still possess limited photovoltages to drive the full reaction in the two-electrode configuration without additional external bias. Though decent development has been made in the unbiased PEC system to date, the overall efficiency is still far from real industrialization. For example, the highest overall solar to hydrogen efficiency of metal sulfide-based photocathodes is around 4%, which still possesses huge room for further improvement, while the synergistic improvement of both photocathodes and photoanodes is required. Therefore, future attempts can also be made on integrating multijunction photoelectrodes to realize an increased photovoltage for constructing photovoltaic-PEC tandem cells.
