    , Accepted 13th April 2012First published on 18th April 2012AbstractMesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals (denoted as TiO2-MS) have been synthesised by a one-step amino acid assisted synthesis method using L-lysine as a catalyst. An ∼18% enhancement in dye-sensitized solar cells’ (DSSCs) conversion efficiency was achieved using the TiO2-MS as photoanodes compared to that of benchmark Degussa P25 TiO2. The improved dye loading capacity and reduced charge recombination of TiO2-MS are responsible for the enhanced performance.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a promising 3rd generation solar cell option have show great potential for converting solar energy into electricity power due to their low cost and facile fabrication.1–3 Among various semiconductor material candidates, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been so far the best photoanode material for DSSCs since the pioneering work of Gratzel in 1991.1 The performance of TiO2 photoanodes strongly depends on the morphology, porosity, and crystalline phase of the materials. Various morphologies of TiO2 nanostructures, such as single crystals,4 one-dimensional nanotubes/wires,5,6 ordered mesoporous thin films,7and TiO2 monoliths8 have been synthesized. Currently, the benchmark Degussa titania P25 nanoparticles are prepared by flame spray pyrolysis, which leads to a mixture containing anatase and rutile phases in a ratio of ca. 3:1 (average sizes of ca. 25 nm for anatase and 85 nm for rutile, respectively), and a surface area of ca. 50 m2 g−1.9 On the other hand, higher surface-area nanocrystalline TiO2 with a nanoporous structure would be more beneficial for dye loading and the improvement of DSSCs’ performance.
In the past decades, considerable effort has been focused on the morphology and porosity control of transition metal oxides.10–15 Various soft and hard templates, such as surfactants,16 carbon nanospheres17 and silica beads18 have been used to direct the assembly of metal oxide meso-structures. However, a significant decrease in surface area is usually accompanied by rapid crystallite growth when converting amorphous meso-structures into the desired crystalline phase in conventional thermal treatment. On the other hand, the removal of hard templates requires either solvent extraction or high-temperature calcination, which precludes industrial application due to the high cost. Recently, bio-inspired synthesis through the interaction between nanoparticles and organic molecules has attracted increasing attention due to the advantage of biomolecules in directing and assembling different structures,19–23 which is eco-friendly and inexpensive. However, there are very few reports on the synthesis of porous TiO2 nanocrystals by using a biomolecule-assisted approach.
Herein, we report a biomolecule-assisted sol–gel route to generate mesoporous TiO2 (TiO2-MS) with a narrow pore size distribution (5.7 nm) and small nanocrystal size (<10 nm), which is demonstrated to offer superior photovoltaic performance than the P25 in DSSCs. The rapid one-pot synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals was carried out at 60 °C, utilizing a mixture of L-lysine (20 mmol), Ti(OiBu)4 (1 mol), octane (1.28 mol) and ca. 156 mol of deionized water in a glass reactor. The details of the synthesis procedure are given in the ESI.† In this amino acid-assisted sol–gel pathway, the L-lysine was used both as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the titania precursor Ti(OiBu)4 and a NH3+ provider for the formation of mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals.
TEM images as shown in Fig. 1a revealed the average particle size of the TiO2 nanocrystals is ca. 8–9 nm, and they are closely packed to form a mesoporous structure because they have three-dimensional, inter-particle voids with high uniformity. This route for producing mesoporous materials has been designated as the “hard-sphere packing (HSP)” mechanism,24 which is different from the well-known surfactant-template route. The HRTEM image of a single TiO2 nanocrystalline (Fig. 1b) indicates clear and coherent lattice fringes running through the whole nanocrystals. The HRTEM image of two nanocrystals indicates a lattice spacing of 3.52 Å and 2.90 Å, which can be indexed to the (101) planar spacing of anatase TiO2 and the (121) planar spacing of brookite TiO2, respectively. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S1†) of the TiO2-MS also exhibited a mixed crystalline phase of anatase (JCPDS 21-1272) and brookite (JCPDS 29-1360). The phase content of the TiO2-MS samples was estimated from the integrated intensities of the anatase (101) and brookite (121) peaks,25 with ca. 78% of the anatase phase and ca. 22% of the brookite phase in the TiO2-MS sample. The particle size of the anatase is estimated to be ∼9 nm based on the Scherrer's equation, which is in good agreement with the TEM results (Fig. 1). The mesoporous structure of the closely packed TiO2-MS was then investigated and further confirmed by nitrogen sorption measurements. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm for the TiO2-MS as shown in Fig. 1c exhibited a typical type-IV isotherm curve, featuring a H4 hysteresis loop in the range of 0.45–0.85 P/P0, which is generated by the capillary condensation in mesopores, indicating a well-connected mesoporous structure. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area for the TiO2-MS is as high as 162 m2 g−1, and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution derived from the desorption curve is very narrow (as shown in Fig. 1d). The pore volume and pore size of the samples are calculated as 0.30 cm3 g−1 and 5.7 nm, respectively. The inset of Fig. 1c presents an illustration scheme of the nanoparticle packing structure of TiO2-MS based on the information derived from the TEM images and nitrogen sorption.

To examine the performance of the TiO2-MS as working electrodes for DSSCs, photoanodes were fabricated with TiO2-MS and the details of the fabrication procedure are given in the ESI.† As listed in Table 1, the DSSCs assembled with the TiO2-MS exhibit a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.81 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.723 V, a fill factor (FF) of 64.1% and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 7.66%, whereas the DSSCs assembled with P25 show a Jsc of 14.39 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.704 V, a FF of 64.0% and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.49%. By using TiO2-MS photoelectrodes of similar thickness (ca. 10 μm), a ∼18% improvement in the overall conversion efficiency was achieved. Note that a commercialized mesoporous TiO2 product, Hombikat UV100, has also been used as a photoanode material in DSSCs.26,27 It was revealed that under the same testing conditions the photoanode assembled with Hombikat UV100 had a lower η than that of P25.27

The photovoltage–current characteristics of TiO2-MS and P25 are also shown in ESI (Fig. S2†), which demonstrates that the enhancement of the conversion efficiency of TiO2-MS compared to that of P25 is mainly attributed to the increase of Jsc. Therefore, the dye loading amount of both photoelectrodes was investigated and listed in Table 1. The amount of absorbed dye for the TiO2-MS is ca.10.68 × 10−8 mol cm−2, which was larger than the amount of dye adsorbed on the P25 photoelectrodes as a result of the larger surface area (Fig. 1a and c), which suggests that the mesoporous TiO2-MS network can be readily accessed by the dye molecules. For a certain amount of TiO2, the dye loading capacity of a film made of the TiO2-MS is greater than the P25 film, which would be mainly responsible for the 16.8% enhancement of Jsc.
To gain further insight into the functioning of the devices, the dark current potential scans and the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) technique were performed to examine the electron-transfer kinetics of the cells as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The dark current onset of the TiO2-MS shifted to a higher potential and produced a smaller dark current at the same potential above 0.5 V. The observation reflects a lower charge recombination between the transferred electrons and the I3− ions for the TiO2-MS photoanode, which is suggested to benefit from the mesoporous network and the uniform particle size of TiO2-MS (<10 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a) that offers better connectivity and conductivity than the randomly packed P25 nanoparticles (size range from 20–50 nm). For the OCVD scans, the decay of the Voc is a sign of electron loss as a result of charge recombination.14 As shown in Fig. 2b, the decay of Voc is slower for the DSSCs assembled with TiO2-MS, indicating that the charge recombination rate of such DSSCs is lower than the DSSCs assembled with P25, which is in good agreement with the results obtained from the dark current potential scans in Fig. 2a. There are many factors affecting the charge recombination rate in the cell. For instance, poor crystallinity will usually result in more defects in the cell and thus increases the recombination. On the other hand, a better particle network (Fig. 1a) will lead to better particle connectivity and conductivity. In our case, even though the crystallinity of the TiO2-MS is not very high, the mesoporous particle network forms an efficient electron pathway, thus leading to an overall reduced charge recombination rate. The function of the brookite in the MS-TiO2 is still not very clear at this stage, which might have some effect on the charge recombination rate in the cell, and this part of work is still undergoing.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs were shown in Fig. 3. The DSSCs made of TiO2-MS showed a significant increase in IPCE over the entire wavelength compared to P25, which is in good agreement with the conversion efficiency of the solar cells (Table 1 and Fig. S2†).

In summary, mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals have been synthesised by a one-step amino acid-assisted method, which is simple, eco-friendly, and easy to scale-up. The mesoporous structure of the closely packed TiO2 nanocrystals offers high surface area, small crystalline particle size and superior connectivity between particles. An ∼18% enhancement in DSSC conversion efficiency was achieved with cells assembled with the mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals compared to the commercial P25 nanoparticles. The improved dye loading capacity due to the increased surface area, the reduced charge recombination as a result of the better connectivity and conductivity of the mesoporous network and the uniform particle size of the film are favourable for the enhanced efficiency.
