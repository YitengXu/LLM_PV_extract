Broader context
The ever-increasing global demand for low-cost and sustainable energy resources has greatly encouraged the technological progress of dye-sensitized solar cells, primarily owing to their great potential to afford solar electricity based on resource-abundant raw materials and energy-saving device processing. Thus far, an outstanding dye-sensitized solar cell has attained over 11% power conversion efficiency at an AM1.5 full sunlight irradiation, by employing a panchromatic ruthenium dye and an iodine electrolyte. Actually, the iodide/triiodide redox couple has served as a unique option for the fabrication of high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells. On the other hand, a number of disadvantageous features of iodine electrolytes have also been identified, which have stimulated the exploration of redox couples alternative to their conventional iodide/triiodide counterpart in the past decades. In this work, we formulate an electrolyte based on the tri(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle, and fabricate an over 8% efficiency iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cell, which should encourage further exploration in this direction.

In the fabrication of high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs),1 the iodine electron mediator has so far served as a very successful option owing to an expeditious electron donation from iodide to some photo-oxidized dye molecules, a sluggish recombination of photoinjected electrons in titania with triiodide, and a rapid mass transport of redox ions in a thin-layer sandwich device architecture.2 However, some major drawbacks have also been identified for this redox couple, including the dissipative light absorption of triiodide and the electrolyte corrosiveness towards most metal current collectors.3 Moreover, it is worthy of noticing a discrepancy in the thermodynamics of the iodide/triiodide couple determining the electrolyte Fermi-level and the iodide/diiodide radical closely related to dye regeneration, which has resulted in a large reduction of the potential.2 Therefore some attempts have been made to explore other redox shuttles such as nickel4 and copper5 complexes, halogens6 and pseudohalogens7 and some electroactive organic compounds.8,9 Since the seminal report on the application of a cobalt electrolyte in DSCs by Grätzel et al.,10 some polypyridyl cobalt redox complexes have been examined in the past decade, with consecutive efficiency enhancements being attained.11–15 However, to date none of one-electron outer-sphere redox couples has been demonstrated in making efficient cells with a power conversion efficiency over 7% measured under the AM1.5 full sunlight conditions.
We herein formulate a noncorrosive redox electrolyte based on the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox couple and demonstrate an efficient iodine-free DSC in conjunction with our model organic dye C218 (Fig. S1 of the Electronic Supplementary Information†), which features a high optical absorption coefficient and a reduced charge recombination rate as discussed in an earlier work.16 The electrolyte compositions and cell fabrication procedure are detailed in the experimental section. Note that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide is applied here as the anion of the cobalt complex, allowing of a high electrolyte concentration. The steady-state current density limited by the cobalt(III) transport in a symmetric thin-layer electrochemical cell consisting of two platinized FTO electrodes amounts to ∼39 mA cm−2 (Fig. S2†) for our cobalt electrolyte.
We first measured the incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) against wavelength, as presented in Fig. 1(A). With respect to the iodine control electrolyte, the cobalt congener endows the stained titania thin film with an enhanced photocurrent response in the spectral range from 390 to 470 nm. This scenario can be rationalized in terms of the remarkably lower absorption coefficients in the blue region of the cobalt electrolyte in contrast to those of the iodine counterpart (Fig. S3†), ensuring a better light harvesting by the C218 dye molecules anchored on titania. Moreover, both cells exhibit a broad IPCE plateau from 490 to 570 nm with comparable IPCE maxima (cobalt: ∼85%, iodine: ∼83%), implying a saturated light absorption in this wavelength range. This could be attributed to the high molar absorption coefficient of C218 as well as the light-scattering functionality of our double-layer titania film.17 The solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency was further evaluated by measuring the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 1(B)) at an irradiation of 100 mW cm−2AM1.5 simulated sunlight, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1.

The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of a typical cell with the cobalt electrolyte are 14.1 mA cm−2, 0.82 V and 0.72, respectively, affording an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.3%. In contrast, the iodine control cell exhibits a slightly decreased Jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2, in accord with the preceding IPCE measurements. Furthermore, a remarkably decreased Voc of 0.72 V can be noticed upon the employment of the iodine redox couple, leading to a relatively lower η of 7.1%. Note that with an optimized iodine electrolyte and a thick titania film, an ∼9% efficiency could be attained for the C218 dye.16 Moreover, from the photovoltaic parameters measured under different illuminations (Tables 1 and S1†), an almost linear dependence of Jsc on incident light intensity can be seen for both cells, suggesting that we have successfully removed the notorious mass transport problem on cobalt shuttles as previously reported.12 While a long-term stability under the thermal and light-soaking stress needs to be addressed in future study, we observed a negligible efficiency decrease of our cobalt cell when it was left on the lab bench for about three months.
Evidently, the use of a cobalt redox shuttle can confer a salient Voc enhancement. The open-circuit photovoltage of a typical DSC is known as the energy offset between the quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) of a titania film and the Fermi-level (EF,redox) of a redox electrolyte. In order to clarify the physical origins of the notable Voc variation, we first employed a reference electrode composed of a platinum wire dipped in a DSC electrolyte-filled glass tube, the lower end of which was sealed with a porous ceramic frit, to measure the square-wave voltammogram (Fig. 2) of ferrocene dissolved in acetonitrile. In our experiments, a 5-μm-radius platinum ultramicroelectrode was used as working electrode and a platinum foil as auxiliary electrode. From the voltammetric measurements we calculated EF,redox of the cobalt and iodine electrolytes to be −0.03 and −0.26 V versusFc+/Fc, respectively. On the other hand, the EF,n of titania can be expressed as (1)where Ec is the conduction band edge of titania, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, nc is the free electron density and Nc the density of accessible states in the conduction band. Actually, the difference between Ec and EF,redox can be estimated from analysis of chemical capacitance (Cμ),18 which follows the relation19,20 (2)where Nt is the density of accessible interband states of titania, Tc is a characteristic temperature describing the distribution profile of surface states, e is the elementary charge and V is the potential bias in our impedance measurements. As shown in Fig. 3(A), the semi-logarithmic plots of Cμ against V exhibit comparable slopes for the cobalt and iodine cells, indicative of similar Tc values. Obviously, the cobalt cell possesses an ∼0.14 V larger value of Ec − EF,redox compared to the iodine congener. Thereby a ∼0.09 V more positive EcversusFc+/Fc can be noted for the cobalt cell, in contrast to the 0.13 V more positive EF,nversusFc+/Fc under the full sunlight illumination, as illustrated by Fig. 3(B). On the basis of this analysis, we anticipate that the cobalt redox couple evokes a faster interfacial charge recombination than the iodine counterpart, leading to an even lower free electron density (eqn (1)).

(B) Schematic energy diagrams. The electrolyte Fermi-level (EF,redox) as well as the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and titania quasi-Fermi-level difference (ΔEF,n) under the full sunlight illumination are included. (C) Apparent electron lifetime (τn) plotted against density of states (DOS). The solid lines are guides to the eye. 
Therefore, we further compare the dependencies of apparent electron lifetime (τn) on the density of states (DOS) for cells with the cobalt and iodine electrolytes, as presented in Fig. 3(C). Obviously, the employment of the cobalt(II/III) redox couple brings forth an ∼10-fold shorter electron lifetime at a given DOS, i.e., an acceleration of charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface. This observation could be further understood in terms of a Marcus normal-region behavior21 for the back electron transfer from titania to the oxidized species in an electrolyte, taking account of the aforementioned EF,redox variation. Actually, using the fittings in Fig. 3(A) one can estimate that there are more charges in the iodine cell under full sunlight illumination with respect to the cobalt cell, which can also be visualized from Fig. 3(B). Overall, the adverse impact of a faster charge recombination upon photovoltage partially compensates for the positive effect of the cobalt electrolyte correlated interfacial energetics, resulting in a 0.1 V Voc increment.
Although we did not observe a noteworthy difference between the IPCE heights with the cobalt and iodine electrolytes, it is still valuable to determine the net charge generation yields at the dye/titania/electrolyte interface and scrutinize the origins of non-ideal external quantum efficiencies. We resorted to the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique to evaluate the exciton dissociation at the dye/titania interface.22–24 A reference dummy cell was first constructed based on a C218-coated alumina film soaked in the cobalt or iodine electrolyte, which displays a strong photoluminescence (blue lines in Fig. S4†) upon laser excitation at 639 nm. On account of the straddling dye/alumina junction which is thermodynamically infeasible for charge generation, we assign these emissions to the irradiative and non-irradiative deactivation of excited-state dye molecules. However, significantly attenuated emissions (red lines in Fig. S4†) are noted upon replacing alumina with titania, implying the occurrence of electron injection at the energy-offset dye/titania interface. Calculations with integrals of area under the emission traces on titania and those on alumina afford comparable electron injection yields (ηinj) of 95% and 96% for the respective cobalt and iodine cell. Further endeavours are needed to convert absorbed photons to electrons quantitatively.
Transient absorption measurements were further carried out to examine the kinetic competition between the recombination of photoinjected electrons and oxidised dye molecules, and the interception of oxidised dye molecules by electron-donating species in electrolytes.25,26 Employing a cell made with a 3-μm-thick, dye-coated titania film immersed in the cobalt electrolyte, we first recorded the transient absorption spectrum with an intensified charge-coupled detector (ICCD) camera. As shown in Fig. 4(A), a broad negative signal arises in the visible region from 505 to 695 nm, which can be ascribed to the bleaching of ground-state dye molecules. We ascribe the positive absorption changes in the transient absorption spectrum mainly to the electronic excitation of oxidised dye molecules. Note here that electrons in titania present a molar absorption coefficient (ε780 = 3400 M−1 cm−1) in this spectral range,27 which is at least one order of magnitude lower than that of the C218 dye cations. In consideration of our detection time at 3 μs upon a nanosecond pulse excitation, we can exclude any contribution to the transient signals from the emission of excited-state dye molecules.

(B) Kinetic absorption traces of a 10-μm-thick, C218-coated titania film immersed in the inert (a) and cobalt (b) electrolytes. (C) Trace in the presence of the iodine electrolyte (c). Data for the inert electrolyte was also included for comparison. Smooth lines in panels (B) and (C) are stretched exponential fittings (mΔOD∝exp[−(t/τ)α]) over raw data obtained by averaging 800 laser shots. 
A monochromatic probe light at 782 nm was applied in the following transient kinetic measurements, during which the excitation fluence was carefully tuned to ensure that ∼7 × 1013photons cm−2 (∼0.8 photon per particle) were absorbed by the dye-coated film during every laser pulse. In the absence of electron-donating species in electrolytes, the absorption decay (trace a in Figs. 4(B) and 4(C)) can be attributed to the recombination of oxidised dye molecules with titania electrons, featuring a half-reaction time (t1/2) of 4 ms obtained through a stretched exponential fitting. A further employment of the cobalt electrolyte remarkably accelerates the absorption decay (trace b in Fig. 4(B)) through the electron donation from cobalt(II) to oxidized dye molecules, producing a t1/2 of 22 μs for the dye regeneration reaction. By comparison, the iodine electrolyte prompts slightly faster dye regeneration with an 18-μs half-reaction time (trace c in Fig. 4(C)). Hereby, we may image that the activation energy of oxidised dye molecule interception by cobalt(II) is probably comparable to that by iodide. In spite of the dissimilar dye regeneration kinetics, the branch ratios of the dual-channel charge transfer kinetics of oxidised dye molecules were over 180 for both redox systems, exerting negligible influences on the IPCE maxima.
Conclusions
In summary, by employing a high-absorption-coefficient organic dye, we have demonstrated an iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cell exhibiting an unprecedented 8.3% efficiency at an irradiation of AM1.5 full sunlight. Voltammetric measurements disclose that with respect to the iodine control electrolyte, the cobalt congener confers a 0.23 V positive shift of the electrolyte Fermi-level, dominating a 0.1 V augmentation of cell photovoltage and a 17% enhancement of device efficiency. However, electrical impedance analysis reveals that the cobalt electrolyte also evokes an evidently faster charge recombination of injected electrons with the cobalt(III) oxidized species, which partly compromises the advantageous energetic influence of the electrolyte Fermi-level on photovoltage. The net charge generation yields derived from photophysical measurements are in accord with comparable IPCE summits of the cobalt and iodine cells. Further sensible combinations of other cobalt redox couples with some innovative infrared absorption organic dyes are underway to make panchromatic tandem cells, which may challenge the present record efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. Also, it is necessary to identify some low-volatility solvents which can substantially solvate cobalt redox couples, boosting the practical application of iodine-free DSCs.

Experimental section

          Cell fabrication and characterization
A double-layer film of interconnected titania particles on the FTO conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar, 4 mm thick) was used as the negative electrode, which constitutes a 2.5-μm-thick transparent layer of 22-nm-sized TiO2 particles and a 4-μm-thick second layer of scattering particles (WER2-O, Dyesol). A circular TiO2 electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a dye solution of 150 μM C218 in chlorobenzene for 5 h. After washing with chlorobenzene and acetonitrile in turn, and further drying by air flow, the dye-coated titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized FTO electrode. The cobalt electrolyte is composed of 0.3 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt di[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.1 M nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4), 0.5 M 4-tert-pyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile. The apparent diffusion coefficient of tri(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) in acetonitrile is derived to be ∼7 × 10−6 cm2s−1 from the voltammogram (Fig. S5†) measured with a Pt ultramicroelectrode. Moreover, the approximately 2:1 ratio of the anodic and cathodic steady-state currents confirms that NOBF4 has been reduced to give ∼0.2 M cobalt(II) and 0.1 M cobalt(III) in this cobalt electrolyte. We further formulated an iodine control electrolyte consisting of 0.3 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.1 M iodine, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile, in order to perform some rough kinetic comparisons. The details on cell assembly and characterization are described in our previous publication.16 A model LS1000-4S-AM1.5G-1000W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 for J–V measurements. Electrical impedance spectroscopies of a testing cell under various irradiations given by a white light-emitting diode were recorded on an IM6ex electrochemical workstation, with a frequency range from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 20 mV. A voltage bias (V) was applied to equal the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of a testing cell at each irradiation intensity, fulfilling the criterion of an unmodulated current being zero. The obtained impedance spectroscopies were fitted using the Z-view software28 in terms of an appropriate equivalent circuit.
Voltammetric, steady-state absorption, transient absorption and emission measurements
A CHI660C electrochemical workstation was used for voltammetric measurements. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lamda 900 spectrometer. Transient absorption measurements were performed with a LP920 laser flash spectrometer pumped with a nanosecond tunable OPOLett-355II laser. The sample was kept at a 45° angle with respect to the excitation beam. Transient absorption spectrum was measured with an Andor ICCD using a xenon arc lamp as probe light source. In the kinetic measurements, the probe light was first passed through a bandpass filter (center wavelength: 782 nm), detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer. The pulse fluences and excitation wavelengths for the cells made with the inert, cobalt and iodine electrolytes are 44.1 μJ cm−2 at 665 nm, 43.8 μJ cm−2 at 671 nm and 43.8 μJ cm−2 at 670 nm, respectively. The composition of our inert electrolyte is 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. Photoluminescence measurements were carried out on a LifeSpec-II spectrometer employing an EPL635 pulsed laser diode and a Hamamatsu H5773-04 photomultiplier.

 	Fig. 4  (A) Transient absorption spectrum of a 3-μm-thick, C218-coated titania film recorded with an ICCD camera upon a 500-nm nanosecond laser excitation. (B) Kinetic absorption traces of a 10-μm-thick, C218-coated titania film immersed in the inert (a) and cobalt (b) electrolytes. (C) Trace in the presence of the iodine electrolyte (c). Data for the inert electrolyte was also included for comparison. Smooth lines in panels (B) and (C) are stretched exponential fittings (mΔOD∝exp[−(t/τ)α]) over raw data obtained by averaging 800 laser shots.
