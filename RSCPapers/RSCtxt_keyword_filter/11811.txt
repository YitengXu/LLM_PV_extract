    , Accepted 21st March 2017First published on 22nd March 2017AbstractA D–A copolymer donor, PSTTF2T, based on an alkylthio-substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit (STT), was developed for polymer solar cells. PSTTF2T is compatible with fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. PSTTF2T:PC71BM and PSTTF2T:ITIC solar cells gave power conversion efficiencies of 4.73% and 5.22%, respectively.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the blend of a D–A copolymer donor and a fullerene or a non-fullerene acceptor have exhibited over 11% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1 Side chain engineering could improve the photovoltaic performance of D–A copolymers significantly.2 Generally, alkyl side chains were used to adjust the solubility and the molecular packing of D–A copolymers. Alkoxy (–OR) and alkylthio (–SR) side chains can tune the energy levels effectively through the conjugation with the main chain.3 The alkylthio side chains have unique functions: (1) the empty 3d-orbitals of sulfur can accept π-electrons from the main chain via p(C)–d(S) interaction, thus lowering the HOMO level and increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc);4 and (2) the intermolecular S⋯S interaction facilitates π–π stacking, thus improving the hole mobility and enhancing the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).3,5 Li et al. first reported an alkylthio-substituted poly(p-phenylenevinylene), which gave a PCE of 1.4%.6 Later on, Li et al. synthesized alkylthio-substituted polythiophenes, which afforded deeper HOMO levels and higher Voc values than alkyl-substituted polythiophenes.7 Ferraris et al. prepared an alkylthio-substituted benzodithiophene unit (S-BDT) and used it to make a homopolymer S-PBDT, which delivered a Voc of 0.99 V and a PCE of 4%.8 By copolymerization of S-BDT with a triazole acceptor unit, Peng et al. obtained a high-performance D–A copolymer, PBDTFBZS, which gave a PCE of 7.74%.9 Li, Hou and Wong et al. further introduced alkylthio side chains into BDT-based two-dimensional (2D) D–A copolymers, which afforded high PCEs up to 10.2%.10 Very recently, Li et al. reported an alkylthio-substituted 2D copolymer, J61, which gave a PCE of 11.77% when blended with a non-fullerene acceptor, m-ITIC.11 All these results indicate that alkylthio-substituted D–A copolymers are promising for PSCs. In this work, we developed a D–A copolymer, PSTTF2T, by copolymerizing an alkylthio-substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene donor unit (STT) with a 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene acceptor unit (F2T). The F2T unit presents S⋯F noncovalent conformational locks.12 Although thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) has been widely used for making D–A copolymers, STT is less known.13PSTTF2T functions well in fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells, giving PCEs of 4.73% and 5.22%, respectively.
The synthetic route for PSTTF2T is shown in Scheme 1. 3,6-Dibromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene and 7-(bromomethyl)pentadecane were transformed into 3,6-dimethoxythieno[3,2-b]thiophene and 2-hexyldecane-1-thiol, respectively, according to the literature.14p-Toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA)-promoted transetherification installed two alkylthio chains onto TT and afforded STT in 70% yield.14a Bromination of STT with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) produced the monomer STT-Br in 90% yield. The copolymerization of STT-Br with (3,3′-difluoro-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) via Stille coupling gave PSTTF2T in 41% yield. For comparison, we also prepared the alkoxy-substituted analogue, POTTF2T (see the ESI†). PSTTF2T and POTTF2T show good solubility in common organic solvents. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) for PSTTF2T and POTTF2T are 56.7 kDa and 19.2 kDa, with PDIs of 3.50 and 5.88, respectively. The decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% wt loss) of PSTTF2T and POTTF2T are 335 °C and 299 °C, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for PSTTF2T. 
The absorption spectra of PSTTF2T and POTTF2T in solution and as films are shown in Fig. 1 and the optical data are listed in Table 1. In solution, PSTTF2T shows two peaks at 551 nm and 593 nm, respectively. For the film, the peaks shift to 560 nm and 607 nm, respectively. The spectrum of POTTF2T in solution is similar to that of PSTTF2T, with two peaks at 563 nm and 606 nm, respectively. For the POTTF2T film, however, the redshifts for the peaks are quite small, 1 nm and 4 nm, respectively. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of PSTTF2T and POTTF2T are 1.89 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively. The larger bandgap for PSTTF2T results from the weaker electron-donating capability of STT, since alkylthio chains can act as π-electron acceptors. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PSTTF2T and POTTF2T were calculated from the onset potentials of oxidation (Eonox) and reduction (Eonred), respectively (Fig. S13, ESI†).15 The HOMO level for PSTTF2T is 0.18 eV deeper than that of POTTF2T. Higher Voc values can be expected from PSTTF2T solar cells. The molecular packing for PSTTF2T and POTTF2T films was studied by XRD. PSTTF2T and POTTF2T films present weak (100) peaks at 2θ = 4.62° and 4.47°, respectively, corresponding to a lamellar d-spacing of 19.11 Å and 19.75 Å, respectively. They present (010) peaks at 2θ = 22.98° and 23.89°, respectively, corresponding to a π–π stacking d-spacing of 3.87 Å and 3.72 Å, respectively (Fig. S14, ESI†). The larger π–π stacking d-spacing for PSTTF2T might be due to the bigger volume of the sulfur atom.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells using PSTTF2T or POTTF2T as the donor and PC71BM or ITIC as the acceptor were fabricated. The cells have an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:acceptor/MoO3/Ag.16 The J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 2. The performance data are listed in Table 2. In either PC71BM or ITIC solar cells, PSTTF2T showed much better performance than POTTF2T. The best PSTTF2T:PC71BM cells gave a PCE of 4.73%, with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 8.54 mA cm−2 and an FF of 72.8%. These cells have a D/A ratio of 1:2.5 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 116 nm and 2% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). The best PSTTF2T:ITIC cells gave a PCE of 5.22%, with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 9.80 mA cm−2 and an FF of 57.4%. These cells have a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 71 nm and no additives (Tables S4–S6, ESI†). In contrast, POTTF2T:PC71BM and POTTF2T:ITIC cells afforded low PCEs of 2.15% and 1.85%, respectively. The Voc values for PSTTF2T cells are ∼0.3 V greater than those of POTTF2T cells because of the deeper HOMO level of PSTTF2T. PSTTF2T also delivered higher Jsc and FF values than POTTF2T in both PC71BM and ITIC cells, suggesting the better charge-transporting capability of PSTTF2T. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements confirmed the higher hole mobility of PSTTF2T. The hole mobilities for PSTTF2T and POTTF2T are 8.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.01 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 3).

PSTTF2T performed well in both fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells, indicating its good compatibility with different acceptors. PSTTF2T:ITIC cells outperformed PSTTF2T:PC71BM cells due to the higher Voc and Jsc values. The higher Voc results from the higher LUMO level of ITIC.17PSTTF2T:ITIC cells present higher EQEs at 626–788 nm, since ITIC can harvest photons at long wavelengths (Fig. 2b). DIO additive affects the performance of PSTTF2T:PC71BM cells and PSTTF2T:ITIC cells oppositely. For PSTTF2T:PC71BM cells, after adding 2% (v/v) DIO, the PCE increased from 0.62% to 4.73%, while for PSTTF2T:ITIC cells, the PCE decreased from 5.22% to 0.68% (Tables S3 and S6, ESI†). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 4) indicate that after adding 2% (v/v) DIO to the blend solution, the domain size of the PSTTF2T:PC71BM film decreased greatly and the film became smoother, with the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness decreasing from 9.25 nm to 0.97 nm. Typical nanofiber-like structures can be observed. In contrast, the domain size of the PSTTF2T:ITIC film increased after DIO was added and the film became rougher, with the RMS roughness increasing from 0.71 nm to 5.18 nm. For both fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells, the active layer with ideal nanoscale phase separation can afford sufficient D/A interfaces, thus producing higher Jsc. DIO can inhibit PC71BM from forming aggregates and promote mixing of PC71BM with the polymer donor, leading to a favourable morphology. It could promote ITIC's aggregation due to the extremely low solubility of ITIC in DIO, thus reducing D/A interfaces and photocurrent.

Conclusions
In summary, an alkylthio-substituted D–A copolymer (PSTTF2T) based on an STT unit was developed. Compared with the alkoxy-substituted analogue, PSTTF2T possesses a deeper HOMO level and a higher hole mobility, and exhibits better performance in BHJ solar cells, when blended with a fullerene acceptor or a non-fullerene acceptor. This work also suggests that STT is a promising building block for D–A copolymers. Further efforts towards developing efficient alkylthio-substituted D–A copolymers are ongoing.
