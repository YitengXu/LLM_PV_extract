    , Accepted 29th August 2012First published on 29th August 2012AbstractA series of organic dyes containing oligo-phenothiazine were synthesized and used effectively on the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In these compounds the phenothiazine moiety functions both as an electron donor and as a π-bridge. These materials exhibit considerably high values of open-circuit voltage (Voc) ranging from 0.78–0.83 V under an AM1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2). Two kinds of substituents, i.e., hexyl and hexyloxyphenyl groups, were added onto the N(10) of phenothiazine for comparison. The best device displayed a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 14.3 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.83 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.65, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 7.78%. Their photophysical properties were analyzed with the aid of a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) model with the B3LYP functional. The electronic nature of the devices was further elucidated by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Introduction
The increased consumption of fossil and the more serious crisis of environment pollution have led us to the search for new and renewable energy sources. Solar energy is widely recognized as the most promising candidate to help solving this problem. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are expected to be potential tools due to their low cost processing and impressive photovoltaic performance.1 The ruthenium-based dyes, reported by Michael Grätzel, have achieved maximal power conversion efficiencies over 11%. Yet they have encountered some problems, such as limited resources, elaborated purification processes, etc.2 Compared with the rare and expensive metal complexes, organic dyes have the advantages of environmental friendliness, higher structural flexibility, lower cost, generally high molar extinction coefficients, easier preparation and purification, etc. Metal-free organic dyes have been widely investigated recently, many of which exhibited an energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency close to that of N719.3–6
In the design of organic dyes for sensitized solar cells, it is critical to improve not only the value of the short-circuit current (Jsc) but also the value of the open-current voltage (Voc). For the former it is necessary to improve the π-conjugation, so that the organic chromophore can harvest light energy to the largest extent. For the latter an effort of reducing the rate of charge recombination is necessary, so that the current leakage can be minimized. In our previous investigations, we have discovered that it is possible to use non-conjugated π-chromophores for DSSCs, i.e., by incorporating a unit of paracyclophene to interrupt the π-system.7 The Voc value of these materials can indeed reach a high standard as a result of slow rate of charge recombination. However, the relatively small value of Jsc became a drawback, due to the breaking down of the π-conjugation.
In this report we try to re-examine our concept by using phenothiazine as a building block. Phenothiazine contains electron-rich nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms in the central ring, yet it is not fully conjugated in a classical sense. The geometry of the molecule is not planar, but slightly bent in the central ring. We envisioned that the non-planar conformation of phenothiazine can reduce not only the rate of charge recombination but also the molecular aggregation. The electron rich nature of a phenothiazine makes it a good electron donor during a photo-excited charge transfer transition. It displays a low and reversible oxidation potential toward the formation of a stable radical cation.8–11 By linking more than one unit of phenothiazine, we can examine the effect of chain length on the performance of DSSCs.
Three types of compounds composed of phenothiazine units are prepared, i.e., PT1, PT2, and PT3, as shown in Fig. 1. The nitrogen atoms in each type of compounds are substituted by two kinds of linear chains, i.e., derivatives a and b. A cyanoacrylate group is attached to one side of the compound, acting as an electron acceptor. The synthetic procedures of PT1, PT2, and PT3 are described in Scheme 1. All structures were confirmed by their spectroscopic data.

Experimental
General information
All reactions and manipulations were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were distilled freshly according to standard procedures. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker (AV 400/AV 500 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvents. Chemical shifts are reported in δ scale downfield from the peak for tetramethylsilane. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Jasco-550 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were obtained from a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter. The emission spectra in solutions were measured in a spectral grade solvent using a 90° angle detection. The redox potentials were measured by using cyclic voltammetry on a CHI 620 analyzer. All measurements were carried out in THF solutions containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as supporting electrolyte under ambient conditions after purging for 10 minutes with N2. The conventional three-electrode configuration was employed, which consists of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal reference. Mass spectra were recorded on a VG70-250S mass spectrometer.
The chemicals, i.e., phenothiazine, 4-bromophenol, 1-bromohexane, butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane), tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine) palladium (Pd(PPh3)4), N,N-dimethylformamide, triisopropylborate, palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2), 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene (dppf), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), cyanoacetic acid, ammonium acetate, and acetic acid, were purchased from ACROS, Alfa, Merck, Lancaster, TCI, Showa, and Sigma-Aldrich, separately. Chromatographic separations were carried out by using silica gel from Merk, Kieselgel si 60 (40–63 μm).
Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
The FTO conducting glass (FTO glass, fluorine doped tin oxide over-layer, transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 8 Ω per square), titania oxide pastes of Ti-nanoxide T/SP and Ti-nanoxide R/SP were purchased from Solaronix. A thin film of TiO2 (16–18 μm) was coated on a 0.25 cm2 FTO glass substrate. It was immersed in a THF solution containing 3 × 10−4 M dye sensitizers for at least 12 h, then rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile and dried. Another piece of FTO sputtered with 100 nm thick Pt was used as a counter electrode. The active area was controlled at a dimension of 0.25 cm2 by adhering 60 μm thick polyester tape on the Pt electrode. The photocathode was placed on top of the counter electrode and was tightly clipped together to form a cell. Electrolyte was then injected into the seam between two electrodes. An acetonitrile solution containing LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte 1 (E1). A solution of 3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (1.0 M), LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.03 M), guanidinium thiocyanate (0.1 M), and TBP (0.5 M) in MeCN:valeronitrile (85:15, v/v) was used as electrolyte 2 (E2). Devices made of a commercial dye N719 under the same conditions (3 × 10−4 M, Solaronix S.A., Switzerland) were used as reference. The cell parameters were obtained under incident light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 measured by a thermopile probe (Oriel 71964), which was generated by a 300 W (Oriel Class A Solar Simulator 91160A-1000, Newport) passing through an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel 74110). The light intensity was further calibrated by an Oriel reference solar cell (Oriel 91150) and adjusted to be 1.0 sun. The monochromatic quantum efficiency was recorded through a monochromator (Oriel 74100) under short-circuit conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectra of DSSCs were recorded by an Impedance/Gain-Phase analyzer (SI 1260, Solartron).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The key intermediate in the synthesis of PT1, PT2, and PT3 was the N-substituted 7-bromophenothiazine derivatives, i.e., compounds 1a and 1b that were prepared by N-alkylation. The phenothiazines with a carbaldehyde functionality (2, 4, and 5) were prepared from 10H-phenothiazine according to a sequence of Suzuki–Miyaura coupling12 followed by formylation to give the products with yields of 57–82%. The presence of an aldehyde group was verified by absorption at δ 9.68–9.81 ppm in 1H NMR. The final step was a Knoevenagel condensation between the carbaldehyde and cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate.13 The synthesis of PT1a was completed by a standard procedure as described in the ESI.†14 The structures of all new compounds were characterized by their spectroscopic data.
Absorption spectra
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of all dyes in CH2Cl2 solution and on TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, and the parameters are listed in Table 1. The compounds with multiple units of phenothiazine, i.e., PT2 and PT3, display longer absorption wavelengths than the mono-phenothiazine compound, i.e., PT1. All these dyes exhibit broad absorption in the range of 250–600 nm. The short wavelength region at 250–330 nm is attributed to localized π–π* and n–π* transitions, while the long wavelength region in the range of 459–496 nm is derived from intramolecular charge-transfer transitions (ICT). The intensity of UV transition increases with the number of phenothiazine units, i.e., PT3 > PT2 > PT1. The absorption photocurrent (Jsc) in maxima of ICT bands exhibits a similar trend in solutions.

The absorption spectra of all dyes absorbed on the surface of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3. The film absorption band displayed a blue shift of ca. 29–38 nm with respect to those in solutions, and the spectral difference among all dyes diminished. The blue shift appears to be a result of deprotonation of the carboxylic acid, when it is anchored onto the surface of titanium oxide.

Electrochemical properties
The oxidation potentials (Eox), corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dyes, were measured by cyclic voltammetry. The number of oxidative waves corresponds to the number of phenothiazine units in each compound. The lowest ionization potentials in THF solutions decreased in the order of PT1 > PT2 > PT3 (Fig. 4). It is clear that the adjacent phenothiazine moieties linked together in the same molecule can influence each other effectively. Such a conclusion is again supported by the result of theoretical calculations, which will be discussed in the following section. The LUMO levels of the dyes were estimated by the values of Eox and the zero–zero band gaps at the onset of absorption spectra (Table 1). For a DSSCs to work properly, both the HOMO and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels have to match the conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE) of the TiO2 electrode and the redox potential (0.4 V vs. NHE) of the iodine/iodide electrolyte. The energy levels of all dyes agree well with the requirements for an efficient flow of electrons.

Computational analysis
The electronic nature of the dyes was further explored by theoretical models. Full geometrical optimizations were performed by using the B3LYP/6-31G* hybrid functional implanted in Q-Chem. In the ground state the geometry of phenothiazine is not totally planar, but rather slightly bent in the center forming the shape of a butterfly. The dihedral angles are about 32° to 39° in each phenothiazine. Such a slight distortion does not seem to retard the resonance between the two fused benzene rings across the central phenothiazine moiety. As depicted in Fig. 5, the electron density in the HOMO levels of PT2 and PT3 spread over more than one phenothiazine unit. The strong resonance effect is beneficial to the migration of electrons upon photo-excitation.
 Fig. 5  Frontier molecular orbitals of PT1b, PT2b, and PT3b calculated with TDDFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) in vacuum. 
The electron density distribution in the LUMOs of the dyes is localized mainly on the cyanoacrylate end group as shown in Fig. 5. For PT1, a significant electronic delocalization appears between the cyanoacrylate and the adjacent ring in the nearest phenothiazine unit. This kind of interaction reduced the electronic density in the nearest phenothiazine unit and weakened its electron releasing property. As a result, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap in PT1 is wider than those in PT2 and PT3, therefore the ICT absorption band in the former exhibited a blue shift with respect to the latter. For PT2 and PT3, there exist more than one phenothiazine units, which are all potential electron donors in ICT transitions. In PT2 it is clear that the second phenothiazine moiety bears the most positive charge in the charge-separated state. For PT3 the answer may not be straightward before a quantitative analysis on the charge distribution in the excited state. In Fig. 5, a difference on Mulliken charge distributions between the ground state (S0) and excited state (S1) is plotted according to the estimation by the time dependent DFT/B3LYP model. From the bar chart in Fig. 6, it is clear that the second phenothiazine moiety carries most of the positive charge in the ICT state.

The bent structure of phenothiazine and its non-conjugation along the oligo-phenothiazine π-chromophores may slow down the rate of charge recombination in the excited state. The conformation of molecules is likely to be re-adjusted upon photo-excitation to accommodate the charge re-distribution along the chromophore. Any disturbance on the π-conjugation, either a distortion on molecular geometry or an interruption of the conjugation by heteroatoms, may reduce the rate of charge migration. As long as the charge-separated state can maintain a longer lifetime, a higher quantum efficiency can be achieved for the devices.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The DSSCs devices made with these dyes were fabricated according to a standard procedure. Two kinds of electrolytes were used in order to achieve the best result, i.e., system E1 was made of LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M), and TBP (4-tert-butylpyridine) (0.5 M) in MeCN, and system E2 was composed of 3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII)(1.0 M) and guanidinium thiocyanate (0.1 M), in addition to LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.03 M), and TBP (0.5 M) in a mixed solvent of MeCN and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). The parameters were measured under AM 1.5 solar light (100 mW cm−2), i.e., short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electrical photocurrent density (η) are summarized in Table 1. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) plots of all devices are shown in Fig. 7. An apparent improvement of Voc values was observed by using the new type electrolyte E2, e.g. an increase of ca. 0.10 V was obtained with respect to those using E1 (Table 1). However in all this studies, the value of Jsc seems to be the controlling factor on the performances. The trend of relative quantum efficiency follows the same order as the Jsc value, i.e., PT2 > PT1 > PT3. Among all dyes, the devices made with PT2b performed the best, with Jsc = 14.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 V, and FF = 0.64, which summed up to an overall quantum efficiency of 7.38%.

To optimize the performance of DSSCs, it is known that the alignment of dyes on the surface of TiO2 is a critical factor. The organic compound needs to be planted vertically on the surface of metal oxide, yet must not form aggregates of itself. It should also cover the surface as complete as possible to prevent a direct contact between TiO2 and the electrolyte. To achieve this goal, we have made the following designs: (1) to change the electrolyte system from E1 to E2 to help preventing short-circuit and increasing the Voc value. The lower concentration of LiI in E2 raises the potential level of conduction band of TiO2, therefore enlarges the Voc value.15 (2) To add substituents with alkyl chains to reduce aggregation.16 The substituent size on the nitrogen atoms in derivatives b (–C6H4OC6H13) is larger than that in derivatives a (–C6H13). A long chain is able to reduce the dark current by decreasing the rate of charge recombination. The effect is supported by the higher resistance in the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of derivatives b.17 The Voc values of derivatives b are considerably higher than those of derivatives a (Table 1). (3) To adjust the solvent used for anchoring the dyes onto TiO2. Among the solvents used, i.e., THF, CH2Cl2, EtOH–CH2Cl2, and MeCN–t-BuOH (1:1), the devices made with the latter gave the best result (Fig. S22, Tables S4, and S5†). Therefore the mixed solvent system of MeCN and t-BuOH in 1:1 ratio is used for the performance parameters listed in Tables 1 and 2.

The structure of oligo-phenothiazine is not totally linear, partly due to the non-planar geometry of the phenothiazine ring, and also because of the non-symmetrical 3,7-substituted linkages between the adjacent phenothiazine moieties. The bent shape of molecules may induce some disturbance on their alignment on the surface of TiO2. To improve the packing order of the dyes, adding DCA (deoxycholic acid) to the solution of the dyes may help. As indicated in Fig. 8 and Table 2, the improvement of DCA was quite prominent, particularly for PT2b. The best of DSSC device exhibited a Jsc value 14.33 mA cm−2, a Voc value 0.83 V, and a FF value 0.66. The overall conversion efficiency (η) of PT2b was found to be 7.78%.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to further elucidate the photovoltaic property (Fig. S26 and S27†). In the Nyquist plots a major semicircle was observed for each dye, which is related to the transport process at the interfaces between TiO2 and the electrolyte/dye.18 The charge recombination resistance at the TiO2 surface (Rrec) can be deduced by fitting the curves using Z-view software. This value is related to the charge recombination rate, e.g., a smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and therefore a larger dark current. The radius of the semicircles increase in the order of PT1 < PT2 < PT3. This trend appears to be consistent with the values of the open-circuit voltage. The electron diffuse lifetime can also be estimated in a Bode phase graph, while a shift to low frequency corresponds to a longer electron lifetime. A larger value of Voc corresponds to a longer electron lifetime, while PT2 and PT3 have a quite high Voc. The result indicated that the bent shape of phenothiazine with a long chain could prevent a direct contact between iodine and the TiO2 surface and therefore could reduce the charge recombination rate.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated that high performance DSSCs can be achieved by using the non-conjugated spacers constructed by the oligomers of phenothiazine, which act both as the electron donor and the bridge unit. In the trimer system, i.e., PT3a and PT3b, the central phenothiazine ring behaved as the strongest donor, which bears most of the positive charge in the charge-separated state. The performance of the dimer system, i.e., PT2a and PT2b, was better than the trimers, indicating that there exists a limiting factor on the length of the organic dyes. The promotion of Voc values by the non-conjugate chromophore was clearly evidenced by the high resistance of the electrochemical impedance spectrum. The high Voc values reached a level of >0.83 V, and the best conversion efficiency of 7.78% was obtained in PT2b. These results are also significantly better than the previous reports involving phenothiazine derivatives.14,19
