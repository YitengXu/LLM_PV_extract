    , Accepted 2nd May 2021First published on 3rd May 2021AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) can collect solar light from a large area and concentrate it on their small-area edges mounted with solar cells for efficient solar-to-electricity conversion. Thus, LSCs show huge promise for realizing building-integrated photovoltaics because of their semi-transparency and light weight. However, the low optical efficiency of LSCs becomes a great obstacle for their application in real energy conversion. Herein, yellow emissive carbon dots with a record-breaking ultrahigh quantum yield of up to 86.4% were prepared via a simple hydrothermal approach using low-cost precursors. By combining them with red emissive carbon dots (quantum yield of 17.6%), a large area (∼100 cm2) tandem LSC was fabricated. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the large-area carbon dot-integrated tandem LSC reaches up to 3.8%, which is among the best reported in literature for a similar lateral size of LSCs. In particular, the tandem structure based on two laminated layers is novel, and is fit for the real structural application of keeping windows warm, where two glass slides are usually used. The high-efficiency tandem LSC using eco-friendly carbon dots as fluorophores paves way for real applications of LSCs.
1. Introduction
Solar energy can be harvested using large-area sunlight collectors for photoelectrical conversion using transparent or semi-transparent luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) integrated with edge-mounted solar cells without sacrificing their see-through visibility, which makes them promising candidates for solar or smart windows.1–4 In general, an LSC comprises a transparent optical waveguide material-based slab containing highly emissive fluorophores, e.g., dyes/polymers,1,3,5 metal complexes,2,6 semiconductor quantum dots (QDs),7–9 carbon dots (CDs),4,10–13 and upconversion nanocrystals (NCs).14,15 Incident solar photons on a larger-area device surface are absorbed by the fluorophores, re-emitted at a longer (down-converting) or shorter (upconversion) wavelength, and waveguided by the total internal reflection to the edges of the LSC, where the emissions are collected by photovoltaic (PV) cells.16 LSCs could potentially be used for building integrated PV devices as a typical LSC is light-weight and semi-transparent, with tunable color.17–30 For practical utilization, device efficiency, operational stability, cost and environmental friendliness are critical issues that need to be addressed before their real applications. The key parameter of obtaining a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in an LSC is the selection of highly efficient fluorophores, which possess a wide absorption spectrum, high quantum yield (QY), large Stokes shift, and good stability.11 It is also very important to balance the PCE loss in the wavelength shift and PV conversion with the efficiency loss due to the re-scattering of light out of the collector.31 Up to date, most efficient LSCs rely on heavy-metal-containing QDs, which are effectively used in the LSC technology due to the advantages such as wide tunable absorption spectra, good photostability and high photoluminescence (PL) QY.7,32,33 However, it still suffers from solid-state concentration-induced emission quenching and light scattering losses. In addition, it possesses relatively high toxicity and high-cost due to the presence of heavy metal elements, which greatly limit their potential industrial applications.4 Therefore, it is a great challenge to fabricate LSCs using cost-effective strategy and environmentally friendly materials, which is a key point for practical uses.
In comparison with widely used fluorescent materials such as organic dyes/polymers, inorganic semiconductor QDs and perovskites,15,22,24,34–44 luminescent CDs synthesized using cost-effective, earth-abundant, and relatively non-toxic precursors have already attracted increasing research attention owing to their excellent properties, including low toxicity, biocompatibility, water solubility, environmental friendliness, low-cost, tunable absorption/emission, and ease of surface modification or functionalization.13 In recent years, luminescent CDs have been considered as suitable candidates for excellent fluorophores of high-performance LSCs. One attractive feature of CDs is that they do not contain heavy metals and can be synthesized on a large scale via cost-effective and “green” synthetic protocols. Furthermore, their tunable emission spectrum, high photostability, and large molar absorption coefficient are quite suitable for capturing the solar radiation. In 2017, one type of N-doped CDs (N-CDs) was embedded in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin film with the maximum fluorescence emission at 546 nm under 490 nm excitation in ethanol and has further been used in single-layer LSCs for the first time with a lateral dimension of 2.0 cm × 2.0 cm.4 Based on this, several different emitting CDs have been applied for large area single-layer LSCs.4,10,11,45–48 Usually, with the increase in the device size, the optical efficiency of LSCs decreases sharply due to the reabsorption energy loss. In addition, LSCs also suffer from the limited spectral coverage on the solar spectrum, working mainly in the UV-blue range. To further enhance the LSC performance, several attempts to realize tandem LSCs have been made by using pure CDs or a combination of CDs with other fluorophores, such as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecules,49 organic dyes50 or perovskite QDs.34 The limitation of a single layer with one type of emitter can be overcome by designing a tandem LSC with several different emitters, each operating in a specific spectral range. ZdraŽil et al. fabricated a three-layer LSC using three types of CDs (blue, green, and red) with a size of 64 cm2, obtaining an external optical quantum efficiency of 2.3%.51 The obtained efficiency in the LSCs based on CDs is still lower than most of LSCs based on inorganic QDs with identical device dimensions. It is still a huge challenge to produce CD integrated tandem LSCs with high efficiency.
In this study, inspired by multicolor CDs based on phenylenediamine (PD) isomers, long-wavelength multicolor-emitting CDs (red and yellow CDs) were synthesized by a facile and controlled way, involving a one-step hydrothermal synthesis of PD isomers (o-PDs) in the presence of dopamine or L-tyrosine (Fig. 1). Subsequently, we demonstrated a new structured tandem large-area LSC (10 × 10 cm2) based on yellow CDs (Y-CDs) and red CDs (R-CDs). The proposed design of the tandem LSC consists of two waveguide LSCs separated by a 2 mm air gap. The top waveguide is based on Y-CDs, while the bottom one is based on R-CDs, as shown in Fig. 1 (left lower corner). Such a design improves the overall efficiency of the LSC device. The results show that this tandem LSC (100 cm2) reaches a PCE of 3.8%, which is a significant enhancement compared with that of previously reported large-scale CD-based LSCs, and higher than the latest results reported for hybrid tandem structures.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Reagents and materials
In the present study, o-PDs, hydrochloric acid (HCl), dopamine (DA), L-tyrosine (LTy), methanol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were supplied by Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, China.
2.2 Synthesis of Y-CDs and R-CDs
Yellow and red emissive CDs were prepared via a hydrothermal method52 and the procedure is as follows:

Y-CDs. 
1.0 mmol of o-PDs was mixed with 1.0 mmol of LTy and the mixture was dissolved in 15 mL of ultrapure water. The mixture was then sonicated for 15 min, and subsequently, transferred to a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon)-lined autoclave (25 mL) and heated at 200 °C for 8 h. The reactor was automatically cooled to room temperature and the solution was gently removed. Furthermore, the reactor was soaked in methanol and sonicated for 30 min.


R-CDs. 
1.0 mmol of o-PDs was mixed with 1.0 mmol of DA and the mixture was dissolved in 15 mL of ultrapure water and a small amount of HCl was added. The mixture was then sonicated for 15 min, and subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave (25 mL) and heated at 200 °C for 8 h. The reactor was automatically cooled to room temperature and the solution was gently removed. Furthermore, the reactor was soaked in methanol and sonicated for 30 min.
The as-fabricated Y-CDs and R-CDs were first purified by filtration using polycarbonate membrane filters (from Filter-Lab) with a pore size of 0.22 μm. The samples were then rotated and evaporated at 35–50 °C. After adding a few drops of deionized water from the original volume, the samples were concentrated to two-thirds of the original volume by rotary evaporation. Then, in order to remove small organic molecules, the samples were taken out and dialyzed for 36 h using 500 Da molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) Pur-A-Lyzer mega tubes (from Sigma-Aldrich) under magnetic stirring. Finally, the samples were freeze-dried for characterization and LSC device applications.

2.3 Fabrication of thin-film CD-polymer LSCs
Different concentrations of CDs (0.5–2 mg mL−1) were dispersed in a methanol/PVP solution (PVP K30 concentration: 100 mg mL−1 and PVP K90 concentration of 100 mg mL−1). After sonication for 1 h, the clear solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm in order to obtain a bubble-free solution. The solution was further drop-casted on the glass (10 × 10 × 0.4 cm3) and dried at room temperature condition for 1 h until all solvent had evaporated. Thereafter, another glass slide of the same dimension was placed on the top of the CD/PVP thin film. Finally, a PV was mounted on the edge of LSC using epoxy glue.
2.4 Characterizations
Absorption spectra of CDs were recorded on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV2600, Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan). PL spectra of CDs were recorded at room temperature on a time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer (FL3-22, Jobin–Yvon, USA). The fluorescence delay was achieved by an automatic delay stage (M-ILS300LM, Newport, USA). The intensity of the pump light was directly measured using a power meter (Model 843-R, Newport). The focal size of pump beam (∼0.1 mm) was measured using a beam profiler (LBP2-HR-VIS2, Newport, USA). The morphology of samples was measured via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2100F TEM (JEOL, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Electron Co., USA). Raman spectra were recorded using LABHRev-UV (532 nm laser). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany, Kα = 1.5406 Å). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the samples were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped (USA). Photovoltaic properties of LSCs were obtained with a solar simulator (IV4112, Newport Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun), calibrated through a calibrated silicon solar cell.
3. Results and discussion
Highly luminescent yellow and red emissive CDs were synthesized via a hydrothermal method (as shown in Fig. 1). The size and morphology of the as-synthesized CDs were characterized by TEM. Typical TEM images of Y-CDs and R-CDs are presented in Fig. 2a–f together with the corresponding size distribution histograms calculated from the measurements of more than 120 observed particles of each type by TEM. The as-prepared CDs have uniform quasi-spherical shapes with sizes varying from 1.5 to 8 nm (an average value of 3.45 nm) for Y-CDs. Also, the size of the as-synthesized R-CDs varies from 2.5 to 12.5 nm with an average value of 7.02 nm. The chemical structures of CDs were characterized by FT-IR. The obtained result is provided in the ESI (Fig. S1a and S1b†); which confirms that CDs have a similar chemical composition and material structure to those reported in previously published synthetic protocols.52,53 In the FT-IR spectra, the peak at 3300–3500 cm−1 indicated the presence of –NH2 or –OH; the peak at 2800–3000 cm−1 indicated the presence of C–C or C–H; the peaks at 1642 and 1524 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations of CO, CN, and CC bonds, and the peak at 1102 cm−1 was assigned to the C–N stretching vibrations. Consequently, the obtained CDs contain conjugated bonds in their core structure and primary amino groups of the precursor molecule. This is corroborated by the XPS measurement. Raman scattering reveals the structural characteristics of C atoms in CDs. As shown in Fig. S2,† the Raman spectrum of the CDs features two peaks corresponding to D bands and G bands. The intensity ratio of characteristic Raman bands (ID/IG) can be used to study the structural properties of the carbon skeleton, particularly the crystallinity and relative abundance of the carbon core and surface atoms.53ID/IG = 1.2 for Y-CDs and 0.97 for R-CDs, and the possible reason for this is that the tiny graphitized CDs are embedded in some disordered carbon.

The XPS survey spectra (Fig. 3a and d) indicate the presence of carbon (C 1s), nitrogen (N 1s), and oxygen (O 1s) species at 284, 398, and 531 eV binding energies, respectively. The XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 3a indicated that Y-CDs comprised C, N, and O elements with contents of 72.17%, 5.2%, and 22.63%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3d, R-CDs comprised of C, N, and O elements with contents of 81.14%, 2.68%, and 16.18%, respectively. More details about the chemical bonds of these species are shown by high resolution XPS spectra (Fig. 3b, c, e, f and Fig. S3a and S3b†). For Y-CDs, the convoluted C 1s spectrum in Fig. 3b can be decomposed into four peaks: the binding energy of 283.6 eV corresponds to C–C/CC, 284 eV corresponds to C–O, 285.6 eV corresponds to C–N, and 287.2 eV corresponds to CO. The N 1s spectrum in Fig. 3c is compared to 397.6, 398.5, and 400.3 eV, which are assigned to pyridinic-N (N–H), pyrrolic-N (C–N–C) and graphitic-N (N–(C)3), respectively. The high-resolution spectrum of O 1s can be decomposed into four peaks with binding energies of 530.6, 531.3, 532.4 and 535.1 eV corresponding to C–O/C–O–C, CO, O–H and O–CO (Fig. S2a†). Similarly, for R-CDs, the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 3e) can be decomposed into three peaks, the binding energy of 283.8 eV corresponds to C–C/CC, 284.6 eV corresponds to C–N, and 286.1 eV corresponds to CO. The N 1s spectrum in Fig. 3f is compared to 398.1 (N–H), 398.6 (C–N–C), and 399.6 eV (N–(C)3). The high-resolution spectrum of O 1s can be decomposed into three peaks with binding energies of 530.2, 531.4 and 532.6 eV corresponding to C–OH/C–O–C, CO and O–H (Fig. S3b†). The XPS intensity at near 531 eV sharply increases from Y-CDs to R-CDs. In addition, the graphitic N is significantly increased from Y-CDs to R-CDs. These findings indicate that both CO and graphitic N may play important roles in the red emission.

The optical properties of the yellow and red-emitting CDs were investigated in diluted solutions at room temperature via UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, as shown in Fig. 4 (Y-CDs and R-CDs were dispersed in methanol). UV-Vis absorption and the steady-state PL spectra for the CDs are shown in Fig. 4a and d, respectively, and the photographs of the emitting CDs under UV light (365 nm) are shown in the insets. The solution showed four UV absorption peaks at 223, 252, 280, and 404 nm for Y-CDs (Fig. 4a). Also, the R-CD solution showed three absorption peaks at 223, 280, and 555 nm (Fig. 4d). The absorption at 223 nm was attributed to the π–π* transition of the aromatic CC bond, and the absorption at 252 nm and 280 nm was attributed to the n–π* transition of the sp2 system containing CO and CN bonds, respectively.52 The peak at 404 nm or 555 nm may due to other functionalized surface groups of CDs.53 When the aqueous Y-CDs were excited at 545 nm, they exhibited strong fluorescence in the range of 500–750 nm, with two peaks at 594 nm and 646 nm and a maximum peak located at around 594 nm. Also, when the aqueous R-CDs were excited at 555 nm, they exhibited strong fluorescence in the range of 575–800 nm, with two peaks at 650 nm and 700 nm and a maximum peak located at around 650 nm. Furthermore, they exhibited obvious excitation-dependent or excitation-independent fluorescence, as shown in Fig. 4c and e. The PL excitation–emission mappings for Y-CDs and R-CDs are presented in Fig. S4a and S4b.† For yellow CDs, with the increase in the excitation wavelength, the emission peak exhibited an evident red-shift. This indicates that yellow CDs exhibited a typical excitation-dependent emission, which is usually due to the presence of multiple-energy transitions. In high contrast, the red CDs exhibited an excitation-independent emission because the emission originates from one dominant recombination center. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime decay of the CDs was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4c and f, the origin of fluorescence is studied by an automatic delay stage. The insets in Fig. 4c and f show that the lifetimes over the whole emission spectra can be fitted to two exponential components. The fluorescence behaviors were on the nanosecond timescale, indicating that the samples had only fluorescence properties, with the longest lifetime of 2.04 ns for Y-CDs and 1.53 ns for R-CDs. As the CDs had a slightly different lifetime in the same excitation wavelength and the different emission wavelength, the obtained result is provided in the Table S1.† The obtained QY of the Y-CDs is up to 86.4% and that of R-CDs is 17.6%.

The as-prepared CDs were dispersed into a PVPK30/K90 mixture in methanol and the laminated LSC was further prepared by a drop-casting approach on glass with a lateral size of 10 × 10 cm2 (detailed preparation information is included in the Experimental section). Considering the environmental sensitivity of all fluorophores, the laminated structure compared to the single layer LSC can isolate the fluorophores from the surrounding moisture or chemicals, and thus provide a potential for PV windows. The as-prepared laminated LSCs based on yellow and red CDs are semi-transparent (Fig. 5a and b). A clear concentrated light can be seen on the edge of the LSC and a clear “Luminescent solar concentrator” on the bottom of LSC can be seen. The absorption spectrum of the solid-state laminated LSC is shown in Fig. 5c. Y-CDs with optimized concentration (2 mg mL−1) can absorb 7% of solar energy and R-CDs can absorb 24% of the solar energy (Fig. 5c). As there is no significant spectral overlap between the absorption and PL of Y-CDs (Fig. 4a), a significant PL peak shift as a function of distance (between the excitation beam and edge of LSC for emission collection) was not observed, indicating a small energy loss because of reabsorption. For the R-CDs, we observed an obvious PL peak shift with the increase in the distance from 1 to 2 cm (Fig. 5e). Further increasing the distance did not lead to a significant PL peak shift. As the emission located on the high energy has a strong overlap with the absorption, the strong reabsorption leads to a large decrease in emission. With longer distance, this reabsorption effects becomes a less dominant factor, explaining the slight emission variation.

(c) Calculated solar absorption of the LSCs and solar spectrum (AM 1.5G). The concentration of CDs in PVP was 1 wt% in PVP. PL spectra measured at different optical paths (L) for the yellow (d) and red CDs (e) based LSCs. The excitation wavelength is 400 nm. 
To further clearly understand the L dependent optical efficiency in LSCs based on CDs, we calculated the external optical efficiency (ηopt) of the LSCs based on a reported method.44 ηopt = ηAbs × ηinternal(1)where ηAbs is the absorbed sunlight by the LSC, obtained by eqn (2) and ηinternal is the internal quantum efficiency of the LSC, obtained by eqn (3). (2) (3)where α is the absorption coefficient, d is the effective length, A the measured absorption of the LSC, and Iin is the Sun irradiance, and SPL(λ) is the measured PL spectrum; β is a numerical value fixed at 1.4 and Llsc is the length of the LSC. Assuming an isotropic emission, PTIR is defined by the escape cone identified by the critical angle θ of the air/glass interface (in this case PTIR = 0.75), the ηQY of the LSCs based on Y-CDs is 86.4% (measured) and that of R-CDs is 17.6% (measured). As shown in Fig. 6a, the ηopt of LSCs using R-CDs has an obvious drop in the external optical efficiency as compared to that based on Y-CDs. This fast drop in the R-CD-based LSCs should be due to the relatively low QY of R-CDs and the pronounced overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of R-CDs as compared to Y-CDs. When the L is lower than 14 cm, the external optical efficiency of R-CD-based LSCs is still higher than that of the Y-CD-based LSC. This behavior is because of the strong overlap between the absorption and Sun's spectrum in the R-CD-based LSC (24% vs. 7% of Y-CDs). With further increase in L, the external optical efficiency of the LSC based on Y-CDs starts to increase beyond that of the R-CD-based LSC, indicating a smaller energy loss from reabsorption and higher QY of Y-CDs with respect to R-CDs. As shown in Fig. 6a, the tandem LSC based on laminated LSCs exhibits a ηopt of up to 3.5% at the lateral size of 1 m2, which is higher than that of individually laminated LSCs based on Y-CDs or R-CDs. This high efficiency indicates a great potential for the CD-based LSCs for real solar energy conversion.

We further optimized the concentration of the CDs and preparation conditions, and measured the PCE of the laminated LSCs based on R-CDs or Y-CDs, and tandem LSC (two laminated overlap with a gap of 2 mm) under natural environment 60 mW cm−2 (Fig. 6b) (Winter, 12 AM, Qingdao). The PCE of LSCs was measured using a calibrated silicon PV (Zolix QE-B1). The laminated LSCs have a PCE of 2.3% and 2.7% for Y-CDs and R-CDs, respectively. For the tandem structured LSC, a PCE of ∼3.8% was obtained. This value is among the best reported in the literature for the similar lateral size of the LSCs (Table 1).54–58 The high efficiency obtained in this study is possible due to the following reasons: (1) efficiently absorb the sunlight as the sunlight is split and absorbed by two emitters with different absorption ranges; (2) the less reabsorption energy loss because of the small geometrical factor (G = 2.5 in this study), benefiting from the laminated and tandem structure. In addition, this newly designed tandem structure is fit for the real structural application of keeping windows warm, in which two glass slides are usually used; (3) the R-CDs have a broad absorption range, matching with the Sun's spectrum (24%). Further increase in the QY of R-CDs can enhance the external optical efficiency of the LSCs.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized highly emissive yellow and red CDs via a simple hydrothermal approach. The size of R-CDs was around 7.02 nm, which is much larger than that of Y-CDs (3.45 nm). The obtained QY of the Y-CDs was 86.4% and that of R-CDs was 17.6%. A large area (100 cm2) tandem LSC was then fabricated using highly emissive yellow and red CDs. The PCE of the tandem LSC (100 cm2) prepared using eco-friendly CDs can reach as high as 3.8%, which is among the best reported in literature for a similar lateral size of LSCs. Our designed tandem structure based on two laminated layers is novel and fit for the real structural application of keeping windows warm. The achieved high efficiency tandem LSC with eco-friendly CDs as fluorophores paves way for the real applications of CDs based LSCs.
