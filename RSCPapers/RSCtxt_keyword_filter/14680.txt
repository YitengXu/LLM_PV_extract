    , Accepted 2nd June 2015First published on 4th June 2015AbstractZnO films with several microstructures including nanoparticles, nanowire arrays, nanorod arrays and nanotube arrays were prepared using different methods. In2O3 and/or Cu4Bi4S9 were deposited onto each nanostructured ZnO film, and two types of heterostructures (ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9) as well as solid state dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated. The signals of steady state and electric field-induced surface photovoltage spectroscopy indicate that all of ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 heterostructures exhibit higher photovoltaic response than the relative ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9. The same type of heterostructure with different ZnO films presents various photovoltaic properties. Transient surface photovoltage spectroscopy can contribute to study the separation and transport mechanism of photogenerated charges. Here, ZnO nanotubes/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO nanotubes/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 cells exhibit the best performances with the highest efficiencies of 6.2% and 6.8%, respectively. The internal relations of photoelectric properties to some factors, such as film thickness, surface area, microstructure, double energy level matchings, etc. were discussed in detail. Qualitative and quantitative analysis further verified the comprehensive effect and the difference of factors. The exploration to understand the transport mechanism of light-induced charges in composite films will promote the nanocrystal application in solid state solar cells and photovoltaic community.
1. Introduction
It is known that single crystalline silicon (Si) p–n junction solar cells are the first generation solar cells, which have dominated the photovoltaic (PV) market with a conversion efficiency of up to 25%.1 Thin film solar cells are the second generation solar cells utilizing a much thinner absorber layer. Although the cost of second generation solar cells has decreased, the photoelectric conversion efficiency is lower than that of the first generation solar cells.2,3 In order to combine high performance and low cost, the third generation solar cells known as various nanostructured solar cells are fabricated using semiconductor nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, etc.4,5 For all three generation solar cells, the main objective is to enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges. It is reported that zinc oxide (ZnO) has several advantages over other traditional materials as a photoanode.6–13 Particularly, ZnO with one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure has become a promising candidate for preparing solar cells due to its direct paths for charge transport and high surface area for light harvesting. For a single ZnO nanowire, electron mobility has reached about 1000 cm2 V s−1. Moreover, ZnO is a wide band gap semiconductor material and exhibits excellent optical stability as a photoanode.
Indium oxide (In2O3) is a transparent oxide semiconductor with a wide band gap (a direct band gap of 3.5–3.7 eV and an indirect band gap of 2.6 eV), which is often used as a transparent electrode in optoelectronic devices (such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes14–16), sensors for gas and biological sensing, etc. For Cu4Bi4S9 (CBS), the photoelectric devices based on single crystal Cu4Bi4S9 nanowires exhibited the photoconductive response with a high external quantum efficiency (2.9 × 108%).17 The measured temperature-dependent electrical transport properties of Cu4Bi4S9 nanowires presented the typical semiconductor behaviour in the temperature region of 10–140 K and the metal-like characteristics in the temperature region of 150–300 K.17 The 1D Cu–Bi–S nanostructure (Cu4Bi4S9), specifically the Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons with excellent surface photovoltaic properties have been reported by Li et al.18 Recently, a set of solid state solar cells with Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons as absorber layer have been studied in our previous work, which indicates that Cu4Bi4S9 has potential applications in the preparation of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).19 But the photoelectric properties and charge dynamics of heterojunctions with ZnO, In2O3 and CBS have not been reported.
Utilizing ZnO as a photoanode (high electron mobility, surface area and optical stability), In2O3 as a buffer layer and CBS as an inorganic dye (excellent optical absorption), two types of heterostructures (ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9) and relative DSSCs were fabricated with different ZnO microstructures. Based on the superior properties of components in the optimized combination of heterostructures, we want to achieve a high separation efficiency of photogenerated charges in a broad region. However, there are various photoelectric properties for two types of heterostructures and DSSCs with different ZnO microstructures. From our previous studies,19–24 we found some main factors having a direct effect on the separation of photogenerated charges. In our work, we aim to further explore the transport of photogenerated charges and the charge dynamics in two types of heterostructures.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of samples
All of reagents and solvents are of analytical grade or better and were obtained from Aladdin. 6 mmol of In (NO3)3·4.5H2O (AR, 99.0%) was dissolved into 60 mL of C5H8O2 (AR, ≥99.0%) and was stirred to get a transparent solution. Then 5 mL of C3H8O2 (AR, ≥99.0%) was injected into the solution under constant stirring for 1 h until a transparent sol of In2O3 was obtained at room temperature. The sol was diluted before preparing heterostructures.
For the fabrication of several nanostructured ZnO films, first, 0.2 mmol of Zn (CH3COO)2·2H2O (AR, >99.5%) was dissolved into 50 mL of C3H8O2 (AR, ≥99.0%). Then 0.2 mmol of C2H7NO (AR, 99%) was added to the solution and stirred continuously at a temperature of 60 °C to get a transparent and homogeneous sol of ZnO. Subsequently, the ZnO sol was deposited onto an ITO conductive glass (resistance: 7.9 ± 0.4 Ω sq−1, transmittance ≥ 86.5%) via a spin-coating method and the substrate was quickly crystallized by thermal annealing for 10 min at 500 °C. The same process was repeated ten and fifteen times to get two different ZnO nanoparticle films, respectively. One and three times of the preparing process were carried out and then annealed at 500 °C for 0.5 h to get thinner and thicker ZnO-seeded ITO substrates. Second, ZnO nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes were prepared when thinner and thicker ZnO-seeded ITO substrates were sealed in each vial containing an equimolar solution of 0.1 M zinc nitrate (AR, 99.0%) and hexamethylenetetramine (AR, ≥99.0%). For three thinner substrates, the first and second substrates were kept at 70 °C for 6 h and at 90 °C for 10 h in the solution, respectively, and then cooled down to room temperature. The third substrate was kept at 90 °C for 3 h in the solution and then cooled down to a given temperature at 60 °C for 20 h. The same process was repeated for three thicker substrates. Finally, several substrates were removed from the solution, rinsed with deionized water (electric conductivity ≤1 US/CM), and then dried to get two types of ZnO nanowire arrays, nanorod arrays and nanotube arrays.
On the preparation of CBS nanoribbons: 0.5 mmol of BiCl3 (99.99% metal basis), 0.5 mmol of CuCl (≥99.95% metal basis) and 0.7 g of dodecylamine (98%) were dissolved into 30 mL toluene (AR, ≥99.95%) in a 50 mL flask. The flask was heated to 70 °C and kept at this temperature for 30 min with continuous stirring until a blue transparent solution was obtained. Subsequently, 250 μL of CS2 (anhydrous, ≥99%) was added to the solution slowly, and the blue solution turned into a nut-brown colloid gradually. Then the colloid was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and sealed quickly. Next, the autoclave was maintained at 180 °C for 30 h and cooled naturally to room temperature. Finally, the obtained CBS nanoribbons were washed thoroughly with ethanol (AR, >99.5%) and dried for 4 h at 60 °C under vacuum. Single Cu4Bi4S9 electrodes were prepared via a spin-coating method with thicknesses of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, and 9 μm.
For the synthesis of two types of heterostructures (ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9), first, the In2O3 colloid was deposited onto four thinner ZnO substrates via a spin-coating method. Then these ZnO films were quickly crystallized by thermal annealing for 10 min at 500 °C. The same process was repeated ten times and then four composite films were annealed at 500 °C for 0.5 h. Second, all of ZnO and In2O3/ZnO films were soaked in a CBS sol for 0.5 h and then the CBS colloid was spin-coated onto these substrates. Subsequently, these composite structures were maintained at room temperature for 0.5 h and dried in turn. Similarly, the same process was repeated ten times and then these composite films were maintained in an autoclave at 180 °C for 30 h to get two types of heterostructures. Finally, all of heterostructures (ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9) were determined with profilometry having the same thickness of 6.5 μm. Other thicknesses (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 μm) of two types of heterostructures were also fabricated in our work.
2.2. Characterization of samples
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of nanocrystals were carried out using a Philips X’ Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation (wavelength = 0.154 nm). Diffuse reflectance spectra were collected on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000) with BaSO4 as the reference standard and were converted to the absorbance data using the Kubelka–Munk method. The morphologies of the ZnO microstructure and two types of heterostructures were determined using the field-emission scanning electron microscopy system (SEM, JSM-7001F). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100UHR) was used to observe the microstructure of CBS nanoribbons. The thickness of the heterostructure was determined by profilometry (Dektak 3 profilometer, Veeco). The surface areas of several nanostructured ZnO films were measured using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (BET). The electronic work function and surface potential of the prepared materials were determined using a scanning Kelvin probe system (SKP370). Steady state surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) was utilized to evaluate the photoelectric properties of electrodes with a homebuilt apparatus, which consisted of a 500 W xenon lamp (CHF XQ500W, China, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China), a double grating monochromator (Zolix SP500), a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP), and a light chopper (SR540). In order to ensure the accurate measurement and a high signal to noise ratio, a special ground wire for the SPS measurement system was made, whose earth resistance was smaller than 4 Ω. The ground wire was connected to the metallic shield of the sample cell and the common ports of the SPS system. For the top and bottom ITO (indium tin oxide) glass in a sandwich structure (see Fig. S1 and S2(a) in the ESI†), only the bottom one was connected to the shield of the sample cell. Electric field induced surface photovoltage spectroscopy (EFISPS) is a technique that combines the electric field effect principle with the SPS method. An external electric field was applied to two sides of the sample, which was regarded as positive when its direction was opposite to that of incident light. The decay of photovoltage was measured with transient surface photovoltage (TSP) spectroscopy. A laser radiation pulse (wavelength of 355 nm and pulse width of 5 ns) from a third harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.) was used to excite the TPV. The signals were registered using a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix) with a preamplifier.
2.3. Characterization of DSSCs
Incident photon-to-current efficiency was obtained from the solar cell spectral response measurement system (QTest Station 1000ADI). A system of the solar simulator (Newport-94043A) was employed to illuminate the solid state solar cells. The short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photovoltage were measured using a digital source-meter (Keithley 2400). In addition, the average overall conversion efficiency (η) is given by η = VocJsc FF/Pin(1)
In eqn (1), Voc, Jsc, and Pin represent the open-circuit photovoltage, short-circuit photocurrent per unit area, and the incident light power (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), respectively. Aside from this, the fill factor FF is determined by FF = VmaxJmax/VocJsc(2)
In eqn (2), Vmax and Jmax represent the voltage and the current per unit area at the maximum output power point, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD patterns and SEM images

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of as-synthesized CBS nanoribbons, which have been reported in our previous work.19 All of the diffraction peaks can be indexed based on the orthorhombic-phase Cu4Bi4S9 (JCPDS File Card No. 77-1238; a = 31.528 Å, b = 11.622 Å, c = 3.951 Å; space group Pbnm (62)). The crystal phases of In2O3 and several nanostructured ZnO films are shown in Fig. 1(b), and the reflection peaks correspond to In2O3 (JCPDS No. 65-3170) and ZnO nanoparticles (JCPDS No. 36-1451), respectively. For three order arrays, XRD peaks can be detected at 2θ of 31.77, 34.42, 36.25 and 62.88 relating to (100), (002), (101) and (103) (JCPDS = 36-1451) planes of ZnO, which can be indexed to a hexagonal wurtzite structure. A predominant ZnO peak at the (002) plane indicates that ZnO order arrays formed along the c-axis were aligned perpendicularly to the surface of the substrate. It is also indicated that In2O3 and several ZnO films can be indexed as well-crystallized structures. However, ZnO nanoparticles exhibit the best crystallinity and ZnO nanowire arrays having the worst. The average crystallite sizes of In2O3, ZnO nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes are estimated from the XRD patterns using Sherrer's equation with their strongest peaks, and the corresponding sizes are about 13, 17, 6, 12 and 10 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) Cu4Bi4S9, (b) In2O3 and ZnO (nanoparticles, nanowire arrays, nanorod arrays and nanotube arrays). 
The SEM, TEM, HRTEM images, atomic percentages (at%) and selected area electron diffraction of as-grown CBS nanoribbons have been reported in our work.19 The surface morphologies of several nanostructured ZnO films are shown in the ESI.† From Fig. S3 (ESI†), it is confirmed that ZnO nanoparticles are homogeneous and the average size is smaller than 100 nm. For three order arrays, they exhibit the highly ordered structures and the average diameters of ZnO nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes are about 30–60 nm, 40–120 nm and 60–120 nm, respectively. The cross-sections of SEM images for two types of heterostructures are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d) and Fig. 3(a)–(d), respectively. As seen, ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 heterostructures are formed by spin-coating of CBS into In2O3 and In2O3 into several ZnO films. It is also shown that CBS nanoribbons protrude clearly above the In2O3 layer and In2O3 clearly above different ZnO layers. There is a same phenomenon for ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 heterostructures that CBS nanoribbons protrude clearly above several ZnO layers. For two types of heterostructures, good contacts between different components have formed.

3.2. Optical absorption spectra
The UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum of as-obtained CBS nanoribbons is shown in the ESI† (see Fig. S4(a)), which has been reported in our previous work.19 CBS nanoribbons present excellent optical absorption in the whole UV-vis range, with an absorption edge at around 1400 nm. The band gap (about 0.88 eV) can be estimated by extrapolating the tangent of the absorption edge to the lateral axis as shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†). The absorption spectra of In2O3, ZnO, ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 are shown in Fig. S4(c) and (d) (ESI†). For one type of heterostructure, the differences of optical absorption with various ZnO films are very small and only one spectrum is shown here. It is also suggested that two types of heterostructures exhibit similar absorption properties with Cu4Bi4S9. But their absorption spectra are not completely consistent with Cu4Bi4S9 and present the characteristics of composite structures. As supplied in the ESI† (see Fig. S5), the variation of (αhν)1/2 and (αhν)2 with the incident photon energy (eV) is shown for In2O3 and ZnO, respectively. According to the equations (αhν)1/2 = A(hν − Eg) (for In2O3)25 and (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg) (for ZnO),26–29 where α is the absorption coefficient, hν the photon energy, A the constant relative to the material, and Eg the absorption band gap, the corresponding band gaps can be estimated to be about 2.7 and 2.9 eV for In2O3 and ZnO, respectively.
3.3. Steady state surface photovoltage
The surface photovoltage (SPV) of Cu4Bi4S9 nanoribbons has been reported in our previous work19 and the spectrum of Cu4Bi4S9 with a thickness of 6.5 μm is shown in Fig. 4(a). As seen, there are two photovoltaic regions, one region from 300–780 nm and the other from 780–1400 nm. It is suggested that CBS exhibits a very broad solar spectrum SPV response. Hence, this material might provide a potential alternative to many existing costly and/or poisonous photovoltaic materials and present obvious advantages as a dye.19,23,24,30,31
 Fig. 4  SPV of (a) Cu4Bi4S9, ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 (ZnO nanoparticles, nanowire arrays, nanorod arrays and nanotube arrays); (b) Cu4Bi4S9, ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 (ZnO nanoparticles, nanowire arrays, nanorod arrays and nanotube arrays); (c) Cu4Bi4S9, ZnO nanotube arrays/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO nanotube arrays/Cu4Bi4S9; and (d) Cu4Bi4S9, ZnO nanoparticle/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9, ZnO nanowire array/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO nanotube array/Cu4Bi4S9. 
The surface photovoltage spectra (phase (θ) = 180°) of Cu4Bi4S9 and two types of heterostructures with different thicknesses are not provided in our paper, and only the SPV peaks (at 483 nm) with different thicknesses are plotted as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). It is indicated that the SPVs of Cu4Bi4S9 and two types of heterostructures enhance linearly with the thickness increasing from 2.0 to 6.5 μm. Above the thickness of 6.5 μm, the peaks decrease slowly. The separation mechanism of photogenerated charges and the charge dynamics were studied systematically based on the thickness of 6.5 μm, as will be described below.

(a) and (b) Thickness of the SPV signal; (c) the synthetic effect of surface area, crystal quality, microstructure, interface barrier, built-in electric field and double energy level matchings on the SPV signal; and (d) positive bias and double energy level matchings to the SPV signal (the illustration: the growth rate versus positive bias). 
For two types of heterostructures with different ZnO microstructures, the enhanced SPV responses with two regions relative to single Cu4Bi4S9 are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). In Fig. 4(a), ZnO nanotube/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 presents the largest SPV (276 μV at 483 nm) and ZnO nanoparticle/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 exhibits the weakest SPV (188 μV at 483 nm). There is a same phenomenon for ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO nanoparticle/Cu4Bi4S9 as shown in Fig. 4(b) with the SPV peaks of 232 and 125 μV at 483 nm, respectively. Moreover, the two SPV response regions with ZnO nanorods and nanotubes have nearly joined together, and the two regions with ZnO nanoparticles and nanowires separate from each other as single Cu4Bi4S9. For the SPVs shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), ZnO nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes have the direct paths, which can facilitate the transport of photogenerated charges. Although ZnO nanotubes do not exhibit the best crystallinity, the largest surface area (70.2 m2 g−1) can promote the adsorption of In2O3 and/or Cu4Bi4S9 and increase the photon utilization efficiency as shown in Table 1. The high SPVs (197 and 242 μV at 483 nm) in two heterostructures with ZnO nanorods can be assigned to the high crystallinity and direct paths, even with the smallest surface area (8.6 m2 g−1). For the low SPVs (156 and 216 μV at 483 nm) with ZnO nanowires, these signals should arise from the bad crystallinity and the small surface area (16.9 m2 g−1). The abundant crystal boundaries and interface barriers result in the weakest SPVs (125 and 188 μV at 483 nm) in two heterostructures with ZnO nanoparticles even having the best crystallinity and the high surface area (52.3 m2 g−1). Besides, the feature for the separation of two SPV regions in several heterostructures with ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO nanowires can also be attributed to these characteristics.

For two SPV spectra as shown in Fig. 4(c), ZnO nanotube/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 presents the higher photovoltaic response than ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 in the whole region of 300–1400 nm. Furthermore, all of ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 exhibit the larger photovoltaic signals than the relative ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). From ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 to ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 as observed in Fig. 5(c), the SPV peaks (at 483 nm) with the same ZnO microstructure increased from 125 to 188 μV, 156 to 216 μV, 197 to 242 μV, and 232 to 276 μV, respectively. It is suggested that the inclusion of In2O3 realized the double energy level matchings between conduction bands (Cu4Bi4S9 and In2O3, In2O3 and ZnO) as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The double energy level matchings can increase the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges and induce the larger surface photovoltage.

Other three different SPV spectra are shown in Fig. 4(d). The signal of ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 is higher than that of ZnO nanoparticle/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 in the whole region of 300–1400 nm with the SPV peaks of 232 and 188 μV, respectively. Although ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 also presents the larger SPV than ZnO nanowire/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9, there is a contrary phenomenon (the latter of 53 μV to the former of 46 μV at 1133 nm) in the region of 900–1400 nm. For ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9, the higher SPV can be assigned to the direct paths and the largest surface area (70.2 m2 g−1). Besides, all of SPV peaks (at 483 nm) versus different ZnO microstructures are also plotted in Fig. 5(c). Two relation curves increase linearly from 125 to 156, 197, 232 μV and from 188 to 216, 242, 276 μV for ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9, respectively. This feature can be attributed to the comprehensive effect of surface area, crystallinity, microstructure, interface barrier, built-in electric field and double energy level matchings. From above SPVs, there is not an obvious extension to the near-infrared region for every heterostructure. However, various SPVs indicate that the separation mechanism of photogenerated charges and the charge dynamics are different.
The measured work functions (Φ) of Cu4Bi4S9, In2O3, ZnO and ITO determined using a scanning Kelvin probe system are presented in Table 2. It is shown that the electronic work function of CBS is smaller than those of In2O3, ZnO and ITO, and the electronic work functions of In2O3 and ITO are smaller than that of ZnO. For ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 as shown in Fig. 6(a), there are contacts between CBS and ITO, CBS and In2O3, In2O3 and ZnO, ZnO and ITO, and the free electrons will transfer from CBS to ITO, CBS to In2O3, In2O3 to ZnO, ITO to ZnO, respectively. Therefore, the rectifying contact between CBS and ITO has a built-in electric field with the direction from CBS to ITO, and the ohmic contact between ZnO and ITO has a built-in electric field with the direction from ITO to ZnO in the surface space charge region (SCR).14–19,32,33 Moreover, there are two heterojunctions between CBS and In2O3, In2O3 and ZnO with the direction of built-in electric fields from CBS to In2O3 and In2O3 to ZnO, respectively.14–19,32,33 Due to the In2O3 thin buffer layer, the two built-in electric fields at an internal interface are weak, with the low heights relative to the Schottky barrier. For ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 as shown in Fig. 6(b), the contacts between CBS and ITO, CBS and ZnO, ZnO and ITO will lead to the free electrons shifting from CBS to ITO, CBS to ZnO, and ITO to ZnO, respectively. The rectifying contact between CBS and ITO and the ohmic contact between ZnO and ITO have the same direction of built-in electric fields as shown in Fig. 6(a). Meanwhile, the heterojunction between CBS and ZnO has a direction of built-in electric field from CBS to ZnO.14–19,32,33 Due to three types of contacts, there are interface barriers in SCRs. Under illumination without bias, the changing interface barrier results in the photovoltaic response.

In order to determine the separation mechanism of photogenerated charges and the charge dynamics in two types of heterostructures, we have measured the surface potentials (Φ0) of Cu4Bi4S9, In2O3 and ZnO (with the same thickness as in two types of heterostructures), and the corresponding values are about 0.16, 0.09 and 0.12 eV, respectively. Several nanostructured ZnO films have the similar surface potential, and the differences are not shown here. According to the following equation:34 χ = Φ − Φ0(3)the calculated electron affinities (χ) are shown in Table 2. For ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9, the barrier between CBS and ZnO is about 0.41 eV with a direct contact considering the surface band bending. This high potential will evidently hinder the transport of photogenerated charges. It is shown that the conduction band edge of In2O3 is in the middle of the conduction bands of CBS and ZnO, which can establish the double energy level matchings. The two heterojunctions between CBS and In2O3, and In2O3 and ZnO have the potential differences of 0.23 and 0.27 eV, respectively, and the low barriers do not markedly impede the transport of photoinduced charges between different components. Therefore, the double energy level matchings result in a high separation efficiency of photogenerated charges even with more contact barriers as shown in Fig. 6(a). In Fig. 4(a)–(d), all of ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 exhibit the higher SPVs and more obvious amalgamation between two response regions than the relative ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9, which can demonstrate the effect of double energy level matchings. For ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9, the high barrier (about 0.41 eV) between CBS and ZnO and the bad overlapping of wave functions will impede the separation of photogenerated charges and induce the weak SPV as shown in Fig. 6(b).14–19
3.4. Transient surface photovoltage
In our work, the optical band-gaps of In2O3, ZnO and CBS are about 2.7, 2.9 and 0.88 eV, respectively, and excitation of illumination under 355 nm (photon energy hν = 3.5 eV, pulse strength = 0.2 mJ per pulse) can lead to the band-to-band transition. For the sign of TSP, the positive signal implies that the top electrode has the more positive voltage than the bottom electrode. On the contrary, the TSP exhibits the negative signal.35–44 For ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9, the Pt screen electrode was first illuminated by a pulsed laser as shown in the ESI† (see Fig. S2(b)), and there are two separation processes of photogenerated charges as seen in Fig. 7(a). The first process is a negative signal with a response time of 4 × 10−6 s, and the second process is a positive signal with a response time of 3 × 10−3 s. It is known that the drift process is quicker for several orders than diffusion, suggesting that the first is drift and the second is diffusion.44,45 In our work, the interface contact between the Pt electrode and CBS can be ignored. Besides, the CBS layer was directly deposited onto In2O3 and there is no obvious difference of state density between the surface and inside. The effect of the surface state for the CBS layer can only generate a weak process and also be ignored. However, the two built-in electric fields between CBS and In2O3, and In2O3 and ZnO will facilitate the transport of holes from CBS to In2O3 and to ZnO, and electrons from ZnO to In2O3 and to CBS. Because the two contacts are of internal interfaces, the optical absorption is weak and the photogenerated electrons can easily combine with holes in the long transport process. Therefore, the first process exhibits a weaker and slower signal than the reported studies.40–42 Meanwhile, the diffusion of electrons and holes from the surface to inside under the concentration gradient induces the second process as shown in Fig. 7(a).45,46 For the second process, all of ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 exhibit the same response time and heterojunctions with ZnO arrays presenting the higher signal than that with ZnO nanoparticles. It is known that ZnO arrays having the direct paths will promote the transport of charges and enhance the TSP response. However, three ZnO arrays grown on ZnO-seeded layers will also hinder the transfer of charges and not evidently change the response time. Second, the laser illuminated from the ITO electrode as shown in the ESI† (see Fig. S2(c)), and there are also two separation processes of photogenerated charges as seen in Fig. 7(b). The first process is a negative signal with a response time of 5 × 10−7 s and the second process is a positive signal with a response time of 6 × 10−5 s. Due to the ohmic contact between ZnO and ITO with a direction of a built-in electric field from ITO to ZnO, the photogenerated electrons will quickly transfer to the ITO electrode and holes to inside, which results in the first negative signal. Besides, the photogenerated electrons and holes will diffuse from the surface to inside under the concentration gradient. Meanwhile, the electrons will also drift to inside and holes to ITO under two built-in electric fields of internal interface. Therefore, the second process is a comprehensive effect of drift and diffusion. In the first process, it is also shown that all of heterojunctions exhibit the same response time and heterojunctions with ZnO arrays present the higher signal than that with ZnO nanoparticles. The separation process and intensity can also be attributed to the direct paths of ZnO arrays and ZnO-seeded layers.

For ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9, the laser first illuminated from the Pt electrode as shown in the ESI† (see Fig. S2(b)), and there are two separation processes of photogenerated charges as seen in Fig. 7(c). The first process is a negative signal with a response time of 4 × 10−6 s and the second process is a positive signal with a response time of 3 × 10−3 s. The relevant surface state and interface contact can also be ignored per the interpretation shown in Fig. 7(a). It is shown that there are the same separation processes and response times for two types of heterojunctions as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (c), and the separation mechanism is not shown here. Due to the differences of structures and built-in electric fields in two types of heterojunctions, ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 presents the higher TSP response than ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9. Second, the laser illuminated from the ITO electrode as shown in the ESI† (see Fig. S2(c)), and there are also two separation processes of photogenerated charges as seen in Fig. 7(d). The first process is a negative signal with a response time of 5 × 10−7 s and the second process is a positive signal with a response time of 6 × 10−5 s. It is also shown that there are the same separation processes and response times in two types of heterojunctions as seen in Fig. 7(b) and (d). The first process exhibits the same TSP intensity due to the ohmic contact. However, the higher second signal in ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 can be attributed to the more built-in electric fields and stronger effects on the transport of charges. The second process shown in Fig. 7(d) is also the comprehensive effect of drift and diffusion in ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9.
3.5. Electric field-induced surface photovoltage

Fig. 8(a)–(d) show the SPV responses of Cu4Bi4S9 and three heterojunctions under a positive bias, respectively. As seen, CBS and three heterostructures all present the increased photovoltaic response and weak red-shift; that is to say, the positive bias enhanced the effect of built-in electric field. In Fig. 6(a), the bias exhibits the same direction as two built-in electric fields of rectifying and ohmic contacts, and with the opposite direction as two built-in electric fields of internal interface. The external electric field will promote holes to ITO and electrons to inside at the rectifying interface, and electrons shifting to ITO and holes to inside at the ohmic interface, which induces higher SPVs as shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c). Meanwhile, the bias will weaken the two built-in electric fields between CBS and In2O3, and In2O3 and ZnO. Moreover, the photogenerated charges in two internal interfaces have a high recombination rate due to the long transport process. Therefore, the two internal interface effects can be ignored. As seen in Fig. 6(b), the bias also exhibits the same direction as two built-in electric fields of rectifying and ohmic contacts, and with the opposite direction as one built-in electric field of internal interface. The external electric field will also promote holes to ITO and electrons to inside at the rectifying interface, and electrons shifting to ITO and holes to inside at the ohmic interface, which generates higher SPVs as shown in Fig. 8(d). Similarly, the bias will weaken the effect of built-in electric field between CBS and ZnO and there is also a high recombination rate of photogenerated charges at the transport process. With the bias increasing, there is a stronger effect on the photogenerated charges and a higher SPV signal than before. All of the weak red-shifts observed in Fig. 8(a)–(d) can be attributed to the Franz–Keldysh effect. For a sample under an external field, the electrons in the valence band can be excited to the conduction band by a photon with smaller energy than the band gap due to the Franz–Keldysh effect.34 On the other hand, the negative bias exhibits the opposite direction as two built-in electric fields of rectifying and ohmic contacts, and with the same direction as one or two built-in electric fields of internal interface. Although the bias can enhance the effect of built-in electric fields of internal interface, there is a high recombination rate of photogenerated charges in the long transport process. The separation efficiency of photogenerated charges cannot be increased under a negative bias, which will induce the weak SPV. These results are not our focus of research and hence are not shown here.

In order to further specify the charge dynamics under a positive bias, we have compared the SPVs of three heterojunctions as shown in Fig. 8(b)–(d). As seen, ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 exhibits the higher SPV than ZnO nanowire/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 under the bias lower than 1.0 V. Similarly, ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 presents the better SPV than ZnO nanoparticle/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 as the bias lower than 1.5 V. However, ZnO nanowire/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO nanoparticle/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 all have the higher SPV than ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 in the whole region of 300–1400 nm with the bias larger than 1.0 V and 1.5 V, respectively. For the increasing SPV, the peaks (at 483 nm) versus bias are plotted as shown in Fig. 5(d). As seen, the values increase linearly from 188 to 482 μV, 216 to 496 μV and 232 to 459 μV for three heterojunctions, respectively. Moreover, we have also calculated the increasing rates of peaks under the bias of 0.5 V (1.0, 1.5 and 2 V) to zero. Three relationship curves with rates to bias are shown in the illustration of Fig. 5(d), and the increasing rates of ZnO nanoparticle/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 and ZnO nanowire/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 are larger than that of ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9. Despite the better SPV in ZnO nanotube/Cu4Bi4S9 under low bias, the increased bias will have a stronger effect on the separation of photogenerated charges due to the double energy level matchings. These characteristics further demonstrated the comprehensive effect of double energy level matchings and other factors on the separation of photogenerated charges. For the double energy level matchings, we can explain their actual function from the “inverted region effect”. When the conduction band of one material has a closer space with that of another, the corresponding overlapping area of wave functions will enhance, which can promote the separation of photogenerated charges as shown in the ESI† (see Fig. S6).14–19,47–51
3.6. 
          I–V characteristics of DSSCs
The I–V characteristics of two types of solid state solar cells were measured under illumination using a sun simulator at AM 1.5. From Tables 3 and 4, it is shown that two types of solar cells all present the superior photoelectric properties and ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 cells exhibit the better performances than ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 cells. The overall light-to-electricity efficiencies of ZnO/In2O3/Cu4Bi4S9 cells with ZnO nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes are 5.2%, 6.0%, 6.2% and 6.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, ZnO/Cu4Bi4S9 cells with ZnO nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes have the efficiencies of 4.7%, 5.4%, 5.6% and 6.2%, respectively. It is suggested that the performances of cells present the same characteristics as the SPVs of heterojunctions, which can further corroborate the analysis about the separation and transport of photogenerated charges.

In our work, ZnO, especially with a 1D nanostructure, has a high electron mobility, high surface area and high optical stability. In2O3 is a transparent oxide semiconductor and often used as a transparent electrode in optoelectronic devices. Besides, CBS nanoribbons exhibit the excellent optical absorption and surface photovoltaic properties in reported studies.18,19 For two types of heterojunctions and DSSCs, the optimized combinations with ZnO as a photoanode, In2O3 as a buffer layer and CBS as an inorganic dye have shown the superior photoelectric properties and should present the potential application in the photovoltaic community.
4. Conclusions
From the qualitative and quantitative analysis of SPS, TSP and EFISPS signals, the SPV can be attributed to the comprehensive effect of main factors. As shown, film thickness exhibits a direct effect on the surface photovoltage. Besides, the interface barrier at crystal boundary, rectifying contact and heterojunction will impede the transport of photogenerated charges, but the built-in electric field and good energy level matching can promote the separation of photogenerated charges. For one type of heterostructure, the larger surface area and direct paths can enhance light harvesting and facilitate the transport of charges, and the bad crystallinity will hinder the separation of photogenerated charges. The obtained efficiencies of our cells present the same characteristics as the SPVs of heterojunctions, further corroborating the separation and transport mechanism of photogenerated charges. The optimized combination of heterojunctions with high performances in our work should present the potential application in the photovoltaic community.
