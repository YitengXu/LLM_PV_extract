    , Accepted 2nd October 2014First published on 10th October 2014AbstractIn this paper we report two DPP-based conjugated molecules DPPBT and DPPTT in which the respective electron withdrawing moieties 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole are flanked by two DPP moieties. For comparison, DPPBZ containing 1,4-diethynylbenzene and two DPP moieties were synthesized. HOMO/LUMO energies of DPPBT, DPPTT and DPPBZ were estimated on the basis of cyclic voltammetric data. Owing to the fact that LUMO energies of DPPBT and DPPTT were lowered to ca. −3.5 eV, thin films of both DPPBT and DPPTT exhibit ambipolar semiconducting properties under N2 atmosphere with hole and electron mobilities up to 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In comparison, thin film of DPPBZ just shows p-type semiconducting property. Notably, ambipolar semiconductors with relatively high carrier mobility are rarely reported for DPP-containing small conjugated molecules. Alternatively, both DPPBT and DPPTT can function as electron donors for photovoltaic materials. Thin films of DPPTT:PC71BM and DPPBT:PC71BM at a weight ratio of 1:1 exhibit PCEs of 4.18% and 2.44%, respectively, with VOC higher than 0.95 V.
Introduction
In recent years, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and its analogues, such as dithienyl-DPP, have been widely incorporated into conjugated molecules and polymers as electron accepting moieties for organic optoelectronic materials.1–3 This is because of its unique π-conjugated system, high optical density and exceptional stability.4 A number of DPP-based conjugated molecules and polymers were designed and prepared for organic semiconductors with high carrier-mobilities and organic photovoltaic materials with high power conversion efficiencies.1–5 For instance, conjugated polymer P1 (Scheme 1) derived from dithienyl-DPP and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene was reported to behave as p-type semiconductor with hole mobility up to 10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.5a However, polymer P2 (Scheme 1) entailing dithienyl-DPP and selenophene moieties in the conjugated backbone behaved as an ambipolar semiconductor with hole and electron mobilities higher than 4.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.5b Low band-gap conjugated polymers P3 and P4 (Scheme 1) were successfully utilized as electron donors for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 7.0%.5c However, conjugated polymers have batch-to-batch variation in terms of molecular weight and polydispersity that will affect the processability, microstructure, and thus semiconducting performances.6–11
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of representative DPP-containing conjugated polymers and small molecules. 
In comparison, conjugated molecules are advantageous over conjugated polymers; they can be more easily functionalized and purified, thus device reproducibility can be improved. In addition, small conjugated molecules tend to self-assemble into ordered domains and their intermolecular arrangements can be clarified by crystal structural analysis.12–19 Consequently, structure–property correlations can be investigated. Therefore, small conjugated molecules have attracted increasing interests in recent years.20,21Scheme 1 shows several small conjugated molecules S1, S2 and S3 derived from dithienyl-DPP.21 They all were investigated as electron donors to fabricate OPVs after blending with either [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). For instance, PCE up to 5.79% was reported for the blending thin film of S3 with PC71BM as the active layer of the solar cell.21c Moreover, the semiconducting properties of their thin films were examined by the fabrication of the field effect transistors; they all behaved as p-type semiconductors with rather low hole mobilities.
It is known that ambipolar semiconductors are highly demanding for the fabrication of organic circuits.22 However, ambipolar semiconductors with carrier mobilities higher than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 were seldom reported for DPP-based small conjugated molecules.23 This is probably because of the fact that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of DPP is relatively high; for instance, the LUMO energy level of dithienyl-DPP was estimated to be −3.29 eV. The efficient approach to lower the LUMO energy is to incorporate additional electron withdrawing moieties into the DPP-based conjugated molecules. In this paper, we report two DPP-based conjugated molecules DPPBT and DPPTT (Scheme 2) entailing additional electron accepting moieties, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT)5e and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TT),20b–d respectively. Both BT and TT are flanked by two DPP moieties and connected by acetylene bonds. For comparison, DPPBZ containing 1,4-diethynylbenzene and two DPP moieties were synthesized. The results reveal that LUMO energies of DPPBT and DPPTT are lowered to ca. −3.50 eV, and they both exhibit ambipolar semiconducting behaviour with hole and electron mobilities up to 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPPTT, 0.045 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPPBT. In comparison, a thin film of DPPBZ just shows p-type semiconducting property. Furthermore, both DPPBT and DPPTT show strong absorptions in the visible region and they can be utilized as photovoltaic materials as electron donors. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the blending thin film of DPPTT:PC71BM reaches 4.18% under standard condition.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of DPPBT, DPPTT and DPPBZ is shown in Scheme 3. The Sonogashira coupling of 1, which was synthesized according to the reported procedures,21b with ethynyltrimethylsilane afforded compound 2 in 90% yield. The removal of TMS group in 2 led to 3, which was allowed to react with 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 2,5-dibromothiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole to obtain DPPBT and DPPTT in 81% and 75% yields, respectively. Chemical structures of DPPBT and DPPTT were characterized with NMR and MS data and their purities were confirmed with elemental analysis. For comparison, DPPBZ (Scheme 3) in which two DPP moieties are connected by 1,4-diethynylbenzene was synthesized and fully characterized. On the basis of the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data shown in Fig. S1,† the thermal decomposition (at 5% weight loss) temperatures of DPPBT and DPPTT were higher than 350 °C. On the basis of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data (see Fig. S1†), broad phase transitions around 215 °C were observed for DPPTT and DPPBZ, whereas DPPBT displayed relatively sharp transition around 220 °C. Thus, it may be concluded that solid samples of DPPTT and DPPBZ show low crystallinity.

HOMO/LUMO energies
The cyclic voltammograms of DPPBT and DPPTT, as well as DPPBZ were measured as shown in Fig. 1. Both DPPBT and DPPTT displayed two quasi-reversible oxidation waves and two reversible reduction waves. Compared to DPPBZ, the reduction waves of DPPBT and DPPTT were slightly positively shifted (see Fig. 1). This is obviously due to the respective electron withdrawing effects of BT and TT in DPPBT and DPPTT. Based on their onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of DPPBT, DPPTT and DPPBZ were estimated by the following equations and listed in Table 1: LUMO = −(Eonsetred1 + 4.41) eV, HOMO = −(Eonsetox1 + 4.41) eV. The LUMO levels of DPPBT and DPPTT were lowered and HOMO levels were enhanced in comparison with those of DPPBZ. Moreover, DPPBT and DPPTT exhibited narrower bandgaps (∼1.6 eV) than DPPBZ. HOMO/LUMO levels of DPPBT and DPPTT may enable them to behave as ambipolar semiconductors according to previous reports.24

Fig. 2 and S2† show the absorption spectra of the solutions and thin films of DPPBT, DPPTT and DPPBZ. DPPBT in solution strongly absorbed around 590 nm (εmax = 130000 cm2 M−1) with broad full width of 120 nm at a half maximum, whereas DPPTT in solution showed three absorptions around 420 (εmax = 51000 cm2 M−1), 580 (εmax = 122000 cm2 M−1) and 610 nm (εmax = 127000 cm2 M−1). In comparison, the absorption spectra of thin films of DPPBT and DPPTT were red-shifted as displayed in Fig. 2; they show strong absorptions around 620 nm and the absorption tails were extended to ca. 850 nm. This may be due to the intermolecular π–π interactions. The respective optical bandgaps of DPPBT and DPPTT were estimated to be 1.60 eV and 1.62 eV on the basis of their onset absorptions. The optical band gaps were in good agreement with those determined with cyclic voltammetric data (see Table 1).
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of DPPBT and DPPTT in CHCl3 (1.0 × 10−5 M) solutions (a) and their thin films (b). 
The fact that both DPPBT and DPPTT show strong absorptions in the visible region with high molar absorption coefficients and narrow bandgaps may allow them to be used as photovoltaic materials. Scheme 2 demonstrates the HOMO/LUMO levels of DPPBT and DPPTT and those of PC71BM. Judging from the energy levels, both DPPBT and DPPTT are suitable as electron donors in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Moreover, the energy differences between the HOMO levels of DPPBT and DPPTT and the LUMO level of PC71BM were higher than 1.2 eV, thus high open-circuit voltages (VOC) are expected for OPVs with DPPBT and DPPTT as donors after combining with PC71BM as the acceptor.
Ambipolar semiconducting properties
In order to investigate the semiconducting behaviors of DPPBT and DPPTT, as well as DPPBZ, the respective bottom-gate/bottom-contact organic field effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated with conventional techniques (see Experimental section). On the basis of the respective transfer and output characteristics shown in Fig. 3 and S3,† it can be concluded that the thin films of DPPBT and DPPTT show ambipolar semiconducting properties under N2 atmosphere, whereas thin film of DPPBZ behaves as p-type semiconductor (Fig. S4†). This agrees well with the HOMO/LUMO energies of DPPBT and DPPTT, as well as DPPBZ. The LUMO energies of DPPBT and DPPTT need to be further lowered in order to yield air-stable ambipolar semiconductors.
 Fig. 3  Transfer characteristics (measured under N2 atmosphere) of OFETs based on DPPBT and DPPTT after thermal annealing at 100 °C. 
The performance data of OFETs based on thin films of DPPBT and DPPTT, as well as DPPBZ before and after thermal annealing are summarized in Table 2. The μh and μe of the as-prepared OFET with thin film of DPPTT were measured to be 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.0012 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Notably, both μh and μe increased to 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.090 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, after annealing at 100 °C for 1.0 h. However, μh and μe started to decrease after further annealing at higher temperature. Similar trend was observed for thin film of DPPBT, and μh and μe reached 0.045 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, after thermal annealing at 100 °C for 1 h. The Ion/off is relatively high for the hole conducting channel, whereas it is low for the electron conducting channel. It should be noted that DPP-based small conjugated molecules exhibiting ambipolar semiconducting behaviors with relatively balanced μh/μe are rarely reported. In comparison, DPPBZ was found to show only p-type semiconducting properties under the same condition. The hole mobility for thin film of DPPBZ increased to 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at 100 °C for 1 h (see Table 2).

Thin films of DPPBT and DPPTT, as well as DPPBZ before and after thermal annealing were characterized with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and atomic force microscope (AFM). As depicted in Fig. S5,† no sharp diffraction peaks were detected for their thin films even after thermal annealing in both in-plane and out-of-plane modes. Thus, their thin films show poor crystallinity. In the out-of-plane mode, broad and weak diffraction signals around 20° were detected for the thin films of DPPBT and DPPTT, as well as DPPBZ. This may be because of the weak intermolecular π–π interactions within the thin films. In particular, the intensity of the diffraction signal around 7° was slightly enhanced for thin film of DPPTT after thermal annealing at 100 °C. This may partially explain the observation that both hole and electron mobilities increase after thermal annealing.

Fig. 4 shows the AFM images of thin-films of DPPBT and DPPTT on n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified SiO2 substrates before and after annealing at 100 °C. Heights and sizes of molecular domains within thin films of DPPBT and DPPTT were not significantly altered after thermal annealing. The root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) was changed from 0.324 nm to 0.433 nm for DPPBT and 0.525 nm to 0.635 nm for DPPTT. This may be due to the partial crystallization of molecules of DPPBT and DPPTT within their thin films after thermal annealing. For thin film of DPPBZ, obvious morphological variation occurred and large molecular domains were formed after thermal annealing (see Fig. S6†).

Electron donors for photovoltaic materials
Judging from their LUMO/HOMO levels (see Scheme 2), DPPBT and DPPTT may function as electron donors for photovoltaic materials as discussed above. In fact, the blending thin films DPPBT:PC71PM and DPPTT:PC71PM exhibited broad absorptions in the region of 340–760 nm with absorption maxima at 620 nm and 600 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. S7.† Blending thin films of DPPBT/DPPTT with PC71BM in different weight ratios were employed as active layers for the fabrication of OPVs with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al. The respective photovoltaic performance data based on the curves shown in Fig. 5 are summarized in Table 3. The blending thin films of both DPPBT:PC71BM and DPPTT:PC71BM exhibited best photovoltaic performance at 1:1 weight ratio. The DPPBT:PC71BM thin film led to a maximum PCE of 2.44%, whereas the PCE for the DPPTT:PC71BM thin film could reach 4.18%. These OPVs displayed relatively high open-circuit voltage (VOC) up to 0.99 V, but the respective short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) were not high (see Table 3). These can be enhanced by improving the order of degree of intermolecular arrangements and electron donor–acceptor interfacial structures. Thermal annealing or introduction of additives could not obviously improve the photovoltaic performances for the blending thin films of DPPBT and DPPTT with PC71BM under current device configuration.

As depicted in Fig. 5, the blending thin films of both DPPBT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) and DPPTT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) display broad IPCE (incident photon to converted current efficiency) spectra from 300 to 750 nm. These IPCE spectra correspond well to the respective UV/vis absorption profiles (Fig. S2 and S7†). The monochromatic IPCEs reach 32% at 593 nm for DPPBT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) and 37% at 595 nm for DPPTT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w).
The blending thin films of DPPBT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) and DPPTT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) were characterized with GIXRD and AFM. No sharp diffraction signals were detected for both the blending thin films in both in-plane and out-of-plane modes (see Fig. S8†), indicating the order degree of intermolecular arrangements is low for both the blending thin films. Broad weak diffraction peaks from 16° to 28° and from 13° to 22° were detected for the DPPBT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w) thin film in the respective out-of-plane and in-plane modes. Similar broad diffraction peaks were observed for the blending thin film of DPPTT:PC71BM (1:1, w/w). These weak diffraction peaks may implicate the existence of intermolecular π–π interactions within the thin films, which are beneficial for improving the photovoltaic performances.

Fig. 6 shows AFM height and phase images of the blending films of DPPBT/DPPTT with PC71BM (1:1, w/w) without any post-treatments. The blending film of DPPBT:PC71BM exhibits crystalline domains and smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.437 nm. Moreover, the phase contrast was not obvious from the respective phase image. However, For DPPTT:PC71BM blending thin film, spherical crystalline domains with sizes of ∼1700 nm2 were detected and RMS roughness was measured to be 0.966 nm. The phase image indicates the separation of donor and acceptor domains. Therefore, these AFM images were in good agreement with the observation that the blending thin film of DPPTT:PC71BM shows better photovoltaic performance than that of DPPBT:PC71BM (see Table 3).

Conclusions
Two DPP-based conjugated molecules DPPBT and DPPTT were designed and synthesized. DPPBT and DPPTT entail the electron withdrawing moieties 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TT), respectively, and the conjugated moieties are connected with acetylene bonds. The LUMO energies of DPPBT and DPPTT were lowered to −3.51 eV and −3.56 eV, respectively, on the basis of the cyclic voltammetric data. Both DPPBT and DPPTT strongly absorb in the visible region with relatively narrow optical gaps. The thin films of both DPPBT and DPPTT exhibited ambipolar semiconducting properties under N2 atmosphere with hole and electron mobilities up to 0.045 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPPBT, and 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPPTT based on the characterization of the respective OFETs. In comparison, a thin film of DPPBZ, which contains no electron accepting moiety just shows p-type semiconducting property. In addition, DPPBT and DPPTT can function as electron donors for photovoltaic materials in paring with PC71BM based on the consideration of their HOMO/LUMO energies and strong absorptions in the visible region. The thin films of DPPTT:PC71BM and DPPBT:PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:1 exhibit a PCEs of 4.18% and 2.44% with VOC higher than 0.95 V, respectively. X-ray diffraction and AFM studies reveal that the thin films of DPPTT:PC71BM and DPPBT:PC71BM show low order degree of intermolecular arrangements, and further studies to tune the intermolecular arrangements and thin film morphologies are under way.

Fabrication of OFET devices
Bottom contact OFETs were fabricated. A heavily doped n-type Si wafer and a layer of dry oxidized SiO2 (300 nm, with roughness lower than 0.1 nm and a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2) were used as a gate electrode and gate dielectric layer, respectively. The drain–source (D–S) gold contacts were fabricated by photolithography. The substrates were cleaned using deionized water, alcohol, and rinsed in acetone. Then, the surface was modified with n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). Next, the substrates were cleaned in n-hexane and CHCl3. The system was stirred for 60 min and the substrates were washed with EtOH. DPPBT, DPPTT and DPPBZ were dissolved in CHCl3 (about 10 mg mL−1) and spin-coated on the surface of the substrates at 2000 rpm. The annealing process was carried out in vacuum for 1 h at each annealing temperature. Field-effect characteristics of the devices were determined in nitrogen using a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer.
The mobility of the OFETs in the saturation region was calculated using the following equation:  where IDS is the drain electrode collected current; L and W are the channel length and width, respectively; μ is the mobility of the device; Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer; VGS is the gate voltage, and Vth is the threshold voltage. The Vth of the device was determined by extrapolating the (IDS,sat)1/2vs. VGS plot to IDS = 0.
Fabrication of organic photovoltaic cells
OPVs were fabricated with ITO as the positive electrode and Al as the negative electrode. The patterned tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropyl alcohol and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 30 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, a chloroform solution of DPPBT or DPPTT with PC71BM was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form the active layer. The thickness (ca. 80–100 nm) of the active layer was measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Then, a Ca (ca. 20 nm) and aluminium layer (ca. 70 nm) were evaporated onto the surface of the active layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4.0 mm2. The J–V curves were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra was measured using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp.
