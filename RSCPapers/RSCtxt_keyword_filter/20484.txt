    , Accepted 14th December 2015First published on 14th December 2015AbstractWe report the photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of methanol on a rationally designed graphene-TiO2 nanorod array (G-TNR) photoanode. A PEC methanol fuel cell was constructed by coupling the G-TNR photoanode with a cathode. This study raises a conceptual fuel cell that realizes the synergistic energy conversion of chemical energy and solar energy.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cells1–7 using sunlight as the energy input is a promising strategy to deal with both environmental pollution and energy crises. PEC fuel cells are mainly composed of a semiconductor photoanode, a cathode, and an electrolyte that contains organic fuels (such as glucose, alcohol, methanol, and formic acid). Upon light illumination, the semiconductor on the anode can generate a large number of electron–hole pairs. The holes can efficiently oxidize organic fuels at the photoanode, whereas the electrons can be transferred to the cathode, wherein oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs. Taking this advantage, a PEC fuel cell can convert chemical energy to electricity in an efficient manner with the assistance of sunlight.
The photocatalyst plays a crucial role because it determines the energy conversion efficiency of a PEC fuel cell. To photocatalytically oxidize the fuels, efforts have been made to find efficient photocatalysts for the photoanode. Metal oxide semiconductors, such as WO3,8 SnO2,9 ZnO,10–12 BiVO4,13 and TiO2,11,12,14,15 have been investigated intensively due to their appropriate band gap, low electrical resistance, low cost, and easy production.12 Among these photocatalysts, TiO2 has unique advantages of excellent photocatalytic activity, and high chemical and photochemical stability.11,12,14–17 Unfortunately, the use of TiO2 has been limited largely by its low absorbance of visible light, rapid charge recombination and low charge transfer efficiency during the PEC process. To solve the abovementioned problems, several strategies, such as coupling TiO2 with other semiconductors,11,12 deposition of noble metal as co-catalysts,15,18 doping elements,19,20 and dye sensitization,21 have been reported.
It is known that the morphology and structure of TiO2 can affect its photocatalytic performance. In particular, TiO2 nanorods, with a one-dimension (1D) structure, has shown unique advantages in photocatalytic applications because a 1D structure could offer direct pathways for photo-generated electron transfer, which can enhance the efficiency of charge separation.12,22–24 Furthermore, 1D structured catalysts possess larger active surface-to-volume ratio,22,24 which can facilitate the photocatalytic reaction in the electrolyte. On the other hand, graphene is regarded as a competitive host substance for the growth of TiO2 owing to its large surface area, superior electrical conductivity, high optical transmittance, and excellent mechanical stability.25–27 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the preparation of TiO2 nanorods modified graphene and its photocatalytic performance, especially for its application as a photoanode of PEC fuel cell.
In this study, we demonstrate the design and synthesis of the TiO2 nanorods modified graphene (G-TNRs) as a novel structured photocatalyst. The G-TNRs modified electrode was used as a photoanode of PEC fuel cells. The prepared G-TNRs exhibited significantly enhanced activities towards the photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of methanol. To construct a methanol fuel cell, the 3D interpenetrating nanostructured graphene nanosheets-carbon nanotube (GN–CNT) hybrid was prepared according to a previous study and used as a cathode for oxygen reduction.28 With this novel PEC fuel cell configuration, electricity was extracted successfully using methanol fuel. We noted that, although direct methanol fuel cell based on noble metal catalysts was investigated, we demonstrate a novel concept of a PEC methanol fuel cell based on a photoanode using sunlight as a synergistic energy input. We believe that this study not only offers insights into the design of functional materials with controllable properties for electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, but also provides new energy technology for realizing synergistic energy conversion of chemical energy and solar energy.

Fig. 1 shows the working principle of the proposed PEC fuel cell. Upon illumination, electrons were excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, whereas photogenerated holes were generated at the VB of TiO2. Different from the traditional electrocatalytic oxidation mechanism, methanol was used as an electron donor and successfully oxidized by the photogenerated holes (detailed reaction mechanism has been described in the ESI†). Photogenerated electrons were transported quickly by graphene and flowed to the cathode through an external circuit, wherein oxygen was efficiently reduced.

The morphology of GO, TiO2 nanorods (TNRs) and G-TNRs was characterized by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. S1A (ESI†), the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets was smooth and clean. For comparison, after the hydrothermal process, evenly distributed and upstanding modified nanorods were clearly observed on the surface of the RGO sheets (Fig. 2A), indicating the successful combination of TiO2 with RGO. In addition, all the TiO2 nanorods observed on the surface of the RGO sheets exhibited uniform lengths (ca. 250 nm) and diameters (ca. 40 nm), as displayed in the inset in Fig. 2A. For comparison, pure TNRs were also prepared and collected on ITO following the same preparation procedures, as shown in Fig. S1B (ESI†). Because the TNRs were grown on a flat ITO substrate, these rods were vertically upward. Fig. 2B shows a TEM image of G-TNRs, revealing clearly the morphology of the nanorods. The inset in Fig. 2B shows a well-crystallized structure with a fringe spacing of 0.32 nm corresponding well to that of the lattice space of (110) of rutile TiO2, which is consistent with the highly symmetric selected area electron diffraction pattern (Fig. S2, ESI†).

The crystalline structure of the synthesized composites was analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S3A, ESI†). The strong XRD peak at 27.4° indicated that the TiO2 nanorods were highly crystallized with a primary rutile phase. Moreover, the XRD peak at 10.5° of GO disappeared for the G-TNRs sample, indicating that GO had been successfully reduced after calcination.24 Furthermore, the Raman spectra of GO, G-TNRs and TNRs are displayed in Fig. 2C. In general, the D (near 1300 cm−1) and G (near 1500 cm−1) peaks are the characteristic peaks of a carbon crystal. The intensity ratio of the D peak to that of the G peak (ID/IG) indicates the degree of disorder from the graphite structure. It is obvious that G-TNTs had an increased ID/IG of 0.98, compared to that of GO 0.79. In other words, GO was simultaneously reduced during the preparation of rutile TiO2 nanorods. For the G-TNRs and TNRs, the peaks at 130, 255, 490, and 610 cm−1 should be attributed to rutile TiO2.29 The intensity of these peaks for the G-TNRs composite decreased slightly compared to TNRs, which should be attributed to the interaction between TiO2 and graphene.
The high resolution C 1s XPS spectra of G-TNRs are shown in Fig. 2D. Three types of carbon bonds at 284.5 eV, 286.7 eV and 288.5 eV of GO (Fig. S3B, ESI†) were assigned to C–C, C–O, and CO–O, respectively. Owing to the loss of oxygen-containing functional groups in the G-TNRs, the intensity of the peak at 286.7 eV and 288.5 eV tended to be low. In particular, the intensity of the peak for C–O in G-TNRs was sharply reduced, indicating the successful reduction of GO and the combination of TiO2 with RGO.24,30 It can be noted that this observation is in accordance with the FTIR spectra (Fig. S3C, ESI†). For GO, a number of oxygenated groups, such as C–O (1069 cm−1), C–O–C (1384 cm−1) and CO (1730 cm−1),31,32 was observed. However, for G-TNRs, some oxygenated groups almost vanished and the peak intensities of the remaining oxygenated groups were apparently decreased. The absorption peak at 719 cm−1 can be assigned to Ti–O–Ti of TiO2. The Ti–O–Ti of G-TNRs was shifted to a lower wavelength of 663 cm−1. According to a previously reported study, this shift was caused by the interaction between graphene and TNRs.24
The UV-vis absorption spectra for the pure TNRs and G-TNRs composites are shown in Fig. 3A. Pure TNRs showed a 3.0 eV (410 nm) rutile-phase band-edge absorption, which was consistent with the TEM and XRD results. After the introduction of graphene, the G-TNRs composites showed a slight red-shift in the absorption edge. Furthermore, the light-absorption of G-TNRs was enhanced significantly in the ultraviolet region and was also improved slightly in the visible region, which was attributed to the introduction of graphene. To investigate the relationship of light wavelength with the produced photocurrent, the photocurrent was recorded under different wavelength at a bias of 0.2 V, as shown in Fig. S4A (ESI†). The photocurrent of G-TNRs electrode showed significant enhancement at the whole irradiation wavelength (280–420 nm). Both G-TNRs and TNRs showed maximum absorption at 360 nm. This was slightly different from the result of the UV-vis absorption spectra. This observation should be explained by the fact that the test was conducted in a solution, whereas the UV-vis test was performed using a solid powder sample. To verify the improvement of the PEC properties of G-TNRs, amperometric i–t curves were recorded in 0.5 M Na2SO4 with 1.0 M methanol under 360 nm light irradiation (input power 0.5 mW), as shown in Fig. 3B. For each switch on/off event, both TNRs and G-TNRs electrodes showed a rapid and uniform photocurrent response. Remarkably, under irradiation, the photocurrent of the G-TNRs electrode was approximately 7 times higher than that of the pure TNRs electrode and almost no light response was recorded for graphene electrode. The results strongly demonstrate that the PEC performance of G-TNRs was improved significantly after the introduction of graphene. To clearly confirm the PEC oxidation of methanol at the G-TNRs electrode, photocurrents were recorded at different methanol concentrations, as shown in Fig. 3C. Upon UV irradiation (360 nm), the photocurrent showed a linear increase with increasing methanol concentration.

(C) Photocurrent responses of G-TNRs in the presence of 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 M methanol to a light excitation at 360 nm. (D) LSVs of G-TNRs composites measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution electrolyte with or without methanol in the dark and under visible light irradiation. 
To investigate the PEC performance of G-TNRs under sunlight, the LSVs of a G-TNRs electrode were studied under the illumination of solar simulator or in the dark. Fig. 3D shows that the oxidation current of the G-TNRs electrode under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 of sunlight was much higher than that observed in the dark. The photocurrent density could reach 2.2 μA cm−2 at a bias of 0.7 V vs. SCE in 0.5 M Na2SO4, and the onset oxidation potential for H2O was −0.1 V. However, after the addition of 1.0 M methanol, the photo-current density could be increased to 4.9 μA cm−2 and the onset oxidation potential was shifted negatively to −0.4 V. Methanol could act as a better sacrificial electron donor than water and the photogenerated electron–hole could be separated quickly, which resulted in an enhancement of PEC responses and the decrease in overpotential.2 For practical applications, the stability of the photocatalyst should also be considered. Fig. S4B (ESI†) presents the durability test of G-TNRs and TNRs under continuous light irradiation. As seen, both G-TNRs and TNRs exhibited high stability, even after 10000 s measurement.
To validate the feasibility of the proposed PEC methanol fuel cell, we examined the electrochemical properties of the GN–CNT electrode by LSVs in O2 saturated 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. GN–CNT was prepared according to a previous study and used as the cathode material. As shown in Fig. 4A, the ORR current of the GN–CNT electrode could reach 6.3 mA cm−2, indicating the superior ORR properties of the GN–CNT electrode. The morphological feature of the GN–CNT was characterized by SEM, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The onset reduction potential for ORR was 0.22 V, which was much higher than the onset oxidation potential observed at the G-TNRs electrode. Therefore, the observed results strongly showed that the fabrication of a PEC methanol fuel cell was thermodynamically available. A schematic of the photoelectrochemical methanol fuel cell is depicted in Fig. 1; the cell was fabricated by coupling G-TNRs as a photoanode with a GN–CNT modified electrode as the cathode. Fig. 4B shows the cell polarization curves (V–I) and cell power output curves (P–I) operating under sunlight irradiation of 60 mW cm−2 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution containing different amount of methanol. The open circuit voltage and power density increased with increasing methanol concentration, which is in agreement with the results of Fig. 3C. In this PEC fuel cell configuration, methanol served as a representative organic fuel, which was effectively oxidized photocatalytically at the photoanode. In addition, the effects of the irradiation power was explored, as shown in Fig. 4C. The open circuit voltage and power density with sunlight irradiation of 60 mW cm−2 in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution containing 1.0 M methanol showed a significantly increase compared to those in the dark, and the increase in open circuit voltage and power density was directly proportional to the power of irradiation. This indicates that G-TNRs was an efficient photocatalyst that not only photocatalytically oxidized the methanol fuel, but also partially converted the solar energy into electricity. In addition, it is reasonable to conclude that the performance of the fuel cell can be improved either by utilizing higher power of light irradiation, or by using the higher concentration of methanol. For the control experiment, we examined the performance of the PEC methanol fuel cell based on the TNRs photoanode, as shown in Fig. 4D. Compared to G-TNRs based fuel cell, the open circuit voltage of the TNRs based fuel cell showed no significant difference. On the other hand, the power density of the cell based on G-TNRs photoanode was almost 5 times higher than that of the cell based on TNRs photoanode. This suggests that the performance of a PEC methanol fuel cell could be improved significantly by using rationally designed G-TNRs as the photoanode.

In summary, we demonstrated the synthesis of aligned TiO2 nanorod-decorated graphene composites as a novel photocatalyst. 1D TiO2 nanorods grown uniformly upright on 2D graphene nanosheets offered a unique structure that is beneficial to electron transport and increase the contacted area with the electrolyte and light. The photocatalytic activity of G-TNRs was enhanced remarkably compared to TNRs. Importantly, we proposed a conceptual PEC methanol fuel cell utilizing G-TNRs as a high performance photoanode. Note that the power density of this fuel cell still needs to be improved for practical applications. The future direction of the research should not only include the development of more efficient photocatalysts, but also focus on building more effective fuel cells models based on a rationally chosen photoanode and cathode. Nevertheless, this study opens new opportunities for the synthesis of 3D nanostructured photocatalyst and raises a novel avenue for synergistic energy recovery from chemical energy and solar energy.
