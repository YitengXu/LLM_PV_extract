    , Accepted 13th July 2015First published on 13th July 2015AbstractDespite the excellent photo-generated charge separation and transport properties of the 1D rutile TiO2 nanowire (NW) array, insufficient light harvesting due to a low surface area is a key factor that limits the photovoltaic performance of TiO2 NW-based solar cells. Herein, we apply the Sb2S3 semiconductor as a light absorber and sprayed p-CuI as a hole conductor for TiO2 NW solar cells. The Sb2S3-sensitized device displays significantly improved light absorption compared to its corresponding dye-sensitized device, with a peak incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 64%. Moreover, CuI film deposited by the spray technique enables improved pore filling and better electrical contact between the Sb2S3 absorber and CuI, as well as CuI crystals themselves, and facilitates hole transfer from Sb2S3 to CuI crystals and hole transportation in the CuI layer. As a result, the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au device exhibits an overall power conversion efficiency of 1.18% under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, which is about 2.88 times and 2.11 times higher than TiO2 NW/N719/CuI-spray/Au and TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au devices, respectively. This study thus demonstrates the superiority of the Sb2S3 sensitizer for TiO2 NW solar cells and the spray technique for the preparation of the p-CuI hole conductor.
1. Introduction
1D nanostructured TiO2 has been extensively investigated in the solar energy conversion field due to its excellent photo-generated charge separation and transport properties as well as superior chemical stability.1–8 Especially, single-crystalline rutile TiO2 NW arrays, as some of the most potential photoanode materials, have attracted widespread interest for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. A promising efficiency of 3–5% has been achieved for DSSCs employing a 2–4 μm long rutile nanowire array as the photoanode.9–11 However, the overall performance of the 1D TiO2 NW device is limited by its insufficient solar light absorption compared with the TiO2 nanoparticles. The key limiting factor is that TiO2 NW arrays fabricated under the existing conditions (1–5 μm) often display a much lower surface area, resulting in reduced dye-loading.12–15 Efforts to increase the intrinsic surface area of TiO2 NW arrays by morphology control are unsatisfactory.16,17 Therefore, a key approach to enhance solar light absorption is to find sensitizers with a higher molar extinction coefficient.6 In this regard, inorganic semiconductor absorbers such as CdS,18–20 CdSe,21 PbS,22 PbSe,23,24 Sb2S325,26 and Sb2Se3,27–29 which generally act as quantum dots or extremely thin absorbers, exhibit a much higher absorption coefficient than the ruthenium dye. Besides, they possess a large intrinsic dipole moment, multiple exciton generation and superior chemical stability.30–33 All these properties make inorganic semiconductor absorbers attractive for solar cell applications.
Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has been proved to be an efficient light absorber for solar cell applications due to its high absorption coefficient (1.8 × 105 cm−1 in the visible region) and appropriate bandgap (∼1.7–1.8 eV).34–37 For example, Hodes et al. reported an incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of up to 80% and an energy conversion efficiency (η) of 3.37% for the Sb2S3 sensitized nanoporous TiO2 solar cells.38 Seok et al. reported an IPCE of 80% and η up to 6.3% for Sb2S3 sensitized mesoporous TiO2 solar cells employing conductive polymers as hole-transport materials.39 Recently, the cell efficiency was further enhanced to a record value of 7.5% by surface sulfurization of Sb2S3.40 The high IPCE efficiency demonstrates that Sb2S3 should be a suitable sensitizer material for incorporation into 1D TiO2 NW solar cells.26,37,41
In previous studies, several solid-state hole-transport materials such as organic spiro-MeOTAD,35 P3HT34,37 and PCPDTBT,39,40 and inorganic CuSCN25,38,42–44 have been adopted for Sb2S3-sensitized solar cells. Copper iodide (CuI) is a good p-type semiconductor with high charge mobility and can be easily dissolved in acetonitrile for deposition. Its valence band edge (−5.3 eV vs. the vacuum level) locates above the bottom of the valence band of semiconductor Sb2S3 (Fig. 1), which can enable photo-generated hole transfer from Sb2S3 to CuI.45–47 However, conventionally applying droplets of CuI solution repeatedly onto the nanoporous TiO2 film usually produces large crystals of CuI of ∼1–5 μm, which do not penetrate into the nanoporous structure, and form poor contact between Sb2S3 and CuI crystals.48 The incorporation of molten salt (e.g. MEISCN) can control the CuI crystal size to nanoscale by suppressing the crystal growth, however, this usually sacrifices the electrical conductivity of the CuI film.46,48

Herein, we couple the spray technique instead of the conventional drop coating method for p-CuI deposition with Sb2S3-sensitized 1D TiO2 NW film to construct a novel solid-state TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray solar cell. Experimental results indeed show that the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au device exhibits significantly enhanced light absorption than its corresponding dye-sensitized TiO2 NW device with an equivalent photoanode surface area, reaching a maximum yield of IPCE up to 64%. As a result, the device exhibits an overall efficiency of 1.18% under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, which is about 2.88 times and 2.11 times higher than TiO2 NW/N719/CuI-spray/Au and TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au devices, respectively. The enhanced photovoltaic performance should be attributed to the synergistic effect of efficient light harvesting by the Sb2S3 absorber and improved hole transfer away from Sb2S3 to CuI crystals and hole transportation in the CuI film promoted by the spray technique.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Tetrabutyl titanate (98%), titanium chloride (99%), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (36–37%) were received from Beijing Chemical Works. Hexachloroplatinic acid and copper iodide (CuI) were received from Wako Chemicals. Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), antimony chloride (SbCl3), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), indium chloride (InCl3·4H2O), thioacetamide and acetic acid were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. The N719 dye was obtained from Solaronix. Iodine (I2) and lithium iodide (LiI) were received from ACROS. Anhydrous acetonitrile and valeronitrile were received from Acros. 1-Propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) were received from Heptachroma. 4-tert-butylpyridine was received from TCI. F-doped SnO2 transparent conducting glass substrates (FTO) were obtained from Nippon Sheet Glass (15 Ω □−1).
2.2 TiO2 NW/Sb2S3 and TiO2 NW/N719 photoanode preparation
The rutile TiO2 NW array was prepared on the titanate nanosheet deposited FTO substrate via a hydrothermal method following the previously reported procedure.49 In brief, the titanate nanosheet film, acting as a blocking layer (abbreviated to BL), was firstly deposited on clean FTO substrates by the electrophoretic deposition method, then the substrates were used to grow a TiO2 NW array by positioning them upright in autoclaves containing tetrabutyl titanate (98%), concentrated hydrochloric acid (36–38%) and deionized water at a volume ratio of 1:40:40, with the side of the blocking layer facing the wall. The autoclaves were heated to 150 °C and kept at a constant temperature for 10 h. After cooling down to room temperature in air, the FTO substrates were taken out of the autoclaves, rinsed with deionized water, dried in air, and annealed at 450 °C for 20 min in order to remove any organic ingredients. Before the deposition of the Sb2S3 absorber, the TiO2 NW film was first soaked in a TiCl4 (40 mM) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 24 h, then washed with deionized water, dried in air, and sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min. Next, the TiO2 NW film was dipped into a solution containing InCl3·4H2O, thioacetamide and acetic acid, maintained at 65 °C for 30 min to form a thin layer of Inx(OH)ySz (In–OH–S) by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method.38,50 Then, Sb2S3 was deposited onto the surface-treated TiO2 NW by the CBD method using a solution of SbCl3 and Na2S2O3·5H2O at 10 °C for 20 min. Then the orange film was taken out of the bath, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and annealed under N2 atmosphere at 330 °C for 20 min. The film needs to be removed from the furnace immediately and cooled to room temperature in air, in order to form an insulating Sb2O3 layer on the Sb2S3 surface. This Sb2O3 layer acts as a passivation layer, which can suppress electron–hole recombination in the Sb2S3 absorber and also the recombination between electrons in Sb2S3 and holes in CuI.38 To prepare a TiO2 NW/N719 photoanode, the TiO2 NW film was immersed in a dry ethanol solution (0.3 mM) of N719 at room temperature for 24 h to complete the dye adsorption.
2.3 Device fabrication
For CuI deposition, the anhydrous solution of CuI (15 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) was dropped using a pipette or sprayed using a needle-like atomizer onto the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3 and TiO2 NW/N719 films at a temperature of 60 °C, with N2 as a carrier gas. The cell was completed by clamping together the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3 or N719/CuI layer with an Au counter electrode prepared by thermal evaporation. To prepare electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cells, the TiO2 NW/N719 photoanode and the Pt counter electrode made by thermal deposition of H2PtCl6 were assembled into a sandwich type cell, and the electrolyte containing 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M GuSCN, 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile:valeronitrile (85:15) was then injected into the space between the two electrodes to complete the cell fabrication.49
2.4 Characterization
The morphology of the photoanodes was observed using a FEI Quanta 250 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer. Diffuse reflectance spectra of the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3 film were collected on a Lambda UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. J–V characteristics of the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI/Au solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation from a Sun 2000 solar simulator (ABET technology). The active area of the solar cells was determined as 0.13 cm2. The IPCE measurements were recorded on a homemade system containing a 450–1000 W Xe lamp (Newport, 66902), a Monochromator (Newport Cornerstone™ 260 1/4 M) and a Keithley 2400 Source Meter. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed at 0.2 V forward bias in the dark with the frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz (CHI660C).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structural characterization

Fig. 1 shows a device structure composed of FTO/TiO2 BL/TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI/Au and band alignment among TiO2, Sb2S3 and CuI, indicating that the photo-generated electron–hole separation and transfer at the TiO2/Sb2S3 and Sb2S3/CuI interfaces are theoretically reasonable. Fig. 2 presents the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of TiO2 NWs grown on a titanate nanosheet film with a thickness of 300 nm, which is necessary for avoiding the direct contact between CuI and FTO substrates that would short-circuit the cell. From the SEM images we can see that the NWs are tetragonal in shape with square top facets, with average diameters of about 80 nm and lengths of 1.8 μm. These NWs are in single crystalline rutile phase with preferential growth along the (001) axis, as has been demonstrated in our previous high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and electron diffraction (ED) pattern.49 Moreover, the SEM images indicate that the open porous structure of the NW array facilitates the following deposition and pore filling of the Sb2S3 absorber and p-CuI. Afterwards, we performed surface treatment of TiO2 NWs with an Inx(OH)ySz (In–OH–S) layer to prevent the direct contact between TiO2 NWs and the Sb2S3 absorber. This treatment has been reported to be important for nucleation and the chemical stability of the Sb2S3 absorber on the TiO2 NW surface, and also for suppressing recombination.38

Fig. 3a shows the XRD pattern of the chemical bath deposited Sb2S3 film. It can be seen that the as-deposited Sb2S3 displays characteristic features of the stibnite structure (PDF card. 06-0474). Fig. 3b shows the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the as-prepared TiO2 NW/Sb2S3 film. Taking into account the light loss due to the reflection of FTO glass (∼20%), Sb2S3 film absorbs most of the incident light in the visible region, and indicates an absorption onset of ∼750 nm. From the Kubelka–Munk spectrum (inset of Fig. 3b) converted from the data from Fig. 3b using equation F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R, the bandgap of Sb2S3 film is determined to be ∼1.78 eV, which is consistent with the reported 1.7–1.8 eV bandgap of crystalline Sb2S3.34,36,39Fig. 4 shows the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of Sb2S3 deposited on TiO2 NW films with different deposition times. As can be seen from these images, the precursor solution has penetrated into the NW film completely, resulting in an even coating of the Sb2S3 layer over the entire surface of TiO2 NWs. We note that the thickness of the Sb2S3 layer increases with the extension of deposition time from 20 min (Fig. 4a and b) to 60 min (Fig. 4e and f), while the pore space among individual NWs still remains after Sb2S3 deposition, except that the pore size is decreased. It is worth noting that although the deposition time in our case is less than 1 h, the loading amount of Sb2S3 is sufficient for covering the surface of the TiO2 NW with a thickness of 1.8 μm, which can be clearly seen from the dark brown color and light reflectance of TiO2 NW/Sb2S3 films revealed by the digital photographs and reflectance spectra, respectively (Fig. S1 in ESI†).

For p-CuI deposition, the Sb2S3 (deposition time: 20 min) coated TiO2 NW film is placed on a hot plate of 60 °C. One method we employ is repeatedly applying droplets of CuI solution (0.15 g in 10 mL of acetonitrile) onto the film using a pipette, the solvent evaporates quickly, leaving CuI crystals in the gaps of NWs. This process is repeated until the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3 pores are filled with p-CuI.46 Another method is to spray the CuI solution onto the film using N2 as a carrier gas. Top-view SEM image in Fig. 5a shows that the CuI film deposited by drop coating is composed of large crystallites of ∼1–5 μm. The cross-sectional image (Fig. 5b) indicates that these large crystals form a capping layer on the Sb2S3-sensitized TiO2 NW film, instead of penetrating into the porous matrix, resulting in poor contact between Sb2S3 and CuI, as well as bad contact between CuI crystals themselves. As we all know, the poor electrical contact will significantly decrease the efficiency of hole transfer away from Sb2S3 into the CuI crystals. Also, the insufficient pore filling results in voids in the film, which will decrease the hole transportation efficiency in the CuI layer.46,48 Alternatively, the CuI crystal size decreases to nanoscale by employing the spray technique, leading to the formation of a dense and uniform CuI layer around the TiO2/Sb2S3 surface, as can be seen in Fig. 5c–h. When the deposition time is 60 s (Fig. 5c and d), a uniform CuI layer is formed around the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3, leaving considerable voids between NWs. When the spray time is 90 s (Fig. 5e and f), CuI crystals have filled the TiO2 NW pores completely and formed a CuI layer covering the film when the spray time is up to 120 s (Fig. 5g and h). Therefore, the spray technique is a simple and useful strategy for obtaining nanosized CuI crystals with uniform distribution. Such a distribution is considered to enable sufficient pore filling and better electrical contact between the Sb2S3 absorber and CuI, as well as good contact between CuI crystals themselves. For comparing the incorporation of molten salt (e.g. MEISCN) in CuI solution to control the crystal size,46,48 the spray technique is advantageous in not sacrificing the electrical conductivity of CuI film.

3.2 Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the effect of applying the Sb2S3 absorber and the CuI spray technique on the photovoltaic performance of 1D TiO2 NW solar cells, we measured the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of a typical solar cell based on the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au structure, in comparison with TiO2 NW/N719/CuI-spray/Au and TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au solar cells under AM1.5 solar simulator illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is shown in Fig. 6. The Sb2S3 layer deposition time and the p-CuI spray time are 20 min and 120 s respectively. Detailed device parameters are presented in Table 1. It can be seen that dye-sensitized TiO2 NW solar cells with sprayed CuI as the hole conductor exhibits an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 444 mV, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 1.93 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 47.9% and an overall energy conversion efficiency (η) of 0.41%. Alternatively, Sb2S3-sensitized TiO2 NW solar cells exhibit significantly better photocurrent output than its corresponding dye-sensitized device with an equivalent photoanode surface area, which is 6.46 mA cm−2 and 9.34 mA cm−2, respectively. IPCE measurement in Fig. 7 also indicates that the photocurrent conversion efficiencies of Sb2S3-sensitized devices are significantly higher than that of the dye-sensitized device over the visible wavelength range, with the peak efficiency reaching 64%. This observation demonstrates the intrinsic superior properties of semiconductor Sb2S3 than ruthenium dye in solar light absorption, and indicates that Sb2S3 is a suitable sensitizer material for TiO2 NW solar cells. In addition, higher photocurrent is expected to be achieved from the device with a larger loading amount of Sb2S3, however, in our case, a decrease in IPCE is observed when increasing the deposition time of the Sb2S3 layer from 20 min to 80 min (see Fig. S2 in ESI,† device: TiO2/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au), which is inconsistent with the increase of light absorption by the Sb2S3 layer. This observation can be explained by the decreased charge collection efficiency caused by decreased pore space in a Sb2S3-sensitized TiO2 NW porous matrix with the extension of Sb2S3 deposition time, as has been shown in Fig. 4, which makes the pore filling of CuI more difficult. Insufficient pore filling is considered to lead to poor electrical contact between Sb2S3 and CuI, and an increase in internal recombination of charge carriers.

When comparing Sb2S3-sensitized TiO2 NW solar cells with the CuI hole conductor prepared by different methods, the device using a spray technique has Voc, Jsc and FF of 300 mV, 9.34 mA cm−2 and 42%, respectively, reaching an overall energy conversion efficiency of 1.18%, which is 2.11 times higher than that using the drop coating method. Higher efficiency could be achieved with longer NWs. Comparing the dark J–V curves of TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au and TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au solar cells (Fig. 8), we can see that the dark current of the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au device is obviously lower than that of the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au device. Lower dark current is considered to suggest a slower interfacial recombination rate between photo-generated electrons in Sb2S3 or TiO2 and holes in Sb2S3 or CuI, which improves FF, Voc and finally the efficiency of the device. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with applied bias voltage under dark conditions was conducted to investigate the recombination process of the device, as shown in Fig. 9. All spectra exhibit a high frequency semicircle that represents the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode (Rpt) and a low frequency semicircle that corresponds to the interfacial charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/Sb2S3/CuI interface (Rct). According to the EIS model reported in the literature,37,51 the Rpt and Rct for TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au, TiO2 NW/N719/CuI-spray/Au and TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au devices were calculated to be 2.52 Ω, 2.73 Ω, 2.46 Ω and 63.6 Ω, 68.2 Ω, 41.7 Ω, respectively. Clearly, the Rct of the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au device increases after the application of the CuI spray technique, suggesting a slower recombination rate at the TiO2/Sb2S3/CuI interface,37 which correlates well with its lower dark current and improved FF and Voc. In our case, the suppressed interfacial recombination of the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au device should be attributed to the improved pore filling of CuI promoted by the spray technique, which enables better electrical contact between the Sb2S3 absorber and CuI, as well as CuI crystals themselves, and facilitates hole transfer from Sb2S3 to CuI crystals and hole transportation in the CuI layer. Although taking dye-sensitized TiO2 NW solar cells as a reference, the pore filling of solid CuI by the spray technique is still insufficient in comparison with liquid electrolyte, which can explain the relatively inferior device performance (see Fig. S3 and Table S1 in ESI†), yet the spray technique did improve the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI/Au device.

From dark J–V curves of the three typical solar cells based on TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au, TiO2 NW/N719/CuI-spray/Au and TiO2 NW/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au structures, we note that Sb2S3-sensitized devices exhibit much higher dark current and poor diode rectifying characteristics than the dye-sensitized device. The higher dark current should be attributed to short circuiting between the CuI crystals and uncovered parts of TiO2 by the Sb2S3 semiconductor.52–54 Perfect surface coverage of TiO2 has been demonstrated by Dematage et al. via dye adsorption on the Sb2S3 surface, which can decrease dark current and thereby improve device performance.55 In our case, efforts on suppressing interfacial recombination by performing quality control of materials and interfacial engineering strategies are still under process, in order to further improve the performance of solid-state Sb2S3 sensitized TiO2 NW solar cells.
4. Conclusion
In summary, TiO2 nanowire solar cells based on the Sb2S3 absorber and the CuI hole conductor have been constructed. Experimental results show that the photocurrent of TiO2 nanowire solar cells is significantly improved due to the superior optical properties of semiconductor Sb2S3 to that of ruthenium dye. By using the spray technique instead of the drop coating method to prepare a CuI hole conductor, we found that pore filling of CuI in the nanowire structure is improved, making the electrical contact between the Sb2S3 absorber and CuI, as well as CuI crystals themselves better. This facilitates hole transfer from Sb2S3 to CuI crystals and hole transportation in the CuI layer. These factors render the TiO2 nanowire/Sb2S3/CuI-spray/Au device exhibiting superior performance with a peak incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency value of 64% and a solar energy conversion efficiency of 1.18%, which are about 2.88 times and 2.11 times higher than those of TiO2 nanowire/N719/CuI-spray/Au and TiO2 nanowire/Sb2S3/CuI-drop coating/Au devices, respectively, and also higher than that of electrolyte-based dye-sensitized device with an equivalent TiO2 nanowire photoanode. Although the efficiency of 1.18% is not competitive to the state of the art Sb2S3-sensitized TiO2 nanowire device (3–4%), our study definitely provides a useful spray technique for improving the photovoltaic performance of TiO2 nanowire/Sb2S3/CuI/Au solar cells, which could be helpful in the design of other highly efficient solid-state semiconductor-sensitized solar cells.
