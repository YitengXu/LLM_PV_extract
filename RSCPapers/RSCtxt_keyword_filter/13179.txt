    , Accepted 2nd May 2013First published on 2nd May 2013AbstractPlausible mechanisms of the ultrafast electron injection and the significant dependence of the power conversion efficiency on the anchor group for the triphenylamine-based dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells have been explored by the density functional calculations. Calculations show that the ultrafast charge recombination on the surface trap state of the dye-sensitized TiO2 system can be ascribed to the lack of electron density on the carboxyl group of the A3 dye with the rhodanine group anchor. Predicted electronic and optical properties of the A1-3-adsorbed TiO2 system reveal that the direct electron injection arises from the electronic excitation from HOMO-1 of the dye to the conduction band bottom of TiO2. On the basis of the calculations, the electron density distributions of related frontier orbitals and energy bands of dyes and their adsorbed systems have been discussed, which play an important role in electron injection and charge recombination.
1. Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), also known as the Grätzel cell, is extensively considered to be one of the most promising alternative to conventional silicon solar cells, due to its low-cost and fabrication feasibility.1,2 The record of power-conversion efficiency (PCE) for DSSC was rapidly up to 10% in the late 1990s and then slowly approached 11.5%.3–6 In 2011, the PCE of DSSCs climbed to a new record of 12.3%.7,8 In these DSSCs, the dyes act as sensitizers to absorb sunlight and then the photoexcited electrons from the dyes can be rapidly injected into the conduction band of TiO2 semiconductor photoanode, while the concomitant holes are transferred to the redox electrolyte. Over the past two decades, considerable research attempts have been devoted to the efficiency enhancement of DSSCs, both experimentally and theoretically,4,9–19 including structural design for novel adsorption properties of the dye sensitizer,4,9–14 optimization of metal oxide nanocrystalline with different nanostructures,15,16,20,21 development of a wide diversity of redox electrolytes,8,17,22 utilization of different photoactive working electrodes and counter electrodes.18,23 Among them, the sensitizer is one of the most important key factors to dominate the PCE in DSSCs.
In comparison with typical metal complex dyes,4,8,24,25 the metal-free organic dyes26–33 have stimulated considerable research enthusiasm in recent years, owing to the high molar extinction coefficient, the tunability of structures, as well as environmentally friendly and low-cost features for large-scale applications. The arylamine unit has been widely employed as the donor, while the cyanoacrylate group usually serves as the acceptor and the π-bridge is often composed of thiophene and their derivative units in donor–(π-bridge)–acceptor metal-free organic dyes.10 For example, the courmarin-based (NKX-2677,26 NKX-259313), indoline-based (D20530) and triphenylamine-based (D5,12 C217,31,34 TTC10335 and C21932) dyes with novel structures exhibit quite high photovoltaic energy conversion efficiencies. Among these dyes, the triphenylamine-based dye C219 provides the highest PCE of 10.0–10.3%. More recently, the triphenylamine unit has been widely used as the electron donor for metal-free organic sensitizers due to its excellent electron donating and transporting capability, as well as peculiar structure of propeller starburst to prohibit aggregation.33 For example, the novel dye D5 has attracted considerable interest due to its remarkable high PCE since its successful synthesis.12 On the basis of the typical molecular architecture for D5, lots of triphenylamine-based organic compounds, such as D7, D9, and D11 dyes with a novel unsymmetrical structure,11 DS-1 to DS-4 dyes with different types of thiophene-containing conjugation moieties,36 P2 dye containing conjugated polymer triphenylamine,37 C21731 and C21932 with a binary spacer, C1, C6, and C9 dyes in combination with disubstituted triphenylamine groups,38 L0–L4 by increasing the π-conjugation of the linker39 and TP6CADTS40 dye adopting coplanar diphenyl-substituted dithienosilol as a linker bridge, have been developed and applied as organic sensitizers in DSSCs.
Since the pioneering studies of interfacial electron injection were carried out,41–43 considerable effort has recently been made to explore the surface electronic and molecular structure and the mechanism of photoexcited electron injection into the semiconductor in dye–TiO2 solar cells.14,44–46 For instance, the effect of anchoring groups on the electron injection and charge recombination dynamics in D5-based dyes D5L2A1 (A1) and D5L2A3 (A3) has been explored by transient absorption spectroscopy,14 and their spectroscopic investigations show that A1 with a cyanoacrylic acid anchor has relatively higher PCE than A3 with a rhodanine anchoring group. For both A1 and A3 dyes, there are ultrafast and indistinguishable electron injections into TiO2 (<200 fs), and thus their charge recombination properties may account for the difference in energy conversion efficiencies caused by the different anchoring groups. It was assumed that the electron density distributions of frontier orbitals in the sensitizer adsorbed onto TiO2 play an important role in charge recombination and electron injection processes.
In consideration of the diversity of electron injection processes,13,38,39 here we have conducted extensive first-principles studies on A1 and A3 dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 semiconductor to explore their electronic and optical properties. Different adsorption patterns of these organic sensitizers on the TiO2 surface and the interface effect on their electronic and spectroscopic features were investigated by the density functional theory. Based on calculations on the ground- and excited-state dyes, the diversity in energy conversion efficiency and its inherent nature, as well as the plausible electron injection mechanisms were discussed.
2. Computational details
Plausible equilibrium geometries and electronic properties of A1 and A3 dyes were carried out by the B3LYP47,48 hybrid functional in combination with the all electron 6-31G(d)49–52 basis set. The electronic spectra of the most stable structures of dyes containing large π-conjugated units were calculated by time-dependent long-rang-corrected density functional theory TD-LC-ωPBE/6-31G(d),53,54 and the emission spectra were estimated by the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Solvation effects associated with acetonitrile (MeCN) as solvent are treated by using the continuum solvent model of SMD.55 The calculations on the structural and electronic properties of dyes in the present work have been performed with Gaussian09 program.56
Here the two-dimensional slab model of TiO2 nanostructure was obtained by appropriately cutting the most stable anatase TiO2(101)57–59 surface to model the TiO2 nanoparticle in DSSCs, which is a rectangular unit cell of a 16-atomic-layer slab (10.210 × 22.656 Å2, (TiO2)48, 144 atoms). In all calculations, the bottom of six atomic layers is fixed while the other layers are allowed to relax. The following geometry optimization and calculation of the electronic properties for the periodic systems with and without the adsorbed sensitizer were performed by using the plane-wave technique implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).60,61 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional62 was employed to describe the exchange–correction potential in all calculations. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method63 was used to describe the electron–ion interaction and the cutoff energy was set to 370 eV. All atomic positions were optimized by the conjugated gradient method with a converging tolerance of 0.02 eV Å−1 for the force on all atoms. The 2D periodic boundary conditions are considered along the growth direction of the slab TiO2 nanostructure. A vacuum distance ∼8 Å was set to keep the negligible interaction between layer nanostructures in the adjacent cells. Monkhost pack meshes of Γ point were used for the geometry optimization, due to the large unit cell. The 5 × 5 × 1 and 11 × 11 × 1 Γ-centered k-point meshes were used in the density of states (DOS) integral for the periodic systems with and without the adsorbed dye, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled by 44 k-point and 20 k-point by using the line-mode to calculate their electronic band structures.
The absorption coefficient α(ω) of the linear optical properties on the basis of the optimized structure was evaluated by the dielectric function. The Vanderbit ultrasoft pseudopotential64 with a cutoff energy of 340 eV and the GGA-PBE functional were used in calculations with the CASTEP package.65 The imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric constant was given by  where u is the vector to define the polarization of the incident electric field, k is the reciprocal lattice vector, and the c and v represent the conduction band and valence band, respectively. The real part ε1(ω) can be derived from the imaginary part through the Kramers–Kronig relationships. The absorption coefficient α(ω) is expressed as follows:  
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic and optical properties of free dyes
Optimized geometries of the respective four conformations of A1 and A3, denoted as A1-1, A1-2, A1-3, A1-4, A3-1, A3-2, A3-3 and A3-4, as well as their relative Gibbs free energies (given in parentheses) are displayed in Fig. 1. As Fig. 1 shows, the isomers A1-3 and A3-3 show relatively high stabilities among these conformations considered here for A1 and A3. The most stable A1-3 is lower in energy than A1-1 by 3.3 kcal mol−1, and A1-4 and A1-2 are more stable than A1-1 by 1.6 and 1.2 kcal mol−1, respectively. Such different configurations of A1 are derived from the intramolecular rotation of the thienyl unit and the cyanoacrylic acid anchor. For the isomers of A3, there is a relative energy order: A3-3 < A3-4 < A3-1 < A3-2, where A3-3 is more stable than A3-2 by 4.9 kcal mol−1. As shown in Fig. 1, the most stable structures of A1-3 and A3-3 have similar configurations except for the different anchor groups.

To have an insight into the electronic properties of A1-3 and A3-3, their lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are presented in Fig. 2. As Fig. 2 shows, these HOMOs and LUMOs show π-character for both dyes. In particular, the HOMO in A1-3 is more delocalized over the entire molecular region than that in A3-3. The LUMO in A1-3 is basically distributed over the cyanoacrylic acid anchor and linker groups, whereas the carboxyl group, the anchoring group of rhodanine in A3-3 lacks the electron density due to the presence of CH2 in the vicinity, as predicted in a previous study.14

The difference in electronic density distribution between HOMO and LUMO results in the intermolecular charge separation between the donor and acceptor moieties of sensitizer upon excitation, indicating that the large dipole moment may exist in the first excited state, as compared to the ground state.39 As Fig. 3 shows, the simulated strongest absorptions appear in the visible region of 429 (f = 1.5654) and 438 nm (f = 2.0121) for free dyes A1-3 and A3-3, respectively, and they correspond to the first electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO, as shown in Table 1. The predicted spectra of absorption and emission in Fig. 3 show good agreement with the experimental results.14

To explore the charge-transfer features of these electronic transitions, we examined variations of the total electronic densities between the ground and first excited states. The corresponding electron density difference map is incorporated into Fig. 3, where the blue and yellow regions refer to an increase and a decrease of electronic density, respectively. As the density difference map reveals, there are remarkable charge-transfer characters for these transitions, in which the electronic density in the photoexcited dye A1-3 exhibits a decrease at the triphenylamine group and an increase at the cyanoacrylic acid anchor and the linker group, indicating that the triphenylamine moiety and the π-bridge and cyanoacrylic acid moieties correspond to the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, respectively, as suggested in the previous experiments.33,38 However, most of the increasing electronic densities are only delocalized over part of the rhodamine group and π-bridge region, and hardly on the carboxyl group for A3-3. Accordingly, the relatively higher electronic densities at the anchor group of the photoexcited A1-3 dye, as compared to the excited A3-3 dye, will make the electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 more effectively, resulting in a higher PCE efficiency for A1-3 than A3-3 in DSSCs if the interactions between the dye and TiO2 in DSSC can be ignored.
3.2 Electronic and optical properties of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 system

A. Structure and stability. 
On the basis of previous studies,66–68 selected computational models for dyes and dye-adsorbed TiO2 systems have been considered (see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Although the global minimum search69 is more applicable for the location of possible adsorbed configurations, here the adsorption modes arising from the strong bonding interactions between the anchors and the surface of TiO2 should be limited. Fig. 4 shows an optimized structure of the A1-3-adsorbed TiO2 system (denoted as A1-3-a), where the dye molecule is bidentatively bound to the surface of TiO2 through interactions of its two oxygen atoms with two titanium atoms on the TiO2(101) surface, and the proton on COOH is transferred to the oxygen atom on the surface of TiO2 near the adsorbed site. As Fig. 4 shows, the two Ti–O distances in the chelate configuration are 2.016 and 2.137 Å, respectively. Both bond lengths are comparable to the Ti–O separations (1.930–1.973 Å) in the bulk TiO2, suggesting that there is strong chemisorption of the A1-3 dye on the TiO2(101) surface, as shown by the charge density difference map (A1-3-b) in Fig. 4. The difference in electronic density between the two different fragments, i.e., the first fragment is the molecule of A1-3 adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 (pink circle) and the second one is TiO2(101), which can be estimated from:Δρ = ρtotal − (ρA1-3 + ρTiO2)where ρtotal is the electron density of the entire A1-3 + TiO2(101) system, ρA1-3 and ρTiO2 are the electronic densities of the isolated sorbate and substrate, respectively. As Fig. 4 shows, the blue areas show where the electronic density has been enriched with respect to fragments; conversely, the yellow areas show where the density has been depleted. The relatively larger electronic densities on two Ti–O bonds clearly show the formation of a strong covalent bond in the bridging–bidentate configuration.

B. Energy band structure and density of states. 
The density of states (DOS) of the bare TiO2 (on the top, black), the total DOS and the A1-3 partial DOS (PDOS) of dye–TiO2 system (on the bottom, blue and red) are provided in Fig. 5. As compared to the DOS of bare TiO2, we note that A1-3 introduces few π-occupied levels on the top of the TiO2 valence band. As Fig. 6 shows, such new levels are corresponding to the linear band structures. In Fig. 5, it can be clearly seen that the PDOS of the dye has a strong overlap with the valence band and the higher energy conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor over a wide range of energy and the new π-occupied levels from the dye become the new top of the valence band for the A1-3 + TiO2 system. Presumably, these new π-occupied levels may account for a direct charge injection mechanism of a photoexcited electron transition from these π levels into the bottom of the conduction band in TiO2.

C. Electron injection mechanism. 
In order to have further insight into the suggested injection mechanism, herein, the partial charge densities for the Γ point of VBM-9, VBM-7, VBM-5, VBM-4, VBM-2, VBM-1, VBM (valence band maximum), CBM (conduction band minimum) and CBM + 1 bands are sketched as displayed in Fig. 7. As Fig. 7 shows, the VBM, CBM and CBM + 1 energy bands are the highest valence band, the lowest conduction band and the second conduction band of the A1-3 + TiO2 system, respectively. Clearly, the electronic density from the highest valence band VBM is predominately located on the dye adsorbed on the surface of TiO2, while the electronic densities from the lowest and next conduction bands CBM and CBM + 1 are basically located on the Ti(3d) orbitals of TiO2. And the energy band gap of the dye + TiO2 system is 0.53 eV (2339 nm), suggesting that this system is still a semiconductor. It is clearly seen that other partial charge densities from the VBM-1 to VBM-5 bands are mainly composed of π-conjugated orbitals of the dye, and the electronic densities for bands VBM-7 and VBM-9 mainly reside in TiO2 and the adsorption interface, suggesting that there are strong interactions between the dye and TiO2.

In Fig. 8, four frontier occupied molecular orbitals HOMO, HOMO-1, HOMO-2 and HOMO-4 of A1-3 are provided to figure out their correlation with the molecular orbitals of the isolated dye A1-3. As Fig. 8 shows, such frontier molecular orbitals just correspond to the partial electronic densities of the VBM, VBM-1, VBM-2 and VBM-4 bands, respectively. Accordingly, the electrons generated from the photoexcited A1-3 dye are probably injected into the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles directly, which lends support to the direct injection mechanism.

D. Optical properties. 
To further explore the photoexcited electron transit between dye and TiO2 semiconductor, the optical properties of the dye-adsorbed system were investigated. The interaction of a photon with an electron can be described in terms of the time-dependent perturbation of the ground electronic state in quantum mechanics. The transitions between occupied and unoccupied states arise from the photon adsorption or emission. In general, the optical properties of the solids can be described by the complex dielectric function. The photon absorption coefficient α(ω) of dye + TiO2 is shown in Fig. 9. The absorption coefficient reflects the fraction of energy lost by the wave when it passes through a unit thickness of the materials. For the energy dependence of the absorption coefficient α(ω) of the dye + TiO2 system, only the intrinsic absorption was considered because of a minor influence of the polarized absorption on the absorption coefficient.70 As Fig. 9 shows, relatively strong four peaks correspond to the photon energies of 1071, 634, 400 and 234 nm in the region of 200–1400 nm. In combination with the energy band structure in Fig. 7, some of the main peaks can be assigned to the direct transitions from the valence bands to the conduction bands. For example, the energy band gaps of VBM → CBM (0.53 eV/2339 nm) and VBM-1 → CBM (1.31 eV/947 nm) probably correspond to the wide absorption at 1071 nm, and the energy band gap of VBM-2 → CBM (2.17 eV/571 nm) might be responsible for the absorption at 634 nm.
 Fig. 9  Predicted optical properties of the A1-3-sensitized TiO2) system (absorption coefficient α(ω) as a function of the photon energy). 
Considering that the pure functional generally underestimates the energy band gap remarkably in our previous calculations,71 the hybrid HSE0672–74 calculations on the bare TiO2 slab periodic system have been performed to evaluate the gap difference with respect to the pure GGA-PBE. The hybrid HSE06 has been verified to have high accuracy in determination of band gap, although it suffers from relatively high computational costs. Our test calculations reveal that the pure GGA-PBE systematically underestimate the band gap by 1.22 eV for TiO2 system (see Fig. S3 in ESI†), compared to the HSE06. Accordingly, the modified energy band gaps of VBM → CBM, VBM-1 → CBM, and VBM-2 → CBM become ∼1.75 eV (∼709 nm), ∼2.53 eV (∼490 nm), and ∼3.39 eV (∼366 nm), respectively. The predicted transition of VBM-1 → CBM (∼490 nm) is comparable with the experimental observation of ∼440 nm.14
We note that there is no absorption in visible light for the transition of VBM → CBM due to lack of photoactivity. Since the localized dative bonding interactions between the carboxyl group of the dye and the titanium cation of TiO2 account for the surface adsorption, the corresponding π electronic transitions in the adsorbed system should be less changed, as compared to the isolated dye. Presumably, the direct injection of the photoexcited electrons from HOMO-1 of the A1-3 dye into the bottom of conduction band of TiO2 nanostructure may account for the ultrafast and indistinguishable electron injections in the dye sensitized TiO2 solar cells (<200 fs). There is a similar electron injection mechanism for the A1-1 + TiO2 system from the predicted electronic and optical properties (see Fig. S4–S10 and Table S1 in ESI†).

4. Conclusions
Extensive density functional calculations have been used to explore the electronic and optical properties of the triphenylamine-based organic dye sensitized TiO2 systems (A1 + TiO2 and A3 + TiO2). Plausible mechanisms for the ultrafast electron injection from the photoexcited dye A1 (D5) to the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticle were elucidated based on current calculations. Calculations show that the electron density distribution of these dyes in the ground and excited states strongly depends on the modification of the anchor group, which may play an important role in charge recombination and electron injection processes. In particular, the carboxyl group anchor of the photoexcited dye A3-3 was predicted to have quite less electronic density, suggesting that the photoexcited electron cannot be effectively injected to the conduction band of TiO2. The predicted electronic and optical properties of the A1-3 + TiO2 system show that the direct electron injection arises from the photoexcited electron transfer from the HOMO-1 orbital of A1-3 to the conduction band bottom of TiO2. The electron density distributions of the frontier orbitals and energy bands in the free dyes, the adsorbed dyes, and the entire dye-sensitized TiO2 systems reveal remarkable charge transfers in their first photoexcitation processes, and these distinct features of electron density distribution may be responsible for their difference in electron injection and charge recombination. The present theoretical investigations provide the basis to further understand the interaction between dye and TiO2 and the electron injection mechanism.
