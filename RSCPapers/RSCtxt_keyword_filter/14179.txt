    , Accepted 19th December 2019First published on 23rd December 2019AbstractPhotoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is one of the crucial indicators to determine the overall performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and accurate estimation of PCE is a feasible strategy for developing high-performance DSSC devices. In this contribution, we strategically designed a series of anthracene-based organic dyes 1–4 by introducing different π-bridge or auxiliary acceptor groups. Their photovoltaic properties were explored by first-principles calculations coupled with the normal model and improved normal model. It is found that the introduction of an electron-rich thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based π-spacer in dye 2 induces a blue-shift of the maximum absorption band with respect to dye 1, while the inclusion of an electron-deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole-based π-bridge in dye 3 and a thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine-based auxiliary acceptor in dye 4 can remarkably extend the optical absorption into the 550–650 nm region. In addition, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and the corresponding PCE (η) were evaluated by the improved normal model. The estimated results of dye 1 (VOC = 757 mV, JSC = 14.63 mA cm−2, FF = 0.85, and η = 9.41%) reproduce very well the experimentally available data (VOC = 760 mV, JSC = 14.25 mA cm−2, FF = 0.75, and η = 8.08%), suggesting that the improved normal model is an accurate and general method to predict the photoelectric properties of organic dyes. More importantly, dyes 3 and 4 are predicted to exhibit extremely high PCEs of over 32%, both of which are expected to be potential candidates as metal-free organic dyes applied in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Over the last few decades, considerable attention has been paid to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) presenting excellent photovoltaic performances due to their low cost, high stability, and tunable optical properties such as color and transparency.1,2 Typically, a DSSC is mainly composed of the following components: photoelectrode, sensitizer (dye), electrolyte, and counter electrode. Among all these components in DSSCs, the sensitizer (dye) attracts special attention on account of its ability to convert light into electricity under photoexcitation.3 Upon introducing heavy-metal atoms such as zinc and ruthenium into sensitizers, DSSCs can achieve a photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11%, exhibiting high photovoltaic performance; however, these heavy-metal complexes face potential cost and toxicity issues.4–8
Metal-free organic dyes provide an alternative approach for developing highly efficient DSSC devices in view of their advantages like lower production cost, easy synthesis and purification, and multiple optoelectronic properties through suitable chemical modification.9–16 These pure organic dyes usually consist of electron donors (D), π-bridges, and electron acceptors (A), for example, with D–π–A, D–π–A–A or D–A–π–A configuration, and their excited states are of charge-transfer character. Owing to their strong electron-donating ability, indoline,17 carbazole,18 and triphenylamine19 have been considered as efficient D units, and electron-deficient aromatic molecules such as quinoxaline,20 benzoxidazole,21 and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine22 can be introduced as the A moieties. In addition, a π-bridge connecting the D and A segments plays a vital role in tuning the main photochemical properties of the dyes, regulating the energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals, and extending their optical absorption ranges. Various heteroaromatic compounds, such as thiophene,23 benzothiadiazole,24 or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene25 are excellent π-spacers, offering fine π-conjugation and good thermal stability. Based on these design rules, a vast variety of metal-free organic dyes have been developed.26–40
Recently, Tingare et al. designed and synthesized an anthracene-based D–π–A–A type organic dye (TY6), in which the carbon alkoxy-substituted diphenylamine group acts as the donor unit, the acetylene bridge linked at the axial 9,10-positions of the anthracene entity as the π-bridge, the benzotriazole group as the auxiliary acceptor moiety, and the benzoic acid as the acceptor/anchoring group.41 It was found that the DSSC device incorporating TY6 as the sensitizer exhibited excellent sensitizing capability and cell performance, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 14.25 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 760 mV, fill factor (FF) of 0.75, and the corresponding PCE efficiency (η) of 8.08% under a 1 sun (AM 1.5G) light source.41 More importantly, the sensitizer TY6 could achieve higher efficiencies of 20.72% and 28.56% under a 6000 lux light-emitting diode and a T5 fluorescent light source, respectively.41 Such outstanding photoelectric conversion performances of TY6 can be ascribed to its high JSC and VOC values.
On the theoretical aspect, identifying and benchmarking a protocol capable of precisely predicting the JSC, VOC, and FF, as well as the η for designing promising DSSC devices, still faces considerable challenges on account of the lack of a well-established model capable of estimating well the photovoltaic performances of the dye sensitizers as one of the most important components in DSSCs.42–46 In this work, we performed a systematic computational study on the optoelectronic properties of a series of anthracene-based organic dye molecules. Based on the dye TY6 synthesized experimentally, one new molecule (1) was designed by substituting the octyl chain in benzotriazole (BTZ) with an ethyl group and the branched dodecyl chains with two methyl groups. Such a structural simplification can not only reduce the computational cost, but also has a negligible influence on the optoelectronic properties. Accordingly, the calculated results for dye 1 can be directly compared with the experimentally available data for dye TY6. Altering the acetylene bridge to the 3,6-diethylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DETT) group with a stable and electron-rich structure gave dye molecule 2. Replacing the acetylene bridge with a dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DTDPP) group presenting strong electron deficiency and good planarity resulted in dye molecule 3. Such a design aims to explore the effect of different π-bridges on their structural and optical properties. Finally, we designed dye molecule 4 by inserting another auxiliary acceptor 2,3-bis(5-ethylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (BETTP) between the acetylene bridge and the BTZ group to further extend π-conjugation and reduce charge recombination as well as dye aggregation. The chemical structures of all dyes investigated in this work are shown in Scheme 1. We expect that the present calculations can provide a theoretical guide for developing novel high-efficiency organic dye sensitizers for application in DSSC devices.

2. Computational details
In the present work, the ground states of four targeted molecules were fully optimized in the gas phase by density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP47–49 hybrid functional along with a 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Frequency calculations were carried out at the same level of theory to ensure that all the structures obtained correspond to minima in the potential energy surfaces. In the ground-state geometries, their absorption spectra were simulated by time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) computations using the long-range corrected hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP50 and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The CAM-B3LYP functional provides a good description of the charge-transfer excitations.51–53 The polarizable continuum model (PCM)54,55 with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent was employed to account for the solvent effect. All the DFT and TD-DFT computations mentioned above were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package.56 Wavefunction analyses such as multicentered index and localized orbital locator (LOL) were implemented using the Multiwfn program.57
The adsorption of dye molecules onto the semiconductor TiO2 surfaces was simulated by means of vacuum slab models. The 2 × 6 × 6 TiO2 anatase (101) supercell58 was used for monomer adsorption. A vacuum buffer space of about 10 Å was set for slabs with adsorbed atoms and the dipole correction was applied to cancel artificial interactions between them.59 DFT calculations were carried out to optimize the dye@TiO2 complex structures based on the adsorption model, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).60,61 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)62 together with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional63 was employed for the exchange–correction potential in the VASP calculations. An energy cutoff of 400 eV was used and the optimization would be terminated when the force on each atom was smaller than 0.1 eV Å−1. The Grimme D2 dispersion correction was added to the functional to take into account dispersion effects. Furthermore, the total densities of states (TDOS) of the dye@TiO2 complex systems and the projected densities of states (PDOS) of the dyes and the TiO2 supercell were also calculated at the same level to deeply analyze the adsorption properties.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Frontier molecular orbitals of isolated dyes
For dye sensitizers, a rudimentary requirement is the appropriate energy level of the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) that ensures efficient electron injection from the LUMO to the TiO2 conduction band. Additionally, a suitable energy level of the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is also beneficial to electron collection at the electrode. The electron injection efficiency to the TiO2 conduction band and the electron collection efficiency at the electrode are two important factors in determining the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of DSSCs. Accordingly, it is of necessity to examine the nature of the frontier molecular orbital (FMO). Fig. 1 depicts the corresponding schematic FMO including the HOMO and LUMO as well as the values of energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) and energy gaps (Eg) between them obtained from the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) calculations for all isolated dye molecules. For a direct comparison, the energy of the TiO2 conduction band (−4.0 eV) and the redox potential of the iodide-based electrolyte (−4.8 eV for I−/I3−) are also given.
 Fig. 1  Energy diagram of the HOMO and LUMO for all isolated dyes calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory in tetrahydrofuran along with the energy levels of the TiO2 conduction band and the electrolyte. 
Among the four dyes considered here, the HOMOs are mainly localized on the amino donor and π-bridge, whereas the LUMOs are mainly distributed on the π-bridge moiety, the auxiliary acceptor segment, and the benzoic acid acceptor/anchoring group. Obviously, electron transition from HOMO to LUMO exhibits remarkable charge-transfer (CT) from the donor group to the acceptor/anchoring unit and very minor local-excitation (LE) on the central π-spacer. The amounts of CT and LE can be quantitatively evaluated by employing the multifunctional wavefunction analyzer (Multiwfn)57 and are reported in Table S1 (see ESI†). As expected, the amounts of CT for these four molecules are in the range of 0.836–0.991, which is in accordance with the above analysis.
It is also seen from Fig. 1 that the ELUMO levels of all four dyes are much higher than the energy of the TiO2 conduction band, which implies that the electrons of the photoexcited dyes can be rapidly injected into TiO2. Moreover, all the EHOMO levels are located below the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte, thereby ensuring efficient electron recovery. For dye 1, the EHOMO level is calculated to be −5.99 eV while the ELUMO position is at −1.52 eV (see Fig. 1). Changing the acetylene-bridge of 1 to a new π-bridge with the DETT group stabilizes the EHOMO level by about 0.08 eV thus dye 2 showing the EHOMO is located at −6.07 eV, whereas the ELUMO of 2 (−1.06 eV) is changed in the positive direction of 0.46 eV, in comparison to that of 1 (−1.52 eV). As a result, the Eg of 2 is larger by 0.54 eV than that of 1. Replacement of acetylene with another π-bridge featuring the DTDPP group stabilizes both the EHOMO and ELUMO levels. In particular, the ELUMO of 3 (−1.93 eV) decreases by 0.41 eV with respect to that of 1, thus resulting in a smaller Eg of the former (4.14 eV). Inserting the BETTP auxiliary acceptor between the acetylene bridge and the BTZ group of 1 destabilizes the EHOMO level by 0.17 eV, but stabilizes the ELUMO level by a relatively large value (0.52 eV). Consequently, dye 4 exhibits the smallest Eg of 3.78 eV. Such relatively small Eg-values in dyes 3 and 4 are expected to significantly broaden their absorption ranges and improve their light-harvesting efficiencies.
3.2 Absorption spectra of isolated dyes
In general, the greater absorption range of the dye is more conducive to absorb sunlight. Therefore, it is very necessary to explore the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the dye molecule. The absorption spectra of all isolated dye molecules were calculated at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory in combination with the PCM model using THF as the solvent, and the corresponding data are presented in Fig. 2 and Table S2 (see ESI†). Taking dye 1 as a representative, test calculations on the maximum absorption using five different functionals, B3LYP, PBE0, M06-2X, LC-BLYP, and CAM-B3LYP, were performed and the corresponding results are provided in Fig. S1 (see ESI†), together with the available experimental value of the reported analogue TY6 presenting the same molecular skeleton.41 It is apparent that B3LYP and PBE0 dramatically overestimate the maximum absorption wavelengths. However, the results predicted using M06-2X, LC-BLYP, and CAM-B3LYP are very close to the experimental value, with deviations between computational and experimental values of less than 0.2 eV. Considering the character of charge-transfer excitations in these dyes, the CAM-B3LYP functional is ultimately selected to simulate the optical properties of the present systems.
 Fig. 2  The UV/vis absorption spectra of all isolated dyes obtained by using the CAM-B3LYP functional coupled with the PCM model using THF as the solvent. 
As shown in Fig. 2, the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of dye 1 is predicted to be 493 nm, in good agreement with the available experimental one of 516 nm observed in dye TY6.41 Dye 2 exhibits a strong π–π* absorption band around 355 nm and a weak band around 429 nm assigned to the intramolecular-charge-transfer (ICT) transition from the amino donor to the benzoic acid acceptor. This clearly indicates that the π-conjugation of electron-rich DETT instead of the acetylene group induces a blue-shift of the maximum absorption band. The λmax of dye 3 is calculated to be located at 552 nm with the strongest oscillator strength (f) of 1.751 (see Table S2 of the ESI†), which means that transformation of acetylene to the DTDPP bridge gives rise to a red-shift of the maximum absorption band. Upon inserting the BETTP group between the acetylene and BTZ moieties of dye 1, the λmax of dye 4 is pronouncedly red-shifted by about 120 nm, compared with that of 1. Such a red-shift can be ascribed to the amelioration of ICT arising from the partial charge trapping generated by the introduced DTDPP bridge or the BETTP auxiliary acceptor. According to the present results, it is reasonable to speculate that the inclusion of electron-deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole-based DTDPP and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine-based BETTP groups can extend the absorption range of the dyes, thus dramatically increasing the utilization rate of solar energy and consequently enhancing the short-circuit photocurrent density of the devices.
3.3 Aromaticity of isolated dyes
Aromaticity, as one of the most fundamental concepts in heterocyclic chemistry, has been widely applied in numerous studies pertinent to organic dyes in DSSCs to reveal possible electron distribution and transfer pathways.53,64,65 In the present work, the aromaticity of all isolated dyes herein was estimated by virtue of the electron delocalization degree with the n-th root of the multicenter bond index (MCI1/n) based on the clockwise direction.66 In addition, a color-filled LOL-π plane pattern is also used to intuitively reveal the local feature and possible delocalization pathway.53 The calculated MCI1/n values and LOL maps for all four aromatic molecules are plotted in Fig. 3. The larger the MCI1/n, the stronger is the aromaticity of an aromatic ring, and the weaker is the tendency for electron delocalization and electron transfer.53 Meanwhile, contiguous portions with large LOL values (red and yellow portions) are responsible for the highly delocalized π orbital.
 Fig. 3  Graphical representation of the electron transfer using MCI1/n labeled on each ring (left column) and the color-filled pattern of LOL at a height of 0.5 Bohr over the conjugated plane (right column). 
Based upon the structure of dye 1, three aromatic rings, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP), are introduced into dyes 2–4, respectively, with the aromaticity following the order TT > TP > DPP, which suggests that there is a stronger tendency for electron delocalization in TP and DPP than in TT. Such a finding is further supported by their LOL diagrams. Electron transfer in dye 2 might not be as smooth as in other dye molecules in that the LOL of the C–C between anthracene and TT groups is significantly small with respect to the neighboring groups, which implies that the probability of electron transfer is lesser from anthracene to the adjacent TT ring. As demonstrated in the previous study, the conductance of a single molecule is negatively related to its aromaticity.67 Therefore, the reduced aromaticity in the TP and DPP rings may facilitate the ICT process of dyes 3 and 4 from the electron donor to acceptor segments. On the basis of the above analysis, it is plausible that dyes 3 and 4 may have better characteristics of electron delocalization and electron transfer, which is beneficial to decrease the electron injection time from the excited dye to the TiO2 film.
3.4 Adsorption of a single dye onto a TiO2 surface
It is known that the interface structure between the dye and semiconductor electrode (usually TiO2) plays an important role in exploring the interface energy alignment, thereby influencing the photovoltaic properties and cell performance of DSSC devices. In the present calculations, we used the (TiO2)144 supercell for monomer adsorption and the optimized dye molecule bound to the TiO2 substrate by employing the bidentate bridging mode, in which the two O atoms of the carboxylic group are bonded to two Ti atoms, and the protonated H atom in the hydroxyl group is transferred to the surface two-fold O atom. The optimized adsorption configurations for these four dyes are illustrated in Fig. 4. The bidentate bridging mode gives rise to stable adsorption configurations with adsorption energies (Eads) of −0.60, −3.10, −2.36, and −2.64 eV for dyes 1–4, respectively (see Table S3 of the ESI†). A negative adsorption energy indicates that these designed dyes can be stably adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, as found in our previous studies.68 Moreover, the more negative adsorption energies in dyes 2–4 are in relation to the involvement of more π-conjugated heteroaromatic groups with respect to dye 1, which leads to the charge redistribution of these dye molecules and is therefore favorable to the shortening of the electron injection time.
 Fig. 4  Monomer adsorption configuration for dye molecules 1 (a), 2 (b), 3 (c), and 4 (d) onto the TiO2 interface. 
The total density of states (TDOS) of the dye@(TiO2)144 complex systems and partial density of states (PDOS) of dyes and the (TiO2)144 supercell, as well as the DOS of clean (TiO2)144 before adsorption, have also been calculated, and are shown in Fig. 5. The computed LUMO energy level, the conduction band minimum (CBM), the driving forces for electron injection before (ΔGinj1) and after (ΔGinj2) adsorption on the surface of TiO2, and the electron injection time (τe) are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO energy levels of all designed dyes vary remarkably on account of the binding on TiO2 with respect to the isolated molecules. The estimated LUMO energy levels of all dyes locate above the CBM of the TiO2 substrate, thus guaranteeing sufficient driving forces for electron injection, and the ECBM is a crucial parameter in the calculation of VOC. In addition, the DOS of the clean (TiO2)144 and the PDOS of (TiO2)144 were computed to estimate the change in ECBM (ΔCB) when the dye is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, and ΔCB will also be used during the calculation of VOC. Furthermore, the ΔGinj2 values of all dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface are slightly larger than the ΔGinj1 before adsorption, which indicates that the inclusion of the TiO2 supercell can enhance the driving force for electron injection. As shown in Table 1, the τe values for all dyes increase in the order 3 (0.53 fs) < 4 (1.06 fs) < 2 (1.11 fs) < 1 (1.53 fs). It is clear that among the dyes considered here, dye 1 possesses the longest electron injection time, mainly due to the smallest energetic broadening and the least negative adsorption energy, which is in accordance with the above analysis.

3.5 Photovoltaic characterization of dyes
Photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) is one of the important factors that affect the performance of DSSC devices, which can be estimated using the following formula:69 (1)where VOC is the open-circuit voltage; JSC, the short-circuit photocurrent density; FF, the fill factor; and Pinc, the input power of incident solar light. Evidently, η is proportional to the JSC, VOC, and FF. Among the parameters in eqn (1), the JSC and VOC are two crucial factors determining the overall performance of solar cells.
In general, the JSC is largely dependent on the light-harvesting ability, which is directly associated with the optical absorption spectra of the dyes. The JSC can be written as:70 (2)where LHE is the light-harvesting efficiency; Φinj, the electron injection efficiency; ηreg, the dye regeneration efficiency; ηcoll, the electron collection efficiency; and φph.AM1.5G, the photon flux under AM 1.5G solar spectral irradiance.
The LHE depends on the dye absorption spectrum and dye loading on the TiO2 film electrode, which can be computed using the following expression:71 LHE(λ) = 1–10−ε(λ)Γ(3)where ε(λ) is the molar absorption coefficient, which can be obtained by TD-DFT calculations, and Γ is the dye loading amount, which is taken to be 300 nmol cm−2, referred to the experimental value.72
The Φinj and ηcoll can be evaluated as: (4) (5)where τinj is the electron injection lifetime from the excited dye to the TiO2 substrate, equal to the reciprocal of the electron injection rate obtained from the Marcus theory;73,74τrelax, the relaxation time for the excited state of the dye in solution (taking the experimental value of ∼10 ps);75τtrans, the electron transport time for electrons in TiO2 CB toward the electrode; and τrec, the electron recombination lifetime, equal to the reciprocal of the electron recombination rate also estimated by the Marcus theory. It should be mentioned that the ηcoll can be equivalent to 1 because of the extremely small electron recombination rate in the present systems. Given that the Φinj, ηreg, and ηcoll are arbitrarily set to 1, the maximum JSC can be gained. The simulated maximum JSC along with the LHE(λ) are shown in Fig. 6. The estimated electrochemical parameters for all dyes are listed in Table 2.

Concerning dye 1, the predicted JSC is 14.63 mA cm−2, much smaller than the maximum JSC (21.38 mA cm−2), which can be ascribed to the lower electron injection efficiency when calculating the JSC. As can be seen below, the JSC of 14.63 mA cm−2 for dye 1 reproduces very well the available experimental value of 14.25 mA cm−2 observed in dye TY6.41 Among the four dyes considered here, the JSC values are estimated to follow the order 2 (1.97 mA cm−2) < 1 (14.63 mA cm−2) < 3 (31.62 mA cm−2) < 4 (36.53 mA cm−2). This result is in good accordance with the order of the overlap between the absorption spectra of the dyes and sunlight irradiation spectra. It should be noted that dye 2 possesses a significantly small JSC, owing to its poor absorption under visible light. However, the broad absorption of dyes 3 and 4 results in a dramatic increase in the JSC values.

V
OC is defined as the difference between the electrolyte redox potential and the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in the TiO2 semiconductor, which can be estimated using the normal model (NM):76 (6)where ECBM denotes the CBM energy of the TiO2 substrate; Eredox, the reduction–oxidation potential of electrolyte (−5.04 eV for the standard redox potential of I−/I3−); ΔCB, the change of ECBM when the dyes are adsorbed on TiO2; NCB, the accessible density of CB states in TiO2; and nc, the number of injected electrons in TiO2 owing to dye adsorption. As a consequence, the VOC values based on the NM are obtained and presented in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3 that the VOC of dye 1 is calculated to be 1539 mV, about twice larger than the experimentally obtained value of 760 mV in the reported dye TY6.41 Obviously, the NM method dramatically overestimates the VOC value, which is due to the fact that it only considers the dye loads and surface dipole effects but overlooks the charge recombination contribution.42

When taking into account the charge recombination effects, the NM method in eqn (6) can be improved, resulting in the so-called improved NM (INM), which is expected to give a more reasonable estimation of the VOC. The VOC using the INM method can be calculated as:77 (7)where β′ is the charge transfer coefficient for recombination of electrons, which is taken to be 0.45, referred to the empirical value. R0 is the recombination resistance, which is defined as (8)where λ is the reorganization energy obtained from DFT calculations; d, the film thickness (taking the experiment value of 10 μm);72cox, the concentration of the acceptor species (I3−, ∼50 mmol L−1); NS, the constant related to the total number of surface states contributing to recombination (∼105); γ, the constant related to electron trap distribution below CB (∼0.3); and krec, the electron recombination rate. According to the INM method, the VOC results estimated using eqn (7) are given in Table 4. As expected, the predicted VOC of dye 1 is 757 mV, which matches well with the experimental value of dye TY6 (760 mV).41 The VOC values of all designed dyes increase in the order 2 (725 mV) < 1 (757 mV) < 4 (1026 mV) < 3 (1150 mV). It is apparent that in addition to the large JSC, dyes 3 and 4 also possess large VOC. This suggests that the INM can give an accurate estimation of the open-circuit voltage of organic dyes.

According to the photocurrent–photovoltage properties of solar cells, the I–V curve of DSSC can be plotted in the presence of known JSC and VOC: (9) (10)where IS denotes the reverse saturation current.

Fig. 7 presents the calculated I–V curves for all designed dyes based on the NM and INM methods, as well as the obtained experimental curve for dye TY6.41 As can be seen from Fig. 7, the I–V curve for dye 1 well reproduces that of dye TY6 by means of the INM method. By using the maximum output power divided by JSC and VOC, we obtained the fill factor (FF) of all four systems (see Table 4), which is equal to the ratio of Imax × Vmax/VOC × JSC, where Imax and Vmax are the maximum current and voltage, respectively.
 Fig. 7  The calculated I–V curves for all designed dyes according to the improved normal model (a) and normal model (b) along with the experimental curve.41 
Using eqn (1), the η values of all designed dyes are eventually obtained, which are 9.41%, 1.21%, 32.36%, and 32.98% for dyes 1–4, respectively (see Table 4). For dye 1, the η is well consistent with the experimental value of 8.08% observed in dye TY6 under 1 sun (AM 1.5G) illumination. It is worth noting that the η values of dyes 3 and 4 increase significantly with respect to that of dye 1, and very importantly, are more than twice larger than the minimum value required for commercial applications (15%).37 This clearly indicates that the introduction of an electron-deficient DTDPP π-bridge and a BETTP auxiliary acceptor can largely improve the photoelectric conversion efficiencies, and 3 and 4 are expected to be promising sensitizers applied in DSSCs. However, the η of dye 2 is extremely low, in comparison with that of dye 1, suggesting that the inclusion of the electron-rich DETT π-bridge group results in a dramatic decrease in the photoelectric conversion efficiency, which can be attributed to the poor light-harvesting efficiency resulting from the notably small short-circuit photocurrent density (1.97 mA cm−2).
4. Conclusions
Systematic theoretical estimation has been performed to investigate the photoelectric properties of four organic dyes 1–4 with the same amino donor and benzoic acid anchoring groups, and different π-bridge or auxiliary acceptor moieties. The frontier molecular orbitals and optical properties of all designed dyes have been calculated using DFT/TD-DFT computational methods. The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and the corresponding photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) have been estimated by the normal model (NM) and improved normal model (INM). The main conclusions are as follows:
(1) All the LUMO energy levels of these dyes lie above the TiO2 conduction band, ensuring rapid electron injection into TiO2. Meanwhile, all the HOMO energy levels are more negative than the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte, which is very favorable for efficient electron recovery.
(2) The maximum absorption wavelength of dye 1 is computed to be 493 nm, in excellent accordance with the available experimental value of 516 nm. The predicted λmax values of dyes 3 and 4 are 552 and 613 nm, respectively, showing significant bathochromic shifts with respect to dye 1.
(3) For dye 1, the JSC, VOC, FF, and η estimated using the INM method match very well the experimental findings, indicating that the INM method can give a good description of the photovoltaic properties of the present systems.
(4) The calculated η values of dyes 3 and 4 are 32.36% and 32.98%, respectively, much higher than that of dye 1 (9.41%), whereas the computed η of dye 2 is only 1.21%. This clearly suggests that the involvement of an electron-deficient π-bridge or an auxiliary acceptor group helps to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency; however, the inclusion of an electron-rich π-spacer may have an inverse influence on the photoelectric properties.
In conclusion, our newly designed organic dyes 3 and 4 showed high photovoltaic performance, and can be considered as potential organic materials in DSSC devices. The present study not only well reproduces the experimental observation but also provides the first accurate prediction of the photovoltaic parameters in the newly designed organic dyes. This may stimulate the research interest of experimentalists and theorists in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells.
