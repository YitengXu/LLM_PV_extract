    , Accepted 26th February 2020First published on 2nd March 2020AbstractCesium (Cs)–formamidinium (FA)–methylammonium (MA) triple cation-based perovskite materials have led to the most efficient and stable perovskite solar cells reported. However, most studies focused on the relationship between crystal structure distortion and efficiency. Herein, the role of cations that have been neglected all the time is emphasized firstly in the nanoscale model by state-of-the-art simulation combining static, ab initio dynamic and nonadiabatic molecular dynamic simulations. Considering the influence of Cs sites, the structural robustness is confirmed and the structurally related stability is not very sensitive to the position of Cs cations. Upon heating at 298 K, Cs cations can suppress halide redistribution and phase separation. The detailed time-domain atomistic analysis of charge carrier dynamics indicates that the electron–hole recombination time of 5% Cs systems is slower as the values of nonadiabatic coupling are smaller (sub-1.5 meV) and the coherence time is shorter (sub-10 fs). These results promote the comprehensive understanding of the influence of cations on perovskite materials and pave the way to further increasing the efficiency of perovskite-enabled photovoltaic materials.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention because their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased from an initial 3.8% to a certified 23.3%.1–3 This remarkable performance stems from a tunable band gap by cation or halide substitution,4,5 a high absorption coefficient,6 long charge-carrier lifetimes,7 high carrier mobility,8 and low exciton binding energy.9 These superior properties also enable PSCs to be applied in other areas, such as light-emitting diodes,10–14 optically pumped lasers15–18 and high-gain photodetectors.19 Although PSCs possess various properties for photovoltaic applications, some challenges need to be overcome: for example, long-term stability under ambient conditions. Compositional engineering therefore emerged as a potential way to provide higher stability without sacrificing the PCE.20–23
To date, composition engineering of perovskite materials can be roughly understood via two strategies: mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskites.24–26 Traditional MAPbI3 materials show poor water-oxygen and thermal stability.27 Although α-FAPbI3 demonstrates a higher stability, it suffers from a phase transition to a yellow non-perovskite δ phase at room temperature.28 As a significant milestone, Seok et al. witnessed that the substitution of FAPbI3 by MAPbBr3 produced α-phase perovskites at low temperature.21 However, for mixed cation and mixed halide perovskites, the light stability is poor because mixed halides (Br and I anions) tend to undergo segregation under full sun illumination.29,30 This influence can be minimised by introducing small inorganic cesium (Cs) ions.31,32
Triple (Cs/FA/MA) cation-based PSCs display an average PCE fairly exceeding 20% and stability against long time exposure to ambient atmosphere.31,33–35 More recently, Correa-Baena and co-workers reported that the morphology of the Cs/MA/FA perovskite with ambient air condition is highly affected by the Cs concentration.36 It turns out that Cs cations are beneficial at low concentrations (5%) where they homogenize the halide distribution, but at higher concentrations (10%) they form recombination-active second-phase clusters.36,37 Other works also reported the same conclusion, for example a highly sensitive direct X-ray detector based on 5% Cs-based triple cation mixed halide perovskite thin films was achieved.38 Lang et al. reported that the radiation hardness of 5% Cs perovskite are even stronger than SiC, when employing 20 and 68 MeV proton irradiation. This is attributed to a reduction of charge recombination.39 Furthermore, Tsai et al. produced high-efficiency perovskite solar cells via precise component FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 to reduce the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces.40
In these previous works, 5% Cs concentration of FA/MA/Cs cation-based perovskite materials was proved to be the optimum concentration in terms of the stability and efficiency of devices compared to other concentrations. However, the role of 5% Cs cations at the atomic scale has not been understood so far. Herein, the FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 component is adopted to explore mechanistic comprehension for the influence of 5% Cs on the perovskite devices by a combination of static, ab initio dynamic and nonadiabatic molecular dynamic (NAMD) simulations. Various possible configurations with different arrangements of MA, FA and Cs are considered to probe the role of organic molecules. For obtaining insights into the atomic-scale dynamical processes of the PbI framework, organic cations are also supplied at room temperature. Notably, the NAMD simulations demonstrated that the nonradiative electron–hole recombination in FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 occurs at the nanosecond scale. These simulated results not only rationalize the effect of 5% Cs concentration on inorganic framework distortion, thermodynamic stability and electron–hole recombination, but also provide guidelines to improve the performance of perovskite materials.
2. Computational details
Geometry optimization and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations are performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).41 The generalized gradient approximation with the functional described by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) is applied to treat the electron exchange correlation energy.42 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method is employed to depict the electron–nuclear interactions.43 The semiempirical DFT-D2 method is used to account for the van der Waals corrections.44 A kinetic energy cutoff is set to 400 eV and the Brillouin zone is sampled using a single Γ point. Structural optimization is considered to be converging which was less than 10–4 eV in energy. To simulate the impact of mixed A-cations (MA, FA and Cs), a sufficiently large 4 × 4 × 4 supercell (64 ABX3 units) of the parent MAPbI3 cubic phase is chosen. For the CsMAFA perovskite configurations, the molar ratio of Cs:MA:FA is 3:16:45 is close to mimic the experimental composition. Tsai and co-workers also found that FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 caused a uniform lattice expansion under continuous light illumination, corresponding to an isotropic increase in lattice constant from 6.290 ± 0.002 to 6.330 ± 0.004 Å.40 Light-induced lattice expansion has been shown to be beneficial for the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the PCE from 18.5 to 20.5%. Here, due to the substitution of FA and Cs with MA cations, the optimized lattice constant of FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 becomes 6.330 Å (Table S1†), which is in agreement with the experimental value.
After relaxing the geometry, the NVT ensemble is utilized to bring the temperature of the system to 298 K to investigate finite temperature effects. Then, a 5 ps AIMD trajectory is generated in the microcanonical ensemble with a 1 fs time step. The dynamics of the excited electrons are studied on the basis of ab initio nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics simulations combined with TDDFT and the Fewest Switches Surface Hopping (FSSH) applying Hefei-NAMD code.45–49 Non-radiative electron–hole simulations are obtained by averaging over 100 different initial configurations. For each selected structure, 2 × 104 NAMD trajectories with a length of 1 ps are sampled. A detailed description of the method and its implementation can be found.50–52
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of Cs content
It is well known that the effective tolerance factor (t) value is an empirical index for predicting the stable crystal structures of various perovskite materials.53 The perovskite tends to present an orthorhombic structure when t < 0.8 and a cubic structure when 0.8 < t < 1. Furthermore, for perovskite material absorbers, the value of t with the best performance is around 0.94–0.98.54,55 In this work, the FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 component is chosen due to its moderate tolerant factor (t = 0.959) and excellent electrical performance40 (calculational details in the ESI†). The effective tolerance factor shown here can be a simple figure of merit to roughly predict the stable structure of the mixed cation perovskite (Fig. S1†). Compared with other Cs ratios, such as 3%, 8% and 10%, adding 5% Cs to MA/FA mixtures exhibits an effective tolerance factor of around 0.96 and suppresses yellow phase impurities.31,56
To illustrate the roles played by Cs components, simulations of the 2%, 5% and 8% Cs perovskite structures are conducted (Fig. S2†). As the Cs content increases, the lattice volume of FA0.7MA0.25−xCsxPbI3 (x = 0.02, 0.05 and 0.08) reduces, in agreement with X-ray diffraction studies.36,40 More excitingly, the band gap of 2% and 8% Cs configurations obtained at the Γ-point is lower than that of the 5% Cs structure (Table S1†). It means that 2% and 8% Cs perovskites may undergo easier electron–hole recombination. The band gap reduction is mainly achieved by shifting the conduction band minima. The charge density shows that the valence band maxima (VBM) consists of the antibonding hybrids of Pb and I states, whereas the conduction band minima (CBM) is composed mostly of the Pb state (Fig. S2†). It can be seen that CBM changes caused by different Cs contents are very obvious. When the Cs ratio is 5%, it owns a suitable band gap and less overlap between the VBM and CBM, thereby reducing the overlap of electrons and holes. These results rationalize how 5% Cs exhibits excellent carrier migration behavior at the atomic level.
3.2. A-cation arrangement in perovskites
In order to explore the influence of the relative arrangements of cations in FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3, various geometries with different orderings of FA, MA and Cs cations are created. In Fig. 1a, we can find that the difference in ground-state energy among the calculated structures is very large (the maximum value reaches 2.37 eV). Therefore, the relative positions of MA, FA and Cs cations have a significant impact on the stability of the structure (for details see the ESI†). The arrangement of three cations in the Pb/I inorganic cages can be divided into two categories: random and ordered. To investigate both possibilities, FAMACs-R (random alignment) and FAMACs-O (ordered alignment) which both are energetically favored configurations are obtained as shown in Fig. 1a. The results of optimized geometries reveal the relationship between the relative positions of MA, FA and Cs cations: (1) no matter with the gathered Cs cations or dispersed Cs cations, very stable structures with almost no difference in energy can always be obtained. This indicates that the stability of the ternary cation mixtures is not very sensitive to the position of Cs in the lattice. (2) Although Cs sites have little influence on the structural stability, the position of other cations around Cs plays a vital role. When Cs cations are surrounded by a MA:FA molar ratio of 2:4 (Fig. 1b and c), the configuration is more advantageous, resulting in a more suitable lattice match. Moreover, as a consequence of the FA/Cs/MA ion size mismatch (2.53 Å/1.69 Å/2.17 Å), the inorganic PbI6 octahedra exhibit different tilts.57 Atomic displacements of Pb and I atoms in FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O are collected in Fig. 1d and e. The mixed cations lead to local geometric distortion especially for I atoms in the proximity of Cs cations.

The mixed organic cations have been associated with geometric distortion and have led to different localizations of the valence and the conduction band-edge states. The density of states (DOS) for FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O systems is calculated at 0 K using the optimized geometries (Fig. 2a). The valence band is dominated by the atomic orbitals of iodine near the Fermi level, while the conduction band is mainly attributed to the atomic orbitals of Pb. The VBM and CBM are separated by a wide band gap of 1.54 eV, agreeing well with the experimental value of 1.56 eV.40

The electron density is shown in yellow and the value of the isosurface is 1.5 × 10–4e Å−3. 
Generally, the relative energies and chemical bonding character of the band edges directly affect charge separation, influencing their efficiency as perovskite solar cell devices.58 Thus, the VBM and CBM charge densities are considered to investigate the effect of MA, FA and Cs distributions on electronic properties (Fig. 2b and d and S4†). For FAMACs-R, the VBM is dispersedly delocalized onto lead and iodine atoms, and the CBM is distributed on lead atoms, while for FAMACs-O, owing to large I displacements between MA and FA, the VBM is localized at iodine atoms away from Cs atoms and the CBM is attributed by lead atoms around Cs atoms. Overall, the result suggests that the electron density of the band edges can be tuned by arranging the relative position of FA, MA and Cs. This modification in the VBM and CBM can modulate the band offset between perovskite and charge transport layers, facilitating the separation and transfer of charge-carriers.
3.3. Thermodynamic stability
Temperature also affects the dynamic interactions and the motion of the inorganic Pb/I cage and the organic cations. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O are therefore performed at 298 K. Fig. 3 presents two-dimensional (2D) volumetric maps for the probability of MA, FA and Cs cations occupying in space over the time scale of the simulation. At 0 K, MA groups in pristine MAPbI3 align along the [111] direction and FA cations in parent FAPbI3 align along the [100] direction within the inorganic cages.59,60 Upon heating to 298 K, MA and FA cations in its parent phase explore full conformational space inside the inorganic cage. This disordered cation dynamics is consistent with the motion of FA and MA cations in FAMACs-R. In contrast, for FAMACs-O the cations exhibit constrained reorientational dynamics in which the C–N molecular axis of MA preferentially rotates in the yz-crystal plane and the N–N molecular axis of FA aligns along the high-symmetry directions ([100], [001] and [111]). Furthermore, the adjacent FA cations of Cs are oriented along the elongated direction of the distorted cages. These arrangements allow hydrogen atoms to approach iodines, form hydrogen bonds, and stabilize the organic–inorganic hybrid structure. Although cations do not mainly contribute to the VBM and CBM, they perturb the Pb–I sublattice and affect the electron–hole coupling indirectly.

As compared to the optimized geometries, the inorganic Pb–I framework shows distortion at room temperature. The distortion of the PbI6 octahedra has been reported in inelastic X-ray scattering experiments and DFT-based computations, the energy barrier for octahedral tilting is only a few meV in these mechanically soft perovskites, and consequently, these oscillations are thermally active at room temperature.61 The 2D volumetric map for the inorganic framework of FAMACs-O shows that iodine atoms oscillate about equilibrium positions in a regular cubic lattice (Fig. S5†). In contrast, the FAMACs-R exhibits significant spatial distribution of iodine atoms away from the cubic lattice sites. It increases the probability of H atoms close to the electronegative iodide anions, enhancing the lattice–molecule interactions through stronger hydrogen-bonding.
At room temperature, FAMACs-R with mixed cations leads to a larger iodide atomic displacement than FAMACs-O with ordered cations (Fig. S6†). Notably, due to different Cs distributions, the perovskite lattice gets distorted in two distinct ways: FAMACs-R tilts the PbI6 octahedra (OT) and FAMACs-O contracts the lattice isotropically (LC). For the FAMACs-R with OT system, the average titling angle of the PbI6 octahedra in the xy plane is 15.3° and the elongation of the Pb–I bond is 0.035 Å at 298 K. In the case of the FAMACs-R of LC system, the average Pb–I distance is 3.235 Å at 0 K, while it becomes 3.194 Å at 298 K, decreasing the lattice constant by 0.5 Å. Fig. 4 shows the structural rearrangements of the inorganic framework around Cs cations to clarify the lattice contraction and octahedral tilting. The change of inorganic rearrangements is smaller than that previously reported in FA1−xCsxPbI3.26,62
 Fig. 4  Representation of structural rearrangements in the inorganic framework around Cs cations. Yellow arrows reveal the direction of rigid rotation of the octahedra and the displacements that have taken place. 
The fluctuations of the Pb–I bond lengths alter the chemical bonding of the inorganic cage further, determining the electrostatic interaction. Hence, the electronic properties of FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O are considered (Fig. S7†). The former raises the band gap while the latter one decreases it, owing to their different distortion of inorganic cages (Table S2†). As the Pb–I orbital overlap is a σ* interaction, the adjustment in the Pb–I–Pb angles reduces the degree of overlap between the Pb and I tracks, competing with any effect of the distance reduction. The result is that the VBM moves to a slightly lower energy. Similar modifications in the electronic properties of FA1−xCsxPbI3 have been reported by experimental spectroscopy studies.63 In addition, since the thermal fluctuation further promotes the movement of the organic atoms, the PbI6 cages farther away from Cs undergoes a larger displacement. So, the CBM of two systems are contributed by these atoms away from Cs cations (Fig. S7b and d†). This localization is mediated by thermally induced dynamic disorder of the anharmonic perovskite lattice, as was observed in experiment.64
3.4. Electron–hole recombination dynamics
Further investigation of how dynamic disorder influences charge delocalization and recombination in mixed cations can provide ongoing efforts to understand and control charge-carrier dynamics. Here, a 5 ps MD simulation is carried out to achieve the evolution of the holes and electrons as illustrated in Fig. 5. The charge densities of the simulation are delocalized in band-edge states, as expected from a vertical excitation from the neutral ground state. Upon time evolution, the electrons and holes displayed instantaneous localization in distinct spatial regions. In the LC system of FAMACs-O, the holes and electrons are localized on perpendicular planes. For the OT system of FAMACs-R, both charge densities are found to be localized on parallel planes. Such charge distribution reduces the VBM–CBM overlap, which in turn decreases non-adiabatic (NA) coupling, and facilitates a long-lived excited state lifetime. The evolution with frequent hopping from plane to plane indicates that steady state conditions are obtained on the timescale of the simulations.65 This confirms that the structural configurations are representative and can be used for NAMD calculations to examine how the relative localization of the holes and electrons influences the recombination.

In NAMD simulations, the electron transfer probability can be written as:66 (1)
where H is the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian, φk, φj, εk and εj are the corresponding wave functions and eigenvalues for electronic states k and j, while Ṙ is the velocity of nuclear motions.  can be understood as the electron–phonon coupling elements, and both elastic and inelastic electron–phonon scattering affects the excited-state lifetime.59,60,62 Inelastic scattering produces the NA electron–phonon coupling and accommodates the electronic energy lost during the electronic transition from the CBM to the VBM. The values of NA electron–phonon coupling in FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O are 0.69 and 0.96 meV, respectively. While elastic scattering decomposes quantum coherence is formed between the VBM and CBM, characterized by the pure-dephasing time of the optical response theory.67Fig. 6a displays the pure-dephasing functions calculated in optical response theory by the secondary cumulant approximation.67,68 The pure-dephasing times τ are fitted to the functions with a Gaussian (exp(−0.5(t/τ)2)) and the time is very short (4.8 and 5.9 fs). The pure-dephasing time for the FAMACs-R (OT) is shorter than that of the FAMACs-O (LC) due to the faster atomic motions. Moreover, the sub-10 fs coherence time is conducive to the long charge carrier lifetimes in the hybrid perovskite, which can be considered as a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect.69–71

To probe the origin of the phonon-induced pure-dephasing time between the two systems further, the unnormalized autocorrelation functions (un-ACF) of the VBM–CBM energy gap fluctuations of the two systems are computed (inset of Fig. 6a). FAMACs-R (OT) and FAMACs-O (LC) attenuate on similar time scales, and the difference in pure-dephasing time results from the un-ACF initial values, Cij(0). The reason is that the VBM and CBM on different atoms permit the VBM and CBM energies to fluctuate independently with respect to each other, resulting in different band gap fluctuations.72 The un-ACF initial value of FAMACs-R (OT) system is slightly higher, reveals that elastic electron-phonon scattering is slightly stronger and rationalized why the pure-dephasing time is shorter.

Fig. 6b illustrates the evolution of the excited state populations during the nonradiative electron–hole recombination in two systems. In this work, because mixed perovskites require a large number of atoms (747 atoms), our currently available computational capacity only allows us to carry out the last 1 ps trajectories in adiabatic MD for NAMD simulation. The recombination times of FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O fitted by an exponential function P(t) = exp(−t/τ) are 1.38 and 1.07 ns, respectively. The data are in agreement with the experimental carrier lifetimes ranging from tens of picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds experimental value.64,73–75 Different arrangements of cations in FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 have little effect on the recombination, as the difference of band gap is small. Symmetry breaking separates the electron and hole while obtaining shorter coherence times. These results rationalize the high stability and efficiency of mixed-cation perovskite solar cells in experiments.
4. Conclusions
As the influence of 5% Cs concentration on the structure, optoelectronic properties, and carrier migrations of mixed A-site cation perovskites was not fully understood at the atomic scale, the mixed cation system FA0.7MA0.25Cs0.05PbI3 is investigated utilizing a combination of static, ab initio dynamic and nonadiabatic molecular dynamic calculations. Although the Cs cation is indispensable, the PCE related performance of the ternary cation mixtures is not very sensitive to its position in the lattice. Both random and ordered arrangements of cations can be obtained in energetically favored configurations (FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O). For FAMACs-R, the VBM is totally delocalized onto lead and iodine atoms, while the CBM is distributed on lead atoms. In case of FAMACs-O, the VBM is localized at iodine between MA and FA, and the CBM is attributed by lead atoms around Cs atoms. Upon heating at room temperature, the electronic properties of two systems are altered due to different arrangements of the A-cations. The inorganic Pb–I framework shows different distortion: FAMACs-R tilts the PbI6 octahedra and FAMACs-O contracts the lattice isotropically. The former raises the band gap while the latter decreases it. In addition, thermal fluctuation further promotes the movement of the organic atoms, and the PbI6 cages farther away from Cs undergo a larger displacement. This indicates that Cs cations can stabilize the inorganic framework in hybrid lead halide perovskites at room temperature. Upon time evolution, the electrons and holes of FAMACs-R and FAMACs-O exhibited instantaneous localization in distinct spatial regions. The simulations of ab initio NA molecular dynamics show that lattice contraction of FAMACs-O increases the coherence time slightly and octahedral tilting decreases the NA coupling and coherence time. Overall, the recombination times of two systems are slow due to the smaller NA coupling (sub-1.5 meV), and the shorter coherence time (sub-10 fs). This detailed time-domain atomistic analysis of charge carrier dynamics advances our comprehension of the key factors governing the unique properties of hybrid lead halide perovskites. Overall, adding a certain percentage of the Cs to MA/FA mixture can maximize all the advantages of triple cations to pave the way for the industrialization of PSCs.
