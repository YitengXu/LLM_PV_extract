    , Accepted 21st December 2015First published on 22nd December 2015AbstractA series of terminal dicyanovinylene (DCV)-substituted S,N-heterohexacenes with variable lengths of alkyl chains were synthesized and characterized for application in vacuum-processed planar-heterojunction and bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells. X-ray single crystal analysis of hexyl-substituted derivative 4 revealed that the molecules are ordered in columns via π–π-stacking. While the influence of the alkyl chain length is negligible on the optoelectronic properties, an odd–even effect was observed with respect to the photovoltaic performance. Vacuum-processed planar-heterojunction organic solar cells prepared using DCV-substituted S,N-heterohexacenes as electron donors and C60 as the acceptor showed extraordinary high efficiencies of up to 5.0%. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells incorporating pentyl derivative 3 and C60 led to excellent power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.1% exceeding those of previously reported S,N-heteropentacenes.
Introduction
In the last decade, great progress has been made in the field of organic solar cells induced by both, the development of new organic semiconductors and the optimization of device fabrication, leading to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 10% for solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells utilizing either polymeric or oligomeric donor materials.1–14 Despite the high efficiencies obtained in both classes, oligomers, often referred to as “small molecules”, exhibit various benefits towards their polymer counterparts such as high reproducibility of both, syntheses and devices, due to their defined and monodisperse structure.15–17 An additional advantage of oligomers is that they can be processed by thermal evaporation techniques,18 which avoids the application of toxic and environmentally hazardous chlorinated solvents frequently used for the preparation of solution-processed solar cells. Effective vacuum-processed single junction cells with high PCEs were achieved by, e.g., implementing sexithiophene in combination with subphthalocyanines in planar-heterojunction (PHJ) structures,19 and unsymmetrical donor (D)–acceptor (A) oligomers comprising strong dipole moments,20–23 or symmetrical A–D–A oligomers in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures.18,24–33 Furthermore, processing by thermal evaporation allows the deposition of highly pure and well-defined layers which is beneficial for the construction of multilayered solar cells, e.g., tandem or triple cells.34 In this respect, vacuum-processed triple cells with a certified PCE of 12.0% were recently reported by us35 and with 11.1% by Forrest and co-workers.36
In our search and development of novel strong absorbers and organic semiconductors, we recently introduced a series of S,N-heteroacenes consisting of fused thiophene–pyrrole rings as a novel class of materials. These heteroacenes can be regarded as nitrogen-bridged oligothiophenes and are therefore highly planarized and rigidified. By combining the high stability of oligothiophenes and the favorable physical properties of acenes, they showed largely increased extinction coefficients compared to the non-bridged counterparts.37 Acceptor-functionalized S,N-heteropentacenes (SN5) were implemented in different types of organic and hybrid organic solar cells and achieved efficiencies of 6.5% in vacuum-38 and 4.9% in solution-processed solar cells.39 Furthermore, fine-tuned derivatives of this SN5-type showed promise as hole transporters and absorbers in perovskite solar cells achieving PCEs up to 16.9%.40–42
In the continuation of this approach to S,N-heteroacenes, we elongated the conjugated π-system to S,N-heterohexacenes43 by replacing the middle thiophene core of S,N-heteropentacenes by the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit. Recently, Wong and co-workers reported efficiencies of up to 3.0% in vacuum-processed organic solar cells incorporating a DCV end-capped S,N-heterohexacene comprising branched alkyl side chains as the donor material.44 Furthermore, for the DCV-substituted S,N-heterohexacene good charge carrier mobilities of up to 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been measured in organic field effect transistors (OFET)43 underlining the concept that incorporation of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units in oligomers45,46 or polymers47,48 leads to high charge carrier mobilities. McCulloch's group reported efficient donor–acceptor polymers for organic solar cells using a hexafused building block, which comprised a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene core, resulting in PCEs of up to 5.5% in solution-processed BHJ solar cells.49
In this contribution, we now report the synthesis, characterization, and photovoltaic properties of a series of DCV end-capped S,N-heterohexacenes, in which the length of the alkyl chains attached to the nitrogen bridges is varied. Thermal properties, such as the melting point and decomposition temperature, and photovoltaic properties are distinctly influenced by the length of the alkyl side chains, while the optical and electrochemical properties remain almost unaffected due to the identical conjugated backbone. 5.0% efficiency for PHJ solar cells is one of the highest values reported for vacuum-deposited planar-heterojunction solar cells. Device optimization of vacuum-processed BHJ solar cells based on S,N-heterohexacenes with pentyl side chains as donors and fullerene C60 as the acceptor resulted in excellent power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.1%.
Synthesis
The synthesis of novel A–D–A-type fused S,N-heterohexacenes 1–5 is outlined in Scheme 1. Parent SN6-systems 7–11 were obtained in good yields (49–74%) by Buchwald–Hartwig amination of literature-known tetrabromo derivative 6 with different alkyl amines in the presence of Pd(dba)2 as a catalyst, dppf as a ligand, and sodium tert-butoxide as a base. Subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of heterohexacenes 7–11 gave corresponding dialdehydes 12–16 in excellent yields of 86–98%. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of dialdehydes 12–16 with malononitrile and ammonium acetate provided DCV end-capped target S,N-heterohexacenes 1–5 in 89–93% yields.

Thermal properties
For the construction of organic solar cells prepared by vacuum-deposition all compounds should possess high thermal stability. Therefore, the melting (Tm) and decomposition temperatures (Td) of 1–5 were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 1a) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 1b) under an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The Tm values increased with the decreasing length of alkyl side chains indicating strong intermolecular interactions of the molecules in the solid state. TGA measurements confirmed the high thermal stability of S,N-heterohexacenes reflected by Td values of 447.9 °C for 1, 428.6 °C for 2, 411.2 °C for 3, 382.6 °C for 4, and 371.1 °C for 5 determined from the onset value of the degradation process.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 depicts the optical properties of pentyl derivative 3 as an example studied by UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy in dichloromethane solution. The data of all derivatives are listed in Table 1. In solution, all compounds 1–5 displayed a strong absorption band between 400 and 620 nm with a maximum at 588 nm and a shoulder at around 547 nm corresponding to an intramolecular charge-transfer transition. The high extinction coefficient of 160000 M−1 cm−1 for heptyl- and hexyl-substituted SN6 derivatives 4 and 5 qualified them as interesting absorbers in vacuum-processed solar cells. The extinction coefficient of oligomers 1–3 could not be determined due to their low solubility. Compared to the shorter homologues DCV-SN350 and DCV-SN5,38,39 the red-shift and intensification of the absorption of DCV-SN6 1–5 are explained by the elongation of the ring-fused backbone. All derivatives 1–5 showed emission maxima at 628 nm and a shoulder at 678 nm. Because of the planarized molecular backbone Stokes shifts of around 840 to 980 cm−1 were observed for 1–5 indicating a similar geometry in the ground and the first excited state. Lack of differences in the absorption and emission spectra of S,N-heterohexacenes 1–5 suggests that the length of the alkyl side chains has negligible influence on the optical properties in solution.

In thin films, all S,N-heterohexacenes 1–5 displayed two prominent absorption maxima at 596 nm and 643 nm, which are 50 nm red-shifted compared to the spectra in solution (Fig. 2b). This bathochromic shift in thin film absorption can be explained by coplanarization and ordering of the molecules in the bulk suggesting good packing in thin films. The thin film absorption spectra of heterohexacenes 1–5 become slightly broadened and red-shifted (Δλ ≤ 9 nm) with the decreasing length of the alkyl side chains.
Electrochemical measurements were performed in order to determine HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels. Fig. 3 depicts a cyclic voltammogram of oligomer 5 as an example which was measured in 1,2-dichloroethane at 65 °C and the data of derivatives 3–5 are summarized in Table 1. Heterohexacene 5 exhibited two reversible one-electron oxidation waves at 0.56 V and 1.08 V vs. Fc/Fc+ corresponding to the formation of stable radical cations and dications. In the reductive regime, one irreversible two-electron reduction wave at around −1.38 V vs. Fc/Fc+ was found. The first oxidation potential of alkylated S,N-heterohexacene 5 is slightly shifted to a lower potential by 0.05 V compared to alkylated S,N-heteropentacenes.38 The reason for this lowering in oxidation potential is the extension of the conjugated π-system by an additional fused thiophene ring. The cyclic voltammograms of oligomers 1 and 2 could not be measured due to their limited solubility.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram of DCV-SN6-derivative 5 measured in dichloroethane at 65 °C, supporting electrolyte TBAPF6 (0.1 M), scan rate 100 mV s−1, potentials versus Fc/Fc+ at r.t. 
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of oligomers 3–5 were calculated from the onset values of the first oxidation and reduction waves applying the standard approximation that the Fc/Fc+ energy level corresponds to −5.1 eV versus vacuum. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of S,N-heterohexacenes 3–5 were around −5.6 eV and −3.8 eV, respectively, and are basically unaffected by the length of the alkyl side chains which is in agreement with the optical properties. Due to the low-lying HOMO energies of the DCV-SN6 derivatives high open-circuit voltages (VOC) are expected in organic solar cells upon using C60 as the acceptor. VOC is typically estimated from the difference of the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and HOMO energy level of the donor minus certain offsets.51,52
X-Ray structure analysis
Fractionated sublimation of DCV-SN6 4 gave blue crystalline needles, which were suitable for single crystal X-ray structure analysis. DCV-SN6 4 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c with four equivalent molecules in the unit cell (a = 4.94184(3), b = 32.8876(2), c = 19.72071(13) Å; α = 90°, β = 96.1585(6)°, γ = 90°) (Fig. 4c). Reduced bond length alternation with an averaged difference of 0.025 Å was observed for the conjugated backbone of DCV-SN6 4. The hexyl chains of each molecule, one of which showed weak polymorphism, are directed out of plane in the opposite direction of the planar conjugated backbone (Fig. 4a and b). Along the a-axis, the molecules are ordered in columns via π–π-stacking at distances as short as 3.319 Å (Table 2 and Fig. 4b, blue lines). Furthermore, the molecules of DCV-SN6 4 interact in the plane with three neighbour molecules via N–H interactions between the cyano nitrogen and vinylic proton as well as via multiple N–S interactions (Fig. 4d and Table 2, red and green lines, respectively).

J–V characteristics (a) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (b) of the optimized BHJ solar cells prepared using 1–5 as donors and C60 as the acceptor (active layer thickness 30 nm). 
Photovoltaic properties
Firstly, we fabricated vacuum-processed PHJ solar cells comprising selective absorber materials 1, 3, and 5 using the following layer sequence: ITO/C60 (15 nm)/donor (6 nm, RT)/BPAPF (10 nm)/BPAPF:NDP9 (45 nm, 9.9 wt%)/ NDP9 (1 nm)/Au (50 nm). The cells utilize organic molecular p-doping (NDP9), which results in loss-free charge extraction to the metal electrode (see the Experimental section for details).53
All devices exhibited high open-circuit voltages (VOC) of around 0.95 V due to the low-lying HOMO energy levels of the DCV-SN6 derivatives 1, 3, and 5 (Table 3). Propyl derivative 1 showed the highest efficiency of 5.0% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 7.8 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor (FF) of 67.9%. Further increase in the alkyl chain length from propyl to pentyl to heptyl led to a concomitant reduction in the JSC value which resulted in the lowering of the PCE from 5.0% for propyl 1 to 4.7% for pentyl 3 and 4.3% for heptyl derivative 5. The 5.0% efficiency shown here represents one of the highest values reported for vacuum-deposited planar-heterojunction solar cells.25,27,30 On the other hand, the FF slightly increased with the increasing length of the alkyl side chains. The better JSC value for 1 can be ascribed to a smaller sterical hindrance offered by the shorter alkyl chains. The reasonably high JSC and FF values indicate efficient separation of generated excitons at the D:A interface and transport to the respective electrodes. This was further supported by the higher saturation of photocurrent (defined as J(−1 V)/JSC) indicating a decrease of field-dependent recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.

BHJ solar cells with DCV-SN6 1–5 as donors and C60 as the acceptor in a m-i-p-type (metal-intrinsic-p-doped) architecture were prepared by co-evaporation of both compounds at a substrate temperature of 90 °C. For all devices, the following layer sequence was employed: ITO/ C60 (15 nm)/DCV-SN6 1–5:C60 (20/30 nm, 2:1)/BPAPF (10 nm)/BPAPF:NDP9 (45 nm, 10 wt%)/NDP9 (1 nm)/Au (50 nm).
The solar cell parameters of DCV-SN6 1–5 prepared at a substrate temperature of 90 °C with absorber layer thicknesses of 20 and 30 nm, respectively, are presented in Table 4. Their current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5a. Characteristic of all S,N-heterohexacenes 1–5, the devices containing a 20 or 30 nm active layer showed high VOCs of 0.94 V to 0.97 V for 2–5, except for 1 with a VOC of 0.90 V 1. The lower VOC for 1 was rationalized by partial crystallization of the material in the active layer. The possible closer molecular packing (vide supra) may enhance molecular crystallization, which in turn leads to local shunts in the absorber layers. In the crystallites, strong interaction between the molecules also leads to coupling and splitting of the molecular orbitals and consequently to a slight increase of the HOMO energy. For all derivatives, a reduction of the FF was observed with the increasing active layer thickness from 20 to 30 nm. This shows that the charge carrier collection efficiency decreases with the increasing layer thickness in the voltage regime around the maximum power point (MPP). On the other hand, the JSC of 2–5 increased with the increasing layer thickness indicating the contribution of the blend layer to the photocurrent generation. Overall, pentyl derivative 3 exceeded the other representatives of the presented S,N-heterohexacene series resulting in a maximum PCE of 7.1% with a JSC of 12.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 60.6% for an active layer thickness of 30 nm. The reduction of the active layer thickness to 20 nm leads to a slightly lower PCE of 6.7%. With the decreasing or increasing length of the alkyl side chains, a reduction of the JSC as well as a slight increase in series resistance (RS) was observed. In general, it has to be noted that the strong absorption of S,N-heterohexacenes 1–5 in the spectral range from 500 to 700 nm resulted in extremely high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), in particular higher than 80% for pentyl derivative 3 (Fig. 5b). The JSC values obtained from the integration of the EQE spectra (from 9.9 to 11.3 mA cm−2) were in reasonable agreement with those measured from the J–V curve. All compounds showed high saturation values of 1.04 to 1.10 exhibiting a weak voltage bias dependence of the current in the reverse direction.

Another interesting comparison is the development of solar cell parameters in dependence of the side chain length, as it gives insight into the effect of morphological changes induced by the alkyl chain length variation (Fig. 6). In particular, the devices with 30 nm thickness of the active layer showed an odd–even dependency of the alkyl side chain length on PCE and JSC with higher values for the odd-numbered alkyl chains, except for propyl derivative 1. This odd–even effect was most obvious for the FF of the 30 nm blends.
 Fig. 6  Variation of photovoltaic parameters (PCE, JSC, and fill factor) versus the alkyl side chain length for devices with an active layer thickness of 30 nm. 
The surface morphology of blends of DCV-SN6:C60 (2:1, 30 nm) deposited onto an ITO/C60 surface was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Two distinct morphologies were found: as a representative, Fig. 7 (top) shows the surface characterization of a 30 nm thick S,N-heterohexacene 1:C60 photoactive layer. Large crystallized domains composed by uniform structures of 80–180 nm in diameter at an average height of 30 nm were found for propyl derivative 1 in the blend (Fig. 7a and b). The corresponding phase images evidenced a very moderate shift-contrast which is indicative of a unique component or a well-mixed blend layer on the surface (Fig. 7c). The larger nanostructures can at least in part explain the loss in VOC observed for the BHJ solar cells. On the contrary, the 5:C60 photoactive blend layer revealed a uniform surface of very thin grain-like structures of 10–20 nm in diameter and 2 nm in height, apart from few big aggregates (Fig. 7d and e). The phase images showed a big phase shift of 90° and the histogram analysis over several phase images disclosed two well differentiated peaks, which we attribute to crystalline homophases.54–56 The analysis revealed 8–15 nm large islands of the donor phase surrounded by an interconnected network of the acceptor (Fig. 7f, bright and dark features, respectively) which accounts for a good phase separation and correlates with the higher performance of the corresponding photovoltaic device.

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new family of A–D–A oligomers 1–5 composed of S,N-heterohexacenes as the planarized electron-rich donor backbone and 1,1-dicyanovinyl (DCV) as acceptor moieties for application in organic solar cells. Single crystal X-ray structure analysis of hexyl derivative 4 gave further insight into the molecular ordering by providing intermolecular N–H and N–S non-bonding interactions and good π–π-stacking for efficient charge transport. The acceptor-substituted S,N-heterohexacenes showed high optical absorptivity and excellent thermal stability which made them suitable for vacuum-processed solar cells. The optical and electrochemical properties of the oligomers were not affected by the length of the alkyl side chains, while a noticeable influence was observed on the photovoltaic parameters. The excellent efficiency of 5.0% obtained for propyl derivative 1 represents one of the highest values reported for planar-heterojunction solar cells. In vacuum-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells, all derivatives 1–5 showed high open-circuit voltages resulting in good efficiencies of around 6.0% with the highest efficiency of 7.1% for pentyl derivative 3.
Experimental section
Instrument and measurements
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 (1H NMR: 500 MHz, 13C NMR: 125 MHz) or an Avance 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz). Chemical shift values (δ) are expressed in parts per million using residual solvent protons (1H NMR: δH = 3.58 for THF[D8]; δH = 5.93 for C2D2Cl4; 13C NMR: δC = 67.21 for THF[D8]; δC = 74.20 for C2D2Cl4) as an internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet) and m (multiplet). The assignments are Th-α-H (thiophene protons in α-position), Th-β-H (thiophene protons in β position), CHO (aldehyde protons), and DCVH (dicyanovinylene protons). Elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario EL. Melting points were determined using a Mettler Toledo DSC 823. Thin layer chromatography was carried out on aluminum plates, pre-coated with silica gel, Merck Si60 F254. Preparative column chromatography was performed on glass columns packed with silica gel, Merck Silica 60, particle size 40–63 μm. High resolution MALDI mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a MS Bruker Reflex 2 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany), MALDI-TOF mass spectra on a Bruker Daltonics Reflex III, using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as a matrix. Chemical ionisation (CI) mass spectra were measured on a Finnigan MAT SSQ-7000. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferricenium couple. Surface images of the photoactive layers were recorded using a Bruker MultiMode V AFM equipped with a Nanoscope controller at ambient temperature in tapping mode. The images were analyzed using the WSxM software.57 X-ray diffraction data of a blue single crystal of DCV-SN6 4 were collected in a stream of nitrogen at 180 K on a Agilent SuperNova, Cu at zero, Atlas CCD using graphite-monochromated Cu Kα radiation. Data collection, data reduction, and cell refinement were performed using the CrysAlisPro software.58 An absorption correction based on the semi-empirical ‘multi-scan’ approach was performed using the ABSPACK module.58 The structure was solved by direct methods using Superflip.59 For the final model, all non-H atoms were refined anisotropically using SHELXS.58 H atoms were finally placed in calculated positions, riding the parent C atom with C–H distance constraints of 0.93 Å for aromatic H atoms, 0.96 Å for methyl H atoms and 0.97 Å for methylene H atoms, and with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C) for H atoms.
Thin film and device fabrication
Thin films and heterojunction solar cell devices were prepared by thermal vapor deposition in a Creaphys ultra-high vacuum system (Creaphys GmbH, Dresden, Germany) at a base pressure of <10−7 mbar. The substrates were kept at room temperature for all thin films and layers, except of the absorber layers in the bulk heterojunction devices which were deposited at 90 °C. Thin films for absorption and emission measurements were prepared on quartz substrates; solar cells on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) coated glass (Thin Film Devices, USA, sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq−1). The layer thickness was determined during evaporation by using quartz crystal monitors. The thin films prepared for absorption and emission measurements were 30 nm thick. Thin film absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2101/3101 UV-Vis spectrometer. The thin film emission spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments FSP920 fluorescence spectrometer. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells were prepared layer by layer without breaking the vacuum. The blend layer of the respective donors and C60 as the acceptor were made at a 2:1 ratio by mass. NDP9 (purchased from Novaled GmbH, Germany) was used as 10% by mass dopant inside the hole transporting material BPAPF.
Photovoltaic characterization

J–V and EQE measurements were carried out in a glove box with nitrogen atmosphere which was directly attached to the vacuum system. This allows inert sample transfer without contact to air. J–V characteristics were measured using a source-measure unit (Keithley SMU 2400) and an AM 1.5G sun simulator (KHS Technical Lighting SC1200). The intensity was monitored using a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1337), which was calibrated at Fraunhofer ISE. The mismatch between the spectrum of the sun simulator and the solar AM 1.5G spectrum was taken into account for the calculation of current density. For well-defined active solar cell areas, aperture masks (2.76 mm2) were used. Simple EQE measurements were carried out using the sun simulator in combination with color filters for monochromatic illumination. The illumination intensity was measured using a silicon reference diode (Hamamatsu S1337).
Materials
Toluene (VWR) and DMF (Merck) were dried and purified using a MB SPS-800 (MBraun). DCM and n-hexane were purchased from VWR and distilled prior to use. Sodium tert-butoxide, n-hexyl amine, n-pentyl amine, n-propyl amine, 1,2-dichloroethane, phosphoryl chloride, sodium bicarbonate, malononitrile, and ammonium acetate were purchased from Merck. Pd(dba)2, n-butyl amine, and n-heptyl amine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene from Frontier Scientific. 3,6-Dibromo-2,5-bis(3-bromothien-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene 6 was prepared according to the literature.43

Dialdehyde 15 (185 mg, 0.33 mmol), malonodinitrile (500 mg, 7.56 mmol), and ammonium acetate (500 mg, 6.49 mmol) were dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (300 mL) and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C. After 48 h a large excess of malonodinitrile and ammonium acetate were added and the reaction was continued until completion of the reaction which was checked by TLC. After 7 days the mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature. The resulting solid was filtered off and thoroughly washed with hot methanol. Oligomer 4 was obtained as a blue solid (193 mg, 0.30 mmol, 89%). The compound was further purified by gradient vacuum sublimation. Mp (DSC) 373 °C. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, TCE[D2], 87 °C) δ = 7.70 (s, 2H; DCVH), 7.65 (s, 2H; Th-β-H), 4.31 (t, 4H, 3J(H,H) = 7.1 Hz; N-CH2), 1.96–2.01 (m, 4H; N-CH2-CH2), 1.32–1.47 (m, 12H; N-(CH2)2-(CH2)3), 0.88 ppm (t, 6H, 3J(H,H) = 7.1 Hz; N-(CH2)5-CH3). 13C-NMR could not be measured due to low solubility. HRMS (LDI): m/z calcd for C34H30N6S4 (M+) 650.14093 found 650.14102 (δm/m = 0.14 ppm).
The following DCV end-capped SN6 derivatives were prepared accordingly:
