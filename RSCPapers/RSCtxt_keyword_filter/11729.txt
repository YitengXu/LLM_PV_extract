    , Accepted 23rd April 2015First published on 27th April 2015AbstractWe have designed and synthesized two new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based organic sensitizers (DPPCA and DPPCN) with the dithiafulvalene (DTF) unit as donor and cyanoacrylic acid/malononitrile as acceptor moieties. These dyes showed excellent efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production over a Pt–TiO2 composite via solar-induced water splitting. The sensitizers showed broad absorptions over the wide visible regime (500–800 nm). In DPPCN, the malononitrile moiety led to strong intra-molecular charge transfer, as evidenced by red shifted (∼24 nm) absorption maxima with highly enhanced molar absorptivity (108190 M−1 cm−1). The electrochemical characterization of as-prepared sensitizers confirmed the feasible electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band (CB) which has been further validated by theoretical studies. In this study, the rate of the photocatalytic activity was found to be dependent on the acceptor part of the dye molecule as DPPCN sensitized Pt–TiO2 (DNPT) exhibited remarkable (1208 μmol) hydrogen evolution yield in comparison to DPPCA sensitized Pt–TiO2 (DAPT) (840 μmol). The rigid DPP core made the sensitizers significantly photo-stable as affirmed by their high hydrogen production efficiency over 80 h of prolonged irradiation. As predicted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ground state geometry of the dyes was almost planar, facilitating continuous conjugation throughout the molecule. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were also carried out to make clear the understanding of charge transfer transition of the dye molecules.
Introduction
Harvesting solar energy for the production of clean fuels is a widely recognized technology for fulfilling the future energy demands.1 In this direction, the production of hydrogen from water using solar energy is a promising strategy for environmentally benign energy production.2 Solar spectrum matching of highly effective and stable photocatalysts is crucial for solar to chemical conversion. In particular, rationally modifying the surface of the photocatalytic particles with a visible light sensitizer is critical to increase photon-to-hydrogen efficiency. So far, the majority of the photocatalytic systems have employed noble metal complexes as the sensitizers or catalysts.3 On these aspects, metal free organic sensitizers (donor–π–acceptor) are proving to be good strategic designs for photocatalysts to improve hydrogen evolution efficiency in the visible-light region. Till date, organic sensitizers with desirable optical and electrochemical properties have been widely studied for visible light induced photocatalytic H2 production. In particular, phthalocyanine,4 phenothiazine,5 BODIPY,6 9,10-anthraquinone,7 and triarylamine8 dyes in visible light induced H2 production from water have been developed. However, all the dyes showed moderate photocatalytic H2 production activity and low stability.
DPP building blocks have enjoyed diverse use in materials technology9 for their various molecular features like (a) facile synthetic modifications, (b) strong electron accepting property, (c) high fluorescence quantum yields and (d) exceptional thermal and photo-stability. Moreover, the molecular planarity of DPP unit induces strong intermolecular H-bonding and π–π stacking with the neighboring molecules. This unique properties making them excellent building blocks for many applications like polymer and small molecule organic photovoltaics.10 The DPP-based sensitizer exhibited very limited use in the application of dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC).11 However, as far as we are aware, no such report was explored on a DPP based dye sensitized system for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Thus designing of new DPP based chromophore and utilizing the donor–chromophore–anchor (D–C–A) motif into the sensitizers for stable photocatalytic process is highly desirable.
Dithiafulvalenes (DTFs) exhibit unique charge transport characteristics similar to tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs), due to their coplanar molecular structures with strong π–π and S–S interactions.12 DTFs as a terminal electron-donating group has been used in high performance dye-sensitized solar cells13 as well as in bulk heterojunction solar cells.14 According to our knowledge, the role of DTF as an electron donor has not been studied anywhere in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process.
Binding of a sensitizer on the semiconductor surface through their anchoring group is a very crucial factor for efficient electron injection from the dye to semiconductor.3a,b A power conversion efficiency of 11% and 12% has been achieved using ruthenium and porphyrin sensitizers with carboxylate anchoring group respectively.15 Moreover, the anchoring groups in a sensitizer not only control the adsorption ability to the semiconductor surface but also drive the spectral response of the sensitizer via its electron withdrawing (EW) properties. But the real challenge lies in the choice of EW groups.
In this work, we report the synthesis of two new dyes derived from the DPP-core with DTFs functionality and its performance as a sensitizer in visible light-induced hydrogen production from water (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on DPP dye functionalized with DTFs as a terminal electron-donating group. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and theoretical studies of these sensitizers were undertaken to realize how structural modifications to the DPP chromophore affect the performance of photocatalytic activities. We found that the malononitrile group containing DPPCN exhibits substantially higher photocatalytic H2 evolution than DPPCA bearing a cyanoacrylic acid group.

Solvents used for reaction and characterization were distilled according to standard procedures and stored with 4 Å molecular sieves under a N2 atmosphere. All reactants and reagents are commercially available and used as received, unless otherwise noted. Compound 1 and hexadithiafulvene (HDT) was prepared according to published procedures.16 All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were of the reagent grade and used without further purification.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were performed on a Avance 300 and 500 MHz spectrometer at room temperature. The chemical shift in (δ) ppm of all the compounds was calibrated using a trace solvent peak, which is referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS). Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on Shimadzu Biotech Axima performance. The IR spectra of dyes were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer. UV-visible and fluorescence spectra of the two dyes in solution were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell were carried out on Hitachi-U2910 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical data were obtained by cyclic voltammetry using a conventional three-electrode cell and a BAS100 electrochemical analyzer. The working electrode was a Pt rod, the auxiliary (counter) electrode was a Pt wire, the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) was obtained on a Labsphere DRA-CA-3300 compartment associated with the Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer over the 250–800 nm range using BaSO4 as a reference. The photocatalytic experiments were carried out under an external light source using a 450 W Oriel Research Arc lamp Source (Newport, USA, model no. 66924; working at 400 W) equipped with xenon (Xe) lamp, and cut-off filter (λ > 400 nm). The average photon flux of the incident light was determined on an optical power/energy meter, Newport, model: 842-PE. All the photocatalytic hydrogen generation experiments were performed under the simulated solar light illumination of intensity ∼2.0 Sun (1.95 W cm−2). In the hydrogen production experiment the gasses produced were analyzed by Perkin Elmer Clarus 580 GC equipped with a 5 Å molecular sieve column, a thermal conductivity detector and argon as the carrier gas.

Platinum deposition on TiO2 (Pt–TiO2)
In a 100 mL round-bottomed flask, TiO2 (1.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich anatase) was dispersed in 20 mL methanol. Aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (0.25 mL, 8 wt% aqueous solution) was then added into the methanolic suspension of TiO2 and the reaction mixture was irradiated using a 400 W xenon lamp for 3 h. The resultant Pt–TiO2 composite of light gray colour was retrieved by centrifugation, washed three times with excess methanol and dried under vacuum at 50–60 °C.
Preparation of dye@Pt–TiO2 composites
To anchor the dyes successfully on TiO2 surface, dyes were first separately dissolved in methanol chloroform solution (1:1 v/v, 10 mL). Then Pt–TiO2 (PT) was dispersed into the resulting solution and the mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature in the dark for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, it was filtered, washed with ethanol and then dried in the air. These final composites were labelled as DNPT and DAPT.
Photocatalytic experiment
The photocatalytic H2 generation experiments were carried out in a doubly jacketed Pyrex glass reactor with a flat optical window and an external cooling jacket. All experiments were carried out in 20 mL aqueous suspension containing 10 mg photocatalyst and 10 vol% of triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor (SED). The solution was adjusted to the desired pH using 1(M) hydrochloric acid. It was then air sealed with a rubber septum. Before light irradiation, the dissolved air was removed by keeping it for 20 min under high vacuum followed by purging of Ar gas. The 450 W xenon arc lamp (Newport, USA and working at 400 W) using a cut-off filter (λ> 400 nm) was used as an external light source. The reaction mixture was kept under constant stirring conditions during the course of irradiation and the resulting evolved gases were analyzed by gas chromatography using Perkin Elmer Clarus 580 GC equipped with a molecular sieve 5 Å column, thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and argon as the carrier gas.
Computational details
DFT calculations were carried out to get proper understanding of the electronic structure and molecular orbital of ground state geometry, using Gausssian09 software program package.17 Ground state geometry was fully optimized using Becke's three parameter hybrid exchange functional combined with the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP)18 and split valence plus polarization (6-311G(d,p)) basis set. Frequency analysis was carried out to verify the geometry and no negative frequencies were found. With optimized ground state geometry, single point calculation was performed to calculate the molecular orbitals at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. TDDFT calculation was carried out to analyze the absorption spectra using a CAM-B3LYP functional and the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent. Solvent effects were simulated using the PCM19 model which employs linear response formalism as implemented in Gaussian09.20
Results and discussion
Various characterization techniques have been used in evaluating important features of the photocatalyst. Optical properties of dyes were explained by UV-vis spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Dye and TiO2 attachments were measured by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Moreover, the as-synthesized dyes (DPP) were fully characterized by NMR, MALDI-TOF and FTIR, and the results have been incorporated in the ESI.†
Synthesis
Syntheses of the sensitizers are depicted in the Scheme 1. Initially, started with a simple molecule thiophene-2-carbonitrile, 3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (compound 1) was synthesized using a typical three step process16 where ethylhexyl moiety was appended as a solubilizing group. Then Suzuki cross coupling with 5-formyl thiophene-2-boronicacid in the presence of a base resulted in [5′,5′′-(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diyl)bis[(2,2′-bithiophene)-(5-carbaldehyde)]] (2) where thiophene moieties introduce an extended π conjugation in the molecular architecture. The donor group HDT was introduced through Horner–Wittig reaction resulted DPP-MCHO in the dark blue color. The introduction of malononitrile and cyanoacrylic acid group in DPP-MCHO using a Knoevenagel condensation reaction induced a color change of the sensitizers towards a more visible region. All the compounds were successfully characterized by NMR, IR and mass spectroscopic measurements. Both compounds exhibit the characteristic CN stretching at around 2210–2220 cm−1. Results of 1H NMR and mass spectra are correlated very well with the structure. The characteristic resonance band for vinyl groups appearing at 7.5–8.0 ppm for both sensitizers were found to be similar with the reported compounds.21

Optical properties
The absorption and emission spectra of novel organic dyes DPPCA and DPPCN in dichloromethane solution are shown in Fig. 2a and its values are summarized in Table 1. Both sensitizers exhibit two absorption bands at 350–480 nm and 500–800 nm. Higher energy absorption is attributable to DPP core centered π–π* transition which was found to be common in other DPP based organic dyes22 and lower energy broad absorption bands due to photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from the donor (HDT) core to the acceptor (CN, COOH) moiety. DPPCA containing cyanoacrylic acid displayed lower energy absorption maxima at 650 nm with an εmax value of 58170 M−1 cm−1. In DPPCN, the malononitrile moiety is an acceptor and the sensitizer depicted absorption maxima at 674 nm with a red shift of about 24 nm, which showed a dramatically increased molar extinction coefficient, up to 108190 M−1 cm−1. This is attributed to the strong ICT of DPPCN in comparison to DPPCA.

Both the absorption and emission spectra of the as-synthesized dyes are compatible with the excitation and detection wavelength of the common fluorescence instrumentation. As shown in Fig. 2a, the emission maxima of the DPPCA and DPPCN dyes are closed to the near-IR region (735 and 809 nm).
When the dyes were attached to TiO2, a blue shift of the absorption maximum from 650 nm to 613 nm for DAPT and 674 nm to 615 nm for DNPT were found (Fig. 2b). These results suggested that DPP dyes of the blue shifted absorption band coupled with spectral broadening has arisen due to electronic interactions between the adsorbed dye and TiO2. The optical band gap (E0–0 = zeroth–zeroth transition) of DPPCN and DPPCA are 1.66 and 1.76 eV, which are estimated from the intersection of the corresponding normalized absorption and emission spectra of Fig. 2a.
To evaluate the charge transfer transition, UV-vis absorption spectra of the organic sensitizers in the solution phase were simulated by TD-DFT calculations.23 The normalized plots of simulated UV-vis spectra of DPPCA and DPPCN are given in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The summarized data of important allowed transitions within the range of 300–670 nm in comparison with the experimental λmax are given in Table S1 (ESI†). The results are in good agreement with experimental UV-vis spectra. In DPPCA, the most intense low energy absorption at 654 nm with an oscillator strength of f = 2.297, is due to charge transfer transition from HOMO to LUMO (74%). In the case of DPPCN the most intense peak at 664 nm with an oscillator strength of f = 2.328 is also a charge transfer transition from HOMO to LUMO (72%).
Redox properties
To investigate the redox characteristics and frontier molecular orbital energy levels, CV measurements were performed in a 0.1 M dichloromethane solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexa-fluorophosphate (TBAPF6) with ferrocene as an internal standard at 0.63 V vs. NHE. The first oxidation potential (E+/E0) of DPPCA and DPPCN were observed to be 0.64 and 0.65 V vs. NHE, respectively, which are assigned to the oxidation of hexadithiafulvene units (Fig. S2 and S3 in ESI†). Little positive shift of the oxidation potential was observed for DPPCN, though strong donor–acceptor interactions led to lowering of the LUMO energy level. The LUMO values are estimated at −3.62 eV and −3.75 eV for DPPCA and DPPCN, respectively, which are calculated from Eox–E0–0. These negative values are sufficient for the thermodynamically feasible electron injection from the dye to TiO2 CB (−0.5 V vs. NHE).5b
Geometry and molecular orbitals
Geometry optimization was performed for all possible conformations, and the one with lowest energy was selected for the study (Fig. 3 and 4). Long alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups so as to decrease the computational complexity.24 Ground state geometry of the dyes DPPCA and DPPCN was almost planar, facilitating the continuous conjugation throughout the molecule. All the thiophene groups are in stable planar anti conformation. The terminal S-alkyl groups are also in trans to each other. Electron density of homo of both DPPCN and DPPCA is mainly distributed on the DPP core, bithiophene bridge and dithiafulvene moiety while LUMO has major contribution from the bithiophene bridge and CN/COOH acceptor and minor contribution from the DPP core (Fig. 3).

Photocatalytic hydrogen generation
To evaluate the performance of DPP–dyes for photocatalytic water splitting reactions, the hydrogen production of DNPT and DAPT catalysts were studied in a reaction solution of 10 vol% TEOA in water (pH 7) under solar irradiation using an external light source of 450 W xenon lamp (working at 400 W). To ensure that the catalytic system was working at its maximum capacity, the key operational parameters like dye concentration and pH of the medium were taken into account. As shown in Fig. 5a and Table 2, the photocatalytic H2 evolution yield of DNPT (1208 μmol) exhibited higher than DAPT (840 μmol). In this study, it was found that the rate of the photocatalytic activity significantly depends upon the acceptor part of the dye molecule. It can be envisioned from the molecular structure that DPPCA possesses one cyanoacrylic acid moiety whereas DPPCN contains two –CN groups which are electron withdrawing in nature. Moreover, DPPCA is directly attached onto TiO2 surface via esteric linkage O–Ti–O which has greater binding energy than that of cyanide linkage –CN–C–O–TiO, formed between DPPCN and TiO2.21,25 Despite, the strong linkage between DPPCA and TiO2, DPPCN was found to be more efficient in term of intrinsic H2 evolution. This anomalous behavior may be due to significant charge transfer between DPPCN and TiO2. As shown in Fig. 5b, five series of experiments (0.1–0.3 μmol per 10 mg) were carried out to optimize the efficient dye absorption onto the TiO2 surface. The photocatalytic activity for DAPT increases with increasing amount of dye and shows maximum at a dye amount of 0.25 μmol per 10 mg Pt–TiO2. After that, H2 production was decreased at a dye concentration of 0.3 μmol per 10 mg Pt–TiO2. At optimal dye concentration, the yield of hydrogen was achieved up to 840 μmol after 10 h. Typically, the fraction of incident light absorbed by the dye increases with increasing dye loading to saturate at a certain level. Above this concentration, the photocatalytic activity starts to decrease due to the agglomerating nature of the dyes and the reduction of the penetration depth of the incident light.26

To get a further insight into the H2 generation, the effect of the pH has also been screened over the pH range 4 to 10 (Fig. 6). The rate of H2 production increased with increasing pH from 4 to 7 and decreased afterwards. The photocatalytic activities of DAPT and DNPT reached maximum with a H2 production yield of 840 and 1208 μmol in neutral medium at rt. The reason for lowering of H2 generation yield could be due to the dissolution of the photocatalyst under acidic condition and at higher pH; the existence of hydroxyl anions may drive partial decomposition of the catalyst during the course of reaction or it would facilitate photo-generation of hydroxyl radicals.27

Fig. 7 shows the stability of DPPCA and DPPCN under simulated solar irradiation. The reactions were carried out with 0.25 μmol of dye per 10 mg Pt–TiO2 in TEOA aqueous solution at neutral pH medium. The rate of hydrogen generation was increased from the first run (840 and 1208 μmol) and reached maximum at the second run (968 and 1240 μmol), thereafter slight decrease in the consecutive runs was observed. This may be due to the consumption of SED (TEOA) and the partial decomposition of dyes during photochemical irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of these photocatalysts could still maintain ∼75% over 80 h after consecutive 8 runs.

Orbital population of DPPCA and DPPCN were evaluated from DFT calculation and has been depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 8. The conceptual representation shows the feasible electron injection from dye LUMO to CB of TiO2 as evidenced by the electrochemical and theoretical characterization. The major electron densities of HOMO and LUMO states of both sensitizers are located on the HDT as a donor and cyanoacrylic acid/malononitrile group as an acceptor, respectively. Thus, it is expected that photo-excitation can induce intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to acceptor groups.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and developed new efficient diketopyrrolopyrrole based metal free sensitizers which showed remarkable visible light response. Efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion was performed over dye sensitized Pt–TiO2 composite under ∼2 AM simulated solar irradiation. Introduction of the strong electron withdrawing group CN in the acceptor part facilitated the intramolecular charge transfer which turned to be the key effect for high photoactivity. The optimum grafted amount of the dye (0.25 μmol per 10 mg Pt–TiO2) for maximizing H2 generation was considerably lower as <0.3 μmol. The highest dihydrogen evolution yield was obtained with 1028 μmol over DPPCN/Pt–TiO2 in 10 vol% aqueous triethanolamine at pH 7. The diketopyrrolopyrrole dyes exhibited good donating ability and stability and their physical properties could be explained by DFT computations. In our water splitting reaction, the DPP chromophore and thiophene spacer can reduce the charge recombination from TiO2 and enhance charge injection into TiO2, making a bidentate binding mode due to the reduction of the steric effect between the donor moiety and the TiO2 site. Theoretical studies showed that quasi-planar π conjugation between the bridge and acceptor in DPP dyes may speed up the charge transfer from the donor to acceptor and therefore enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production. These sensitizers on TiO2 could provide a future rational design towards pronounced visible-light harvesting capability and significant stability and high activity for H2 production from solar-driven water splitting.
