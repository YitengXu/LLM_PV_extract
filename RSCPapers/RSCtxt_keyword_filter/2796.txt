    , Accepted 18th March 2022First published on 18th March 2022AbstractTransition metal oxide semiconductors are important candidates for photoelectrodes to convert solar energy to fuels. However, the practical applications of these materials are hindered by severe carrier losses and sluggish electrochemical reactions. Hence, efficient collection of photogenerated charges and participation of these electrons in the surface reaction is critical. In this work, we sought to enhance the performance of photoelectrodes by modulating the crystal facets of transition metal oxides through theoretical designs and experimental validations. As a prototypical system, we demonstrated that CuBi2O4 (CBO) crystal can form a rod-like structure, where the surface region is dominated by the highly stable and active (002) facet. As a result, the designed CBO photocathode shows a threefold enhanced water reduction photocurrent and improved fill factor compared with ordinary grained CBO film. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, transient photocurrent, and ultrafast spectroscopy analyses, we demonstrate that the improved performance is due to the enhanced electrochemical catalytic performance, higher efficiency of carrier collection, and charge utilization. Our work presents a new aspect of the rational design of high-efficiency photoelectrode systems in solar-fuel conversion.
1. Introduction
Integrating semiconductors with electrochemical devices is attractive due to its potential in utilizing sustainable solar energy.1,2 One typical design is to use p-type semiconductors as photocathodes, on which the targeted hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are catalyzed. Various materials and methods have been employed to screen possible candidates in this field.3–5 Despite the significant progress achieved, the practical application is still hindered by the poor charge collection efficiency and sluggish surface kinetics of photoelectrodes.6–8
Recently, copper-based binary and ternary oxides have received attention as alternative semiconductor photocathode materials due to their p-type conductivity.9–13 Among them, copper bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4, denoted as CBO) is compelling because of its desirable bandgap (1.67 eV) and good photostability.14,15 However, in practice, the photocurrent of a CBO photocathode can only achieve ∼30% of the theoretical value.16 The main reasons for this discrepancy are recombination of the photocarriers within the semiconductor and the inefficient electrochemical catalytical process.17–19 Analogous to other transition metal oxide semiconductors, CBO exhibits polaron transport, which can significantly reduce charge mobility and thus limit the diffusion length of photocarriers.20,21 As a result, the photocarriers only present a diffusion path of 45 nm, and a very low percentage of charge carriers can participate in the surface reaction.10,22 On the other hand, the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics also cause charge accumulation at the surface/subsurface region, further inducing charge recombination. Thus, a critical strategy is needed to overcome these intrinsic limitations and enhance the performance of CBO-based photocathodes.
Crystal facet engineering, which modulates the preferred orientation and selective exposure of higher activity facets, is an emerging approach to enhance the charge collection and surface activity of photoelectrodes.23–25 For instance, a bismuth vanadate film with a preferred [001] orientation and exposed (001) facets has been reported to exhibit excellent intrinsic charge transport properties and surface activity.26–28 Successful design of crystal engineering depends on in-depth understanding of the specific semiconductor's surface tension and catalytical activity. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been almost no investigation of this issue for CBO either theoretically or experimentally.
Herein, aiming to simultaneously improve the charge collection and surface activity of CBO-based photocathodes, a well-defined rod-like CBO photocathode with a distinct dominant exposed facet was prepared by combining theoretical and experimental methods. Our theoretical studies indicate that by using a quasi-stable procedure, CBO crystal can form a rod-like structure where the surface region is dominated by the highly stable and active (002) facet. As a result, the prepared rod-like CBO photocathode shows a threefold enhanced water reduction photocurrent and improved fill factor compared with the normal grained CBO film (0.99 mA cm−2vs. 0.35 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V vs. RHE). This superior performance can be attributed to the improved surface activity and the enhanced charge collection efficiency, as characterized by transient photocurrent, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and ultrafast spectroscopy analysis.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Crystal engineering and HER activity of CBO through DFT calculations
We began by building slab models for CBO on the basis of the experimental structure.22 To maintain structural stability and obtain the converged hydrogen binding energy, we constructed a 24-layer model for the following exploration (Fig. 1a). Based on the XRD characterizations, we selected five low-index facets, namely, (002), (200), (211), (202), and (213) (Fig. 1b–f). The stoichiometry was preserved in the bulk materials to calculate the surface tension. Computational studies revealed that the (002) facet presents better stability than the other facets (Fig. 1h). Since the nano-crystal formation accompanies the minimization of the surface energy,29 a smaller surface tension is correlated to a larger surface area within the nano-crystal. Hence, we propose a quasi-stable synthesis procedure to lead to a crystal-CBO with a dominant (002) facet area.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the prototypical slab model (a); (b)–(f) demonstrate the optimized (200), (002), (202), (211), and (213) facets of the CBO; (g) demonstrates the Wulff construction of the rod-like CBO based on the surface tension; (h) demonstrates the HER activity of the different facets of CBO. 
Since CBO has been proposed as a photocathode for photo-to-chemical energy conversion,22 we evaluated the catalytic effect of this material on the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) within the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework.30 Herein, the hydrogen (H+ + e−) is assumed to be equilibrated with hydrogen gas (H2), and the overpotential comes from the energy difference between the product and the adsorbed H*. We found that different facets present very different HER catalytical activities. Hence, the overall performance of the polycrystalline structure can be improved by enlarging the ratio of those surfaces with higher catalytical performance. Because the (002) facet presents the second highest HER activity among the low-index facets (Fig. 1i), we propose that the overall HER performance can be enhanced by obtaining a (002) facet-dominant crystal.
2.2 Material synthesis and characterizations
We sought to explore our design experimentally by synthesizing the (002) facet-dominated CBO and comparing it with grained CBO (g-CBO) with polycrystalline structures. Both materials were grown on Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) substrates. With careful treatment, the standard spin-coating method leads to pure polycrystalline g-CBO.31 Meanwhile, we employed the surfactant-free seed-mediated chemical bath deposition method as a quasi-equilibrium synthesis procedure and obtained CBO with a different morphology.32,33 The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shows a clear rod-like CBO (r-CBO) structure (Fig. 2b), while g-CBO demonstrates a granular morphology (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 2  Schematic of the fabrication procedure for the r-CBO film (a); SEM image of the r-CBO film on the ITO substrate (b); high-resolution TEM (c) image of r-CBO; XRD patterns (d) and Raman patterns (e) of the CBO films; the high-resolution Cu 2p (f), Bi 4f (g) core-level spectra of g-CBO and r-CBO. 
To further evaluate the detailed atomic structure, transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterization was performed to assess the surface topology of the synthesized CBO. The results (Fig. 2c) demonstrate the well-ordered atomic structure of the obtained r-CBO. The lattice spacing of ∼0.422 nm indicated that the (002) facet is dominant, which is consistent with the calculation that the surface tension of the (002) facet is the lowest. The XRD characterizations were performed to explore the bulk structure: the sharp peaks for g-CBO and r-CBO (Fig. 2d) show that the synthesized material exhibits an ordered crystalline structure.32,33 Besides, no peak corresponding to the CuO phase was observed,22 which indicates that we obtained a pure CBO phase of the material.31 This is also supported by the Raman spectrum (Fig. 2e). Meanwhile, the (002) signal of r-CBO is enhanced compared with that of g-CBO, indicating that we employed a successful synthesis procedure.
After that, we carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to characterize the chemical bonding environment. The satellite peaks and a 20.1 eV peak energy difference (Fig. 2f) demonstrate that the copper cation shows a 2+ valence charge.14 The similar spectra for r-CBO and g-CBO indicate that Cu2+ cations possess the same chemical environment in both materials. Meanwhile, the same peak energy difference of 5.3 eV for Bi cations shows that Bi3+ is the dominant species at the r-CBO and g-CBO surface/sub-surface. Additionally, the identical valence band offset spectra in Fig. S2† indicate similar defect properties on the surface of r-CBO and g-CBO.34 Hence, our method did not modify the chemical environment of the surface/subsurface of the metal cations.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical performance of the obtained CBO as a HER catalyst
The impact of surface engineering on the CBO samples was explored through their catalytical performance in the photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The r-CBO and g-CBO photocathodes were assembled with a Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a near-neutral electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution, pH 8.4). A 60 mW cm−2 purple LED (390 nm) was used as a light source. The photocurrent–potential (J–V) correlation (Fig. 3a) shows that r-CBO and g-CBO can push the on-site potential to ∼1.05 V (vs. RHE), indicating that CBO is a good candidate for photoelectrochemical applications. Additionally, the current density corresponding to the HER is significantly enhanced (0.99 mA cm−2vs. 0.35 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V vs. RHE) on the r-CBO photocathode compared with that on the g-CBO photocathode. This observation is consistent with the DFT calculations in that the overall HER activity can be increased through surface engineering.

Representative photocurrent–potential (J–V) curves (front illumination) of g-CBO (blue) and r-CBO (orange) photocathodes under UV LED (390 nm, 60 mW cm−2) illumination in 0.1 M KHCO3 (a).

Transient photocurrent curves of CBO films under 10 Hz chopped light illumination at 0.7 V vs. RHE (e); IPCE plots of CBO films recorded at 0.6 VRHE (f). 
To further explore the mechanism behind the improved electrochemical performance, we assembled a two-RC-unit equivalent circuit (Fig. S3†) to evaluate the transport (Rtran) and injection (Rinj) resistance of the CBO photoelectrodes. As we discussed, the surface engineering method maintains the bulk structure (Fig. 2d); it can still modify the intrinsic properties of the bulk material, leading to a difference of Rtran in a range of 0.75–1.0 V (Fig. 3b).35,36 Because we improved the HER activity of r-CBO compared with that of g-CBO through facet engineering, a significant decrement of the Rinj for r-CBO at all working potentials (Fig. 3c) was observed. Overall, the reduced Rinj leads to better injection efficiency of r-CBO (Fig. 3d).37,38
The improved HER activity of r-CBO can also be evaluated through transient photocurrent (TPC) analysis with a 10 Hz purple LED pulse at 0.7 VRHE.39 In practice, transient cathode (A) and anode (B) peaks can be observed for g-CBO when the light pulses on and off (Fig. 3e). The peak (A) is due to the photoelectrodes' sluggish surface activity and the resulting charge accumulation at the surface. The peak (B) is assigned to holes diffusing from the external circuit and recombing with the accumulated electrons at the surface of the semiconductors. As a comparison, the improved HER activity of r-CBO can decrease the electron accumulation at the surface of the semiconductor, clearing up this sharp peak (backward electrical current, Fig. 3e). Together with the enhanced HER efficiency, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is much better for r-CBO (Fig. 3f).
2.4 Tracing the carrier kinetics
Because the bulk properties of CBO can be modified through surface engineering, our designed material can possess further merits in carrier dynamics due to the decreased resistance of the bulk materials (Fig. 3b). To validate this assumption, we added an electron capture agent, Na2S2O8, to an aqueous electrolyte and characterized the J–V correlations on the device with an r-CBO or g-CBO photoelectrode. Here, we chose a purple LED as the light source for two reasons: first, the CBO shows strong light harvesting in the UV-Vis region and exhibits the best performance in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 350 nm. The purple LED will give the best light response for CBO. Second, in comparison, Xe or AM 1.5 will cause a serious photothermal effect, which reduces the stability of CBO (Fig. S4†).5 A significantly larger current density on the r-CBO photoelectrode (Fig. 4a) was observed, indicating that the carriers can be collected more efficiently within r-CBO. IPCE measured in the same electrolyte further confirmed the enhanced PEC performance (Fig. 4b). Next, the UV-Vis spectrum was characterized to exclude the possibility that r-CBO processes better light absorption capacity. The same amount of absorption (Fig. 4c) for r-CBO and g-CBO demonstrates that these materials have the same light absorption capacity. After that, the absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) was calculated (Fig. 4d) to confirm that r-CBO can separate and collect charge carriers more efficiently, using eqn (1): APCE(λ) = IPCE(λ)/[1 − T(λ) − R(λ)](1)

Absorption spectra at distinct delay times and kinetic traces at a 550 nm probe wavelength for g-CBO (f and h) and r-CBO (g and i). 
To further explore the higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of r-CBO, we focused on the dynamics of the carriers in CBO materials.40 First, we identified two characteristic peaks (Fig. 4e and S5†) through the transient absorption spectrum: the electron transfer at O-to-Bi (2.27 eV, or 545 nm) and O-to-Cu (1.82 eV, or 680 nm). Fig. 4f and g show the decay of the absorption spectra at distinct delay times. It should be noted that in thin-film semiconductors, the shape of the signals is related to modification of the optical properties (the complex index of refraction) of the semiconductor as a result of the perturbation of the charge carrier band population by the pump pulse.41 Subsequently, the relaxation of the peak at 550 nm through time was monitored in both r-CBO and g-CBO (Fig. 4h and i). Then, the overall dynamics could be decomposed into three time periods and fitted in eqn (2):15,40,42 ΔA(t) = k1e−t/τ1 + k2e−t/τ2 + k3e−t/τ3(2)
The first period normally corresponds to the fast carrier interactions within the valence band. Stimulated by the light, the dynamics of the positive holes are enhanced, and the lifetime of g-CBO is ∼43% shorter than that of r-CBO (420 fs vs. 740 fs), indicating that the holes in r-CBO are relatively stable. The second period correlates to the carrier–phonon interactions in the valence band and trap states. The longer lifetime (26 ps for r-CBO vs. 13 ps for g-CBO) for r-CBO indicates better carrier–phonon interactions, which may correlate with better light-to-carrier conversion efficiency.43 Finally, the most pronounced difference comes from the third period, which is related to the recombination of the carriers. The much longer lifetime in r-CBO (711 ps vs. 450 ps) demonstrates the higher stability and the longer diffusion path in r-CBO, leading to the higher ICPE and ACPE discussed before.
2.5 Hydrogen generation
Finally, the CBO-based photocathode was applied in the PEC system to generate H2 without bias assistance with the above mechanism insights. The electrolyte was 20 mL deionized (DI) water purged with Ar (99.9%) gas for 30 min before the measurement. Formic acid (5 mL) as the hole scavenger was added to the electrolyte. Fig. 5 shows the production of H2 as a function of time under AM 1.5 irradiation. The H2 generation rate of r-CBO was 0.49 mmol m−2 h−1, six times higher than that of g-CBO (0.08 mmol m−2 h−1). The enhancement follows the results of the J–V response, revealing that the crystal facet engineering could dramatically promote the HER performance.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we rationally designed and fabricated a highly efficient CBO photocathode using a facet engineering strategy. Our theoretical calculations suggested that the CBO (002) facet shows highly stable and HER-active features. Based on this finding, we prepared a rod-like CBO photocathode with a dominant (002) facet, and a threefold enhancement of the water reduction photocurrent could be achieved. Furthermore, the PEIS and ultrafast spectroscopy analyses suggested that the superior performance is mainly due to the promoted charge collection and improved surface activity. Thus, this research demonstrates a successful way to modulate the CBO-based photocathode by a facet engineering approach. Moreover, if combined with other heterojunction and passivation methods, these improvements may help achieve higher efficiencies of these materials for PEC solar fuel production.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Preparation of rod-like CuBi2O4 (r-CBO) photocathodes
The CBO films were nano-sized round column CBO prepared using a facile surfactant-free seed-mediated CBD method. Before the growth of the nanorod bundles, a seed layer was deposited onto the ITO substrate by spin-coating and a follow-up thermal treatment step. First, 0.05 M copper acetate (Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) and 0.1 M bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) were added to 10 mL of ethanol (AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China), and then 1 M ethanolamine (AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) was added dropwise. The resulting solution was ultrasonically stirred for 30 minutes to obtain a precursor solution, and the precursor solution was continually agitated during the spin coating process. The ITO substrates were thoroughly washed with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol; dried with an air gun; and treated for 5 min in an O2 plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, PDC-32G-2). The precursor was filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE filter (Jin Teng) and spun at 800 rpm for 10 s. After spin-coating, the samples were pre-annealed for 10 min at 300 °C. After that, the samples were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h with a ramp of 5 °C min−1 and a follow-up natural cool-down step. The entire annealing process was performed in a box furnace in an air atmosphere.
After that, r-CBO films were grown on the CBO seed layer with a CBD process in which 0.228 M Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O and 0.6 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were dissolved in a mixed solution of nitric acid, DI water, and ethanol with a ratio of 1:4:5. Then, 10 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) was added slowly dropwise to a water bath under ice-water mixture conditions. After the addition of NaOH solution was completed, the modified CBO seed layers were immersed in the resultant precursor solution with the conductive surface facing down and were maintained at 10 °C for 1 h. After synthesis, the samples were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1, followed by a natural cool-down step. The entire annealing process was performed in a box furnace in an air atmosphere.
4.2 Preparation of grained CuBi2O4 (g-CBO) photocathodes
The g-CBO films were also synthesized by a spin-coating method. 0.05 M copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) and 0.1 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were added to 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China). The resulting solution was ultrasonically stirred for 30 minutes to obtain a precursor solution, and the precursor solution was continually agitated during the spin coating process. The spin coating process was performed on an ITO substrate, using 1000 rpm for 30 s, with pyrolyzing on a hot plate at 300 °C for 10 minutes and spin coating twice. After that, the targets were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h with a ramp of 5 °C min−1 and a follow-up natural cool-down step. The entire annealing process was performed in a box furnace in an air atmosphere.
4.3 Density functional theory calculations
We built the slab model based on the P4/ncc group of the CBO crystal structure. To obtain a stable structure and converged results, we used a thick model containing 24 layers of material and at least a 2 nm vacuum region. The models contained 350–500 atoms for the different facets. To calculate the surface tension, we maintained the stoichiometry of the materials. All the calculations were performed at the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) level of exchange function.44 The vdW interactions were described by Grimme's dispersion correction with Becke–Jonson damping.45,46 The electrons were described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method,47 and the cutoff was set to 450 eV. The Brillouin zone were described by 5 × 5 or 3 × 3 k-points, depending on the different sizes of the facets.
4.4 Material characterization
The morphologies of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (Apero S). The lattice images were observed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (Tecnai F30). The crystalline structures of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips, X'pert pro, Cu Kα 0.154 nm). Raman spectra were recorded using a confocal Raman microscope (HR800, Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm laser source. The characteristic Si phonon peak was used to calibrate the spectral position at 520.7 cm−1. X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) data were acquired by a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD XPS instrument using an Al-Kα source (hv = 1486.68 eV) and He I (hv = 21.22 eV) illumination. The XPS binding energy was calibrated using the adventitious alkyl carbon signals by shifting the C 1s peak to 284.8 eV.
4.5 Femtosecond transient spectroscopy
Transient spectroscopy was performed using a Coherent Legend Elite regenerative amplifier (<110 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) that was seeded by a Coherent Chameleon oscillator (75 fs, 80 MHz). The supercontinuum white probe light in the 330–600 nm range was generated on a CaF2 crystal excited by parts of the 800 nm laser beam from the amplifier. A portion of the laser beam was coupled to a Coherent OPerA-Solo optical parametric amplifier (285–2600 nm), which generated the 400 nm laser pump pulse with a beam size of around 0.3 mm. The pump was directly depolarized to remove the artifacts of orientational relaxation. This setup can detect the differential transmission or reflection signal separately. The data were fitted using Surface Xplore software (Ultrafast Systems, LLC).
4.6 PEC measurements
PEC measurements were performed with an RST5210F (Zhenzhou Shiruisi Instrument Technology Co., Ltd) potentiostat using a three-electrode system (reference electrode: Ag/AgCl, working electrode: CBO sample, counter electrode: Pt wire) under front-side illumination with a purple LED (390 nm) at 60 mW cm−2 in 0.1 M potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) with 0.1 M sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) as an electron scavenger at pH 8.4. The illuminated area of the working electrode was 0.64 cm2, defined by a homemade reaction cell. The RHE potential was calculated using eqn (3): VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.197(3)
A scan rate of 20 mV s−1 was used for a typical J–V measurement. The IPCE was measured at 0.6 VRHE in a three-electrode system. The PEIS was performed in the three-electrode configuration under illumination with an amplitude of 10 mV and the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. Transmission and reflection spectra were measured using a UV-Vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere (UV-3600 plus, Shimadzu) from 300 to 800 nm.
