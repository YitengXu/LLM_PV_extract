All studied oligofurans show high fluorescence and good thermal stability. Top contact organic FETs (OFETs) fabricated with oligofurans as the active layer show hole mobilities (∼0.01 to 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1) and on/off ratios (104 to 106) on a par with the corresponding oligothiophene analogues, while the threshold voltages displayed by oligofuran-based OFETs are significantly reduced due to higher HOMO energies as compared to those of oligothiophenes. Electroluminescence observed in oligofuran-based OFETs in a bottom-contact geometry is limited by electron injection. Overall, we find that furan building blocks are excellent candidates for replacing thiophene in optoelectronic materials.IntroductionThe past decade has seen a surge in research on organic semiconductors in relation to their applications in organic field effect transistors (OFETs),1 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),2 and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).3 In such devices, an organic semiconductor, driven by external stimuli such as photon flux or electric field, is used to transport electrons and/or holes through a solid thin film. The efficiency of this charge transport depends on the structure of the semiconducting molecules, their supramolecular architecture in the solid state, and the morphology of the film.1 While thiophene-containing molecules are currently most commonly used in high-efficiency OFETs4–6 and OPVs,7 the search for new organic semiconductors is critical for the further progress of the field.A common argument for the wide use of thiophene-based materials is the high polarizability of sulfur atoms and their ability to engage in strong S⋯S and S⋯π intermolecular interactions, which is believed to contribute to the good charge mobility of oligothiophenes and their derivatives.8 However, there are also several drawbacks to introducing sulfur atoms into π-conjugated systems: (i) their relatively low solubility (sexithiophene 6T is almost completely insoluble9); (ii) inefficient luminescence because of the quenching “heavy atom” effect; and (iii) the low rigidity of the thiophene–thiophene bond, which allows twisted conformations that can limit conjugation through the oligothiophene chain. This low rigidity also limits functionalization of the backbone; addition of solubilizing groups often deplanarizes these molecules.While oligothiophenes are extensively studied,5 their close analogues, oligofurans, have been scantily investigated. This is unfortunate for several reasons. Firstly, replacement of the sulfur atom with oxygen lowers aromaticity (which might be beneficial for electron delocalization along the chain) and lowers the oxidation potential (thus leading to a more accessible HOMO level). Secondly, unlike thiophenes, furan-based materials are reportedly biodegradable and can be prepared from biorenewable sources,10 which makes them more suitable for large-scale applications. However, only short conjugated oligofurans (≤5 rings with a HOMO–LUMO gap >3 eV) had been reported in the past.11Recently, we introduced long α-oligofurans and demonstrated several advantages of these materials over the extensively studied oligothiophenes, such as greater rigidity, better solubility, tighter packing, and more efficient fluorescence.12–14 Since then, furan-based semiconductors have gained remarkable attention and a number of high-performance OFET and OPV devices have been reported.15–17 Fréchet's group was the first to use an oligofuran/diketopyrrole copolymer to fabricate bulk heterojunction solar cells, earmarking the first non-thiophene based polymer with >4% power conversion efficiency.15c They also mentioned the increased solubility of oligofurans as one of the major advantages of this material. In addition, furan-based dyes were shown to have improved the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells, compared to that of phenyl- or thiophene-based dye analogues.18In an earlier communication,19 we have reported the first examples of OFETs based on oligofurans and showed that their charge-mobilities are very similar to those of the oligothiophene analogues. Here, we give a full account of the synthesis and characterization of the extended family of oligofuran-based semiconductors, including unsubstituted oligofurans (nF), hexyl- (DH-nF) and styryl-capped (DHS-nF) oligofurans, and oligofuran-capped anthracene (DH2F-Ant) (Chart 1). The styrene and anthracene units have been selected for their demonstrated ability to improve charge-transport properties in thiophene-based conjugated oligomers.20–23 We carefully compared the newly synthesized oligofurans to the corresponding known oligothiophenes to shed light on the role of the heteroatom in the optoelectronic properties of organic materials. Chart 1  Structures of the oligofuran and oligothiophene based materials discussed in this work. ExperimentalMaterials and methods1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in solution on 300 MHz, 400 MHz and 500 MHz spectrometers (Brücker) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the external standard. Chemical shifts are expressed in δ units. High resolution mass spectra were measured on a Waters Micromass GCT Premier Mass Spectrometer using field desorption (FD) ionization. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a TA Q200. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a TA Q600. Melting points were determined using DSC by taking the peak maximum at a scan rate of 10 deg min−1. UV-vis absorption measurements were made on a Cary-50 spectrometer (Varian). Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed on a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Varian) with the excitation/emission geometry at right angles. Fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) were determined using a standard procedure,24 and coumarin 30 in MeCN (λabs = 403 nm, λem = 480 nm, and Φf = 0.67) was used as a reference.25 Quantum yield measurements were made using four excitation wavelengths, the quantum yields were averaged over 20 measurements, and the errors were estimated to be less than 5%. For electrochemical measurements, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) was used as a solvent. Ag/AgCl was used as a reference electrode. A ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+ = 0.40 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in DCE)26 was used as an internal reference for all measurements. All electrochemical measurements were performed in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. Dry anhydrous DCE and TBABF4 (Fluka) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Ag/AgCl wire was prepared by dipping silver wire in a solution of FeCl3 and HCl. The syntheses of nF (n = 4–9),12DH-6F,19DiBr-2F,27DiBr-3F,27DiBr-4F,281 (ref. 19) and 2 (ref. 29) were described elsewhere.Synthesis and characterization5,5′-Bis((E)-4-hexylstyryl)-2,2′-bifuran (DHS-2F). 2,5′-Dibromobifuran (200 mg, 0.68 mmol), boronic ester 2 (640 mg, 2.04 mmol, 3 eq.), Pd(PPh3)4 (110 mg, 0.1 mmol), Cs2CO3 (1.98 gr, 6.1 mmol, 3 eq.) and anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF; 10 mL) were placed in a two-necked flask.

In the bottom-contact configuration, 25 nm Au electrodes were patterned by the lift off technique using a 5 nm thick Cr adhesion layer. In the top-contact configuration, Au electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask.Prior to deposition, the substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol followed by plasma cleaning. The bottom-contact devices had a channel length of 6 μm and a corresponding width of 1880 μm and the top-contact devices had channel lengths of 50 and 100 μm and widths of 500 and 1000 μm. The films of each compound were deposited on hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) treated substrates (wafers were exposed to HMDS vapors, and subsequently washed with toluene and isopropanol) by vacuum sublimation (ultimate pressure ∼10−6 Torr) at substrate temperatures (Td) of 20–80 °C and at a deposition rate of 0.1 to 0.3 Å s−1 until a nominal thickness of ∼50 nm was reached.The charge carrier hole mobilities (μh) and current on/off ratios (Ion/Ioff) of OTFTs were calculated in the saturation regime from a plot of the square root of the drain current vs. the gate voltage using the following equation:IDS = Ciμ(W/2L)(VG − VT)2where IDS is the drain–source current, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric (18 nF cm−2), L is the channel length, W is the channel width, and VT and VG are the threshold voltage and gate voltage, respectively. Electrical measurements were carried out at room temperature and under vacuum using a LakeShore probe station and a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer.Details of computationsAll calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.30 All molecules were optimized using a hybrid density functional,31 Becke's three-parameter exchange functional combined with the LYP correlation functional (B3LYP)32 and with the 6-31G(d) basis set (B3LYP/6-31G(d) level). The B3LYP/6-31G(d) level is currently widely used to study organic electronic materials and conjugated polymers (for studies of the electronic structural properties in the cases where dispersion interactions are not important, such as computational studies of isolated molecules) because it predicts geometries very reliably and provides good estimates for optical HOMO–LUMO gaps.33,34ResultsSynthesisAs is the case in thiophene chemistry, Stille coupling of furyl-halide or furyl-stannyl moieties appeared to be a reliable approach towards oligofuran-based compounds. DH-7F was synthesized in a similar manner to DH-6F19 (Scheme 1). Iodination of 2-hexylfuran followed by coupling with 2-tributylstannylfuran yields hexylbifuran, which was in turn stannylated and coupled with α,ω-dibromoterfuran to yield DH-7F. Synthesis of other furan homooligomers was discussed elsewhere.12 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to DH-7F. Styryl-substituted DHS-2F and DHS-4F were prepared via Suzuki coupling of DiBr-2F or DiBr-4F with vinylboronate derivative 2,29 to yield the products with moderate yields (Scheme 2). While DHS-2F was sufficiently soluble for purification by column chromatography, DHS-4F could only be purified using vacuum sublimation. For the synthesis of DH2F-Ant, we used a similar procedure to that successfully applied by Mee et al.,35 since the traditional Stille reaction (without CuI co-catalyst) had not yielded the desired product (Scheme 3). Scheme 2  Synthetic route to DHS-2F and DHS-4F.  Scheme 3  Synthetic route to DH2F-Ant. Thermal stabilityStability is a key requirement for the application of organic materials as semiconductors. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were applied to analyze the thermal stability of oligofuran-containing materials. All oligofuran materials in this study, as well as those previously reported by us,12 were found to be stable up to their sublimation temperature. In particular, the styryl-terminated DHS-4F showed no mass loss up to >350 °C (Fig. 1a), which is comparable to the stability of the thiophene analogue DS-4T.20,22 The high thermal stability of oligofurans was also confirmed by DSC measurements which reveal clear melting and crystallization peaks, with no sign of decomposition up to 300 °C (Fig. 1b). Generally, the melting points of unsubstituted oligofurans are ca. 50 °C lower than those of their thiophene analogues.12,36 This trend applies to substituted furans as well, with even larger differences (e.g. the melting temperature of DHS-4F is 235 °C and that of DHS-4T is 296 °C (ref. 23)). Note that the addition of a hexyl moiety results in a sharp crystallization transition relative to that of unsubstituted oligofurans. Fig. 1  (a) TGA of oligofurans under N2, scan rate: 5 °C min−1 and (b) DSC of oligofurans under N2, scan rate: 10 °C min−1. Optical propertiesGenerally, the HOMO–LUMO gaps of oligofurans are ca. 0.3 eV higher than those of the corresponding thiophenes.12 Accordingly, the absorption maxima of oligofurans are blue-shifted vs. those of the corresponding oligothiophenes by ca. 20–30 nm (Table 1). Unlike oligothiophenes, oligofurans show clear vibronic shoulders in their UV-vis absorption spectra, even at room temperature in solution (Fig. 2a). The fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2b) are also vibronically structured and reveal significantly smaller Stokes shifts compared to oligothiophenes (∼0.25 eV for 3F–9F and ∼0.40 eV for 3T–9T). Both of these observations indicate a greater rigidity of oligofurans.12 Both the experimental λmax and the calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps of oligofurans and oligothiophenes (Table 1) show a good linear dependence on the reciprocal chain length (1/n). A steeper slope (by ∼0.2 eV × n) for the oligofurans vs. oligothiophenes12,14 suggests a slightly more conjugated nature of the former. A recent Raman study of oligofurans confirmed that their π-conjugation does not reach saturation with the chain length at least up to the octamer, and the effective conjugation length extends over ∼14 to 15 units in polyfuran.37

Highly conjugated systems are also formed when oligofuran cores are coupled with other conjugated moieties. Interestingly, distyryl-substituted quaterfuran DHS-4F shows λmax at 432 nm, which is red-shifted compared to the homooligofuran with even larger number of π-electrons, namely, 7F (Fig. 2a, Table 1). The sharp vibronic splitting and the relatively low Stokes shift of 0.26 eV for DHS-4F (cf. 0.37 eV for DHS-4T) indicate that the styryl groups do not decrease significantly the rigidity of the conjugated backbone. The most red-shifted absorption (λmax 450 nm, Fig. 3) in the series was demonstrated by anthracene co-oligomer DHF2-Ant; its corresponding HOMO–LUMO gap is even lower than that of thiophene analogue DHT2-Ant (Table 1) which is due to a more planar conformation of the former (see below). Fig. 3  Normalized absorption and fluorescence spectra of DH2F-Ant in dichloromethane. All studied oligofurans displayed much higher fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) compared to the corresponding oligothiophenes (Table 1): cf. Φf of 82% for 4Fvs. 18% for 4T.38 The high fluorescence of oligofurans is important for their application in optoelectronic devices.Electrochemical propertiesDFT calculations predict that oligofurans possess higher HOMO levels than the oligothiophenes. This is also observed experimentally in the oxidation potentials of oligofurans, which are systematically lower than those of the corresponding thiophene analogues (Table 1). Cyclic voltammograms of oligofurans display an oxidation peak in the range of 0.6–0.9 V vs. SCE (Fig. 4). Unsubstituted homooligomers 5F–8F reveal an irreversible oxidation (Fig. 4a), and subsequent cycling results in the growth of a polymer film.12 Styryl and hexyl substituted oligofurans display reversible oxidation behavior (Fig. 4b). We note that such substituents also prevent polymerization. A second reversible oxidation was observed for the two longest end-capped oligofurans DH-7F and DHS-4F. In the series, the lowest oxidation potential belongs to anthracene derivative DH2F-Ant, which revealed three oxidation waves in its cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S1).† Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms of (a) 5F–8Fvs. SCE in propylene carbonate (PC) and (b) DH-nF and DHS-nFvs. SCE in dichloroethane (DCE) with 0.1 M Bu4N+BF4, measured at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Crystal structure and packingThe molecular organization (‘packing’) in the solid state strongly affects charge transport efficiency.39 While peculiar packing motifs of short oligofurans 3F and 4F are not favourable for efficient charge-transport,12 the longer 6F displays herringbone packing almost superimposable with that of 6T,40 and similar to that of pentacene.416F, however, is more tightly packed than 6T which could explain the similar FET performances of oligofurans and oligothiophenes, despite the above-mentioned higher polarizability of sulfur (see below).More substantial differences in the solid state structure often come from different syn/anti conformations adopted by oligofuran and oligothiophene derivatives. Thus, the styryl substituents in DHS-2F adopt a syn conformation (s-cis in respect of the furan-vinylene bond) (Fig. 5a). This is different from the anti–anti conformation of the thiophene analogue DPS-2T42 (Fig. 5b).43 However, the calculated geometries for DS-2F and DS-2T reveal almost the same preference (2.5 and 2.6 kcal mol−1, respectively) for the syn–syn conformation in the gas phase (Fig. S2).† Consequently, the different conformations observed for the X-ray structures of DHS-2F and DPS-2T should be the result of crystal packing forces. Fig. 5  ORTEP representation of the top view (top) and stick representation of the side view (bottom) of (a) DHS-2F and (b) DPS-2T (white – hydrogen, grey – carbon, red – oxygen, and yellow – sulfur). The structure of DPS-2T is taken from ref. 42. The conjugated backbone of DHS-2F does not display any dihedral twist, thus maintaining high conjugation of the π-system; however, the conjugated core adopts an unusual “kite” shape conformation (Fig. 5, top). This is in contrast to the thiophene analogue, DPS-2T, which has no significant bending, but shows a small dihedral twist of the vinylene groups. Note that such bending is not necessarily a drawback since materials with a similar “kite” conformation have shown excellent charge transport properties.44 While the above-mentioned differences seem to be due to different (and complex) interplay of packing forces, rather than intramolecular effects, replacing thiophene for the furan provides yet another means to tune the solid state packing of molecular semiconductors.Charge transport in OFETsSince field effect properties are highly dependent on the conditions of fabrication, we have, in most cases, carefully compared the FET properties of oligofurans with oligothiophene analogs fabricated under the same conditions. OTFT data for oligofurans and their oligothiophene analogues are summarised in Table 2. 6F, DH-6F, and 8F19 were chosen to enable a direct comparison with some of the most studied and well-understood oligothiophene analogues 6T, DH-6T, and 8T. The heteroatom effect was evaluated for oligomers of different lengths (which affects HOMO/LUMO levels and reorganization energy) and for alkyl chain-substituted molecules (which usually improves the morphology of thin films).

The output characteristics (Fig. 6 and 7) displayed distinct linear and saturated regimes, and the transfer curve showed good linearity of the IDS1/2vs. VG throughout the entire range. The FET mobility values of 8F and DH-6F (0.066 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively at 70 °C) are very similar to those of oligothiophene analogues measured under similar conditions.19,45 The mobility of DHS-4F is 0.07 cm2 V−1 S−1, similar to that of DHS-4T, with an on/off ratio of 104 (Fig. 6 top and Table 2). Fig. 6  Transfer (left) and output (right) curves of DHS-4F on Si/SiO2/HMDS (top) and DH2F-Ant on Si/SiO2 (bottom) at a deposition temperature of 70 °C. The s-shaped output characteristic of DH2F-Ant is due to the contact resistance.  Fig. 7  Transfer (left) and output (right) curves of DH-7F on Si/SiO2 (top) and Si/SiO2/PMMA (bottom). The threshold voltage (VT) of a semiconductor film depends, among many factors, on the off-set between the Fermi level of the metal electrode (−5.1 eV for Au), and the HOMO energy of the corresponding semiconductor. Considering lower oxidation potentials of oligofurans (Table 1), it is thus not surprising that they show systematically lower VT values than their thiophene analogues (Table 2). For example, for DHS-4F, VT is −3 V, while for the thiophene analogue, DHS-4T, VT ranges from −9 V to −13 V.23 The Ion/off values for oligofurans range from 104 to 106, similar to oligothiophene analogues. The high on/off ratio of oligofurans, besides being a favourable property for OFETs, is yet another piece of evidence of their stability (oxidatively unstable compounds usually suffer from poor on/off ratio, due to the doping).The use of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the dielectric layer induces greater stability in the device, and allows repetitive cycling of the OFETs with oligofurans. Remarkably stable devices were fabricated with DH-7F on PMMA dielectric: 8 hours of constant cycling (>36000 cycles in vacuum) reduce the mobility by only ∼10% (Fig. 8a).47 Thus, device stability under repeated cycling as well as the above-mentioned thermal stability of oligofurans demonstrate the remarkable robustness of oligofurans as the active layer in thin-film devices.48 Fig. 8  (a) Transfer curve of DH-7F on Si/SiO2/PMMA, under constant cycling under vacuum. (b) Electroluminescence of a bottom-contact OFET based on DH-7F. The top image shows the device under external illumination. The bottom image shows electroluminescence appearing in the vicinity of the drain electrode upon biasing of the gated device. One of the advantages of oligofurans vs. oligothiophenes is their efficient emission properties, which are of interest for the development of organic light-emitting transistors (OLET).29,49 Optical imaging of OFETs with DH-6F and DH-7F revealed the appearance of greenish-yellow electroluminescence upon biasing the devices (when the gate voltage was “on”). This indicates that the device can function as an OLET as well. The charge recombination zone is situated at the interface of the drain electrode (Fig. 8b), which is expected for an electron injection limited device.49 However, the electroluminescence was strong enough to be observed with ambient light (Fig. S4).† This observation sets a starting point for future OLET development.DiscussionOver the past few decades, oligothiophene-containing molecules have been intensively studied as organic electronic materials. Oligofurans, however, have been overlooked until very recently. The question of the performance of oligofurans in OFET devices, thus, was unanswered. Several groups computationally studied the charge transport properties of oligofurans. Hutchison et al. addressed the importance of the heteroatom in oligothiophenes, oligofurans, and oligopyrrols.8a Their calculations indicated higher hole transfer rates for oligofurans in comparison with oligothiophenes. In addition, the calculated reorganization energies (λ) for oligofurans were lower than those for the corresponding oligothiophenes. However, at the time of that study8a there were no single-crystal experimental structures of oligofurans, thus the intermolecular arrangements had to be assumed. Two reports have used our X-ray crystal data12 to calculate theoretical charge mobility.50,51 Mohakud et al. calculated the hole and electron mobility of 6F, and found it to be almost 5 times higher than that of 6T (with μh of 0.153 and 0.0351 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 6F and 6T, respectively).50,52 Huang et al. calculated the effective electronic coupling and the reorganization energies in oligofurans.51 They also looked at the possible hopping pathways in the crystal lattice, and concluded that charge mobility in 6F should be more direction-dependant than that of 6T because of the shorter inter-plane distances in 6F compared with 6T in one direction (and similar spacing in other directions). The calculated maximum hole mobility in the b axial direction is nearly 17 times larger than is found in 6T (0.167 and 0.009 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 6F and 6T, respectively) while in the c axial direction the mobility of 6F (0.010 cm2 V−1 s−1) is slightly higher than that of 6T (0.006 cm2 V−1 s−1, which shows very small dependence in the directionality).51 Thus, the theory predicts that the charge mobilities in oligofurans should be similar or even better than in oligothiophenes, mainly because of the smaller inter-molecular distance, and in spite of the smaller heteroatom. It must be noted that the above computational studies consider the property of single crystals and do not account for the morphology and disorder, which plays a major part in thin-film device performance. A noticeable example from our study is the significant difference in mobility between 6F and its alkylated derivative, DH-6F.19At the molecular level, one significant difference between oligofurans and oligothiophenes is the stiffer conjugated backbone of the former. For example, the calculated twisting potential for 6F is considerably steeper than for 6T: twisting 6F to a 35° inter-ring twist angles requires 12.5 kcal mol−1, while similar twisting in 6T requires only 2.3 kcal mol−1.12 The higher twisting potential of oligofurans should thus increase their “tolerance” to bulky substituents in the β-positions which would have caused twisting deformations in oligo- and polythiophenes.53As the charge transport efficiency is critically affected by molecular organization (‘packing’) in the solid state,54 it is interesting to note the differences between the crystal packing arrangements of 6F12 and 6T.55 The oligomers 6F and 6T are structurally quite similar to each other, and their overall packing motif is almost superimposable. However, the distance between the nearest two parallel neighbouring planes of 6F is 2.55 Å as compared with 2.82 Å for 6T and the herringbone angle of 59° in 6F is midway between the values of pentacene (53°)56 and 6T (63°).55 Importantly, the average inter-ring C–C bond length in 6F (1.433 Å) is shorter than in 6T (1.442 Å). This may indicate a less aromatic and more quinoid structure for 6F.Oligofurans have a higher HOMO–LUMO gap than the corresponding oligothiophenes. Fig. 9 displays the calculated (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) HOMO–LUMO gaps for the discussed oligomers in the gas phase. Interestingly, the contribution of the styryl groups to the reduction of the HOMO–LUMO gap in oligofurans is significantly larger than in the corresponding oligothiophenes: while the HOMO–LUMO gap of DS-4T (2.51 eV) resembles that of 7T (2.50 eV) (oligomer with the same number of π-electrons), the HOMO-LUMO gap of DS-4F (2.73 eV) is as low as that of 9F (2.72 eV). Fig. 9  Calculated (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) orbital levels and HOMO–LUMO gaps of the oligofurans discussed (on top of each column, in eV). For D2F-Ant the HOMO–LUMO gap already becomes lower than that of the thiophene analogue D2T-Ant, which is in contrast to other oligomers discussed above. This difference is almost certainly due to the significant twist of D2T-Ant (25° for thiophene–anthracene link, Fig. 10). In contrast, the smaller size of the oxygen heteroatom, and the larger exo angle reduces the steric repulsion and explains the planar gas phase geometry of D2F-Ant. Fig. 10  Calculated (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) geometries of D2T-Ant and D2F-Ant. ConclusionsIn summary, we have synthesized and characterized a new series of oligofuran-containing molecules, and measured their charge-transport properties in OFET devices. Overall, oligofuran-containing molecules show good mobilities and on/off ratios, comparable with those of their oligothiophene analogues, with generally lower threshold voltages. Oligofurans are thermally stable, up to >300 °C; remarkable device stability was demonstrated by the extended stress cycling of OFETs based on DH-7F films. High luminescence quantum efficiencies of oligofurans make them better candidates than oligothiophenes for electroluminescent devices and we demonstrated their application in light-emitting transistors. The electronic effect of substituents, such as the styryl group, is significant in the oligofuran family, and in some aspects (band-gap reduction) is greater than that observed in the corresponding thiophenes. Overall, this work provides evidence that, in contrast to the previously accepted understanding, the presence of second row polarizable elements, such as sulfur, is not a prerequisite for successful OFET materials based on conjugated heterocyclic molecules.Considering several key advantages, such as high fluorescence, high rigidity and planarity of their derivatives, and availability of renewable chemical sources, oligofurans constitute an exciting new class of semiconducting materials with bright future in organic electronics.AcknowledgementsThe work in Israel was supported by the Minerva Foundation and Martin Kimmel Center for Molecular Design.
