    , Accepted 17th March 2023First published on 31st March 2023AbstractCopper antimony sulfide (Cu3SbS3) is considered a promising photovoltaic absorber material due to its abundance in soil, low cost and environmentally friendly constituents. However, production by methods that require high cost and abundant materials and the differences between the results obtained in the limited number of studies carried out limit the discovery of its photovoltaic performance. In this study, Cu3SbS3 thin films were produced for the first time using spin coating. Optical, morphological and structural characterization of the thin films produced using Cu and Sb in different ratios (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 1) was investigated in order to determine the optimum Cu to Sb ratio to form the Cu3SbS3 phase. According to the results obtained, the Cu3SbS3 phase was formed at higher Cu/Sb ratios. In order to produce Cu3SbS3 thin films with improved optical and morphological properties, the film was doped with boron (B), for the first time, and its properties were tested. It was seen that boron doping significantly improved the properties of the Cu3SbS3 thin film. The obtained results showed that the boron doped Cu3SbS3 thin film with improved properties, which can be easily produced using low-cost methods and dopant materials, is a suitable candidate as an absorber layer for high-performance solar cells.
1. Introduction
The development of cost-effective photovoltaic solar cells requires sustainable high-efficiency absorber materials that can be produced using inexpensive, non-toxic and soil-abundant elements, as well as straightforward manufacturing techniques.1–5 Although a record efficiency (26.7%) has been achieved with solar cells based on silicon (Si) technology, which dominates 90% of today's photovoltaic (PV) market, the high cost and material consumption of Si technology (for both mono- and poly-crystalline cells) necessitate the search for new technologies.6,7 As a result of ongoing studies, organic–inorganic hybrid, organic and inorganic thin-film solar cell varieties have been developed.8 Continuous research on inorganic thin-film solar cells has shown remarkable developments with Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and CdTe thin film solar cells, which provide high power conversion efficiencies of 22.6% and 22.1%, respectively. However, despite their high power conversion efficiencies, the elemental scarcity of In, the toxicity of Cd and the high cost of Ga limit the widespread use of this technology.7,9,10 As an alternative to these, new solar cell concepts such as organic solar cells, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (lead-free in particular1,4,5), quaternary kesterite compound Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and quantum dot solar cells have been developed in the past decade.8 The quaternary kesterite compound Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 (CZTSSe), which is non-toxic and has a high amount of precursor elements, is a suitable material for photovoltaic applications with optoelectronic properties similar to CIGS. A 12.6% efficiency has been obtained from solar cells using CZTSSe thin films. However, the formation of secondary phases (binary/ternary) during the preparation of these films as well as difficulties in composition control, due to the number of constituent elements, remain a serious obstacle for further development.11,12 Although DSSCs provide efficiency values of over 13%, the presence of an organic solvent within the DSSC device creates health and safety problems.13 Because of their ease of fabrication and lightweight nature, PSCs are one of the most cost-effective photovoltaic technologies among modern solar cells, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.5%. Despite their high efficiency, however, syntheses in solution commonly use high temperatures and toxic solvents, which are obstacles for the safety and sustainability of the process.14,15 To overcome these hurdles, new PV absorber materials based on inexpensive, non-toxic, chemically stable and earth-abundant elements have been investigated to produce materials with easily controllable stoichiometries, low defect densities and good optoelectronic properties.13,16–18
Copper antimony sulfide (CAS) compounds have been recently seen as a good alternative to conventional materials as they have suitable optical and electrical properties for PV applications, and good-quality crystals can be grown at lower temperatures (∼400–600 °C), unlike commonly used CIGS (∼986 °C), CdTe (∼1041 °C) and CZTS (∼990 °C) thin films (Fig. 1).7,19

CAS compounds, with potential applications in the field of photo-electrochemical cells, topological insulators, thermoelectricity, photovoltaics and supercapacitors, have attracted much attention from researchers because they are cheap, contain sustainable constituent elements, are low in toxicity and have high absorption coefficient values (∼105 cm−1).20–23 The CAS material group is formed in different crystalline phases, such as Cu12SbS13 (tetrahedrite), Cu3SbS3 (skinnerite and wittichenite), CuSbS2 (chalcostobite) and Cu3SbS4 (famatinite), due to small structural changes in the coordination sphere of Sb atoms.24 These different CAS composites have band gaps ranging from 0.5 to 2.14 eV.25 These superior properties make these materials attractive for many applications. Despite these favorable fundamental optoelectronic properties, among the CAS compounds, studies have focused on CuSbS2 thin films. In addition, PV devices that use CuSbS2 thin films as absorbent layers have serious problems, such as poor repeatability and relatively low efficiency values (3.22%).7,26,27 In these studies, it has been estimated that the CuSbS2 phase has an indirect band gap with a low gap mobility, indicating that it is unlikely to achieve the desired transport properties for use in photovoltaic applications. Subsequent studies have shown that Sb rich samples of this material can lead to the desired stoichiometry and an improved performance in photovoltaic cells. In addition, theoretical studies have suggested that Cu3SbS3 will be preferable in PV applications if it exhibits the necessary optical and transport properties.24,28,29 In subsequent theoretical and experimental studies, different optical band gap values of Cu3SbS3 thin films have been reported, i.e., 1.46 eV, 1.84 eV and 2.14 eV.30 Although the reported studies indicate the suitability of Cu3SbS3 as a photovoltaic cell absorber layer, the differences between the results obtained in the different studies are evident from the reported data. In addition, in studies so far, high-cost methods such as sputtering, vacuum thermal evaporation and the sputtering of Cu–Sb metals followed by sulfurization via a thermal evaporation method – requiring abundant precursor materials and difficult techniques – are used in the production of Cu3SbS3 thin films.31 For this reason, studies have primarily focused on the synthesis of material with improved properties using low cost and easy methods, with subsequent characterization of their PV properties.
Among these studies, one of the remarkable aspects has been the use of different ETL and HTL layers for FTO/WO3/Cs2TiBr6/Cu2SbS2/Au lead-free, environmentally friendly Ti-based PSCs, and the design of stable cells at 300 K depending on the parameters of the back contact thickness and defect density. This proposed system has a peak PCE of 20.40% in the visible spectrum, a Jsc of 24.3042 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.9717 V, and a Voc of 0.9717 V. It is calculated to give an FF of 86.24%.14
It is known that the addition of a dopant to the semiconductor improves the performance of the material. Generally, doping is done with metals such as Ga, Al, Zn, Mn, Na, Cu, Ca or Ag. However, it has been reported that doping with metals creates thermal instability and induces electron–hole pair recombination, which is detrimental to solar cell applications. Therefore, researchers have investigated doping of the semiconductor absorber with non-metallic elements. Boron is a potential non-metal dopant because it has a small ionic radius and high electronegativity.32
This study, for the first time reports, the synthesis of boron doped Cu3SbS3 thin films produced using a spin coating method. In order to form the Cu3SbS3 phase, the effect of the Cu and Sb molar ratio was investigated first. To determine the suitability of the boron doped Cu3SbS3 thin film for optoelectronic devices, its structural, morphological and optical properties were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), stylus profilometry and UV-Visible spectroscopy. It is thought that the obtained data will be a reference for the further development of low-cost and simple synthesis methods for new ternary semiconductor materials with multiphase structures for photovoltaic applications.
2. Experimental procedure
It has been reported that a small change in the Cu/Sb ratio directly affects the phase and optoelectronic properties of CAS compounds. Therefore, precise control over the Cu/Sb ratio is important to create the Cu3SbS3 phase and tune its properties.33 First, this study aimed to optimize the Cu/Sb molar ratio to prepare the Cu3SbS3 phase. For this purpose, precursor solutions of 1 M copper(II) chloride (CuCl2; ≥98%, Merck Co.), 1 M antimony(III) trichloride (SbCl3; ≥99%, Aldrich Chemical Co.) and 1 M sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3; ≥98%, Aldrich Chemical Co.) dissolved in ethanol were mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 2 h. Also, in order to examine the effect of boron doping on the properties of the thin films, a 0.1 M boric acid solution dissolved in ethanol was prepared and mixed using a magnetic stirrer for 2 h. Then, prepared solutions were mixed in the following molar ratios: Cu/S (1:1), Sb/S (1:1), Cu/Sb/S (0.1:1:1; 0.3:1:1; 0.5:1:1; 1:0.1:1; 1:0.3:1; 1:0.5:1) and Cu/Sb/S/B (1:0.1:1:0.1; 1:0.3:1:0.1; 1:0.5:1:0.1). A few drops of nitric acid were added to the solutions for complete dissolution, and they were stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 24 h. Glass substrates used for thin film coating were cleaned for 15 min successively in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized (DI) water in an ultrasonic bath. Then, these solutions were spin coated onto the cleaned glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min under ambient conditions. This process was repeated 5 times. Then, the thin films were annealed in a glove box at 400 °C for 10 h, and their structural, morphological and optical characterization was carried out. Experiments were repeated under the same and different conditions to test the reproducibility and repeatability and to produce thin films with optimum properties. For this, different coating times (30 s, 60 s and 120 s), rotating speeds (1000 rpm, 2000 rpm, 4000 rpm and 6000 rpm), annealing times (1 h, 4 h, 6 h, 10 h, 16 h and 24 h), number of coatings (3, 5 and 7 times) and solution concentrations (0.6 M and 1 M) were used. The obtained data as a result of these experiments were compatible with each other and showed repeatability. Optimum optical and morphological properties were reproducibly obtained from thin films coated for 60 seconds at 4000 rpm and annealed for 10 hours in the N2 atmosphere-glove box.
The thickness and surface roughness of the prepared thin films were measured using a surface profilometer (DektakXT stylus profilometer, Bruker) with a 2 μm stylus tip radius. The morphological properties and elemental content of the prepared thin films were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; EVO LS 10, Zeiss) at an acceleration voltage of 7 kV, and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS; i.e., EDAX, in combination with the SEM). The structural parameters of the prepared thin films were analyzed using XRD (X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 45 kV, 40 mA) in the 2θ range of 20–90°. Optical characterization of the prepared thin films was carried out using a PerkinElmer Lambda2 UV-vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. The Tauc plot (versus hϑ) was used to determine the optical energy bandgap (Eg) of the thin films. The Tauc equation used in calculating the optical band gaps of thin films is as follows:34 (1)where Eg is the band gap energy, h is the Planck constant, B is a constant, α is the absorption coefficient and ϑ is the photon frequency. In the above equation, superscript n depends on the nature of the electron transition, and a value of 1/2 indicates an allowed direct transition.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural analysis
In order to examine the effect of the Cu/Sb molar ratio in the compounds on the formation of the Cu3SbS3 phase, XRD measurements of the undoped and boron doped (0.1 M) binary/ternary CAS thin films prepared by mixing with different molar ratios (0–1 M) of Cu or Sb were performed, and the obtained diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 2. The sulfur content in the mixture was kept constant at 1 M. In the Cu:S and Sb:S thin films, which were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, it was seen that the hexagonal Cu1S1 (ICDD card no. 98-003-2106) and orthorhombic S3Sb2 (ICDD card no. 98-009-9798) phases were formed, respectively. It was observed that the hexagonal Cu1S1 (ICDD card no. 98-006-3327) and orthorhombic S3Sb2 (ICDD card no. 98-065-3959) phases were formed in the boron doped Cu:S and Sb:S thin films prepared at a ratio of 1:1, respectively. It was seen that the Cu3SbS3 phase was formed in CAS thin films mixed with 0.3 M Cu, 0.1 M Sb, boron doped 0.3 M Sb and 0.5 M Sb. All phases formed are shown in Table 1. According to the XRD results, it was observed that the Cu3SbS3 phase was formed at high Cu/Sb ratios due to the higher reactivity of Sb over Cu. These results were consistent with the EDS data. In addition, the obtained results showed that boron doping adjusted the reaction rate and increased the Cu/Sb ratio. This is an important parameter for obtaining thin films with the Cu3SbS3 phase.

3.2. Morphological analysis

Fig. 3 shows SEM images of undoped and boron doped CAS thin films prepared with different ratios of Cu or Sb. The SEM images showed that the Cu/Sb ratio strongly influences the morphology and structure of the films, including the grain size and shape. Thin films prepared with a low Cu content exhibited a more granular surface morphology. It was observed that thin films containing 0.5 M Cu and Sb had a more homogeneous morphology. In addition, it was observed that boron doping improved the morphology of the thin films and reduced the granular structure. These results, which are also supported by the EDS analysis, can be attributed to the good dispersion of the elements, due to the more controlled reaction between the CAS compounds with the doping of boron.

EDS analysis results of undoped and boron doped thin films with different Cu or Sb ratios prepared using spin coating are presented in Table 2. While the Cu/Sb ratio changed in the range of 0.03–0.05 at low Cu concentrations, these values changed between 0.04 and 0.25 at low Sb concentrations. However, this ratio showed an increase, changing between 0.03 and 0.52 with boron doping.

The measured surface roughness and thickness values of the prepared thin films measured using a stylus profilometer are shown in Fig. 4. The surface roughness of the thin films in which the effect of the Cu concentration was examined was higher than that of the other thin films. This is because there are more granular particles on the surface. With the doping of boron, the surface roughness of thin films decreased. As can be seen from the SEM images, the fact that the film surfaces became more homogeneous with the doping of boron resulted in a decrease in roughness. The thickness of the thin films, in which the effect of the Cu concentration was examined, was measured to be in the range of about 50–80 nm. The thickness of the thin films, in which the effect of the Sb concentration was examined, was measured to be in the range of about 50–80 nm. The thickness of the thin films in which the effect of boron doping was examined was measured to be in the range of about 60–100 nm (Table 3).

3.3. Optical analysis
The optical absorption of the thin films deposited on glass substrates was examined using UV-Vis spectroscopy. In the UV-Vis spectra of all of the CAS thin films, a broad and strong absorbance was seen in the range of 400–800 nm.35 It was observed that there was a slight decrease in the absorbance of Cu–S thin films at higher wavelengths, in accordance with the literature.36 For low Cu concentrations, it was seen that the absorption increased as the Cu concentration increased. For low Sb concentrations, it was observed that the absorption decreased as the Sb concentration increased. However, it was observed that boron doping significantly increased the absorption of thin films in the visible region. From the results obtained in this study, it has been demonstrated that boron doped Cu3SbS3 thin films produced using this easy and low-cost spin coating method for the first time are a suitable candidate as an absorber layer in photovoltaic applications (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of CAS thin films prepared with different molar ratios of Cu or Sb and doped with boron and comparative results. 
It is extremely important to examine the band gap of photovoltaic materials as this is critical in the absorption of solar energy for electricity generation.8 The Tauc plot was used to determine the effect of the Cu or Sb molar ratio and boron doping on the optical energy bandgap (Eg) of the Cu3SbS3 thin films. Band gap values calculated for Cu–S (1:1) (2.35 eV) and Sb–S (1:1) (2.38 eV) were within the range of values reported in the literature (eqn (1)).37,38 The band gap values calculated for the other triple Cu–Sb–S thin films were also in accordance with the literature (Fig. 6). The band gap values decreased as the Cu concentration increased for low Cu concentrations. The band gap values increased as the Sb concentration increased for low Sb concentrations. By contrast, the band gap values of the boron doped thin films decreased (Table 3). In general, the lower the band gap, the higher the light absorption capacity.39 The obtained UV spectra and band gap values are compatible with each other.

4. Conclusions
In this study, the Cu3SbS3 phase was successfully and reproducibly formed for the first time using a spin coating method. According to the results obtained, it was observed that the Cu3SbS3 phase was formed at a high Cu/Sb ratio. It was also observed that the boron additive controlled the reaction rate and increased the Cu/Sb ratio. In addition, boron addition provided improved morphology and optical properties. This study, in which the boron-doped Cu3SbS3 thin film was produced for the first time using spin coating, may shed light on the fabricating of low-cost and high-performance solar cells.
