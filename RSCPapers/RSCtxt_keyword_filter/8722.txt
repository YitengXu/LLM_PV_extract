    AbstractThe characterization of the interfacial charge transfer processes taking place in dye solar cells made using the most efficient ruthenium complexes, namely cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719), tris(isothiocyanato)-ruthenium(II)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine-4,4′,4′′- tricarboxylic acid, tris-tertrabutylammonium salt (Black Dye) and cis-bis(isothiocanate)(4,4′-bis(5-hexylthiophene-2-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(4-carboxylic acid-4′-carboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) sodium (C101), has been carried out. The comparison between these devices shows that devices made using N719 have the slowest recombination dynamics between the photo-injected electrons and the oxidized electrolyte. Moreover, for devices made using Black Dye, the dye ground state regeneration dynamics are faster than for C101 and N719. The implications for future ruthenium dyes are discussed.

Broader context
Dye sensitized solar cells are nowadays an interesting alternative to the highly extended use of traditional silicon solar cells. A wide range of dyes have been designed and tested in complete functional devices as solar-to-energy converters. However, only a few ruthenium complexes have been able to reach solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies as high as 10–11%. The aim of this paper is the study of three of the most efficient ruthenium complexes, namely N719, C101 and Black Dye. Although N719 and Black Dye have been used as standards for measurements in a wide range of reports, neither of them have been measured and compared in the same conditions. In addition, the comparison of these two well-known dyes with the recently reported C101 sensitizer is included in this study.

Introduction
In the last five years rapid progress towards stable and efficient dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have been possible thanks to the development of new ruthenium polypyridyl dyes.1 Such dyes, when covalently attached to nanocrystalline TiO2 nanoparticles and irradiated with light, are capable of generating large photocurrents, which are nowadays in the order of twenty milliamps per square centimetre. A wide range of ruthenium dyes have been designed, but only a few have been able to reach solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies as high as 10–11%2 due to different reasons ranging from inappropriate dye oxidation potential,3 low energy level of the dye excited state4 and secondary reactions still not well defined between the dye and the red/ox electrolyte.5 Certainly, of all the organic ligands used to coordinate the ruthenium centre, the use of 2,2′-bipyridyl moieties has been the most successful synthetic approach,6 when combined with thiocyanate ligands, giving hexa-coordinated ruthenium(II) complexes absorbing almost in the near IR region of the solar spectrum (λ = 700 nm).7 Nowadays, a new ruthenium polypyridyl complex named C1018 that contains the above mentioned features has been used to achieve efficiencies above 11% in a reproducible manner under standard conditions (100 mW cm−2, 1.5 AM G solar spectrum). Indeed, the study of the relationship between the dye structure and their light-to-electrical current conversion performance is of utmost interest, since it will help to understand the parameters to design efficient and robust sensitizers for DSSC, as well as to determine the reactions occurring at the molecular level between the different cell components that limit the device performance.
In this paper, we aim to study in detail the three most efficient dyes reported so far in the DSSC literature (Fig. 1) using liquid electrolyte composed by the red/ox pair I2/I3− and TiO2 as electron transport mesoporous material. Moreover, we will monitor the interfacial charge transfer reactions taking place at the interface of these devices and observe the differences between electron injection, back electron transfer from the photo-injected electrons at the TiO2 and the oxidized species at the device (either dye or electrolyte) and the regeneration process between the electrolyte and the oxidized dye. Although for N719 there is a wide range of studies available9 and, surely, this is also the case for the complex named Black Dye10 (BD), neither the former nor the latter have been previously measured and compared under the same conditions, which is, in our opinion, an important factor to take into account when the researchers look for clear dye structure–device function correlation. In addition to these two widely know sensitizers, we have included in our study the new paradigm, the ruthenium complex C101, and analyzed its performance too.

Experimental section
Materials
The solvents, and other reagents or products used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The N719 and Black Dye were purchased from Solaronix. The C101 complex was received as a courtesy from the group of Professor Grätzel at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland).
Optical, electrochemical and spectroscopic experiments
The UV-visible and emission spectra were recorded using a 1 cm path length quartz cell on a Shimadzu© UV spectrophotometer 1700 and an Aminco-Bowman© series 2 luminescence spectrometer with a temperature controller, respectively. The electrochemical data was obtained employing a conventional three-electrode cell connected to a CH Instruments© 660c potentiostat-galvanostat. For cyclic voltammetry, we used a platinum foil as working electrode, a calomel reference electrode (saturated calomel electrode, SCE), and a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode. The picoseconds to microsecond emission lifetime measurements were carried out with a Lifespec© picosecond fluorescence lifetime spectrometer from Edinburgh Instruments (http://www.edinst.com). As excitation source, a fast diode laser, with 405 nm nominal wavelength, was used. The instrument response measured at the FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) was shorter than 360 ps. Laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) measurements were carried out with a home-built system as reported before.11 Charge extraction and photovoltage measurements were carried out using a home-built system. In brief, the charge extraction data were acquired using a pulse generated by an array of white LEDs. The decay was monitored using a Tektronics© oscilloscope TDS 2022 and recorded using the Tektronics© data acquisition software. We applied different light intensities to achieve different open circuit voltages of the cell, and straight after the light pulse the device was short-circuited to extract the charge. All electronic processes to short-circuit the photovoltaic cell were controlled with a home-made electronic switch. For the photovoltage transients, the pulse was generated with red-emitting diodes while the cell was illuminated with the same array of white light diodes.
Nanoparticle synthesis and film preparation
The nanocrystalline TiO2 particles were synthesized as reported before.12 In brief: titanium isopropoxide (40 mL, 0.13 mol) was added to glacial acetic acid (9.12 g) under argon atmosphere while stirring. The reaction mixture was cooled into an ice bath and 0.1 M nitric acid (240 mL) was added while vigorously stirring. The mixture was heated in an oil bath at 80 °C for 8 h and, after cooling, was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. The resulting product was diluted to 5% in weight of TiO2 by adding water and was then was autoclaved at 220 °C for 12 h. The aqueous phase was removed by centrifugation and the solid nanoparticles were isolated and rinsed twice with ethanol. An ultrasonic horn was used to break the aggregates and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The solid nanoparticles were diluted to 15% in TiO2 weight using ethyl cellulose and terpineol and the paste was homogenized by ball milling.
The Al2O3 mesoporous films were synthesized using commercially available Al2O3 nanoparticles.
Device preparation and characterization
In the present work, we have utilized and characterized two different types of device. Highly transparent thin film devices were utilized for time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and L-TAS experiments. These devices were made using 4 μm thick films and sensitized with the ruthenium complexes until the absorbance at the metal-to-ligand charge transfer band (MLCT) of the sensitized film was 0.6 absorption units. On the other hand, for optimized efficiencies, all the devices studied during this work were made using 16 μm thick films consisting of a layer of between 8–12 μm of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles and a layer of 4 μm of 400 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (scatter layer). In both cases, the films were deposited onto a conducting glass substrate (Nippon Sheet Glass Co. with 10 Ω cm−2 resistance) using the manual doctor blade technique. For the thin film devices, the area was 1 cm2 while in the case of the thick film DSSC, the active area was between 0.14 and 0.15 cm2. The counter electrodes were made by spreading a 5 × 10−3 M solution of H2PtCl6 in ethanol onto a conducting glass substrate with a small drilled hole to allow the introduction of the liquid electrolyte using low vacuum pressure. Two liquid electrolytes were used depending on the measurements; electrolyte A, which does not contain tert-butyl pyridine, is composed of 1 M BMII (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI and 0.1 M GuNCS (guanidinium thiocyanate) in acetonitrile:valeronitrile 85:15, and electrolyte B, which contains tert-butylpyridine, was made using 1 M BMII (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.1 M GuSCN and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile:valeronitrile 85:15. The photovoltaic measurements were carried out with a 150 W xenon lamp from ABET Instruments with the appropriate filter for the correct simulation of the 1.5 AM G solar spectrum. The incident light power was calibrated using a silicon photodiode previously calibrated at 1000 W m−2 at 1.5 AM G.
Results and discussion
Spectroscopic properties: UV-visible absorption spectra and photoluminescence measurements
The absorbance spectra of the three different dyes anchored onto 4 μm thick Al2O3 and TiO2 mesoporous films were measured.
The films were immersed into a 10−3 M solution of each dye using as solvent a mixture of acetonitrile:tert-butanol (1:1) for N719 and C101, while in the case of the Black Dye, we used ethanol. The lowest absorption energy band was centered at λ = 523 nm for N719 and λ = 533 nm for C101. The absorption bands were assigned to the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process between the ruthenium atom and the polypyridyl ligands. In the case of the Black Dye, two MLCT transition bands were observed centered at λ = 414 nm, assigned to a spin-allowed Ru→terpyridine ligand charge transfer (CT) transition and at λ = 617 nm, assigned to a medium intensity singlet-singlet spin-allowed MLCT transition.10b The absorption bands at λ = 388 nm (N719), λ = 396 nm (C101) and λ = 335 nm (Black Dye) were assigned to the π–π* electronic transitions.
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the Black Dye is red shifted compared to the N719 or C101 dyes. This bathochromic shift is due to the favoured stabilization of the excited state by the electro donation action of the thiocyanato anionic ligands as well as the conjugated terpyridine ligand anchored to the ruthenium.13

The absorbance spectra of C101 and the Black Dye were also measured when chenodeoxycholic acid was present in the film, as a co-adsorbent to prevent possible dye aggregation processes, as reported in the literature for efficient device performance.14 Either the Al2O3 or the TiO2 films were immersed into a 300 μM chenodeoxycholic acid acetonitrile:tert-butanol (1:1) solution and into a 200 μM Black Dye and 20 mM chenodeoxycholic acid ethanol solution.
The use of the chenodeoxycholic acid (cheno) as co-adsorbent may also shift the semiconductor conduction band and, in the case of the Black Dye, it may act as a buffer by changing the dye protonation degree onto the surface of the nanoparticles and, thus, changing the maximum of the dye absorbance towards the blue.15
However, in our case, the absorbance spectra of the Black Dye and the C101 in cheno/TiO2 films present a smaller amount of adsorbed dye than expected, but no shift at the absorbance maximum was observed.
Using the same Al2O3 sensitized films, the luminescence spectra of the different dyes were measured (figure not shown). The maximum luminescence wavelength was found to be λem = 731 nm for N719 and λem = 759 nm for C101. In the case of the Black Dye we were unable to measure the complete emission spectrum due to the limits of our system but it is worthwhile to notice that the emission peak was estimated to be near 900 nm. For the samples with the cheno co-adsorbed molecule, no shift was observed for C101 or the Black Dye emission spectrum.
The emission decay kinetics of the excited state were measured for the three dyes too, either in Al2O3 or in TiO2 films. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the amplitude of the different emission decays for the TiO2 sensitized samples is quenched when compared with the Al2O3 sensitized films under the same conditions. The quenching is assigned to the efficient photo-induced electron injection process from the dye-excited state into the semiconductor conduction band. In the case of the Al2O3 films, the dye excited state is below the conduction band of the metal oxide, which prevents the electron injection reaction. From Fig. 3, we can already estimated that the C101 dye has the highest photo-induced electron injection yield.

In previous work, we have shown that the presence of active red/ox electrolyte induced changes on the emission decay dynamics of polypyridyl ruthenium complexes.5a The reasons for those changes are still under active debate, but several authors have already proved the interaction between the dye and the red/ox active species at the iodine/iodide liquid electrolyte.5b–d In order to shed some light onto this topic, we have prepared non-functional devices using, as mesoporous material, Al2O3 sensitized films with liquid red/ox active iodine/iodide electrolyte. The results of our TCSPC measurements for the different set of dyes anchored onto Al2O3 and TiO2 films measured under air conditions and in complete devices are listed in Table 1.

The measured lifetime of all the dyes is around 20 ns when anchored onto mesoporous Al2O3 films. Chenodeoxycholic acid was used as coadsorbent for the C101 and Black Dye cells. Afterwards, complete devices were prepared using these films and the lifetime of the cells were measured at equal acquisition time and experimental parameters. In all the cases, the luminescence amplitude is not quenched in the presence of electrolyte. However, the emission decay kinetics in the case of C101 and Black Dye devices are faster, in clear contrast with the non-functional cells sensitized with N719.
On the other hand, the luminescence decays of C101 and Black Dye non-functional devices were also measured without the cheno molecule as co-adsorbent. The presence of the cheno molecule does not affect the signal amplitude, however, the emission decay dynamics of the Black Dye sample are slower (Fig. 4). This behaviour is probably due to the fact that chenodeoxycholic acid avoids some dye-dye interactions which occur in the absence of it. (Fig. 4).16

Electron recombination measurements. L-TAS experiments
Laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) measurements were carried on dye-sensitized 4 μm thick TiO2 mesoporous nanocrystalline films and in complete devices too. For the complete cells, we used different electrolytes as mentioned in the experimental section: electrolyte A (Fig. 5) and electrolyte B. Since each sample has a different absorption maximum, we used the appropriate excitation wavelength to keep the laser pulse energy invariable. The most relevant data for the electron recombination process between the photo-injected electrons at the TiO2 and the oxidized dye (dye+/e-TiO2) are listed in Table 2.

As can be seen in Fig. 5, the presence of the electrolyte induces a decrease in the signal amplitude and faster decay dynamics, which we assign to the efficient regeneration of the dye cations by the electrolyte which occurs much faster (on a nanosecond time scale) than the back electron transfer from the TiO2 to the oxidized dyes. Furthermore, the transient decay shows a slow phase that we have previously assigned to electrons at the TiO2 or new species formed due to the presence of the iodine/iodide liquid electrolyte. On the other hand, it seems important to notice that in the case of the devices made using the Black Dye, the yield (amplitude of the transient signal at λprobe = 1000 nm) is much less, suggesting that either the species are not formed or the regeneration process occurs much more efficiently and the dye cation species disappear faster than the time scale used in our experiments.
Electrochemistry
The electrochemical properties of the ruthenium complexes were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile (N719 and C101) and in ethanol (Black Dye) using a 10−3 M solution of each dye with 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6).
The LUMO energy levels can be obtained using eqn (1), where q is the elementary charge and E0,0 is the excited-state zero-zero energy, measured from the intersection between the absorption and emission spectra of the dyes. (Equation 1)
As listed in Table 3, we observed for the N719 dye an oxidation potential of 0.73 V vs. SCE. The electrochemical wave was irreversible, in good agreement with previous results published in the scientific literature.17 In the case of the C101 dye, we obtained a quasi-reversible wave at 0.71 V vs. SCE. That was also the case for the Black Dye. All the waves were assigned to the formation of the RuII/III redox couple.

Light-to-energy conversion measurements
Once we analyzed all the photo-physical and electrochemical properties of the ruthenium dyes, we carried out our measurements and analysis of the photo-electrochemical properties of the complete solar cells.
Complete devices were prepared as described below, co-sensitizing the films with the cheno molecules in the case of C101 and Black Dye and using Electrolyte B in all cases.
The incident photon to current efficiencies (IPCE) for all the DSSC were higher than 70%, with C101 being the most efficient dye, with a maximum conversion efficiency of 96% at λ = 530 nm (Fig. 6), which is in good agreement with the electron injection data measured using TCSPC. In the case of the Black Dye, we obtained proficient photon-to-current conversions near to the IR region. For example, the conversion efficiency at λ = 755 nm was 35%, while for C101 and N719 it was only 7% and 3%, respectively.
 Fig. 6  IPCE of DSSC using N719, C101 and the Black Dye. The electrolyte used was Electrolyte B. 
As can be seen in Table 4, the photo-current obtained for the DSC under standard conditions of simulated sun light (100 mW cm−2, 1.5 AM G) are in good agreement with the IPCE values. The devices made using the C101 dye have not only the highest current, but also the highest light-to-energy conversion efficiency.

The I–V curves for N719, C101 and Black Dye measured at different light intensities are depicted in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the highest efficiency in all cases were recorded when they were irradiated using sun simulated light with an intensity of 50 mW cm−2. For the devices made using N719, we have always obtained higher photo-voltages than for the devices made using C101 or the Black Dye. These results confirm published work on the difference between homoleptic and heteroleptic ruthenium dyes.18
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent vs. voltage plot for N719, C101 and Black Dye cells measured at different light intensities. 
This observation is rather interesting since the oxidation potentials between C101 and N719 are not much different. On the other hand, C101 and the Black Dye have different organic ligands coordinated to the ruthenium center than N719. In the former case, the heteroleptic complex has a moiety that contains sulfur atoms in its structure, while in the later case the ligand is more conjugated than the bipyridine ligands present in either N719 or C101. Recently, it has been described that the presence of a high degree of conjugation on the organic ligand can induce faster recombination dynamics between the photo-injected electrons at the semiconductor and the oxidized electrolyte.19
The use of light-induced photovoltage and charge extraction techniques has been very useful to elucidate the nature of such loss in voltage and the catalytic process involved in the electron/electrolyte recombination reaction.

Fig. 8 illustrates the charge density vs. voltage plot for the different DSSC.
 Fig. 8  Electron density vs. voltage plots for the different DSSC and the corresponding fits. 
All the measured experimental points for the charge extraction experiment lie more or less under the same exponential curve and can be fitted to eqn (2). V(t) = V0ekt(Equation 2)
These results indicate that none of the dyes shifts the TiO2 conduction band energy level with respect to the electrolyte to such a degree that could justify the differences in voltage. Notice that the dyes have a different number of protons (2 in the case of N719, 1 for C101 and Black Dye), and the absorption mode of N719 can cause an up-shift of the conduction band. However, this behaviour is masked by the effect of the counteracting proton-induced down shift of the conduction band energy. Thus, we measured the electron lifetimes for the different DSSC plotted vs. the electron density (Fig. 9) and we observed that at higher electron density, corresponding to the maximum Voc on the DSSC, the recombination lifetime for N719 is slower when compared with the C101 or the Black Dye. The increase of recombination dynamics can explain the lower Voc observed for devices using C101 and the Black Dye, which has also been observed in other ruthenium dyes bearing more conjugated ligands, such as phenanthroline,20,1getc.

Conclusions
We have evaluated, using identical conditions, the different charge transfer reactions that limit the light-to-energy conversion performance on the most efficient sensitizers known nowadays in dye sensitized solar cells. We demonstrated that the dye C101 has the highest electron injection yield, which is in good agreement with the IPCE and the photocurrent measured in complete devices. Interestingly, the presence of typical iodine/iodide redox electrolyte (Electrolyte A) induces faster emission kinetics for C101 and Black Dye DSC while in the case of N719 the luminescence decay process is almost unaffected. We assigned the emission quenching dynamics to the interaction of the electrolyte with the dyes bearing more conjugated organic ligands coordinating the ruthenium metal centre. In addition, in the case of the Black Dye, using the cheno molecules, to avoid the formation of molecular aggregates on the TiO2 surface, we also observed faster emission decay dynamics. On the other hand, the photo-induced electron recombination dynamics for all dyes showed typical stretched exponential decays. However, the analysis of the results obtained in complete devices shows that Black Dye DSSC have very efficient regeneration dynamics since no signal was detected for dye cations in the presence of iodine/iodide electrolyte.
Finally, light-induced photovoltage transient spectroscopy was employed to investigate the origin of the lower voltages on C101 and Black Dye DSSC when compared to N719 cells. The results show that, for the above mentioned dyes, at the same charge density they do have higher recombination dynamics than the N719 DSSC. This observation implies that for the design of new and efficient ruthenium complexes, we ought to block the interactions between the organic ligands, used in the complex to increase the dye absorbance in the red region of the solar spectrum, and the red/ox active species at the iodine/iodide electrolyte.

Broader context
Dye sensitized solar cells are nowadays an interesting alternative to the highly extended use of traditional silicon solar cells. A wide range of dyes have been designed and tested in complete functional devices as solar-to-energy converters. However, only a few ruthenium complexes have been able to reach solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies as high as 10–11%. The aim of this paper is the study of three of the most efficient ruthenium complexes, namely N719, C101 and Black Dye. Although N719 and Black Dye have been used as standards for measurements in a wide range of reports, neither of them have been measured and compared in the same conditions. In addition, the comparison of these two well-known dyes with the recently reported C101 sensitizer is included in this study.
