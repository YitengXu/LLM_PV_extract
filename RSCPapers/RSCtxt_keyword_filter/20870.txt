    , Accepted 12th January 2022First published on 13th January 2022Abstractγ-CsPbI3 solar cells have achieved promising efficiencies, yet the quantitative understanding of their defect properties is limited due to the severe computational challenges when using hybrid functionals. We have discovered an algorithm to improve the convergence speed through a combination of structural relaxation with a strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) Meta-generalized-gradient approximation (Meta-GGA) functional and further ionic and electronic calculations with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional. The static HSE calculations with SCAN results as inputs are qualitatively reliable in defect calculations, different from one-ionic step HSE calculations based on GGA inputs. Contradictory to previous GGA defect results, a suppressed bipolar conductivity by p-type VCs and VPb, and n-type CsI is found. Additionally, stable bipolar defects Iint and CsPb, with features of strong bond orbital coupling or structural deformation, detrimentally serve as carrier-traps. This strengthened bond orbital coupling in γ-CsPbI3 causes more defect charge states than organic perovskites with larger lattice constants.
Introduction
Organic lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are regarded as promising candidates of renewable energy materials in applications of solar cells, light emitting diodes and sensors.1–5 They are furnished with advantages including moderate bandgaps, good defect tolerance, low cost of raw materials and facile synthesis.6–9 Unfortunately, state-of-the-art organic LHP fabrication lacks long-term stability.10 Thermal and operational decomposition of monovalent organic cations (i.e., methylammonium and formamidinium) causes detrimental fragment migration and crystal degradation, which hinder their commercialization.11,12
An inorganic element of cesium has been proposed to replace organic cations in order to enhance the colloidal stability of LHPs.13,14 Totally-inorganic LHPs are thermally and chemically stable with a prolonged device lifetime. For example, β-CsPbI3 solar cells reach a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4% and only lose 5% efficiency after continuous operation.15 However, compared with hybrid LHPs, devices based on inorganic LHPs are still inferior in terms of efficiency,16 probably due to the different electronic profiles of intrinsic defects that play significant roles in device performance,17,18 yet are missing a direct physical understanding. Therefore, an improved investigation of intrinsic defects is a key to efficiency enhancement of inorganic LHPs. Still, reliable theoretical calculations are needed because defect formation at an atomistic level is difficult to characterize experimentally. Moreover, the density functional theory method has been proven to be one of the most efficient and accurate methods in the calculations of perovskite structures.19–23
So far, limited defect research in α-, γ- and δ-CsPbI3 based on first-principles calculations has been carried out using generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) functionals.24–27 It was found that energetically favorable defects are shallow while deep-level defects are less likely to form. However, the Perdew–Burke–Enzerhof (PBE) GGA functional applied in these studies is not quantitatively accurate enough to predict defect levels due to a bandgap underestimation and an over-delocalized nature of charge density.28,29 Alternatively, the hybrid functional can be highly attractive because of an incorporation of exact Hartree–Fock approximation in the exchange term of GGAs.30,31 Van de Walle's group applied the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) screened Coulomb hybrid functional to calculate PbI and IPb defects in γ-CsPbI3.32 Meanwhile, iodine-related and energetically favorable defects are investigated by the PBESOL0 and HSE hybrid functional in α-CsPbI3, respectively.33–35 However, the complete understanding of electronic and optical properties calls for a systematic study of native point defects by hybrid functionals, which are still lacking in γ-CsPbI3, probably due to the challenging nature of hybrid calculations.
Supercell calculations by hybrid functionals are restricted by prohibitive computational costs and oversized matrix diagonalization that are about two orders of magnitude larger than GGAs.36 Early attempts based on static HSE calculations with structural relaxation by PBE (defined as PHSE) are usually inaccurate because of large structural deviations.37 Recently, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional has been constructed, with computational costs similar to GGAs and improved accuracy.38,39 Still, whether SCAN can help improve accuracy in defect calculations is unknown.
In this work, we carry out a point defect study of the energetically favorable γ-CsPbI3 which is the most stable crystal phase among the “black” phases at low temperature.40,41 All the point defects are considered here, including vacancies (i.e., VCs, VPb and VI), interstitial defects (i.e., Csint, Pbint and Iint) and antisite defects (i.e., CsPb, PbCs, CsI, PbI, ICs and IPb), with the charge states labelled using a superscript. We propose to conduct structural relaxation by HSE with SCAN results as inputs that largely improve the convergence efficiency, while static HSE calculations with structural relaxation by SCAN (defined as “SHSE”) can serve as a quick check that yields semi-quantitatively similar results to HSE, verified by both GaN and γ-CsPbI3. Next, in our defect calculations using the HSE functional, we discover a bipolar conductivity profile, with both p-type and n-type conductivity possible under moderate chemical potential conditions,42 different from the previous unipolar results using the GGA functional.24 However, the conductivity is restricted by a high defect formation energy (DFE) and a multiple transition processes of p-type VCs and VPb, and n-type CsI. Moreover, as indicated by the results of Iint and CsPb, defects with both electron- and hole-captured processes,43 defined as bipolar defects, tend to couple strongly with the surrounding electronic environment through the bond orbital coupling mechanism44 and may introduce large reconstructions, respectively, serving as non-radiative recombination centers. This enhanced bond orbital coupling in γ-CsPbI3 leads to more detrimental gap states than in their organic counterparts.
Methods
The first-principles calculations are based on density functional theory45,46 and the projector augmented wave approach,47 using Vienna ab initio simulation package code.48
For γ-CsPbI3 unit cell calculations, we apply PBE, SCAN, SHSE and HSE functionals to calculate the lattice constants and bandgaps. The plane-wave cutoff energies in PBE and SCAN calculations are set as 400 eV with a Γ-centered Brillouin zone meshing. Meanwhile, the plane-wave cutoff energies in SHSE and HSE calculations are set as 300 eV. A default mixing ratio of 0.25 in HSE yields a bandgap of 1.47 eV. To fit the experimental bandgap, which is a standard practice in a few other semiconductor systems,32,49 we tune the ratio to be 0.41. The same setting of mixing ratio is applied in the defect calculation of γ-CsPbI3. In all the γ-CsPbI3 calculations, we consider the spin–orbit coupling effect, which splits Pb p state degeneracy.50
For γ-CsPbI3 defect calculations, a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell containing 80 atoms and a 1 × 1 × 2 k-point Brillouin zone meshing are used. Relaxation of the supercell is performed by SCAN functional with a 400 eV plane-wave cutoff energy. Subsequent relaxation and electronic calculations are done using the HSE functional with a 300 eV energy cutoff. The range separation parameter μ is set as 0.2 and the mixing ratio is adjusted to 0.41 for the HSE functional. The accuracy in supercell energy is set to 10−5 eV per atom, and relaxation will consistently perform until the forces are less than 10−3 eV Å−1. The Freysoldt–Neugebauer–Van de Walle (FNV) finite-size correction is introduced to reach the single dilute limit.51,52 We strictly follow the correction algorithm listed in these two papers. At last, a rigid shift of 0.68 eV, which is a typical practice in defect calculations with GGA functionals,24 is added to the CBM of the SCAN band edge in order to match the HSE bandgap.
Results and discussions
Chemical potential of γ-CsPbI3
To calculate the DFE and defect transition levels, the ranges of chemical potentials μi should be firstly derived. μi for γ-CsPbI3 HSE calculations should obey the following conditions to avoid precipitation of secondary phases and to maintain γ-CsPbI3 stability:53 (1)where ΔHf is the formation energy of the compounds. The desirable region of μi using the HSE functional is labeled as a yellow region ABCD in Fig. 1a. The narrow shape is due to the low dissociation energy (−0.05 eV) of γ-CsPbI3 into CsI and PbI2, consistent with strictly stoichiometric synthesis.54 In this area, three representative limits, I-rich point A (μCs = −3.10 eV; μI = −0.10 eV; μPb = −1.79 eV), I-medium point E (μCs = −2.62 eV; μI = −0.58 eV; μPb = −0.83 eV) and I-poor point C (μCs = −2.14 eV; μI = −1.02 eV; μPb = 0 eV), are selected.

Similarly, the ranges of chemical potentials μi for the SCAN calculations are constrained by (2)
The desirable region of μi using the SCAN functional is labeled as the yellow region of ABCD in Fig. 1b. The area of the SCAN results is larger than the HSE ones due to a higher dissociation energy of −0.14 eV. Therefore, I-rich point A (μCs = −3.53 eV, μI = −0.08 eV, μPd = 1.79 eV), I-medium point E (μCs = −3.03 eV, μI = −0.52 eV, μPd = −0.81 eV) and I-poor point C (μCs = −2.53 eV, μI = −0.96 eV, μPd = 0 eV) are selected.
Comparison of exchange–correlation functionals
To find the most efficient algorithm, lattice constants and bandgaps for the γ-CsPbI3 unit cell are firstly calculated using PBE, SCAN, SHSE and HSE functionals and compared with the experimental values.40 As shown in Table 1, lattice constants by SCAN and HSE are consistent with the experimental values with an average relative error of 0.73 and 0.91%, respectively, which are more accurate than the PBE results. Meanwhile, HSE yields the closest bandgap of 1.47 eV to the reference. SHSE yields the bandgap of 1.34 eV, agreeing with the HSE results reasonably well. These consistencies are also discovered in GaN. See Table S1 (ESI†) for the GaN results. Moreover, further HSE relaxations of the ionic positions by SCAN as inputs yield the same atomic configuration as the HSE results without SCAN relaxations. Also, the computational cost of the former is reduced to 45.42% in comparison with the latter. Therefore, throughout this paper, we use HSE as an acronym for the former scheme.

Next, we performed DFE calculations of VI, VPb and VCs in γ-CsPbI3, based on SCAN, SHSE, PHSE and HSE, as shown in Fig. 2. Generally, vacancies induce larger structural deformation than antisites or substitutions.55,56 Therefore, we use these vacancies to compare the difference of DFE and defect transition levels among the aforementioned functionals or algorithms. DFE as a function of Fermi energy is defined as57 (3)where Ed(q) and Ebulk denote the energy of defective supercells at charge state q and host cells, respectively; ni, Ei and μi represent the atom number changes, atomic energy and chemical potential of element i, respectively; EF and εVBM are the Fermi energy and absolute position of the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively; Ec(q) is the correction term.
 Fig. 2  DFE calculated by the PHSE (dash line), SCAN (dot line), SHSE (dash dot line) and HSE (solid line) functionals of γ-CsPbI3 vacancies. 

Fig. 2 shows a general consistence of the defect states and transition levels between the SHSE results and HSE ones. However, pure SCAN results show 2 erroneous charge states, i.e., spurious +1 state in VPb and neutral state in VI, while the PHSE results show 3 erroneous charge states, i.e., spurious +1 state in VPb and +2 state in VI and disappearing −1 states in VPb. Moreover, Fig. 2 shows a general DFE underestimation by all the algorithms in reference to the HSE results, with SHSE showing the least average error of 229 meV compared with PHSE of 243 meV and SCAN of 387 meV, as listed in Table 1. PHSE and SCAN induce DFE errors of 498 and 821 meV in VI and VPb, respectively, which are larger than the upper limit of 289 meV in VI in the SHSE results. The error is probably due to an over-estimation of the electronic delocalized nature by the semi-local functionals. Detailed calculations of ΔE are available in Table S2 (ESI†). The similar trends of DFE and defect states are also shown in the GaN defect calculations (Fig. S1, ESI†). By the way, the comparison of ΔE is only a simplified analysis due to the rigid shift. Meanwhile, the computational cost of HSE with the SCAN results as inputs is reduced to 74.51% of the pure HSE calculations.
In general, the structural results of SCAN as an input can largely improve the convergence speed of both host and defect calculations by HSE. More importantly, SHSE shows the least average DFE underestimation and yields the same charge states of the studied defects as the HSE results, which is semi-quantitatively reliable in the defect calculations, while PHSE and SCAN exhibit larger DFE underestimation and produce wrong predictions on several charge states. However, usage of HSE relaxation is necessary for more accurate defect calculations. Therefore, throughout the paper, we perform HSE calculations.
DFE calculations in γ-CsPbI3
Based on this algorithm, we calculate the DFE of all point defects in γ-CsPbI3 by HSE, showing a different pinning state of the Fermi energy and conductivity trend from previous GGA results.24Fig. 3a illustrates DFE under the I-rich condition, suggesting that n-type conductivity is hard to realise while p-type conductivity is likely to be hindered by the deep levels. PbCs1+, VPb2− and CsPb1− collectively pin the Fermi level at 0.80 eV above VBM with DFE of 0.88 eV, which indicates a neutral or slightly p-type conductivity, different from the good p-type conductivity in the GGA results.24 The n-type defect, CsI, has a large DFE of neutral states at 4.09 eV, indicating the difficulty in n-type conductivity. Note that there are two relatively stable p-type defects, VCs and VPb, with the low DFE of neutral states at 1.48 and 1.79 eV, respectively. However, VPb shows multiple charge states and introduces deep transition levels, different from the GGA results that advocated shallow (0/2−) transition with a low DFE.24
 Fig. 3  DFE in γ-CsPbI3 calculated by the (a)–(c) HSE functional and (d)–(f) SCAN functional at the I-rich condition, I-medium condition and I-poor condition, respectively. 

Fig. 3b shows DFE at the I-medium condition, which indicates that the p-type (n-type) defect concentration is decreased (increased) with the chemical potential shifting from the I-rich to I-medium condition. PbCs1+, VPb2− and CsPb1− collectively pin the Fermi level at 1.22 eV above VBM with a DFE of 0.88 eV, which indicate the slightly n-type conductivity. The aforementioned p-type defects, VCs and VPb, have DFE of neutral states at 1.96 and 2.68 eV, respectively. VCs will contribute to the p-type conductivity, though it is restricted by the deep levels and the relatively high DFE. CsI as an n-type defect still has a high DFE of neutral states at 3.15 eV, indicating the n-type conductivity difficulties.

Fig. 3c shows the DFE at the I-poor condition, indicating that realising p-type conductivity is difficult while n-type conductivity is restrained by the deep levels and relatively high DFE. PbCs1+ and CsPb1− collectively pin the Fermi level at 1.63 eV above VBM with the DFE of 1.88 eV, which indicates a clear n-type nature, different from the marginal n-type one in the GGA results.24 The p-type defects, VCs and VPb, have a large DFE of neutral state at 2.45 and 3.58 eV, indicating the difficulty in p-type conductivity. Note that CsI can serve as a major contribution of n-type conductivity, different from resonance peaks in the GGA results.24 However, a relatively high DFE of 2.21 eV at the neutral states restricts CsI concentration, and the multi-charge states of CsI introduce deep transition levels, restraining the n-type conductivity.
Totally, the conductivity of γ-CsPbI3 can be shifted from slight p-type to n-type when adjusting the chemical potential from the I-rich to I-poor condition. This bipolar conductivity trend is different from the GGA results that show a unipolar p-type doping,24,25 but similar to organic LHP calculations.21,58
γ-CsPbI3 DFE using the SCAN functional is also calculated for comparison, which exhibits a bipolar conductivity trend similar to the HSE ones. Fig. 3d illustrates DFE at the I-rich condition, suggesting a p-type conductivity contributed by VCs and ICs. Fig. 3e illustrates DFE at the I-medium condition. The conductivity can be either p-type dominated by VCs or n-type contributed by VI, Csint and PbCs. Fig. 3f illustrates DFE at the I-poor condition, showing an n-type conductivity contributed by VI, Pbint, Csint and PbCs. Despite the accordance of conductivity, there still exist deviations in the SCAN results in comparison to the HSE ones. Details are given in Note S3 (ESI†).
Calculations of defect transition levels in γ-CsPbI3
Next we calculated the transition levels  of all point defects using the HSE functional, which are defined as (4)as shown in Fig. 4a. For VI, Csint and PbCs with low DFE, no transition states are inside the gap, which are regarded as resonance peaks. There is only one shallow n-type defect, CsI, with the (1+/0) transition levels at 0.07 eV below the conduction band minimum (CBM). However, CsI introduces detrimental (2+/1+) and (3+/2+) transition levels at 0.61 and 1.19 eV below the CBM, acting as nonradiative recombination centers. There are two p-type defects, VCs and VPb, with (0/1−) transition levels at 0.43 and 0.23 eV above the VBM, respectively. Therefore, to achieve good p-type conductivity without mid-gap traps, it is important to elevate the DFE of VCs and reduce the DFE of VPb. However, VPb further shows deep (1−/2−) transition levels at 0.51 eV above the VBM, which is detrimental. There are four bipolar defects, Ics, Ipb, Iint and CsPb, and only the DFE of Iint and CsPb are less than 2 eV and relatively stable. Iint shows deep (1+/1−) transition levels at 0.83 eV above the VBM. Such a negative-U center has also been observed in organic LHPs.43,58,59 Likewise, CsPb exhibits deep n-type (1 +/0) transition levels at 1.47 eV below the CBM and p-type (0/1−) transition levels at 0.52 eV above the VBM. However, previous GGA results regard Iint and CsPb as shallow p-type defects.24
 Fig. 4  Defect transition levels in γ-CsPbI3 calculated by the (a) HSE functional and (b) SCAN functional. 
Defect transition levels calculated by SCAN are shown in Fig. 4b. Generally, the SCAN results show the stable bipolar nature of Iint and CsPb, with the deep (1+/1−) transition levels of Iint at 0.73 eV above the VBM, and the (1+/0) and (0/1−) transition levels of CsPb at 1.71 eV below the CBM and 0.75 eV above the VBM, respectively. These results are qualitatively consistent with the HSE conclusions. However, the positions of transition levels in several defects deviate from the HSE results. Firstly, the (1+/0) transition levels of VI, Pbint, Csint and PbCs are in the bandgap, but they are above the CBM in the HSE results. Secondly, the (3+/2+) transition levels of CsI, (2+/1+) transition levels of CsPb and (1+/0) transition levels of ICs are below the VBM, but they are in the bandgap in the HSE results. Thirdly, the (3+/1+), (1+/0) and (0/1−) transition levels of PbI are totally different from the HSE results of the (3+/2+) and (2+/1+) ones. Some of the differences are probably a result of the erroneous estimation of band edges by SCAN.39 Apparently, downward shifts of the band edges in both the CBM and VBM are observed in the SCAN results compared with the HSE ones. Therefore, a rigid shift of the CBM in the SCAN results, which offsets the bandgap underestimation,60 is insufficient to correct the erroneous coupling between the band edge and defect states. This problem can be particularly severe for semiconductors with small bandgaps,61,62 because calculations performed using semi-local functionals may yield very small or zero bandgaps. Moreover, we find different defect displacements of PbI, PbCs, Pbint and CsI in the SCAN results from the HSE ones, because the SCAN results misestimate the bond orbital coupling between the defect states and the electronic environment that leads to wrong bonds and neighbors. This error further leads to transition level discrepancy of PbI, PbCs and CsI, compared with the HSE results. See Note S4 (ESI†) for details. Both the band edge problem and structural discrepancy of the defects are probably due to the incorrect correlation term of the SCAN functional that is especially severe for states with local electronic redistribution surrounding the defects. Nevertheless, the SCAN results can still provide reasonable starting points for further HSE relaxations that lead to correct configurations.
Analysis of bipolar defects
Since both the SCAN and HSE results show the detrimental bipolar nature of Iint and CsPb, we conduct structural analyses to understand the physical origin of them. Iint is stable in 2+, 1+ and 1− charge states. Iint2+ and Iint1+ couple with two nearby I atoms and form a trimer with average distances of 2.87 and 2.88 Å, respectively, which are significantly shorter than the unstable I0int of 3.33 Å. The partial charge density contour in Fig. 5a of Iint2+ and Iint1+ reveals localized σ-antibonding states with a p orbital nature that connect the trimer, indicating a relatively strong covalent bond. The formation of the trimer leads to stabilization of the mid-gap states, with the external pressure for Iint1+ supercell reduced to −0.46 kB, which is smaller than 2.07 kB of the I0int one. The reduced pressure is due to an electronic-environment-induced volume contraction from I0int to Iint1+ when the charge state changes.55 Meanwhile, Iint1− deforms the localized trimer and forms a delocalized defect-centered network, introducing extra bond orbital coupling among the inter-iodine p–p and iodine–lead s–p bonding or antibonding states, as shown in Fig. 5a. Therefore, the interesting (1+/1−) transition in Iint, that effectively suppresses the neutral state, can be understood as a combined effect by the stable local defect reconstruction of Iint1+ and extra coupling among the surrounding bond orbitals of Iint1−. By the way, according to our HSE calculations, the localized iodine trimers also exist in I0int, which can be similar to the results of β-CsPbI3.63 However, I0int is unstable as mentioned above. Therefore, the stability of the localized states should be related to the stability of different charge states.
 Fig. 5  Partial charge density contour (yellow isosurfaces) for (a) Iint, (b) ICs and (c) IPb in different charge states drawn near the band edge, respectively. Green, black and purple spheres are Cs, Pb and I atoms, respectively. The defect site and nearby iodine sites with significant charge density are marked by the red and blue circles in each panel, respectively. 
In addition, the aforementioned p–p antibonding states in Iint2+ and Iint1+ are also observed in ICs and IPb, which are different from the orbital inverted feature of γ-CsPbI3 near the VBM20,64 (Fig. S3, ESI†). ICs is stable in the 1+, 0, 1− and 2− charge states, with the local structures and partial charge density contours shown in Fig. 5b, respectively. ICs1+ and I0Cs (I1 site labeled in Fig. 5b) couple with two nearby I atoms and form a triangular trimer, with I1–I2 and I1–I3 distances of 3.17 and 3.15 Å in ICs1+, and 3.16 and 3.15 Å in I0Cs, respectively. Next, ICs1− deforms the local structure of the trimer into an iodine dimer with the I1–I2 distance of 3.37 Å, because the extra electron saturates the dangling bonds of I3. As a result, the I1–I3 distance increases to 4.35 Å. Additionally, the partial charge density contours of ICs1+, I0Cs, and ICs1− also reveal the σ-antibonding states of p orbitals among trimers and dimers. Eventually, ICs2− further deforms the dimer structure in ICs1−, with the I1–I2 and I1–I3 distances of 4.21 and 4.29 Å, respectively. The delocalized partial charge density contour of ICs2− is due to the bond orbital coupling with the valence band, similar to the condition of Iint1−. On the other hand, IPb is stable in the 1+, 0, 1− and 2− charge states, which all couple with two nearby I atoms and form an aligned trimer characterized by σ-antibonding states, with distances of 3.34, 3.35, 3.38 and 3.36 Å, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5c.
However, the cause of the multiple charge states in CsPb is different from Iint because Cs is highly metallic, transfers the electrons to the environment, and induces large deformation. As a result, the original lead–iodine bonds surrounding the defect are broken and large reconstructions among the dangling bonds from nearby iodines are observed. Specifically, the average distance between the defect site and nearby iodines is lengthened to 3.60, 3.59, 3.58 and 3.57 Å in the 2−, 1−, neutral and 1+ charge states of CsPb, respectively, which is longer than the one of 3.24 Å in the host cell (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Comparison of defect profiles between the organic and inorganic LHPs
We further compare our results with early research on CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) to understand the difference in device performance between organic and inorganic LHPs.43,58 We only adopt the calculations with the HSE functional for intrinsic defects in MAPbI3,43,58 analogous to the methodological setting in our research. With all the results listed in the two literature reports, we compare VPb, VMA/VCs, VI, Pbint, MAint/Csint, Iint, IMA/ICs and PbMA/PbCs,43,58 as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Defect transition levels of organic MAPbI3 (red lines) and inorganic γ-CsPbI3 (blue lines). Conduction band of the organic results is labeled as the grey area. Results of VI, Iint, Pbint, PbMA and IMA are adapted from Du's research43 with a bandgap of 1.51 eV. The results of VMA, VPb and MAint are adapted from Meggiolaro's research58 with a bandgap of 1.58 eV. 
We find that some defects in γ-CsPbI3, i.e., Iint, ICs, Pbint and VPb, yield more defect charge states and more deep transition levels than the organic ones. Moreover, the organic results show more negative-U centers than inorganic ones. Still, VMA, VI, PbMA and MAint in MAPbI3 have similar transitions compared with γ-CsPbI3. The charge states of all four defects are relatively simple without a multiple valence nature. The difference between the organic and inorganic results are listed as follows. (1) Iint in MAPbI3 only shows a (1+/1−) transition level at 0.57 eV above the VBM,43 however, Iint in γ-CsPbI3 shows a deeper (1+/1−) transition level at 0.83 eV above the VBM and an extra (2+/1+) transition at 1.43 eV below the CBM. (2) IMA in MAPbI3 only shows a (0/2−) transition level at 0.54 eV above the VBM,43 however, ICs in γ-CsPbI3 exhibits a bipolar nature with a (1+/0) transition at 1.62 eV below the CBM and deeper (0/1−) and (1−/2−) transitions at 0.65 and 0.73 eV above the VBM. (3) Pbint in MAPbI3 is treated as a resonance peak,43 however, Pbint in γ-CsPbI3 has an extra (2+/1+) transition at 0.80 eV below the CBM. (4) VPb in MAPbI3 only shows a (0/2−) transition with negative-U behavior at 0.49 eV above the VBM,58 however, VPb in γ-CsPbI3 shows (0/1−) and (1−/2−) transitions at 0.23 and 0.51 eV above the VBM, respectively. The complex defect profiles and extra transition levels possibly originate from the strengthened bond orbital coupling due to relatively small lattice constants in γ-CsPbI3.
Conclusion
In summary, the SCAN structures as inputs can improve the convergence speed of HSE, while the SHSE is qualitatively reliable in defect calculations. Nevertheless, SCAN still causes deviations from the HSE results. The intrinsic defects in γ-CsPbI3 show a bipolar conductivity, restricted by deep levels and high DFE of the major carrier providers. Moreover, the enhanced bond orbital coupling and structural morphing result in the detrimental bipolar defects, which can cause detrimental defect complexity in γ-CsPbI3 compared with the organic ones. Based on our calculations, several possible directions for further enhancement of device efficiency can be proposed. Stable extrinsic dopants of p-type and n-type can be essential to increase the carrier concentration. Meanwhile, to reduce the deep states, it could be important to passivate stable bipolar defects Iint and CsPb by intrinsic or extrinsic co-doping strategies.
