The thermal properties of the ionic liquid are also investigated. When LiI or MgI2 is introduced into the ionic liquid at the same concentration of the metal cations, the particular trapping ability of the crown ether to metal cations could effectively reduce the electrostatic interaction between the metal cations and iodide anions to release more iodide anions. Electrochemical impedance analysis reveals that ∼35 fold of ionic conductivity enhancement for the multi-iodine doped ionic liquids can be obviously observed at room temperature. For applications, these multi-iodine doped crown ether functionalized ionic liquids can be used as gel electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells, displaying a power conversion efficiency of 3.86% at a simulated AM1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−1. These preliminary results provide us with a feasible strategy to enhance the ionic conductivity and explore new ionic liquid electrolytes for energy storage and conversion devices.
1. Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) are composed of organic cations and organic or inorganic anions.1 Having non-volatility with a melting temperature below 100 °C, also known as liquid organic, molten or fused salts, they have attracted intensive scientific interest and even become a “star” material in material research. Due to their excellent ability to dissolve an enormous range of organic and inorganic materials,2 high chemical and thermal stability,3 ILs have emerged as an attractive “green” alternative to traditional organic solvents in various fields of chemistry: synthesis,4 catalysis,3,5 lubrication,6 and separation processes,7 etc. Most importantly, in virtue of some unique and favorable properties including low flammability, wide electrochemical window and high ionic conductivity,8 ILs are playing an irreplaceable role in utilizing as highly efficient and stable electrolytes for electrochemical and renewable energy applications,9 such as lithium batteries,10 fuel cells11 and dye-sensitized solar cells.12
When using ILs as functional electrolytes for high performance devices, several strategies have been proposed to successfully improve their conductivity.13,14 It is well-known that adding iodine (I2) to ILs with I− anions could form polyiodide chains such as I3−, I5−, I7−,…, I2n+1−, which promote fast exchange reaction via a Grotthuss exchange mechanism,15–17 resulting in obvious conductivity enhancement. In addition, introducing certain SiO2/TiO2 nanoparticles can greatly enhance the ionic conductivity of employed electrolytes by breaking up ion pairs and/or forming more number of defects at the interfaces.18–21 In virtue of outstanding electronic transport ability, carbon nanotubes and graphene are also employed into ILs electrolytes to improve their conductivity.22–25 Recently, by reducing the lamellar structures of a novel ionic conductor with propargyl groups,26 Wang and coworkers find that it is much more beneficial to fast charge transport along the polyiodide chain. Owing to the high conductivity, the solid-state ionic conductor can be used as single-component solid electrolytes for high performance solid-state DSSCs. Thus, these previous research triggers our interest to explore new types of high conductive ILs.
Here, a kind of crown ether functionalized ionic liquid is designed and prepared by combining crown ether with imidazolium structure. The molecular structure and thermal property have been confirmed and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, respectively. Moreover, the influence of metal iodides on the ionic conductivity of resulting multi-iodine doped crown ether functionalized ionic liquids is also investigated in details by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Notably, the particular trapping ability of crown ether to metal cations could effectively reduce the electrostatic interaction between metal cations and iodide anions to release more iodide anions, which hence facilitates enhanced ionic conductivity of the multi-iodine doped ionic liquids. For applications, the resulting ionic liquids are further utilized as gel electrolytes to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

After reaction, the precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to gain raw product. The pure product was received by chromatographic separation on neutral alumina using acetone/DCM/CH3OH (200:450:1, v/v/v) as eluent. The chemical structure was further confirmed by 1HNMR (d6-DMSO, 400 MHz): 7.60 (s, 1H), 7.14 (s, 1H), 6.87 (s, 1H), 4.02–4.06 (t, 1H), 3.40–3.50 (m, 1H), 3.92–3.98 (m, 3H), 3.74–3.79 (m, 1H), 3.62–3.68 (m, 4H), 3.60 (s, 1H), 3.47–3.58 (m, 15H), 3.40–3.46 (m, 2H), 2.32–2.36 (t, 2H), 1.68–1.74 (m, 2H), 1.41–1.48 (m, 2H).

The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and then overnight at 50 °C. After evaporation of the solvent, the crude product was washed with ethyl acetate and diethyl ether three times, respectively, and dried under vacuum for 24 h to provide 8.17 g [12-C-4][Im][I] (yield: 83.5%, viscous milky white gel). The chemical structure was further confirmed by 1HNMR (d6-DMSO, 400 MHz): 9.16 (s, 1H), 7.78 (t, 1H), 7.72 (t, 1H), 4.16–4.22 (t, 2H), 4.04–4.08 (t, 1H), 3.93–3.97 (t, 1H), 3.85 (s, 3H), 3.75–3.80 (m, 1H), 3.47–3.68 (m, 15H), 3.40–3.46 (m, 2H), 3.40–3.46 (m, 2H), 2.35–2.40 (t, 2H), 1.76–1.84 (m, 2H), 1.46–1.52 (m, 2H).
Preparation of multi-iodine doped crown ether functionalized ionic liquids electrolytes
[12-C-4][Im][I], LiI doped [12-C-4][Im][I] and MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I] are selected to prepare three multi-iodine doped ionic liquids Electrolytes I, II and III for DSSCs (Devices A-C). For further optimization, I2 is added to form the I3− ions to enhance the ionic conductivity for the electron relay at the counter electrode. Thus, addition of 10 wt% iodine to Electrolyte III can form Electrolyte IV for the fabrication of Device D. The easy synthesis process is depicted as follows: [12-C-4][Im][I] (0.5 g) was mixed with equiv. of LiI (Electrolyte I) or MgI2 (Electrolyte II) and stirred at 40 °C for 5 h. Then, the mixtures were moved to dry in vacuum oven overnight before the characterization and fabrication of the DSSCs.
Device fabrication
The fabrication of DSSCs is present as follows. The FTO glass was cleaned by acetone and ethanol successively. Cleaned FTO glass was immersed into 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and washed with water and ethanol. Firstly, a 10 μm-thick film of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was coated onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique and then dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Secondly, a 5 μm-thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering TiO2 particles was deposited on the first TiO2 layer. The two layers of TiO2 particles were used as photoanode. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min and gradually cooled to 90 °C. Then, the TiO2 electrode was soaked in the Z907 solution (0.5 mM) in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) for 24 h. Afterward, the dyed TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a N2 stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, one drop of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol was dipped onto the cleaned FTO substrate, followed by dried and annealed at 400 °C for 15 min. DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the heated gel electrolytes between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a platinized counter electrode. The electrodes and Pt conducting glass were separated by using a 25 μm thick Surlyn hot-melt ring (DuPont) and sealed up by heating. The gel electrolytes were injected into sandwiched cells by a vacuum back filling system. The hole for electrolyte injection on the Pt counter electrode was finally sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass by heating.
Characterization and measurement
1HNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the synthesized compounds were recorded on a Varian CP-3800 spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The viscosity measurement was carried out on viscometer (Haake® Rheo Stress 6000, Germany). Thermal analysis was carried out on Universal Analysis 2000 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Sample was heated from 50 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was performed under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of −50 to 250 °C on DSC-Q200. The conductivity of the electrolytes was characterized in an ordinary cell composed of Teflon tube and two identical stainless steel electrodes (diameter of 1 cm) on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation, using the AC impedance method over the frequency range 0.1 to 105 Hz and the amplitude is 10 mV. The conductivity can be calculated by the following equation:25 
σ = l/(RS)
(1)where σ is the conductivity in S cm−1, R is the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, l is the distance between two electrodes, and S is the active area of the electrodes. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an Al foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.25 cm−2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The photoelectrochemical parameters, such as fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated according to the previous reports.13–16
3. Results and discussion
Scheme 1 illustrates the general procedures to synthesize the ionic liquid [12-C-4][Im][I]. The synthesis processes are feasible and easy to operate. The high purity and exact chemical structure of the resultant products are also confirmed by 1HNMR (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The FTIR spectra of [12-C-4][OH], [12-C-4][Br], [12-C-4][Im] and [12-C-4][Im][I] between 400 and 4000 cm−1 at room temperature are further presented in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1a, the broad band around 3385 cm−1 is usually assigned to the O–H bond, which is not observed in Fig. 1b. Peaks between 2800 and 3000 cm−1 are ascribed to –CH3 and –CH2 stretching vibration.26 Peaks lower 1000 cm−1 are due to bending vibration of C–H. In Fig. 1b, characteristic absorption bands of ester group at 1736 cm−1 derives its formation. A peak at 559 cm−1 is also found for C–Br bond. There are two intensive peaks at 1454 cm−1 and 1508 cm−1 for CC and CN, and a peak at 3109 cm−1 for C–N appearing in Fig. 1c. Moreover, in Fig. 1c and d, obvious broad band with the maximum at 3420 cm−1 arises from the N–H stretching vibrations,27 which confirms the existence of imidazole circle. When CH3I is introduced in Fig. 1d, the interaction of imidazole circle weakens, thus the intensity of peak at 1454 cm−1 and 1508 cm−1 decreases. From the above discussion, it can be confirmed that the novel crown ether functionalized ionic liquid has been synthesized successfully.

Typical 3D molecular structures and photographs of the products are further shown in Fig. 2.

Moreover, after introducing metal iodides to [12-C-4][Im][I], the viscosity value of LiI doped [12-C-4][Im][I] (d) increase up to 8345 cP with slight color change. Interestingly, combing MgI2 with [12-C-4][Im][I] (e) leads to obvious color change from milky white to orange. Actually, the viscosity value of MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I] is 9720 cP. Therefore, the electrostatic interaction between crown ether and metal cations could enhance the van der Waals forces28 of metal iodides doped ionic liquids, leading to higher viscosity value.

The effect of LiI and MgI2 on the thermal property of ionic liquids [12-C-4][Im][I], LiI doped [12-C-4][Im][I] and MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I] are also studied by TGA curves. As shown in Fig. 3a, typical TGA curves depicts the decomposition processes of three ionic liquids. It can be noted that the decomposition of [12-C-4][Im][I] (black line) is one-step process starting at ∼266 °C. When introducing LiI, the decomposition temperature lowers to ∼243 °C (red line). The main weight loss corresponds to the whole decomposition of LiI doped [12-C-4][Im][I], probably because of the inducing effect29 of Li cations to the crown ring of [12-C-4][Im][I]. In addition, when MgI2 is employed, there are more decomposition processes and the initial decomposition temperature greatly lowers to ∼150 °C. The decomposition at lower temperature represents more obvious inducing effect of divalent cation Mg2+ to the crown ring of [12-C-4][Im][I]. However, it is clearly found that all the three ionic liquids display good thermal stability upon 150 °C. Therefore, it is still well acceptable for a wide range of electrolyte applications.30

In order to further investigate the thermal property of [12-C-4][Im][I], LiI doped [12-C-4][Im][I] and MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I], DSC curves are also tested, as shown in Fig. 3b. For [12-C-4][Im][I], there is a glass transition temperature at −5.2 °C. When LiI or MgI2 is added, no obvious melting point can be found, indicating the state is still a gel for LiI or MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I]. In addition, for LiI doped [12-C-4][Im][I], the glass transition temperature disappears. It also demonstrates the strong inducing effect between monovalent Li+ cations and crown ether rings. Furthermore, for MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I], an endothermic peak with slight decomposition appears when the temperature is higher than 120 °C, which indicates more strong inducting effect between divalent Mg2+ to crown ether rings. These DSC analysis is also in accordance with the previous results of TGA curves.
To gain more insight into the influence of metal iodide with different valence state on the ionic conductivity of the ionic liquids at room temperature, [12-C-4][Im][I], LiI and MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I] are employed to form Electrolytes I–III. The electrochemical impedance spectra are further carried out to investigate the charge transfer ability.16,22,23 As shown in Fig. 4, a typical impedance curve is composed of two depressed semicircles.31 The first semicircle in high-frequency region represents charge transfer resistance between the Pt electrode and the electrolyte. While, the second semicircle in intermediate-frequency region indicates the resistance of Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte. It can be seen that adding LiI to [12-C-4][I] to form Electrolyte II can obviously decrease the resistance value of Electrolyte I. Additionally, when MgI2 are introduced into [12-C-4][I], formed Electrolyte III displays much smaller resistance value than Electrolyte II. From the enlarged drawing, the diminution can be clearly found. Therefore, for Electrolyte I–III, the ionic conductivities are 1.04 × 10−7, 3.73 × 10−7 and 3.67 × 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. Therefore, for Electrolytes I–III, ∼35 folds of ionic conductivity enhancement can be obviously observed at room temperature. It is well known that the cavity radius of 12-crown-4 is between 0.060 and 0.075 nm, while the ionic radius of Li+ and Mg2+ are 0.060 and 0.065 nm.31,32 The particular trapping and dissociating ability of crown ether rings to metal cations (Li+ and Mg2+) could effectively reduce the electrostatic interaction between metal cations and iodide anions to release more iodide anions,33 which should be responsible for the enhanced ionic conductivity of the multi-iodine doped electrolytes. The multi-iodine doped strategy to enhance the ionic conductivity of ionic liquids triggers our interest in further investigating the temperature effect on the ionic conductivity.

The ionic conductivity of ILs is an important parameter related to their potential applications in electrochemical devices. The ionic conductivity of the medium involves the number of the carrier ions as well as the degree of correlation in ionic motion. To better understand the relationship of the AC impedance with temperatures, EIS spectra and ionic conductivity are studied as shown in Fig. 5a–c. It is obvious that higher temperature will lead to lower impedance values for all the three Electrolytes I–III. According to previous thermal measurements, each electrolyte performs a liquid/gel state at high temperature and the viscosity of them decreases greatly, resulting in obvious increase in ionic mobility. Consequently, the ionic conductivity enhances obviously, as shown in Fig. 5d. Therefore, the ionic conductivity is 6.49 × 10−6, 3.88 × 10−5 and 2.12 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 85 °C, which are much higher than their corresponding values at room temperature, displaying a potential application as novel ionic liquids electrolytes. Besides, the ionic conductivity presents a relatively linear dependence on the temperature, indicating typical Arrhenius behavior.19 The thermally activated process can be expressed as: 
σ = σoexp(−Ea/κT)
(2)where σo represents the pre-exponential factor, Ea represents the activation energy, κ represents the Boltzmann constant and T represents the temperature in Kelvin.34 The calculated Ea values of Electrolytes I–III are 39.84 kJ mol−1, 36.67 kJ mol−1 and 31.01 kJ mol−1, respectively. It is clearly found that the activation energy of Electrolyte II or Electrolyte III reduces when LiI or MgI2 is added into [12-C-4][Im][I] (Electrolyte I). Briefly, it can be concluded that the decrease in the activation energy is mainly due to the multi-iodine doping of I−, thus leading to more favorable ionic transport in the electrolyte system.

As one of most important components in DSSCs, the electrolyte is responsible for the inner charge carrier transport between photoanodes and counter electrodes, and continuously regenerates the dye and itself during the device operation.13,14 Taking the above analysis into account, [12-C-4][Im][I], LiI doped [12-C-4][Im][I], MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I], and MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I] with 10 wt% I2 are chosen as four Electrolytes I–IV for the fabrication of DSSCs (Devices A–D). The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6, and the performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that Device A with [12-C-4][Im][I] only exhibits a low PCE of 0.3%. Moreover, adding LiI into [12-C-4][Im][I], higher PCE for Devices B with Electrolyte II is observed to be 1.23%, which is consistent with the conductivity results in Fig. 4 and 5. Furthermore, higher ionic conductivity for Electrolyte III with MgI2 doped [12-C-4][Im][I] can lead to higher PCE ∼2.09% for Device C. In virtue of the function of I2 to form I3− to greatly enhance the ionic conductivity for more effective dye regeneration and electron relay, I2 is applied to further improve the PCE of Device D. As shown in Table 1, a much higher PCE of 3.86% can be achieved, corresponding to a Jsc of 8.75 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.61 V and a FF of 0.724. Unfortunately, high viscosity values of Electrolytes I–IV from 6850 to 10030 cP, greatly restrain the mass transport of ion species and lead to relatively low ionic conductivity, which should be responsible for the photovoltaic performance.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel crown ether functionalized ionic liquid has been successfully designed, synthesized and characterized. The influence of metal iodine and temperature on the thermal properties and ionic conductivities is also investigated in details. Compared with the ionic liquid [12-C-4][Im][I] without any metal iodine, introducing LiI or MgI2 can greatly enhance the ionic conductivity of multi-iodine doped ionic liquids. Using these ionic liquids as gel electrolytes, the resulting DSSCs displays a power conversion efficiency of 3.86%. There is still large space to improve the electrochemical property of these ionic liquids electrolytes by employing other metal cations with higher valents (e.g. AlI3 and SnI4), which can facilitate more free iodide anions for better ionic conductivity at the same concentration of metal cations. In addition, the viscosity of crown ether functionalized ionic liquids can be obviously reduced by exchanging the counteranions of imidazolium structure to be other anions such as BF4− and TFSI−, etc. However, these preliminary results provide us a feasible method to develop higher conductive ionic liquids electrolytes for energy conversion devices. More research is still under way in our laboratory.
