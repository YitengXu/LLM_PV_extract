In particular, when 2D nanomaterials are combined with soft polymeric components, the resulting photoelectronic devices are potentially scalable and mechanically flexible, allowing the development of a variety of prototype soft-electronic devices, such as solar cells, displays, photodetectors, and non-volatile memory devices. Diverse polymer/2D heterostructures are frequently employed, but the performance of the devices with heterostructures is limited, mainly because of the difficulty in controlling the molecular structures of the polymers on the 2D surface. Thus, understanding the crystal interactions of polymers on atomically flat and dangling-bond-free surfaces of 2D materials is essential for ensuring high performance. In this study, the recent progress made in the development of thin polymer films fabricated on the surfaces of various 2D nanomaterials for high-performance photoelectronic devices is comprehensively reviewed, with an emphasis on the control of the molecular and crystalline structures of the polymers on the 2D surface.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, including graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), have attracted considerable attention because of their intriguing photoelectronic properties associated with their unique two-dimensionally confined chemical structures, which make them viable for various emerging applications in electronics, optics, and energy conversion and storage.1–5 To fully utilize the properties of these nanomaterials—that make them suitable for various wearable and patchable electronic applications—for mechanically flexible scalable electronics, both low-molecular-weight organics and macromolecular polymers have been employed largely based on a variety of solution processes, including spin-, dip-, and spray-coating.6–9 These organic and polymeric materials/2D heterostructures have been demonstrated to be a high-performance soft-electronic platform, giving rise to numerous photoelectronic prototype devices, including field-effect transistors (FETs),10–12 photodetectors,13–17 phototransistors,18–20 solar cells,21 non-volatile memory devices,22–28 and sensors.29–32 In spite of the great potential of low-molecular weight organics/2D heterostructures, they are still limited with regard to scalability and—more importantly—guaranteeing mechanical flexibility.
Macromolecular polymers/2D heterostructures, which typically include photoelectronic polymers with semi-crystalline characteristics such as those of dielectrics and semiconductors, are also promising owing to their advantages of a cost-efficient solution process and optical transparency and mechanical flexibility properties over a large area. Although these advantages make polymer films suitable for flexible/wearable electronic applications, the films have poor photoelectronic properties, mainly owing to the difficulty in controlling the unique hierarchical semi-crystalline structures of the polymers resulting from the characteristic chain folding, followed by the resulting crystalline lamellae and their complex assembly. Significant progress has recently been made in crystal engineering for molecularly ordered large-area polymer films on extremely well-defined, dangling-bond-free, atomically flat surfaces of various 2D nanomaterials33–37 (Fig. 1). Although several studies have enhanced our understanding of small organics/2D material interfaces,8,9,38–40 a comprehensive overview has rarely been performed on the molecular and crystal engineering of polymers on 2D materials, including the crystalline structure and preferred orientation and morphology for high-performance photoelectronic applications. The present review addresses how the molecular and crystalline orientations of the polymers affect their photoelectronic properties—particularly on the surfaces of diverse 2D materials—and furthermore, how the orientations can be controlled for improving the performance.

The review begins by discussing thin solution-processed polymer films on 2D materials suitable for various photoelectronic devices. To provide a clearer understanding of polymer/2D heterostructures with well-defined, uniform van der Waals interfaces, the section focuses on the development of various polymer films on both mechanically exfoliated and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown 2D nanomaterials with a precisely controlled layer thickness and an intact exposed surface. Numerous examples of polymer/liquid-phase exfoliated 2D flake heterostructures are excluded, in which the surfaces of 2D flakes are often modified with diverse chemical dispersants and/or photo-treatments such as plasma and ultraviolet (UV) treatments; these treatments alter the interaction of 2D materials with polymers.41–45 The following sections present a brief discussion of the recent development of polymer epitaxy on various conventional crystalline surfaces, which is one of the most efficient and powerful techniques for controlling the molecular and crystalline structures of semi-crystalline polymers. The last section describes the state of the art of employing polymer epitaxy on 2D nanomaterials, which is one of the most promising approaches for realizing high-performance flexible and scalable electronic devices with polymer/2D heterostructures.
Polymers on 2D materials for photoelectronics
Insulating polymers/2D heterostructures for photoelectronics
The representative electroactive insulating polymers are polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its copolymers with various fluorinated and/or chlorinated monomers. Dipole moments in the polymers arise from the large electronegativity difference between H and F and/or Cl atoms perpendicular to the polymer C backbone, making them piezoelectric, pyroelectric, or ferroelectric, depending on the processing conditions and the compositions of the copolymers.46,47 Various photoelectronic devices have been demonstrated with PVDF-based polymers/2D heterostructures, including non-volatile ferroelectric memory devices, photodetectors, negative-capacitance FETs, and piezoelectric sensors, as shown in Table 1.

Sun et al. demonstrated a non-volatile ferroelectric FET (FeFET) memory device with a graphene channel having a PVDF-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) gate insulator (Fig. 2a).28 The characteristic current hysteresis arose from the ferroelectric dipole switching of the PVDF-TrFE gate insulator, but a relatively low on/off ratio of 1.07 was inevitable owing to the small bandgap of graphene (Fig. 2b). TMD and black phosphorus (BP) were used as the channel layers in FeFETs, leading to a significantly enhanced on/off ratio. When mechanically exfoliated monolayer MoSe2 was employed, the device exhibited an on/off ratio of >105 with excellent retention (1000 s) and cycle endurance (10000 cycles) (Fig. 2c and d).24 Im et al. demonstrated a non-volatile ferroelectric memory circuit with a BP channel layer.26 The BP channel FeFET exhibited a maximum linear mobility of 1159 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off current ratio of >103, and reliable retention of >1000 s. Furthermore, the BP channel FeFET was integrated with an MoS2 channel FeFET to build a ferroelectric complementary metal–oxide semiconductor. These memory inverter circuits exhibited a memory window of 15 V and an output-voltage efficiency of 95%. FeFET devices that employed mechanically exfoliated graphene as source/drain electrodes exhibited a maximum linear mobility of 175 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off current ratio of >107 (Fig. 2e and f).25 The graphene electrode exhibited improved ohmic contact behaviours with a MoS2 channel, compared with the conventional Ti/Au electrode.

Ferroelectric polymers employed in phototransistors allowed the dark current of 2D channel layers to be substantially reduced, resulting in significant enhancements in the sensitivity and photoresponsivity. The non-volatile dipoles in PVDF-TrFE efficiently depleted the charge carriers in the 2D channel layer, reducing the dark current by orders of magnitude. Wang et al. reported that phototransistors with PVDF-TrFE/mechanically exfoliated few-layer MoS2 heterostructures exhibited a broad-range photo-response (0.5–1.5 μm) with long-term stability of reliable operation during 90000 cycles and a high responsivity and detectivity of 2570 A W−1 and 2.2 × 1012 Jones, respectively (Fig. 3a).17 When the dipoles in PVDF-TrFE poled upward, it depleted the charge carriers in MoS2, as shown in Fig. 3b. As a result, the depleted channel had a higher photo-response (Fig. 3c). In this sense, the MoTe2/PVDF-TrFE heterostructure demonstrated a broad-range photo-response (0.6–1.5 μm) with a responsivity and detectivity of 16.4 mA W−1 and 1.94 × 108 Jones, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3d–f.

The mobilities of a TMD extracted from a field effect transistor are much lower than its intrinsic carrier mobility (∼500 cm2 V−1 s−1).48–50 Moreover, piezoelectric PVDF-based polymer/2D heterostructures were successfully applied to flexible piezoelectric pressure sensors and touch panels. A pressure sensor with a PVDF-TrFE/graphene heterostructure exhibited a sensitivity of 0.76 kPa−1 and a gauge factor of 445.31 The schematic illustrations in Fig. 3g and h show the operation mechanism of a piezoresistive sensor with a PVDF-TrFE/graphene heterostructure and real-time dynamics are shown in Fig. 3i. Graphene/PVDF/graphene capacitors were also used in flexible touch screens for x-, y-, and z-direction sensing.32 Since polymer/2D material heterostructures are based on the van der Waals interaction of the two materials, photoelectronic properties are modulated by a variety of environmental engineering. The electrostatic doping by the internal electric field, doping by a polymer layer, and charge transfer between the polymer and 2D materials can stimulate the new phenomena, allowing novel photoelectronic applications.51 Details regarding PVDF-based polymers/2D heterostructures are presented in Table 1.
Semiconducting polymers/2D heterostructures for photoelectronics
Various semi-crystalline semiconducting polymer/2D heterostructures have been successfully employed, not only for investigating the photophysical properties at heterostructure interfaces, but also for developing high-performance photoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors, phototransistors, and solar cells, as shown in Table 2. Petoukhoff et al. investigated the photoexcited charge-transfer dynamics in conjugated semiconducting polymers/n-type MoS2 interfaces.52 The study revealed that the photoluminescence was significantly enhanced in a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/MoS2 heterostructure, compared with that in a P3HT single layer. Shastry et al. fabricated a large-area poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7)/MoS2 heterostructure and examined its photovoltaic properties (Fig. 4a–c).21 The efficient charge transfer in the heterostructure was confirmed by mutual photoluminescence quenching, depending on the thickness of the PTB7 layer (Fig. 4a). When the heterostructure was thinner than 20 nm, the PTB7/MoS2 photovoltaic heterostructure provided a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) exceeding 20% and 40%, respectively. A transient-absorption-spectroscopy study on a PTB7/MoS2 heterostructure revealed that the interface of the p- and n-type polymer semiconductor blend/MoS2 heterostructure was suitable for ultrafast charge transfer.53 When a plasmonic meta-surface was applied to the heterostructure, the absorption and charge photogeneration were significantly enhanced at the blend/MoS2 interface.

Additionally, polymer semiconductor/2D heterostructures were utilized in the phototransistors, to achieve high sensitivity and responsivity. When the graphene layer was in contact with P3HT18,20 and PTB7,19 the photogenerated excitons were separated from each other, and holes were transferred into graphene, leading to alteration of the conductivity while the electrons remained trapped in the semiconductor polymer. In a PTB7/graphene photodetector, octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS)-treated substrates were used to suppress the charge trapping at the graphene/SiO2 interface (Fig. 4d).19 The photo-generated excitons in PTB7 were separated by the internal electric field and the holes transferred into graphene changing its conductivity (Fig. 4e). Consequently, a maximum responsivity of 1.8 × 105 A W−1 was achieved at a low optical intensity of 133 nW cm−2 (Fig. 4f). The control of the morphology of a P3HT/graphene heterostructure photodetector for enhancing the photoresponsivity was investigated (Fig. 4g–i).20 The dirac point of the graphene–P3HT hybrid FET was shifted to positive voltage under white light illumination because photogenerated holes transferred from P3HT to the graphene layer (Fig. 4h). In the optimized controlled P3HT morphology, the photodetector showed a photoresponsivity of 6000 A W−1 (Fig. 4i).
Epitaxially grown crystalline polymers on conventional substrates
Recent progress in epitaxial growth of a ferroelectric polymer
For controlling the molecular structures and microstructures of polymer crystals by employing external stimuli such as mechanical forces54,55 and electric and magnetic fields,56 the epitaxy of a thin crystalline polymer on a substrate based on crystal-to-crystal lattice matching of two interfacing materials is most suitable for polymer/2D heterostructures involving ferroelectric and semiconducting polymers. The ferroelectric properties of PVDF-TrFE significantly depend on the crystal structure, degree of crystallinity, and crystal orientation. For instance, while an as-cast thin PVDF-TrFE film prepared via spin-coating exhibited polymer crystals randomly distributed on the substrate (Fig. 5a), the crystal alignment was significantly improved by the epitaxial growth of the PVDF-TrFE layer on a highly oriented poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) substrate (Fig. 5b).57 We revealed that the epitaxy of PVDF-TrFE on PTFE occurred with the b-axis of PVDF-TrFE matching the a-axis of PTFE.58,59 Zhu et al. also investigated the epitaxy of a thin PVDF-TrFE film on PTFE and found that the degree of crystallinity was enhanced upon epitaxy with a high thermal stability (Fig. 5c and d).57 Despite the successful fabrication of ferroelectric capacitors with epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE on PTFE, the device performance was not significantly improved, mainly owing to the presence of a low-dielectric-constant (≈2.5) PTFE layer, which indicates the importance of the photoelectronic properties of an epitaxial substrate for high-performance devices.

To ensure full utilization of epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE crystals for photoelectronic devices, a novel strategy was proposed, whereby a substrate used for epitaxy was removed after the epitaxy of PVDF-TrFE.60–62 For instance, physical vapor deposition (PVD) was employed to develop single-crystalline rubrene on which PVDF-TrFE was epitaxially crystallized, as shown in Fig. 6a and b.60 The PVDF-TrFE lamellae was ±45°-aligned to the b-axis of the rubrene single crystal because of the crystallographic matching of the chain-axis of PVDF-TrFE with the (210) and (20) planes of orthorhombic rubrene crystals. The polarization–electric field (P–E) characteristics of the epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE were investigated after the removal of the rubrene substrate using chloroform. The ordered edge-on lamellae crystals, whose b-axis was readily aligned with the electric field, led to a higher remnant polarization and lower coercive voltage in a capacitor with the epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE, as shown in Fig. 6c. Notably, the epitaxial crystallization was further controlled by the cooling rate of a thin film from the molten state. As the cooling rate decreased, highly ordered one-directional edge-on lamellae 50 μm in length were observed when the cooling rate was as low as 0.1 °C min−1 (Fig. 6b).

Xia et al. introduced a removable PTFE template for improving the device performance with epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE (Fig. 6d).61,62 When the PTFE layer was transferred onto the top of the pre-deposited PVDF-TrFE, followed by thermal annealing under pressure, highly aligned epitaxial PVDF-TrFE crystals were developed. After PVDF-TrFE epitaxy, the PTFE layer was simply peeled off, allowing for the fabrication of a ferroelectric capacitor with the epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE. The capacitor exhibited an improved remnant polarization of approximately 10.4 μC cm−2 in the epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE. The epitaxy of PVDF-TrFE on PTFE was also conducted using PVDF-TrFE blended with a p-type semiconductor (poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(bithiophene)]) (F8T2) suitable for non-volatile resistive memory.62 A removable PTFE template was also used for the epitaxy of blended F8T2/PVDF-TrFE (Fig. 6e and f). The characteristic needle-like PVDF-TrFE crystals were globally aligned with randomly distributed semiconducting domains (Fig. 6f). With the epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE crystals exhibiting enhanced crystallinity and a low leakage current, the resistive memory was operated at a low voltage with a high ON/OFF resistance ratio (Fig. 6g).
Epitaxially grown semiconducting polymers for high-performance photoelectronics
The molecular and microstructures of semi-crystalline semiconducting polymers were successfully controlled via epitaxy, for high-performance photoelectronic applications, as shown in Table 3. Various crystalline substrates suitable for semiconducting polymer epitaxy have been developed, including polyethylene (PE),63,64 isotactic polypropylene (iPP),65 and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB).66–71 For example, a highly oriented P3HT crystal structure was obtained with TCB. TCB powder was deposited on an as-cast P3HT film and subsequently covered with a cover glass. Thermal annealing at a temperature gradient caused the TCB to directionally crystallize along the gradient, allowing for the epitaxial crystallization of P3HT, as shown in Fig. 7a. While a controlled P3HT film exhibited small randomly oriented crystal grains approximately 20 nm in size, uniaxially grown P3HT crystals were observed in P3HT crystallized with TCB, as shown in Fig. 7b and c.66 Consequently, a high electrical conductivity (approximately 251 S cm−1, i.e., more than three times higher than that without epitaxy) was observed in epitaxially grown P3HT with TCB (Fig. 7d). A diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated polymer, PDTDPPQT, was also epitaxially grown on TCB, leading to an enhanced carrier mobility in an FET (Fig. 7e and f).70 A bottom-gate top-contact transistor on an SiO2/Si substrate with an epitaxially grown PDTDPPQT channel layer exhibited anisotropic carrier mobility depending on whether the crystalline lamellae were parallel or perpendicular to the carrier-transport direction. A hole mobility of approximately 7.12 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved in the parallel direction, and a mobility of 2.89 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained in the perpendicular direction (Fig. 7g). The study achieved a high mobility of approximately 12.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 (comparable to that of a large-area CVD-grown MoS2 layer72), which suggests the usefulness of polymer epitaxy, particularly for polymer/2D heterostructures with an atomically flat 2D crystalline surface.

Epitaxially grown polymer/2D heterostructures
Epitaxy of polymer on the surfaces of 2D materials has only been demonstrated in a few cases, despite its great potential in high-performance photoelectronic applications. It was due to difficulty in forming an epitaxially grown high-quality polymer layer on 2D materials. As the epitaxy of the polymer layer is based on crystal-to-crystal lattice matching between two interfacing materials, it is one of the most critical issues to choose a crystalline polymer whose crystal lattices are well matched with those of a targeting 2D crystal. Since most of the 2D materials discussed such as graphene, TMD, and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have similar lattice constants, the choice of the appropriate crystalline polymers is limited. In addition, chemical vapor deposition often results in crystalline grains randomly distributed with grain boundaries which may lead to frustration of polymer crystals in order. As discussed previously, epitaxially grown polymers do not always guarantee improved device performance, particularly when the substrates used for the epitaxy do not act as components of the devices; this necessitates an additional process for removing the substrates upon device fabrication. Considering that most 2D materials are photoelectronically active as various components, such as electrodes, semiconducting channels, photo-absorbing layers, and gate insulators, their surfaces are among the most suitable substrates for polymer epitaxy, offering a novel route for controlling polymer crystals at polymer/2D heterointerfaces.
Ferroelectric polymers were epitaxially crystallized on various 2D surfaces, leading to novel polymer/2D heterostructures suitable for high-performance photoelectronic devices. Graphene with a unique hexagonal crystalline lattice structure was adopted as an electrode as well as an epitaxial substrate for PVDF-TrFE for high-performance non-volatile memory devices.33 When a thin PVDF-TrFE film was deposited onto an exfoliated graphene flake, followed by melting and recrystallization at room temperature, ordered PVDF-TrFE crystalline lamellae with a unique three-fold symmetry were obtained, as shown in Fig. 8a. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the chain-axis of PVDF-TrFE was aligned with the graphene's centre-to-centre lattice (Fig. 8b). For fabricating non-volatile capacitor memory with an ordered PVDF-TrFE film on graphene, large-area CVD-graphene was transferred onto a Si substrate, followed by the deposition of PVDF-TrFE. The film was subsequently annealed at 200 °C for a few minutes and recrystallized at room temperature, leading to an epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE film on a graphene bottom electrode. By depositing a top Al electrode on the PVDF-TrFE/graphene heterostructure, non-volatile capacitor memory was developed. The device exhibited a remnant polarization and coercive voltage of 6.77 μC cm−2 and 73.16 MV m−1, respectively (superior to the performance of a controlled capacitor prepared without epitaxy).

A semiconducting polymer/graphene heterostructure was also demonstrated with a controlled crystalline structure of the polymer, leading to enhanced vertical charge transport in a two-terminal diode.34,35 A diode with a thin P3HT film on a CVD-graphene electrode exhibited significantly improved vertical charge transport compared with the device on a Si electrode (Fig. 8d). In this study, both edge-on and face-on P3HT crystals were developed on graphene (Fig. 8e), whereas only edge-on crystals were developed on a Si substrate (Fig. 8f). The improved vertical transport was due to the multiple continuous charge-transport pathways resulting from the mixture of edge-on and face-on lamellae. The edge-on and face-on crystal orientations of P3HT on Si and graphene layers were investigated, respectively, by 2D grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD), as shown in Fig. 8g–i. Although the detailed epitaxial interaction between P3HT and graphene was not fully revealed, the study indicated that the unique crystal structure arose from the strong pi–pi interactions between P3HT and graphene.
An epitaxially grown PVDF-TrFE film was achieved over a large area on CVD-graphene with highly aligned crystalline lamellae, offering a potential route for scalable high-performance polymer/2D heterostructures with controlled polymer crystals (Fig. 8j–l). Additionally, we found that polymer epitaxy on a 2D surface can be useful for characterizing various structural properties of CVD-2D materials, such as the distribution of grains and grain boundaries.73,74 The results indicate that epitaxial crystallization of a polymer on CVD-graphene with various grains is abruptly altered at the grain boundaries, allowing for clear visualization of the boundaries. Because the photoelectronic properties of most 2D materials significantly depend on the grains and grain boundaries, visualization of this information can be critical for designing photoelectronic polymer/2D heterostructures.
Conclusions
This review summarized the progress in semi-crystalline photoelectronic polymer/2D heterostructures, including F-based insulating polymers for dielectric, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric 2D-based devices and various semiconducting polymers for photo-absorbing, detecting, carrier transporting, and emitting devices. Recent studies involving polymer/2D heterostructures clearly indicated the importance of controlling the hierarchical molecular and crystalline structures of semi-crystalline polymers on 2D nanomaterials, for ensuring efficient device performance. Polymer epitaxy was proposed as an efficient route for controlling the molecular structures and microstructures of semi-crystalline polymers. In this regard, 2D nanomaterials with an atomically flat and dangling-bond-free crystalline surface offer a novel platform for epitaxial crystallization of polymers. Applying polymer epitaxy to 2D nanomaterials can yield unprecedented anisotropic photoelectronic properties of polymers (e.g., carrier mobility and piezo-/ferroelectricity) arising from the directionally ordered polymer crystals dictated by the epitaxial relation. The strategy of fabricating polymer/2D heterostructures via polymer epitaxy on a 2D surface is scalable, making them suitable for integrated circuit and wearable & patchable photoelectronics that exhibit high performances with excellent mechanical flexibility over a large area.
