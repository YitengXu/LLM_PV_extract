1. Introduction
The quest to develop molecule based advanced materials for the betterment of mankind is a never ending process. Recent spectacular developments in the field of synthetic methodologies, catalysis and reagents have made significant contributions to the synthesis of organic molecules with new or improved properties. These methodologies allow the synthesis of a variety of compounds that form integral parts of modern electronic and photonic devices. Functional dyes, π-conjugated molecules and chromophore based systems are just a few examples. Among these molecules, functional dyes are extremely important in photon based technologies for optical data storage and communication.1 Squaraines are an intensely studied class of organic dyes, which are used for wide ranging applications such as imaging,2,3 nonlinear optics,4–6 photovoltaics,7–9 photodynamic therapy10 and ion sensing.11 The present feature article is meant to give a flavor of the multifaceted applications of squaraine dyes, particularly the materials chemistry aspects, for further exploration and research.
Squaraines are a class of dyes with resonance stabilized zwitterionic structure. A representative example is shown in Scheme 1. Squaraines typically contains an electron deficient central four membered ring and two electron-donating groups in a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A-D) form. Squaraines in general have strong absorption (ε > 105 L mol–1 cm–1) in the visible region and are photostable. Most of these dyes emit in the visible to near-IR region. Theoretical calculations suggested that both the ground state and the excited singlet state of squaraines involve significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Thus the S0–S1 electronic excitation can be considered as a CT transition. The intramolecular charge transfer characteristics of this transition, combined with the extended π-electron donor network, results in high molar extinction coefficients of squaraines in the visible region of the spectrum. The intense absorption and emission properties of squaraines are suitable for applications related to the photosensitization phenomenon.12 Therefore, in the past several decades, squaraine chemistry has been at the center stage of research from both fundamental and technological viewpoints.
 Scheme 1 
Squaraine dyes were first reported in 1965 by Triebs and Jacob, who reported the formation of an insoluble product 6 (Scheme 2) when pyrrole was reacted with 3,4-dihydroxy-3-cyclobutene-1,2-dione (squaric acid).13
 Scheme 2 
Later, a plethora of reports have appeared in the literature establishing the importance of the synthesis and application of squaraine dye as a novel class of intensely colored organic dyes.14 These dyes are generally prepared by the condensation of electron rich aromatic or heterocyclic compounds such as N,N-dialkylanilines, benzothiazoles, phenols, azulenes and pyrroles with squaric acid. Typical absorption and emission spectra of a squaraine dye derived from N,N-dimethylaniline, in solution, are shown in Fig. 1.

Since a number of aromatic and heterocyclic systems with varying donor strengths are available, there are immense possibilities to design a variety of squaraine dyes with tunable optical properties in the visible to the near-IR range which allows their use in electronic and photonic devices. In the solid- state many of these dyes exhibit a broad absorption with significant quenching of the emission due to the aggregation of the dye which needs to be controlled in order to improve the device efficiency. The following sections will highlight the recent developments with squaraine dyes and their use as molecular materials in various applications.
2. Near infrared (NIR) dyes for optical recording and imaging
NIR absorbing organic dyes are important in optical recording devices based on gallium arsenide diode lasers (780–803 nm), Nd–YAG lasers (1064 nm) and in the imaging of biological specimens. Squaraine dyes are well suited for these applications. Therefore, the design and synthesis of squaraine dyes which absorb or emit in the NIR wavelength are of technological significance. An approach to synthesize NIR active squaraine dyes is to increase the electron-donating ability of the amino donor group of the N,N-diaryl amine moieties (Chart 1).16 When the lone pair orbital of the amino donor group is forced into greater overlap with the rest of the chromogen, the absorption maximum of the dye 8a is shifted by 30 nm to the longer wavelength region (λmax = 670 nm) in comparison to the parent dye 7 (λmax = 640 nm) in the same solvent. In dye 9, there is enhanced overlap between the lone pair orbital on nitrogen and the π-electron system which results in the molecule absorbing at 700 nm. Dye 10 demonstrates clearly how increasing the number of electron-donating groups of the arylamine ring can cause a pronounced bathochromic shift of the absorption band. The large shift in absorption when compared to 7 is due to the presence of two electron-donating groups at positions 2 and 5 relative to the electron acceptor ring.
 Chart 1 
Stilbenoid compounds have received considerable attention as optical brighteners, laser dyes, and light emitting diodes due to their unique optoelectronic properties.17 A combination of stilbene and squaraine moieties has resulted in a number of stilbenoid squaraines (11a–d) which exhibit intense (ε > 250000 L mol–1 cm–1) and sharp absorption bands with maxima between 687–778 nm.18 Symmetrical squaraines having stilbenyl substituents exhibit dramatic bathochromic shifts of π–π* transitions in the longer wavelength region. For example extension of conjugation in 11a and 11b leads to a bathochromic shift of about 250 nm (Δλnm) in the absorption spectra. However, in contrast to the theoretical predictions, further extension of conjugation from 11b to 11d caused a hypsochromic shift in the absorption maxima. This is explained by considering the distance between donor and acceptor groups, which has a decisive role in the charge transfer transitions and the quinoid resonance structures of 11a–d. Quinoid resonance structures become energetically unfavorable with increasing conjugation in 11a–d, since more and more benzene rings are displaced by paraquinone rings.  
Typical symmetrical squaraine dyes have larger molar absorption coefficients (ε > 105 dm3 mol–1 cm–1) with narrow half widths. For example, squaraine dyes 12 and 13 (Chart 2) based on pyrimidine and pyrylium derivatives absorb in the range of 700–800 nm. They are useful as photoreceptors for diode lasers in laser optical recording, laser printing, photolabelling, and DNA sequencing.19,20 The unsymmetrical squaraine dyes 14 and 15 (Chart 2) absorb in the region of 739–821 nm in chloroform.21 In contrast to the symmetrical dyes 12 and 13, the nature of the absorption spectra of the unsymmetrical dyes 14 and 15 exhibits significant changes (Fig. 2). This is due to the fact that in unsymmetrical squaraine dyes the electron donating ability of one aromatic moiety is significantly different from that of the other.

Extension of conjugation using vinyl aromatic end groups as in squaraine dyes 16–18 (Chart 3) imparts interesting redox properties.22 For example, incorporation of two vinyl benzene moieties to the N-alkyl pyrrole based squaraine dye, resulted in dye 16 that exhibits a red shift in the absorption maximum from 547 to 687 nm in toluene. Improving the electron donor strength of the benzene moiety allowed further red shift of 13–20 nm in the case of the dye 17. The dye 18 could be reversibly oxidized to radical cations and dications whereas reduction showed limited electrochemical but full chemical reversibility. The radical cation of 18 has an absorption band at 1000 nm and a “two-band” feature at 1600 nm. It is assumed that oxidation leads to an electronic situation at the mixed valence radical cation stage in which the positive charge is primarily localized on the vinylpyrrole subunits. The promising optical and redox properties of squaraine dyes and the observation that extension of conjugation has significant effects in the absorption properties led to the synthesis of a number of squaraine based oligomers and polymers with intrinsic semiconducting properties.
 Chart 3 
Although squaraine dyes have promising photophysical properties, in many cases they are susceptible to chemical attack by nucleophilic molecules. In addition, aggregation of squaraines leads to shifts in the absorption and quenching of the emission, which are detrimental for applications. However, recently it has been shown that encapsulation of a squaraine dye with a macrocyclic cage to form a rotaxane 19 provides good chemical stability to the dye for several weeks with improved emission.23 The rotaxane cage protects the squaraine ring from nucleophilic attack and provides better stability. This approach also helps prevent the aggregation of squaraine dyes which is vital in the fabrication of solid-state devices.  
3. NIR polymers and low band gap systems
Design of π-conjugated polymers with low optical band gaps is important due to their intrinsic semiconducting properties.24 Though a variety of NIR absorbing organic dyes are known, π-conjugated polymers that absorb in the range of 800–1200 nm are rare.25 Due to their inherently low HOMO–LUMO energy gap, which can be modulated by varying the conjugation length and donor–acceptor interactions, squaraines are potential candidates for the design of polymers with low optical band gaps. This hypothesis is theoretically predicted by Brocks and Tol.26 Bifunctional heterocyclic aromatic compounds such as pyrrole, carbazole and benzothiazoles are suitable substrates, which on polycondensation with squaric acid form either oligomers or polymers with squaraine backbones. Extension of the conjugation length of squaraines to oligomers and polymers, in principle, is expected to improve the optical and the electronic conducting properties. However, early attempts were unsuccessful due to the formation of insoluble materials.13,27 Later, Havinga and coworkers have made significant contributions to the synthesis and studies of soluble polysquaraines based on benzobisthiazoles and benzobispyrrolines.28

Pyrrole derivatives are suitable monomers for the synthesis of polysquaraines.29,30 Reaction of N-alkyl or 3-alkyl substituted pyrroles with squaric acid is reported to provide polysquaraines 20–23 (Chart 4), the structures and properties of which vary depending upon reaction conditions.31 The water soluble copolymer 23 prepared by the reaction of squaric acid with a mixture of pyrrole and pyrrole-N-propanesulfonate showed conductivities in the range of 10–5 S cm–1 depending upon the copolymer composition. Polycondensation of bispyrroles of the structure 24 with squaric acid resulted in the formation of a series polysquaraines of the general structure 25 (Scheme 3). Continuous recording of the electronic spectra with progress of the reaction indicates the increase in the intensity of the absorption in the NIR region with broadening of the spectra (Fig. 3). The broad absorption from visible to the NIR wavelength indicates low optical band gaps in these polymers. The strong donor–acceptor interaction in these polymers may facilitate the resonance-stabilized quinoid structures,32 which may be responsible for the observed long wavelength optical absorption (Scheme 4).

 Scheme 4 
The solution and solid-state band gaps of the polymers, calculated from the onset of the absorption bands, are in the range of 0.7–1.1 eV. The intrinsic conductivities measured by two-probe method were in the order of 10–4–10–7 S cm–1. Although the band gaps of these polysquaraines are very close to each other, the intrinsic conductivities showed considerable variation. This can be explained based on the solid-state packing of the polymer chains as established by the powder X-ray diffraction data that showed interdigitated packing, the spacing of which varies with the length of the side chains. Polysquaraines with short side chains exhibited higher conductivities due to the close inter-chain packing and inter-layer π-stacking which facilitate electron hopping. A decrease in conductivity with a steady increase in the length of the side chains is due to the disruption of the π-stacking by the increased d-spacing within the layered assemblies.
4. Solar cells and field-effect transistors
Dye sensitized photovoltaic devices involving organic dyes and mesoporous nanocrystalline titania have attracted greater attention in industry and academic research. Due to the large molar extinction coefficients and apparent ease of synthesis, organic dyes are promising candidates for the design of dye sensitized solar cells. In photovoltaic devices two processes govern the efficient generation of electricity: i) ultra-fast electron injection from a photoexcited dye into the conduction band of a semiconductor (TiO2) and ii) subsequent dye regeneration and hole transport into the counter electrode. An essential criterion for efficient conversion of solar energy is the spectral match of the sensitizer absorption to the solar radiation. Owing to the availability of a number of new dyes with intense far-red/near-IR absorption properties and high molar extinction coefficients, squaraine dyes have received considerable attention in recent years.33
A photovoltaic device based on the unsymmetrical squaraine dye 26 with 2.08% solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency was developed recently by Das and co-workers.34 Photovoltaic devices based on unsymmetrical squaraine dyes show greater photon to current conversion efficiencies when compared to those of the symmetrical squaraine dyes. Molecular calculations showed a unidirectional flow of electrons on excitation of unsymmetrical squaraine dyes, as opposed to the flow of electrons towards the centre of the molecule on excitation of symmetrical squaraine dyes, which could result in the improved charge separation from the excited state of symmetrical squaraine dyes.  
The latest report on the fabrication of a photovoltaic device using the unsymmetrical squaraine dye 27 exhibited high photon-to-current conversion efficiency with a 4.5% solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency.35 The high efficiency of the squaraine sensitizer 27 is attributed to the unique molecular design due to the fact that the carboxylic acid moiety is the part of the conjugation which provides strong electronic coupling to the conduction band of TiO2. Moreover, the asymmetry created by the octyl chain prevents aggregation and limits self-quenching of the excited states. Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent action spectrum obtained with a sandwich cell. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of excitation wavelength shows 85% efficiency. This is one of the highest values reported for a squaraine based photovoltaic device.

Recent progress in the field of organic-based optoelectronic devices has led to the development of field-effect transistors (FETs) which are viewed as possible low cost alternatives to their inorganic counterparts. The majority of the organic FETs are capable of transporting only a single type of charge, like holes or electrons. Therefore, they are “unipolar” FETs. Recently, it was demonstrated that light emission within the transistor channel can happen in “ambipolar” FETs, i.e. FETs capable of transporting both holes and electrons. In an ambipolar light-emitting organic FET when the gate is biased between the source and drain potentials, holes and electrons are injected simultaneously at the opposite ends of the channel. When the local potential within the channel equals the gate potential, a p–n junction is formed at which the opposite carriers can recombine to form excitons. When these excitons undergo radiative decay, the device emits light. Leeuw and coworkers have demonstrated an alternative approach to ambipolar light-emitting FETs by using a solution processable small band gap squarylium dye 28 as a near-infrared ambipolar light emitting organic field effect transistor (LEOFET).36 Under proper bias conditions, holes and electrons recombine within the channel and the transistor emits light in the NIR region. Efficient control of the emission region of the dye is achieved by varying the drain/gate potentials.  
5. Two-photon absorption and fluorescence patterning
Two-photon absorption (TPA) in certain organic molecules with large TPA cross sections (δ) has attracted considerable interest in recent years since it offers many applications in biological imaging and materials science. Recently a few reports have appeared which pertain to the TPA properties of squaraines. For example, the π-extended squaraines 29–32 (Chart 5) are shown to be good candidates for two-photon absorption studies.37 These dyes were designed in such a way that the terminal donor groups were separated from the central squarylium acceptor core by conjugated bridges composed of vinylene groups and electron-rich heterocycles. These dyes show extremely large δ values, a two-photon wavelength of 1 µm and large third-order susceptibility in a film at telecommunication wavelengths.
 Chart 5 
Recently a hybrid molecule 33 comprising of squaraine and azo dye moieties has been found suitable for fluorescence patterning.38 A dye doped PMMA film, when subjected to light interference pattern for 1 h, created fluorescence gratings with a 10% intensity contrast and a 1.3 µm periodic spacing as visualized by confocal microscopy imaging (Fig. 5). In the absence of light, the holographic writing process revealed no fluorescence grating structure. Photoisomerization of the azo groups plays a crucial role in the fluorescence modulation of the generated gratings. The authors have ruled out any optical artifacts or local photobleaching effects during the writing process. Erasure of the patterns could be performed with circularly polarised Ar+ light for 20 min. A second writing could regenerate the fluorescence grating albeit with lower contrast. This is a promising application for squaraine dyes in the field of optical recording and holography.

6. Molecular probes for cations and anions
Selective sensing of a specific analyte using molecular probes is a topic of considerable interest due to their importance in different fields such as chemistry, biology, medicine and environmental studies. Squaraine dyes are suitable for this purpose due to their favorable optical properties, which become perturbed with polarity of solvents, temperature and ionic inputs. Binding of substrates can occur either to the oxygen atom of the electron deficient cyclobutene ring or to an ionophore which is integrated into the squaraine dye resulting in a measurable change in the absorption, emission or redox properties. A large number of squaraines have been used as probes for the detection of a variety of analytes.39 However, selectivity and sensitivity in most of the cases are not very promising. This limitation has led to further studies on the design of squaraine based molecular probes for better selectivity and sensitivity.
The pyrrole derived polysquaraines having different podand chains exhibit selectivity towards alkali metal cations when compared to analogous model dyes.40 For example, the polysquaraine 34 is selective to Li+ over Na+ and K+. Although there is no change in the absorption spectrum of the polymer, considerable enhancement in the fluorescence emission is observed upon Li+ binding (Fig. 6). However, the model squaraine dye 36 shows a very weak response to Li+ revealing the crucial role of the polysquaraine backbone in the signal amplification.  
 Fig. 6  a) Effect of various alkali metal ion concentrations (Li+, K+, Na+) on fluorescence quantum yield of 34 (λexc = 520 nm). b) Comparison of the effect of Li+ concentration on the fluorescence quantum yield of 34 and the model dye 36. (Adapted from ref. 40.) 
Squaraines are known to form “H” (blue shift) and “J” (red shift) aggregates in appropriate solvents. In the majority of cases they favor the blue-shifted “H” aggregates with strong quenching of the emission. This phenomenon could be used for the detection of a specific cation if the binding event induces the aggregation of the dye. The idea is illustrated with squaraine dye-linked podands that upon binding with a specific cation form folded or sandwiched complexes similar to the “H” aggregates as shown in Fig. 7. Exciton interaction in the bound complex produces a visual colorimetric response or measurable changes in the emission spectrum. This concept has been successfully illustrated with the help of squaraine tethered bichromophoric podands of the general structure 37 and analogous monochromophores of the general structure 38 by changing the length of the oxyethylene spacer.41  
 Fig. 7  Schematic representation of a squaraine based chemosensor which operates on cation driven exciton interaction. 
The bichromophores 37a–f allows strong perturbation in the absorption and emission spectra with high selectivity toward alkaline earth metal cations, particularly to Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions. However, no optical response was noticed against alkali metal ions. Interestingly, the bichromophore 37e with five oxygen atoms in the podand chain shows high selectivity to Ca2+ and the binding is visible to the naked eye due to the color change from light blue to deep purple blue (Fig. 8). This change in the optical properties is associated with the exciton interaction between the chromophores due to the cation steered folding of the molecule and not due to a simple reorganization of the electronic structure as a result of the cation binding. This is clear from the fact that, although the monochromophores 38a–c binds to the cations, no change in the optical properties could be noticed. Although these dyes show remarkable responses towards Ca2+ and Mg2+ in acetonitrile, their practical application is limited due to the tendency of the dye to aggregate under aqueous conditions even in the absence of cations. Therefore, the challenge is to design squaraine based bichromophoric systems which are soluble under aqueous conditions without self-aggregation of the dye units.
 Fig. 8  Change in the a) absorption and b) emission (λexc = 580 nm) spectra of 37e in acetonitrile upon addition of Ca2+ ions. Inset shows visible color change of bichromophore (n = 5) in acetonitrile upon addition of Ca2+: (1) in the absence of metal salts, (2) Mg2+ (3) Na+, (4) K+ and (5) Ca2+. (Adapted from ref. 41.) 
Yagi and co-workers have recently reported that binding of Ca2+ occurs even in the absence of a podand chain as illustrated with a bis-squaraine connected to a polymethylene chain.42 In this case it is suggested that the binding occurs through the oxygen atom of the cyclobutene ring which is extremely weak when compared to that of the podand linked dyes 39a–c. The initially formed 1 : 1 folded complex further leads to the formation of metallo-supramolecular assemblies through extended allosteric chelation of the negatively charged oxygens (Fig. 9).

The electron deficient central cyclobutene ring of squaraine dyes is vulnerable for nucleophilic attack which will break the conjugation of the dye resulting in the bleaching of the color. Thus, N,N-dialkylaniline derived squaraine dyes have been found useful as dosimeters for the detection of CN– ions and biorelevant thiols such as cysteine.43 Interestingly, addition of Hg2+ to the thiol adduct of squaraines (41) regenerate the original dye (40) which allow the use of squaraines as reusable dosimeters (Scheme 5).44 The method allows the selective detection of Hg2+ below 2 ppb under aqueous conditions (Fig. 10). The possibility of the probe to adsorb or anchor on a suitable support permits the design of prototypes of reusable dip-sticks for the rapid screening of analytes.

Another interesting application of squaraine dyes pertains to the design of an ionically controlled nanoscopic molecular gate.45 A mesoscopic MCM-41-type solid support S1 functionalised with propane thiol groups in the interior and amino groups at the exterior of the pores is used for this purpose (Scheme 6). Similar supports having thiol free solid S2 and amino free solid S3 were used for comparison. Anion controlled mass transport from solution to the pores in S1 is studied using a pH responsive colorimetric reaction of the squaraine dye 42 with a mercaptopropyl moiety. At pH 5, the color of the dye is bleached in the presence of different anions with time at different rates as shown in Fig. 11. In the presence of ATP the bleaching of the dye is minimal indicating that the nanoscopic gates are closed by ATP. This system shows that control of mass transport of molecules can be achieved using suitable rigid solids, anions and pH responsive squaraine dyes.

Nocera et al. have developed a ratiometric nanocrystal based pH sensor by conjugating a squaraine dye to the surface of CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals (NC).46 The sensor was constructed from a colloidal CdSe nanocrystal coated with an outer layer of ZnS. Phosphine oxide ligands are encapsulated with an amphiphilic polymer upon which a pH sensitive squaraine dye is conjugated. Upon excitation, the CdSe/ZnS nanocrystal may either fluoresce or transfer energy to the squaraine dye. The sensing action of the NC–squaraine conjugate is imparted by modulation of the FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) efficiency arising from the overlap of the pH sensitive dye absorption spectrum with pH sensitive quantum dot emission (Fig. 12). A ratiometric response to pH was observed owing to the modulation of FRET efficiency between the emissive NC and the dye conjugated to the nanocrystal surface.

Recently, Ca2+ binding of the tripodal squaraines 43a–b was shown to have control of the morphology upon evaporation of an acetonitrile solution on a mica surface.47 In the absence of cations, vesicular assemblies are formed as evidenced by AFM and TEM analyses (Fig. 13a, b). Upon binding with Ca2+ and Mg2+ the vesicular assemblies change to extended structures. A chiral tripodal squaraine derivative 43c upon binding with Ca2+ exhibited a bisignate CD signal (Fig. 13c) indicating the formation of helical nanostructures which is confirmed by AFM images (Fig. 13d). CD signals and supramolecular helicity were observed only for the cation complexed chiral dye and not for the aggregates of the dye alone from an acetonitrile–water mixture. This is an example of cation controlled self-assembly of a squaraine derivative to supramolecular nanoarchitectures.

7. Conclusions
The extensive literature on squaraine dyes testifies that they have been at the centre stage of research for the past several years due to their technological relevance. The optical properties of these dyes are excellent for a wide range of applications. Even though the earlier studies were mainly focused on squaraine dyes as sensitizers in imaging applications, later they were found useful as molecular probes, sensitizers for solar cells, two-photon imaging, and FRET applications. The optical properties of these dyes can be tuned to a great extent by structural modifications to suit a specific application. Self-assembly of tailor-made squaraines results in nanosized supramolecular structures the size and shape of which can be controlled by cation complexation. Therefore, there is tremendous scope for squaraine dyes as functional materials for applications in the fields of advanced materials. It is expected that in the coming years the chemistry and applications of squaraine dyes will be strengthened further.
