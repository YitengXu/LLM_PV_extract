    , Accepted 22nd May 2020First published on 30th May 2020AbstractThe electronic properties of dyes can be readily tuned by modifying the structure. Herein, the polyoxometalate (POM)-based dyes derived from dye XW11 with new patterns, donor–acceptor–π linker–acceptor (D–A–π–A) structure (dye 1), and D–π–A–π–A structure (dye 2) were designed by inserting a POM moiety besides the extensively exploited D–π–A structure (dye 3). Based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations, the configuration effect on the designed dyes was investigated. The results indicate that dye 3 possesses the largest short-circuit photocurrent density JSC due to the red-shifted absorption spectra, superior intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) parameters and the largest electron injection efficiency. At the same time, dye 1 with a D–A–π–A structure not only benefits the conduction band energy shift, but also retards the charge recombination and dye aggregation effect, which is beneficial for open-circuit photovoltage VOC. Moreover, the dynamics analysis of interfacial electron transfer shows that the electrons in dye 1 are almost completely injected after 14 fs, while it takes a long time for dyes 2 and 3. The present work is expected to establish a structure–property relationship for future dye design.
1. Introduction
Increasing consumption of fossil fuels and environmental pollution problems has prompted research on new sustainable and inexhaustible energy sources such as solar energy.1–3 Among the efficient sunlight-to-electricity devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) present promising potential due to their low production cost, easy fabrication and relatively high solar energy conversion efficiency, and intensive attempts have been devoted to improving the efficiency of DSSCs since the seminal work reported by Grätzel in 1991.4 Given that dyes play vital roles in the light harvesting process of DSSCs by injecting photoexcited electrons into a semiconductor (usually TiO2) conduction band (CB), some research studies have focused on molecular engineering of ruthenium polypyridines,5,6 metal-free organic dyes7 and porphyrin dyes.8,9 Porphyrins are considered to be the most promising candidates in view of their intrinsic light harvesting ability and photochemical stability,10,11 which show a strong light absorption band at 400–500 nm (Soret band) and a moderately weak absorption at 550–700 nm (Q band).12 However, the absorption loss in the rest of the visible region of the porphyrin dye limits the photovoltaic performance. Yella et al. reported a Zn-porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 with a power conversion efficiency of 12.3%.8 Subsequently, a conversion efficiency of 13% was achieved with Zn-porphyrin dye SM315,9 while the efficiency still lags behind that of conventional Si-based solar cells (25%). Thus, massive efforts were made for seeking potential dyes to obtain high short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), and to further achieve the high conversion efficiency of the cell. The incorporation of conjugated groups in dyes is a common method to improve JSC by extending the light response range, while the conjugation extension can induce dye aggregation, resulting in decreased open-circuit photovoltage (VOC).13 So, it is of great significance to seek alternative methods for simultaneously red-shifting the absorption band and retarding dye aggregation effect, and finally improving JSC and VOC of DSSCs, which affect the conversion efficiency of cells directly (see theoretical background in the ESI†).
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been widely applied in many fields, such as catalysis, material science, and magnetism owing to their excellent structural diversity, remarkable thermal stability and superior optoelectronic properties.14–20 POMs can be used as inorganic building blocks for constructing inorganic–organic hybrids, in which maximum absorption bands can significantly red-shift compared with POMs and organic segments resulting from the synergistic effects.21 Furthermore, the non-planar conformation of the POM moiety is in favour of suppressing the aggregation and thus improving VOC.
The donor–π linker–acceptor (D–π–A) structure is a common configuration that is desirable for efficient photoinduced charge separation. Zhang et al. reported that dyes with the introduction of building blocks at different positions generated different electronic structures and absorption properties.22 Besides the extensively exploited D–π–A framework, a series of new patterns, such as D–D–π–A,23 D–A–π–A24 and double D–π–A type25 have been designed to accelerate the intramolecular charge transition (ICT) process under photo-irradiation and improve the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Which one is the best for enhancing the performance of DSSCs? And are there more efficient configuration types of dyes that can be constructed? According to the above-mentioned effective strategy, a series of POM-based dyes are designed in the present work. Theoretical calculations as low-cost and reliable ways are becoming crucial tools to describe the properties of dyes and predict the performance of dyes in DSSCs.26–30 The configuration effects resulting from different positions of POM inserted in dyes on the performance of DSSCs are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations. To our knowledge, it is the first time that these structure types have been compared. In order to explore the structure–property relationship of dyes, the factors affecting JSC and VOC including absorption spectra, ICT parameters, conduction band energy shift, charge recombination and dye aggregation effects as well as the interfacial electron transfer (IET) processes are taken into consideration. It is expected that the present work can provide a commendable option for further designing high performance dyes.
2. Computation details
All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 D01 package31 unless otherwise stated. The ground-state geometries of all the POM-based dyes were optimized with the B3LYP functional.32 For Mo and Zn atoms, the LANL2DZ effective core potential and associated basis set were used. The 6-31G(d) basis set was used for other atoms. The solvent effect of acetonitrile was taken into account based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM).33 In order to provide insight into the absorption properties of the studied dyes, TD-DFT calculations were performed by computing the lowest 50 singlet–singlet excitation states in tetrahydrofuran solvent. The PBE0 hybrid functional34 has been proved to be reliable in predicting vertical excitation energies of POM-based dyes in our previous work.29 The absorption spectrum of XW11 simulated by PBE0 (455 nm) is in good agreement with the experimental value (465 nm),35 and is displayed in Table S1 (ESI†), confirming that PBE0 is appropriate to compute the excitation energy in this work. Thus, the excitation properties of the studied dyes were calculated at the PBE0/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level. The absorption spectra were simulated using Gaussian functions with a full-width at half maximum of 0.1 eV. To evaluate the charge recombination dynamics, we optimized the dye–I2 complexes at the M062X/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level, which has proven to be suitable for describing the weak interactions between dyes and I2.36,37 Moreover, the basis set superposition error (BSSE) to binding energy for dye–I2 systems was calculated using a counterpoise method.38 Aiming to search for the most stable dimer structures for dyes, 50 configurations for each dye generated using the Molclus program39 were adopted as initial structures for optimization under the B3LYP/3-21G level using the Gaussian 09 D01 package. The obtained lowest energy dimer structures with Na+ as the counterion to eliminate the effect of negative charge were further optimized at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level.40 At the same time, the interaction energies for dimers were calculated at the same level of theory. In addition, reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis41 was performed using Multiwfn software.42
The (TiO2)48 cluster obtained by appropriately cutting an anatase (101) surface was used to model the surface effect of bulk TiO2,37 and dyes adsorbed on (TiO2)48 through the bidentate binding mode were studied using the Dmol3 program.43 The dye–TiO2 systems were optimized using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional44,45 of generalized gradient approximation (GGA)46 and double numerical polarization (DNP) basis set. The dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface can lead to the energy shift of ECB (ΔECB). The density of state (DOS) for pure TiO2 and partial DOS (PDOS) of TiO2 in dye–TiO2 complexes for evaluating ΔECB were obtained at the B3LYP-D3/3-21G(d) level. The atomic charge distributions were calculated using the Merz–Kollman method47,48 to obtain the average dye electrostatic potential and the corresponding computational details are described in the ESI.† To elucidate the interaction nature for the dimers of the dyes, simple energy decomposition analysis (EDA) was performed, and the details about orbital interaction ΔEorb, steric interaction ΔEsteric and interaction energy ΔEtot are shown in the ESI.† Aiming at quantitatively evaluating the IET rate, the semi-classical quantum dynamics simulations were applied for dye–TiO2 systems by using the IETsim code based upon semi-empirical extend Hückel theory method,49,50 which has been widely used to investigate photo-induced electron transfer across semiconductor interfaces,51 and the details can be found in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Molecular structures
Taking XW11 dye35 as a prototype, the alkyl chain in XW11 is replaced by a methyl group to reduce the computational cost. Starting from the simplified XW11 dye, Lindqvist-type [Mo6O19]2− is inserted between the Zn-porphyrin donor and ethyne π linker to yield a D–A–π–A structure (dye 1), and between ethyne and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole π linker to form a D–π–A–π–A structure (dye 2), while dye 3 with a D–π–A framework is constructed by inserting [Mo6O19]2− between the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole π linker and benzoic acid acceptor. The molecular structures of simplified XW11 and dyes 1–3 are displayed in Fig. 1.

3.2. Electronic structures
For DSSCs, an appropriate frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy level of the dye matching basic energetic requirements is necessary for fast charge transfer, in which the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy should be higher than the CB level of TiO2 (−4.00 eV), ensuring the efficient electron injection from the excited dye into TiO2, while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the dye should be lower than the redox potential energy of I−/I3− (−4.80 eV),37 guaranteeing that in the efficient dye regeneration the excited dye could freely obtain an electron from the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2, the LUMO energies for all studied dyes are more positive than the CB energy of TiO2, and the HOMO energies are more negative than the I−/I3− redox potential, showing that all studied dyes meet the application of DSSCs. It can be seen that the HOMO energies slightly increase and the LUMO energies slightly decrease from dye 1 to dye 3, thus, the HOMO–LUMO (H–L) gap decreases in the order of 1 (1.64 eV) > 2 (1.60 eV) > 3 (1.56 eV). Considering that a smaller H–L gap means a lower energy is needed for the dye excitation, the absorption spectra of dye 3 might red-shift compared with those of dyes 1 and 2.

The FMO distributions of dyes 1–3 (Fig. 3) show that the studied dyes have similar LUMO distributions, which localize on the POM moiety, while the HOMO distributions of dyes 1–3 are different. For dye 1, the electron donor group plays a vital role for HOMO distribution, while the HOMO localizes on the electron donor and ethyne π linker for dye 2, and spreads over 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole π linker for dye 3. Such electronic distributions on the HOMOs and LUMOs of dyes 1–3 are ideal for transferring the photoexcited electron from the electron donor to acceptor group, and reducing the recombination of electrons and holes.

3.3. Factors influencing JSC

3.3.1. Absorption spectra. 
There is no doubt that the absorption property of a dye is a crucial factor affecting JSC of DSSCs. The better the matching between the dye's absorption spectra and the solar radiation spectrum, the larger the JSC is. The simulated absorption spectra of the studied dyes are shown in Fig. 4, and the calculated excitation energies (Ev), maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strengths (f) and major assignments are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectra of dyes 1–3 are divided into three absorption ranges: the peaks locate in the range of 400–450 nm, 450–600 nm and 600–850 nm. Compared with dye 1, the λmax of dyes 2 and 3 red-shift from 709 to 731 and 763 nm, respectively, which is favorable for harvesting sunlight. The trend of the red-shifted absorption from dyes 1 to 3 resulting from the closer position of the inserted POM moiety on the electron acceptor side is well consistent with the “Electronic structures” discussed above.

Each excitation consists of many electron transitions, and the electronic transitions of λmax are characterized by the dominant HOMO → LUMO contribution, 70% for dye 1, 91% and 95% for dyes 2 and 3, respectively. The electron density difference maps (EDDMs) are the sum of all electron transitions used to describe the transition nature. The EDDM of dyes 1–3 are displayed in Table 1 in which the regions of purple and blue represent the electron density depletion and increment, respectively. It can see that the EDDMs of dyes 1–3 are similar and the main absorption bands of these dyes are ascribed to the electron transition from the electron donor groups to POMs and π-linkers.


3.3.2. Intramolecular charge transfer analysis. 
As we all know, it is crucial that the electron is transferred from the donor to acceptor part upon excitation. The composition of the fragment in the hole and electron, as well as the hole–electron overlap in various fragment spaces can be plotted as a heat map, and their distribution character can be very vividly exhibited. The heat maps of dyes 1–3 are depicted in Fig. 5 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. For dyes 1–3, it can be seen that the holes mainly localize on electron donor groups, while the electrons mainly distribute on π linkers and POMs, indicating that the ICT are attributed to the electron transfer from donor groups to π linkers and POM cluster, which is beneficial for the efficient electron injection. To evaluate the ICT extent, the key parameters of the studied dyes including the amount of transferred charges (qCT), the corresponding effective charge transfer distance (dCT) and t index are given in Fig. 6. It is apparent that the qCT and t values increase as follows: dye 1 < dye 3 < dye 2, while the dCT follows the order of dye 1 < dye 2 < dye 3, which emphasizes the importance of the dye configuration resulting from the position of the POM unit. At the same time, dyes 2 and 3 have superior ICT parameters than that of dye 1, which can improve the ICT process.

3.3.3. Electron injection efficiency. 
As discussed in the theoretical backgroud of SI, we know that the large light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and coupling between electron donor and acceptor states (VDA), negative injection driving force ΔGinj combined with small |ΔGinj + χ| can guarantee a large JSC, in which χ is the reorganization energy. All the studied dyes have similar VDA estimated by the fragment contribution of anchoring atoms for LUMOs (Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating that they have similar electronic coupling. The values of LHE, oxidation potential of ground state dye Edye, oxidation potential of excited state dye Edye*, ΔGinj and χ of the studied dyes were computed and summarized in Table 2. All the studied dyes have negative ΔGinj, implying that they have enough driving force to inject the electron from dyes into the surface of TiO2. The values of |ΔGinj + χ| are in the order: 3 (0.20) < 1 (0.26) < 2 (0.73). At the same time, the LHE value of dye 3 is the largest among dyes 1–3, showing that dye 3 is beneficial for light harvesting. As a result, it could predict that dye 3 with the D–π–A configuration has the largest JSC owing to the smallest |ΔGinj + χ| and the largest LHE value.

3.4. Factors influencing VOC spectra

3.4.1. The conduction band energy shift. 
Dyes with a carboxylic acid anchoring group adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface generally adopt a dissociative bidentate bridging mode, which is demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectra experiments52 and is verified by theoretical works.53,54 So the bidentate bridging adsorption mode was adopted in the present work. As stated by Angelis et al., the dye adsorption can evoke ΔECB, which is an important factor that affects VOC.55 In order to obtain ΔECB, we evaluated the DOS profiles of pure TiO2 and PDOS profiles of TiO2 in the dye–TiO2 complexes as shown in Fig. 7, in which dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface shift the CB edge of TiO2 towards a more negative direction with respect to the CB of pristine TiO2, and ΔECB increases in the following order: dye 1 (0.009 eV) < dye 2 (0.012 eV) < dye 3 (0.041 eV). In order to deeply understand the molecular structures of dyes affecting ΔECB, two main effects including charge transfer effect nCT attributed to the dye–TiO2 bond formation and the electrostatic effect VEL owing to the dye dipole moments were considered.55 The nCT and VEL are described in Fig. 8, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). Among dyes 1–3, the smallest ΔECB towards a more negative direction with respect to the CB of pristine TiO2 for dye 1 result from the smallest nCT and VEL, which is beneficial for VOC.

3.4.2. Charge recombination. 
Considering the working priciple, the injection of electrons in the CB of TiO2 could recombine with the oxidized dyes and the redox couple in the electrolyte, and the latter is the dominated recombination route,56 resulting in the decreased electron number in CB (nc), thus the decreased VOC. In order to gain insight into the configuration effect of the dye on recombination kinetics, the interaction between the dye and I2 that could affect the local concentration of I2 near TiO2 was investigated. The closer the bonding site is to the TiO2 semiconductor surface, the faster the charge recombination is. It is commonly accepted that the special atoms in dyes, such as N, O and S atoms, could bind with I2 to form halogen bonding through a non-covalent interaction (NCI).57 Contreras-García et al. introduced a novel NCI function-based RDG that leads to visualization of different kinds of NCI directly.41 The plots of RDG versus electron density ρ(r) multiplied by the sign of the second Hessian eigenvalue λ2 for dyes and I2 are shown in Fig. S3–S5 (ESI†). Fig. 9 presents the optimized molecular structures of dye–I2 complexes and the corresponding interaction energies, in which the binding sites of N, O and S atoms in the organic molecular segment as well as the bridge oxygen (Ob1 and Ob2) and terminal oxygen (Od) in POMs were considered. For the studied dyes, the interaction energies of bridge oxygen atoms in POMs and I2 are much larger than those of other sites, which could lead to the higher I2 concentration in the vicinity of POMs. The distances between the POM and TiO2 surface increase in the following order: dye 3 < dye 2 < dye 1, and thus, the nc of the studied dyes increase in the order dye 3 < dye 2 < dye 1, indicating that the structure types resulting from different positions of POM do exert a significant effect on the charge recombination. Moreover, the largest nc of dye 1 with a D–A–π–A structure implies the least degree of electron recombination between injection electrons and redox couple in the electrolyte, which is beneficial to obtain a higher VOC.

3.4.3. Dye aggregation effects. 
It is well known that dye aggregation effects are disadvantageous to efficient electron injection, and finally decrease VOC. The optimized most stable dimer structures as well as ΔEtot for dyes 1–3 are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). As shown in Table 3, dye 1 with the D–A–π–A configuration exhibits the smallest ΔEtot (−80.63 kcal mol−1) among dyes 1–3 because of the smallest ΔEorb (−35.50 kcal mol−1) and ΔEsteric (−45.13 kcal mol−1), which is beneficial for electron injection. To understand the interaction nature for different aggregation modes, the plots of RDG versus sign(λ)ρ (a.u.) for dye 1–3 dimers were created and shown in Fig. 10. The weak interactions were denoted by spikes with the low-gradient and low-density region near zero, and blue, green and red areas are identified as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and steric repulsions, respectively. Moreover, the gradient isosurfaces with RDG = 0.5 a.u. for dye 1–3 dimers are colored on a blue-green-red scale to better understand the origin of weak interactions. The isosurfaces show that π–π stacking interaction exists in part of the dye 1 and 3 dimers, and extends over the dimer of dye 2. So, the dimer of dye 2 possesses the largest ΔEtot (−125.42 kcal mol−1).

3.5. Interfacial electron transfer analysis
IET simulation from dyes to semiconductor is very important for understanding the performance of DSSCs, and IET should be fast to minimize charge and energy loss. The time-dependent survival probability (TDSP) curves of dyes 1–3 are used to investigate the IET performance, which are illustrated in Fig. 11. It can be seen that the electrons in dye 1 are almost completely injected after 14 fs, while it will take a long time for dyes 2 and 3. Moreover, the evolutions for the injection processes of dyes 1–3 (Fig. 12) show that the excited electrons propagate from dyes to TiO2, and dye 1 with the D–A–π–A configuration can help electron transfer to the semiconducting layer, which is helpful to improve the performance of DSSCs. The results show that dye 1 with the D–A–π–A pattern is favorable for the efficient interfacial injection. In addition, the curve for dye 2 is obviously oscillated after an ultrafast descending process, which is caused by the weak interaction between dye 2 and the TiO2 substrate. The excited electrons on dye 2 cannot be directly injected into the TiO2 slab, and then return to dye 2. The lack of a recombination process of excitons in our simulations artificially induces the occurrence of the periodic oscillation of the injection process.51

4. Conclusions
A series of POM-based dyes with different configurations resulting from different positions of POM inserted in dyes have been comprehensively investigated with DFT and TD-DFT methods. The configuration effects of dyes on the performance of DSSCs were evaluated. JSC and VOC connected with absorption spectra, ICT parameters, electron injection efficiency, ΔECB, charge recombination and dye aggregation effects were analyzed. Moreover, the IET process that was proven to be a crucial factor affecting the performance of DSSCs is taken into consideration. The results revealed that the absorption spectrum of dye 3 with a D–π–A framework red-shifts compared with those of dye 1 with the D–A–π–A structure and dye 2 with the D–π–A–π–A structure, which is helpful to enhance the overlap between the dye's absorption spectra and the solar photo flux spectrum. Moreover, it is found that dye 3 with the D–π–A framework can obtain the largest JSC resulting in the superior ICT parameters and the largest electron injection efficiency. Dye 1 might perform well on VOC because of the smallest ΔECB towards the more negative direction with respect to the pristine CB of TiO2 and the reduced charge recombination as well as dye aggregation processes due to the smallest ΔEtot (−80.63 kcal mol−1) among dyes 1–3. At the same time, the electrons in dye 1 are almost completely injected after 14 fs as obtained by IET simulation, while it takes a long time for dyes 2 and 3, showing that dye 1 is favorable for the efficient interfacial injection from dye to TiO2. Hence, it predicts that the dye with the D–A–π–A structure may bring out the larger sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
