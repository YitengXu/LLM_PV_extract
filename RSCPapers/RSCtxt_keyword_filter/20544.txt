The quest for cost-effective, clean, and renewable energy is of paramount importance, and a rapidly growing, promising approach to address these needs utilizes organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies.1 OPVs offer the attraction of earth-abundant constituents and solution processability compatible with flexible substrates and high throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing.2 To date, OPV research efforts have focused primarily on polymers as the light-harvesting electron donors.3 However, emerging alternatives are solution-processed small-molecule donors, which offer facile synthesis, monodispersity, and easy purification.4 Thus far, the highest reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed small-molecule donors exceed 6%, approaching those of polymer OPVs.5 These rapid advances render this field promising for further investigations aimed at understanding small molecule OPV structure-performance relationships.
Recently we reported the first implementation of a linear NDT core in solution-processable small-molecule bulk-heterojunction OPVs.6,7 The strategy utilizes a weak donor–strong acceptor push–pull approach3a in an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) motif. Flanking the weakly donating NDT core with strongly accepting thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) units yields NDT(TDPP)222 (1). Combining 1 with the PC61BM electron acceptor affords a bulk heterojunction PCE of ∼4%. Nevertheless, the modest device performance of 1-based OPVs and the low synthetic yield of the NDT core-forming ring closure step (14%), prompts additional design investigations.  
Previous results argue that −ΔGCS, the free energy difference between the singlet photoexcited state of the donor material and the charge-separated state, must be sufficiently large to efficiently separate excitons and prevent parasitic geminate electron–hole recombination (eqn (1)):8 ΔGCS = IPD − EAA − Eg,D(1)where, IPD is the ionization potential of the donor material, EAA is the electron affinity of the acceptor material, and Eg,D is the optical bandgap of the donor material.9 Systems with small −ΔGCS tend to have high rates of geminate recombination can compromise charge transport and collection, and therefore reduce the device fill-factor, FF.10 Keeping these issues in mind, a potential strategy to simultaneously increase device JSC and FF would be to increase −ΔGCS by reducing the IPD, while keeping the Eg,D constant. The question therefore arises as to whether this strategy could be applied to TDPP-NDT-TDPP, and whether the aforementioned OPV parameters might be manipulated by modifying the NDT core structure.
Here we report the first synthesis, characterization, and charge transport/OPV characteristics of a “zig-zag” NDT analogue, 4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (zNDT), which substantiates key aspects of this strategy. We reasoned that the more compact π-system and diminished conjugation arising from the nonlinear shape would raise the frontier MOs, making the TDPP-zNDT-TDPP core more electron-rich, potentially increasing hole mobility, while reducing the IPD and thereby increasing −ΔGCS. To synthesize zNDT, 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphthalene-1,5-diyl-bis(2,2-diethoxyethyl)-sulfane was prepared from the 1,5-dibromo analogue (Scheme 1). The succeeding cyclization used polyphosphoric acid as the catalyst, and zNDT was obtained in high yield (75%). Stannylation of zNDT followed by Stille cross-coupling with TDPP-Br affords zNDT(TDPP)2 (2) in 83% yield, which was then characterized by standard methodologies (see ESI†). Advantageously, the cyclization step for zNDT is more efficient than that of NDT due to the occupation of the reactive α-positions, reducing possible side reactions and increasing the synthetic yield 5-fold.

In order to compare the optical and electronic properties of 1 and 2, solution and film optical absorption spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry were carried out (Fig. 1A and B). In CHCl3 solution, both 1 and 2 exhibit λmax = 623 nm and λonset = 671 nm. In the solid-state, both molecules exhibit a strongly red-shifted absorption with λonset = 730 and 732 nm for 1 and 2, respectively, corresponding to an optical bandgap, Eg,D = 1.70 eV. Cyclic voltammetry in CH2Cl2 solution reveals a quasi-reversible oxidation wave and irreversible and quasi-reversible reduction waves for 1 and 2, respectively, with onsets (vs. Fc/Fc+, E1/2 = +0.389 V) of +0.331 and −1.279 V, and +0.231 and −1.489 V, respectively, corresponding to IP and EA energies of 5.21 and −3.60 eV vs. 5.11 and −3.39 eV. These results show that the present modification of the NDT core does, in fact, reduce the IPD while keeping Eg,D constant. Using an EA for PC61BM of 3.9 eV11 and the present measured IPD and Eg,D values, −ΔGCS for 1:PC61BM is 0.39 eV, while −ΔGCS for 2:PC61BM is 0.49 eV. Table 1 summarizes the thin-film optical absorption and cyclic voltammetry results for 1 and 2.

To assess the effect of the reduced IPD and increased −ΔGCS on OPV device response, illuminated current density vs. voltage (J–V) measurements on 1 and 2 were carried out on devices utilizing the conventional architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1 or 2:PC61BM/LiF/Al. Fig. 1C and D show the OPV illuminated J–V and external quantum efficiency (EQE) response of the optimized blend ratios of 1 or 2 with PC61BM and Table 1 summarizes PV data (see ESI† for OPV optimization method and corresponding AFM images). Noticeably, the open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1 is 89 mV greater than that of 2, which is in accord with the higher IPD of 112 and, intriguingly the JSC, FF, and PCE of the 2-based OPV is larger by 5, 17, and 10%, respectively. The increased JSC of 2 tracks the higher EQE (Fig. 1D) and after integrating the EQE spectra, the calculated JSC is within the estimated 3% uncertainty of the measured JSC. The ESI† displays the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the optimized blend films of 1 and 2 with PC61BM and both reveal smooth films with RMS roughnesses <0.7 nm. These results suggest that the larger −ΔGCS substantially influences OPV performance for these small molecule donor materials, as evidenced by the larger JSC and PCE.
To better understand how modification of the NDT core structure affects the transport properties of 1 and 2, organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and hole-only diodes were fabricated to extract the field effect and space-charge-limiting current SCLC plots of 1 and 2 for the OFET and hole-only devices, respectively (Fig. 2). Noticeably, for both configurations, the hole mobility of 2 (μFET = 0.057 cm2 V−1 s−1; μSCLC = 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is greater than that of 1 (μFET = 0.046 cm2 V−1 s−1; μSCLC = 2.5 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). The greater hole mobility of 2 is consistent with the higher JSC observed for the OPV devices. Moreover, a higher donor material hole mobility allows holes to be collected more quickly, thereby reducing the rate of competing non-geminate recombination and enhancing the FF. In fact, when OFETs are fabricated with a blend of 1 or 2 + PC61BM, μFET remains nearly constant for 2:PC61BM (0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1), but drops precipitously for 1:PC61BM (0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1; see ESI†), arguing that the enhanced 2:PC61BM FF is related to the increased hole mobility. A summary of the OFET and hole-only diode data can be found in the ESI.†

The present results show that “zig-zag” modification of the NDT architecture in zNDT, with strongly electron-withdrawing TDPP substituents, offers a promising BHJ OPV donor motif. Facile 4,9-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene ring closure affords 2 in high synthetic yields, and the angular geometry alters the electronic structure to appreciably raise the energy levels vs. linear NDT and provides high hole mobility. While the lower zNDT IPD predictably reduces the device VOCvs. linear NDT, all other OPV parameters, including JSC, FF, and PCE are significantly enhanced. It is suggested that the larger −ΔGCS (0.39 vs. 0.49 eV) and hole mobility leads to more efficient charge separation and less recombination, consistent with the increased JSC and FF. Additional experiments are underway to better understand the relationship between −ΔGCS and structure/device relationships for small molecule donor materials. These conclusions suggest guiding principles for designing new, efficient donor small molecules.
