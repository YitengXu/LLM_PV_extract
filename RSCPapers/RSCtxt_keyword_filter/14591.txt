    , Accepted 10th June 2021First published on 22nd June 2021AbstractIn this paper, the power-to-methanol chain is reviewed from a process system engineering perspective with detailed assessments of major technologies. The evaluation encompasses electrolysis technologies and catalyst developments, kinetics, reactor technology options for methanol synthesis, as well as their design principles, modelling techniques, and research and optimisation gaps. The review extends to discuss process synthesis considering water-based and co-electrolysis-based power-to-methanol routes with reference to process integration, optimisation, modelling techniques, industrial applications and the associated techno-economics. Key gaps and opportunities for improvements are identified. The novelty of the paper lies in the holistic evaluation of technology design, performance and modelling. Foremost among the findings, advanced and detailed models of the electrolysis units, methanol reaction kinetics (e.g. considering identifiability and sensitivity) and methanol reactor with improved predictive capabilities under varying conditions are required. Additionally, the overall design, flexibility and reliability requirements concerning variable power-to-methanol deserve further detailed investigation. On the other hand, studies on the model-based process synthesis of power-to-methanol are limited, especially those considering dynamic modelling, multi-objective, process configuration and scheduling optimisations, and techno-economic and environmental analyses under uncertainty conditions. The few model-based studies available are mostly based on deterministic approaches and sequential pinch-analysis. Furthermore, limited studies evaluate power-to-methanol in the context of CO2/energy/H2 utilisation industrial hubs and repurposing/retrofitting of existing infrastructures (with part of the capital cost already offset) taking advantages of synergies and application-specific analysis of methanol, which may give additional attractive business cases. Lastly, incentives and dynamics in renewable electricity, electrolysis, CO2 utilisation and the methanol market hold a strong position to make power-to-methanol feasible and must be investigated further to support policy decisions.
1. Introduction
Worldwide, there exists an urgent need to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel resources as a result of the environmental issues related to its processing, i.e. substantial CO2 and SOx emissions, particulate emissions and water pollution. Greener and renewable alternatives have been sought and proposed as solutions to mitigate the dependency on fossil fuels as resources of energy and chemical/fuel products. In the pool of renewable alternatives, solar and wind energy generators are more advanced and have great potential to widely penetrate the market in the near to longer term.1–3 Their scalability and significant CO2 reduction potential stands out.4 However, three challenges arise with the adoption of solar and wind, i.e. (i) bridging the gap between energy supply and demand posed by resource intermittencies; (ii) coupling CO2 recycling with solar and wind energy; and (iii) achieving an effective reduction of CO2 across all energy-utilising and chemical-dependent sectors using solar and wind. These challenges are interlinked with opportunities presented by carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies, as well as the agenda for the future sustainable supply of energy and chemicals. The pivotal solution to mitigate these challenges is energy storage, and the term corresponding to this capability has been coined as ‘sector coupling’.5
Chemical energy storage has great potential due to the higher energy density, as well as the dual benefit for effective CO2 reduction across multiple fossil fuel-dependent sectors. This sustainably bridges the gap between energy supply and demand over extended periods and provides a method of producing carbon-based fuels using non-fossil carbon sources (waste CO2). Chemical energy storage is achievable by storing power (e.g. excess power from variable sources) in the form of energy-dense liquids that are easy to handle (compared to gaseous alternatives, i.e. power-to-gas), hence the term power-to-liquids. In this case, power-to-methanol is considered as one of the attractive options.6 Methanol is versatile as a chemical, energy carrier and intermediate feedstock for other value-added fuels and chemicals (e.g. dimethyl-ether).6 Methanol has favourable attributes such as its ease of handling, existing industrial infrastructure, lower pollutant emissions upon combustion, higher stoichiometric CO2 utilisation rate compared to methane, and the emergence of technologies such as methanol fuel cells that increase its potential utilisation.7,8 The adoption of a green methanol economy can assist in bypassing numerous challenges associated with green hydrogen economy (e.g. its handling and storage, transportation difficulties and low volumetric density).9 However, the full potential of methanol has not yet been leveraged, at least industrially. A huge cross-sectoral market can be created through a methanol economy at reasonable cost.6
Several review papers in the context of renewable power-to-methanol (PtMeOH) are available in literature.10–12 This process is sometimes referred to in literature as ‘green methanol production’. In this review paper, we offer the most critical and relevant research improvements and gaps in the topic of renewable PtMeOH chain from a process system engineering perspective. The paper considers the process performance, relevant technologies (electrolysers, CO2 capture, catalysts and reactors), their design principles, modelling and overall process integration and optimisation, and methods and the techno-economics. The paper compares the performance of two prominent power-to-methanol routes i.e. co-electrolysis and pure steam electrolysis (with subsequent direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol). The review extensively captures the highlighted subcomponents and it is distinct from other recently published review papers in that it provides a thorough and holistic analysis of technology design, performance and modelling, encompassing aspects such as kinetics, electrolysis and reactor design principles and modelling (steady state and dynamic), process integration and optimisation and the associated gaps, all which, according to the authors' knowledge, have not been recently reviewed, particularly in the context of renewable power-to-methanol. Critical research directions in the area of PtMeOH for CO2 utilisation and the storage of renewable energy are discussed. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the number of relevant papers considered in this study per year.

The review is structured as follows: Section 2 gives a broad overview of the PtMeOH process performance and the associated technologies. Section 3 presents the state-of-the-art of electrolysis technologies, design practices, and modelling and optimisation gaps. Section 4 briefly evaluates the CO2 sources, the associated capture technologies, synergistic aspects with renewable powered-electrolysis, and highlights the flexibility requirements in the capture technology. Section 5 discusses catalysts and reactors for methanol synthesis, and extends to kinetics, reactor design and modelling techniques and opportunities for further optimisation. Section 6 presents the state-of-the-art of process synthesis in PtMeOH with reference to process integration, optimisation, modelling techniques and the associated techno-economics, environmental and incentives analysis. Section 7 concludes the review paper and highlights opportunities for innovation in the PtMeOH technology chain.
2. Power-to-methanol: overview
The storage of renewable power in methanol – produced via hydrogen (or syngas) from electrolysis and waste CO2 as inputs – has been studied (Table 1) and its process performance recently demonstrated.13 The Carbon Recycling Institute (CRI)'s George Olah plant, Mitsui Chemicals in Japan and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe GmbH (MHPSE) have demonstrated PtMeOH process.11,14–17 This section gives a broad overview of the PtMeOH process performance, associated technologies and their limitations; and henceforth lays a foundation for subsequent sections. The production of green methanol from solar and wind consists of four main steps: a source of renewable energy, the production of H2 (electrolysis) or syngas (co-electrolysis), a CO2 source, methanol synthesis and purification. Fig. 2 shows technologies associated with each step and typical applications of methanol. For the synthesis reaction(s), a sustainable source of the CO2 as a feed is required. The sources of CO2 and associated capture technologies are vast; and as a result they are only briefly evaluated in this review paper.3,12 Electricity and heat production processes are the biggest global CO2 emitters (42%).12 Detailed analysis of energy (electricity and heat) sources is beyond the scope of this review. However, variable solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind were demonstrated to be the attractive sources of power for the PtMeOH process, more especially from an environmental perspective.3,18

2.1 Process performance assessment
Methanol can either be produced from syngas or the direct hydrogenation of CO2. As a result, the PtMeOH process can be divided into two main process routes: (i) H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis derived syngas to methanol (coSyn-MeOH); and (ii) steam electrolysis derived hydrogen to methanol (via the direct CO2 hydrogenation route: dCO2-MeOH). The other route is the two-step process in which H2 production via steam electrolysis is coupled with reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) to produce syngas followed by methanol synthesis.
Conventional methanol production processes were designed primarily based on economics, thermodynamics, reactions and separations efficiencies. However, with the involvement of fluctuating renewable energy supply, stabilisation of the energy input(s) and synthesis reactor feed composition becomes one of the key tasks within the process. To stabilise the input power, correct rectification (e.g. transistor-based rectifiers), a battery system or additional stable renewable source such as biomass can be used,19–21 whereas to stabilise the feed composition, hydrogen storage tanks (or in case of syngas – a conditioning reactor) are used if justifiable by efficiency and economics. System partitioning and part load operation are also possible.19,20,22
To evaluate the process performance, energy efficiency and economics are the most commonly used criteria in literature.2,23,24 Analyses of studies in Table 1 show that recent interest is directed to dCO2-MeOH,9,14,15,25–30 but few consider the coSyn-MeOH route.4,31,32 This is justifiable since the dCO2-MeOH process, when optimised, will allow large utilisation of CO2, and it is characterised by less by-product formation and low hot spot formation within the reactor; thus slightly simplifying the process compared to that based on syngas-to-methanol.33–35 However, the dCO2-MeOH process has its downsides such as the higher hydrogen requirements (CO2:H2 = 1:3 or 1:2.5–5 can be optimum36–38); thus increasing the size of the electrolysis unit and the energy requirements. Conventional grid, solar PV and wind are mostly considered as energy sources.2,3,28,29 Studies by Andika et al.28 and Bos et al.39 pointed to the potential revenue addition achieved by adding the PtMeOH process and its pivotal role in the energy storage system for an isolated 100% renewable (respectively, solar and wind) energy system. Some studies also evaluate potential use of hydroelectric power and geothermal as energy sources in the PtMeOH chain.14,15,29 Due to their unique characteristics, each of renewable energy sources has a different influence on the number of operating hours of the plant, production capacity, energy efficiency and the selling price of methanol in different geographic regions.2,27,29
The energy efficiency of the PtMeOH process depends mainly on the operating point of the integrated electrolyser, the exergy destruction due to chemical reaction(s) and associated cooling requirements, system-level heat integration potential, waste heat recovery from external processes, the intensity of the renewable solar source and/or the CO2 capture method (e.g. sorbent working capacity).2,24,31,32,39,40 From rigorous analysis of the data in Table 1, the overall energy efficiency of the PtMeOH process is in the range of 39 to 80%.24,39,41
The overall process energy efficiency strongly depends on the technologies used in the process chain,23 most importantly the electrolyser. Low temperature electrolysis, i.e. alkaline water electrolysis (AWE)4,27,29 and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis2,25,28 are the most investigated technologies in the power-to-methanol process chain. Recent efforts are directed towards high temperature solid oxide electrolyser (SOEC)9,24,25 and reversible solid oxide cells (ReSOC).30,42 The overall energy efficiency is higher for co-electrolysis-based syngas-to-methanol processes (40–80%) than direct CO2 hydrogenation (39–75%).4,24,36,43
The upper energy efficiency ranges represent SOEC-based processes, while the middle to lower ranges pertain to PEM- and AWE-based processes (both PEM and AWE are applied only in the direct CO2 hydrogenation route).4,24,36,43
On the other hand, reactor conversion efficiencies are higher for the syngas-to-methanol reaction than direct CO2 conversion to methanol,44 thus larger reactors are required for CO2 hydrogenation in the case of fixed bed reactors to enhance conversion. However, this strongly depends on the type of reactor used and the pressure and temperature conditions. Léonard et al.32 and Bos and Brilman45 demonstrated that using a reactor with a condensation step to separate water and methanol from the CO2/H2 reaction system can increase conversion efficiency to 99.5%, which is near full conversion at 250 °C and 50 bar.
Other authors such as Kiss et al.46 and Khunathorncharoenwong et al.47 proposed the use of a stripping unit and an alcohol (in their case ethanol)-assisted reaction, respectively, to enhance the CO2 conversion efficiency. The alcohol-assisted process increased the single pass conversion efficiency and reduced hydrogen compression (by 25%) since a fraction of H2 was generated in situ from ethanol dehydration, for example. However, it rendered the methanol separation step complex and energy intensive (up to 88–96% of the total duties) due to the formation of methanol by-products (azeotropes).
2.2 Current process limitations
The analysis of PtMeOH process studies and technologies paves the way to understanding the critical bottlenecks within the process and ultimately the areas for process improvement. The key bottlenecks highlighted in most studies are associated with the cost of electricity, the electrolyser system, methanol synthesis reactor conversion and energy consumption by auxiliaries.9 In addition to these, are the associated energy efficiency, selling price of methanol, CO2 capture and purification costs, and the number and cost of heat exchangers and compression units. Although diverse scenarios are observed in different geographic locations and for various renewable energies, in general, the PtMeOH process is currently not economically feasible in most regions except for countries with cheap/free renewable energy and carbon tax higher than 100 € per ton of CO2 (e.g. Sweden with carbon tax of 110 € per ton CO2).4,9,14,25,26,28,29,48–50 Elaborate techno-economic, environmental and incentives analyses of the encompassing PtMeOH processes are deferred to Section 5.4 of this review.
In addition to the above-mentioned challenges, other limitations exist that are worth highlighting before assessing power-to-methanol technologies. Some are well known and mostly related to electrolysis and methanol synthesis. These limitations are divided into elementary and complex constraints, as presented in Table 2. Elementary limitations refer to fundamental challenges such as those associated with catalytic materials, among others. Complex limitations comprise constraints that cannot be a product of a single step/unit or phenomenon, but as a result of the interplay of multiple steps or factors. Attempts to solve these limitations, summarised in Table 2, will be discussed in the subsequent sections, per technology and process layout or design.

3. Electrolysis technologies
Hydrogen and/or syngas are vital components for the methanol process chain with significant impact on the economics. Thus, it is fitting to analyse the state of the art of renewable hydrogen production technologies from the perspective of their potential as candidates for integration with variable solar and wind energy sources.51,52 These technologies are based on the perennial method termed ‘water electrolysis’. Several good review articles on electrolysis technologies are available in literature such as Olivier et al.,53 Ursua et al.,54 Jensen et al.,55 Stolten and Krieg,56 Zeng and Zhang,57 Carmo et al.,58 Hansen,59 Ebbesen et al.60 and Laguna-Bercero61 and more recently Roode-Gutzmer et al.,12 Brauns and Turek,52 Venkataraman et al.,62 Küngas,63 Kumar and Himabindu,64 Falcão and Pinto,65 Andika et al.66 and Wirkert et al.67 This section extends to discuss key design practices, modelling and optimisation gaps pertaining the electrolysis technologies, particularly based on solid oxide cells. Recent reviews that focus on the design and modelling of alkaline water-based electrolysers (AWE)52,53 and polymer exchange membrane (PEM)53,65,67 electrolysers are available in the literature; thus this section comprehensively assess AWE, PEM and solid oxide electrolyser design, modelling and optimisation.
3.1 State-of-the-art and research and development activities
Electrolysis of water may occur at low (20–80 °C) or high temperatures (500–950 °C).64 Low-temperature electrolysis technologies are typically alkaline-based electrolysis and PEM electrolysis, which are both available commercially.52,64,68 The less mature technologies are high-temperature solid oxide electrolyser cells (HT-SOEC) and the so-called reversible solid oxide cell with the capability to switch between electrolysis and fuel cell mode when needed.51,62,67,69
In modern electrolysis technologies, the co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O are possible at the high temperature range (typically in the range of 800–850 °C) currently permitted by solid oxide cells.63,66,70 However, reaction mechanisms are complex and not fully understood.70 In addition, an undesirable solid carbon formation reaction via Boudouard reaction may occur during co-electrolysis depending on the applied conditions.70 This exothermic reaction is important for consideration during design and typically an O/C ratio greater than 1.5 must be maintained to suppress it. The electrolysis process is an endothermic and non-spontaneous chemical reaction.53 Technologies such as SOEC can also operate at peculiar conditions of thermoneutral voltage in which overpotential irreversibility (that becomes heat) balances the endothermic electrolysis enthalpy of reaction.54 Increasing the temperature decreases electrical energy, but increases the thermal energy. Table 3 gives a performance comparison of the electrolyser technologies, and a summary of their research and development status.

3.1.1 Alkaline water electrolysers. 
Alkaline water-based electrolysers (AWE) are based on an electrolyte (typically KOH/NaOH) that provides hydroxyl (OH−) anion transfer between the two electrodes of the electrolyser. The main advantages of alkaline electrolysis technologies are their low annual maintenance cost, and long operation lifetime/durability (30 years) and reliability under fixed (continuous) operation conditions.52 Although AWE has long been commercialised and is cheaper than other electrolysis technologies, it is still expensive relative to the fossil fuel-based hydrogen production technologies and less efficient (due to high parasitic current losses). On the other hand, it is currently not considered a good candidate for integration with intermittent energy sources due to its low part-load range (10–25% of the nominal load) as gas contamination (H2 in O2) increases with the decrease in power availability, long cold start (>30 minutes) and warm start times.20,52,71 A significant decrease in the faradaic efficiency is present below a current density of 50–100 mA cm−2 for the AWE.52,72 Research and development on AWE technology is currently focused on making the technology more efficient and cost effective, by modifying it to operate at higher temperatures, current density (>500 mA cm−2) and pressures, and highly dynamic conditions.52,68


3.1.2 Polymer-exchange membrane electrolysers. 
Polymer-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers contain a proton (H+)-conductive membrane within its membrane electrode assembly to allow proton transfer, but inhibit gas diffusion between the two electrode sides of the electrolyser.64 Some features of PEM are now reported.73–75 This is a mature technology at the 1–5 MW scale. It offers the following: high purity gas delivery (99.999%), high compactness, commercial operation at up to 3.0 A cm−2, demonstration of performance on laboratory scale at 10 A cm−2, high energy efficiency (70–80% higher heating value at 1 A cm−2), depending on the operating current density and temperature, and durability of continuous operation (>60000 h). Systems with increased capacities are becoming commercially available (systems of up to 7–10 MW are now available on the market and development of up to 100 MW is underway). Further features include excellent flexibility and reactivity at system level for operation with transient power sources, and operation under pressure (200 bar demonstrated, 350 bar prototypes).
PEM electrolysers are well adapted to operate under intermittent renewable supply with an extended load flexibility (0–160%) range and fast cold start time (<10 minutes). This technology is relatively expensive, primarily due to its use of precious metals (e.g. Pt, Ru and Ir) as electro-catalysts. Research and development (R&D) activities on these electrolysers are focused on the development of cheaper catalyst materials or reducing the content of the precious materials, particularly iridium (from ∼0.5 g-Ir kW−1 to 0.01 g-Ir kW−1) and platinum (<0.01 g-Pt kW−1), cheaper current collector and separator plate coating materials, and more durable membranes that are capable of operating at higher current densities (>3 A cm−2).64,73,74 Besides, increasing the operating pressure could lower downstream H2 compression costs.47 However, a 10% decrease in the faradaic efficiency of the PEM cell with an increase in pressure (20 to 130 bar) was reported by Grigoriev et al.75


3.1.3 High-temperature solid oxide electrolyser and reversible solid oxide cells. 
Increasing the operating temperature of the SOEC electrolyser improves chemical kinetics, the oxygen (O2−) ion or proton (H+) conduction of the ceramic electrolyte, and the thermodynamics and efficiency.67,68,74 Thus, the SOEC operating temperature is within the range of 750–950 °C and is therefore referred to as high-temperature solid oxide electrolyser (HT-SOEC). The HT-SOEC technology can also be designed to operate in reverse (fuel cell) mode (i.e. ReSOC).62 HT-SOEC is a promising breakthrough technology and, as a result, like PEM electrolysis and AWE, it also benefits from decreasing capital costs.12,76 However, it is still currently expensive (with a projected cost >2800 € per kW) than PEM electrolysis and AWE, and potentially less flexible (in terms of start-up and load) than PEM electrolysis.12,76 The key advantages of HT-SOEC include the ability to perform co-electrolysis reaction (i.e. syngas is produced and water is consumed within the electrolyser), which eliminates the need for the water-gas-shift-reactors with associated challenge of water formation. Unlike HT-SOEC, in the case where syngas is produced using the reverse water–gas-shift-reactor, water needs to be subsequently separated before the reactants are fed to the methanol synthesis reactor. Other advantages of HT-SOEC include the use of non-noble electro-catalysts materials, less electricity input requirements, high faradaic efficiency (100%) and energy efficiency (79–96%) compared to AWE and PEM electrolysers.11,64,66–68,76–80 The SOEC produces 30% more products at the same electric input (e.g. ≤3.7 kW h NmH2−3) compared to PEM and AWE technologies.76
The HT-SOECs are currently in the development stage and entry level of the commercial market, with Sunfire and several other companies and research institutions pursuing work on the development of SOEC technologies.76 The ReSOC is still at a very early stage of development (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3–4).62,81,82,84 However, due to its flexible dual capability and scalability, the ReSOC is attractive for distributed microgrid application in the context of power to methanol to power and for standalone systems with co-generation (methanol and electricity as end products guided by demand and pricing structures).62,84,85 The ReSOC has been demonstrated by Sunfire considering H2 as the energy carrier instead of methanol.62,76,86 The ReSOC can maintain high efficiency even at a part-load of 15% of the rated capacity.85
From a material perspective, high-temperature sealing materials for high-pressure operation, improving the durability and medium temperature (500–750 °C) conductivity of the electrolyte and electrodes material, novel fabrication methods, advanced models and analysis of degradation mechanisms, and the understanding of co-electrolysis reaction mechanisms are key areas of R&D.67,69,70,87 For its integration with variable renewable energy sources, SOEC and ReSOC technologies will benefit greatly from shorter cold start-up times, more durable ceramics, which are more resistant to pressure fluctuations, gas cross-over and thermal stresses, and mass production and automation to reduce cost.51,67,85
In addition, advancing SOEC and ReSOC technology towards a sector-coupling solution is still required. Section 3.2 evaluates the equipment design, modelling and optimisation activities and gaps for the SOEC technology, with a few highlights of ReSOC.

3.2 Equipment design and modelling
The work on AWE, PEM, SOEC design evaluated herein is focused on three key design principles: reducing capital and operating costs, increasing stack lifetime/durability, and increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the technologies. Furthermore, progress and gaps in model developments for each technology are assessed.

3.2.1 Design and modelling of the AWE. 
3.2.1.1 Reducing the capital and operating costs. 
Cell design configuration in the AWE technology can be categorized into two prominent types being (i) the monopolar and the (ii) bipolar cell design. Monopolar configurations are primarily based on parallel cell configuration while the most used bipolar configurations are based on series/accumulation connections, electrically and geometrically.88,89 Bipolar configurations are more compact than monopolar, thus giving shorter paths for electrical current and thereby reducing losses such as ohmic losses.89 However, bipolar cell configurations are characterised by parasitic currents and high manufacturing costs.89 Nonetheless, owing to the use of non-noble metals, the capital cost of AWE is relatively cheaper ($800–$1500 kW−1). Although the capital cost of the AWE system can still be reduced further to <$500 kW−1 by novel cell designs to achieve higher current density/minimum area resistance, optimised manufacturing techniques and making the technology more compact, production cost (>$4 per kg per H2) dominates the total cost of the AWE system.90 From an operation perspective, to maintain system integrity, it is crucial to balance the pressure between the hydrogen and oxygen side.91 The energy to drive the reaction at cell level dominates the overall electrical energy demand of the AWE system.90 One key strategy, currently under investigation, to reduce the hydrogen production costs concerning the use of AWE is to modify the electrolysis operating conditions. State of the art AWE are operated at low temperatures (see Table 3). The heat capacity of the KOH solution, which is a function of KOH concentration and temperature, has a strong effect on the energy consumption and the production cost.90 Holm et al.90 assessed the economic feasibility of high temperature and high pressure (200 bar) liquid-phase operation of the AWE. The authors further deduced that the energy consumption of the AWE decreases from 74.1 kW per h per kg per H2 at 25 °C to a minimum of 55.4 kW per h per kg per H2 at 287 °C (above this temperature, the energy consumption increases). However, the authors assumed a constant resistivity at temperature above 286 °C and hence the validity and effect of this assumption must be explored further with experiments. On the other hand, the change in vapor pressure with temperature result into a higher cost of recycling heat from the output stream of the AWE system and hence higher production cost.90 The authors deduced that an optimal range corresponding to higher temperature liquid-phase operation is 270–310 °C, which emanates from consideration of trade-offs between the cell efficiency improvement and the potential of increasing energy/production cost as a consequence of increasing temperature.90 However, subject to feasible pressure operation window, the optimal temperature range can still be pushed higher or lower. High pressure operation is also known to be associated with increase in capital cost and raises safety concerns in the AWE system due to an increased potential of gas cross-over and hence dangerous mixing of H2 and O2. To make high pressure operation feasible considering safety, highly stable separators with low ionic resistivity are required. The energy consumption can also be reduced by about 22% if excellent AWE electrocatalysts, able to achieve good activation energy and charge transfer close to a unity are developed.
3.2.1.2 Increasing the lifetime and durability. 
Although, the AWE technology is characterised by long term stability and low degradation, the presence of KOH creates a detrimental corrosive environment to the AWE materials. The current state-of-the-art zirconium dioxide- and polysulfonate-based separator materials can degrade and dissolve under alkaline solution. Currently, the duration of the catalyst used in the AWE technology is about 40000 h. Increasing the duration of the catalyst reduces the replacement cost. Targets are looking at improving the duration of the catalyst by e.g. doubling it to 80000 h and to current density of 2000 mA cm−2.90 AWE technology with nickel-based electrodes and Zirfon-based separator have also been tested for dynamic (intermittent) operation conditions for a total duration of about 13000 h and showed no severe degradation in the cell and its components. However, more testing under dynamic conditions are required to ascertain the absence of severe degradation using nickel hydrides and hydrogen embrittlement as indicators. On the other hand, research focusing on increasing the temperature of the AWE have pointed a potential increase in degradation of the brittle ceramics and/or nickel-based cell for temperatures exceeding 200 °C. Nonetheless, materials such as palladium are also promising candidates. However, more research is needed in this direction concerning stress tests and degradation and associated cost trade-offs at varying conditions e.g. input current density and temperature.
3.2.1.3 Increasing efficiency and flexibility. 
AWE is characterised by low efficiency and low flexibility. The presence of hydrogen bubbles and their flow over the AWE electrodes has been discussed as a key factor affecting the efficiency and choice of design parameters of the AWE.91 From a first principles perspective, this is so because the hydrogen bubbles tend to influence the energy and mass transfer in the gas electrodes, and as the coverage of the electrode by hydrogen bubbles increase, the electrolysis efficiency decreases.91 Hydrogen molecules can be transferred to the liquid electrolyte and the mechanism is generally referred to as the ionic transfer mechanism which can occur via migration, convection and diffusion.91 Design configurations such as the zero-gap combined with modern Zirfon diaphragms are aimed at increasing the efficiency of the AWE by reducing the area resistance. However, they still have their own challenges, such as high ohmic resistance, uneven current distribution, and lack of experimental data and detailed understanding.92 On the other hand, high temperature liquid-phase operation can enhance the efficiency of the AWE, but this design strategy tends to affect the feasible operation pressure window of the system due to difficulties in managing the equilibrium pressure of water at higher temperatures and hence increases the cost, as previously dicussed.90 Direct high pressure operation of the AWE has also been discussed as a potential design strategy for enhancing the energy efficiency of the AWE system, however this strategy will require modifications in cell design taking into considerations safety aspects. The other strategy for improving the energy efficiency concerns the improvement in the catalyst used in the AWE system. On the other hand, although alkaline electrolysis are simple to scale and have been used commercially for more than 10 years, they exhibit low flexibility in terms of part-load operation as highlighted in Section 3.1.1 above. Due to low flexibility (low partial load range) and challenges with handling intermittent supply, good rectification and buffer storage of dynamic electricity input is required. With the addition of rectifiers and buffer storage such as batteries, the energy efficiency penalties were observed, even though the hydrogen production increase with, for example, efficient rectifiers under dynamic operating conditions.93 Additionally, the latter technologies increase the system costs. Thus improving the capability of flexible operation of AWE will play a pivotal role. Currently, ionic conduction and gas impurities (typical to form at part-load) limits the fast response and part-load operation (10 to 15%) of the AWE. Alternatively, a small electrolyser size will give higher operation hours.94 Ultimately, novel cell design (e.g. self-repairing electrodes) and operation strategies (e.g. variation of operating pressure, temperature with load) will make AWE more flexible.
3.2.1.4 Modeling of the AWE. 
Models are critical tools for cell and system designs, and for predicting beyond what is experimentally feasible.95 Modeling of the AWE has been done extensively in literature and some of the developed models, their multi-physics (i.e. thermal behavior, cell voltage, gas purities, current, gas evolution and resistivity) and diagnostics analysis have been validated experimentally under steady-state and unsteady conditions.88,96–100 However, this is still an open research field. Table 4 summarizes the models concerning the AWE. AWE models have also been validated under dynamic conditions and shown to have a reasonable error of about 3%.101 A recent study by Avci et al.91 assessed the two-phase flow and hydrogen gas flow dynamics within the alkaline-water-based electrolysis technology using a physical model. The authors studied the effect of void fraction, bubble diameter and the velocity of the bubble. Due to existence of multi-phase flow, the model can be complex and thus often requires assumptions, such as homogeneous equilibrium flow, for simplification. Limited studies are focused on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of the AWE to describe its multi-physics (e.g. gas and liquid transport, the electrical current conservation, the flow velocity profile, gas hold-up, etc.).95,97,102 Using CFD, a good approximation of performance can be made by considering just 2D models.95 Opportunities for improving AWE models exists, such as extending the validity range of the empirical models with further experimentations. It is evident from the analysis of Table 4 that more work can be done to simplify and improve accuracy of the models e.g. in voltage, activation overpotentials, mass and heat transfers and product gas purity predictions taking into account various interplaying factors, and incorporating geometries of the cells and experimental derived charge transfer coefficient.95,104 Limited models are developed considering multi-scales e.g. atomic to electrode to cell-levels and degradation. In June 2020, VoltaChem and TNO105 announced their ambition to develop an advanced degradation model for the AWE technology. The majority of the models are aimed at estimating the size, electricity utilization rate, cost and efficiency of the technology with the aim to assess its role in the overall system concerned.89,94,106 Thus more research work is needed to enhance the AWE models.

3.2.2 Design and modelling of the PEM. 
3.2.2.1 Reducing the capital and operating costs. 
The design of the PEM features bipolar plate configurations. Unlike AWE, operation of PEM under balanced and unbalanced pressure conditions is possible. PEM is characterised by potential of compact stack design. Even so, PEM has higher system cost. About 50% or more of the PEM system cost corresponds to balance of plant (BOP) equipment. This is so since PEM requires serious control and management. While approximately 15–26% and 14% are contributed by the membrane electrode assembly cost for the total cost capital of the stack and system, respectively.118 Increasing the power or size of the system and optimising manufacturing methods (ease of scaling up the production rate, particularly the electrodes) can reduce the cost of the PEM technology. On the other hand, a large current density may also be critical to reduce the cost associated with BOP. Once the technology is at the level of economy of scale, the high cost will shift to membrane electrode assembly. For the latter, reducing the noble metals especially Ir catalyst loading in the PEM will reduce the capital cost significantly.119 The price of Ir has increased to more than double in the last decade.118,119 Kibsgaard & Chorkendorff119 recently evaluated the limiting factors and potentials for scale up of the PEM technology catalysts. Ir is a serious limiting factor in scaling up (thus taking advantage of economies of scale to reduce capital) of the PEM technology since Ir is normally produced at <10 tonnes per year and hence it would require roughly 40 years of Ir production to achieve 1TWH2 production industry using PEM technology.118,119 Furthermore, the Ir-based oxygen-evolution reaction side tends to have strong effect on efficiency (hence production costs) due to its higher overpotential. On the other hand, platinum (Pt)-based cathode is used in the PEM, even though Pt is a noble metal with numerous competitive uses and hence its use in PEM has to be reduced; it can be easily scaled to 1TWH2 production levels. On the other hand, the none-noble catalysts such as phosphides-based catalysts are promising candidates to replace Pt, but they require higher loading to be able to achieve an equivalent performance as Pt-based cathodes, and this may be less economically attractive in the long run.119 How the none-noble catalysts influences the compactness of the technology remains an open research question. In the short term, to accelerate the widespread adoption of PEM, reduction of Ir by novel and easy-to-scale electrode manufacturing techniques will play a bigger role in reducing the capital cost. Ultimately, the improvements in designing highly active and stable none-noble catalysts for PEM will have a stronger effect on reducing its capital and production costs. Relatively, the capital cost reduction will play a big role in the adoption of PEM electrolyser in particular if it can be achieved while keeping almost the equivalent performance as the current state of the art technologies.118 Nonetheless, other strategies are devoted to reducing the production costs of the technology and encompasses modifying its operating conditions such as increasing the temperature and pressure (i.e. the so called-high temperature (HT-PEM) and high pressure PEM (HP-PEM)). Additionally, the costs of hydrogen production using PEM like other electrolysis technologies will inevitably be reduced with availability of low cost electricity and changes in electricity (e.g. ancillary participation) and hydrogen markets.
3.2.2.2 Increasing the lifetime/durability. 
PEM technology has low durability compared to AWE. The acidic environment tend to reduce the stability of the metal and has been a major bottleneck hindering the potential use of non-noble metals in the PEM technology.120 Currently, PEM technologies demand extensive control and management to also prevent Nafion® membrane fouling and degradation.121 Ir is also not stable in the oxygen evolution reaction.119 Improvement in durability will greatly reduce the stack replacement costs.118 More work is needed to increase the durability of the PEM, including finding corrosion resistant separator plates and current collectors, and research investigation must keep track of changes in durability with changes in loading of the Ir and Pt, particularly under intermittent conditions.
3.2.2.3 Increasing efficiency and flexibility. 
Although many factors (e.g. the combination of electricity sources) are at play influencing the efficiency of the PEM, developing improved catalysts materials with capability of breaking the scaling relations (i.e. linear relationship between the binding energy of the intermediates) for the oxygen evolution reaction side will pay a great deal by reducing overpotential and as a consequence improve the efficiency of the technology. Concerning flexibility, low temperature (LT-PEM) PEM has shorter start-up and shut down times and hence a relatively higher flexibility. A recent study by Schnuelle et al.94 compared performance of the PEM and AWE technologies under dynamic conditions, taking into account their flexibility and hydrogen production. Their results showed that although PEM has a higher flexibility, the hydrogen production rate for this technology may be lower depending on the electricity source and efficiency. The findings from these authors show that the advantageous flexibility of the PEM, though very important, cannot be treated in a manner to suggest that PEM is an all-round solution for application in variable renewable energy storage. Ultimately, hydrogen production rate, production cost, investments and stack replacement costs become major factors to incorporate in deciding on the choice of the electrolyser. This points to an important synergy between flexibility and durability, such that highly flexible technologies (capable of increasing hours of operation) must have a relatively higher durability and hence lower frequency of stack replacement. To what extent will the flexibility of PEM change with changes say from using noble to using non-noble catalysts, remains an open question especially considering the latter synergy.
3.2.2.4 Modeling of the PEM. 
The interesting features of the PEM electrolyser has drawn several attentions to evaluate its performance against a set of applications, primarily based on variable renewable energy. As a consequence, there is a growing number of model-based studies and model development pertaining this technology. Table 5 summarizes the models concerning the PEM technology. Similar to AWE, the PEM electrolysis is characterised by two-phase flow which tends to have a strong effect of performance of the technology, for example, formation of hot spots is linked to misdistribution of two-phase flow and current density.123 When considering the solids such as electrodes, the model then features three phases. Models considering the aspects of PEM control and monitoring are also available in literature.121,124,125 With variation of operating conditions, it will be necessary to interrogate the accuracy of the PEM models and further develop and validate these model under dynamic conditions. A more recent study by Sood et al.126 focused on developing a generic model for the PEM taking into account auxiliaries and dynamic conditions. The model also simulate the losses and real-time efficiency under dynamic conditions, and it forms a good base for prognosis and diagnosis related to PEM.126 The authors represented the system based model using modular bond graph and deduce that their model predicts the experiment well (with error percentage <5%). Additionally, comparative analysis of mass transfer models for the PEM is still required to ascertain the model with best predictive capabilities. Most of the authors in literature neglect the concentration losses which are best accounted for by considering elaborate mass transfer equations. The rationale for the latter neglect is that the electrolyser operates at lower current densities, however, in future the ball game may change and the current density for the PEM is expected to increase (>1.6 A cm−2), thus developing model that take into consideration the overpotentials due to mass transfer diffusion is needed. Besides, it is necessary to consider mass transfer effect when designing novel cells configurations and materials. Effective models considering two-phase flow mass and heat transport aspects can be developed and tested using CFD platforms.127 Limited models deals with cross-over and bubbles formations issues which forms part of the two-phase flow in PEM; thus more investigations are needed in this direction including experimental validations.123,128–131 On the other hand, most model developers do not consider pressure effects correlation in their formulations. Moreover, experimentally validated universal degradation model is missing for the PEM electrolyser. The degradation model developed by Chandesris et al.131 is mainly focused on membrane. VoltaChem and TNO105 have also announced their target to develop the advanced degradation model for PEM. Additionally, few multiscale models have been reported in literature and as a consequence, more work is still needed in this direction. Ultimately, collaboration among researchers and engineers in the field to develop a universal electrolyser model (more especially multi-scale) via using a dedicated open source platform is required.

3.2.3.1 Reduction of capital and operating costs of the SOEC. 
Although it is widely accepted that low-cost electricity and/or waste heat is critical for the reduction of hydrogen production cost, it is also possible to achieve similar goals via improving the electrolyser design from material to stack to system levels. The SOEC stack is the most expensive and sensitive component in the electrolyser and its design and operation window detect the large portion of the capital and operational costs.24 The electrolyser stack comprises individual cells joined by electrical conducting metal interconnects in a gas-tight manner.67,141,142 The cells are either connected in series or parallel and are classified as either button/planar or (flat) tubular type.143,144 Stack configurations are commonly designed as planar and tubular types or according to fluid flow as co-flow and counter-flow stack (both of which differ according to the active area, but can be classified as planar configurations).81,85,141,145,146 However, each has its own limitation.
Sunfire stack is based on the planar type and parallel flow design with an open cathode optimised to achieve a favourable trade-off between the cost, performance and degradation.76 The planar type is characterised by higher power density, but it presently has unresolved sealing problems.146,147 While, although the tubular type has a better start-up time, thermal cycle and no sealing problems, it is nonetheless difficult to manufacture this type of stack.81 Other configurations include flat tube, micro-tubular designs148 and mono-block layer built type. The geometry of the stack design is also a critical factor, and it is determined by variables such as cell area, thickness of the channels, air flow rate, stack compactness, and type of interconnects. Compactness (typically measured as power density – W cm−3) and durability are the most important factors of capital cost expenditure.149 At present, the capacity of a single SOEC stack is in the range of the 3 to 15 kW scale. Literature is rich in stack design and optimisation of the solid oxide cell operating in fuel cell mode.146 However, with cheaper materials and economies of scale, Sunfire expects the material cost of solid oxide-based technologies to reach 150 to 100 € per stack, which translates to 40–25 € per kW (calculated at 0.65 A cm−2).76 Operating costs are affected, in addition to heat and electricity costs, by the plant availability, which at times calls for the design of an electrolyser system with additional equipment (e.g. a battery) or different operational strategies (e.g. hot standby mode). Long start-up time, low ramp rates and stack degradation increases the operating cost of the SOEC. Waste heat can be used to extend the SOEC's operation hours by keeping the electrolyser on hot standby mode, but this must be available at a cheaper cost.150 Also, system efficiency, taking into account auxiliaries such as compressors, intermediate H2 storage tank dynamics, H2 recycle (∼10–20 mol%) to the SOEC, feed water treatment, water management and/or product purification systems, affects the operation costs of the electrolysis system.85,151 Increasing stack/cell operation pressure can reduce downstream SOEC product compression ratios, and reduce stack temperature variation and hence cost effectiveness.85,151 However, caution must be exercised to limit the operating pressure within the feasible operating window as permitted by the materials to prevent any mechanical failures, increased pipe thickness requirements and air turbomachinery complexities, and the excessive internal generation of methane during co-electrolysis, and reduction of system efficiency.85,152 Wendel et al.84 discussed a trade-off between the stack operational parameters and energy storage density. Nonetheless, the trade-offs between increasing the discharge pressure and other parameters such as current density, reactant utilisation, degradation rate, temperature/ambient pressure rise, etc. still require in-depth investigation. Sunfire uses lifecycle costs per cumulated energy production (€ per kW per h) as a key measure for stack development, and trade-off-analyses can also take this into account.76
3.2.3.2 Increasing the stack lifetime/durability of SOEC. 
Increasing the stack lifetime/durability has called for different design and operation strategies. According to Wang et al.,24 the stack lifetime is a function of the operating temperature rather than the operating voltage, and hence effective control of the SOECs' stack temperature can be achieved by adjusting the sweep gas flow rate. Nonetheless, this compromises the system efficiency. Thermal management is critical to minimise stack temperature gradients, which can be caused by uneven flow distributions. On the other hand, the design of an electrolyser to operate in a lower temperature window is of great interest. The state-of-the-art protonic SOECs can now operate at temperatures lower than 600 °C, compared to the conventional ion-conducting SOEC type.67,82,153 Wendel et al.,84 however, deduced that low temperature (<600 °C) operation is not a necessity for a system configured to operate as ReSOC. This is supported by findings from Graves et al.,152 who demonstrated that reversible cycling between the electrolysis and fuel cell modes, possible in ReSOC, is beneficial to reduce degradation. In addition, from the stack design point of view, decreasing the active surface area of each cell in the stack improves the management of thermal stress distribution and sealing quality.154 Zhang et al.154 observed this effect when they conducted a long-term degradation test using a stack with a reduced active area for each cell (from 60 to 45 cm2). The authors further modified the material and microstructure on the air-side electrode to alleviate electrode delamination issues, and used stainless steel-based interconnects in their stack design – coated with spinel – to avoid oxidation and chromium vapour formation. With ongoing cell improvements and long-term stack degradation testing, Sunfire indicated, in their 2019 publication, following 3000 hours of steady-state operation, as well as power modulations and thermal/redox cycling of their improved stack, a decrease in the area-specific resistance degradation rate from 18 to 13 mΩ cm2/1000 hours.76 However, further assessment of the degradation rate following longer hours of operation is still required to validate the reported value.76 Degradation under highly dynamic conditions remains an open question.
3.2.3.3 Increasing the efficiency and flexibility of SOEC. 
A great deal of work is currently performed to improve the efficiency, stack size, flexibility and durability of SOECs.76 Decisions pertaining to rectification, temperature, pressure, current density, heat source, reactant compositions (including humidity and inert), reactant utilisation, sweep gas flow rate and configurations strongly influence the efficiency of the system.65,152 However, other operational strategies to increase efficiency have been investigated, such as thermoneutral point following and thermal management. Operating electrolyser cells near the point of thermoneutral voltage has been the assumption in most studies to increase the energy efficiency, but this strategy has a challenging requirement of high current density.65,84,85 To improve the efficiency, thermal management (e.g. via promoting an internal exothermic methanation reaction during co-electrolysis at intermediate temperatures (500–750 °C) and elevated pressure up to 20 bar, or the use of heat-storage technologies such as phase change materials, etc.) has been discussed as a critical strategy.152,155–158 For the effective implementation of heat storage in the ReSOC system, the key requirement is that the operating temperature in the SOFC mode (Tfc) must be higher than both the heat storage temperature (Tm) and the electrolyser temperature in SOEC mode (Tec). The temperature difference between the heat storage and SOFC/SOEC modes, expressed by eqn (1), has a critical influence on the roundtrip efficiency; the roundtrip efficiency marginally decreases (1–2%) with an increase in the temperature difference (ΔT). Tfc − Ths = ΔT = Ths − Tec(1)
Flexibility can be divided into three aspects: scalability, operational flexibility (e.g. at various part loads, etc.) and tolerance to different fuels.62,159–162 Both SOEC and ReSOC can be scaled up and down without significant loss in thermodynamic performance.62,76 The ability to perform co-electrolysis reaction in the HT-SOEC, and operate the system in reversible mode are unique and well-known flexibilities offered by solid oxide cell technology, thus pointing to its tolerance to different fuels. This flexibility provides potential for thermal management.66 In terms of operational flexibility, short start-up and shut-down times are other key factors, for which a micro-tubular SOEC have been proposed.148 Sanz-Bermejo et al.159 considered different SOEC thermodynamic operation modes, i.e. constant cell inlet temperature vs. thermoneutral point following, the influence of dependency of the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte on temperature in the overall system, and operation strategies such as constant steam conversion (60%) vs. constant steam flow rate to optimise the SOEC design and operation under part-load.
Thermoneutral point following was observed to have constant cell efficiency, whereas constant inlet cell temperature depicted higher cell efficiency at low current density (endothermic operation) than at higher current density (exothermic operation).159 Higher area-specific resistance variation resulted in lower temperature variations.159 On the other hand, higher system efficiency corresponded to constant steam utilisation at points below reference power load and constant steam flow rate at points above the reference power load.159 Andika et al.66 and Wang et al.24 discussed the benefit of a SOEC system to improve the efficiency and design flexibility of the PtMeOH process. At this stage, it is crucial to point out that a trade-off exists between the electrolyser's operational flexibility and the requirements of externally coupled processes.
3.2.3.4 Models for SOEC and further optimisation opportunities. 
Numerous modelling studies on SOEC (not so much for ReSOC) exist, and recent focus has been on combining both stack- and system-level models towards analyses and the optimisation of the SOEC.70,80,144,151,162–165 The reaction is either assumed to be instantaneous with constant conversion or fitted to match the experimental data.166 García-Camprubí et al.166 discussed fitting experimentally derived electrochemical parameters (such as pre-exponential coefficients, exponents and the forward and backward transfer coefficients) in the computational modelling of an SOEC as an important challenge in ensuring model accuracy. It is usually assumed that electrodes have a negligible electronic resistance. Stempein et al.70 gave a good review of SOEC modelling work from the 1970s to 2013 taking into account both steady-state and transient models from 0D to 3D. Even though electrolysis models have been developed in the past years, electrolysis model development is still an active research field, especially since the technology is still improving. A major trend in the literature is to adapt the SOFC models to represent the solid oxide electrolysis process with key distinction between SOEC- and SOFC-derived models, among others, being the kinetics used. However, numerous studies are emerging and are focusing on the development of electrolysis-based models. It is not recommended to simply adapt SOFC models to SOEC processes, especially (semi-) empirical-based models as the behaviour of the cell under each underlying process is different. In addition, heat transfer in the SOEC (i.e. endothermic, exothermic or thermoneutral) is more complex than in the SOFC.167 Wang et al.165 developed a combined stack and system model for a SOEC, coupled with the power-to-methane process. Moreover, increased modelling efforts are directed towards electrolyser cell investigations, e.g. the modelling of electrode and electrolyte configurations and their associated performance.70,80,168–170 Wang et al.170 developed a three-dimensional model for a single cell to predict the performance of the cell in a cathode-supported planar SOEC and taking into account H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis, internal reforming reaction and multi-component diffusion. They proposed a novel and structurally optimised flow-field porous material, which improved the electrolysis efficiency (4.78% at 2.5 A cm−2), uniform thermal and concentration distribution, and further lowered the cell voltage (∼0.026 V at 2.5 A cm−2). Other modelling and optimisation efforts are directed towards the hierarchical combination of both cell and stack models.149,171–173
Nevertheless, there is still a need to improve these models, e.g. by incorporating detailed cell degradation models/mechanisms and validating them experimentally over wide temperature ranges and dynamics.162,166,169,173
Since degradation models tend to be empirical, their accuracy will be improved by long-term field testing of the SOEC or ReSOC. A degradation-based model was developed and evaluated by Parhizkar and Hafeznezami.174Table 6 summarises the types of models (lumped parameters, distributed dynamic, input–output), their applications (cell level, stack level, system level and detailed multiscale and kinetics), typical assumptions, advantages and disadvantages/limitations, along with possible areas of improvements. Among other required improvements, validation of the models considering most recently developed experimental findings and recent knowledge/performance improvements in SOEC system or SOEC materials are required. In addition, most dynamic models are validated with steady-state generated experimental data. However, for dynamic models, dynamic experiments are required. Dynamic modelling will provide valuable information for decision making, and process design and optimisation.

Further developments of steady-state and dynamic models considering electrolyser stack, cell-level models, reaction kinetics, different loss mechanisms, flow field designs and the integration of electrode, electrolyte, current collectors and interconnects to form multi-physics and multi-scale models are still required.98 Moreover, improvements of SOEC technology regarding ramping flexibility, start-up time and system integration in a global power-to-methanol process are still needed.66,80,170,212
Other improvements are required in the areas of strategies for thermal management, water separation from the product stream, control of reactant utilisation, H2 and/or oxidant tank storage, and the reduction of balance of plant (BOP) power consumption considering practical operating windows. The focus should also be directed towards the integration and optimisation of this technology in a power-to-methanol process, with detailed analysis and the investigation of various system configurations, off-design conditions and dynamics. The integration and optimisation of HT-SOEC and/or ReSOC for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis and pure H2O electrolysis for application in methanol synthesis represent a new and growing field of R&D. Evaluation of trade-offs between the energy efficiency and capital cost, at variable electrolysis (i.e. load-dependent) efficiency, as will be introduced by the variation in the load, must be investigated.

4. CO2 as a precursor: sources, capture technologies and synergies with (co-)electrolysis.
The CO2 sources differ in terms of their process chemistries; hence, the composition and purity of the CO2 stream and the dedicated CO2 capture methods and economics will also differ.213 The sources of CO2 include fossil fuel-based electricity/heat production processes, cement plants and chemical plants such as fermentation, incineration processes, iron/ferric reduction, pulp production and CO2 already in the atmosphere. Table 7 shows the different sources and their respective concentration of CO2. Each of these processes allows for the integration of thermal energy and components, such as H2 and O2 (see Fig. 3).213,214 In this section, we qualitatively discuss the synergy. However, a quantitative assessment of advantageous synergistic factors still deserves further investigation and must be coupled to downstream methanol synthesis. Components such as O2 and H2 are often needed in the CO2-producing sources as oxidant or combusting and reducing agents, respectively. For example, the O2 that originates from the electrolysis can be used as an oxidant during ferric reduction, the incineration of municipal waste, the gasification of biomass, calcination, black liquor combustion and biogas upgrading to remove the hydrogen sulfide (H2S).213

 Fig. 3  A simplified generic superstructure showing synergies of renewable energy, electrolysis products, capture and subsequent CO2 utilisation. Modified from Dwivedi et al.214 
The use of this ultrapure O2 eliminates or reduces the composition of the inert components in the reactant stream. Furthermore, the availability of O2 from the electrolysis may eliminate the need for a costly air separation unit.213,214 In addition, to concentrate the CO2 stream, dilution with water can be performed since CO2 is soluble in water. However, the latter may require further separation of water, which may come at a cost. Excess thermal energy from the CO2-producing processes such as black liquor combustion can be used, for example, in steam generation for the electrolysis process. Capture technologies are also largely influenced by the concentration or pressure of CO2 inlet stream to the capture system, sorption efficiency or capacity and catalyst materials, which strongly influence the technology's energy penalty and cost. However, in case oxygen from the variable renewable electrolysis is used in the CO2 source and in the absence of storage, the associated dynamics may cascade to the capture process, resulting in a varying flow rate of CO2 output.
Several review papers have been published in literature concerning CO2 sources, capture technologies, storage and utilisation. Among the most recent review papers, few consider a holistic view on the CO2 source, capture technologies and cross-sectoral linkages with other processes. Most recently, Ghiat & Al-Ansari215 briefly reviewed different CO2 sources, the capture methods and technologies, and major carbon capture and utilisation projects that focus on their trans-sectoral symbiosis within the energy, water and food nexus. Koytsoumpa et al.50 discussed CO2 emissions and their separation methods from various industries, and assessed the potential CCU pathways with the emphasis on CO2 conversion to fuels and chemicals. Mikulčić et al.216 evaluated various CCU pathways and their potential for integration with renewable energy systems. This section extends to briefly assess the synergies of the renewable energy, electrolysis, CO2 sources and their corresponding carbon capture technologies, as well as the integrated CO2 capture technologies and capture process flexibility.
4.1 CO2 sources with high-cost capture methods

4.1.1 CO2 production from power and cement plants (flue gas). 
Fossil fuel power and cement plants are the largest CO2 emitters (see Table 5). The capture of CO2 from flue gases occurring on these plants can mainly be accomplished with processes based on absorption, adsorption and membrane technologies.2,12,217 These include different process flow sheets such as capture processes that occur before (pre-combustion) and after combustion (post-combustion), respectively, in the case of coal-fired plants. Pre-combustion capture involves the removal of CO2 from a gas stream from a gasification process prior to combustion. Post-combustion consists of CO2 capture after combustion (coal fired) with air.218 Absorption processes that involve amine-based scrubbing using chemical absorption and regeneration simultaneously are considered the most mature capture technology, particularly the technology based on mono- and di-ethanolamine (DEA) solvents.2,219 Extensive research involving advanced sorbents and process modelling is currently in progress.220–223 However, these processes are characterised by high energy usages (3886–6480 kJ per t per CO2 and corresponding to 30 wt% (for lower cost) to 15 wt% (for higher cost bend) mono-ethanolamine (MEA) solvent concentration) for the regeneration step, and corrosion of the MEA solvent is prevalent when its concentration is higher than 30 wt%.224 Dry and semi-dry adsorption (physical and chemical) methods are also currently being developed, which involve sorbents such as activated carbons, zeolites, metal organic frameworks, amine-based solid sorbents, carbon nanotubes, potassium and sodium carbonates.225,226 Fixed-bed and circulating fluidised beds with simultaneous regeneration (temperature-swing) are currently used and are being investigated.227 Membrane technology can easily be applied to the separation of CO2 from flue gas as a result of the inherent permeating properties of the favourable CO2.228 Membranes such as glassy and rubbery polymers, molecular sieves and several inorganic materials are excellent for CO2 separation.228,229 The oxy-combustion process which consists of the combustion of coal with pure oxygen has been found to produce high-purity (99.7 mol%) CO2. Due to the use of pure oxygen usually obtained from cryogenic air separation, the method is expensive. However, by-product oxygen from the electrolysis process can be coupled to this method.


4.1.2 CO2 from the atmosphere. 
The CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily.229 Capturing and recycling CO2 from the atmosphere presents a potential sustainable and economic avenue for chemical production.2 Direct air capture (DAC) technology can be used to capture CO2 from the atmosphere. The advantage of direct air capture lies in the fact that it can be deployed anywhere; hence it does not need to be in a location near the point source, and it is not compromised by the presence of SOx and NOx.2 An extremely low concentration is present in the atmosphere (slightly above 400 ppm) relative to the other gases.2,229 This makes DAC technology expensive due to its higher energy penalty, resulting from using a large volume of air in the capture system.2,12,229 This challenges the integration of this process with CO2 conversion processes. However, Climeworks, Switzerland, is commercialising DAC technology.12,229 Metal hydroxide solutions have been used to capture CO2 from the atmosphere by a start-up company called Carbon Engineering, Canada. Other technologies include the amine-based capture technology that has been commercialised by Global Thermostat. Alternatively, adsorption-based methods can also be suitable for CO2 capture from the atmosphere.229


4.1.3 CO2 from steel production. 
The production of steel makes use of carbon-based fuels and reductants. It is an energy-intensive process with various by-products such as methane, hydrogen, CO2, CO, sulphur, NOx, metals, chlorine-containing compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. However, the concentration of CO2 in the waste stream is higher (20–30%) than the normal flue gas.12,230 Post-combustion capture is the typically used method for capturing CO2 from this process. Membrane-based technologies are currently being developed for commercial application.230


4.1.4 CO2 from natural gas-based plants with chemical cooping. 
Natural gas-based plants emit 7–10% CO2.215,231 Although the CO2 can be captured from natural gas-based processes using amine-based technologies, chemical looping is also gaining interest.215 The chemical looping combines both fuel conversion and capture technology, and is gaining interest due to its potential to reduce the energy penalty. Depending on the application, chemical looping can be classified as chemical looping combustion, chemical looping reforming and chemical looping water splitting.213 Chemical looping was originally proposed for use with gaseous fuels, especially natural gas.215,216,231 During chemical looping, oxygen – carried via a metal oxide, e.g. based on metals such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni – is used for the combustion of the fuel. The metal oxide forms as a product of metal redox reaction in which air is used for oxidation. The advantage of the process is that it keeps nitrogen out of the product gas stream, thereby reducing the energy cost of process capture.215,216,229,231,232 For example, the chemical looping combustion and water splitting methods produce a mixture of CO2 and H2O as final product, which can easily be separated by condensation. Although the chemical looping process is gaining interest in scientific literature, it has not yet reached commercial scale. However, attractive economic incentives for the CO2-capture technologies will likely make this process more economically attractive. Research in the modelling and optimisation of this technology is in demand.


4.1.5 CO2 from ammonia production, biogas and the biomass gasification/combustion plant. 
For ammonia production, CO2 has to be removed from the N2 and H2 streams. This CO2 can be used for methanol production. With the H2 derived from electrolysis, only N2 purification process will be the source of CO2 in the ammonia synthesis chain. For separating CO2 from N2, a water wash process can be used. Alternatively, although marred by challenges of feedstock and land availability, respectively, if implemented at a significant scale, biogas and biomass can be a sustainable source of CO2. Usually, biogas production is based on anaerobic digestion and impurities such as hydrogen sulfides (H2S: 0.1–3%), CO2 and moisture are produced.233 Water scrubbing and swing adsorption technologies are typically used for biogas upgrading. Due to its high flexibility, high auto-control degree, low investment costs, reduced energy consumption, no water requirements and zero biological impurities, swing adsorption technology (typically pressure swing adsorption) is gaining increased interest for capturing CO2 from the biogas output stream. Hybrid technologies that combine, for example, membrane and cryogenic separation, can also be used, but they are not commercially available yet and cryogenic separation is relatively expensive. Membrane-based technologies, as well as water scrubbing for biogas upgrading, generate significant pollutants. To further reduce the separation effort, Schorn et al.234 recently evaluated the potential use of oxy-fuel technology for biogas upgrading with oxygen originating from the electrolysis and energy supplied from renewables. Applying oxy-fuel separation in biogas leads to CO2 and H2O as waste products, which can further be easily separated by condensation to capture CO2. Biomass gasification or combustion usually produces a stream containing H2, CO2, CH4 and CO. CO2 is captured using the calcium looping method, which uses low-cost and highly reactive CaO-based sorbents.2 Emerging research trends are also showing the potential of integrating chemical looping combustion to biomass.216

4.2 Additional CO2 sources with low-cost capture methods

4.2.1 Calcination and iron reduction. 
During the calcination process, which involves the use of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), CO2 is produced. Since this industrial process generally includes the elimination of inert (N2) gas used or found in air as reagent gas, the vented product stream contains CO2 and H2O. CO2 from the resulting CO2/H2O mixture can then be captured using condensation to eliminate water.213 Iron-reduction using conventional blast–furnace processes converts solid carbon (coke) to CO in the presence of pre-heated air as an oxidant.213 As a result, during the smelting process, inert (e.g. N2) gas is produced. However, the use of pure O2 produced from the electrolysis process instead of pre-heated air can eliminate inert gas from the smelting process, further producing CO2, which can be cheaper to separate. On the other hand, H2 from the electrolysis can also be used in the process as a reducing agent, thus resulting in a less endothermic process and hence higher energy efficiency. Moreover, in the case of co-electrolysis, a mixture of CO/H2 from the co-electrolysis process can be used in the direct reduction of iron. The end products of direct reduction process are CO2 and H2O, which can again be separated using condensation, which is relatively cheaper than, for example, amine scrubbing.


4.2.2 Pulp and paper, and fermentation industries. 
The pulp and paper industry contributes about 1–2% of CO2 to the globally available CO2.2,183 In the pulp and paper industry, air typically used to combust post-boiling liquor, which contains various by-products, such as inorganics like nitrogen. With the use of electrolysis-derived oxygen, the nitrogen can be eliminated. Thus, the main by-products from the combustion of black liquor, after recovering reagent materials, are steam and CO2.213 The CO2 can then be separated from the H2O via condensation. Excess oxygen can also be used in pulp bleaching.213
During fermentation, an oxygen-sparse environment (which can be sourced from the electrolysis) is required during metabolic glucose conversion. This produces high-purity CO2 and bioethanol. The industrial fermentation typically uses corn, sugar cane, grapes and/or sorghum. This process produces high-purity CO2, thus resulting in its simplified subsequent capture. However, the main challenge with this process is the annual fluctuations in the production of bioethanol (hence CO2) and the low volumetric amount of CO2 generated from it.12

4.3 Integrated capture technologies and flexibility
Each of the capture technologies has an advantage, which may be a shortcoming of another technology. Thus, a hybrid system can be created on the basis of the synergies to improve the capture efficiency and reduce cost.229 This can be achieved by developing materials that can perform multiple functions (a one-pot solution), e.g. absorption and adsorption, or staging different methods in series or in parallel.229 For example, the combination of membrane and absorption in a staged manner (series), whereby the membrane can serve to concentrate the CO2 stream on the upstream, thereby reducing the energy penalty during downstream absorption and desorption. On the other hand, a one-pot process may combine two or more capture methods in one unit (using dedicated materials) and/or a combination of capture and conversion in one step (e.g. amine-assisted capture and conversion to methanol).235 A one-step capture and conversion process offers process intensification by removing the desorption, compression, transportation and storage of CO2, and thereby showing potential for improving the energy efficiency and profitability if it is technically feasible.229,235 A recent review by Wang & Song176 covers these topics.
However, integrated capture deserves further investigation and optimisation, in particular the assessment of trade-off between the operating and capital costs.236 This must be tied to the further assessment of the flexibility in the CO2 capture technologies, which will also be critical, considering the case of the high penetration of variable renewable energy.216 For example, during the period of high energy demand or supply deficit and since the capture technology uses energy, the CO2 capture technology operation will have to be reduced or halted (CO2-containing fuel stream vented) to accommodate immediate high-priority loads and thus calling for a quick and safe response of the capture units, taking into account the variation in the loads.216 This means that a capture system that is operated with renewable energy needs to start up or shut down quickly to avoid further energy penalty under these conditions. Similarly, during surplus renewable energy periods, the capture technology operation can be increased. This will be required to respond faster, thereby improving the economics of CO2 capture if the energy is free, and reducing the amount of vented CO2.
Alternatively, parts of the capture units (less energy intensive) can be operated under low-energy supply or high demand, while others, which are energy intensive, can only be operated during the period of surplus energy supply. For this purpose, the storage of intermediate products that results from each capture stage may be needed, and their viability is strongly linked to the availability of other downstream processing units. However, these aspects deserve further investigation, including how the effects of the flexible operation of the CO2 capture cascade to influence the techno-economics of the downstream utilisation of CO2, e.g. conversion to methanol and/or the capture business model(s). This will also require a detailed modelling of the capture technologies, considering the associated dynamics.220,221
5. Methanol synthesis
This section gives an overview of thermodynamics and reaction mechanisms, state of the art of the reactor technologies, along with their advantages and disadvantages, and developments in catalyst technologies and kinetics models that pertain to the methanol synthesis process. The section further extends to discuss the methanol synthesis reactor design, the associated modelling assumptions and key optimisation requirements. Studies and aspects critical for the application of catalysts, reactor technology design and modelling in the power-to-methanol chain are also highlighted.
5.1 Overview of thermodynamics and reaction mechanisms
Historically, methanol synthesis from syngas operating conditions changed from high pressure (>300 bar) and temperature (350–400 °C) to low pressure (<100 bar) and temperature (200–300 °C). Recently, the focus is on changing the synthesis feed gas composition to pure CO2/H2. The reactions of syngas to methanol (Syn2MeOH) and pure CO2/H2 to methanol (dCO2-MeOH), eqn (2) and (3), respectively, are exothermic and proceed by a reduction in the number of gas moles, hence low temperature and high pressure favour these reactions. Nonetheless, temperatures above 200 °C are used, with current industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, to enhance the reaction kinetics.237–239 The reactions are also limited by equilibrium at higher temperature, and the occurrence of side reactions such as the endothermic RWGS reaction (eqn (4)) may jeopardise product selectivity.240 (2) (3) (4)
The equilibrium methanol yield is higher for Syn2MeOH than for dCO2-MeOH.239,241,242 The activation energy of a CO2 hydrogenation reaction is higher (∼68 kJ mole−1) compared to that of CO hydrogenation over a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst.239,242 The carbon source of methanol is controversially argued to be either from CO or CO2 or both. The lack of agreement on the reaction mechanism over a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 surface is a big debate in literature.243–256 Earlier, it was adopted that CO is the source,257 then with isotope labelling, it changed to CO2,243,246,249,256,258–262 and more recently to both depending on a Cu+/Cu0 ratio.250,256,263–265 Literature also recently agreed on the presence of the RWGS reaction in the reaction mechanism even though the roles of its products (CO and H2O) remain a point of debate. Whether these reactions proceed stepwise or simultaneously, on which active sites (and their state i.e. either oxidised or reduced and the number or mechanism i.e. competitive or dual, etc.) and role of each product or intermediate represent crucial points to be explored further.266
A recent study by Nielsen et al.267 deduced that CO is detrimental to the methanol formation rate at low conversions, while at high conversion (leading to ≥1 mol% of methanol at the effluent), it serves to scoop water via the water gas shift reaction (see illustration in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5(a and b)). Nielsen et al.267 further concluded that CO2 is at-least the major carbon source of methanol over Cu-based catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the relative methanol formation rate variation with the percentage concentration and the partial pressure of CO2, plotted using experimental data. Methanol formation increases fast in the presence of CO2 (see Fig. 5(c)) even at low CO2 partial pressure.267 However, it would be key to reconcile this with theoretical models which seems to predict CO hydrogenation as having the fast methanol formation rate268,269 than CO2 hydrogenation, contrary to experimental findings such as those from Nielsen et al.267 and isotope-labelling experiments which claims the rate of methanol formation to be faster for CO2 hydrogenation.

The intermediates for eqn (2) could be either methoxy (H3CO*) from the formyl route or hydroxyl considering the hydrocarboxyl route, however methoxy is mostly reported as a stable intermediate. On the other hand, eqn (3) seems to proceed either via a formate (formate or methoxy intermediate) or carboxyl route or hydrocarboxyl (hydroxyl or hydroxymethylene), but mostly formate hydrogenation has been observed on different catalysts and surface measurements shows that both methoxy and formate are the mostly abundant intermediates.262,273,274 Conversely, the hydrocarboxyl route has also been shown to be kinetically favoured due to its lower energy barriers. However, studies on reaction mechanisms and hence intermediates are not concluded.266,275 Other intermediates, mechanisms and side reactions are possible and may be a function reaction conditions, feed composition and catalyst sites.
5.2 Catalysts and kinetic models

5.2.1 Catalysts for methanol synthesis using pure syngas (CO/CO2/H2), CO/H2 and CO2/H2 as a feed. 
Methanol can be produced from both homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts based on Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 are industrially applied.276,277 Homogenous catalysts are receiving growing interest due to their ability to operate at lower temperatures (<150 °C).277 The main limitations of homogeneous catalysts are their problematic recovery from products and required additives to achieve high catalytic activity.247,278 Heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in terms of stability, separation, handling, reuse, and with them, lower costs of reactor design are possible.276 Many good reviews are available in the literature that compare recent progress on heterogeneous catalysts for methanol synthesis.11,263,276–281 The catalyst affects the process energy efficiency, productivity and economics.282
Alsuhaibani et al.282 investigated the impact of catalyst development concerning the methanol reaction system on the entire profitability of the plant and hence identified the catalytic performance metrics that could enhance the profitability of the plant more significantly as shown in Fig. 6. They observed that synthesising the catalyst with higher single pass conversion, although important to increase yield, has a smaller effect on the entire plant's profitability (measured by ROI), but reducing the methanol synthesis reaction pressure to less than 5.4 atm, with an efficient catalyst capable of operating in that window, can significantly increase the profitability of the plant. The reduction in the capital cost is due to a reduction in the number of compression units, whereas the operating cost is mostly influenced by a reduction in the input energy requirements for compression (hence improved energy efficiency). The savings improves the ROI by a factor of about two.

Table 8 summarises the performance of the catalysts emanating from the most recent studies that have been tested and found to be best performing. Special reference is made herein to the key research activities and new directions in the aspect of catalyst development. Heterogeneous catalysts can be metal-based (e.g. Cu, Au, Ag, In, Pd, Fe, Ce and Pt) or metal-oxides with various support materials.239 Industrial Cu–ZnO–Al2O3-based catalysts were originally optimised for syngas hydrogenation reactions.282 When the feed is changed to a pure CO/H2 mixture, the industrial catalyst performs very poorly. In addition and owing to debates about reaction mechanisms, and the advantages of syngas and CO2/H2 reactions as highlighted in Section 2, limited work focuses on the development of catalysts suitable for methanol synthesis using a feed with pure CO/H2.238,244,279,283–286 High CO concentrations in the feed promote reactions that form undesirable by-products such as carbonyls over commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. Seidel et al.286 also discussed that long-term operation with pure CO/H2 feed is unreasonable due to significant reduction in activity. However, a pure CO/H2 reaction to methanol does not form water, which is an advantage of this reaction. Crucially, Van de Water et al.284 and Zhang et al.285 presented Cu/CeO2 and Rh/MoO3/SiO2, respectively, as candidate catalysts for methanol synthesis from a pure CO/H2 feed.

With its potential for large CO2 utilisation, significant research is focused on finding better catalysts favouring the direct CO2 hydrogenation reaction (CO2/H2) to produce methanol.238 Cu–ZnO–Al2O3-based catalysts exhibit low selectivity (<90%) and conversion (<40%) for the direct CO2 hydrogenation reaction under normal conditions (temperature: 200–300 °C, pressure: 30–80 bar, and a H2/CO2 ratio of 3:1).11,276,279,287,288 The thermodynamic equilibrium conversion of CO2 is said to be around 25.78% at 473 K and 30 bar following the Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation.287,288 Candidate catalysts based on Pd/In2O3, In2O3/ZrO2, CeO2 support, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3/Y2O3 and Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 are promising for selective CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, but are also characterised by low conversion (<30%). An In2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was tested by Martin et al.289 and found to have reduced activity loss (8% in 400 hours) due to water-induced sintering. Ceria oxide (CeO2) is attractive due to its ability to strengthen the CO adsorption on active Cu sites, thereby inhibiting the progress of RWGS and methanol decomposition reactions, ultimately enhancing the selectivity to methanol.290,291
To overcome challenges such as deactivation at higher temperatures and/or catalytic particle agglomeration, bimetallic catalysts such as Pd–Cu/SiO2, Pd–Zn/TiO2, Pd–Ga, Pd–Zn, Cu–Fe, In–Pd, Cu–Co, Co–Ga, Ni–Ga, carbides, lanthanum oxides (Cu/LaOx) and nickel (e.g. Cu–Ni)-based catalysts are proposed.287,290–293 A Ni–Ga-based catalyst developed as Ni5Ga3/SiO2 shows promising performance since it remains active and selective at temperatures as high as 300 °C.293 Pd-based (e.g. Pd–Zn, Pd–Ga) catalysts show attractive performance under low pressure operations.292,294,295 For example, a PdZn/TiO2 catalyst developed by Bahruji et al.296 achieved a CO2 conversion of 10.1% and methanol selectivity of 40% at 20 bar and 250 °C. Other tested catalyst materials include Cu–ZrO2, Cu–ZnO/SiO2, Cu–SiO2, Cu–Ni, Cu–TiO2 and the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as the porous support to anchor/stabilise the Cu/ZnOx catalyst.297,298
From an industrial point of view, the methanol catalyst should improve to fulfil the following requirements:16,278,279,282,290,299–304
• Low pressure drop and moderate diffusion restrictions, i.e. a factor of pellet size and shape design (e.g. daisy shape highlighted as optimal304).
• High activity and selectivity, which decreases by-product formation.
• High thermal and mechanical stability.
• Tolerance to poisons (e.g. water, sulphur, chlorine, nickel/iron, carbonyls) and process dynamics (e.g. intermittent power supply) – which reduces feed purification requirements and cost, and improves process efficiency.
• High activity at low pressure (<50 bar) and low temperature (≤150 °C or Huttig temperatures) compared to industrial conditions (temperature ≥200 °C and pressure ≥50 bar).
The industrial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst will likely remain a benchmark catalyst for several years to come due to its superior activity, stability and economic advantages compared to other catalysts.9,247,282 However, the findings from Lo and Wu,305 based on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 with different compositions, give hope that reasonable selectivity and conversion can be achieved at low temperature and pressure conditions (180–200 °C and 7 bar, respectively). Opportunities exist to further decrease the temperature and pressure with the use of different materials and/or preparation methods (e.g. Allam et al.306) or use of plasma catalysis.287 There is developing literature that approached this indirectly by investigating the interaction between Cu and ZnO (or any other promoter of concern) and morphological changes that probe further insight into how the catalyst and its preparation methods can be optimised.266,298,307–312 For example, the Cu–Zn and/or Cu–ZnO synergy model developed by Kuld et al.313 can be utilised to optimise catalysts by developing predictions that can be further tested with experiments. Wang et al.309 also combined experiments and DFT calculations to study the metal synergistic interaction of a Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 catalyst.
Limited work investigates the performance of catalysts under dynamic conditions as they will be prevalent in power-to-methanol processes using solar and wind as the energy sources.299–301,336 These dynamics could also be introduced by the consequence of failure in the performance of the balance of plant equipment such as imperfect mixing. Kalz et al.299 highlighted the importance of considering dynamic conditions when designing catalysts systems, and further assessed implications and key actions needed to ensure that chemical systems are best adapted (resilient and flexible) for highly dynamic conditions, e.g. at time scales between a few milliseconds for heat and mass transfer changes and a few hours typical for catalysts restructuring e.g. via morphological changes or sintering processes. The potential negative influences that can be introduced by dynamic operating conditions on catalysts include sintering, oxidation, the formation of carbides, dissolution or leaching, composite formation, formation of metal complexes, and – ultimately – the loss in product quality.337
On the other hand, the potential positive effects that can be introduced by this mode of operation include the regeneration of active sites, etc., depending on the process conditions and catalyst materials.249,291 For example, as cited by Kalz et al.,299 Topsøe300 performed the in situ characterisation under dynamic variations of the feed-to-methanol reactor from H2/CO/CO2 to CO2 free synthesis and back, which depicted a positive change in the methanol yield. In contrast, Zurbel et al.,336 using an integral reactor and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 as a catalyst, reported a loss of 4.5% and 4.7% in CO2 conversion and methanol yield, respectively, under dynamic operating conditions, even though the temperature inside the reactor and catalyst stability remained less affected. However, more discriminating experiments in aspects of long-term catalyst stability and kinetics under dynamic operating conditions are required to confirm potential the benefits.300,338 Therefore, dynamic operation may either reactivate or deactivate the catalyst. Future studies must investigate this from an atomic to bulk catalyst and reactor scales. Spectroscopic methods will be critical in this regard.


5.2.2 Kinetic models. 
Four categories of kinetic models for methanol synthesis exist.264 Category 1 assumes reactions 2–4 to occur, hence CO2 and CO as sources of methanol.241,261,339,340 Category 2 assumes reactions 2 and 3, but not the RWGS reaction.249,341 Category 3 assumes reactions 3 and 4, but excludes CO hydrogenation, hence only CO2 as the carbon source of methanol.255,264,342 Lastly, Category 4 assumes reactions 2 and 4, but excludes CO2 hydrogenation, hence only CO as the carbon source of methanol.257 The most used are the models of Bussche and Froment255 and Graaf et al.261 Although recent literature suggests an Eley–Rideal mechanism, these models are based on Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) or Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) by nature, which requires knowledge about the reaction mechanism. These models have different validity windows (pressure, feed and temperature). They also differ on assumptions regarding active sites (e.g., Graaf et al.261 two-active sites, Park et al.,241 Seidel et al.339 and Slotboom et al.:264 three-active sites, while Bussche and Froment:255 one-active site) and rate-determining steps.
Additionally, the models are outdated and exclude the latest developments, such as catalyst morphological changes.264 The model of Graaf et al.261 is partially physically sound and tends to predict one surface concentration twice.255,264,343 Earlier, the source of this dual prediction of the same species concentration was thought by Bussche and Froment255 to emanate from assuming all three reactions (2–4). However, with the use of different active sites, this was debunked by Seidel et al.339 Regardless, the use of reactions 3–4 (noting that reaction 2 is a summation of 3 and 4) only in the model formulation is convenient and reduces parameters, hence helps attain model simplification as a critical driver. From a reactor modelling perspective, Leonzio344 compared the kinetic models of Graaf et al.261 and Bussche and Froment,255 and deduced the model of Bussche and Froment255 as being better in describing the industrial methanol reactor.
Recently, Slotboom et al.264 used similar data sets compared to the model of Graaf et al.,261 Bussche and Froment,255 Seidel et al.,339 Villa et al.,257 and Ma et al.,345 along with the six and ten parameter models they proposed. Fig. 5 shows the performance comparison of their six-parameter model (Np = 6) with the model of Graaf et al.,261 Bussche and Froment,255 Seidel et al.,339 and experiments. Slotboom et al.264 screened different rate-determining steps using a regression method.
From their study, it emanates that the original model of Graaf et al.261 performs poorly compared to that of Bussche and Froment,255 as shown in the plot of CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity depicted Fig. 7. However, it performs better when regressed. The authors attributed this to be potentially from the use of data obtained using an older MK-101 catalyst in the regression of the original model of Graaf et al.261 Both models of Graaf et al.261 and Bussche and Froment255 do not accurately predict data outside their training sets. Besides, Category 2 and Category 4 models represent the system more poorly. Moreover, at pressures higher than 30 bar, the model of Bussche and Froment255 predicts a constant response on CO2 conversion, and the model of Seidel et al.339 best predicts the experimental data with reduced standard errors (see Fig. 8), but their model is complex. Nonetheless, the model of Seidel et al.339 is developed for unsteady-state conditions, while that of Slotboom et al.264 is focused on steady-state operation and Seidel et al.346 recently issued a correction to their original model i.e. Seidel et al.339 Furthermore, Slotboom et al.264 deduced that the best-fitting rate-determining step is the HCOOH* dissociation to OH* and HCO* for CO2 hydrogenation (* means adsorbed), while for RWGS, it is the CO2 dissociation to CO and O. Nonetheless, more discriminating experiments are needed since the statistical differences were minor on the tested dataset and the six-parameter model, which was the simplified version of their 10-parameter model, which best predicted the data. However, their proposed model is characterised by a large error in the activation energy of RWGS reaction 4.3, errors in methanol and water concentration for which the authors advocated for more experimental data collection and formulation of experiments with water and/or methanol in the feed to improve the model.

Table 9 gives a summary of the kinetics models (steady state and dynamic) with a focus on the most recently developed (2014–2020) and most used models derived over Cu-based commercial catalysts, their rate expressions, validity range, key assumptions, strengths and weaknesses. From an evaluation of these studies, assumptions based on three active sites (i.e. the oxidised and reduced centers separated) have become the recent trend as model developers seem to claim that this approach best predicts the experimental data. However, it is still not very clear which assumption is really the best as some researchers still assume two active sites and still find their models to fit their experimental data points very well. In addition, there is still no clear distinction in performance when different rate-determining steps are assumed. Most of the global kinetics presented in literature lump elementary steps together. On the other hand, care must be taken when selecting the rate-determining step of the RWGS reaction. Moreover, some authors do not tend to disclose the entire validity range of the models, with prominent exclusions being the carbon oxide ratio (COR) and stoichiometric number (SN) ranges, while other models are only validated for limited range. Interestingly, most recent models tend to take the limiting effect of water into account and are mostly developed for pure CO2 hydrogenation. Nestler et al.347 proposed that future experiments should consider high CO2 feed content (in syngas feed), fibre optics for hot spot detections and improved kinetic model formulation. Considering the latter, Nestler et al.348 extended their previous model given in Nestler et al.347 to study the temperature profile of non-isothermal-polytropic miniplant reactor. They compared their updated model with that of Graaf et al.,261 and Bussche and Froment,255 and deduced that all models poorly predicts temperature profile. On the other hand, operations under hydrogen deficit (contrary to the excess or stoichiometric which is usual considered) may be possible in the context of power-to-methanol and therefore experiments with low partial pressures of these components are needed to adjust the models. In addition, parameter identifiability (e.g. considering both additional independent measured information and reducing the number of unknown parameters while ensuring that the model is physically sound and with minimal correlations) and/or kinetic inverse and sensitivity problems deserve further attention in order to improve model predictive capabilities and variance, and this must be coupled to the development of dynamic kinetics models for methanol synthesis.349 Furthermore, deactivation models and probable side reactions must be included. Even though Siedel et al.286 attempted to correct their model by including the probable deactivation and side reactions, the model is still marred by the fact that it was validated with experiments beyond the interesting kinetic range (<500 K) and its lack of improved identifiability. Furthermore, Seidel et al.286 failed to detect some side components in the gas chromatography with ion-molecular-reaction mass spectroscopy that they used, while Park et al.241 considered dimethyl ether (DME) kinetics developed from a different catalyst. Outcomes from most recent studies such as Svitnic et al.350 can provide valuable insights in the aspect of by-product formation. To support model developments, further detailed experiments on catalyst intermediates and/or adsorption constants, axial/radial temperature profile, and deactivation are needed. Nonetheless, a number of studies351–353 consider formulating kinetic models using non-commercial catalysts and provide valuable insights on the reaction mechanism and potential reduction of apparent activation energy, thus helping scientists and engineers understand and improve the performance of the non-commercial catalyst in question. Validation of kinetic models in semi-pilot and pilot plants under relevant industrial conditions is required. Other models are formulated based on power law, artificial neural networks, micro-kinetics with DFT and kinetic Monte-Carlo.273,354–357 Power law represents numerous possibilities to fit the experimental data, which can yield inaccurate predictions if not handled with care, and are valid for a limited range of conditions.

Micro-kinetics and kinetic Monte-Carlo give insights about the reaction mechanisms, but are characterised by severe complexity and longer computational time.273,354,357 In addition to gathering more data, future work should focus on simplification of the model, while incorporating the latest and most relevant insights for better predictions.252,254,256,358,359 For example, the incorporation of synergetic effects and surface morphological changes (e.g. incorporating the kinks, steps and other defects, the Zn substituted Cu such as in the work of Jo et al.360 and Ovesen et al.361 is advocated and must not compromise model simplification. As the accuracy improves, insights beyond what can be experimentally tested will be gained and this will scale to reactor modelling, designs and optimisation.

5.3 State-of-the-art reactor technologies with their advantages and disadvantages
Three categories of reactors, using solid catalyst for methanol synthesis exist: gas-phase, three-phase and membrane reactors.254,362,363 Quasi-isothermal fixed-bed reactors, operated in the gas phase, are the most-used technology for methanol synthesis. The work of Dieterich et al.10 and Bozzano and Manenti254 gives detailed summaries of different types of commercial and semi-commercial methanol synthesis reactors and their advantages and limitations, and schematic diagrams. About 60% of the worldwide methanol is produced from the adiabatic quench reactor from Johnson Matthey, while 27% is generated through Lurgi technology.12,362 Johnson Matthey quench reactors suffer from faster catalyst deactivation due to irregular flow distribution and the formation of variable hot and cold regions, hence more by-product formation.12,254,281,364 They also have low per pass conversion. The Lurgi reactor has higher per pass conversion (∼40%), but still features a recycle that can make it slightly costly and the reactor design complex.12,34,38,254,281 Packed bed reactors typically have less effective heat recovery (in particular at higher heat transfer rates or highly exothermic reactions), which is a limitation to the exothermically characterised methanol synthesis process that requires good temperature control.254,362,363 Membrane reactor technologies are unfortunately very expensive at present. Novel reactors, known for high heat transfer and fast kinetics, which have not reached commercial scale, include micro (channel and monolith-structured) reactors and non-thermal dielectric plasma reactors.365–367 These reactors are still subject of intensive research (e.g. to alleviate flow distribution challenges, catalyst loading/replacement, scalability issues, etc.).368–378
5.4 Reactor design principles
Three underlying principles are key drivers for methanol synthesis reactor design: effective heat-removal and enhancing single-pass conversion, reducing pressure drop, and flexibility and economics.379,380

5.4.1 Effective heat removal and increasing single-pass conversion. 
Due to the exothermic nature of the methanol synthesis reactions, effective heat removal or transfer is required for safety, reduction in the number of pieces of physical equipment (e.g. heat exchangers) and to enhance selectivity and yield.
To achieve this, common large-scale synthesis reactor design features two stages: the water-cooled section where low, medium or high pressure (36–43 bar) steam is generated, removing heat from the reaction zone, and the gas-cooled section where the fresh feed gas is heated in the tube side and synthesis product from the water-cooled reactor reacts further in the catalyst loaded shell side.35,254,381,382 Contrary to this conventional design, Mirvakili et al.381 proposed, as the best, a configuration in which the total recycle from both gas-cooled and water-cooled reactors is heated via a heat exchanger unit and fed to the shell side while only fresh feed gas (not mixed with recycle) is heated on the tube side of the gas-cooled reactor. The key design parameter is the heat transfer coefficient or rather shell side and coolant temperatures.382–384 However, undesirable gas flow maldistribution inside the gas-cooled reactor often results in non-uniform temperature distribution and hence gas condensation within the reactor, which, in effect, lowers the single-pass conversion.45,385,386 Increasing the single-pass conversion (limited by equilibrium) is also a critical driver in synthesis reactor design.45 Leonzio344 evaluated parameters such as recycle ratio, global heat exchange coefficient, temperature, pressure and tube diameter on carbon conversion and specific heat flux, and deduced that increasing reaction temperature and recycle ratio decreases the carbon conversion.383
Mirvakili et al.385 investigated the cause of flow maldistribution and attributed it to poor design of the gas distributor in the shell and tube side of the reactor. They proposed three different configurations: with partial condenser prior to the gas-cooled reactor, the injection of hot synthesis gas at 2 m near the exit of the reactor, and warming the shell side of the reactor with steam in a jacket within the last 2 m of the reactor to address the effective heat removal and enhance single-pass conversion. The configuration with partial condenser, which separates methanol and water in the inlet of the gas-cooled reactor, provides the most effective strategy with a 7.9% increase in the methanol production rate. They further used self-heat recuperation technology. The concept of a multistage indirect intercooling and radial flow reactor is also applied industrially.387 The other strategy is typically referred to as liquid-out gas-in (LOGIC) and has been demonstrated using a laboratory-scale reactor by Bos and Brilman45 to achieve near (99.5%) full conversion. Following the LOGIC principle, the reactor designs differ in their cooling strategy, i.e. adiabatic single bed, adiabatic multi-bed reactors with external cooling, adiabatic multi-bed reactors with direct cooling (e.g. quench reactor), multi-tubular cooled reactor, etc. Cui and Kær35 compared single-bed adiabatic reactors with water-cooled and gas-cooled reactors considering syngas to methanol and direct CO2 hydrogenation routes. They deduced that the water-cooled reactor has efficient heat removal, low hot spots temperature and a wider inlet temperature control range than the gas-cooled and single-bed adiabatic reactor, especially for the direct CO2 hydrogenation route. Other designs use a temperature gradient between the cold and hot plate or heat exchanger like reactors and retrofits such as tube-cooled with metal inserts or using different catalysts layers within the reactor,386,388,389 and others couple the exothermic methanol synthesis reaction with endothermic reaction, e.g. in the so-called ring network/simulated moving bed reactor network, but all, at present, still fail to achieve full single pass conversion.390,391
Other reactor designs take advantage of a reduction in reactor volume to gain effective control of reaction heat such as micro (channel or structured) reactor technology.392,393 Their modular nature is relevant for distributed application of power-to-methanol as energy storage technologies, and in the case of adiabatic or gas-cooled operation.35 Modular reactors have significant economic, safety and flexibility advantages.299,371,394–397


5.4.2 Pressure drop within the reactor. 
Pressure drop is generally dominant at larger reactor scales (>5000 tons per day, Ploss: 2.4–7.5 bar).10 To reduce pressure drop within the reactor, and hence compression requirements, radial flow and fluidised bed designs are proposed as solutions. Adiabatic, radial, spherical, packed bed reactors are significantly researched in literature, particularly for syngas to methanol.398–403 These reactors also exhibit higher conversions. Recently, Parvasi and Mohammad Jokar403 presented a novel radial flow, cylindrical packed-bed reactor with tube-cooled configuration and evaluated its performance for methanol synthesis. They deduced that the reactor provides a greater cross-sectional area than conventional axial flow, tubular, packed-bed reactors, and thus reduces the pressure drop (<0.5 bar) or the gas passing through the catalytic bed and permits a larger inlet gas flow rate. Furthermore, the reactor volume can be increased vertically without drastically increasing the pressure drop, while the non-adiabatic nature of the reactor avoids heat accumulation. One other strategy is to design compact reactor(s) with short catalyst bed lengths.22


5.4.3 Flexibility and economics principle. 
The flexibility of the reactor refers to its scalability, part-load or periodic operation capabilities. Using intermittent renewable energy supply to produce hydrogen or syngas from electrolysis means reactors will have to start up and shut down quite often, and must be flexible to handle variable inlet conditions such as feed flow rate, molar ratio, adaptive coolant temperature/flow rate, etc., while protecting the catalyst from deactivation and ensuring cost-effective production.22,242,299,337,379,404,405 The Lurgi reactor is said to be capable of part-load (10–15%), quick response to load changes (1.5 minutes) and easy start up, but more discriminating dynamic experiments are required to confirm.254,406 The economics of the methanol plant is partly dependent on the methanol reactor design, flexibility and size.379,405,407 Increasing flexibility (in terms of high turn-down ratio and ramp-up and down rates), capacity utilisation and the operating hours of the plant (including reduction of plant down times) are important factors. Related to flexibility and capacity utilisation is the question of the extent of coupling the variable energy profiles to the methanol reactor and associated limiting factors, which deserves further detailed exploration to assess the capabilities of electrolysis and reactor technologies. Table 10 gives the advantages and disadvantages of each extent of coupling, i.e. fully coupled, partially coupled and fully decoupled.405 Huesman405 compared a scenario where the methanol synthesis step is decoupled (operating at steady state) from inlet fluctuations using a large battery to a scenario in which it is fully coupled (meaning a highly dynamic operation with a small or no battery). The authors deduced that the fully coupled scenario is economically preferred and reduced operational flexibility increases the production cost of methanol by at least 20%.380
Table 10 Comparison of the merits and demerits of extent of coupling [modified from: Heusman405]




Extent of coupling
Advantages
Disadvantages




Fully decoupled
- Known operation (conventional processes operated at steady state provides a wealth of experience)
- Typically uses (large) battery storage/hydrogen storage facility, which increases the costs of the plant


- High equipment utilisation i.e. design capacity/average capacity ≈1
- Lower overall efficiency, e.g. with addition of battery (discharge efficiency <100% and lower voltage during discharge) and/or compression necessary for intermediate tank storage of hydrogen


Partially coupled/decoupled
- May be relevant for operation where, e.g. standby mode is relevant; in case certain equipment cannot be shut down due to longer start-up time
- Not yet explored significantly


- Reduced battery capacity
- Battery may still be needed and therefore increase costs and reduce efficiency


Fully coupled
- No battery storage and/or no high level of rectification of variable energy sources required
- Clarity on the best operation mode is limited as conventional plants are typically operated under steady state


- Higher overall efficiency
- Reduced process equipment utilisation, i.e. design capacity/average capacity >2


- Not yet explored significantly




On the other hand, input fluctuations offer an opportunity for forced periodic operation. Forced periodic operation, implementable with proper actuation, sensors and scheduling, can deliver desirable modulations and therefore desirable outputs.22 Modular reactors are argued as having a potential to offer flexibility, for example tolerating low feed rate, since they can be connected as multiple reactors in series and independently from each other to achieve the desired plant capacity, and therefore making such serial connections easy to bypass.22,299 However, trade-offs exists between the reasonable number of reactors (ultimately, capital costs) and desired production rate, etc. Limited work is available in literature that investigates the dynamic or flexible operation of the methanol synthesis reactors.337,379,405,408–410 A key related requirement is that the system must be easy to design, control and/or manage without incurring unreasonable operating and capital costs. However, in the case of the power-to-methanol process and its achievable flexibility ranges, it would be necessary to question the attractive economics and scales (e.g. size and number of modular reactors) for various energy system applications, along with the associated challenges they may pose. Closely related is the reduction of plant down times, e.g. with designs capable of easy catalyst loading and removal. The scalability (e.g. in terms of space-time yield) of new and better-performing reactor designs, such as the reactor with condensation presented by Bos and Brilman,45 and microchannel reactors deserve further investigation. In addition, the effects of disturbances on the temperature of solid and fluid phases, space-time-yield, and comparison of flexibility of commercial reactor designs and other types of fixed-bed reactors deserve further investigation including their different thermal management strategies under varying load.

5.5 Reactor models
Large efforts in the modelling of methanol synthesis reactors are directed to packed-bed reactors (PBRs). Table 11 highlights critical modelling efforts and model types. Reactor modelling is intrinsically non-linear and complex, e.g. stiffness in the partial differential equations. Two types of steady-state modelling approaches are prominent, i.e. pseudo-homogenous and heterogeneous models. Most of the literature work assumes pseudo-homogenous models.383,392,411–413

These are applied to one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) reactor modelling, even though the chemical-physical phenomena within the reactor exist in at least four dimensions (e.g. the axial and radial directions of the reactor, catalyst particle radius and time).411,414–416 Pereta et al.415 developed an algorithm to solve a multi-scale model (with four dimensions) of the fixed-bed reactor. Most of the literature work is focused on 1D modelling of the methanol reactor, hence 2–4D modelling is limited in literature.383,411,412 PBRs have axial and radial gradients, and gradients along the radius of single catalytic pellets and temporal dynamics.254 The 1D heterogeneous and 2–4D models (pseudo-homogenous and heterogeneous) capture these gradients.411,412 These gradients and dynamics cannot be neglected in industrial-scale reactors and will be more pronounced in variable power-to-methanol processes. Accurate modelling is critical for reactor design and optimisation.

5.5.1 Steady-state models. 
Common assumptions in the modelling of the methanol synthesis reactor under steady state are negligible axial diffusion, negligible radial diffusion, constant radial velocity, constant temperature and pressure in the catalyst, negligible catalyst deactivation, absence of side reactions, and Thiele modulus applied to a representative single-catalyst particle to evaluate the effectiveness factor and thus the intra-particle mass transport.35,254 The model basis is either mole or mass balance, with mass balance formulation taking into account variations of moles in the axial direction described by Manenti et al.414 being more accurate. Pseudo-homogeneous models based on mole balances, in addition, neglect axial variations in molar flows and gradients between the gas and solid phases, but the rates are expressed as a function of the solid phase temperature and concentration profiles. Pseudo-homogenous models based on mass balances consider molar variation along the axial direction, but still neglect the gradient between the gas and solid phases. Pseudo-homogenous models treat both gas and solid phase as a single entity (pseudo phase) and consider the average properties of the two phases, but neglect the solid and fluid phase gradients, at times expressing rates as a function of fluid phase temperature and concentration. Pseudo-homogenous models work well under high inlet gas velocity.
In pseudo-heterogeneous models, heat and mass transports between the particles and the gas phases are considered, and each phase's mass balance is treated separately. Heterogeneous models are advantageous to best describe the reactor performance. Bozzano and Manenti254 highlighted that pseudo-homogeneous models can accurately describe the reactor performance, with lower computational time demand in cases where conditions such as feed flow rate, shell temperature (in shell and tube reactors), etc. are close to nominal conditions (e.g. at high inlet gas velocities). The necessary details to achieve high accuracy are typically not very clear in model formulations and hence, at present, researchers use problem formulation as the critical first guiding step to what assumptions may be prevalent. Kaiser and Freund,413 using a pseudo-heterogeneous model, deduced that there are considerable concentration and temperature gradients, for example within the catalyst, and thus neglecting them can lead to a violation of the allowable range of operating conditions for the catalyst.


5.5.2 Dynamic models. 
Dynamic models based on elementary balances rather than component balances have been formulated and proved to be robust.417 The disadvantage of dynamic models is the difficulty in convergence, which thus necessitates a robust numerical solver, typically a finite difference approach that discretises the partial differential equations and solves them as a series of ordinary differential equations.191 Additionally, for systems with perturbations, the dynamic model would typically predict a discontinuity in the dynamic trends, which cannot be physically interpreted.254 But considering axial dispersion, these are removable with model transformation from a hyperbolic partial differential equation system to parabolic partial differential equations Manenti et al.417 demonstrated the latter along with the method to remove the numerical instabilities and maintain the minimum computational effort. Petera et al.415 developed a crucial algorithm to solve the same problem. To further alleviate problems such as excessive smoothness or stiffness as sometimes introduced by finite difference methods and hence obtain the best dynamic behaviour and parametric sensitivity (e.g. shell temperature, inlet gas temperature, inlet mass flow rate, etc.), Manenti et al.417 evaluated the use of adaptive grids methodology with fewer grid points to maintain minimum computational time. Besides, incorporation of response time in dynamic modelling of the reactor will be key requirements for power-to-methanol processes. Under dynamic conditions, temperature gradients (e.g. radial temperature) are crucial factors to consider. Typical 1D reactor models are not satisfactory in modelling this, but 2D models can be used.383,406

5.6 Opportunities
Although it is evident that important work has been done in the area of modelling, there is still a need to balance prediction accuracy and computational time, taking into account relevant details possible (e.g. the energy balance of cooling gas, mass and heat transfer, reactor hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, etc.). Detailed methods and analyses, particularly based on dynamic models representative of power-to-methanol processes, are needed in the context of designing flexible and resilient catalysts and reactors for methanol synthesis.299,337,405 In addition, the efforts in this direction should include the use of advanced tools such as CFD modelling platforms and multi-scale considerations.385 Optimisation of catalysts and reactor design for better heat removal, higher single-pass conversion, improved flexibility and cost-effectiveness are required. The continued investigation of reaction mechanisms and associated kinetic models are needed, particularly under dynamic conditions, as will be prevalent in power-to-methanol processes.
6. Process synthesis in power-to-methanol
A large body of literature is based on analyses and improvements of electrolysers,62,420 reactors374,385,386,403,417,421–427 and catalysts, separate from the overall process.254 Recent research interest is directed towards the integration and optimisation of these technologies in systems such as power-to-methanol (PtMeOH).2,24,25,30,39,66,428 Among others, the current technologies of interest include high temperature electrolysers (SOEC-based) and reactors such as fixed-bed and micro reactors. Synthesis of highly efficient and economically best-performing processes is a critical task.41 This section discusses work on PtMeOH process synthesis i.e. integration, optimisation, associated methods and evaluation criteria and techno-economics. Table 12 summarises the studies on PtMeOH process integration analysis and PtMeOH integration with other processes taking advantage of synergies (e.g. (by-) product application). Fig. 9 illustrates the integrated process with highlights of the points of synergies.

6.1 Process integration
The key system integration challenge, among others (e.g. flexibility and resilience), for SOEC-based processes is the need to overcome the endothermic electrolysis reaction such that the system (at feasible design or operation capacity) is energetically self-sufficient/neutral or sustaining (e.g. in the case of ReSOC-based processes).24,84,85,379,428,429 The methanol synthesis reactor loop is dominated by cooling utility demand. However, pre-heating the reactor feed is typically required. Added to this are the energy requirements for distillation column(s) and CO2 capture depending on the source and supply chain(s).428 Electricity source(s) and heat integration are central to attain energy self-sufficiency and enhance the overall process energy efficiency.32 Waste heat from other industries or electrical heating (less preferable) can be integrated, but the primary goals of reducing complexity and cooling exergy destruction is to efficiently integrate heat emanating from different subunits of the PtMeOH within the process or primarily subsystem of concern.430 Reduction of more than 37% of cooling utilities can be achieved with heat integration.4 The operating temperature of individual units, the number of utilities and the overall process configuration are decisive on the heat integration potential.431 Wang et al.24 evaluated heat integration potential for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis-derived syngas to methanol (coSyn-MeOH) and steam electrolysis-derived hydrogen to methanol (via the direct CO2 hydrogenation route: dCO2-MeOH).
The coSyn-MeOH improves the process heat integration and hence energy efficiency due to the low steam feed rate requirement, since a fraction of the steam is generated internally from reverse water gas shift reaction and the fact that the CO/H2 reaction to produce methanol is more exothermic (e.g. at 260 °C about ≈3.8 more heat is generated than in dCO2-MeOH).23 With the proper choice of the operating point of the electrolyser and heat integration, no electrical heating is required for coSyn-MeOH.24 More than 7% of additional external heat (e.g. electrical heating) may be required for SOEC steam electrolysis-to-methanol, depending on the operating point, for steam generation.24 However, Wang et al.24 deduced that if no external heating is required for steam generation, then coSyn-MeOH should not be the primary choice due to its higher electrolysis voltages, which can reduce the system efficiency. Nonetheless, co-electrolysis and increased sweep gas flow rate can widen the operating windows (offering more flexibility) of PtMeOH.24,430 Zhang and Desideri43 also demonstrated the heat integration potential of the coSyn-MeOH process. Considering two design points, i.e. minimum cost design point (MCP) and maximum efficiency point (MEP), Zhang et al.428 investigated the system-level heat integration for the steam electrolysis-derived hydrogen-to-methanol (SOEC-based dCO2-MeOH) process. The SOEC was operated under highly exothermic conditions to eliminate the need for an additional external heat source, and thus the electrolyser outlet contributed a significant amount of heat energy, followed by heat from a waste (purge) boiler during steam generation. On the other hand, the heat released from the methanol synthesis step covered the distillation heat requirement. The MCP was run at a higher electrolyser current density and thus, for the same reactant utilisation, more water and heat was integrated for steam generation. Lonis et al.30 integrated the ReSOC with methanol synthesis for the first time under steady-state conditions. In their study, waste heat from ReSOC in fuel cell mode was integrated into ReSOC operating in SOEC mode using thermal energy storage materials. Schwabe et al.9 presented a novel process, which combines the SOEC electrolysis with methanol synthesis in one pot with potential for improved direct heat integration, kinetics and thus energy efficiency, and relevant for distributed microgrid applications. However, the prototype is still at laboratory scale, with high investment cost and technical challenges necessitating its further evaluation.
A fraction of studies considers the steady-state process integration of PtMeOH, assuming full load operation. Others extend to consider the downstream application of the PtMeOH-derived product methanol as a precursor. Petrescu et al.433 evaluated and compared, in order to select the economically attractive application of product methanol, the downstream conversion of methanol to acetic acid, dimethyl carbonate (DMC), formalin, DME, biodiesel, and methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) processes. They showed that the conversion of methanol to biodiesel and MTBE are the most attractive routes.433 Zhang et al.430 studied PtMeOH integrated with biomass to generate methanol and DME (via methanol dehydration) and showed that PtMeOH-to-DME is not heat-self-sufficient.
Wassermann et al.435 assessed the techno-economics and environmental performance of PtMeOH integrated with refineries for green jet fuel production taking advantage of flue gas produced from the refinery. Whereas Rocha et al.436 studied the performance of PtMeOH integrated with ethanol distilleries in which bagasse is used for the co-generation of electricity and thermal energy, while CO2 precursor is obtained from the distilleries. They established that using co-generated energy, the challenge of high energy requirements that is mainly introduced by the electrolysis step can be overcome. While Afzali437 considered a comprehensive evaluation of the role of integrating PtMeOH into the grid, evaluating socio–technical parameters that influence grid reliability and emission reduction. However, detailed explorations with consideration of advantageous synergies are still required. Nonetheless, studies on PtMeOH process integration are still limited, based on oversimplified flow sheets, steady state, and thus more work is required to optimise heat integration. For example, additional heat (≈1/4 of the total power consumption) can be valorised from the gas compression stages.24 Considerations of other parameters such as pressure drop, hydrogen pinch-analysis, exergy, entropy balances and detailed water and heat exchanger networks in process integration will be relevant – in particular for small-scale PtMeOH systems (i.e. for distributed microgrids), which are dominated by auxiliary equipment.24 Furthermore, possible improvements can be achieved by coupling heat integration and optimisation, simultaneously rather than in the traditional sequential approach.431 On the other hand, only a few studies focused on PtMeOH process integration and analysis under dynamic conditions have been reported to date and the findings, summarised in Table 13, will be discussed under Section 6.2.2.

6.2 Optimisation-based process synthesis
Optimisation is broad, and in a simplified manner herein, is divided into design-based and operation-based optimisation with reference to the overall PtMeOH system.254 Design-based optimisation features geometries, system topology and operating conditions. Operation-based optimisation encompasses process planning, control and safety management under dynamic conditions. Table 11 summarises these studies.

6.2.1 Design-based optimisation. 
In this direction, limited optimisation work is reported for both H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis-derived syngas to methanol42 and steam electrolysis to methanol processes.428 The available studies are focused mainly on operative conditions and techno-economics optimisation under steady state, but, in general, the integrated systems tend to be simplified.43,428,432,438–440 Few studies consider the optimisation of two or more objectives.43,428,439 Zhang et al.428 considered multi-objective optimisation, i.e. the efficiency and production cost of PtMeOH. Kenkel et al.439 and Kenkel et al.432 performed a bi-objective superstructure-based optimisation of PtMeOH (via CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with hydrogen derived from steam electrolysis).
The authors considered a simplified approach, with a less detailed process configuration presented, to perform economic and environmental analysis. Chaniago et al.440 optimised the energy and exergy efficiency, as well as the methanol production rate and retrofitted the self-heat recuperative system of the co-electrolysis based PtMeOH process. The authors did not perform simultaneous optimisation, but optimised each of the objective functions individually under steady state conditions. From their study, optimisation of self-heat recuperative-based co-electrolysis using a vortex search strategy reduced the exergy loss (hence improving energy efficiency) by 61.7% and improved the methanol production.The work of Zhang and Desideri43 is almost an extension of the work of Zhang et al.,428 but considers H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis-to-methanol and uses the same subunit configuration for the methanol synthesis step, objective functions and optimisation method. A key take-away point from these studies is the existence of the trade-off between the production cost and energy efficiency, showing a slight increase in production cost with an increase in energy efficiency.
It is essential to highlight that energy efficiency is a strong function of system boundaries, e.g. the detailed optimisation of balance of plants and separation networks, CO2 capture, the influence of methanol synthesis kinetics on the operating windows of the electrolyser and hence the overall process. An important factor of methanol synthesis kinetics, among others, is the stoichiometric ratio of the feed, and its effects on process operation, including the electrolyser throughput, size and electricity requirements.36,347 Hankin and Shah,36 using a thermodynamic model, evaluated the effects of stoichiometry on the overall energy efficiency and CO2 conversion/emission rate (based on a stoichiometric equilibrium reactor), excluding CO2 capture, potential deviations between kinetic models vs. a thermodynamic approach, and global optimisation. The authors deduced that a methanol synthesis reactor feed stoichiometry of H2/CO2 = 2.5 and H2/CO = 2 yields optimal energy efficiency for direct steam electrolysis to methanol and co-electrolysis syngas to methanol, respectively. Although these studies showed promising results, opportunities for improvements exist in the SOEC-based power-to-methanol process, including its energy efficiency. The highlighted studies neglect analyses of trade-offs and ‘non-trade-offs’ from the simultaneous optimisation of process yields, single-pass CO2 conversions and reactant stoichiometry (considering valid and improved kinetic models) and purity (e.g. CO2 < 99 mol%), exergy efficiency, electrolyser lifetime and operating window/strategies, purge or recycle ratio, CO2 emission, plant operating hours, and sustainability, control and safety operation objectives along with capital and production costs. Other critical factors include catalyst and electrolyser stack properties such as deactivation.
On the other hand, PtMeOH process optimisation has thus far neglected detailed optimisation and analyses of the process topology or structure, which is typically determined by the process synthesis and intensification methods.441 Work of Zhang et al.,442 Adnan and Kibria,434 Andika et al.,28 Hankin and Shah36 and Hernandez-Perez et al.443 provide good bases with important findings that can be used for the optimisation of PtMeOH process topology.
Multi-objective analyses with consideration of process topology and coupled with different process scales (multi-scale) are the required research. Thus, detailed synthesis, integration, optimisation, intensification and analysis of trade-offs and non-trade-offs via multi-objective analyses for the power-to-methanol system are still needed.254,444 This must also consider the applications of the end product(s) and the incorporation of synergistic parameters to optimise the process.


6.2.2 Operational-based optimisation. 
Under dynamic conditions, capturing renewable energy supply intermittence, integration and optimisation of different sections of the plant can be a function of the operating period/periodic operation of each unit or subsystem.28,305,379,405 For example, from the steady-state focused work of Lonis et al.,30 the integration of different sections of the overall system was observed to be influenced by the differing operation times of different systems (in their case the ReSOEC and methanol, and the ReSOFC, i.e. which refers to the operation of ReSOC in fuel cell mode). Hence, the overall system of the study by Lonis et al.30 was condensed into two independent subsystems (i.e. the production of methanol and ReSOFC for reforming methanol) and a regenerative heat exchange and thermal energy storage (TES) system was used in between. This influences the relationship between the process tasks in ways not fully understood, particularly for microgrid applications or rather when methanol has to be converted back to electricity for demand-side power management.28,48 Varela et al.406 evaluated flexible performance of the renewable energy-based PtMeOH under dynamic conditions considering scenarios with step functions of up to 20% (w/w) increments on the feed hydrogen flowrate as will be imposed by fluctuating power input (first absorbed in the electrolysis stage). They deduced that a PtMeOH system, fitted with a Lurgi reactor for methanol synthesis, shows rapid response to disturbances, reaching steady state in 1.5 minutes and that increasing the amount of CO2 in the feed by up to 5% (w/w) limits the feasible region to increase methanol production, in particular at highest hydrogen flow rate disturbances (20%). By doing so, the authors observed that the carbon atom conversion within the reactor is not compromised and methanol production increases with fluctuations in renewable energy sources. The authors further concluded that methanol synthesis is feasible in terms of short reaction times and smooth profiles with open loop response, and on the other hand, large recycle reduces effects of disturbances.
Most of the studies on PtMeOH under dynamic integration and optimisation (see Table 13), are focused on deterministic approaches with only Martín,445 per author's findings, that has considered evaluation of the process under uncertainty via a two-stage stochastic approach. Even though the model of Martín445 still included steady-state surrogate models for assessing the production plant and was aimed at introducing the method/tool, rendering it less oriented towards detailed evaluation of the process, but taking PtMeOH as a demonstration case study, its study offered valuable insights.
From the study of Martín,445 which encompassed the integration of wind and solar energy resources with an alkaline-water based electrolyser, a methanol synthesis reactor and a purification system, and using multi-period as a method, Martín445 deduced that, under uncertainty conditions, an intricate trade-off between investments and production capacity exists and, as a result, capacity utilisation and annual hours of operation become even more critical as factors to consider in design to avoid having idle/underused equipment. The work of Huesman405 also used a simplified and deterministic dynamic model, which considered only diurnal cycles in solar energy variations.
It is also critical for the optimisation of the power-to-methanol process to take into consideration the hourly, daily and seasonal variations of renewable electricity, and uncertainties in electricity price profiles, CO2 supply chain and carbon tax. In some instances, this will necessitate the consideration of process planning and scheduling, different designs (e.g. electrolyser oversizing), control and safety with flexible operation that does not constrain the economics of the process.446 Sánchez et al.446 considered design at the supply chain level and operation at the scheduling level for decision making to evaluate the storage potential of methanol relative to others (i.e. methane, DME and ammonia). Under the supply chain level, production and storage facilities, as well as the transportation network, are considered,446 while under the scheduling level, the impact intermittence of solar and wind energy are evaluated, as well as the hydrogen storage.446 These studies offer a basis to establish a more detailed evaluation. To the authors' knowledge, no detailed work has been done in this particular direction, particularly for SOEC-based processes. Ultimately, more work is required for performance analysis and optimisation of the PtMeOH process under dynamic and uncertain conditions (e.g. considering chance constrained optimisation). Efforts in this direction must be supported by increased electrolyser stack and reactor testing at variable load conditions.

6.3 Methods and evaluation criteria

6.3.1 Methods. 
Rigorous models using Aspen software with the black box treatment of the process components are commonly used for the generation of mass and energy balances. Heat integration is typically performed sequentially after the optimisation. In cases where heat integration is considered, pinch analysis methodology is used, although it is known that this method does not guarantee optimality when applied sequentially; it also fails to eliminate redundant components.428,431,447 Heuristic methods (such as genetic algorithms) are typically used for optimisation.43,431 Superstructure-based methods are also gaining popularity, but have mostly been used thus far in the PtMeOH for heat exchanger network, utility and techno-economics optimisation, and formulated as mixed-integer linear programming.43,428,432,441 Few studies consider simultaneous heat integration and optimisation, and are based on separate methanol synthesis and separation steps – instead of considering the overall process.431 Perhaps this is due to the resulting combinatorial complexity, rendering the model with mixed-integer non-linear programming; which is thus difficult to solve.
On the other hand, the direct application of pinch analysis to simultaneous optimisation is still challenging since the heat duties are decision variables and not known beforehand.23,431 However, Schack et al.431 took advantage of the idea of decoupling process-based non-linearity using the FluxMax approach to develop a method for simultaneous optimisation and integration. This method can generate alternative optimal process configurations.431 These superstructure-based methods, coupled with multi-objective optimisation, will be key for the optimisation of complete PtMeOH processes.448 Other computer-aided methods are available and have been recently reviewed by Martín and Adams449 and Mencarelli et al.404 These include superstructure-free methodologies such as that presented by Neveux450 and Zhang et al.,442 and the building block-based superstructure method presented by Demirel et al.,451 which can be applied to achieve new and improved power-to-methanol process designs. They are particularly fitting because PtMeOH is still at an early stage of exploration with high possibilities for improved configuration(s) or topology options.404 These methods also eliminate redundant components or the need to predefine the superstructure, since its definition may exclude the optimal alternative or include infeasible solutions.404 Another state-of-the-art superstructure-free synthesis multi-objective optimisation methodology was presented in the work of Wang et al.,452 which can be adapted and used for PtMeOH, even though it was initially devised for thermal power plants. Peng et al.453 also presented a method relevant for application in the PtMeOH process based on solar and wind to treat the multiple time scale variabilities and achieve a better design, synthesis and optimisation of the system, rather than using conventional methodologies, which are based on multi-period/multi-scenario optimisation. This approach can help cater for off-design operation points and minimise the possibility of over-design.
It is important to highlight that developments in synthesis and optimisation methods will continue to play a crucial role and thus applying new methodologies for the re-evaluation of these process should not cease. These developments must be tied with realistic improvements in materials (e.g. catalysts) and critical components (e.g. electrolyser stack). It is also crucial that the simultaneous optimisation of reactor and catalyst designs via multiscale modelling and integration are synchronised with complete process intensification and optimisation. Multi-scale modelling will be beneficial to improve PtMeOH. A closely related study by Onel et al.,454 using surrogate models, proposed a method to integrate CFD modelling, process synthesis and global optimisation to generate optimal process topology. To the best of our knowledge, no known work in this regard for overall PtMeOH optimisation has been performed. Real-life data, e.g. from the long-term operation of renewable energy-based plants, will play a critical role in this aspect. Again, convergence and optimum solutions must be achieved with reasonable computational power and time. An advanced open-source method/tool/code, in this field, is required.432


6.3.2 Evaluation criteria. 

Table 14 highlights the advantages and limitations of the key and commonly used evaluation criteria. Apart from energy efficiency, production efficiencies, CO2 emissions/avoidance cost, the levelised cost of storage and conventional techno-economics criteria (e.g. pay-back time, etc.), exergy analysis is increasingly being used.2,23,245,447,455–457 Exergy analysis can be tied to the economics of a process, hence the term ‘exergo-economics’. The other versatile criteria is the entropy generation rate minimisation, which offers the opportunity to optimise designs or configurations by integrating the first and second law of thermodynamics with the constructal law. Von Storch et al.458 noted the limitations of the evaluation criteria (such as energy and exergy efficiency), and proposed and tested a new evaluation criterion, i.e. efficiency of energy substitution (EES). The EES criterion was able to determine the practical and purpose-driven optimal configuration. Hence, the criterion was deduced as useful for hybrid processes with one or more products. Other relevant criteria are evaluated in the work of Colla et al.457 Improvements in the fundamental understanding of the process, from material and equipment to the process scale (i.e. multi-scale), shall coincide with redefining these parameters and/or adding better expressions or new performance criteria. Other metrics to be considered may include environmental metrics such as toxicity levels, sustainability metrics like the availability of resources, supply chain, resilience and social issues such as the potential job and economic development impact and safety with scale.6,449,459

Energy efficiency
- Simple and useful approach in all energy using industries
- Variable definitions exist and exclude exergy efficiencies/quality of energy

- With increase in process complexity, the results using this criterion may be misleading, e.g. when two products of different kinds (methanol and electricity) are produced in the process


Exergy efficiency
- Expedient approach that renders it possible to compare different interactions, i.e. input, output, work and heat, on a common ground

- Considers the quality of energy
- Neglects high exergy destructive, but economically cheap units such as the valves during process synthesis and optimisation


- Pinpoints the thermodynamic inefficiencies within the system, processes and components with high irreversibility, which are target areas for improvement
- Still controversial if it is best applicable in processes with solar radiation and cannot optimise the design and operating variables, but only guides towards location, magnitude and source/availability of inefficiencies


- Challenges with estimating endogenous exergy destructions, since the theoretically operated components are treated as a black box and needs to be balanced and justified by economics


- Some inefficiencies are unavoidable due to physical and economic constraints


Energy savings ratio
- Straightforward approach to compare the optimised process to the reference system
- Treats different forms of energy as one; for example, biomass-derived energy, which can be easy to store – compared to solar-derived energy, which is different due to its variability. These forms of energies will be treated as the same, and may lead to non-practical results

458 and 461

- Requires knowledge of the reference process performance


Exergo-economics/specific exergy costing (SPECO)

Efficiency of energy substitution
- Useful for hybrid processes with one or more products, e.g. heat, power and chemicals
- Requires knowledge of the fuel consumption of the reference process

458



- Provides a better comparison of the process of interest (e.g. to a reference system), while being goal oriented
- Only one input is allowed to differ between the process of interest and the reference process





6.4 Techno-economic, environmental and incentives analyses

Table 15 highlights numerous PtMeOH techno-economic studies conducted in various geographic locations and markets.466 However, even though they are difficult to compare, they offer some insights. Most studies consider all the major process steps. However, assumptions are variant, except in a few cases, such as the annual operation hours of the plant (AOP), which assumes an almost full load operation scenario (≈7200–8000 hours per year). Based on the latter, most of these studies define or quantify technical and economically feasible scenarios, such as the selling price of methanol, electricity price, cost of major equipment (such as the electrolyser), AOP, etc. However, these are mostly location- and technology-dependent. Ouda et al.466 and Hank et al.467 evaluated scenarios to increase market adoption (in a German market) of methanol and associated ecological aspects. Four different system dynamics, as deduced in Fig. 10, were considered. Electric power was derived from a wind farm, and compared to that purchased from the grid. A reduction in the cost of the electrolyser, amendment of taxation systems or policy instruments, the CO2 from biogas or ammonia plant, credit arising from CO2 trading, a variation in the electricity production and cost, and the temporal H2 storage size were considered. The authors deduced that the feasibility of the process is strongly affected by electricity, H2 production and CO2 costs, methanol reactor dynamics (hence the H2 storage requirements) and AOP.

 Fig. 10  Possible scenarios of PtMeOH. Reproduced from Hank et al.467 with permission from Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Kourkoumpas et al.468 evaluated the techno-economics of the PtMeOH and revealed that the process becomes more competitive at larger scale of the plant, longer AOP of the production, lower electricity cost, and low cost of CO2. Baak et al.469 evaluated the techno-economics of a novel, zero-emission methanol synthesis process, encompassing different power generation units (see Table 13), and deduced that the more efficient (∼30.2%) and cost-effective system is the trans-critical CO2 gas turbine (tCO2-GT). Pérez-Fortes et al.26 deduced that the cost of compression, followed by that of a heat exchanger network, are higher for methanol synthesis. Szima and Cormos429 evaluated the energetically self-sufficient PtMeOH process, and deduced that the heat exchanger network is the main contributor to the capital cost, followed by the compression unit. Reznicek and Braun85 evaluated the techno-economics and trade-off designs of the ReSOC process and pointed that more work is needed to reduce the equipment capital cost, increasing unit – and hence system efficiency, and the optimisation of stack parameters such as pressure, stack current density, stack fuel utilisation and balance of plant components (e.g. compression), to reduce costs.
Wang et al.24 evaluated the operating window of the SOEC stack and techno-economics of the SOEC-based PtMeOH process, operating on steam and co-electrolysis, and reported that the capital cost of a small-scale plant is dominated by the auxiliary equipment cost (e.g. compression stages). For larger plants, the SOEC contributed a large portion of the total capital cost of the system (65–75%).24 The authors pointed out that decreasing the electricity price (or access to free electricity) and increasing the operation hours and stack life (as a function of stack operating temperature) could make the plant operation economically attractive. They emphasised access to free electricity and, as a result, deduced that, even if the plant AOP is reduced (e.g. to 1000 hours per year), the plant can still be economically feasible and benefit from fewer electrolyser stack replacements. They further proposed two operation strategies. The first strategy was to set the electrolyser operating, inlet and outlet temperatures equal, and reduce the current density when required to maintain the temperature below 870 °C. The second strategy was to set the electrolyser inlet and outlet temperatures equal below 870 °C, and reduce only the electrolyser inlet temperature to 750 °C if the both outlet and inlet temperatures exceed 870 °C. The first strategy was found to be preferable since it reduced the temperature gradient between inlet and outlet temperatures, and increased the system efficiency. Zhang et al.428 performed a techno-economic optimisation study for a SOEC-based power-to-methanol process, considering process integration, techno-economics and multi-objective (efficiency and production cost) optimisation. Their results showed a payback time of 13 years. The authors observed that economic performance is a strong function of the SOEC stack cost, electricity price and methanol selling price.
Taking advantage of synergies, Zhang et al.430 compared the techno-economics of steam- and co-electrolysis-based PtMeOH, both integrated with methanol synthesis. They deduced that co-electrolysis-based processes are attractive from an economic point of view with higher annual operation hours and flexibility, whereas biomass-to-methanol with steam electrolysis is highly dependent on the dynamics of renewable electricity. However, the impact of limited biomass availability needs to be factored in as well. From an environmental and techno-economic perspective, interesting results from the study of González-Garay et al.,470 which considered a plant-to-planet analysis of green methanol via using a planetary boundaries tool, discussed that the potential damage that green methanol can cause to freshwater use, nitrogen and phosphorous flow are negligible when compared to the positive effects it will have on energy imbalances, CO2 emission reduction and ocean acidification. The authors further deduced the impact of various components on the techno-economic performance of the process, and highlighted that hydrogen production is the major economic bottleneck that is making the process unfeasible, indicating that more work and subsidies are needed in this direction. Alternatively, improving the carbon capture technologies and introducing a carbon tax of at least 430.50 US$ per t per CO2 per eq. could make the process attractive and it is the second-most important task. The effects of catalyst improvements (e.g. increasing the catalysts efficiency at a pressure <50 bar) will become more dominant (∼24.4% share of total costs) when PtMeOH is already economically feasible, indicating that this is less urgent in the short term than reducing both the hydrogen production and CO2 capture costs.470 From incentives and a policy decision perspective, Afzali437 evaluated the role of power-to-methanol in the energy mix. From the authors' simulation and data obtained from interviewing energy experts, Afzali437 concluded that regional incentives, including the availability of feedstock and land, are the most important factors. On the other hand, PtMeOH is affected by hard and soft institutions, i.e. coherence and conformity to regulatory frameworks. However, incentives from knowledge infrastructure and soft institutions have not been investigated enough. Furthermore, as Afzali437 highlighted, incentives generated from the societal network pertaining to the technology, the structure of actors and policy conformity considering the regulatory framework of implementing PtMeOH deserve further investigation. In addition, the study pointed out that, in order to address financial and market barriers, bilateral contracts, e.g. taking advantage of regional incentives, in particular where multi-regions are involved, the formation of consortia between interested parties, etc. could be attractive incentives to push the green methanol economy and must be evaluated.471 For the interested reader, the work of Afzali437 and Darmani et al.471 gives a good introductory and categorised analysis of these incentives and others, including incentives for actors and network incentives. It is also crucial to highlight that incentives associated with renewable power and hydrogen production, CO2 abatements and supply chain will play a major role in making PtMeOH economically attractive. On the other hand, incentives devised specifically to support PtMeOH, considering its characteristics, could play a positive role.
PtMeOH is currently not economically feasible in most regions. However, the literature is consistent in the parameters that hold significant impact in the profitability of PtMeOH plants, i.e. maximise to full load AOP, lower electricity cost, increase (2 to 3.5 times more than the current) methanol selling price or introduce carbon tax, lower the electrolyser stack cost and increase its lifetime (e.g. >90000 hours). Few studies consider system dynamics, and hence more work is needed here. In addition, other cost-savings from prospective services that these processes may provide to the electricity grid, such as stability, load following, etc., must be incorporated and the associated operation strategies must be developed.28 More work is required that compares the techno-economic assumptions, system dynamics, single/multiple market dynamics and the associated uncertainties/risks.472 Integration of market models (e.g. for hydrogen and methanol) will improve the economics analysis, and therefore assist policy decision making by taking advantage of the potential positive (push) dynamics. In addition, PtMEOH should also be evaluated in the form of energy/CCU/H2 hubs. Demonstration projects and transparency in data sharing are needed to improve the techno-economics of PtMeOH processes, particularly for non-mature technologies such as SOEC-based processes. These studies should also couple economics and life-cycle analysis with the explicit consideration of political, societal and environmental aspects.
7. Conclusions
Methanol will play a crucial role in future as a carbon capture and utilisation solution, variable-renewable energy chemical storage medium, and in chemical and transportation industries as an intermediate and a blend, respectively. This paper provided a thorough review of the power-to-methanol process, considering elementary aspects, technologies and system perspectives. From an elementary perspective, power to methanol is limited by exothermicity, thermodynamic equilibrium, kinetics/inconclusive reaction mechanism, large water formation, the RWGS as the main side reaction and high activation energy of CO2. Complex limitations include low single-pass conversion (particularly for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol), low-medium energetic efficiency, equipment flexibility requirements, poor catalyst selectivity and limited adaptation to dynamic operating conditions, high cost of attractive electrolyser stack, electrolyser stack degradation, and availability of cheap renewable electricity sources, CO2 source and favourable incentives. This review has pointed out several research efforts and gaps related to these critical aspects.
Alkaline electrolysis technologies are relatively cheaper than other electrolysis technologies, but less adapted for integration with variable renewable energy sources. The PEM electrolyser is well adapted for integration with variable solar and wind energy sources. However, the SOEC-based technologies can be more advantageous to consider for integration with exothermic reactions such as methanol, especially with its capability to perform both H2O and CO2 co-electrolysis, and thus it must be optimised for integration with variable renewable energy sources. The SOEC technologies use non-noble metals, which make them further attractive relative to PEM electrolysis technologies. Continued demonstration of these technologies will play a key role, and the findings will help improve electrolyser and reactor design and modelling. It is also not concluded in literature as to which electrolysis technology is the winner in the context of PtMeOH. Besides, there exists a need for an improved understanding of electrolyser(s), CO2 capture technology and methanol reactor and catalyst flexibilities assessing effective operation windows/strategies, start-up and shut down requirements and long-term degradations under dynamic conditions. From design perspectives, electrolysers, particularly SOEC and ReSOC, must be optimised by reducing their cost (e.g. from materials, cell and stack to system level), improving their stack durability, compactness, efficiency and flexibility. Improvements in the CO2 capture technologies are also required, for example reduction in the energy penalty and assessment and optimisation of CO2 capture technologies from sustainable sources (e.g. DAC) and finding cost effective sorbents and hybrid solutions. Catalyst optimisation should be directed towards increasing conversion and selectivity at lower temperature and pressure conditions, as well as tolerance to poisons, e.g. water and reactor inlet dynamics. Reactor design must be optimised by improving its heat dissipation capability, its flow field to enhance conversion and its flexibility at reasonable costs. Efforts in these directions must be supported by advanced (e.g. multiscale) modelling techniques and experimentation.
Evaluation of the overall process modelling studies showed that variable renewable energy-powered co-electrolysis-derived syngas conversion to methanol has higher energy efficiency than the direct CO2 hydrogenation route with hydrogen derived from electrolysis (see Sections 2 and 6). However, the direct CO2 hydrogenation route is attractive from an environmental perspective, and simplifies the reactor design (low hot spot formation) and downstream methanol separation. On the other hand, process synthesis and intensification, taking into account relevant details to perform multi-objective analyses of trade-offs and non-trade-offs, and optimisation of the topology design of the overall power-to-methanol are required. Dynamic system operation strategies stand a chance to be beneficial to the overall system and improve the system efficiency. Therefore, they should be analysed and optimised to maximise the plant operation time and profitability, among others. It will be essential to also study this from a microgrid (especially with the ReSOC-based systems) perspective, and to consider various uncertainties. One-pot processes that combine electrolysis (steam- or co-electrolysis) and methanol synthesis in a single unit are also a new paradigm shift that is supported by process intensification goals and is attractive for distributed applications, but need further investigation, e.g. transport phenomena and the associated interactions, economics, etc. The continued model-based assessment of PtMeOH processes and subsequent demonstrations will provide valuable insight into the effects of – but not limited to – current trends in renewable energy prices, equipment cost, catalyst activity, process efficiencies and market price of methanol, social/environmental and political dynamics, on the viability of PtMeOH as a whole. It is necessary to apply life cycle thinking in process design and optimisation, and viable synergies/cohesions and diversities should be explored. Should PtMeOH become economically feasible by any means, e.g. government push on the subsiding cost of electrolysers, the implementation of new policies on electricity generation/pricing and carbon tax; the lack of detailed understanding of aspects such as reaction mechanisms, though a requirement for further optimisation, shall not limit the immediate application of power-to-methanol since it will provide crucial advantages both to the environment and technically to the energy systems. On the other hand, noting the variation in methanol prices, it remains a question whether developing one-pot processes in which the feed is converted to methanol, and methanol is further processed to other value-added products in one step, provided they are made technically feasible, will have a higher economic advantage and assist in responding advantageously to market sensitivities.
7.1. Further opportunities for innovations
Opportunities for attractive business cases and innovation must be explored in the following areas as well:
• Integration of power-to-methanol process into existing/new infrastructures, e.g. CO2-emitting petrochemical plants and, for the purpose of reject-heat and waste-H2 utilisation to produce methanol, e.g. as a combination with renewable electrolysis-derived hydrogen or during variable renewable energy downtimes, will enhance the attractiveness of implementing renewables in industry. Flexibility, resilience and reliability become key design philosophies to consider in this regard, in addition to maximising profit, as coupled system complexity and unpredictability increase. Investigation of methanol production using combination of low-cost hydrogen production methods, such as the so called Aqua-hydrogen (recently discussed in the work of Yu et al.476) and others such as biogas reforming is required.
• Coupling catalysts morphological changes to design and control the reactor in the process will be a key novelty to improve the understanding of the interaction between the catalytic activity and the reactants' flow field. In particular, the concept of catalyst shape changes, which affects its activity presents opportunities. Additionally, is the propagation of reactor dynamics e.g. from one stage to the next.
• Regenerative-condensing reactors that provide dual function, i.e. condense methanol in situ, while regenerating catalyst activity at a cheaper cost and using a specific solvent, which can be easily separated from the product solution and with the flexibility and resilience required for methanol synthesis, particularly under dynamic conditions, will be key, and the appropriate solvents and reactor design are required.
• On the other hand, a new and improved method of catalyst design using process synthesis or process system engineering techniques, coupled with techno-economics, optimisation and molecular level knowledge (e.g. of catalysts' morphology, active sites, deactivation, etc.) or models will be a key novelty to meet the individual process goals for different feedstocks and processes, and further offer opportunities to reduce the capital and operation costs of the processes.
• Other opportunities include utilising additive manufacturing to design 3D-structured and extended surface catalysts and reactor technologies, and use of process intensification techniques such as reactive distillation processes.477,478
This paper offers necessary insight and gaps in a holistic manner to researchers and engineers working in the field. Collaborations among researchers, engineers in the field, and policy makers is required to close the gap towards commercialisation.

Fully decoupled	- Known operation (conventional processes operated at steady state provides a wealth of experience)	- Typically uses (large) battery storage/hydrogen storage facility, which increases the costs of the plant
- High equipment utilisation i.e. design capacity/average capacity ≈1	- Lower overall efficiency, e.g. with addition of battery (discharge efficiency <100% and lower voltage during discharge) and/or compression necessary for intermediate tank storage of hydrogen
Partially coupled/decoupled	- May be relevant for operation where, e.g. standby mode is relevant; in case certain equipment cannot be shut down due to longer start-up time	- Not yet explored significantly
- Reduced battery capacity	- Battery may still be needed and therefore increase costs and reduce efficiency
Fully coupled	- No battery storage and/or no high level of rectification of variable energy sources required	- Clarity on the best operation mode is limited as conventional plants are typically operated under steady state
- Higher overall efficiency	- Reduced process equipment utilisation, i.e. design capacity/average capacity >2

Steady-state (full load) integration and evaluation

Power-to-methanol	HT-SOEC, methanol synthesis and purification	Techno-economics, pinch point analysis, 2D model for stack used for analyses of operating windows and thus select design points to be applied as basis for system comparison	- Energy integration, efficiency evaluation, techno-economics and analyses of operation window that minimise stack degradation	- Co-electrolysis and increased sweep gas extend the stack operating window	
24

- Comparison of power-to-methanol, with Fischer–Tropsch, power-to-gasoline and power-to-hydrogen	- Co-electrolysis allows better heat integration and can improve the efficiency of a mildly exothermic reaction like methanol synthesis
Power-to-methanol	Electrolyser(s), methanol synthesis and purification	The routes compared include the following: one-step process (electrolysis and methanol synthesis combined in one reactor), direct steam electrolysis to methanol via CO2 hydrogenation, separate H2O and CO2 electrolysers coupled with methanol synthesis via syngas, used black box modelling	- Compare conceptual designs of power-to-methanol from a techno-economic and life-cycle perspective	- Currently only direct steam electrolysis to methanol via CO2 hydrogen is technically feasible	
434

- One-step process is still on laboratory scale
- Power-to-methanol is environmentally compelling
Power-to-methanol coupled with its conversion to chemical intermediates and products	Electrolysis, methanol synthesis reactor, CO2 and H2 as feed, and chemical intermediates synthesis and purification sections	Methanol conversion to acetic acid, DMC, formalin, DME, biodiesel and MTBE are compared, a waste-reduction algorithm is used as a tool to evaluate the environmental aspects	- Compare methanol conversion to chemical intermediates highlighted and products from a technical and environmental point of view	- Conversion of methanol to biodiesel and MTBE are the most attractive routes from a technical and environmental point of view with low overall energy consumption	
433

- DMC and DME are not convenient from a technical point of view
Power-to-methanol to jet fuels	Alkaline electrolysis, CO2 captured via absorption with monoethalamine, methanol synthesis, conversion to jet fuels and purifications	Rigorous techno-economics and environmental analysis, black-box simulations (Aspen)	- Evaluate power-to-methanol as a precursor in jet fuels from an environmental and techno-economic point of view	- Net production costs of jet fuels from this process are 2.9–4.6 times higher than the current market price	
435

- Flue gas from refineries has significant carbon capture potential and can yield 83 kt jet fuel per year
- Power-to-methanol avoids 2.50 kg per CO2 per eq. per kg
Power-to-methanol coupled to ethanol distilleries	Electrolysis, CO2 is sourced from ethanol industrial distillery (∼99% purity), bagasse (electricity and thermal source) and methanol production unit	Methanol synthesis is coupled with ethanol distillery, bagasse is used to co-generate energy (heat via boiled steam, and electricity), and factorial design is used to obtain the surface responses	- Methanol coupled with ethanol plant to generate attractive CO2 utilisation hub	- Using co-generated energy, the challenge of high energy requirements mainly introduced by the electrolysis step can be overcome	
436

- Maximise profit, energy efficiency and reduce operating costs	- In this process and considering extreme scenarios, methanol and oxygen generates 4.5 times more profits than electricity sales, and 8.8 for the sale of oxygen and hydrogen
Power-to-methanol integrated with larger energy-mix power grid systems (low and high flexible grids)	Power grid (with renewable solar and wind integration), water electrolysis and methanol synthesis	An agent-based model developed to explore future scenarios of deploying power-to-methanol in low and high-flexibility grid systems	- The influence of power-to-methanol in grid reliability and CO2 reduction	- Deploying power-to-methanol has a significant influence on the grid reliability	
437

- The desired state in power grid is to have a constant grid balance close to zero	- Power-to-methanol helps hold the renewable grid balance from increasing indefinitely and thus maintain better conditions for the grid
- Significant CO2 reduction can be achieved by deploying power-to-methanol
- It is not recommended to invest in power-to-methanol until the grid has significant renewable power integrated
Power-to-methanol integrated with biomass and DME synthesis	HT-SOEC, biomass, entrained-flow gasifier, acid gas removal (CO2 capture), water-gas shift reactor (used to generate syngas during renewable electricity downtimes), methanol synthesis, DME synthesis (via methanol dehydration), heat exchanger and steam turbine networks, distillation units	Aspen-based models(with black box description of some components) used to simulate the system, heat and mass integration formulated in mixed integer linear programming problem (considering electrical heater, syngas burner and steam turbine network), classical hot–cold and grand composite curves are used to evaluate heat integration	- Techno-economics, energy efficiency with consideration of system-level heat integration	- Integration of co-electrolysis-to-methanol with biomass gasification offers more operational flexibility, thus high annual production hours	
430

- Biomass- to-DME only reaches 49% efficiency, as a result of additional heat demand (i.e. not heat self-sufficiency) mainly due to high heat requirements for DME purification
- Increased system complexity increases exergy destruction and thus lowers the energy efficiency

406

- Increases in the amount of CO2 in the feed up 5% (w/w) narrows the feasible region to increase methanol production
Power-to-methanol	Wind energy and solar energy, alkaline electrolyser, methanol synthesis reactor, purification system	Multi-period design of solar and wind-based methanol production facilities under uncertainty. Seasonality of energy resources is addressed via multi-period modelling, uncertainty in solar and wind energy is modelled using a two-stage stochastic approach, surrogate models are used for modelling the production process	- Design of process under uncertainty	- Source availability and uncertainty needs to be considered in process design	
445

- Trade-offs related to idle equipment with large equipment cost are evaluated	- The initial tempting decision is typically to invest in the methanol capacity depending on the capacity of the solar or wind, which are variable, however, care must be ensured to minimise having equipment idle most of the time in the year
- An attractive scenario for solar-based plants is to ensure that a fraction of electricity is sold while the other is used for the production of chemicals


Optimisation-based studies

Power-to-methanol via steam electrolysis and CO2	HT-SOEC, methanol synthesis and purification	- Bi-objective optimisation	- Techno-economic optimisation	- There is a trade-off between the energy efficiency and methanol production cost	
428

- Minimum cost design and maximum efficiency design points are used for system-level integration comparison	- Process integration and energy efficiency optimisation	- System efficiency high (∼70%)
- Pinch point analysis and black box modelling	- The choice of SOEC operating conditions affects heat management of the system
- Steady state
Power-to-methanol via co-electrolysis to methanol	HT-SOEC for co-electrolysis, methanol synthesis and purification	- Bi-objective optimisation	- Techno-economic optimisation	- The system achieves higher efficiency (∼72%)	
43

- Minimum cost design and maximum efficiency design points are used for system-level integration comparison	- Process integration and energy efficiency optimisation	- There is a trade-off between the energy efficiency and the methanol production cost
- Pinch point analysis	- SOEC operating in co-electrolysis and integrated with exothermic methanol has attractive heat integration performance
- Black box modelling using Aspen	- Large amount of heat generated from the methanol synthesis can meet steam generation demands for SOEC without requiring external heat
- Steady state	- Excess heat can be recovered using steam turbine for the co-production of electricity
Power-to-methanol via steam electrolysis and CO2	Off-shore wind, AWE, PEM and SOEC electrolyser, CO2 cement factory, methanol synthesis and upgrading step	Simplified superstructure-based optimisation via bi-criterion objectives, steady state	- CO2 emission (life cycle) and economics as bi-objectives	- Utilising renewable electricity in PtMeOH contributes to positive abatement of CO2 emission (−2.29 tCO2/tMeOH) with minimum net production costs of 1346 € per t of methanol	
439

Power-to-methanol	Electrolysis, methanol synthesis and purification	Scheduling optimisation time horizon of a year and a monthly time discretisation, with dynamics on solar and wind availability on an hourly basis, methanol is compared to ammonia, DME, etc.	- Assess the optimal plant and transport network, analyses of oversized capacity required under dynamic conditions	- With scheduling optimisation, a large fraction of methanol can be produced in summer (via solar) and consumed in winter (to meet the electricity demand)	
446

Power-to-methanol with self-heat recuperators	Self-recuperative co-electrolysis, methanol synthesis, purification	- Metaheuristic rigorous optimisation vortex search strategyused to optimise benefits of recuperators as retrofits	- Optimise the energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and methanol production	- Electrochemical system of co-electrolysis has the highest exergy destruction rate (∼accounts for total exergy loss of 82%), followed by coolers (49% of remaining 18%)	
440

- Each objective is optimised at one point in time, i.e. objectives are not simultaneously optimised	- Optimisation of self-heat recuperative-based co-electrolysis using vortex search strategy reduces the exergy loss (hence improves energy efficiency) by 61.7% and improves the methanol production
- Steady state

Energy efficiency	- Simple and useful approach in all energy using industries	- Variable definitions exist and exclude exergy efficiencies/quality of energy	
245 and 458
- With increase in process complexity, the results using this criterion may be misleading, e.g. when two products of different kinds (methanol and electricity) are produced in the process
Exergy efficiency	- Expedient approach that renders it possible to compare different interactions, i.e. input, output, work and heat, on a common ground	- The use of a Carnot cycle results in the over-estimation of heat	
455,458 and 460
- Considers the quality of energy	- Neglects high exergy destructive, but economically cheap units such as the valves during process synthesis and optimisation
- Pinpoints the thermodynamic inefficiencies within the system, processes and components with high irreversibility, which are target areas for improvement	- Still controversial if it is best applicable in processes with solar radiation and cannot optimise the design and operating variables, but only guides towards location, magnitude and source/availability of inefficiencies
- Challenges with estimating endogenous exergy destructions, since the theoretically operated components are treated as a black box and needs to be balanced and justified by economics
- Some inefficiencies are unavoidable due to physical and economic constraints
Energy savings ratio	- Straightforward approach to compare the optimised process to the reference system	- Treats different forms of energy as one; for example, biomass-derived energy, which can be easy to store – compared to solar-derived energy, which is different due to its variability. These forms of energies will be treated as the same, and may lead to non-practical results	
458 and 461
- Easy to apply in poly-generation systems	- Requires knowledge of the reference process performance
Exergo-economics/specific exergy costing (SPECO)	- Detailed understanding of costs related to equipment, thermodynamic inefficiencies and their interconnections	- Cannot optimise the design and operating variables, but can only guide the investigator	
462, 463 and 464
- Gives guidance on how and where to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of the system	- Cannot automatically and algorithmically generate structural alternatives
- Possibility to decompose and optimise individual components of the whole system and SPECO is easily applied
Entropy generation minimisation rate	- Versatile thermodynamics optimisation criteria for exergy analysis and its interfaces with heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics	- Complex compared to energy efficiency	
423, 460 and 465
- Allows the creation of realistic models that account for irreversibility, which is inherent in the systems/process
- Can give optimal configuration/topology/allocation of resources via consideration of constructal thermodynamics
Efficiency of energy substitution	- Useful for hybrid processes with one or more products, e.g. heat, power and chemicals	- Requires knowledge of the fuel consumption of the reference process	
458

- Provides a better comparison of the process of interest (e.g. to a reference system), while being goal oriented	- Only one input is allowed to differ between the process of interest and the reference process
