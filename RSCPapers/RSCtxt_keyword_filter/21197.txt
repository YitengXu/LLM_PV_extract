    , Accepted 20th September 2011First published on 20th October 2011AbstractNanocomposite, 15-crown-5-functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (denoted as MWCNT-15-C-5) were synthesized and used as an additive along with the ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) in the electrolyte of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC); the pertinent quasi-solid-state DSSC showed a far superior photovoltaic performance than that of a cell with bare EMIBF4 or with MWCNT-added EMIBF4 (MWCNT/EMIBF4). The heterocyclic structure of the crown ether, 15-C-5, provides its cavities to capture the lithium ions (Li+) in a DSSC, thereby facilitating the dissolution of Li+ and I− in the electrolyte of the cell. This further contributes to an improvement in the exchange reaction of I−/I3− in the electrolyte with EMIBF4. Consequently, the values of short-circuit current density (JSC) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC with both EMIBF4 and MWCNT-15-C-5 in its electrolyte showed an increase from 3.23 ± 0.30 to 5.53 ± 0.38 mA cm−2 and from 1.52 ± 0.04 to 2.11 ± 0.10%, respectively, with reference to the values of a DSSC with bare EMIBF4. Moreover, the at-rest durability of this quasi-solid-state DSSC was found to be unfailing for a period of 1200 h at 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Explanations are substantiated with Raman spectra, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
1. Introduction
Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)1 are very important and interesting fillers, owing to their high flexibility, low density, and large aspect ratio. They display unique mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, and flexible properties; for this reason they are used in several ways, e.g., in nanocomposites,2–4electrodes,5,6 sensors,7,8 and electrolytes.9 Surface-oxidized MWCNTs can be used as scaffolds to load metal ions on them; this is a way to enhance the electrochemical property of the MWCNT.10 Intensive research has been carried out in recent past for the surface modification of MWCNTs, intending to improve the compatibilities and dispersing abilities of the tubes in organic solvents or polymer matrixes.11–13
It is well known that the performance of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is best only when a liquid electrolyte is used. However, the commercialization of these cells was impeded owing to technological problems related to hermetic sealing, the precipitation of salts at low temperature and the evaporation of liquids at high temperature. Replacing the liquid electrolyte in a DSSC with a solid or quasi-solid electrolyte is expected to make the cell viable. Usage of ionic liquid (IL) in the electrolyte is one of the strategies to replace the liquid electrolyte in a DSSC. ILs hold superior properties such as non-volatility, non-flammability, and wide electrochemical window. ILs are used extensively in electrochemistry, e.g., in bio-electrochemistry, electrochemical sensors, lithium batteries, photo electrochemical cells, electro-deposition of metals, semi-conductors, and polymers.14 ILs based on imidazolium salts have been widely used as solvents in DSSCs.15,16 A recent review has described the developments in the applications of ILs, containing substituted imidazolium salts, as solvents or components of liquid and quasi-solid electrolytes for DSSCs.17 Nevertheless, the relatively high viscosity and thereby the associated transport limitation of this type of imidazolium ILs appear to limit their applications. The apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of the redox-couple, iodide (I−) and tri-iodide (I3−), in an IL electrolyte are about 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in a volatile organic solvent.18 Consequently, the ability of the reduced form of the redox-couple (I−) to reduce the oxidized dye, D+, in a DSSC with an IL electrolyte is limited, especially at high illumination intensities; this situation causes a lowering of the overall performance of such a DSSC. One of the strategies to overcome this problem is to synthesize low viscous ILs. Another way is to enhance the diffusion of I− and I3− in an IL electrolyte. A Grotthuss-like mechanism was discussed for the electron-transport between I− and I3− in fluoro organic-based ILs.19 Kawano and Watanabe have indicated that an exchange reaction-based diffusion (Dex) dominates in a whole process of charge-transport at high concentrations of I−/I3− in an IL electrolyte.20 This seems to be a reason for the improved charge-transport in fluoro organic ILs, in spite of their high viscosity.
It has been reported that crown ethers (CEs) display the ability of capturing lithium ions (Li+) in the electrolyte of a quasi-solid-state DSSC.21,22 This ability of a CE, when used in a quasi-solid-state DSSC with an IL electrolyte, favors an increase in the power-conversion efficiency (η) of the cell. This manuscript represents the first report on the synthesis of a novel inorganic/organic nanocomposite, containing both MWCNT and 15-crown-5 (15-C-5) (designated as MWCNT-15-C-5), and its incorporation in a DSSC. The nanocomposite and an IL, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4), were incorporated in the electrolyte of a DSSC; the performance of the thus fabricated quasi-solid-state DSSC with the electrolyte containing the nanocomposite and EMIBF4 (MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4) is compared with those of the cells with the electrolytes containing bare EMIBF4 or MWCNT and EMIBF4 together (MWCNT/EMIBF4). We focused on the study of the ability of this synthesized MWCNT-15-C-5 for trapping the Li+ and gave less importance for enhancing the performance of the DSSC.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, O.D. = 10–15 nm, I.D. = 2–6 nm, length = 0.1–10 μm, >90%), 2-(aminomethyl)-15-crown-5 (15-C-5-NH2, 95%), and nitric acid (HNO3, 65%) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) was received from Riesel-deHaën. Anhydrous lithium iodide (LiI), iodine (I2), acetonitrile (AN) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw = 20000) were received from Merck. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, +98%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), tert-butanol (tBuOH, 99.5%), and 15-crown-5 (15-C-5, 98%) were obtained from Acros. Methanol (MeOH, 95%) was received from ECHO Chemical Co. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4, ≥98%) is a commercial product purchased from Aldrich. Ethyl-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) was bought from TCI. The fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (FTO, surface resistance = 7 Ω sq−1, TEC-7) was bought from Hartford Glass Co., Inc., Hartford City, Indiana, USA.
2.2. Preparation of 15-crown-5-functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-15-C-5)
The MWCNTs (1 g) were added into a two-neck, round-bottom flask containing 25 mL of HNO3. Before the start of the reaction, the system was set in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min; then the reactants were allowed to react further under reflux in an oil bath for 1 day. The resultant mixture was poured into excess of deionized water, followed by filtering it through a 0.22 μm PVDF membrane and washing it by a large amount of deionized water (to maintain pH value of 7.0 for the filtrate). The collected solid was dried under vacuum; acid-treated MWCNT (MWCNT-COOH) was thus obtained. The MWCNT-COOH (0.2 g) was further reacted with an excess of SOCl2 (10 mL) under reflux for 1 day. The residual SOCl2 was removed by a reduced-pressure distillation process. Immediately, 15-C-5-NH2 and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, J. T. Baker) were injected into the system, and the system was maintained at 60 °C for 2 days. After washing the contents by excess of THF and drying under vacuum, the final product of MWCNT-15-C-5 was obtained.
2.3. Preparation of dye-adsorbed photoanode and DSSC assembly

          TiO2 was converted from TTIP in a media, based on 0.1 M HNO3 solution, by using a sol–gel method. A hydrothermal treatment was then performed in an autoclave at 240 °C for 12 h. A nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was obtained by concentrating the autoclaved solution to 13 wt%. Then, 30 wt% of PEG, corresponding to the TiO2 content, was added into the paste, intending to enhance the necking of TiO2 particles and to control the porosity of TiO2. The photoanode was prepared by depositing the TiO2 paste on an FTO glass, using the doctor-blade technique, and by annealing the TiO2-coated FTO at 450 °C for 30 min. The projective area of TiO2 was shaved to be 0.16 cm2. The photoanode was then immersed in a 0.1 mM solution of CYC-B1123 in the mixture of AN and tBuOH (v/v = 1/1) at room temperature for 24 h; 20 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, ≧95%, Sigma-Aldrich) was also added as a coadsorbent. The dye-coated photoanode was then coupled with a transparent platinum (Pt) counter electrode. The counter electrode was prepared by sputtering Pt on an ITO substrate (surface resistance = 10 Ω sq−1, UR-ITO007-0.7mm, Uni-onward Corp., Taiwan); the distance between the photoanode and the counter electrode was controlled by a Surlyn of 60 μm in thickness. Finally, an electrolyte was prepared by adding 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP to a 1:1 (v/v) MeOH/EMIBF4 solution containing, where applicable, 0.05 wt% (relative to EMIBF4) of pristine MWCNTs or MWCNT-15-C-5; the contents were stirred for 12 h. After removing MeOH under 10−2 mm Hg for 24 h, the MeOH-free EMIBF4-based electrolyte was injected through the gap remained between the photoanode and the counter electrode by the capillary effect.
2.4. Instrumentation

Raman spectra were recorded by a Dimension-P2 Raman system (Lamba Solution, Inc.). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained by a spectrum 100 PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Inc.). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was accomplished by using PHI 5000 Versaprobe ULVAC-PHI, and the background pressure in analysis chamber was controlled at 10−5 Pa. High resolution transmission electron microscopic (HR-TEM) images were obtained by using a Philip Tecnai G2 LaB6 Gun Transmission Electron Microscope with a Gatan Dual Vision CCD Camera, operated at 200 keV. Linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves were obtained with a potentiostat (CHI, model 900B), using a three-electrode cell; the LSV was controlled by a system for scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The DSSCs were illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2, 1 sun) was calibrated with a standard silicon cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the electrolytes and the photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded by a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and characterization of MWCNT-15-C-5
Considering the properties of facile electron-transfer of MWCNT and trapping ability of 15-C-5, we have combined these materials and prepared 15-C-5-functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-15-C-5). A synthetic route for the preparation of MWCNT-15-C-5 is shown in Scheme 1; 15-C-5-NH2 containing the amine functional groups of NH2 was used as the major reactant for this preparation. Fig. 1a presents the Raman spectra of the pristine MWCNT, the MWCNT-COOH, and the MWCNT-15-C-5. The characteristic signals at 1342 and 1574 cm−1 of the pristine MWCNT correspond to disorder-induced mode (D band) and tangential mode (G band), respectively. The ratio of intensities of D and G bands (ID/IG) shows an increase gradually from 0.77 to 1.14, when the pristine MWCNTs are modified to MWCNT-15-C-5. This suggests the covalent bonding of 15-C-5-NH2 to MWCNT, in which sp2-hybridization of the MWCNT changes to sp3-hybridization. This conversion is further evidenced through FTIR spectroscopy. The spectrum of MWCNT-COOH shows an additional absorption peak at 1728 cm−1 corresponded to CO stretching of carboxylic acid groups of COOH, with reference to the peaks of the spectrum of pristine MWCNT (Fig. 1b). After the incorporation of 15-C-5-NH2, the absorption peak centered at 1728 cm−1 shifts to a lower wavenumber of 1709 cm−1, due to the formation of the amide bond. These results of FTIR confirm the fact that amine functional groups (NH2) of 15-C-5-NH2 have been covalently bonded to carboxylic acid groups (COOH) of MWCNT-COOH. The signal at 1709 cm−1 can be assigned to OC–NH–, considering the facts that inorganic materials usually show weak signals for bonds in FTIR spectra,24,25 and the XPS spectra in Fig. 2 show the presence of “nitrogen” on the MWCNT, which can occur only at the bonding site of MWCNTs and 15-C-5.

To take insight into the changes in the surface-modified MWCNT, XPS was used. This powerful technique is beneficial for distinguishing and observing the elements in the resultant material. Fig. 2a and its inset show, respectively, XPS full-scan and core-level spectra of the prepared MWCNT-15-C-5. Fig. 2b and its inset show, respectively, the XPS full-scan and core-level spectra of the MWCNT-COOH. In the core-level spectrum of Fig. 2a, the characteristic signal of N1s is centered at 400 eV and indicates the amide bond of MWCNT-15-C-5. Signals for C1s (carbon) and O1s (oxygen) can be seen in the full-scan spectra of Fig. 2a and b. The inset of Fig. 2b exhibits no signal of N1s for the MWCNT-COOH. Formation of the amide bond for MWCNT-15-C-5 is also evidenced in the XPS in Fig. 2c. Appearance of major peaks for C–O (286 eV) and OC–N (289 eV)26,27 in the C1s-core-level spectrum in Fig. 2c indicates this formation.
3.2. Trapping behavior of MWCNT-15-C-5 for lithium ions

          LiI and I2 are generally used in the electrolyte of a DSSC, intending to develop the redox-couple, iodide (I−) and tri-iodide (I3−). These Li+ with positive charge can be attracted by I−, due to a static interaction in the electrolyte; this phenomenon can limit the movement of I− in the electrolyte.22,28 Since the 15-C-5 moiety of the MWCNT-15-C-5 possesses cavities, the composite is expected to show trapping and selective abilities for Li+. This capturing of Li+ leads to retardation of magnitude of the static interaction between Li+ and I− and thereby promotes the movement of I− in the electrolyte.
To demonstrate the trapping behavior of MWCNT-15-C-5 towards Li+, a separate experiment was carried out. In brief, the MWCNT-15-C-5 was added into a 1 M HNO3 aqueous solution consisting of 0.5 M LiI. The contents were left to dwell for 1 day to allow a good interaction between the LiI and the MWCNT-15-C-5. For comparative purpose, another solution with the same quantities of HNO3 and LiI, containing pristine MWCNT, was prepared. The MWCNT-15-C-5 displayed a better dispersion than the pristine MWCNT in LiI/HNO3 solution; this can be attributed to the Li+-trapping nature of MWCNT-15-C-5. These solutions were further filtered through PVDF membranes. Both filtered MWCNTs and MWCNT-15-C-5 were rinsed with deionized water and characterized by XPS. Fig. 3 shows XPS spectra of MWCNT-15-C-5 and pristine MWCNT both attached with Li+. The characteristic signal corresponded to Li+ appears at 50.0 eV in the case of MWCNT-Li+; this signal is attributed to the cation–π interaction between Li+ and MWCNT.29 This signal shows a shift to the location of higher binding energy (∼52.5 eV) in the case of MWCNT-15-C-5-Li+ (Fig. 3). The shift is likely due to the trapping behavior of 15-C-5 for Li+. In addition, the amount of Li+ in the filtrate of MWCNT-15-C-5 was found to be about 0.014 M less than that in the filtrate of pristine MWCNT, as analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrometer (AAnalyst 200, PerkinElmer). The successful trapping ability of MWCNT-15-C-5 for Li+ was thus established. The nebulizer of an atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer is limited to be used in an aqueous solution, consisting of acidic components. The spectrometer in this way, however, can be used to obtain a precise concentration of Li+ in the acidic solution. Although the conditions of electrolytes for an AA spectrometer analysis and for a DSSC are different, the lower concentration of Li+ in the electrolyte in the presence of MWCNT-15-C-5, established by the AA spectrometer, can be relied upon.

3.3. Exchange reaction of I−/I3− in an IL electrolyte
The dispersing behavior of MWCNT-15-C-5 in the IL, EMIBF4, was a concern for us at the beginning of this study. In order to prepare the electrolyte, an equal volume of MeOH was added to the volume of EMIBF4. Addition of MeOH was intended to disperse the MWCNT-15-C-5 in the mixture. Fig. 4 shows the HR-TEM image of pristine MWCNT dispersed in MeOH; the inset shows the photograph of such dispersion. Then the MeOH added to the EMIBF4 was pumped out slowly for 24 h, and the final product of MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 was obtained. EMIBF4 consisting of pristine MWCNT was also prepared using the same method. LSV was employed to obtain apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of I− and I3− in bare EMIBF4 electrolyte and in electrolytes with 0.05 wt% of pristine MWCNTs and 0.05 wt% of MWCNT-15-C-5 (Fig. 5). The Dapp of I− and I3− were obtained, respectively, through the anodic and cathodic steady-state limiting currents (Iss), using the following eqn (1): Iss = 4nFrCDapp(1)where n = 2 is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reaction, F is the Faraday constant, r = 5 μm is the radius of the Pt ultramicroelectrode, and C is the bulk concentration of the electro-active species. The estimated values of Dapp for I− and I3− are summarized in Table 1. The ionic conductivities (σ) of EMIBF4, MWCNT/EMIBF4, and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 were also measured and illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5. For obtaining σ, EIS of these electrolytes were obtained in a symmetric cell with two Pt electrodes, by adjusting the frequency range between 65 kHz and 0.01 Hz. The σ was calculated, using the following relation, σ = A/(d × Rs)(2)where A is the area of the Pt electrode and was fixed to be 1 cm2 by means of a Surlyn spacer, d is the distance separated by the Pt electrodes, and Rs is the series resistance of the conductance cell consisting of the electrolyte and the Pt electrodes. A σ value of 12.9 mS cm−1 was used as the standard for the potassium chloride solution (KCl, Thermo Electron Corporation).

It has been reported that Dapp can be separated into two terms as follows,30–32 Dapp = Dphys + Dex(3)where Dphys and Dex are the physical diffusion coefficient and the exchange reaction-based diffusion coefficient, respectively. While Dphys has to do with the diffusion of the ions in the electrolyte, the Dex deals with the charge transport dominated by the contribution from the exchange reaction of I− and I3− in the electrolyte. Katakabe et al. have proposed that Dapp has a contribution from Dex, if the σ values of the electrolytes, corresponding to Dphys, are almost constant.33 The values of σ of EMIBF4 (12.96 ± 0.76 mS cm−1), MWCNT/EMIBF4 (12.23 ± 0.24 mS cm−1), and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 (11.99 ± 0.35 mS cm−1) are close to each other, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. This implies that the effects of Dapp of EMIBF4, MWCNT/EMIBF4, and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 on the photovoltaic performance of the pertinent DSSCs are mainly due to their Dex. Previous reports have indicated that the charge-transport rate in an IL electrolyte at higher concentration of I−/I3− is determined by the exchange reaction. The exchange reaction of I−/I3− is shown below:20,34 I− + I3− → I3− + I−(4)

Table 1 shows that the Dapp of I−/I3− for the electrolyte with MWCNT/EMIBF4 (Dapp(I−) = 3.01 × 10−7 cm2s−1 and Dapp(I3−) = 3.26 × 10−7 cm2s−1) are higher than those for the electrolyte with bare EMIBF4 (Dapp(I−) = 2.37 × 10−7 cm2s−1 and Dapp(I3−) = 2.23 × 10−7 cm2s−1). These increases in Dapp of I−/I3− in the case of MWCNT/EMIBF4 are to be attributed to the pristine MWCNT present in this combination, which serve as the carriers for cations and facilitate the electron-transport and the exchange reaction of I−/I3−. Furthermore, the Dapp of I−/I3− for MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 (Dapp(I−) = 3.32 × 10−7 cm2s−1 and Dapp(I3−) = 4.04 × 10−7 cm2s−1) exhibit even higher values than those for MWCNT/EMIBF4 (Table 1). These higher Dapp in the case of MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 are in accordance with the explanation that Li+ are trapped by 15-C-5 of MWCNT-15-C-5, which can promote the exchange reaction of I−/I3− in the pertinent electrolyte. The table values of Dapp for MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 further demonstrate the trapping behavior of MWCNT-15-C-5 for Li+. Though MWCNTs could themselves enhance the JSC of their cell (from 3.23 ± 0.30 to 3.99 ± 0.33 mA cm−2), the enhancement due to 15-C-5 tethered MWCNTs is much more higher (from 3.23 ± 0.30 to 5.53 ± 0.38 mA cm−2) (Table 1); this clearly indicates the additional role played by 15-C-5. Some Li+ ions are expected to bind with the pristine MWCNT in the electrolyte, even without the presence of 15-C-5, via cation–π interactions; this is already confirmed by XPS through a separate experiment, as discussed above. These interactions may reduce the combination between Li+ and I− and thereby improve the Dapp of I− and I3− in the electrolyte, and thus ultimately enhance the JSC and η of a cell with MWCNTs in its electrolyte.
3.4. Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with different IL electrolytes

Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with bare EMIBF4 electrolyte and the electrolytes with MWCNT/EMIBF4 and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4, and Table 1 gives the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The figure and table show that there is an increase in the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the DSSC with MWCNT/EMIBF4 (JSC = 3.99 ± 0.33 mA cm−2), with reference to that of the cell with bare EMIBF4 (JSC = 3.23 ± 0.30 mA cm−2); this increase is attributed to the increase in Dex of I−/I3− for the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4. However, the lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4 may be related to probable adsorption of MWCNT onto the porous TiO2 film, and thereby higher dark current in the cell, with reference to that in the absence of the tubes (Fig. 6). Higher dark current of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4, as discussed above, should have caused lower FF for its cell. Apparently the detrimental effects of VOC and FF have dominated the favorable effect of JSC in the case of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4, resulting in a reduced power-conversion efficiency (η) for the cell (η = 1.38 ± 0.08%), with reference to that of the cell with bare EMIBF4 (Table 1). All the values (JSC = 5.53 ± 0.38 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.60 ± 0.01 V, FF = 0.64 ± 0.01, and η = 2.11 ± 0.10%) of the cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 show increases, with reference to the corresponding values (JSC = 3.99 ± 0.33 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.57 ± 0.01 V, FF = 0.61 ± 0.01, and η = 1.38 ± 0.08%) of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4 (Table 1); the enhancement in JSC is consistent with its Dex of I−/I3−. A linear relationship between JSC and light intensity up to 100 mW cm−2 can be observed in the case of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4. A value of JSC of 9.08 mA cm−2 is obtained for the cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 at 150 mW cm−2 of illumination. This exhibits a superlinearity over the light intensity in the case of the cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The linearity in the figure suggests that the JSC of the DSSC with MWCNT/EMIBF4 or MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 is not limited by the diffusion of I−/I3− in the electrolyte but by the exchange reaction of I−/I3− in the electrolyte. However, the JSC of the DSSC with EMIBF4 has increased with the light intensity up to 75 mW cm−2 and then increased little at the light intensities higher than 75 mW cm−2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). This indicates that the Jsc of this DSSC at high light intensity is limited by the diffusion of I−/I3− in its electrolyte.
 Fig. 6  Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with bare EMIBF4 electrolyte and with the electrolytes with MWCNT/EMIBF4 and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4, at 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in the dark. The inset shows the at-rest durability of the quasi-solid-state DSSC with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 for a period of 1200 h. 
Compared to the VOC = 0.62 ± 0.01 V of the cell with EMIBF4, the VOC of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4 (0.57 ± 0.01 V, Table 1) is lower. The reduced VOC in the case of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4 may be attributed to the introduction of MWCNT into the EMIBF4-based electrolyte, thereby promoting the unwanted adsorption of MWCNT as a potential recombination center. The cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4, however, shows an increased VOC of 0.60 ± 0.01 V, with reference to that of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4 (VOC = 0.57 ± 0.01 V); this relative increase in favor of the cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 is apparently due to reduced probability for the adsorption of Li+ on the surface of TiO2, owing to the attachment of existing Li+ ions to the crowns of the MWCNTs; it is well known that reduced attachment of Li+ ions on the surface and in the lattices of TiO2 can shift the conduction band of it to a negative side and thereby cause an increase in the VOC of the pertinent cell.
This type of reduced adsorption of Li+ on TiO2 in the case of the cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 also reduces the magnitude of the positive shift, with reference to the positive shift in the case of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4, and thereby favors a slightly higher VOC for the cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 compared to the VOC of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4.
The J–V characteristics of a DSSC with only 15-crown-5 (15-C-5) are now measured to understand the impact of only adding 15-crown-5-ether to the ionic liquid electrolyte (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The η (1.55%) of the DSSC with this electrolyte is higher than that of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4 (Table 1). This enhancement is therefore attributed to the pristine 15-C-5, which could improve the exchange reaction of I−/I3− in the presence of Li+ and MWCNTs in the electrolyte with EMIBF4. It is important to note that only 15-C-5-anchored MWCNTs have rendered best performance to their cell (η = 2.11 ± 0.10%), and MWCNTs without 15-C-5 have shown far lesser efficiency in their cell (η = 1.38 ± 0.08%) (Table 1).
The MWCNTs may act as potential recombination centers, as indicated by the reduced VOC in the case of the cell with MWCNT/EMIBF4. The very fact that the cell with MWCNTs shows less efficiency than that of the cell without them indicates the detrimental effect of MWCNTs, as an additive to the electrolyte, on the performance of the pertinent cell. However, crown ethers (15-C-5), when added separately to the electrolyte, do not improve the performance of the cell (η = 1.55%, Fig. S2, ESI†), compared to the cell with bare EMIBF4 (η = 1.52 ± 0.04%, Table 1). For this reason we used MWCNTs as a support to the crown ethers, and this composite shows clear enhancement in the efficiency of the cell (η = 2.11 ± 0.10%) compared to that of the cell with bare EMIBF4 (η = 1.52 ± 0.04%); the reasons for the better performance of the cell with the composite, i.e., 15-C-5-anchored MWCNTs, are already discussed. The much lesser efficiency of the cell with only MWCNTs (η = 1.38 ± 0.08%) than that of the cell with the composite indicates that the composite traps more Li+ ions than MWCNTs.
A different iodide source, ethyl-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII), was used to replace LiI. The DSSC with 0.5 M EMII, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, and 0.05 wt% MWCNT-15-C-5 in the ionic liquid electrolyte, EMIBF4, has shown a decreased η of 1.34%, with reference to that of the cell with the same electrolyte, however without the MWCNT-15-C-5 (η = 1.60%) (see Fig. S3, ESI†). This indicates that the improved exchange reaction of I−/I3− is positively affected by the trapping behavior of MWCNT-15-C-5 for the Li+ in the ionic liquid electrolyte.
The above results show that while Li+ enhances the η of a cell with MWCNT-15-C-5 in the ionic liquid electrolyte, EMIBF4 (η = 2.11 ± 0.10%, Table 1), EMI+ decreases the η of a cell with MWCNT-15-C-5 in the same electrolyte (η = 1.34%, Fig. S3, ESI†). This distinguishes the effects of Li+ and EMI+ on the exchange reaction of I−/I3− in the EMIBF4-based electrolyte. Li+ due to its small ionic size could be trapped by the cavity of 15-C-5 of MWCNT-15-C-5, which cannot be expected for other cations in the case of DSSCs. In addition, the inset of Fig. 6 presents the excellent at-rest durability of the quasi-solid-state DSSC fabricated with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 for 1200 h at 100 mW cm−2 illumination; this unfailing durability is due to the inherent advantage of non-volatility of EMIBF4.
3.5. Electrochemical impedance spectra of DSSCs with different IL electrolytes
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSSCs employing MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4, MWCNT/EMIBF4, and EMIBF4, obtained at 100 mW cm−2 illumination, are shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7a, Nyquist plots were obtained in the frequencies ranging from 65 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The first semicircle at the left side in the figure represents the charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode and the electrolyte (Rct1), the second semicircle in the middle region represents the charge-transfer resistance at the photoanode and the electrolyte (Rct2), and the third semicircle from left represents the resistance of Warburg diffusion in the electrolyte (ZW). In our case, ZW is important, because it represents the changes in the electrolyte. The smallest ZW is observed in the case of the cell with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4. The highest values of Dapp(I−) and Dapp(I3−) obtained for this DSSC are in consistency with this smallest ZW value of this cell (see Fig. 7a and Table 1).

spectra of the DSSCs with bare EMIBF4 electrolyte and with the electrolytes with MWCNT/EMIBF4 and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4, at 100 mW cm−2 illumination: (a) Nyquist plot and (b) Bode phase plot. The inset of (a) shows the corresponding equivalent circuit model. 
Correspondingly, the Bode phase plots in Fig. 7b exhibit the characteristic frequency peaks (f) in the frequency range from 10 to 1000 Hz. The values of f can be obtained by drawing tangents to the peaks and thereby identifying the accurate points of frequency on the x-axis corresponded to the peaks. Thus, these values for the EMIBF4, MWCNT/EMIBF4 and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 in Fig. 7b were acquired to be 76.0, 137.7, and 92.6 Hz, respectively. Based on the relationship between f and electron lifetime in a TiO2 film,35 the electron lifetimes of DSSCs were calculated; the lifetime of the DSSC with EMIBF4 was found to be longer than those of the DSSCs with MWCNT/EMIBF4 and MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4. This longer electron lifetime in the TiO2 film of the DSSC with EMIBF4 may lead to a reduction in the dark current and thereby an increase in the VOC of the DSSC. The sequence of electrolytes with reference to the reduced dark current is EMIBF4 > MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 > MWCNT/EMIBF4. The tendency of this sequence is consistent with the sequence of VOC of the DSSCs with EMIBF4 (VOC = 0.62 ± 0.01 V), MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 (VOC = 0.60 ± 0.01 V), and MWCNT/EMIBF4 (VOC = 0.57 ± 0.01 V) (Table 1).
4. Conclusions
An inorganic/organic composite containing 15-C-5 and MWCNT (MWCNT-15-C-5) was synthesized successfully and was characterized by Raman spectra, FTIR, and XPS. For this synthesis, the dispersibility of pristine MWCNTs in MeOH was verified and found to be excellent (HR-TEM). The synthesized composite was employed as an additive to the electrolyte of a quasi-solid-state DSSC, containing EMIBF4. The MWCNT-15-C-5 showed a trapping ability for Li+, and this is attributed to the cavity-structure of 15-C-5 (XPS). The trapping behavior of MWCNT-15-C-5 was assumed to facilitate the exchange reaction of I−/I3− in its electrolyte, and this facilitation was explained as the reason for the best performance of the quasi-solid-state DSSC in this study, with reference to the performances of the cells with bare EMIBF4 and MWCNT incorporated EMIBF4 in their electrolytes. The DSSC with MWCNT-15-C-5/EMIBF4 showed an unfailing at-rest durability for a period of 1200 h at 1 sun intensity.
