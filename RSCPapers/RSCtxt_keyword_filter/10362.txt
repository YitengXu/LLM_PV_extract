    , Accepted 3rd June 2014First published on 4th June 2014AbstractSubstituting pyrenes at the 2,7-positions is synthetically challenging because of the presence of a nodal plane in the HOMO and LUMO, which lies perpendicular to the molecule and passes through the 2- and 7-positions. Thus, there are few reports about 2,7-substituted pyrenes. Here, a distinct D–π–A structured 2,7-substituted pyrene dye ICP-3 was successfully synthesized, where a diphenylamine unit and thienyl acrylic acid moiety are located at C-2,7 positions of the pyrene, and the pyrene functions as a linker to bridge them. The DFT calculations show that no nodal plane through the 2- and 7-carbon atoms was observed in the HOMO and LUMO when the donor and the acceptor were attached, indicating effective charge transfer in the molecule upon light excitation. The ICP-3 was used as sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells, showing a power conversion efficiency of 4.1% under AM 1.5 conditions.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have become one of the most promising alternatives to conventional inorganic semiconductor photovoltaic devices due to their potential low material/fabrication cost and relatively high conversion efficiencies.1 In these devices, the sensitizer anchored to the surface of a mesoporous oxide layer (usually, TiO2), absorbs the solar radiation and transfers a photo-excited electron to the TiO2 conduction, followed by a hole transfer to a redox shuttle (usually, I−/I3−). Thus, the sensitizer is one of the key components in DSSCs, exerting a significant influence on the device power conversion and stability.2 With a view to the limited resources of noble ruthenium, metal-free organic dyes have been regarded as a research focus of DSSCs in recent years owing to their low cost and excellent flexibility of molecular tailoring.3 Generally, organic dyes are designed with electron donor–π bridge–electron acceptor configuration, where a π-conjugated linker is employed to bridge a triarylamine derivative donor and a carboxyl group containing acceptor for efficient intramolecular charge transfer and efficient light harvesting ability. In the dyes, the π bridge unit should have good conjugation across a donor and an acceptor for efficient light harvesting and intramolecular charge transfer. Thus, a variety of different π bridge groups, such as oligoene,4a benzene,4b thiophene/fused thiophene,4c perylene,4d porphyrine,4e and so on, have been successfully employed in the design of organic dyes.
Recently, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon units, such as anthracene5a and pentacene,5b are employed as building blocks to construct different sensitizers for DSSCs due to their rigid planar structure with less reorganization energy for efficient electron transfer. Pyrene, consisting of four fused benzene rings, shows high thermal stability, extensive electron delocalization and electron accepted nature.6 Pyrene and its derivatives have been the subject of investigation as chromophores because the absorption and emission spectra of pyrene can be tuned by systematic substitution at the 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 7-, and 8-positions.7,8 Baheti first reported 1-substituted pyrene derivatives as sensitizers for DSSCs.9 Recently, we reported 1,6-substituted pyrenes with a D–π–A structure.10 Substituting pyrene at the 2,7-positions is synthetically challenging because of the presence of a nodal plane in the HOMO and LUMO, which lies perpendicular to the molecule and passes through the 2- and 7-positions.6 There are few reports about 2,7-substituted pyrenes, especially for 2,7-substituted pyrene derivatives with a distinct D–π–A structure.8 Here, a novel D–π–A structured pyrene dye was successfully synthesized for the first time, where a diphenylamine donor and a thienyl acrylic acid acceptor were bridged at their 2,7 positions, respectively. The 2,7-substituted dye ICP-3 (see Scheme 1) as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells, exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 4.1% under AM 1.5 conditions.

Experimental
Measurement and characterization
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz instrument. Mass spectra were taken on a Bruker Daltonics Inc. APEXII FT-ICR spectrometer. The UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded on an Agilent-8453 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in dichloromethane using a computer-controlled CHI660C electrochemical workstation, a platinum working electrode, platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and Ag wire anodized with AgCl as a pseudo-reference. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded at room temperature using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2, Oriel, 67005). The action spectra of monochromatic incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were performed using a commercial setup (PV-25 DYE, JASCO). A 300 W Xenon lamp was employed as a light source for generation of a monochromatic beam. Calibrations were performed with a standard silicon photodiode. IPCE is defined by IPCE(λ) = hcJsc/eφλ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, e is the electronic charge, λ is the wavelength in meters (m), Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density (A m−2), and φ is the incident radiation flux (W m−2).
Materials
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. THF and toluene were dried over sodium–benzophenone and freshly distilled before use. Reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere.

Synthesis of 2. 
An oven-dried 50 mL vacuum reaction tube was charged with 2,7-dibromopyrene (0.36 g, 1 mmol), diphenylamine (0.085 g, 0.5 mmol), sodium hydride (0.1 g of 60% NaH in white oil, 2.5 mmol), Ni(PPh3)2(1-naphthyl)Cl (0.019 g, 5% mol relative to diarylamine, 0.025 mol), and PPh3 (0.013 g, 10% mmol relative to diarylamine, 0.05 mmol). The tube was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen, and the operation was repeated three times. Following the procedures, dried toluene (15 mL) was added via a syringe, and was heated in an oil bath at 120 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and filtered through a pad of silica gel. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with petroleum ether as eluent to obtain a yellow solid compound 2 (0.045 g), yield: 20%. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 8.24 (s, 2H), 7.82 (d, J = 4.7 Hz, 3H), 7.81 (s, 1H), 7.79 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 1H), 7.63 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 1H), 7.27 (t, 4H), 7.21 (d, J = 0.8 Hz, 4H), 7.07 (t, 2H).

A solution of 5-formylthiophen-2-yl-boronic acid (0.2 g, 1.34 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added slowly, and the mixture was refluxed at 70 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL), and the organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residue was purified on a silica gel column (petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 = 10/1, v/v) to give an orange solid compound 3 (0.25 g), yield: 63%. 1H-NMR(400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 9.94 (s, 1H), 8.35 (s, 2H), 7.98 (d, J = 9.2 Hz, 2H), 7.88 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 3H), 7.85 (s, 1H), 7.82 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 1H), 7.65 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 1H), 7.32 (t, 4H), 7.24 (d, J = 0.8 Hz, 4H), 7.11 (t, 2H).

DSC fabrication
The nanocrystalline TiO2 pastes (particle size, 20 nm) were prepared using a previously reported procedure.12 Fluorine doped thin oxide (FTO, 4 mm thickness, 10 Ohms sq−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) conducting electrodes were washed with soap and water, followed by sonication for 10 min in acetone and isopropanol, respectively. Following a drying period, the electrodes were then submerged in a 50 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 75 °C, and then washed with water and ethanol. On the electrodes, a 12 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and 5 μm thick TiO2 light scattering layer (particle size, 400 nm, PST-400C) were prepared by a screen-printing method. The TiO2 electrodes were heated at 500 °C for 30 min, followed by treating with a 50 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 75 °C and subsequent sintering at 500 °C for 30 min.13 The thickness of the TiO2 films was measured by a profiler, Sloan, Dektak3. The electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.2 mM ICP-3 and 2 mM 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid) in 4-tert-butanol/acetonitrile mixture/tetrahydrofuran (1:1:0.2, v/v) and kept for 24 h at room temperature. The dyed electrodes were then rinsed with the mixed solvent to remove any excess dye. A platinum-coated counter electrode was prepared according to a reported method,13 and two holes were drilled on its opposite sides. The two electrodes were sealed together with a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through one of the two holes in the counter electrode, and the holes were sealed with the thermoplastic Surlyn. The electrolyte contains 0.68 M dimethyl imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.10 M LiI, 0.05 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.40 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). All devices were prepared with a photoactive area of about 0.3 cm2, and a metal mask of 0.165 cm2 was covered on the device for photovoltaic property measurements.
Results and discussion
The synthesis route of ICP-3 is shown in Scheme 2. In the synthesis, 2,7-dibromo pyrene was used as the starting material, which was prepared according to a previous report.11 Firstly, diphenylamine was connected at the C-2 position of the dibromopyrene by a Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, and the resulting intermediates were subjected to a Suzuki reaction at the C-7 position with 5-formylthiophene-boronic acid, followed by condensation with cyanoacetic acid.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The electronic absorption spectrum of dye ICP-3 was recorded in a tetrahydrofuran solution at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 1. The maximum absorption peak (λmax) of ICP-3 is at 409 nm with a mole extinction efficient of 1.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1. For further investigation, the absorption and emission spectra of the dye were examined in two different solvents (toluene and DMF) with large different polarities. As shown in Fig. 2, a large bathochromic shift of the steady-state absorption maximum was observed in the more polar solvent, which indicates that ICP-3 dye in the excited state is more polar than in the ground state, suggesting an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) nature. In addition, a similar tendency to the absorption spectra was found in the emission spectra with a large difference in the emission maxima of the solvents. The large Stokes shifts in both solvents indicate a large structural difference between the ground and excited states, and also suggest the possibility of formation of a charge-transfer state.

To investigate the molecular energy levels, cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in a 0.1 M dichloromethane solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate with ferrocene as internal standard. The first oxidation potentials (Es+/0) of ICP-3 were observed to be 0.99 V vs. NHE, which are assigned to the oxidation of the diphenylamine unit in the system. The potential is more positive as compared to the redox potential of the iodide/tri-iodide couple (0.4 V vs. NHE),14 indicating that the ground state dye regeneration is energetically favourable for DSSC application. The optical transition energy (E0–0) was 2.21 eV, estimated from the intersection of their absorption and emission spectra. The excited-state redox potential, Es+/*, determined by subtracting E0–0 from Es+/0, was −1.22 V, which is negative enough to allow their excited state electron transfer into the TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE).15
The DFT calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 package to investigate the electron distribution and electron transition processes upon photoexcitation. The frontier molecular orbitals of the dye molecules are shown in Fig. 3. At the HOMO state, the electron density is mainly distributed on the diphenyl amine unit and a part of the pyrene ring, while at the LUMO level, the electron density is located on the thienyl acrylic acid moiety and a part of the pyrene. Therefore, the excited electrons are expected to be effectively shifted from the electron donor moiety to the electron accepting cyanoacetic acid unit through the π-conjugated pyrene, and further injected into the conduction band of TiO2. No nodal plane through the 2- and 7-carbon atoms was observed in the HOMO and LUMO of ICP-3, indicating effective charge transfer in the molecule upon light excitation. The disappearance of the nodal plane might be ascribed to the simultaneous presence of the diphenylamine donor and thienyl acrylic acid acceptor in the 2,7-positions of pyrene. In a previous report, no nodal plane was observed in LUMO for 2,7-substituted pyrene with electron deficient substituents, while no nodal plane was observed in HOMO with two electron rich substituents.8c

The photovoltaic performances of the ICP-3-based DSCs were studied, where a typical sandwiched configuration was adapted for this investigation. Double layer electrodes were used with a 12 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and a 5 μm thick TiO2 light scattering layer. The electrodes were stained for 24 h at room temperature in a mixture of 4-tert-butanol/acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (1:1:0.2, v/v) containing 0.2 mM ICP-3 and 2 mM chenodeoxycholic acid. The dyed electrode was covered with a Pt counter-electrode, and an I3−/I− based liquid electrolyte was sandwiched between them. Fig. 4 shows action spectra in the form of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs). The ICP-3-based DSSCs exhibited a high spectral response in the range of 400–650 nm with the highest value of 78% at 455 nm, which is consistent with the corresponding absorption spectra. The photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curve of the device is measured under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 5. The ICP-3-based device gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 8.0 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.1%, derived from the equation η = Jsc·Voc·FF/light intensity, which is in good agreement with the calculated value from the IPCE spectrum shown in Fig. 3. In a previous report, Thomas et al. firstly reported 1-functionalized pyrene derivatives as sensitizers in DSCs with efficiencies of about 2%. Recently, we reported 1.6-functionized D–π–A pyrene dyes as efficient sensitizers in DSSCs. It should be noted that there are few reports on 2,7-substituted pyrenes, especially with a distinct D–π–A structure. A higher photovoltaic performance may be achieved for 2,7-substituted pyrenes with extended π conjugation to increase optical absorption at long wavelengths. A short stability test was conducted for ICP-3-based DSSCs with the organic solvent containing a liquid electrolyte at room temperature under one-sun light soaking. In the 100 h testing period, the photovoltaic parameters Jsc, Voc and FF of the ICD-9 based cell changed slightly with time, and the final conversion efficiency remained 95% of its initial value.

Conclusions
A 2,7-substituted pyrene dye ICP-3 was synthesized with a distinct electron donor–π bridge–electron acceptor configuration, featuring a diphenylamine unit as electron donor, and a thienyl acrylic acid unit as electron acceptor bridged by the π linker pyrene at its 2,7-positions. The DFT calculations show that there is no nodal plane through the 2- and 7-carbon atoms observed in the HOMO and LUMO. The pyrene dye was employed as a sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells, showing a conversion efficiency of 4.1% under AM 1.5 conditions. The efficiency can be optimized when stronger donors are employed.16 The D–π–A structured pyrene dye can advance the development of 2,7-substituted pyrenes used in various optoelectronic devices.
