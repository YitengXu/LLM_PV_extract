, Accepted 2nd October 2014First published on 2nd October 2014AbstractD–A–π–A dyes have exhibited several excellent advantages including optimized energy levels, and distinct improvement of photovoltaic performance and stability. By modulating the auxiliary acceptor and acceptor unit, the efficiency of D–A–π–A dye based dye-sensitized solar cells can be further improved. Based on density functional theory methods, sixteen dimethoxyl-substituted triphenylamine based D–A–π–A dyes composed of different acceptor and auxiliary acceptor groups were designed, meanwhile for reference four homologous D–π–A dyes were also compared in this work. The properties of all the dyes, including intramolecular charge transfer, light harvesting efficiency, kinetics of electron injection, and vertical dipole moment, have been investigated theoretically to identify the dyes which would produce high efficiency. Then the interaction between the selected dyes and the electron acceptor in the electrolyte was discussed to reveal the interfacial charge recombination process. In comparison with other dyes, TNA4 displays outstanding performance due to its key parameters to achieve a balance between competing factors. Compared with cyanoacrylic acid, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine group can serve as an excellent acceptor for future DSSCs applications.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a potentially lower cost alternative to the conventional silicon and other inorganic semiconductor-based photovoltaic devices, have received comprehensive attention since their first successful demonstration by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.1–4 DSSCs based on conventional transition metal polypyridyl complexes, usually containing Ru(II) centers such as N3/N719 and the black dyes, have been investigated intensively and show very impressive solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies exceeding 11% under standard illumination.5–9 However, the limited Ru resources and environmental issues render them inappropriate for large-scale application. Fortunately, organic dyes, owing to their crucial advantages such as high molar extinction coefficient, easily tunable optical properties, low-cost preparation processes, good flexibility in molecular tailoring and environmental compatibility, have attracted increasing interest as a prospective challenger for the Ru complexes in recent years.10–25 Most notably, DSSCs employing organic dyes have obtained only slightly lower efficiencies compared to Ru(II) dyes, with record efficiencies close to or even more than 10%.21–24
The most efficient organic sensitizers typically exhibit a D–π–A dipolar configuration, with the donor group (D) being an electron-rich unit, linked through a conjugated linker (π) to the electron acceptor group (A), which is directly anchored to the semiconductor surface. This structure can induce the intramolecular charge transfer from the donor unit to the acceptor unit, thus it is favourable for effective charge separation and for photoexcited electron to inject into the conduction band of the semiconductor, as well as for the regeneration of oxidized dyes. However, metal-free organic dyes generally have relatively narrow spectral response with lower efficiencies, leading to the result that not many DSSCs based on these dyes using the classical iodine electrolyte are capable of achieving 9% in photovoltaic efficiency.26 Furthermore, it is of great challenge to achieve the stability of the dye sensitizers.27–29
Recently, a novel “D–A–π–A” concept has been proposed to design organic sensitizers, in which an additional electron-withdrawing acceptor (such as benzothiadiazole, benzotriazole, quinoxaline, phthalimide, diketopyrrolopyrrole, thienopyrazine, bithiazole, cyano and fluoro) is incorporated into the π bridge to tailor molecular structure and optimize energy levels.11,23,30–41 There are several favourable characteristics of these D–A–π–A organic sensitizers as following: (i) facilitating the intramolecular electron transfer, which may weaken the deprotonation effect upon dye adsorption; (ii) conveniently tailoring the solar cell performance with a facile structural modification on the additional acceptor; (iii) conveniently tuning the molecular energy gap, and modulating the response of the light-harvesting range with the new resulting absorption bands; and (iv) most importantly, being capable of greatly improving the sensitizer photo-stability. However, the auxiliary electron-withdrawing group acting as an “electron trap” may have negative impact on the electron injection from the dye sensitizers to the conduction band of the semiconductor and the regeneration of the oxidized dyes. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that different auxiliary acceptor units usually tend to have opposite effect in photocurrent and photovoltage. For instance, benzothiadiazole-based D–A–π–A sensitizers can facilely achieve a higher photocurrent but have the photovoltage limited to 700 mV;37,38 in contrast, benzotriazole-based D–A–π–A sensitizers have higher photovoltage value, while their photocurrents become disappointed to some extent.40,41 It also has been proved that the electron-withdrawing phthalimide group compared with benzotriazole plays exactly opposite role in affecting the absorption and electrochemical properties of the D–A–π–A dyes.40 Therefore, incorporating an additional electron-withdrawing unit in the D–A–π–A configuration should be carried out carefully. In this context, it is necessary to remodel the molecular design of organic sensitizers by using various auxiliary acceptors and acceptor/anchor segments to provide insight into the physical origin underlying the relationship of structure and performance for developing more efficient dyes for DSSCs. Theoretical methods based on density functional theory (DFT)42 and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT)43 calculations were usually employed to rationally optimize optical and electrochemical properties, which are of great value for designing novel efficient dyes and help to reduce the cost and time consumed in conventional trial-and-error experimental approaches.44–47
In this work, to systematically modulate the electrochemical and optical properties, dimethoxyl-substituted triphenylamine (denoted as T) is employed as the electron donor group and bithiophene fragment as the π-bridge. By modifying auxiliary acceptor and acceptor group, we can gradually tune the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), the major absorption peak, the injection energy and the dipole moment of the designed dyes (Fig. 1). Here, the widely used benzothiadiazole (BTD, briefly named as B), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP, D), benzotriazole (BTA, N) and quinoxaline (briefly named as Q) are adopted as the auxiliary acceptor. The acceptor/anchor groups include the cyanoacrylic acid (denoted as A1), pyridine (A2), rhodanine-3-acetic acid (A3) and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine (A4), which can represent different types of acceptor/anchor group. In the cyanoacrylic acid based dyes, the carboxyl is conjugated linked with the subject of dyes, which acts as both the acceptor and anchor unit. But in rhodanine-3-acetic acid based dyes, the rhodanine unit acts as the electron-withdrawing group and participates in the conjugation system, while the carboxyl only acts as the anchor group and is not included in the whole conjugation. The pyridine ring has been demonstrated as a good electron-withdrawing anchoring group, which can form coordinate bonds with the Lewis acid sites of the TiO2 surface leading to efficient electron injection.48,49 The 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine without carboxylic acid can not only bring wide absorption spectra, but also maintain excellent electron injection efficiency, which can be a promising alternative anchoring group.50 For comparison, the terthiophene unit (denoted as S) linked dyes (D–π–A type dyes) have been designed to take a close look at the difference with that utilizing electron-withdrawing conjugated segments in push–pull sensitizers. The interaction between the candidate dyes and the electron acceptor in electrolyte was also discussed to reveal the interfacial charge recombination. The screening toward a promising candidate based on the key parameters could achieve a good balance for high efficiency.

2. Theoretical background
2.1. Overall efficiencies
The sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η), which characterizes a solar cell and stipulates the availability of molecular dyes for use as sensitizers in DSSCs, is determined by the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and the fill factor (FF), as compared to incident solar power (Pinc): 
(1)
In DSSCs, the VOC corresponds to the difference between the Fermi level of the electron in TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte I−/I3−, while the JSC is related to the interaction between TiO2 and the sensitizers, as well as the absorption coefficient of the dyes. It can be determined by the following equation:44 
(2)where LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, Φinject evinces the quantum yield of electron injection, and ηcollect denotes the electron collection efficiency. In the systems which are only different in dyes, ηcollect can be reasonably assumed to be a constant. As a result, the improvement of the JSC should focus on the LHE(λ) and Φinject. LHE(λ) can be calculated with 
LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−f
(3)where f represents the oscillator strength of dye molecules at a given wavelength. To obtain a high JSC value, the dyes should have intense light absorption capabilities over the wide region of sunlight to ensure a better light capture. For a DSSC to work properly, high electron injection efficiency (Φinject) from the excited dyes to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and efficient regeneration of the oxidized dyes by I−/I3− are crucial. Preat et al. have proposed a theoretical scheme to quantify the electron injection onto a TiO2 surface for triphenylamine-based organic dyes.51 Φinject is related to the free energy change ΔGinject for the electron injection, which can be expressed as52 
(4)where  is the oxidation potential of the dye in the excited state, ESCCB is the semiconductor conduction band edge. As the ESCCB is sensitive to the surface conditions and difficult to accurately determine, there we use ESCCB = 4.0 eV for TiO2,53 an experimental value corresponding to conditions where the semiconductor is in contact with aqueous redox electrolytes of fixed pH 7.0. Two modes can be used for the evaluation of .54,55 The first implies that the electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state, with the excited-state oxidation potential being extracted from the redox potential of the ground-state EdyeOx, and the absorption energy associated to the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) that is related to λmax, according to56 
(5)
For the second model, the electron injection occurs after relaxation. Given this condition,  is expressed as56,57 
(6)where Edye0–0 is the adiabatic transition energy between the ground state and the relaxed excited state. To calculate the Edye0–0, the equilibrium geometries of S0 and S1 need to be obtained. The Edye0–0 can be expressed as 
(7)where 
(8)and 
(9)QS0 and QS1 are the equilibrium geometries for the S0 and S1 states, respectively. ES1(QS0) and ES1(QS1) denote the internal energies for the S1 calculated at QS0 and QS1, respectively, whereas ΔES1 is the S0 → S1 excitation energy.
However, it has been proved that the absolute difference between the relaxed and unrelaxed ΔGinject is constant and is of the same order of magnitude as the  and EdyeOx mean average error.51 Furthermore, the relaxed path would imply unaffordable CPU resources at this stage, the unrelaxed pathway has been chosen for the ΔGinject evaluation.
Additionally, based on the Marcus electron transfer theory, the recombination rate constant can be approximately calculated as58 
(10)
The terms appearing in the integral are the dye–semiconductor coupling Γ(E), the Fermi–Dirac distribution f(E − EF) that depends on the quasi-Fermi level of the system (Ef,n), and the Franck–Condon term F(E), which is the thermally averaged Franck–Condon integral between the initial and final vibrational wave functions. In addition, the explicit expression of the Franck–Condon F(E) term in the high temperature limit is58 
(11)
As a result, together with the function Γ(E) and the thermal energy kbT, key parameters that determine the recombination rate are the reorganization energy λ, and the energy difference ΔG between the initial (cation) and the final (neutral) states for the molecular adsorbate, as well as the position of the alignment conduction band edge. The reorganization energy λ can be divided into two terms, the solvent (λs) and internal (λi) reorganization energies. λs can be derived from the polarization changes in the dielectric solvent environment, which has been found to not have a significant influence on the electron-transfer dynamic. Therefore, the reorganization energy is mainly influenced by λi, a measure of structural changes between ionic and neutral states, which can be expressed as the following formula59 
λi = [E±0 − E±±] + [E0± − E0]
(12)where E±0 is the energy of the cation or anion calculated with the optimized structure of the neutral molecule, E±± is the energy of the cation or anion calculated with the optimized cation or anion structure, E0± is the energy of the neutral molecule calculated at the cationic or anionic state, and the E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule at ground state.
As for VOC in DSSCs, it can be expressed as60 
(13)here, q is the unit charge, ECB is the conduction band of edge of the semiconductor substrate, kbT is the thermal energy, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, NCB is the density of accessible states in the conduction band, and Eredox is the reduction–oxidation potential of electrolyte. ΔCB is the shift of ECB when the dyes are adsorbed on substrate and can be expressed as44 
(14)
In this expression, μnormal is the component of dipole moment of the individual sensitizer perpendicular to the surface of semiconductor surface, γ is the dyes' surface concentration. ε0 and ε represent the vacuum permittivity and the dielectric permittivity, respectively. It is clear that nc and μnormal would exert crucial influence on VOC.
2.2. Intramolecular charge transfer
Organic D–π–A type dyes can form effective electron–hole separation originated from the intramolecular electronic excitation to a charge-transfer (CT) state upon photoexcitation, which is crucial to produce high photocurrent conversion efficiencies. To quantify CT phenomena, Ciofini et al. have proposed a simple yet efficient dipolar approach.61 The electronic densities derived from the ground and excited states for their vertical electronic excitation (ρGS(r) and ρEx(r), respectively) were defined. Subsequently, two functions ρ+(r) and ρ−(r) can be given to define the increase and decrease of the density owing to the electron transition. The barycenters of the spatial regions defined by ρ+(r) and ρ−(r), can be written as. 
(15)
The distance of charge transfer (dCT) can be defined as 
dCT = |R+ − R−|
(16)
Integrating over all the space ρ+(r) (or ρ−(r)), the transferred charge (qCT) can be defined. Analogously, the dipole moment variation between the ground and the excited states (μCT) can be computed by the following relations: 
(17)
For visualization purpose, two intuitive anisotropic Gaussian distributions of charge associated to the positive and negative density regions are defined as follows. The root-mean-square deviations which represent the distributions of density variation along the three axis (σa,j, j = x, y, z; a = + or −) are computed as. 
(18)
Then, two anisotropic Gaussian distributions (Ca, a = + or −) are simply defined as 
(19)where Aa (a = + or −) are the normalization factors. The index H, the half of the sum of the Gaussian distribution axis along the D–A direction has been computed.
A direction has been computed. For instance, if the D–A direction is along the x axis, H is defined as. 
(20)
2.3. Computational details
All the calculations of the isolated dyes were performed with DFT and TDDFT using the Gaussian 09 package.62 The ground-state geometries of all dyes in their neutral, cationic, and anionic states in the gas phase are fully optimized without any symmetry contains at the level of hybrid DFT by B3LYP63 function with the 6-31G(d) basis set, which has been widely used for the theoretical investigation of organic dyes for DSSCs. Frequency calculations were performed at the same levels of theory on the fully optimized geometries, confirming the stationary nature of the optimized geometry. The electronic excitations at the optimized ground-state geometries for the lowest 40 singlet–singlet transitions were calculated using the TDDFT. As the approximations used in practical applications of TDDFT, such as the adiabatic approximations and approximated exchange–correlation functional, TDDFT usually underestimates the excitation energies in cases of charge-transfer excitations and extended conjugated systems, it is necessary to check the reliability of exchange functionals BHandHLYP,64 MPW1K65 and long-range corrected functionals ωB97XD,66 CAM-B3LYP67 with different nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange (also called X) to estimate or reduce the spurious long-range interaction (Table 1). The 6-31G(d) basis sets were used for all the TDDFT calculations. Solvent effects were considered using the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM68,69) of SCRF procedure for tetrahydrofuran, which was also employed experimentally. Comparison between computational and experimental absorption spectra of TSA1 indicates that the CAM-B3LYP provides a better description of the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) states.

Furthermore, the CAM-B3LYP functional was also selected to calculate the through-space intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The CT excitation for all systems corresponds basically to an one-electron highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) excitation. The excited-state densities have been computed within the linear-response TDDFT framework using a vertical approximation. The electron density difference plots gave a clear vision of electron movement after photoexcitation. The electron transfer distance and the fraction of electron exchange of all dyes that related to the vertical transitions were calculated with Multwfn 3.0.5.70 These results would help us to evaluate the effect of different auxiliary electron-withdrawing acceptor and acceptor/anchor group. The EdyeOx corresponds to ΔGinject and the free energy G of the neutral, anionic, as well as cationic forms have been extracted from the frequency calculations at the PCM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory within the restricted and unrestricted formalisms, respectively.
In addition, to elucidate the electron recombination losses, the calculations of the intermolecular interaction between the dye-iodine were performed by the M06-2X71 functional, with the reason that M06-2X functional has been proved to have preferable performance in describing the intermolecular interactions.72,73 The LANL2DZ basis set was adopted for I atom and 6-31G(d) basis set for other atoms. Basis set superposition error (BSSE) to the binding energies was done by using the counterpoise method.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ground-state geometries
The selected geometrical parameters (Scheme 1) of the D–A–π–A dyes are collected in Table 2. For all the dyes, the donor and acceptor moieties are fully conjugated through the π bridge. To understand the effect of different auxiliary acceptor groups, the dihedral angles of all the designed dyes are analyzed. For the dyes with terthiophene as π-spacer (TS series), the dihedral angle between phenyl of triphenylamine and the first thiophene of π-spacer (Θ1) are calculated to be 23.8°, 24.1°, 21.9° and 21.9°, respectively. However, the introducing of auxiliary electron-withdrawing group could lead to absolutely different result. For DPP based dyes (TD series), the dihedral angle greatly decreases and is nearly planar. While for BTA based dyes (TN series), BTD based dyes (TB series) and quinoxaline based dyes (TQ series), the dihedral angle has gradually increased to close to 40°. These large dihedral angles of Θ1 can be a good property in the way of preventing the formation of π-aggregation. The dihedral angle between auxiliary acceptor and thiophene (Θ2) for TB, TD and TN series decreases to nearly planar. To the contrary, TQ dyes exhibit a significantly larger dihedral angle of more than 20°. Except for the dyes with pyridine (A2) as acceptor, Θ3 and Θ4 of all the D–A–π–A dyes does not changed significantly compared with TS dyes, which are all close to 0°. The optimized geometry parameters revealed that the introduction of DPP group increases coplanar structure of the whole molecule, and this may produce better electron injection but easily form π-aggregation. While the introduction of BTD and BTA group not only help to prevent the formation of π-aggregation but also lead to better electron injection. The introduction of quinoxaline leads to the twist of the whole conjugated system which may be unfavourable for the ICT.

3.2. Intramolecular charge transfer
Ideally, we expect that the electron is transferred from the donor part and localized on the acceptor part upon the excitation. However, the most cases are that the electron is delocalized from the region close to the donor to one in the vicinity of the acceptor, especially for D–A–π–A dyes.
Based on equations in Section 2.2, the key parameters are calculated and the results are presented in Fig. 2. Our purpose is to illustrate how the auxiliary acceptor and acceptor group affect the charge separation and the electron transfer process, which is important for improving the photo-to-electric efficiency of DSSCs. In the first instance, it is necessary to note that all the dyes have almost the same length of π-conjugated bridge. Apparently, compared with D–A–π–A type dyes, TS series of dyes have the largest dCT. TD and TN series of dyes also have a large dCT, which is only slightly smaller than TS series, with the difference of limited in 0.5 Å. While for TB and TQ series of dyes, the dCT decreased greatly with the difference of even more than 1 Å. In brief, the additional electron-withdrawing group causes the dCT get shorter to some extent. Pyridine as acceptor group leads to the dCT getting shorten a lot (2.227 Å for TBA2 and TQA2), and the reason may be that pyridine is not a strong electron-withdrawing group. Meanwhile, dyes based on the cyanoacrylic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid as acceptor have almost the same dCT value. It is also worth noting that 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine can increase the distance of charge transfer. The transferred charge also varied with the auxiliary acceptor and acceptor changing. TB series of dyes have the largest qCT among all the dyes, which are all more than 0.60e. Meanwhile, the qCT value of TQ, TS and TN series of dyes have no significantly change, except for pyridine based dyes. As shown in Fig. 2, TBA2 and TQA2 had the qCT value as 0.628 and 0.631e, respectively, which is far more than other designed pyridine-based dyes. TD series of dyes had the smallest qCT, with the value of less than 0.5e. The computed change in dipole moment between the ground and excited states is evaluated using dCT and qCT in eqn (17). Obviously, TS series of dyes had the largest change in μCT, then the TN series, and last the TQ, TB and TD series of dyes.
 Fig. 2  The main parameters for charge transfer under CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in THF. 
Fig. 3 illustrates the centroids of charge of ρ+ and ρ−, which can clearly explain the process of intramolecular electron transfer. For the D–A–π–A dyes, the ρ+ and ρ− regions are both more delocalized on the auxiliary electron-withdrawing group. These results could be ascribed to the stronger coupling interaction between the donor group and bridge, while the coupling between the acceptor group and bridge group is relatively smaller. Especially for the pyridine-based dyes, this character is more prominent, which would be unfavourable for the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. Compared with cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine induces the positive and negative density regions to keep away from the donor part of the molecule, which will produce better electron injection and low rate of recombination with the injected electron. However, the rhodanine-3-acetic acid based dyes have the ρ− region far away from the anchor group, and this would decrease the electron injection. Moreover, it can be found that BTD as additional electron-withdrawing group would form electron trap more easily. Overall, we find that the introduction of auxiliary acceptor would make for shorter distance of charge transfer, while the quantity of transferred charge varies with the changing of the molecular systems. From the comparison with the cyanoacrylic acid based dyes, we also could conclude that the 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine would be a better acceptor group to be used in both of D–π–A and D–A–π–A type dyes, while pyridine used as acceptor/anchor group in D–A–π–A type dyes is unfavourable for the electron transfer and easily to form electron trap.

3.3. Energy levels of the designed dyes
The calculated molecular orbital energy levels from HOMO−4 to LUMO+4 for all the designed dyes are presented in Fig. 4. Compared with TSA1 that does not contain auxiliary acceptor, the energy levels of all the unoccupied molecular orbital of TBA1 and TDA1 are significantly reduced, while TNA1 and TQA1 have the LUMO located at the almost same energy level with TSA1 but other unoccupied molecular orbitals decreased. To the contrary, the introduction of auxiliary acceptor group has little effect on the energy levels of the occupied molecular orbitals. The rhodanine-3-acetic acid based A3 series of dyes also follow the above feature. However, for the dyes used pyridine as acceptor (A2 series), the introduction of the auxiliary acceptor induces the energy of the unoccupied molecular orbital to reduce in different degrees. Meanwhile, for 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine based A4 series of dyes, except for TDA4 that has the energy of LUMO decreased, the other D–A–π–A dyes almost keep the same energy level with TSA4 dye. In brief, the auxiliary electron-withdrawing group plays different role in tuning the electronic properties of FMOs depending on the acceptor group of the dye sensitizers. As clearly shown in Fig. 4, the acceptor group would have more impact on the FMOs. Compared with cyanoacrylic acid based dyes (TA1), the HOMO and LUMO energies of the pyridine based dyes (TA2) increases to varying degrees, resulting in a greatly increased HOMO–LUMO gap. The rhodanine-3-acetic acid as acceptor has no obvious effect on the energies of HOMO and LUMO, but greatly decreases the energies of the other unoccupied MOs and increases the energies of the other occupied MOs. The 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine used as acceptor has partly decreased the energies of all the unoccupied MOs and slightly reduced that of the occupied MOs. The calculated energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO of all designed dyes are also illustrated in Fig. 4. The introduction of BTA and quinoxaline group has only slightly cut down the energy gap, while BTD and DPP can reduce the energy gap more effectively. For all the dyes with the same donor and linker part, the order of the energy gaps is A4 < A3 ≤ A1 < A2.
 Fig. 4  Calculated energy levels of molecular orbitals of all the dyes and the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps at the level of CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d). 
It is well worth notice that the LUMO levels of all dyes are above the CB of TiO2 (4.0 eV), suggesting that the electron injection from the excited dyes to the CB of the TiO2 can be capable and feasible, while the HOMO levels are very close to the oxidation potential of electrolyte I−/I3− (±4.8 eV). In consideration of the error on the calculation method, all the molecules were included in our study to be used as candidate dye sensitizers. However, it could be still concluded that A2 acted as acceptor in D–π–A dyes would be not good for fast dye regeneration, while A3 would be better than A1 and A3 for dye regeneration and avoid the energy waste.
3.4. Absorption spectra of the designed dyes
With the indication of chemical modification tuning the orbital energy levels, it is necessary to gain insight into the excited states giving rise to the intense absorption spectra of designed dyes and to analyze one of the key factors in DSSC, the light harvesting efficiency LHE. Fig. 5 shows the simulated electronic absorption spectra. In order to clarify the electronic transition nature of absorptions, the spectra of TS series dyes were analyzed in detail in terms of band wavelength (λ/nm), oscillator strength (f), and electronic configurations according to theoretical calculations summarized in Table 3. At the same time, the above data of all other designed dyes also have been summarized in Table S1.† To demonstrate their characteristic electronic structure, we choose TS series and TB series dyes to plot the distribution of molecular orbital wave functions in Fig. 6.

 Fig. 6  Frontier molecular orbitals of TS and TB series dyes at the level of TD-PCM-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d). The typical D–π–A and D–A–π–A character are shown. 
First of all, it is necessary to investigate the influence of different acceptor/anchor in D–π–A dyes. As shown in Fig. 5(a), all TS series of dyes have an intense absorption band at the lower energy, which can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer. The corresponding electronic configurations mainly involve the transitions from HOMO−1 to LUMO and HOMO to LUMO. Compared with TSA1 that has the lowest energy absorption located at 496 nm, TSA3 and TSA4 only have a very slightly bathochromic shift to 503 and 504 nm, respectively. However, the ICT band of TSA2 is largely blue-shifted to 428 nm, which could be explained by the poorer charge migration as illustrated in Section 3.2. It is interesting to note that the oscillator strength of TSA2, TSA3 and TSA4 are all higher than TSA1, which may help to achieve an improved LHE. Except for the ICT bands, the additional absorption bands between 300 and 400 nm are raised in TSA1, TSA3 and TSA4, while it disappeared in TSA2. TSA1 exhibits three absorption bands peaking at 370, 337 and 304 nm, respectively, with the mainly electronic transitions from HOMO to LUMO/LUMO+1, and HOMO−1 to LUMO+1. TSA3 also has three absorption bands located at 381, 345 and 319 nm, respectively, which are all slightly blue-shifted compared with those of TSA1. Meanwhile TSA4 only presents two absorption bands located at 348 and 319 nm, respectively. However, TSA2 only has a very weak absorption band at 338 nm, suggesting that pyridine used as acceptor in D–π–A dyes may be unfavourable for the light harvesting in UV region. The acceptor group could lead to various influences on the absorption spectra depending on what it is.
Compared with TS series dyes, the electronic absorption spectra of the TB series of dyes have greatly changed (Fig. 5(b)). The introduction of the BTD group leads to the red-shifted of the ICT bands of all the TB dyes. For TBA1, TBA3 and TBA4, the absorption bands are peaking at 517, 522 and 520 nm, respectively, with the red-shifted ∼20 nm compared to TS dyes having the same acceptor. The corresponding electronic transitions are mainly containing that from HOMO−1 to LUMO, HOMO to LUMO and HOMO to LUMO+1, which are not completely the same with the TS series dyes. TBA2 has the maximum absorption band red-shift 60 nm to 488 nm compared to TSA2, with the electronic transitions mainly from HOMO−1 to LUMO and HOMO to LUMO. However, it is worth noting that the oscillator strength of TBA2 is greatly decreased, which may be due to the larger qCT but the smaller dCT. Meanwhile, TBA1, TBA3 and TBA4 have an additional absorption band at about 420 nm corresponding to the transitions from HOMO−2 to LUMO, HOMO−1 to LUMO, and HOMO to LUMO+1. The other absorption bands of TBA1, TBA3 and TBA4 cover the area from 280 to 350 nm with the bands also mainly involving the transitions from HOMO−2 to LUMO, HOMO−1 to LUMO+1, and HOMO to LUMO/LUMO+1. TBA2 has the other absorption bands located at 379 and 348 nm, respectively.
When it comes to TD series dyes, the ICT bands are greatly red-shifted (Fig. 5(c)). For TDA1, TDA3 and TDA4 dyes, they are all peaking at about 586 nm, with basically the same contribution of electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO and HOMO−1 to LUMO, which means that the acceptor group has rarely influence on the ICT band when DPP group is introduced into the π bridge of the D–A–π–A dyes. The absorption strength follows the order of size that TDA3 > TDA4 > TDA1. Meanwhile, the maximum absorption band of TDA2 is still blue-shifted compared to TDA1, which is located at 547 nm with the transition nature from HOMO to LUMO (87%). It is interesting to note that compared with TDA1, TDA3 and TDA4 have a moderate absorption band both peaking at 425 nm. All of the TD series dyes have an additional moderate absorption band located between 350–400 nm.
However, for the absorption spectra of the TN series dyes (illustrated in Fig. 5(d)), the introduction of the BTA group has little effect on the specific location of the ICT band compared with TS series dyes. The main difference is that the oscillator strength of TNA1 is greatly improved. Another notable property is the additional absorption bands located between 300–400 nm. It is clear that TNA4 has a moderate absorption band located at 391 nm, which is nearly disappear for TNA3 and TNA1 and without containing for TSA4.
The electronic absorption spectra of TQ series dyes are displayed in Fig. 5(e). Clearly, compared with TS dyes, the ICT bands of TQA1, TQA3 and TQA4 are blue-shifted to 470, 481 and 480 nm, respectively, which could be explained by the larger dihedral angles Θ1 and Θ2 (see Table 2). The quinoxaline group decreases the oscillator strength of TQA2 compared to TSA2, which may be the same reason as TBA2. The acceptor primarily affects the other absorption bands except for the ICT bands. As shown in Fig. 5(e), the other absorption bands of TQA1 are located around 300 nm, while there is no obvious absorption between that and the ICT band. TQA2 has two weak absorption bands located at 358 and 323 nm, respectively. However, TQA3 only has the next absorption band located at 326 nm, besides the ICT band. It is also interesting to find that although TQA4 only has one additional absorption band, but it is located at 396 nm, which may be favourable for the light capturing.
3.5. Evaluating the tendency of electron injection
Based on the equations in Section 2.1, we provide the ΔGinject, as well as EdyeOx and  for all the dyes in Table 4. It can be found that all the ΔGinject values are very negative (<−1.45 eV), which means that the dye excited state lies above the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2, thus it is favouring the electron injection from the excited-state dyes to the CB edge of TiO2. It should be pointed out that all the compounds listed in Table 3 show a quite close oxidation potential to the I−/I3− redox potential (4.8 eV). Considering the error of the calculation and TSA1 that has been proved to be a good dye sensitizer used in DSSCs, it can be concluded that the driving force for all the oxidized dyes is large enough to ensure efficient regeneration.

To seek out the relationship between the (auxiliary) acceptor and the electron injection efficiency, it is necessary to have a detailed analysis of the data listed in Table 4. Obviously, for the dyes that have the same π bridge, A1-, A3- and A4-based dyes have the almost equal value of ΔGinject, while A2-based dyes have the largest value of −ΔGinject. That is to say, pyridine as acceptor group may lead to faster electron injection from the excited state than the other acceptor group. However, as discussed in Section 3.2, pyridine is not a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the introduction of auxiliary acceptor conduces to form electron trap, the larger −ΔGinject may produce energy waste. Meanwhile, it could be found that the acceptor has little effect on the value of EdyeOx when the dyes have identical donor and bridge unit. The BTD and DPP group used as auxiliary acceptor results in the slightly larger EdyeOx, which would be good for the regeneration of the dye cation radical, while BTA and quinoxaline have very little impact compared with terthiophene based TS series dyes. The order of the −ΔGinject is TD < TB < TS ≈ TN < TQ, which suggests that DPP and BTD as auxiliary acceptor would reduce the electron injection efficiency, while the BTA and quinoxaline lead to faster electron injection. Although BTD, DPP, BTA and quinoxaline are all electron-withdrawing group, the eventual outcome are different. The main reason may be that the electron distribution of the ground and excited state of different auxiliary acceptor based dyes are disparate with each other.
It is also necessary to point out that a dye that performed well on the electron injection should couple strongly between the anchoring group and the semiconductor, and it has been verified by Troisi et al. that this coupling is determined by the LUMO orbital weight of the dye on the atoms of the anchoring group.74 As shown in Fig. 6, the 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine based dyes has more electron distributed on the atoms of the anchor group for the LUMO, and that for cyanoacrylic acid also occupies a certain weight. However, for pyridine based dyes, the value becomes very small, especially when the dyes have an additional electron withdrawing group. When it comes to A3 based dyes, the electron even does not distributed on the rhodanine-3-acetic acid, which means badly electron injection. In general, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine would be a better acceptor for D–A–π–A dyes than cyanoacrylic acid, while pyridine could perform better in D–π–A dyes in consideration of larger −ΔGinject but not in D–A–π–A dyes. The rhodanine-3-acetic acid based D–π–A and D–A–π–A would not be efficient for electron injection, especially its value of −ΔGinject is even smaller than the other three acceptors.
3.6. Evaluating the tendency of charge recombination
Generally, the electron of the photo-excited dyes could be very rapidly injected into the CB of the TiO2, while in contrast, the injected electron in the CB could recombine with the oxidized dyes or the oxidized component in the electrolyte (I−/I3−). Thus, it is critical to evaluate the tendency of charge recombination,58,75 which could be roughly obtained following the equations listed in Section 2.1. The corresponding results are shown in Table 5. The free energy change ΔG and reorganization energy λi are both essential to predict the order of F(E). It is found that the cationic form is most effectively stabilized in the A2 based sensitizers in every series of dyes. Meanwhile, the stabilized cationic form is opposite of the change of ΔG, which decreases in order of A2 → A3 → A1 → A4-based molecules in every series dyes. Furthermore, the auxiliary acceptors also can affect the stabilization of the dyes' cationic form, and the value of ΔG is decreased in the order of TN > TS > TD > TQ > TB series dyes. The hole reorganization energy λh of TS dyes is almost twice of all the D–A–π–A dyes, while the electron reorganization λe is slightly affected, which suggests that the auxiliary acceptor would favor the separation of the hole-charge. It is also clear to find that the value of λe is decreased in order of A2 > A1 > A3 > A4 for TS, TB, TN and TQ families, while it rarely changes for TD series dyes with the possible reason that DPP is a much stronger electron withdrawing group. Therefore, on the basis of ΔG and λi, it could be concluded that F(E, G, λ) maximum for A2-based and TS series dyes occurs closet to the CB, and would render the largest values of F(E, G, λ), which represents the increasing charge recombination and is negative for the efficient electron injection. To the contrary, the values of F(E, G, λ) for A4-based dyes would be the smallest, especially for TBA4, TNA4 and TQA4 dyes that should possess the relatively slower recombination rate.

3.7. Dipole moment
Experimental76 and theoretical44,77,78 studies have demonstrated that there is a correlation between the vertical dipole moment μnormal of the absorbed dyes and the energy shift of ECB in the CB edge of semiconductor of the liquid DSSCs. As discussed in Section 2.2, the value of VOC could be used to roughly evaluate the change tendency by the calculated μnormal of the isolated dyes.
It is generally accepted that the larger μnormal, the larger VOC. The binding modes of all the dyes with different acceptor/anchor group are list in Scheme 2. For A1 and A3, the bidentate binding mode has been adopted, we make the C2 axis of the carboxylate in the dye parallel to the x-axis, and the semiconductor surface is parallel to the yz plane. For A2 and A4 acceptor groups, the pyridine ring and rhodanine ring in the dyes are parallel to the x-axis, respectively. The character data for all the dyes are listed in Table 6. It is clearly shown that different type of the acceptor group could significantly influence the value of μnormal. The A2-based dyes in every family have the μnormal much smaller compared to A1-based dyes due to the reason that pyridine is not a strong electron-withdrawing group. Although rhodanine-3-acetic acid is a common dye acceptor, the A3-based dyes display the smallest μnormal, and the possible reason is that the whole A3-based molecules have a small angle with the surface of semiconductor. For TS series dyes, TSA4 has the μnormal value only slightly smaller than TSA1, which are 11.68 and 10.41 Debye, respectively. However, with the introduction of the auxiliary acceptor, the A4-based dyes even have the μnormal value catch up with even surpass the A1-based dyes in every D–A–π–A family. Thus, it could be figured out that the 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine would be a better acceptor/anchor group compared with cyanoacrylic acid for D–A–π–A type dyes. In addition to the influence of the acceptor unit on the μnormal, the effect of the auxiliary acceptor could not be negligible. Take A1-based dyes for example, the DPP group would help to yield an enhanced μnormal, so it is with the BTD group, while the BTA and quinoline group could render reverse result.

3.8. Intermolecular interaction between dye and I2
On the basis of the calculated data above, the TNA4 and TQA4 are screened out to be better candidates, due to the reason that their performances are optimized to achieve a balance among competing factors, including the ICT character, LHE, ΔGinject, λ, and the μnormal, with respect to the reference dye TSA1 for application as dye sensitizer in DSSCs in our investigation. However, from the operation mechanism of the DSSCs, we know that the injected electrons in the CB of the semiconductor could also recombine with the oxidized dyes and the redox couple in the electrolyte, especially the latter one is the main route of electron photovoltage losses which would lead to decreased nc, exerting detrimental effect on the VOC.79,80 Therefore, to reveal the conjugation order effects on the recombination kinetics of the cell, we also investigated the interaction between the three dyes and the electron acceptor in electrolyte, which could affect the local concentration of iodine near the semiconductor surface. It is generally known that the high iodine concentration in the vicinity of dye coated TiO2 surface would lead to the electron lifetime in the CB being shorter and thus the interfacial charge recombination being accelerated. It is apparent that nitrogen of CN, sulfur of thiophene and rhodanine ring in the organic dyes could form the halogen bonding through the non-covalent interaction, and the formation of dye–I2 complex has also been reported in the experiment.81 Furthermore, I3− could also accept the electrons in the TiO2 besides I2, while Green et al.82 have demonstrated that the rate of electron recombination with I2 is 2 order of magnitude faster than with I3−, thus in this work only I2 has been considered as the electron acceptor for electron combination in the electrolyte. Based on the optimized geometries of the dye–I2 complex, the binding energies of I2 with different electron donor sites on the three dyes after basis set superposition error (BSSE) were then calculated to determine the preferred binding site and the results are listed in Fig. 7. For each dye, the S atoms are labeled as S0 (rhodanine), S1 (thiophene), and S2 (thiophene) in turn from the acceptor toward the donor part. It is clearly showed that, for dye TSA1 using cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor/anchor group, the TSA1–CN–I2 complex has the largest binding energy (−7.09 kcal mol−1), which is significantly larger than that of other sites. While for dye TNA4 and TQA4 using 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine as acceptor/anchor group, the binding energies of dye–CN–I2 are largely reduced to −5.03 and −5.05 kcal mol−1, respectively, leading to the conjugation order changing. It is reasonable to expect that compared with dye TSA1, TNA4 and TQA4 should have much smaller iodine concentration around the acceptor part when the dyes are anchored on the semiconductor surface. The auxiliary acceptor could also have non-ignorable impact on the interaction energy. For TNA4 that uses benzotriazole as auxiliary acceptor, the most preferred binding site becomes the site S2 (−5.43 kcal mol−1), which is even larger than TNA4–CN–I2 (−5.03 kcal mol−1). The binding energy of TNA4–S0–I2 (−4.15 kcal mol−1) and TNA4–S1–I2 (−4.21 kcal mol−1) are both largely reduced compared to dye TSA1 at the S1 site. While for dye TQA4 using quinoxaline as auxiliary acceptor, the site CN (−5.05 kcal mol−1) and site S2 (−5.02 kcal mol−1) have the similar binding energies and are larger than that of S0 and S1 positions. Furthermore, it is noted that the binding energy of TQA4–S0–I2 (−4.12 kcal mol−1) is a little larger than TQA4–S1–I2 (−3.98 kcal mol−1), and the conjugation order is just opposite to that of TSA1 and TNA4. In conclusion, we can infer that the order of the iodine concentration around the acceptor part among these three dyes is TNA4 < TQA4 < TSA1. As demonstrated by O'Regan,83 it could be known that the lifetime of electron in the CB is in order of dye TNA4 > TQA4 > TSA1. Finally, we concluded that dye TNA4 would have the smallest electron recombination rate, which would produce a larger VOC.

4. Conclusion
In brief, a series of dimethoxyl-substituted triphenylamine-based organic dyes with D–A–π–A configuration have been designed and studied theoretically. Comprehensive calculations and parallel comparisons are implemented to interpret the role of that the auxiliary acceptor and acceptor play in the performance of DSSCs, thus we successfully screen out dye TNA4 as the most promising candidate among all the designed molecules in this work due to that it performs better on the key parameters such as charge transfer, light harvesting efficiency LHE, adsorbed dipole moment, kinetics of electron injection, and recombination. Meanwhile, it is necessary to point out that the different additional electron-withdrawing group used as auxiliary acceptor would have diverse effect on the properties of the dyes, which tells us to choose the auxiliary acceptor carefully. Furthermore, it also should be noted that the 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine would be a promising alternative to the widely adopted existing acceptor group, cyanoacrylic acid, for dye sensitized solar cells with iodine-free redox mediator. We hope this work is helpful for the design of organic dyes with target properties to improve the performance of DSSCs.
