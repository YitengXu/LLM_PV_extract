Specifically, functionally tailored HTMs that aid in mitigating charge transport limitations and interfacial defects and thereby enhance the performance of both indoor and outdoor PPVs are being sought after. Herein, we developed a novel graft-type polymer composed of a benzo[1,2-b:4,5:b′]dithiophene-based main chain and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains as an efficient dopant-free HTM for PPVs. Through a systemized tailoring of the contents of the side chains, we were able to control the hole transport and interfacial passivation abilities of the graft-type polymeric HTM. The polymeric HTM with an optimized PEG side chain exhibited a higher hole mobility, a reduced amount of interfacial traps, and an enhanced device stability compared to the control polymeric HTM. The PPVs capped with the optimized graft-type polymeric HTM demonstrated remarkably high power conversion efficiencies up to 38.2% and 21.7% under 1000 lux LED and AM 1.5 solar illuminations, respectively.
1. Introduction
Among organic and inorganic semiconductors for next-generation photovoltaics, organometallic halide perovskites have recently emerged as revolutionary materials by virtue of their remarkable intrinsic characteristics such as high optical absorption coefficient, solution processability, high charge-carrier mobility, and cost effectiveness, which afford exceptionally high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), almost rivaling silicon photovoltaics within a short period of time.1–3 This impressive prospect has further led to the extension of their on-going research and potential applications in the photovoltaic domain from light harvesting under high intensity 1-sun illumination to artificial energy recycling of low intensity indoor light such as in compact fluorescent lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are capable of operating low-power consumption electronics including powering sensors, wireless nodes, and small displays.4–10
This milestone in perovskite photovoltaics (PPVs) has also been achieved via a holistic and elaborate material selection as well as device engineering protocols, such as compositional tuning and engineering of the light absorbing layer,11–14 diverse doping strategies,15–17 interfacial engineering,18–21 and modification of charge-transporting layers,22–27 which culminate in reduction of defects, charge traps and recombination centers within the light absorber, interfaces and charge transport layers, thereby boosting the performance of PPVs.28 The development of charge transport layers, specifically efficient and multifunctional hole transport materials (HTMs), has also been observed to be a noteworthy prerequisite for achieving high performance PPVs.29–32 Thus, in addition to their empirical usage as transport materials of photogenerated charges, HTMs have been investigated as active layer encapsulants that shield the perovskite photoactive layer from external degradative agents and interfacial passivators that fill uncoordinated traps. These pursuits have resulted in the improved efficiency and device stability for PPVs.33,34
Recently, several dopant-free HTMs employed in the conventional n–i–p configuration, particularly for outdoor PPVs (OPPVs), have been developed considering the above criteria.29–36 Unfortunately, the roles of HTMs have rarely been extended to augment the performance of indoor PPVs (IPPVs). However, a HTM's function in controlling interfacial defects and charge transport losses is imperative in maximizing the minute amounts of photo-generated carriers available under dim light.37–40
Herein, we report a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-grafted conjugated polymer as a promising dopant-free HTM for IPPVs. A graft-type copolymer is composed of different repeating units between the main polymer backbone and the branched side chains, and possibly affords various functionalities depending on the structural units in each chain. Specifically, our design strategy combined the benzo[1,2-b:4,5:b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based conjugated backbone for efficient hole transport and PEG side chains for interaction with the perovskite layer (Scheme 1). We further precisely tuned the charge-transport and interfacial properties of the graft-type HTM by controlling the inserted amounts of the PEG-grafted thiophene monomer units during random copolymerization. Additionally, via optoelectronic simulation, SCAPS-1D (solar cell capacitance simulation), we probed the PV parameter's dependence on charge transport and interfacial traps for IPPVs. This revealed that reducing the interfacial trap density at the perovskite/HTM interface is a more significant factor contributing to higher performance than increasing the HTM's mobilities in our IPPVs. As a result, compared with the control linear type HTM, our optimized graft-type HTM demonstrated an enhanced charge-carrier mobility, a reduced amount of surface traps, and an impressive PCE of 21.7% under 1.5 AM illumination. Furthermore, a remarkable PCE of up to 38.2% was observed under 1000 lux LED illumination, which to the best of our knowledge is the highest reported efficiency for PPVs investigated under indoor light conditions.

2. Results and discussion
PEG-containing thiophene monomer units (Mn of PEG ∼2 kDa) were synthesized through Steglich esterification by following a previously reported method.41 A series of graft-type copolymers were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction by varying the ratio between non-grafted thiophene and PEG-grafted thiophene units (y = 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1%, named P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively) (Scheme 1). For developing high performance graft-type HTMs, a BDT unit was introduced to enhance the π–π interaction between the polymeric chains with improved coplanarity of the conjugated backbone,42–45 while the PEG polymer was used as grafted side chains to minimize the interfacial charge recombination by passivating the perovskite surface.30,33,42 The existence of the PEG side chain was verified using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The signal associated with the PEG polymer appeared at around 3.65 ppm and only slight differences (<10%) between the composition and feed ratios (x unit/y unit) were observed in the PEG grafted-polymers (Fig. S1 and Table S3†).
The bandgaps and energy levels of HTMs were studied using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer in the film state (Fig. 1c) and cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S2a†), as summarized in Table 1. All HTMs possessed an almost identical bandgap of 1.95 eV, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.13 eV and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of −3.18 eV. These results indicate that all HTMs have suitable energetic alignments with the perovskite layer, thereby facilitating efficient hole-transfer and electron-blocking (Fig. 1a). Therefore, the effects of energetic differences of HTMs on the photovoltaic performances could be considered negligible. Additionally, the polymers showed high thermal stability without significant degradation at 350 °C (Fig. S2b†).

Fig. 1b and c show the absorption spectra of the HTMs in chlorobenzene solution and the film state. All HTMs showed identical positions of the maximum absorption peaks (∼520 nm for solution and ∼530 nm for the film state) with similarly strong shoulder peaks in both states. Only a slight decline in the intensities of shoulder peaks after the grafting with PEG side chains would imply that the introduced PEG chains do not significantly hamper the π–π stacking interactions between polymer chains.29,30 The crystallographic properties of HTMs were further probed by grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. 1e and f, all HTMs showed the presence of π–π stacking (010) peaks along the out-of-plane (qz) direction and (100) lamellar peaks along the in-plane (qxy) direction, which indicates a preferred face-on molecular packing of HTMs. Increasing interchain distances due to the PEG-grafting, 20.9, 21.2, 21.7 and 22.4 Å for P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively, were observed. However, the π–π stacking distances of HTMs (3.92 Å) were estimated to be maintained regardless of the amount of PEG-grafting. More importantly, as shown in Fig. 1d, the graft-type P2 polymer prepared with 0.25% PEG-grafted thiophene units afforded a more prominent π–π stacking peak at qz ≈ 1.61 Å−1 than the pristine P1 polymer. Thus, it could be deduced that an appropriate amount of PEG-grafting on the polymer backbone facilitated the conjugated polymer to form a much preferred face-on orientation, which would contribute to the improved vertical charge transport. However, a further increase of PEG-grafting led to steady reduction in the amount of face-on oriented crystallites, as evidenced by the decreased intensities of π–π stacking peaks in the qz scans of P3 and P4 HTM films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also employed to investigate the nanoscale morphology of HTM films. As portrayed in Fig. S3,† progressively less clustered polymer strands with decreasing root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values of 4.0, 3.7, 3.1 and 2.9 nm were determined for P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively. The hole transport abilities of HTMs depending on the content of PEG side chains were studied by measuring space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) mobilities under dark conditions using hole-only devices (indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/HTM/Au), as depicted in Fig. 2a. Among the HTMs, the P2 HTM provided the highest average hole mobility (μh) of 3.97 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is approximately 21% enhancement compared to the average hole mobility (μh) of 3.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 of control polymer P1. This is attributed to the more intense preference for a face-on orientation on the substrate (Table 2). A further increase in the PEG-grafting content resulted in a steady decline in the average hole mobility (μh) for P3 and P4 HTMs affording values of 3.43 × 10−4 and 2.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This observation is deemed to stem from the increase in the destructive effect of the high PEG content on the molecular ordering of the main conjugated backbone (Fig. 1d). In addition, inherent insulative PEG could impede efficient charge transport and carrier collection by blocking the charge pathway when grafted to the main polymer backbone beyond a threshold.46

Interfacial passivation of the perovskite layer depending on different HTMs was explored by performing steady-state photoluminescence (PL) analysis, as shown in Fig. 2b. The perovskite capped with the PEG-grafted P2 HTM was found to offer an improved PL intensity accompanied by an obvious hypsochromic shift from 778 to 772 nm compared with that of the control P1 HTM. This implies that the insertion of the PEG side chain enables the passivation of defect-traps at the perovskite/HTM interface.45,47 The reduced passivation abilities of P3 and P4 HTMs compared with that of P2 would suggest that the excessive amounts of PEG side chains generated insufficient passivation and/or additional traps at the perovskite/HTM interfaces and thus appropriately combined exposure of thiophene-containing conjugated backbones and PEG chains to the perovskite layer is required for effective suppression of charge-carrier losses through interface recombination.29,48,49 Improved perovskite passivation with the P2 HTM was also supported by time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) analysis, as shown in Fig. 2c. When TR-PL decay curves were fitted using a bi-exponential function, the perovskite film capped with the P2 HTM afforded a prolonged carrier lifetime than those with other HTMs (Table S4†).
The photovoltaic performances of IPPVs with different HTMs were studied using a planar heterojunction device: ITO/SnO2/(MA0.91FA0.09)Pb(I0.94Br0.06) perovskite (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium) (bandgap ∼ 1.58 eV)/polymeric HTM/Au, as shown in Fig. 3a.50 A well-defined layer-by-layer stacking of deposited layers and a uniform capping of the perovskite light absorbing layer by HTMs were confirmed from the cross-sectional and surface topology scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S4†). The absorption spectra and energetic bandgap (edge) of the LED light source and the perovskite utilized for this investigation are also displayed in Fig. S5a and b.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of IPPVs measured under 1000 lux white LED illumination (5000 K daylight, 0.37 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3b and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. IPPVs fabricated with the PEG-grafted P2 HTM demonstrated an improved PCE up to 38.2% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 188 μA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 78.7% compared with the control devices using the homopolymer P1 HTM (a PCE of 31.0% with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 176 μA cm−2 and a FF of 72.8%). These efficiencies of P2 devices were meaningfully higher than those of a previously reported IPPV with a dopant-free HTM51 and even surpass those of IPPVs with doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) (Fig. S5c and Table S5†).40,51–58

PCE enhancement when using the optimized HTM was also observed under AM 1.5 illumination, as depicted by the representative J–V curves (Fig. 3c). The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Fig. 3d and Table S6,† respectively. P2 HTM-capped devices demonstrated the champion PCE of 21.7% with a VOC of 1.16 V, a JSC of 24.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 77.9%. This indicates that the P2 HTM provides higher efficiency under 1-sun illumination than previously reported polymeric HTMs modified with an ethylene glycol side chain and has a comparable performance with other types of dopant-free HTMs for high performance n–i–p OPPVs (Table S7†).15,18,20,23,24,30,33,36,42,45 In addition, this is also a significant improvement over the performance of the P1 HTM, which showed a PCE of 17.4% with a VOC of 1.09 V, a JSC of 22.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.5%. We attribute these improved photovoltaic properties of the P2 HTM to the introduction of PEG-grating, which in turn enhanced the hole transport and the passivation abilities of the layer. This led to the facilitated extraction/collection of photo-generated charge carriers with reduced interfacial recombination (Fig. 2). Moreover, OPPVs prepared with polymeric HTMs with increased PEG-grafting reflected the progressive decline of device efficiencies of 33.9% and 32.9% for P3 and P4, respectively.
To assess the trap densities within IPPVs, perovskite hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/HTM/Au were fabricated. Fig. 3e illustrates the I–V curves obtained from the respective perovskite devices capped with different HTMs. The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) values of P1, P2, P3 and P4 devices were determined to be 0.82, 0.45, 0.56 and 0.65 V, respectively, and their corresponding trap densities were calculated to be 8.09 × 1015, 4.51 × 1015, 5.56 × 1015 and 6.38 × 1015 cm−3.59,60 This result confirms that the VOC enhancements of IPPVs employing the PEG-grafted P2 HTM originate from the reduced trap densities at the perovskite/HTM interface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), with an equivalent circuit model (Fig. S6a and b†), was also performed to gain insight into the different charge recombination behaviours between IPPVs with control P1 and optimized P2 HTMs. As shown in Table S8,† the P2 IPPV showed a reduced series resistance (RS) of 44.5 Ω accompanied by a prolonged interface recombination lifetime of 187 μs and a bulk recombination lifetime of 239 μs, compared to the P1 device (RS = 60.5 Ω, interface recombination lifetime =3.14 μs, and bulk recombination lifetime =135 μs).24
The stabilized-power-output assessments of unencapsulated IPPVs with P1 and P2 HTMs were performed by tracking their maximum power point (MPP) under 1000 lux white LED illumination under ambient conditions (40% relative humidity and 25 °C room temperature) (Fig. 3f). Upon continuous irradiation, both devices were observed to be capable of delivering appreciably stable current densities during their operation. However, the IPPV with P1 showed a faster decline, retaining only 71% of its initial efficiency after 24 hours, than the device with P2, which retained almost 98% of its efficiency after the same duration. From this result, we deduce that, compared to the control polymer P1, the P2 polymer affords a better interaction with the perovskite layer owing to its PEG chains and thus presumably slows down the process of ion migration, resulting in the enhanced perovskite stability.61 The atmospheric stability of the unencapsulated IPPV with our optimized P2 HTM was also probed by storing it under ambient conditions (40% relative humidity and 25 °C room temperature) for a month. As displayed in Fig. S6c,† P2-based PVs retained ∼90% of their averaged initial values in 30 days, which is comparable to and even exceeds that of a recently reported HTM with a tetraethylene glycol side chain.33
We performed numerical simulation using SCAPS-1D, to reveal the detailed influences of hole mobility and interfacial trap density on the PCEs of IPPVs under indoor light conditions (Fig. 4a and b). We modelled a planar heterojunction PPV based on the experimental structure and the detailed material properties of each layer are described in Table S2.† A PCE contour plot (hole mobility vs. defect density) depicts that the PCE mostly relies on the interfacial defect density, while the hole mobility in the range of ∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 does not change the PCE significantly (Fig. 4a and b). We further observed that both FF and PCE drastically dropped as the hole mobility decreased to below ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4c). However, all polymeric HTMs synthesized in this work showed hole mobilities over 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which implies that the major contributing factor of PCE enhancements in P2 IPPVs is not improved carrier mobility. On the other hand, the PCE of IPPVs showed strong dependence on the defect density (1015–1017 cm−3) as described in Fig. 4d. Specifically, the FF gradually decreased as the defect density increased (Fig. S8†). We also found that, under indoor light conditions, the FF showed higher sensitivity to the trap density. Therefore, for devices under indoor light conditions, reduced trap density is a more significant physical property than for devices under outdoor 1-sun conditions. These results elucidate that the newly designed graft-type polymer P2 suppresses the interfacial trap density and thereby improves the PCE under indoor light operation.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a new graft-type polymeric HTM consisting of a BDT-based conjugated backbone for efficient hole transport and PEG side chains for interaction with the perovskite surface. Our investigations revealed that the P2 HTM possessing an optimized grafting of PEG side chains afforded an enhanced charge carrier mobility, a well-developed face-on orientation, and a reduced interfacial recombination loss with improved passivation of the perovskite surface. As a result, both IPPVs and OPPVs with the optimized graft-type P2 HTM exhibited higher PCEs up to 38.2% and 21.7%, respectively, accompanied by the improved device stability relative to the control device with the non-grafted P1 HTM (PCE = 31.0% for IPPVs and 17.4% for OPPVs). This study buttresses and entrenches the role of highly functionalized HTMs in mitigating photovoltaic pitfalls and realizing high performance for next generation perovskite photovoltaics.
