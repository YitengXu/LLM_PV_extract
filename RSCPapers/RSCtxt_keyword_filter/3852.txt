    , Accepted 16th February 2022First published on 17th February 2022AbstractA novel inverted perovskite/silicon V-shaped tandem solar cell is proposed based on an elaborate design of photon matching and management, in which the underutilized above-bandgap photons and unutilized below-bandgap photons are reflected from two inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to both sides of a bifacial silicon solar cell (SSC) and allows half-usage of silicon for competitive power output. Here we conduct the interface engineering and the photon management through an IWO (tungsten doped indium oxide)-based inverted PSC with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-modified NiOx hole-transport layer (HTL) and a solution-processed PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) electron transport layer (ETL) to simultaneously improve the performance of the inverted PSC and optimize the energy allocation for the bifacial SSC. The NiOx/SAM HTL improved the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC by enhancing charge extraction, while the PCBM ETL dramatically suppressed the diffuse reflection as well as parasitic absorption of the PSC by smoothing the reflective silver back electrode. These enabled a 19% PCE for a perovskite sub-cell with average near-infrared reflectance of over 85% and an 8.8% PCE for a bifacial heterojunction silicon sub-cell, yielding a power-conversion efficiency of 27.6% for a V-shaped tandem cell. This work proposes a promising V-shaped tandem cell with inverted PSCs and half-usage of SSCs, which is beneficial for reducing carbon emissions in the silicon cell industrial chain.
Introduction
With long-term development since 1976, the worldwide cumulative installed photovoltaic (PV) module power reached 756 GWp at the end of 2020, and crystalline silicon solar cells (c-SSCs) dominate the production capacity with 95% market share owing to their mature manufacturing process, excellent long-term stability, and abundant raw materials.1 The record power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction non-concentrator c-SSCs has reached as high as 26.7%.2 With further improvements in silicon cell production processes and module performance, there is no doubt that the c-SSC will continue to maintain its long-term competitiveness among the single-junction solar cells in the foreseeable future. However, since the PCE of c-SSCs is getting closer to the efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells,3 a transformational strategy suitable for large-scale applications is urgently needed to advance the mass-produced PV technology beyond the limit to tackle the global carbon emission reduction challenge.
Perovskite/silicon tandem cells have attracted extensive attention since the first report in 2014 (ref. 4) of a mechanically stacked tandem solar cell with a PCE of 17%, consisting of a semitransparent perovskite solar cell (PSC) as the top cell and a multi-crystalline SSC as the bottom cell. The PSC, a new generation PV partner of the mainstream c-SSCs in such tandem technology, is emerging as a promising PV technology with the advantages of low cost,5 simple fabrication processes,6 bandgap tunability,7 high defect tolerance,8 high absorption coefficient, and a sharp absorption edge,9 which also well satisfy the needs of a top cell for tandem applications.10 With over a decade of rapid development, the record PCE of PSCs has dramatically increased from 3.8% (ref. 11) to 25.5%.2 In addition to the remarkable PCE, the breakthroughs in up-scaling efficient perovskite layers12 and promoting device stability13 are advancing PSCs and perovskite-based tandem cells towards commercialization.
Recently, tandem cells in two-terminal (2-T) and four-terminal (4-T) configurations consisting of PSCs and various types of SSCs, such as heterojunction with intrinsic thin film (HIT) cells,14,15 tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) cells,16,17 and passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cells,18,19 have been widely explored with promising progress.20,21 For a 2-T configuration perovskite/silicon tandem cell, the perovskite top cell is directly fabricated on the bottom silicon cell to form a monolithic PV device. This configuration can reduce the use of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) but needs careful consideration in the transportability of carriers and the compatibility of fabrication processes between the top and bottom cells.22 In addition, the current matching requirement in the 2-T configuration limits the orientation of built-in potentials of the top and bottom cells to the same direction and makes the device more sensitive to spectral variations. By contrast, the 4-T configuration allows the sub-cells to be fabricated independently with optimal processes and to operate separately at their maximum power points, which significantly broadens the choice of cell structures, materials, and fabrication processes. In the context of the rapid development of PSCs and the maturity of the high-performance SSC industry, the 4-T perovskite/silicon tandem devices that can be economically feasible with lower sensitivity to PSC degradation and lower PCE requirements have great potential to advance towards commercialization in the near future.23
However, the insufficiency in solar energy harvesting (optical reflection loss24), allocating (parasitic absorption25), and converting (performance reduction of SSC under low-light conditions26) still limits the further promotion of 4-T tandem efficiency. Our previous work proposed a V-shaped perovskite/silicon tandem architecture consisting of bifacial HIT SSCs and opaque PSCs by employing a reflective tandem configuration,27,28 low-parasitic TCO, and the concept of a PV mirror29 to bridge the above deficiencies simultaneously.30 A V-shaped perovskite/silicon tandem device unit consists of a bifacial HIT SSC parallel to the incident sunlight and two PSCs placed at a 45° angle to its front and back sides. This structure allows the PSCs to simultaneously reflect unused visible (Vis) and near-infrared (NIR) light to both sides of the bifacial HIT SSC, improving the open-circuit voltage of silicon sub-cells while reducing vis light reflection losses. Our previous work30 proved that the V-shaped tandem devices can maintain a high power output under the change of the solar altitude angle over the course of a year. Most importantly, the V-shaped perovskite/silicon tandem device requires only half the amount of silicon cells compared with other tandem configurations, which shows great potential in saving production costs and reducing production energy consumption. Exciting progress has been made recently with bifacial HIT SSC-based perovskite/silicon tandem cells,31,32 indicating great development prospects. Furthermore, this architecture could be more conducive to radiative cooling for vertically aligned bifacial silicon cells.33 Nevertheless, challenges remain on the path to further improving the performance of V-shaped tandem devices.
Since the incident light of the silicon sub-cells comes from the reflection instead of the transmission by the perovskite sub-cells in a V-shaped tandem architecture, the light coupling processes are more sensitive to the parasitic absorption of layers in the PSCs due to the increase in optical path length. In the previous V-shaped tandem device, the employed perovskite sub-cell was constructed in a tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO)/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)/Au configuration. It was demonstrated that the Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer could induce significant parasitic absorption for NIR light, limiting the current of silicon sub-cells in a conventional transmissive tandem architecture,34 which will undoubtedly be more critical in V-shaped tandem architecture.35 In this respect, the inverted PSC (p–i–n) with minimal NIR parasitic absorption could be an appropriate alternative in V-shaped applications.36 Inverted PSCs have gained wide attention for their low-temperature fabrication process, negligible hysteresis, and stability in operation,37 and the record PCE is over 22.7%.38 Recently, researchers have made efforts to improve the performance of inverted PSCs, such as using amorphous metal oxyhydroxide (a-MOH)39 to enhance carrier transport at the electron transport layer (ETL)/metal electrode interface, and using ammonium halide salt (AHS)40 to assist the perovskite/ETL interface to form a passivation layer with gradient composition. As the base layers for the preparation of perovskite materials, the hole-transport layers (HTLs) play an important role in the performance of inverted PSCs with significant influence on photon transmission, perovskite crystallization, and carrier extraction.41 Recently, inorganic NiOx has been demonstrated as one of the most efficient HTLs for inverted PSCs among various hole-transport materials42 owing to its high transparency, high stability, low electrode polarization restricted, and efficient hole extraction. However, several limitations of the NiOx/perovskite interface, such as carrier accumulation and recombination, still needed to be overcome to improve the performance of inverted PSCs and inverted PSC-based V-shaped tandem devices.43
In addition, the irregularity of the polycrystalline perovskite layer will pose another challenge for V-shaped tandem devices, which is the photon management of light coupling between sub-cells. The unrestricted crystallization process can cause roughness in the perovskite surface and transfer to the following layers, including the reflective metal electrode, leading to unwanted diffuse reflection in V-shaped tandem devices. The Spiro-OMeTAD layer of the normal type PSC has been shown to be thick enough to cover the roughness of the perovskite layer and efficiently reduce the diffuse reflection in a reflective perovskite/silicon tandem device.28 However, the solution for inverted PSCs in V-shaped tandem devices still needs further investigation. As the surface roughness depends substantially on the crystallization of the perovskite layer and is therefore affected by the conditions of the NiOx/perovskite interface, the modification of the NiOx/perovskite interface will be of great significance to the performances of both the perovskite and silicon sub-cells in V-shaped tandem devices. Employing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with minimal parasitic absorption is one efficient approach to simultaneously address the problems of carriers selectivity and perovskite morphology44 for PSCs for tandem application. A SAM molecule is generally designed with an anchoring group for surface binding, a spacer group for charge transport, and a terminal group for electronic coupling.45 In addition to improving charge extraction, SAM materials such as amphiphilic silanes (AS) can also enhance interlayer adhesion toughness against solvent damage.46 Recently, a novel SAM material ([2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid, 2PACz) was synthesized47 for perovskite-based tandem application with organic phosphonic acid (PA) to anchor on the TCO surface and a carbazole derivative to extract holes from the perovskite layer. Considering that the organic PA can form strong bonds to several oxide surfaces,48,49 the excellent properties of this SAM material make it a promising candidate for NiOx/perovskite interfaces modification.
In this work, an inverted PSC was found to be more promising than a normal PSC in pursuing ultimate efficiency for V-shaped tandem devices through optical simulation. To realize a high-performance inverted perovskite/silicon V-shaped tandem cell, 2PACz was employed as a SAM material to modify the NiOx/perovskite interface of an IWO-based inverted PSC constructed for a V-shaped perovskite/silicon tandem device. The mechanisms through which the NiOx/SAM HTL performs better in improving efficiency and reducing surface roughness of an inverted PSC compared to the single NiOx or SAM HTL were thoroughly investigated. Additional light management was conducted by [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which can simultaneously suppress the diffuse reflection loss and parasitic absorption loss from the PSC to increase the energy allocated to the bifacial HIT SSC. These enabled a high PCE of 27.6% for a perovskite/silicon V-shaped tandem device with half usage of SSC.
Results and discussion
Structural and optical properties of NiOx/SAM-based perovskite films
According to the V-shaped tandem architecture, the incident solar energy is firstly absorbed by the oblique installed PSCs and then reflected by each layer of the PSCs to both sides of a bifacial SSC in between the two PSCs. Therefore, while the V-shaped tandem architecture takes advantage of reducing reflective loss from perovskite sub-cell, materials (such as doped Spiro-OMeTAD in a normal type PSC50) will cause more serious parasitic absorption in such perovskite sub-cells due to increased optical path length. This was confirmed by the optical simulation results comparing energy distribution between reflective PSCs and semitransparent PSCs with normal and inverted structures, which indicated significant superiority of inverted-type reflective PSC in suppressing parasitic absorption (Fig. S1†). Performance estimation of V-shaped tandem cells consisting of a 23%-efficiency mass-produced HIT SSC and a normal- or inverted-type PSC was conducted based on our previous work35 and the results are plotted as Fig. 1a. By employing an inverted PSC, the predicted PCE of a V-shaped tandem cell is increased by about one percentage point compared with that employing a normal type PSC, and we were able to surpass the single-junction S–Q limit efficiency of 33.7% when the PCE of the inverted PSC is 80% of the S–Q limit. Furthermore, with a 4-T output configuration, the V-shaped tandem cell can obtain a high PCE consisting of PSCs with various bandgaps. This allows us to use a perovskite composition with lower Br content to prevent photo-induced phase segregation, which can result in device degradation.51

We fabricated triple-cation perovskite films based on cesium (Cs)/formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) with composition of Cs0.05(FA0.84MA0.16)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 on three kinds of HTL (NiOx, SAM, and NiOx/SAM) for optical and structural investigation of perovskite films. The NiOx layers were fabricated through a low-temperature process by spin-coating an aqueous dispersion of NiOx nanoparticles on the IWO substrate, which was employed as a conductive glass substrate with ultralow parasitic absorption for NIR light, followed by annealing at 150 °C. The 2PACz was used as the SAM material with PA for anchoring to the oxide surfaces (NiOx and IWO) and a carbazole derivative for hole extracting from the perovskite layer (Fig. S2†). It is worth noting that the PA groups anchor only on the surface where there are still blank oxides, which makes the monolayer formation process of 2PACz molecules on oxide surfaces strongly robust with a large concentration window from 0.5 to 3 mM L−1 for spin-coating process according to the published work.52 In this work, the 2PACz layers were prepared through spin-coating a 0.25 mg mL−1 (approximately 1 mM L−1 referring to the literature52) 2PACz/ethanol solution on the NiOx and IWO surfaces.
The perovskite films on different substrates exhibit similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Fig. 1b) with dominant peaks at 14.09°, 19.97°, 31.80°, and 41.82° assigned to the diffraction of the (001), (011), (012) and (022) crystal planes of the CsFAMA-based perovskite, respectively .53 This indicates that employing SAM did not change the lattice structure of the perovskite film. Notably, the perovskite films on NiOx/SAM and SAM HTLs exhibit stronger intensity of diffraction peak than that on NiOx HTL, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values for the (012) crystal plane diffraction peak are 0.138 (NiOx/SAM), 0.136 (SAM) and 0.151 (NiOx), respectively, suggesting that the SAM can improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film. This was confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, whereby the perovskite films on NiOx/SAM and SAM HTLs show more compact grain boundaries, fewer pinholes and larger grain size (Fig. 1c–e). It was observed that the NiOx layer can enhance the wettability of the substrates (IWO/NiOx and IWO/NiOx/SAM), enabling full surface coverage of the perovskite film, while the IWO/SAM substrate exhibits less wettability to the perovskite precursor (Fig. S3†). For further investigation, we measured the contact angles of the perovskite precursor on different HTLs (Fig. S4†). The NiOx HTL showed excellent wettability to the perovskite precursor with a small contact angle of 6.3°, while the SAM HTL exhibited stronger hydrophobicity with a large contact angle of 27.3°. When the perovskite precursor was dropped on the NiOx/SAM HTL, the contact angle significantly decreased to 11.1°, since the rough morphology and exposed NiOOH on the spin-coated NiOx film surface can provide sufficient wettability for the perovskite precursor.54 The larger grain growth resistance on the hydrophilic NiOx HTL leads to a smaller average grain size of 178 nm (Fig. S5†) than the that on the bare IWO substrate (Fig. 1c and f),55,56 and weaker peak intensity for the PbI2 phase (Fig. 1b). By contrast, the perovskite grain sizes on the NiOx/SAM and SAM HTLs are significantly enlarged, and the average grain sizes are comparable to each other (230 nm versus 223 nm, Fig. S5†), suggesting that the surface modification of the SAM material promotes the growth of high-quality perovskite films. Therefore, the NiOx/SAM substrate simultaneously provides good wettability for growing uniform and smooth perovskite films (Fig. S6 and S7†) and surface modification for growing compact and large perovskite grains (Fig. S8†).57
To further investigate the influence of SAM on the transportation and recombination of carriers, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurement were conducted for the perovskite films on three kinds of HTLs. The absorption spectra of the perovskite films on the different HTLs are almost identical to each other with a sharp edge (Fig. 1g), indicating a bandgap of near 1.63 eV from the Tauc plot (Fig. S9†). This is consistent with the corresponding wavelength of the PL peaks (∼763 nm). The PL intensity of the perovskite film on NiOx/SAM is lower than that on SAM and higher than that on NiOx, regardless of whether the excitation light (405 nm) is incident from the air side or from the glass side (Fig. 1g), which can also be observed for different excitation wavelengths (Fig. S10†). However, the PL quenching mechanisms are different. With the excitation light (405 nm) incidence from the glass side, the PL lifetime of nonequilibrium carriers at the HTL/PVSK interface can be obtained from the time-resolved PL measured results (Fig. 1h). The shorter lifetimes (τ1) can be ascribed to the carrier extraction and the longer lifetimes (τ2) can be ascribed to the interface nonradiative recombination. The τ2 significantly increased from 645 ns for the NiOx/PVSK sample to 908 ns for the NiOx/SAM/PVSK sample, indicating the improved interface quality resulting from the SAM layer. In addition, the decreased τ1 as well as the increased weight of τ1 from the SAM/PVSK sample to the NiOx/SAM/PVSK sample indicate the enhanced carrier extraction by the NiOx/SAM HTL (Table S1†). It is suggested that the enhanced transportation of holes leads to the PL quenching from SAM/PVSK to NiOx/SAM/PVSK, and the PL quenching from NiOx/SAM/PVSK to NiOx/PVSK is mainly due to the increased nonradiative recombination. By contrast, the lifetimes of carriers on the surface of perovskite films based on NiOx and NiOx/SAM HTLs are shorter than that on SAM HTL (Fig. 1i and Table S2†). This is mainly caused by the increased grain boundaries of the perovskite films on wetting surfaces (Fig. S11†),56 which indicates more nonradiative recombination near the top surface of these films. Nevertheless, considering that the sunlight is incident from the glass side, and that the fullerene and its derivatives have excellent electron extraction capabilities as ETLs in complete PSC devices, these effects will be minimized.
Photovoltaic performance of NiOx/SAM-based PSCs
Inverted PSCs on three kinds of HTLs were finished by successive thermal evaporation of C60 (fullerene), BCP (bathocuproine), and Ag on perovskite films (Fig. 2a) to investigate the influence of the HTLs on the device performance. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of these devices were measured under AM1.5G 1000 W m−2 illumination with successive reverse (1.2 V to −0.05 V) and forward (−0.05 V to 1.2 V) voltage scanning at 100 mV s−1. The PV parameters of these three kinds of PSCs fabricated through identical technological processes are compared in Fig. 2b–e. With the passivation effect of SAM, the NiOx/SAM-based PSCs exhibit a significant improvement in average VOC compared to the NiOx-based PSCs (1.084 V vs. 1.006 V under the reverse scanning condition; Table 1). The average open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the NiOx/SAM-based PSCs is also slightly higher than that of the SAM-based PSCs (1.057 V). As the well-modified HTL/PVSK interface effectively reduces the nonradiative recombination, the NiOx/SAM-based PSCs, as well as the SAM-based PSCs, show a prominent increment in average short-circuit current density (JSC) compared to the NiOx-based PSCs (21.9 mA cm−2 & 22.1 mA cm−2vs. 20.5 mA cm−2 under the reverse scanning condition). Interestingly, the average fill factor (FF) of the NiOx-based PSCs, as well as the NiOx/SAM-based PSCs, is higher than that of the SAM-based PSCs and shows a more negligible difference between reverse and forward scans. Accordingly, the NiOx/SAM-based PSCs exhibit an average PCE of 17.2%, much higher than the NiOx-based and the SAM-based ones (15.6% and 16.2% for the reverse scan).

The J–V curves of the champion devices with these three kinds of HTLs are given in Fig. 2f, and the corresponding PV parameters are summarized in Table 1. The NiOx-based PSC exhibits a PCE of 16.5% under the reverse scanning condition, which is enhanced to 17.3% by replacing the NiOx with SAM. This is mainly due to the JSC increment by SAM HTL, suggesting superior suppression of carrier recombination at the SAM/PVSK interface, which can be observed in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) results (Fig. 2g). However, the FF of the SAM-based PSC is much lower than that of the NiOx-based PSC, suggesting insufficient transportation of extracted carriers by the IWO/SAM/PVSK structure (consistent with the PL measurement results in Fig. 1). By contrast, the NiOx/SAM-based PSC exhibits a champion PCE of 18.6% with overall enhanced PV parameters compared to the NiOx-based PSC, while the JSC is slightly lower than the SAM-based PSC due to the parasitic absorption of NiOx in the short-wavelength range (Fig. 2g).
To further find out why the NiOx/SAM-based PSC performs better than either the NiOx-based PSC or SAM-based PSC, we focus on the energetic alignment properties of these PCSs. To assess the energetic properties of the substrates, we measured the IWO/HTL samples and the IWO glass sample by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The work function of each material, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the SAM, and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the NiOx and IWO were obtained from the measured results (Fig. S12†). In addition, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or the conduction band minimum (CBM) of each HTL is calculated by adding the band gap obtained from the measured absorption results (Fig. S13†). The results are summarized as a schematic diagram of energetic alignment for three kinds of PSCs (Fig. 3a).

Both the NiOx and SAM show a p-type character in the results. The VBM onset of the NiOx is 0.68 eV, similar to previous research,58 and the lower work function (WF) of the NiOx (4.3 eV) is mainly due to the lower WF of the bare IWO surface (4.03 eV) compared to the bare FTO (4.8 eV), which leads to a strong offset to the VBM of the perovskite layer. In addition, the low lifetime of carriers at the NiOx/PVSK surface (from the PL measurement) indicates a mass of trap states on the NiOx surface that fosters the recombination of electrons and holes. Therefore, the NiOx-based PSC exhibited poor VOC and JSC. By contrast, the SAM HTL shows a significant promotion of WF (4.87 eV) by modifying the IWO surface WF with the PA group.59 Furthermore, with an onset of 1.09 eV, the HOMO of the SAM HTL is 5.96 eV, which is much closer to the VBM of the perovskite layer. In addition to the minimum recombination at the SAM/PVSK interface, the SAM HTL can remarkably reduce the VOC loss during the hole injection and improve the VOC and JSC of the PSC. However, a slight onset of the HOMO of the SAM HTL to the VBM of the perovskite leads to a barrier to the transportation of holes and, therefore, a low FF of the SAM-based PSC. By contrast, the NiOx/SAM HTL possesses comparable WF to the SAM HTL but a lower HOMO position that matches better with the VBM of the perovskite, eliminating the barriers in hole transportation. Meanwhile, with the modification effect by the SAM, the NiOx surface was well passivated, resulting in a larger bandgap of the NiOx/SAM layer than that of the NiOx layer (3.85 eV vs. 3.74 eV; Fig. S13†). In addition to the improved VBM of NiOx due to the uniform Fermi level between NiOx and SAM in the NiOx/SAM layer, a VBM (HOMO) level gradient from the perovskite to the HTL was formed and significantly enhanced the transportation of holes.60
The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of these PSCs were measured at 10 kHz without illumination to obtain the build-in potential (Vbi) of the devices (Fig. 3b). The NiOx/SAM and SAM-based PSCs demonstrated increased build-in potentials of 0.96 V and 0.98 V, respectively, which are much higher than that of the NiOx-based PSC (0.84 V), consistent with the measured results for the WF. In addition, the Nyquist plots of these PSCs were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement with an applied bias voltage of 1 V close to the VOC under one sun illumination (AM1.5G) (Fig. 3c). In general, the Nyquist plots of PSCs consisted of two arcs, where the high-frequency arc is dominated by the charge transportation and the low-frequency arc is dominated by the charge recombination.61,62 The Nyquist plots were fitted by the equivalent circuit63 inserted in Fig. 3c, and the fitting curves perfectly match the data points. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table S3.† The RS (series resistance), R1 (low-frequency resistance), and R3 (high-frequency resistance) obtained from the fitting results are shown in Fig. 3d. The enhanced R1 by NiOx/SAM and SAM HTLs indicates good passivation of the SAM/perovskite interface, which is consistent with the time-resolved PL measured results. However, the SAM HTL can cause a significant increase of R3 as well as RS, suggesting poor charge transportation in the SAM-based PSC, which results in a low FF.
Solar energy allocation by NiOx/SAM-based PSCs in a V-shaped tandem device
In addition to the efficiency of the PSCs, the performance of the SSCs is also essential for a V-shape tandem device, which depends heavily on the solar energy allocation by the reflective PSCs. Since the PSCs and SSCs are separated by a certain distance in a V-shaped architecture, the diffuse reflection of the PSCs can significantly influence the amount of solar energy incident on the surface of the SSCs. To investigate the influence of the optical characteristics of PSCs on energy allocation, the total reflection and diffuse reflection of the PSCs at an incident angle of 8° were measured by a spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Fig. S14†). When the light is incident from the glass side of the PSCs, the PSCs exhibit excellent spectral splitting ability that absorbs most of the vis light and reflects most of the NIR light (Fig. 4a). Further, the diffuse reflection (at an angle greater than 6.7° from the specular reflection; Fig. S14†) of vis light by PSCs is negligible, indicating that the interfaces between the glass and the perovskite layer of each PSC are smooth. However, the diffuse reflection of NIR light by PSCs with C60 ETL increased significantly, suggesting a rough surface of the Ag electrodes (Fig. 4b). Based on the assumption that the conformal growth of evaporated C60 layers transferred the surface roughness of the perovskite layer to the Ag electrodes, the PCBM was employed as an alternative ETL through solution process in order to smooth the rough surface of the perovskite and reduce the diffuse reflection by the Ag electrode (Fig. 4b). This was then proved by the profile SEM image of the PCBM-based PSC, in which the roughness of the perovskite film surface was smoothed by the PCBM layer, resulting in a much flatter Ag electrode layer compared to the C60-based PSC (Fig. 4c). As expected, the utilization of PCBM significantly reduced the diffuse reflection of the PSCs and, surprisingly, enhanced the total reflection of the PSCs (over 85% average reflectance for NIR light) (Fig. 4a), suggesting a smaller diffuse angle in PCBM-based PSCs that reduces the optical path length of diffuse light in parasitic absorption layers. The reflectance spectra from the Ag side of the PSCs further confirm that the roughness of the Ag electrodes was effectively reduced by the PCBM ETLs, proved by the dramatic decrease of the diffuse reflectance to lower than 10% over the full spectrum (Fig. 4d), which can also be easily observed from the photographs of the samples (Fig. S15†). Moreover, the reflectance of the C60-based PSCs showed an abrupt decrease at wavelength of around 370 nm due to the surface-plasmon-induced light absorption on the rough Ag surface,66 which was eliminated on the smooth Ag surface of the PCBM-based PSCs. It is worth noting that the SAM-based PSCs tend to exhibit higher diffuse reflectance among the PSCs with three kinds of HTLs, regardless of the material of the ETL, which is caused by the larger perovskite grains on the IWO/SAM substrate. The Ag electrode surfaces of these PSCs were scanned using a confocal laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) to obtain information on their surface morphology (Fig. S16†) and roughness parameters (Fig. S17 and Table S4†). The Sq (surface root mean square height; 128 μm × 128 μm area) of the C60-based PSCs are nearly twice as much as the Sq of the PCBM-based PSCs, indicating a well smoothing effect by PCBM. In addition, the Sdq (surface root mean square gradient, which was calculated as the root mean square of slopes at all points in the definition area; 128 μm × 128 μm area) and Sdr (interface expansion area ratio, which was calculated as the percentage of the definition area's additional surface area contributed by the roughness as compared to the planar definition area; 128 μm × 128 μm area) of the SAM-based PSCs are the highest among those of the PSCs with three kinds of HTLs, while those of the NiOx/SAM-based PSCs are the lowest. A larger Sdq represents steeper undulation of the rough surface, while a larger Sdr means a larger superficial area of the rough surface. This indicates that the simultaneous use of NiOx/SAM as the HTL and PCBM as the ETL minimizes the diffuse reflectance of the PSC.

(g) The EQE spectra of the standalone HIT SSC (front side), the calculated EQE spectra of the HIT SSC (front) filtered by PSCs with different HTLs and ETLs, and the corresponding EQE spectra of diffuse loss. 
The EQE curves of a bifacial HIT SSC (front side, n-type) were measured under the reflection of the PSCs at 45° to investigate the influence of the diffuse reflection on energy allocation (Fig. 4e). The integrated JSC of the HIT SSC is increased by 2.9 mA cm−2 under the reflection of the PCBM-based PSCs compared to that of the C60-based PSCs (15.7 mA cm−2vs. 12.8 mA cm−2 with the NiOx/SAM HTL). In addition, the HIT SSC under the reflection of NiOx/SAM-based PSC with PCBM exhibits the highest integrated JSC, which is 0.3 mA cm−2 higher than that under the reflection of SAM-based PSC. Furthermore, the reflectance characteristics of the PSCs at an angle of 45 degrees (Fig. 4f) and the EQE of the front side of the HIT SSC at normal incidence were measured and multiplied to obtain the calculated EQE curves of the SSC under the total reflection of the PSCs (Fig. 4g). Thus, the EQE of diffuse loss can be obtained by subtracting the measured EQE of the filtered SSC from the calculated EQE (Fig. 4g). The EQE of diffuse loss for vis light is nearly zero, which is due to the non-diffuse reflection of the PSCs for these wavelengths, indicating good matching between the measured EQE and the calculated EQE. The integrated JSC of the EQE of diffuse loss by the C60-based PSC (with NiOx/SAM HTL) is up to 1.7 mA cm−2, which is 1.2 mA cm−2 higher than that by the PCBM-based PSC. The comparison of the measured EQE and calculated EQE of both sides of the filtered SSC can be found in Fig. S18.† It is worth noting that the diffuse reflection loss in the EQE measurement does not appear to be as severe as the diffuse reflection loss in the spectral measurement. This is because in the spectroscopic test, light with a reflection angle that deviates from the normal by more than 6.7° is considered diffuse light, while most of the diffuse reflection light can still be utilized by the silicon cell, and only when the diffuse reflection angle is too large or the position of the diffuse reflection is close to the top edge of the PSCs will it cause significant losses in a V-shaped architecture (Fig. S19†). This can also show that the diffuse reflection angle of the PCBM-based PSC is much smaller than that of the C60-based PSC (Fig. 4b). In brief, by replacing the C60 with PCBM, the specular reflection of the PSCs was enhanced by simultaneously increasing total reflection and decreasing diffuse reflection.
Power-conversion performance of perovskite/silicon V-shaped tandem device
Considering practical applications, one of the most probable installation forms for V-stacked power stations is to line up multiple V-shaped units in adjacent arrays (Fig. 5a). In this way, the PSCs can reflect the obliquely incident sunlight to the SSCs of the adjacent units in the absence of a solar tracking system. In addition, the lateral diffuse reflected light from the PSCs can also be absorbed by the SSCs of the adjacent units to reduce diffuse reflection losses. Therefore, during the measurements of a single V-shaped unit device (containing one SSC and two PSCs), we placed two silver mirrors (parallel to the incident light) on either side of the tandem device between the SSC and the PSCs to collect the lateral diffuse reflected light from the PSCs to match the practical operating conditions.

The zoomed-in graph demonstrates the operating mechanism of one unit device.

(f) EQE spectra of the V-shaped tandem device as well as the sub-cells. The gray lines represent the total EQE of the tandem device corresponding to n- and p-sides. 
Encouraged by the PCBM-based PSC with improved energy allocation properties, we conducted the measurement of power-conversion performance of the perovskite/silicon V-shaped tandem device consisting of the PCBM-based PSC and the bifacial HIT SSC. The champion fabricated PCBM-based PSC exhibit a PCE of 18.8% under reverse scan with negligible hysteresis and a stabilized PCE of 18.4% at a maximum power point voltage of 0.898 V (Fig. 5b). The corresponding VOC, JSC, and FF are 1.120 V, 22.4 mA cm−2, and 75.2%, respectively. We further conducted light soaking and moisture stability measurement of the PCBM-based PSC with NiOx/SAM HTL, which was performed by continuously exposing the unencapsulated PSC to 1 sun (AM1.5G) illumination (xenon lamp) in an air environment with a relative humidity of 30–40%. Owing to the improved perovskite film quality, the PSC retained over 70% of the initial PCE after a continuous light soaking test for more than 10000 seconds (Fig. S20†). When the PSC was coupled to a bifacial HIT SSC in V-shaped tandem configuration at 45°, the EQE spectra showed a slight blue shift with respect to the standalone cell because of the change in optical path length at oblique incidence, but the integrated JSC is almost identical due to the superior wide angle response of the planar PSC (Fig. 5c).67 Surprisingly, the FF of the PSC measured at 45° increased significantly from 75.2% to 78.2% with the same aperture area to incident light, leading to an improved PCE of 19.0% (Fig. 5d and Table S5†). This is mainly caused by the enlarged operating area of the oblique cell, which can increase the cross-sectional area of the electrodes involved in carrier transportation to reduce the series resistance. It is worth noting that although the V-shaped tandem configuration requires approximately 40% more PSC area compared to the conventional tandem configuration, the oblique structure offers potential efficiency gains for PSCs and halves the amount of silicon cells, which are more expensive.
The standalone bifacial HIT SSC exhibited a PCE of 21.3% under n-side illumination and a PCE of 20.0% under p-side illumination (Fig. 5e). The difference in PCE between the n- and p-sides was mainly due to the significant difference in JSC that was induced by the parasitic absorption for short wavelengths in the p-doped α-Si: H layer (indicated by the EQE spectra in Fig. S21†).68 When the HIT SSC was filtered by the PSC, the difference in JSC was eliminated effectively (Table 2) as most of the UV-vis light was absorbed by the PSC (Fig. 5f), overcoming the disadvantage of the bifacial HIT SSC. However, as a result of the decreased JSC, the VOC of the HIT SSC decreased accordingly from 0.698 V to 0.675 V under single side filtered illumination, which is unavoidable for a silicon cell under low-intensity illumination. By employing dual side illumination with the V-shaped architecture, the VOC of the filtered bifacial HIT SSC was improved to 0.699 V, eliminating the VOC loss of the silicon sub-cell in a tandem application. Furthermore, the FF of the filtered HIT SSC was also improved to 78.9% by dual side illumination, and the JSC reached as high as 15.9 mA cm−2 (current per aperture area) and 31.8 mA cm−2 (current per active cell area) by reabsorbing the UV-vis reflective loss from the PSC (Fig. 5f), resulting in a PCE of 8.8%. Moreover, according to the EQE spectra, the utilization rates of incident sunlight for short-wavelength light (300–760 nm) and long-wavelength light (760–1200 nm) were calculated (Fig. S19 and Table S6†).69,70 By adding the average PCE (18.8%) of the PSCs that coupled with n- and p-sides of the HIT SSC, the cumulative PCE of 27.6% was obtained for the perovskite/silicon V-shaped tandem device, which is the highest among the perovskite/silicon reflective tandem devices and one of the highest in the 4-T perovskite/silicon tandem category (Table S7†). Nevertheless, compared to the mechanically stacked perovskite/silicon tandem configuration, the V-shaped tandem configuration requires only half the amount of silicon cells under the same illumination area, which can lead to significant cost savings and lower energy consumption in production.

Conclusions
In summary, we employed 2PACz ([2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid) as the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) material to modify the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL) of an inverted PSC for V-shaped tandem application. The SAM-modified NiOx improved the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cell (PSC) by two percentage points through interface defect passivation and energy level alignment while obtaining a more uniform perovskite film. Further adoption of PCBM (([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)) to replace C60 as the electron transport layer (ETL) significantly reduced the surface roughness of the silver electrode, which simultaneously increased the NIR reflectance and decreased the diffuse reflectance of the PSC. This improvement resulted in a significant promotion of the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the heterojunction with intrinsic thin film (HIT) silicon solar cell (SSC) by 3 mA cm−2. We also found that the oblique installation of the PSC in V-shaped architecture efficiently enhanced the fill factor of the PSC by reducing the carrier density in the electrodes, which will likely be a feasible technology to counter the increased series resistance when up-scaling perovskite solar modules. These improvements allowed us to demonstrate a high PCE of 27.6% with a perovskite/silicon V-shaped tandem device.
