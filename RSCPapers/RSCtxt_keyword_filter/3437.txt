    , Accepted 28th April 2016First published on 28th April 2016AbstractOrganic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskites have recently attracted great interest emerging as promising photovoltaic materials with a high 20.8% efficiency, but lead pollution is still a problem that may hinder the development and wide spread of MAPbI3 perovskites. To reduce the use of lead, we investigated the structures, electronic and optical properties of mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 theoretically by using density functional theory methods at different calculation levels. Results show that the mixed Ge/Pb perovskites exhibit a monotonic decrease evolution in band energy to push the band gap deeper in the near-infrared region and have a red shift optical absorption with an increased proportion of Ge. The results also indicate that lattice distortion and spin–orbit coupling (SOC) strength play important roles in the band gap behavior of MAGexPb(1−x)I3 by affecting the bandwidths of CBM and VBM. The calculations for short circuit current density, open circuit voltage, and theoretical power conversion efficiency suggest that mixed Ge/Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiency over 22% are superior to MAPbI3 and MAGeI3. And notably, MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 is a promising harmless material for solar cells absorber with the highest theoretical efficiency of 24.24%. These findings are expected to be helpful for further rational design of nontoxic light absorption layer for high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
ABX3 (A = Cs, organic cations; B = Pb, Sn, Ge; X = I, Br, Cl) halide perovskites, as the third-generation photovoltaics, are growing faster than other solar photovoltaics around the world over the past few years. This is because they have a rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 0.4%1 to 20.1%.2 Recently, Bi et al. fabricated a luminescent solar cell based on tailored mixed-cation perovskites achieving the highest PCE of 20.8%.3 Among these hybrid halide perovskites, prototype MAPbI3 (MA+ = CH3NH3+)4 and its analogues MAPb(IxCl/Br1−x)35,6 have displayed a rapid development and were selected as one of the largest scientific breakthroughs of 2013.7,8 Results reported to date suggest that the optical band gap of MAPbI3 is 1.5 eV with open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.1 V and short-circuit current density around 20 mA cm−2, reaching an efficiency around 20%.9,10 Kazuhiko reported that the theoretical limit of perovskite efficiency can be close to 30% with a short circuit current density of nearly 28 mA cm−2 when the optical band gaps are 1.3–1.4 eV.9 In order to get a high efficiency, many attempts have been made to obtain low band gap perovskites.10–13 Several groups have successfully reduced the band gaps by changing the organic cation to formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2) with 1.43 eV14 and 1.48 eV.15 Furthermore, the mixed Pb/Sn perovskites also present low band gaps characteristics with the band gap range of 1.17–1.31 eV.10,16
Despite the good prospect of this class of materials, the use of Pb will be bad for the environment and may hinder the wide spread of perovskite solar cells. Considering the bad effects caused by lead pollution, lead-free perovskite with low band gap investigation aimed at finding alternative hybrid perovskites is the next major challenge. Tin-based perovskites have been suggested as a substitution for lead containing perovskites.10 However, the PCE and Voc of MASnI3 are still relatively low and, in addition, the oxidation and stability of Sn2+ will give rise to structure transformation and will not exhibit significant performances.10,17 Another feasible alternative is the congener Ge2+ metal ion. The Ge halide compounds have demonstrated high ionic conductivity with perovskite structures.18 Recently, AGeI3 kind of perovskites with different organic cations have been synthesized by Kanatzidis's group and demonstrated remarkable optical properties.19 Our previous work showed that the band gap of MAGeI3 can be matched with that of MAPbI3.20 Currently, several groups have reported different experimental and theoretical results using mixed Sn and Pb perovskites (MASnxPb(1−x)I3) for their tunable band gaps and high carrier mobilities.10,16,21 According to this innovation, we suggested mixing Ge and Pb with different Ge/Pb ratios to obtain new perovskites with low tendency band gaps and good solar light harvesting properties.
A variety of theoretical studies have been reported about electronic and optical properties of lead and tin based-perovskites by using density functional theory (DFT) methods.21–31 The results indicate that, considering the heavy elements Pb, Sn and I, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect will bring down the band gap by degenerating the bands near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM). So, the results of single SOC calculation can hardly precisely describe the band gaps of the perovskites. Besides, although the screened hybrid functional Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) has been applied to the perovskites calculation,20,25,32 the results reported show a bit of over estimating the band gap. The combination of HSE06 and SOC effect was reported to give higher accuracy electronic structures.20,33 Thus, in this study, HSE06 combining with SOC was applied to calculate the electronic and optical properties as well as the photovoltaic characteristics for the short circuit current density, open circuit voltage, and theoretical power conversion efficiency for our investigation systems, the series of MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites. Based on the accurate calculation for all the mixed Ge/Pb perovskites, we hope that our results will be helpful for further experiments to find more efficient perovskites.
2. Computational details
All the calculations are performed with the VASP package34 applying the projected augmented wave (PAW) method35,36 to describe the ion–electron interactions. An energy cutoff of 500 eV was employed in the calculation. The exchange correlation functional is introduced by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)37,38 functional combining with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for structural and basic electronic calculations. The Pb 5d6s6p, Ge 3d4s4p, I 5s5p, C 2s2p, N 2s2p, and H 1s states were considered for Valence configurations. All the systems in this work take periodic boundary conditions into consideration. For reciprocal space integration, 6 × 6 × 6 and 8 × 8 × 8 Monkhorst–Pack grids were used for structural optimization and electronic property calculations, respectively. In view of the weak interactions in the perovskite systems, van der Waals (vdW) correction was considered by using the DFT-D2 method.39 Considering the heavy element effect, SOC relativistic correction was taken into account. Since the GGA-PBE gives an underestimated band gap, hybrid functional HSE06 and the more accurate calculation approach, HSE-SOC, were taken to obtain accurate electronic structures. All the presented calculations were performed with sampling at the Γ point in the Brillouin's zone. Optical properties of the mixed perovskites can be evaluated from the dielectric function ε(ω) and absorption spectra A(ω).40,41 The optical absorption coefficient α(ω) can be obtained from the real part ε1(ω) and the imaginary part ε2(ω).42–44 Simulated mixed systems with four repeated MAGexPb(1−x)I3 units are constructed for the optimization and property calculations.
Short circuit current density, open circuit voltage, and theoretical power conversion efficiency of the mixed perovskites can be calculated based on the band gap Eg. The maximum short circuit current density Jsc can be estimated by assuming that all the incident photons will be absorbed with energies larger than the Eg of the mixed perovskites and always promote the perovskites to produce electron–hole pairs after the absorption. Jsc can be calculated with the following equation:45–47 (1)where q is the electron charge and bs(E) is the incident spectral photon flux density.
Considering the relationship between the Eg of the perovskites and a variable parameter loss-in-potential Eloss, the open circuit voltage Voc can be calculated as follows:46,47 qVoc = Eg − Eloss,(2)where Eloss can be adopted with two values 0.7 eV and 0.5 eV from a previous report.47
The maximum theoretical efficiency of the perovskite η is obtained by applying the fill factor FF and the total incident power density Ps with the results of Jsc and Voc estimated in the above two equations:45–48 η = FF·Jsc·Voc/Ps,(3)where Ps is the incident power density obtained by integrating the direct normal spectral irradiance reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the following equation:45–49 (4)where E is the incident photon energy.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure properties
The simulated mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites in this work are displayed by gradually reducing the percentage of Pb atom from the starting tetragonal I4/mcm phase constructed with experimental data50,51 moving towards MAGeI3 (x = 1, trigonal R3m phase) perovskite. We simulated the structures with different Ge:Pb ratios by dividing the proportion into 1:3 (x = 0.25), 2:2 (x = 0.50), 3:1 (x = 0.75) and the pure phase of Pb (x = 0.00) and Ge (x = 1.00) perovskites. All the calculations for the three mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 systems were employed with the same tetragonal model as MAPbI3 shown containing four MAGe/PbI3 units. In regard to the species with x = 0.25 and x = 0.75, the positions of the main metal atoms are roughly equivalent. So, when x = 0.25, the Ge atom is placed at the core of the structure; for x = 0.75, three Pb atoms at the core and the vertex positions of the bulk phase were replaced with Ge atoms and the structures are shown in Fig. 1. While for x = 0.50, two Pb atoms are replaced creating three different configurations, one with the Ge and Pb atoms distributed alternatively along the (110) and (001) directions, and the other two are along (110) and (001) directions, respectively. The results of the optimized geometries for the three MAGe0.5Pb0.5I3 structures show approximately the same stability with the energy differences within 0.01 eV, which is in accordance with the conclusion of Mosconi by replacing two Sn atoms in the mixed Sn–Pb species,21 so we take one structure for example, as represented in Fig. 1. It is clear to see that the inorganic chains, i.e., Pb–I⋯Ge⋯I–Pb with the Ge atom at the center in the three mixed systems show a distortion along the c direction. The degree of distortion increases with a change of the proportion of Ge, as it goes from x = 0.00 to x = 1.00, and this can be interpreted as from the change of atomic radius.
 Fig. 1  Optimized stable geometries of the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites at DFT-F2 level (purple: Ge; brown: Pb; pink: I; green: carbon; blue: nitrogen; white: hydrogen). 
The optimized lattice constants of the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 are given in Fig. 2 and Table S1 of the ESI.† In Fig. 2(a), there is a marked constriction along c direction with the increase of x. An obvious decline trend also occurs in a direction in the range of x from 0.00 to 0.75, while when x = 1.00, the lattice shows a climbing trend. Since both a and c directions are composed of the inorganic framework, the atomic radii reduce with increasing proportion of Ge, which is the reason for the lattice constriction along a and c directions. However, the lattice shows a scattering transformation in the b direction with the change of x, which can be explained by the weak interaction between the MA+ cation and the inorganic framework. The lattice angle values of α and β shown in Fig. 2(b) deviate from 90°, the γ values deviate from 90° and 120° for tetragonal and trigonal models, respectively, which are considered to result from deformation of the structures since the incline trend is more serious with the change of x as shown in Fig. 1. The changes of lattice lengths and angles will have very large effects on their volumes. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the volume acts as a linear downward trend going from x = 0.00 to x = 0.75. When x = 1.00, the volume shows a marked constriction which is caused by lattice distortion with a fluctuation for the last Pb replaced.

The embedded figure shown in (a) is the amplification for the lattice length evolution in a and b directions with its corresponding experimental data. The embedded figure in (b) zooms in the evolution of the lattice angles with α, β, and γ when x increases from 0 to 0.75. 
The change of x also has great effects on the bond lengths of M–I (M represents the metal atoms of Pb and Ge) and M–I–M tilting angles. The detailed range of bond lengths and M–I–M angles of MAGexPb(1−x)I3 are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). In order to better visualize the variation trend, we draw the average bond lengths and M–I–M tilting angles of MAGexPb(1−x)I3 as shown in Fig. 3. The fluctuations of bond lengths of HN–I and HC–I (the red and green bar shown in Fig. 3(a)) reflect the shift of MA+ cation with the NH3 group more inclining to locate close to the outward M–I–M chain as shown in Fig. 1. The average bond lengths of HN–I also indicate that there exist hydrogen bonds between the cations and I atoms; here we define the hydrogen bond length with a value less than 2.8 Å. The fluctuations of the HN–I bond lengths further indicate that the strength of the weak interaction between the cation and the inorganic framework is related to the hydrogen bond, since the cation may move near or far away from the inorganic framework, resulting the fluctuations of the HN–I bond lengths. The bond length of apical M–I presents a gradual downward trend, which can be interpreted as the atomic radius reduction along c directions as shown in Fig. 2(a). However, the change of equatorial M–I bond length is not as obvious as that of an apical M–I bond. This means that the equatorial M–I bond has little effect on the deformation of the structure, while the apical M–I bond has a major influence on the deformation of the mixed perovskite structures. Another factor that affects structure deformation is the M–I–M tilting angle as shown in Fig. 3(b). The equatorial and apical M–I–M tilting angles show a gradual increment and reduction with the increase of x, respectively. The phenomena generated from the movement of the atoms deviated from their original sites of the octahedron in the inorganic framework resulting in deformation of the structure. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 1 that the structures begin to run off the straight with an increasing proportion of Ge.

The analyses about the changes of the lattice parameters, bond lengths, and M–I–M tilting angles of the investigated MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites indicate that the mixed Ge atoms have a great effect on the structural properties causing lattice constriction and structural deformation. Fluctuation of HN–I bond length further shows that the hydrogen bond between the cation and the inorganic framework has an important influence on maintaining the equilibrium structures of the mixed Ge/Pb perovskites.
3.2 Method calibration for band structures
In order to better explore the electronic properties of the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 series, we employed several different DFT methods, as exhibited in the computational details, to get more accurate band gaps, and the variation trends in band gap are displayed in Fig. 4. The band gaps of the four Pb-containing materials exhibit a linearly declining trend from x = 0.00 to x = 0.75 at PBE and HSE06 levels, while when x increases to 1.00, the curves with the two methods show an ascending trend. The band gaps of the three Ge/Pb mixed systems fall on a parabola, while the ends of the parabola are constructed by the pure MAPbI3 and MAGeI3. The band gaps of MAGexPb(1−x)I3 for x increased from 0.25 to 0.75 with PBE method and are 1.25 eV, 1.14 eV, and 1.11 eV, respectively, and 1.73 eV, 1.61 eV, and 1.58 eV with the HSE06 method. However, the band gaps of the two calculations with SOC (PBE-SOC and HSE-SOC) showed an upward behavior. For the results with a SOC effect, the band gaps of the three are 0.72 eV, 0.74 eV, and 0.87 eV for PBE-SOC, and 1.20 eV, 1.24 eV, and 1.33 eV for HSE-SOC, respectively, which demonstrated opposite behavior to both PBE and HSE06. The difference derives from the restriction of the system-correlation error of the methods, that is to say, PBE usually underestimates the band gaps with an intrinsic limitation of delocalization errors, and HSE06 will give overestimated ones by lifting the conduction bands, while both PBE-SOC and HSE-SOC have strong response to the conduction band for the spin–orbit coupling effect of the heavy metals.22,25,26,52–56 On the other hand, the SOC methods are from the intrinsic aspect, digging the influence of the change from the orbital energy levels and degenerate states, while PBE and HSE06 only simply reflect the fact of the change about the structural deformation caused by atomic radius reduction and lattice distortion. The above results imply that the mixed systems are good candidates of highly efficient perovskites due to their lower band gap characteristics compared with MAPbI3 and MAGeI3.
 Fig. 4  Experimental and calculated band gap trends with different methods of MAGexPb(1−x)I3 structures as a function of proportion x. Magenta square, red circle, green triangle, blue rhombus, and black snowflake curves represent the band gap trend of PBE, PBE-SOC, HSE06, HSE-SOC, and experimental, respectively. Cyan star and violet pentagon curves denote the reduction of band gap with and without SOC methods. (ΔSOC1 = EPBEg − EPBE-SOCg, ΔSOC2 = EHSE06g − EHSE-SOCg). 
Jongseob et al. have mentioned that PBE-SOC is enough to describe the band gap variation with various situations though it will underestimate the band gap.57 So, combined with the above analysis, we consider that the band gap variation trends shown in Fig. 4 with PBE-SOC and HSE-SOC are accurate to reflect the real band gap evolution, and especially, HSE-SOC will give more accurate values. To determine the hidden reasons of the two different abnormal band gap evolutions, the differences between the two separate methods with and without SOC were investigated. For SOC, it is evolved from relativistic effect, while the non-SOC comes of the steric effects relative to the change of x.58 Here, we give the reduction band gap evolution ΔSOC with cyan star and violet pentagon as shown in Fig. 4. ΔSOC is defined as the subtraction value between the band gaps with and without SOC (ΔSOC1 = EPBEg − EPBE-SOCg, ΔSOC2 = EHSE06g − EHSE-SOCg). ΔSOC is used to interpret the changes caused by the SOC effects with the proportion change of the heavy metal Pb in the structures of MAGexPb(1−x)I3. It is clear that for the parts x < 0.75, EPBEg and EHSE06g decrease linearly, in the area x > 0.75, EPBEg and EHSE06g rise up to the peak, while the values of EPBE-SOCg and EHSE-SOCg step up steadily for the region x < 0.75, and then climb sharply with the diminished SOC effect of Ge. The two ΔSOC curves vary by a linearly downward trend with the increase of x, which can be interpreted that ΔSOC decreases faster than that of the results without SOC with the change of x. EPBEg and EHSE06g decrease with the increase of structure distortion, while EPBE-SOCg and EHSE-SOCg increase with the wear off SOC effect for the Pb proportion reduction; these lead to the values in both methods being more and more closer to each other, and ultimately, the differences between EPBEgversus EPBE-SOCg and EHSE06gversus EHSE-SOCg become smaller, resulting in the ΔSOC shown with oblique decreasing lines. Besides, the curves of HSE06 and HSE-SOC, respectively compared with PBE and PBE-SOC curves take an up shift and maintain the curve shape at the same time, which further verifies that HSE06 will have an effect on lifting the band gap.
It is known that presence of the mixed perovskites with low band gaps is because of the SOC effect of the heavy Pb atom.58,59 To gain a deep insight of the evolution of ΔSOC, the partial band structures with several conduction bands and valence bands at Γ point with PBE and PBE-SOC methods and projected density of states (PDOS) of the investigated systems are shown in Fig. 5; the partial DOS for Ge, Pb I atoms for each system are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). For x = 0 (Fig. S1, ESI†), the CBM of MAPbI3 under PBE method is controlled by the three p-orbital states of Pb (|pPbx〉, |pPby〉, |pPbz〉), and the VBM is mainly from the contribution of the hybrid states of Pb s-orbital and I p-orbitals (|sPb〉, |pIx〉, |pIy〉, |pIz〉).58,60 With an increase of Ge, the CBM and VBM of the mixed systems are composed of the states of hybrid orbitals of Pb, Ge and I atoms. (|pPbx〉, |pPby〉, |pPbz〉, |pGex〉, |pGey〉, |pGez〉) and (|sPb〉, |sGe〉, |pIx〉, |pIy〉, |pIz〉) are the new states for CBM and VBM, respectively. As goes with the PDOS orbital contribution shown in the right column of Fig. 5, the red integral area rises with the increase of x while the green area falls off. The changes of the orbital contributions with the increase of Ge s-orbital and p-orbital states and the decrease of the same component of Pb also reflect the states change in their CBMs and VBMs. When SOC is considered, the states of CBM split from a two-fold degenerate state to a four-fold degenerate state at Γ point, creating the band gap reduction. The splitting effect shows a weakened trend with the Pb proportion decrease since the lighter Ge atom has a weaker SOC effect. This means that the ΔSOC is mainly dominated by the SOC splitting of Pb states at CBM.
 Fig. 5  Partial band structures of MAGexPb(1−x)I3 with PBE-SOC and PBE methods; the dashed lines represent the band gap reduction ΔSOC between the two methods, the right column is the projected density of states (PDOS) of each material, the green, red, blue, and magenta integral area represent the orbital contributions of Pb, Ge, I and MA+, respectively. 
The band structures of the first four given by Fig. 5 present similar features with fluctuation of the band shape, but the undulation is different when x = 1.00, giving a rise to the band gap and bandwidth for both CBM and VBM. In Fig. 5, the bandwidths of CBMs in both PBE-SOC and PBE band structures demonstrate a decline trend with the increase of x from 0.00 to 0.75, while the VBMs in both methods have the same energy level. This means that the energy shift-down of CBM at Γ point in PBE-SOC method is the corresponding ΔSOC value between the two band structures. We consider that these ΔSOC values and the CBM energy shifts in PBE-SOC are related to the SOC strength (λ) of metal atoms, and the CBM energy shift-up of PBE is correlated with the deviation angles of the M–I–M framework. The distortion of the lattice parameters of the mixed systems caused by the incline of the [MI6]4− octahedra is also an influencing factor for the reduction of the bandwidth of CBM. Besides, the deviation of M–I–M angle will also have a great influence on the band gaps and the overlap of the orbits between M and I atoms; Jino certified that this principle applies to all AMX3 kinds of perovskites.58,61 With the two metal's Pb and Ge atoms alloyed, the SOC strength of the mixed systems can be expressed by (1 − x)λPb + xλGe. Thus, the changed features of ΔSOC as shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that the smaller that the ΔSOC value is, the weaker the SOC effect may be. It is clear that the SOC strengths of the mixed systems show degenerative trends with a decreased proportion of Pb, which is caused by the fact that Ge has a weaker SOC effect than a Pb atom. Throughout the above analysis, the SOC strength is the key factor in determining the electronic structures of the mixed perovskites, which can regulate the band gap reduction. HSE06 has a very large effect on the structural factor of the perovskites and lifts the conduction bands energies. HSE-SOC gives the most accurate results by the push–pull energy counteraction, mediating the energy distribution of the CBM and VBM. Thus, we will use the HSE-SOC method to describe the following properties of the investigated materials.
3.3 Electronic properties
To investigate the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) shift of the mixed perovskites in detail, the density of states (DOS) were further analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6, the total density of states (TDOS) of the investigated perovskites exhibit similar curves. Apparently, there is a marked rise of the VB by varying x from 0.00 to 0.75. When x = 1.00, it gives an opposite trend, while the CB edge shows a less distinct rise. The variations between the curves of the CB and VB correspond to the band gap evolution as mentioned above. Observing from Fig. 6, all the perovskites give a similar component of the orbital contribution. VB is composed of the I 5p-orbital and Pb/Ge s-orbitals, CB is mainly made up of Pb/Ge p-orbitals, and hybridized with partial I orbitals. And both CB and VB receive the weak contribution donated from a MA+ cation. For both VB and CB shown in Fig. 6, with an increase of the Ge percentage, the orbital contribution of Pb falls sharply, and the contribution of Ge has a sharp rise. At the same time, the orbital of I also generates a movement along with the orbital contribution change of the metal, which matches well with the band gap data. On the basis of the molecular orbital analysis and band energy features of the mixed perovskites, we think that the orbital contribution between I and metal atoms is an important factor in governing the band gap. Observing the TDOS with and without SOC as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), it is worth saying that the SOC has a great effect on the orbital contribution strength of these mixed perovskites. Compared with the TDOS without SOC, the TDOS with SOC show weaker peak intensities with a weak energy splitting to the VB, which is caused by the larger spin–orbit coupling constant of Pb and I atoms, and also give rise to a shrunken band gap.
 Fig. 6  The upper figure shows the TDOS structures of the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites from x = 0.00 to x = 1.00. The inset in the upper figure is the partial enlarged view of the curves around the Fermi level, where the Fermi level has been adjusted to the zero point. The images below are the PDOS of Pb/Ge/I atoms at the valence bands and conduction bands, respectively. The dash and dot lines represent the results of Pb and Ge, respectively, I atom is shown with solid lines. 
Based on the orbital contribution and electron–hole pairs generating mechanism of VB and CB as mentioned above, the charge densities of VBM and CBM of the mixed perovskites were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 7, the charge densities in the CBM are mainly distributed around the orbitals of Pb and Ge atoms. For the VBM, the charges spread over the orbitals of I, Ge and Pb atoms, namely, on the inorganic framework, and it is obvious that the charge densities decrease in the equatorial direction with the increased proportion of Ge. However, when x = 1.00, the charges are accumulated in the equatorial direction, opposite to the trend of the four Pb-containing perovskites, which is caused by the special trigonal phase of MAGeI3. The charges distribution manifests that the photo-generated electrons are collected around the CBM and the VBM is the gathering location for the holes. So, once the holes and electrons can be separated effectively and moved to VBM and CBM rapidly without recombination under the action of photo excitation, then the effective electron transport is beneficial for improving their photoelectric conversion properties. The total charge densities listed in the left column of Fig. 7 illustrate that the charges are mainly concentrated at the MA+ cation, which means that the MA+ cation will not donate the electronic states directly to the CBM and the VBM and only affects the inorganic framework mediated by weak interactions.
 Fig. 7  Charge density of the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites; the left panel is the total charge density, the middle panel is the CBM charge density, and the right panel is the VBM charge density. The isovalue for total charge density is 0.186 a.u., 0.002 a.u. for CBM and VBM charge densities. 
For deeper understanding about the internal coupling effects between the MA+ cations and the inorganic M–I–M chains of the perovskites, the electrostatic potential with specific surfaces are drawn in Fig. 8. The couplings between the MA+ cation and I atoms are quite weak since there exists almost no electron orbital overlap between them, which indicates that a strong ionicity exists between the MA+ and I atoms. The strong overlap between the metal and I atoms means that there exists strong covalency in the metal–I chains. Particularly, the electron orbital overlap between H and I atoms further suggests that there are H–I hydrogen bonds between the cation and the inorganic framework. In both CBM and VBM, the contour plots in the apical direction show some degree of decline with an increased proportion of Ge, while both the two band edges in the equatorial direction are presented with the similar consistency. The VBM is mainly dominated by the anti-bonding component between the metal-s and I-p orbitals, while the CBM is composed of the non-bonding states of the p orbital of metal atoms, which is in line with the hole and electron distribution as analyzed from Fig. 7.

Charge transport property is another evaluation criteria for the investigated MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites. Since the hole transport properties originated from the VBM and electron transport properties from the CBM are mainly affected by its orbital mixing, the proportion of the orbital component of each atom as a function of x also has a great effect on the charge transport properties of the mixed perovskites. The effective masses (m*) and reduced mass (μ) in each direction of the Brillouin zone for the three mixed Pb/Ge perovskites are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The variation of the average effective masses of electron and hole as a function of x are drawn in Fig. 9. The pure MAPbI3 is a good electron transporter with the lowest electron effective mass in the studied perovskites, while MAGeI3 shows good transport features in both electron and hole transport aspects. In Fig. 9, when x increases from 0.25 to 0.75, both the electron and hole effective masses act in downward trends. As a whole, the three mixed systems MAGe0.25Pb0.75I3, MAGe0.5Pb0.5I3, and MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 show better electron and hole transport properties because of balanced and relative smaller electron and hole effective masses compared with the pure MAPbI3 and MAGeI3. It is clear that the three mixed systems are more inclined to present better electron transport behavior than their hole transport ability, as the electron effective masses exhibit relative smaller values than those of the hole effective masses. Particularly, MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 shows the best transport properties on average with the balanced and lowest hole and electron effective mass among all the investigated systems. These results indicate that it is beneficial for enhancement of the transportation capability of the perovskites by incorporating Ge atoms with appropriate proportion, and the 75% Ge containing perovskite may be the best choice. As a consequence, our calculations provide a new perspective on the transport properties derived from the nature of the electronic structures of the perovskites compositions.

3.4 Optical properties
To investigate the optical absorption properties of the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites, the corresponding optical absorption spectra were obtained and are displayed in Fig. 10(a). As expected from the band gap results of the mixed perovskites systems, we find a red shift of the absorption gradually expanded in the visible light spectrum region with an increasing proportion of Ge, while the absorptivity of the pure Ge-based perovskite does not show the up-going trend. The three mixed Ge/Pb perovskites show comparable absorption ability compared with the pure Pb-based perovskite. Particularly, when x = 0.75, the system MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 shows the best absorption ability with the strongest peak and broadest peak area among all the systems. In the range of 400–500 nm, the absorption abilities are stronger in the mixed systems compared with the pure Pb and Ge-based perovskites. The absorption coefficient of MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 is almost equal to MAPbI3 and larger than that of the other systems. In order to further explore the solar light harvesting property of the mixed perovskites, the corresponding dielectric function is calculated and displayed in Fig. 10(b). The imaginary part is a critical characteristic for the optical properties.40,41 There are two peaks below 600 nm in the imaginary parts of the investigated systems, and they show a downward trend. In particular, when x = 0.75, MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 shows the largest intensity at 500 nm (the green solid line) with at least two levels higher than the other three Pb containing perovskites, which is in accordance with its biggest absorption coefficient as exhibited in Fig. 10(a). In regard to the real parts, the absorption values in the vicinity of 200 nm are negative, which indicates that strong absorption exists in the ultraviolet region. Besides, a second absorption valley arises in the scope of 300–400 nm, which further illustrates that the mixed perovskites have strong response to the ultraviolet spectrum. In addition, to some extent overlap exists among all the investigated systems in both imaginary and real parts, which means that the mixed perovskites have some similarity in the solar light harvesting property.

To sum up, the three mixed Ge/Pb perovskites show good absorption ability, and MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 is the most outstanding one with its best solar energy harvesting property, which can be chosen as the best candidate to replace the polluted pure Pb perovskite from an optical view.
3.5 Open circuit voltage, short circuit current density and theoretical power conversion efficiency
With the calculated band gaps as mentioned above, we can estimate the open circuit voltages, short circuit current densities, and theoretical power conversion efficiencies of the mixed perovskites by using eqn (1)–(4). In eqn (2), the Eloss is adopted with two values, 0.7 eV and 0.5 eV.47 Moreover, we take the FF with 80% to match the efficiency as reported in ref. 62 with the Eloss of 0.7 eV.47 The obtained results are listed in Table 1. The short circuit current density (Jsc) shows a decrease trend with the increasing proportion of Ge. MAPbI3 has the largest Jsc (41.12 mA cm−2) and is much higher than its experimental reported data 22.4 mA cm−2.62 The difference between the two Jsc values derives from the relevant band gap values, the calculated band gap of MAPbI3 is lower than its experimental data 1.63 eV,62 since the great SOC effect of Pb gives the calculation method a strong signal to pull down its CBM energy. Besides, it is worthwhile noting that all the efficiencies of three mixed perovskites (for x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) on the premise of two different Eloss values are higher than that of MAPbI3 and MAGeI3. And among the three, MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 with the largest efficiency is superior to the other two systems. For x = 0.25 and 0.50, both the systems also possess good efficiencies exceeding 16% higher than those of MAPbI3 and MAGeI3. When the Eloss with 0.5 eV is adopted, all the estimated efficiencies of the five systems have increased about 6% compared with the results of Eloss of 0.7 eV under the same conditions. In this situation, all the Pb-containing systems are shown with an efficiency over 20%. Specifically, the three Pb/Ge mixed systems possess good prospects, for their efficiencies exceed 22%, and even higher than the high record of 20.1%.2 Furthermore, MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 is shown with a high Voc of 0.83 V, and its Jsc 32.39 mA cm−2 is larger than the reported value 28 mA cm−2 for MAPbI3. These results indicate that MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 with the highest efficiency of 24.24% can be chosen as the potential candidate of efficient light absorption layer.

For the three Pb/Ge mixed perovskites, their relative low band gaps, excellent electron and hole transport properties, as well as the strong optical absorption abilities, are more outstanding than those of the traditional MAPbI3 and non-polluted MAGeI3. Their proper structural geometry also plays an important role in their band gaps and the transport properties, which is fundamental to getting a high short circuit current density and open circuit voltage. The perovskites with lower band gaps and wider optical spectra will generate smaller effective masses, which is another factor to improve their short circuit current densities and open circuit voltages. Besides, a reduced Eloss value will also promote increasing the Jsc and Voc. From the above, we can conclude that reducing the loss-in-potential, selecting the absorbers with lower band gap and wider optical absorption spectra are the key factors to obtaining high efficiency.
4. Conclusions
The detailed structural natures, electronic, and optical properties of the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 (x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00) perovskites were investigated with the first principle calculations including GGA-PBE, PBE-SOC, HSE06, and HSE-SOC methods. Our results exhibit a monotonic decrease in band gap and a monotonic increase in optical absorption spectra when the proportion of Pb was gradually lowered, while the pure Ge-based perovskite showed relatively high band energy and weak absorption spectra compared with the other four Pb containing perovskites. In line with previous reports, the pure Ge-based perovskite shows a similar band energy with the pure Pb perovskite, while when gradually decreasing the proportion of Pb by doping with Ge at the same time, the mixed MAGexPb(1−x)I3 perovskites show lower band gaps than the pure Pb and Ge-based perovskites; this is also in accord with the development with low band gap perovskites. Therefore, in terms of band gap, all three mixed Ge/Pb perovskites are good candidates to replace the traditional perovskites. Especially, the lattice distortion of the perovskites acts as an influential factor on the bandwidth of both CBM and VBM for the reduction of the band gap. Furthermore, the SOC strength also has a great impact on determining the electronic structures and regulating the band gaps of the mixed perovskites. The molecular orbital analysis indicates that the factor governing the band gap is the orbital contribution between I and metal atoms. When increasing the proportion of Ge, a red shift absorption and increased optical absorption is found for the mixed perovskites, and MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 shows the best absorption with the strongest peak and largest peak area among the mixed systems. The effective mass analysis indicates that the three mixed systems possess more excellent hole and electron transport properties than both the pure Pb and Ge perovskites. And the three mixed systems are more inclined to show their better electron transport behavior more than the hole transport ability. Besides, the three systems also present good performances with larger open circuit voltages, short circuit current densities, and theoretical power conversion efficiencies than MAPbI3 and MAGeI3. MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 with the highest theoretical efficiency of 24.24% can become the best candidate due to the lowest effective masses, strongest optical absorption, and proper band gap among the five perovskites.
The search for new totally Pb free materials is still the major topic in perovskites solar cell development and our results reveal that MAGe0.75Pb0.25I3 can be chosen as a suitable replacement to alleviate the Pb content to decrease its harmful pollution. And we expect that our investigations will inspire experimental synthesis to have a deep insight for a new kind of lead-free perovskites.
