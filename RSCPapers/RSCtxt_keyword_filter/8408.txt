    , Accepted 17th August 2012First published on 21st August 2012AbstractExploration of new catalytic semiconductors with novel structures as counter electrode materials is a promising approach to improve performances of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In this work, nearly mono-disperse tetragonal Cu2SnS3 (CTS) and rhombohedral Cu1.8S hierarchical microspheres with nanometer-to-micrometer dimensions have been synthesized respectively via a simple solvothermal approach. These microspheres are also demonstrated as efficient counter electrode materials in solar cells using ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables as photoanode and polysulfide (Sn2−/S2−) solution as electrolyte. While copper sulfide is regarded as one of the most effective counter electrode materials in QDSSCs, we demonstrate the CTS microspheres to show higher electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte than the Cu1.8S microspheres. This contributes to obvious enhancement of photocurrent density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). Power conversion efficiency (PCE) is significantly enhanced from 0.25% for the cell using a pure FTO (SnO2:F) glass as counter electrode, to 3.65 and 4.06% for the cells using counter electrodes of FTO glasses coated respectively with Cu1.8S and CTS microspheres.
Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) represent a class of photovoltaic devices of wide marketing potential due to their low cost, easy fabrication and high theoretical power conversion efficiency.1–5 A typical QDSSC consists of three components: a photoanode sensitized with semiconductor quantum dots, an electrolyte with a redox couple, and a counter electrode. Photovoltaic performances are governed not only by configuration of the photoanode but also by electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode.6–8 Counter electrodes in QDSSCs play an important role in catalyzing reduction of the redox electrolyte by transferring electrons from the external circuit to the electrolyte.1,9 To facilitate these, an ideal counter electrode material should have good conductivity, large surface area, and high catalytic activity. Therefore, exploration of new counter electrode materials with novel nanostructures for pursuing high electrocatalytic activity is a promising approach to enhance the photovoltaic performances of QDSSCs.
Some recent efforts have been devoted to studying counter electrodes in QDSSCs. Several kinds of counter electrode materials have been reported, including noble metals (Pt, Au),10,11 carbon based materials,12,13 and binary metal sulfide compounds (copper sulfide and copper cobalt).6,9,14,15 Binary copper sulfides have been demonstrated as one of the most effective counter electrode materials with high electrocatalytic activities to polysulfide electrolyte in QDSSCs.16,17 It is thus desirable to explore possible approaches for further improving the performance of the counter electrode. Incorporation of intended elements into copper sulfides is a promising approach to improve their electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity. Cu2SnS3 (CTS) is known to be a p-type semiconductor composed of low-cost, earth-abundant, and low-toxicity elements, and exhibits excellent electrical conductivity.18–20 In fact, copper-based ternary and quaternary materials such as Cu–In–Ga–S and Cu–Zn–Sn–S have been shown to be excellent photoanode materials.21–24 However, so far there are no reports on QDSSCs using copper-based multinary semiconductors as counter electrode materials. On the other hand, hierarchical organizations with large specific area and surface roughness, which have been widely applied in chemical sensing, catalysis, and lithium ion batteries,25–30 are a promising structure for counter electrodes in QDSSCs. Herein, we report a simple solvothermal method for synthesizing near mono-disperse microspheres composed of CTS nanoflakes and Cu1.8S nanoplates. These hierarchical microspheres are demonstrated to have good performance as counter electrodes in QDSSCs with ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocable photoanodes. In particular, the CTS microspheres were observed to show higher catalytic activity than the Cu1.8S microspheres. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the QDSSC is enhanced from 3.65 to 4.06% by replacing the Cu1.8S with the CTS counter electrode.
Experimental
Synthesis of Cu2SnS3 hierarchical microspheres
In a typical synthesis, 0.5 mmol of Cu(NO3)2 and 0.25 mmol of SnCl4 were dissolved in 40 mL of triethylene glycol (TEG), followed by the addition of 0.8 mmol of S powder and ultrasonication for 30 min. The mixed solution was then kept at 250 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the reaction product was collected and washed with absolute ethanol several times, and then dried under vacuum.
Synthesis of Cu1.8S hierarchical microspheres
0.8 mmol of Cu(NO3)2 and 1.25 mmol of S powder were added in 40 mL of TEG and ultrasonicated for 30 min. The mixed solution was then kept at 250 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the reaction product was collected and washed with absolute ethanol several times, and then dried under vacuum.
Synthesis of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocable arrays
In a typical procedure, an array of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables was prepared by surface selenization of the ZnO nanowires grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate in a Se2− ion solution (6 mM) at 55 °C for 3 h to form ZnO/ZnSe nanocables, then followed by reacting with a Cd(NO3)2 aqueous solution (50 mM) at 55 °C for 10 h to form ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables.8 The sample was washed with deionized water several times and then dried in a flow of nitrogen.
Fabrication of solar cells
The as-prepared CTS and Cu1.8S microspheres were dispersed in ethanol and deposited onto FTO glass substrates by spin-coating. The CTS coated FTO glass substrates (CTS/FTO) and Cu1.8S coated FTO glass substrates (Cu1.8S/FTO) were annealed respectively in nitrogen at 400 °C for 30 min, and then used as counter electrodes. Solar cells were prepared by assembling and bonding the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocable photoanodes with the CTS/FTO or the Cu1.8S/FTO or the FTO counter electrodes. The anode and counter electrode in the solar cells were separated by 60 μm thick polypropylene spacers, and the internal spaces of the cells were filled with a polysulfide electrolyte (1.0 M S, 1.0 M Na2S and 0.1 M NaOH in deionized water). The active area of each solar cell is 0.20 cm2. During the course of the experiments, it was found that the performance of the solar cells is highly sensitive to the morphologies and density of the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables. While we found that it is not easy to obtain several anode samples with the same performance, it was observed that the same anode sample can be reused more than ten times (i.e. cell assemble/measurement/cell disassemble) without observable performance degradation. Hence, we used the single anode sample to make the different cells to achieve a fair comparison of the various counter electrodes.
Characterization
As-prepared samples were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Siemens D-500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out respectively with a Philips XL30 FEG SEM and a Philips CM 20 TEM. Optical absorption data were recorded with an Agilent-8453 spectrophotometer. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated with a standard silicon diode with a KG-5 filter to minimize error due to spectral mismatch. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in the dark using an impedance measurement unit (ZAHNER-elektrik IM6) in the frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV.
Results and discussion
Hierarchical Cu2SnS3 microspheres were prepared by solvothermal reaction of Cu(NO3)2, SnCl4, and S in a TEG solvent. The phase composition of the sample was determined by XRD analysis. Fig. 1a shows an XRD pattern of the as-prepared sample. All the diffraction peaks match well to those of the tetragonal Cu2SnS3 (JCPDF no. 01-089-4714). There are no detectable impurities such as binary CuS or SnS2. SEM images in Fig. 1b and 1c show the general morphologies of nearly mono-disperse hierarchical microspheres with diameters of ∼2 μm. The hierarchical microspheres are built from many nanoflakes with thicknesses of about 20–25 nm as shown in Fig. 1d.

This hierarchical organization and its crystal structure were further demonstrated by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The TEM image in Fig. 2a shows a Cu2SnS3 nanoflake of the microspheres. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 2b can be indexed to tetragonal Cu2SnS3 along the [221] direction. Forbidden reflections of  and  are observed and considered to be the result of a stacking fault.31Fig. 2c shows an HRTEM image of a Cu2SnS3 nanoflake. The fringe spacings of 0.27 and 0.31 nm can be respectively indexed to the interplanar spacings of the {004} and {112} planes of the tetragonal Cu2SnS3 structure. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the lattices is shown in Fig. 2d, revealing a zone axis of [10].

The CTS microspheres were further characterized with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Fig. 3b–3d are, respectively, Cu, Sn and S EDS elemental mappings of the microspheres in Fig. 3a. The results reveal that Cu, Sn and S are homogeneously distributed throughout the spheres. The EDS spectrum in the inset of Fig. 3 reveals that the atomic ratio of Cu:Sn:S in our sample is about 35:16:49, indicating Cu-rich CTS microspheres.

Inset is an EDS spectrum of the Cu2SnS3 hierarchical microspheres. 
The evolution process of the CTS microspheres has been carefully investigated. Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns of the products obtained at different stages of the reaction process. Curve (i) shows an XRD pattern of the product obtained after the solvothermal reaction for 15 min. All diffraction peaks match well with those of the hexagonal CuS (JCPDF no. 79-2321). Diffraction peaks from SnS2 were not detected, indicating the formation of only CuS at the initial stage. When the reaction time is prolonged, the (102) and (110) diffraction peaks of CuS in curve (i) gradually shift to lower 2θ, and evolve respectively into the (112) and (204) peaks of tetragonal Cu2SnS3 with the incorporation of Sn as shown in curves (ii)–(vii). Eventually, the pure phase of tetragonal Cu2SnS3 is obtained as shown in curves (vi) and (vii), when the reaction time is increased up to 48 h. The above results may also demonstrate that the reaction between S and Cu2+ to form binary CuS is much easier to occur than the reaction between S and Sn4+ to give binary SnS2. The XRD data suggest that the as-formed CuS further reacts with Sn4+ and transforms into Cu2SnS3. In the reaction, TEG serves as both a solvent and a reducing agent for the reduction of Cu2+ and S in the solvothermal synthesis.

Fig. 5 shows UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples obtained at different reaction stages. Spectrum (i) shows that the CuS (15 min) sample prepared with a solvothermal reaction duration of 15 min has a broad absorption in visible region with an absorption edge at ∼670 nm, which is similar to previously reported CuS nanoparticles.32 A strong absorption in the NIR region due to free-carrier intraband absorbance is also observed, which is considered a characteristic feature of cupric sulfide (CuS).32,33 With increasing incorporation of Sn, absorption edges of the samples show a continuous red shift to longer wavelengths. The band gaps of the CuS (15 min) and the Cu2SnS3 (48 h) samples are estimated to be 1.87 and 1.15 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5b.

Without the addition of SnCl4, Cu1.8S hierarchical microspheres can be prepared by the reaction of Cu(NO3)2 and S powder in a TEG solution. Fig. 6a shows an XRD pattern of the sample prepared by reacting Cu(NO3)2 with S powder in a TEG solution at 250 °C for 48 h. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to those of rhombohedral Cu1.8S (JCPDF no. 47-1748), which is consistent with the EDS results (inset of Fig. 6b) that show the sample consists only of copper and sulfur with an atomic ratio of 0.64:0.36. Fig. 6b and 6c show SEM images of the Cu1.8S hierarchical structures, indicating a nearly mono-disperse size with an average diameter of ∼500 nm. These microspheres are composed of several stacked nanoplates. The thickness of each nanoplate is estimated to be 30–35 nm from the TEM image in Fig. 6d. The inset SAED pattern of the Cu1.8S nanoplates can be indexed to the [20,,1] zone axis of rhombohedral Cu1.8S, indicating that the Cu1.8S nanoplates are single-crystalline. An HRTEM image of a Cu1.8S nanoplate in Fig. 6e shows lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.32 nm in two directions, which match well with the interplanar spacings of the (0,1,5) and (0,0,15) planes, respectively. The inset is the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the lattices revealing a zone axis of [100]. Fig. 6f shows a UV-Vis spectrum of the Cu1.8S hierarchical microspheres, indicating a broad absorption in the visible region with an absorption edge of ∼935 nm. No obvious NIR absorption is observed for these Cu1.8S microspheres, which is quite different from the absorption of CuS (15 min) microspheres as shown in Fig. 5. The band gap of these Cu1.8S hierarchical microspheres is estimated to be about 1.33 eV, which is much smaller than that of the CuS microspheres.

To study their electrocatalytic activities for the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte and their contribution to photovoltaic performance of the photoelectrochemical solar cells, Cu1.8S and CTS microspheres were deposited respectively on FTO glass substrates and used as the counter electrodes in solar cells with ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables as the photoanode and polysulfide as the electrolyte. The photovoltaic performance of a solar cell is critically determined by the length, diameter, and density of the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables. Therefore, to minimize the performance variation from the photoanodes of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables, the same photoanode sample was used to estimate the photovoltaic performance of solar cells with different counter electrodes. Fig. 7 shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells constructed from the same photoanode sample with different counter electrodes. Key performance parameters of these cells are summarized in Table 1. Based on an array of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables with lengths of ∼7 μm and diameters of 150–200 nm (Fig. S1 of the ESI†), the solar cell using a pure FTO glass as the counter electrode (curve a) gives a JSC of 2.83 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.732 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.121, yielding a PCE of 0.25%. The photovoltaic performance of the solar devices is significantly improved by using the Cu1.8S or CTS microsphere-coated FTO glass substrates as counter electrodes. With the Cu1.8S/FTO counter electrode (curve b), the VOC, JSC, and FF are increased to 0.822 V, 10.51 mA cm−2, and 0.423, respectively, resulting in a PCE of 3.65%. When a CTS/FTO counter electrode is used, the cell presents a JSC of 11.46 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.810 V, a FF of 0.437, and a PCE of 4.06%. After coating Cu1.8S or CTS microspheres on FTO glass substrates, the PCE shows an enhancement of 1300 and 1524%, respectively.

In our previous work, a solar cell using a photoanode of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocables with lengths of ∼8 μm and diameters of 100–120 nm and a Cu2S/brass counter electrode achieved a conversion efficiency of 4.54%.8 The performance difference is attributed to the different morphologies and density of the nanocables in the photoanode which have significant influences on the cell performance. Furthermore, the counter electrodes in the present work were prepared on FTO glass substrates instead of metallic substrates with better conductivity.8
These three cells using the same photoanode and polysulfide electrolyte only differ in counter electrodes. In our case, photovoltaic measurements were repeated with more than 5 photoanode samples tested with various counter electrodes. When the pure FTO counter electrodes are replaced with the CTS/FTO or the Cu1.8S/FTO counter electrodes, all of the cells show enhanced photovoltaic performances, indicating smaller interfacial recombination between the CTS/FTO (or the Cu1.8S/FTO) counter electrodes and the polysulfide electrolyte. The reduced interfacial recombination is attributed to the smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) of CTS (or Cu1.8S) microspheres, which facilitates electron transfer from the counter electrode to the electrolyte for the reduction of Sn2− to S2−. This may suggest CTS (or Cu1.8S) microspheres showing high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of Sn2− to S2− in the cells. Rct is typically regarded as an indicator to reveal the catalytic activity of counter electrode materials.16,34 To further examine the Rct with different counter electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize the cells. Fig. 8 shows Nyquist plots of FTO–FTO, Cu1.8S/FTO–Cu1.8S/FTO, and CTS/FTO–CTS/FTO symmetric cells containing polysulfide redox electrolyte. Rct can be estimated from the real impedance component (Z′) of the high frequency semicircles.9,35–37 The Rct value decreases from 2.4 × 104 Ω cm2 for the FTO counter electrode to 11.4 Ω cm2 for the Cu1.8S/FTO counter electrode, and further to 6.2 Ω cm2 for the CTS/FTO counter electrode. Nyquist plots of the real solar cells constructed from the same photoanode with various counter electrodes have also been investigated and are presented in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† The CTS/FTO-based solar cell also shows a smaller Rct than the Cu1.8S/FTO-based solar cell, which is consistent with the EIS result from the symmetric dummy cells. Both sets of results can well explain the improved photovoltaic performance of the cells using CTS (or Cu1.8S) microspheres coated FTO glass substrates as counter electrodes, and also indicate that CTS microspheres show a higher electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte than Cu1.8S microspheres.

J
SC and FF of the solar cells are known to depend on the series resistance (RS) of the devices. The RS of solar cells can be approximately estimated as the inverse of the slopes of the J–V curves at VOC.38 A smaller RS typically contributes to a higher JSC and a larger FF. The RS in photoelectrochemical solar cells can be expressed as RS = RTCO + Rct + Rdiff, where RTCO is the substrate resistance and Rdiff is the diffusion impedance in the electrolyte.9,34 In our case, only the counter electrodes are different among these three solar cells, therefore, the smallest Rct of CTS/FTO-based cell should account for its smallest RS and thus the higher JSC and the larger FF. The VOC value of a solar cell depends on its shunt resistance (RP). A larger RP contributes to a larger VOC. The RP of solar cells can be approximately estimated as the inverse of the slopes of the J–V curves at JSC.38J–V curves of CTS/FTO- and Cu1.8S/FTO-based solar cells show nearly the same slope at the JSC point, indicating a similar value of VOC. It also explains the pure FTO-based solar cell showing a much smaller VOC.
Conclusions
In summary, near mono-disperse tetragonal CTS hierarchical microspheres with diameters of ∼2 μm have been synthesized using a simple solvothermal method. These microspheres are composed of CTS nanoflakes with a thickness of 20–25 nm. Tunable optical absorption in the Vis-NIR region is achieved for the evolution of CuS into CTS microspheres with a band gap variation in the range of 1.87–1.15 eV. Rhombohedral Cu1.8S hierarchical microspheres with an average diameter of ∼500 nm have also been prepared in the same system without addition of the SnCl4 reagent. Both CTS and Cu1.8S hierarchical microspheres are demonstrated as effective counter electrode materials in QDSSCs. The CTS microspheres show a higher electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte than the Cu1.8S microspheres. The solar cell with a CTS/FTO counter electrode achieves a PCE of 4.06% with a JSC of 11.46 mA cm−2, which are much better than the performances of the Cu1.8S/FTO-based cell with a PCE of 3.65% and a JSC of 10.51 mA cm−2. This work suggests that copper sulfide-based multinary semiconductor nanostructures show good potential to serve as effective counter electrode materials in photoelectrochemical solar cells.
