The electrochemical performance analysis indicates that the Bi2S3–C electrode has lower charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode interface, smaller Nernst diffusion impedance of iodide in electrolyte and higher catalytic ability than the bare Bi2S3 electrode. After optimization of the content of carbon, the DSSC with the Bi2S3–C counter electrode exhibited an excellent power conversion efficiency of 6.72%, which is comparable to that of the Pt-based DSSC (6.74%).
Introduction
In the past decade, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their easy fabrication, low-cost and environmental friendliness.1,2 Generally, a typical DSSC is composed of a dye sensitized photoanode,3–6 a liquid electrolyte with the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple and a catalytic counter electrode (CE). As an indispensable component of DSSCs, CEs collect electrons from external circuit and promote the reduction of triiodide. The conventional CEs are magnetron sputtering deposited or thermally decomposed Pt on rigid fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, which have shown remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the regeneration of iodide from triiodide. However, the high price of metal Pt restrains the large-scale manufacturing of DSSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore low cost and effective non-Pt CEs. Fortunately, many economic materials have shown excellent catalytic performance as Pt CEs, such as carbonaceous materials,7–9 conducting polymers10–12 and metal nitrides, oxides and sulfides.13–21 Among them, metal sulfides gained more attention due to their facile preparation conditions and relatively low toxicity.
As a well-known layered semiconductor, bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) has many widely applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices,22 hydrogen storage materials23,24 and lithium ion batteries.25,26 Particularly, Bi2S3 is considered as a potential material for photoelectrochemical solar cells by virtue of its small band gap, high absorption coefficient and reasonable energy conversion efficiency.27 However, to our knowledge, few researches have reported on the application of Bi2S3 as CEs in DSSCs except for the works by Liu's group28,29 and Li's group.30 In 2012, Liu et al. compared the catalytic activities of different facets within Bi2S3 through density functional theory computations. Then, they successfully synthesized flower-like Bi2S3 nanostructures with predominantly exposed (130) and (211) facets and obtained photovoltaic efficiencies of 3.5% and 1.9% within these differently faceted Bi2S3 based DSSCs, respectively. Subsequently Li et al. prepared Bi2S3 microspheres grown on the graphene by two-step solvothermal method and used as CE for the DSSC system. The power conversion efficiency of Bi2S3/graphene hybrid material boosted to 5.5%. This remarkable improvement of the conversion efficiency is mainly due to the efficient electron transport network provided by graphene. In fact, many efforts have recently been devoted to investigate the synergistic effect in the combination of nanomaterials and carbon materials. For example, Ma's group reported two composites of MoC and WC embedded in ordered carbon materials and employed them as the CE materials for DSSCs. The results indicated that both of them have superior catalytic performance to the expensive Pt CE.31 Li et al. also presented an improved photovoltaic efficiency of DSSC with TiN nanoparticles and carbon black composite as CE.32 And then, Yue et al. utilized high porous MoS2–C hybrid film as the pt-free CE materials for DSSC and achieved a high photovoltaic efficiency of 7.69%.18 Besides, Wang et al. synthesized a carbon-coated WS2 material using a simple method. The DSSC assembled with this carbide-based CE also showed fantastic photovoltaic performance.33
Herein, a composite material of Bi2S3 and conductive carbon was prepared by a one-step solvothermal route, and investigated as CEs for Pt-free DSSCs. As far as we know, this is the first report on the utilization of Bi2S3–C composite material as CEs for DSSCs. Based on the beneficial synergetic effect of Bi2S3 and carbon, the DSSC assembled with this composite material CE exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and achieves a high photovoltaic conventional efficiency of 6.72%. Compared with Li et al. study, our present work has several advantages, namely (1) replace graphene with carbon to improve the conductivity in preparation process, which means the complex preparation process of graphene is avoidable; (2) use a facile one-step solvothermal approach instead of two-step solvothermal approach; and (3) derive more excellent catalytic material than Bi2S3/graphene composite.
Experimental
Synthesis of Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C composite materials
The Bi2S3–C composite materials were prepared by using analytical-grade bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S), without further purification. The typical synthesis procedure as follows: 2 mM Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 6 mM L-cysteine were dissolved in 30 mL anhydrous ethanol and continuously stirred for 2 h to form a homogeneous solution. Afterward, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg glucose powder were added into the solution, followed by further stirred for another 30 min. The solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, maintained at 150 °C for 24 h, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The black precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed several times using deionized water and anhydrous ethanol to remove the possible remaining cations and anions, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 8 h for further characterization purposes. The final samples were denoted to Bi2S3-0.39–C, Bi2S3-0.77–C, Bi2S3-1.53–C and Bi2S3-2.28–C, respectively. The values 0.39, 0.77, 1.53, and 2.28 represent the contents of carbon are 0.39 wt%, 0.77 wt%, 1.53 wt%, and 2.28 wt% in the composite materials, respectively.
Pure Bi2S3 were synthesized according to the same method of preparing Bi2S3–C composites, but only replaced glucose with 0.3 g surfactant PVP 40000.
Fabrication of counter electrodes
To prepare CEs, 0.1 g Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C powders were respectively mixed with 0.025 g polyethylene glycol, and then dispersed into 4 mL anhydrous ethanol followed by stirring to form a fluid mixture. Afterward, a film was made using the doctor-blade technique on FTO conductive glass. The films were annealed at 430 °C for 1 h at the protection of argon atmosphere, and then the CEs were obtained. As a comparison, Pt CEs were purchased from Wuhan Georgi science instrument Co. Ltd (Wuhan, Hubei, China).
Assembly of DSSCs
Firstly, the TiO2 photoanodes were soaked overnight in the N-719 dye solution (0.3 mM in the solvent of ethanol). TiO2 photoanodes were obtained from Dalian HeptaChroma Solar Technology Development Co. Ltd (Dalian, Liaoning, China). Then, the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried in the hot air. Finally, the TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated with the prepared CEs with the injection of redox shuttle electrolyte (0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1-propy1-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine with acetonitrile as the solvent). The effective areas of all cells are 0.5 × 0.5 cm2.
Characterizations and measurements
The compositions of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) under a Rigaku D/Max-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm). The Raman spectra were recorded with a laser confocal micro Raman spectrometer (Invia-Reflex, Renishaw, UK) at 532 nm with a 100× objective. The sizes and morphologies of Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured on a Tristar II 3020 automated surface area and pore analyzer. The catalytic activity of the various CEs were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests, which were implemented on an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany) equipped with a three-electrode system in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution consisting of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV S−1. The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements were executed on symmetric cells containing two identical electrodes, using an impedance measurement unit of workstation in the frequency range 0.1–106 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2410 digital source meter under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulate solar light (100 mW cm−2), which was calibrated by a Si reference cell beforehand. All the measurements were performed at ambient temperature.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the as-synthesized materials
Fig. 1 shows the XRD diffraction patterns of Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C nanomaterials synthesized by facile solvothermal process. All of the diffraction peaks in both patterns can be readily assigned to the orthorhombic phase Bi2S3 (PDF# 17-0320). The derived lattice constants are a = 1.1149 nm, b = 1.1126 nm, and c = 0.3985 nm, which are in good coincidence with the reported values for Bi2S3 (a = 1.1149 nm, b = 1.1304 nm, and c = 0.3981 nm).24,25 Comparing the XRD patterns of Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C materials in detail, we found non-existence of the carbon-related characterized peaks in Bi2S3–C XRD pattern, denoting the amorphous carbon derived from glucose.34

To further confirm the microstructure of carbon, Raman spectroscopy was executed on the pristine Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C composite materials. As shown in Fig. 2, both of the samples present scattering bands at 138, 259, 348, 510, 651 and 956 cm−1. Except for the peak at 138 cm−1, all other peaks are well consistent with the reported results of Bi2S3 nanocrystals.25,35–37 Typically, the presence of the peak at 138 cm−1 stems from the contribution of surface optical phonon modes.38 From the partial enlarged drawing of Bi2S3–C Raman spectra (inset of Fig. 2), it can be found that two weak peaks appeared at 1355 and 1574 cm−1. These two new peaks are corresponding to so-called D and G bands of carbon, respectively.26,39 Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) shown in Fig. S1† confirms the presence of C, S and Bi elements in Bi2S3–C microspheres.

The morphologies of the solvothermal synthesized Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C samples were investigated by SEM, as shown in Fig. 3 and S2.† The bare Bi2S3 (Fig. 3a) is composed of tremendous nanoparticles. In comparison, the facile synthesized Bi2S3–C composite product, as shown in Fig. 3b and c, exhibits the form of homogeneous porous microspheres with diameters of 2–3 μm. Furthermore, owing to the distribution of innumerable nanoparticles within the Bi2S3–C microspheres (Fig. 3d), this composite structure possesses a very large specific surface area.

In order to determine the microstructure of Bi2S3–C composite, TEM measurement was performed as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4a shows that the diameter of Bi2S3–C microspheres is about 2.5 μm. From Fig. 4b, it can be clearly seen that the synthesized Bi2S3–C microsphere possesses a highly porous structure. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 4c and d) images reveal that the Bi2S3–C composite has good crystallinity and the lattice spacing of about 0.309 nm, which corresponds to the (211) facet. Besides, on the Bi2S3 particle surface there is an inhomogeneous coating layer, which is probably amorphous carbon derived from degradation of glucose.26,40

The porous character of the Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C was analyzed by N2 absorption and desorption measurements. As shown in Fig. 5, both of them exhibit a typical absorption–desorption isotherm of type IV. The Bi2S3–C composite possesses an ultrahigh BET surface area of 76.88 m2 g−1, which is close to that of Bi2S3 (77.31 m2 g−1). In addition, from the pore size distribution curves (inset of Fig. 5), they both have broad pore size distribution, from several nanometres to about 100 nm. The average pore diameter of the Bi2S3 is 14.6 nm with a pore volume of 0.282 cm3 g−1, while the average pore diameter of the Bi2S3–C microspheres increases to 14.9 nm with a pore volume of 0.286 cm3 g−1. The high surface area and rich mesopores structure of Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C indicate that they are desirable for electrode materials because they can provide efficient electronic transportation channels during the oxidation–reduction process.

The corresponding photovoltaic parameters, such as the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), are summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, the DSSC with the bare Bi2S3 CE exhibits an inferior photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 5.56% due to its poor electrocatalytic activity. However, after the optimization, the DSSC fabricated with Bi2S3–C microspheres CE presents a Voc of 0.750 V, Jsc of 14.45 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.62, resulting in a promising conversion efficiency of 6.72%, which is very close to that of DSSC with traditional Pt CE (6.75%). Considering the detailed parameter of FF, we found that the addition of glucose in the preparation process of CEs leads to large differences in FF of DSSCs. As CEs for the DSSC, the Bi2S3–C exhibits much higher FF than the pure Bi2S3, which indicates the superiority of the former. The enhanced FF value may result from the positive synergistic effect between the Bi2S3 and amorphous carbon in the Bi2S3–C CEs. Therefore, the cooperation of Bi2S3 and amorphous carbon can effectively improve the catalytic performance of Bi2S3.
Electrochemical properties of CEs
In the following, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements, and Tafel polarization curves were used to investigate the electrocatalytic activities of various CEs.
Firstly, CV tests were carried out in a three-electrode system with the Pt sheet as CE, various CEs as working electrode and saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode. Fig. 7 and S4† show the CVs of various CEs in redox couple I−/I3− system. Two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks are observed for all CEs. The left pair in low potential range is assigned to the redox reaction eqn (3) and the right pair in the high potential range is corresponded to the redox reaction eqn (4): 
I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−
(3) 
3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−

 Fig. 7  CV curves for Bi2S3, Bi2S3–C and Pt electrodes. 
As can be seen in Fig. 7, the Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C electrodes exhibit obvious cathodic peaks similar to that of the efficient Pt electrode, suggesting that the Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–C electrodes have similar catalytic ability to the Pt electrode. In addition, the reduction current peaks of Bi2S3–C electrode are higher than that of pure Bi2S3 electrode, which match well with the results of J–V curves and further confirm the higher catalytic activity of the former.
To further investigate the catalytic activities for regeneration of the redox couple I−/I3− on the aforementioned CEs, EIS measurements were conducted in symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical CEs (CE/electrolyte/CE). As shown in Fig. 8 and S5,† two typical semicircles are observed in the higher and lower frequency regions. The high-frequency intercept on the Z′ axis is generally assigned to the Ohmic series resistance (Rs). The left semicircle is attributed to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the constant phase element (CPE) at the CE/electrolyte interface, while the right semicircle is consistent with the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZW) in the electrolyte.41 The corresponding EIS parameters are listed in Table 1. The Bi2S3 electrode possesses a large Rct of 8.78 Ω cm−2. But after the addition of the carbon, the Bi2S3–C composite CEs demonstrate the lower Rct. It's interesting that the Rct of the Bi2S3–C CEs decreases gradually with increasing the dosage of carbon from 0.39 wt% to 1.53 wt%, and then increases with further increasing the carbon content. The change tendency of Rct in the Bi2S3–C electrodes with different carbon contents is in agreement with that of other carbon-based materials, such as MoS2/C,18 MoS2/G,42 CoS2/G43 and WS2/MWCNT.44 This phenomenon maybe due to the excessive amounts of carbon reduces the catalytic activity of the Bi2S3–C. Ultimately, the sample of Bi2S3-1.53–C exhibits the smallest Rct (2.26 Ω cm−2) among all composite electrodes. This indicates that less resistance is required for the transfer of electrons from the surface of Bi2S3-1.53–C electrode to the electrolyte. In addition, the Bi2S3–C electrodes has smaller ZW than that of the pristine Bi2S3 electrode, which indicates that the Bi2S3–C composite can provide more efficient electrolyte diffusion channel for I−. Therefore, Bi2S3–C composite materials exhibit much higher catalytic activity than pure Bi2S3 material used as the CE for the DSSC, which is in agreement with the results from above J–V and CV experiments.

Finally, Tafel polarization analysis was executed using symmetric cells similar to the one used in above EIS experiments. Fig. 9 shows the Tafel polarization curves for the Bi2S3, Bi2S3–C and Pt electrodes. In general, exchange current density (J0) and limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) are closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalysts.45 In Fig. 9, the Bi2S3–C composite electrode shows a larger slope in the anodic and cathodic branches than the Bi2S3 electrode, suggesting a higher J0 in the Bi2S3–C electrode surface. Obviously, the slope of Pt electrode is the highest one, implying that the highest J0 and best catalytic activity of Pt electrode among these CEs. Furthermore, J0 can also be estimated by eqn (5): 
J0 = RT/(nFRct)
(5)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday's constant and n represents the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− at the electrode. The tendency of J0 for three CEs calculated according to above equation coincide well with that obtained from the Tafel polarization curves. In addition, the Tafel curves also include the information of Jlim, which can be expressed by eqn (6): 
Jlim = 2nFCD/l
(6)where C is the I−/I3− concentration, D is the diffusion coefficient of the I3− in electrolyte and l is the spacer thickness. From eqn (6), a higher Jlim indicates a lager diffusion coefficient D of the I3− in electrolyte at same potential. Meanwhile, a CE with a faster diffusion rate of the I3− represents its smaller Nernst diffusion impedance ZW in the electrolyte. Apparently, the order of Jlim is Pt > Bi2S3–C > Bi2S3 in Fig. 9, which is completely consistent with the order of ZW in EIS spectra. This result suggests that Bi2S3–C nanocomposites possess a higher catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− than Bi2S3.
 Fig. 9  Tafel curves of the symmetric cells based on various electrodes. 
Fig. 10 shows the possible synergistic effect on the improved electrocatalytic ability of the Bi2S3–C composite. The grain boundary in the CEs assembled by Bi2S3 nanoparticles may cause the poorly efficient migration of electrons, due to the electron scattering in this crystal boundary.46 In the Bi2S3–C composites, this electron scattering may be overcome by the conductive carbon that covers the Bi2S3 particles. In addition, when the electrons flow into the CEs, they are easily shuttled to the intrinsically electrocatalytic Bi2S3 by taking advantage of the fast electron transport network of carbon. As a result, the excellent conductivity of the amorphous carbon and the superior electrocatalytic activity of the Bi2S3 can provide low Rct at the interface between the CE and electrolyte for the I−/I3− redox reaction. Notably, the excessive amounts of carbon could reduce the catalytic activity of the Bi2S3–C. With the excessive increase of the carbon contents, the amorphous carbon heavily surrounds Bi2S3 nanoparticles in a microsphere of Bi2S3–C composite, leading to the isolation of Bi2S3 from redox couple I−/I3− system, reducing the catalytic activity of the Bi2S3 and Rct enhanced. The two effects compete with other. Consequently, the Bi2S3-1.53–C CE has the fastest electron-transfer kinetics than other CEs due to the synergistic effect from the conductive network of carbon and the intrinsically catalytic Bi2S3, and the DSSCs with it obtain the highest conversion efficiency.

Conclusion
In this study, a nanocomposites of Bi2S3–C was successfully prepared by a facial one-step solvothermal method. The compositions and morphologies of Bi2S3–C composite material were observed by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and EDS. In addition, J–V curves, CV, EIS and Tafel polarization experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the composite electrode, which is mainly due to the positive synergistic effect in the combined Bi2S3–C composite, including improved electrical conductivity and enhanced electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. As a result, the DSSCs fabricated with the Bi2S3–C CE obtained a high conversion efficiency of 6.72% by the optimization of the carbon content in composite materials, which increased by more than 20% compared with that of bare Bi2S3 CE, suggesting Bi2S3–C composite materials is a potential alternative to expensive Pt for the low-cost DSSCs.
