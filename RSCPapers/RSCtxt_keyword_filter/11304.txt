A highly reproducible record efficiency of 6.28% for the assembled CdSe-sensitized solar cells has been achieved, and the irradiation, as well as conservation stability, have also been greatly improved compared to the brass foil based solar cells. With different size and morphology, the phase of CuS shows a slightly superior performance than Cu1.8S through investigating the influence of S/Cu ratio on the efficiency. The sintering temperature of the counter electrode film has also been studied, and the results show that 400 °C is favorable for good conductivity, high electrochemical activity, low charge transfer resistance in a solid–solid interface and between the catalysts and electrolyte. Because of the low cost, convenient fabrication, easy of sealing, as well as the high efficiency, reproducibility and excellent stability of the devices, the as-prepared copper sulfide could be potentially and extensively utilized in semiconductor-sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
As one of the most potentially cost-effective candidates for third-generation photovoltaic cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted much attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability.1–8 In recent years, the PCE has been continuously renewed by exploiting various QD-assembled photoanodes,9–15 electrolytes16–19 and counter electrodes (CEs).20,21 A new record of up to 7% has been achieved.22 It is well known that as an important part of solar cells, CEs need to meet the two basic requirements of high catalytic activity and stability. Differently from dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), nonplatinum-based materials including oxides and sulfides have been generally utilized as CEs in QDSCs to avoid poisoning and improve catalytic activity. Among the reported sulfides such as CuxS,23–30 NiS,31 CoS,32,33 PbS,34,35 FeS2,36,37 Bi2S3,38 and metal chalcogenide–carbon composite materials,39–42 copper sulfide based CEs exhibit the highest electrocatalytic activity toward reduction of a polysulfide electrolyte.
Various methods have been employed to synthesize copper sulfide based CEs, such as exposing the brass foil to a polysulfide electrolyte solution to get an interfacial layer of Cu2S on the brass substrate (denoted as CuxS/brass CE),43–45 screen-printing the pre-prepared Cu2S or CuS nanomaterials on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass,28,46 electrochemical deposition of the Cu2S and CuS or Cu nanoparticles followed by sulfidation on FTO,47,48 electrospinning,49 and solvothermal and SILAR growth of copper sulfide on FTO.50–52 For example, Zhong’s group utilized CuxS/brass CE to obtain 5.5% efficiency of CdSe-sensitized cells53 and 7.04% efficiency of CuInS2-sensitized cells.22 Meng’s group firstly prepared Cu2S nanoparticles and then screen-printed the paste containing Cu2S or a composite of Cu2S and carbon black onto FTO glass as CEs to achieve efficiencies of 3.71% and 3.87% respectively for the CdS/CdSe-sensitized solar cells.28,46 Recently, a new in situ preparation method using chemical bath deposition (CBD) combining TiCl4 pre- and post-treatment to obtain 4.59% efficiency has also been reported.54 Transparent Cu1.8S/CuS CEs have been reported by Joo et al. via a hydrothermal deposition method with 1.66% efficiency for CdS QDSCs.50 All the as-prepared CEs exhibited different advantages and shortcomings. From the viewpoint of efficiency, CuxS/brass CE based QDSCs commonly show the highest efficiency due to high catalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance. However, the electrodes suffering from continuous corrosion of polysulfide electrolyte is a fatal weakness reflecting on the poor stability and sealing problem.55 From the viewpoint of chemical and mechanical stability, CEs prepared through other methods are advantageous, but have lower efficiencies. Typically, the screen-printing method, in which ethyl cellulose, terpineol and ethanol solutions were added into pre-prepared copper sulfide catalysts to make pastes, followed by screen-printing onto FTO glass, is low cost, convenient and scalable. However, it is still highly urgent to improve the efficiency, reproducibility and stability of these devices.
In this work, CuS/Cu1.8S composite nanomaterials have been conveniently prepared via a solvothermal method, made into pastes and then screen-printed onto FTO glass to produce a copper sulfide based CE, referred to as the CuxS/FTO CE. A record PCE of 6.28% was achieved for the CdSe-sensitized solar cell. The conservation and irradiation stability of the device were observed over a long period of time. Upon the investigation of over 110 cells, CuxS/FTO CE based QDSCs were statistically superior in performance to the CuxS/brass CE based ones with higher open-circuit photovoltages (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc), and slightly lower fill factors (FF). The lower FFs are associated with larger sheet resistances (RS), resulting from poorer conductivity of the copper sulfide semiconductor compared to brass and was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement.
2. Experimental section
Preparation of the copper sulfide counter electrode
The CuxS nanoparticles were first prepared by a solvothermal method. Typically, 3.2 mmol of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (copper(II) acetate monohydrate, 640 mg) and 9.6 mmol of thiourea (366 mg) were respectively added into 30 mL of ethylene glycol, followed by sonification until the solutions were transparent. The two obtained solutions were mixed and then transferred into a 100 mL teflon-lined stainless autoclave, sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitates were purified with deionized water and ethanol respectively three times. A total of 250 mg of the dried CuxS nanoparticles were added to anhydrous ethanol under continuous sonication, together with 1.0 g of terpineol and 2.3 g of 10 wt% ethyl cellulose, followed by further sonication for 5 min to get a uniform mixture. The ethanol was then removed via a rotary-evaporator. The as-prepared CuxS pastes were screen-printed onto cleaned FTO glass. The CEs made by this method were referred to as CuxS/FTO CEs. In comparison, the CuxS/brass CEs were prepared by immersing brass foil in 1 M HCl solution at 70 °C for 5 min and then vulcanized using polysulfide solution.
Fabrication of CdSe-sensitized photoanodes and assembly of solar cells
The photoanodes were prepared according to our previous work.10,38,48,53 Typically, oleylamine (OAm) capped oil-soluble CdSe was prepared by a hot-injection method, followed by ligand exchange using mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) to produce water-soluble CdSe QDs. Mesoporous TiO2 film was soaked in the above QD aqueous solution for 2 h. After that, the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 film was alternatively immersed in Zn(OA)2 and Na2S aqueous solutions 4 times. Finally, the film was sintered at 300 °C for 2 min to obtain the expected photoanodes. The cells were assembled by sealing the CEs and CdSe-sensitized photoanodes using a thermoplastic spacer (DuPont™ Surlyn® 1702, thickness 60 μm). The polysulfide electrolyte, composed of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S and 0.2 M KCl in pure water, was injected into the cell through a pre-drilled hole in the CE.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured on a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed on a JEOL-2010 high-resolution electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a NOVA Nano SEM 450 system from FEI. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a PH1500C electron spectrometer using Mg-Kα as the radiation source with the powder samples prepared by scratching from the FTO glass. The amounts of copper and sulfur were also determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) (Agilent 725 ES). Photovoltaic performances of J–V curves were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel, model no. 94022A, equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp) with the light power calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by an NREL standard Si solar cell. The photoactive area was 0.237 cm2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on an impedance analyzer (Zahner, Germany) at 0 V bias potential and 20 mV of amplitude over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under dark conditions. A sandwich cell composed of two identical CEs (0.64 cm2), a thermoplastic spacer with a thickness of 60 μm, and a polysulfide electrolyte were used in the EIS measurements.
3. Results and discussion
Structure and morphology
In the reaction system to fabricate copper sulfide nanoparticles via the solvothermal method, the utilized thiourea played two important roles as a sulfur source and a ligand to complex with copper ions. Here, copper acetate was utilized to synthesize copper sulfide nanoparticles. The purity and crystallinity of the resulting samples were characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1. All the peaks could be indexed to hexagonal CuS (JCPDS no 06-0464) and rhombohedral Cu9S5, equal to Cu1.8S (JCPDS no 47-1748) with the typical facets labeled in the pattern. It could be deduced that the as-prepared copper sulfide is a mixture of CuS and Cu1.8S, consistent with previous reports.50,56Fig. 2a shows the TEM images of the products. It can be observed that the sample is composed of nanoparticles with two different sizes and shapes. The sheet size of the larger one (enlarged in Fig. 2b) ranges from 50–300 nm. The smaller one has a diameter in the range of 15–25 nm with a spherical shape. To further confirm the phases of the two types of particles with different sizes and shapes, the HRTEM images from a single smaller particle in Fig. 2a and a sheet in Fig. 2b were recorded as shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. For the smaller particle in Fig. 2c, the lattice fringes with spacings of 0.328 and 0.322 nm could be obviously observed. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is shown in the inset and assigned to (100) and (011) facets of hexagonal CuS, respectively, indicating the high crystallinity and high quality of the obtained CuS nanoparticles. For the larger particle in Fig. 2d, the lattice fringes with spacings of 0.32 and 0.27 nm could be assigned to (0015) and (010) facets of rhombohedral Cu1.8S. It is interesting that the electron diffraction (ED) pattern (inset of Fig. 2d) from the large particle seems to be a superlattice, exhibiting that several single crystal nanosheets stack with same incident directions. The result is consistent with a previous report from Nagarajan's group,57 in which the large plate-like morphology was ascribed to Cu1.8S, while the small and spherical particles were CuS. This has also been reflected by the XRD pattern in Fig. 1, in which the larger Cu1.8S shows a smaller peak width at half height (PWH), while the smaller CuS shows larger PWH.

Superior cell performance with high reproducibility
As described in the experimental section, the as-prepared copper sulfide nanostructures were first made into pastes, and then the pastes were screen-printed onto FTO glass to fabricate the CuxS/FTO CEs. To compare the efficiency and reproducibility of the devices, over 110 QDSCs using CuxS/FTO and CuxS/brass as CEs prepared at different batches were assembled and characterized with PCEs, as shown in Fig. 3a. It can be seen that all the cells exhibit excellent performance with PCEs generally located at 5.6–6.0%. Furthermore, judging from the amount of cells with higher PCEs, the CuxS/FTO CE based cells are superior to those based on CuxS/brass CEs. The average PCEs in one batch are 5.97 and 5.93% for CuxS/FTO and CuxS/brass, respectively. The obtained maximum PCEs for the CuxS/FTO and CuxS/brass based cells (denoted CuxS/FTO CE-m and CuxS/brass CE-m) are 6.28% and 6.19%, respectively, and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3b with parameters summarized in Table 1. The Jsc of 16.97 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.611 V for the CuxS/FTO based cell are slightly greater than that for the CuxS/brass one, with a Jsc of 16.70 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.589 V. However, the FF value is lower for the CuxS/FTO based cell. In order to further investigate the parameters affecting the performances, the two types of CE based cells, with a similar PCE value of 6.16%, were also studied with J–V curves and the parameters are shown in Fig. 3b and Table 1 (the samples were labeled as CuxS/FTO CE-s and CuxS/brass CE-s). The larger Jsc/Voc and lower FF for the CuxS/FTO cell could also be observed. From these results, it could be concluded that the superior performance for the CuxS/FTO based cells is associated with the higher Jsc and higher Voc, but the FF is slightly lower, which is closely related with the nature of the CE.

To further understand the differences and mechanisms for the two types of CE based QDSCs with similar PCE values, EIS measurements were carried out and the Nyquist plots were fitted by the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 3c and d with the fitting results extracted in Table 2. The RS is dependent on the conductivity, the impedance RCT1 is related to the solid–solid interface, herein representing the interface of CuxS and FTO or brass, and the impedance RCT2 is associated with the electron transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. In the case of the CuxS/FTO CE, the RCT1 and RCT2 are smaller, especially for the former, exhibiting a better electron transfer between CuxS/FTO and CE/electrolyte interfaces, leading to a superior electrochemical activity. Inversely, the RS of 19.57 Ω for CuxS/FTO is greatly larger than the RS of 0.51 Ω for CuxS/brass, associated with the poor conductivity of the semiconductor, and it could be considered as the main contributor to the larger FF. From these results, we concluded that the present CuxS nanostructures could be screen-printed onto FTO glass as a CuxS/FTO CE and the assembled QDSCs exhibit more excellent performance than those based on CuxS/brass, due to the higher Jsc and Voc. The lower FF comes from a naturally poorer conductivity compared to brass.

High stability of assembled devices
The motivation for replacing the brass-sulfidation reduced CE, i.e. CuxS/brass, is to obtain a high PCE as well as high stability. For characterization of the stability of the QDSCs, the PCEs and other parameters were generally measured under continuous illumination or at a given time interval, with the cells reserved at room temperature and under dark conditions.28,34,41,47–49,55 To evaluate the illumination stability, we measured the photocurrent of the two types of CE once per minute under continuous illumination. The results are shown in Fig. 4a. In the case of the CuxS/FTO CE based QDSC, the photocurrent remains steady and the drop is less than 2% during 2 h of illumination. However, in the case of CuxS/brass, the photocurrent drops to about 53% during 17 min of illumination. It should be noted that no water cooling device was used during illumination, which ensured that the test conditions were closer to the actual application conditions. Moreover, we also characterized the conservation stability by measuring the efficiency at an interval of several hours, during which the QDSCs were maintained at room temperature and under dark conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 4b. After 215 h, the PCE for the CuxS/FTO CE based QDSC changed from an initial 6.06% to 5.89% with a slight drop of 3%, suggesting the excellent stability of the cell using the as-prepared CuxS/FTO CE. However, in the case of CuxS/brass, the PCE drops from 5.52% to 2.32% after only 17 minutes. The great improvement in our cell performance can be mainly attributed to two reasons: (i) the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the copper sulfide nanostructures composed of CuS and Cu1.8S; (ii) the mechanical and chemical stability realized by replacing brass with FTO to avoid continuous corrosion of the polysulfide electrolyte and screen-printing technique. It also means that our solvothermally fabricated copper sulfide mixture could be utilized in QDSCs as CEs on a large scale with high catalytic activity and excellent stability.

Phase-composition dependent cell performance and mechanism
In an attempt to investigate the influence of phase and chemical composition in copper sulfide on the PCE of the QDSC based on CuxS/FTO CEs, assembled with a photoanode prepared in one batch, we synthesized several CuxS nanostructures by changing the molar ratio of Cu/S during the preparation. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves for different cells with the corresponding parameters shown in Table 3. When the S/Cu ratio was increased from 0.5 to 1, the FF value is greatly increased from 55.40% to 57.85% and the PCE increases from 5.40% to 5.68% without any obvious changes in the J and V values. When the ratio was increased to 1.5, the J and FF values dramatically increased to 16.40 mA cm−2 and 59.53%, respectively, making the PCE reach a maximum of 6.16%. With a further increase of the ratio to 2, the J, PCE and FF values decrease markedly to 15.73 mA cm−2, the lowest 5.28% and 53.76%, respectively. No obvious change in the voltage V could be seen in all cases. The best performance for the ratio of 1.5 was also confirmed from the IPCE curve (Fig. 5b), in which the largest IPCE value of ∼80% was observed in the range of 350–650 nm.

Fig. 5c shows the EIS spectra of the CEs prepared with different S/Cu ratios and the extracted parameters are shown in Table 4. When the S/Cu ratio was changed from 0.5 to 2, the RCT2 values changed irregularly, implying that the catalytic activity is not the only factor to influence the efficiency. The RCT1 values show the same change rule as that for the PCE, implying that the charge transfer resistance between the solid–solid interface increases along with the increase of the S/Cu ratio to 1.5. In the case of the S/Cu ratio of 1.5, the RCT1 and RCT2 show the lowest values, suggesting the lowest resistance between the solid–solid interface and highest catalytic activity. As for the RS value, which is mainly dependent on the conductivity, S/Cu ratios that are either too low (0.5) or too high (2) will lead to high series resistance.

To further probe the mechanism of the S/Cu ratio affecting the cell performance, XPS of films and ICP of powders were semi-quantitatively studied. The results are shown in Table 4. It can be seen from the results that the S component synchronously increases up to the S/Cu ratio of 1.5, indicative of the continuous decrease in Cu content. When the S/Cu ratio was further increased to 2, the S component in the sample is lower than that of 1.5. It should be noted that the prepared copper sulfide was composed of CuS and Cu1.8S at different S/Cu ratios, as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 6 and the XRD in Fig. S1 (ESI†), in which the nanoparticles and nanosheets represent the former and the latter. From the results, we think that the defects and relative phase contents in the mixture of CuS and Cu1.8S would affect the PCE. In the family of copper sulfide from stoichiometric CuS to Cu2S, the S/Cu ratio is in the range of 1–0.5 without consideration of defects. When the initial S/Cu is lower than 0.5, the S source is, on the one hand, not sufficient to complete the reaction, resulting in insufficient catalyst and poor activity. On the other hand, the formed copper sulfide, possibly with insufficient S, will be etched by a polysulfide electrolyte, showing poor cell performance. With the increased S source, the chemical reaction is complete, leading to enough catalyst and excellent cell performance, corresponding to S/Cu ratios of 1 and 1.5. If the S source was too rich, it is not favorable for the formation of copper sulfide, exhibiting the lower S component in the actual sample and poorer cell performance, similar to the case of a 0.5 S/Cu ratio. Because the CuS and Cu1.8S only existed in the product, the molar ratio of CuS/Cu1.8S could be roughly estimated to be negative (implying that it is not favorable for the formation of stoichiometric CuS), 0.272, 0.669, and 0.109, corresponding to the increased initial S/Cu ratios from 0.5 to 1, 1.5, and 2, respectively. Could it be concluded that CuS is more suitable for CEs than the Cu1.8S nanostructures? With this supposition, pure CuS, pure Cu1.8S, and the mixture were prepared according to a previous report57 and then assembled into the QDSC. The measured PCEs were 5.34%, 4.36% and 4.49% respectively. This result is consistent with our supposition and previous work.58 In addition to the phase, the conductivity ascribed to the copper vacancy in the p-type copper sulfide is strongly dependent on the chemical composition.59–61 More sulfur in the prepared sample will lead to more copper vacancies or heavy-doping, resulting in a rise in electrical conductivity.
 Fig. 6  TEM images of copper sulfide prepared at different Cu/S molar ratios. 
From these results, we can conclude that the initial S/Cu ratios played an important role in the performance of cells based on the copper sulfide CE. In the range of 0.5 to 1.5, the efficiency increased with the increasing ratios. Further increasing the S source, will inversely decrease the PCE. This phenomenon is associated with conductivity associated with copper vacancy and the relative phase contents in the mixture of CuS and Cu1.8S. The former is more favorable for CEs.
Influence of sintering temperature on cell performance and mechanism
The influence of sintering temperature on the cell performance has also been studied at 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C. The corresponding cells are denoted CuxS-300 °C/FTO, CuxS-400 °C/FTO, CuxS-500 °C/FTO, respectively. The J–V and IPCE curves are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the parameters are shown in Table 5. It could be seen that the best efficiency of 6.15% comes from the cell assembled with the CuxS-400 °C/FTO CE and the lowest efficiency of 5.40% is for the CE sintered at 300 °C. Comparing the parameters in Table 5, the J and V values barely change, but the FF values dramatically change with the sintering temperature (53.44%, 59.93%, and 57.83% for 300, 400, and 500 °C respectively), which is closely related with the nature of the CE. The mechanism will be exploited from the EIS, as shown in Fig. 7. As seen from the EIS parameters in Table 5, CuxS-400 °C/FTO has the lowest values of RS (19.57 Ω), RCT1 (0.273 Ω), RCT2 (0.374 Ω), indicative of the best conductivity, smallest charge transfer resistances in the solid–solid interface and between the catalysts and electrolyte. In comparison, CuxS-300 °C/FTO has the largest values, consistent with the poorest performance. As mentioned in the experimental section, organic terpineol and ethyl cellulose, with poor conductivities, were used to prepare the CEs, and could only be removed at an appropriate temperature. From the SEM images in Fig. S3,† when the CE was sintered at 300 °C, the smaller nanoparticles conjugate on the surface of larger islands, which are possibly composed of residual organics from the pastes because of a lower sintering temperature, resulting in poor conductivity and activity. When the temperature was raised to 400 °C, nearly no organics could be seen. From these data, it can be concluded that at a lower temperature of 300 °C, the poor conductivity is not favorable for the cell performance and at 400 °C, the conductivity and catalytic activity reach the maximum level, resulting in the highest efficiency.

4. Conclusions
The mixture of CuS and Cu1.8S has been easily fabricated via a solvothermal method followed by screen-printing, to form CEs. Compared with the brass foil-based CE, the assembled CdSe QDSCs show a great improvement in efficiency, stability and reproducibility. The highest efficiency of 6.28% has been achieved because of the higher photocurrent and photovoltage. Both excellent irradiation and conservation stability have also been obtained due to the anti-corrosion properties of the counter electrodes and high electrochemical activity. The phase of CuS and Cu1.8S showed the slightly different effects on the cell's efficiency, and the efficiency of the former was much better than the latter. The sintering temperature of the CEs also played an important role in the efficiency. The appropriate temperature of 400 °C is favorable for good conductivity, low charge transfer resistance in the solid–solid interface and between the catalysts and electrolyte, and high electrochemical activity, resulting in the best cell performance. Because of low cost, convenient fabrication, easy of sealing, as well as high efficiency, excellent stability and reproducibility, the as-prepared copper sulfide CE could be potentially and extensively utilized in semiconductor-sensitized solar cells.
