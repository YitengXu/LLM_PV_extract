    , Accepted 20th December 2017First published on 20th December 2017AbstractPromising perovskite solar cell technology with soaring power conversion efficiencies has the common problems of low stability and high cost. This work provides a solution to these problems by employing a carbon sandwich structure, in which the fullerene bottom layer solves the stability issue and the carbon nanotube top electrode layer offers the merits of having high stability and being low-cost. Devices fabricated using different hole-transporting materials infiltrated into carbon nanotube networks were examined for their performance and stability under constant illumination in air. Polymeric hole-transporting layers show much higher stability when combined with carbon nanotubes due to their compact nature and stronger interaction with the carbon network. As a result, the encapsulated device showed high stability both in air and under light illumination, maintaining up to 80% of the initial efficiency after 2200 hours under actual operation conditions. Cost analysis also shows that using the polymeric hole-transporting materials in carbon nanotube films brings the fabrication cost down to less than 5.5% that of conventional devices. Our study proposes a promising cell structure toward highly stable and low-cost perovskite photovoltaic technologies for the future.
Introduction
Since Miyasaka and colleagues incorporated perovskite semiconductors into photovoltaic devices,1 and Park and colleagues realized solidified lead halide perovskites,2 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received much attention on account of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the other advantages of organic solar cells.3–7 Their reported PCEs have soared rapidly in the last five years, and now some certified efficiencies exceed 20%.8,9 However, critical shortcomings remain, mainly the high cost and low stability, and these need to be addressed. Numerous research groups around the world are working on these issues. To reduce the fabrication cost, hole-conductor and metal-free PSCs have been suggested,10–12 and more stable materials with additional encapsulating structures are under intense research.13–15 As a solution to the aforementioned drawbacks, carbon nanotube (CNT) film has been shown to be effective for replacing metal electrodes and enhancing the stability of PSCs in air.16–18 For example, Snaith and colleagues19 and Matsuda and colleagues20 have demonstrated that the hydrophobic nature of CNTs can allow for effective passivation. Nevertheless, they relied on expensive gold electrodes.11 Li et al.21 and Aitola et al.22 used aerosol-produced single-walled CNTs as top electrodes to replace metals and hole-conductors but they used high temperature-annealed TiO2, which gave a relatively low performance and high hysteresis, respectively.23 Although the use of C60 as an electron transport layer instead of TiO2 has been reported to give less hysteresis, an expensive metal electrode was used and the stability has not been confirmed.24–26
Here, we report PSCs in which a lead halide perovskite layer is sandwiched by C60 and single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) without metal electrodes. Our carbon allotrope sandwich approach not only provides long-term stability by preventing moisture penetration and charge trapping27via the highly effective electron extracting layer of C60 and hydrophobic SWCNT electrodes, but also leads to low-cost fabrication by removing expensive metal electrodes and allowing for a room temperature process to be used. The air-processed PSCs with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/C60/CH3NH3PbI3/CNT were tested for the aspects of stability and cost by infiltrating three mainstream hole-transporting materials (HTMs), namely 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD),2,28–30 poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA),31 and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), into a porous SWCNT electrode.32,33
Results and discussion
First, the carbon-sandwiched perovskite device without a HTM was studied using aerosol-synthesized CNTs34,35 on top of MAPbI3 (ITO/C60/MAPbI3/CNT). To confirm the stability and hysteresis improvement via the carbon-sandwiched approach, we compared two types of device with the structural configurations ITO/C60/MAPbI3/CNT (Fig. 1a) and FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/CNT (Fig. 1b). The photovoltaic characteristics and J–V curve data of the two devices can be found in Table 1. The C60-based device with CNT electrodes shows higher photovoltaic performance than the TiO2-based device with CNT electrodes. Moreover, there is a dramatic improvement in terms of the J–V curve hysteresis for the C60-based device. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the forward and backward scans of the J–V curves show that the C60-based devices show negligible photocurrent hysteresis, while the TiO2-based devices show severe photocurrent hysteresis. Considering that such photocurrent hysteresis is induced by charge trapping, a device with severe hysteresis can be deteriorated by trapped charge-driven degradation of perovskite materials.27 To confirm the effect of charge trapping on device stability, we measured the normalized PCEs as a function of time under the constant illumination of one sun under ambient conditions without encapsulation as can be seen in Fig. 1e. It is notable that the normalized PCEs of the TiO2-based devices decayed much faster than those of the C60-based device over time under the same conditions, which is consistent with previous work employing C70.36 The chemical capacitance values of the TiO2- and C60-based devices were evaluated as a function of voltage as shown in Fig. S1.† From these results, we confirmed that charge trapping at the interface between the perovskite and TiO2 layers is much greater than that in the case of the C60-based device. Accordingly, the instability of the TiO2-based device is attributed to such charge trapping. These observations are likely to be indicative of the existence of a strong correlation between hysteresis and device stability.

ITO/C60/MAPbI3/CNT devices without additional HTM gave an efficiency of 13.2% and showed high reproducibility with an average PCE of 12.4 ± 0.9% (Table 2). However, additional HTM infiltration into the porous SWCNTs could enhance the performance and stability. To examine the effect of additional HTMs, we employed three HTMs: spiro-MeOTAD, PTAA, and P3HT. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the HTMs were thoroughly infiltrated inside the CNT network (Fig. S2†). Addition of spiro-MeOTAD, PTAA, and P3HT increased the PCE to 17.0%, 15.3%, and 13.6%, respectively (Fig. 2a and b and Table 2). Upon the addition of HTM, the improvement in the PCEs resulted from the increases in JSC and VOC due to better energy alignment and increased carrier density, and a higher fill factor (FF) due to the improved hole-transporting ability. All the devices with HTMs added showed negligible hysteresis as expected (Table S1†). The addition of HTMs brings another effect in terms of protecting the infiltration of water vapor, which results in improved device stability. When the encapsulated devices were tested under one sun illumination in air, the devices with HTMs added showed much higher stability than the CNT-only devices without additional HTM (Fig. 2c). This means that the hydrophobic CNT film alone was not sufficient to block out the atmospheric moisture and that the application of HTM is crucial for obtaining long-term stability. Addition of the HTM not only reinforced the hole-transporting ability of CNTs, but the HTM also functioned as an encapsulation material by filling up the CNT network.37 The devices with HTMs added showed even higher stability than the reference devices using gold. This clearly indicates that CNT-laminated devices show excellent stability. Among the different HTMs, the devices with P3HT and PTAA exhibited much higher stability than those with spiro-MeOTAD. To investigate the reason for this, we carried out water vapor transmittance rate (WVTR) measurement to find out the moisture barrier ability of the CNTs and the CNT films with HTMs added (Fig. 2d and S3†). Even though Snaith and colleagues compared the thermal stability of those three HTMs briefly, there has not been a detailed account on the moisture passivation mechanism.19 As shown in Fig. 2d, a CNT film without a HTM showed a large value of the WVTR, in agreement with the poor water barrier ability and very low stability shown in Fig. 2c.

(c) Light-induced charge stability test of the unencapsulated devices with CNTs, CNTs with spiro-MeOTAD, CNTs with PTAA, or CNTs with P3HT as the top electrode, and also of the reference device with spiro-MeOTAD wth Au as the top electrode. (d) WVTR figure of merit with the raw data in the inset. 
The CNT films with HTM added showed a much higher barrier ability than those without HTM and their WVTR trend matched the stability trend among the HTMs (Fig. 2c and d). Such different barrier abilities could be inferred from the different molecular structures. Comparing the three HTMs, the chain-like polymers (PTAA and P3HT) can seal CNTs more effectively than the unchained spiro-MeOTAD. Moreover, the conjugated polymers can induce π–π interactions with the CNTs, forming supramolecular CNT–polymer hybrids,38–40 explaining their lower WVTR values.41–43 We also did computational calculations with P3HT and PTAA to investigate their molecular configurations.41 As shown in Fig. 3a and S4,† P3HT has a planar configuration while PTAA has a staggered configuration due to steric effects. The planar conformation of P3HT allows for stacked crystallization, leading to a more closely packed structure, which results in P3HT being more water-tight than PTAA when they aggregate (Fig. 3b). P3HT forming a densely packed crystallite was previously confirmed experimentally using X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the literature.42,43 Moreover, planar P3HT has been reported to closely interact with CNTs by wrapping around the nanotubes, indicating good integration with CNTs using π–π interactions (Fig. 3c).44,45 However, PTAA with a staggered conformation could not stick to the nanotubes. Thus, P3HT forms a more effective nanohybrid with the CNTs than PTAA does. Although p-doping with a lithium salt is commonly done to increase hole mobility,46–49 the stability of the PSCs could be lowered due to its hygroscopic nature. In addition, the P3HT CNT film with a dopant added showed an increase in water permeability (Fig. 2d, WVTR data). Thus, we conclude that P3HT, which functions as a HTM without the need for ionic dopants, would be the best choice for the solution to achieve high stability and low cost PSCs.32

(f) Time evolution of the normalized PCEs of the glass-encapsulated CNT + P3HT-based device. The PCEs were evaluated from the J–V scan (black) and maximum power point (red). 
To date, many reported PSCs claiming high stability have been tested using a UV filter, or with a low light intensity, sometimes under dark conditions, or in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.50–54 However, a proper stability test of PSCs should be carried out under light illumination in a real atmosphere to confirm the possibility of their practical use. Therefore, we monitored the J–V characteristics of the best-performing glass-encapsulated ITO/C60/MAPbI3/P3HT/CNT device stored under open-circuit conditions under AM 1.5G one sun illumination including UV radiation in ambient air for up to 2200 hours (Fig. 3d–f). We used conventional encapsulation with a glass cover using UV curing resin without any special technique.52 Our encapsulated device maintained up to 80% of its initial PCE after 2200 hours, demonstrating its state-of-the-art long-term operational stability compared to devices reported in the literature.
Another merit of our carbon-sandwiched PSCs should be the low fabrication cost, which is mainly attributed to the replacement of expensive metal electrodes such as gold with CNT films. Even if we consider relatively cheaper metals, for example silver and aluminium, there are some limitations for PSC commercialization due to their cost and reactivity to the iodine of the perovskite and oxygen in the air.55 Also, spiro-MeOTAD is known to be expensive compared to other raw materials used in PSCs because it is prepared through a difficult and costly synthetic route.10,56 Accordingly, our carbon-sandwiched approach (ITO/C60/MAPbI3/P3HT/CNT) brings down the cost greatly due to the earth-abundant nature of carbon materials and stability in air. To confirm the cost-effectiveness, we conducted a cost analysis of lab-scale fabrication as shown in Table S2 and Fig. S5.† Our devices bring down the fabrication cost to less than 5.5% that of conventional devices (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au). If we take into account the fabrication set-up and production time on a mass-scale, the cost can be expected to go down even further because of the low-temperature processability.
Conclusions
Air-processed carbon allotrope-sandwiched PSCs with a configuration of ITO/C60/MAPbI3/CNT without a HTM produced a PCE of 13.2% with a cost down to less than 5.5% that of the conventional devices. Upon the addition of a HTM onto the CNTs, the PCE and stability are significantly enhanced. The addition of spiro-MeOTAD increased the PCE to 17%, which is a record-high efficiency among the CNT-laminated solar cells. Nevertheless, we think that the fabrication cost is relatively high and the stability should be improved further. Application of polymeric HTMs improved the stability even further at the expense of PCE. In this regard, the application of P3HT led to a much better stability than that of PTAA due to its more compact packing and enhanced interaction with CNTs. Simple glass encapsulation of our carbon-sandwiched ITO/C60/MAPbI3/P3HT/CNT devices led to maintained stability for up to 2200 hours under constant illumination of one sun (100% light intensity), without a UV filter, under ambient conditions. The development of more sophisticated encapsulation techniques should further improve the stability of our carbon-sandwiched PSCs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of CNT films
Randomly oriented CNT networks with high purity and a long nanotube bundle length can be synthesized by the aerosol chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method.33,34 The floating catalyst aerosol CVD was carried out in a scaled-up reaction tube with a diameter of 150 mm. The catalyst precursor was vaporised by passing ambient temperature CO through a cartridge filled with ferrocene powder. To obtain stable growth of the CNTs, a controlled amount of CO2 was added with the carbon source (CO). CNTs were directly collected downstream of the reactor by filtering the flow through a nitrocellulose or silver membrane filter (Millipore Corp., USA; HAWP, 0.45 μm pore diameter). The flow containing ferrocene vapour was then introduced into the high-temperature zone of a ceramic tube reactor through a water-cooled probe and mixed with additional CO. Ferrocene vapour was thermally decomposed in the gas phase of the aerosol CVD reactor at 880 °C. The CO gas was supplied at 4 L min−1 and decomposed on the iron nanoparticles, resulting in the growth of CNTs. The as-synthesised CNTs were collected by passing the flow through microporous filters downstream of the reactor, while the transparency and sheet resistance were controlled by varying the collection time. The collected CNT networks were transferred to a variety of substrates through the dry press-transfer process. The FC-CVD synthesised and dry deposited CNT networks were of high purity. Furthermore, as the process requires no sonication-based dispersion steps, the resulting CNT network consisted of exceptionally long CNTs.
Solar cell fabrication
The ITO devices were fabricated on commercially obtained ITO-coated glass substrates (AMG, 9.5 Ω cm−2, 25 × 25 mm2). The ITO-coated glass substrates were used after sequential cleaning in acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water using an ultrasonic bath (15 min each), followed by drying with nitrogen gas and storing in an oven at 120 °C. Right before use, the ITO-coated glass substrates were subjected to UV-O3 treatment for 30 min. A 35 nm thick C60 layer was densely coated on the ITO glass substrates using a vacuum thermal evaporator at a constant rate of 0.2 Å s−1.
The MAPbI3 perovskite layers were fabricated via the Lewis base adduct method described by Ahn et al.3 A 1:1:1 molar ratio mixture of PbI2 (Alfa Aesar), MAI (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 50 wt% without heating. The fully dissolved solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3500 rpm for 20 s, with 0.3 mL diethyl ether dropped in 8 s after starting the spin-coating process. The transparent green film, the so-called CH3NH3I·PbI2·DMSO adduct film, changed to a dark brown color by heating at 65 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 4 min.
The prepared CNT films were mechanically transferred to the top of the perovskite layer. A spiro-MeOTAD solution, which was prepared by mixing 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD (Merck), 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, was spin-coated on the CNT film at 1800 rpm for 30 s. To prepare the PTAA solution, 10 mg of PTAA (EM index, [Mn] = 17500 g mol−1) was dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene with the addition of 4 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 8 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (170 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile). The PTAA solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. In the case of P3HT, 10 mg of P3HT (Sigma-Aldrich) was fully dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene by heating at 70 °C for 1 h. The solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s.
To prepare encapsulated CNT-P3HT devices, the complete CNT-P3HT devices were covered by a plain glass cover (AMG, 18 × 18 mm2). Each side of the glass cover were filled with a UV-curable epoxy resin by an automated movable resin dispenser. The encapsulation process was finished by treating the encapsulated devices with UV for 10 min to harden the epoxy sealant.
Characterizations
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured by a software-controlled source meter (Keithley 2400) under dark conditions and 1 sun AM 1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Sol 3A Class AAA 64023A, Oriel), which was calibrated using the KG-5 standard Si-cell. To extract the chemical capacitance, we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis with CHI 600D (CH Instruments). Nyquist plots were obtained in the frequency range of 0.05 Hz to 1 MHz under simulated one sun illumination with various applied voltages. Each plot was fitted using an equivalent circuit consisting of a series resistance and two resistance–capacitance components.
To evaluate the long-term stability of the devices, we used a chamber that can maintain a constant temperature and illuminate continuously with AM 1.5G one sun illumination. The temperature and relative humidity in the chamber were maintained at 20 °C and 15% on average, respectively. Considering the average daylight time and actual operation, the light was turned on continuously for about 11 hours a day and was off at night time. The encapsulated device was continuously stored in the chamber from 4th November, 2016. The total illumination time was 650 hours.
In the stability test, the J–V curves were measured by a reverse and forward scan to estimate the PCE at the maximum power point (MPP). Averaged J–V curves were obtained by averaging the two J–V curves of both the reverse and forward scans, which reflect the stabilization during actual operation. The PCEs at the MPP were estimated from the averaged J–V curves.
Computational calculations
Structural optimizations were carried out using the Gaussian09 package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Fig. S5† shows the optimized chemical structures of the P3HT pentamer and PTAA trimer.
