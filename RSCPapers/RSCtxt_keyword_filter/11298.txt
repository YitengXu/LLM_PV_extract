    , Accepted 26th October 2022First published on 26th October 2022AbstractThere are a large number of defects on the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite layer, which is an important reason for the further development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, an improved strategy is proposed. By introducing the additive SnI2 into the antisolvent, not only is Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite formed, but SnI2 as a passivation agent also successfully passivates the defects of the perovskite film. Through the dual effect of SnI2, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is significantly improved, the charge recombination is inhibited, and the charge transfer efficiency is also significantly improved. The perovskite solar cells prepared with this perovskite film achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.9% with a fill factor (FF) of 74.3%, and benefitting from the improved quality of the perovskite film, the initial efficiency of 88% was maintained after exposing the device to air with a relative humidity of 30% for 1056 hours.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have grabbed much attention in the photovoltaic field due to their rapid enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the past ten years. Specifically, the certified record efficiency of PSCs has reached 25.7% from a bare initial 3.8% in 2009, showing great potential for commercial application.1,2 However, the efficiency of PSCs still needs to be improved compared with that of silicon solar cells. More importantly, PSC stability has become a serious obstacle to further application and research.
For these issues, many strategies have been used to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.3–5 For example, controlling components for high-performance perovskite materials,6–8 improving the quality of perovskite films using advanced preparation technology and good additives,9–11 reducing the carrier loss in transport and transfer processes by employing suitable charge transport materials,12,13 and increasing photon capture capability by combining other optical materials.14,15 Therein, how to prepare ideal perovskite film materials is crucial to develop the high-performance (high-efficiency and long-term stability) PSCs. On the one hand, the perovskite properties highly depend on the material components. Based on this, a series of materials have been exploited by changing the chemical elements in perovskites. From previous reports, perovskite Sn–Pb alloying is an effective way to develop the desirable perovskite materials for high-performance PSCs, which have some outstanding advantages: narrow bandgaps, low toxicity, high carrier mobility, and inhibition of the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+.16–21 For instance, Chen et al.16 successfully prepared a series of all-inorganic CsPb1−xSnxI2Br perovskites with tunable bandgaps from 1.92 to 1.38 eV, which displayed more stability than the pure CsPbI2Br perovskites. As a result, the fabricated Sn–Pb alloyed PSCs show a champion PCE of 10.39% with improved phase stability and long-term ambient stability against light, heat, and humidity. Leijtens et al.17 studied the degradation mechanisms of pure Sn and Sn–Pb alloyed perovskites, and found that Pb can reduce the oxidation kinetics of Sn in Sn–Pb alloyed perovskites. On the other hand, the perovskite film contains a large number of defects that need an additive to reduce their adverse effect on the photoelectric properties of perovskite. The additives can be used in perovskite precursor solution or post-treatment, such as halide salts (e.g., EuCl2,22 KI,23 CsI,24 and NaF25), organic molecules (e.g., UAT,26 AALs,27 capsaicin,28 and phthalimide29), and ionic liquids (e.g., BMPBF4,30 BMIMBF4 (ref. 31) and PATMBF4 (ref. 32)). Specifically, some halide salts of perovskite raw materials can also passivate the defects. For example, excess PbI2 can passivate the grain boundaries and surface defects of Pb-based perovskites, and plays a role in tailoring energy band bending to reduce charge carrier recombination.33 Excess SnI2 can restrain the oxidization of Sn2+ to Sn4+ during the growth of the perovskite film for Sn-based perovskites.34 PbI2 and SnI2 are also raw materials to build the Pb–Sn alloy perovskites. During this process, if the passivation effect can be achieved, it will be more to promote the development of high-performance PSCs. Meanwhile, it can simplify the preparation process and reduce the cost of production for future PSCs.
In this paper, we use excess SnI2 to develop a new method for high-performance PSCs. Therein, the Pb based quasi-perovskite film is first prepared from PbI2 material and then the excess SnI2 in anti-solvent (ether) is spin-coated onto the surface of the Pb perovskite film to form Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite after heat treatment. The results display that the Sn element is evenly distributed in the perovskite film just like Pb, indicating that stable Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite has been built. Moreover, SnI2 can be also regarded as an additive to passivate the Pb-based perovskite, which is confirmed from the study on the carrier dynamics. Through regulating the concentration of SnI2 in the anti-solvent, high-performance PSCs are prepared when the concentration is 0.1 mg mL−1. A champion PCE of 20.9% increased from 18.8% for the control device can be achieved, and the VOC, JSC and FF are all improved markedly due to the double functions of SnI2 for PSCs. Accordingly, the device stability is also observably enhanced, in which the unencapsulated SnI2 treated device maintains 88% of its initial PCE after aging for over 1056 hours at room temperature and ∼30% RH under ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
In this work, we used excess SnI2 as a multifunctional additive to treat the Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (CsFAMA(Pb)) perovskite films, in which the excess SnI2 can passivate the perovskite films and provide the Sn element for Pb based perovskite to form the Pb–Sn alloyed one (CsFAMA(Pb–Sn)). The schematic diagram of Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite is displayed in Fig. 1a. The obtained films were detected by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1b. We have calculated the lattice constants of the two thin films by using the main peaks, and the result showed that the lattice constants become larger after introducing SnI2 because these peaks move to smaller angles (Table S1†), which is related to the formation of Pb–Sn perovskite. At the same time, these main diffraction peaks have been enhanced after introducing SnI2, hinting that the crystallinity of Pb-based perovskite films is improved by SnI2. The morphology of the perovskite films was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the SnI2 modified perovskite film has more dense and homogeneous crystal particles compared with the control one. The corresponding grain size statistics for these films are recorded and shown in Fig. S1,† and they show the increased grain size from 220 nm to 250 nm after introducing SnI2. that is also confirmed from the cross-sectional SEM diagrams (Fig. S2†). Meanwhile, the surface morphology of these films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The 3D images are displayed in Fig. 1e, and the corresponding 2D images are shown in Fig. S3.† From these results, it is found that the SnI2 treated perovskite film has a smoother surface than the control one, which is consistent with the results measured by SEM from the above discussion. The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of SnI2 treated and control perovskites is 19.2 and 27.9 nm, respectively (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, the energy dispersion spectra (EDS) of the elements were obtained during the SEM testing process. Fig. 1g and h show cross-section EDS mappings of Pb and Sn for the ITO/SnO2/CsFAMA(Pb–Sn) film, respectively. It is found that the Sn element is evenly distributed throughout the whole perovskite film like Pb. There is no obvious gradient distribution because Sn is added later by dissolving SnI2 in the anti-solvent. The mapping for other elements is displayed in Fig. S4.† The top-view EDS mapping for these elements is obtained as well, as shown in Fig. S5.† From the results, it is demonstrated that Sn can be evenly distributed on the surface of the perovskite film like the other elements, e.g., Pb, Cs and Br. And, there is no apparent precipitation of SnI2 though it is in excess. In a word, we can see from the above discussion that Sn from excess SnI2 used in the anti-solvent can be used to form stable Pb–Sn perovskite and to prepare the perovskite films with a large crystal size.

The structure of PSCs assembled in this work is ITO/SnO2/CsFAMA(Pb–Sn)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 2a. As shown in Fig. 2b–f, 25 individual devices per concentration have been employed to research the relation between their photovoltaic properties and SnI2 amount under irradiation with a xenon lamp light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. In the range of the SnI2 concentration from 0 to 0.2 mg mL−1 used during the process of anti-solvent treatment, the averages for the open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE of these devices all first increase and then decrease with the increase in the SnI2 concentration. When the concentration is 0.1 mg mL−1, the VOC, FF and PCE are at their best, and the average values are increased to 1.14 V, 72.72% and 19.48% from 1.12 V, 70.85% and 18.37% of the control devices (0 mg/mL SnI2), respectively. Although the dependence of average JSC on SnI2 concentration is not prominent, JSC still has the best value at 0.1 mg/mL SnI2 as well, and its average value is increased to 22.72 mA cm−2 from 22.4 mA cm−2 at 0 mg/mL SnI2. Likewise, the champion PCE is also achieved at an SnI2 concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1, as easily seen from Fig. 2e and f. The corresponding photocurrent density versus photovoltage (J–V) curves of ITO/SnO2/CsFAMA(Pb)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au with/without SnI2 are displayed in Fig. 2g, and their parameters are shown in Table 1. Therein, champion PCE, FF, VOC and JSC are increased to 20.91%, 74.37%, 1.141 V and 24.65 mA cm−2 of the device with 0.1 mg mL−1 SnI2 from 18.91%, 74.73%, 1.116 V and 22.67 mA cm−2 of the solar cell without SnI2. The improvement in the properties could hint at the reduction of carrier loss and the enhancement of light absorption for SnI2 modified perovskites, which may be attributed to the formation of Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite and passivation of the defects in perovskite by excess SnI2. The corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and integrated current densities are depicted in Fig. 2h for the PSCs with/without 0.1 mg/mL SnI2. From the IPCE curves, it can be confirmed that the light-harvesting capability has been enhanced in the UV-vis spectra after addition of 0.1 mg/mL SnI2. The integrated current densities of devices with/without SnI2 are 22.81 mA cm−2 and 21.13 mA cm−2, respectively, which is very close to their JSC values in J–V curves from the above discussion. In addition, the stable steady-state power output (SPO) for the above two devices with/without SnI2 is measured, and the maximum power points (MPP) are collected to evaluate the stability (Fig. 2i). At 0.855 V and 0.908 V bias voltages, SPO stabilizes at 18.93% and 20.32% for control and SnI2 modified devices with an active area of 0.04 cm2 under continuous light exposure for 500 s, and the corresponding JSC are maintained at around 22.72 and 23.95 mA cm−2, respectively.

Fig. 3a shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the CsFAMA(Pb) films with/without 0.1 mg/mL SnI2. After SnI2 treatment, the light absorption of the perovskite film is distinctly enhanced, especially in the short wavelength range (≤500 nm), which is consistent with the results of the IPCE test. The inset of Fig. 3a shows the plots of the (A × hν)2versus photon energy hν curve, in which the absorption edge is only changed a little from 1.61 to 1.62 V after SnI2 treatment. The improvement of light absorption can be attributed to the perovskite transformation from only Pb based into Pb–Sn alloyed.16 Moreover, the better crystallinity perovskite film contributes to the stronger light absorption.35 From the above discussion, SnI2 can improve the crystallinity of CsFAMA(Pb) perovskite, which is deemed as an another reason for the enhanced absorption.

The other optical properties of steady state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) intensity decay were tested for the glass/CsFAMA(Pb)/spiro-OMeTAD structures with/without SnI2 treating perovskite films in order to discuss the charge-carrier dynamics in their devices. Light with 515 nm wavelength was used to illuminate the perovskite films, and 770 nm-wavelength photons were detected after light excitation to research the photon excitation and TRPL decay. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL intensity is reduced after the addition of SnI2, which suggests that the devices with SnI2 have faster transfer and extraction of photogenerated holes to spiro-OMeTAD compared with the bare films. The faster the transfer and extraction of photogenerated electrons, the lower the carrier loss in SnI2 modified devices.36–38 Meanwhile, the PL peak has a slight blue-shift and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) increases after introducing SnI2, which may be due to the formation of Sn–Pb alloying perovskite and the passivation effect of SnI2.39 To quantify the photoinduced charge extraction and transport processes, the TRPL decay curves were obtained as shown in Fig. 3c, and fitted by using a biexponential rate law of I(t) = I0 + A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2 exp(−t/τ2), where A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes, and τ1 and τ2 represent time constants for fast and slow decay lifetimes, respectively (Table 2). From these results, the bare sample has τ1 = 1.87 ns, τ2 = 14.34 ns and τavg = 3.35 ns, while the SnI2 treated one has τ1 = 0.48 ns, τ2 = 15.53 ns, and τavg = 0.48 ns. τ1 and τ2 are related to nonradiative recombination and radiative recombination from the perovskite film, respectively.40,41 Therefore, the shorter decay time represents the lower carrier recombination loss for the SnI2 sample, which improves the photovoltaic properties.

Furthermore, the carrier dynamics can be confirmed by the dark J–V measurements, as shown in Fig. 3d. The SnI2 treated device has a lower dark current than the control one, indicating less carrier recombination and stronger interfacial contact, which can lead to improved photovoltaic properties such as PCE and FF.18,42 The dependence of VOC and JSC on light intensity (I) were measured to investigate the effect of excess SnI2 on the charge complexation and transport kinetics for CsFAMA(Pb) perovskite devices. As displayed in Fig. 3e, VOC of the devices with/without SnI2 are both proportional to the logarithm of light intensity [ln(I)]. The slopes (SV) are 1.47kBT/e and 1.68kBT/e for these two devices after linear fitting, respectively. In general, when SV exceeds 1kBT/e, trap-assisted recombination is weak for perovskites if its value is close to 1kBT/e.35,43 From the above results, the slope of the excess SnI2 treated devices is closer to 1kBT/e, indicating that SnI2 can effectively reduce trap-assisted recombination. Like with VOC, JSC has a god linear relationship (SJ represents the slope) with I as well, in which the ideal value of SJ should be 1. As shown in Fig. 3f, the values of SJ are 0.89 and 0.85 for the devices with/without SnI2, respectively, which also demonstrates that SnI2 can reduce trap-assisted charge recombination. Meanwhile, we tested the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the PSCs to study the SnI2 effect on their properties. The experimental results are exhibited in Fig. 3g, and the parameters are recorded in Table 3 after fitting the equivalent circuit. Therein, RS, RCT1 and RCT2 are the resistance for the whole device, spiro-OMeTAD layer and charge recombination, respectively.44 These parameters, especially RCT2, can embody the characteristics of charge-carrier dynamics. For our results, RCT1 is decreased while RCT2 is increased for the SnI2 treated device compared with the control cell, which indicates that the carriers are easier to transport in the spiro-OMeTAD layer but the recombination will have greater resistance in the device after SnI2 treatment. Therefore, it also confirms that excess SnI2 can suppress carrier recombination and promote charge transport in the Pb-based PSCs.

Carrier recombination is related to the defect states, in which the probability of recombination is greater if the defects are more. To directly investigate the changes in carrier recombination, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model based on the hole-only devices of ITO/PTAA/CsFAMA(Pb)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au with/without SnI2 treated CsFAMA(Pb) perovskite films was measured. The trap density (Ntrap) can be calculated from the equation Ntrap = 2ε0εVTFL/eL2, where ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and relative dielectric constant (ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1, ε = 47), respectively, L is the thickness of the perovskite layer and e is the elementary charge.45 The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) can be obtained from the dark J–V curves (Fig. 3i). The calculated Ntrap value of SnI2 treated devices is reduced to 3.56 × 1015 cm−3 from 4.12 × 1015 cm−3 of the control cell, which suggests that SnI2 could efficiently passivate the defects of the Pb-based perovskite film. The influence of SnI2 on the charge density at the perovskite/HTL interface can be described by using the M-S calculation: 1/C2 = 2(Vbi − V)/(A2eε0εNA).46Vbi determines the built-in field of devices, derived from the difference in Fermi levels between perovskite and the HTL, which is observed when 1/C2 = 0. As shown in Fig. 3h, it is easily concluded that Vbi is increased from 0.99 V to 1.04 V after using SnI2. The higher the Vbi becomes, the stronger the built-in field gets, and the more carriers will be transported to the HTL. Thus, the carrier dynamics in the SnI2 treated PSCs is improved and the efficiency of PSCs is enhanced.
Due to the improvement of the carrier dynamics and defect state in CsFAMA(Pb) PSCs, the device stability will be also enhanced. As shown in Fig. 4, we performed a series of stability tests for ITO/SnO2/CsFAMA(Pb)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and ITO/SnO2/CsFAMA (Pb–Sn)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au cells in tambient, thermal and illumination environments. Fig. 4a shows the stability test results of these two PSCs placed under an ambient atmosphere (RH ∼30%) for 1056 hours. The efficiency of the SnI2 treated device remains at 88% of its initial efficiency at 1056 hours, but that of control device decays to 73% of its initial efficiency under the same condition. The improvement of stability in a 30% humidity environment is also related with the enhancement in hydrophobicity of the perovskite film (Fig. S6†). Specifically, though part of the Sn2+ is oxidized to Sn4+ (Fig. S7†), it does not deteriorate the stability of this Sn–Pb alloyed PSCs, which also displays the advantage of the SnI2 additive to treat the Pb-based PSCs. The thermal-stability test results are shown in Fig. 4b for the two devices under a N2 environment with 85 °C continuous heating for 360 hours. The efficiency of the SnI2 treated device retains 42% of its initial efficiency in the end, whereas the control one still has only 27% of its initial value left. In addition, the light-stability test results are shown in Fig. 4c for the two devices under N2 conditions with continuous illumination (100 mW cm−2) from the ITO side for 120 hours. The improved cell can retain 54% of its initial efficiency while the control device only retains 37% of its initial efficiency. It is easily concluded from these stability tests that excess SnI2 can enhance effectively the stability of Pb-based PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated an effective strategy to improve the PCE and stability of Pb-based PSCs by using excess SnI2 to treat Pb-based perovskite films, in which SnI2 is used as an additive and dissolved in an anti-solvent. On the one hand, Sn can form Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite with Pb in this way. On the other hand, SnI2 has the effect of defect passivation for the Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite. Moreover, SnI2 also effectively enhances the hydrophobicity of this perovskite film. As a result, the SnI2 treated device with the optimum concentration (0.1 mg mL−1) for use in the anti-solvent achieves a champion PCE of 20.9% increased from 18.8% of the control device. Meanwhile, other parameters such as VOC, JSC and FF are all improved due to the double functions of SnI2 for PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated SnI2 treated device maintains 88% of its initial PCE after aging for over 1056 hours at room temperature and ∼30% RH under ambient conditions, and the thermal and illumination stabilities have also greatly improved. In a word, our work provides a simple and effective strategy for achieving high-efficiency and long-term stability PSCs.

Tin oxide aqueous solution (SnO2: 15% mass in a H2O colloidal dispersion with a few organic solvents) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The KCl solution was obtained by dissolving 5 mg of KCl in 1 mL of deionized water and stirring for 2 hours. The 15% concentration of SnO2 solution was diluted to 10% with the prepared KCl solution. The SnI2 dispersion is 0.6 mg of SnI2 dispersed in 1 mL of ether and sonicated for 2 hours.
Thin film and device fabrication
The ITO substrate was cleaned with deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and acetone ultrasonically for 45 minutes in turn, and then the cleaned substrate was blown dry with nitrogen. Subsequently, the substrate was cleaned with a UV ozone machine for 15 minutes. The electron transport layer was prepared by spin-coating the SnO2–KCl solution on a clean ITO substrate at 5500 rpm for 10 s. The coated ITO substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. After that, the samples were treated with a UV ozone cleaner at approximately 60 °C for 30 min. After cooling the prepared ITO/SnO2–KCl films to room temperature, the samples were placed in a nitrogen-filled glove box (O2 < 0.01 ppm, H2O < 0.01 ppm). The Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI, FAI, MAI, PbI2 and PbBr2 in a 8.5:1.5 (v/v) solvent mixture of DMF and DMSO at a molar ratio of 0.05:0.81:0.14:0.78:0.22. Then, the perovskite precursor solution was stirred for 12 h. After that, the precursor solution was spin-coated on the ITO/SnO2–KCl film in two steps at a slow speed of 1000 rpm for 4 s and a high speed of 4000 rpm for 11 s. A drop of the SnI2 ether dispersion was placed on the spinning substrate 5 seconds before the end of high-speed spinning as an anti-solvent. The films were then placed on a heating table for pre-annealing at 90 °C for 10 minutes and annealing at 120 °C for 10 minutes, and afterwards, cooled naturally for a few minutes. For the HTM layer, 22 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 4500 rpm per 20 s. Finally, the sample was thermally evaporated with about 80 nm of Au under high vacuum (5 × 10−4 Pa), and the effective area of the device is 0.04 cm−2.
Characterization and measurements
The X-ray diffractometry (XRD) pattern was captured by X-ray diffractometry (D8 Advance, Bruker Corporation). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7900F, Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Ltd). A Bruker Multimode 8 atomic force microscope was used for the atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient fluorescence spectra (TRPL) of the samples were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (Tau-3-P, HORIBA Jobin Yvon), where the samples were excited by an EPL 466 nm pulsed laser. The photoluminescence at 765 nm after photoexcitation was measured using the double exponential decay function I(t) = A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2 exp(−t/τ2), and the photoluminescence lifetime was obtained. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi UH4150 UV-vis spectrophotometer. J–V characteristics of the prepared solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2410 source meter (Cleveland, OH, USA) simulating air mass (AM) at 1.5 G illumination. The solar cells were measured in the forward (from −1.2 to 0.1 V) and reverse (from 0.1 to −1.2 V) modes at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The light intensity was calibrated with a NIST-certified silicon reference solar cell (Newport 532 ISO1599). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky (MS) measurements of solar cells were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua Device Company, China); the MS measurement range was 0.1–105 Hz, and the measured EIS data were fitted using Z-view software. The IPCE spectra were obtained by using a solar cell quantum efficiency test system (Qtest Station 500ADX, United States Dawn Technology Co., Ltd., USA).
