AbstractA series of oligomers constituting alternating thiophene and fluorenone residues, designed to evaluate the effect upon both electronic properties and packing of the moiety sequence in the light of donor–acceptor concept, were synthesised and studied by cyclic voltammetry, optical spectroscopy, and XRD investigations into crystals, films, and powders. Moreover, ab initio calculations, based on Density Functional Theory, were carried out on selected molecules. A clear indication of close-packing induction by fluorenone in the oligomers, together with the factors determining the electrical and optical properties, are derived and presented. In the light of the performance of selected compounds in prototypes of p-type FET devices and bulk heterojunction solar cells, some general indications of chemical structure requirements for applications such as photovoltaic cells are described.
1. Introduction
The role of oligomers and polymers based on fluorenone (F) and thiophene (T)/aromatic residues in optoelectronics has recently received attention in the literature.1–9 In summary, F-based polymers2 and copolymers3,4 display emission properties and have been considered in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with the possibility of emitting white light if blended with other molecules.5 More recently, the F moiety has been used as a minor component in blue-emitting copolymers6,7 and, when added in strictly controlled amounts, as a stabilizer against oxidation.8 In addition, non-linear optical properties of truxenone derivatives were recently reported,10 as well as V-shaped liquid-crystals,11 and a series of F-containing oligomers was tested with fullerene as a solar-cell-active material.12 Finally oligomers or polymers comprising the same residues have been reported as quite good candidates for p- and n-type organic field-effect transistor (OFET) materials, displaying significant electron and hole transport.13–16
Indeed, the F moiety has been often seen as an irregularity of polyfluorene chains – due to oxidation – resulting in a modified spectral response: namely it decreases its luminescence efficiency,17,18 yielding a green peak in the emission spectrum. In fact, the F moiety, in contrast to fluorene, is stable to oxidation and is capable of close-packing, resulting from H-bond interactions between adjacent molecules.19
Such a scenario clearly indicates that the optoelectronic properties would change depending on the sequence of F and T (or other) residues, raising the prospect of tailoring these materials towards different applications.
As predicted by detailed ab initio calculations20 and verified in many oligomeric arrangements,13,19,21–25crystal structures with an extended π-conjugated systems favor charge transport, particularly when strong H-interactions are established, via the enhancement of crystal packing factor (PF), being a reliable measure of closeness of packing arrangement. It is commonly established that, together with the chemical nature of the molecule, PF addresses both the molecular orientation with respect to the electrodes, induced at the substrate interface, and also crystal dimensions – and hence electric transport performances.13,19,21–26
This paper presents a series of T–F oligomers, illustrated in Scheme 1, some of which were previously used for the fabrication of p-type OFET devices.13,14 The considered molecules consist of the alternation of Tn (n = 1–6) (donor, D) and F (acceptor, A) moieties (according to the concept introduced by Havinga27 and subsequently developed by Curtis28) to tune the electronic energy levels, and thus determining stability, spectral window, and the materials used for the electrodes, the work function for which has to match the energy levels.20,21,24,29,30 In this respect, it is relevant to evaluate these electronic levels, i.e. by comparing ab initio calculations with experimental determinations such as electrochemical measurements.
 Scheme 1  The molecules prepared and studied. 
For these reasons, both the electrochemical properties (related to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on most D and A examples) and the packing in the molecule series were studied in order to tailor each molecule to a specific potential use, i.e. OFETs and solar cells. With this aim, we have characterized by cyclic voltammetry, FTIR, light absorption and emission spectroscopy, the oligomers and the corresponding polymers of the molecules that irreversibly oxidize.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on crystals, powders, and thin films and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization have been performed to shed light on the solid-state arrangement, which is related to charge transport capability. Finally, the electrical properties of p-type OFET devices, based on the oligomer examples reported here, and the optoelectronic property in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell based on an oligomer and a fullerene derivative, are considered in terms of the above-mentioned factors.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Chemistry
Different joinings of T and F units in the oligomers, as well as their number, strongly affect the chemical, electrochemical, and optical properties of the materials. Catalyzed couplings through organometallic compounds and electrosynthesis offer the possibility to prepare the molecules reported in Scheme 1. 2,7-(2-Thienyl)-9-fluorenone (TFT),13 2,7-di(5-n-hexyl-2,2′-bithienyl)fluoren-9-one (c-H2T2FT2)14 and 5,5′-(2,7-fluoren-9-onyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (FT2F)13 were prepared according to the literature. 2,7-Di(2,2′-bithienyl)-9-fluorenone (T2FT2) and 2,7-di(3-n-hexylthien-2-yl)fluoren-9-one (H2TFT) were obtained by Suzuki coupling of 2,7-dibromofluoren-9-one with 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan)-2,2′-bithiophene and 2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan)-3-n-hexylthiophene respectively. Monobromofluorenone reacted according to the standard coupling conditions for the preparation of (2,2′-bithien-5-yl)-9-fluorenone (T2F).
As reported in Scheme 2, to synthesize 2,7-di(3′,4′-di-n-hexyl-2,2′,5′,2′′-terthienyl)fluoren-9-one (H4T3FT3) the thiophene trimer 3′,4′-dihexyl-2,2′;5′,2′′-terthiophene was prepared in good yield (70%) by Stille coupling of 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dihexylthiophene and 2-tributylstannylthiophene.31 The reaction (via lithiation) of the terthiophene with 2-isopropoxy-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl)-1,3,2-dioxoborolane gave an intermediate that reacted immediately with 2,7-dibromofluoren-9-one using the Suzuki reaction, without any purification.

The reaction with 2-bromofluorenone gave the monomer H2T3F, which was dimerized by exhaustive electrolysis to H4FT6F in quantitative yield.32
2.2 Electrochemistry
The compounds were generally investigated in millimolar concentrations in acetonitrile + 0.1 M Bu4NClO4. Methylene chloride and chlorobenzene were used for H4T3FT3 and T2FT2 respectively for solubility reasons. Electrodeposited films were in all cases investigated in acetonitrile + 0.1 M Bu4NClO4. Electrochemical (CV peak at 0.1 Vs−1 or redox potentials) parameters for the investigated compounds and coupling products are summarized in Table 1. All the potentials quoted in this paper are referred to the Ag/Ag+ 0.1 M electrode.

The electrochemical behaviour can be to some extent anticipated by the known electrochemistry of the co-monomer units. The oxidation potentials of T, T2, and T3 are 1.73, 0.97 and 0.71 V33 respectively and that of F is 1.70 V.34 3-Methylthiophene, a representative 3-alkylsubstituted thiophene, shows an irreversible oxidation cyclic voltammogram (CV) peak at Ep = 1.46 V,35 so alkyl substitution makes the T ring electron-rich compared with F. From these values, it is clear that for 3-alkylthiophenes, T2, T3, and the fluorenone derivatives of Scheme 1, oxidation is localized at the thiophene moiety.
The molecules can be divided into three classes depending on the presence of capping groups.
 FT2F and c-H2T2FT2 are T-F compounds where two fluorenone residues are the outer moieties and both the bithien-2-yl residues are capped in the 5′-position. The CV of FT2F, i.e. the F-T2-F subunit, as a cast film shows reversible oxidation at the same E0 value (as average of forward and backward peak potentials) as for poly(TFT) (see below), as expected. The CV of c-H2T2FT2, i.e. the end-capped T2FT2 subunit, as a film shows a partially reversible oxidation process at a potential close to that of FT2F. If a thienyl ring terminates the molecular backbone, the radical cation will couple at the free 5-position, giving dimers (if only one 2-thienyl residue terminates the molecule) or polymers (two 2-thienyl end-groups).
The T2F molecule is expected to undertake a dimerisation to yield FT4F, not considered in Scheme 1 because it is completely insoluble. In fact, the CV of T2F indicates irreversible oxidation at 0.75 V, with dimer formation, and reversible reduction at −1.6 V.
The electrochemical dimerization of H2T3F to give H4FT6F and the electrochemistry together with other chemical characterizations (1H-NMR, FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, MALDI, elemental analysis) of the latter have been reported in ref. 32.
The CV traces of H2TFT, TFT, T2FT2, and H4T3FT3 monomers (not shown) indicate an irreversible oxidation process for anodic coupling at peak potentials of 0.99, 0.95, 0.66 and 0.66 V respectively. The absence of any lowering of the oxidation potential for the longest oligomer can be accounted for by the presence of the hexyl chains on the inner thiophene ring producing a twisting of the arms of the molecule, as described in ref. 36.
 Fig. 1 presents the cyclic voltammograms of the polymers obtained from TFT, H2TFT, T2FT2, and H4T3FT3. The oxidation of the considered polymers is anodically shifted to ca. 0.8, 0.95, 0.5 and 0.3 V respectively. Thus the trend of lower oxidation potential with longer T chains is retained in the polymer, with an additional reduction by 0.15–0.3 V from the potential of polymerization. In poly(H2TFT), this additional reduction does not exceed 0.05 V due to its only slight gain in conjugation, while in poly(FDOBT),37 obtained from the corresponding oligomer with the alkyl substitution on 4-position of thiophene ring, this additional reduction is maintained (see ESI†). Poly(H4T3FT3) shows the largest shift of oxidation potential, which can be related to a planarization of the 3′,4′-dihexyl-2:2′;5′:2′′-terthiophene residue in the polymer with respect to H4T3FT3 molecule, due to the blocking of the terminal T rings.

The CVs of all compounds in acetonitrile show a reversible one-electron reduction process due to the fluorenonyl moiety. The redox potential at ca. −1.45 V in the monomers is cathodically shifted to −1.60 V in the polymers, as a result of the electron donor properties of the oligothiophene moieties in the backbone. The specific electrochemistry of each molecule to give polymers is reported in the ESI,† together with the FTIR characterization of the polymers, which indicates an high degree of polymerization reached by electrosynthesis.
2.3 Optical characterization of monomers and polymers
In the compounds studied, appropriate setting up of units and side chains allows for direct control of the energy gap (Eg); in fact, the optical absorption can be tuned by modulating the planarity of these compounds. The electronic absorption spectra of oligomers in the solid-state and solution (CHCl3 or chlorobenzene depending on their solubility), shown in Fig. 2, display characteristic absorption bands, namely a more intense absorption maximum and a shoulder. The high energy peak is attributable to transitions from the thiophene-based valence band to its antibonding counterpart. The weaker band, often a shoulder, in the visible range (480–650 nm) has been extensively discussed in literature and is attributable to the n–π* transition in the carbonyl group of the F unit,1,4 or to an internal charge transfer band (ICT) due to the combination of the electron-donating thiophene blocks with an electron-withdrawing F central unit.12 In addition, unsubstituted molecules and those with only two end-chains display at higher energy a further excitonic band, indicating the formation of H aggregates even at concentration of 10−4–10−5 M. In contrast, the presence of the band due to the π–π* transition of the isolated molecule in spin-coated films is attributable to the disordered regions, and for this reason OFET device films are deposited by vacuum evaporation. Due to the presence of an indium thin oxide layer on a glass substrate, the profiles of absorption spectra of some monomer films (FT2F, H4FT6F, H4T3FT3) rise and those of all polymer films are cut off at around 300 nm.
 Fig. 2  Absorption (solid lines) and PL spectra (dashed lines) in solid-state (a) and solution (chloroform or chlorobenzene) of the molecules (b). 
For molecules with four alkyl chains H4T3FT3 and H4FT6F, the expected bathochromic shift of the absorption spectrum appears on going from solution to the solid state (bottom of Fig. 2a and b); moreover, the spectrum of the latter extends even into the visible part of the solar spectrum, indicating that they could be candidates for photovoltaic (PV) applications (see below).12
The Eg values for the monomers were evaluated from the electrochemical gaps (ΔE) and from optical data of the solution regarding the spectra band edge (EOPTg). A comparison between these two sets of data reported in Table 1 provides evidence for a substantial agreement.
The PL spectra of molecules in solution and as spin-coated films from chlorobenzene solutions (vacuum-sublimated in the case of the insoluble T2FT2 and FT2F) are also shown in Fig. 2. The PL quantum yield (QY) is rather low even in solution – 10% for TFT in THF and lower for all the other compounds. This is attributable both to the presence of F residue, which is low-emitting by itself, and to concentration quenching effects occurring once F and T units can interact electronically.6 The PLQY of films decreases further, which can likely be ascribed to the packing tendency of the oligomers through their π–π and CT interactions. Substitution with hexyl chains affects the PLQY, depending both on their number and position and on the thiophene position in the oligomer sequence. The distortion of adjacent thiophene rings, due to hexyl chains in the 3- or 4-positions, leads to a solid-state PLQY of 3% for H2TFT compound (the highest among the investigated compounds), while the backbone planarity, as in T2FT2, FT2F, and c-H2T2FT2 (chains in the 5-position), causes almost complete quenching of the emission. Details on peak position for absorption and emission spectra are reported in the ESI†.
The absorption spectra of the polymer films, reported in Fig. 3, show the same features of the corresponding monomer in the case of poly(H2TFT), while the spectra are shifted towards longer wavelengths for poly(TFT), poly(T2FT2) and poly(H4T3FT3) due to increased planarization of thiophene segments.
 Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of poly(H2TFT) (a), poly(TFT) (b), poly(T2FT2) (c) and poly(H4T3FT3) films (d). 
Only in the unique case of a soluble polymer, i.e.poly(H2TFT), is the EOPTg from the optical band edge of the solution spectrum close to the electrochemical one, while for other polymers the difference is significantly larger.
Due to the increasing number of interconnections in the polymeric films, a further strong decrease of the PLQY occurs with respect to the corresponding monomers, and the hence emission intensity is not detectable by the apparatus.
The PL maximum for poly(H4T3FT3) and poly(TFT) is the same (λmax at ca. 675 nm), independent of the number of thiophene rings, whereas it is blue-shifted for poly(H2TFT) (peak at 600 nm) due to the steric hindrance of the substitution pattern.
2.4 DFT calculations
 Ab initio calculations, especially in the frame of DFT, are useful in determining electronic properties; as a matter of fact, recent studies on F-based oligomers, as well as a series of oligomers based on 3,4-phenylenedioxythiophene, have been reported.4,19,30,38 We adopted similar procedures, in order to shed light on chemical stability and extent of delocalization, and to compare it with electrochemical and spectroscopic data. The four molecules investigated, namely TFT, T2F, T2FT2 and FT2F, represent typical alternation of D and A moieties.28
Calculations were carried out using the B3LYP hybrid density functional: we tried various basis sets, starting from a plain 3-21G, up to 6-311G-supplemented with polarization functions and diffuse function on electronegative atoms (S and O).
Geometries in agreement with X-ray data were used as a starting point for energy minimizations; the latter were carried out in vacuum. Constrained geometries were also tested, in order to ensure that the backbone remained essentially planar. In Table 2, the results of calculations of the differences between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are reported and compared with EOPTg values in both film and solution, since the calculations refer to an isolated molecule, while device performances are obviously determined on thin films. We found the the values of both series show a trend fully consistent with both the electrochemical and optical investigations. In Fig. 4, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for the four molecules are shown.

It is evident that for the TFT the HOMO density is equally distributed all along the molecule (Fig. 4a), as is also observable for T2FT2 (Fig. 4e), while for T2F (Fig. 4c) the density is essentially confined onto the T residues. On the other hand, in FT2F (Fig. 4g) the electronic density is more concentrated on the inner part. As expected, the LUMO orbitals follow a different trend, namely that the F moiety has high electron density in all the cases (Fig. 4b, d, f and h), only in FT2F does the T segment display some electron density.
Noticeably, both HOMO and LUMO electron density contours are consistently comparable with those of the F-containing oligomers reported in ref. 9 and 38. Moreover, the CV results (see above) completely agree with the reported observations, i.e. the electron density contours map the ease of radical formation and subsequent evolution. In this view, TFT and T2FT2 oligomers undergo polymerization, while T2F evolves into dimer FT4F; in contrast, FT2F is stable towards oxidation.
2.5 Structural and morphological characterizations
Understanding the solid-state arrangement is necessary to investigate the structure/orientation of molecules in thin films of devices. In particular, packing closeness can be checked due to knowledge of the unit cell parameters allowing one to perform PF calculations reliably.25 XRD crystal structures of selected molecules were investigated as single crystals (TFT) or as powders (FT2F, c-H2T2FT2, H4FT6F).13,14,26,36 All display close packing, thanks to the strong fluorenone-H interactions (see packing reported in Fig. 5). For the molecules for which the structure was not solved, detailed molecular modelling calculations using Material Studio package39 were carried out and combined with XRD on thin films, reliably indicating the molecular orientation in the active layers of prototype of devices.
 Fig. 5  Crystal packing of TFT, FT2F, and c-H2T2FT2 oligomers. The black line indicates H-interactions involving the carboxyl moiety. 
It is worth comparing the packing of TFT, FT2F, c-H2T2FT2 oligomers (Fig. 5) with that of 2,7-bis(4-(tert-butylthio)phenyl)fluorenone crystal (DSFO),19 where the formation of H-bonds clearly induces the dimer packing, and hence the excimer formation, resulting in its notable emission properties.
In TFT crystals (see ORTEP view in ESI†) the molecules pack in pairs linked by H-bonds (0.245 nm); other contacts involving H (S–H, 0.271 nm) between adjacent pairs complete the close packing, recalling that of DSFO (H-bond 0.254 nm). However, in DSFO the other interactions connecting dimers are clearly looser, in fact the density is lower (1.24 g cm−3versus 1.45 g cm−3). Therefore, in DSFO excimer formation favors emission, while in TFT, due to large PF value (∼0.73) the luminescence is largely quenched.
A different situation occurs in the crystal structure of FT2F, where strong H-interactions are present (0.26 nm), but where dimer formation is not observed. The packing can be described as two inverse sequences of single molecules essentially overlapping along the short a axis.
Similar packing is found in c-H2T2FT2, where an alternating sequence of molecules interact by short H-bonds (0.235–0.241 nm), along the short c axis; however, the other contacts are a bit looser, approaching the sum of the Van der Waals radii.
In spite of the close packing observed, none of the structures investigated support the excimer formation being different from that for crystals of DSFO,19 fully justifying the observed poor emission properties (see optical characterization).
Thin-film arrangements were next studied directly in the device prototypes. Fig. 6 reports the XRD spectrum of film into OFET device of six typical molecules: TFT, T2F, and T2FT2 (Fig. 6a) and H4T3FT3, c-H2T2FT2, and FT2F (Fig. 6b). The experimental film thicknesses range from 25 nm to 100 nm.
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of oligomer films, with the thickness in parenthesis: (a) top TFT (30 nm), middle T2F (42 nm), and bottom T2FT2 (100 nm); (b) top H4T3FT3 (25 nm), middle c-H2T2FT2 (40 nm), and bottom FT2F (50 nm). The intensities are slightly shifted for clarity. 
Detailed analyses of the profiles give the following relevant information:
– in the TFT spectrum, four [100] directions are detected, the one at largest 2θ° being attributed to the substrate.
– in the T2F spectrum, two medium axis directions (0.91 nm) are detected.
– in the T2FT2 case, up to eight long axis directions (4.4 nm) are observable.
– in the H4T3FT3 film, three non-commensurate peaks are detected, i.e. three different orientations.
– in the c-H2T2FT2 film, two [100] directions are observed.14
– in the FT2F film, four peaks are detected, the [100] direction being prevalent, and the remaining three being sums of other crystallographic directions26 (2–4 reflections), namely [001], [202], and [113].26
By combining XRD analysis with molecular modeling,39 approximate angles between molecular axis and orientations direction can be derived, and the results are summarized in Table 3. As a result, in both the case of card-pack (TFT) and herringbone arrangements (c-H2T2FT2), shown in Fig. 5, the angle between the molecular axis and the substrate plane (α) is crucial to understand the electrical properties.

For the T2FT2 molecule, whatever structural motif is adopted the α value is over 60°, whereas for the T2F oligomer the value is close to 30°. A particular case is presented by FT2F molecule, whose XRD pattern displays peaks comprising the combination of different reflections, irrespective of the kind of deposition adopted (e.g. high-vacuum evaporation or spin-coating), implying multiple molecular orientations in the films.26 However, in all the orientations, except for [001], for which the weight is ∼0.12, the α value ranges from 15° to 30°. H4T3FT3 adopts three different orientations, likely due to the position of the alkyl chains. As the length of the molecule’s conjugated backbone is close to 3.0 nm, the orientation of the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface has to be ruled out.
In summary, when the molecule comprises a sequence of F and T residues without substituents, the molecular orientation is approximately edge-on, i.e. the average molecular axis forms with the substrate plane an angle greater than 60°, unless the molecule is asymmetric and relatively short (T2F). In contrast, when alkyl chains are present, the situation is modified according to the substitution site; namely, if the chains are end-capping the molecule, the orientation is again edge-on, while substitution at the 3,4-positions of the thiophene rings implies a multiple orientation that is partly edge-on, with the alkyl chains pointing alternately upwards or towards the substrate.
Finally, the semi-crystalline H4FT6F adopts an approximate edge-on orientation of the backbone with side-chains separating adjacent molecules, yielding relatively loose packing.36
AFM investigations into OFET devices based on three typical molecules are reported here as examples in order to verify the crystal interconnections. In Fig. 7 three topographic images of T2FT2, T2F, and c-H2T2FT2 films (thickness 40–50 nm) obtained by high-vacuum evaporation, are shown for comparison. The roughness as well as the interconnections among crystals are different in the three cases:
– in the T2FT2 device, efficient interconnection is detected (Fig. 7a).
– in the T2F film, some voids are evident due to a larger aggregate size (Fig. 7b).
– in the optimised layer c-H2T2FT2,14 the interconnection is guaranteed and the roughness is strongly reduced (Fig. 7c).
These observations are in agreement with OFET device results (see below).

2.6 Potential applications
2.6.1 OFET device measurements. Many of the reported molecules were next tested as active layers in p-type devices, with the aim of putting forward a relation between chemical constitution and performance of un-optimized devices. In Table 4 relevant results from molecules displaying closest packing are presented. The mobility and Ion/off values were derived from output characteristic I–V curves reported in the ESI†, according to the procedure described in the Experimental section and in ref. 14.

The generally low values of both mobility and Ion/off ratios can be accounted for by coupling the surface/structural investigations with electrochemical and optical data, and DFT calculations. In fact, the best value of the OFET performances in p-type devices is achieved in the case of a stable molecule, well oriented with respect to the electrode and with compact morphology (c-H2T2FT2), while the worst results are found in the case of the well oriented but T-terminated molecule (irreversible oxidation process) (TFT), or in the case of molecular multiple orientations (FT2F); while intermediate values are reached in case of incomplete substrate coverage (T2F), i.e. bad crystal interconnections. Hence the crucial effects dominating the FET functioning are definitely mapped. In the light of the above results, the approach followed by Curtis,28i.e. D and A parts in the molecule, seems to be rather restrictive for deciding which compounds to choose for FET applications; in fact, the possibility of oxidation, the packing interactions, and the substrate influence contribute to determine the appropriate choice. Indeed, a recent review by Roncali29 strongly supports this observation.

2.6.2 Solar cell evaluation. The potential use of the compounds studied in BHJ solar cells deserves careful evaluation of their electronic levels. In fact, choosing the typical acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM),40 in principle all could be considered as candidates because their HOMO level values range from 4.95 eV to 5.72 eV (for H4FT6F and H2TFT respectively). However, their harvesting capability (see absorption spectra above), coupled with their processability, limits the choice of compounds to either H4T3FT3 or H4FT6F, provided that the compatibility of blends with PCBM or other acceptor molecules allows for homogeneous film fabrication. As the latter molecule better fits such a requirement, BHJ devices based on H4FT6F were tested with PCBM in a 1:1 ratio by weight (see the Experimental section for details). For a series of un-optimized devices, the results reported in Table 5 were obtained, i.e. a power conversion efficiency close to 0.8% was achieved. Comparison with Demadrille’s results12 concerning a series of T- and F-containing oligomers reveals that long Tn sequence molecules display the best performances. The I–V curve together with absorption spectrum of the device is presented in Fig. 8.

3. Conclusions
A careful study has been performed on fluorenone-containing oligomers, designed to achieve an effect on the electronic and optical properties from alternating T and F residues and the presence and position of alkyl chains. The electrochemical data, which are in agreement with optical characterizations, have been corroborated by DFT calculations on four examples. These also afforded orbital maps that enabled us to understand both the chemical stability and the behaviour in FET devices. Structural analyses, fully in agreement with the other characterisation data, were carried out on single crystals and powders, allowing for the determination of molecular orientations in thin films. The findings clearly explain the performances in OFETs, taking into account the effective close-packing induced by fluorenone. In addition, some chemical structure markers enabling us to identify structures suitable for FET or solar cell fabrication have been pinpointed. Namely, alkyl substitution on the thiophene rings, which enables processability, only results in close-packing if placed at the 2- and 5-positions (end chains), while positioning the fluorenone at the end of an oligomer permits reversible oxidation. Finally, long T-sequences only can supply adequate light harvesting by extending absorption towards the red region.
In summary, the F residue, when inserted as end-capper in the oligomers, results in close-packing formation and chemical stability.

4.3 Apparatus and procedures
4.3.1 General electrochemistry. The compounds were generally investigated in acetonitrile + 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 (conc. ∼10−3 M). Methylene chloride and chlorobenzene were used for H4T3FT3 and T2FT2 respectively for solubility reasons. Electrodeposited films were in all cases investigated in acetonitrile + 0.1 M Bu4NClO4.Electrochemical experiments were performed at room temperature under nitrogen in three-electrode cells. The counter-electrode was platinum; the reference electrode was silver//0.1 M silver perchlorate in acetonitrile (0.34 V vs. SCE). The voltammetric apparatus (AMEL, Italy) included a 551 potentiostat modulated by a 568 programmable function generator and coupled to a 731 digital integrator. The working electrode for cyclic voltammetry was a platinum minidisc electrode (0.003 cm2). For electronic spectroscopy, a 0.8 × 2.5 cm indium–tin oxide (ITO) sheet (resistance ca. 20 ohm per square, from Merck) was used.

4.3.2 Molecular characterizations. FTIR spectra were taken on a Perkin Elmer 2000 FTIR spectrometer. The spectra of films were taken in reflection–absorption mode.Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were obtained by an Ultraflex II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) operating in the both positive reflection and linear modes, using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix.
Gas-phase mass determination was carried out using Agilent Technologies 7890A GC System coupled with an Agilent Technologies 5975C VL MSD with triple-axis mass detector.
Optical absorption measurements for both solutions and films were performed with a Lambda 900 Perkin-Elmer spectrometer. For solution spectra, CHCl3 and chlorobenzene were used depending on the oligomer solubility, for this reason all spectra start from 300 nm. CW photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a SPEX 270 M monochromator equipped with a N2-cooled CCD detector, by exciting with a monochromated Xe lamp. Solution PL quantum yield (QY) measurements were performed using a quinine sulfate solution (10−4 M sulfuric acid) as reference (QY = 54.6%) and exciting at 350 nm (QY = 54.6%). Solid-state PLQY was carried out using an integrating sphere.42

4.3.3 Structural and morphological analyses. XRD experiments were carried out using an Enraf Nonius CAD4 instrument for single-crystal analysis (for details see Table 6), while films and powder were examined using a computer-controlled Siemens D-500 diffractometer equipped with Soller slits and an Anton–Paar camera for variable-temperature experiments under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Morphological characterizations was performed using a commercial AFM NT-MDT apparatus in non-contact force modulation mode. Both height images and phase images were taken at the same time.

4.3.4 Calculations. All ab initio computations were done with Gaussian0343 with DFT, using the three-parameter hybrid functional B3LYP.44–46 Graphical representations of the electron orbitals were obtained with MOLEKEL.47,48Molecular modelling calculations, crystal structure resolution, and packing energy minimization were performed using the Materials Studio package, release 4.0, developed by Accelrys.39

4.3.5 Device preparation and measurements. OFET devices in a bottom-contact architecture were prepared by high-vacuum evaporation of the active layer, as described in ref. 14. The final pressure was 10−7 mbar, while the growth rate ranged from 0.1 to 0.15 Å s−1, and the holder temperature was kept at 100 °C, to avoid partial re-evaporation of the compound.The mobilities have been extracted from transfer characteristic curves in the saturation region, fitting with the standard quadratic expression: ISD = K(VG − VT)2 where K = ½μCoxW/L, where μ is the carrier mobility, Cox (130 nm SiO2) the capacitance per unit surface, W (15 mm) and L (3, 6, 12 μm) the width and length of the device respectively, and VT the threshold voltage. The measurements were performed in vacuum (below 10−5 mbar).
The structure of bulk-heterojunction solar cells investigated in this work was indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-blend-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/H4FT6F:PCBM (1:1 wt)/LiF/Al. On the top of pre-cleaned ITO substrates a 50 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated, and subsequently substrates were baked at 100 °C for 10 min in ambient atmosphere. Then, an active layer of the solar cells was spin-coated (in glove-box) from chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Afterwards, onto the active layer, LiF and Al electrodes were thermally evaporated using vacuum deposition system at a pressure of ∼2 × 10−6 mbar. The thickness of the top electrical contacts were ≈ 0.8 nm and ≈ 100 nm, respectively, while the thickness of active layer ranged from 80 to 100 nm (by AFM determination). The average area of the devices was 4.5 mm2. Before photovoltaic characterisation, the devices were thermally annealed at 70 °C for 5 min on a calibrated hotplate in a glove-box.
