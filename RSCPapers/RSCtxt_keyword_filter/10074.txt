    , Accepted 25th June 2018First published on 25th June 2018AbstractIn this work, segmented silver nanowires (AgNWs) with an average diameter of 60 nm have been successfully synthesized by a typical polyol method without any templates and seeds. The synthesized segmented AgNWs were strongly dependent on the reaction temperature and time. It was found from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction measurements that the connection node of segmented AgNWs was in the form of a twinned crystal. We speculated that these segmented AgNWs were possibly derived from end-to-end self-connection and self-concrescence of two neighbouring Ag nanorods or nanowires at a suitable reaction temperature and time, which is further confirmed by the secondary growth of AgNWs. In addition, segmented AgNWs were blended into hole transporting layers to enhance the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) by utilizing their localized surface plasmon resonance and optical scattering effects. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of PSCs with segmented AgNWs increased from 2.81% and 8.99 mA cm−2 to 3.30% and 9.95 mA cm−2, respectively.
Introduction
Metallic silver has excellent electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity in all metals and meanwhile its nanomaterials have some unique and superior physical and chemical properties compared with their bulk materials.1,2 Recently, silver nanowires (AgNWs) have attracted considerable attention not only due to their inherent anisotropic growth mechanism and superior surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity,3,4 but also due to their potential applications in the field of electronic components,5 optical components,6 catalysts,7 biomedical,8 flexible wearable devices9 and polymer solar cells (PSCs).10–12 The potential for utilizing AgNWs as a replacement for ITO in thin-film solar cells,13–16 light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),17–19 and large-area touch screens20–23 provides an exciting opportunity to specifically synthesize AgNWs with dimensions that optimize their properties for a given application. Besides, it has been reported that AgNWs used in biosensors can improve the density of the induced current, accelerate the electron transfer rate and further enhance the sensitivity.24
At present, methods for synthesizing AgNWs are more and more diversified, including a polyol method,25–27 microwave-assisted method,28–30 hydrothermal method,31,32 electrochemical method,33,34 and template method.35,36 Lined AgNWs can be generally prepared easily with a great deal of literature studies reported. However, there were rare reports on segmented AgNWs. Tsuji et al. reported the angled AgNWs obtained by the two-step microwave polyol method with Pt seeds as catalysts.37 Jiang et al. have predicted the growth of V-shaped AgNWs by two possible means: (i) crystal lattice match-induced end-to-end or end-to-side fusion of two nanowires and (ii) twinned crystal plane-induced growth.38 Lai et al. have thought that the reaction temperature and PVP concentration played an important role in the formation of angled silver/silver homojunction nanowires (Ag/Ag HNWs) and found that the Ag/Ag HNWs had the largest SERS enhancement because they possessed most tips or “hot spots” compared with lined AgNWs and spherical Ag nanoparticles.39 However, large-scale growth of long segmented AgNWs is a big challenge. In addition, there has been no report on using segmented AgNWs to enhance the performance of PSCs.
In this paper, we utilized the polyol method without any templates and seeds to synthesize segmented AgNWs by well-controlling the reaction temperature and time. Ends of two neighbouring Ag nanorods or nanowires are self-connected into segmented AgNWs, which is further confirmed by the secondary growth of AgNWs. In addition, the segmented AgNWs had novel localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties, which were very different from lined AgNWs. As a result, enhancement of the device performance of PSCs has been realized by segmented AgNWs blended into hole transporting layers (HTLs).
Experimental section
1. Synthesis of AgNWs
Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.9999%), ethylene glycol (EG, 98%), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99%), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 360000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. We use the typical polyol method to synthesize AgNWs. EG was used as both a solvent and a reducing agent, PVP served as a surface capping agent, NaCl acted as a control agent, and AgNO3 was used as a precursor. In a typical synthesis procedure, a stock solution of PVP was prepared by dissolving 0.4 g PVP in 10 mL of EG in a three-neck round-bottom flask. 0.34 g AgNO3 and 0.058 g NaCl were dissolved in 5 mL EG, respectively. After all of the materials were completely dissolved by magnetic stirring at room temperature, the AgNO3 solution in EG and the NaCl solution in EG were both added into the PVP solution in EG, sequentially. Then it further formed a homogeneous solution by magnetic stirring. The reaction flask was transferred into an oil bath at 130 °C and argon was bubbled into the flask, stirring for several minutes at first and then eliminated. After two and a half hour reaction, the flask was moved out from an oil bath and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Acetone and ethanol were used to wash the precipitate with a centrifugation of 4000 rpm for 3 min, and this procedure was repeated two times to remove the excess EG and PVP. The final products were then dispersed into isopropanol and stored at room temperature for further characterization.
2. Preparation of devices
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were bought from Luminescence Technology Corp. ZnO nanoparticles and PEDOT:PSS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Heraeus, respectively. In this work, PSCs have structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS:AgNWs/P3HT:PC61BM/ZnO/Al, where AgNWs are lined AgNWs or segmented AgNWs with a 12% weight ratio in PEDOT:PSS. The ITO glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol sequentially for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS:AgNWs were spin-coated on the precleaned and O2-plasma-treated ITO substrates at 2000 rpm and then were heated at 150 °C for 30 min to remove residual water. All the samples were moved into a glove box filled with nitrogen to fabricate the subsequent multilayer film processes. The photoactive layers of P3HT:PC61BM were deposited on top of PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS:AgNWs from a solution with a P3HT:PC61BM ratio of 1:0.8 (P3HT concentration of 12 mg mL−1) in a chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 vol%) mixed solvent at 800 rpm for 50 s. The fresh P3HT:PC61BM blend films were put into a glass Petri dish to undergo solvent annealing for 6 h. Then, ZnO nanocrystals (in ethanol, 20 mg mL−1) were spin-coated on top of P3HT:PC61BM blend films at 2000 rpm for 50 s and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. Finally, the samples were moved into an evaporation chamber under vacuum (4 × 10−4 Pa) to deposit 100 nm Al as a cathode.
3. Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS Ultra 55) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100 HR) were used to characterize the morphology and lattice fringes of AgNWs. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 voltage and current source meter in the dark and under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G using a solar simulator (Oriel model 91160). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a HP 8453A UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent, USA). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Horiba FluoroMax-4 Spectrofluorometer.
Results and discussion
AgNWs were synthesized by the polyol reduction of AgNO3 with EG in the presence of PVP and NaCl serving as a capping agent and control agent, respectively. It is well-known that the reaction temperature has an important effect on the morphology of AgNWs by the polyol method. Fig. 1(a)–(c) show the SEM images of the products obtained at 120 °C, 130 °C, and 140 °C, respectively, for 2.5 hours while other conditions were kept as constants during the reaction process. It can be observed clearly from the SEM images that the morphologies of AgNWs were significantly different at different temperatures. No nanowires but only large size nanoparticles were formed at a low reaction temperature of 120 °C (Fig. 1(a)) and the corresponding diameter was about 300 nm, which were actually AgCl colloids as observed from XRD patterns (Fig. 2). When the reaction temperature increased from 120 °C to 130 °C, the segmented AgNWs besides lined AgNWs were observed (Fig. 1(b)). The segmented AgNWs consisted of one, two or more bent angles with an average diameter of about 60 nm and the corresponding lengths reached several and even tens of micrometers. Fig. 1(d) shows the angular distribution of the segmented AgNWs. Interestingly, most angles of segmented AgNWs were obtuse angles in the range of 105° to 165°, which could be perhaps due to their smaller steric hindrance relative to the formation of the acute or right angles. The lined AgNWs were only obtained with diameters of about 60 nm when the temperature increased to 140 °C (Fig. 1(c)).

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the corresponding products at different reaction temperatures. At a reaction temperature of 130 °C or 140 °C, the segmented AgNWs or lined AgNWs presented the same diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38.0°, 44.5°, 64.2°, 77.6°, and 81.5°, which come from the diffraction of (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of Ag (JCPDS: 04-0783), respectively. The intensity of (111) peaks of segmented AgNWs and lined AgNWs both showed a higher value than other diffraction peaks, indicating that the segmented AgNWs have a similar (111) crystalline plane growth trend to the lined AgNWs. However, the sample at a low reaction temperature of 120 °C exhibited different diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27.8°, 32.2°, 46.2°, 54.8°, 57.5° and so on, which should be attributed to the diffraction peaks of (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of AgCl (JDPDS: 31-1238). This indicates that Ag+ cannot be reduced to a silver monomer by EG when the reaction temperature is as low as 120 °C.
To further investigate the effects of the reaction time on the morphology of products, a series of experiments with varying reaction times at 130 °C were carried out. Fig. 3(a)–(d) show the SEM images of the products synthesized at reaction times of 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 1.5 h, and 2.0 h. It can be clearly observed from all images that the amount of segmented AgNWs increased with increasing reaction time. At the initial stage (0.5 h), only a few nanowires were formed and most products were AgCl colloids due to the reaction of Cl anions with Ag cations (Fig. 3(a)). AgCl could be used as a buffer, continuously releasing Ag+ into the reaction solution.32,40 With an increase in reaction time, the amount and size of AgCl colloids reduced and the lined AgNWs began to form (Fig. 3(b)). The products began to appear as segmented AgNWs when the reaction time increased to 1.5 h. As the reaction time further extended to 2.0 h (Fig. 3(d)) and 2.5 h (Fig. 1(b)), the segmented AgNWs occupied a large proportion and at the same time the AgCl colloid particles eventually disappeared, which completely grew into segmented AgNWs.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of AgNWs synthesized at a reaction temperature of 130 °C with different reaction times: (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1 h, (c) 1.5 h, and (d) 2 h. 
Based on the above results, we speculated that these segmented AgNWs should be derived from end-to-end self-connection and self-concrescence of two neighbouring Ag nanorods or nanowires at an appropriate reaction temperature and time. Some reports have also mentioned the formation processes of segmented AgNW structures.38,39,41 Huang et al. thought that there were higher potential energies for the surface atoms of AgNW ends and so these surface atoms diffused rapidly to reduce the surface chemical potential when two silver nanowire ends come close.42 Therefore, at a reaction temperature of 130 °C, and the reaction initial stage, the products were lined AgNWs. As the reaction time increased, the amount of Ag nonorods or nanowires increased and so the chance of end-to-end contact of Ag nonorods or nanowires became larger, resulting in the formation of many segmented AgNWs after 2.5 h at 130 °C. However, when the reaction temperature increased to 140 °C, the movement of the Ag nonorods or nanowires will become violent due to Brownian movement,43 and the contact between the nanorods or nanowires became difficult, thus leading to the formation of only lined AgNWs without segmented AgNWs. Therefore, the reaction temperature and time can well-control the products.
The UV-vis absorbance spectra of the products at different reaction periods are shown in Fig. 4. At the initial stage of the reaction (0.5 h), most products were AgCl colloids and so there were almost no characteristic absorption peaks. With an increase in reaction time, the products with reaction times of 1.0 h, 1.5 h, 2.0 h, and 2.5 h have two peaks appearing at 352/418 nm, 350/379 nm, 349/387 nm, and 348/384 nm, respectively, which became more obvious and gradually enhanced. The two surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks should be attributed to the quadrupole resonance excitation (the weaker peak) and the transverse plasmon resonance (the stronger peak) of the AgNWs.44 The weaker peak almost remained in the same position for different reaction times while the stronger peak was slowly blue-shifted. The corresponding absorption band tended to be much narrower. These indicate that the Ag nanoparticles were completely reducing with the increase of the reaction time, which was in accordance with the SEM morphology changes of the products at different reaction times (Fig. 3(a)–(d) and 1(b)). The colour of the products varied from purple to light gray and then dark gray due to the shape-dependent SPR absorption (inset of Fig. 4).

Further structure characterization of the segmented AgNWs was carried out with HRTEM and SEAD investigations. Fig. 5(a) displays a typical segmented AgNW of the as-fabricated products with a bent angle of about 150°. The SAED patterns were recorded from the middle area (marked as a yellow dot rectangle section) and the joint area (marked as a red dot rectangle section) as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a), and the middle part exhibited a single crystalline-like cubic diffraction spot scattering pattern, which indicated that the middle part of the segmented AgNWs has a perfect single crystalline characteristic. However, the SAED pattern of the connection area shows that there may be an overlay of two or more sets of diffraction spots of Ag, indicating that the connection part has twinned crystalline content. Moreover, lattice stripes could be clearly observed from the HRTEM image (Fig. 5(b)), the lattice spacings on both sides of the junction are 0.235 nm and 0.236 nm, respectively, corresponding to the {111} planes of bulk Ag (0.2354 nm). These results further illustrated that the segmented AgNWs could be formed by end-to-end self-connection of two neighbouring nanorods or nanowires.

To further understand the formation of segmented AgNWs, a secondary growth procedure was designed and performed. Firstly, the lined AgNWs synthesized at a reaction temperature of 140 °C (Fig. 1(c)) were centrifuged and then dispersed into the EG solution again. Secondly, the EG mixture solution of AgNO3, NaCl and PVP was added into the EG solution of lined AgNWs and then kept stirring for a few minutes to receive a homogeneous solution. Finally, the EG mixture solution of lined AgNWs, AgNO3, NaCl and PVP was divided into four equal parts and then transferred into an oil bath to continue to react at a reaction temperature of 120 °C, 130 °C, 140 °C, or 150 °C for 1 h, respectively. It is to be explored whether the lined AgNWs would continue to form the segmented AgNWs in the silver source with sufficient circumstances and whether the reaction temperature was a key factor. Fig. 6 shows that the SEM images of the products were obtained by the secondary growth procedure. It can be found that when the reaction temperature was as low as 120 °C, great aggregations of AgCl colloids were dominated in the final products with a small amount of lined AgNWs embedded (Fig. 6(a)). With the increase of the reaction temperature, the AgCl colloids gradually reduced and the segmented AgNWs grew (Fig. 6(b and c)). Compared with the initial AgNWs, the diameter of the corresponding segmented AgNWs increased, which led to easy accumulation of silver atoms in the {100} facets of AgNWs and their growth again due to the incomplete coating of PVP. However, when the reaction temperature reached 150 °C, the morphology of the products became irregular (Fig. 6(d)) and the amount of the segmented AgNWs reduced. This result further exhibited that the reaction temperature had a great influence on the growth of the segmented AgNWs.

Similarly, the crystallographic structure of an individual segmented AgNW obtained by the secondary growth process was characterized using HRTEM and SAED. Fig. 7(a) shows a segmented AgNW with a bent angle of 115°. The SEAD patterns of the middle and joint area of the corresponding segmented AgNWs are shown in the insets. The diffraction pattern of the middle and connection areas of the segmented AgNWs obtained by the secondary growth is much similar to that of the segmented AgNWs at a reaction temperature of 130 °C (Fig. 5), and the lattice spacings on both sides of the junction are about 0.234 nm and 0.232 nm, respectively (Fig. 7(b)), roughly corresponding to the {111} planes of bulk Ag (0.2354 nm), indicating that the segmented AgNWs could be obtained through the secondary growth of lined AgNWs at a suitable reaction temperature and time.

Based on the above discussions, we draw a schematic diagram to illustrate the growth process of segmented AgNWs, as shown in Fig. 8. When all the chemical reagents were mixed together, white AgCl colloids were immediately obtained due to the presence of Ag+ and Cl−. At the initial stage of the reaction, a large amount of Ag monomers was obtained by the reduction of Ag+ while silver chloride began to constantly release Ag+ into the reaction solution. Then as the Ag monomers grew into pentagonal twinned seeds, the side surfaces ({100} facets) were passivated by PVP, resulting in the deposition of silver atoms on the {111} facets and thus forming a one-dimensional nanostructure.45 With the increase of reaction time, there were enough lined AgNWs in the reaction solution. For the nanorods or nanowires, there were generally higher potential energies for the end atoms. When the ends of these nanorods or nanowires came close, the end surface atoms easily diffused into the opposite side to reduce the surface chemical potential, resulting in the end-to-end self-connection of silver nanorods or nanowires. At the same time, silver atoms gradually filled their junctions, eventually resulting in the formation of segmented AgNWs. On the other hand, it was difficult to achieve an end-to-side self-connection because the side surfaces were covered with a layer of PVP.

Recently, metal nanowires have been used to enhance light harvesting of PSCs due to LSPR and optical scattering effects.10–12 The segmented AgNWs possess much more tips or “hot spots” than the lined AgNWs,39 which would be helpful to enhance the performance of PSCs. Here, lined AgNWs or segmented AgNWs were blended into PEDOT:PSS as HTLs. The corresponding PSC structure is ITO/HTL/P3HT:PC61BM/ZnO/Al. Fig. 9 exhibits the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs based on AgNW(12 wt%):PEDOT:PSS as HTL under the illumination of AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic properties of open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding PSCs are summarized in Table 1. It can be observed that the AgNWs blended into PEDOT:PSS can enhance the device performance. The Jsc and PCE increased from 8.99 ± 0.83 mA cm−2 and 2.81 ± 0.33% for pure PEDOT:PSS to 9.15 ± 0.70 mA cm−2 and 2.88 ± 0.18% for lined AgNWs and 9.95 ± 0.36 mA cm−2 and 3.30 ± 0.10% for segmented AgNWs, respectively. The Voc remained the same while the value of FF showed a slight increase for segmented AgNWs.

The PSC with segmented AgNWs had a better device performance than lined AgNWs because it possessed most tips or “hot spots”, which increased the electric fields in the active layer by scattering effects and excited LSPR.46 To further explain the enhancement performance of PSCs, photoluminescence (PL) measurements of P3HT were carried out. Fig. 10 shows the PL spectra of P3HT in the bilayer of PEDOT:PSS/P3HT and AgNW(12 wt%):PEDOT:PSS/P3HT. The PL intensity of P3HT increased after incorporating the AgNWs into PEDOT:PSS. We noted that the PL intensity of P3HT with segmented AgNWs was larger than that with lined AgNWs and pure PEDOT:PSS. The UV-vis absorbance intensity of P3HT:PC61BM in the bilayer of PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM and AgNW(12 wt%):PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM is displayed in Fig. 11. The absorbance intensity of photoactive layers in the bilayer structures showed a similar increase to the PL of P3HT in the order: PEDOT:PSS < lined AgNWs < segmented AgNWs. The change in PL and absorbance spectra was in good agreement with the device results of the corresponding PSCs. AgNWs incorporated into PEDOT:PSS enhanced the photogenerated excitons in P3HT and the light absorbance of the P3HT:PC61BM photoactive layer due to LPSR and optical scattering effects. On the other hand, the segmented AgNWs possess much more tips or “hot spots” than the lined AgNWs, thus showing the largest PL and absorbance intensity. As a result, PSC based segmented AgNWs exhibited the best photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized segmented AgNWs with an average diameter of about 60 nm by the polyol method. The reaction route was very simple without any seed and template. The reaction temperature and time have an important effect on the formation of the segmented AgNWs. The segmented AgNWs should be attributed to end-to-end self-connection of two neighbouring Ag nanorods or nanowires at an appropriate reaction temperature and time. The secondary growth process further explained the growth mechanism. The segmented AgNWs possess many more special ends, which can enhance the LPRS and optical scattering effect. As a consequence, the PSCs based on segmented AgNWs blended into PEDOT:PSS showed higher Jsc and PCE than lined AgNWs. Our results demonstrate that these segmented AgNWs will be promising candidates to enhance the performance of PSCs.
