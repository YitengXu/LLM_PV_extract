    , Accepted 4th November 2013First published on 4th November 2013AbstractDegradation of perovskite has been a big problem in all-solid-state perovskite solar cells, although many researchers mainly focus on the high efficiency of these solar cells. This paper studies the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 films and finds that CH3NH3PbI3 is sensitive to moisture. The degradation reaction is proposed according to UV-Vis spectra and XRD results. In order to improve the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3, we introduce aluminum oxide as a post-modification material into all-solid-state perovskite solar cells for the first time. UV-Vis spectra show that Al2O3 modification could maintain the absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 after degradation. XRD results reveal that Al2O3 could protect perovskite from degradation. Moreover, the device post-modified by Al2O3 has shown more brilliant stability than that without modification when exposed to moisture. EIS results and dark current illustrate that the modification increased interface resistance in the dark, indicating the restrained electron recombination process.
1 Introduction
Inorganic–organic perovskite compounds (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Br and Cl) have attracted attention as light-harvesting materials for solar cells.1–5 These compounds are advantageous for solar cells because of their wide light-absorption and high extinction coefficients.6–9 Moreover, solar cells based on these compounds could achieve high efficiency and low-cost.2,10
Nowadays, there are two kinds of solar cells based on inorganic–organic perovskite compounds: liquid state solar cells and all-solid-state solar cells. Liquid state solar cells based on perovskite compounds were first reported by Kojima and co-workers.11 They used CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite as a sensitizer and iodine redox as an electrolyte in photovoltaic cells, and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.81%. Then Nam-Gyu Park fabricated CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite sensitized solar cells with the final PCE of 6.54% by optimizing the CH3NH3PbI3 solution concentration.12 However, due to rapid dissolution in the I−/I3− electrolyte, the stability of these cells was so poor that perovskites can hardly be applied to the most efficient liquid-cell-structure.13 In our former work, Al2O3 was used to protect the perovskite sensitizer from corrosion by an electrolyte and the efficiency was increased from 3.56% to 6.12%.14 On the other hand, the inorganic–organic hybrid lead halide perovskite compounds have been used in solid-state DSCs achieving high performance and good stability.1,3,10,15–17 All solid state perovskite solar cells with spiro-MeOTAD can be divided into two categories. One is the p–i–n junction solar cells which is reported by Henry Snaith and his co-workers.6 They employed Al2O3 as a scaffold to support perovskites and spiro-MeOTAD, perovskites and thin TiO2 formed the p–i–n junction. Another all solid state perovskite solar cells is sensitized solar cells which is the same mechanism with dye sensitized solar cells. All-solid-state perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized solar cells with spiro-MeOTAD as hole transport materials have achieved a PCE of up to 9.7%.3 Hui-Seon Kim used the TiO2 nanorod as a photoanode and achieved a PCE of 9.4%.15 Jun Hong Noh demonstrated highly efficient solar cells exhibiting 12.3% in PCE as a result of tunable composition for CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3.10 Recently, Grätzel and co-workers described a sequential deposition method for the controlled formation of CH3NH3PbI3 and achieved the highest PCE of 15.0% in perovskite-sensitized solar cells.18
Based on the present research in perovskite solar cells, researchers mainly focus on the high performance by utilizing different structures of photoanodes, fabrication methods and different ratios of sensitizers and different kinds of hole transport materials. However, the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 and the sensitized film is often ignored, which hampers the prospects for practical applications.
The perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films are extremely sensitive to moisture in air. Grätzel and co-workers found that the device fabrication should be carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions and with a humidity of <1%.18 In our experiments, we also found a similar phenomenon that perovskite films tend to degrade in a high humidity environment. Hence, the stability of perovskite under moisture urgently needs to be studied. This paper systematically studies the corrosion of perovskite by moisture and the mechanisms of corrosion are also revealed. In order to improve the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 and the sensitized film, we introduce aluminum oxide as a post-modification material to separate perovskites from moisture.
In this work, we employ Al2O3 as a post-modification material in CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized solar cells containing spiro-MeOTAD as hole transport materials (HTMs). There are two roles for Al2O3 in these cells. One is that Al2O3 protects CH3NH3PbI3 and the sensitized films from degradation by moisture and sunlight. Another is that Al2O3 serves as an insulation barrier between TiO2 and HTM to retard the electron recombination process. Finally, the photo-conversion efficiency of the devices with post-modification by Al2O3 has shown more stable performance in moisture. This article systematically discussed the post-modification effect in all-solid-state DSCs for the first time and opens up a new pathway to improve the performance of all-solid-state solar cells.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials synthesis
CH3NH3I was synthesized and purified based on the method proposed by Im J. H. To prepare perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, the synthesized CH3NH3I (0.395 g) and PbI2 (1.157 g, Aldrich) were mixed in γ-butyrolactone (2 mL, TCI) at 60 °C for 12 h with stirring. The nanocrystalline TiO2 colloid was synthesized by a hydrothermal method which has been well documented in a previous report.19
2.2 Solar cell fabrication
The compact TiO2 layer precursor was prepared as follows:20 titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, 1 mL) was mixed with 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 5 mL) and ethanolamine (H2NCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99+%, 0.5 mL) and heated to 80 °C for 2 h under magnetic stirring. Then the cleaned FTO glasses were coated with the precursor by the spin-coating method at 3000 rpm for 30 s in air. Then the substrate was heated to 80 °C for 10 min and 500 °C for 30 min. Mesoporous TiO2 films with a thickness of 717 nm (determined by SEM shown in Fig. S1†) were deposited on the substrate by a spin-coating TiO2 paste at 3000 rpm for 30 s, which was followed by heating at 500 °C for 1 h. The perovskite coating solution was spread on the annealed TiO2 film and spun at 2000 rpm for 60 s followed by 3000 rpm for 60 s in air. Then the films were heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The room temperature films were immersed into 30 mM triethylaluminum (Alfa, Al(C2H5)3 25% w/w in hexane) hexane solution for 30 seconds which was conducted in a glove box.
The composition of the hole transport material (HTM) was 180 mg 2,29,7,79-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,99-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), 37.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich)/acetonitrile (170 mg mL−1) and 17.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich) in the solvent of 1 mL chlorobenzene (99.8%, Aldrich). The CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized TiO2 films were coated with HTM solution using the spin-coating method at 3000 rpm for 30 s. For the counter electrode, a 50 nm thick Au was deposited on the top of the HTM over layer by a thermal evaporation. The active area was fixed at 0.09 cm2.
2.3 Characterization
The UV-Vis absorption spectra were used for testing the absorption of perovskite sensitized TiO2 films with a Hitachi U-3010 spectroscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Smart LAB instrument Cu Kα beam (λ = 1.54 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a PHI 5300ESCA instrument. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS, ranged from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz) were measured by using a ZAHNER CIMPS electrochemical workstation, Germany.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Degradation of perovskites and the protecting effect of Al2O3
Al2O3 is obtained by dip-coating into triethylaluminum in hexane (see ESI for details†). As shown in Fig. 1, after dip-coating, a new peak located at 532.3 eV appeared in the O 1s spectrum. O 1s in Al(OH)3 shows a binding energy of 531.68 eV.21 Then the new peak is the same with O 1s in Al2O3 rather than Al(OH)3.22 This could verify that the dip-coating method leads to the formation of an Al2O3 layer.
 Fig. 1  XPS spectrum of the films before and after post-modification by Al2O3: (a) O 1s; (b) Al 2p. 
For degradation studies, sensitized films were exposed to air with a humidity of 60% at 35 °C under sunlight for 18 h. Fig. 2(a) shows UV-Vis spectra of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film before and after degradation. Before degradation, the main absorption is due to CH3NH3PbI3. However, after degradation, the absorption of the film between 530 nm and 800 nm decreased sharply. The residual absorption less than 520 nm is assigned to PbI2 (band gap is 2.6 eV). This phenomenon verifies that CH3NH3PbI3 is very sensitive to moisture and the moisture could corrode CH3NH3PbI3 into PbI2.

For the film after post-modified by Al2O3, the main absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 is maintained after degradation. The reason is that CH3NH3PbI3 is well protected and the absorption of the film decreases less than that without modification. The Al2O3 layer separates CH3NH3PbI3 from air and prevents degradation of the film.
Then X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization (Fig. 3) is used to study the degradation process and Al2O3 protecting effect. XRD spectra of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Al2O3 before degradation are the same. The same XRD patterns before and after modification indicate the same crystalline structure assignable to the perovskite system. The peaks at 31.86, 40.45 and 43.14° are attributed to the (310), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure with a = 8.872 Å and c = 12.637 Å, which is consistent with the previous reports.16 The other peaks are assigned to FTO. Post-modification by Al2O3 does not influence the diffraction peaks obviously.

XRD spectra of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film before and after degradation are shown in Fig. 3(a). After degradation, the original peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 all disappeared, indicating that CH3NH3PbI3 has degraded into other chemicals. Moreover, new peaks located at 34.3, 39.5 and 52.4° appeared, which can be assigned to (102), (110) and (004) planes of hexagonal 2H polytype PbI2 (PDF#07-0235). Another new peak at 38.7° is assigned to the (201) plane of orthorhombic I2 (PDF#05-0558). This could be explained that when exposed to air, CH3NH3PbI3 will be corroded by moisture and the final products of the degradation process contain PbI2 and I2.
In contrast, for the film of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Al2O3 (Fig. 3(b)), the peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 remain unchanged after degradation and no new peaks appears. This could be explained by the fact that the Al2O3 layer could separate CH3NH3PbI3 from moisture and the degradation is suppressed.
Considering UV-Vis spectra, XRD analysis and the circumstance of air and sunlight, the degradation process could be explained as follows: (1) CH3NH3I(aq) ⇌ CH3NH2(aq) + HI(aq)(2) 4HI(aq) + O2 ⇌ 2I2(s) + 2H2O(3-1) (3-2)
In reaction (1), CH3NH3PbI3 will decompose into CH3NH3I solution and PbI2 in the presence of H2O. In this process, the equilibrium constant can be expressed as k(1) = c(CH3NH3I) and the Gibbs free energy is ΔG(1) = −RTlnk(1).
In reaction (2), CH3NH3I solution will decompose into CH3NH2 solution and HI solution. Then the equilibrium constant is k(2) = c(CH3NH2) × c(HI)/c(CH3NH3I) and Gibbs free energy is ΔG(2) = −RTlnk(1).
In reaction (3), there are two ways for HI to react. (3-1) represents the redox reaction. The equilibrium constant is k(3 − 1) = 1/p(O2) × c(HI), and the standard Gibbs free energy can be calculated as follows:ΔG(3 − 1) = 2ΔfGθm(I2) + 2ΔfGθm(H2O) − 4ΔfGθm(HI) − ΔfGθm(O2) = 0 + 2(−237.129) − 4 × 1.70 − 0 = −481.058 kJ mol−1,the negative standard Gibbs free energy indicates that reaction (3-1) can move forward easily. (3-2) represents the photochemical reaction. HI can easily decompose into H2 and I2 under light conditions.
According to Le Chatelier's principle, the degradation process is easy to move forward. Steps (3-1) and (3-2) are important for the whole degradation process. In order to verify that humidity is essential for the whole degradation process, we conducted the experiments of degradation of CH3NH3I. After exposure to air and UV radiation (Fig. 4), the white powder turned brown, which is the color of I2. The same sample exposed to an argon atmosphere or without UV radiation did not turn brown. This phenomenon indicates during step (3), air and sunlight are necessary for the degradation process. Then CH3NH3PbI3 will degrade and the final solid-state products leaving the films are PbI2 and I2, which is consistent with the UV-Vis spectra and XRD results.

3.2 Photovoltage performance of solar cells with Al2O3 post-modification
For solar cell fabrication, CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized TiO2 films were spin coated with a HTM layer (spiro-MeOTAD), followed by thermal evaporation of a Au layer as the counter electrode. Fig. S2(a)† shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the photovoltaic device and Fig. S2(b)† shows the schematic illustration of devices with post-modification by Al2O3. The HTM layer of spiro-MeOTAD works just like I3−/I− electrolytes in liquid dye sensitized solar cells, which could reduce the oxidized state of sensitizers.23 After device fabrication, the J–V characterization was conducted immediately to avoid the influence of moisture (Fig. 5 and Table 1). After modification, the short-circuit current (Jsc) is decreased a little from 13.66 mA cm−2 to 11.11 mA cm−2, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is largely increased from 0.71 V to 0.86 V. The final power conversion efficiency (PCE) is similar, from 4.69% to 4.60%. The increase in Voc is attributed to the suppressed charge recombination between TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD, which is verified by the dark current test and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) under dark conditions. The small decrease in Jsc is caused by the insulation effect of Al2O3, which hampers the electron transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD interface.

However, when the film was exposed to moisture, the protecting effect of Al2O3 makes the first appearance. As shown in Fig. 6, the efficiency of the devices is decreased when exposed to moisture. After 18 h of exposure to moisture, the device without modification achieves only 0.942% power conversion efficiency, which is only 20% of the original PCE without degradation. CH3NH3PbI3 undergoes a corrosion process and degrades into PbI2 and I2 as verified by UV-Vis and XRD results. After 18 h of exposure to moisture, the device with post-modification achieves 2.23%, which is 48% of the original PCE without degradation. The stability test shows that the Al2O3 layer is helpful for the device performance. The reason is that post-modification by Al2O3 could separate CH3NH3PbI3 from moisture physically and the degradation is suppressed.

3.3 Suppressing recombination and improved electron transfer by Al2O3
Another problem for all-solid-state perovskite solar cells is that perovskite compounds could hardly cover the surface of the TiO2 photoanode totally.12,15 We also found a similar phenomenon that there are uncovered sites on TiO2 (Fig. S1(e) and (f)†). The uncovered sites on TiO2 particles could be in contact with hole transport materials directly, resulting in electron recombination from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to hole transport materials, which is similar to liquid dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Post-modification at the TiO2/electrolyte interface is a useful method to suppress charge recombination in liquid DSCs and quasi-solid DSCs.24–26 Grätzel used 4-tert-butylpyridine as the modification agent to suppress electron recombination in DSCs.24 Wide-gap inorganic materials such as Al2O3 (ref. 27 and 28), ZnS29,30 and TBAI31 have also proved to be effective for retarding electron recombination. However, the post-modification in all-solid-state perovskite solar cells has never been reported.
The EIS under dark conditions is shown in Fig. 7(a). The inset in Fig. 7(a) is the equivalent circuit employed to fit the spectra.15Rs is related to the interface resistance of the FTO electrode, R1 is the interface resistance of the counter electrode, and C1 is its capacitance. R2 and C2 are the interface resistance and capacitance of the TiO2/sensitizer/HTM interface. In the Nyquist plots, the main arc in Fig. 7(a) is caused by the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD interface, which is a combination of the recombination resistance (R2) and the chemical capacitance of the film (C2). After post-modification, the recombination resistance is increased from 187.0 ohm to 424.9 ohm. The increased interface resistance will retard back reaction from the TiO2 conductive band to spiro-MeOTAD. The dark current measurement is shown in Fig. 7(b). After modification by Al2O3, we find that the dark current is greatly decreased because of the insulting barriers for electron recombination. Voc could be determined by the formula below:32  where Isc is the short-circuit current, I0 is the dark current, m is the ideality factor, and R and F are the ideal gas and Faraday constants, respectively. From the formula, Voc will increase with decreasing I0, which is consistent with the J–V curves under light and dark current measurement.
 Fig. 7  (a) Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices in the dark. (b) Current density–voltage curve characteristics in the dark. 
The retarded back reaction is due to the whole cover of Al2O3 on TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3. Then the direct contact between TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD is successfully avoided. The wide-band Al2O3 could prevent electrons in TiO2 from recombining with spiro-MeOTAD, as shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Schematic energy level diagrams of the device with post-modification by Al2O3. 
To enhance the stability, encapsulation of the device can also work to protect the device in solar cells.33 However, post-modification by Al2O3 serves two roles in this kind of solar cells. One is to protect perovskites from degradation and another is to suppress the interface electron recombination, which has been approved by EIS and dark current results.
4 Conclusion
In conclusion, post-modification has been introduced into all-solid-state hybrid solar cells for the first time. The Al2O3 layer could act as an insulator barrier to protect CH3NH3PbI3 from degradation by moisture and suppress electron recombination between TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD. Finally, the device post-modified by Al2O3 has shown more brilliant stability than that without modification when exposed to moisture. We found that CH3NH3PbI3 could degrade in the presence of moisture and sunlight and Al2O3 could successfully protect CH3NH3PbI3, which is verified by UV-Vis spectra and XRD results. The restrained electron recombination is caused by the coverage of Al2O3 on TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3, which is verified by the decreased dark current and increased interface resistance in the dark. This article systematically discusses the post-modification effect in all-solid-state DSCs and opens up a new pathway to improve the performance of all-solid-state solar cells.
