    , Accepted 12th April 2013First published on 17th April 2013AbstractBy spin-coating a surfactant layer, glycerol monostearate (GMS) atop poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) film, a PEDOT:PSS/surfactant bilayer film was prepared facilely for the first time and applied as the transparent anode for high-efficiency ITO-free bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell (BHJ-PSC) devices. A significant improvement of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films (from ∼1 S cm−1 to more than 1000 S cm−1) was achieved by GMS modification and the highest conductivity reaches 1019 S cm−1 for Clevios PH 1000 under an optimized spin-coating speed of GMS layer. The Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer film exhibits a sheet resistance of 98 Ω sq−1 and a transparency of around 80% in the visible range, which are comparable to those of ITO, fulfilling its function as the transparent anode. The conductivity improvement by GMS modification is proposed to result from the GMS-induced segregation of PSS chains and the conformational change of the conductive PEDOT chains within PEDOT:PSS. While the highly hydrophobic –(CH2)16CH3 groups of GMS preferentially interact with the hydrophobic PEDOT of PEDOT:PSS, the highly hydrophilic –COOCH2–CHOH–CH2OH groups preferentially interact with the hydrophilic PSS chains with the hydroxyl groups playing an important role on the consequent phase separation between PEDOT and PSS chains. Using Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer films as the transparent anodes replacing ITO, high-efficiency ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices based on poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (PCDTBT:PC71BM) and thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):PC71BM systems exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 5.90% and 7.06%, respectively, which are comparable to the corresponding devices based on the traditional ITO anode.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting more and more attention due to their great promise as light-weight, flexible and cost-efficient renewable energy sources. For the state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC device, indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most popularly used transparent anode material for the conventional BHJ-PSC devices, which however suffers from several serious disadvantages such as limited indium sources, unsuitability for flexible electronic devices due to its high mechanical brittleness, and high preparation costs. Herein we report a new and facile approach of modifying PEDOT:PSS film by spin-coating a surfactant layer, glycerol monostearate (GMS), atop a PEDOT:PSS film, enabling the PEDOT:PSS/surfactant bilayer film. A significant improvement of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films (from ∼1 S cm−1 to more than 1000 S cm−1) was achieved by GMS modification and the highest conductivity reaches 1019 S cm−1 for Clevios PH 1000 under optimized spin-coating speed of GMS layer. The PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer film was successfully applied as the transparent anode for high-efficiency ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices, as a result comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to the corresponding traditional ITO-based devices was achieved and the highest PCE reaches 7.06%, which is the highest one for ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices reported up to now.

1 Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting more and more attention due to their great promise as light-weight, flexible and cost-efficient renewable energy sources.1 For PSCs with a conventional bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device structure, power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 8% has been achieved owing to the advance on the synthesis of novel polymer donors, nanoscale morphology control, processing optimization and device structure optimization.2,3 The device architecture of BHJ-PSCs usually comprises of electrodes and active layers, and in most cases additional electrode buffer layers need to be incorporated to facilitate the charge carrier transport and collection.2–7 Particularly, for the state-of-the-art BHJ-PSC device, besides efficient charge carrier collection, at least one electrode should be transparent in order to harvest light. At present, indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most popularly used transparent electrode material for the anode in the conventional BHJ-PSC devices, which however suffers from several serious disadvantages such as the limited indium sources, unsuitability for flexible electronic devices due to its high mechanical brittleness, and high preparation costs involved in sputtering, evaporation, pulsed laser deposition and electroplating etc.8,9 Moreover, in terms of the energetic cost, ITO has been evaluated to be responsible for more than 50% of the materials energy content and almost 45% of the energetic cost associated to the lab-scale process of fabrication.10,11 Therefore, it is urgently desirable to replace ITO with new transparent conductive materials. Stimulated by such a practical need, in recent years some conductive materials including conducting polymers,12–17 carbon nanotubes,18–21 graphenes,22–25 metal nanowires,26–28 and metal grids29 have been successfully applied as the alternative anodes for ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices. Among them, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (see inset of Fig. 1 for its chemical structure) has been extensively studied due to its high transparency in the visible light spectrum, easy aqueous solution processing, and applicability for flexible devices despite problems such as acidity, hygroscopy and sensitivity to oxygen exposure,30–34 Note that, however, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film spin-coated from the aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution usually has a conductivity lower than 1 S cm−1, which is dramatically lower than that of ITO (>4000 S cm−1). Thus, to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films is the prerequisite for their application as the transparent anode of BHJ-PSC devices. So far two major strategies have been employed towards improving the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films. One is to dope the aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution with organic compounds such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), D-sorbitol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ionic liquid, anionic surfactant, dimethyl sulfate etc.35–43 Another effort has been devoted to treat the PEDOT:PSS films with polar organic compounds, salts, zwitterions, carboxylic or inorganic acids, cosolvent or sulfuric acids (H2SO4).44–51 The highest conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films obtained up to now reached 3065 S cm−1 as reported by Ouyang et al. very recently by using a H2SO4 treatment method. As a result, the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) BHJ-PSC device with the treated PEDOT:PSS anode showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.56%, which was comparable to that of an ITO-based device.51 Despite these extensive efforts leading to the significant improvement of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films, note that, however, such treated PEDOT:PSS anodes were mostly based on high-conductivity grade PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH 1000) and the as-fabricated ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices were typically based on P3HT:PC61BM, and the highest PCE reported by now is 4.30%.13 Besides, in some of those reported treatment methods, complicated processes such as immersing PEDOT:PSS films into solvent or spin-coating the PEDOT:PSS solution for many times were generally required, which is unfavorable for the practical large-scale device production.

Herein, we report a new and facile approach of modifying PEDOT:PSS film by spin-coating a surfactant layer, glycerol monostearate (GMS, the chemical structure is shown in the inset of Fig. 1), atop PEDOT:PSS film, affording a PEDOT:PSS/surfactant bilayer anode, which exhibits a significant improvement in the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films (from ∼1 S cm−1 to more than 1000 S cm−1). Even though such a conductivity improvement is much lower than the highest conductivity enhancement reported in literature, the ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices based on this method show comparable PCEs to the ITO-based devices. Furthermore, this method is verified in several different active layers and PEDOT:PSS with a different conductivity grade, leading to the highest PCE of 7.06% and demonstrating the universality of our new bilayer approach.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation and characterization of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films
PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (Clevios P and Clevios PH 1000) were purchased from Heraeus Ltd. with a PEDOT:PSS concentration of 1.3% by weight and the weight ratio of PSS to PEDOT was 2.5:1.52 Glycerol monostearate (GMS, C21H42O4, ≥99%) was purchased from SCM Industrial Chemical Co. Ltd. Glass substrates of area 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 were cleaned by subsequent ultrasonication in acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol and then dried in an oven. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P and Clevios PH 1000) filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on glass substrates which were treated by oxygen plasma cleaning for 4 min prior to spin coating. The obtained films (thickness ∼70 to 80 nm) were annealed on a hot plate in the ambient atmosphere at 150 °C for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films were performed by spin-coating GMS solution in methanol (1 mg ml−1) on the dried PEDOT:PSS films at different spin-coating speeds for 60 s. Then the bilayer films were dried at 120 °C for 10 min in glove box.
Sheet resistances of PEDOT:PSS films and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayers were measured by using a four point probe setup with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400). The thickness of the films was measured by a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer. Transmittance was obtained using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The SEM images were obtained using on a scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL-6700F). AFM measurements were carried out on a Veeco DI-MultiMode V scanning probe microscope using tapping mode.
2.2 Fabrication of BHJ-PSC devices
Our detailed fabrication procedure of the ITO-based P3HT:PC61BM BHJ-PSC devices has been reported previously.5–7 P3HT was bought from Luminescence Technology Corp. and used as received. For ITO-based devices, 40 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P and Clevios PH 1000) anode buffer layers were spin-casted on the ITO substrate, then dried in the ambient atmosphere at 150 °C for 15 min. For ITO-free devices, Clevios P/GMS and Clevios PH 1000/GMS were used as anodes. The P3HT:PC61BM (1:0.8 by weight) active blend layer with a thickness of 80 nm was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution at 800 rpm for 60 s. The Al electrode (100 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (∼2 × 5 mm2). Finally, thermal annealing was carried out at 150 °C for 10 min inside a glove box. The PCE was measured under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA), whose illumination intensity was calibrated by a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150V, with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
The fabrication procedure of the ITO-based PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM BHJ-PSC devices follows the method reported previously,2,3 which is slightly different to that for P3HT:PCBM devices. PCDTBT and PTB7 were purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada) and used as received. For ITO-based devices, 40 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P Al4083, Clevios P and Clevios PH 1000) films were spin-casted onto the ITO substrate, then dried in the ambient atmosphere at 150 °C for 15 min. For ITO-free devices, Clevios P/GMS and Clevios PH 1000/GMS were used as anodes. The PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4 by weight) active blend layer with a thickness of 80 nm was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution at 1600 rpm for 40 s. The PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5 by weight) active blend layer, with a nominal thickness of 80 nm, was prepared by spin-coating a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene–1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume) solution at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The cathode interlayer material PFN was dissolved in highly polar solvents such as methanol under the presence of small amount of acetic acid and its solution was spin-coated onto the top of the obtained active layer to form a thin interlayer of 5 nm.2,3 Al electrode (100 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (∼2 × 8 mm2). The PCEs of the PSCs were measured under an AM1.5G solar simulator (Model 91192, Oriel, USA). The light intensity was calibrated before the device testing using a standard silicon solar cell, giving a value of 51 ± 2 mW cm−2.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Electrical and optical properties of PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films
In this study two types of PEDOT:PSS were used: one is Clevios PH 1000 (high-conductivity grade) which has been commonly used for ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices in literature;49–51 another type of PEDOT:PSS raw material, namely Clevios P (moderate conductivity grade) with larger size of the swollen gel particles was also studied for comparison.52 The as-prepared PEDOT:PSS films (∼70 to 80 nm) on glass substrates from Clevios PH 1000 and Clevios P aqueous solutions had a conductivity of 1.09 and 0.41 S cm−1, respectively. Modification of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P or Clevios PH 1000) films by GMS was performed by spin-coating GMS solution in methanol onto the dried PEDOT:PSS films, followed by drying at 120 °C for 10 min in a glove box. Fig. 1 presents the conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films prepared by spin-coating GMS solution at different speeds onto different PEDOT:PSS films, and the characteristic data is summarized in ESI-Table S1.† Clearly, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer film is around one thousand times higher than that of the corresponding PEDOT:PSS film, with the maximum conductivity reaching 1019 and 364 S cm−1 for Clevios PH 1000 and Clevios P, respectively. The corresponding sheet resistance of Clevios PH 1000/GMS and Clevios P/GMS bilayer film is 98 and 275 Ω sq−1, respectively, which is on the same order of magnitude with that of ITO. Interestingly, the effect of GMS layer on the conductivity improvement of PEDOT:PSS film is sensitively dependent on its spin-coating speed, and the optimized spin-coating speed of GMS layer is 1000 and 800 rpm for Clevios PH 1000 and Clevios P, respectively. Under such optimized spin-coating speed of GMS layer, the thickness of GMS layer was determined to be ∼9 and 15 nm for Clevios PH 1000 and Clevios P, respectively, which was obtained by directly subtracting the sum of the thickness of PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer with that of the single PEDOT:PSS layer measured by a KLA-Tencor P6 surface profilometer (see ESI-Fig. S1†). These results suggest that the influence of GMS on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS depends not only on the thickness of the GMS layer but also on the microstructure of PEDOT:PSS since Clevios PH 1000 and Clevios P have different sizes of the swollen gel particles.52
Since the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer film is to be used as the anode of BHJ-PSC device replacing ITO, its transparency is a vital and determinative factor for the device performance. Fig. 2 shows the transmittance spectra of different PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayers in the visible range which includes also that of ITO for comparison. The transmittances of Clevios P/GMS, Clevios PH 1000/GMS, and ITO are 81%, 82%, and 83% at 550 nm, respectively. Obviously, in the wavelength region below 540 nm, the transmittances of PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayers are even higher than that of ITO, which become lower in the wavelength above 540 nm. Noteworthy, the transmittances of the pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films are almost identical at the same level of around 80%, even in the thicker Clevios PH 1000/GMS film, revealing that GMS hardly affects the transparency of the PEDOT:PSS film. Given that GMS is almost colorless, the optical absorption of the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer film is mainly determined by PEDOT:PSS, or rather, the PEDOT-to-PSS ratio in the film. Thus, it can be presumed that the PEDOT-to-PSS ratio in PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer film does not change upon the spin-coating of the upper GMS layer, which is further discussed below.

Insets show the enlarged spectra in the region of 400–700 nm and compare the transmittances of ITO (1), Clevios P (2), Clevios PH 1000 (3), Clevios P/GMS (4) and Clevios PH 1000/GMS (5). 
3.2 Conductivity improvement mechanism of PEDOT:PSS film by GMS modification
To investigate the effect of GMS on the PEDOT:PSS film, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films in order to probe the inner compositional changes of the film surfaces. Shown in Fig. 3 is the S(2p) XPS spectra of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films. In the S(2p) XPS spectra of PEDOT:PSS films, two signal bands were observed, and the band between 166 and 172 eV is assigned to the signal from the sulfur atoms of PSS whereas another band between 162 and 166 eV with doublet peaks is attributed to the sulfur atoms of PEDOT.42,53 To rationalize the compositional change of the PEDOT and PSS components after GMS modification, we calculated the peak areas of the S(2p) features of the PEDOT and PSS chains, and found that the PEDOT-to-PSS ratios of Clevios PH 1000 and Clevios P films are almost the same (0.41) while the PEDOT-to-PSS ratio of Clevios P/GMS and Clevios PH 1000/GMS is 0.43 and 0.42, respectively, which are both slightly higher than those of the pristine ones without GMS modification (see ESI-Table S2†). These results suggest that the PSS component was slightly washed out of the surface of PEDOT:PSS films by GMS solution during the spin-coating process while a significant removal of the PSS component from PEDOT:PSS mixture seems unlikely. Interestingly, this phenomenon is essentially different from the previous reports in which some PSS chains were obviously removed from PEDOT:PSS films after treatment such as the “dip” method as deduced from the dramatic increase of the PEDOT-to-PSS ratio.49–51 Besides, it should be noted that the S(2p) signal intensities of both PEDOT and PSS components apparently decrease in PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films compared to those in the corresponding pristine PEDOT:PSS films. This is mainly because XPS is routinely used to determine elements which are present within the top 1–12 nm of the sample surface, while within the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films the upper GMS layer may block the S(2p) signals of PEDOT and PSS. Indeed, besides to the evidence on the increase of the thickness after incorporating GMS layer as discussed above, the existence of the upper GMS layer on the surface of PEDOT:PSS layer is further confirmed by the comparative analysis of C(1s) XPS spectra of PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer and pristine PEDOT:PSS films, revealing the appearance of a new signal at 288.8 eV correlated to the CO bonds of GMS molecules (see ESI-Fig. S2†).
 Fig. 3  The S(2p) XPS spectra of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films. 
The surface morphologies of PEDOT:PSS films before and after GMS modification were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surfaces of the films of both Clevios PH 1000 and Clevios P are quite smooth according to the SEM images (see ESI-Fig. S3†). In contrast, upon the incorporation of GMS layer, clearly the surfaces of both Clevios PH 1000/GMS and Clevios P/GMS bilayer films become rougher and there is an additional layer composed of aggregations of several microns on the Clevios PH 1000 (Clevios P) layer (see ESI-Fig. S3†). Given that the existence of the upper GMS layer on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer has been confirmed above, the aggregations can be unambiguously attributed to the GMS molecules.
In order to further unveil the morphology change upon the incorporation of GMS layer and its possible correlation with the conductivity improvement, AFM images of the pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films were measured in both tapping and phase modes. As seen from the AFM height images (Fig. 4I), both PEDOT:PSS films (images a and c) and PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayers (images b and d) have quite smooth surfaces, but the surfaces of the latter ones are much rougher than those of the former as revealed by the increase of the measured root-mean-square (rms) roughness of Clevios P/GMS and Clevios PH 1000/GMS films (1.04 and 1.21 nm, respectively) compared to those of Clevios P and Clevios PH 1000 (0.75 and 1.02 nm, respectively). Moreover, while the pristine PEDOT:PSS films mainly consist of separated polymeric domains with a size of tens of nanometers, upon GMS modification such polymer domains tend to interconnect each other, resulting in the formation of an interpenetrating network in the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films. Naturally, for the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films such an interpenetrating network structure may provide better percolating pathways for the charge carrier hopping among polymer chains, thus leading to the higher conductivity compared to the unmodified PEDOT:PSS films.13,50
 Fig. 4  AFM height (I) and phase (II) images of Clevios P (a and e), Clevios P/GMS (b and f), Clevios PH 1000 (c and g), and Clevios PH 1000/GMS (d and h) films. 
With respect to the phase images (Fig. 4II), PEDOT:PSS films (images e and g) show the indistinct microphase separation structures consistent with those obtained from the height images. This phenomenon is generally explained by the commonly accepted opinion that the surface of PEDOT:PSS film contains more PSS than the bulk.14 In contrast, PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films (images f and h) exhibit the discernible microphase separation structures, in which bright and dark regions are clearly observed. Because GMS molecules tend to form aggregations of several microns as seen from the SEM image (see Fig. S3†), the bright and dark regions observed in the AFM phase images of PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films should not be due to the GMS layer otherwise there would be only one phase without any contrast in the AFM phase image. Therefore, the bright regions as the hard phase may be attributed to PEDOT domains, whereas the dark regions denote the soft segments that arise from the excess PSS domains. These results suggest that the GMS layer induces a phase separation featured by the segregation of the excess PSS domains surrounded by a continuous PEDOT phase. Similar to the conclusion made from the above AFM height image, the continuous PEDOT domains serve as better percolating pathways that result in higher conductivity.15,54
On the basis of the above XPS, SEM, and AFM results which unveil that, upon the incorporation of GMS layer, the excess PSS domains within PEDOT:PSS tend to aggregate while simultaneously the PEDOT domains form a continuous interpenetrating network, a schematic model of the conformational change of PEDOT:PSS mixture is proposed in Scheme 1 and used to account for the conductivity improvement by GMS. For the pristine PEDOT:PSS mixture, it is well known that the PEDOT and PSS chains are entangled by static interactions.40,50,55 When GMS in methanol is spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS film, due to the swelling effect of methanol, GMS molecules may diffuse into the PEDOT:PSS film. Then the hydrophobic –(CH2)16CH3 group of GMS preferentially interact with the hydrophobic PEDOT chains, whereas the hydrophilic –COOCH2–CHOH–CH2OH group of GMS preferentially interact with the hydrophilic PSS chains of PEDOT:PSS, leading to the separation of the PEDOT chains from the PSS chains (see Scheme 1). As a result the Coulombic attraction between PEDOT and PSS is weakened and phase separation between the hydrophobic PEDOT and hydrophilic PSS chains occurs. Furthermore, GMS molecules can readily segregate from the PEDOT:PSS mixture during the drying and the annealing processes due to their facile self-assembly ability as reported popularly in the polymer industry.56,57 Eventually, GMS molecules aggregate with several microns on PEDOT:PSS surface to form the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer structure. Based on this model, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film consists of grains with a hydrophobic and highly conductive PEDOT-rich core and a hydrophilic insulating PSS-rich shell. The interactions between GMS and PEDOT:PSS could facilitate the phase separation between the PEDOT and PSS chains and enable the reorientation of the PEDOT chains by getting away from the PSS chains' coils, allowing more inter-chain interactions among the PEDOT components. Thus, the energy barrier for inter-chain and inter-domain charge hopping would be lowered and charge transfer among the PEDOT chains would become easier, leading to a tremendous enhancement of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film.58 Previously, Ouyang et al. reported that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film prepared from the Clevios PH 1000 aqueous solution was significantly enhanced through treatment with hexafluoroacetone (HFA). HFA hydrolyzes with water into a geminal diol, HFP2OH, which has two –OH groups connected to the middle carbon atom.50 Whang et al. reported that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P V4071) film was increased by more than two orders of magnitude merely by spin-coating a compound containing one or more polar groups onto the film, such as ethanol, methoxyethanol, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and ethylene glycol. Among them methoxyethanol (one hydroxyl and one ether group) and ethylene glycol (two hydroxyl groups) are more effective to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film.15 Considering that there are two hydroxyl groups and one ether group in the GMS molecule, we believe that the significant improvement of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film by GMS modification is primarily attributed to the hydroxyl groups which preferentially interact with the hydrophilic PSS chains of PEDOT:PSS (see Scheme 1).

3.3 Application of PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films as transparent anodes of BHJ-PSC devices
The high conductivity of PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer film along with the transparency of around 80% in the visible range fulfills its function as the transparent anode. Thus the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films were applied to replace ITO as the transparent anode of the conventional structure BHJ-PSC devices. Several different donor–acceptor mixtures as active layers were studied to investigate the applicability of our new bilayer ITO-free anode in different systems, including P3HT:PC61BM as the most commonly used system in the reported ITO-free BHJ-PSCs, two low bandgap donor materials such as poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di- 2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) and thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), and their chemical structures together with the device architecture were illustrated in Scheme 2.59Fig. 5 compares the J–V curves of the most commonly studied P3HT:PC61BM BHJ-PSC devices based on the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer transparent anodes fabricated at the optimized spin-coating speed of GMS layer and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in ESI-Table S3.† Clearly, when Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer film was used as transparent anode to replace ITO, the highest PCE (3.90%) was obtained, which is quite comparable to that of ITO-based device (3.75%) by considering the measurement errors. Likewise, the PCE of the ITO-free device using Clevios P/GMS as the transparent anode (3.25%) is also comparable to that of the corresponding ITO-based device (3.40%, see Fig. 5 and Table S3†). However, when the pristine PEDOT:PSS films without GMS modification were used as the anodes for the ITO-free PSCs, the devices exhibit very poor photovoltaic performance because of the extremely low conductivity of the pristine PEDOT:PSS films and the associated large sheet resistance (see Fig. 5 and Table S3†).
 Scheme 2  Device architectures of the BHJ-PSC devices using PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films as the transparent anodes. The active layer materials are the commonly studied P3HT:PC61BM (I) or low bandgap donor/PC71BM (II). The chemical structures of the low bandgap donor materials (PTB7, PCDTBT) and PFN cathode interlayer material used in this study are also shown.

The effectiveness of the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer films as transparent anodes of P3HT:PC61BM conventional BHJ-PSC devices stimulated us to use them in other devices based on such low bandgap donor materials as PCDTBT and PTB7 (see Scheme 2), which were recently reported to afford PCE over 8%.2,3 According to the comparison of the J–V curves (Fig. 6) and photovoltaic parameters (ESI-Table S4†) of PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ-PSC devices based on the PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer transparent anodes and analogous ITO-based BHJ-PSC devices, the device using Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer electrode with the higher conductivity (1019 S cm−1) exhibits higher PCE (5.90%) than that based on Clevios P/GMS bilayer electrode, which is comparable to that of the corresponding devices based on the traditional ITO electrode (6.33%). The slightly inferior performance of Clevios PH 1000/GMS-based device compared to that of ITO-based one is mainly due to the slight decreases of both Voc and FF (2–5%) while the variation of Jsc is negligible considering the measurement errors (see Fig. 6 and Table S4†). By replacing Clevios PH 1000 with the less-conductive Clevios P, all three photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc and FF) of the device based on Clevios P/GMS bilayer electrode decrease obviously, leading to a ca. 15% decrease in the PCE relative to that of Clevios PH 1000/GMS-based device. Interestingly, when PTB7:PC71BM was used as the active layer, the ITO-free, Clevios PH 1000/GMS-based device shows a PCE as high as 7.06%,59 which reaches ca. 91% of the PCE of ITO-based device (see ESI-Fig. S4 and Table S4† for the J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters).60 To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is the highest one for ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices reported up to now. These results demonstrate the universality of our new bilayer anode for versatile ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices.61 Furthermore, the above results reveal that the PCEs of the ITO-free devices are strongly dependent on the conductivity of their modified PEDOT:PSS electrodes, and this finding is in good accordance with the previous reports.15,50,51

4 Conclusions
In summary, by spin-coating a GMS surfactant layer onto PEDOT:PSS film affording a PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer electrode, we developed a facile approach to fabricate high-efficiency ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices. The conductivity of the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS film has been significantly improved by GMS modification and the highest conductivity reaches 1019 S cm−1 for Clevios PH 1000. With a sheet resistance of 98 Ω sq−1 achieved, the Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer films exhibit transparency of around 80% in the visible range. The conductivity improvement is proposed to result from the GMS-induced segregation of PSS chains and the conformational change of the conductive PEDOT chains within PEDOT:PSS. While the highly hydrophobic –(CH2)16CH3 groups of GMS preferentially interact with the hydrophobic PEDOT of PEDOT:PSS, the highly hydrophilic –COOCH2–CHOH–CH2OH groups preferentially interact with hydrophilic PSS chains with the hydroxyl groups playing an important role on the consequent phase separation between PEDOT and PSS chains. Using Clevios PH 1000/GMS bilayer films as the transparent anodes replacing ITO, high-efficiency ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices based on PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM systems exhibit PCE of 5.90% and 7.06%, respectively, which are comparable to the corresponding devices based on the traditional ITO anode. The obtained PCE of 7.06% is the highest one for ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices reported up to now. The universality of our new bilayer anode for BHJ-PSC devices based on versatile active layer materials promises its potential in the large-area high-efficiency ITO-free BHJ-PSCs.

As demonstrated before (ref. 2 and 3), poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) functions as a suitable cathode interlayer which is beneficial for the dramatic efficiency enhancement. Therefore in the present study PFN was incorporated as a cathode interlayer for both PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM devices as well.
For high-efficiency PTB7:PC71BM BHJ-PSCs, Clevios P Al4083 is typically used as the standard anode buffer layer, see ref. 2 and 3.
We also made the attempt to use GMS-doped PEDOT:PSS film as transparent electrodes in the same manner generally used in literature. Since GMS is insoluble in water, directly blending GMS into the aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution is impossible. Thus, we tried to dope GMS solution in methanol or isopropanol into the aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution, and found that, however, adding the GMS solutions in methanol or isopropanol even at a very low doping ratio (0.2 wt%) immediately resulted in a muddy mixture solution, which was not suitable for fabricating a uniform film. A plausible explanation to this phenomenon is that the interactions between GMS and PEDOT:PSS mixture would occur upon their blending.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting more and more attention due to their great promise as light-weight, flexible and cost-efficient renewable energy sources. For the state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC device, indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most popularly used transparent anode material for the conventional BHJ-PSC devices, which however suffers from several serious disadvantages such as limited indium sources, unsuitability for flexible electronic devices due to its high mechanical brittleness, and high preparation costs. Herein we report a new and facile approach of modifying PEDOT:PSS film by spin-coating a surfactant layer, glycerol monostearate (GMS), atop a PEDOT:PSS film, enabling the PEDOT:PSS/surfactant bilayer film. A significant improvement of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films (from ∼1 S cm−1 to more than 1000 S cm−1) was achieved by GMS modification and the highest conductivity reaches 1019 S cm−1 for Clevios PH 1000 under optimized spin-coating speed of GMS layer. The PEDOT:PSS/GMS bilayer film was successfully applied as the transparent anode for high-efficiency ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices, as a result comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to the corresponding traditional ITO-based devices was achieved and the highest PCE reaches 7.06%, which is the highest one for ITO-free BHJ-PSC devices reported up to now.
