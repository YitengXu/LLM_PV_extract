P3HS-b-P3HT spontaneously undergoes phase separation and P3HS-s-P3HT does not. P3HS-b-P3HT performs best when the intrinsic self-assembled nanostructure is the most perturbed. P3HS-s-P3HT does not undergo intrinsic phase separation, and vapor annealing can be used to optimize the polymer:fullerene morphology, where better nanostructure is well correlated with the best device. While the block structure provides the best stability, the statistical structure is a valuable method to balance the advantage of different monomers while precluding large-scale polymer self-assembly that is a strong intrinsic property of block structure.
Whereas the phase separation of many block copolymers is reasonably well established, the same cannot be said for fully π-conjugated copolymers due to a high degree of crystallinity that arises from strong interchain π–π stacking.1–4 Nanoscale phase separation in fully-conjugated block copolymers is a promising strategy to overcome some of the major issues that influence device applications, such as controlling directional charge-transport in a thin film transistor, or confining polymer domain sizes to the exciton diffusion length in a polymer solar cell (PSC).5–12 Although various rod-coil and rod–rod conjugated block copolymers have been synthesized and examined,13–19 devices prepared from these polymers rarely outperform their homopolymer analogues for reasons that remain unclear.20–28 Our group has developed selenophene–thiophene block copolymers, which are conjugated block copolymers that undergo intrinsic phase separation due to the preferential self-assembly of poly(3-hexylselenophene) (P3HS) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) blocks.29–31 Heavy atom substitution also leads to a red-shift in optical absorption.32–39 From a device standpoint we have found that the P3HS-b-P3HT arrangement leads to a more thermally stable morphology than either homopolymers or blends.31 On the other hand, it is not yet clear how the intrinsic phase separation within these block copolymers influences the ultimate polymer:fullerene morphology that is required for the optimization of photocurrent. Here we address this by directly comparing the morphology and PSC device performance of selenophene–thiophene copolymers that have the same degree of polymerization and composition, and differ in their intrinsic phase separation ability which is governed by their sequence (statistical vs. block).
As noted above, P3HS-b-P3HT is a conjugated polymer that undergoes intrinsic phase separation. However, the statistical version of that polymer, P3HS-s-P3HT, does not. Differences in sequence change other physical properties in these polymers as well.40–45 For example, P3HS-b-P3HT has a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap that is identical to P3HS (the more narrow HOMO–LUMO gap polyheterocycle), due to presence of the long P3HS-block in P3HS-b-P3HT. P3HS-s-P3HT has a wider HOMO–LUMO gap than P3HS, which is attributed to energy level averaging in the statistical polymer.29 The solubility of the statistical and block copolymers differs, and thus optimal PSC processing conditions are not the same. These differences will be considered and contrasted with device performance. Two fullerene acceptors [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), are chosen to further investigate the polymers. ICBA has higher lying LUMO energy levels, therefore higher open circuit voltage (VOC) can in principle be achieved. However, only a limited number of PSCs using ICBA as the acceptor have improved performance, which could be caused by morphology issues.46–52 It is noteworthy that the crystallization properties of PC71BM and ICBA are not the same.51
Before we compare the trends in the device data for the block and statistical copolymers (Table 1), it is important to note the differences in processability of the two polymers. P3HS-s-P3HT is more soluble than P3HS-b-P3HT, which allows it to be deposited from room temperature solutions (similar to P3HT) and dried slowly using the vapor annealing process, which has been shown to promote the polymer self-assembly behavior and lead to highly optimized polymer:fullerene morphology for P3HT-type polymers.53–55 The increased solubility of P3HS-s-P3HT arises from the statistical distribution of repeat units along the polymer backbone, which disrupts the strong interchain π–π interactions that exist in the P3HS block of P3HS-b-P3HT. On the other hand P3HS-b-P3HT must be deposited from a hot (80 °C) dichlorobenzene solution (similar to P3HS56) where it dries quickly. Previous work from our group has shown that further annealing does not improve P3HS-b-P3HT PSCs, which is unlike P3HT-type polymers, and the polymer:fullerene morphology with the best device performance is achieved using the fast-processed method noted above.31

We will first describe the device data that is obtained when the polymer:fullerene active layers are deposited from a hot dichlorobenzene solution and contain PC71BM as the acceptor (fast-processed). The efficiency of fast-processed as-cast P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM blend is over 2%, which is comparable to our previous results. Unlike P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM the best P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM devices are achieved after thermal annealing, with a similar, yet statistically slightly lower efficiency than P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM. The main loss mechanism in these two devices appears to arise from low current, and a low voltage that is limited by the relatively low lying LUMO energy level of PC71BM and high lying HOMO energy level of the polymer, which is typical of P3HT-type polymers. Fill factors are relatively good. We next turn to replacing PC71BM with ICBA to improve device efficiency by addressing the voltage issue. Interestingly, both P3HS-b-P3HT:ICBA and P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA have a significantly lower short circuit current density (JSC) than the corresponding devices that contain PC71BM. Although the expected higher VOC is achieved, the overall devices are not as efficient, due to a drastic loss of current, a factor of 2.8 and 2.2, for P3HS-b-P3HT and P3HS-s-P3HT, respectively. Under these conditions and using both of these polymers as examples, ICBA is a poor choice of acceptor material.
We next turn attention to the P3HS-s-P3HT:fullerene blends in which the active layer of the device is cast at room temperature and a slow vapor annealing step is carried out (slow-processed). This procedure improves the performance of both P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM and P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA devices by a large increase in current. The lower VOC may result from the higher crystallinity and therefore higher HOMO level of slow-processed polymer films. In the case of P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA current is improved by nearly a factor of 4 to the point where the overall device outperforms P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM. Interestingly the JSC of P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM is only 0.8 mA cm−2 larger than P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA, and given that both overall currents are larger than that of fast-processed devices, the relative difference is even smaller. Attempts were made to vapor anneal fast-processed P3HS-b-P3HT devices, but they never yielded improved devices and P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM was always superior to P3HS-b-P3HT:ICBA. These observations with different processing conditions and different acceptors highlight the physical differences between P3HS-b-P3HT and P3HS-s-P3HT.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra provide further evidence for the differences in photoresponse in the two polymers (Fig. 1). Using the optimized conditions for each polymer and using the same acceptor (PC71BM), it is clear that P3HS-b-P3HT has an extended spectral range. However the P3HS-s-P3HT EQE is larger than P3HS-b-P3HT in the spectral regions that they have in common. Lower EQE and current may indicate that P3HS-b-P3HT phase separation reduces the efficiency of exciton dissociation and/or promotes charge recombination at the polymer–acceptor interface.
 Fig. 1  EQE spectra of P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM (black) and P3HS-b-P3HT: PC71BM (red) devices using their optimized conditions. 
Next we determined the morphology of the P3HS-b-P3HT and P3HS-s-P3HT films. We first investigated the pristine fast-processed morphology, which are films that are cast directly from hot solution, do not contain a fullerene acceptor, and are not subject to any processing step. The P3HS-b-P3HT film contains fiber-like features (Fig. 2) that are consistent with intrinsic phase separation of the P3HS and P3HT domains within the block copolymer.29 In contrast, the P3HS-s-P3HT film does not contain obvious features. Although we have previously reported similar results using dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping, this is the first time that we compare the morphology of these copolymers with conventional bright-field TEM. The difference in morphology of P3HS-b-P3HT and P3HS-s-P3HT for such compositionally similar polymers is striking, but not unexpected.

We next compared the morphology of fast-processed films of the two copolymers that are blended with fullerene acceptors. Fiber-like features result when P3HS-b-P3HT is blended with ICBA. These features are less obvious when P3HS-b-P3HT is blended with PC71BM, however, and this result suggests that the acceptor may have an influence on polymer self-assembly and intrinsic polymer phase separation. Likely, the more crystalline PC71BM domains impede block copolymer self-assembly to a greater extent than less crystalline ICBA. Interestingly, the more obvious self-assembled structure that is observed in P3HS-b-P3HT:ICBA does not correlate with a better device efficiency, as the P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM device performs the best. This indicates that phase separation within the block copolymer may adversely affect the polymer:fullerene morphology that leads to the best device, which could be caused by the presence of large pure-polymer domains. On the other hand, the lack of structure in the P3HS-s-P3HT sample is also observed in the two P3HS-s-P3HT:fullerene blends.
AFM (Fig. 3) was also used to probe the surface topography and phase topography of the polymer:fullerene blends. Fine lamellar fibers are observed for fast-processed P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM and P3HS-b-P3HT:ICBA films. Similar features are observed for P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM and P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA films. The similar surface topography and phase topography in blends of each polymer that are prepared under identical conditions matches the similar device performance of these systems.
 Fig. 3  AFM images (the left is the height image and the right is phase image) of different polymer:acceptor films: (a) fast-processed P3HS-b-P3HT:ICBA, (b) fast-processed P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM, (c) fast-processed P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA, (d) fast-processed P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM, (e) slow-processed P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA and (f) slow-processed P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM. 
The most striking features in surface topography and phase topography of the polymer:fullerene blends are present in the slowly vapor annealed P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM and P3HS-s-P3HT:ICBA samples. Much more obvious lamellar fibers appear in phase images and rougher surface morphology is present in the height images. The features are well correlated with large improvements in device current and thus appear to arise from the type of polymer:fullerene phase separation that improves charge generation, as noted by the improved EQE spectrum of the P3HS-s-P3HT:PC71BM sample as opposed to P3HS-b-P3HT:PC71BM.
Polymer:fullerene phase separation is crucial for obtaining a morphology that promotes charge generation in the active layer of all PSCs. Here we have studied two conjugated copolymers with the same composition — one that spontaneously undergoes intrinsic phase separation and one that does not. Although each of these polymers comprises a different conjugated chromophore, differences in optical properties alone do not explain the differences in EQE and power conversion efficiency. P3HS-b-P3HT PSCs perform best when the native self-assembled structure is the most perturbed using PC71BM. ICBA is unable to perturb the intrinsic self-assembly of this polymer, and thus despite improvements in voltage, the photocurrent generated by the device is reduced. P3HS-s-P3HT is a polymer that does not form a native phase separated structure. Here vapor annealing can be used to more predictably optimize the polymer:fullerene morphology, where better nanoscale structure is well correlated with the best device. This study suggests that when self-assembly is a strong intrinsic property of the polymer, the morphology of the polymer:fullerene blend is more difficult to modify and improve by extrinsic optimization methods such as vapor annealing. While the block structure provides the best stability, the statistical structure could be a valuable method to balance the advantage of different monomers while precluding polymer domain growth by strong self-assembly. Polymers that undergo intrinsic phase separation to a certain degree may lead to materials that balance these two opposing properties.
Experimental section
Synthesis of P3HS-b-P3HT30 and P3HS-s-P3HT52 has been described previously and characterization data reported. 1H and 13C NMR were performed using a Varian Mercury 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer. Polymer molecular weights were determined on a Malvern 350 HT-GPC system at 140 °C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (stabilized with butylated hydroxytoluene at a concentration of 0.5 g L−1) as the mobile phase. An additional column purification was performed on P3HS-b-P3HT. As discussed previously, relative compositions were determined by integration of proton resonances in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectra. For the block copolymer, the peak at 7.12 ppm corresponds to the selenophene content of the polymer, while the peak at 6.98 ppm corresponds to the thiophene content of the polymer. The statistical copolymer requires integration of two additional peaks, due to the population of mixed diads in the polymer backbone. In this case, the combined integration of the peaks at 7.19 and 7.12 ppm correspond to the selenophene content of the polymer, while the combined integration of the peaks at 6.98 and 6.92 ppm are used to determine the relative thiophene content in the polymer. P3HS-b-P3HT 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ [ppm] = 7.12 (s, 0.48H), 6.98 (s, 0.44H), 2.85–2.69 (m, 2H), 1.75–1.63 (m, 2H), 1.52–1.25 (m, 6H), 0.96–0.86 (m, 3H). GPC (1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 140 °C): Mn = 26.8 kDa, Mw = 34.2, PDI = 1.28. P3HS-s-P3HT 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ [ppm] = 7.19 (s, 0.27H), 7.12 (s, 0.22H), 6.98 (s, 0.26H), 6.92 (s, 0.25H), 2.87–2.70 (m, 2H), 1.78–1.63 (m, 2H), 1.52–1.25 (m, 6H), 0.96–0.86 (m, 3H). GPC (1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 140 °C): Mn = 22.8 kDa, Mw = 26.8, PDI = 1.18.
PC71BM (American Dye Source) and ICBA (Solaris) were purchased and used as received. Devices were fabricated on commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (Thin Film Devices) that had a sheet resistance of ∼10 Ω □−1. These substrates were cleaned in aqueous detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and methanol, and subsequently treated in an air-plasma cleaner for 5 min. Next, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was coated onto the substrates at 3000 rpm and annealed at 130 °C in air for 15 min, after which the substrate was transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Polymer:fullerene films were spin-coated at 800 rpm from 1,2-dichlorobenzene solutions (15:15 mg mL−1). Solutions were stirred at 80 °C overnight to ensure complete dissolution. For fast processed films hot solutions were used directly. Immediately after film deposition, substrates were heated at 80 °C on a hot plate in the glove box until films were completely dried (∼1 min). For slow processed films, solutions were cooled down to room temperature before spin-coating, and substrates were transferred into sealed Petri-dishes after deposition (while films were wet) and allowed to slowly dry at room temperature. To finish the device, a 0.8 nm LiF layer and 100 nm Al cathode was thermally deposited through a shadow mask at ∼10−6 torr using an Angstrom Engineering Covap II (Kitchener, Ontario, Canada). Device area is 0.07 cm2 as defined by the area of circular Al cathode. I–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G conditions. The mismatch of simulator spectrum was calibrated using a Si diode with a KG-5 filter. EQE spectra were recorded and compared with a Si reference cell that is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. AFM images were obtained with a Veeco Dimension 3000 microscope. TEM images were obtained on a Hitachi H-7000 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.
