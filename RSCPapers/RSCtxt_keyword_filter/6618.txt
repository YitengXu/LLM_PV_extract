    , Accepted 12th August 2022First published on 15th August 2022AbstractTerpolymerization is a feasible approach to optimize the device performance of organic semiconductors. Yet, since most reported terpolymers utilize a one-pot polymerization method, the regularity of the polymer backbone is severely disrupted, and the sequence structure is roughly unclear. Herein, a novel stepwise-feeding terpolymerization approach is developed to finely adjust the terpolymerization process by utilizing the merits of stereoregular donor–acceptor alternative polymerization as well as irregular random copolymerization. In the novel stepwise-feeding terpolymerization, a pre-polymer of the host polymer D18 was synthesized initially, followed by adding a third unit BDD into the polymer backbone. The obtained H9 terpolymer has a more regular main chain with a more definite sequence distribution than its analogs (H6) prepared by one-pot polymerization. As a result, the stepwise-feeding-based terpolymer H9 offered significantly reduced energy loss in the combination with the Y6 acceptor in blend, yielding a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 18.50% in the terpolymer-based organic solar cells (OSCs). The results demonstrate that stepwise terpolymerization is an effective approach to developing regular terpolymeric semiconductors for high-performance OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention in terms of mechanical flexibility, low cost, and easy fabrication.1,2 With the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) and polymer donors, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have exceeded 19%.3 To further increase the PCEs, the device parameters, e.g. the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), need to be simultaneously enhanced.
Till now, various molecular design strategies have been developed to enhance optoelectronic properties, such as structure modifications, side-chain engineering, and functional group substitutions.4–6 Among these approaches, structure modification via random terpolymerization is a simple yet feasible method without tedious synthesis. Hou et al. incorporated an ester-substituted thiophene unit into the PM6 backbone to offer simultaneously enhanced Jsc and Voc in OSCs.7 Although remarkable achievements have been made in random terpolymerization, i.e., modulating the chemical structure and molar ratio of the third component,8–10 which are processed in one-pot polymerization, the one-pot polymerization method wherein all the monomers are added in at once is accompanied by the following inevitable problems: (i) the D–A periodic sequence distribution in the polymer will be seriously interrupted when inserting the third component; (ii) the position of the third component in the backbone is unclear; (iii) the obtained structure suffers from serious batch-to-batch variation due to the random copolymerization mechanism and different monomer reactivities. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the influence of polymerization methods on the polymer structure and corresponding device performances.
A prepolymer is known as an intermediate with a low molecular weight between the monomer and final polymer and can be used to predict the location of the component in a polymer.11–13 In this work, a novel stepwise-feeding terpolymerization method is proposed. In the stepwise-feeding process, a pre-polymer of the host polymer is synthesized first, and then the third component is introduced into the polymer backbone (Fig. 1). Compared with the one-pot method, this method can achieve a more regular main chain and a more definite sequence distribution, thereby achieving a performance improvement. Herein, we employ this new terpolymerization into a state-of-the-art D18 polymer donor14,15 by introducing a 1,3-bis(thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) unit16–18 as the third unit via tuning its molar ratio and feeding time. A series of copolymers H6, H7, H8, H9, and H10 were synthesized. Compared with the one-pot polymerization method, the stepwise-feeding-based terpolymer H9 exhibits not only comparable low bandgap and deep energy levels but also higher planarity and more tightened π-face-on stacking than that of the random terpolymer H6 with the same BDD molar ratio. As a result, the H9:Y6 based OSC achieves an outstanding PCE of 18.50%, which is one of the highest reported PCE values for terpolymer-based OSCs.

Results and discussion
All the polymers were synthesized using Stille coupling polycondensation (Fig. 1a). According to the typical procedure,14,15 the pristine alternating copolymer D18, random terpolymer H6 (with 10% BDD), and H7 (with 20% BDD) were prepared by a one-pot polymerization method for 3.0 h. In the stepwise-feeding terpolymerization, F-BDT (90%) and DTBT (90%) monomers were fed first (kept running for 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 h, respectively) to obtain the prepolymer; then F-BDT (10%) and BDD (10%) were added (kept running for additional reaction times 4.5, 3.0 and 1.5 h) to afford polymers H8, H9, and H10 (Fig. 1b and c). The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† The corresponding polymer structure was confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. 2) and high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as an eluent (Fig. S1–S9, ESI†). According to the GPC measurement, the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the H8-based prepolymer is 16.76 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.31; the H9-based prepolymer is 23.97 kDa with a PDI of 2.77 and the H10-based prepolymer is 54.02 kDa with a PDI of 2.37 (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). The Mn of the obtained terpolymer is 62.44 kDa with a PDI of 2.17 for D18, 57.67 kDa with a PDI of 1.96 for H6, 60.98 kDa with a PDI of 2.14 for H7, 64.31 kDa with a PDI of 2.04 for H8, 65.58 kDa with a PDI of 1.97 for H9 and 74.43 kDa with a PDI of 2.27 for H10, respectively (Fig. S4–S9, ESI†). From the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), typical signals of F-BDT, DTBT, and BDD segments appear in H6, H7, H8, H9, and H10-based polymers, such as 7.90–6.80 ppm for aromatic peaks and 0.80–2.30 ppm for the aliphatic peaks in DTBT and BDD (Fig. 2). Besides, the related polymers were further confirmed by elemental analyses (EA) based on the ratio of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) atoms, which exist only in BDD and DTBT. The O:N was determined to be around 0.24:2.17, 0.43:1.66, 0.25:2.24, 0.26:2.36 and 0.26:2.39 for H6, H7, H8, H9 and H10, showing agreement with the ratio of reactants. Besides, to investigate the batch-to-batch variation in polymerization, four additional repeating experiments under the same H9 conditions were carried out. The repeated terpolymer displayed similar Mn (Mn: 56.16 kDa–65.58 kDa; PDI: 1.97–2.38) and yields, indicating the excellent reproducibility of stepwise-feeding terpolymerization.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization was carried out to explore the effect of the BDD unit and feeding time on the terpolymer energy levels (Table 1, and Fig. S10 (ESI)†). With the BDD content increasing, the energy levels of terpolymers gradually down-shift, where the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) are −3.58 and −5.52 eV for D18, −3.61 and −5.54 eV for H6, −3.71 and −5.60 eV for H7, −3.61 and −5.53 eV for H8, −3.62 and −5.53 eV for H9, and −3.61 and −5.51 eV for H10, respectively. The downshifted HOMO energy levels of the H7 contribute to increasing the Voc and reducing energy loss (Eloss) in OSCs. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed to further confirm the trend of the energy levels. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI),† because of the strong electron-deficient nature of DTBT and BDD units, the LUMO energy level is mainly localized on the DTBT and BDD units, and the calculated values are in parallel with the CV test results. In addition, we also explored the dihedral angles of the BDD and DTBT through the optimal geometries by DFT calculations. Compared with a dihedral angle of 31.62° between BDT and DTBT, the dihedral angle of BDT and BDD is 0.95° (Fig. S12, ESI†). Thus, introducing the BDD unit into the polymer offers a more planar conformation than D18.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymer donors in thin films are displayed in Fig. 3a and b and Table 1. With the first step reaction time (t1) increased from 1.5 h to 3.0 h, the absorption of the pre-polymer is redshifted due to the expansion of the conjugate skeleton with the increased molecular weight (Fig. 3a). For the D18 thin films, the optical bandgap (Egopt) is 1.98 eV, while the absorption edges of H6, H7, H8, H9, and H10 films are located at 660, 685, 665, 682, and 626 nm, and the corresponding Egopt is 1.88, 1.81, 1.86 1.82, and 1.98 eV, respectively. The wider absorption range and enhanced absorption with higher BDD content can be ascribed to the stronger absorption ability of BDD than that of the DTBT unit. Although H6, H8, and H9 comprise the same BDD unit and molar ratio, the stepwise-feeding polymerization-based H9 neat film exhibits a red-shifted wavelength along with a stronger (0–0) transition peak in the long-wavelength range, suggesting that the stepwise-feeding terpolymerization method contributes to a more ordered structure and stronger π–π stacking interaction in the H9 solid state.19

The OSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are depicted in Fig. 3c and d, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and S1–S3 (ESI).† The optimized OSC based on D18:Y6 exhibited a PCE of 17.26%, which is comparable with the previously reported value.20 The obtained PCEs are 18.12% with a Voc of 0.888 V for H6:Y6-based devices and 16.92% with a Voc of 0.889 V for H7:Y6-based devices. The Voc of the terpolymer-based cells increased in comparison with that of D18, which is in accordance with the energy level diagram. For the stepwise-feeding-based terpolymers, the H8:Y6 and H10:Y6-based cells show PCEs of 18.28% and 16.58%, respectively. In the meantime, the H9:Y6-based device gave a remarkable PCE as high as 18.50% with a Voc of 0.890 V, a Jsc of 26.68 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.89%. Note that the PCE of 18.50% is the highest reported PCE value for terpolymer-based OSCs (Fig. 3e). The impressive efficiency improvement is attributed to the enhanced tightened π-face-on molecular stacking and ordered aggregations in its blend formation without annealing, which led to the increase of Voc and Jsc. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding OSCs was measured to study the detailed photon conversion process and to confirm the Jsc (Fig. 3f). The current density values integrated from the EQE curves under the AM 1.5 G spectrum are 25.37, 25.81, 25.38, 26.28, 26.24, and 25.01 mA cm−2 for the OSCs based on D18:Y6, H6:Y6, H7:Y6, H8:Y6, H9:Y6, and H10:Y6, respectively, which are well consistent with the Jsc values measured from the J–V curves within a 5% mismatch.

Furthermore, we also synthesized a series of D18, H6, and H9 with different molecular weights to explore the impact of different batches of polymer donors on photovoltaic properties (Fig. 4a). Compared with the PCE being greatly reduced with the Mn increasing for D18 and H6 (Mn = 40.65–62.44 kDa for D18 and Mn = 40.01–74.43 kDa for H6), the H9 displayed excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility with the PCE being much less sensitive to variation of Mn = 52.14–79.66 kDa (as shown in Table S4, ESI†). Because of the D–A alternating copolymer D18 is sensitive to the crystallinity and aggregation, the unique properties of the random copolymer make H6 insensitive to the molecular weight than D18. While for the H9, the obtained polymer was prepared by using the pre-polymer, and the properties of the host polymer can be well retained. The sequence structure of the polymer donor can be optimized using the prepolymer chain length by changing the feeding time. Thereby, the stepwise-feeding terpolymerization method is a feasible method to increase the device performance and batch-to-batch reproducibility for the polymer-based cells, which is crucially important for future commercial application of OSCs.

We have estimated the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) with the hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:Y6/MoO3/Ag) and electron-only devices (ITO/ZnO/polymer:Y6/PDINN/Al),20,21 respectively. In comparison with the μe/μh values of 3.22 × 10−4/5.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.63 × 10−4/5.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.42 × 10−4/4.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/5.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.19 × 10−4/5.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for D18:Y6, H6:Y6, H7:Y6, H8:Y6 and H10:Y6-based devices, the H9:Y6-based device exhibits higher mobility values and more balanced μe/μh with 4.68 × 10−4/5.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 4b and S13, ESI†). The increased mobility values and more balanced μe/μh indicate better electron and better hole transport capability of the terpolymer H9, which could be responsible for the enhanced Jsc and FF parameters in the device.
The exciton dissociation probability of the device can be judged using the value of Jph/Jsat (Jsat is saturated photocurrent).22,23 The calculated Jph/Jsat values are 97.3/89.8, 95.5/81.1,96.4/84.2, 98.1/89.9, 98.8/90.2 and 96.7/89.8 for the D18, H6, H7, H8, H9 and H10-based OSCs, respectively (Fig. 4c). The results indicate that the H9-based device possesses the fastest and most efficient exciton dissociation among the four cells. To better understand the effect of the polymerization method on the charge carrier recombination mechanism in OSCs, the correlation between Jsc and Plight is depicted by the formula of Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is the slope obtained by fitting.24,25 The α values are 0.986, 0.981, 0.990, 0.993, 0.996 and 0.983 for D18:Y6, H6:Y6, H7:Y6, H8:Y6, H9:Y6 and H10:Y6-based OSCs (Fig. 4d), indicating negligible bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge carrier transportation in the H9:Y6-based cell. Besides, we also explore the relationship between Voc and Plightvia Voc ∝ nkT/qlnPlight,26,27 and the slopes of the fitting lines for the OSCs based on D18:Y6, H6:Y6, H7:Y6, H8:Y6, H9:Y6 and H10:Y6 are 1.38, 1.32, 1.43, 1.30, 1.20 and 1.45kT/q, respectively (Fig. S14†). The slope of the H9:Y6-based device is very close to 1.0kT/q, suggesting that trap-assisted recombination and geminate recombination were significantly suppressed. Consequently, the most efficient exciton dissociation and minimal charge carrier recombination possibility were observed in the H9:Y6 based OSCs, boosting its FF to as high as 77.89%.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out to investigate the molecular orientation and morphology (Fig. 5 and S15, ESI, and Table S5†). All the polymer donors exhibit clear face-on molecular orientation in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, suggesting the well π–π stacking at (010) orientation. Compared with the crystal coherence length (CCL) of D18 (21.732 Å), the terpolymers H6 and H7 exhibit reduced crystallinity with CCLs of 20.855 and 19.994 Å, respectively, while for the stepwise-feeding-based terpolymer, the CCL was increased from 21.163 to 21.896 Å with T1 extended from 1.5 h to 4.5 h, especially the H9 film; except for a higher CCL of 22.087 Å, a strong diffraction (100) peak was also observed in the in-plane direction, indicating the formation of mixed edge-on and face-on arrangements, facilitating charge carrier transfer in both vertical and parallel pathways (Fig. 5).31 The result demonstrates that the planarity and ordering of the host polymer backbone are well maintained via stepwise-feeding terpolymerization. Upon blending, the H9:Y6 blend exhibited the strongest π–π stacking diffraction signal with the largest CCL value of 24.882 Å (Fig. S15, ESI†). This indicates that the stepwise-feeding polymerization benefits more tightened π-face-on molecular stacking, which facilitates charge transport and thus improves device performances. The wider absorption range (UV-vis absorption spectra) and stronger crystallinity (GIWAXS results) suggest that the terpolymer H9 possesses higher planarity and more tightened π-face-on stacking than others.

Besides, we also conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the surface morphology of blend films. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the one-pot-based terpolymer of D18:Y6, H6:Y6, and H7:Y6 is 1.80, 1.60, and 2.09 nm, respectively. When further increasing the feeding time of T1 based on H6, larger aggregates were observed with the RMS increased from 1.47 nm for H8:Y6 to 2.01 nm for H10:Y6. While the H9:Y6 film demonstrates a more well-distributed fibrous matrix with a smaller RMS of 1.08 nm (Fig. 6), which favors charge transport and collection with the enhanced Jsc and FF in devices. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to further probe the intermolecular aggregation effect of different polymer donors (Fig. S16, ESI†). Among them, the H9:Y6 blend film exhibited a more obvious phase separation with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network compared to others, which is consistent with the above GIWAXS and AFM measurements.

Electroluminescence (EL) and Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy-EQE (FTPS-EQE) were performed to evaluate Eloss (Fig. 7). The Eloss consists of three parts, and the relationship can be written as the following equation: qΔV = Eg − qVoc =(Eg − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc) = (Eg − qVSQoc) + qΔVrad,below gapoc + qΔVnon-radoc = ΔE1 + ΔE2 +ΔE3(1)where q and ΔV are the elementary charge and voltage loss. VSQoc and Vradoc are the maximum voltage and the open-circuit voltage when there is only radiative recombination. ΔVrad,below gapoc and ΔVnon-radoc are the voltage loss of radiative recombination from the absorption below the gap and the voltage loss of the non-radiative recombination, respectively.28–37 The radiative recombination losses of ΔE2 are 0.079, 0.058, 0.063, and 0.058 eV for the D18, H6, H7, and H9-based OSCs, respectively. The nonradiative energy losses of ΔE3 are 0.206, 0.190, 0.191 and 0.166 eV for D18, H6, H7, and H9-based OSCs, respectively (Fig. 7f). Besides, according to the sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) spectrum, the calculated ECTs values are 1.351, 1.335, 1.358, and 1.362 eV for D18, H6, H7, and H9-based devices (Fig. 7b and g). Both the reduced non-radiative charge recombination and increased ECT contribute to the higher Voc in the H9-based OSCs.

Conclusion
In summary, a novel stepwise-feeding polymerization method is developed to finely adjust the terpolymerization process and a series of novel terpolymers by introducing the BDD unit into the D18 donor backbone were designed. Owing to the strong electron-withdrawing ability and excellent absorption of BDD, the obtained terpolymers exhibit low-lying HOMO energy levels and enhanced absorption ability. In combination with the Y6 acceptor, the one-pot polymerized H6-based device (10% BDD) exhibited a PCE of 18.12%, and the H7-based device (20% BDD) exhibited a PCE of 16.92%, while a stepwise-feeding terpolymerized H9-based film (10% BDD) displayed a wider absorption range and stronger crystallinity. Consequently, a remarkable PCE of up to 18.50% was achieved, which is one of the highest reported PCE values for terpolymer-based OSCs. In this work, we performed the stepwise-feeding polymerization method in the D18-based system, but we believe that the enhanced regular main chain and more definite sequence distribution produced by such a method are also conductive and general for high-performance OSCs.
