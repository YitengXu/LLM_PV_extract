The main difficulty lies in achieving phosphine-free Se precursors. Most reported protocols for the synthesis of size-confined CISe QDs highly depend on the use of air-sensitive, toxic, and expensive alkylphosphines to prepare reactive Se precursors and to confine particle growth. Herein, we present a new amine/thiol combination-based route to Se precursors that may enable a general synthesis of phosphine-free selenide QDs. What's more, instead of the traditional “hot-injection” method, we also report the first one-pot noninjection synthesis of high quality CISe QDs enabled by our strategy. A very high chemical yield of ∼95% is demonstrated, as well as the facile gram-scale production of monodisperse CISe QDs. By simply adjusting the amount of 1-dodecanethiol used in the synthesis, we are able to produce CISe QDs with continuous tunability of the particle size from ∼2 nm to ∼10 nm, and hence their intrinsic optical properties.
Over the course of the past few decades, colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have gained significant attention for both fundamental research and commercial applications owing to their strong size-dependent properties and excellent chemical processibility.1–4 Particularly, compared to cadmium or lead-contained QDs, copper-based chalcogenide alloyed QDs such as CuInS2, CuInSe2, Cu2ZnSnS4, and CuInSexS2−x are of particular interest to researchers due to their lower toxicity, better biocompatibility, and unique photoelectric properties. They are actually gaining increased attention for their potential use in biological labels,5,6 light-emitting devices,7,8 electrocatalysts,9,10 and photovoltaics.11,12 In the past few years, substantial progress has been made in colloidal synthesis of Cu-based alloyed nanocrystals (NCs). Particularly for CuInS2, several independent synthetic protocols have been achieved leading to the formation of CuInS2 QDs with the desired crystal size, shape, composition, and crystallographic structure. These in turn greatly promoted the development of low-cost CuInS2 QD-based photovoltaics.11,13,14 Its selenium analogue, another important Cu-based chalcogenide, CuInSe2 (CISe) in particular has a near-optimal and finely tunable band gap ranging from 0.96 to 1.65 eV,15,16 and a higher optical absorption coefficient in the visible spectral range (∼104−105 cm−1),16,17 and it is considered as a more promising candidate for use in photovoltaics. In fact, a certified solar-energy conversion efficiency as high as 14.5% has been achieved for CISe thin-film solar cells.18 However, in comparison with the well-established CuInS2 QD system, studies on CISe QDs are not as advanced, which might be due to the lack of appropriate synthetic methods that allow for slow growth necessary to afford particle sizes within the QD diameter range, i.e. below the exciton Bohr radius of CISe (about 10.6 nm (ref. 19)). Preliminary synthesis of CISe NCs typically employed oleylamine (OAm) to prepare Se precursors and simultaneously as the surface ligand to control particle growth.20–23 Although these amine-based routes are sufficient to produce CuInS2 QDs,11 they failed to synthesize CISe QDs and generally yield larger non-quantum confined particles with a band gap close to their bulk counterparts. This indicates the difference in ligand choosing for the control of nucleation and growth of certain NCs.24,25 A general approach to CISe NCs that provides more size control has been the use of alkylphosphines like trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO). For example, Malik et al. first conducted the synthesis of CISe QDs by a hot-injection technique using CuCl, InCl3, trioctylphosphine selenide (TOP-Se, prepared by dissolving Se powder in TOP), and TOPO. These TOPO-capped CISe QDs had a spherical shape with a diameter of about 4.5 nm.26 Whereas in addition to the long reaction time required for the synthesis, an obvious shortcoming of this method is the use of TOP and TOPO, which are all very toxic reagents. Care should be taken to avoid the release of these reagents to the environment. Other alternative alkylphosphines such as tributylphosphine (TBP)27 and diphenylphosphine (DPP)15 have been lately investigated as ligands and solvents to synthesize CISe QDs, yet they also have the disadvantages of being air-sensitive and hazardous. Particularly for DPP, it is highly flammable and should be handled in a glovebox. Recent studies have suggested that nonhazardous and safe dodecanethiol (DDT) serves as the robust capping agent to stabilize the growth of CISe QDs. For instance, Li's group prepared CISe QDs by applying CuCl, InCl3, and octadecene as non-coordinating solvents, DDT as the ligand, and injection of the Se precursor (TOP-Se) at 180 °C;28 Maynard and co-workers used a similar route to DDT-capped CISe QDs with Se powder dissolved in TBP instead.27 As we have seen, however, these approaches still need alkylphosphines to prepare reactive Se sources.12,19,29 As such, overall, although several methods have been reported which describe the synthesis of CISe and related NCs, there are few methods which can synthesize CISe QDs using a phosphine-free way.30
In addition to the need for phosphine-free synthesis, a one-pot strategy that is favorable for the scalable production is also highly desirable. In recent years, the hot-injection method has become very popular for the synthesis of high-quality NCs, which has also been intensely used in the above mentioned studies. However, such a process relies on the rapid injection of a small dose of precursors into the hot reaction medium to ensure a narrow size distribution and high crystallinity, the throughput is low and it is difficult to scale-up. Moreover, the properties of the resulting NCs can be sensitive to processing conditions and environments. In contrast, the one-pot synthetic route offers the advantage of successive chemical reactions in just one single pot, which is quite desired by chemists because it avoids a lengthy separation process and purification of the intermediate chemical compounds, saving time and resources while increasing the chemical yield with minimal reagent waste.7
In this study, we report a robust and efficient one-pot phosphine-free route to CISe QDs with tunable particle size and high reproducibility. The key point to conduct phosphine-free synthesis lies in obtaining phosphine-free Se precursors. Recent work by Brutchey et al. has shown that a binary solvent mixture with the dithiol/diamine functionality possesses remarkable ability to dissolve Se at room temperature under atmospheric pressure.31–33 However, the studied solvent combinations like 1,2-ethylenediamine/1,2-ethanedithiol and n-propanethiol/n-propanethiol are not suitable for high-temperature colloidal synthesis because of their low boiling point. Herein, a new chemistry consisting of a high boiling point solvent mixture of amine/thiol was developed to prepare reactive Se precursors. As has been introduced before, high boiling chemicals DDT and OAm were commonly used in colloidal synthesis of NCs. But it is known that DDT alone does not possess any appreciable solvent power for Se, and OAm can only dissolve Se at high temperatures above 280 °C. As expected, adding a small amount of DDT to OAm can rapidly dissolve Se, and importantly this solvent mixture exhibits good chemical stability at relatively high temperatures, being suitable as general Se precursors for the synthesis of various selenide NC materials.
In our synthesis of CISe QDs, Se powder (1.5 mmol, 118 mg, Alfa Aesar, 200 mesh, 99.999%), copper iodide (CuI, 0.75 mmol, 143 mg, Alfa Aesar, 99.998%), indium acetate (In(OAc)3, 0.75 mmol, 219 mg, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%), 2 mL of paraffin wax (Sinopharm Chemical, chemical grade), 6 mL of OAm (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%), and 0.2 mL of DDT (Acros, 98%) were loaded in a 50 mL three-neck flask. The mixture was stirred and degassed at 30 °C for 30 min to give a dark red solution. The solution was then heated by a rapid (∼10 min) ramp to 180 °C under an argon atmosphere, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min. Upon completion, the reaction was quenched by using a water bath, QDs were separated from the reaction media by centrifugation and purified several times with methanol. The final products were dried under nitrogen and dispersed in chloroform. The dispersed QDs in chloroform can be stable for over 3 months in a sealed glass vial at room temperature, no noticeable precipitation was noted during this period of our observation.
Compared to the traditional hot-injection method, the proposed noninjection route can easily yield CISe QDs on a gram scale. For example, by scaling up the amounts of the used reagents 4.2-fold, up to 1 g of CISe QDs can be obtained from a single batch reaction, which also indicates a very high product yield in excess of 95% (the mass and product yield of the aliquots were measured after collecting the product from the first centrifugation). We note that the conversion in our method is much higher than that with a typical route to CISe QDs (∼15%),21 and better than a recent high report,15 where 85% conversion of metal precursors to NCs can be achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first report on the synthesis of CuInSe2 QDs with the use of a one-step noninjection method.
The structure of the as-synthesized QDs was first investigated by XRD measurement. XRD spectra (Fig. 1a) of the resultant sample matched with the data of the bulk tetragonal phase CISe (#JCPDS 40-1487) with the expected peak broadening with decreasing particle size. XPS analysis was then performed to assess the chemical composition and bonding states at the compound surface. No peaks of other elements except for C, O, Cu, In, Se, and S are observed in its typical XPS survey spectrum (upper left of Fig. 1b), suggesting the high purity of the prepared QDs. The other panels of Fig. 1b show high-resolution Cu, In, and Se XPS peaks. The Cu 2p3/2 (2p1/2) peak located at 932.1 eV (951.9 eV) matches well with the reported binding energy for Cu+ in CuInSe2, while the In 3d5/2 (3d3/2) peak at 444.3 eV (451.7 eV) is representative of In3+, and the asymmetric peak at 53.8 eV confirms the Se2− state.34–36 The chemical composition of the as-prepared QDs was further examined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), which showed a Cu/In/Se/S atomic ratio of 1.03:1.00:2.02:0.32, close to the ideal stoichiometry ratio of the CuInSe2 semiconductor. The non-negligible amount of sulfur can be attributed to the presence of thiol ligands on QDs. Finally, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps of the as-prepared sample (Fig. 1c) confirm that these elements are homogeneously distributed within QDs.

(d) UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of CISe QDs dispersed in chloroform prepared with a controlled amount of DDT addition and their corresponding photoluminescence spectra, overlaid. The spectra are shifted for clarity. 
Developing high quality QDs with a precisely tunable particle size is highly desirable since the size of the QDs significantly affects their intrinsic optoelectronic properties and thus the device performance.37 Next, we demonstrate that the resulting CISe QDs possess continuous tunability of the particle size and optical properties without altering their chemical composition. Fig. 1d shows the UV-vis-NIR absorption and PL emission spectra of the CIS QDs prepared with different amounts of DDT. Both the excitonic absorption peak and PL emission peak demonstrate a considerable blue shift (Abs: from 770 nm to 610 nm, PL: from 820 nm to 665 nm) as we increased the amount of DDT from 0.2 ml to 2.0 ml, indicative of a decrease in the particle size of the QD according to quantum confinement, as determined by the following TEM observations in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a, c and e) show representative low-magnification TEM images recorded from the above CISe, which indicate that the QDs are nearly monodispersed with a spherical shape. The clear lattice fringes seen in Fig. 2(b, d and f) also suggest that the products are well crystallized. Obviously, as the DDT used in the synthesis increases from 0.2 mL to 2 mL, the particle size of the tetragonal CISe decreases from ∼10 nm to ∼2 nm, while maintaining a narrow size distribution (the detailed relationship between the particle size of QD and the amount of DDT is illustrated in Fig. S1, ESI†). XRD studies in Fig. S2† further confirm this trend as the diffraction peaks of CISe QDs remarkably broadened when more DDT was used. In our synthesis, organic DDT constitutes one of the mixture solvents as well as serves as the main capping ligand for the resulting QDs. The strong dependence of the particle size on the concentration of the used DDT can be explained by the fact that the capping agents used in colloidal synthesis greatly influence both the kinetics of the nucleation and growth stage of the NCs.24,25,38 As noted before, OAm capping alone tends to yield large non-quantum confined CISe NCs while DDT capping can afford CISe QDs with a quantum-confined size scale, proving its strong confining ability over particle growth during synthesis.21,28 Therefore, reducing the amount of DDT in solution hinders this very size confining effect which results in a larger QD size. However, it should be pointed out that, in our case, extending the reaction time (e.g., from 5 min to 120 min) or raising the final temperature in a specific range from 180 °C to 220 °C (the maximum value of 220 °C was determined because DDT starts to decompose at a temperature of approximately 220 °C and will release reactive sulfur to the reaction system13,27) did not lead to significantly larger QDs. This is confirmed by their absorption spectra in Fig. S3† that do not display any appreciable change in the excitonic absorption peak when varying these synthetic parameters. Interestingly, such behavior is quite different from that observed in Korgel and Hepp et al.'s routes,15,39 in which an increased particle size was demonstrated with higher reaction temperatures. To elucidate this, further investigation on the formation mechanism and properties of our CISe QDs is required.

CISe QDs are widely explored as a promising semiconductor material for solar harvesting applications.40 In an attempt to make high-efficiency CISe QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), we have modified the surface of the as-prepared QDs with shorter functional groups as those native long-chain organic ligands anchored on the QD surface usually militate against efficient carrier transport in semiconductor thin films, decreasing the photocurrent of the solar cell devices.41,42 Early results by Zhong et al. suggested that the MPA ligand not only enhances electronic coupling but also increases the surface coverage of the QDs on TiO2 films due to the coordination of carboxyl and titanium.11,37 However, it is generally believed that the alkanethiol capping agent like DDT in our case is difficult to be replaced and indeed MPA ligand exchange following Zhong's literature methods was unsuccessful.11 In order to enhance the optoelectronic properties and the solubility of these CISe QDs in a polar solvent we proposed a robust and efficient method that enables a successful ligand exchange (see the ESI for details†). It should be mentioned that no significant changes were observed in absorption spectra (Fig. S4†) and hence the particle size of the resulting QDs after the ligand exchange, which agrees well with the previous studies.43,44 Thereafter, mesoporous TiO2 films prepared from our previous work45 were immersed in the obtained QD methanol solution overnight at room temperature. The uniform and high coverage of the CISe QDs on the TiO2 surface throughout the entire film thickness is confirmed by cross-section SEM with EDS elemental mappings shown in Fig. 3a. The Ti, Cu, In, and Se concentrations were found to be 78.41, 5.42, 5.38, and 10.79% in atomic percent determined from EDS elemental analysis. This is comparable to those previously reported MPA-capped QDs which demonstrated a high surface loading on the TiO2 surface.46 After attachment of the QD sensitizers, QDSCs were fabricated (experimental details can be found in the ESI†). Fig. S5† displays the J–V curve of the ensuing CISe QDSCs, an optimized particle size of ∼5 nm was determined exhibiting short-circuit current density (Jsc) = 14.41 mA cm−2, open voltage (Voc) = 0.54 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.56, and the overall power conversion efficiency of 4.36%.

In summary, a robust and efficient noninjection phosphine-free strategy was introduced to prepare monodisperse CuInSe2 QDs, which is characterized by a high chemical yield and versatile gram-scale synthesis at reaction temperatures lower than 200 °C. By simply adjusting the amount of DDT used in the synthesis, the particle size of the resulting CISe QDs can be readily controlled over a wide range from ∼2 nm to ∼10 nm, and their intrinsic optoelectronic properties can thus be facilely tuned. More significantly, the proposed amine-thiol route to phosphine-free reactive Se precursors may enable more kinds of selenide nanocrystals to realize a large-scale synthesis.
