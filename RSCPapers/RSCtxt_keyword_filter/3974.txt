1. Introduction
As a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technology, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable interest due to organic semiconducting materials possessing the superiorities of light weight, low cost, easy fabrication, high mechanical flexibility and good semitransparency.1–3 According to the material composition of the BHJ active layer, generally reported OPVs can be classified into all-polymer based OPVs, polymer/small molecule based OPVs and all-small-molecule OPVs (SMPVs). Polymer materials inherently have varied molecular weight and polydispersity index in different batches, which is unfavorable for performance reproducibility of polymer based OPVs. Meanwhile, polymer materials have tunable solution-processed properties by using side-chain or end-group engineering; the molecular arrangement of a polymer can be further optimized by employing different solvents, additives and thermal annealing treatments.4,5 Small molecular materials have some unique merits such as well-defined chemical structures and pre-eminent batch-to-batch replicability.6–9 In the past few years, great efforts were carried out on small molecular materials and polymer materials due to their intrinsic advantages and disadvantages, and most of the efficient OPVs were prepared with a polymer as the donor and a small molecular material as the acceptor. It is a great challenge to prepare efficient all-polymer or all-small-molecule based OPVs. For SMPVs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been enhanced from 5% to 17% due to the developments in materials and device engineering. Fullerene derivatives were extensively used as electron acceptors, leading to the highest PCE of 11% of SMPVs.10,11 The relatively low PCE is mainly ascribed to the weak light absorption ability in the visible light range and difficult tunable energy levels of fullerene derivatives with an ellipsoidal structure.12–15 In 2015, Zhan's team successfully reported a series of non-fullerene fused-ring electron acceptor materials with strong visible-near infrared absorption and adjustable energy levels, which has greatly promoted the development of OPVs.16–19 In 2019, a non-fullerene acceptor Y6 (ref. 20) with an A–D′A′D–A structure reported by Zou et al. and its derivatives such as BO-4F,21 BO-4Cl,22 BTP-eC9 (ref. 23) and N3,24 have elevated the rapid development of OPVs to a higher level. Recently, many excellent studies on polymer based OPVs were reported with a PCE over 17.5%,25–30 and an exciting value of 19% has been achieved by Hou's group.31 Very recently, Hou's group reported a PCE of 17% in SMPVs enabled by nanoscale phase separation with a hierarchical branched structure.32 The PCE of SMPVs still lags behind that of polymer based OPVs, resulting from a relatively low fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (JSC). The inferior performance of SMPVs should be basically ascribed to the less matched donor–acceptor materials and the undesirable morphology of active layers, leading to inferior exciton dissociation and/or charge transport and extraction. It is necessary to make a comprehensive summary on typical development to further improve the performance of SMPVs from material synthesis and device engineering.
As the core layer of OPVs, the active layer enables photon absorption and photoelectron conversion. Active layer materials play the most-crucial role in determining the performance of OPVs. Rational chemical structure modification of active layer materials is an effective method to promote the performance of OPVs.33–36 In addition to the development of non-fullerene acceptor materials, the innovation of small molecular donor materials is also responsible for the encouraging progress in SMPVs. For better matching with a small molecular acceptor, the chemical structure of small molecular donor materials has been finely modified to adjust their optical and electrical properties as well as molecular arrangement, crystalline and aggregation properties.37–39 Many studies on chemical structure modification of small molecular donor materials have been carried out to finely tuning conjugated backbones, rationally changing side chains, and suitably varying the substituents, which have brought remarkable achievements on the development of SMPVs. For instance, Lu's team achieved a novel molecule BTR-Cl by substituting an alkyl side chain of the BTR molecule with a chlorine atom, which leads to a significantly improved PCE from 10.67% to 13.61% in the SMPVs with Y6 as the acceptor.37 Hou's team developed a novel molecule B1 by changing the side group of BTR from thiophene to phenyl units, enabling a considerably enhanced PCE from 10.4% to 15.3 in the SMPVs with BO-4Cl as the acceptor.40 Wei and co-workers reported a new molecule ZR1 with a larger coplanar core and an extended conjugation length, achieving a high PCE of 14.34% in the ZR1:Y6 based SMPVs.41 The performance of SMPVs can be further improved from the device engineering aspect, including active layer treatment and device structure optimization.42–45 Active layer treatment directly influences the molecular arrangement and phase separation of donor:acceptor materials. The generally used treatment methods include solvent additives, thermal annealing (TA) and solvent vapor annealing (SVA).41,46,47 Our laboratory previously reported a new active layer treatment method, named up-side-down TA (DTA) and up-side-down SVA (DSVA), which can not only maintain the advantages of TA or SVA treatment, but also optimize vertical phase separation driven by the gravity and capillary forces during the up-side-down drying process of active layers.47 The PCE of DRCN5T:PC71BM based SMPVs can be markedly enhanced from 3.63% in the pristine SMPVs to 9.11% in the DTA + DSVA based SMPVs. Recently, Min's team proposed a two-step solvent treatment (TSST) strategy, that is, using chlorobenzene combined with UV-ozone to treat the surface of ITO and employing methanol to treat active layers.48 The TSST strategy based interfacial layer-free SMPVs achieve a near 7% PCE enhancement compared to that of the corresponding SMPVs with two interfacial layers. The ternary strategy has been verified as an effective and simple device structure optimization strategy, which has the potential in enhancing photon harvesting, optimizing molecular arrangement and phase separation, decreasing energy loss and improving device stability.49–52 Ternary SMPVs have achieved impressive progress, such as the 16.28% PCE of B1:BO-4Cl:Y7 based SMPVs reported by An et al.53 and the 17.0% PCE of B1:BO-4Cl:BO-2Cl based SMPVs reported by Hou and co-workers.32
In this review, the recent development of SMPVs are systemically introduced and discussed from donor material innovation and device engineering aspects. The studies of small molecular donor material innovation are classified with the central core units and evolving chemical structures, and aim to elucidate the effect of chemical structures on material properties and performance of SMPVs. The molecular arrangement and phase separation degree of active layers strongly depend on material properties, using solvents and solvent additives, as well as active layer treatment methods, as introduced in the materials section. In the section of device engineering, we introduce the ternary strategy and device structure for performance improvement of SMPVs. Finally, the factors impeding SMPVs' PCE improvement are addressed, and the perspectives on future research are provided for developing high performance SMPVs.
2. Molecular engineering for SMPVs
Molecular engineering is a fundamental and effective way to manipulate the performance of SMPVs. Proper molecular structure design can well optimize materials’ optical and electrical properties, molecular arrangement, crystalline and aggregation properties, as well as the stability of photovoltaic devices. Small molecular materials have achieved significant development in the past decade. Among small molecular donors, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDT)-central core based small molecules are the most popular class enabling high PCE of SMPVs. Other central core based small molecules also perform well in fabricating efficient SMPVs. Here, the development of small molecular donors is systematically reviewed according to the varied central cores. Small molecular acceptors used in SMPVs mainly include fullerene derivatives (PC61BM, PC71BM, and IC60BA), ITIC series molecules (ITIC, IDIC, IT-4F, IDIC-4F/4Cl and so on) and Y6 series molecules (Y6, N3, BO-4F/4Cl and so on). Of note is that highly efficient SMPVs were obtained based on Y6 series acceptor molecules. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of small molecular acceptors mentioned in this review.

2.1 Oligothiophene based small molecular donors
Besides possessing high stability and excellent charge transport properties, oligothiophenes with well-defined structures enable a relatively simple and low-cost synthesis. Fig. 3 shows the chemical structures of oligothiophene based small molecular donors in recent reports. As an important molecular engineering method, end-group engineering can well adjust molecular solubility, energy levels, packings and miscibility with other molecules. Based on end-group engineering, oligothiophene based small molecular donors have achieved great improvement. In 2011, Liu et al. reported three oligothiophene based small molecules namely DCAE7T, DCAO7T and DCAEH7T, terminated with ethyl cyanoacetate units, octyl cyanoacetate units and 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate units, respectively.54 Corresponding SMPVs were built with PC61BM as the acceptor, and all delivered PCEs over 4%. The DCAO7T based SMPVs yielded a PCE of 5.08% and an IPCE of 67% without any special treatment. The 5.08% PCE was the highest value for solution processed SMPVs at that time. Considering the limited light absorption of the cyanoacetate unit, Li et al. introduced a 3-ethylrhodanine dye unit to modify DCAO7T and synthesized a novel molecule DERHD7T.55 As expected, DERHD7T exhibits a strengthened light absorption coefficient in the visible light range. A record-breaking PCE of 6.10% was achieved in DERHD7T:PC61BM based SMPVs, indicating the great potential of a rhodanine terminal unit in developing excellent small molecular donors. He et al. synthesized DTDMP7T and D2R(8+2)7T with 1,3-dimethylpyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione and double rhodanine as the terminal units, respectively.56 DCAO7T, DERHD7T, DTDMP7T and D2R(8+2)7T have similar chemical structures with one only difference on the terminal units. DTDMP7T and D2R(8+2)7T molecules hardly formed well-ordered packing in films in comparison to DCAO7T and DERHD7T, resulting in a dramatically lower hole mobility of DTDMP7T and D2R(8+2)7T films. Relatively low PCEs of 4.05% and 2.46% were obtained for DTDMP7T:PC61BM and D2R(8+2)7T:PC61BM based SMPVs, respectively. Subsequently, Zhang et al. designed and synthesized DRCN7T by substituting the thio groups on the terminal units of DERHD7T with dicyanomethylene units, which was expected to enhance light absorption due to the strong electron-accepting ability of the dicyanomethylene unit.57 DRCN7T presents a lower optical bandgap as well as wider and overall stronger photon harvesting ability in contrast to DERHD7T. An optimized PCE of 9.30% was delivered in the DRCN7T:PC71BM based SMPVs, with significantly enhanced EQE and IQE values relative to the DERHD7T:PC71BM based SMPVs. The better performance of DRCN7T:PC71BM based SMPVs can be attributed to the formation of optimized nanoscale interpenetrating network morphology with ∼10 nm donor crystalline fibrils (Fig. 2a), leading to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection in the active layers. By varying the numbers of alkylthiophene units on backbones, Kan et al. developed DRCN4T–DRCN9T with varied conjugation lengths and different spatial symmetries between these small molecules.58 DRCN4T presents a low absorption coefficient in solution and a narrow absorption range in films compared to those of DRCN5T–DRCN9T. DRCN5T neat films present a broader absorption with a distinct absorption peak shoulder at 685 nm, inferring more effective molecular packing between molecular backbones. The HOMO levels can be gradually enhanced with the increase of conjugation length (Fig. 2b). SMPVs with a conventional device structure were fabricated by using PC71BM as the acceptor. The DRCN4T based SMPVs exhibited a PCE of 0.24% due to the poor quality of blend films with PC71BM. A remarkable PCE of 10.10% was achieved in the DRCN5T:PC71BM based SMPVs, which was the highest value for single-junction SMPVs at that time. Interestingly, the SMPVs based on structurally axisymmetric DRCN5T, DRCN7T and DRCN9T yielded larger PCE values compared to those based on structurally centrosymmetric DRCN4T, DRCN6T and DRCN8T, as exhibited in Fig. 2c. The VOC of SMPVs with PC71BM as the acceptor and DRCNxT (x = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) as the donor respectively was slightly decreased due to the gradually increased HOMO level dependence on the number of alkylthiophene units. The JSC of SMPVs with PC71BM as the acceptor and DRCNxT (x = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) as the donor respectively and dipole moment change (Δμge) dependence on the number of alkylthiophene units are displayed in Fig. 2d. Clearly, the SMPVs based on DRCN5T, DRCN7T and DRCN9T exhibited much larger JSC values in contrast to those based on DRCN6T and DRCN8T, which is consistent with the variation of dipole moment change (Δμge). The large Δμge can lower the coulombic binding energy of an exciton, expecting to facilitate intramolecular charge dissociation and contribute to high JSC. The conjugation length of the backbone can strongly influence the morphology of blend films. The DRCN5T, DRCN7T and DRCN9T based blend films exhibited bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology with less than 20 nm fibril-like structures. The DRCN6T and DRCN8T based blend films displayed about 40 nm domains, which is disadvantageous to the exciton dissociation. This work is a successful case of using simple structure donor molecules to fabricate highly efficient SMPVs.

Halogenation effect has been confirmed as an efficient strategy for designing efficient photovoltaic materials. Lu's group developed three difluorinated small molecules D5T2F-P, D5T2F-S and D5T2F-T by using –F atoms to symmetrically replace two –H atoms at varied positions on the π-backbone of DRCN5T.59 The photophysical and electrochemical properties are shown in Fig. 2e. The three isomers exhibit blue-shifted absorption peaks in solutions and films in comparison to DRCN5T. And the absorption peak of D5T2F-P is more red-shifted compared to the other two isomers. The HOMO levels are decreased from −5.24 eV of D5T2F-T to −5.29 eV of D5T2F-S and then to −5.34 eV of D5T2F-P and deeper than −5.15 eV of DRCN5T. D5T2F-P possesses a smaller exciton binding energy in the charge transfer state and local excited state compared to those of D5T2F-S and D5T2F-T, which can facilitate exciton dissociation and hinder charge recombination. A series of SMPVs were prepared with the three isomers and DRCN5T as donors and IDIC-4F as acceptors to study the influence of varied –F substitutional positions on photovoltaic properties, respectively. The centrally fluorinated D5T2F-P based SMPVs demonstrated the highest PCE of 9.36%, over 16% enhancement in comparison to the PCE of 8.03% for DRCN5T based SMPVs. The improved PCE of D5T2F-P based SMPVs should be attributed to the improved miscibility with IDIC-4F and the down-shifted HOMO levels of D5T2F-P. The D5T2F-S and D5T2F-T based SMPVs exhibited relatively low PCEs of 6.11% and 5.42% due to the unfavorable active layer morphology. Lu's group also developed halogenated 2F7T and 2Cl7T by symmetrically substituting two –H atoms on the central thienyl moiety of DRCN7T with –F and –Cl atoms, respectively.60 2F7T and 2Cl7T show deeper HOMO levels and a slightly larger optical bandgap than DRCN7T due to the halogenation effect. A series of SMPVs with 0.11 cm2 device area were built with Y6 as the acceptor and 2F7T, 2Cl7T and DRCN7T as donors, respectively. Enhanced PCE values of 9.41% and 11.45% were respectively achieved in 2F7T:Y6 and 2Cl7T:Y6 based SMPVs, with simultaneously enhanced JSC, VOC and FF values compared to those of DRCN7T:Y6 based SMPVs exhibiting a PCE of 2.48%. Fig. 2f shows AFM and TEM images of the three blend films. It is apparent that DRCN7T:Y6 blend films delivered an oversized phase separation with strong self-aggregation (RMS of 9.92 nm). 2Cl7T:Y6 films and 2F7T:Y6 films exhibited a uniform surface (RMSs of 1.58 nm and 1.28 nm). The uniform surface morphology in 2Cl7T:Y6 and 2F7T:Y6 films should result from good molecular miscibility between 2F7T or 2Cl7T with Y6, which can be also confirmed from the GIWAXS results. Besides the more suitable energy levels, the chlorinated donor 2Cl7T achieved optimal balance between miscibility and crystallinity with Y6 in blend films, accounting for the impressive PCE of 11.45%. This work gives similar conclusion on the application of Cl or F substitutions for designing small molecular donors for achieving high performance SMPVs.
2.2 Benzodithiophene-central core based small molecular donors
As the most popular central core unit used in small molecular donors, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDT) unit possesses a symmetric and rigid planar conjugated structure, which benefits the electron delocalization and π–π stacking in the solid state, thus leading to excellent charge transport in devices.61–64 With continuous efforts on molecular design, BDT-central core based small molecular donors have achieved remarkable advancements for preparing highly efficient SMPVs.

2.2.1 DR3TSBDT and related donor molecules. 
Compared to the thiophene unit, the BDT unit has a large and rigid planar conjugated structure, which can cause a strong intermolecular orbital overlap. Fig. 4 shows the chemical structures of DR3TSBDT and related donor molecules in recent reports. Using the BDT unit to replace the central thiophene unit in the molecule DCAO7T, a novel molecule DCAO3T(BDT)3T with a large optical bandgap and high hole mobility is obtained.65 The DCAO3T(BDT)3T:PC61BM based SMPVs realized over 7% PCE improvement compared to that of DCAO7T based SMPVs. Zhou et al. synthesized two small molecular donors DCAO3TBDT and DR3TBDT with different terminal units of octyl cyanoacetate and 3-ethylrhodanine, respectively.66 Compared with DCAO3TBDT, DR3TBDT displays a relatively large absorption coefficient and a relatively narrow band gap due to the rhodanine effect. A series of binary SMPVs were fabricated by using PC61BM or PC71BM as the acceptor, respectively. The SMPVs based on DCAO3TBDT:PC61BM (1:0.5, wt/wt) exhibited an optimized PCE of 4.56%, with a JSC of 8.00 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.95 V and an FF of 60.0%. The SMPVs based on DR3TBDT:PC61BM (1:0.8, wt/wt) yielded an optimized PCE of 6.38%, with a JSC of 10.78 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.91 V and an FF of 65.0%. A reduced PCE of 2.09% was obtained in the DCAO3TBDT:PC71BM (1:0.5, wt/wt) based SMPVs, mainly resulting from a decreased JSC of 3.74 mA cm−2. An improved PCE of 6.92% was achieved in the DR3TBDT:PC71BM (1:0.8, wt/wt) based SMPVs, mainly due to an increased JSC of 11.40 mA cm−2. Better morphology with a more evenly distributed domain size of 20–30 nm was achieved in DR3TBDT:PC61BM and DR3TBDT:PC71BM based blend films. The relatively high JSC of DR3TBDT based SMPVs can be well interpreted from the larger absorption coefficient of DR3TBDT and the better morphology of DR3TBDT based blend films. Excessive phase separation was found in DCAO3TBDT based blend films. The domain size was about 80 nm and over 100 nm for the DCAO3TBDT:PC61BM and DCAO3TBDT:PC71BM blend films, respectively. The oversized domains of DCAO3TBDT:PC71BM blend films result in the deteriorated exciton dissociation and charge transport, which can well explain the decreased JSC of the DCAO3TBDT:PC71BM based SMPVs. The PCE of the DR3TBDT:PC71BM based SMPVs was further improved to 7.38% by adding 0.2 mg mL−1 PDMS additive, which was a record-breaking PCE value at that time.

Side chain engineering such as alkylthio side chain engineering and 2D side chain engineering was successfully applied to modifying molecule DR3TBDT for improving the performance of SMPVs. Using a sulfur atom to replace an oxygen atom in the side chains of DR3TBDT, Kan et al. synthesized a novel molecule DR3TSBDT.67 DR3TSBDT demonstrates similar optical properties to those of DR3TBDT but a higher absorption coefficient in solution. The HOMO level of DR3TSBDT is slightly deeper than that of DR3TBDT. The as-cast SMPVs based on DR3TSBDT:PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 6.62%, with a JSC of 12.32 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.96 V and an FF of 56%. An increased PCE of 7.99% was achieved after TA treatment at 100 °C for 10 min, resulting from a JSC of 13.41 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.96 V and a FF of 62%. The PCE was further increased to 9.95% after TA treatment at 100 °C for 10 min and then chloroform vapor treatment for 60 s, resulting from a JSC of 14.61 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.92 V and a FF of 74%. The increased JSC and FF of the SMPVs with post-treatment originated from the strengthened absorption, improved morphology, enhanced and more balanced carrier mobilities. Two-dimensional (2D) side chains on the BDT central core can enable donor materials with stronger intermolecular interactions, better charge transport ability and broader absorption compared to the materials with one-dimensional side chains on the BDT central core. Zhou et al. changed the alkoxy side chains on DR3TBDT into alkylthienyl conjugated side chains and developed a series of molecules named DR3TBDTT, DR3TBDTT-HD and DR3TBDT2T.68 2-Ethylhexyl or 2-hexyldecyl was adopted on the side thiophene unit for better solubility. The three molecules show red-shifted absorption compared to DR3TBDT, thanks to the larger conjugation from the thiophene units. DR3TBDTT possesses the lowest band gap compared to those of DR3TBDT, DR3TBDTT-HD and DR3TBDT2T. The three molecules exhibit similar HOMO levels estimated from CV curves and LUMO levels to those of DR3TBDT. The optimized SMPVs based on the three novel donors were also achieved under the conditions of donor:PC71BM (1:0.8, wt/wt) and 0.2 mg mL−1 PDMS additive. DR3TBDTT and DR3TBD2T based SMPVs obtained increased PCEs of 8.12% and 8.02% compared to that of the DR3TBDT based SMPVs. DR3TBDTT-HD based SMPVs exhibited a decreased PCE of 6.79%, which might be ascribed to the bulk effect of long alkyl chains leading to lower hole mobility and poor active layer morphology. This work suggests that introducing 2D side chains on the BDT-central core is an effective strategy to improve donor materials. Afterwards, Cui et al. introduced an additional sulfur atom on the alkylthienyl conjugated side chains of DR3TBDTT.69 The novel 2D-conjugated small molecule was named BDTT-S-TR. BDTT-S-TR exhibits a down-shifted HOMO level and increased hole mobility compared to those of DR3TBDTT due to the alkylthio side chain effect. When blended with acceptor PC71BM (1:0.8, wt/wt), a maximum PCE of 9.20% with a VOC of 0.97 V was obtained for the active layers without extra treatment. Meanwhile, the SMPVs exhibited good tolerance on the active layer thickness. The SMPVs with a 300 nm active layer can still afford a high PCE of 7.58% without extra treatment. Benefiting from the thickness-insensitive and extra-treatment-free photovoltaic properties of BDTT-S-TR, an encouraging PCE of 6.68% is realized in the SMPVs with an active area of 1.44 cm2.
End-group engineering was also used to modify the molecule DR3TBDTT. Liu et al. synthesized a small molecule SMPV1 with 3-octylrodanine as the terminal unit, while keeping the other chemical structures same as that of DR3TBDTT.70 The best performing single junction SMPVs based on SMPV1:PC71BM (1:0.8, wt/wt) with 0.5 mg mL−1 PDMS delivered a PCE of 8.1%, along with a JSC of 12.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.94 V and a FF of 69%. SMPV1:PC71BM based tandem SMPVs were further fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMPV1:PC71BM/CPE1/CPE2/M-PEDOT:PSS/SMPV1:PC71BM/CPE3/Al. A PCE of 10.1% with ∼25% improvement was achieved in the optimized tandem SMPVs, with a JSC of 7.70 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.82 V and a very notable FF of 72%. This work points out the great potential of the 2D-conjugated small molecules as well as the tandem device for high performance SMPVs. Duan et al. employed esterified rhodanine with a branching or linear alkyl chain to modify the end-group of DR3TBDTT and synthesized BDT-RO and BDT-RN.71 Compared to the DR3TBDTT:IDIC based SMPVs under the same conditions delivering a PCE of 7.6%, higher PCEs of 9.01% and 8.36% were achieved in BDT-RO and BDT-RN based SMPVs, inferring that an esterified rhodanine unit should be a promising terminal unit in small molecular donors.


2.2.2 BTR and related donor molecules. 
Small molecule benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR) is also a successful donor material, consisting of a BDT unit, two terthiophenes and two rhodanine groups.72 A series of excellent small molecular donors such as BTR-Cl and B1 are derived from BTR. Fig. 6 shows the chemical structures of BTR and related donor molecules in recent reports, and around half of high-performance SMPVs with a PCE over 13% are realized based on the derivatives of BTR. BTR possesses shortened side chains compared with those of DR3TBDTT and SMPV1, and the side chains were strategically placed on the terthiophene building blocks, inducing strong intermolecular interactions. A hole mobility up to 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is achieved due to the strong intermolecular interactions. BTR exhibits a solubility of 211 mg mL−1 and an absorption coefficient of 1.10 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in chloroform. The HOMO and LUMO levels of BTR are −5.34 and −3.52 eV, respectively. A PCE of 9.3% with a FF of 77% was realized in SMPVs with BTR:PC71BM as the active layers under AM 1.5G light illumination. It should be highlighted that a PCE of about 8% with an FF of about 70% can still be afforded by the SMPVs with an active layer thickness up to 400 nm. This work demonstrates that BTR with high crystallinity is one of the promising materials for large scale OPVs prepared by roll-to-roll technology.
Upon employing π-bridge engineering for BTR, Dong et al. developed two novel molecules BIHTR and BOHTR.73 Compared to BOHTR with “outward” hexyl chains, the BIHTR with “inward” hexyl chains displays enhanced molecular aggregation and improved molecular stacking due to strengthened molecular planarity. SMPVs were fabricated with Y6 as the acceptor. The BOHTR based SMPVs obtained an optimized PCE of 10.8%, and the BIHTR based SMPVs achieved an optimized PCE of 12.3%. The PCE difference between BOHTR and BIHTR based SMPVs resulted from the different VOC of 0.83 V vs. 0.84 V, JSC of 23.1 mA cm−2vs. 21.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 56.2% vs. 68.4%, respectively. The slightly higher VOC of BIHTR based SMPVs should be attributed to the slightly deeper HOMO level of BIHTR. The relatively low JSC and relatively high FF of BIHTR based SMPVs indicate a relatively weak photon harvesting capability in the BIHTR:Y6 active layers, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of blend films. The relatively high FF of BIHTR based SMPVs should have resulted from the weaker recombination, more balanced charge transport, more efficient charge extraction and more favorable morphology. This work demonstrates that varying the alkyl chain on the π-bridge to adjust the molecular planarity and intermolecular interaction is a bright approach to tuning active layer morphology.
Most efforts on modifying BTR were devoted to side chain engineering. Chen et al. employed two chlorine atoms to substitute two hexyl side chains on the side thiophene units of BTR for obtaining a new donor molecule BTR-Cl.37 BTR-Cl possesses deeper HOMO/LUMO levels of −5.46/−3.70 eV than BTR. A larger absorption redshift from the solution state to the film state infers stronger intermolecular interactions of BTR-Cl. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results demonstrate that BTR-Cl has enhanced phase transition temperatures compared to BTR, suggesting strengthened crystallinity and intermolecular interaction of BTR-Cl, as shown in Fig. 5a. The intensity distribution of (010) diffraction signals of neat films is presented in Fig. 5b. The results of crystallite distribution also support the strengthened intermolecular interactions of BTR-Cl. The material Y6 was adopted as the acceptor with BTR or BTR-Cl as the donor to fabricate SMPVs due to the well-matched energy levels and complementary photon harvesting range between Y6 and BTR or BTR-Cl. Compared to the PCE of 10.67% in the BTR:Y6 based SMPVs, an improved PCE of 13.61% was achieved in the BTR-Cl:Y6 based SMPVs, resulting from a simultaneously increased VOC of 0.86 V vs. 0.85 V, JSC of 24.17 mA cm−2vs. 22.25 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.5% vs. 56.4%. It is worth mentioning that the PCE of 13.61% was a record-breaking value at that time. The superior PCE of BTR-Cl:Y6 based SMPVs was mainly attributed to the more ordered bimodal π–π stacking and more distinct phase separation. This work is typical of improving SMPVs through designing highly ordered liquid crystalline donor materials. Subsequently, Tang et al. introduced a concentration-induced morphology manipulation strategy to further promote the performance of BTR-Cl:Y6 based SMPVs.74 Solutions with different concentrations (low: 16 mg mL−1; medium: 18 mg mL−1; high: 20 mg mL−1) were prepared to fabricate active layers with the same thickness. A remarkable PCE of 14.7% with a significantly boosted FF of 74.7% was demonstrated by slightly increasing the solution concentration to 18 mg mL−1. The PCE improvement mainly originates from the enhanced photon harvesting (Fig. 5c), reduced trap-assistant recombination, increased crystallinity and optimized phase-separation network. This strategy could be an effective approach to control active layer morphology for achieving high-efficiency SMPVs. The BTR-Cl based SMPVs achieved a PCE of 14.43% by using N3 as the acceptor and combining solid additive IC-FI.75 Compared to the PCE of 13.36% in the SMPVs without additive IC-FI, the PCE enhancement originated from the significantly enhanced FF of 73.5% from 64.7%. Comprehensive investigations signified that the additive IC-FI treated active layers obtain a well-distributed microstructure (Fig. 5d) with remarkably enhanced π-face-on oriented packing, contributing to more effective charge transport with less recombination loss. Chen et al. further synthesized BT-RO-Cl and BT-REH-Cl, two isomeric small molecular donors with linear n-octyl (O) and branched 2-ethylhexyl (EH) as terminal alkyl chains, respectively.76 BT-RO-Cl and BT-REH-Cl have similar molecular energy levels, photon harvesting abilities and thermal stabilities. BT-REH-Cl presents better solubility and more ordered molecular stacking orientation compared to BT-RO-Cl. BT-RO-Cl and BT-REH-Cl based SMPVs obtained PCEs of 13.35% and 13.90% with Y6 as the acceptor, respectively, which should be attributed to the uniform phase separation and fluent 3D charge transport channels in active layers.

Substituting the thiophene side groups of BTR with phenyl units, a novel small molecular donor named B1 without liquid crystalline properties was developed by Qin and coworkers.40 The 2D GIWAXS images of neat B1 and BTR films reveal that the molecular arrangement is changed from face-on molecular orientation in neat BTR films to edge-on molecular orientation in neat B1 films, as shown in Fig. 5e. The absorption spectra and energy levels of B1 are very comparable to those of BTR. The structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:BO-4Cl/PFN-Br/Al was employed to fabricate SMPVs with B1 or BTR as the donor, exhibiting a comparable VOC of 0.83 V. The B1 based SMPVs delivered an optimized PCE of 15.3% with a JSC of 25.27 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73%, outperforming the BTR based SMPVs with an optimized PCE of 10.4%, a JSC of 18.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67%. Considering the comparable photon harvesting characteristics, the improved JSC and FF in B1 based SMPVs should be attributed to enhanced exciton dissociation, reduced bimolecular recombination, increased balance of charge transport and improved morphology. Min et al. reported interfacial layer-free SMPVs with B1:BTP-eC9 as active layers by employing a two-step solvent treatment (TSST) strategy,48 as shown in Fig. 5f. Chlorobenzene combined with UV-ozone was used to treat the surface of ITO for improving surface energy and down-shifting the work function (Fig. 5g). Methanol was employed to passivate interfacial traps of active layers. The optimal interfacial layer-free SMPVs achieved a PCE of 14.86% with a near 7% enhancement compared to the PCE of 13.92% in SMPVs with two interfacial layers, which is ascribed to the enhanced photon harvesting capability and more effective exciton dissociation, charge transport and extraction in the TSST strategy based interfacial layer-free SMPVs. An and co-workers proposed a portfolio strategy of warm solution and SVA to subtly manipulate the B1:BTP-eC9 active layer morphology.77 The homogeneous and imporous blend films can be obtained by employing the warm solution strategy, and molecular aggregation can be restrained during the film forming process. Employing SVA can further adjust the molecular arrangement and phase separation of blend films. The PCE of B1:BTP-eC9 based SMPVs can be enhanced to 15.68% by adopting this portfolio strategy, which is higher than the 13.47% of the SVA treated SMPVs. Meanwhile, the warm solution and SVA portfolio strategy based SMPVs delivered better stability than the SVA treated SMPVs. This result demonstrated that this new portfolio strategy of warm solution and SVA should be valuable for modulating the morphology of small molecule blend films.
Also based on side chain engineering for BTR, Su et al. developed three small molecules named FYSM-H, FYSM-Si and FYSM-SiCl with alkyl, trialkylsilyl and both trialkylsilyl and a Cl atom attached to the thienyl BDT core, respectively.38 Sequentially down-shifted HOMO levels and enhanced hole mobilities are obtained for FYSM-H, FYSM-Si and FYSM-SiCl, respectively. Meanwhile, the molecular orientation is changed from edge-on to face-on with improved crystallinity by introducing trialkylsilyl and Cl atom substituents. FYSM-SiCl:Y6 based SMPVs presented a higher PCE of 13.4%, benefiting from a higher JSC of 23.7 mA cm−2, a higher VOC of 0.85 V and a higher FF of 66.8% compared to those of FYSM-H:Y6 and FYSM-Si:Y6 based SMPVs. The better performance of FYSM-SiCl:Y6 based SMPVs was attributed to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection. Chen's team designed and synthesized small molecules S35, S35-1Si and S35-2Si by substituting the alkylthiophene side groups of BTR with 3,5-difluorophenyl units with different numbers of siloxane-terminated side chains.78 The introduction of siloxane-terminated side chain exhibits ignorable influence upon the optical bandgap and absorption coefficients. And all three small molecules deliver edge-on dominated orientations in neat films. In comparison with S35 and S35-1Si, S35-2Si with two siloxane-terminated side chains exhibits stronger crystallization ability, lower surface energy, higher hole mobility and modulated molecular orientation. When blended with the Y6 acceptor, the S35 and S35-1Si based blend films obtained bimodal orientations of face-on and edge-on while the S35-2Si based blend films delivered pure face-on orientation. The S35-2Si based blend films achieved more favorable morphology for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. A PCE of 13.50% was afforded by the S35-2Si:Y6 based SMPVs, higher than the 11.95% of S35:Y6 based SMPVs and the 12.19% of S35-1Si:Y6 based SMPVs. This work is the first introduction of the siloxane-terminated side chain into small molecular donors to manipulate molecular orientation and control BHJ morphology, which could provide a guideline for designing efficient small molecular donors.
An analogue of BTR named BSFTR was synthesized by combining side chain engineering and end-group engineering, that is, using a fluorine atom to replace the n-hexyl chain on the side thiophene unit on the BDT core, introducing sulfur atom in the 2-ethylhexyl side chain, and changing the n-hexyl chain on the rhodamine unit into 2-ethylhexyl chain.79 When blending BSFTR with a strong crystalline acceptor NBDTP-Fout, the blend films display well-interpenetrated network morphology, which favors efficient charge transport and suppressed charge recombination. The BSFTR:NBDTP-Fout based SMPVs realized a PCE of 11.97% by employing PDINO as the cathode interfacial layer. Remarkably, an enhanced PCE of 12.26% was obtained in the SMPVs without a cathode interfacial layer. Combined analyses demonstrated that the favorable energetic alignment at the active layer/Al interface and the formation of fine electrical contact at such interfaces are two key factors for achieving efficient cathode interfacial layer-free SMPVs. Subsequently, Yue et al. employed the star acceptor molecule Y6 and the ZrAcac cathode interfacial layer to fabricate BSFTR based SMPVs.80 With the help of SVA + TA treatments, the SMPVs achieved an optimal PCE of 13.69% with a rather low Eloss of 0.48 eV. Another small molecule BDT3TR-SF having a similar chemical structure to BSFTR was also synthesized and blended with two isomers NBDTP-Fin and NBDTP-Fout to construct SMPVs, respectively.81 The BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout based SMPVs exhibited a PCE of 11.2%, while BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fin based SMPVs yielded a PCE of 0.02%. It was found that the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fin blend has a smaller Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (2.91) than that (3.62) of the BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout blend, suggesting a higher miscibility between BDT3TR-SF and NBDTP-Fin. As a result, BDT3TR-SF:NBDTP-Fout blend films exhibited excessive mixed phase separation morphology, leading to insufficient charge transport and collection.


2.2.3 SM1 and related donor molecules. 
SM1 (also named DCAO3TBDTT) and its derivatives contribute greatly to the development of high performance SMPVs, and a PCE up to 15.39% was realized in the SM1 derivative BT-2F based SMPVs.82Fig. 8 shows the chemical structures of SM1 and related donor molecules in recent reports. In 2017, Qiu et al. reported two small molecules SM1 and SM2 with weak electron-withdrawing ester terminal units: SM1 with a cyano unit (CN) on the ester unit and SM2 without the CN unit.83 SM1 presents red-shifted and strengthened photon harvesting, a down-shifted HOMO level and increased hole mobility in contrast to SM2. The SM1:IDIC based SMPVs exhibited higher photovoltaic performance than the SM2:IDIC based SMPVs. The PCE of SM1:IDIC based SMPVs was boosted from 5.45% (as-cast) to 10.11% by TA treatment, which should be attributed to the significantly improved active layer morphology by TA treatment, as seen in the PiFM images of SM1:IDIC blend films in Fig. 7a. For the as-cast SM1:IDIC blend films, both SM1 and IDIC distribute evenly over the whole image without distinct phase separation. Distinct phase separation (∼20 nm) was formed by TA treatment, inferring the formation of interpenetrating networks for charge transport in the SM1:IDIC active layers with TA treatment at 115 °C for 10 min.

Side chain engineering also plays a significant role in modifying SM1, which mainly includes introducing Si or S atoms in alkyl side chains, introducing halogen F atoms in side thiophene units and varying alkyl side chains. Bin et al. synthesized H22 by changing the alkylthio side chains of SM1 into alkylsilyl-thienyl conjugated side chains.84 Another molecule H21 terminated with 3-ethylrhodanine units was also synthesized as a reference. Relative to H21, H22 exhibits a more complementary photon harvesting range with IDIC and more suitable energy levels due to the potentially larger VOC and larger driving force for exciton dissociation. The H22:IDIC based blend films demonstrate a better 3D charge pathway (Fig. 7b) and more favorable crystalline properties and thus higher electron and hole mobilities in comparison with H21:IDIC based blend films. The H22:IDIC based SMPVs yielded an outstanding PCE of 10.29% compared to the PCE of 7.62% in H21:IDIC based SMPVs. Ge et al. reported BTEC-1F and BTEC-2F with fluorinated thiophene on the side chains.85 Due to the fluorination effect, gradually down-shifted HOMO levels are obtained with an increased number of fluorine atoms from DCAO3TBDTT to BTEC-1F and to BTEC-2F. When combined with Y6 to fabricate SMPVs, the PCEs of SMPVs can be successively increased by employing DCAO3TBDTT, BTEC-1F and BTEC-2F as donors, as seen in the statistical diagram of PCEs in Fig. 7c. And the BTEC-2F:Y6 based SMPVs realized the best PCE of 13.34%. The superior performance of BTEC-2F:Y6 based SMPVs should benefit from the more ordered face-on orientation, more compact molecular stacking and the relatively coarse and large phase domains in the BTEC-2F:Y6 based blend films. Consequently, higher hole mobility and more balanced charge transport were obtained in the BTEC-2F:Y6 blend films. Subsequently, Qiu et al. synthesized small molecules SM1-S with alkylthio and SM1-F with fluorine and alkyl substituents on the thiophene conjugated side chains.86 It is noteworthy that SM1-F had just been reported as BTEC-1F by Ge and co-workers. SM1-F exhibits down-shifted HOMO levels, a blue-shifted absorption peak and stronger molecular packing ability compared to SM1 and SM1-S. The highest PCE of 14.07% was demonstrated in the SM1-F:Y6 (2.2:1, wt/wt) based SMPVs after TA treatment at 120 °C for 10 min, with a higher VOC of 0.866 V, a higher FF of 69.9% and a comparable JSC of 23.25 mA cm−2. The SM1-F:Y6 based SMPVs with a 250 nm active layer can still deliver a PCE of 11.9%, suggesting its great potential in large scale industrial production. By adjusting the alkylthio side chains of SM1-S, Guo et al. developed donors SM4, SM8 and SM12 with alkylthio side chains of increased lengths.87 Due to the bulk effect from alkylthio side chains of different lengths, loosed molecular π–π stacking and weakened molecular crystallinity and aggregation are observed for SM4, SM8 and SM12, successively (Fig. 7d). Besides, SM4, SM8 and SM12 exhibit gradually enlarged absorption coefficients and down-shifted HOMO/LUMO energy levels. Matching with acceptor material BO-4Cl, SM8 based blend films displayed appropriate morphology due to a more harmonious blend miscibility between SM8 and BO-4Cl. The SM8:BO-4Cl based SMPVs achieved a better PCE of 13.11% with higher JSC, VOC and FF values compared to those of SM4:BO-4Cl and SM12:BO-4Cl based SMPVs. A series of characterization studies on the SMPVs demonstrate that SM8:BO-4Cl based SMPVs achieved higher exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies (Fig. 7e), weaker charge recombination, and higher and more balanced charge mobilities (Fig. 7f). This work proves that reasonably regulating the lateral side chains could be an effective strategy to adjust molecular miscibility and phase separation for preparing efficient SMPVs.
A new small molecular donor BT-2F was developed by applying π-bridge engineering for BTEC-2F.88 The side alkyl chains on the terthiophene π-bridge of BT-2F were shortened from octane to hexane and arranged in a more regular manner, enabling more ordered and more compact stacking of BT-2F molecules. BT-2F:Y6 blend films exhibited favorable interpenetrating network morphology and increased hole mobility. The BT-2F:Y6 based SMPVs achieved an improved PCE of 13.80% under TA treatment relative to the 13.34% in the BTEC-2F:Y6 based SMPVs. The PCE of BT-2F based SMPVs can be further enhanced to 14.09% by using N3 as the acceptor. The high PCE of BT-2F based SMPVs with Y6 or N3 as the acceptor should be attributed to the good trade-off between high crystallinity and proper phase separation, which is an effective approach to achieving high performance SMPVs. Afterwards, the PCE of BT-2F:N3 based SMPVs was enhanced to 15.39% by adopting CS2 SVA treatment, benefiting from significantly improved active layer morphology.82 A schematic diagram of morphology evolution is shown in Fig. 7g. The functions of CS2 SVA treatment can be summarized as follows: (i) good solubility of CS2 can induce good J-aggregation and molecular interconnection; (ii) donor-selectively dissolved CS2 is conducive to optimizing the donor domain and donor interconnection, as well as reducing trap states.


2.2.4 H11 and related donor molecules. 
Different from other BDT-central core based small molecules, H11 and its derivatives (H12, H13, H14, and BDT(TVT-SR)2) are introduced with a benzotriazole unit and SM-BT-2OR and SM-BT-2F with benzothiadiazole as an electron deficient unit in π-bridges to form dual-accepting units. Fig. 9 shows the chemical structures of H11 and related donor molecules in recent reports. The benzothiadiazole unit has been widely used as an electron deficient unit due to the superiorities of the planar structure and low-lying energy level.89,90 Bin et al. designed and synthesized small molecule H11 with alkylthienyl conjugated side chains and a control small molecule H12 with alkoxy side chains.91 H11 presents a slightly higher extinction coefficient and slightly deeper energy levels than H12. When matched with acceptor IDIC, the H11 based SMPVs simultaneously exhibited higher PCE, JSC, VOC and FF than the H12 based SMPVs whether under the as-cast or TA conditions. The superior performance of H11 based SMPVs should be attributed to more ordered molecular arrangement and more favorable phase separation morphology (domain size of ∼21 nm) of the H11:IDIC based films. To reveal the underlying reason of morphology difference, Bin et al. calculated Hansen solubility parameters for evaluating the molecular miscibility. The H11:IDIC blend exhibited a higher Hansen solubility parameter (∼2.52) than that (∼2.35) of the H12:IDIC blend. According to Flory-Huggins solution theory, the H11:IDIC blend achieved stronger phase separation and lower molecular miscibility, which should be the fundamental reason of the favorable morphology of H11:IDIC blend films. The H11 and H12 based SMPVs obtained an optimal PCE of 9.73% and 5.51% under TA treatment, respectively. The significantly enhanced PCEs after TA treatment originated from the combined effects of the boosted absorption, enhanced and more balanced electron and hole mobilities, optimized phase separation and molecular arrangement. H11:IDIC based large scale (100 mm2) SMPVs can achieve a PCE of 8.52%, indicating their huge potential in application. Applying side chain engineering for H11, Guo et al. designed a new donor material namely BDT(TVT-SR)2 with alkylthio-thienylenevinylene thiophene side chains.92 BDT(TVT-SR)2 exhibits red-shifted absorption, low-lying energy levels and enhanced hole mobility relative to H11. A PCE of 5.69% was realized in the as-cast BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC based SMPVs. The PCE can be boosted to 11.10% after TA treatment, which is larger than that of H11:IDIC based SMPVs due to the simultaneously improved JSC and FF. Meanwhile, the BDT(TVT-SR)2:IDIC based SMPVs exhibited significantly enhanced photo-stability and thermal stability compared to those of H11:IDIC based SMPVs. The underlying reason could be that the extended conjugated TVT-SR side chains on the backbone reduce the thermally induced phase aggregation. Bin et al. created H13 and H14 by fluorine and chlorine substitutions on the conjugated side chains of the BDT unit, respectively.93 H13 and H14 exhibit blue-shifted absorption peaks, increased optical bandgaps and down-shifted HOMO levels compared to H11, which is similar to the reported phenomenon about 2F7T and 2Cl7T. The chlorinated H14 presented the most appropriate phase separation with IDIC-4F in their blend films under TA conditions. The H14:IDIC-4F based blend films exhibited small length scale domains and higher relative purity, contributing to efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection. The H14:IDIC-4F based SMPVs realized an optimal PCE of 12.1%, outperforming the 10.4% for H11:IDIC-4F based and the 10.3% for H13:IDIC-4F based SMPVs. By employing π-bridge engineering for H11, Qiu et al. reported two analogues of the H11 molecule: SM-BT-2OR with alkoxy side chains on the benzothiadiazole units and SM-BT-2F with fluorine atom substitution on the benzothiadiazole units.89 SM-BT-2F displays red-shifted absorption and a down-shifted HOMO level compared to SM-BT-2OR due to the fluorination effect. When combined with IDIC to construct SMPVs, the SM-BT-2OR and SM-BT-2F based as-cast SMPVs afforded similar PCEs of 2.33% and 2.76%, respectively. SM-BT-2OR based SMPVs achieved an enhanced PCE of 7.20% after TA treatment, while SM-BT-2F based SMPVs exhibited a decreased PCE of 1.6%. The decreased PCE of SM-BT-2F based SMPVs after TA treatment should be attributed to the oversized phase separation and more preferred π–π stacking in the in-plane direction, which led to deteriorated exciton dissociation and charge transport in active layers.

2.2.5 Multiple BDT unit based donor molecules. 
To manipulate the molecular oriented stacking, a series of small molecular donors were designed and synthesized with an expanded number of BDT units due to good planarity of the backbone. Fig. 11 shows the chemical structures of multiple BDT unit based donor molecules in recent reports. Badgujar et al. synthesized a series of analogues of DR3TBDTT (namely BDT1, BDT2 and BDT3) with a varied number of BDT units.94 Intermolecular interaction could be manipulated by increasing the number of BDT units. Molecule BDT2 exhibits strong intermolecular interaction, facilitating a well-developed interconnected structure of BDT2:PC71BM blend films. An optimal PCE of 8.56% and a high FF of 73% were achieved in the BDT2:PC71BM based SMPVs without extra active layer treatments. The corresponding BDT1:PC71BM and BDT3:PC71BM based SMPVs yielded relatively low PCEs of 7.18% and 7.14%, respectively. When fabricating BDT2:PC71BM based large-area (7775 mm2) SMPVs (Fig. 10a), an encouraging PCE of 7.45% can be established due to the reduced charge recombination and desired morphology of active layers. This work could provide a useful design strategy for fabricating efficient large-area SMPVs. By removing the conjugated π-bridges from BDT3, Hou and co-workers reported a novel donor material DRTB-T.95 A low-lying HOMO level of −5.51 eV with a large optical bandgap of 2.0 eV is realized in DRTB-T due to the weak electron-donating ability of the thiophene substituted BDT central unit. Compared with the analogues DR3TBDTT and BDT3, the absorption of DRTB-T is significantly blue-shifted with the absorption edge at 620 nm, enabling a better complementary photon harvesting range with the acceptor IC-C6IDT-IC. The DRTB-T:IC-C6IDT-IC based SMPVs realized a PCE of 9.08% with a large VOC of 0.98 V under SVA treatment. Subsequently, Wang et al. combined DRTB-T with a newly synthesized acceptor F-2Cl, achieving a PCE of 10.76% in the optimal SMPVs.96 By varying the length of end group alkyl chains of DRTB-T(-C2), Hou and co-workers synthesized another three small molecules, namely DRTB-T-C4/C6/C8.39 The four molecules have identical optical and electrical properties and different molecular orientations. As seen in the 2D GIWAXS images in Fig. 10b, the transition of molecular orientation from edge-on to face-on can be clearly observed with the extension of the end group alkyl chain. Fig. 10c shows the schematic diagram of molecular arrangement in blend films. It is obvious that the face-on molecular orientation in blend films is conducive to charge transport, hence enhancing the charge mobility. DRTB-T-C4:IT-4F and DRTB-T-C6:IT-4F based SMPVs obtained a substantial increase in PCE. A record high PCE of 11.24% was realized in the DRTB-T-C4:IT-4F based SMPVs. Impressively, a high PCE of 10.18% can still be maintained in the DRTB-T-C4:IT-4F based SMPVs with 300 nm active layers. The high PCE and good thickness-tolerance of DRTB-T-C4:IT-4F based SMPVs should be attributed to the face-on orientation with the largest π–π stacking correlation length leading to highest and most balanced charge mobility. Conversely, DRTB-T-C8:IT-4F based SMPVs yielded a slightly decreased PCE of 9.14% compared to that of DRTB-T-C2:IT-4F based SMPVs, which is mainly due to the oversized domain size hampering exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work demonstrates an effective and facile strategy to manipulate the molecular orientation by regulating the length of end alkyl chains. Liu et al. reported DRTB-FT with introduced F atoms on the thienyl substituent of the central BDT core.97 DRTB-FT shows a down-shifted HOMO level compared to that of DRTB-T due to the fluorination effect. The DRTB-FT:F-2Cl based SMPVs delivered a PCE of 7.66% with a VOC of 1.07 V and a Eloss of 0.47 eV. Recently, Yang et al. reported two analogues of BDT3 namely 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5.98 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 terminated with different end groups of 3-hexylrhodanine and 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate, respectively. 3BDT-5 exhibits a slightly deeper HOMO level, higher LUMO level and larger absorption coefficient compared to 3BDT-4. 3BDT-5:Y6 based blend films achieved higher and more balanced electron and hole mobilities, lower trap-assistant and bimolecular recombination, more ordered molecular packing and more ideal nanoscale phase separation in comparison with 3BDT-4:Y6 based blend films. The 3BDT-5:Y6 based SMPVs afforded an impressive PCE of 10.4% without any extra treatment with a higher VOC of 0.840 V, a higher JSC of 21.3 mA cm−2 and a higher FF of 58.1% than those of 3BDT-4:Y6 based SMPVs. It should be highlighted that this is the first instance of the Y6 based SMPVs exhibiting over 10% PCE without any treatment. The 3BDT-5:Y6 based SMPVs obtained a PCE of 11.0% under TA treatment and a PCE of 10.5% under SVA treatment. The marginal influence of post-treatments on device performance revealed the ideal and stable nanoscale phase separation morphology for 3BDT-5:Y6 blend films, which is beneficial to large-scale fabrication of SMPVs.

2.2.6 Other donor molecules based on the BDT core. 
In addition to the abovementioned BDT-central core based donor molecules, other donor molecules based on the BDT core also showed good development. Fig. 13 shows the chemical structures of other BDT core based donor molecules in recent reports. Wei and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of small molecular donors with the same backbone but different side chains and terminal units. In 2016, Wei and co-workers synthesized BTID-0F, BTID-1F and BTID-2F with different alkylthienyl side chains on the BDT core and varied F atoms on terminal units.10 The PCE for SMPVs with the structure of ITO/ZnO/donor:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag was increased from 8.30% for BTID-0F to 10.4% for BTID-1F and to 11.3% for BTID-2F, thanks to the simultaneously enhanced JSC, VOC and FF upon incorporating more F atoms on terminal units. The vertical morphologies of active layers can be well revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which was employed for investigating surface enrichment and vertical phase distribution, as displayed in Fig. 12a and b. After fluorination of the small molecular donor, hierarchical morphology of active layers was formed with increased domain purity, strengthened directional vertical phase distribution and enhanced surface enrichment, which is favorable for charge transport and collection as well as recombination suppression. The optimized morphology of the BTID-2F:PC71BM layer is schematically shown in Fig. 12c, which possesses high domain purity, interpenetrating networks and hole transport layers at the top interface. Based on these three systems, they deeply investigated the dependence of device performances and active layer morphology on molecular structures and substrate temperature.99 This finding demonstrated that the vertical and lateral phase evolution kinetics can be effectively manipulated by controlling the substrate temperature during spin coating, which could offer a feasible guideline to achieving high performance SMPVs by optimizing the hierarchical phase separation. In 2019, Wei and co-workers reported an analogue of BTID-2F namely BDTF-CA with the additional fluorine atom on the side thiophene unit on the BDT central core and with octyl 2-cyanoacetate as the terminal unit.100 To investigate the fluorination–substitution effect on SMPVs, BDTF-CA based SMPVs were fabricated by combining acceptor IDIC and its corresponding fluorinated acceptor IDIC-2F and IDIC-4F. IDIC-2F and IDIC-4F present red-shifted absorption, down-shifted LUMO levels and strong molecular interaction. Furthermore, fiber interpenetrating morphology of blend films was facilitated, leading to hole and electron mobility enhancement by one order of magnitude. Benefiting from the good trade-off between absorption, energy level and active layer morphology, BDTF-CA:IDIC-2F based SMPVs achieved an optimal PCE of 9.11%. Three chlorinated small molecules namely BSCl-C1, BSCl-C2 and BSCl-C3 are terminated by branching points at the 1-, 2-, and 3-positions in alkyl terminal chains, respectively.101 The outward branching point leads to a narrowed bandgap, red-shifted absorption peak, enhanced molecular crystallinity and ordering in films. BSCl-C2 exhibits better miscibility and the strongest intermolecular interaction with IDIC-4Cl. The BSCl-C2:IDIC-4Cl based SMPVs achieved the best PCE of 12.4% thanks to the optimal bulk heterojunction morphology with sufficient interfaces and fiber interpenetrating networks. Another chlorinated small molecular donor called BSCl was developed by using n-hexyl to substitute 2-ethylhexyl on the rhodanine terminal units of BSCl-C2, which exhibits similar optical and electrical properties and stronger molecular packing ability relative to BSCl-C2.102 Compared to the BSCl-C2:IDIC-4Cl based SMPVs, an enhanced PCE of 13.03% was realized in the BSCl:IDIC-4Cl based SMPVs by combining TA and SVA treatments on active layers. It should be highlighted that the PCE of 13.03% was among the highest values for SMPVs based on the IDIC-system. In this work, the effect of post-treatments on energy loss was deeply studied. And the study results indicate that TA treatment marginally affects the optical energy gap but significantly influences the energy of the charge-transfer state (ECT), while SVA treatment has negligible effects on energy loss. The decreased VOC under TA treatment should have mainly resulted from the decreased ECT accompanied by larger non-radiative recombination loss, which is further ascribed to the upshifts of HOMO energy levels in blend films. Besides, the varying trend of the driving force for exciton dissociation under different post-treatments was consistent with that of the exciton dissociation efficiency.

The thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) unit with strong electron deficient properties has been applied in designing polymer donors, which is expected for low-lying HOMO levels.103,104 TTz unit based small molecular donors are seldom explored. Zhang and co-workers reported a series of TTz unit based small molecular donors.105,106 In 2020, they reported the BDT-central core and TTz electron deficient unit based small molecule BTTzR (SL1) with rhodanine as terminal units.105 BTTzR exhibits a low-lying HOMO level, strong crystallinity and ordered molecular packing. The BTTzR:Y6 based SMPVs yielded an optimized PCE of 13.9% with a JSC of 23.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.88 V and a FF of 68%. The reduced sEQE and EL spectra (Fig. 12d) and EQEEL spectra (Fig. 12e) demonstrated a CT state energy of 1.38 eV and a non-radiative energy loss (ΔEnr) of 0.18 eV in the BTTzR:Y6 based SMPVs. Fig. 12f shows the ΔEnr values in representative studies and this work. Obviously, the ΔEnr of 0.18 eV was comparable to that of Si based inorganic solar cells and lower than that of other representative systems. This work successfully delivers an effective method to fabricate SMPVs with low non-radiative energy loss by rationally designing photovoltaic materials. Another three small molecules (SL2, SL3, and SL4) were sequentially synthesized to investigate the effect of side-chain engineering in the thienyl substituent of the BDT core on photovoltaic performance.106 Investigation results revealed that side-chain engineering marginally influences the energy levels and molecular absorption, while significantly influencing the molecular packing, crystallinity and compatibility with the Y6 acceptor. In neat films, SL4 with two short linear alkyl chains displays the most compact molecular stacking; SL2 with a single long branched side chain exhibits the loosest molecular stacking, while SL1 and SL3 with mixed linear and branched side chains deliver stronger crystallization in the face-on direction. The three molecules (SL1, SL3, and SL4) with double side chains achieve better compatibility with Y6, and the compatibility becomes better along with increasing side alkyl chain length. Due to the moderate molecular packing, crystallinity and compatibility with Y6, SL1 based SMPVs yielded the best PCE of 13.9%. This work reconfirms that modulating side chains of small molecular donors is an effective strategy to obtain efficient SMPVs.

2.3 Porphyrin-central core based small molecular donors
Porphyrin-central core based small molecules have extensive π-conjugated surfaces, strong absorption in blue (Soret band) and red (Q-bands) parts, as well as easily tunable optical and electrochemical properties via chemical structure modification.107–109 Most of the reported porphyrin-central core based small molecular donors were matched with PCBM, and corresponding SMPVs exhibited PCEs less than 10%. There should be great potential for porphyrin-central core based small molecules achieving breakthroughs in SMPVs. Fig. 14 shows the chemical structures of porphyrin-central core based donor molecules. In 2012, Huang et al. synthesized a DHTBTEZP molecule, with ethynylene bridges linking the porphyrin core and 3-hexylthienyl end-capped 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units.110 For reference, another porphyrin molecule namely DHTBTZP was synthesized without ethynylene bridges. DHTBTEZP exhibits broader and red-shifted peaks in comparison to DHTBTZP. Meanwhile, photon harvesting ability is dramatically enhanced in Q-bands of DHTBTEZP. The improved absorption of DHTBTEZP should be assigned to the π-conjugation between the porphyrin core and benzothiadiazole units leading to better delocalization of the π-electrons. Correspondingly, the PCE was significantly increased from 0.71% in the DHTBTZP:PC71BM based SMPVs to 4.02% in the DHTBTEZP:PC71BM based SMPVs. This work should provide a guideline for designing efficient porphyrin molecules using ethynylene bridges. Using diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units to substitute the 3-hexylthienyl end-capped 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units of DHTBTEZP, Li et al. reported a novel porphyrin molecule DPPEZnP-DD.111 The strong π-electron withdrawing properties of DPP units can enable absorption in the NIR region. The rigid and planar aromatic structure of DPP units is favorable for increasing charge mobility. The SMPVs based on DPPEZnP-DD:PC61BM obtained a PCE of 4.78% via using 3.0 vol% pyridine additive. Three novel porphyrin small molecules namely DPPEZnP-O,112 DPPEZnP-TEH113 and ZnP-TBO114 were developed by employing side chain engineering to DPPEZnP-DD. Qin et al. developed a porphyrin molecule DPPEZnP-O by replacing the 3,5-di(dodecyloxy)-phenyl units of DPPEZnP-DD with 4-octyloxy-phenyl units.112 A PCE of 5.83% was obtained in the DPPEZnP-O:PC61BM based SMPVs without any additive, and the PCE was boosted to 7.23% after using 0.4 vol% DIO additive. Compared to the optimized SMPVs based on DPPEZnP-DD, the similarly structured DPPEZnP-O based SMPVs delivered significantly increased JSC and FF values, which should be triggered by the strengthened intermolecular π–π stacking of DPPEZnP-O. In contrast to the DPPEZnP-DD:PC61BM blend films, the DPPEZnP-O:PC61BM blend films exhibited much smaller RMS values in the AFM images and more fine and uniform features in the TEM images, indicating better miscibility between DPPEZnP-O and PC61BM. The better miscibility in the DPPEZnP-O:PC61BM blend films may induce favorable interpenetrating networks for better exciton dissociation and charge transport. Changing the 3,5-di(dodecyloxy)-phenyl units of DPPEZnP-DD into 2-ethylhexyl-thienyl side groups, Gao et al. reported a novel material DPPEZnP-TEH.113 DPPEZnP-TEH exhibits three strong absorption peaks in a very dilute dichloromethane solution, indicating an effective π-electron delocalization between constituent units. With 1% pyridine additive and TA treatment, the SMPVs based on DPPEZnP-TEH:PC61BM yielded an optimized PCE of 8.08% with a significantly enhanced JSC of 16.76 mA cm−2 compared to the 12.44 mA cm−2 of the SMPVs under only TA treatment. An energy loss of 0.59 eV can be achieved in the DPPEZnP-TEH:PC61BM based SMPVs. This successful demonstration of porphyrin based SMPVs could provide an effective way in material design for realizing excellent SMPVs with low energy loss. Gao et al. further obtained a porphyrin material ZnP-TBO by changing the alkylthienyl side chains of DPPEZnP-TEH from 2-ethylhexyl into 2-butyloctyl.114 With the help of solvent additive and SVA treatment, an optimized PCE of 12.08% with an FF of 73.87% was demonstrated in the ZnP-TBO:6TIC based SMPVs. GIWAXS, RSOXS and TEM characteristics demonstrated the preferred face-on molecular arrangement, increased crystallinity and suitable phase separation in the optimized blend films. The optimized morphology should be responsible for the high FF due to the optimized morphology leading to an enhanced and balanced charge mobility, suppressed charge recombination and strengthened charge transport and collection. In this work, the initial excited state dynamics of the blend films were deeply investigated by employing femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, which should provide an insight for investigating the excited state kinetics of SMPVs in depth.

In addition to the above DPP unit based porphyrin donors, other π-bridge and terminal unit based porphyrin small molecular donors also exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance. Kumar et al. developed a porphyrin molecule VC117 by applying an octyl thiophene-ethynylene π-bridge to link 3-ethylrhodanine terminal units and the porphyrin central core.115 An optimized PCE of 5.50% was obtained in the VC117:PC71BM based SMPVs under the processing of the mixture of 4 vol% pyridine in THF solvent and TA treatment. Xiao et al. synthesized PTTR and PTTCNR, porphyrin central core based small molecules with 3,3′′-dihexyl-terthiophene as the π-bridge and 3-ethylrhodanine or 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine as terminal units, respectively.116 The absorption spectra of PTTR and PTTCNR neat films cover the wide range of 300–1000 nm. Meanwhile, optimized molecular stacking is obtained via polymorphism associated with the appended long alkyl chains. The SMPVs based on PTTR:PC71BM and PTTCNR:PC71BM achieved PCEs of 7.66% and 8.21% respectively. Wang et al. reported three porphyrin small molecular donors with 5,15-bis(phenylethynyl) as the π-bridge linking the porphyrin central core and 3-ethylrhodanine terminal units.117 The small molecule with alkyl substituents on the porphyrin central core possesses strengthened intermolecular π–π stacking and enhanced charge mobility in comparison to the other small molecules with aromatic substituents on the porphyrin central core. A larger PCE of 7.70% was achieved in the SMPVs based on the porphyrin donor with alkyl substituents and acceptor PC71BM. Meanwhile, the inverted SMPVs yielded a PCE of 7.55%, and 83% of the original PCE can be maintained after storage in air for a month.
2.4 Other central core based small molecular donors

2.4.1 Dithienobenzodithiophene-central core based small molecular donors. 
As a notable aromatic analog of BDT, the dithienobenzodithiophene (DTBDT) central core possesses a larger coplanar structure with an extended conjugation length, contributing to improving charge carrier transport, reducing the conformation disorder of the backbone, increasing molecular planarity to facilitate electron delocalization.41 Song et al. reported a DTBDT central core based small molecule namely DTBDT-Rho, with alkyl terthiophene as the π-bridge linking rhodanine terminal units.118 DTBDT-Rho shows broad absorption with the absorption edge at 749 nm and a shallow HOMO energy level of −5.11 eV. Upon selecting PC71BM as the acceptor and the ZnO nanoparticles/Al bilayer as the cathode, the optimized SMPVs can realize the best PCE of 7.10% without any active layer treatments. Zhou et al. designed and synthesized ZR1, a novel DTBDT central core based small molecular donor with bithiophene as the π-bridge.41 The short π-bridge leads to a deep HOMO level of −5.32 eV. IDIC-4Cl and Y6, having good crystallinity and a complementary photon harvesting range with ZR1, were adopted as acceptors to fabricating SMPVs for investigating the photovoltaic properties of ZR1. It is worth mentioning that all SMPVs were built without an electron-transporting layer and any additives. Optimal PCEs of 9.64% and 14.34% were produced in the ZR1:IDIC-4Cl and ZR1:Y6 based SMPVs, respectively. ZR1:Y6 based SMPVs yielded a remarkable JSC of 24.34 mA cm−2 due to the broader absorption spectrum of Y6. RSoXS and TEM studies demonstrated an optimized hierarchical morphology of the ZR1:Y6 blend films, which is favorable to charge separation and transport. Besides, ZR1:Y6 based SMPVs realized a relatively low Eloss of 0.54 eV with both reduced radiative and nonradiative energy losses, contributing to a relatively high VOC of 0.861 V. ZR1-Cl with chlorinated substitutions and ZR1-S-Cl with chlorinated and sulfurated substitutions were synthesized when applying side chain engineering to ZR1.119 ZR1-Cl and ZR1-S-Cl present marginally blue-shifted absorption, enhanced extinction coefficients and down-shifted HOMO levels in comparison with ZR1. Combining the properties of sulfuration and chlorination, ZR1-S-Cl achieves the largest molar extinction coefficients, lowest HOMO level and highest crystallinity among the three donors. Chlorinated small molecule IDIC-4Cl was employed as the acceptor with the three small molecular donors to build SMPVs. Compared to the PCE of ZR1:IDIC-4Cl (9.64%) and ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl (10.81%) based SMPVs, ZR1-S-Cl:IDIC-4Cl based SMPVs obtained the highest PCE of 12.05% with simultaneously enhanced JSC, VOC and FF. This synergetic strategy of chlorination and sulfuration could be an effective strategy to design excellent donors for SMPVs.


2.4.2 Naphthodithiophene-central core based small molecular donors. 
The naphthodithiophene (NDT) unit also has an extended conjugation length backbone relative to the BDT unit, which is expected to be a promising central core unit for small molecular donors. Wei and co-workers reported a series of 2D-conjugated NDT-central core based small molecular donors. In 2016, Wei and co-workers first synthesized two NDT-central core based small molecular donors namely NDTT-CNCOO and NDTP-CNCOO with alkylthienyl and alkylphenyl side chains, respectively.120 NDTP-CNCOO presents highly ordered structures and more favorable phase separation in the NDTP-CNCOO:PC71BM based blend films than those of NDTT-CNCOO. The NDTP-CNCOO:PC71BM based SMPVs achieved a higher PCE of 7.20% with an FF over 70% at 300 nm thickness of active layers. Meanwhile, PCE values of more than 6.0% can be obtained in the SMPVs with an active layer thickness of 200–400 nm, indicating the potential of the 2D-conjugated NDT central core in synthesizing high-efficiency small molecules for thick-film SMPVs. Afterwards, they synthesized a novel NDT-central core based small molecular donor denoted as NDTSR with 3-ethylrhodanines as terminal units.121 The NDTSR molecule possesses alkylthio substituents on side thiophene units, which can increase the intermolecular interactions and down-shift the HOMO level. ITIC and IDIC with matched energy levels and a complementary photon harvesting range to NDTSR were chosen as acceptors for fabricating SMPVs. The NDTSR:ITIC based SMPVs yielded a PCE of 1.77% while the NDTSR:IDIC based SMPVs yielded a PCE of 8.05% after TA treatment. The markedly high PCE of the NDTSR:IDIC based SMPVs should have resulted from better phase separation in the NDTSR:IDIC blend films for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Combining side chain engineering and end-group engineering to modify NDTSR, two small molecules NDT-3T-R4 and NDT-3T-R6 were synthesized.122 Additional alkyl side chains were placed on the side thiophene units to impart liquid-crystalline properties. Varied alkyl chains in the rhodanine terminal units were expected to adjust the molecular arrangement. Compared to the edge-on orientation of NDTSR, NDT-3T-R4 and NDT-3T-R6 exhibit 3D molecular arrangement with more preferred face-on orientation. A good crystal acceptor IDIC-4F was synthesized for broadened absorption and increased molecular interactions. PCE values of 9.21% and 10.70% were obtained in NDT-3T-R4:IDIC-4F and NDT-3T-R6:IDIC-4F based SMPVs, respectively, both with over 71% FFs. This work is a typical example for modulating molecular arrangement by adjusting end alkyl chains.


2.4.3 Dithienosilole-central core based small molecular donors. 
Zhou et al. designed and synthesized a novel small molecule called DCAO3TSi with a dithienosilole (DTS) unit as the central core.123 DCAO3TSi exhibits an absorption coefficient of 8.6 × 104 cm−1 (with 80 nm films), an optical bandgap of 1.73 eV, a hole mobility of 1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a well-organized assembly. By simple solution spin coating and preliminary optimization, the SMPVs based on DCAO3TSi:PC61BM yielded the best PCE of 5.84%. Ni et al. reported novel small molecules DR3TDTC and DR3TDTS, two analogues with dithiophene (DTC) and DTS units as the central core, respectively, and 3-ethyl-rhodanine as the terminal units.124 The larger Si atom and longer C–Si bond of DR3TDTS can decrease interactions of bulk alkyl side chains, contributing to more ordered molecular packing and better molecular orientation. As a result, the optimized DR3TDTS:PC71BM blend films presented more favorable photon harvesting, better charge transport properties and more suitable phase separation (20−30 nm domain size) than those of DR3TDTC:PC71BM blend films. An optimal PCE of 8.02% was realized in DR3TDTS:PC71BM based SMPVs, while DR3TDTC:PC71BM based SMPVs only reached a PCE of 0.75%. The results further verify that delicate molecule design is a fundamental method for achieving efficient SMPVs.


2.4.4 Thienobenzofuran-central core based small molecular donors. 
Upon replacing one thiophene ring of the BDT unit with a furan ring, a thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF) unit is produced. TBF derivatives are expected to have tunable energy levels, excellent solubility, better planarity and stronger intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions due to their inherent asymmetry and intrinsic optical properties.125 Min's team synthesized two 2D-conjugated small molecules BDTT-TR (DR3TBDTT) and TBFT-TR with BDT and TBF units as the central core, respectively.125 To deeply understand the discrepancy between BDTT-TR and TBFT-TR, Fig. 15a shows the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results of their geometries. The TBF-Th unit has a smaller torsional angle (2.93°) compared to the BDT-Th unit, suggesting a better planarity of TBFT-TR. Meanwhile, the TBF unit possesses a larger dipole moment (≈1.21 Debye) than that of the centrosymmetric BDT unit (≈0 Debye), which is expected to have stronger intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions and a higher degree of molecular ordering in solid films. The higher degree of molecular ordering of TBFT-TR can be well supported by the higher and more red-shifted absorption as well as the stronger molecular stacking signals in the GIWAXS images (Fig. 15b). The more ordered and more compact π–π stacking of TBFT-TR can be ascribed to its better planarity, contributing to higher hole mobility of TBFT-TR. Consequently, TBFT-TR:Y6 based SMPVs achieved a better PCE of 14.03% than the 12.18% of BDTT-TR:Y6 based SMPVs. Acceptors PC71BM, IDIC and Y6-C2 were also employed to fabricate BDTT-TR or TBFT-TR based SMPVs, and better results were demonstrated in TBFT-TR based SMPVs. This work indicates that TBF central core based small molecular donors are promising in building efficient SMPVs.

2.4.5 Thienobenzodithiophene-central core based small molecular donors. 
As an aromatic derivative of BDT, the asymmetric thienobenzodithiophene (TBD) unit and its asymmetric derivatives are expected to facilitate electron delocalization and charge carrier transport thanks to its larger coplanar structure with an extended conjugation length but subtly decreased molecular crystallinity due to lower regioregularity of the conjugated backbone.126 Meanwhile, molecular conformation and aggregation and phase separation in blend films can be regulated by such a backbone modification strategy. Wang et al. designed and synthesized TBD based and TBD derivative furobenzodithiophene (FBD) based small molecules, called TBD-S4 and FBD-S3.126 The only difference is the subtly tailored asymmetric central core. As displayed in Fig. 15c, two end groups of TBD-S4 and FBD-S3 are aligned on the same side of the asymmetric core axis to form a C-shaped conformation, which is similar to the bending structure of acceptor Y6. The similar C-shaped conformation of the two donors to that of Y6 can enable the two donors to easily interpenetrate into neighboring Y6 and inhibit excessive single component aggregation. Besides, TBD-S4 and FBD-S3 exhibit well matched energy levels and complementary photon harvesting to those of Y6. The TBD-S4:Y6 based SMPVs reached a higher PCE of 15.10% due to the better bicontinuous interpenetrating morphology leading to more efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport and extraction. Afterwards, Wang et al. synthesized two novel TBD and FBD based small molecular donors, namely TBD-S2 and FBD-S1.127 Similar to the previous work on TBD-S4 and FBD-S3, TBD-S2:Y6 blend films achieved hierarchical morphology with better continuous interpenetrating networks; TBD-S2:Y6 based SMPVs obtained a higher PCE of 13.1%. These research studies open up a new way for preparing efficient SMPVs by tailoring the molecular skeleton at the atomic level (Fig. 16).

3. Device engineering for SMPVs
The ternary strategy has been verified as an effective and simple device structure optimization strategy, which has the potential in enhancing photon harvesting, optimizing molecular arrangement and phase separation, decreasing energy loss and improving device stability.128–132 Both two donor and two acceptor based ternary SMPVs have achieved impressive progress. Benefiting from the relatively rapid development of acceptor materials, two acceptor based ternary SMPVs realize better progress than two donor based ternary SMPVs.
3.1 Ternary SMPVs based on two donors
Based on plenty of excellent studies on ternary SMPVs, structurally similar small molecular materials were generally selected due to their good compatibility, which can effectively inhibit the formation of oversized phase separation and facilitate formation of the alloy state.133–136 The energy transfer and charge transfer process of intermolecules strongly depend on the intermolecular distance in blend films.137–140 The compatibility of materials will influence the intermolecular distance in blend films; the small intermolecular distance will be conducive to the occurrence of the dynamic process to improve the exciton utilization through energy or charge transfer.141,142 Wang et al. designed a novel molecule DR3TBDTT-E and fabricated ternary SMPVs based on donors DR3TBDTT (M1) and DR3TBDTT-E (M2) and acceptor PC71BM.143 The ternary SMPVs with an optimized weight ratio (0.9:0.1:0.8, wt/wt/wt) exhibited PCEs of 8.48% under the as-cast conditions and 10.26% under TA + SVA (TSA) treatments. Interestingly, the VOC evolution dependence on DR3TBDTT:DR3TBDTT-E ratios is different under the as-cast conditions and TSA conditions, as shown in Fig. 17a. The VOCs under the as-cast conditions increase quasi-linearly with more DR3TBDTT-E content in the ternary blends. The VOCs of ternary SMPVs under TSA conditions remain at ∼0.9 V with the DR3TBDTT-E content at 10–60%, and subtly change accordingly with DR3TBDTT-E content below 10% or above 60%. A transformation from the alloy-like model to the cascade model (Fig. 17b) can be assumed to explain the VOC variations of ternary SMPVs. DR3TBDTT-E molecules shift from the mixed region to the donor/acceptor interface under TSA conditions. The HOMO values with varied DR3TBDTT:DR3TBDTT-E ratios in the two models were simulated by employing DFT, as displayed in Fig. 17c and d. The HOMO shows a linear correlation with increasing DR3TBDTT-E in the alloy-like model and has an independent relationship with DR3TBDTT-E content in the cascade model, which well supports the transformation from the alloy-like model to the cascade model. Tang et al. synthesized a novel small molecular donor namely BTR-OH by introducing hydroxyl into the rhodamine terminal units of BTR.144 BTR-OH exhibits similar absorption properties yet weaker crystallinity in comparison to BTR. A PCE of 10.14% can be realized in the BTR:BTR-OH:PC71BM based SMPVs with a 300 nm active layer, which is higher than the 9.05% of BTR:PC71BM based SMPVs and 8.00% of BTR-OH:PC71BM based SMPVs. BTR-OH mainly serves as an excellent morphology regulator to decrease the crystallinity of the donor phase and improve the interpenetrating network and domain size, thus leading to more balanced charge carrier transport. This work demonstrates a promising third component strategy by employing a structurally similar donor derivative featuring different crystallinity. Chang et al. carefully designed and synthesized a novel donor material DR3TBDTT-S-E, which is with alkylthio-substituent thiophene conjugated side chains for down-shifting the HOMO energy level and ester groups on rhodanine units for maximizing the structural similarities between DR3TBDTT-S-E, DR3TBDTT and DCAO3TBDTT.145 Two types of ternary SMPVs were constructed based on the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM or DCAO3TBDTT:IDIC host system with DR3TBDTT-S-E as the third component, exhibiting an over 10% PCE due to the obviously improved JSC and FF. Blended with fullerene derivatives as the acceptor, DR3TBDTT-S-E can play a role of charge relay to facilitate the hole extraction from PC71BM to DR3TBDTT, leading to improved charge transport and suppressed charge recombination. Blended with non-fullerene derivatives as the acceptor, the formation of 3D charge pathways for promoting charge transport is the dominated mechanism for PCE improvement. This work offers a fascinating approach to fabricating efficient ternary SMPVs by incorporating a miscible donor material. Based on the representative SM(DCAO3TBDTT):IDIC binary SMPVs, Ge et al. designed and synthesized SM-Cl as the third component to enhance the device performance.146 SM-Cl is structurally similar to SM but with extra chlorine atoms on the central building block, which has good compatibility with SM. SM-Cl exhibits lower crystallinity and a lower lying HOMO level than SM due to the chlorination effect. Upon incorporating 10 wt% SM-Cl as the third component in the SM:IDIC host, the PCE was dramatically enhanced from 9.39% to 10.29% resulting from simultaneously improved JSC, VOC and FF. The related experimental characterization demonstrated that the introduction of SM-Cl facilitates the co-crystallization of SM and SM-Cl and the demixing between donors and acceptors, and an alloy state tends to be formed between two donors. This study points out a new strategy on improving the performance of SMPVs via modulation on crystallinity deviation between donors and acceptors. Guijarro et al. reported efficient ternary SMPVs with conjugated small molecules FG3 and FG4 as donors and Y6 as the acceptor.147 A PCE of 14.31% was yielded in the optimized ternary SMPVs, which is higher than that of FG3:Y6 based SMPVs (10.75%) and FG4:Y6 based SMPVs (11.07%). The JSC and FF values of the optimized ternary SMPVs are higher than the corresponding values of two binary SMPVs, and the VOC is in between that of two binary SMPVs. The significantly enhanced PCE of ternary SMPVs should be mainly attributed to the improved photon harvesting, more efficient exciton dissociation, more balanced charge transport, fast charge extraction, and relieved charge carrier recombination in ternary active layers.

Other donor materials without a similar structure to the host materials can also serve as a good third component to enhance device performance. An et al. reported ternary SMPVs based on DRCN5T:DR3TSBDT:PC71BM.148 The optimal ternary SMPVs yielded a PCE of 10.16%, which is higher than the 9.12% and 8.24% of DRCN5T and DR3TSBDT based binary SMPVs, respectively. The increased photon harvesting and the formed alloy state should be mainly responsible for the improved performance of ternary SMPVs. The formation of the alloy state can be well supported by the good compatibility between two donors, monotonically shifted diffraction peaks and monotonically changed energy levels of DRCN5T:DR3TSBDT blend films along with more DR3TSBDT in donors. Noteworthily, the authors developed an efficient and simple method for the first time to study the alloy state in this work. A shortwave cut-off filter was employed to enable over 670 nm light to illuminate the SMPVs. The photon harvesting mainly originates from DRCN5T in this wavelength range. The J–V curves and EQE spectra of the SMPVs covered with the cut-off filter are exhibited in Fig. 17e and f. The VOCs are almost linearly decreased with more DR3TSBDT in donors, indicating the formation of the alloy state between DRCN5T and DR3TSBDT. The holes from DRCN5T transport mainly along the channels of the alloy state. The EQEs are slightly decreased with more DR3TSBDT in donors, which suggests more efficient hole transport along the channels of the alloy state. Fig. 17g shows the mechanism of the alloy model in these ternary SMPVs. The two donors would prefer to form the alloy state, leading to tunable energy levels and gradually varied VOCs with more DR3TSBDT content. Holes are transported along the channels of the alloyed donor, and electrons are transported along the channels formed by the acceptor. This work provides a new insight for investigating the alloy model in a ternary system, and the alloyed state can be considered as an overlapped electron cloud between two donors or two acceptors.149–151 Zhang et al. also employed DRCN5T:PC71BM as the host system to prepare SMPVs.47 The PCE of the host binary SMPVs was remarkably enhanced from 3.63% to 9.11% by using up-side-down TA (DTA) and up-side-down SVA (DSVA) treatments. The schematic illustration of post-treatment methods is shown in Fig. 17h. The improved PCE should be attributed to the increased donor crystallinity and optimized acceptor domain at the nanoscale for efficient charge transport and collection. To further enhance the device performance, a nematic liquid crystal material BTR was incorporated into the optimized host binary system as a morphology regulator and photon enhancer. An optimal PCE of 10.05% was achieved in the ternary SMPVs with 1.5 wt% BTR in donors. J–V curves of the cells without PC71BM were measured to clarify the potential charge transfer, as shown in Fig. 17i. The JSCs of DRCN5T:BTR based cells are in between the JSCs of BTR based and DRCN5T based cells, indicating a negligible charge transfer between two donors. It is noteworthy that this charge transfer investigation method is an efficient and simple method. Afterwards, Zhang et al. fabricated SMPVs based on the BTR:PC71BM host system and the third component DIB-SQ.152 The PCE was enhanced to 10.3% via the incorporation of 6 wt% DIB-SQ in donors, which is larger than the 9.37% for the host binary SMPVs. The PCE improvement can be interpreted by the increased photon harvesting, strengthened exciton utilization via energy transfer from BTR to DIB-SQ, improved exciton dissociation and charge transport by the optimized molecular arrangement and phase separation. Piradi et al. synthesized two porphyrin dimers DPP-2TP and DPP-2TTP with strong photon harvesting in 400–550 nm and 700–900 nm wavelength ranges, respectively.11 DR3TBDTTF was selected as the third component to fabricate SMPVs due to its complementary photon harvesting range and suitable energy level with the two porphyrin dimers. The SMPVs based on DPP-2TTP:20 wt% DR3TBDTTF:PC71BM yielded an optimized PCE of 11.15%, which is higher than the 9.30% of DPP-2TTP:PC71BM based SMPVs and the 8.23% of DPP-2TP:PC71BM based SMPVs. The PCE improvement of the optimal ternary SMPVs should be attributed to the enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency, reduced charge recombination, more balanced charge transport and more appropriate active layer morphology.
3.2 Ternary SMPVs based on two acceptors
As the popular third component, fullerene derivatives with relatively high electron mobility have been verified to be excellent morphology regulators to optimize phase separation, domain size and molecular arrangement in active layers.153–157 Ternary SMPVs with the fullerene derivative as the third component have realized great progress. Zhang et al. built ternary SMPVs with an improved PCE of 10.48% from 8.90% by introducing PC71BM into the DRTB-T:IDIC system, which is mainly due to the increased JSC and FF values of ternary SPMVs.158 The morphology characterization demonstrated that the introduction of PC71BM can limit the overgrowth of crystallites, abate the phase separation, enable a more compact molecular stacking and induce pure and small domains. The active layer morphology optimization is favorable for charge generation and suppression of charge recombination, which can well interpret the enhanced FF and JSC of ternary SMPVs. Liang et al. reported DR3TBDTT:ICC6:PC71BM based ternary SMPVs with an over 200 nm active layer exhibiting close to 11% PCE, which is much larger than the PCE of 8.7% for the optimized DR3TBDTT:ICC6 based binary SMPVs.159 Comprehensive investigations demonstrated that the incorporation of PC71BM can significantly improve electron mobility, prolong carrier lifetime and reduce geminate recombination. The PCE of ternary SMPVs can be maintained above 8% when the thickness of active layers is increased to 500 nm. The optimized ternary SMPVs can deliver long-term stability for >1000 hours in a 55% humidity air environment. Huo et al. developed a novel BDT central core based small molecule namely SBDT-BDD with two benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-diones (BDD) and two rhodanines as electron-accepting units.160 The excellent compatibility between SBDT-BDD with IDIC and PC71BM is favorable for increasing exciton dissociation and suppressing charge recombination in their blend films. SBDT-BDD:IDIC based binary SMPVs and SBDT-BDD:IDIC:PC71BM based ternary SMPVs were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of SBDT-BDD. The binary SMPVs yielded a PCE of 9.2%. The PCE of ternary SMPVs can be enhanced to 10.9%, resulting from the simultaneously improved JSC and FF. The film-depth-dependent optical and electronic properties in such SMPVs were optimized for manipulating photon harvesting contours and charge transport. Fig. 18a illustrates the simulated contours of energy dissipation Q in binary and ternary SMPVs. For both binary and ternary active layers, solar energy from 500–800 nm is mainly harvested in the bottom half of the active layer near the PEDOT:PSS interface. Ternary SMPVs harvest more solar energy compared to binary SMPVs. The calculated exciton generation rate results also prove that the exciton should be mainly generated in the bottom part of active layers. The more ordered molecular packing of IDIC leads to more excitons generated in the ternary active layers. This work is a successful case on fabricating efficient SMPVs via synergistically optimizing molecule design and post-treatments and combining with the ternary strategy. Xu et al. fabricated efficient ternary SMPVs based on the DR3TSBDT:Y6 host system and the third component PC71BM.161 The best PCE of 12.84% was achieved in the ternary SMPVs with 40 wt% PC71BM in acceptors, and the FF was significantly boosted from 55.21% to 67.27% by adding 40 wt% PC71BM in acceptors. After adding PC71BM with isotropic molecular arrangement, the molecular arrangements of host materials DR3TSBDT and Y6 can be well maintained to form a 3D texture structure for efficient charge transport. The hollow spherical structure of PC71BM with high electron mobility may connect Y6 molecules to form more continuous electron transport channels in the ternary active layers. The third component PC71BM mainly functions as a morphology regulator in ternary active layers. Fig. 18b shows the 2D GISAXS images of binary and the optimized ternary blend films, which reflect the effect of PC71BM on the phase separation degree. Corresponding GISAXS profiles in the qxy direction with phase separation related parameters are exhibited in Fig. 18c. The optimized ternary blend films reach the decreased donor/clustered acceptor domain sizes and decreased acceptor fractal dimension, contributing to enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency. This work well proves that hollow spherical PC71BM is an effective morphology regulator in ternary active layers. Zhou et al. employed the high-crystallinity material BTR as the donor and the non-fullerene material NITI and PC71BM as acceptors to built efficient ternary SMPVs.162 The BTR:PC71BM based binary SMPVs yielded a relatively high FF of 72.86% due to the fine transport properties of PC71BM. The BTR:NITI based binary SMPVs delivered a relatively high VOC of 0.95 V with a relatively low Eloss of 0.54 eV. The ternary SMPVs integrated the low Eloss of the non-fullerene NITI and the fine transport properties of PC71BM, achieving an optimal PCE of 13.63% with an FF of 73.83%, a VOC of 0.94 V and an Eloss of 0.55 eV. A hierarchical morphology can be realized in the ternary active layers, as illustrated in Fig. 18d. The morphology consists of intricate non-fullerene phase-separated small pathways and PC71BM transporting highways. The underlying reason is that NITI can be pushed out by BTR crystallization and PC71BM can be used as a morphology regulator in the ternary active layer. The BTR:PC71BM charge-transfer state can be restrained to reduce energy loss, and the carriers can be effectively transported via a cascading energetic channel. Dahiya et al. reported efficient SMPVs by using the bis-porphyrin donor VC7 and acceptors IT-4F and PC71BM.163 The optimal ternary SMPVs showed a PCE of 15.08%, higher than those of 9.39% and 11.61% of VC7:PC71BM and VC7:IT-4F based binary SMPVs, respectively. A series of characterization studies showed that the optimal ternary SMPVs achieve a higher exciton generation rate, longer carrier lifetime, suppressed charge recombination, more balanced charge transport and faster charge extraction, which should be responsible for the improved PCE of the optimal ternary SMPVs. Lu's team focused on the FF improvement of BTR-Cl:Y6 based SMPVs and employed miscible PC71BM as a solid additive to optimize the active layer morphology.164 The optimal SMPVs with ca. 5 wt% PC71BM achieved a remarkably increased FF of 77.11% without sacrificing the JSC and VOC (Fig. 18e), leading to a PCE of 15.34%. The combined characterization of TPC, TPV and drift-diffusion simulations demonstrated that the remarkable FF enhancement should be attributed to the significantly suppressed bimolecular recombination in the optimal active layers. The obviously distinguished TPV signals of two SMPVs can be observed in Fig. 18f. The carrier lifetime was significantly enhanced from 0.84 μs to 1.95 μs by incorporating appropriate PC71BM in active layers, indicating the more suppressed charge recombination in the optimal SMPVs. Morphology characterization demonstrated that the incorporation of PC71BM leads to a more reasonable domain size, face-on molecular orientations and favorable microstructures for charge separation and transport in the vertical direction in devices. The miscibility-induced active layer morphology optimization is an efficient strategy to optimize the microstructure of active layers for improving the device performance, which brings vibrancy to the SMPV research. Afterwards, Lu's team introduced ICBA into the BTR-Cl:Y6 system to fine-tune the active layer morphology, which successfully led to enhanced charge extraction, retarded charge recombination and a prolonged carrier lifetime.165 The ternary SMPVs achieved an optimal PCE of 14.7% with a remarkably enhanced FF of 73.88% by employing ICBA as the morphology regulator.

Employing a structurally similar small molecular material as the third component is an important and usually used material selection strategy. Structurally similar small molecular materials generally have good compatibility, which is conducive to forming the alloy state and maintaining favorable molecular arrangement.166–169 Huang et al. incorporated a small amount of IDIC into a ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl based binary system to fabricate ternary SMPVs.170 IDIC and IDIC-4Cl possess complimentary absorption spectra, cascade energy levels and good compatibility, which should be conducive to improving the performance of SMPVs. Compared to the PCE of 10.81% of the host binary SMPVs, the optimal ternary SMPVs achieved the highest PCE of 11.65% with 20 wt% IDIC in acceptors. The enhanced PCE can be well supported by an improved exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency, as well as optimized active layer morphology. Xu et al. developed a high-efficiency ternary SMPV based on donor BTR-Cl and two acceptors BTP-BO-4F and Y6.171 BTR-Cl is a liquid crystalline small molecule, which should be beneficial to hole transport in active layers. BTP-BO-4F and Y6 possess similar optical bandgaps but different absorption coefficients, which helps to adjust photogenerated exciton distribution in ternary active layers by varying the relative content. Meanwhile, the similar LUMO levels of BTP-BO-4F and Y6 are advantageous to electron transfer between the acceptors. With a BTP-BO-4F:Y6 weight ratio of 0.7:0.3, the best performing SMPVs delivered a PCE of 14.46% with an increased JSC of 24.17 mA cm−2, which should be mainly ascribed to the good trade-off between phase separation and photon harvesting of ternary active layers. These results elucidated that employing two non-fullerene materials should offer a promising opportunity to achieve highly efficient SMPVs, which may be one of the most candidate schemes for the potential application of large-scale production. Nian and co-workers incorporated an additional acceptor 4TIC into ZnP-TBO:6TIC and ZnP-TSEH:6TIC blends, respectively.172 4TIC possesses a similar molecular structure but better crystallinity compared to 6TIC, which is conducive to finely tuning the morphology of the blend films. With the addition of 10 wt% 4TIC, the PCEs of ZnP-TBO:6TIC and ZnP-TSEH:6TIC based SMPVs were increased from 12.11% to 14.73% and from 13.54% to 15.88%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the PCE of 15.88% was a record-high value for SMPVs. Experimental results demonstrated that the incorporation of 4TIC significantly increases the crystallinity of blend films and maintains the desired face-on orientation and proper multi-length scale morphology, leading to improved charge generation/extraction and charge recombination in ternary SMPVs. As a result, significantly increased JSCs (24.58 vs. 25.95 mA cm−2) and FFs (74.93% vs. 75.57%) were achieved in ZnP-TBO:6TIC:4TIC and ZnP-TSEH:6TIC:4TIC based ternary SMPVs, respectively. An and co-workers employed B1:BO-4Cl as the host binary SMPVs and introduced the third component Y7 as the morphology modulator to enhance the PCE of SMPVs.53 Y7 exhibits excellent compatibility with BO-4Cl, which facilitates formation of BO-4Cl:Y7 alloyed states for fine-tuning the molecular arrangement, while having inferior solubility and inferior compatibility with B1, leading to coarse morphology of B1:Y7 blend films and a negligible PCE of B1:Y7 based SMPVs. It is worth highlighting that the inferior compatibility between Y7 and B1 can afford a driving force to manipulate donor/acceptor phase separation. Upon introducing 10 wt% Y7 in acceptors, the PCE value was enhanced from 15.15% of B1:BO-4Cl based binary SMPVs to 16.28% of the optimal ternary SMPVs, with a simultaneously improved VOC of 0.836 V, a JSC of 25.52 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.29%. The PCE enhancement should be ascribed to the well evolved molecular arrangement and phase separation that lead to efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction in the optimal ternary SMPVs. This work provides a new insight to fabricate efficient SMPVs by rationally selecting materials from the compatibility aspect. Very recently, Hou and co-workers reported B1:BO-4Cl:BO-2Cl based ternary SMPVs with a record high PCE of 17.0%.32 BO-4Cl and BO-2Cl have very similar chemical structures, enabling good miscibility between them. An alloy-like phase can be formed in BO-4Cl:BO-2Cl blend films, whose basic properties are between those of BO-4Cl and BO-2Cl. Compared to B1:BO-4Cl and B1:BO-2Cl based binary SMPVs exhibiting PCEs of 15.2% and 13.7%, over 11% and 24% PCE enhancements were achieved in the optimized ternary SMPVs. Morphological characterization indicated the formation of nanoscale phase separation with bicontinuous and hierarchical branched structures in the optimized ternary blend films. Consequently, the optimized ternary SMPVs achieved faster hole and electron transfer processes, suppressed geminate/non-geminate charge recombination, and decreased energetic disorder, as well as enhanced and more balanced carrier mobility.
The structurally similar materials often possess similar absorption characteristics, which play a negligible role in extending the photon harvesting range. Two acceptors with a large difference in structure also exhibit great potential in fabricating efficient ternary SMPVs. Inspired by the successful morphology control by pseudo 2D conjugation, Shan et al. employed the third component with multi-dimensional side chains to optimize active layer morphology.173 They synthesized three small molecular acceptors, namely anti-PDFC, syn-PDFC, and PDFC-Ph. The anti-PDFC and syn-PDFC have spatially orthogonal alkyl chains, enabling bimodal lamellar packing and decent crystallinity. PDFCPh appears to be in the amorphous state in films due to its phenyl-hexyl side chains, which results in the deteriorated original packing of BTR-Cl and Y6 after incorporating PDFC-Ph, and thus a decreased PCE of 12.76% for the PDFC-Ph based ternary SMPVs. When anti-PDFC and syn-PDFC were separately incorporated into the BTR-Cl:Y6 system, anti-PDFC and syn-PDFC not only formed their own crystal phase but also improved the packing order of BTR-Cl, leading to increased charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Consequently, the anti-PDFC and syn-PDFC based ternary SMPVs afforded enhanced PCEs of 14.56% and 14.09% due to the significantly increased charge collection efficiency. This result indicated that the multi-dimensional side chain strategy could be effective to optimize the morphology of small molecular blend films. The PCE of anti-PDFC based SMPVs can be further increased to 15.67% upon adding appropriate PC71BM in the ternary system, revealing that PC71BM can also act as the morphology regulator to optimize the morphology of quaternary blend films. Pradhan et al. synthesized a new small molecule C2 by using diphenylamine to replace dimethylamine in a coumarin-based small molecule C1.174 C2 exhibits red shifted absorption, a deeper HOMO energy level, strengthened crystallinity and denser molecular stacking in comparison with C1. C1 and C2 were respectively used as donors with medium bandgap molecule BThIND-Cl or/and narrow bandgap molecule Y6 as acceptors to fabricate SMPVs. Compared to C1 based SMPVs, the counterparts with C2 as the donor realized a higher PCE, with simultaneously higher JSC, VOC, and FF and lower Eloss. The optimized C1:BThIND-Cl:Y6 and C2:BThIND-Cl:Y6 based ternary SMPVs achieved PCEs of 11.27% and 13.54%, respectively, higher than those of binary counterparts with BThIND-Cl or Y6 as the acceptor. Characterization results revealed that the optimized ternary SMPVs achieved more balanced charge transport, faster charge extraction, and more suppressed charge recombination as well as improved molecular crystallinity and phase separation in ternary active layers. Meanwhile, two acceptors tended to form the alloyed state in ternary blends, and energy transfer from BThIND-Cl to Y6 will happen, leading to an improved exciton utilization in ternary active layers.
4. Summary and perspectives
In the past decade, SMPVs have realized great progress with the PCE advancing from 5% to 17%. The development of SMPVs in the past decade is systematically reviewed including small molecular material innovation, the ternary strategy and novel active layer treatment method. The performance statistical summary of 166 single heterojunction SMPVs in this review is shown in Fig. 19. The statistical average photovoltaic parameters of SMPVs with a PCE over 13% (38 devices) and polymer based OPVs with a PCE over 17% (34 devices) summarized in a recent report175 are also displayed in Fig. 19. It can be clearly observed that the PCE improvement of SMPVs is achieved with the simultaneously increased JSC and FF. The PCE versus JSC and FF exhibit approximately linear distributions, especially for PCE versus JSC. The PCE versus VOC exhibits dispersed distribution characteristics. This phenomenon indicates that JSC and FF are the most critical factors in determining the PCE of SMPVs. Meanwhile, the VOC values of SMPVs with a PCE over 13% are mainly distributed at 0.82–0.87 V with an average value of 0.846 V, which is slightly lower than that of the 0.861 V in polymer based OPVs with a PCE over 17%. To enhance the VOC of SMPVs, efforts are required to be made to further optimize the active layer morphology and design excellent photovoltaic materials with smaller exciton binding energy. The average JSC and FF values of SMPVs with a PCE over 13% are 23.59 mA cm−2 and 72.15%, respectively, which are much lower than those of the 26.20 mA cm−2 and 77.74% in polymer based OPVs with a PCE over 17%, respectively. The much lower JSC and FF values of SMPVs than those of polymer based OPVs are mainly triggered by the undesirable active layer morphology in the all-small-molecule system, leading to inferior exciton dissociation and/or charge transport and extraction. In a polymer/small molecule system, polymer donor materials with long backbones can weave continuous network skeletons for efficient hole transport. Small molecule acceptors may adhere to the continuous network skeletons of polymer donors to form bi-continuous interpenetrating networks. However, in an all-small-molecule system, the charge transport is more intimately dependent on the phase separation morphology, which is difficult to control. The very mixed blend morphology with small phase separation is conducive to exciton dissociation and detrimental to charge transport. The large phase separation is beneficial to charge transport and harmful for exciton dissociation. The SMPVs with a PCE over 13% and polymer based OPVs with a PCE over 17% achieve the average PCE values of 14.39% and 17.55%, respectively. The lower PCE of SMPVs is mainly ascribed to the much lower JSC and FF compared to those of polymer based OPVs, which also further supports the most critical roles of JSC and FF in determining the PCE of SMPVs.

A series of statistical classifications for 38 SMPVs with a PCE over 13% are illustrated in Fig. 20. Most high performance SMPVs are achieved by BDT-central core based donors, which deliver an average PCE of 14.39% and the highest PCE of 17.0%. Other central core based donors such as porphyrin, TBF core, TBD core, and DTBDT core based donors also play an important role in fabricating high performance SMPVs. It is worth paying more attention to develop other central core based small molecular donors. The terminal units of rhodanine and cyanoacetate play important roles in designing excellent small molecular donor materials. Their weak electron-withdrawing properties can enable donor materials with high LUMO levels and thus large bandgaps, further affecting absorption properties.176 Among the 38 SMPVs with a PCE over 13%, sixty-five percent SMPVs are achieved by rhodanine terminal unit based donors, and twenty-one percent SMPVs are achieved by cyanoacetate terminal unit based donors. Modifying the alkyl side chains on rhodanine and cyanoacetate units is of great potential in developing excellent small molecular donors. The development of acceptor Y6 and its derivatives has brought impressive progress in OPVs. At present, most high performance SMPVs are based on Y6 and its derivatives as the acceptor, indicating the great potential of developing the derivatives of Y6 for efficient SMPVs. The ternary strategy has been verified as an effective and simple strategy in improving OPV performance. Nearly forty percent of high performance SMPVs are achieved based on the ternary strategy. It should be highlighted that the best performing SMPVs with a PCE of 17.0% are achieved in the B1:BO-4Cl:BO-2Cl based ternary SMPVs.32 Fullerene derivatives with relatively high electron mobility have been verified to be an excellent morphology regulator to optimize the morphology of ternary blend films. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the hollow spherical structure of fullerene derivatives may connect host acceptor molecules to form more continuous electron transport channels.161,177 Phase separation, domain size and molecular arrangement in active layers can be well optimized by incorporating fullerene derivatives. About thirty-six percent of high performance ternary SMPVs are realized by employing fullerene derivatives as the additional component to optimize active layer morphology. Modification of fullerene derivatives may be a good way to develop efficient morphology regulators for SMPVs. About forty-three percent of high performance ternary SMPVs are achieved by employing two structurally similar small molecular materials as donors or acceptors, which should be an effective material selection strategy for ternary SMPVs. Similar chemical structures can enable good compatibility between small molecular materials, which is conducive to inhibiting the formation of oversized phase separation and facilitating the formation of the alloy state. In addition to selecting the third component as a morphology regulator, the third component should play a significant role in strengthening photon harvesting, decreasing energy loss and improving device stability.

A critical review of the molecular design progress in non-fullerene acceptors was published in ref. 178, which fully summarizes the structure–property relationships of a library of non-fullerene acceptors, highlighting the important chemical modifications that have led to progress in the non-fullerene electron acceptors and providing an outlook for future innovations in electron acceptors for preparing highly efficient OPVs. Developing excellent active layer materials, especially small molecular donor materials, is still the fundamental and effective strategy to further enhance the PCE of SMPVs. Excellent small molecular donor materials need to meet several criteria: (1) good solubility and film formation ability, (2) strong and complementary absorption to acceptors for harvesting more photons, (3) matched energy levels with acceptors for driving efficient charge dissociation and realizing maximum VOC and minimum Eloss, (4) suitable compatibility with acceptors for forming favorable phase separation morphology, (5) good coplanar structure for facilitating ordered molecular packing and high hole mobility, and (6) good chemical and thermal stability. The A–π–D–π–A structure has been proved to be an effective donor structure to adjust molecular properties, such as optical absorption, energy level and molecular stacking and aggregation.179,180 The chemical structure of donor materials should be rationally and elaborately modified by central core engineering, side group engineering, π-bridge engineering and end-group engineering. The key issues of acceptor materials include strong absorption in the NIR region, suitable aligned energy levels and compatibility with donors, high electron mobility, and strong crystallinity with face-on molecular orientation. The most critical issue of acceptor materials is the extension of absorption to a more red-shifted region with a wavelength up to 1000 nm.181 In addition to developing active layer materials, optimizing the device structure and developing effective active layer treatments can help to further enhance the PCE of SMPVs. Ternary BHJ SMPVs are promising in realizing high performance, and they can extend the photon harvesting range as tandem SMPVs while maintaining a simple fabrication process for typical binary BHJ SMPVs. Incorporating a third component can enable multiple roles of enhancing photon harvesting, optimizing molecular arrangement and phase separation morphology, decreasing energy loss, and improving device stability.182,183 Active layer morphology is a critical factor affecting the performance such as charge transport and collection, energy loss, and device stability of SMPVs. Active layer morphology is very sensitive to processing conditions. For realizing better active layer morphology, we need to further investigate the processing conditions, including materials' dissolution conditions, coating methods, and post-treatments. For instance, Tang et al. recently developed a concentration-induced morphology manipulation strategy,74 which is a simple and effective strategy to manipulate the active layer morphology. Recently, a layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition strategy has achieved remarkable success in preparing high performance polymer based OPVs,184–186 benefiting from the separately optimized donor layer and acceptor layer. Favorable vertical phase distribution can be formed in active layers for efficient charge transport and collection, leading to less charge recombination and energy loss. This LBL deposition strategy may be promising in fabricating efficient SMPVs. Non-fullerene based SMPVs generally exhibit better device stability than fullerene derivative based SMPVs. Optimizing the materials' chemical structure is also a fundamental method to enhance device stability. Effective device encapsulation technology is also conducive to enhancing device stability. The actual cost of fabricating SMPVs is much higher than the theoretical cost mainly due to the complex material synthesis. To implement materials on industrial-like devices, the material synthesis demands an industrially compatible and environmental-friendly synthetic method with a short synthetic route and easy purification while maintaining good material properties.187 It is also necessary to develop an effective treatment strategy such as the TSST strategy48 proposed by Min, which can enhance device performance and stability, extend the life cycles of ITO substrates and reduce device production cost. In addition to PCE, stability and cost, the three crucial issues, the scalability of SMPVs with large-area production techniques suitable is also a key issue to the commercialization of SMPVs. Technologies such as blade coating and slot die coating exhibit good potential in large-area roll-to-roll processing. Such technologies can avoid intensive material consumption and allow for a high throughput.178 Three key points need to be addressed to implement the scalability of SMPVs.188 First, the temperatures of both the substrate and ink should be controlled during film deposition. Second, the in situ active layer morphology should be well manipulated by adjusting the boiling point of the solvent and the concentration of the solution during the film deposition by a scalable technique. Green solvents, which respond well to the environment friendly production concept, can perform well compared to halogenated solvents in some cases. Third, solution processed interfacial layers and electrodes should be developed to decrease the cost without vacuum deposition. The well-balanced point among PCE, stability and cost of OPVs will be obtained due to the relentless efforts of researchers from materials, device physics and device engineering fields, leading to the commercial application of OPVs in our daily life.
