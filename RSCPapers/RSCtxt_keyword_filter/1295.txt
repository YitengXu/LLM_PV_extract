    , Accepted 19th June 2017First published on 19th June 2017AbstractEfficient enhancement of photoluminescence in rare-earth activated upconversion materials is of great significance for their practical applications in various fields. In this work, three-dimensional mesoporous gold films were fabricated by a low-cost and facile dealloying approach to improve the upconversion photoluminescence efficiency. The mesoporous Au films exhibit good chemical stability, large-area uniformity and abundant distribution of porous nanospaces. Varying the time of the dealloying process leads to modification of the pore size distribution, surface roughness and residual Ag content, resulting in effective tuning of the wavelength of the broadband localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Enhancement factors were identified to be a function of the dealloying time. With the optimized upconversion photoluminescence enhancement, a 41-fold increase was achieved with the mesoporous gold substrate which had been dealloyed for 8 days. These results pave the way to overcome the limitation of poor upconversion efficiency for widespread practical applications in life science and energy fields.
1. Introduction
Research on lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) has recently attracted considerable attention, driven by their diverse potential applications in solar cells, biomedical imaging, solid-state lasers, display technology, and security printing.1 Upconversion photoluminescence (UCPL) is a nonlinear process, through which one photon at a shorter wavelength is emitted, following successive absorption of two or more photons, at longer wavelengths. Upconversion is one of the most elegant approaches that enhances the performance of all classes of solar cells, and is theoretically predicted to be able to increase the efficiency above the Shockley–Queisser limit.2 Currently, the dominant losses (about 35%) of solar cell efficiency are due to sub-band-gap energy losses.3 An efficient luminescence upconversion system could potentially improve the efficiency of traditional solar cells by harvesting the otherwise lost sub-band-gap photons in the solar spectrum. However, the efficiency of the most promising upconversion material, NaYF4 host lattice doped with Yb3+/Er3+, remains low due to the small absorption cross sections arising from formally forbidden f-level atomic transitions of the dopants.4 As a result, there is negligible progress in the enhanced performance of devices upon incorporating upconversion materials. A very recent report5 demonstrated a 7.9% power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement of perovskite solar cells upon placing the upconversion single crystal in front of the device. Improving the efficiency of UCNPs is urgently needed for their practical applications, especially in solar cells. The emerging field of plasmon-enhanced upconversion is a promising avenue for improving the upconversion efficiency of rare-earth (RE) doped materials. To date, a number of plasmonic geometries such as nanograting,4 disk-coupled dots-on-pillar antenna arrays6 and core–shell nanostructures7,8 have been investigated for enhancing the UCPL. These nanostructures lead to UCPL enhancement from 2.3 times8 to tens of times,9,10 to about 300 times,6 respectively. In our opinion, the wide range of such enhancement factors being reported is not comparable, as the individual systems reported have different pumping power. In addition, the enhancement factors also rely on various factors such as the choice of plasmonic materials, the structural morphology, the distance between UCNPs and the nanostructure surface, and the optical properties of UCNPs and plasmonic nanostructures, etc. However, the difficulties in fabricating high-quality plasmonic substrates over a large area, without stringent experimental conditions, still hinder the practical applications of plasmon enhanced upconversion luminescence. In some cases, the plasmons even quenched rather than enhancing emission.11,12
In this work, we utilize a three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous gold (Au) film, obtained by a free corrosion dealloying process, to enhance the UCPL of hexagonal phase β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ co-doped nanocrystals (Fig. 3a). This dealloying approach is effective for producing mesoporous Au substrates with tuneable pore sizes and an extended framework. Compared to other reported plasmonic structures, the mesoporous Au films have a large area and uniform distribution of porous nanospaces. Due to the existence of abundant nanospaces, these structures also exhibit high carrier density, provide surfaces with sufficient functional sites and thus fascinating optical properties.13 Moreover, the fabrication method utilized is low-cost and large-scale and is easy to control. In this work, by tuning the pore size of mesoporous Au films, a 41-fold luminescence enhancement over a large area (∼1.0 cm2) is achieved. The Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)15 due to the nanopores was measured at ∼550 nm. To obtain physical insights into UCPL enhancement, both the red emission and green emission lifetimes were measured, together with electromagnetic modelling. It was found that, for green emission (∼540 nm), the enhancement was dominated by non-resonant enhancement at the pumping wavelength, and increased with increasing pore size. On the other hand, for red emission, (∼650 nm) both emission enhancement and field enhancement contributed to the UCPL enhancement.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
All reagents were of analytical grade. Yttrium(III) chloride anhydrous powder (YCl3 99.9%), erbium(III) chloride anhydrous powder (ErCl3 99.9%), ytterbium(III) chloride anhydrous powder (YbCl3 99.9), ammonium fluoride (NH4F ≥99.99% trace metal bases), sodium hydroxide (NaOH ACS reagent, ≥97.0%, pellets) and 1-octadecene (technical grade, 90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Oleic acid (OA 70%) was purchased from Fisher Chemical (UK). All silver/gold alloy films used in this work were purchased from Sepp Leaf Products (New York). Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) (Sigma Aldrich, ACS reagent, ≥90.0%) and 18.2 megohm cm ultrapure water were used.
2.2 Fabrication of mesoporous gold films
Silver and gold (Ag–Au) alloy films, with a thickness of ∼100 nm, were floated on the surface of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3), based on a method described by Ding et al.,16 as illustrated in Fig. 1. The samples were exposed to the acid solution for different times (1 min, 3 min, 10 min, 30 min, 2 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 days, or 8 days) to study the effect of dealloying time on the morphology and pore sizes of mesoporous Au films (Fig. S6(a–j), ESI†). The leaf was then transferred to ultrapure water for 35 min to completely quench the dissolution and diffusion reactions. The floated films were then “fished” out of the solution on the surface of glass substrates previously coated with an amine self-assembled monolayer, by treating them with 4% v/v APTES (aminopropyltriethoxysilane) in acetone. This amine monolayer has a high affinity to Au atoms, increases adhesion of the Au film to the glass substrate and prevents its delamination during subsequent processing steps. The fished samples were finally allowed to dry in an ambient atmosphere and were used for morphological and optical characterization, and subsequent fabrication processes.

2.3 Synthesis of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs
In a typical thermal decomposition synthesis process,22,23 chloride-based rare earth precursors yttrium chloride (YCl3 99%), ytterbium chloride (YbCl3 99%), and erbium chloride (ErCl3 99%) were used as dopant precursors. To fulfil the percentage composition, 0.75 mmol of yttrium chloride (YCl3 99%), 0.064 mmol of ytterbium chloride (YbCl3 99%), and 0.02 mmol of erbium chloride (ErCl3 99%) were all mixed in a three-neck round-bottom flask with 4 mL of Oleic Acid (OA) and 15 mL of Octadecene (ODE).
All of the mixtures were then heated at 150 °C in an open environment to remove all of the unnecessary elements such as oxygen and water for 40 minutes. The colour of the mixture changed from a soft yellowish cloudy transparent solution to a clear strong yellowish solution. The change in colour indicates that all of the powder precursors had been dissolved completely. Then 2.5 mmol of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 5 mL of methanol and 4 mmol of ammonium fluoride (NH4F) in 5 mL of methanol were prepared separately and sonicated for about 15 minutes to be fully dissolved. Afterwards, both of them were quickly injected into the dopant solution at room temperature with vigorous stirring. After injection of sodium hydroxide and an ammonium fluoride methanol solution simultaneously, the mixed solution of the dopant and the crystal host was heated up to 50 °C for 30 minutes under vacuum to remove methanol. Then, the solution was continued to be heated up to 320 °C under gentle argon gas flow for 90 minutes. Finally, the UCNP product was washed and centrifuged (4500 rpm.) using ethanol and cyclohexane in sequence and was repeated 3 times, respectively. The colloidal solution of UCNPs in cyclohexane was stored in a refrigerator (4 °C) for further use.
2.4 Characterisation of UCNPs and plasmon-enhanced upconversion structures
The particle size, size distribution, phase, and homogeneity of as-synthesized UCNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM-2100F), combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Oxford Instruments, UK), at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For TEM sample preparation, the resulting white precipitates of synthesized UCNPs were dispersed in cyclohexane by ultrasonic sonication for 30 minutes. Several drops of the suspension were drop-casted onto a carbon-coated copper TEM grid. Finally, the samples were allowed to dry in air for 120 minutes and were analysed by TEM. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a LEO Gemini 1525 field emission gun (FEG) SEM (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, UK) to further characterize the phase and phase distribution of the UCNPs. For SEM sample preparation, the UCNP suspension was drop-casted onto a clean transparent glass substrate. Then, a 10 nm layer of gold (Au) was sputter-coated on the surface of the glass substrate with UCNPs to inhibit charging and reduce thermal damage. SEM was also used to investigate the surface morphology of the Au mesoporous substrates.
2.5 Optical characterization
UV Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy was performed using the Agilent Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy system to characterize the plasmonic properties of the mesoporous Au films. Glass substrates were used for holding all the samples, as they do not have a restricted wavelength range within our scanning range. Scans were performed over the range of 300 to 2400 nm, at a scanning rate of 100 nm min−1 and a bandwidth of 0.1 nm. The baseline correction was performed using clean glass substrates. All the spectra presented here were obtained using unpolarized light.
2.6 Photoluminescence (PL) measurements
The fluorescence emission measurements were obtained using a Fluorolog®-3 Spectrofluorometer system from Horiba Scientific, equipped with a LSR980H steady state laser with adjustable power supply from LASEVER. The angle of acquisition was fixed at 30° for accuracy and consistency of the measurements. The samples were excited using a 980 nm NIR light laser with a power density of 500 mW cm−2 and the upconversion emissions were measured in the range of 450–700 nm, using a slit size of 5 nm. The enhancement factor due to the plasmonic Au substrates was estimated using the equation: (1)where I is the upconversion photoluminescence intensity obtained from UCNPs coated on top of a mesoporous Au substrate or on a glass reference substrate, while Iglass represents the noise signal from the clean glass substrate. This equation does not take into account any corrections for the surface area coverage of the UCNPs. Our substrates were prepared by the drop-casting technique, which ensures that the UCNP densities on both the Au mesoporous film and the glass control were identical. This was further confirmed by counting the number of UCNPs within the same area in SEM images of both surfaces (Fig. 7 and Fig. S9, ESI†). Therefore the UCPL enhancement observed is only due to the plasmonic influence of Au mesoporous films.
2.7 Photoluminescence lifetime measurements
Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), which is considered as the most sensitive digital technique for determining photoluminescence lifetimes, was applied to obtain dynamic data of upconversion photoluminescence of the as-prepared samples.25 We used the DeltaDiode™ 980L pulsed laser (Horiba Scientific) to statistically characterize the time-dependent photoluminescence emission profiles of the as-synthesized UCNPs by repeating the excitation–emission process up to 5000 counts. The DD-980L laser source has a peak wavelength at 980 ± 10 nm, an extremely narrow 100 picosecond pulse width, and 0.2 mW power on average, and the repetition rate is 50 MHz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Plasmon-enhanced upconverters
A simple and reproducible plasmonic upconversion structure was fabricated, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The structure was composed of four parts: a transparent glass substrate for support, a mesoporous Au layer, followed by an 8 nm SiO2 spacer layer (thickness was controlled using a sensitive detector of the Mantis Deposition System), and a sub-monolayer of the UCNPs on top. The fabrication of mesoporous Au films on glass substrates was based on a free-corrosion dealloying process, which produces continuous Au films with a wide range of tuneable pore sizes.16–18 By exposing Au films to a concentrated nitric acid solution for varying times, the morphology and pore size of mesoporous Au films could be modified.18,19

3.2 Morphological and compositional analysis of mesoporous Au films
When as-received Ag–Au alloy films were floated on the surface of concentrated nitric acid through surface tension, Ag dissolution started immediately, initiating the dealloying process. Dealloying of the films was visually apparent by the change in their colour. SEM imaging revealed the porosity evolution of the films with dealloying times of 1 minute and 8 days, respectively, which led to an increase in the ligament and average pore sizes (Fig. 4a, b and 5(a)) in agreement with published literature.19 The average ligament spacing as a function of dealloying time from 1 minute to 8 days is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) in detail. For the UCPL enhancement study, we only chose four representative samples, i.e. samples with dealloying times of 3 min, 10 min, 12 hours, and 8 days. The corresponding average pore sizes were 5 nm, 15 nm, 52 nm, and 72 nm, respectively. The significant decrease of Ag content with time due to dissolution results in the generation of more pores in the structure of the Au film. After 3 days of dealloying, the pore sizes reached a plateau. The residual Ag content of the mesoporous Au films, which depends on the dealloying time, was investigated by SEM-EDX analysis of the entire sample (Fig. 5(b)). EDX analysis showed that the Ag content declined rapidly after reaction with HNO3. In these experiments Ag was not detected at dealloying times greater than 30 min, which could be attributed to the presence of Ag content lower than the detection limit, even though previous work19 suggests that up to 8% Ag is trapped inside the Au ligaments.

In addition to Ag dissolution, surface diffusion of Au is responsible for porosity evolution. At the very early stages of the reaction, the porous network was not continuous following dealloying times of 1 minute (Fig. S6(a), ESI†) and 3 minutes (Fig. S8, ESI†), and the porosity was not uniformly distributed. As the dealloying times increased beyond 5 minutes, the porous structure became homogeneous and well-developed, and porosity evolution was dominated by the surface diffusion process. A growth in ligament size and spacing was observed, since Au atoms rearrange themselves in such a way so as to lower their free energy and entropy. Adjusting the dealloying process parameters, such as alloy composition, time and temperature, enables us to control the surface features of the mesoporous Au films for the optimization of their specific performances. The optical properties of the mesoporous films are in turn controlled by the resultant surface morphology and chemistry, features that can be tailored by processing time.
3.3 Plasmonic enhancement of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was used to investigate the plasmon-enhanced upconversion photoluminescence by the Au mesoporous films. The upconversion emission spectra of UC nanocrystals deposited on a series of plasmon-enhanced structures upon 980 nm laser excitation with a power density of ∼500 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  UCPL intensities of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs on reference substrate and Au mesoporous films with pore sizes of 72 nm, 52 nm, 15 nm and 5 nm, which correspond to dealloying times of 8 days, 12 hours, 10 min, and 3 min, respectively. 
This figure shows three main emission peaks centred at 520 nm, 540 nm, 660 nm, resulting from 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 2S9/2 → 4I15/2 energy transitions in the Er3+ rare-earth ions, respectively. It has been previously reported that the effect of plasmonic structures on upconversion can be due to two competing processes, either enhancement or surface quenching, which is very distance sensitive.20 The electromagnetic (EM) field strength decays exponentially as a function of inverse fourth-power distance away from the plasmonic surface.21 In our case, UCPL measurements revealed a strong quenching effect of UCPL (Fig. S7, ESI†), when the UCNPs were deposited directly onto the mesoporous Au substrates without a spacer layer. In this situation, the emissions of the UCNPs relaxed rapidly by nonradiative energy transfer into the surface plasmon resonance. At an optimised distance from the plasmonic surface, resonance energy transfer from the UCNPs to the Au plasmon surface is decreased, while the enhanced EM field can still be strong enough to improve the UCPL efficiency. As shown in Table 1, it was demonstrated that the PL signals were significantly enhanced on Au mesoporous film samples with an 8 nm SiO2 spacer. The PL intensity of the UCNPs on mesoporous Au films with an average pore size of 72 nm exhibited the best enhancement performance with 32× and 41× enhancement factors, for peaks centred at 541 nm and 656 nm, respectively. There are two main pathways of enhancement: excitation enhancement and emission enhancement. Excitation enhancement indicates an improvement in the light absorption of sensitizer ions as a result of the dramatically strengthened local electric field (E) in the vicinity of the surface of plasmonic nanostructures. In parallel, emission enhancement indicates an increase in the radiative decay rate of the activator doped in UCNPs, which can be significantly increased due to coupling between electrons and phonons.26 Theoretical studies show that when a UCNP is located at the vicinity of a metallic structure, an effective coupling exists between the transition dipole of the UCNP and the SPR-induced electric field. The fundamental characteristic of excitation enhancement is that it directly enhances the local field of the UCNPs, thereby causing higher emission intensities without changing the intrinsic characteristics of decay processes. In contrast, emission enhancement occurs due to the increased radiative decay rate, reduced quenching effect and lower localized temperature.10 In light of these considerations, the observed enhancement in upconversion efficiency can possibly be due to both metal-induced enhancement of absorption of the excitation pump at 980 nm (excitation enhancement) and plasmonic enhancement of the emission of the UCNPs (emission enhancement).

Besides the significant enhancement factors, a clear trend was also observed that the UCPL signals were a function of the dealloying time, i.e. the increase in the mesopore size and the reduction of the residual Ag content in the mesoporous film (Fig. 6 and Table 1). After 8 days of the dealloying process, the pore size of the mesoporous Au film reached its plateau. The film became unstable and fragile with extended dealloying times longer than 8 days. The increased enhancement factors with increasing pore sizes, indicating a significant increase in interaction between the electromagnetic waves with the mesoporous gold surface at the visible/NIR region, are possibly due to the increased electromagnetic field enhancement around bigger pores. The plasmon oscillation of the free electrons around the centre of the uniform nanopores can effectively collect and confine light from the near-infrared (NIR) to the visible region into the cavity areas, building up a high density of ‘hot spots’ in the nanopores,13,14 suggesting that a significant upconversion photoluminescence enhancement is possible due to this electric field enhancement. The random coverage of UCNPs on the mesoporous Au film (Fig. 7) indicates that there is still further potential to improve the enhancement, by adjusting the pore size of the mesoporous Au with respect to the size of UCNPs, as well as the distribution of UCNPs.
 Fig. 7  Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the UCNPs sub-monolayer deposited on 72 nm mesoporous Au substrates dealloyed for 8 days. The scale bar in this figure is 100 nm. 
To investigate the fundamental optical properties of the mesoporous Au films, UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy measurements were performed on selected mesoporous Au films. Fig. 8 shows the UV-Vis transmission spectra corresponding to Au mesoporous films with average pore sizes of 5 nm, 15 nm, 52 nm and 72 nm, respectively. Structural imperfections, pore size distribution, surface roughness and residual Ag content may all affect the optical behaviour of the Au films.24 The localised plasmon resonance is observed in all cases at around 530 nm, and there is a slight red-shift with increasing pore size. The other observation is that the spectra have a broader band as the pore size increases, indicating a tuneable interaction of the mesoporous structures with electromagnetic waves in the broad frequency region. As presented in Fig. 8, the transmission of light increased gradually with the increase in average pore size. Clearly, there is a spectral overlap between the 541 nm emission of UCNPs and the UV-Visible spectra of mesoporous films, which may lead to the resonant energy transfer from the 541 nm green emission to the Au mesoporous film. This energy transfer effect may contribute to the fact that enhancement factors for green emissions (at 541 nm) were slightly weaker than those for red emissions (at 656 nm) (Table 1).

To obtain further insight of the enhancement mechanism, the change in the decay rate of the UCNPs at 541 nm and 656 nm were measured by time-resolved UCPL, respectively. The decay times were measured by a series of duration controllable pulsed DeltaDiode laser, and the decay curves were fitted by a DAS6 Analysis software expressed as an exponential function: I = A + B × exp(−i/T)(2)The decay curve is mainly determined by the second excited level of Er3+, as well as the population of the first excited level of Er3+ and Yb3+. The green emission (at 541 nm) lifetimes measured on the glass substrate and on the mesoporous Au film were 220 μs and 212 μs, respectively (Table 2). The two similar decay rates measured here (Fig. 9a) suggest that the emission enhancement of UCPL at 541 nm was negligible. In contrast, the red emission lifetimes obtained from the reference glass sample and mesoporous Au film sample were 506 μs and 467 μs, respectively. The lifetime of the upconversion red emission at 656 nm on the mesoporous Au film was calculated to be 39 μs, which is shorter than its original lifetime exhibited on the reference sample. These results suggest that there is negligible enhancement due to the localised surface plasmon resonance. To consider this further, electromagnetic modelling using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique was carried out.27,28 Details of the modelling are included in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S3), but, in summary, nanoholes of the same diameter as the average nanopores were considered in a periodic array. The holes had a depth of 100 nm and the spacing between adjacent holes was considered to be 40% of the hole diameter. The FDTD results (Fig. S1, ESI†) showed a red shift (505 nm to 547 nm) with increasing nanopore size (5–72 nm) and a widening of the absorbance bandwidth. By considering small dipoles placed above the mesoporous film, FDTD calculations also showed an insignificant emission enhancement at 541 nm and a small enhancement (1.4x − 2x) dependent on the placement of the emitter at 656 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The electromagnetic modelling is in qualitative agreement with the lifetime measurement, suggesting that the enhancement mechanism is predominantly an excitation enhancement and not a plasmonic enhancement of the emission. A further calculated electromagnetic field enhancement at the excitation wavelength for periodic arrays of 72 nm nanoholes shows magnitudes of between 1 and 1.5 in the space above the holes (Fig. S2, ESI†). This leads us to believe that the enhancement is due to the random morphology of the mesoporous surface causing non-resonant enhancement. The exact mechanism will be the subject of future investigation. To further rationalize the observed results of mesoporous Au film enhanced UCPL, one has to consider the intrinsic quantum efficiency of an emitter, Q, which is defined by,29 Q = krad/(krad + knr)(3)where the quantum efficiency is the ratio of the radiative decay rate (krad) and the nonradiative decay rate (knr). Note that the emitter quantum efficiency is related but not equivalent to the upconversion efficiency.

(b) Time-resolved measurements of the upconversion emission at 660 nm of the UCNPs deposited on the 12 hours dealloyed mesoporous Au film (green dots), and the UCNPs deposited on the reference sample – clean glass substrate (red dots), respectively. 
The UCPL lifetime, which means the average time the excited states spend before relaxation to the ground state, can be described by the following equation τ = 1/(krad + knr)(4)and it is the inverse of the sum of decay rates of all the decay pathways. Hence we can obtain an alternative equation for quantum efficiency: Q = krad·τ(5)Both radiative and nonradiative decay rates can be modified by the presence of the plasmonic surface such as the mesoporous Au film.30 The plasmonic effect provides extra pathways for UC and alters the emission dynamics and the new UCPL lifetime (τ0) can be obtained. By comparing steady-state UCPL intensity data and lifetime measurement data between the mesoporous sample and the reference sample, the enhanced UCPL intensity and decreased lifetime τ0 at 656 nm indicate an increase in the radiative decay rate krad.31 On the other hand, the enhanced UCPL intensity and a weak change in the lifetime at 541 nm suggest negligible decay rate modifications. To understand the plasmonic effect on the pumping power density dependence, the green emission peaked at 541 nm and the red emission at 656 nm from the reference sample (UCNPs deposited on clean glass) and the enhanced sample (the same amount of UCNPs deposited on the 52 nm mesoporous Au substrate) were measured at the same set of excitation power densities, respectively. As a nonlinear effect, the intensity of UCPL (Suc) is simply a function increasing the pumping power density (Inpump) Sup ∝ Inpump(6)UCPL for both green and red emissions is dominated by the energy transfer upconversion (ETU). For both green and red emissions, the luminescence intensity exhibited a quadratic dependence (n = 2) on the excitation power density at a low power regime, and exhibited a linear dependence (n = 1) at a high power regime.4,6 As a result, the exponent factor n is expected to decrease from 2 to 1 as Ipump is tuned from low power to high power. The population of the second excited level will grow large and Sup will saturate at extremely high Ipump. Upconversion is a non-linear process, which also means that the upconversion quantum yield of the UCNPs itself increases at stronger power densities.32
In Table 3, we can see that the exponential factor n of the mesoporous Au enhanced sample is equal to the reference sample (Fig. 10(a)), as shown by the calculated result nAu = nref = 1.70 ± 0.02, where the power dependence of log(Ipump) − log(Suc) is consistent for both substrates in the low pumping power limit (below 5.35 W cm−2). Again, consistent with the negligible change in lifetime at green emission (541 nm), the unchanged exponential factor n further confirmed that the enhancement mechanism of UCPL at 541 nm was mainly due to excitation enhancement. The exponential factors at the 656 nm red emission calculated from the reference sample are 1.88 ± 0.03 and 1.82 ± 0.05 from the mesoporous enhanced sample, respectively (Fig. 10(b)). The slightly reduced exponent factor agrees well with the slightly decreased lifetime (39 μs), as well as the higher enhancement factor at red emission (656 nm) compared with that at green emission (541 nm). Alternatively, the UCPL enhancement at 656 nm channels suggests the contributions of both excitation enhancement and emission enhancement.

4. Conclusions
In summary, 3D mesoporous Au films fabricated by a dealloying process were prepared and optimized by tuning their pore sizes with respect to dealloying times. These films induced a significant enhancement of UCPL of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ co-doped nanocrystals, with a significant enhancement over a large uniform area, and a constant enhancement factor for low pumping power density. The UCPL enhancement measurements and the time-resolved UCPL study indicate that enhanced UCPL is dominated by the excitation enhancement at 541 nm, and a combination of excitation enhancement and emission enhancement at 656 nm. The high emission intensity enhancement, together with other fascinating advantages, such as low-cost, high throughput and reproducibility, makes the plasmonic 3D mesoporous Au film platform an excellent candidate for realizing the high efficiency of UCPL.
