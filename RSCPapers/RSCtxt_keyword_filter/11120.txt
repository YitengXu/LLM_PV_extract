    , Accepted 18th September 2021First published on 20th September 2021AbstractMost polymer donors developed so far for high-performance non-fullerene OSCs are designed in planar molecular geometries containing BDT units. In this work, two donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers with wide band-gap, namely, PY3 and PY4, were designed and synthesized by introducing halogen atoms (F, Cl) into the donor units of polymers. We dismissed the π-bridge and fused it to the A unit (BTz), presenting a different electron-deficient unit labeled as fused-DTBTz, forming a D–A structure with halogenated BDT units. PY3 with fluorine has a deeper HOMO level and a slight bathochromic-shift compared with PY4 with a chlorine atom, and shows good thermal stability among the two polymers. The reasonable halogenated D-unit in D–A polymers is beneficial for effectively promoting the intermolecular packing and crystalline properties, and thus enhancing the charge separation and transfer as reported previously. The best-performing PY3:IT-4Cl-based device afforded a high PCE of 11.20% with a VOC of 0.798 V, a JSC of 19.09 mA cm−2, and an FF of 73.5%, and the OSCs based on PY4:IT-4F delivered a PCE of 12.51%, with a noticeably elevated VOC of 0.874 V, a JSC of 20.26 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.7%. The results showed that chlorinated polymers have a more suitable energy level to match the acceptors than their fluorinated counterparts, thus effectively improving the FF and JSC of photovoltaic devices. Therefore, there is much room for enhancement in photovoltaic properties with rational halogenation of the D moiety of D–A polymers.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells have become one of the most state-of-the-art photovoltaic technologies due to their flexibility, light weight, semitransparency, and applications for large area devices.1–5 However, the development of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been lagging behind for a long time due to the fixed frontier energy levels of fullerene acceptors and the prerequisite offset of energy levels between the donor and the acceptor.3,6,7 For example, the band-gaps of most efficient donor materials are too wide with a narrow absorption range smaller than 800 nm, making it difficult to realize commercialization.8 Therefore, researchers are exploring the potential of nonfullerene acceptors with easy-tuning energy levels and absorption properties to make up for the shortage of donor polymers.9–12 So far, with strenuous efforts made in synthetic tailoring on organic conjugated polymers and small molecular acceptors, for example the benzodithiophene (BDT)-based donors (PBDB-T, PM6) and fused-ring electron acceptors (ITIC, Y6),13–17 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have exceeded 18%.18–20
It is well-known that halogenation (F, Cl, Br) is an effective approach to generate ordered crystalline structures for a faster charge mobility through inter- or intra-molecular interactions, which is beneficial for the enhancement of short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of OSCs.21–26 The previous studies of halogenation on donor–acceptor (D–A) donors indicate that it can be roughly divided into two categories.27 One is that halogen atoms are located in the A unit. For example, non-fullerene OSCs based on J50 (non-fluorinated BTz):ITIC delivered a low PCE of 4.80% with an open–circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.71 V, a JSC of 12.93 mA cm−2, and an FF of 53%.28 For comparison, OSCs fabricated from J51 (fluorinated BTz):ITIC reached a much higher PCE of 9.26% with a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 16.47 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69%.29 The second category is the substitution of halogen atoms in D units. Compared with PBDB-T, PM6 has better energy level matching and molecular stacking with acceptor Y6, affording an impressive PCE of 15.7%.15,30–32 Fluorination is effective and multifunctional in OPV materials, such as to lower the energy levels, improve the VOC of OSCs, increase the molecular planarity, and modulate the bulk-heterojunction morphologies.9,33,34 However, fluorination is of relatively high-cost because of the tedious synthesis with low yields.35,36 Alternatively, chlorination with low-cost synthesis steps should also be considered. Moreover, chlorination is more efficient than fluorination in tuning the electrical and optical properties of organic semiconductors. Cl atoms have a larger atomic size than F atoms, which is beneficial for enhancing the crystalline properties and intermolecular packing, thus improving the charge transport.16,37 Nevertheless, chlorination may produce a negative effect because of its large steric hindrance.27 Therefore, how to balance the merits and demerits brought by the introduction of halogen atoms is worthy of further study.
Herein, we designed two efficient wide band-gap D–A conjugated polymers, namely PY3 and PY4, with fluorination and chlorination in the D moiety, respectively (Scheme 1). Compared to traditional D-π-A structural polymers, the π-bridge was tactically dismissed and fused, presenting a different electron-deficient unit fused-DTBTz, which acts as an A moiety to form a D–A polymer with halogenated BDT. Due to the low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the two polymers, the devices were fabricated by blending IT-4F and IT-4Cl with PY3 and PY4. The optimal OSCs based on PY3:IT-4Cl exhibited a PCE of 11.20% with a VOC of 0.798 V, a JSC of 19.09 mA cm−2, and an FF of 73.5%. The best-performing PY4:IT-4F-based device exhibited a PCE of 12.51%, with a noticeably elevated VOC of 0.874V, a JSC of 20.26 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.7%. The results showed that the reasonably halogenated D-unit in D–A polymers can effectively promote the intermolecular packing and crystalline properties, and thus enhancing the charge separation and transfer. In addition, chlorinated polymers may have a more suitable energy level to match the acceptor molecules than their fluorinated counterparts, thus obtaining higher FF and JSC in the devices.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic details of monomers and two polymers are shown in the ESI.† The chemical structures of chemicals were characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The two polymers were synthesized by Stille polymerization. The number average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were estimated by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography. As shown in Table 1, the Mn and PDI of PY3 and PY4 were determined to be 24.7 kDa/2.45 and 33.6 kDa/2.06, respectively. Besides, the two polymers show good thermal stability, confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements (Fig. 1a). The decomposition temperatures (Td) with 5% weight loss are determined to be 409.7 °C for PY3, and 431.2 °C for PY4, making it feasible to optimize the resultant OSCs, such as with a thermal annealing process.38

To investigate the optical properties of polymers in solution and solid state, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PY3 and PY4 are shown in Fig. 1b and c and the data are collected in Table 1. The absorption peaks between 300 and 400 nm should be attributed to the p–p* transition due to the accumulation of PY3 and PY4 polymer backbones.39 Similarly, there were two strong and distinct absorption peaks in the range of 500–600 nm. The absorption peaks around 500 nm stem from intramolecular charge transfer. The intermolecular interactions result in strong absorption at about 600 nm, which were considered as the “aggregation peak” as previously reported.40 Relative to the absorption profiles in dilute solutions, minor offsets are detected in the absorption spectra in films. This suggests the high crystallinity of both polymers, given the obvious aggregation peaks even in the dilute solutions. Based on the onset wavelengths of absorption spectra in films, the optical band-gaps of PY3 and PY4 were calculated to be 2.03 eV and 2.00 eV, respectively. We further acquired the temperature-dependent absorption spectra of PY3 and PY4 in dilute chlorobenzene solutions with the temperatures varying from 10 °C to 80 °C to evaluate the aggregation behavior of polymers. As displayed in Fig. 1d and e, the aggregation peaks of PY3 and PY4 in solution are still remarkable, even in hot solutions. This verifies the strong intermolecular and intramolecular interactions of the two polymers again, which are essential for effective molecular stacking and conducive to charge transport.41,42 The energy levels of the two polymers were calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, and the detailed onset oxidation/reduction potentials are displayed in Fig. 1f. At a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, the oxidation potential of Fc/Fc+ (EFc/Fc+) was determined to be 0.39 V. The initial oxidation potentials of the polymers PY3 and PY4 are 1.21 eV and 1.22 eV, respectively. According to the equations of EHOMO = −e (Eox + 4.8 − EFc/Fc+), the HOMO energy level was calculated to be −5.62 eV and −5.63 eV for PY3 and PY4, respectively. The deep HOMO energy levels of the two polymers are advantageous for OSCs to achieve high VOC parameters. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined to be −3.59 eV and −3.63 eV for PY3 and PY4, respectively.
2.2 DFT calculations
In order to evaluate the variations of the molecular conformations with different halogenations, density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level was used to calculate the spatial configurations of PY3 and PY4.43 As shown in Fig. 2, the long alkyl side chains were replaced by methyl groups to reduce the calculation time. Two repeat units were utilized to conduct the calculations. From an overall perspective, the two polymers exhibit favorable molecular planarity, which is of significance for efficient intermolecular assembly.44 However, the dihedral angle between the DTBTz and 2F-BDT moieties of PY3 (2.06°) is higher than those of PY4 (1.00°) and PY1 (0.34°).45 The results show that the introduction of halogen atoms can slightly reduce the conjugation planarity. Although fluorination can tune the π-electronic properties without causing unexpected steric hindrance, compared with chlorine atoms, fluorinated molecules can produce many non-covalent interactions, such as F⋯H, F⋯S, and F⋯π, which also affect the molecular planarity to a certain extent. The HOMO orbitals of the two polymers are mainly distributed in the main chain, while the LUMO orbitals are mainly distributed in the acceptor group. Based on theoretical calculations, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PY3 were −5.01 eV and −2.40 eV, respectively, and those of PY4 were −5.06 eV and −2.44 eV, respectively, which demonstrate a similar variation tendency to the CV measurements.

2.3 Photovoltaic properties
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/PDINO/Al to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the polymer. PY3 and PY4 were utilized as the donor materials, and nonfullerene acceptors IT-4F and IT-4Cl were used as the acceptor materials. All the chemical structures and energy levels of photovoltaic materials are collected in Fig. 3a. The device construction is illustrated in Fig. 3b. The fabrication conditions (including donor/acceptor weight ratios, active layer thickness, and thermal annealing) were fully optimized. The device parameters of the optimal OSCs are presented in Table 2 and Table S1 (ESI†) and the respective current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4a. As a result, the optimal device under thermal annealing fabricated from PY3:IT-4Cl reached a PCE of 11.20%, with a VOC of 0.798 V, a JSC of 19.09 mA cm−2, and an FF of 73.5%. In comparison, the OSCs based on PY4:IT-4F achieved their best PCE of 12.51%, with an elevated VOC of 0.874 V, a higher JSC of 20.26 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.7%. As shown in Fig. 4b, the dark current density of the PY4 based device was suppressed compared to that of PY3, which should be one contributor for the higher JSC of solar cells.24 The magnitude of the saturation dark current density (Jd) can be determined in accordance with the Shockley equation. The Jd of the device based on PY4:IT-4F is significantly lower than that of the device based on PY3:IT-4Cl, resulting in a higher VOC of the PY4:IT-4F-based device, as per the equation: VOC = nkBTln(JSC/Jd)/q, where the n is the ideality factor, kBT is the thermal energy, and q is the elementary charge.46 In most cases, chlorinated polymers may show broader absorption spectra and lower energy levels than their fluorinated counterparts, which contribute to higher VOC and JSC in photovoltaic devices. As previous studies have shown, chlorination can also effectively increase the VOC.47,48 Cl atoms have a larger atomic size than F atoms, and the resulting enhanced overlap of π electrons is conducive to enhancing the intermolecular packing and crystalline properties and thus charge separation and transfer.27

2.4 Charge transport, recombination, and extraction
To better evaluate the charge transport of OSCs, we studied the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of the best-performing devices. Fig. 4c displays the Jph (the difference between the light and dark current densities) and is plotted with respect to the Veff (the difference between the applied voltage and the V0, the voltage when Jph is 0) of devices with different polymers. The exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss(E, T)) is related to the electric field (E) and temperature (T), and is defined as (Jph/Jsat) under short-circuit conditions (V0 = 0 V), where Jsat is the saturated value, at which time all photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge collected by the electrode.49,50 Under short-circuit conditions (Veff = VOC), the Pdiss(E, T) of the two devices was calculated to be 95% and 94%, respectively. The high Pdiss(E, T) of the devices based on PY3 and PY4 indicates the effective exciton dissociation behaviors. In addition, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity (P) was measured to evaluate the charge carrier recombination behavior for the optimized devices. The fitting equation for the correlation between JSC and P in devices is Jph ∝ PS, and the bimolecular recombination losses are fully suppressed when the slope of the fitted line is close to 1.51 In Fig. 4d, the slope of the JSC–P plot for the OSCs based on PY3 and PY4 is 0.993 and 0.989, respectively, which further suggests that the two polymers can effectively reduce the carrier recombination and promote charge carrier transfer in the active layer.
Additionally, the electron (μe) and hole (μh) mobilities were measured via the space charge limited current method. The device structures of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/PDINO/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/MoO3/Al were used to measure μe and μh, respectively. The calculation formula is J = 9εε0μV2/8d3, where J represents the current density, ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant, V is the voltage drop, and d is the thickness of the blend.52Fig. 4e and f exhibit the plots of the current density versus voltage of hole-only and electron-only devices. The μh and μe of the PY3:IT-4Cl device were determined to be 1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh and μe of the PY4:IT-4F device were determined to be 1.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As we all know, higher and more balanced charge transfer behavior inside the BHJ blends could be beneficial for the record of satisfactory JSC, FF, and the final PCEs. As shown in Table 2, both devices afford a relatively low ratio of hole to electron mobility, which was conducive to reducing charge recombination losses and obtaining high device efficiency.
2.5 Film morphology
The blend with a high-quality interpenetrating network structure is of vital significance for high-performance OSCs. Therefore, the surface and internal film morphologies of PY3 and PY4 based active layers were assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the two optimal BHJ blend films of PY3:IT-4Cl and PY4:IT-4F displayed comparable nanoscale surface morphology characteristics with a relatively low and similar root mean square surface roughness of 3.31 and 3.13 nm, respectively. From the internal morphology based on the characterization of TEM, it could be seen that the BHJ films fabricated by PY4:IT-4F exhibit more intensive nanoscale phase-separation characteristics than the PY3:IT-4Cl-based blend films. The finely dispersed morphology of the BHJ blend film is known to be more beneficial for effective exciton diffusion as well as charge separation and transport.53

3. Conclusion
In summary, two D–A type donor polymers with wide band-gap, namely PY3 and PY4, were synthesized by introducing halogen atoms (F, Cl) into the donor units of polymers. In the construction of high-performance OSC materials, the strategy of halogenation can effectively control the morphology of the active layer and the molecular energy levels as well as the charge transport. Due to the difference between F and Cl, PY3 has a deeper HOMO level and a slight bathochromic-shift compared with PY4. We used a series of ITIC-based small molecules as acceptors to characterize devices. The best-performing PCEs based on PY3 and PY4 were 11.20% and 12.51%, respectively. Among them, the optimal VOC of PY3:IT-4Cl was 0.798 V, JSC was 19.09 mA cm−2, and FF was 73.5%. The optimal VOC of PY4:IT-4F was 0.874 V, JSC was 20.26 mA cm−2, and FF was 70.7%. The results showed that chlorination is more effective than fluorination in this work in promoting the intermolecular packing and crystalline properties and thus the charge separation and transport. Chlorinated polymers may have a more suitable energy level to match the acceptor molecules than their fluorinated counterparts, which contributes to higher FF and JSC in the resulting photovoltaic devices. Therefore, this study sheds some light on the halogenation strategy in designing high performance donor materials.
