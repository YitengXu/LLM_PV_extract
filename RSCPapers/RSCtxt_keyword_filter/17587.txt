    , Accepted 20th November 2022First published on 21st November 2022AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid lead halides have recently attracted special attention due to their excellent photophysical properties, which drive a variety of optoelectronic applications. However, the toxicity of lead limits their extensive applications. Here, we synthesize three new lead-free organic–inorganic zinc halides, phenylethylammonium zinc bromide, 4-methylphenethylammonium zinc bromide, and 4-methoxyphenethylammonium zinc bromide. X-ray crystallography confirms the zero-dimensional structure of these compounds and their components organic cations and inorganic tetrahedral ZnBr42− anions. These compounds were further characterized by IR and Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. All the compounds exhibit white photoluminescence with CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.25, 0.30), (0.29, 0.36), and (0.28, 0.36), and correlated color temperatures of 12185, 7421, and 8184 K for 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a low-cost and environmentally friendly material platform for photoelectric applications.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are emerging semiconducting materials that show promise in a variety of optoelectronic applications, for example, photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser technologies, X-ray imaging, etc.1–5 In particular, organic–inorganic lead halide hybrids were widely studied due to their outstanding photophysical properties, such as a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, exceptional defect tolerance, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY).6–10 Lead halide hybrid based solar cells and LEDs have achieved an exciting power conversion efficiency (>25%) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) (>20%).1,11 However, the intrinsic toxicity of lead limits its large-scale and extensive applications.12
Recently, plenty of environment-friendly lead-free OIMHs have been reported. Sn2+-based halide hybrids are considered the most promising alternative to Pb2+-based halide hybrids because Sn2+ has a similar electronic configuration and ionic radius to Pb2+.13 Rogach and co-workers discovered a zero-dimensional (0D) Sn2+ halide hybrid ODASnBr4 (ODA: 1,8-octanediamine) with a high PLQY approaching 90%.14 Ma et al. reported a 0D Sn2+-based halide hybrid [(PEA)4SnBr6][(PEA)Br]2[CCl2H2]2 with a broadband yellow emission at 550 nm and a PLQY of ∼90%.15 A one-dimensional (1D) OIMH, (DAO)Sn2I6, was synthesized, which exhibits strong broad orange light emission and good water stability.16 However, Sn halide hybrids suffer from the instability of Sn2+, which can be easily oxidized to Sn4+ in air and can induce performance degradation of the materials. Zn2+-based halide hybrids with stable oxidation states have attracted attention due to their unique photophysical properties. For example, Ma and co-workers developed a 0D TPP2ZnCl4 (TPP: tetraphenylphosphonium) hybrid with ultralong afterglow, and the afterglow of TPP2ZnX4 can be tuned by controlling the halide composition.17 Luo et al. synthesized a 0D organic Zn halide [(N-AEPz)ZnCl4]Cl (N-AEPz: N-aminoethylpiperazine) with a PLQY of 11.5% and bluish-white-light emission. Compound (C5H7N2)2ZnBr4 (C5H7N2+: aminopyridinium) was reported with broadband blue emission from organic molecules, high color rendering indexes (CRI), and a high PLQY of 19.18%.18 The excellent photophysical properties and simple synthesis procedure make the Zn2+-based OIMHs become a promising material.
Here, we synthesize three new lead-free OIMHs, namely, (C8H12N)2ZnBr4 (1), (C9H14N)2ZnBr4 (2), and (C9H14NO)2ZnBr4 (3) (C8H12N: phenylethylammonium, C9H14N: 4-methylphenethylammonium, and C9H14NO: 4-methoxyphenethylammonium). X-ray crystallography indicates that all the compounds consist of organic cations and inorganic tetrahedral ZnBr42− in a 0D crystal structure. The IR and Raman spectra further confirm the composition of the compounds. All the compounds exhibit white fluorescence emission with a PLQY of 12%, 11%, and 23% for 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The steady-state PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay reveal that the emissions of these compounds originate from the organic cations. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of compounds 1, 2, and 3 are (0.25, 0.30), (0.29, 0.36), and (0.28, 0.36), their correlated color temperature values are 12185, 7421, and 8184 K, and their color rendering indexes are 78, 68, and 77, respectively.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Zinc bromide (ZnBr2, 99.9%, Aladdin), phenethylamine (C8H11N, 98%, Aladdin), 2-(p-tolyl)ethylamine (C9H14N, 97%, Macklin), 4-methoxyphenethylamine (C9H14NO, 98%, Aladdin), and hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt% water solution, Aladdin) were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of crystals
(C8H12N)2ZnBr4 crystals were synthesized by the slow solvent evaporation method. Briefly, phenethylamine and ZnBr2 were respectively dissolved in methanol and then mixed for 10 min. A stoichiometric amount of HBr was added and stirred for 5 min, and then the solution was allowed to slowly evaporate at ambient temperature. (C9H14N)2ZnBr4 and (C9H14NO)2ZnBr4 were synthesized by the same method except that phenethylamine was replaced with 2-(p-tolyl)ethylamine and 4-methoxyphenethylamine.
2.3. Characterization
The structures of the crystals were detected by using a powder diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) and a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer (SuperNova) at room temperature. The structures were solved by the direct method using the SHELXS program of the SHELXTL package and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method with SHELXL. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out by using the synchronous thermal analyzer STA 449 F5 Jupiter (Netzsch, Germany). The photophysical characterization was performed by using Agilent Technologies Inc. cary5000 for UV-vis, and Techcomp FL970 for PLE and spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured using AXIS SUPRA (Shimadzu). The PLQY measurements were carried out by coupling an integrating sphere to a fluorescence spectrometer (QEPro, Oceanoptics) with optical fibers. The excitation source was provided using a 370 nm LED lamp. A standard light source (HL-3plus, Oceanoptics) was used for calibrating absolute irradiance.
3. Results and discussion
The single crystals of all compounds were prepared by the slow solvent evaporation method. Compounds 1 and 3 crystallize in the monoclinic space group P21/c, and 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pna21 (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1(a–c), Zn2+ is coordinated with four Br− to form a [ZnBr4]2− tetrahedral unit in all compounds. The [ZnBr4]2− units have no connectivity with each other, which are isolated by protonated organic ligands. The 0D structure is common in group 12 metal halide systems.19 The organic molecules push aside the [ZnBr4]2− units, determining the distance between the [ZnBr4]2− units. In the a-axis, the shortest distances between two adjacent Zn2+ cations are 13.305 Å in 1, 14.811 Å in 2, and 15.671 Å in 3, which is consistent with the law that the size of organic ligands increases. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows more details of the [ZnBr4]2− tetrahedral structure. To explore the effect of organic ligands on [ZnBr4]2− tetrahedral units, the distortion degree of the [ZnBr4]2− tetrahedral units is quantitatively evaluated using eqn (1) and (2):20 (1) (2)where d0 is the average Zn–Br bond length, di is the four individual Zn–Br bond lengths, and θi is the individual Br–Zn–Br bond angles of the tetrahedron. The λtet and δ2tet values of [ZnBr4]2− are calculated to be 8.78 × 10−6 and 3.90 in 1, 3.06 × 10−6 and 2.29 in 2, and 1.36 × 10−5 and 4.63 in 3. The calculation result demonstrates that the distortion degree of all the [ZnBr4]2− tetrahedral units is small. The shortest distances between Br atoms in two adjacent [ZnBr4]2− tetrahedral units are 4.595 Å in 1, 4.751 in 2, and 4.465 in 3, and are longer than double of the bromide Shannon ionic radius (2 × r(Br−) = 3.92 Å).18 The close packing of bromide anions probably correlates with the optoelectronic properties, which are observed in vacancy-ordered double halide perovskites.21

 Fig. 1  (a) Crystal structures of compounds 1 (a), 2 (b), and 3 (c) (blue: Zn, pink: Br, brown: C, green: N, and red: O) and the individual organic cations (C8H12N)+, (C9H14N)+, and (C9H14NO)+. (d) The experimental and simulated XRD patterns of compounds 1, 2, and 3. 
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) confirms the phase purity of the three compounds (Fig. 1d), where the PXRD patterns match well with the simulated XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra illustrate the phenyl group (Ph) stretching vibration of all the compounds at 1460–1590 cm−1. The Ph–O and C–O stretching vibration at 1249 cm−1 and 1032 cm−1 can be observed in compound 3, which originates from 4-methoxyphenylethylammonium. Fig. 2b shows the Raman spectra of 1, 2, and 3 and the corresponding organic ammonium. The Raman spectra of all the compounds are consistent with those of the organic ammonium, which further confirms the composition of the compounds (Fig. S2, ESI†). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement further verifies the valence state of Zn cations (Fig. 2c). The XPS spectra of 1 and 2 show two peaks at 1045.7 and 1022.5 eV, which correspond to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals of the cation Zn2+. However, the XPS peaks of 3 shift to high binding energy 1046.3 and 1023.1 eV, which may be due to the distortion of the [ZnBr4]2− units.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to investigate the thermal stability of the compounds, which is of great significance for their photoelectrical application.22 As shown in Fig. 2d, compounds 1, 2, and 3 exhibit good thermal stability, beginning to lose mass at about 226 °C, 217 °C, and 214 °C, respectively. This is much higher than the decomposition temperature of some well-known OIMHs such as FASnI3 (FA = formamidinium) at 100 °C, FASn0.5Pb0.5I3 at 150 °C, and CH3NH3PbBr3 at 176 °C.23,24 The TGA measurement was further performed on the organic ammoniums. C8H12NBr, C9H14NBr, and C9H14NOBr begin to lose mass at ca. 194 °C, 189 °C, and 181 °C, which is lower than that of the corresponding organic–inorganic zinc halides (Fig. S3, ESI†). This indicates that the thermal stability of organic–inorganic zinc halides is better than that of the corresponding organic ammonium. Besides, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the powder XRD patterns of the compounds kept in ambient air for six months show no significant change compared with the newly prepared samples, suggesting good air stability of all the compounds.

Fig. 3(a–c) shows the UV-Vis absorption, excitation, and emission spectra of compounds 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All crystals 1, 2, and 3 are colorless in daylight, indicating nearly no visible-light absorption, which matches well with the UV-Vis absorption spectra. Based on the Kubelka–Munk function (F(R) = α/S = (1 − R)2/(2R), where R is the reflectance, α is the absorption coefficient, and S is the scattering coefficient), bandgap energies can be estimated from the Tauc plots (F(R)hν) as a function of the photon energy (hν).24 As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the bandgap energies of 1, 2, and 3 are estimated to be 4.42, 4.27, and 4.10 eV, respectively. Under 365 nm UV light irradiation, the PL spectra of compounds 1, 2, and 3 all show broadband white emissions from 400 to 800 nm. The PL peak locations are 469, 482, and 490 nm for 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Besides, all the compounds show a similar PLE peak with the strongest excitation wavelength of 393 nm. Furthermore, the compounds have PLQYs of 12%, 11%, and 23% for 1, 2, and 3, which are similar to those of the reported white luminescence Zn2+-based organic–inorganic metal halides.18,19,25,26 As shown in Fig. 4, the corresponding CIE chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperatures are (0.25, 0.30) and 12185 K, (0.29, 0.36) and 7421 K, (0.28, 0.36) and 8184 K for 1, 2, and 3, and the color rendering indexes are 78, 68, and 77, respectively. Recently, many works reported that the broadband luminescence of organic–inorganic metal halides originates from the self-trapped excitons (STEs), which are related to the distortion of the inorganic unit.27,28 However, the distortions in these compounds are too small to induce exciton self-trapping, which could preclude the possibility that the fluorescence originates from the STEs. To determine the influence of the organic component on the emissions, the PL spectra of organic ammoniums C8H12NBr, C9H14NBr, and C9H14NOBr were detected. Under the 365 nm excitation light, C8H12NBr, C9H14NBr, and C9H14NOBr also exhibited broadband emission peaks at 465 nm, 483 nm, and 483 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†), respectively, which are the same as compounds 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, the time-resolved PL spectra of 1, 2, and 3 were measured to investigate the dynamics of excitons and the origin of the broadband emission. As shown in Fig. 3(d–f), all the compounds exhibited bi-exponential decay under excitation at 375 nm, and fitting results show similar lifetimes at a variety of emission wavelengths of 1, 2, and 3, suggesting that the emission is derived from a single ensemble (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). The similar PL spectra and the nanosecond lifetimes of the compounds and ammoniums manifest that the broadband white emissions of these compounds originate from the organic molecules.18,19

4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized three new low-dimensional Zn2+-based organic–inorganic metal halides and obtained their crystallographic structures. All of the compounds exhibit similar PL, PLE, and UV-Vis absorption spectra, which show a broadband white luminescence with the corresponding CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.25, 0.30), (0.29, 0.36), and (0.28, 0.36), correlated color temperatures of 12185, 7421, and 8184 K for 1, 2, and 3, and the color rendering indexes of 78, 68, and 77, respectively. The steady-state PL and time-resolved PL measurements confirm that the broadband emissions of all the compounds originate from the organic molecules. This work provides an effective way to design and synthesize environment-friendly OIMHs and the broadband luminescence, nontoxic, and low-cost synthesis features of these Zn-based OIMHs open up a new perspective for photoelectrical applications.
