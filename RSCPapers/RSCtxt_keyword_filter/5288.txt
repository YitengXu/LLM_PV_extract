    , Accepted 12th December 2021First published on 4th January 2022AbstractThe optimal photoactive layer thickness (Lopt) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) is typically below 200 nm, which is unlikely suitable for large scale production. Toward increasing the Lopt, a deeper understanding of Lopt is indispensable. Here, we propose a semi-empirical model for the quantitative determination of Lopt in OSCs, which considers the limited charge carrier transport length, space charge accumulation, and photoabsorption. Three widely studied BHJs of polymer:fullerene OSCs (P3HT, PffBT4T, and PCPDTBT each blended with PCBM) were used for the validation of this model. Simultaneous measurements of time-of-flight (TOF) and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) revealed the electron/hole mobility relaxation and effective carrier diffusion length. The space charge effect on Lopt was examined by considering the electron/hole mobility balance. In addition, the photoabsorption effect was incorporated by calculating the effective absorption coefficient under the standard solar irradiation. Based on this model, Lopt was calculated to be ∼100 nm for PCPDTBT/PC71BM, ∼150 nm for P3HT/PCBM, and ∼300 nm for PffBT4T/PCBM, showing good consistence with the experimental values. The effectiveness of our model was further supported by solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) calculations. Thus, our work provides a feasible method for quantifying Lopt in OSCs and an insight into the charge relaxation dynamics.
Introduction
A dramatic evolution of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) has been seen in the past two decades, where the power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached over 18%.1,2 The typical photoactive layer thickness of an OSC device is below 200 nm; such a thin layer is difficult to control in large scale production that often favours over 300 nm.3,4 In order to achieve a greater optimal photoactive layer thickness (Lopt), a comprehensive understanding of Lopt is indispensable. Lopt is commonly considered to result from the trade-off between photoabsorption and charge carrier collection. A thick layer ensures more photoabsorption that leads to increased number of photogenerated carriers, whereas it also causes more severe charge collection loss due to nongeminate bulk recombination.3–7 The photoabsorption basically follows the Beer–Lambert law:8IT/I0 = 10−αd, where I0 is the incident light intensity, IT is the transmitted light intensity, d is the film thickness, and α is the absorption coefficient. In addition to this normal photoabsorption, some studies have exemplified the Lopt arising from the interference of multiple layers (Fabry–Perot effect).6,9–11 Generally, the effect of photoabsorption is more dominant than that of carrier recombination when the film is thin (<100 nm). However, if the thickness exceeds a certain limit such as the drift length (Ldr = μτE; μ: mobility, τ: lifetime/relaxation time, E: electric field strength)4 of photogenerated carriers,11 a loss due to the nongeminate recombination becomes significant. Thus, both effects of photoabsorption and charge carrier recombination should be quantitatively analysed in the determination of Lopt.
While the photoabsorption and photoresponse of OSCs can be directly measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) photoabsorption6,12 and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectroscopies,13,14 respectively, the quantification of charge carrier recombination needs advanced analyses. A Langevin recombination coefficient: (βL = e(μe + μh)(εrε0)−1; e: the elementary charge, μe and μh: the mobility of electrons and holes, respectively, and εr and ε0: the relative and vacuum permittivity, respectively)15–17 or a second-order bimolecular recombination coefficient18–20 can give information on the recombination rate and lifetime of charge carriers. However, these coefficients are strongly dependent on the material morphology and crystallinity,20 external electric field strength,21 carrier density,22 and temperature,23 which makes it hard to quantify the layer thickness dependence using these parameters. Comparatively, parameters such as Ldr and carrier diffusion length (Ldi = (Dτ)1/2 = (kBTμτ/e)1/2, D: the diffusion coefficient, kB: the Boltzmann constant and T: the absolute temperature)15,24 are more intuitively related to Lopt; yet either of these parameters requires the determination of the μτ product.
Charge carrier mobility has a large influence on the photochemical processes including charge carrier separation,25 recombination,26 and collection.27 Furthermore, the imbalance of hole/electron mobility values may result in charge accumulation, which shields the electric field and therefore hinders the charge carrier transport and collection.4,28,29 Conventional measurements such as field-effect transistor (FET),30 space-charge-limited current (SCLC),31 and time-of-flight (TOF)32 have been widely used for determining the charge carrier mobility, in which the measured carrier mobility is a non-temporal and long distance-averaged value. The mobility measured using these methods provides an important guidance on the device characterization;33 however, this long range, mean mobility alone cannot explain its relationship with OSC properties, for example why some low electron mobility non-fullerene BHJ materials such as PM6:IT4F34 and PM6:Y6 (ref. 35 and 36) (mobility usually 1 to 3 orders lower than that of the fullerene series) have comparable fill factor (FF) with the fullerene series.
Recently, many studies37–41 have pointed out that the carrier mobility in OSCs is actually time-dependent, which leads to the temporal decay of charge carrier mobility (termed mobility relaxation). According to the model proposed by A. Melianas et al.,37 after the fast charge carrier separation (usually ≈1 ps) that may possess a very large initial mobility (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1), the carriers gradually undergo relaxation during the transport to the electrode via hopping between the tail states in the density of states. So far, techniques such as charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV),37,39–41 time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS),42 electric field-induced second harmonic (EFISH),25 and laser-flash time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC)38,43,44 have been used to study the time-dependent mobility in OSCs.
We have reported a combined TOF-TRMC technique to evaluate the hole mobility relaxation in polymer:fullerene BHJ devices (regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl): P3HT, poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′,5′,2′′,5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)]: PffBT4T, or poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]]: PCPDTBT blended with phenyl C61 (or C71) butyric acid methyl ester: PC61BM or PC71BM).44 The hole mobility relaxation was found to be the fastest in PCPDTBT:PC71BM and the slowest in PffBT4T:PCBM. The observed hole relaxation exhibited a qualitative correspondence with the order of Lopt (PCPDTBT:PC71BM < P3HT:PCBM < PffBT4T:PCBM). However, other factors such as electron mobility relaxation, the electron TOF mobility values, and photoabsorption are not considered; thus, quantitative analyses have not yet been conducted.
In this paper, we focus on the quantitative explanation of Lopt in these three polymer:fullerene BHJ OSCs (P3HT, PffBT4T, PCPDTBT blended with PC61BM or PC71BM, Fig. 1a) using the above-mentioned TOF-TRMC measurements for both hole and electron. A model incorporating mobility relaxation and photoabsorption is proposed to make Lopt analysis more understandable. Finally, a device simulation using a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) is performed to evaluate the feasibility of our Lopt analysis.

Experimental
Materials

P3HT was purchased from Aldrich. Pff4TBT (another name: Pff4TBT-2OD) and PCPDTBT were purchased from 1-Material Inc. PC61BM (or PCBM; purity >99.5%) and PC71BM (purity >99.5%) were purchased from Frontier Carbon Inc. Chlorobenzene (CB) was purchased from Kishida Kagaku, and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was purchased from Fujifilm-Wako Pure Chemical Corp. All solvents were used as received without further purification. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO; purity >98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS Clevious P VP AI 4083) was purchased from Heraeus Company.
Device fabrication
The device schematic is drawn in Fig. 1b. For a TOF-TRMC measurement, an electron-only device (EOD) and a hole-only device (HOD) were separately fabricated on a 1 mm-thick fused-quartz substrate, where the central part was patterned with an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer (sheet resistance ∼15 Ω sq−1; thickness 150 nm). An Al guide electrode (thickness 100 nm, connected to the ITO layer) was first deposited on the substrate by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask in a vacuum chamber. For an EOD device, the hole transfer layer (HTL) was prepared by dropping approximately 150 μL PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution onto the substrate and rotating at 2500 rpm for 15 s, followed by thermal annealing at 125 °C on a hot plate for 15 min. For a HOD device, an electron transfer layer (ETL) was prepared by dropping 140 μL ZnO precursor solution (0.1 g mL−1 zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.028 g mL−1 ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol) on the substrate and rotating at 4000 rpm for 15 s, followed by thermal annealing at 200 °C on a hot plate for 30 min. The ETL in HOD and HTL in EOD can effectively wipe the charge carriers out of target (e.g. electrons in HOD) and yield a good TOF signal. For BHJ layer preparation, each of the BHJs was prepared under their corresponding optimum conditions.44 The BHJ layers (0.6 wt% P3HT:PCBM = 1:1 in DCB; 0.2 wt% PffBT4T:PCBM = 1:1.5 in DCB; 0.1 wt% PCPDTBT:PC71BM = 1:3.5 in CB with 3 vol% DIO) were prepared in a vacuum oven by drop-casting approximately 130 μL of the solution followed by immediate drying in vacuum at room temperature for 5–7 h. The resultant thickness was 1–3 μm (ESI Table S1†). After that, a gold (Au) electrode (80 nm in thickness) was deposited on the BHJ layer using a shadow mask (P3HT:PCBM was subjected to thermal annealing at 150 °C in a N2-filled glovebox (O2 < 0.0 ppm, H2O < 0.0 ppm) for 10 min, while the others were directly subjected to the gold deposition). HTL and ETL beneath the Au electrode in HOD and EOD, respectively, are unnecessary for the TOF experiments. The thickness was measured using a Bruker Dektak XT surface profiler.
TOF-TRMC measurement
As shown in ESI Fig. S1,† the fabricated device was set in a harmonic resonant cavity and probed by continuous microwaves (∼9.1 GHz, ∼10 mW) generated using a microwave signal generator (Rohde & Schwarz model SMB100A). Note that such a low microwave power has a negligible effect on the charge carrier motion. A Nd:YAG laser (Spectra Physics Inc. GCR-100, 5–8 ns pulse duration, 10 Hz) with the second-harmonic generation (SHG; 532 nm) was used as the excitation source (incident photon density, I0 = 4.3 × 1016 photons per cm2 per pulse). The laser was irradiated from the bottom of the devices (the ITO side), ensuring that most of the photogeneration process takes place near the bottom layer. A source meter (Keithley model 2612A; voltage range 0–20 V) was used to apply an external bias upon the device. For the measurement of EODs, the ITO-Al electrode was applied to a negative bias, and thus electron motion towards the Au electrode was promoted, while hole motion toward the Au electrode was largely prevented. Similarly, for the measurement of HODs, the ITO-Al electrode was applied to a positive bias. The transient photocurrent from the top Au electrode and TRMC signal from a microwave detector were simultaneously recorded using an oscilloscope (Tektronix model DPO4000, 50 Ω termination). The active area of contact defined by the gold electrode was 42–45 mm2, while the size of laser pulse was 5 mm in diameter. All measurements were performed at 27 °C in air.
Absorption spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy
The absorption spectrum was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-730). The BHJ solutions were prepared in the same way with the device fabrication. After 30 min ozone cleaning of the fused quartz substrate, 60–80 μL hot BHJ solution was (∼70 °C) was dropped onto the substrate following spin coating at 800 rpm for 40 s in a glovebox. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed using a Bruker Innova and Rigaku MiniFlex600 (Cu Kα), respectively.
SCAPS device simulation
A SCAPS version 3.3.10 software was used for all solar cell simulations.45
Results and discussion
Mobility relaxation analysis using TOF-TRMC measurement
The concept of TOF-TRMC measurement is briefly explained in ESI Note S1,† where the key to this measurement is to evaluate the transient, local carrier mobility μ from the change in the reflected microwave power: ΔP. ΔP is proportional to the transient photoconductivity (Δσ). In our analysis, the time-dependent, normalized μ was evaluated through μ = KΔP (ΔI nre)−1, where K is a constant, ΔI is the transient photocurrent (TPC) observed in a TOF measurement, and nre is the carrier density analysed using a bulk charge recombination simulation (vide infra). ΔP is divided by ΔI (both are time-dependent) to compensate the charge loss during the long-range charge transport, which is assumed to be a pseudo first-order decay caused by high density deep traps and/or recombination with dark counter charges. However, this calibration is not important, because ΔI is almost flat until the TOF time (ESI Fig. S2 and S3†). Calibration by nre is more important than ΔI, where nre is not detected by TPC. For analysing the mobility of only one kind of carriers (electron or hole), EOD and HOD were separately prepared to ensure that only one kind of charge carriers contributes to the TPC and TRMC signals. In all TOF-TRMC measurements, a 532 nm pulse was used to generate charge carriers.

Fig. 2a–c and d–f show the TPC transients of EOD and HOD, respectively, under the various external E. Each TPC curve shows a clear kink point (the intersection of interpolated linear lines in the logarithmic plots) that refers to the TOF time (τTOF; calculation details are shown in ESI Fig. S2 and S3†). Then TOF mobility (μTOF) was calculated using the following eqn (1): (1)where d is the BHJ film thickness. Note that this μTOF(E) is the long-range mean mobility. The mobility at zero electric field (μ0) was calculated through the extrapolation of log(μTOF) vs. E1/2 plot into E = 0 (Fig. 3), and the result is summarized in Table 1. PffBT4T:PCBM shows the highest electron mobility μ0e = 1.9 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the highest hole mobility μ0h = 1.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a balanced electron/hole mobility ratio μ0e/μ0h of 1.4, which is beneficial for the carrier transport and minimizing the space charge effect. P3HT:PCBM shows a medium μ0e of 1.0 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μ0h of 1.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, while μ0e/μ0h = 5.6 is less balanced than PffBT4T:PCBM, indicating that space charge accumulation is more likely to occur after free charge carrier generation. PCPDTBT:PC71BM shows the lowest μ0e = 2.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the lowest μ0h = 6.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the imbalanced μ0e/μ0h = 4.1. The sequence of μ0 (hole and electron) qualitatively matches that of reported Lopt values (270–300 nm for PffBT4T:PCBM,46–48 150–190 nm for P3HT:PCBM,49–53 75–100 nm for PCPDTBT:PC71BM),54–57 indicating the qualitative relationship between carrier mobility and Lopt. In all three BHJs, μTOF shows a negative dependence on E, which may result from charge carriers being driven into a more disordered transport route under the increased E.58

The normalized TRMC transients simultaneously recorded with TPC are shown in Fig. 4. P3HT:PCBM exhibits a slower decay in both EOD (Fig. 4a) and HOD (Fig. 4d) than PffBT4T:PCBM (Fig. 4b and e) and PCPDTBT:PC71BM (Fig. 4c and f), indicating either a lower charge carrier recombination rate or a slower mobility relaxation. Interestingly, PffBT4T:PCBM shows a faster TRMC decay of electrons than its holes and those of the other two BHJs. Compared with TPC transients, the decay of TRMC signal is always faster, suggesting that the carrier mobility undergoes recombination and/or relaxation. In all EOD and HOD cases, the normalized TRMC decay shows a small dependence on E.

To quantitatively analyse the carrier density nre during bulk recombination, we adopted the following parallel differential equations (eqn (2) for hole and eqn (3) for electron) based on one-dimensional diffusion under the external electric field while considering the bimolecular bulk recombination:44 (2) (3)where nreh (nree) is the density of holes (electrons), γ is the bimolecular recombination rate, and Dh (De) is the hole (electron) diffusion constant, which is calculated from μ0h (or μ0e) using Einstein equation.59 Note that eqn (2) and (3) are for a HOD (the direction of positive x corresponds to the film thickness from the bottom ITO side to the top Au side), while the polarities of the third E-related terms in the right side are flipped for an EOD. γ was taken from the literature (1.5 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 for P3HT:PCBM;60 1.0 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 for PffBT4T:PCBM;61 1.0 × 10−10 cm3 s−1 for PCPDTBT:PC71BM).62 The calculation of carrier density involves an integration of local carrier density sequentially by distance or time, and the initial condition (t = 0) of carrier density is based on Beer–Lambert law in eqn (4): nreh(x,t = 0) = nree(x,t = 0) = ln10 × ϕEOPεI010−εx(4)where ε is the decadic absorption coefficient at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm (4.9 × 104 cm−1 for P3HT:PCBM, 2.4 × 104 cm−1 for PffBT4T:PCBM, and 2.4 × 104 cm−1 for PCPDTBT:PC71BM).44I0 is the incident photon intensity (fixed at 4.3 × 1016 photons per cm2 per pulse). φEOP is the quantum yield of charge carrier generation at the end of pulsed laser irradiation, which is considered constant regardless of the electric field and solely a fitting parameter (detailed explanation in ESI Note S2†). The simulated spatiotemporal nreh and nree of three BHJs as a function of time under various electric fields are shown in ESI Fig. S4 and S5.†

Fig. 5a and b show the normalized mobility relaxations of electron and hole of the three BHJs, respectively (all data are provided in ESI Fig. S6 and S7†). Here the relaxation is plotted as a function of normalized time (time/τTOF) so as to compensate the difference in film thickness. As for electrons, P3HT:PCBM shows the slowest electron mobility relaxation. PffBT4T:PCBM and PCPDTBT:PC71BM show a similar fast relaxation, but the former decreases to almost zero at time/τTOF = 1, while the latter retains about 20% of its initial mobility. As for holes, PffBT4T:PCBM shows a slow mobility relaxation, followed by P3HT:PCBM and PCPDTBT:PC71BM. The results of these hole mobility relaxations are consistent with the previous report,44 confirming good reproducibility of the TOF-TRMC measurements. For PffBT4T:PCBM, though it has both the highest and most balanced electron/hole TOF mobility, the contrasting mobility relaxation characteristics (the fast electron mobility relaxation and slow hole mobility relaxation) may cause an imbalance during the charge transport, leading to space charge accumulation. P3HT:PCBM shows relatively similar hole and electron mobility relaxation characteristics, despite the imbalance of TOF mobility (μ0e/μ0h = 5.6), which may also cause space charge accumulation.

The external electric field E for all of the selected profiles in (a and b) is approximately 2 × 104 V cm−1. Calculated diffusion length Ldi as a function of external electric field strength in (c) EOD and (d) HOD. 
To quantify the relaxation of normalized mobility, we fitted the decay using a stretched exponential function: (5)where τnorm is the lifetime (no unit), and β (typically ∼0.5) is the power factor. The product τnorm × τTOF is subsequently the effective lifetime (τeff; the unit of time) of mobility relaxation. The double-exponential function (see ESI Note S3†) was also examined to fit the mobility relaxation curve, but found unsuitable, because the obtained average lifetime reflects mostly the delayed time stage (ESI Fig. S8†). In addition, the early stage (time/τTOF < 0.1) of mobility relaxation has a higher accuracy, while the noise level is increased on the delayed time stage due to the noise amplification by the (ΔI nre)−1 term in the analysis.
Through the quantification of mobility relaxation time, we subsequently calculated the effective charge carrier diffusion length Ldi using the following eqn (6): (6)
We chose the carrier diffusion length Ldi rather than the carrier drift length Ldr, because the carrier transport in these BHJ solar cells is more similar to a diffusion-driven process observed typically in highly disordered systems. For electrons, P3HT:PCBM shows the longest Ldi of 80–100 nm, followed by PffBT4T:PCBM (30–60 nm) and PCPDTBT:PC71BM (20–30 nm), as shown in Fig. 5c. For holes, PffBT4T:PCBM shows the longest Ldi of 60–80 nm, followed by P3HT:PCBM (30–60 nm) and PCPDTBT:PC71BM (10–20 nm), as shown in Fig. 5d. The Ldi at the low E (<104 V cm−1) is neglected, owing to the possible overestimation of the TOF mobility.58 The negative dependence of Ldi on the external electric field is the direct consequence of the negative electric field dependence of TOF mobility. Accordingly, the calculated Ldi is used to discuss its relationship with Lopt in the following sections.
Absorption characteristic analysis
To quantify the effect of light absorption, we calculated the integration of the product of air mass (AM) 1.5G spectrum (Fig. 6a, considering glass/ITO transmittance) and photoabsorption spectra of the BHJ films (Fig. 6b). Here we define αAM1.5G as the effective absorption coefficient of the photoactive layer under AM1.5G, as given by (7)where d is the thickness of the BHJ active layer for UV-vis measurement, Aabs(λ) is the measured absorbance at the BHJ film thickness of d, TITO(λ) is the measured transmittance of a glass/ITO substrate, and P(λ) is the spectrum irradiance of AM 1.5G. λ1 (= 300 nm) and λ2 (= 1000 nm) are the cut-off wavelengths, which can cover the whole spectra of the present BHJ film absorption (the results are consistent when the cut-off of polymer photoabsorption is used for λ2). Note that the value of Aabs(λ) (Fig. 6b) was deliberately doubled in the calculation of eqn (7) by considering the reflection of light at the bottom electrode in an OPV device. PCPDTBT:PC71BM shows the highest αAM1.5G of 3.19 × 104 cm−1, which is about 2-fold and 1.5 fold compared to P3HT:PCBM (1.52 × 104 cm−1) and PffBT4T:PCBM (2.04 × 104 cm−1), respectively, in line with their bandgap energies.

The film thickness is 118 ± 7 nm for P3HT:PCBM, 154 ± 20 for PffBT4T:PCBM and 107 ± 14 nm for PCPDTBT:PC71BM (averaged by 20 points). 
Quantitative determination of Lopt
Based on the above discussion, we propose a semi-empirical equation that quantitatively determines Lopt for BHJ solar cells. First, we define the effective layer thickness deff as follows: (8)Here Le (Lh) is the electron (hole) diffusion length calculated using eqn (6), μ0e (μ0h) is the electron (hole) TOF mobility at E = 0, and k is a scaling factor most possibly ranging from 0 to 3 (see ESI Note S4†). Here we set k as 1, because the variation of k is compensated in the determination of Lopt by adjusting another parameter (k′, vide infra); thus, within this possible k range, the arbitrary set of k has a negligible impact on the Lopt determination (ESI Fig. S9†). The numerator term of LeLh(Le + Lh)−1 is a calibration of the relationship between electron and hole diffusion lengths, which is based on the fact that the overall diffusion length is mostly determined by the carrier with the shorter diffusion length.27,64 The denominator term of ln(μ0e/μ0h + μ0h/μ0e) is a calibration of the space charge effect caused by the imbalanced electron/hole mobilities. This term is minimized at μ0e = μ0h, while deff is maximized under this condition. Here the logarithm is used to avoid the overestimation of the mobility imbalance effect when the mobility imbalance is too large, since in many non-fullerene OSCs (such as Y6 series),65–67 the electron and hole mobilities sometimes differ by over 2 orders, while the Lopt is still maintained at around 100 nm. Although space charge accumulation caused by other factors such as trapping at the polymer ends of residual bromine68 and tail states is not separately evaluated, we consider that such information is implicitly included in mobility relaxation.
Finally, we discuss the determination of Lopt. The deff only considers the effect of charge carrier recombination, while the difference in the photoabsorption has not been considered. Based on the deff, we subsequently calibrated the photoabsorption using αAM1.5G, and the result can be directly related to the Lopt. Here we propose a new term on the charge carrier free-transport region (dfree), the concept of which is schematized in Fig. 7a. In practical OSCs, the photogenerated electrons/holes move to the ETL/HTL layers under a forward electric field, during which charge carrier recombination takes place via the limited diffusion length and space charge accumulation (similar to what occurs in the grey region of the BHJ layer in Fig. 7a). In our model, instead, we suppose a free-transport region (pink region in Fig. 7a, the width is dfree) or photogenerated carriers, where a certain number of photogenerated carriers can be transported without any hindrance from the above factors. In this dfree region, the charge carrier distribution is assumed to be homogeneous (detailed explanation is provided in ESI Note S5†). We consider dfree is equal to Lopt of the BHJ solar cells, because the film thickness should at least occupy the whole dfree space to obtain the maximum carrier collection efficiency, while any excess of the thickness leads to a large carrier collection loss due to charge recombination. From the discussion above, Lopt is determined by Lopt = k′ × (1 − 10(−deff × αAM1.5G)),(9)where k′ (in m unit) is a material-independent scaling factor obtained through fitting of Loptvs. E plots among the three BHJs. Although k′ is a fitting parameter, its effect on Lopt determination is insignificant and complementary to the given k (ESI Fig. S9†).
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic of the concept of our Lopt calculation model. Within the BHJ layer (sandwiched between the HTL and ETL), the pink region (with a width of dfree) shows the ideal free-transport region for charge carriers. As all factors contributing to recombination are calibrated, there is no recombination loss of charge carriers passing through this dfree region (indicated by the solid black arrow). However, if charge carriers reach outside the free-transport region, severe recombination due to space charge accumulation and limited diffusion length can result in large collection loss (indicated by the dashed black arrow). (b) The calculated Lopt as a function of external electric field strength. The coloured region shows the reported Lopt range in experiments.46–57 

Fig. 7b shows the calculated Lopt as a function of external electric field (k′ = 2.6 μm). Note that this k′ value is the upper limit of Lopt applicable to the model, because the maximum of Lopt in eqn (9) is k′ when deff × αAM1.5G is infinite. Overall, Lopt shows a negative dependence on E, which arises from the negative electric field dependence of TOF mobility. The reported experimental Lopt of the three BHJs are drawn with coloured ribbons, and good consistence with the calculated Lopt is achieved, especially in the middle electric field range (∼3 × 104 V cm−1). This middle range is closer to the electric field in real OSCs (approximately (2–10) × 104 V cm−1). Accordingly, the calculated/reported46–57Lopt is 140–170/150–190 nm for P3HT:PCBM, 260–310/270–300 nm for PffBT4T:PCBM, and 65–110/75–100 nm for PCPDTBT:PC71BM, which strongly indicates the feasibility of our Lopt calculation method.
To examine the applicability of Lopt determination to the different processes for the identical material, we prepared P3HT:PCBM BHJs from either CB or DCB solution (ESI Note S6†) according to the same process as that described in ref. 69 The TOF-TRMC experiments (ESI Fig. S10 and S11†) and their analyses (ESI Fig. S12 and Table S2†) reveal the Lopt values of 180–300 nm for P3HT:PCBM (DCB) and 60–110 nm for P3HT:PCBM (CB), which are consistent with those of literature reports (180–320 nm and 65–100 nm, respectively).69 The spin-coated and drop-cast films (DCB) show similar morphology (AFM and XRD in ESI Fig. S13†); thus, solvent rather than the film thickness and casting methods has a marked effect on Lopt. The results confirmed that our Lopt model can account for the material difference and BHJ morphology.
SCAPS solar cell simulation
To evidence the feasibility of our Lopt calculation model, a solar cell simulation using SCAPS has been performed, the parameters of which are listed in Table 2. To make this simulation better reflect the performance of real OSCs, we used experimental data such as bandgap, carrier mobility, absorption spectra, recombination coefficient, and Urbach energy of defect states, either from the literature or our own measurement. Some parameters were adjusted to fit the current density (J)–voltage (V) curve by considering the reported range of the parameters.70–72 Sensitivity tests of totally 17 parameters were carried out to help understand the impact of each SCAPS parameter (ESI Fig. S14†).

The simulated J–V characteristics of OSCs with various photoactive layer thicknesses are shown in Fig. 8a–c. The simulated J–V curves are in good agreement with the experimental data of P3HT:PCBM,49–53,73PffBT4T:PCBM,46–48,73 and PCPDTBT:PC71BM,54,55 showing that the calculation results are reasonable. Fig. 8d exhibits the simulated PCE values of each OSC as a function of photoactive layer thickness. The Lopt obtained by the simulation (the dot position in Fig. 8d) is 145–155 nm for P3HT:PCBM, 260–290 nm for PffBT4T:PCBM and 90–105 nm for PCPDTBT:PC71BM, which is consistent with the Lopt values calculated using our model. Thus, the feasibility of our Lopt calculation model is supported by the SCAPS simulation results.

Conclusions
We proposed a semi-empirical, quantitative model to determine the optimum photoactive layer thickness (Lopt) for OSCs. The three widely studied polymer:fullerene BHJ OSCs (P3HT:PCBM, PffBT4T:PCBM, and PCPDTBT:PC71BM) were subjected to TOF-TRMC measurements. TOF mobilities and mobility relaxation were separately evaluated for hole and electron. Subsequently, the effective charge carrier diffusion length (deff) was calculated based on the TOF-TRMC results using the carrier diffusion length (Ldi) and space charge accumulation (a balance of mobilities). In addition, the effective absorption coefficient (αAM1.5G) describing the thickness-normalized photoabsorption of BHJ under AM1.5G was introduced, which led to the semi-empirical formula of Lopt (eqn (9)). Using this model, the calculated/experimental Lopt were found to be 140–170/150–190 nm for P3HT:PCBM, 260–310/270–300 nm for PffBT4T:PCBM, and 65–110/75–100 nm for PCPDTBT:PC71BM, showing good consistence. The reliability of our calculation model was further supported by the SCAPS solar cell simulations using the corresponding experimental and assumed parameters. Thus, we demonstrated a feasible model to determine the Lopt of different OSC systems, providing a deeper understanding of how charge carrier recombination, mobility relaxation, and light absorption relate to Lopt and PCE of OSCs.

 	Fig. 7  (a) Schematic of the concept of our Lopt calculation model. Within the BHJ layer (sandwiched between the HTL and ETL), the pink region (with a width of dfree) shows the ideal free-transport region for charge carriers. As all factors contributing to recombination are calibrated, there is no recombination loss of charge carriers passing through this dfree region (indicated by the solid black arrow). However, if charge carriers reach outside the free-transport region, severe recombination due to space charge accumulation and limited diffusion length can result in large collection loss (indicated by the dashed black arrow). (b) The calculated Lopt as a function of external electric field strength. The coloured region shows the reported Lopt range in experiments.46–57
