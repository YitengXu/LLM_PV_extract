    , Accepted 20th October 2020First published on 21st October 2020AbstractDeveloping cost-effective photocathodes that show desirable performance for use in commercial photoelectrochemical water splitting devices remains a fundamental and practical challenge. Sb2Se3 semiconductors satisfy most of the demands expected for an ideal highly efficient photocathode, including favorable cost and optoelectronic properties. Herein, we have demonstrated outstanding photoelectrodes using a noble-metal-free catalyst, namely, a MoSx-decorated low-cost Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction, as the photocathode. This enabled a maximum photocurrent density of up to −27 mA cm−2 (0 V vs. RHE, 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G filter) with a remarkable half solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) of 2.6%, obtained via decreasing charge recombination and accelerating charge transfer through morphological optimization of the In2S3 layer.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen production by solar-driven water splitting in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices is one of the most attractive strategies to convert abundant and clean solar radiation into storable, nonpolluting chemical fuels.1,2 For a solar-driven PEC-based water-splitting system to be employed in large scale in the future, the device must be advantageous in terms of cost and efficiency in order to make it economical.3–5 In an efficient solar-to-H2 PEC system, excited electron–hole pairs will be generated by a semiconductor under illumination, separate and migrate to the semiconductor's surface.6 However, since most of the semiconductor's surface has slow reaction kinetics towards hydrogen generation, catalysts are required to accelerate the transfer of multiple protons and electrons.7,8 Although crystalline silicon is the benchmark p-type semiconductor for PEC hydrogen generation systems at present, energetically demanding and high-cost processes are required to make silicon-based PEC highly efficient.9 Thus, highly efficient, easily fabricated materials have attracted a great deal of attention. So far, photocathodes based on noble metal catalysts decorated on p-type semiconductors such as InP, CdTe, CuInS2, Cu2O, etc., have been reported.10–13 The disadvantages of the high cost of these catalysts and their fabrication processes and the high toxicity of the materials will, however, limit the large-scale utilization of such photocathodes in the future.
The chalcogenide antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is an ideal p-type semiconductor material with attractive characteristics such as a desirable band gap (1.1 to 1.3 eV), high hole mobility (10 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the c-axis direction), appropriate absorption coefficient (105 cm−1 at approximately 600 nm) and low toxicity, which is promising for the construction of high-efficiency PEC photocathodes for light-driven hydrogen generation.14–17 Additionally, molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) based catalysts exhibit good performance toward hydrogen evolution with relatively low overvoltage requirements, and are considered to be a suitable alternative to replace noble metal catalysts.18 Therefore, it is worthwhile to construct photocathodes based on the semiconductor Sb2Se3 and the catalyst MoSx. A photocathode based on Sb2Se3 and MoSx as the cocatalyst has been prepared, and an appreciable photocurrent density of −16 mA cm−2 at 0 vs. RHE was obtained.19 To achieve higher PEC performance, n-type semiconducting materials are commonly coated on the top of p-type semiconductors as a buffer layer to facilitate charge separation and suppress charge recombination by forming a p–n junction. Thin layers of n-type CdS are frequently deposited on the surface of Sb2Se3 for interface engineering.20–22 However, CdS is highly toxic, and the mechanistic links between the role of the structure of the buffer layers and photocurrent of the photocathodes are not fully understood yet. In2S3 is a widegap n-type semiconductor with high photoconductivity and low toxicity, which makes it a promising material for optoelectronic buffer layer applications in solar cells and PEC cells.23,24
Herein, we investigated dendritic Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction nanorod array thin films with low-cost MoSx as the catalyst for PEC water splitting. As shown in Scheme 1, the Sb2Se3 nanorod array thin films were prepared using a facile close-space sublimation (CSS) method on a selenized Mo-coated glass substrate. The Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays were then modified with n-type In2S3 as the buffer layer to form a dendritic core–shell p–n heterojunction. After the surface of Sb2Se3/In2S3 was decorated with TiO2 and MoSx as the protective layer and hydrogen evolution catalyst layer, respectively (Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx), a positive shift in the onset potential and a drastic enhancement in the photocurrent were observed compared to the photocathode without an In2S3 buffer layer (Sb2Se3/MoSx). A photocurrent intensity of approximately −27 mA cm−2 was obtained for the optimized photocathode in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte under simulated sunlight illumination; thus, this is one of the most highly efficient p-type Sb2Se3-based photocathodes that has been reported to date. Furthermore, the function of the In2S3 dendrites on the surface of Sb2Se3 was studied. The results revealed that the morphology of the In2S3 buffer layer is crucial to the improved photoelectrical properties and the enhanced performance of the Sb2Se3-based photocathodes, and that the dendritic core–shell structured p–n heterojunction of Sb2Se3/In2S3 can also significantly decrease the electron accumulation and accelerate charge transfer.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Fabrication of dendritic Sb2Se3/In2S3-based photocathodes
As shown in Fig. S1,† the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the Sb2Se3 film fabricated by facile close-space sublimation (CSS) exhibit a vertical nanorod morphology on the substrate with an average length of 1 μm and smooth surfaces. Additionally, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows strong (101), (221), (002) and (211) diffraction peaks that can be indexed to orthorhombic-phase Sb2Se3 (JCPDS 15-0861) (Fig. S2a†). This indicates that the obtained Sb2Se3 exhibited a preferred orientation along the c-direction [001].25 The Raman spectrum (Fig. S2b†) of the Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays exhibits two main peaks at approximately 189 and 210 cm−1, which can be attributed to the characteristic peaks of Sb–Se vibrations,21,26 further demonstrating the existence of the desired phase of Sb2Se3. In addition to the main peaks, broad peaks at 80 to 150 cm−1 can be observed, which are consistent with the orthorhombic phase of Sb2Se3.27 Two additional Raman bands centered at 101 and 254 cm−1 are attributed to Se6 and Sb2O3 or Se, respectively, which are very common in the preparation process of the Sb2Se3 film, as reported in the literature.28 Highly [001]-oriented Sb2Se3 films are considered to have higher mobility due to the strong covalent bond interactions along the (Sb4Se6)n ribbon direction compared to the other crystallographic directions, which could provide a strong foundation for the construction of highly efficient Sb2Se3-based photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting.28
In order to promote charge separation and suppress charge recombination, an n-type In2S3 semiconductor layer was grown on the top of the Sb2Se3 nanorod surface via a hydrothermal method to construct a p–n junction. Fig. 1 and S3† show the top and cross-sectional view SEM images of the prepared Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunctions, respectively, with different hydrothermal reaction times. The surface morphology of the films obviously changed after In2S3 was decorated on the surface of Sb2Se3. A nanosheet-like In2S3 film was obtained on the surface of the Sb2Se3 nanorods when the growth time of In2S3 was 1.5 h (Fig. 1a and S3a†). Denser and larger sheets of In2S3 were well distributed on the Sb2Se3 nanorods to form a dendritic core–shell morphology when the hydrothermal reaction time was 2 h (Fig. 1b and S3b†). When the hydrothermal reaction time was extended to 3 h and 4 h, thicker In2S3 nanosheet layers fully covered the entire Sb2Se3 substrate, resulting in large nanosheet morphologies (Fig. 1c, d, S3c and d†). Based on the suitable thickness and specific surface area of its buffer layer, the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2 sample with a dendritic core–shell morphology was expected to have the best performance for PEC hydrogen generation among the samples, which will be verified below.

The XRD patterns of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 films (Fig. S4a†) show characteristic XRD peaks at 27.1, 33.0 and 47.5 degrees corresponding to the (311), (400) and (440) diffractions of In2S3, respectively, indicating the crystalline properties of β-In2S3.29 The Raman peaks centered at 183, 251, 307 and 367 cm−1 further reveal that the In2S3 component was successfully deposited on the surface of Sb2Se3.29 Furthermore, the specific surface morphology of the representative Sb2Se3/In2S3-2 nanorods with dendritic morphology was studied using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. S5†). The HRTEM images clearly show that thin In2S3 nanosheet layers cover the surface of Sb2Se3 (Fig. S5a and b†). HAADF-STEM and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images of a Sb2Se3/In2S3-2 core–shell nanorod (Fig. S5c†) reveal that the elements Sb and Se are distributed in the trunk of the nanorod. The elements In and S are mainly distributed on the dendrites, which confirms that the Sb2Se3/In2S3 core–shell structured p–n heterojunction was successfully constructed.
After the above steps, a thin layer (10 nm) of TiO2 was coated on top of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 using atomic layer deposition as a surface protection layer against photocorrosion.30,31 The MoSx hydrogen evolution catalyst was then deposited on the surface of the prepared photocathode using the photoelectrodeposition method described in the experimental section. For comparison, MoSx was also deposited on the surface of TiO2-protected Sb2Se3 nanorods without In2S3 (Sb2Se3/MoSx), as shown in Fig. S6a and b.† The small MoSx nanoparticles uniformly covered the surface of the TiO2-protected Sb2Se3, and did not influence the surface morphology of the Sb2Se3 nanorods. For the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx samples, the sheet-like core–shell morphology changed slightly after MoSx deposition (Fig. S7a and b†). The as-prepared Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/MoSx electrodes exhibited XRD patterns consistent with the Sb2Se3/In2S3 and Sb2Se3 films (Fig. S8†), indicating the amorphousness or low crystallinity of the MoSx, which is consistent with reports in the literature that MoSx prepared by electro- or photoelectrodeposition is usually amorphous.32,33 The HRTEM and HAADF-STEM elemental mapping images of Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx and Sb2Se3/MoSx (Fig. 2 and S9†) reveal that the elements Mo and S are uniformly distributed on the surface of Sb2Se3/In2S3-2 or Sb2Se3, indicating that MoSx was successfully deposited on the surface of the electrodes. We noticed that the distribution of Se was slightly narrower than that of Sb, which might be caused by S substitution during the hydrothermal growth of the In2S3 layer.

The surface composition and chemical bonding states of the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx electrodes were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S10,† their surfaces mainly contain O, Mo and S, indicating the coverage of MoSx on the surface of the electrodes. The high-resolution XPS Mo 3d spectra of the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx electrodes could be fitted to three species with different chemical environments (Fig. S11a and c†). The binding energy of 229.12 eV for Mo 3d5/2 is assigned to MoIVSx.34,35 The higher binding energies of 230.42 eV and 232.67 eV are attributed to the Mo 3d5/2 for molybdenum-oxysulfide-type MoVOSx and MoO3 impurities due to surface oxidization.35 The S 2s peak at 226.02 eV is indicative of S2−, which is consistent with the formation of a MoIV phase such as MoSx.34 The S 2p spectra (Fig. S11b and d†) are assigned to the terminal S2− anions with binding energies of 163.42 eV (S 2p1/2) and 161.92 eV (S 2p3/2).36 Another electron-rich sulfur phase can be attributed to the apical S2− ligands and/or bridging S22− (164.57 eV for S 2p1/2, 163.02 eV for S 2p3/2).37,38 The cycle test curves and stability performance for MoSx/FTO are shown in Fig. S12.† The above characterizations suggest that the catalyst MoSx can be successfully introduced onto the surface of the Sb2Se3-based photoelectrodes.
2.2 PEC performance of Sb2Se3/In2S3-based photocathodes
The photoelectrochemical response of the bare Sb2Se3 and In2S3-modified Sb2Se3 electrodes without the catalyst MoSx under chopped illumination were recorded using linear scan voltammograms (LSV) in an Ar-purged H2SO4 electrolyte (0.1 M) (Fig. S13a†). The current–potential (J–V) response of the bare Sb2Se3 electrode exhibits an obvious rise at a potential of 0 V vs. RHE. After modification with In2S3, a higher photocurrent was obtained for the Sb2Se3/In2S3 photocathodes with positive shifts of the starting potentials of the current–potential response to as high as 0.3 V vs. RHE. The performance enhancement could be associated with the improvement of the efficient charge separation across the heterojunctions and the unique interfacial structures of the dendritic core–shell morphology of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 photocathodes.39 In addition to the performance enhancements, large current spikes upon illumination and light interruption over the entire applied potential range were observed for the Sb2Se3/In2S3 photocathodes. This phenomenon suggests that the charge carriers have a high recombination rate at the surface of the photocathodes due to serious trapping of the photogenerated electrons.40 This in turn indicates that the electron transfer between water and the surface states of Sb2Se3/In2S3 is kinetically sluggish, suggesting that an appropriate catalyst is necessary to promote the interfacial charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Practically, after the high-activity hydrogen evolution catalyst MoSx was deposited on the semiconductors, significant enhancements in the current–potential response were observed for all photocathodes (Fig. S13b†). Additionally, the current spikes of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 photocathodes under illumination and light interruption are effectively suppressed after the introduction of the MoSx catalyst on the top of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 photocathodes, indicating the important role of the MoSx hydrogen evolution catalyst at the interfacial charge transfer kinetics.
To compare the activity of the Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/MoSx photocathodes, PEC measurements were performed in the form of LSV under continuous illumination (Fig. 3a). A photocurrent density of −7.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE for the Sb2Se3/MoSx electrode with an onset potential of 0.20 V vs. RHE was obtained. When the n-type In2S3 buffer layers were introduced between the Sb2Se3 nanorods and MoSx layer, appreciable enhancement of the photocurrent was achieved. Among the Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes, Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx shows the best PEC performance with a high photocurrent density of approximately −27.0 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE. Additionally, Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx exhibited a rapidly increasing photocurrent with a much more positive photocurrent onset potential of 0.40 V vs. RHE. This is considered to be highly suitable for energy storage and implementation in future-generation tandem PEC cells containing both a photoanode and photocathode operating without extra bias.41 In comparison, the LSV curves of Sb2Se3/In2S3-1.5/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3-3/MoSx had shapes similar to that for the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode, but with lower photocurrents. When the hydrothermal growth time of In2S3 was extended to 4 h for the Sb2Se3/In2S3-4/MoSx electrode, rather poor activity was found. The different activities of Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx may be caused by the different interfacial charge transfer rates between In2S3 and MoSx with different In2S3 dendrite structures, or the different internal charge transfer rates in the In2S3 dendrites with different thicknesses.
 Fig. 3  (a) LSV curves of the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes under continuous illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. (b) Applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPE) of the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. (c) I–t curves of the Sb2Se3/MoSx photocathode at 0 V vs. RHE and the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode at 0.19 V vs. RHE and 0 V vs. RHE under chopped illumination. (d) Incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) of the Sb2Se3/MoSx photocathode at 0 V vs. RHE and the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode at 0.19 V vs. RHE and 0 V vs. RHE. 
The maximum applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPEs, corresponding to the half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies) for the obtained Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/MoSx photocathodes were calculated (Fig. 3b) using the LSV results (Fig. 3a). A high maximum ABPE of 2.6% at 0.19 V vs. RHE for Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx was achieved, which was a 7.4-fold enhancement over that of the Sb2Se3/MoSx electrode (0.35% at 0.09 V vs. RHE). At fixed applied potentials with chopped illumination (Fig. 3c) for Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx, photocurrents of approximately −27 mA cm−2 and −13 mA cm−2 were obtained at applied potentials of 0 V and 0.19 V vs. RHE, respectively, which is consistent with the LSV data in Fig. 3a. Additionally, Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx exhibits a faster photocurrent response with much smaller transient spikes than the Sb2Se3/MoSx electrode for each on–off cycle, suggesting that the surface charge recombination of Sb2Se3/In2S3-2 was efficiently alleviated by the In2S3 buffer layer.42,43 At 0.19 V vs. RHE, the potential at which the maximum ABPE was obtained, a relatively stable current density of about −13 mA cm−2 with a faradaic efficiency of 93% was maintained for Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx during 90 min of continuous irradiation without apparent photocurrent decay, suggesting the good long-term stability of the prepared photocathode (Fig. S14†). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathodes was measured (Fig. 3d). For the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode, the maximum IPCE values were approximately 55% at a potential of 0.19 V vs. RHE and 85% at a potential of 0 V vs. RHE under 830 nm illumination. For the Sb2Se3/MoSx photocathode, the IPCE values were lower than 23% at 0 V vs. RHE over the entire measured wavelength range. Using the above measurements, photocurrent densities of −12.9 mA cm−2 at 0.19 V vs. RHE and −26.8 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE for the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode and −7.54 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE for Sb2Se3/MoSx photocathode were calculated by integrating the IPCE data over the light spectrum of the solar simulator (Fig. S15a†), which agreed well with the experimentally measured values (Fig. 3a and c) and further confirmed the accuracy of the LSV data. Integral saturation photocurrents of −26.9 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE and −13.0 mA cm−2 at 0.19 V vs. RHE were obtained using the AM 1.5G (ASTM G173-03) solar irradiance spectra (Fig. S15b†).
As summarized in Table S1,† the photocurrent density at 0 V vs. RHE and the maximum ABPE obtained by Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx were further compared with earlier reports. The photocurrent density and ABPE obtained in the present study are comparable to the current best Sb2Se3 photocathode based on a high-cost RuOx catalyst (Sb2Se3/TiO2/RuOx, −30 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, 2.33% at 0.26 V vs. RHE).22 Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx exhibited a higher half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency than that of p–n junction crystalline silicon-based photocathodes with the catalyst MoSx,44 and a much higher light-driven hydrogen generation activity than those of Cu2O, GaInP2, and InP-based photocathodes.31,35,37,45
2.3 Role of the In2S3 buffer layers
In order to understand how the In2S3 buffer layer improves the PEC hydrogen evolution, the function of In2S3 was studied. Firstly, the IPCE spectra for Sb2Se3-based photocathodes at 0 V vs. RHE with and without In2S3 layers were plotted (Fig. S16†). The IPCE values for the photocathodes with a hydrothermal reaction time of 1.5 and 2 h for the introduction of In2S3 increased compared to that of the bare Sb2Se3 electrode, and then decreased dramatically in the range of 350–500 nm when the hydrothermal growth time was extended to 3 and 4 h. According to the UV-vis reflectance spectra of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 and Sb2Se3 films (Fig. S16b†), the presence of the In2S3 layer could provide better light trapping, which significantly suppressed the reflection across the absorption region of 300–900 nm when compared to that of the bare Sb2Se3 nanorods. However, the reflection at approximately 600 nm increased dramatically when the hydrothermal treatment time of In2S3 increased to 4 h, indicating that the thick In2S3 layer blocked the light absorption of the Sb2Se3 nanorods and decreased their light trapping ability, which led to the decrease in the IPCE. Thus, the photocurrent density showed a volcano-like relationship with the thickness of the In2S3 layer, while the onset potential remained constant (i.e. ∼0.40 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 3a). This implies that the photons absorbed by the In2S3 made no obvious contribution to the photocurrent density; otherwise, the photocurrent should increase with the thickness of the In2S3 layer (e.g. ∼2.0 eV, ∼620 nm).22 Thereafter, from an optical point of view, the In2S3 layer was speculated to mainly contribute to light trapping rather than photon absorption, and most likely served as a buffer layer to promote charge separation by forming a heterojunction with the Sb2Se3 nanorods.
The band diagram of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 photocathode were calculated from the UV-vis absorbance spectra (Fig. S17 and S18†) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S19†). The results showed that the Sb2Se3 has a valence band energy (EVB) of −4.94 eV and conduction band energy (ECB) of −3.83 eV with a band gap of 1.11 eV, while the EVB and ECB of In2S3 on Sb2Se3 are located at −5.81 eV and −3.72 eV, respectively. The onset potential of MoSx for hydrogen evolution is −0.15 V vs. RHE (Fig. S12†). Accordingly, the band alignment diagram of the Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathode could be drawn as shown in Fig. S20.† Additionally, the work function of Sb2Se3 is −4.53 eV; when In2S3 was deposited on the surface of Sb2Se3, the work function of the p–n junction increased to −4.05 eV, indicating that greater band bending occurred in the In2S3/Sb2Se3 configuration.28,46 From this band diagram and work function analysis, we found that the n-type semiconductor In2S3 could effectively improve the charge carrier separation and reduce the recombination at the Sb2Se3 and catalyst interface, as well as providing large band bending, which could induce a larger photovoltage and a lower onset potential for light-driven reactions.47–49
To confirm this speculation, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was selected to explore and quantify the surface charge recombination and transfer kinetics. For this measurement, an AC perturbation was added to the illumination with the intensity-modulated light at fixed applied potentials. The periodic photocurrent response depended on the light-modulation frequency. The IMPS responses of the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes are shown in Fig. 4a and S16.† The high-frequency intercept was normalized to 1 for each sample; the normalized low-frequency intercept in the real part corresponds to ktrans/(krec + ktrans), which is defined as the charge transfer efficiency (Fig. 4b). The frequency corresponding to the maximum imaginary value equals the sum of krec and ktrans (krec + ktrans = 2πfmax).49–52 The calculated values of ktrans and krec for different potentials are therefore readily accessible, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. For all the photocathodes, the ktrans gradually increased with increasing applied potential. This is because as the band bending increased progressively, the photogenerated electrons on the electrode surface could overcome the energy barrier and thus react with the protons in the electrolyte more easily. Simultaneously, due to the electric field, the carrier separation is accelerated and recombination is suppressed so that the krec also decreases gradually for the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes.53 However, lower values of krec and higher values of ktrans could be obtained when In2S3 was immobilized between the surface of the Sb2Se3 semiconductor and the MoSx catalyst at the same applied potential. This indicates that the rate of effective electron transfer from the surface of the electrodes to the electrolyte can be improved, and that the surface electron/hole recombination is significantly suppressed at lower applied potentials. Clearly, the In2S3 buffer layer can somehow enhance the hydrogen generation reaction kinetics and reduce the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes of the Sb2Se3 semiconductor. Among the Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes, Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx shows the highest charge transfer efficiency (Fig. 4b) owing to its highest value of ktrans and relatively low value of krec. In contrast to the Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction photocathodes, the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx electrode has a dendritic core–shell nanorod structure, which can provide noticeable advantages including the exposure of additional active sites, low series resistance, and enhanced electrolyte and gas diffusion.54–57 Therefore, the highest value of ktrans was obtained for Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx.

Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) measurements were employed as a supplementary technique to further explore the interface charge-transfer behavior of the Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes. The typical PEIS responses of the bare Sb2Se3/MoSx and Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes at 0.2 V vs. RHE under illumination are shown in Fig. 5a. A representative Nyquist plot involves two semicircles that can be fitted to a resistor–capacitor equivalent circuit (Fig. 5b).58–61 In this equivalent circuit, Rs represents the series resistance of the circuit that models the Mo/Sb2Se3 interface at high frequencies; Rbulk is the bulk resistance between Sb2Se3 and the catalyst; Cbulk represents the constant phase element corresponding to the capacitance of the electrodes; CH and Rct characterize the surface-state capacitance and charge-transfer resistance of the Helmholtz layer at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, respectively. The corresponding calculated values of the parameters are listed in Table S2.† Compared to that of Sb2Se3/MoSx, arcs with much smaller radii in the high-frequency region (Rbulk/Cbulk) were obtained for the Sb2Se3/In2S3-1.5/MoSx, Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx, and Sb2Se3/In2S3-3/MoSx photocathodes under illumination. This result suggests that the bulk charge transfer was significantly promoted by the Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction. When the thickness of the In2S3 was further increased, the charge-transfer resistance of the Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction dramatically increased (e.g. the Rbulk value of 17.4 Ω for Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx increased to 47.7 Ω for Sb2Se3/In2S3-4/MoSx), which will significantly decrease the PEC performance. The magnitude of Rct reflects the charge transfer of the Helmholtz layer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The larger Rct (22.4 Ω) of the Sb2Se3/MoSx electrode indicated its slower charge-transfer kinetics, which is consistent with the higher values of charge transfer efficiency obtained from IMPS measurements (Fig. 4d). The Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx electrode exhibited the smallest-diameter low-frequency arc, which reflected its lowest electron-transfer resistance (Rct = 6.42 Ω) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, indicating that the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx has the greatest specific surface area and many more active sites for hydrogen generation (highest values of Cbulk and CH) than the other Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx electrodes. The results of the PEIS and IMPS measurements revealed that the superior performance of Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode compared to the other Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx electrodes was due to the promotion of charge separation/transfer and reduction of the charge-transfer resistance via the dendritic core–shell nanorod structure heterojunction, which had more exposed reaction sites.

3. Conclusions
In summary, high-performance low-cost photocathodes based on the semiconductor Sb2Se3 were prepared via decorating the noble-metal-free catalyst MoSx on the surface of Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction electrodes. The insertion of an In2S3 layer between Sb2Se3 and the MoSx catalyst positively shifted the onset potential and improved the hydrogen generation efficiency of the device. The performances of the Sb2Se3/In2S3/MoSx photocathodes were significantly influenced by the morphology of the In2S3 layers. Thick In2S3 layers block the light absorption of Sb2Se3 and increase the charge-transfer resistance, resulting in decreased PEC performance. The improved charge separation in the Sb2Se3/In2S3 heterojunction combined with the increased number of active sites on the electrode surface significantly accelerated the charge-transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode with a dendritic core–shell nanorod structure exhibited the highest activity for light-driven hydrogen generation. An outstanding photocurrent density of −27 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE and a remarkable half-cell solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 2.6% were obtained using the Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx photocathode under 100 mW cm−2 illumination with an AM 1.5G filter. Our work may provide an in-depth understanding of the construction of Sb2Se3 heterojunction-based semiconductor photocathodes for light-driven hydrogen generation.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Preparation of Sb2Se3/In2S3 photocathodes
Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays were fabricated on selenized Mo glass using a closed-space sublimation (CSS) method as described in a previous work.25 In2S3 was deposited on Sb2Se3 nanorod arrays using a hydrothermal method in which 0.58 g of InCl3·4H2O was dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water, and citric acid (1.26 g) and thioacetamide (0.45 g) were then added to the solution under constant stirring. The prepared Sb2Se3 films were placed appropriately in a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL). After hydrothermal treatment at 80 °C for 1.5–4 h, the reaction was naturally cooled to room temperature. The resulting films were taken out and rinsed with ethanol and water several times, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. Finally, the films (Sb2Se3/In2S3) were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in air. The prepared Sb2Se3/In2S3 films with different In2S3 thicknesses were named Sb2Se3/In2S3-1.5, Sb2Se3/In2S3-2, Sb2Se3/In2S3-3 and Sb2Se3/In2S3-4, respectively.
4.2 Deposition of the MoSx hydrogen evolution catalyst
Before the catalyst MoSx was deposited onto the Sb2Se3, a TiO2 layer was deposited on the Sb2Se3 and Sb2Se3/In2S3 films via a homemade atomic layer deposition (ALD) system to protect the semiconductors, in which the Ti and O sources were tetrakisdimethylamidotitanium (TDMAT) and H2O, respectively. One deposition cycle involved a TDMAT pulse of 0.4 s, a N2 pulse of 20 s, a H2O pulse of 0.2 s, and a N2 purging of 30 s. The deposition temperature was 120 °C. A TiO2 coating with a thickness of approximately 10 nm was deposited using 200 cycles. The MoSx catalyst was deposited onto the Sb2Se3-based photocathodes via a photoelectrodeposition method. Briefly, the photoelectrodeposition process was implemented in a standard three-electrode cell with Sb2Se3-based photocathodes as the working electrodes; a Ag/AgCl reference electrode; a graphite counter electrode; and a solution containing (NH4)2MoS4 (0.25 mM) and NaClO4 (0.1 M) as the electrolyte. The area of catalyst deposition was controlled using Teflon tape. A constant current density of −50 μA cm−2 was passed through the working electrodes for 30 min. After MoSx deposition, the resulting electrodes were carefully washed with deionized water. Finally, the Sb2Se3 electrodes with only a TiO2 protective layer and the In2S3-decorated Sb2Se3 electrodes were denoted as Sb2Se3/MoSx, Sb2Se3/In2S3-1.5/MoSx, Sb2Se3/In2S3-2/MoSx, Sb2Se3/In2S3-3/MoSx, and Sb2Se3/In2S3-4/MoSx, respectively.
4.3 PEC measurements
All photoelectrochemical characterizations were conducted using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. The PEC performance curves of the photocathodes were characterized in a three-electrode system including a graphite counter electrode and a Hg/Hg2SO4 reference electrode. A Newport Oriel LCS-100 solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter (class A spectral match, 100 mW cm−2) was selected as the light source, and the irradiance spectrum was measured using an AvaSpec, Avantes spectrometer. LSV curves were obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 without iR compensation in a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C, and the potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the expression ERHE = E(Hg/Hg2SO4) + E(Hg/Hg2SO4vs. RHE), where E(Hg/Hg2SO4vs. RHE) is the potential difference between Hg/Hg2SO4 and a commercialized RHE (HydroFlex®). The calculated RHE was further estimated from the pH value of the electrolyte and confirmed from the open circuit voltage of a Pt net electrode (4 cm2) in the electrolyte with hydrogen bubbling. The IPCE measurements of the Sb2Se3-based photocathodes were directly measured using a workstation (CIMPS-2, Zahner), where the wavelength range was chosen as 365–1020 nm at constant applied potential of 0 and 0.19 V vs. RHE, respectively. The ABPE of the Sb2Se3-based photocathodes was calculated using the expression ABPE (%) = (0 − Eapplied) × (jlight − jdark)/Pinput.
4.4 Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS)
The PEIS spectra of the Sb2Se3-based photocathodes were obtained at a constant potential of 0.2 V vs. RHE in a solution of H2SO4 (0.1 M) under solar-simulator illumination over the frequency range of 0.1 to 100 kHz with a 5 mV AC amplitude by electrochemical station (Zahner). The EIS spectrum was fitted using the Zahner analysis software.
4.5 Intensity modulated photocurrent spectra (IMPS)
IMPS measurements of Sb2Se3-based photocathodes were performed using a photoelectrochemical workstation (CIMPS-2, Zahner) with a white light-emitting diode with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2; 10% superimposition of sinusoidal modulation; and a frequency range of 0.1 to 250 kHz.
