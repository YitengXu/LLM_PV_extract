    , Accepted 27th January 2012First published on 30th January 2012AbstractFour different species of ionically conductive polymers were synthesized and successfully implemented to formulate novel quasi-solid electrolytes for dye solar cells. A power conversion efficiency superior to 85% of the correspondent liquid electrolyte as well as an excellent cell's stability was demonstrated after 500 days of storage.
In 1991 the seminal paper by O'Regan and Gratzel1 on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) opened up the possibility to the use of devices based on molecular components for the construction of robust large-scale solar electricity production facilities. DSSCs still represent to date the most suited candidate for the next generation of building integrated photovoltaics,2 since they are in fact low cost, easily fabricated, environmental friendly and are characterized by a relatively high energy conversion efficiency.
Nevertheless, there are several practical factors still limiting their industrial application, such as the possible desorption of the attached dyes, the corrosion of the counter electrodes and the leakage or volatilization of the liquid solvent,3 which inhibit the long-term performances and practical use of the DSSCs. Regarding the latter drawback, several methods have been so far proposed to replace the liquid electrolyte with ionic liquids,4 p-type semiconductors,5 organic and inorganic hole-transporting materials.6 In particular, solidification of liquid electrolytes with chemically cross-linked gelators is one of the most widely adopted solutions,7 but it frequently deteriorates the device performances because diffusion of ionic species is retarded by polymer backbones and interfacial resistances between gel electrolytes and electrodes resulted sensitively increased.8
In this regard, a viable approach is constituted by the implementation of polymer gel electrolytes (PGEs).7,8 Compared to other species of solid and quasi-solid electrolytes, PGEs appear to have superior properties in terms of ionic conductivity, thermal stability, contacting and filling properties of the nanostructured TiO2 electrode. This is due to the fact that ions can move freely in the solution phase trapped by the polymer network, which mainly acts as a stiffener. However, the efficiency and stability of a gel-state DSSC are intimately related to the amount and nature of polymer employed to prepare the electrolyte.9
Starting from these remarks we synthesized four novel classes of ion conducting polymers and used them as gelling agents to formulate quasi-solid electrolytes. More specifically four different building blocks have been mutually combined and the impact of the polymer's molecular structure evaluated in terms of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), power conversion efficiency and environmental stability in dye solar cells. In order to obtain a good compromise between conductivity and viscosity of the resulting electrolyte, radical copolymerizations were properly set up with a 1:8 molar ratio in the polymer between N-vinylimidazole (VI) or 4-vinylpyridine (4VPy) with methylmethacrylate (MMA) or 2,2,2-trifluoroethylmethacrylate (TFEMA), respectively.10 A quaternization reaction of pending imidazole/pyridine moieties with iodomethane then followed to obtain the polyelectrolytes. Molecular structures of the here described copolymers are shown in Fig. 1. Details about the general synthetic procedure and chemical characterization are instead reported in the ESI† section.

Gel electrolytes were finally prepared by dissolving a 20 wt% amount of the synthesized copolymers in a liquid electrolyte consisting of DMPII (0.9 mol l−1) and iodine (0.15 mol l−1) in 3-methoxypropionitrile:3-methyl-2-oxazolidinone = 1:1 (wt/wt). This corresponding liquid electrolyte (LE-MPN) was also used as reference along with a second liquid electrolyte (LE-ACN) consisting of DMPII (0.6 mol l−1), iodine (0.05 mol l−1), 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 mol l−1) and LiI (0.1 mol l−1) in acetonitrile; a PVDF-co-HFP gel electrolyte was also prepared according to the procedure described by Wang et al.11 and used as reference gel.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were thus performed with the aim to investigate the thermal stabilty of our PGEs in comparison to the PVDF-co-HFP-based one. Fig. 2 shows the TGA plots detected in a range between 25 °C and 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. A three-step mechanism is involved in the thermodegradation of PGEs: initial loss of ∼60% in the 25–200 °C range corresponds to solvent volatilization, whereas the second step (in the 220–320 °C range) can be referred to polymer and organic salts (DMPII) degradation. As clearly detectable from the slope of the first straight of the thermogravimetric plot, the volatilization rate of solvent is sensitively slower in our polymer gel electrolytes than in PVDF-co-HFP reference, this can be both attributed to the presence of high boiling 3-methoxypropionitrile as solvent and to a more effective trapping effect of the polymeric matrix. Hence, at 150 °C our PGEs exhibit an extremely lower weight loss, that is around 30 wt%, with respect to the reference gel which in turn lost more than 70% of its initial weight.

In Fig. 3 we report a cross-sectional view of a photoelectrode filled with the P(TFEMA-VI)-based electrolyte taken from a disassembled dye solar cell ten days after the fabrication date. The liquid phase deeply fills the photoanode's mesopores, thus allowing an adequate regeneration of oxidized dye; the polymeric phase instead does not effectively penetrate the TiO2 film. It indeed forms a highly dense crust where the remaining portion of liquid comes to be practically retained within the polymer matrix.

Therefore an accurate impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out on test cells having a Pt/electrolyte/Pt sandwich configuration12 with an active area of 0.2 cm2. In Table 1 we report the values of the most meaningful electrochemical parameters as obtained by fitting the impedance spectra by means of the Randles equivalent electrical circuit.13 As observable, the serial resistance (Rs), including the resistance of bulk electrolyte and the platinized TCO coated glass, is dominating the impedance of the cell in our PGEs. In spite of their higher viscosity, both the P(TFEMA-VI)-based and P(MMA-VI)-based electrolytes showed an apparent diffusion coefficient DI3− lying in the same order of magnitude with respect to the liquid electrolyte: in particular, the diffusion coefficient of I3− in the P(TFEMA-VI)-based electrolyte results reduced as low factor as 2.44 with respect to the corresponding liquid reference (based on MPN) (2.93 × 10−6vs. 1.20 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). An enhancement of the apparent diffusion coefficient was observed in the VI-quaternized polymers with respect to the 4VPy-quaternarized ones. Besides, a slight enhancement of DI3− was also observed in the case of TFEMA-based hosts with respect to their MMA-based homologues. Hence it can be deducted that the chemical nature of the quaternary salt influences the diffusion of triiodide in the gel electrolyte more than the presence/absence of the fluoralkyl moiety on the acrylic backbone. This sequence hence suggests a corresponding meaningful hierarchy holding among the ionic conductivity σ of the four different polymeric hosts. All the PGEs showed instead similar values of Rct (charge transfer resistance) and Cct (charge transfer capacitance), which testified their good compatibility with the platinum interface.

Values of the photo conversion efficiency (η%), fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) measured for DSCs based on 12 μm-thick photoelectrodes14 are also reported in Table 1. The above referred trend was even detected from the analysis of the photovoltaic performances.

        Cells filled with P(MMA-4VPy)-based electrolytes produced a relatively low photocurrent density (7.85 mA cm−2) with respect to the P(MMA-VI)- and P(TFEMA-VI)-based ones, which indeed exhibited a narrow gap with respect to the photocurrent density values observed for the MPN:NMO-based reference electrolyte, but a slightly lower fill factor. In view of a JSC of 12.01 mA cm−2 as well as a power-conversion efficiency of 6.22% provided by the liquid electrolyte, P(TFEMA-VI)-based one rendered in fact a maximum JSC value of 11.69 mA cm−2 and a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.73% (Table 1). These performances are well superior to those ones detected from the cells filled with the PVDF-co-HFP gel electrolyte, in spite of its relatively higher value of ionic conductivity. Such a discrepancy is basically attributable to the role of imidazolium/pyridine moieties in our polymers, which enhance a mechanism of coordination–decoordination of iodide ions along the polymer chain, differently from the charge transport through ionic mass diffusion occurring within the nonionic polymeric network of PVDF-co-HFP.
Finally an aging test was carried out at room temperature for 500 days on DSSCs which had been simply sealed by means of a Parafilm™ gasket. Fig. 4 shows the change in power conversion efficiency as a function of the cell's age: during the first 3–4 weeks of storage efficiency of the ionically conductive polygels was subjected to a sensitive raise and reached its top value between 25 and 35 days after the electrolyte filling date. In particular a continuous increment of the short circuit photocurrent was detected: this was reasonably associated to an increase in the regeneration rate of dye as a consequence of the gradual permeation of the electrolyte into the mesoporous structure of the photoanode. In the DSSC containing the MPN-based liquid electrolyte efficiency decreased from 6.22% to 1.50% after 30 days, whereas for the DSSC with PVDF-based gel electrolyte efficiency decreased from 4.65% to 3.05% after 100 days of storage.
 Fig. 4  Efficiency variation detected cells filled with six different electrolytes and sealed with a Parafilm™ gasket. 
All the cells filled with our novel PGEs exhibited instead an exceptional long term stability: after 500 days storage they still maintained an as high power conversion efficiency as 85% of their maximum value.
These results suggest that a fine matching between the liquid and polymeric phases has been disclosed in our electrolytes. Once the ionic liquid completely fills the whole TiO2 mesopores volume, that is, when the cell reaches its regime state, it comes to be in fact practically trapped within them, whereas the remaining liquid phase comes to be mostly consumed within the polymeric crust. This practically leads to the abatement of the leakage phenomena associated to volatilization of the organic solvent. In addition, the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the gels (especially of the TFEMA-based ones) positively impacts on the device chemical stability, since it effectively prevents moisture's absorption.15
In summary, we designed and synthesized a novel class of ion conductive polymers suitable to be implemented as effective gelators in iodine/iodide-based liquid electrolytes for dye solar cells and hence to make them capable to overcome most of the practical limitations to date ascribed to commercially available solid-state electrolytes.
