Introduction
Photovoltaic cells are the most promising avenues for directly converting solar photons to electricity. Solid-state organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells are hailed as the recent major breakthrough in low-cost photovoltaics owing to their power conversion efficiency (PCE) increase from 3.8% to ∼20.1% in a matter of 6 years.1–7 In most of the highly efficient organometal halide perovskite solar cell devices, organic hole conductors are usually used for charge transport purposes.8,9 Generally, hole transport materials (HTMs) can be classified into three categories for perovskite solar cells, including inorganic molecules,10–12 small organic molecules, and conjugated polymers.13,14 Small molecule HTMs have been widely employed in efficient perovskite solar cells due to their critical role in charge carrier transportation and retardation of charge recombination.14–16 Until now, amorphous organic spiro-MeOTAD is the best choice as a HTM for perovskite solar cells. However, its shortcomings of poor crystallinity, ambient degradation, multiplex synthetic approach, high cost and strong accumulation of charge still limit its application.17,18 Other HTMs featuring methoxy-phenylamine functional groups, such as triazineTh-OMeTPA,19 PST1,20 Py-C,21 SGT-405,22 KTM3,23 T103,24 and X51,25 have also been tested in perovskite solar cells, resulting in PCEs in the range of 9–15%. Recently, spiro-thiophene derivative-based materials (SCPDT-BiT) were reported as HTMs for CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite devices, giving a PCE of 10.4% in the presence of additives.26 Because of the existence of sp3 nitrogen atoms, the inherent triangular pyramid configuration leads to large steric hindrance and intermolecular distances. Consequently, these HTMs are usually anisotropic in their pristine form with low mobility and low conductivity.27–30 Therefore, dopants such as LiCF3SO3 have been widely applied to increase the conductivity of the HTMs and improve the power conversion efficiency of the devices.31–33 However, the deliquescent behaviour of HTMs with dopants accelerates device performance degradation and greatly reduces the device's lifetime, which are fatal for their practical applications. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop dopant-free HTMs for stable perovskite solar cells.28,34,35
In this regard, ideal small molecules should have good solubility in common solvents in order to be used for wet processes, appropriate molecular weight to support film forming properties, moderate and well-matched HOMO energy levels, and good hole mobility to avoid dopants. Oligothiophenes are a very important class of organic semiconducting materials due to their high electron density, charge-carrier mobility, and low aromaticity, which have been widely investigated in organic photovoltaics and organic field-effect transistors.36,37 Compared to these materials with perpendicular spiro-thiophene structures, in which crystallization can be totally suppressed, in this work we introduce a “X” swivel-cruciform structure (3,3′-bithiophene core) as the molecule core in bithiophene derivatives as HTMs for solar cell application. This particular molecular design is expected to allow the crystallization of thiophene derivatives and thus provide reasonable mobility for efficient hole transport. In addition to this, compared to those linear small molecules, the cross centre connected with a single bond presents an incomplete distortion, which could suppress excessive crystallization, increasing the solubility and film forming properties. We efficiently synthesised α,α′-dihexyloligo-thiophenes (DHPT-SC),38,39 α,α′-diisooctyloligo-thiophenes (DOPT-SC), and α,α′-diethoxyethyl-oligothiophenes (DEPT-SC) as HTMs for perovskite solar cells. The three samples have the same conjugated backbone but vary with different branched chains. Without any dopants, the CH3NH3PbI3-based devices exhibit PCEs of 8.35%, 8.69%, and 9.73% with good air stability.
Experimental section
Materials synthesis
The key step in the materials synthesis is the Stille coupling reaction. Efficient yields of 81%, 76%, and 75% could be obtained for DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC and DEPT-SC, respectively. The details of synthesis processes and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization are described in Scheme 1 and ESI Fig. S1–S7.†

Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (F:SnO2) coated glass (Pilkington TEC 15, 15 Ω square−1) was firstly patterned. The cleaned substrates were treated in a UV-O3 chamber for 30 minutes prior to spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using 40 mL of a titanium diisopropoxidebis (acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:39, v/v) and oxygen as carrier gas, and sintered on a hot plate for 1 h at 500 °C. The TiO2 compact layer thickness determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was 30–50 nm. The compact layer was spin-coated with a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NRD, 30 nm average particle size) diluted in anhydrous ethanol (1:3 weight ratio) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The porous TiO2 film was about 250 nm thick. After drying at 125 °C, the mesoporous TiO2 films were heated to 500 °C for 30 min. PbI2 solution in N,N-dimethylformamide (500 mg mL−1) was spin coated on the mesoporous TiO2 film at 6500 rpm for 90 s followed by thermal annealing on the hotplate (70 °C) for 30 min in a glovebox. After cooling, the films were dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (diluted in 2-propanol, 10 mg mL−1) for 30 s, rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. After drying, the aforementioned films were spin coated with a HTM layer. The solution of DHPT-SC is 10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene, DOPT-SC is 15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene, and DEPT-SC is 20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. The rate for the three solutions is 1000, 1500 and 3000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. Finally, 60–80 nm-thick gold films were thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber on top of the devices.
Results and discussion
We successfully obtained the crystal structure of DOPT-SC by a liquid diffusion method in dichloromethane and acetone solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the crystal structure and packing of 3,3′-bithiophene derivatives, which enables us to analysis the intermolecular π–π packing. As shown in Fig. 1a, the ORTEP drawing unambiguously clarifies the ten thiophene rings and the alkyl chain. With a similarity to the perpendicular spiro structure, the two cross centre cores exhibit a dihedral angle of 63.7°, indicating an “X” swivel-cruciform structure. Importantly, compared to the spiro structure, this cross structure with a single bond is more beneficial to form effective stacking of molecules. The adjacent coplanar rings make up the shape of rhombus along with the c axis (Fig. 1b). This continuous rhombus can improve hole mobility due to the intermolecular π–π stacking.40 The coplanar thiophene rings were observed to overlap with another four counterparts of nearby molecules. As far as we known, the π–π stacking interaction can be caused by the attraction of positive and negative electron clouds. The overlapping areas, packing style, and inter-planar spacing determine the stacking intensity.41 As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the mutually parallel aromatic rings are stacked with an offset-face-to-face pattern. Parallel to the other two adjacent planes, the stacking distances with weak edge–edge overlap were evaluated to be 3.516 and 3.375 Å, respectively. This would decrease the intermolecular transfer integral42,43 being the main difference between the crystal DOPT-SC and amorphous spiro-OMeTAD.

Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC, DEPT-SC and spiro-OMeTAD in dichloromethane (DCM), and their corresponding thin films. The corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1. Contrary to spiro-OMeTAD, the three new HTMs show partial absorption in the visible region. It is noted that the three new materials present almost the same absorption due to a similar molecule structure. The observed broad peak at ∼430 nm can be attributed to the thiophene present as the conjugate backbone in the samples. A minor red shift by 6 nm was found in the absorption of DHPT-SC compared to the other two samples.

Fig. S8† displays the thermal behaviour of three new HTMs. The TGA indicates good thermal stability up to 441, 425, and 386 °C for DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC, and DEPT-SC under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, respectively. Fig. S9† presents the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements from room temperature to 250 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. We can clearly observe skew-symmetric melting peaks and crystallization peaks from the heating and cooling curves of the three samples. DOPT-SC with branched alkyl chains has the lowest crystallization temperature (TC) and melting temperature (Tm) as shown in Table 1.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC and DEPT-SC within anhydrous DCM containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4N+PF6−) as the supporting electrolyte in a three electrode system. The HOMO energy level can be calculated according to EHOMO = −4.8 − (EOX − E1/2(Fc/Fc+)), where EOX is the onset oxidation potential (vs. Fc/Fc+). We observed a similar oxidation potential for the three samples with the same conjugated backbone. The HOMO energy level was estimated to be −5.15 eV, −5.16 eV, and −5.14 eV for DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC, and DEPT-SC, respectively. Compared with spiro-OMeTAD, the HOMO level for the three samples was negatively shifted by 100 meV. This could be caused by the extension of the conjugation length using the thiophene unit, which assists in gaining higher open circuit potentials for photovoltaic devices as discussed below. The appropriate HOMO level matches well with the valence-band level of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.44 eV), ensuring efficient driving force for hole transport from CH3NH3PbI3 to the HTM layer (Fig. 3).44

Fig. 4a illustrates the energy lever diagram of various components. The photo-induced electron transfers from CH3NH3PbI3 to TiO2 while the hole transfers from CH3NH3PbI3 to the HTM. Herein, the TiO2 mesoscopic film about 300 nm thick was covered by a ∼100 nm HTM layer on the top of the CH3NH3PbI3 film (Fig. 4b). CH3NH3PbI3 was formed through spin-coating in combination with a sequential deposition method. Since the mesoporous film is fully filled with CH3NH3PbI3, it is difficult to identify the boundary between the TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 layers by using SEM images.

Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves tested under AM 1.5G simulated irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2. The solar cells were fabricated with a typical configuration of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au. The JSC for these cells using DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC and DEPT-SC are 15.60, 15.70, and 16.51 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are comparable to the spiro-OMeTAD device with a current of 12.93 mA cm−2. Since the photocurrent is corrected with charge collection and charge extraction, we performed hole mobility characterization for the three samples. A conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/HTM/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) was fabricated for the measurement. At room temperature, the hole mobility of DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC, and DEPT-SC was evaluated to be 5.98 × 10−6, 8.4 × 10−6, and 2.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The mobility depends on the molecular structure, purity, defects and intermolecular packing. Therefore, molecular space arrangement can play a significant role in charge transport. The trend of mobility for various HTMs is consistent with the photocurrent of perovskite devices based on them, showing that the DEPT-SC device has the highest output current. The augmented photocurrent in the DEPT-SC based device could be attributed to its polar ether chain, which can easily form a dipolar interaction with CH3NH3+ of CH3NH3PbI3. This type of van der Waals force is beneficial to hole-extraction at the interface between DEPT-SC and CH3NH3PbI3.45 The photovoltage has been suggested to be mostly determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO level of HTMs. This can be explained well in our test result, showing that the photovoltage of devices with new HTMs is about 15 mV higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD based devices. The resulting device performances yielded PCEs of 8.35%, 8.69%, 9.73% and 5.38% for DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC, DETP-SC and spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells. This result suggests that the new HTM works efficiently in perovskite solar cells. By using dopants, the PCE of spiro-OMeTAD devices can be promoted to much higher values at the cost of device stability. Therefore, we believe that it is worthy to further study the device performance after optimization including doping.

The devices with new HTMs show a higher IPCE response in Fig. 5b from 400 to 750 nm than the device using pristine spiro-OMeTAD. This is in good agreement with the current density of the device. The durability of perovskite solar cells is an important issue for their practical application. In this study, we have proved that using dopant-free HTMs can largely improve the cell stability. Fig. 5c shows the photovoltaic performance during a 240 h aging test of the devices using the HTMs in air atmosphere with a humidity of about 35%. The PCEs of DHPT-SC, DOPT-SC and DEPT-SC devices decay about 23%, 28%, and 30%, respectively, which is more stable than that of the spiro-OMeTAD device (52%). The present findings show that the 3,3′-bithiophene derivatives are promising candidates as pristine hole transporting materials.
Conclusion
In summary, three derivatives of 3,3′-bithiophene have been synthesised by the Stille reaction and tested as promising HTM candidates for perovskite solar cells without dopants. Compared with DHPT-SC and DOPT-SC, DETP-SC yields an efficiency of 9.73%, which may be due to the good interface effect with the CH3NH3PbI3 layer between the ether chains and methylamine. Further efforts by modifying the chemical structure and tuning the property of bithiophene derivatives guarantee their bright future as doping-free HTMs for perovskite solar cells.
