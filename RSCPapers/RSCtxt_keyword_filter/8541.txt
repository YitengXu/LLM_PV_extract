    , Accepted 11th April 2022First published on 2nd May 2022AbstractIn organic solar cell research, developing efficient and low-cost photovoltaic materials via insertion of fluorine (F) and nitrogen (N) substituents has proved as a highly successful strategy, thus raising the question of choosing between these substituents while designing new materials. In this work, two new low-cost polymer donors, P1-2F and P2-2N, based on an alternate chlorinated thienyl benzodithiophene donor and 2,5-difluorobenzene (2FBn) and pyrazine (Pz) as a unit as the acceptor core, respectively, were synthesized and compared in parallel to investigate the synergistic effects of the insertion of F and N substituents (functional group vs. atomic substitution) on the morphology and photovoltaic performance. Although both strategies effectively lower the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels because of the high electronegativity of these substituents, favorable positioning of the N atom in Pz led to further improved coplanarity, a lower bandgap of 2.07 eV, and enhanced crystallinity and molecular ordering with a shorter π–π spacing distance in P2-2N as revealed by density functional theory and X-ray diffraction results. Besides, combining with the 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-4F) acceptor, P2-2N also maintained optimal nanoscale morphology, excellent charge transfer, and high and more balanced hole and electron mobilities, which subsequently resulted in a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 9.5% with a low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.61 eV and outperformed the corresponding F counterpart P1-2F (8.1% and Eloss of 0.65 eV). The in-depth study using various characterization tools suggested that the lower performance of P1-2F resulted from the inferior nanoscale morphology caused by poor mixing with IT-4F, which significantly reduced the charge carrier mobility and efficient charge transfer. Consequently, these results provide deeper insights and mechanisms for further designing efficient donors with either F or N substituents.
1. Introduction
Over the years, organic solar cells (OSCs) have successfully evolved as the most reliable among futuristic renewable energy technologies because of their distinctive benefits such as solution processability, light weight, semitransparency, low-cost and large-scale roll-to-roll fabrication, etc., and it is believed that they will enter the commercial market soon.1–7 Recently, swift developments in the rational design of low bandgap (LBG) non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFAs) with excellent extinction coefficients and high electron mobilities (μe) have been witnessed,8–12 which rapidly enhanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) from 10% to 18%.8,9,11,13–21 Despite this impressive performance, the relatively low open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the LBG of NFAs and the high synthesis cost of the donor and acceptor materials are the hurdles for commercializing OSCs.22–25 Henceforth, developing novel wide bandgap (WBG) donors having deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels and superior matching with current efficient NFAs and reducing the overall cost of both donor and acceptor by employing simple structured molecular design is gaining significant attention among the OSC research communities. Many studies have been reported recently in this direction.15,23,26,27
Among the commercially viable designs to develop low-cost photoactive materials, insertion of intramolecular “noncovalent interactions/locks” (NCLs) like S⋯O, S⋯N, S⋯F and F⋯H within the aromatic backbones has become a reliable method over the years.28–30 In addition to advantages such as enhanced rigidity, coplanarity, and improved charge transport in the semiconducting backbone, these NCLs also proved to aid significantly in reducing the overall cost by minimizing tedious synthetic steps.26,28,29,31–35 Therefore, a variety of new donors and NFAs have been synthesized, employing this strategy.7,26,28,29,31–37 Although all types of NCLs can effectively enhance the coplanarity of the conjugated backbone by decreasing the steric repulsion between the neighboring molecules, the introduction of N⋯S and F⋯S NCLs further reduce the HOMO energy levels due to the higher electronegativity of N and F substituents.28,38 Thus, both these modifications remain the preferred choice for designing photovoltaic materials with deep HOMO energy levels, which recently delivered a remarkable performance in the corresponding OSCs.23,26,32,39,40 Besides, it is essential to note that most of these reports emphasize the effect of the intrinsic properties of either F or N substituents, including the extent, substitution position, and comparative study with a similar class of materials.29,39,41–44 However, there is no direct comparative structure–property relationship study to emphasize how differently F⋯S and N⋯S NCLs will affect the polymer conformation, molecular packing and crystallinity, nanoscale morphology and photovoltaic properties despite both having different functionalization patterns (i.e., fluorination is functional group variation, whereas N-insertion is heteroatom substitution). The recent impressive results incorporating these unique strategies will raise the question of how to select between insertion of F and N substituents while designing a new efficient donor or acceptor unit for OSC applications.
As both these strategies are already matured, we first compare the intrinsic properties of these substituents to gain a deeper understanding of their effects. (1) Electronegativity: even though both these substituents have proved their potential for decreasing both the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, the higher electronegativity of F compared to N (Pauling electronegativity = 4.0 and 3.04 eV, respectively, for F and N atoms)45,46 will further deepen the molecular energy level of the conjugated molecule. Additionally, this high electronegativity character will promote intermolecular or intramolecular noncovalent interactions, resulting in higher backbone planarity. (2) Dipole moment: unlike the –C–F bond (which has a fixed dipole moment (μ) of 1.41 D),47 the μ of the C–N bond can be significantly varied due to the versatility of the N atom having five valence electrons, which can form stable –C–N single bonds (as in amines or amides) and –CN double bonds (like in imines and pyridines) and –CN (as in nitrile).48 Hence, as reported by Hou et al.,49 we performed the computational calculations of basic aromatic benzene derivatives, i.e., fluorobenzene, pyridine, 1,2-difluorobenzene, and pyridazine units, using density functional theory to predict the effect of the F and N substituents on μ as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Interestingly, the replacement of F by N atoms resulted in enhanced μ and thus can facilitate red-shifted absorption and self-assembly due to the stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. (3) The van der Waals radii: both these atoms exhibit smaller van der Waals radii (1.70 and 1.60 Å for N and F atoms, respectively),50 thereby causing enhanced planarity in the conjugated molecule without a severe steric effect. However, attributed to the different nature and substitution positions of –C–F (F atom lies outside the benzene ring) and –CN bonds (N atom will be in conjugation with a benzene ring), their effects on molecular geometry were elucidated by DFT calculations on dithienyl-substituted benzene, fluorobenzene and pyridine as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Notably, the parent unsubstituted benzene core has a torsion angle of >25° between benzene and adjacent thiophene. Interestingly, the dihedral angle between fluorobenzene and pyridine and adjacent thiophene drastically lowered to ∼11.93° and 0.15° after the addition of fluorine and nitrogen, respectively, due to the N⋯S and F⋯S NCLs, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that N-containing aromatic compounds have a relatively higher planarity than the F-substituted counterparts because N atom is in conjugation with the benzene ring in Pz units. Overall, these small changes can significantly alter the molecular packing and charge transport in related compounds.
Thus, to provide direct comparison effects of F⋯S and N⋯S NCLs through F and N insertion on the properties and photovoltaic performance of polymer donors, we designed two WBG polymer donors, poly-{4,8-bis(4-chloro-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-(3-(2-ethylhexyl)-5-(4-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-difluorophenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene} (P1-2F) and poly-{2-(5-(4,8-bis(4-chloro-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-5-methylthiophen-2-yl)pyrazine}(P2-2N), having the same chlorinated-thienyl benzodithiophene (Cl-BDT) donor and 2,5-difluorobenzene (2FBn) and pyrazine (Pz) as a unit as the acceptor core, respectively (Scheme 1). Among the available low-cost benzene derivatives, 2FBn and Pz units were chosen in the following study due to their commercial availability at a low price, therefore minimizing the overall synthetic complexity. Moreover, both have “C2 symmetry” with symmetrically placed F or N substituents aiding planarization of the backbone via NCLs and an aromatic benzene ring with a large WBG together with F and N-substituents having high electronegativity and thus helping to lower the HOMO and Voc in the corresponding devices paired with appropriately matching LBG NFAs. Here, we found that P2-2N displays red-shifted absorption, enhanced crystallinity, and favorable molecular ordering with a shorter π–π spacing compared to P1-2F and a superior nanoscale morphology to P2-2N:IT-4F-based blend films. Thus, P2-2N-based devices showed a remarkable PCE of 9.5%, with an overall improvement in all the photovoltaic parameters. On the other hand, P1-2F realizes a moderate photovoltaic performance of 8.1% due to a lower charge mobility, poor exciton harvesting and inferior phase-separated morphology with a large domain size. Thus, with the aid of diverse characterization techniques, a clear structure–property relationship study to reveal the distinct effect of N⋯S and F⋯S NCLs on energy level modulation, coplanarity, molecular ordering, morphology, and device performance was performed. Last, this is one of the impressive values among the low-cost polymer design involving alternate BDT and thiophene and/or heteroarene units with various electron-withdrawing substituents as a weak “A” unit reported in the literature (Fig. S7, ESI†).

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of monomers and polymers are given in Fig. 1 and relevant characterization along with a detailed synthetic process is provided in the ESI.† The monomers 2FBn-Br and Pz-Br were synthesized from the commercially available cheap starting materials 1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene (1) and 2,5-dibromopyrazine (2) in two simple steps as reported in a previous report.35,40 Then, copolymers P1-2F and P2-2N were prepared by Stille copolymerization of ClBDT-Sn with 2FBn-Br or Pz-Br, respectively, under a microwave reactor using chlorobenzene (CB) as a solvent. Both the copolymers have good solubility in chloroform and CB. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P1-2F and P2-2N were 32.2 and 30.4 kDa, respectively, with corresponding dispersity (Đ) values of 3.4 and 3.1. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the thermal properties of the polymers were estimated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). P1-2F and P2-2N displayed thermal decomposition temperatures of 431 °C and 421 °C, respectively, at a 5% weight loss, adequate for OSC applications.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level were performed to understand the distinct effects of F or N substitution molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals of the two polymers. To minimize the complexity and save time, 2-ethylhexyl chains in the original polymer structure were modified to methyl chains, and calculations based on two repeating units of polymers were performed, as shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, computational calculations based on the benzene-based polymer (P-Bn) structure were also included to understand the existence of noncovalent interactions due to the insertion of F and N substituents in newly synthesized polymers (Fig. S9, ESI†). In the case of P-Bn, the dihedral angle between the thiophene adjacent to benzene is found to be θ2 = 23.59° and θ2 = 23.16°, which is significantly larger than for 2FBn (θ2 = 3.51° and θ3 = 9.81°) and pyrazine (θ2 = 0.36° and θ3 = 1.97°). Additionally, they also showed a larger angle between Cl-BDT and the thiophene counterpart (θ1/θ4 = 30.78°/32.28°, 30.28°/30.53° and 28.34°/25.39° for P-Bn, P1-2F and P2-2N, respectively). These results substantiate the existence of noncovalent F⋯S and F⋯H NCL interactions between the F substituents of the 2FBn in P1-2F, and N⋯S and N⋯H interactions between the nitrogen atoms of the pyrazine in P2-2N, which can improve the molecular planarity, molecular packing, and charge transfer as reported previously.26,35,40,51 Interestingly, among the polymers, P2-2N not only showed the lowest dihedral angle along the backbone but also exhibited a shorter C–C bond length between Pz and its adjacent thiophene (145.33 pm) compared to P1-2F (145.98 pm) (Fig. 2(a)). These trends provide clear evidence that the introduction of Pz (since N is in conjugation with a benzene ring) further promotes greater planarization of the backbone and eventually leads to a lower bandgap in P2-2N by minimizing rotation barriers compared to P1-2F (where F lies outside the benzene ring in 2FBn, which causes minor torsion). Besides, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), HOMO and LUMO electron clouds were equally distributed along the complete polymer backbone, suggesting effective delocalization of π-electrons via a strong ICT effect (Fig. 2(b) and (c)). Also, the corresponding HOMODFT and LUMODFT energy levels were calculated to be −5.05 and −2.45 eV for P1-2F and −5.01 and −2.30 eV for P2-2N, respectively. These trends in FMO energy levels agreed with the experimental results (discussed below) and deeper HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1-2F attributed to the more substantial electron-withdrawing effect of F over N. Lastly, the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) reveals that both polymers had a continuous negative potential along the polymer backbone, whereas electron-withdrawing F and N atoms showed positive ESPs (Fig. 2(d)).

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the copolymers in solution and thin film states are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The corresponding optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. In chloroform (CF) solution, P1-2F displayed an intense absorption band ranging from 450 to 550 nm with a maximum molar absorptivity coefficient (εmax) of 7.18 × 104 M−1 cm−1 centered around 492 nm. In comparison, P2-2N displayed relatively ∼30 nm red-shifted absorption profiles along with a relatively low εmax of 6.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 525 nm. Meanwhile, in the film state, although both polymers exhibit similar absorption trends as in the solutions, they showed much broader and bathochromically shifted (∼50 nm) spectra, which is indicative of the strong intermolecular π–π stacking.52–54 The optical energy gaps of P1-2F and P2-2N were estimated to be 2.17 eV and 2.07 eV, respectively, calculated from the corresponding absorption onsets (λonset) located at 575 and 603 nm. Further, we measured the absorptivity coefficients of these new polymers in the film state. The absorption coefficients of P1-2F and P2-2N (at 520 nm) and IT-4F (at 715 nm) films were 7.38, 6.52 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 10.68 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Although P1-2F demonstrated a higher absorptivity coefficient than the P2-2N counterpart in both film and solution states, the red-shifted and well-complementary absorption of P2-2N with the IT-4F acceptor is expected to produce effective light-harvesting of the solar spectrum by covering the valley region around 575 nm. These results demonstrate that a minor modification in the polymer backbone via substituent variation or heteroatom insertion caused a substantial effect on their εmax values and the intermolecular interactions and molecular packing in the solid state. These results agree well with the DFT trends.

Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the effect of insertion of F and N atoms on the frontier energy levels of the copolymers. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers in the thin film state were estimated from their corresponding offset oxidation and reduction potentials against the Fc/Fc+ standard (Fig. 3(c)). From the CV profile in Fig. 3(c), the calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1-2F and P2-2N are −5.57/−3.52 eV and −5.53/−3.51 eV, which lead to the electrochemical bandgaps of 2.05 and 2.02 eV, respectively, deduced from the onset potential of oxidation and reduction. Notably, there is a small variation in the optical and electrochemical bandgap values of the polymers, which is attributed to the interface barrier between the polymer film and electrode surface. The CV results reveal that the trends of the optical and electrochemical bandgaps of the polymers were similar, and the lower electronegativity of N over the F atom and the relatively high coplanar backbone are the reasons behind the lower bandgap of P2-2N. Thus, by replacing N with F substituents, the HOMO energy levels of the corresponding polymers are predicted to be further reduced, which is expected to enhance the Voc in the corresponding solar cells. Meanwhile, both these polymers showed complementary absorption and good energy alignment with the non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F (HOMO/LUMO = −5.68/−4.15 eV) with a small HOMO energy offset (ΔEHOMO = 0.1 eV < 0.3 eV). Such features proved beneficial for overall charge transport as reported in many recent highly efficient NF-OSCs (Fig. 3(d)).14,45,55,56
As shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f), the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was utilized to gain information about the packing and molecular orientation properties of pristine P1-2F and P2-2N polymers. It can be seen from the XRD images that both the polymers had a distinct (100) lamellar stacking peak with 2θ at ∼4.7–4.75 Å−1 and a (010) π–π stacking peak only in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The results manifest that both polymers exhibit a “face-on” packing tendency, which is helpful for vertical charge transport in OSCs.22,57,58 By fitting the “q” values of the (010) and (100) peaks, the corresponding π–π stacking and lamellar stacking distances were found to be 3.18 Å and 18.78 Å (for P1-2F) and 3.12 Å and 18.58 Å (for P2-2N), respectively. Furthermore, the coherence length (CCL) estimated using Scherrer's equation (LC = 2π/FWHM) for the (100) and (010) peaks were found to be 18.41 Å and 3.22 Å for P1-2F, and 19.03 Å and 3.73 Å for P2-2N, respectively.59 The shortest lamellar and π–π stacking distances along with relatively larger CCL010 and CCL100 indicate that P2-2N has higher crystallinity among the two polymers. These results clearly show that introducing a pyrazine core in the molecular design is a practical approach for realizing higher crystallinity via stronger cofacial π–π stacking compared to the insertion of a fluorinated phenylene core, which is consistent with the high coplanarity observed for the P2-N polymer in the DFT study.
To understand the effect of these structural modifications on the photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors, solar cell devices with the inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated, and the exact device fabrication conditions are provided in the ESI.† Initially, the donor–acceptor (D–A) blend ratio, the thickness of the active layer and the concentration of different solvent additives were optimized to get the best results (Fig. S10–S13 and Tables S1–S4, ESI†). It was found that the optimized devices of both polymers with similar processing conditions, i.e., polymer:IT-4F blend ratio of 1:1.1, 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive and thermal annealing of the active layer at 140 °C for 10 min, yielded the best performance. Fig. 4 illustrates the optimized current density–voltage (J–V) curves and EQE profiles of the best devices, while detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The best P1-2F:IT-4F-based devices showed a maximum PCE of 8.1% with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters: a Voc of 0.858 V, a Jsc of 17.9 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 51.6%, whereas P2-2N:IT-4F-based devices showed an increased Voc of 0.878 V, a higher Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 58.6%, providing a remarkable PCE of 9.5%. To understand the variation in the Jsc trend, the absorption coefficients of the optimal blend films were estimated (Fig. 4(b)). Notably, the slightly higher Jsc of P2-2N:IT-4F blend films originates from its much red-shifted absorption of P2-2N and well-complimentary absorption profiles of the blend components, which lead to a higher absorption coefficient along 550–750 nm. Besides, they also demonstrated a higher Voc despite a slightly higher HOMO energy compared to P1-2F (−5.53 vs. −5.57 eV) and a significantly higher FF. As reported previously, in addition to the difference between the HOMO (D) and LUMO (A), the Voc in OSCs is affected by several other factors such as D–A interfaces, charge-transfer states, differences in the intermixing of polymer:acceptor phases, morphology, etc.60,61 Thus, these factors comprehensively acted in P1-2F-based devices, which was supported by the PL data, charge carrier mobilities and morphology analysis (discussed below).

To understand the origin of the higher Jsc of the P2-2N:IT-4F-based devices, the EQE spectra of the optimal devices were compared with the corresponding absorption profiles of the blend films (Fig. 4(b) and (c)). It is evident that the EQE profiles of both the blends nearly imitated the absorption profiles of the optimal blend films, and in addition to a higher photoresponse along the 500–800 nm region, the P2-2N:IT-4F blend also demonstrated a maximum EQE (EQEmax) of ∼80% due to a higher absorption coefficient. Conversely, the P1-2F:IT-4F counterpart displayed a lower EQE with an EQEmax of ∼65%, suggesting that the photocurrent generation in the corresponding solar cells is less efficient than for the P2-2N:IT-4F counterpart. These differences mainly arise from the uncomplimentary absorption profiles of the blend components of the P1-2F:IT-4F film, leaving behind a valley region around 575 nm. Meanwhile, the Jsc values calculated from the EQE profiles matched the Jsc values from the J–V curves within a 5% error. The device energy losses (Eloss) are estimated from the equation: Eloss = Eg − qVoc, where Eonsetg was obtained from the EQE spectrum (Table 2).62 Notably, the Eloss of the P2-2N-based device was 0.61 eV, which was smaller than that of the P1-2F counterpart (0.65 eV).
Next, the difference in the charge dissociation in these blends was estimated using the photoluminescence (PL) quenching method. Firstly, to analyze the extent of photoinduced electron transfer, both the polymers and blends were excited at 530 nm and the corresponding PL emission spectra were recorded (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). Evidently, P2-2N:IT-4F displayed better quenching than P1-2F:IT-4F (82% vs. 91%), suggesting that it has superior photoinduced electron transfer. Likewise, the PL emission spectra of blends and pristine IT-4F were obtained by exciting at 700 nm to evaluate the hole transfer efficiency (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). Here also, P2-2N outperforms P1-2F with superior PL quenching efficiencies of 83% and 75%, respectively. Thus, the higher exciton dissociation efficiency of the P2-2N-based blend is one of the factors accountable for the higher Jsc in the related devices.
 Fig. 5  The PL spectra of pristine (a) P1-2F and (b) P2-2N (both films excited at 530 nm), (c) and (d) IT-4F (excited at 700 nm), and (a) and (c) optimal P1-2F:IT-4F and (b) and (d) P2-2N-based blend films (excited at 530 and 700 nm, respectively). 
As charge carrier mobility is also a critical factor that affects the Jsc and FF variation in the devices, the hole and electron mobilities of the optimal P1-2F and P2-2N blend films were estimated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The resulting dark J–V characteristics and summary of the corresponding devices are presented in Fig. S14 (ESI†) and Table 2. In addition to a significantly higher hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of 4.1 × 10−4 and 6.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, compared to the P1-2F-based blend (μh = 6.29× 10−5 and μe = 5.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe/μh = 8.69), the optimal P2-2N-based blend film also demonstrated a superior balance between μh and μe of 1.62. It is well known that high μh values aid in efficient charge transport in OSCs via suppression of the bimolecular and Shockley−Read−Hall recombination. Moreover, a superior balance between μe and μh will further assist in minimizing the built-in space charges, thus subsequently helping in boosting the PCE by increasing the Jsc and FF.63
Then film microstructure and molecular packing within the optimized blend films were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and XRD to further correlate the variation in the Voc and FF in the optimized devices. As shown in the AFM images (Fig. 6(a)–(c)), the P1-2F-based film demonstrated a distinct phase-separated morphology with larger domain sizes of P1-2F and IT-4F phases (>100 nm) along with a relatively large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 7.53 nm. Such a morphology proved to cause charge trapping, limiting the charge dissociation and transport by increasing the degree of charge recombination, which, in turn, leads to a poor Voc and FF and a low efficiency.64 In contrast, P2-2N-based blends films had a relatively smooth and uniform morphology with a smaller domain size (<40 nm) along with an RMS roughness of 1.85 nm (Fig. 6(e)–(h)). The TEM analysis further reveals that the P2-2N:IT-4F film has better miscibility and favorable well-interconnected domains with appropriate phase separation than the P1-2F-blend film, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge collection by increasing the D–A interfacial areas (Fig. 6(d) and (h)). Thus, the superior nanoscale morphology of the P2-2N:IT-4F film serves as an effective pathway for overall charge dissociation and collection by forming good contact with the electrodes, consistent with the more efficient exciton dissociation and higher FF displayed by these blends. Lastly, the XRD images of both blends reveal apparent changes in (100) and (010) scattering relative to the pristine polymer films, suggesting that the molecular packing and orientation of both polymers were affected by the mixing of the IT-4F acceptor (Fig. S15, ESI†). Interestingly, the P1-2F:IT-4F-based blend showed higher molecular ordering with shorter lamellar and π–π stacking distances compared to P2-2N-blends (20.53 and 3.18 Å vs. 21.63 and 3.19 Å, respectively) and retained face-on molecular orientation as summarized in Fig. S10 (ESI†). These results imply the aggregation of P1-2F phases in devices, which may affect the overall charge transport reducing the D–A interfaces and leading to charge transfer pathways.65 Thus, the poor morphology of the P1-2F:IT-4F-based film is the main reason behind its lower charge mobility, poor exciton harvesting and lower PCE. However, P2-2N:IT-4F remarkably maintains face-on molecular orientation with good miscibility and intermixing of the IT-4F phases, as indicated by the slight increase of lamellar spacing and d-spacing distance to pristine P2-2N films. Therefore, favorable molecular packing with the retention of “face-on” molecular ordering of the P2-2N:IT-4F film assisted efficient charge transport in OSCs and helped to realize high Jsc, FF, and enhanced PCE values.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we systematically elucidated the synergistic effect of the insertion of fluorine and nitrogen substituents on the properties and photovoltaic performance of polymer donors by synthesizing two new polymers, P1-2F and P2-2N. Owing to the higher electronegativity of F compared to N atoms and F⋯S and F⋯H noncovalent intermolecular locks, P1-2F displayed good coplanarity and deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels than P2-2N. Still, the inferior phase-separated morphology mixing with IT-4F led to a lower charge carrier mobility and photovoltaic performance of 8.1% in P1-2F-based devices. Interestingly, molecular planarity was further improved in P2-2N due to the superior positioning of the N atom in conjugation with the benzene core as releveled by DFT, which subsequently favored enhanced optical absorption, compact molecular packing, a longer coherence length, a high charge carrier mobility and favorable morphology. As a result, P2-2N:IT-4F based devices produced the highest PCE of 9.5% with an overall improvement in all device parameters, i.e., a Voc of 0.878 V, a higher Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, a FF of 58.6% and a low Eloss of 0.61 eV. Overall, these results illuminate the distinct merits and drawbacks of F⋯S and N⋯S NCLs on the molecular planarity, energy levels, molecular packing, and crystallinity and consequently provide valuable guidelines to choose between two substituents to develop high PCE low-cost polymer donors.
