    , Accepted 15th April 2020First published on 16th April 2020AbstractWe report a perovskite solar mini-module with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 17% based on Lewis base additive engineering and large-area D-bar coating. The precursor solutions for the D-bar coating are prepared by mixing home-made powdered FAPbI3 with CsBr and PbBr2 to form the nominal composition of (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125, where the Lewis base hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) is included as an additive. As compared to the large-area coated perovskite film using the non-additive solution, photovoltaic performance for the perovskite film based on the HMPA-containing solution is much better due to the pinhole-free perovskite morphology and longer carrier lifetime. It is found that HMPA with a higher donor number compared to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) contributes to the formation of a stable adduct intermediate phase to form a dense and uniform perovskite film with high opto-electronic quality. As a result, the 5 × 5 cm2 mini-module demonstrates a PCE of 17.01%, while the small area cell made with pieces of the large-area film shows a PCE of 19.58%. Our study highlights the importance of a stable intermediate for large-area perovskite films.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites are a promising material for high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells. A certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% was demonstrated by a perovskite solar cell (PSC) in 2019,1 which was achieved in a relatively short period from the first report on a solid-state PSC with a PCE of 9.7% in 2012.2 The superb photovoltaic performance of PSCs is related to the high absorption coefficients,3,4 long diffusion lengths,5–7 defect tolerance,8 low exciton binding energy,9 and long charge carrier lifetime10,11 of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites. Regarding the fabrication procedure, small-area (<1 cm2) PSCs can be easily fabricated using a spin-coating method. However, the spin-coating method seems to be inappropriate for large-area perovskite coating. Non-rotational solution processes were proposed for large-area PSCs, such as spray coating,12 blade coating,13–15 slot die coating,16,17 and screen printing.18 In the spin-coating procedure, the polar aprotic solvents, which are generally used to dissolve the perovskite precursors, can be mostly removed by centrifugal force while the sample is rotating at high speed. On the other hand, the non-rotational solution processes should evaporate the polar aprotic solvents from the wet film without the centrifugal force. For this reason, the blade coating or the slot die coating utilizes an air-knife to provide a driving force for the crystallization of perovskites by evaporating the solvents. However, crystallization kinetics during the air-knife blowing is completely different from that of the spin-coating process. Therefore, in the non-rotational solution process, solution engineering becomes critical for making high-quality perovskite coating.
Perovskite compositions have been reported to be mostly methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) for scalable perovskite modules (module: >800 cm2, submodule: 200–800 cm2, minimodule: <200 cm2). Although MAPbI3-based PSCs are well-established technologies, photo- and thermal stabilities of MAPbI3 were reported to be lower than those of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3).19–21 In this regard, recent studies have focused on FA-based PSCs.22,23 For high quality perovskite films, the Lewis acid–base adduct approach is widely used, which controls the nucleation and growth by adjusting the activation energy and growth kinetics.24–28 Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been typically used as a Lewis base additive to form an adduct with Lewis acidic FA cation and PbI2 in a non-annealed film, especially in the spin-coating procedure. A homogeneous perovskite film could be obtained by removing DMSO from the adduct film, which indicates that the physico-chemical properties of the Lewis base additive are expected to affect the perovskite film quality.24,26 For scalable PSCs, however, little study has been carried out with FA-based perovskites,29,30 which is due to the fact that an intermediate Lewis acid–base adduct formed during coating is relatively unstable and uncontrollable.24 This indicates that conventional polar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) might not be suitable for large-area FA-based perovskite coating, which has motivated us to investigate an intermediate adduct engineering with an appropriate Lewis base.
In this study, we successfully demonstrate scalable FA-based perovskite films on a large substrate (8.8 cm × 6.2 cm) by a one-step D-bar coating process with a Lewis acid–base adduct approach using hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) as the Lewis base additive. The D-bar coating has an advantage over other large-area coating methods because only a minimum amount of precursor solution is directly loaded on the D-bar.31–33 The opto-electronic and photovoltaic properties of large-area FA-based perovskite films formed via HMPA are compared with those of the ones formed via DMSO. Using the large-area FA-based perovskite films by a HMPA-induced adduct approach, a small-area device with 0.125 cm2 delivers a PCE of 19.58% and a monolithic minimodule with a size of 5 cm × 5 cm demonstrates a PCE of 17.01% along with an open-circuit voltage of 10.77 V.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic illustration of a large-area perovskite coating process using a D-bar coater. The home-made FAPbI3 powder is mixed with CsBr and PbBr2 and dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent to form (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 perovskite, wherein a Lewis base additive such as DMSO or HMPA is added. A small aliquot of the perovskite precursor solution is directly loaded on the D-bar and the substrate is moved at a speed of 5 mm s−1, where an air-knife is used to remove the DMF. The as-coated perovskite film is heated on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. Molecular structures of the Lewis base additives are presented in Fig. 1b, where both additives have oxygen-bearing lone pair electrons. The Gutmann donor number (DN), a quantitative measure of Lewis basicity, was reported to be 29.8 kcal mol−1 for DMSO and 38.8 kcal mol−1 for HMPA,34,35 which means that HMPA has a stronger ability to solvate (or form an adduct with) cations and/or Lewis acids. In Fig. S1,† the perovskite film formed from the precursor solution containing DMSO looks inhomogeneous due to poor surface coverage, resulting in a shiny-gray film. Incomplete coverage and inhomogeneity on the substrate by slow crystallization and unstable adduct formation result in a shiny-gray film.36 On the other hand, the perovskite film formed in the presence of HMPA leads to improved surface coverage and homogeneity. Photovoltaic performance is found to be strongly dependent on the absence and presence of the Lewis base additive and its Lewis basicity as can be seen in Fig. 1c, where the best performing device is presented among the measured 25 devices. The HMPA-based PSC shows the highest PCE of 19.58% due to the high photovoltaic parameter values of Jsc = 22.90 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.119 V, and FF = 0.764, whereas the DMSO-based PSC shows a lower PCE of 17.37% calculated from Jsc = 20.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.106, and FF = 0.749. The perovskite film formed without a Lewis base, termed the pristine, shows a much lower PCE of 13.84% due to the relatively lower Voc and FF (Jsc = 21.49 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.022, and FF = 0.630). The observed photovoltaic performance is related to the perovskite film morphology shown in Fig. 1d–f, wherein a pinhole-free perovskite film formed with HMPA is responsible for the best performance among all the devices.

The perovskite crystallization during Ar-blowing is investigated using optical microscopy, where the image of a wet film on a glass substrate is taken as a function of the Ar-blowing time as shown in Fig. 2. In the pristine film without a Lewis base additive (Fig. 2a), nucleation occurs obviously after 5 s from the reference time (t0). However, the nucleation starts at t0+7 s for the film with DMSO in Fig. 2b and it is further delayed to t0+10 s for the HMPA case as can be seen in Fig. 2c. In addition, the density of nuclei at the moment of the nucleation increases in the presence of a Lewis base, in which HMPA produces more nuclei than DMSO. This indicates that nucleation is retarded and occurs abruptly with high nuclei density in the presence of a Lewis base, which is probably related to Lewis acid–base interaction. It was reported that the removal process of the Lewis base from the adduct might affect nucleation and crystal growth rate,24,37,38 wherein the activation energy for nucleation is found to be proportional to molecular interactions between the Lewis acidic perovskite precursors and Lewis base additive. Accordingly, the crystal growth is expected to be well controlled by a strong Lewis base, leading to a homogeneous perovskite film. Due to weak Lewis acid–base interactions with DMF and DMSO, the unstable adduct phase partially crystallizes to perovskite to trigger heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent diffusion assisted growth, resulting in discontinuous and inhomogeneous film morphology. In contrast, the stronger Lewis acid–base interaction with HMPA induces a stable adduct film with high activation energy, resulting in high-density uniform nucleation. As a result, growth of crystals does not proceed in the presence of HMPA, which leads to a uniform film with better coverage. In Fig. 1d–f, the average grain size is estimated to be 522 nm in the case of non-additive, 486 nm for DMSO, and 427 nm for HMPA, which correlates with the crystallization kinetics and density of nuclei.

The wet films were coated using a D-bar coater without air-knife blowing and then images were taken by blowing Ar through an air-knife. t0 is the air-blowing start time. 
Since the difference in the nucleation and growth of perovskites depends on Lewis base additives, the underlying Lewis acid–base interaction via an adduct formation is investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 3a and b). In the FTIR spectra in Fig. 3a, the stretching vibrations of SO bonding are compared, where the SO stretching vibration at 1043 cm−1 for bare DMSO shifts to a lower wavenumber of 1020 cm−1 upon forming the PbI2·DMSO adduct. This shift indicates that the strength of the SO bonding is weakened by the interaction of the lone pair of electrons on oxygen with PbI2.39 However, a negligible but slight upward shift to 1024 cm−1 in the SO vibration is observed for the FAI·PbI2·DMSO adduct, which indicates that the FA cation cannot have sufficient interaction with DMSO probably due to the relatively stronger interaction between FAI and PbI2. Based on the degree of change in vibrational energy observed in FTIR, DMSO forms an unstable adduct due to the weak interaction with FAI.24,26 In the case of HMPA in Fig. 3b, the stretching vibration peak of the PO bonding appears at 1203 cm−1 for molecular HMPA,40 which is lowered to 1191 cm−1 and 1182 cm−1 in the presence of PbI2 only, and both FAI and PbI2, respectively. The lowered wavenumber is attributed to the interaction of oxygen in HMPA with PbI2 and/or FA cation. As compared to PbI2·HMPA, the downward shift for the FAI·PbI2·HMPA adduct indicates that HMPA interacts well with the FA cation to form a more stable adduct intermediate. In addition, the higher wavenumber observed for pure HMPA (1203 cm−1) than for pure DMSO (1043 cm−1) implies a stronger force in PO than in SO. Based on the observed stretching vibrational frequency (ν), a force constant (k) for a simple diatomic molecule with atomic masses of m1 and m2 can be estimated using eqn (1),41 (1)where ν, k, c and μ are the frequency in cm−1, the force constant in N m−1, the speed of light and the reduced mass (μ = m1m2/(m1+m2)). The force constant ratio of the SO in DMSO to the PO in HMPA is estimated to be kSO/kPO = 0.656 based on μ(SO) = 12.723 and μ(PO) = 14.571 because m1 = 62.136 (atomic mass of two CH3 and one S) and m2 = 15.999 (one oxygen) for DMSO and m1 = 163.205 (atomic mass of six CH3, three N and one P) and m2 = 15.999 (one oxygen) for HMPA, which indicates that the force constant for the PO bonding is stronger than that for the SO bonding. As compared to the shift in wavenumber from 1043 cm−1 to 1020 cm−1 (Δ = 23 cm−1) for the DMSO·PbI2 adduct, a relatively smaller shift in wavenumber from 1203 cm−1 to 1191 cm−1 (Δ = 12 cm−1) for the adduct formation between HMPA and PbI2 is due to the stronger force constant in the molecular state. The FTIR study reveals that the Lewis acid–base adduct is more stable in the presence of HMPA than in DMSO.

The large-area (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 perovskite films are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL). XRD patterns are compared before and after annealing at 150 °C in Fig. 4a and b. The peaks at 2 thetas lower than 10 degrees observed for the films before annealing in Fig. 4a might be related to the intermediates due to Lewis acid–base interaction,25 (note that pristine perovskite also shows these peaks because the solvent DMF can act as a Lewis base)32,42 where the HMPA-containing sample shows relatively more intense peaks as compared to the DMSO-containing one. This indicates that a highly crystalline adduct is formed in the presence of HMPA, associated with a stronger interaction of FAI and PbI2 with HMPA than with DMSO. The yellow color originates from the as-coated film based on HMPA due to the existence of the intermediate adduct, while the as-coated films without and with DMSO change color from yellow to black as shown in Fig. S2.† This is evidence for the stronger interaction of the perovskite intermediate with HMPA than with DMSO. Despite difference in peak intensity in both intermediate and perovskite phases, no significant difference is observed after annealing as presented in Fig. 4b. The highly intense (h00) planes, observed regardless of Lewis base additives, indicate that the degree of Lewis acid–base interaction does not seem to affect the crystal structure and preferred orientation of cubic phase FAPbI3. Fig. 4c shows the optical absorbance of perovskite films on the FTO/SnO2 substrate. Absorption onset wavelengths are almost identical for all three samples. However, absorption onsets at slightly longer wavelengths for the pristine and DMSO-based perovskite films are attributed to internal light scattering due to the spacing between perovskite crystals as observed in SEM images in Fig. 1d and e.43 The perovskite film formed via the HMPA adduct shows higher absorbance than the pristine and the DMSO-based films, which is due to the compactness of perovskite crystals without voids. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) in Fig. 4d and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) in Fig. 4e confirm that the HMPA-induced FAPbI3 shows the highest PL intensity, underlying improved radiative recombination, and the longest carrier lifetime, indicative of the lowest defect density among the studied samples. The PL decay data in Fig. 4e are fitted using the bi-exponential equation with a fast decay component (τ1) and a slow decay one (τ2) that are related to the trap-mediated non-radiative recombination and the radiative recombination, respectively.44,45 The best fit results are listed in Table S1.† The perovskite films prepared in the presence of the Lewis base additive show longer τ1 values than the pristine perovskite prepared in the absence of the Lewis base additive, which indicates that traps for recombination are lowered by the Lewis base additive method. The longer τ1 of 19.1 ns for HMPA than that of 16.5 ns for DMSO proves that using the HMPA additive is a more effective method to form defect-less perovskites. The average carrier lifetime is estimated to be 125.1 ns, 800.7 ns and 1039.6 ns for the pristine, the DMSO-based perovskite and the HMPA-based perovskite, respectively.

The D-bar coated large-area (4.8 × 9.6 cm2) perovskite film is divided into 8 pieces (2.4 × 2.4 cm2) that are used to make small-area (aperture area of 0.125 cm2) devices. Since the photovoltaic performance may depend on the additive content, we have investigated the dependence of photovoltaic parameters on the DMSO or HMPA contents ranging from 0 mmol to 1 mmol at 0.2 mmol intervals (Fig. S3 and Table S2†). The optimal concentration is determined to be 0.6 mmol for both DMSO and HMPA. For the 0.6 mmol additive concentration, photovoltaic parameters are compared as shown in Fig. 5a–d and the average values are listed in Table 1. The perovskite formed from HMPA shows mean short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of 22.61 ± 0.30 mA cm−2, 1.074 ± 0.028 V and 0.744 ± 0.024, respectively, leading to a PCE of 18.07 ± 0.81%, whereas the DMSO-induced perovskite delivers a relatively lower PCE of 15.18 ± 1.39% due to a lower Jsc of 21.83 ± 0.78 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.047 ± 0.031 and FF of 0.664 ± 0.050. The better photovoltaic performance is attributed to the pinhole-free homogeneous morphology and longer carrier lifetime of the HMPA-induced perovskite film. Without the Lewis base additive, a poor PCE of 7.50 ± 2.57% is measured due to the extremely low Voc of 0.772 ± 0.126 V and FF of 0.468 ± 0.082 along with the reduced Jsc of 20.23 ± 0.64 mA cm−2, which results basically from very poor film quality. When comparing the photovoltaic performances of HMPA and DMSO, the overall efficiency seems to be influenced by the FF. Thus, resistances and ideality factor are estimated from the dark J–V curves. The series resistance (Rs), shunt resistance (Rsh), saturation current (J0), and ideality factor (n) are listed in Table 2, where the Rs and Rsh were calculated from the inverse of the slope near the short- and open-circuit regions. J0 and n are obtained by linear fitting of the data with a diode eqn (2),46 (2)where JD is the dark current density, J0 is the saturation current, q is the electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and Vb is the bias voltage. The device with the HMPA-induced perovskite exhibits lower Rs (29.8 Ω cm2) and higher Rsh (5.72 × 105 Ω cm2) than the device with the DMSO-induced perovskite (Rs = 35.7 Ω cm2, Rsh = 3.98 × 104 Ω cm2), which is responsible for the higher FF in the case of HMPA. In addition, the lower J0 of 1.67 × 10−13 mA cm−2 for HMPA compared to the value of 1.81 ×10−10 for DMSO contributes in part to the higher Voc.47,48

Fig. 6a–c demonstrate the J–V curve, steady-state efficiency, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best performing device employing (FAPbI3)0.875(CsPbBr3)0.125 perovskite prepared from the HMPA-containing precursor solution. The forward and reverse J–V curves in Fig. 6a result in a PCE of 19.38% (Jsc = 22.89 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.101 V, and FF = 0.769) and 19.58% (Jsc = 22.90 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.119 V, and FF = 0.764), respectively. The steady-state current density and PCE are measured at a constant bias voltage of 0.935 V, which leads to 20.5 mA cm−2 and 19.2% (Fig. 6b). The EQE in Fig. 6c shows a plateau structure in the entire wavelength and the integrated Jsc based on the EQE data is estimated to be 21.52 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the measured Jsc. Finally, we fabricate a mini-module (5 × 5 cm2) comprising 10 sub-cells connected in series, as shown in Fig. 6d. The fabrication process and the structure of the mini-module are schematically illustrated in Fig. S4a and b.† The photovoltaic parameters of the mini-module based on the HMPA-induced perovskite film are compared with those of the DMSO-induced one (Table S3†). Although the standard deviation is as large as 2.39 and 1.92 in the PCE values for the DMSO-based and the HMPA-based mini-module, respectively, the average PCE of 14.71% for the HMPA-based module is higher than that of 11.89% for the DMSO-based one, as expected. The best PCE of 17.01% is achieved at reverse scan from the mini-module employing the D-bar coated perovskite film via the HMPA adduct intermediate as shown in Fig. 6e. The active area of the 5 × 5 cm2 module is estimated to be 18.66 cm2 due to the dead area owing to the P1, P2 and P3 etched lines in Fig. S4c.† From the current work, we found the importance of the role of the Lewis base additive for the upscaling process, which may be extended to other topics such as ETL/perovskite interface engineering,51,52 perovskite growth,53 composition optimization,54 and perovskite/HTL interface engineering.55

Conclusion
We have successfully demonstrated an efficient approach for the scalable fabrication of high-quality FA-based perovskite films via Lewis base additive engineering. From the comparative study between DMSO and HMPA Lewis base additives, formation of a stable adduct intermediate was found to be of critical importance to yield a homogeneous and fully covered perovskite layer on the large-area substrate during air-knife assisted D-bar coating. HMPA produced a more stable adduct intermediate than DMSO, which eventually led to a dense and pinhole-free perovskite film. As a result, the best performing mini-module exhibited a PCE of 17.01% with a Voc of 10.8 V at reverse scan. This work can give a clue and important insights into high efficiency large-area FA-based PSCs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of HC(NH2)2I
Formamidinium iodide (FAI, HC(NH2)2I) was synthesized by reacting 15 g of formamidinium acetate (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) with 25 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h in an ice bath. The dark yellow precipitate was dried using a rotary evaporator at 65 °C and washed three times using diethyl ether. The collected powder was recrystallized by dissolving in ethanol and adding diethyl ether. The recrystallized white precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h, which was stored in an Ar filled glove box.
Synthesis of yellow delta phase HC(NH2)2PbI3
The yellow powder of delta phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3, HC(NH2)2PbI3) was synthesized by reacting the synthesized FAI with low grade PbI2 (95%, Kanto Chemical Co.), according to the method reported elsewhere.49,50 4.61 g of PbI2 was reacted with 2.236 g of the synthesized FAI in acetonitrile (ACN) for 48 h, by which the yellow precipitate was collected, washed in ACN three times and dried in a vacuum oven.
Solar cell fabrication
FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) of dimension 4.8 × 9.6 cm2 was cleaned using a detergent and by ultra-sonication in ethanol for 40 min. The substrate was treated using a UV/ozone (UVO) cleaner for 60 min. The SnO2 colloid solution (15 wt% in H2O, Alfa Aesar) was diluted to 4 wt%, which was spin-coated on the cleaned substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s and annealed on the hot plate at 185 °C for 30 min in air. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 553.8 mg of the synthesized yellow FAPbI3 powder, 26.6 mg of CsBr (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich), 45.8 mg of PbBr2 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), and 20.4 mg of MACl (99.99%, Sigma Aldrich) in 700 μL of N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, >99.8% anhydrous, Sigma Aldrich), without and with a Lewis base N,N′-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). For the Lewis base additive, 0.6 mmol DMSO (99.9% anhydrous, 42.6 μL Sigma Aldrich) or 0.6 mmol HMPA (99%, 104.4 μL, Sigma Aldrich) was included in the precursor solution. The SnO2-coated FTO substrate was treated again with UVO for 4 min prior to perovskite coating. The perovskite solution was coated using a D-bar coater at a speed of 5 mm s−1. The gap between the D-bar and the substrate was kept at 70 μm using polyimide tape. Ar gas was blown at a pressure of 2 MPa through an air-knife during the coating to evaporate the solvent. The as-coated substrate was immediately transferred to a hot plate and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. A 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) layer was spin-coated on the annealed perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s using the spiro-MeOTAD solution prepared by mixing 90.9 mg of spiro-MeOTAD, 20.9 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (540 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL ACN), and 35.5 mL 4-tert-butylpyridine in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, an Au electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator at 0.3 Å s−1 for 200 nm.
Mini-module fabrication
For series connection of each cell in the mini-module, P1, P2, and P3 were patterned using a laser etching system with a 1080 nm laser (μ-Lab, Germany). The FTO glass (8.8 cm × 7.4 cm) was pre-patterned for P1 by means of 80% of laser power with a frequency of 100 kHz and pulse width of 10 μs. The P1-patterned FTO glass was cleaned with a detergent and by ultra-sonication in ethanol for 40 min, which was followed by depositing the SnO2 layer, the perovskite film, and the spiro-MeOTAD layer sequentially. The P2 line was then patterned, after which the Au layer was deposited and then the P3 line was formed. For the P3 pattern, the laser power was reduced significantly to 7% without changing the frequency and pulse width. At the same time, both sides should be etched for isolation between sub-cells.
Characterization
The surface images of perovskite films were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600, JEOL). The images depending on the air-blowing time were observed using an optical microscope (OM, G1-99bi). The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were measured using a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer with attenuated total reflection (ATR). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films were investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (Smartlab SE, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 4° min−1. The absorbance was measured by using a UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda 45, PerkinElmer). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a Quantaurus-Tau compact fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367, Hamamatsu) using a 464 nm wavelength laser source with 10 MHz frequency of laser pulse. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured using a time-correlated single photon counting system (FluoTim 200, PicoQuant) with 50 kHz repetition rate. A 640 nm laser was used for carrier excitation and the emitted PL was collected using a photon multiplier tube detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant-GmbH) at 770 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, class AAA) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6280NS). The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The dark J–V was measured with the same system under dark conditions. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) system (PV measurement Inc.) was utilized with a monochromatic beam generated from a 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan).
