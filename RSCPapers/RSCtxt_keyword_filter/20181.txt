    , Accepted 27th February 2017First published on 27th February 2017AbstractWe have designed and synthesized ferrocenyl (donor) bisthiazole linked triphenylamine (donor) based donor–π–acceptor–π–donor–acceptor (D–π–A)2–π–D–A type dyes D1 and D2 by using Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Their photophysical, electrochemical and computational studies reveal strong donor–acceptor interaction. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on D1 and D2 exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6.33% and 5.03%, respectively. The higher PCE value of the D1 based DSSC is attributed to its enhanced short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit current (Voc) and fill factor (FF) values because of the strong binding of the anchoring cyanoacrylic acid with the TiO2 surface as compared to the dicyanovinyl unit in D2. Time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations at B3LYP level on dyes D1 and D2 were performed, which reveal that both dyes show HOMO−1 → LUMO as a major transition. Computational photovoltaic calculations also reveal that dye D1 has better electron injection (ΔGinject) from ELUMO to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 as compared to dye D2, which is in good agreement with experimental results.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted enormous attention from the scientific community1 for the past two decades due to their advantages, such as providing lightweight colored and flexible devices with certified power conversion efficiencies of 11.4%2 and 14.3%.3 One of the key components in the DSSC is the sensitizer which controls light harvesting and charge separation.4,5 DSSCs based on metal containing sensitizers, including ruthenium dyes,6,7 Zn-porphyrins,8,9 and perovskites,10,11 have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) so far, but their practical uses are still limited due to their high cost, scarcity and environmental problems. However, the use of metal free organic dyes as sensitizers is fascinating because of their easier synthetic routes and versatile structure tallying with energy levels, along with superior light harvesting ability due to their high absorption coefficients.12–14
The structure of the organic dyes plays a key role in perturbing their optical and electrochemical properties and hence the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs to induce effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) for charge separation. The concept of donor–(π–bridge)–acceptor (D–π–A) has been widely exploited, offering molecules capable of absorbing a wide range of the solar spectrum.15,16 Organic dyes with triphenylamine (TPA) donors with different π-conjugated linkers, including aromatic and heteroaromatics and cyanoacrylic acid as anchor/acceptor, are promising to attain better DSSC performance.17–20 Moreover, as Diau et al. have reported, push–pull type porphyrin dyes incorporating ethynyl units in their backbone can effectively promote strong coupling at the interface of TiO2 and broaden the light harvesting region, resulting in better photovoltaic performances.21
Ferrocene based molecular systems exhibit interesting optical and electrochemical properties and have been explored as donor units in the sensitizers for DSSCs.22 Singh et al. have used some ferrocene based dithiocarbamate sensitizers for DSSCs.10,11,23 Recently, the same research group reported on ferrocenyl bearing Ni(II) and Cu(II) dithiocarbamates in DSSCs and achieved a PCE of 3.87%.24
We are interested in exploiting ferrocene as an antenna in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The choice of using ferrocene derivatives as sensitizers is due to their well-defined reversible redox process and strong electron donating properties. Recently we have used two ferrocenyl substituted triphenylamine based donor–acceptor dyes as sensitizers and achieved an overall PCE of 4.96%.25 In order to increase the efficiency of DSSC in ferrocene based dyes, we have designed and synthesized triphenylamine linked ferrocenyl bisthiazole based donor–acceptor dyes D1 and D2. The DSSCs fabricated with D1 and D2 as sensitizers showed overall PCEs of 6.33% and 5.03%, respectively. The higher PCE for D1 may be attributed to the strong binding of the anchoring cyanoacrylic acid with the TiO2 surface as compared to the dicyanovinyl unit in D2.
Results and discussion
The ferrocenyl bisthiazole linked triphenylamine based donor–acceptor dyes D1 and D2 were synthesized by the Suzuki cross-coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The starting materials 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dibutyl-2,2′-bisthiazole (a)26 and 4-(bis(4-ethynylphenyl)amino)benzaldehyde (c)27 were synthesized by the reported procedures (Schemes S1 and S2, ESI†). The 5-bromo-4,4′-dihexyl-5′-(ferrocenylethynyl)-2,2′-bithiazole (1) was synthesized by Sonogashira cross-coupling of 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dibutyl-2,2′-bisthiazole (a) and ethnyl ferrocene (b) which resulted in mono-substituted ferrocenyl bisthiazole (1) at 50% (Scheme S3, ESI†). Compound 2 was synthesized by the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of 5-bromo-4,4′-dihexyl-5′-(ferrocenylethynyl)-2,2′-bithiazole (1) with 4-(bis(4-ethynylphenyl)amino)benzaldehyde which resulted in compound 2 with 62% yield. The dyes D1 and D2 were synthesized by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 2 with cyanoacetic acid and malononitrile in dichloromethane and acetic acid mixture (1:1 ratio) in the presence of NH4OAc which resulted in D1 and D2 with yields of 72% and 75%, respectively (Scheme 1). All the compounds were well characterized by 1H,13C-NMR, and HRMS techniques.

Photophysical properties
The electronic absorption spectrum of D1 and D2 in dilute dichloromethane (DCM) solution is shown in Fig. 1 and the data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1, both D1 and D2 exhibited similar absorption profiles with two distinct bands. The major absorption bands at 423 nm and 426 nm of dyes D1 and D2 are attributed to mixed ICT/π–π* transition of the chromophores, which was further confirmed by TD-DFT calculations. The optical absorption spectra of dyes on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 1a and b (red colour). The absorption peaks are red-shifted and broadened as compared to those in solution and are located at 484 nm and 492 nm for D1 and D2, respectively. The broadening of the absorption spectra is a result of the interaction between TiO2 and the sensitizers, and is beneficial for light harvesting.27

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the ferrocenyl bisthiazole linked triphenylamine based donor–acceptor dyes D1 and D2 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement. The electrochemical data of dyes D1 and D2 are listed in Table 1, and the representative cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The cyclic voltammograms (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†) of dyes D1 and D2 show two oxidation waves and one reversible reduction wave. The first reversible oxidation wave belongs to the ferrocene unit and the second quasi-reversible oxidation wave corresponds to the triphenylamine unit. The reduction wave corresponds to the bithiazole group. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the dyes were estimated from the onset oxidation potential (Eoxonset) i.e. HOMO = q(Eoxonset + 4.8) eV and are shown in Table 1. The HOMO energy levels for both the dyes (−4.95 eV and −4.96 for D1 and D2, respectively) are more negative than the iodide/triiodide redox potential (−4.8 eV), indicating that the dye generation in DSSCs may be readily proceed by electron transfer from the redox solution. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are estimated from the onset reduction potential (Eredonset) LUMO = q(Eredonset + 4.8) eV LUMO = −q(Ered + 4.8) eV and are shown in Table 1. The LUMO energy levels are −3.51 eV and −3.56 eV for D1 and D2, respectively, and are higher than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−4.2 eV), indicating there is sufficient driving force for electron injection from the excited dye to the TiO2.
Theoretical calculations
In order to understand the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the ferrocenyl bisthiazole linked triphenylamine based donor–acceptor dyes D1 and D2, density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional (TD-DFT) calculations were performed. The structures of dye D1 and D2 were optimized by DFT in B3LYP/6-31G** and photophysical properties were studied by TD-DFT in dichloromethane solvent (CPCM model) using Gaussian 09 at the CAM-B3LYP for C, H, N, S, O and Lanl2DZ for the Fe level.28 The optimized geometry structures of D1 and D2 are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
The TD-DFT predicted vertical excitation energies for dyes D1 and D2 are shown in Fig. 2, along with individual experimental UV-vis spectra. The major intense transitions in dyes D1 and D2 are mixed ICT/π–π* in nature. The strong absorption bands calculated at the CAM-B3LYP level are at 424 nm and 423 nm, respectively. The experimental values for these transitions are 426 nm, 429 nm, respectively, which show good agreement with the experimental values.

The predicted vertical transitions and oscillator strengths in dyes D1 and D2 are listed in Table 2. In dyes D1 and D2 the transitions are dominated by a HOMO−1 → LUMO transition 21%, 16% and oscillator strengths are 3.3863, 3.403, respectively (Table 2). The absorption band calculated (CAM-B3LYP) in this region (424 nm, 423 nm) (also shown in Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†) confirms that the molecular orbitals (MOs) associated with these transitions are ferrocene (donor) to acrylic acid (acceptor) and are attributed to a mixed ICT/π–π* transition from HOMO−1 → LUMO, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†).

Theoretical photovoltaic calculations
The theoretical values of HOMO, HOMO−1 and LUMO energy levels for D1 are shown in Fig. 3 and the HOMO and HOMO−1 energy levels are almost the same. In DSSCs, the HOMO to LUMO or HOMO−1 to LUMO transitions are not important. Only the binding of dye with the TiO2 surface and electron injection from the LUMO of the dye into TiO2 are important.29 The HOMO energy levels of these dyes D1 and D2 are more negative compared to the redox potential of the electrolyte I3− and also the LUMO energy levels of these dyes are more positive than the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.2 eV), which is desirable for photoelectron injection. The electron injection is possible by both dyes D1 and D2 as the LUMOs of both dyes are above the CB of TiO2, as shown in Fig. 4.

The photovoltaic applications of dyes D1 and D2 were studied by using DFT and TD-DFT theory. The power conversion efficiency (η) was calculated according to eqn (1):30 (1)where Pin is the incident power density, Jsc is the short-circuit current, Voc is the open-circuit current, and FF denotes the fill factor.
The theoretical values of open-circuit Voc were calculated from the following eqn (2). These values are sufficient for a possible efficient electron injection. Dyes D1 and D2 show good open-circuit in TiO2 (Table 2). As per the calculation, dye D2 has more open-circuit current compared to dye D1 due to the lower HOMO level.31 Voc = |EHOMO(donor or dye)| − |ELUMO(acceptor) of TiO2| − 0.3(2)The short-circuit current (Jsc) in solar applications is determined by the following eqn (3). (3)where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, ϕinj is the electron injection efficiency and ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency. In this ηcoll is a constant. As a result, the enhancement of Jsc should focus on improving the LHE and ϕinj. In eqn (2) if LHE is directly proportional to Jsc, then Jsc also increased. From eqn (4), we have calculated the light harvesting efficiencies (LHE) of dyes D1 and D2, in which both dyes show same LHE values (Table 2).31 LHE = 1 − 10−f(4)where f is the oscillator strength of the dye corresponding to λmax, ϕinject is the electron injection efficiency, and ηcollect is the charge collection efficiency. It is reasonable to assume that ηcollect is constant for the same DSSC with only the dyes being different. ϕinject is related to the free energy of electron injection (ΔGinject) and is expressed by the following eqn (5) ϕinj ∝ f(ΔGinj)(5)Therefore, the more negative ΔGinj, the greater will be the electron injection efficiency. ΔGinj can be calculated as the difference between the excited state oxidation potential () of the dye and the ground state reduction potential (ECB) and ΔE stands for the electronic vertical transition energy associated with the λmax (Table 3).32 (6) (7)The theoretical values of Edyeox for D1 and D2 are −5.29 eV and −5.39 eV, respectively, whereas the values of ΔE for D1 and D2 are 2.91 eV and 2.89 eV for D1 and D2, respectively.

Overall theoretical DSSc calculation reveals that the open-circuit (Voc) and light harvesting efficiencies (LHE) of dyes D1 and D2 show almost the same performance. But the key parameter of electron injection ΔGinj from ELUMO of dye to CB of TiO2 is more flexible in the case of dye D1 (−1.83) as compared to dye D2 (−1.70) (Fig. 4), which is in good agreement with experimental results.
Experimental photovoltaic properties
We have fabricated DSSCs based on these two dyes as sensitizers. The electrolyte is composed of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium/0.05 M I2/0.1 M LiI and the effective cell area was 0.16 cm2. TiO2 electrodes were sensitized with 0.1 mM dye solution for 12 hours. First of all we fabricated the DSSCs by dipping the photoanode in a pristine dye solution, but the overall PCE was very low, in the range of 2.5%, which may be due to an aggregation problem. Therefore, Co-adsorption with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was also examined to prevent aggregation of the dyes on TiO2. The current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under the illumination of stimulated AM1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) and are shown in Fig. 5a and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 4.

DSSC sensitized with D1 showed an overall PCE of 6.33% with Jsc of 11.56 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.74 and FF of 0.74. However, the D2 sensitized DSSC exhibit a lower PCE of 5.03%, with Jsc of 9.98 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.69 V and FF of 0.72. Since the molecular structures of both D1 and D2 are the same except for the anchoring units, the difference in the photovoltaic parameters may be related to the strength of binding of the dyes with the TiO2 surface.
As shown in Fig. 5b, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum for D1 based DSSC showed higher values of IPCEs throughout the entire wavelength regions than that for the D2 counterpart. The IPCE value is given by IPCE = LHE × ϕinj × ϕreg × ηcc, where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency of the DSSC, given by LHE = 1 − 10−A, A is the absorbance of the photoanode which is same as the oscillator strength, ϕinj and ϕreg are the electron injection and regeneration efficiencies, respectively, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency. The value of LHE for D1 (1.06) is higher than that for D2 (0.98), since the absorbance of D1 is larger than that for D2. The value of LHE is important for the overall value of Jsc. The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra of the DSSCs are about 11.47 mA cm−2 and 9.84 mA cm−2 for D1 and D2, respectively. The lower values of Jsc and FF for the D2 based DSSCs may be related to the inefficient adsorption of dye on the TiO2 surface because of the presence of the DCV anchoring unit, which directly influences the electron injection.33
On the one hand, the theoretical HOMO and LUMO values of both the dyes support our experimental results. On the other hand, disagreement in the computed Voc trends as compared to the experimental evidence arises because in computed open-circuit current (Voc) properties the dye D2 shows a higher value compared to dye D1.
In the case of experimental Voc values, dye D1 shows a higher value compared to dye D2 because dye D1 shows good binding (cyanoacetic acid group) affinity with the TiO2 surface as compared to dye D2 (malono nitrile group). For this reason the experimental open-circuit current (Voc) of dye D1 is high. Moreover, we cannot compare experimental open-circuit current (Voc) and computed open-circuit current (Voc) because the theoretical calculation of the binding affinity of dyes D1 and D2 with TiO2 is difficult.
Nyquist and Bode spectra are measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in dark conditions under a forward bias −0.70 V, to get information about the interfacial charge transfer processes at the interfaces in the DSSCs, such as charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, electron transport in the TiO2 electrode, and I3− transport in the electrolyte.33 The Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots for the DSSCs sensitized with D1 and D2 are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. The semicircle observed in the middle frequency range of the Nyquist plots (Fig. 6a) is proportional to the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. It can be seen that the Rct is higher for the D1 based DSSC compared to the D2 counterpart. The DSSC with larger Rct can suppress the charge recombination and reduce the dark current and thereby improve the Voc.34 Therefore, the larger value of Rct for D1 sensitized DSSC reflects the slower rate of recombination of injected photoelectrons in TiO2 with I3− species which can be attributed to the greater amount of dye loading. The lower frequency peak in the Bode plot (Fig. 6b) implies a longer lifetime (τe) of the injected electron in TiO2 according to the relation τe = 1/(2πf) (f is the peak frequency of lower-frequency range in Bode plots). A longer electron lifetime corresponds to a lower dark current. The DSSC based on D1 has the longer electron lifetime, which implies the most effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in an improvement in the Voc, although its HOMO energy level is lower than that for D2.

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized triphenylamine linked ferrocenyl bisthiazole based donor–acceptor dyes D1 and D2 and applied them as sensitizers for DSSCs. The effects of acrylic acid and malononitrile acceptor groups on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated. The computational properties also reveal that both dyes (D1 and D2) have ferrocene (donor) to acceptor intramolecular charge transfer transitions (HOMO−1 → LUMO). The DSSC based on dye D1 yielded a PCE of 6.33% while dye D2 showed a PCE of 5.03%. The Jsc of dye D1 is greater than that of dye D2 which can be attributed to the broader absorption profile of dye D1 and it has a promising value of IPCE compared to dye D2.
Experimental section
General experimental
All reagents were obtained from commercial sources, and used as received unless otherwise stated. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance (III) 400 MHz instrument by using CDCl3 as solvent. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the solvent residual peak (CDCl3, 7.26 ppm). Multiplicities are given as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), dd (doublet of doublets), and m (multiplet), and the coupling constants, J, are given in Hz. 13C NMR chemical shifts are reported relative to the solvent residual peak (CDCl3, 77.36 ppm). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary-100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on a CHI620D electrochemical analyzer using glassy carbon as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. A solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in CH2Cl2 (0.1 M) was employed as the supporting electrolyte. DCM was freshly distilled from CaH2 prior to use. All potentials were experimentally referenced against the saturated calomel electrode couple but were then manipulated to be referenced against Fc/Fc+ as recommended by IUPAC. Under our conditions, the Fc/Fc+ couple exhibited E° = 0.38 V versus SCE. HRMS was recorded on a Bruker-Daltonics micrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer.
Device fabrication and characterization
The fabrication of DSSC as well as the TiO2 photoanodes and counter electrodes were carried out following our earlier work.25 The thickness of the TiO2 electrode is 12–13 μm. Each dye was dissolved in a mixture of DCM:EtOH (1:1) with 20 mM CDCA which was used as the sensitized solution with a concentration of 5 × 10−4 M. The prepared TiO2 photoanodes were dipped into the dye solution for 12 h, rinsed with ethanol and dried in ambient conditions. The redox electrolyte used for the DSSCs and device characterization are as reported in our earlier communication.25
