    , Accepted 22nd March 2022First published on 23rd March 2022AbstractThree nonfullerene acceptors with different aryl-substituted terminal groups were designed and synthesized. The optimal device obtained a PCE of 11.42%, with a nonradiative energy loss ≤0.16 eV. Non-rigid π-extension of terminal groups is proved to be a feasible strategy to modulate the molecular packing behaviour and reduce nonradiative recombination loss.
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous attention over the past few decades, owing to their potential advantages for large-area production, flexible and wearable devices, and semitransparent photovoltaic applications.1–3 Driven by the continuous innovation of active layer materials, especially the non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with tunable energy levels and absorption spectrum,4 the optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NFA-based OSCs has exceeded 18%.5 However, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) values in most of the high-performance OSCs are still limited to 0.8–0.9 V,5,6 which is lagging behind those of the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (>1.1 V).7,8 The comparably low Voc is mainly due to the high energy loss (Eloss) (typically ∼ 0.6 eV) originating from strong radiative and nonradiative recombination loss in OSCs, which is 0.2–0.3 eV higher than that for inorganic or perovskite solar cells.9 Based on the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) detailed-balance theory, the radiative recombination of carriers is inevitable due to the equilibrium between absorption and emission processes. Thus, the additional nonradiative loss (generally >0.20 eV) constitutes a prominent part of the large energy losses in OSCs. In order to further enhance the photovoltaic performance, suppressing the nonradiative recombination loss has been recognized as a crucial approach to increasing the Voc in OSCs.
The high nonradiative loss in OSCs corresponds to a low electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of about 10−5.9 Previous studies have suggested that increasing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the blend films could enhance EQEEL and thus reduce the nonradiative loss of OSCs.10,11 Considering the impact of molecular packing on the solid-state PLQY, terminal group modification with large substitutes is a potential strategy to enhance the PLQY of active layer materials. Liu et al.12 reported that introducing phenyl substituents to the planar core could modulate the molecular packing behaviour, which contributes to attenuating fluorescence quenching induced by the strong aggregation of organic semiconductors in the solid state, leading to a high PLQY. Lu et al.13 demonstrated that the introduction of 3D terminal groups for NFAs could avoid forming extravagant aggregation in the blend films, giving an increase in PLQY. Additionally, decreasing the energetic offset between donor and acceptor materials is another possible method to reduce nonradiative loss.11 Recent studies have shown that expanding the π-conjugation of terminal groups could increase the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of acceptors, leading to a small HOMO offset and high Voc for OSCs.14,15 Therefore, rational design of NFAs via terminal group modification plays a key role in minimizing nonradiative loss of OSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized three novel nonfullerene acceptors by extending the π-conjugation of Y5 with aryl-substituted terminal groups (phenyl, naphthyl, and thienyl), named BTP-C9-ICX (X = B, N, and T) (Fig. 1a). Different electron-donating aromatic substituents were substituted on the 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) terminal group through a single bond, which can simultaneously tune the energy levels and regulate the molecular packing of acceptors. Compared with Y5, BTP-C9-ICX showed lower nonradiative energy loss of about 0.15 eV (0.18 eV for Y5 system) with PM6 as the donor. Due to the better charge transport properties, the optimized PM6:BTP-C9-ICT-based device exhibited a simultaneous improvement in Jsc and FF, achieving a PCE of 11.42%. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the best PCEs among OSCs with a nonradiative energy loss ≤0.16 eV.

The synthetic route of these three small molecule acceptors is depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The target molecules were synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of compound 3 (electron-withdrawing terminal groups) and compound 4 in a high yield over 85%. These three acceptors can be readily dissolved in common solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran, which is beneficial for solution processing of devices. The detailed synthesis processes, purification methods, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data are provided in the ESI.† Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level were employed to investigate how the aromatic substituents affect the molecular geometries. For simplicity, all the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the dihedral angle between the IC unit and the introduced thienyl substituent is 21.52° in BTP-C9-ICT, whereas the dihedral angles for BTP-C9-ICB with a phenyl group and BTP-C9-ICN with a naphthyl group are 35.74° and 52.03°, respectively. These twist angles could modulate the molecular packing behaviour of acceptors, which is beneficial to suppressing the fluorescence quenching in the solid state.16
The UV-vis absorption spectra of these molecules and the blend with PM6 were measured in dilute CF solutions and films (Fig. 1b, c, Fig. S2a and Table S1, ESI†). The three acceptors possess almost identical absorption profiles in solution with the maximum absorption peak located at around 730 nm due to their similar molecular backbone. From solution to the film state, the absorption peaks exhibit a significant redshift of 72 nm, 60 nm, and 59 nm for BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, and BTP-C9-ICT, respectively, indicating strong intermolecular π–π interaction in the films. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these materials in the film state were also measured to investigate their emission properties (Fig. S2b and c, ESI†). Comparing the absorption and PL spectra, BTP-C9-ICX exhibits significantly smaller Stokes shift (Δλ) values than Y5 (Δλ = 109, 102, 71 and 167 for BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, BTP-C9-ICT, and Y5, respectively), indicating that the reorganization energy and energy level disorder are reduced by introducing aryl substituents, which is of benefit to the mitigation of energy loss.17
The energy levels of these molecules were determined via the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. S3, ESI†). These acceptors possess similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels (Fig. 1d), which were well matched with the widely used polymer donor, PM6 (−5.45/−3.49 eV). Notably, the aryl-substitution strategy could increase the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the acceptors compared with Y5, realizing small HOMO offsets between the donor PM6 and the three acceptors, which is beneficial for reducing nonradiative loss.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of these three acceptors, conventional devices were fabricated with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al, where PM6 was used as the donor. After the optimization for fabrication conditions (Table S2, ESI†), the optimal PM6:BTP-C9-ICT-based device obtained a maximum PCE of 11.42%, with a Voc of 0.99 V, Jsc of 17.49 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.95%, whereas the BTP-C9-ICB and BTP-C9-ICN-based devices showed a comparable PCE of 6.88% and 7.76% (Table 1 and Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S4a, b ESI†). Significantly, the BTP-C9-ICX systems achieved a higher Voc than that of the Y5 system (0.98 V for the BTP-C9-ICB-based device; 1.00 V for the BTP-C9-ICN-based device; 0.95 V for the Y5-based device), indicating that the aryl substitution for the acceptors could increase the Voc of OSCs, which will be further analysed by energy loss calculations. The best efficiency for the BTP-C9-ICT-based devices is mainly due to the simultaneous improvement in Jsc and FF. The higher Jsc is also reflected in the EQE spectra. The BTP-C9-ICT-based device exhibited a stronger spectral response from 400 to 800 nm, implying better light utilization and more efficient exciton separation. The Jsc values calculated by integrating the EQE curves matched well with the values obtained from the J–V curves (within 5% error). In addition, the charge carrier mobility measurements (Fig. S5a, b and Table S3, ESI†) indicated that PM6:BTP-C9-ICT blend film possessed more efficient and balanced charge transport, leading to the enhancement in FF.

To assess the charge generation ability in these devices, the correlation of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured (Fig. 2c). Under short-circuit condition, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) of the BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, and BTP-C9-ICT-based devices was 84.8%, 85.2%, and 91.7%, respectively. The BTP-C9-ICT-based device showed the highest exciton dissociation ability, suggesting that more efficient charge generation occurred in the PM6:BTP-C9-ICT system. The J–V characteristics under various light intensities (Plight) were measured subsequently to further investigate the charge recombination mechanism in the OSCs. The relationship between Voc and Plight follows the formula Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge. As shown in Fig. 2d, the slope values of the BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, and BTP-C9-ICT-based devices were 1.15, 1.18, and 1.13kT/q, respectively, indicating that the BTP-C9-ICT-based device had slightly smaller trap-assisted recombination loss.18 Furthermore, the α value determined by the formula: Jsc ∝ Pαlight can describe the degree of bimolecular recombination loss.19 All the devices showed an α value close to 1 (Fig. S4f, ESI†), suggesting that these devices possessed negligible bimolecular recombination.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to explore the molecular stacking of the active layers (Fig. 3a–c and Fig. S6a–i, ESI†). All the BTP-C9-ICX-based films showed a predominant face-on orientation, providing efficient vertical charge transport channels between the anode and cathode. The d-spacing (010) values for the BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, and BTP-C9-ICT pure films were estimated to be 3.76, 3.78, and 3.67 Å, respectively, demonstrating that the BTP-C9-ICT film had slightly tighter π–π stacking. Furthermore, the crystalline coherence lengths (CCLs) of the (010) peaks in the OOP direction were estimated to be 30.40, 26.18, 25.36, and 28.17 Å for the Y5, BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, and BTP-C9-ICT-based blend films, respectively (Table S4, ESI†), indicating that aryl-substituted terminal groups could obviously affect the crystallization ability of the acceptors, which could be related to their different twist angles obtained by DFT calculations. These observations indicated that moderate crystallinity was formed in the PM6:BTP-C9-ICT blend films by the introduction of thienyl substituents, which is conducive to charge transport and obtain high Jsc and FF.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out to further investigate the surface morphology of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 3d–f, all the blend films exhibited distinct fibrous nanostructures, which is beneficial for exciton separation and charge transport. The BTP-C9-ICT blend film showed a smoother surface with a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 1.19 nm, which could be attributed to its appropriate crystallinity, avoiding the formation of excessive aggregation domains. Therefore, the optimized morphology could induce better contact between the active layer and the interlayer, which provided an efficient charge transport channel, leading to higher FF. Additionally, contact angle measurements (Fig. S7 and Table S5, ESI†) indicate that BTP-C9-ICT is more miscible with donor PM6, contributing to the favourable phase separation.
In order to explore the origin of the high Voc of the BTP-C9-ICX systems, we analysed the energy loss for the optimized OSCs. Based on Shockley–Queisser limit theory, the Eloss in the OSCs originates from three parts (Fig. 4a and Table S6, ESI†), which could be determined by the methods summarized in the ESI.† The first part (ΔE1) depends on the bandgap, which was identical (0.27 eV) for these four systems due to their similar Eg. The second part (ΔE2) is the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap, owing to the non-step absorptance for practical solar cells, which was calculated to be 0.07–0.10 eV for these systems. The last part (ΔE3) is the nonradiative recombination loss, which can be calculated by measuring the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency. The EQEEL values were estimated to be 3.42 × 10−3, 2.53 × 10−3, and 2.90 × 10−3 for the BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, and BTP-C9-ICT-based systems, respectively (Fig. S8a, ESI†), corresponding to lower ΔE3 values (about 0.15 eV) than that of the Y5-based system (0.18 eV). Considering the relationship between PLQY and EQEEL,10 we measured the PLQYs of these materials (Table S7, ESI†). The PLQY values for the BTP-C9-ICX-based systems were consistent with their larger EQEEL values, demonstrating that the aryl-substitution strategy for acceptors could effectively suppress the fluorescence quenching. However, an undesirable steric hindrance may diminish the charge transport efficiency, which affects the device performance. These results reveal that the introduction of substituents with moderate steric hindrance would contribute to enhancing the PLQY of the acceptors and keeping efficient charge transport, which is of great importance to balance the Eloss and PCE values. Significantly, PM6:BTP-C9-ICT-based OSCs concurrently achieve efficiency of 11.42% and considerably low nonradiative energy loss of 0.15 eV, which is one of the highest PCEs for OSCs with ΔE3 ≤0.16 V to date (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the low energy loss for the BTP-C9-ICT-based system inspired us to use it as the third component in a PM6:Y6-based high-efficiency system, achieving an improved PCE (16.59% vs. 15.80%). The detailed photovoltaic performance of ternary device are shown in Fig. S8b–e and Table S9, ESI.†

In summary, three nonfullerene acceptors BTP-C9-ICB, BTP-C9-ICN, and BTP-C9-ICT with different aryl substituents (phenyl, naphthyl, or thienyl) at the IC terminal group were synthesized and characterized. All the systems achieved low nonradiative energy loss of 0.15 eV with PM6 as the donor. DFT calculations indicated that the aryl substitution could induce different twist angles between the IC terminal group and the adjacent aryl group. GIWAXS and AFM characterizations showed that BTP-C9-ICT with a small twist angle exhibited favourable molecular packing and moderate crystallinity, leading to high PLQY and efficient charge transport. Due to the simultaneous increase in Jsc and FF, the optimal PM6:BTP-C9-ICT-based device obtained a PCE of 11.42%, to the best of our knowledge, which is one of the best PCEs for OSCs with a nonradiative energy loss ≤0.16 eV. These results demonstrated that non-rigid π-extension of terminal groups is a feasible strategy to modulate the aggregation behaviour of blend films and reduce the nonradiative recombination loss, which is of great significance for developing high-performance OSCs with low energy losses.
