To date, most research studies concerning OPVs have been focused on improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and device stability. However, the state-of-the-art OPV cells especially with high PCEs are processed by highly toxic halogenated solvents.

1. Introduction
Recently, organic photovoltaics (OPVs), as a promising green energy-generating technology, have attracted considerable interest, primarily due to their specific advantages of strong designability, low-cost solution fabrication, light weight and flexibility.1–6 Two key technical factors restricting the commercialization of OPVs are power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and device stability. With the continuous development of new high-efficiency acceptor and donor materials, the PCEs of single-junction OPVs have exceeded 16%, which shows the potential for large-scale manufacture.7,8 Interface layer stability, material degradation and photoactive layer morphology stability are the key factors for device stability.9 Research and development of new interface layer materials, control of photoactive layer phase separation, optimization of device structure and packaging and other technological means can effectively improve the stability of the devices.10–15 The improvement of efficiency and stability has further promoted the process of large-scale commercialization of OPVs.
In addition to PCEs and device stability, environmental pollution and harm to human health resulting from the toxicity of halogenated solvents in the manufacture of OPV devices are also obstacles to large-scale commercialization of OPVs. With the rapid development of the economy, green has become the theme recently. However, due to the limited solubility of the organic conjugated materials used in OPVs, state-of-the-art OPV cells still employ halogenated solvents to dissolve the conjugated materials, such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF). These toxic halogenated solvents pollute the environment and are harmful to people's health at the same time. In order to prevent the harm of halogenated solvents, realizing OPV devices processed by green solvents is a wise choice. The photoactive layers and some buffer layers of OPV devices are processed by solution, which indicates that organic conjugated materials should have good solubility and film-forming properties.16–19 At the same time, after thermal annealing or solvent annealing, phase separation occurs in the donor and acceptor blend layers, forming a beneficial bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology. This excellent morphology is crucial for efficient exciton diffusion and charge generation/transport in the photoactive layers.20–25 At present, limited by the chemical structure and solubility properties of donor and acceptor materials, OPV devices with high PCEs can only be realized by using toxic halogenated solvents.
With the development of OPVs, it is an urgent task to replace toxic solvents with environmentally friendly solvents. Therefore, several methods have been explored to solve this challenge.26–28 The first effective method is to adjust the chemical structure of the original conjugated materials, synthesizing green-solvent-processable conjugated materials. In order to improve the solubility of conjugated polymers (CPs), functional groups or side chains are generally added to the polymer backbone.28,29 The method for increasing the solubility of CPs is also applicable to conjugated small molecules. At present, the PCEs of single-junction OPVs through this method have exceeded 12%.30–32 However, structural modification will not only increase the difficulty of preparing synthetic materials, but will also inevitably lead to the reduction of PCEs to different degrees. In addition, another approach is that through nanoparticle (NP) ink technology, the donor and the acceptor will be combined to prepare nanoparticles, to achieve alcohol or water treatment of OPVs. At present, nanoparticle technology can be divided into two kinds: miniemulsion and precipitation methods.27,33–35 The use of organic nanoparticles enables pre-aggregation of the donor and the acceptor domains and achieves phase separation, forming a beneficial BHJ morphology.27 However, for the miniemulsion method, the PCEs are greatly reduced due to the presence of non-conductive surfactants.36 Nanoparticles prepared by the precipitation method easily aggregate and have low stability. Only a few cases of donor and acceptor combinations that can use this method have been found so far, which limits its development.37 What is more, green-solvent-processed OPVs can be achieved by reasonably selecting green solvents with similar properties to chlorinated solvents.16–19 Even more, in some cases, the selected green solvents will perform better than the halogenated solvents, resulting in higher performance BHJ OPVs. However, not all or even a part of the donor and acceptor combinations can find suitable green solvents. With the acceleration of the OPV commercialization process, it is important to urgently realize green-solvent-processable OPVs. This review aims to introduce three methods, namely molecular design, nanoparticle ink technology and reasonable solvent selection, to realize the green manufacturing of OPVs, and looks forward to the future development prospects.
2. The requirements towards OPVs processed by green solvents
Recently, solution-processed organic photovoltaics have drawn considerable attention due to their advantages such as easy processing, low cost and offering the potential for physical flexibility.3,38 A typical structure of an OPV can be divided into three parts, namely, electrodes, buffer layers, and photoactive layers (Fig. 1). The electrodes and some of the buffer layers are processed by evaporation. However, photoactive layers and some buffer layer materials of OPVs belong to organic conjugated materials, and they are processed by means of solution processing, which indicates that these organic conjugated materials should easily dissolve in solvents. As for the buffer layer materials, they are supposed to have excellent electron transport or hole transport ability, and the solvents used in the upper buffer layers cannot affect the photoactive layers below. In the photoactive layers of typical OPVs, phase separation generally takes place during the blend process of donor and acceptor materials, yielding a beneficial BHJ structure (Fig. 1). In an ideal BHJ, the donor and acceptor materials can achieve suitable phase separation, leading to a bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology with phase domain sizes in the range of several nanometers to tens of nanometers. It is known that excellent phase separation morphology of films is vital for highly efficient OPVs. Therefore, there is a strong need that the donor and acceptor materials must be sufficiently soluble in solvent.
 Fig. 1  Illustrations of the typical structure of OPVs, four categories of green solvents and three methods to realize green-solvent-processable OPVs. 
Currently, high-efficiency donor–acceptor combinations for OPVs are still processed by halogenated solvents,7,8 such as chlorobenzene (CB), dichlorobenzene (DCB) and chloroform (CF) (Fig. 2). However, these halogenated solvents are highly toxic, and the volatilization of these solvents during the device preparation process will also cause serious harm to human health.39 To clearly demonstrate the toxicity problem, the median lethal dose (LD50) values of these solvents (in g kg−1 for rats via oral ingestion, obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich website) are provided. It is found that the LD50 values of CB, DCB and CF are 1.1, 0.5 and 0.9 g kg−1 respectively, while values of 90 and 10.5 g kg−1 are obtained in water and ethanol separately. The results powerfully demonstrate that halogenated solvents are more harmful and carcinogenic to human beings.40 Besides, if released into the atmosphere, these halogenated solvents will cause pollution and harm to the environment, possibly damaging the ozone layer above the Earth and causing acid rain.41 Moreover, the toxic solvents will be accumulated in the groundwater, further damaging the ecological environment. On the other hand, the prices of those toxic solvents are relatively high. In view of the above limitations, halogenated solvents are unsuitable for large-scale preparation and commercialization of OPV cells. Thus, exploiting eco-friendly solvent-processable OPVs is becoming more and more important. To realize this purpose, scientists have made great efforts over the past decade and some strategies have been developed with different kinds of green solvents, as will be introduced below.
 Fig. 2  Illustration of some toxic halogenated solvents and green solvents used in OPV devices. 
The green solvents used in OPVs can be divided into the following categories: non-halogenated and aromatic solvents, non-halogenated and non-aromatic solvents, alcohols and water, as shown in Fig. 2.42 Non-halogenated and aromatic solvents are aromatic solvents without halogen but containing the benzene ring structure, such as toluene, o-xylene, ethyl benzoate, and 1,2-dimethylnaphthalene. According to the “like-dissolves-like” rule-of-thumb, common photovoltaic materials with aromatic subunits tend to dissolve in these solvents. Therefore, non-halogenated and aromatic solvents may be good substitutes for halogenated solvents. Non-halogenated and non-aromatic solvents are non-aromatic solvents with neither a halogen nor a benzene ring, like carbon disulfide, ethyl acetate, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and cyclopentylmethyl ether. Although the first two kinds of solvents are also harmful to some degree,43 their toxicity is much lower than that of halogenated and aromatic solvents. Therefore, in this review, they are classified as “green” solvents, differing from traditional well-defined green solvents. Besides, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol generally have relatively low toxicity, which makes them suitable for application in the large-scale commercial manufacture of OPVs. Therefore, water and alcohols are deemed as the real green solvents and achieving water/alcohol processable OPVs is the goal pursued at present.
Up to now, three strategies have been developed to realize green-solvent-processable OPVs (Fig. 1). The first one is molecular design.44,45 It is known that photoactive layers and some buffer layer materials are usually organic conjugated materials with a highly rigid structure, so they have poor solubility in green solvents. Therefore, the method of slightly changing the structure of conjugated materials is needed. The structure of the original conjugated materials can be adjusted by taking advantage of the synthetic means, resulting in the enhancement of their solubility in the green solvent. For conjugated polymers (CPs), the common approach to improve their solubility is to graft functional groups or side chains on the polymer backbone. Compared with CPs, conjugated small molecules generally have higher solubility in organic solvents due to the low molecular weight and definite molecular structure. Therefore, the method used in CPs is also suitable for conjugated small molecules. Through reasonable optimization of molecular structures, conjugated polymers and small molecules can be dissolved in environmentally friendly organic solvents to achieve eco-friendly solvent-processed OPVs. The second strategy is nanoparticle ink technology.46–50 Specifically, the photoactive layer materials are firstly transformed into nanoparticle inks in a water or alcohol system by the miniemulsion or precipitation method, and subsequently used for the preparation of OPVs. In the miniemulsion method, the nanoparticles are stabilized by amphiphilic surfactants, while in the precipitation system, the nanoparticles are formed by self-assembly in good solvent and poor solvent. The last strategy is reasonable solvent selection. Finding suitable single or mixed green solvents to process the original material can also achieve the desired effect for fabricating eco-friendly OPVs. As for this approach, a concept of Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) has been presented to illustrate the solubility of conjugated materials, which is of great significance for the selection of appropriate and efficient green solvents.
3. Molecular design towards efficient OPVs processed by green solvents
To achieve eco-friendly solvent-processed OPVs, photoactive layers and some buffer layer materials should be dissolved in green solvents, and the most direct way is to solve the solubility problem of the raw materials in green solvents. Through the chemical structure optimization of the conjugated materials, these materials can have good solubility in green solvents, rather than be restricted within the chlorinated solvents. The chosen materials for OPVs can be divided into conjugated polymers and conjugated small molecules. According to the molecular structure difference, conjugated polymers can be further subdivided into conjugated polyelectrolytes, conjugated polymers with polar groups or side chains, and conjugated polymers with alkyl or alkenyl side chains. Compared with small molecules, conjugated polymers generally possess a more complex chemical structure and higher molecular weight, which makes them exhibit poor solubility in green solvents. Therefore, ingenious chemical structure design is required to realize conjugated polymers dissolved in green solvents. This method is also applicable to conjugated small molecules.
3.1 Conjugated polyelectrolytes
Generally, conjugated polymers consist of two parts: one is a conjugated backbone chain that determines the intrinsic optical and electrical properties of the CPs such as absorption, emission, energy level structure and charge transport characteristics, and the other is functional side chains that can change the solubility of the CPs.29 Thus, in order to improve the solubility of CPs, the following two methods are adopted (Fig. 3): (1) grafting end functional groups in the alkyl chains of the polymers;51–53 and (2) adding functional side chains to the conjugated backbone chain instead of the traditional alkyl or alkoxy chains.54–56 The solubility problem of CPs in green solvent can be effectively solved by chemical structure modification, and eco-friendly solvent-processed OPVs can be achieved.
 Fig. 3  Illustration of molecular design strategies of green-solvent-processable (a) conjugated polymers, (b) conjugated small molecules, and (c) common functional groups and side chains. 
As an important part of CPs, conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) adjust their chemical structure to enhance solubility. This method to improve the solubility of conjugated materials can be applied to buffer layer materials, which can not only guarantee the electronic or hole transport performance of buffer layer materials, but also realize the water or alcohol solubility. The commonly used groups for modification are amino, dihydroxyethylamino, phosphate, carboxyl, quaternary ammonium, anionic carboxyl, sulfonic and zwitterionic groups.29 Based on the architectural difference, CPEs can be divided into cationic, anionic and zwitterionic conjugated polyelectrolytes. Cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes possess positive terminal ions in which counterions are negatively charged on the side chains, such as functional groups with quaternary ammonium salts.57 Wu et al.58 reported a naphthalene diimide-based, self-doped, n-type water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer (PNDIT-F3N–Br), as shown in Fig. 4. It contains an NDI-based conjugated main chain and highly polar ammonium-functionalized side chains. The PNDIT-F3N–Br can be processed with a broad thickness range of 5 to 100 nm as an efficient electron transporting layer (ETL) for high-performance OPVs, yielding a high PCE of 10.11% in the case of the 5 nm thickness of ETLs with the PffBT4T-OD/PC71BM BHJ as an active layer.
 Fig. 4  Chemical structures of conjugated polyelectrolytes. 
Anionic conjugated polyelectrolytes are conjugated polyelectrolytes with negative terminal ions in which counterions are positively charged on the side chains, such as sulfonates and carboxylic acid.59,60 Son's group59 incorporated a 1,4-bis(4-sulfonatobutoxy)benzene moiety with different counter monomers of thiophene, bithiophene, and terthiophene to synthesize three kinds of anionic self-doped CPEs, named PhNa-1T, PhNa-2T and PhNa-3T, respectively (Fig. 4). It was demonstrated that the prepared CPEs have outstanding hole transport properties with a high conductivity of approximately 10−4 S cm−1, comparable to poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). When the CPEs were applied as a hole transport layer under the photoactive layer system of PCE-10 and Bis-C60, a PCE of 9.89% was achieved. Zhang et al.60 designed a pair of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes (PFCOONa and PFNBr). PFCOONa can interact with PFNBr by electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly to form a functional interlayer with tunable thickness. Under the combination of a photoactive layer of PTB7-Th and PC71BM, a PCE of 9.41% was obtained in this system.
Zwitterionic conjugated polyelectrolytes generally have immovable anionic and cationic groups on a single or different chains. Duan et al.61 synthesized a series of zwitterionic CPEs with identical sulfobetaine zwitterionic groups on their side chains but different in main chains. The prepared CPEs showed outstanding alcohol processability and could act as interface modification materials to improve electron collection in OPVs. Among them, PFNSO revealed the best performance processed in OPVs, yielding a PCE of 8.74% (Fig. 4).
Unfortunately, compared with unmodified CPs, modified CPEs usually have some drawbacks such as low charge mobilities, potential charge traps and quenching sites caused by ionic groups and their counterions, which may lead to the decrease of PCE.29,62 Due to these shortcomings, CPEs have rarely been applied in active layer materials to date. In contrast, CPEs as the hole or electron transport layers have been widely applied due to their good interfacial modification ability. The improvement of device performance is attributed to the formation of an interfacial electrical dipole on the transport layer/metal interface.29,63,64 Due to the low charge mobilities, the optimum thickness used in the OPV transport layers is relatively low (5–10 nm), in comparison to metal oxides (about 40 nm).29 Therefore, further investigations are needed to solve this problem.
3.2 Conjugated polymers with polar groups or side chains
Due to the limitations of CPEs caused by ionic groups and their counterions, there are some shortcomings hindering the performance of OPV cells with CPEs as the active layer materials. In view of the limitations of CPEs, conjugated polymers with polar groups may be an efficient replacement. Due to the presence of polar groups or polar side chains, these CPs exhibit excellent solubility in green solvents, thus resulting in eco-friendly solvent-processed OPVs. Fig. 5 presents the molecular structures of the CPs with polar groups or side chains used in eco-friendly OPVs. Huang et al.65 reported a conjugated polyfluorene with functional tertiary amino groups in the end of the alkyl chains (PFN) which exhibited good solubility in alcohol. When the PFN was applied as a cathode modification layer in an organic solar cell device, the device performance was highly improved.66–68 Besides, attaching phosphonate groups to the end of the alkyl chains will also be an efficient approach to enhance the solubility of CPs.65 Wang et al. designed two CPs with polar and inert phosphonate terminal groups (P1-Pho and P2-Pho), which are easily soluble in methoxybenzene (MOB, a non-halogenated solvent).69 The performance of P2-Pho OPVs processed in MOB improved greatly than in CB and DCB, yielding a PCE of 2.11%.
 Fig. 5  Molecular structures of the conjugated polymers with polar groups or side chains dissolved in eco-friendly solvents used in OPVs. 
Another way to enhance the solubility of CPs in green solvents is to graft polar side chains into main chains. Adding a siloxane-terminated side-chain into the main chain of CPs can improve the solubility of CPs, realizing green-solvent-processable OPVs.70,71 Cao and his co-workers designed and synthesized a wide-bandgap CP with a siloxane-terminated side-chain (PTzBI-Si), which can dissolve in the green solvent 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran.70 Combining PTzBI-Si with a naphthalene diimide-based polymer acceptor, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) were obtained with PCEs up to 10.1%. The special structure brings lots of advantages in preparing all-PSC devices, such as high crystallinity, suitable face-on orientation and excellent charge carrier mobility. Then, they optimized the BHJ morphology using another green solvent cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) for the same photoactive layer system, yielding a PCE of over 11%.71 Likewise, attaching an oligo-(ethylene oxide) side chain into the conjugated backbone is also an alternative to modify the solubility of CPs.45,72–74 Nguyen et al. reported a novel p-type polymer (PPDT2FBT-A) and n-type bisadduct fullerene acceptor (Bis-C60-A) with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side-chains to fabricate organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs), which could be processed only using ethanol.73 PPDT2FBT-A showed high charge-carrier mobilities up to 1.0 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was the highest value compared to the reported record for alcohol-processed devices. Similar to the oligo-(ethylene oxide) side chain, an alkylthio side chain is a kind of polar side chain, which can enhance the solubility of CPs.30,32,75 Xu et al. reported a wide-bandgap conjugated polymer (PBDTS-TDZ), which could be dissolved in a single green solvent o-xylene.32 The PBDTS-TDZ with alkylthio side chains showed some advantages such as strong optical absorption, a suitable HOMO level, and high crystallinity. The OPV devices based on the PBDTS-TDZ:ITIC system exhibited outstanding performance like a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.10 eV, a desirable high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.78 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor of 65.4%, finally obtaining an extremely high PCE of 12.80%. Moreover, the PCEs can be increased to 13.35% (certified as 13.19%) in a homotandem device architecture and the VOC can be up to 2.13 V. Similarly, Wu et al.75 synthesized a donor material with an alkylthio side chain (BDB-TS), which could be dissolved in green solvents like toluene and o-xylene. A high PCE of 9.85% was obtained in the PBDB-TS:ITIC combination by using o-xylene and 1% N-methylpyrrolidone mixed solvents, better than the devices processed by toxic solvents. Besides, introducing an oligo-(ethylene oxide) side chain and alkylthio side chain simultaneously to the backbone of CPs could also improve the solubility of CPs. For instance, Chen et al. synthesized a novel CP, namely, PBDTTT-S-TEG with an oligo-(ethylene oxide) side chain and alkylthio side chain simultaneously, and the two polar side chains acted together to enhance the solubility of the raw CP, so that it can easily dissolve in anisole.45 Similarly, Peng and his co-workers designed a desirable donor material, PTB-EDOTS, and the donor exhibited extraordinary solubility in the green solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF).30 Consequently, while a PCE of 9.28% was achieved for ITIC-Th as the acceptor and chlorobenzene/1-chloronaphthalene (CB/CN) as the processing solvents, a higher PCE of 10.18% was obtained when using MeTHF as the processing solvent. As discussed above, grafting an oligo-(ethylene oxide) side chain and alkylthio side chain into the backbone of CPs is an efficient method for preparing eco-friendly solvent-processed OPVs.
According to the reported literature,28,29 conjugated polymers (CPs) with polar groups or side chains exhibit better performance when used in active layers compared with conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs). The reason for this phenomenon is that CPs with polar groups or side chains can overcome the limitations of CPEs such as low charge mobilities, potential charge traps and quenching site caused by ionic groups and counterions. However, it should be pointed out that CPs with polar groups or side chains have not completely overcome the limitations of CPEs. Decreased charge mobilities and trap-induced charge recombinations often take place in the modified CPs due to the presence of polar groups and side chains. As a consequence, although the solubility of CPs in green solvents can be improved by modifications, it is inevitable that the PCEs will decrease to different degrees. Therefore, further investigations are needed to solve this problem.
3.3 Conjugated polymers with alkyl or alkenyl side chains
The main chains of CPs are extremely rigid, leading to poor solubility in the vast majority of solvents, and even in these halogenated solvents, i.e. CB, DCB, and CF. In order to achieve a convenient way of solution processing, introducing some alkyl chains into the main chain of CPs is an efficient method. There are some cases where adding alkyl groups in the polymer main chains could improve their solubility.76–79 Regrettably, the reported conjugated polymers were rarely used in constructing highly efficient OPV architectures. As we know, conjugated backbone chains determine the intrinsic optical and electrical properties of CPs, and introducing alkyl groups into the main chains of CPs will destroy the rigid, planar and conjugated structure. Besides, because of the electrical insulation of alkyl chains, introducing alkyl chains in the main chain of CPs will also dilute the chromophore density in thin film and provide a barrier to charge conduction, thus leading to the decrease of the device performance.76 To solve this problem, an effective and universal strategy has been developed for improving the solubility of CPs in green solvents by grafting alkyl side chains onto the conjugated polymer skeleton.
The addition of flexible alkyl side chains can change the solubility of conjugated polymers, thereby increasing their solubility in halogenated solvents, and achieving solution processed OPVs.28,80–82 However, it should be pointed out that the length of alkyl side chains has a significant influence on the final device performance.83 In detail, with the increase of the length of alkyl side chains, the orientation of the CP backbone gradually changes from edge-on to face-on relative to the electrodes, which is beneficial for achieving high PCEs. However, increasing the length of alkyl side chains would also lead to a bad effect on the domain size and domain purity.83 Therefore, in order to achieve highly efficient green-solvent-processable OPVs, it is crucial to introduce an adaptable length of alkyl side chains.
Through the specific molecular structure design, adding certain length and suitable alkyl or alkenyl side chains into the main chains of CPs can change their solubility properties. In this way, the CPs can dissolve in some non-halogenated green solvents, realizing green-solvent-processed OPV devices.31,83–85 The molecular structure of CPs with alkyl or alkenyl side chains is illustrated in Fig. 6. For instance, in order to achieve high PCEs in eco-friendly solvent all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), Hou and his co-workers demonstrated attaching a long alkyl chain into perylene diimide (PDI)-based CPs to synthesize an acceptor, named PPDIODT.84 Firstly, owing to the nature of the main chains, the large dihedral angles existing in PDI and thiophene units will hinder the forceful aggregation among PDI units to improve solubility in green solvents. Then, the long and flexible alkyl side chains similarly improve their solubility. Combining the two advantages, superior solubility can be realized in lots of solvents, particularly in non-halogenated solvents, such as toluene and anisole. Furthermore, two novel CPs, PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT, were designed to realize green-solvent-processed OPVs.31 The two CPs can not only improve the solubility in tetrahydrofuran (THF, a non-halogenated solvent), but can also adjust the aggregation morphology, giving rise to an excellent PCE of 12.10% for PBDB-BzT:IT-M combination devices. In addition, three CPs, PffBT4T-C8C12, PffBT4T-C9C13 and PffBT4T-C10C14, were designed and synthesized to realize hydrocarbon-processed OPVs.83 They combined the advantages of a green solvent named 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), a novel additive named 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) and an alkyl chain of a given length modified in the backbone of CPs, not only achieving green-solvent-processable OPVs, but also yielding a high PCE of 11.7%. They also studied the influences of the length of alkyl chains, finding that the orientation of the long length alkyl chain backbone was changed from edge-on to face-on relative to the electrodes, which is a beneficial result. Simultaneously, there was an adverse effect for the domain size and domain purity with the increase of chain length. Considering both factors, the best effect can be obtained by choosing a suitable chain length (C9H13 was adopted). Additionally, Zhou et al.85 used polystyrene side-chains to modify an isoindigo-based polymer to gain materials processed by non-halogenated solvents, obtaining three CPs, PII-2T-PS0, PII-2T-PS5, and PII-2T-PS10, which are different in terms of the content of polystyrene side-chains. The solubility of CPs is decided by the content of polystyrene side-chains, and improves with the increase of the content. Furthermore, the mobility of high charge carriers will not decrease. The CPs with 5 mol% polystyrene (PS) side chains (PII-2T-PS5) have the advantage of adjusting the size of the phase separation in the all-PSCs. Moreover, the CPs with 10 mol% polystyrene (PS) side chains (PII-2T-PS5) exhibit good solubility in toluene, yielding a PCE over 5% for all-PSCs processed by both non-halogenated solvent and non-halogenated additive. Similarly, to date, Park and his co-workers have studied two novel kinds of CPs, called P2FBTT-H and P2FBTT-Br, which contain two asymmetric extended branching alkyl chains resulting in good solubility in green solvent 2-methylanisole.86 Surprisingly, one of the alkyl side chains of P2FBTT-Br is a long alkyl side chain, and the other side chain is a bromine-functionalized alkyl chain. P2FBTT-Br not only exhibits good solubility in 2-methylanisole, but also has outstanding properties that enable it to be crosslinked by UV irradiation owing to the bromine functional group, enhancing the stability of devices. In short, careful modulation of the certain length alkyl side chains is of significance for realizing high PCEs in green-solvent-processed OPV cells.

3.4 Conjugated small molecules
Unlike conjugated polymers, conjugated small molecules possess low molecular weight and a definite structure, so it is easier to modify their molecular structure. In addition, the method used in CPs to improve solubility is also applicable to conjugated small molecules, and the effect may be better. In comparison to fullerene materials, non-fullerene materials have more modification sites and it is easier to adjust their molecular structure to improve solubility.87 Similar to CPs, in order to enhance the solubility of small molecules, attaching end functional groups in the alkyl chains of the small molecules and directly grafting functional side chains on the small molecules are the significant approaches. Therefore, from another point of view, there are three methods to modify the conjugated small molecules. Some molecular structures are shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Chemical structures of conjugated small molecules. 
The first is adding hydrophilic terminal ions into the alkyl chains of the small molecules to form conjugated small molecule electrolyte.88–92 Taking one case for example, a quinacridone-based water/alcohol-soluble conjugated small molecule, Na+QHSO3−, was introduced as the electron transport layer (ETL).88 Through introducing a sulfonic electrolyte group, the ETL material can not only dissolve in water or alcohol, but also exhibits excellent electron transport performance. Besides, Zhang et al. revealed a kind of cathode interlayer material based on a perylene diimide (PDI) derivative for PSCs, which was modified by amino N-oxide (PDINO) groups.89 The material can easily dissolve in the green solvent methanol. Because of its excellent conductivity, suitable energy level and work function tuning effect, the material is insensitive to thickness, and was employed as a cathode interlayer processed in a wide range from 6 to 25 nm. Consequently, the PTB7-Th and PC70BM system can achieve a high PCE of 8.35%. In addition, another approach is to attach polar groups or side chains on the small molecules similar to CPs.93–96 For example, a novel acceptor material, ortho–ortho perylene diimide diploid with polar amino-acid esters, namely oo-2PDIate, was designed, and it has outstanding solubility in non-halogenated solvents, such as anisole.93 The oo-2PDIate shows several advantages of strong forceful absorption in the range of 400–600 nm, good thermal stability, high extinction coefficient and a suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. Consequently, a PCE of 2.24% was gained with anisole as the processing solvent, which is close to the PCE of 2.52% processed by chlorobenzene solvent. Similarly, Welch and co-workers added functional N–H moieties into the backbone of a N-annulated perylene diimide dimer (tPDI2N–H), so that this excellent material can be soluble in lots of organic solvents, particular in green solvents.96 Meanwhile, the N–H moieties are the active sites that can graft other functional chains or groups, such as electron donating hexyl chains or electron withdrawing tert-butyloxycarbonyl groups, to further modify the properties of small molecules. Therefore, it is a creative approach to realize green-solvent-processable OPVs. In addition, it was demonstrated that introducing a borane moiety into a perylene diimide derivative, named (PDI)2Th2B, could functionalize the pristine acceptor material and achieve green solvent processed bulk-heterojunction OPVs at the same time.94 The borane moiety can change the optical, electronic, and geometric properties, resulting in the improvement of device performance. To illustrate this, Kim et al.95 designed a series of fullerene derivatives modified by oligoethylene glycol side chains different in length and number of branches, which showed excellent solubility in a mixture of water and alcohol (illustrated in Fig. 8). Surprisingly, those fullerene derivative materials showed an excellent electron mobility of 1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which far exceeded that of other alcohol/water-soluble fullerene derivatives. Consequently, they attempted to prepare PSCs processed by ethanol/water mixtures in air, yielding a PCE of 1.4%. Finally, alkyl side chain engineering on small molecule semiconductors, named SM1 and SM2, was adopted.97 In this case, they confirmed that the solubility could be changed by adjusting the attachment position of alkyl chains on the molecular backbone. Finally, the synthesized small molecules exhibit good solubility in toluene. Recently, a donor and acceptor combination, namely PBDB-TF/Y6, has attracted the most interest due to the high PCEs of over 15.7% processed by the halogenated solvent CF, which is one of the highest records for single-junction OPV cells.98 Hou and his co-workers synthesized a kind of non-fullerene acceptor, named BTP-4F-12, with longer alkyl side chains based on BTP-4F-8 (also known as Y6).99 BTP-4F-12 possesses a longer alkyl side chain (2-butyloctyl) compared to BTP-4F-8 (2-ethylhexyl), so it shows better solubility in some eco-friendly solvents, such as o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Although BTP-4F-12 has longer alkyl side chains, the crystallinity and electron mobility were enhanced compared to BTP-4F-8 resulting from the improved lamellar stacking in the in-plane (IP) direction. Consequently, a high PCE of 16.1% was achieved using the BTP-4F-12 and PBDB-TF-T1 (based on PBDB-TF) combination processed by THF, which was higher than the PCE of 15.5% processed by CF using the same donor and acceptor combination.

Overall, the method of molecular design is an efficient and significant approach to achieve green manufacture of OPV devices. In order to enhance the solubility of CPs, electrolyte groups, polar groups or side chains and alkyl or alkenyl side chains are grafted into the main chains or side chains of polymers. Furthermore, they are also adaptable to conjugated small molecules. Based on this method, lots of efforts have been made to address the toxicity problem of halogenated solvents, realizing green development and promoting the process of large-scale commercialization of OPVs. However, this method has several disadvantages. For instance, it is not universal, and molecular structural modification increases the difficulty of synthetic materials, resulting in the increase of cost, which is not conducive to large-scale manufacture. Generally, structural modification will inevitably give rise to the decrease of PCE to different degrees.
Therefore, as for structural design to achieve green large-scale manufacturing for OPVs, it is still necessary to study the nature that hinders PCEs from the perspective of material design, and find more efficient methods to solve the problem from the source, developing green manufacturing OPV devices with high efficiency and low cost.
4. Nanoparticulate photoactive layers towards efficient OPVs processed by green solvents
Besides the aforementioned molecular design for constructing green-solvent-processable OPVs, fabricating organic nanoparticles stably dispersed in water or alcohol can also realize this purpose. The use of organic nanoparticles enables pre-aggregation of the donor and acceptor domains to achieve a beneficial bulk-heterojunction morphology. Nanoparticle ink technology, including miniemulsion and precipitation methods, is adopted to prepare nanoparticulate photoactive layers. This strategy may solve the problem that the photoactive layer materials have low solubility in green solvent.
4.1 Miniemulsion method
The miniemulsion method is a powerful strategy for the preparation of organic semiconductor nanoparticles in an aqueous system to realize green-solvent-processable OPVs.100 This method can effectively solve the solubility problem of hydrophobic conjugated organic donor and acceptor materials by introducing surfactants to prepare stable aqueous dispersions. Especially, the structures and types of donor and acceptor materials are not limited to the miniemulsion method, demonstrating its universality. In 2001, Landfester firstly developed the miniemulsion technique.101 Then, his team successfully applied the method to prepare semiconducting polymer nanoparticles in an aqueous dispersion system.102 Soon afterwards, this method was creatively used in the solar cell area to prepare OPV devices with a PCE of 0.004% in 2003.100 This attempt opened a new direction for realizing green-solvent-processable OPVs by taking advantage of nanoparticle ink technology. Through the continuous efforts and development in the last twenty years, various green-solvent-processable OPV systems using the miniemulsion method have been established, as shown in Table 1. Through mechanism study and device optimization, the PCEs of OPVs have already exceeded 7.5% now.37

The fabrication process of nanoparticle ink for photoactive layer materials can be divided into the following three steps, as depicted in Fig. 9a.103 In the first step, after the photoactive layer material pre-dissolves in its good solvent until completely dissolved, the homogeneous solution is added to the aqueous phase containing surfactants. Small droplets with high stability in a continuous phase are created by using intense sonication, forming a uniform miniemulsion. In the second step, after sonication, the miniemulsion system is heated at a high temperature with constant stirring to eliminate the dispersed phase solvent with high vapor pressure. In the last step, the excess surfactant is removed from the nanoparticle solution by centrifugation or dialysis. Through the above three steps, nanoparticle ink can be prepared. The size of nanoparticles can be accurately controlled within tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers through miniemulsion technology, which may influence the domain size of the BHJ in OPV devices.

The size of nanoparticles is affected by several factors such as concentration of donor–acceptor materials in good solvent, concentration of surfactant in water, good solvent and water ratio, and ultrasonication time. What is by far the most significant factor among these factors is the concentration of photoactive layer materials in the dispersed phase solvent.104 This method can be used to obtain colloidal inks with narrow particle size dispersion and high stability, which can remain stable in the environment for months without much change in the dispersion liquid (Fig. 9b).
Due to the structure and solubility difference of the donor and acceptor materials, different PCEs of OPV devices were obtained by using various donor and acceptor combinations in the preparation of nanoparticle ink by the miniemulsion method. For instance, P3HT and PCBM photoactive layer materials are a classic combination, and this donor and acceptor system has been studied many times using this method.105–109 Through continuous optimization of nanoparticles and device preparation technology, the PCEs of OPVs for this system have developed from the initial 0.29% to the present 2.15%.105,107 This confirmed that even for the same donor and acceptor combination, PCEs can be improved by optimization of the preparation conditions and device structure. Ulum et al.110 studied the effect of different acceptors in the nanoparticle structure. They fabricated P3HT:ICBA blend nanoparticulate OPV devices, which exhibited a PCE of 2.5% compared with a PCE of 5.44% from toxic processing. Besides, TQ1 shows more satisfactory material properties for nanoparticulate OPV fabrication, particularly a high glass transition temperature (Tg) and amorphous nature compared with the commonly applied semicrystalline polymer P3HT.111 By using TQ1 and PC71BM blends, a PCE of 2.54% was achieved in NP-OPVs, which is lower than a PCE of 6% for those processed by halogenated DCB. In principle, selecting more efficient donor and acceptor materials could realize higher PCEs for NP-OPVs.
The morphology of donor–acceptor nanoparticles prepared by the miniemulsion method will determine the final device performance.112 OPVs with high PCEs generally require a beneficial photoactive layer composed of a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of nanoscale aggregates of semiconductors formed by phase separation. Many researchers demonstrated that donor–acceptor blends nanoparticles are core–shell structures (Fig. 9c).106,110,112 Furthermore, they revealed that the semiconductor NP blends enable pre-aggregation of the donor and acceptor domains to yield a core–shell BHJ morphology, and the photoactive layer films are highly structured with the component domain sizes controlled by phase segregation within the nanoparticles rather than the photoactive layer itself. Importantly, using this approach it is now possible to design the microstructure of the photoactive layer of OPVs by changing the morphology of nanoparticle blends and separating film morphology and film deposition into two different processes.113 For instance, through changing the nanoparticle composition, nanoparticle radii, and the ratios of P3HT and PCBM, the photoactive layer morphology was optimized, and a high PCE of 2.15% was obtained with the device performance approximating that of typical BHJ devices.107 The donor–acceptor ratio is a vital factor in the morphology of the photoactive layer. For example, upon varying the P3HT and PCBM ratio from 1:0.5 to 1:2, device performance increases from 1:0.5 to 1:1, and then surprisingly plateaus with the change from 1:1 to 1:2.114 It is different compared with the reported trends in typical BHJ OPVs where device performance decreases obviously for the donor and acceptor ratio increasing beyond 1:1. In contrast to donor–acceptor blend NPs with a core–shell structure, a single-component NP system is worth studying, as it takes advantage of the easy design and engineering of the film morphology via customizing nanoparticulate colloidal inks. In particular, pristine donor polymer NPs and pristine acceptor fullerene NPs can be utilized to directly engineer both two-phase and three-phase thin film morphologies. Furthermore, a three-phase thin film provides a superior level of control than core–shell NP systems through carefully combining and annealing these NPs.113
In the process of coating NPs to form the BHJ film, there are still some defects although NPs accumulate tightly on the substrate. Thermal annealing is required to melt the NP film and enable the formation of interconnected networks within mixed phases. Thermal annealing of BHJ films will lead to the shrinkage of the film, while mobility improves a lot because of the more compact films (Fig. 10).104 Different from the conventional OPV devices, the fabrication of aqueous nanoparticle ink OPV devices is challenging in terms of balancing the two competing requirements of maintaining emulsion stability and facilitating surface wettability simultaneously. It has been proved that the residual surfactant concentration is vital in determining the wetting properties of the prepared NP inks.104 Besides, treatment of the transport layer surface onto which the NP inks are coated by UV-ozone (UVO) and plasma respectively is another key method to improve the wetting properties.108 For example, PEDOT:PSS with excellent conductivity and water-solubility is usually used as a hole transport layer. However, the surface of PEDOT:PSS will be more hydrophobic after thermal annealing, which does not match with the surface wettability of water. For example, three common types of PEDOT:PSS materials, which are different in terms of conductivity, were used to investigate the impact of the surface treatment on the NP film quality. Consequently, ozone treatment resulted in great improvement for the wetting properties of NP inks on all three types of PEDOT:PSS, which in turn allowed for deposition of smoother NP films. Meanwhile, the efficiencies of OPV devices significantly improved.115 The fabrication of aqueous NP-OPVs is an advisable method to realize green-solvent-processable OPVs, which accelerates the process of large-scale commercialization of OPVs. While a lot of work has been conducted on small-scale NP-OPV devices fabricated from NP inks, roll-to-roll (R2R), a large-scale NP-OPV processing, has been researched at the same time.115,116 However, the PCE of OPV devices still maintains a low state. More research is needed to achieve higher PCEs for NP-OPVs.

Unfortunately, compared with halogenated solvent processable OPV devices, PCEs of nanoparticle processable OPV devices are lower. It is known that nanoparticle inks are typically stabilized by surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), to prevent aggregation. However, common surfactants with bad conductivity will be difficult to remove completely by dialysis and centrifugal filtration in the preparation process of NP inks, part of which will remain in the photoactive layer film. In addition, the surfactants may increase the distance between the nanoparticles or cause interfacial defects, and there will be an inadequate distribution of the donor and acceptor domains. Therefore, it is considered that surfactants might hinder charge transport in the process of NP assembly.36 From another point of view, some studied have shown that the key factor in the decrease of efficiency was incomplete crystallization of nanoparticle films influenced by the residual surfactants.104 Consequently, due to the impact of residual surfactants, the performance of aqueous NP-OPVs was greatly limited, and it was lower than that of the halogenated-solvent-processable OPVs. Therefore, decreasing the concentration of free and surface-bound surfactants in the final NP inks is a critical factor to enhance the PCEs of aqueous NP-OPVs. Fallon et al.117 demonstrated that optimizing the initial surfactant concentration could improve the performance of NP-OPVs. Besides, removing surfactants as much as possible via dialysis or centrifugal filtration processes is an efficient method to enhance PCEs.115 However, what calls for more attention is that there is a crucial need to create a balance between the aggregation of NPs at low concentration and the negative effect of surfactants at high concentration. It is, therefore, essential to find other suitable surfactants, which can be removed more completely from the NP dispersion system. From the study of Xie and co-workers,37 several different kinds of surfactants were employed to synthesize NFA-based NPs in water, for instance, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), polyethylene glycol dodecyl ether (Brij), poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), poly(styrene-alt-maleic acid) (PSMA), and Pluronic F127 (Fig. 11). Among these surfactants, it was confirmed that Pluronic F127 is an effective surfactant to prepare surfactant-terminated BHJ nanoparticles. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of Pluronic F127 is sensitive to temperature. The CMC will show a steep increase when lowering the temperature to near 0 °C, which can convert F127 micelles back to a monodisperse molecular form in water, so that approximately all free and loosely bound surfactants can be removed through a centrifugal filtration method. Washing after 5 times under 0 °C, the amount of residual F127 dropped to 2% of the original amount. For comparison, after washing 10 times, 13% SDS was left. Consequently, a record high PCE of 7.5%, which is far higher than all the PCE values reported previously, was achieved for PBQ-QF:ITIC NP-OPVs. This provided evidence that this method, named the surfactant-stripping technique, enabled the fabrication of highly efficient aqueous NP OPVs, and it has great prospects in large-scale manufacturing. As can be seen from the above, the non-conductivity of surfactants is the main obstacle to the development of the miniemulsion method, so it may be a future development goal to find other new surfactants that can be easily removed completely, or conductive surfactants that can match the active layer materials.

4.2 Precipitation method
Compared with the miniemulsion method for preparing nanoparticle inks, the precipitation method is more advantageous because it does not use surfactants. The first case concerning preparing donor–acceptor NPs for OPVs by precipitation was reported in 2011 by Darwis and co-workers.118 Utilizing the system of P3HT and PCBM, they made an effort to prepare conjugated polymer NPs with ethanol as a bad solvent. They demonstrated that donor–acceptor NPs, the sizes of which were in the range of 35 to 100 nm, could be successfully prepared by novel means. In fact, research into using this method for developing high-efficiency OPV devices was conducted in 2014 by Gärtner and co-workers.27 They prepared surfactant-free P3HT:ICBA nanoparticle ink for alcohol-processable OPV cells, yielding a really high PCE of 4.1%. The result proved that the NP-OPV prepared by the precipitation method enabled the realization of high PCEs that approached the PCEs of devices processed by toxic halogenated solvents. Meanwhile, the PCEs far exceeded the efficiency of the same donor–acceptor combination OPV devices, with a PCE of 2.5%, obtained through the miniemulsion process.110 From the above description, we can draw the conclusion that, in a way, the precipitation method is not limited by surfactants, and may be more efficient than the miniemulsion method.
The precipitation method offers a single and simple route to prepare the donor–acceptor NPs, where the photoactive layer materials dissolved in their “good” solvent are injected into excess “poor” solvent under continuous stirring (Fig. 12a).119 Because of the obvious change of solvent polarity, the formation of nanoparticles results from the aggregation of donor–accept blends. Taking the example of P3HT:ICBA, the mechanism for forming stable nanoparticles is as follows.120 Firstly, when chloroform solvent containing P3HT:ICBA is added into alcohol, tiny droplets are formed immediately. Due to the complete miscibility between chloroform and alcohol, its molecules are quickly dispersed in the alcohol. Furthermore, the saturated donor–acceptor blends rapidly aggregate and crystallize to form nanoparticles dispersed in an alcohol–solvent medium. Actually, compared with miniemulsion technology, the process for the precipitation method is more simple and quicker, which is more suitable for large-scale manufacturing. According to the study by Sankaran et al.,121 they simultaneously realized the efficiencies of OPV devices of different photoactive areas, such as PCEs of 3.9% on 0.105 cm2 and 3.4% on 1.1 cm2. At the same time, ink-jet printing technology was employed to prepare an NP-OPV, yielding a PCE of 2.9%. Recently, precipitation systems of THF/water and chloroform/alcohol are commonly used to prepare the surfactant-free NPs studied so far. However, the chloroform/alcohol combination can yield a preferable performance.119,122

Many studies indicated that the nanoparticle diameter is controlled by several factors, e.g. precursor solution concentration, stirring rate and donor:acceptor ratio.120,123 The higher the photoactive layer material starting concentration is, the larger the diameter will be. Furthermore, nanoparticle sizes will affect the stability of the dispersion ink. Xie et al. revealed that too large or too small particle size would reduce the stability of the dispersion solution, and the optimum dispersion stability could be obtained by optimizing the particle size (Fig. 12b).120 Besides, they demonstrated that upon increasing the alkyl chain length, different alcohols (e.g. ethanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanol, 3-hexanol, and cis-3-hexen-1-ol) with decreasing polarity could influence the size and the surface charge of nanoparticles. Different from the core–shell nanostructure nanoparticles prepared by the miniemulsion method, surfactant-free nanoparticles have no distinct core–shell structure, and are composed of a unified distribution of small semiconductor domains, which is similar to conventional BHJ films.124 Therefore, the surfactant-free NPs possess an optimum nanoscale morphology without being limited by the core–shell structure, and produce high performance NP-OPV cell devices. After the formation of film formed by surfactant-free NPs, the authors demonstrated via TAS experiments that phase separation and the blend nanostructure were not greatly changed by the annealing process. The result shows that annealing only causes the nanoparticles to melt, reducing the porosity between the nanoparticles, resulting in increasing charge transport. In short, this explains the superior performance of surfactant-free NP-OPVs to that of surfactant-based NP-OPVs.
Although the surfactant-free NP-OPV shows more predominant performance than surfactant-based NP-OPVs in the same donor–acceptor combination, there are many inevitable problems that cannot be ignored. One of the problems is the poor stability because there are no surfactants to stabilize the nanoparticles, which leads to the need to maintain low solid content in the dispersions to prevent the aggregation.27 Nevertheless, their stability is still worse than that of nanoparticles prepared by the miniemulsion method. Moreover, in the process of photoactive layer film fabrication, it is often necessary to spin the coating several times to achieve the required thickness. On the other hand, the precipitation method seems sensitive to the specific donor:acceptor material combination. To date, only three combinations (P3HT:PC61BM, P3HT:ICBA and PCDTBT:PC71BM) have been achieved for preparing NPs. Xie et al.37 studied several materials such as PCE11, PCE10, PDPP-TT-T, and PCDTBT, and found that the nanoprecipitation method failed to yield highly qualitative NPs from the chloroform/alcohol system for OPV devices, which always formed large aggregations so that tiny nanoparticles could not form. This result is attributed to the nature of lots of donors and acceptors to easily aggregate. Therefore, this method is not universal, which limits its development.
In order to prepare stable donor–acceptor NPs, directly synthesizing conjugated nanoparticles in green solvents through dispersion polymerization might be an efficient method, which is different from but similar to the precipitation method. The aforementioned precipitation method involves the synthesis of conjugated polymers firstly, and then the precipitation of nanoparticles in “poor” solvents. However, dispersion polymerization is a kind of special precipitation polymerization. Before the reaction, it is a uniform system. After the reaction starts, the polymer reaches a certain molecular weight and precipitates from the reaction system. Dispersion polymerization requires the addition of a small amount of stabilizer. Recently, a number of studies have proved that the Suzuki–Miyaura dispersion polymerization method can be used to prepare a variety of highly monodisperse conjugated polymer nanoparticles.125–127 Therefore, this one-step synthesis method is promising in the preparation of semiconductor nanoparticles.
5. Reasonable solvent selection towards efficient OPVs processed by green solvents
The structural design method increases the difficulty of synthesis and nanoparticle ink technology requires secondary processing, which increases the difficulty and cost of manufacturing OPV devices. Therefore, direct selection of suitable green solvents for manufacture of OPVs to avoid the above disadvantages may be a wise choice. Conjugated polymers and conjugated small molecules exhibit different solubilities in various solvents. Generally, due to their own structural properties, the solubility in chlorinated solvents is much higher than that in other solvents. Green manufacturing of OPVs can be realized by looking for adaptable green solvents with similar solubility to chlorinated solvents or efficient green solvents with better solubility as solvents for donor and acceptor combinations. Usually, the cohesive energy density (CED) is used to describe the properties of solvents. At the same time, solid substances dissolved in solvents can also be described with CEDs. Furthermore, the concept of Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) was presented to describe CEDs approximately, namely, the solubility of the solvents. The HSP can be applied in OPVs to determine and predict the solubility of conjugated materials, which is of great guiding significance for the realization of efficient OPV devices.16–18 In the meantime, through rational selection of solvents, it is an efficient method to find suitable green solvents, to achieve the green manufacturing for OPV devices.128–131
It is highly required to replace toxic halogenated solvents with green solvents for large-scale manufacture of OPV cells. For this purpose, HSP analysis was developed to rationally select candidate green solvents for solution-processed BHJ OPV devices.19 It can discover and predict the dissolution behavior of conjugated materials in different solvents, for which a suitable green solvent is used in photoactive layer materials to form a beneficial BHJ morphology similar to the BHJ morphology of those processed by toxic solvents. Therefore, this method opens new paths for the fabrication of highly efficient green-solvent-processed OPVs. Generally, it is difficult to find a completely adaptable green solvent which can be comparable to chlorinated solvents. Therefore, the obtained BHJ film morphology is different from that of BHJ processed by harmful chlorinated solvents, and the PCEs will be reduced to different degrees. At this time, the additives can be used in the solution-processed active layer and act together with the green solvent to regulate the phase separation of the donor and the acceptor in the process of forming the BHJ film for obtaining the best BHJ morphology. For instance, there was an effort to replace o-DCB with green solvents o-xylene and anisole for the PBQ-4 and PC71BM combination.132 Additionally, there was the same choice to employ N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and diphenyl ether (DPE) instead of halogenated 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additives to improve the morphologies of the BHJ films. As a result, there were surprisingly high PCEs of 7.62% and 8.37% yielded by solvent/additive systems of o-xylene/NMP and anisole/DPE, respectively, very close to the PCE of 8.47% achieved by an o-DCB/DIO system. Similarly, Cai et al.133 selected 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) as the main solvent used in OPV devices based on the system of PDTSTPD and PC71BM. However, different from conjugated donor materials, fullerene acceptor materials usually reveal poor solubility in TMB. Therefore, it was a wise decision to choose 1,5-dimethylnaphthalene (1,5-DMN) as the additive, which can dissolve fullerenes. The solvent/additive system of TMB/DMN could optimize the aggregation morphology of the PDTSTPD and PC71BM blend, forming efficient nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating networks. Consequently, PSC devices processed by a TMB/DMN system revealed a high PCE over 8%, exhibiting better performance than those devices processed by CB/DIO, pure TMB, and pure CB solvents.
While optimizing the BHJ morphology of thin films and improving the charge transport properties, high-boiling-point solvent additives greatly affect the stability and reproducibility of devices.134–137 Besides, due to their high boiling point, solvent additives are required to be removed by additional means. Therefore, high performance OPV devices processed by single-component solvents without using solvent additives have been developed.138–141 In 2017, a study reported the use of single solvent systems such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and o-xylene in the process of manufacturing high efficiency OPVs without using any solvent additives.140 They chose two green single-component solvents and two toxic solvents as the processing solvents for active layer materials, namely, THF, o-xylene, CB, and o-DCB. Surprisingly, they achieved PCEs of over 8.11% and 6.79% for the PTB7-Th:ITIC combination using o-xylene and THF as the solvents, respectively, instead of CB and o-DCB. The PCE of 8.11% was higher than those of OPV devices processed by CB and o-DCB without additives, and was the highest record at the time. Similarly, Zhang et al.138 employed single-component green solvent 2-methylanisole as the processing solvent to realize high efficiency large-scale OPV devices based on a PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, obtaining a high PCE of 7.5%. This excellent work solves the problem of thickness limitation and solvent toxicity at the same time, and has guiding significance for future work. For ternary OPVs, the use of a single solvent requires the simultaneous dissolution of three components of the active materials, increasing the difficulty of solvent selection. A novel diphenylimidazole derivative (PTN) was designed and synthesized to apply in ternary OPV devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 13a and b).142 PTN works by its ordered stacking, facilitating the overlap between the donor and acceptor systems of PTB7 and PC71BM or PTB7-Th and PC71BM. It can accelerate the energy transfer between molecules (the energy diagram and energy processes are shown in Fig. 13c) and broaden the absorption spectrum due to its wide absorption (Fig. 13d). Therefore, a reasonable green solvent should not only dissolve these three components, but also not affect the interaction between PTN and the other two components. Through carefully selecting the solvent, they finally used a single-component solvent, ethylbenzene, as the treatment solvent, significantly achieving high PCEs of 11.44% for ternary OPVs based on the PTB7-Th:PTN:PC71BM system. Compared with binary OPVs with a PCE of 8.91%, it is an encouraging result that the PCE of the ternary system is 28.40% higher than that of the binary system. In comparison with small molecules, conjugated polymers have a more complex molecular structure and higher molecular weight, which makes conjugated polymers less soluble than smaller molecules. For all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), the donor and acceptor components of all-PSCs are all polymers, resulting in a more intricate phase separation mechanism and more difficult morphological adjustment, so the green solvent needs to be selected more rationally and carefully. A report showed that taking advantage of cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) as a generic solvent can achieve impressive performance all-PSCs with PCEs of more than 11%.71

Sometimes a single solvent cannot dissolve both the donor and the acceptor at the same time. In such cases, an effective method is to use a mixed solvent to obtain highly efficient green-solvent-processed OPVs.19,143–146 For example, Zhao et al.144 selected mixed eco-friendly solvent systems, tetrahydrofuran/isopropyl alcohol and o-xylene/1-phenylnaphthalene, for application in OPVs based on an efficient system of PBTA-TF:IT-M, yielding a high PCE of 13.1% by adopting the spin-coating method. Furthermore, as we discussed above, ternary OPV systems have higher requirements regarding the solvents used. Therefore, the use of mixed solvents can often meet the requirement that three components should easily dissolve in green solvents. For instance, a study revealed that a mixed solvent system of toluene/diphenyl ether was used to process P1:PC71BM:ITIC ternary OPV systems.145 The three components can easily dissolve in the mixed solvents and yield an active effect, finally obtaining a high PCE of 10.11%.
Overall, it is demonstrated that the method of selecting efficient and suitable green solvents can achieve high performance OPVs, where the performance comes close to or even surpasses that of OPV devices processed by halogenated solvents, which exhibits great promise towards large-scale commercialization. However, owing to the structure of donors and acceptors, it is difficult to find appropriate green solvents that can dissolve the donor and acceptor simultaneously, but suitable green solvents can be found for some donor and acceptor combinations. Therefore, it is required to take full advantage of the HSP principle to look for new and efficient green solvents. Moreover, combining the advantages of molecular design and reasonable solvent selection, purposefully designing and synthesizing new materials and then choosing applicable green solvents might be an efficient strategy, which can fully play to their advantages and avoid their disadvantages.
6. Conclusion and outlook
OPVs have been considered as a promising green-energy technology in the 21st century due to their unique and outstanding photoelectric properties. However, the large-scale commercialization of OPVs has been limited because most OPVs with high PCEs are processed in the presence of toxic organic solvents. Therefore, exploiting eco-friendly OPVs without of the use of toxic halogenated solvents is highly desired. Delightedly, three strategies for eco-friendly solvent-processed OPVs have been developed in the past few decades, including molecular design, nanoparticle ink technology and reasonable solvent selection. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent developments of the three methods, including the design philosophy, preparation technology and influence factors. These encouraging achievements provide great opportunities for the future large-scale commercialization of green-solvent processed OPVs.
Despite the great achievements, the exploration of green-solvent processed OPVs is still at the primary stage and many issues need special attention, which may influence their practical applications. Through rational structural design, different kinds of components such as electrolyte groups, polar groups or side chains and alkyl or alkenyl side chains can be introduced into the conjugated polymer or small molecule skeleton. This method can endow the products with strong designability and outstanding solubility. However, this strategy generally involves tedious synthesis and high cost, which is disadvantageous for the future large-scale commercialization process. Moreover, due to the presence of functional groups and side chains, the obtained PCEs are not satisfactory. Furthermore, the mechanism of this method has not been clearly studied, and the adverse effects of these groups and side chains have not been widely recognized so far. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel green-solvent-processable OPV materials with high performance and study the mechanism to fundamentally overcome the limitations, rather than simply attaching functional groups or side chains to the classical conjugated framework.
As for nanoparticle ink technology, it can be divided into miniemulsion and precipitation methods. The miniemulsion method is a universal approach and can be used to obtain stable nanoparticles dispersed in water. However, non-conductive surfactants remaining in the film will seriously hinder the charge transport, and affect the crystallization of the nanoparticle film. Consequently, the device performance in this case is much lower than that of the corresponding OPVs processed by halogenated solvents. In order to achieve high performance NP-OPV devices, it is necessary to get rid of the bondage of non-conductive surfactants, and look for new surfactants that can be completely removed or are conductive, such as surfactant Pluronic F127 and amphiphilic carbon quantum dots. In addition, the nanoparticles prepared by the precipitation method are unstable and easily aggregate. Thus they cannot be widely used in a variety of donor and receptor combinations. The direct synthesis of nanoparticles in green solvents by dispersion polymerization may be an effective way to overcome the limitations of the precipitation method.
Taking advantage of HSP analysis to filter potential green solvents for solution-processed BHJ OPVs has great superiority. Based on the HSP analysis, we can quickly find efficient green solvents that can be applied in the active layer to form a beneficial BHJ morphology. Compared with the two approaches mentioned above, this method is much easier for realizing high PCEs. However, it is difficult to find suitable green solvents that can easily dissolve both donor and acceptor materials. To solve the problem, combining structural design with solvent choice together may achieve conjugated materials with good solubility and high PCEs simultaneously. Despite the above issues, we believe that the methods introduced in this review will promote the development of other strategies for preparing novel green-solvent OPVs, from which more advanced eco-friendly OPVs with high performance can be expected in the near future.
