    , Accepted 26th June 2018First published on 26th June 2018AbstractThrough theoretical analysis, we study relevant properties of some molecular structures formed by oligothiophenes (T) and dioctylfluorenes (F) units, commonly employed in the fabrication of different kinds of optical and electronic devices. For so, we first consider F–(T)n–F molecules with different numbers of thiophene rings (n). Among other characteristics, we calculate the dipole moment change between the ground and excited state (Δμge), a quantity that greatly influences the exciton dissociation and charge carrier mobility. We show that the planarity of the ground state geometry correlates Δμge to the exciton binding energy (Eb), with higher Δμge's corresponding to lower Eb's when n > 3. We also unveil a relevant dependence of Δμge with the odd–even parity of n and that Δμge assumes higher values when the molecule is composed by bithiophene (instead of simple thiophenes) moieties in the syn-conformation (with the two heteroatoms pointing in the same direction). From molecules results, we then address larger systems, formed by different oligomers of F–T copolymers containing blocks of dioctylfluorenes and bithiophenes (T2). We systematic investigate their electronic and structural properties as function of the composition ratio between the T2 and F moieties. Similar to the molecules, we deduce that the magnitude of Δμge is higher for the syn conformer of the T2 unit. Moreover, the highest values of Δμge are achieved when the number of the T2 increases relative to a fixed number of the F units in the mer. Such behaviors are in agreement and actually can qualitative explain measurements in the literature on the quantum efficiency of charge carrier generation in F–T copolymers. The present findings can be helpful in designing novel materials with improved photoelectric responses.
1. Introduction
Conjugated polymers are essential components in a great variety of optoelectronic applications1–3 including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). A promising general strategy to enhance the performance of such broad class of devices is to use, as the active material, conjugated polymers formed by different sequences of donor–acceptor (D–A) moieties along the chain, leading to the so-called copolymers. They represent a great advantage since the copolymer sequence (in the form of alternating, gradient and random blocks4–6) considerably impacts the electrical, optical, thermal and morphologic properties of the full system. For instance, variations in the copolymer sequence enables the fabrication of (i) color tunable emitting layers in OLEDs and of (ii) OPVs displaying band gap gradients which better matches the solar spectrum. But despite all the progress in the last decades, making use of copolymers in optoelectronic devices,7 in many contexts6 it is still not clear how rearrangements and manipulations of the structural sequences of chemical moieties along the chain could qualitatively improve a specific optoelectronic property of the resulting copolymer.
Archetypal copolymers are those formed by blocks containing different numbers of fluorene and bithiophene units, namely, the fluorene–thiophene (F–T) copolymers. Their great diversity of combinations bears an enormous potential for applications, being the subject of intense research.4,8,9 For instance, they have color tuning properties (thus relevant for (i) above) as a function of the π-conjugation length. Also, F–T copolymers in diblock structures can be employed as active layers for chemical and biological sensors.10,11 The most studied F–T copolymer is the poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-bithiophene], commonly known as F8T2. Its structure alternates segments of dioctylfluorene and bithiophene, producing a material which can serve either as donor layers in OPVs12,13 or as hole transport layers in OFETs14,15 and OLEDs.16,17 Although the optoelectronic properties of the F8T2 are well known, how these properties modify for variations in the relative number of fluorene and bithiophene units is still an open question.
In a recent work8 the intramolecular hole transport in F–T copolymers synthesized with different number of oligothiophene units have been investigated. It has been found that an even number of oligothiophene units (2 and 4) increases the hole's intramolecular conductivity when compared to chains with an odd number (1 and 3). The phenomenon has been related to a higher planarity of the chains with an even number of oligothiophenes units. Another study18 has reported that the field effect mobility in naphthalenediimide–thiophene copolymers is also higher when the polymer has an even number of oligothiophenes (2 and 4). This also has been attributed to a higher degree of planarity of those chains.
In the same line, odd–even distinctions appear in molecules that combine electron-deficient end groups (acceptor) and an electron rich central group (donor) to form an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure.19,20 Using oligothiophene as the donor and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine as acceptor, it has been observed that molecules with an odd number of thiophenes (T) groups show higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in OPVs19 (reaching 10% for the molecule with 5 rings) compared to these with an even number of T moieties. This difference in the PCE is associated to a larger dipole moment change Δμge = |μe − μg| in the former case (for μe (μg) the dipole moment in the excited (ground) state). Indeed, a larger Δμge is a signature of excited states with greater intramolecular charge separation. But this last feature tends to decrease the exciton Coulomb binding energy,21 hence leading to an improved quantum efficiency in carrier generation. The usage of copolymers or molecules with higher Δμge's might constitute a relevant way to improve the performance of OPVs.22,23
As previously demonstrated in the literature,24,25 theoretical analysis is a valuable tool in exploring the main characteristics of thiophene based conjugated polymers and molecules. Thus, in trying to elucidate the effects described above, we perform quantum chemistry calculations of F–(T)n–F molecules formed by oligothiophenes and dioctylfluorenes. We address how the number of thiophene rings (n) influences the optoelectronic properties of the molecules. Among other characteristics, we calculate μg, μe and Δμge for the F–T–F systems. We show that an enhancement of Δμge is obtained when the bithiophene (instead of simple thiophenes) are in the syn-conformation (with the two heteroatoms pointing in the same direction). On the other hand, the anti-conformation of the bithiophene (with the two heteroatoms pointing in opposite directions) favors a decreasing of Δμge. This is in agreement with a recent work,26 where it has been observed that the copolymer F8T2 with greater proportion of bithiophenes in the syn-conformation leads to solar cells with higher efficiency.
Using results for the molecules as benchmark, we consider different oligomers of fluorene–thiophene copolymers containing blocks of dioctylfluorenes (F) and bithiophenes (T2). We present a systematic investigation of the electronic and structural properties of the calculated copolymers as a function of the composition ratio between the F and T2 moieties. We find that the frontier orbitals are basically centered on the T2 units of the oligomers. On the other hand, the number of F moieties in the mer induces higher torsional angles that shorten the effective π-conjugation length. Hence structures with lower F/T2 ratios tend to have lower energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Likewise the molecules, the Δμge of the block structures are also higher for the syn conformer of the T2 unit. In this conformation, Δμge increases when the number of T2 units increases for a fixed number of the F units in the mer. We mention that a careful analysis of the transient photoconductivity in F–T copolymer films using microwave conductivity (FP-TRMC) technique have show that the quantum efficiency of photocarrier generation (φ) tends to increase with increasing composition ratio of oligothiophene units.8 This is in agreement with the present findings since our calculations for the F–(T)n–F molecules suggests that higher values of Δμge are related to excitons displaying a weaker bound between the electron–hole pair. This effect would then improve φ.
As a final introductory comment, a series of conjugated copolymers derived from 9,9-dioctylfluorene (DOF) and 4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DBT) have been synthesized with different feed ratios of DOF to DBT.27 Thus, with the continuous development of new routes to the fabrication of conjugated polymers of the type discussed here,28 our theoretical study might be an important guideline to the engineering of distinct F–T copolymers aimed to fabrication of efficient optoelectronic devices.
2. Model structures and computational methods
The model molecules and oligomers have been built following the same protocol described in ref. 26. We have carried out successive geometry optimizations (using the semi-empirical PM329 method) as new repetition units were added to the structures. To check for the accuracy of the method, we have compared the calculated total length of an unsubstituted oligothiophene (α4T) molecule with actual crystallographic experimental data taken from ref. 30 (see ESI†). The comparisons have demonstrated a good convergence of this procedure.
Regarding the oligomers simulations, first the sequence of dioctylfluorene units have been oriented in an alternate form, yielding the lower energy conformation (Fig. S1, ESI†) also maximizing the interaction with a solvent. Second, the thiophene rings bounded to the dioctylfluorene have been oriented in way so to leave the sulfur atoms in the opposite side relative to the direction of the dioctyls chains linked to the fluorenes. This conformation stabilizes the resulting structure (Fig. S2, ESI†). And third, since the repetition units of the copolymers already contain many atoms (around 500 for the larger copolymers), for simplicity we have simulated the dimers of each copolymer.
For the copolymers optimized structures, we have performed single point simulations using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).31 We have tested distinct hybrid functionals and base functions. For each one of these sets, we have compared the obtained maximum absorption wavelength with experimental results of UV-vis measurements (Table S1, ESI†). We have found that in the best case, the difference between the calculated and experimental maximum absorption wavelength is around 10 nm. Then, among the methods leading to the above mentioned best agreement, we have chosen that with the lowest computational cost, which is just the B3LYP32/6-31G*. It is worth mentioning it is a very commonly employed method in the literature.33,34 Hence, with the B3LYP/6-31G* we have calculated the energy of the frontier orbitals, their spatial distribution and the electronic vertical transitions.
We also have implemented time-dependent PM3 (TD-PM3) calculations to optimize the geometry of the molecules and oligomers in the excited state. To ratify that the obtained structures indeed correspond to bonds lengths at the true energy minimum, we display the frequency analysis of F–(T)n–F molecules in the excited states. As it should be, we do not see any imaginary frequency (see ESI†). Then, we have used the resulting excited state geometry and performed a single-point TD-DFT calculation with B3LYP/6-31G* to find μe. The change of the dipole moment between the excited and fundamental states is given by Δμge = [(μgx − μex)2 + (μgy − μey)2 + (μgz − μez)2]1/2. We further have considered some distinct hybrid functionals and base functions, verifying that the same odd–even effect is always present in all the analyzed cases (Fig. S3, ESI†). All simulations have been done with the Gaussian09 package.35
3. Results
3.1 Molecules
First, we study some key features of A–D–A molecules that will serve as guidelines to understand related properties in more complex structures (Section 3.2). Fig. 1a shows the ground state optimized geometry of dioctylfluorene–(1–8)thiophene–dioctylfluorene (F–(T)n–F) molecules with a n number of thiophene (T) rings following an alternate orientation. In Fig. 1b we plot the respective values of |μg| = μg, |μe| = μe and Δμge for each molecule. In the excited state the oligothiophenes are in their planar quinoidal backbone,36 characterized by a reduction of the bond lengths in the ring (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). The excited state quinoid structure increases the rigidity of the chain due to the limited rotation around the C–C bonds between thiophene rings.20 There is an odd–even effect for μg and μe when n varies from 1 to 8. But the odd–even effect on Δμge is only verified when the number of thiophenes varies from 3 to 8. This is similar to the behavior observed in A–D–A molecules composed by oligothiophenes with 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine19 and is related to the system symmetry. Since the dipole moment of the thiophene ring is located on the ring's plane and oriented toward the sulfur atom, the dipole moments of adjacent T units oppositely oriented will tend to cancel out each other. Thus, the resulting dipole moment is smaller for an even number of T rings following an alternate sequence. Such effect is still more pronounced in the excited state (Fig. 1b) due to the higher planarity of the molecule which produces a nearly symmetric structure. In this case Δμge is of the same order of μg since μe is close to zero.
 Fig. 1  (a) Ground state geometry of molecules containing dioctylfluorene–(1–8)thiophene–dioctylfluorene. (b) The values of μg, μe, Δμge with increasing number of thiophene groups in the molecule. (c) The angular change between μg and μe with increasing number of thiophene groups in the molecule. 
On the opposite, there will always be an unpaired dipole moment when the chain is formed by an odd sequence of T rings. In this case μg and μe have approximately the same magnitude but different directions. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 1c displaying the variation of the angle between these vectors for an increasing number of T units in the molecule. Due to the higher torsional angles between the T rings in the ground state, μg is not on the plane of the thiophene units. In contrast, the torsional angles are very small in the excited state so that the μe is on the plane of the rings. The shift in the μe direction relative to μg gives higher values of Δμge.
To further investigate the odd–even effect produced by unpaired units of T rings, we repeat the above calculations for molecules formed by a sequence of alternate bithiophene (T2) units. We consider the dioctylfluorene–(1–4)bithiophene (syn)–dioctylfluorene (Fig. 2a) (F–(T2)n–F) molecule where a number n of T2 groups in the syn conformation are repeated along the chain with an alternate orientation. The optimized structure of these molecules are shown in Fig. 2a (the molecules with the same number of T rings but in the anti conformation are from 0.6 and 1.6 kcal mol−1 more stable than the molecules with the syn conformation of Fig. 2a). The idea is to use such results as a benchmark to study the odd-effect in F–T block copolymers.
 Fig. 2  The same as in Fig. 1, but for molecules containing dioctylfluorene–(1–4)bithiophene (syn)–dioctylfluorene. 
The previous odd–even behavior for μg, μe and Δμge in F–(T)n–F is similarly observed in the F–(T2)n–F molecules (see Fig. 2b), however now with higher variations in such quantities values. Indeed, the effect is amplified because the F–(T2)n–F molecules with an odd number of T2 groups have two unpaired dipole moments associated to each TH ring (see Fig. 2a), contrasting with just one dipole moment for the F–(T)n–F molecule with the same n. Moreover, Fig. 2c indicates that increasing Δμge are also linked to greater shifts in the directions of μg and μe. It has been observed in molecules19 and polymers22,23,37 that higher Δμge's are correlated with higher power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells. Then, F–(T2)n–F molecules formed by an odd number of T2 groups in the syn conformation would show better photovoltaic responses compared to the same kind of molecules with single thiophene units. These findings explain, e.g., the conclusions of a recent study26 using the F8T2 copolymer and the additive solvent DIO (1,8-diiodooctane): an enhanced solar cell power conversion efficiency is observed for systems with higher proportion of F8T2 in the syn-conformation compared to anti-conformation.
In order to check if the obtained results could be related to the lateral group of the dioctylfluorene, we repeat all the calculations replacing the octyl by methyl. The analysis shows that the odd–even trend is actually related to the thiophenes (see ESI†). Although we are addressing A–D–A molecules with thiophene as donor and dioctylfluorene as acceptor, we believe that the present effect might take place for other molecules of different acceptor groups38 or derivatives of thiophene rings with substituent lateral chains.
In Fig. 3 we plot the simulated molecules frontier orbitals energy and the respective energy gap (Egap) (assumed negative for convenience). The latter are taking from the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). As expected, the energy of the HOMO increases and LUMO decreases as the number of thiophenes (Fig. 3a) or bithiophenes (Fig. 3b) increases. As a consequence, because the higher delocalization of the electronic orbitals, Egap narrows for longer chains. An interesting features observed in Fig. 3 is that the F–(T2)n–F tend to have a slightly lower Egap than the F–(T)n–F molecules with the same number of thiophene rings. For instance, the molecule with 6 TH rings has an energy gap of 3.04 eV while Egap is 2.99 eV for the molecule with 3 T2 units.

Table 1 compares the calculated values of the HOMO energy for the F–(T)n–F molecules with the data in ref. 24 (measured in similar end-capped oligofluorene–thiophene molecules). One can see that there is a reasonable agreement between theory and experiment, although the B3LYP functional tends to give slightly lower values for the HOMO (as already discussed in other works33). Moreover, in ESI† we also contrast the HOMO energy and the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) for α4T and α5T oligothiophenes (calculated using our theoretical approach) with experimental data reported in ref. 30 and again we find a good compliance.

As already mentioned, different works suggest a relationship between high values of Δμge and a lower exciton binding energy (Eb). For instance, this connection has been proposed in a study19 involving A–D–A molecules containing oligothiophenes as the central donor unity. It has been verified a greater (lower) current density of photovoltaic devices with molecules containing 5 and 7 (4, 6 and 8) thiophenes. For our F–(T)n–F molecules, Eb can be estimated via DFT (but see also ref. 39) by subtracting the fundamental energy gap (Egap) from the optical gap (Eopt), as discussed in detail in ref. 40. The optical gap corresponds to the energy of the lowest electronic transition accessible via absorption of a single photon (obtained from TD-DFT calculations). The fundamental gap is defined as the energy difference between the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA). Actually, one must compare the molecules ground state (N – electrons) with the anion (N + 1 electrons) and cation (N − 1 electrons) states to determine, respectively, EA and IP. Then, IP = Etotal(cation) − Etotal(neutral) and EA = Etotal(neutral) − Etotal(anion).41 So, the cation and anion energies from this are derived in the ground state geometry of the neutral molecule, so that the vertical IP and EA are obtained. Here we should observe that recent42 simulations assuming different DFT functionals for a series of molecules have shown that a better agreement with experimental values of IP, EA and Eb is achieved when the DFT is implemented with long-range corrected hybrid GGA functionals, like the wB97XD.43
We therefore have followed the above prescription to calculate IP, EA and Eb for the F–(T)n–F molecules with n = 1–8. To reduce the computational time, we have replaced the octyl groups of the F moiety by smaller methyl groups. All calculations have been done using wB97XD/6-31+G** (for wB97XD/6-31G**, see ESI.† The use of diffuse functions for heavier atoms lead to a value for Eb differing in less than 1.7% of that for Eb calculated without those functions). We have not seen any particular trend in Eb for n = 1–3. On the other hand, for n = 4–8 (Fig. 4), Eb is smaller (higher) for an odd (even) number of thiophenes. Thus, is follows the variation of Δμge, corroborating ref. 19 and others.22,23 Although we have only considered molecules in the gas phase, the odd–even effect in Fig. 4 may also be present in the solid state. As mentioned in ref. 37, in this latter case eventual polarization of the surrounding molecules leads just to a generalized reduction in the gas phase value of Eb.
 Fig. 4  Binding energy, Eb, for dimethylfluorene–(4–8)thiophene (anti)–dimethylfluorene molecules calculated using wB97XD/6-31G**. 
An inspection in Table S5 (ESI†) indicates that the odd–even effect obtained for Eb comes from variations of Eopt which can suffer an energy shift depending on the number of thiophene rings (see Section 4). Also, in Table S6 (ESI†) one sees that the average dihedral angle between adjacent thiophene rings is higher (lower) for n even (odd). Hence, molecules with an odd number of T rings tend to become more planar, thus delocalizing the charge distribution along the chain and decreasing Eb. Here it is important to mention that the dihedral angles calculated for a gas-phase molecular structure are usually greater than those in solid-state (due to packing effects in the condensed phase30).
In Section 4 we will further discuss the physical origin of the Eb dependence on Δμge. We just advance that this can be related to the energy shift resulting from the interaction of Δμge with the electric field produced by the dipole moment of the HOMO → LUMO transition.
3.2 Copolymers
From the insights gained with the A–D–A molecules, we now study in details the properties of D–A block copolymers for dioctylfluorene as the donor and bithiophenes as the acceptor repeating units. The F–T oligomers are built with a sequence of bithiophene groups following an alternate orientation in both the syn- and anti-conformers of the T2 group. We also change the composition ratio of the oligomers by taking different numbers of dioctylfluorenes (from 1 to 3) for a fixed number of T2 groups in the mer. We identify the oligomers from the (a,b) notation (Fig. 5), where a is the number of dioctylfluorenes and b the number of bithiophenes in each mer (see Fig. 5). Since syn A–D–A molecules with 3 T2 groups show the higher Δμg, we next focus on simulating oligomers with 3 bithiophenes. However, in order to verify if the odd–even effect for Δμg still holds for longer structures, we also consider oligomers with 2 T2 groups. In this way, we calculate the properties of the (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) and (3,3) oligomers in the anti and syn conformations of the T2, in a total of 12 structures.

Fig. 6 shows the ground state optimized geometry and the respective spatial distribution of the HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals for the F–T oligomers considered in this work.
 Fig. 6  Front view of the optimized geometry and the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for the (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) and (3,3) copolymers for the anti and syn conformations (isovalues 0.01). 
Comparing the total energy of the ground state, the anti-conformer of the T2 group yields slightly more stable oligomers (by an average stabilization energy around 2.3 kcal mol−1) than the syn conformers. As a consequence, the chains with 3 bithiophenes have the higher differences in the total energy between the anti and syn conformations.
The molecular orbitals in Fig. 6 are centered around the thiophene units of the oligomers, especially for the (2,2), (2,3), (3,2) and (3,3) structures. For the (1,2) and the (1,3) structures, the orbitals are more evenly distributed along the backbone. Fig. 6 indicates that a higher number of dioctylfluorenes in the chain induces higher torsion angles which can break the conjugation length. This effect gives rise to more isolated molecular orbitals, limiting the intramolecular hole transport in chains with higher ratios of dioctylfluorene groups.8 There are no remarkable differences in the orbitals distribution between the anti and syn conformers with the same composition ratio. However, from the PM3 optimization method the anti-conformers are slightly more linear than the syn-conformers.

Table 2 shows the energy of the frontier orbitals and the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of each structure considered. It is clear that the syn conformation has a lower energy gap compared to the respective anti conformation. This can be explained by quantifying the planarity of the chain using the averaged dihedral angles between the dioctylfluorene–dioctylfluorene, dioctylfluorene–thiophene and thiophene–thiophene groups along the backbone.26 The results in Fig. 7d (more details in Table S14, ESI†) show that the average dihedral angles are smaller for the syn conformer. The higher degree of planarity obtained for the syn conformations decreases the HOMO–LUMO gap due to the longer delocalization of the frontier orbitals.

The values in Table 2 also indicate that the structures with a higher number of bithiophenes in the mer ((1,3), (2,3) and (3,3)) have considerably lower HOMO–LUMO energy gaps compared to oligomers with a lower number of T2 groups in the mer ((1,2), (2,2) and (3,2)). This is in agreement with the observation that the incorporation of electron-deficient T2 groups effectively reduces the polymer band gap.44 However, the computational cost associated to large number of atoms in each mer have forced us to perform calculations using dimers. To make sure that the observed trend is not just a simulation artifact (e.g., due to the limited number of repetition units considered in the calculations) we have done a linear extrapolation of the HOMO–LUMO gap45 in Fig. 7a–c. Relative to the values in Table 2, the extrapolated HOMO–LUMO gaps have smaller differences between the structures with three T2's compared with the structures with two T2's in the mer, a result consistent with real systems.46 The lowest extrapolated gap is that for the (1,3) copolymer, which has the higher ratio between T2 units and the dioctylfluorene group. Likewise, the higher energy gap comes from the (3,2) copolymer, which has the lower ratio between T2 and dioctylfluorene units. As mentioned before, the introduction of many dioctylfluorene moieties along the chain induces torsions along the chain that breaks the conjugation length.8 The plots in Fig. 7a–c also confirm that the syn conformation of the T2 group tends to have a slightly lower HOMO–LUMO gap than the anti conformation for the same oligomer structures.
It is possible to verify in Fig. 7d that there is a correlation between the average of the dihedral angles between the chemical species along the chain and the respective value of the extrapolated HOMO–LUMO energy gap: lower average dihedral angles give rise to lower energy gaps. Again, the higher degree of planarity increases the frontier orbitals delocalization along the chain, which reduces the energy gap.
The vertical electronic transitions of each structure are obtained from the TD-DFT method with B3LYP/6-31G*. They are shown in Fig. 8, where the height of the bars is proportional to the oscillator strength of each transition. Using this, Table 3 details the two strongest transitions calculated for the oligomers. One see that the HOMO → LUMO excitation is the major contribution to the strongest electronic transition for all the structures considered here. Since the HOMO and LUMO are both mainly localized around the T2 units, this transition does not have a strong charge transfer character. In addition, the highest oscillator strength of the HOMO → LUMO excitation is obtained for the structure with the lowest composition ratio between the T2 groups and dioctylfluorene units, the (1,3) oligomer (in the next section we compare our theoretical results with the literature).

From Fig. 8 we also see that the electronic transitions for the oligomers with three T2's groups are shifted to longer wavelengths compared to the structures with two bithiophenes groups. It is also clear that the transitions for the syn conformer are red shifted relative to the respective transitions for the anti conformer. This is similar to a behavior recently reported for the F8T2 copolymer.26

Fig. 9 shows the values of μg, μe and Δμge for each structure. It is interesting to note that the same odd–even behavior detected for the molecules with bithiophenes in the syn conformation (Fig. 2b) is present in the oligomers of Fig. 8a, c and e. Yet, here the odd–even effect for Δμge is considerably lower than those for the molecules in Section 3.1. This is because the larger size of the polymers. In the case of molecules, the geometry of the excited state provides a high planarity throughout its length. But for copolymers, the geometry of the excited state is not completely flat along its length (as shown in Fig. S10, ESI†). What makes the molecules flatter than the oligomers is the limited number of dioctylfluorenes in their structures. As discussed above, such groups induce higher torsion angles along the chain, diminishing the backbone's planarity. For instance, the (2,3)-syn and (3,3)-syn structures (that have dioctylfluorenes species in sequence) show considerable torsion angles even in the excited state.

The values of μg, μe and Δμge – calculated for the oligomers in the anti-conformation – in contrast do not show the odd–even effect (see Fig. 9b, d, and f). This should be expected since for those conformers there is always an even pair of thiophene rings along the chain. In agreement with the case of molecules, the values of μg, μe and Δμge of the oligomers with the T2 moiety in the syn-conformation are always greater than the respective values obtained when the bithiophenes are in the anti-conformation. Since it is believed that polymer systems with higher internal dipole moments need lower driving forces to effectively dissociate the excitons,44 the present theoretical analysis indicates that copolymers in the syn conformation of the T2 group would be more efficient as active donor layers in photovoltaic devices. This is consistent with a recent suggestion that an improvement of the F8T2 solar cells photovoltaic properties was due to an increase in the concentration of syn conformers of the T2 group induced by a treatment with a fluorine-based solvent additive.26
4. Discussion
In this section we shall briefly discuss our theoretical results in the light of some experimental data reported in the literature.47,48 In this respect, ref. 8 is specially useful since it involves a systematic experimental study of F–T copolymers synthesized with different number of T moieties. Such copolymers films have been measured8 through the FP-TRMC technique using a 355 nm laser as the excitation source. The results of special importance to us are those for the pFT4 polymers, which here correspond to the (1,2) oligomers. The maximum charge carrier generation efficiency at end-of-pulse (φ) – estimated by DC techniques – clearly tends to rise when the oligothiophene content is above 25% in the mentioned pFT4. It is important to note that such tendency is also followed by the other F–T structures in ref. 8. Our theoretical approach suggests an explanation to this behavior. It is clear from Fig. 9 that the magnitude of Δμge increases with the number of T2 units when the amount of F groups in the mer is constant. The results for the F–(T)n–F molecules in Fig. 4 indicates that high dipole moment variations upon photoexcitation are linked to lower exciton binding energies (in Table S16, ESI† we show the exciton binding energy for the (1,2)-syn and (1,3)-syn copolymers, such calculations confirm that Eb is always lower when Δμge is higher). Generalizing this to the every copolymers, larger Δμge's lead to easier charge separation, associated to a reduction in the electrostatic attraction between the in-chain electron–hole pair due to a larger separation distance.21 This effect, therefore, would help the intramolecular exciton dissociation (and the consequent photogeneration upon laser illumination). In this way, one can boost φ with the addition of more T2 units in the mer. We mention it has also been pointed out that the recombination lifetime between an electron transferred to TiO2 and the hole at the thiophene units increases with n after the photoexcitation of fluorene-thiophene molecular wires.49
Another relevant point is the improvement of the higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in OPV devices, related (among other things) to achieving adequate charge separation.50 It has already been observed in some copolymers that there is a linear correlation between Δμge and solar cell performance when other properties, such as charge carrier transport and film morphology, are comparable.23 The results for the F–(T)n–F molecules in Fig. 4 are in qualitative agreement with these observations. Our calculations indicate that large values of Δμge are associated to a reduction of the exciton binding energy. Recalling that the fundamental step for an efficient charge carrier generation in OPVs is the photoinduced electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor molecule, the reduction of Eb facilitates the molecular ion generation. In turn, this reduces the energy cost for the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor, auxiliating the dissociation process.23 Our findings thus shed some light on the intrinsic molecular mechanism underlying the interrelationship between Δμge and the PCE.
Actually, the key result in our work is the dependence of Eb on Δμge (evidenced in Fig. 4 and Table S5, ESI†), which can arise from the shift in the optical gap produced by the interaction between Δμge51,52 and the dipole moment of the HOMO → LUMO transition (μex). In the presence of an electric field Fex, the optical gap can undergo a Stark (St) shift,53 with Eopt = E0opt − Δμge·Fex, where E0opt is the optical gap for Δμge = 0. Assuming that the direction and orientation of Δμge is basically given by the dipole moment of the ground state, Table S7 (ESI†) shows the angle θ between Δμge and μex for the F–(T)n–F molecules. In Table S7 (ESI†), θ > 90° when n is even and θ < 90° when n is odd. If Fex is the electric field associated to μex, the St shift is then positive (negative) for n even (odd) since the angle between Δμge and Fex is α = 180° − θ (see the column corresponding to cosα in Table S7, ESI†). The exciton binding energy is determined from Eb = Egap − Eopt. In this way, a positive (negative) St shift of Eopt increases (decreases) Eb. This behavior then can explain the odd–even effect observed in Fig. 4.
5. Conclusions
In this work we have considered a two step approach to theoretically study (using quantum chemistry methods) molecular structures formed by oligothiophenes (T) and dioctylfluorenes (F). In a first step we have discussed F–(T)n–F molecules with the number of thiophene rings (n) increasing from 1 to 8. For each molecule we have calculated the dipole moment in the ground state (μg), the dipole moment in the excited state (μe) and the variation of the dipole moment between ground and excited states (Δμge). Δμge is a key property that helps exciton dissociation and the consequent charge carrier generation in organic semiconductors. Our calculations indicate that there is an opposite trend for the dipole variation and the exciton biding energy (Eb), so that higher Δμge corresponds to lower Eb when n > 3. We have found that Δμge has higher (lower) magnitudes when n is odd (even). The enhancement of Δμge for an odd number of thiophene units can be attributed to the lower symmetry of those molecules that necessarily have an unpaired dipole moment belonging to a single T ring.
Searching for instances further increasing Δμge, we have considered molecules where the T units are replaced by bithiophene (T2) units. In these F–(T2)n–F structures, the number of T2 blocks (n) in the syn conformation increases from 1 to 4 (following a sequence of alternating orientations). The Δμge of F–(T2)n–F molecules also shows an odd–even effect with n (high values for n odd and lower values for n even), but with stronger magnitude variations compared to F–(T)n–F systems.
Using these results as reference, we have discussed different oligomers of F–T copolymers containing blocks of dioctylfluorenes and bithiophenes. We have checked the influence of the composition ratio between the F and T2 moieties on the chain's planarity, HOMO–LUMO energy gap, main electronic transitions, and μg, μe and Δμge values. We have observed that the planarity of the chain decreases when the mer are formed by blocks with rising number of F units. As a consequence, the effective conjugation length tends to shorten, so increasing the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of long chains. Finally, we have found that the oligomers with 3 syn-T2 units display higher dipole moments than the oligomers with 2 syn-T2 units. This is a signature of the odd–even effect found in the F–(T2)n–F molecules.
One important finding, with potential practical interest for the development of OPV devices, is that Δμge tends to increase when the number of T2 units in the mer increases (for a fixed block of the F units). But a larger Δμge seems to facilitate the intramolecular electron–hole (exciton) separation. Hence, this suggests a higher charge carrier generation in copolymers with a greater content of T units relative to the F units in the mer. This result is in close agreement with measurements of the quantum efficiency of charge carrier generation in F–T copolymers.
Finally, we have demonstrated that subtle changes in the composition ratio of the copolymers mer can have huge impacts on the properties of the resulting system. Just to highlight a particular point, we find that the variation of one T2 ring group (keeping the same number of F units) in the mer can increase Δμge by 120% (as it has been observed in the (3,2)-syn to (3,3)-syn oligomers). Such kind of information may be fundamental in designing new materials. For instance, it is well known that the addition of thiophene rings in the chain decreases the polymer solubility. Thus, our study can give some guidance on how to tune the ratio of F and T moieties in order to obtain optimal light harvesting and charge transport properties without severely compromising the use of standard fabrication techniques as solution-based deposition methods for the resulting materials.
