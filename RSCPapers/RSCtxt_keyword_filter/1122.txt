    , Accepted 26th September 2014First published on 30th September 2014AbstractTen porphyrin sensitizers with different electron-withdrawing groups derived from the best sensitizer SM315 were investigated by means of the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations. To this end, major factors affecting the performance of the cell, including light harvesting, electron injection, dye regeneration, and conduction band energy shift are taken into consideration. Especially, the calculated distance (r) from the electron recapture center to the semiconductor surface is used to probe the charge recombination process. In addition, considering the complexity of the porphyrin sensitizers' absorption, the maximum short circuit current density (Jmaxsc) is determined for investigating the light harvesting ability quantitatively. We find that when compared to SM315 with 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, 1 with naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole shows better performance due to both larger Jmaxsc and r, and 7 with diketopyrrolopyrrole could also be a promising candidate due to the much larger Jmaxsc and comparable r.
Introduction
As one of the most efficient photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been receiving attention all over the world due to their easy fabrication, low cost and relatively higher power conversion efficiency (η) since the first report by Grätzel in 1991,1 especially when the fossil fuel sources are fast depleting and serious environmental hazards have been caused. Recently, an exciting breakthrough has been achieved in this field when a record efficiency of 13% has been reported using a single push–pull porphyrin dye SM315 combined with cobalt redox mediators,2 highlighting its potential as a promising alternative to the traditional expensive silicon-based solar cells. However, the efficiency of the DSSCs is still not high enough for the application purpose and further improvement of the efficiency is still of great significance.
Currently, scientists have made tremendous efforts in seeking new and efficient dyes suitable for practical use in DSSC to further improve the efficiency, considering the key role of the dyes played in the solar cell. There is no doubt that porphyrin dyes are the stars among the sensitizers used in DSSCs due to their intrinsic light harvesting ability and photochemical stability.3 Importantly, porphyrin dyes have intense absorption at 400–450 nm (Soret band) and a moderately intense absorption band at 500–650 nm (Q band). Moreover, there are so many functionalization sites, including four meso and eight β positions, which make it easy to tune the photophysical and electrochemical properties. This could also circumvent the limitations of Ru-based dyes, such as rarity and environmental issues,3,4 Most porphyrin dyes adopt a push–pull structure, and an efficiency of 10% has been achieved through a push–pull structured porphyrin dye YD-2.5 It has been demonstrated that the push–pull structure could facilitate electron injection due to the directional electron transfer from the donor site to the acceptor site along the push–pull system, and the elongation of the π conjugation and loss of symmetry could also cause broadening and a red shift of the absorption bands in porphyrin dyes.4,6–8 However, some drawbacks still need to be resolved. One is the absorption vacancy between the Soret and Q bands, and the other is the limited absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) of the solar spectrum, which could greatly decrease the light harvesting abilities, given that sunlight possesses 50% of its irradiation energy in the infrared spectral region. Actually, co-sensitization has been proposed as an efficient strategy to resolve this issue. Two years ago, a power conversion efficiency of 12.3% was achieved through the co-sensitization of push–pull porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 and pure organic dye Y123 with cobalt redox mediators.9 Unfortunately, this co-sensitization suffers from a complicated device optimization and fabrication process, which could significantly retard large-scale implementation. Therefore, a porphyrin dye with a panchromatic light harvesting response is highly desirable.
Despite the great efforts conducted,4,10,11 no significant progress has been made during the past two years until Mathew et al. demonstrated that insertion of an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) between the π linker and the acceptor part could significantly broaden and red shift the absorption spectrum of a push–pull porphyrin dye and thus lead to a record efficiency of 13% without resorting to co-sensitization.2 The structures of the porphyrin dye SM315 with the record efficiency and its prototype dye SM371 are shown in Fig. 1. Experimental and computational details on these two dyes are listed in ref. 2. This success gives us a hint that further improvement of the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs could be achieved through a rational molecular design of new porphyrin dyes with good light harvesting abilities, and also tells us the EWG plays an important role in enhancing the light harvesting ability of push–pull porphyrin dyes.

Following this strategy and considering that a lot of EWGs have been tried in the polymer solar cells and organic D–A–π–A structure motif dyes to red-shift the absorption spectra, people may want to know which EWG is the best for this series of porphyrin dyes, which also arose our interest. However, there is no doubt that this would be time- and cost-consuming when using the conventional experimental approaches, not only because it is hard to synthesize unsymmetrical porphyrins dyes,4,12 but also due to subsequent deep analysis. Fortunately, the low cost and efficient computational protocols have been set up to qualitatively (or even quantitatively) identify the properties of each component of DSSC and even their assembly due to the appealing performance of DFT-based methods.13–18 Lots of theoretical investigations have been successfully devoted to the explanation of experimental results,19–22 clarifying the elementary process,23,24 and predicting the performance of new components in DSSC.25–28 In our work, with the purpose of further improving the light harvesting ability of porphyrin dyes, a series of theoretical possible porphyrin dyes with different EWGs (shown in Fig. 2) derived from the prototype dye SM315 were designed and analysed with the commonly used computational protocol. Considering the working principle of DSSC, despite the absorption spectra of the isolated dyes, the nature of vertical excited states,29 charge injection and recombination process,30 as well as the electronic structures of the dye–semiconductor system,31 which were proven to be key factors affecting the performance of the porphyrin dyes, were also taken into consideration in our work. And through these theoretical parameters we could pre-screen some possible candidates with desired properties. Even though these designed porphyrin dyes with promising properties in our work are challenging to be synthesized at the present stage, we hope our work could give some fundamental guidelines to the experimentalists and further improve the performance of porphyrin-based DSSCs.

Computational details
We optimized the ground state (S0) geometries of the porphyrin dyes under investigation at M0632/6-31G*33,34(LANL2DZ35–37 for Zn atom) level in TetraHydroFuran (THF) solvent, which has been proven to be suitable for the geometry optimization of this porphyrin dye by Mathew et al.2 The solvent effect of THF was taken into account by means of the default polarizable continuum model (PCM),38 using the nonequilibrium version of the IEF-PCM model. And the frequency calculations were carried out at the same level of theory as geometry optimization to confirm the optimized geometries are under stable points. The frontier molecular orbital energies were calculated in THF solvent by single point PCM-M06/6-311G** calculations with optimized structures. To see the intrinsic electron-withdrawing ability of the EWGs under study, the frontier molecular orbital energies of these fragments were calculated at the same level of theory as the whole molecule after the optimization. To provide insight into the absorption properties of porphyrin dyes, after the functional test (vide infra), time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were performed on S0 geometries at the PCM-TD-M06/6-31G*(LANL2DZ for Zn atom) level in THF solvent by computing the lowest 20 singlet–singlet excitation energies. The absorption spectra of all dyes were simulated with the Multiwfn program,39,40 using Gaussian functions with FWHM (full width at half maximum) of 0.3 eV. All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package.41 For the sake of simplicity, the alkyl groups in SM315 were replaced by methyl groups for geometry optimization.
To determine the conduction band energy shift (ΔECB) due to the adsorption of the sensitizer, the most commonly used (TiO2)38 cluster obtained by ‘cutting’ an anatase slab exposing the majority (101) surface was used to model the TiO2 nanoparticle effects as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†42 Consistent with the experimental results revealed by the Fourier transform infrared spectra, the push–pull porphyrin dyes adsorb on the surface through the bidentate binding mode. The optimization of dye/(TiO2)38 systems was performed using the SIESTA ab initio package,43–45 the reliability of which has been proved by lots of related investigations and could give a good balance between accuracy and computational cost.46–53 The computational details about SIESTA are given in the ESI.† Based on the optimized geometries, the partial density of states (PDOS) profiles on TiO2 were evaluated at the PCM-M06/SVP level of theory through single point calculations using the Gaussian code.
Results and discussion
As we know, the conversion efficiency of a solar cell mainly depends on the photocurrent density (Jsc) and the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), thus there is no doubt that the properties related to these factors could affect the performance of the cell. In the following we will investigate how the EWGs affect these properties.
EWG effects on the geometry structure, energy alignment and electronic structure
First of all, some basic requirements for the dyes should be fulfilled to make sure the solar cell could operate normally no matter the efficiency is low or high. For example, there should be a driving force to guarantee electron injection and dye regeneration. Thus, we first optimize the ground state geometries of these porphyrin dyes and then we want to evaluate whether the designed dyes fulfil this energetic requirement through calculating the energy level of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). The optimized molecular structures are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The dihedral angle between the EWG and the acceptor part (benzoic acid) is also listed in Fig. S2 (ESI†) to see the EWG effect on the conjugation degree, which is also a key factor affecting the performance of the dyes. We find that compared to SM315 (37.23°), the designed dyes 5 (4.35°), 6 (18.60°), 7 (26.96°) and 10 (0.70°) present a smaller dihedral angle, indicating a superior conjugation degree due to the smaller steric hindrance. This favorable conjugation of designed dyes could facilitate the delocalization of FMOs and thus is beneficial for the red shift of absorption. On the contrary, the designed dyes 2 (45.67°), 4 (46.95°) and 9 (46.15°) have an inferior conjugation degree due to the larger dihedral angle. Dyes 1 (37.75°), 3 (30.97°) and 8 (39.06°) show similar dihedral angles, implying a similar conjugation degree of these dyes. As a result, it is obvious that the EWG has a remarkable influence on the conjugation degree of the spacers in the push–pull structured porphyrin dyes.
The distributions of FMOs of these designed dyes as well as SM315 are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Apparently, they have similar highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) distribution, and the electron densities are mostly localized on the donor and porphyrin linker part, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are mainly localized on porphyrin, EWG fragment and acceptor part. From the FMOs distributions, we can reasonably infer that the excited state of these dyes may be of intramolecular charge transfer character. Moreover, we find these designed dyes all have electron distributions on the anchor group –COOH, which is beneficial for the electron coupling between the sensitizer and the semiconductor. The energy of FMOs under the same theoretical level is shown in Fig. 4(a). Apparently, the designed porphyrin dyes all have more positive LUMO energy and negative HOMO energy in comparison with the corresponding conduction band energy of TiO2 (−4.0 eV)54 and [Co(bpy)3]n+ redox shuttle (−5.06 eV),55 indicating that they could guarantee electron injection and dye regeneration. Moreover, we find that the EWG could also affect the HOMO–LUMO gap, which is in close relationship with the light harvesting properties. We could anticipate that as compared to SM315, 1, 6 and 7 could show red shifted absorption spectra due to the smaller HOMO–LUMO gap, which is conducive to enhancing light harvesting. We know that both the conjugation degree and electron-withdrawing ability of EWGs could affect the LUMO energy of these porphyrin dyes. After the conjugation analysis we calculated the LUMO energies of these isolated EWGs to see the electron-withdrawing ability of these moieties at the same level of theory with the whole molecule as shown in Fig. 4(b). The more negative the LUMO energy of the EWG, the stronger the electron-withdrawing ability is. It is clear that the EWGs in 1 have stronger electron-withdrawing ability than BTD in SM315, and EWGs in 4, 6, 7 and 9 have similar electron-withdrawing ability to BTD, while other EWGs have weaker electron-withdrawing ability. Thus we know that compared to SM315, 1 has more negative LUMO energy due to the larger conjugation planar and stronger electron-withdrawing ability for naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTD) than that of the BTD fragment. As for dyes 6 with thienopyrazine (TPZ) and 7 with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), the more negative LUMO energy is mainly attributed to the superior conjugation degree discussed above.

EWG effects on the absorption properties
There is no doubt that the light absorption property of the sensitizer is one of the most important factors affecting the performance of the cell. It has been demonstrated that the better the spectrum matching between the sensitizer's absorption and the solar photon flux spectrum, the larger the Jsc is. Thus, next we will consider the EWG effects on the absorption properties of these porphyrin dyes. It is well known that the choice of a suitable functional is exceedingly important to accurately determine the excitation energies.56–58 Thus we did a functional test on the experimentally synthesized molecule SM315,2 from which ten other porphyrin dyes with different EWGs were designed. Some representative functionals such as B3LYP,59 M06,32 MPW1K,60 CAM-B3LYP,61 LC-ωPBE,62–65 and ωB97XD66 were taken into consideration with the 6-31+G* basis set. Moreover, considering that the experimental data of the absorption spectrum for SM315 was measured in THF,2 in order to justify the reliability of our theoretical methods through comparing the calculation results with the experimental results, we also compute the absorption properties of dyes in THF using a default polarizable continuum model (PCM) implemented in Gaussian 09, in line with the experiment. The results of the functional test are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It is clear that B3LYP with a low HF exchange percentage significantly underestimates the first transition energy (1.60 eV for B3LYP and 1.86 eV for the experiment), while MPW1K with a high HF exchange percentage overestimates the first transition energy (2.01 eV for MPW1K). As for the commonly used range separated functionals—CAM-B3LYP, LC-ωPBE, ωB97XD—although they could give a good description on the first transition energy (1.99 eV for CAM-B3LYP, 1.89 eV for LC-ωPBE, 1.98 eV for ωB97XD), the shape of the absorption spectrum, especially for the absorption between the Soret and the Q band, were not well presented. Considering the overall agreement between the simulated absorption and the experimental spectrum is crucial for determining the light harvesting ability, we think M06 is better than other functionals. The results given by meta-hybrid xc-functional M06 are in good agreement with the available experimental data (see Table S1, ESI†), both the absorption shape and transition energy are in line with the conclusion of Mathew et al.2 Moreover, the diffuse functions effects on the transition properties were also investigated, the calculating results are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†). We find that the diffuse functions have negligible effects on the transition properties, no matter the transition energy (discrepancies less than 0.1 eV, about 5 nm red-shifted) or the transition nature. Considering adding the diffuse function could significantly improve the computational cost and reliability of the basis set without the diffuse functions, which has also been proven by lots of theoretical investigations on porphyrin dyes' absorption properties.67–69 We employ the PCM-TD-M06/6-31G*(LANL2DZ for Zn atom) theoretical level for subsequent absorption investigations, which is a reliable and computationally inexpensive approach for this class of push–pull porphyrin dyes. Nevertheless, it should be noted that for the use of a continuum solvent model (PCM),38,70 which has been proven to give a good description of the bulk solvent effect,16 the explicit solute–solvent interactions are neglected. In fact, the nucleophilic ligands such as THF used in our system, could also approach the central zinc to form coordinate bonds, which may change the geometries of the dyes and thus the electronic properties of the whole molecule as studied by Yang.71 In our study, this effect was not taken into consideration. The reason why we could well reproduce the experimental results using the PCM model may be because the steric hindrance effect of the long alkoxyl chains at the ortho positions of the meso-phenyls (see Fig. 1) could efficiently prevent the approach of the THF. However, if the protic solvents (such as ethanol and methanol) were used in the experiment, the hydrogen-bonding should be considered in the theoretical calculations to reproduce well the experimental results as investigated by Pastore et al.56,72
The simulated absorption spectra of the porphyrin dyes with different EWGs are shown in Fig. 5(a and b). These dyes with different EWGs are classified into two kinds: designed dyes 2–5, 8–10 have similar absorption in the Soret band with respect to SM315 and blue-shifted absorption in the Q-band, whereas dyes 1, 6 and 7 have red-shifted absorption in the Q-band. Considering that our purpose is to further enhance the light harvesting of the porphyrin dyes in the near-infrared region, we focus on dyes 1, 6 and 7 in the following. The computed transition energies (Ex), wavelength (λ), oscillator strength (f), transition nature and configurations for the main excitations of these dyes with inferior absorption properties are collected in Table S2 (ESI†). As for dyes SM315, 1, 6 and 7, the simulated absorption spectra together with the corresponding calculating results are shown in Fig. 6. In addition, the electronic density difference (Δρ) between the corresponding ground state and excited states is also plotted to characterize the transition nature of the main bands. It should be noted that the most commonly used solvent for DSSCs is acetonitrile (ACN). Although for the purpose of fast screen efficient dyes, instead of the absolute values we prefer to get the trend of the corresponding properties, we still compute the absorption spectra of these dyes in ACN with the optimized geometries in ACN using the same theoretical level to give more guidelines for the experimentalist (the reliability of the geometries of these dyes in ACN were verified by the following frequency calculations) as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the solvation effect of ACN was also taken into account by means of the default polarizable continuum model (PCM). Apparently, they are almost the same as the absorption spectra simulated in THF. Taking SM315 for example, a detailed analysis for different solvents is listed in Table S3 and Fig. S7 (ESI†). We find that this solvation effect (THF or ACN) has a negligible influence on the electronic structures of SM315. We believe that the trend of following properties based on the electronic structures of the dyes discussed in the THF should also be available in the ACN.

The gray line represents the matching degree between the absorption spectrum of each dye and the photon flux for AM1.5 irradiation. (Electron densities move from the blue area to the green area with an iso-surface value of 0.01 au.) 
As shown in Fig. 6, the strong absorption peak in the first region (Q-band) for these dyes all arise from S0–S1, which mainly corresponds to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO. Through the electronic structure analysis discussed above, we know that there should be an intramolecular CT when the transition occurs, which is favorable for the electron injection. From the Δρ plots, we could find that the decreasing electron density zone mainly localizes on the electron donor and porphyrin segment, while the increasing electron density mainly localizes on the EWG and electron acceptor, which is indicative of an intramolecular CT when the transition occurs, agreeing well with the electronic structure analysis. Moreover, in order to measure the photoinduced electron–hole separation, the charge transfer index (DCT) proposed by Ciofini et al.,73,74 which represents the length of the charge transfer, is also determined to characterize this charge transfer transition. DCT were calculated with the Multiwfn code and more details about DCT can be found in ref. 73 and 74. As compared with SM315 (5.12 Å), we find that 1 shows an enhanced CT character (7.15 Å) due to the larger DCT (7.15 Å) for this transition, implying that it could provide more efficient charge separation, while 6 and 7 show a similar charge transfer character (4.90 Å for 6 and 5.12 Å for 7). We also find that the introduction of different EWGs in the molecular structure exerts a remarkable influence on both λ and the corresponding f for the Q-band. In particular, it should be noted that compared with SM315, 1, 6 and 7 present a red shift by 49, 46 and 59 nm for this absorption, in good agreement with the above energy gap discussion.
As for the absorption in the Soret band of these dyes, dyes 1 and 6 show a similar absorption band to SM315, they all have mainly two transitions appearing at this band with a little change in both the wavelength and f, and the Δρ plots demonstrate that this absorption also corresponds to a CT character. In contrast, dye 7 shows a much lower and narrower absorption band. Could the enhanced absorption in the Q band compensate for its lower absorption in the Soret band for the designed dye 7? We need to find a way to quantitatively evaluate the light harvesting of dyes with complicated absorption.
According to the equation determining Jsc:  where φph.AM1.5G is the photon flux for AM1.5 irradiation as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency, which could be determined by LHE = 1–10−Γσ(λ),75Γ and σ are the surface loading of the sensitizers (mol cm−2) grafted onto the semiconductor and the absorption cross-section (cm2 mol) of sensitizers, respectively. If we assume that the porphyrin dyes under study have the same electron injection efficiency Φinj, dye regeneration efficiency ηreg, and charge collection efficiency ηcoll, and take them as 1, we could get the maximum short circuit current density (Jmaxsc), which could quantitatively reflect the matching degree between the absorption spectra of the dyes and the sun's radiation spectrum (gray line in Fig. 6) and determine the light harvesting ability of the dyes with complicated absorption. The calculated Jmaxsc of these dyes are also listed in Fig. 6, assuming the adsorbed dye concentration is 8.35 × 10−7 mol cm−2.2 For dyes 1 and 6, they show higher Jmaxsc as compared to SM315, which indicates that they have a better light harvesting ability. For 7, it also has a superior light harvesting ability than that of SM315, namely the good absorption in the Q-band could compensate for the relatively weak Soret-band absorption.
EWG effects on the electron injection and dye regeneration
Actually, in a real system, solar cells with just different dyes could show different Φinj, ηreg, and ηcoll.30,76 Previous studies have demonstrated that Φinj is related to the driving force of the electron injection (ΔGinj) and ηreg is mainly determined by the driving force for regeneration (ΔGreg). As for ηcoll, besides the properties of the semiconductor, it also depends on the charge recombination extent. In the following, we will discuss how the EWGs affect these properties and thus the performance of the cell. First, we calculate the key parameters for deducing the driving force of the electron injection (ΔGinj) and dye regeneration (ΔGreg), including the ground state oxidation potential (EOxDye) and excited state oxidation potential (EOxDye*) as listed in Table 1. According to Koopmans's theorem, here we take the HOMO energies of these sensitizers as EOxDye, and Ex is the vertical transition energy. Thus ΔGinj and ΔGreg are calculated according to the following equations:77,78  The conduction band energy of TiO2 is taken as −4.0 eV54 and the oxidation potential of the [Co(bpy)3]n+ redox shuttle is taken as −5.06 eV.55 From Table 1, we could find that as compared to SM315, these designed dyes have similar ΔGreg due to the similar HOMO energy, indicating the comparable ηreg as compared to SM315. As for ΔGinj, although these designed dyes show a little smaller ΔGinj for the electron injection due to the smaller excitation energy, Islam et al. have demonstrated that when ΔGinj is above 0.2 eV, Φinj will be close to the unit.79 As a result, we could predict that the designed dyes have comparable Φinj and ηreg as compared to SM315.

EWG effects on the charge recombination
Lots of experimental investigations have demonstrated that the electron recapture by the oxidized dyes adsorbed on the semiconductor, which is in close relationship with the molecular structure of the sensitizer, could significantly affect the performance of the cell, especially Voc of the cell.80,81
Taking SM315 and SM371 for example (shown in Fig. 1), they have similar molecular structure with just one BDT difference, but the photoinduced absorption spectrum measurement shows that the electron recapture by the oxidized dye SM315 is much faster than that of SM371, which could lead to a decrease in Voc of about 50 mV. Fortunately, the loss in Voc could be compensated by the gain in Jsc, which leads to the superior performance of SM315. How does this happen? What is the relationship between this charge recombination process and the molecular structure?
Considering the working principle of the DSSC, we know that after photoexcitation, the sensitizers adsorbed on the TiO2 film inject the electrons into the semiconductor (TiO2) conduction band (CB) and become oxidized. Then the oxidized sensitizer could either regenerate by the redox couple in the electrolyte or reduce by the electrons in the CB (charge recombination process).3 For this charge recombination process, the electrons in the CB would go to the HOMO (cation hole as discussed by Durrant and co-workers82) of the oxidized sensitizer, which has a lower energy than the CB of TiO2 (thermodynamically feasible) and generally exists in the DSSC working process. Durrant and co-workers have shown that the distance (r) between the cation hole of the D–π–A structured sensitizer and the semiconductor surface plays a key role in determining this electron recapture process.82 The larger r is, the slower the charge recombination is. Thus, following this strategy, we calculate this distance as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) to see the difference of the charge recombination process. The distance is obtained by the product of the percentage contribution of each atom to the HOMO orbital and the corresponding distance from each atom of oxidized dye to the semiconductor surface. We find that SM315 has much larger r (20.44 Å) than that of SM371 (16.38 Å) due to the insertion of the EWG, which means that the cell sensitized by SM315 should have slower charge recombination than that of SM371. However, this is in conflict with the experimental results. How does the EWG affect the charge recombination process?
Yella et al. found that the direct connection of the BTD group to the anchor group could accelerate the electron recapture by the oxidized sensitizer, and the insertion of a phenyl spacer could retard this process, which phenomenon has also been found by Haid et al.83,84 Evidence from these experimental works demonstrated the effect of the electron-withdrawing group on accelerating the conduction-band electron recapture process,2,83,84 and we also find that there are distributions on the EWG of the cation hole of these dyes as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Thus we think it is possible that the electrons could pass through the EWG to go to the donor, which also means that the insertion of the EWG in the acceptor part could be seen as the centre of the electron recapture, as shown in Fig. 7. The farther this center from the surface, the slower the electron recapture is. That is why SM315 has a faster charge recombination rate than that of SM371. So for the dyes with EWG, it is better to consider the distance between the electron recapture center to the semiconductor surface. We take a simple model proposed by Meng et al.53 (shown in Fig. S11, ESI†) to calculate this distance for the dyes under study with different EWGs. The calculated r for designed dyes is listed in Fig. 8, and in the order of 1 > SM315 ≈ 7 > 6. Thus, we could predict that 1 could show retarded charge recombination as compared to SM315 due to the larger r, and 7 could show comparable charge recombination with respect to SM315. Unfortunately, dye 6 could show a little faster charge recombination due to the smaller r. There is no doubt that EWGs have great influence on the charge recombination process. It should also be noted that there is another electron loss channel in DSSCs, which is the charge recombination between the injected electrons in the conduction band and the electron acceptors in the electrolyte. That is closely related to the local concentration of the electron acceptors in the proximity of the semiconductor surface and could be affected by the structure of the sensitizer and additives in the electrolyte.80,81 Considering that the sensitizers under study have a similar structure and the same experimental conditions, they are supposed to have a similar packing mode on the semiconductor surface and thus a similar extent of this charge recombination process in the cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle.85

EWG effects on the conduction band energy shift
Apart from the charge recombination process, the conduction band energy shift (ΔECB) is also an important factor which could significantly affect the Voc of the cell. It has been accepted that the ΔECB of the cell could be affected by the structure of the dyes adsorbed on the semiconductor surface due to combined effects of the electrostatic potential generated by the sensitizer on the TiO2 surface, such as the dye dipole moment, and the charge transferred from the dye to TiO2 through dye-semiconductor chemical interactions.86 Following the strategy proposed by De Angelis et al.,86 the ΔECB induced by the sensitizer adsorption was extracted through calculating the density of state (DOS) and partial DOS profiles on TiO2 at M06/SVP level in acetonitrile solvent as shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. S12 (ESI†). We also calculated the corresponding properties of SM371, which has been demonstrated to have similar ΔECB to SM315 based on an experimental measurement of the capacitance as a function of Voc, to check the reliability of our theoretical method. From the results, we found that the adsorption of the sensitizer could induce the shift of the CB, but the extent of the CB shift is not largely affected by the EWGs. These porphyrin dyes with different EWGs including the experimentally reported dyes SM315 and SM371 have similar ΔECB, implying a negligible influence of EWGs on ΔECB.

The dotted lines are a linear fit of DOS within the 20–80% range and intercept with the energy axis, which corresponds to the calculated CB edges. 
Conclusions
In this work, we present a systematic theoretical study on a series of push–pull porphyrin dyes with different electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in comparison with the champion dye SM315 to screen high-performance candidates. After establishing the possibilities of being efficient dyes through the analysis of electronic structures, the key factors affecting the performance of the dyes, including light harvesting and charge recombination were evaluated through calculating the maximum photocurrent density (Jmaxsc), and the distance from the electron recapture center to the semiconductor surface (r). We find that the LUMO energy of these porphyrin dyes could be affected significantly by the conjugation degree between the EWG and the anchor group and the electron-withdrawing abilities of these EWGs, which could lead to a changed HOMO–LUMO gap, thus affecting the absorption properties. In addition, we find that although the EWG has negligible effects on the conduction band energy shift, it could affect r and thus change the extent of charge recombination. The results demonstrated that designed dyes 1 with naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole and 7 with diketopyrrolopyrrole could show better performance due to the better light harvesting and slower or comparable charge recombination as compared to SM315. As for 6 with thienopyrazine, it is also worth to have a try in the experiment due to the larger Jmaxsc as compared to SM315, although a slightly smaller r.
