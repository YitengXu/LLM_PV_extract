    , Accepted 21st July 2017First published on 21st July 2017Abstractp-Type nc-Si (p-nc-Si) films have been optimized under low growth temperature (∼180 °C) and low power (∼30 W) parametric conditions in 13.56 MHz RF-PECVD. At elevated gas pressure (p), the growth rate enhances; however, the optical band gap reduces. At optimum p = 2.5 Torr, a p-nc-Si window-layer possessing high crystallinity, large grain size, high electrical conductivity, wide optical band gap and a preferred 〈220〉 crystallographic orientation of the nanocrystallites is obtained. Single p–i–n junction nc-Si solar cells in superstrate configuration have been realized with reasonably acceptable conversion efficiency, η ∼ 7.05%. The preferred 〈220〉 oriented (I〈220〉/I〈111〉 ∼ 1.68) highly crystalline (XC ∼ 86%) p-nc-Si window-layer minimizes the lattice mismatch at the p/i-junction, facilitates the growth of proper crystallinity in the i-nc-Si absorber layer from its incubation stage during its sequential growth over the window layer and ensures low recombination losses for conduction of charge carriers along the vertical direction at the p/i-interface. Further improvement in cell efficiency sensitively depends on proper optimization and future ungradation of the i-nc-Si absorber layer, and the single junction nc-Si cell could play a significant role as an integral part of premium all-Si tandem structure solar cells.
Introduction
Solar cells as a major renewable energy component could provide cost effective solutions to the present day energy crisis, and they appear significantly useful in places far from the jurisdiction of conventional grid electricity. Further, they are environmentally benign, being totally silent and non-polluting. Silicon thin film is regarded as an important material in the renewable energy industry.1–3 It is found that the structural properties of the film can be altered by the inclusion of a dopant within the Si film.4,5 In the case of p–i–n Si solar cells in superstrate configuration with an nc-Si absorber layer, a p-nc-Si window layer is most favorable as it could facilitate the growth of crystallinity in i-nc-Si from its incubation stage, during its sequential growth over the window layer. Further, the lattice mismatch at the p/i-junction is also minimized. Boron doped p-type nanocrystalline silicon film emerges as an attractive window material for thin film silicon solar cells in view of its proportional crystallinity, conductivity and optical transmission.6–10 The high conductivity of the doped layer can enhance the built-in potential organizing a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC), while high optical transmission over the mid-visible region is a popular advantage of a p-layer in solar cells.11,12 However, it's a challenging task to optimize the doping level by adjusting the process parameters in order to simultaneously maintain the high conductivity, elevated crystallinity and wide optical band gap, particularly in thin layers usable in the fabrication of solar cells. The plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique has been recognized as an industrial technology because of its ability of large area deposition, and reproducibility in maintaining good optoelectronic properties and deposition rate.13–17
The present work deals with the optimization of p-type nc-Si films of elevated crystallinity and high electrical conductivity, together with a wide optical band gap at device compatible deposition parameters by RF PECVD, and the performance demonstration of p-nc-Si window layers in p–i–n nc-Si solar cells.
Experimental
p-Type nc-Si films have been prepared on Corning® Eagle2000™ glass substrates by 13.56 MHz RF PECVD, using a gas mixture of silane (SiH4 ∼ 1.4 sccm), hydrogen (H2 ∼ 190 sccm) and 1% diborane in helium (B2H6 in He) (∼0.7 sccm). Prior to deposition, the reactor chamber was evacuated at high vacuum of ∼10−7 Torr and the substrates were pre-heated at a temperature of 50 °C above the deposition temperature. A set of films are prepared at a substrate temperature of 180 °C, by varying the gas pressure in the reactor from 1 to 4 Torr while the RF power applied to the parallel plate electrodes is maintained at a low magnitude at 30 W. The Raman spectra of the samples have been measured using a Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope operating with an air-cooled ∼514 nm wavelength Ar+ laser source set at ∼2 mW cm−2 power density. A Cu-Kα X-ray radiation (λ ∼ 0.15418 nm) source and Bragg diffraction setup (Seifert 3000P) have been used for X-ray diffraction analysis. Elemental analysis of the films was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, using a focused monochromatized Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.8 eV) in an Omicron Nano Technology 0571 spectrometer. Single junction nanocrystalline silicon solar cells were fabricated on Ashai U-type SnO2 coated glass substrates, using the optimized p-nc-Si window layer. The I–V characteristics of the solar cells of 1 × 1 cm2 area are taken at room temperature under AM 1.5 illuminations from a solar simulator (Wakom). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the single junction solar cell has been measured with monochromatic probe light and appropriate DC bias light.
Results and discussions
X-ray diffraction

Fig. 1 represents the XRD spectra of boron doped nc-Si films, grown at different gas pressures that display three prevailing peaks corresponding to the 〈111〉, 〈220〉 and 〈311〉 orientation of c-Si, identified at 2θ = 28.3°, 47.2° and 56.2°, respectively. The 〈220〉 peak is thermodynamically favored which is formed at elevated temperature and pressure, while the 〈111〉 peak forms as a result of haphazard nucleation.18–20
 Fig. 1  X-Ray diffraction spectra of the p-type Si films grown at various pressures. Inset shows the variation of the 〈220〉 to 〈111〉 peak intensity ratio, I〈220〉/I〈111〉, and the grain size along the 〈220〉 direction. 
The intensity ratio I〈220〉/I〈111〉 is estimated for the p-type Si films and is presented in the inset of Fig. 1 which shows that I〈220〉/I〈111〉 gradually enhances with increasing gas pressure in the reactor and attains the highest magnitude of ∼1.68 at 2.5 Torr. On further increase in pressure, however, the ratio reduces attaining ∼0.50 at 4 Torr.14,18
The mean grain size (D) of the Si nanocrystals has been estimated from the FWHM (β) of the 〈220〉 peak in the XRD spectra by using Scherer's formula: D = 0.9λ/βcosθ. Interestingly, a close similarity in the nature of changes of I〈220〉/I〈111〉 and D with variations in the gas pressure in the plasma has been demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 1. The largest size (∼18.5 ± 2 nm) Si-ncs with 〈220〉 crystallographic orientation have been obtained at p = 2.5 Torr.14,18
Raman spectroscopy

Fig. 2 presents the Raman spectra of three typical B-doped nc-Si films prepared at low, intermediate and high pressure at 1, 2.5 and 4 Torr. Each spectrum identifies three prominent characteristic peaks of Si phonon modes, e.g., a transverse acoustic (TA) mode with a peak at 150 cm−1, a longitudinal acoustic (LA) mode with a peak at 300 cm−1 and a transverse optical (TO) mode near 500 cm−1. It has been demonstrated in inset (a) in Fig. 2 that the intensity ratios of both ITA/ITO and ILA/ITO attain minima at p = 2.5 Torr, the magnitude of both increasing at lower as well as higher gas pressures in the plasma. The TO mode peak reveals a gradual shift in the peak positions and that identifies the variations in the mean grain size of the silicon nano-crystallites within the network occurring due to changes in the gas pressure during individual deposition. Each TO mode peak has been deconvoluted into three components for amorphous (a-Si), nanocrystalline (nc-Si) and ultra-nanocrystalline silicon (unc-Si), as shown in inset (b) of Fig. 2. The total crystalline volume fraction (XC) has been calculated considering both nc-Si and unc-Si as part and portion of crystallinity.14 Inset (c) in Fig. 2 demonstrates that XC increases gradually from 78% at 1 Torr to 86% at 2.5 Torr and then slowly reduces on further increase in gas pressure, attaining a magnitude of 71% at 4 Torr.
 Fig. 2  Normalized Raman spectra of p-type silicon films grown at various pressures (p) viewing transverse acoustic, longitudinal acoustic and transverse optical modes. Inset shows: (a) ratio of the TA to TO mode and LA to TO mode, (b) the deconvoluted spectra of the film prepared at p = 2.5 Torr, (c) variations of crystalline volume fraction and the grain size, and (d) variation of Xunc/Xnc ratio. 
The mean grain size of the Si nanocrystallites has been measured from the TO mode Raman spectra by using the formula:21  where ωL is the frequency for a particle of size L, while Γ0 (3.5 cm−1) is the natural line width and ω0 is the natural frequency of c-Si (520 cm−1). The nc-Si grains attain the largest size of ∼20.7 nm at the most favorable pressure of 2.5 Torr, while the size of the grains is minimized on either side of the gas pressure variation, as shown in Fig. 2, Inset (c). From Raman analysis it is observed that the B-doped nc-Si films of highest crystalline volume fraction with the largest average crystallite size have been obtained at an optimum gas pressure p = 2.5 Torr in the plasma.
Deposition rate

Fig. 3 represents the change of the deposition rate (Rd) that increases linearly with increase in gas pressure, from 11 Å min−1 at p = 1 Torr to 26 Å min−1 at p = 4 Torr, as a result of effective dissociation of the process gas within the plasma. As such the overall deposition rate is rather low. This is the consequence of a low flow rate of the precursor gas (SiH4) at a high H2-dilution, in association with a low power (30 W) electrical excitation of the 13.56 MHz RF plasma.
 Fig. 3  Changes in growth rate of boron doped silicon thin films prepared on glass at various gas pressures (p). 
At elevated gas pressure, the number density of radicals and ions enhances within the plasma and due to their reduced mean free path multiple inter-collisions before arrival at the growth location leads to relatively lower hydride silicon precursors, which inherently increases the deposition rate. However, plenty of atomic hydrogen generated in the plasma through the simultaneous dissociation of SiH4 and B2H6 gas molecules can favorably diffuse onto the growing surface and form a grossly ordered network and larger p-Si nano-crystallites for increasing pressure up to p = 2.5 Torr.22 With further increase in pressure, the elevated dissociation of precursor molecules, although increases the growth rate, effectively degrades the film quality as the surface mobility of the lower hydride precursors reduces significantly.14
XPS study
The XPS study has been performed for the elemental analysis of Si and B in the deposited p-Si films. The spectra in Fig. 4(a) and (b) present the Si 2p component at ∼103.24 eV and the asymmetric peak around 191 eV corresponding to the B 1s component, for the silicon film prepared at p = 2.5 Torr. The B 1s spectrum with its two satellite components B–Si and B–O indicates successful boron doping within Si nanocrystals.23 In the Si film, the B–Si bond is shorter than Si–Si bonds and boron atoms are distributed on the surface of nc-Si grains to form ordered reconstruction along the 〈220〉 crystallographic orientation. In the XPS analysis O has been found to exist within the network as an impurity elemental component.
 Fig. 4  Typical X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for a p-nc-Si film prepared at p = 2.5 Torr showing peaks corresponding to Si 2p and B1s. 
The integrated peak area intensities under the Si 2p, B 1s and the O 1s peaks in conjunction with atom-specific relative sensitivity factors (RSFs) of 0.328, 0.159 and 0.780, for Si, B and O, respectively, were used to estimate the relative elemental compositions of the films, with the following expression:24  where I stands for the integrated peak area intensity. The B concentration of around 15.5 at% has been estimated for the samples prepared at p = 2.5 Torr.
Optical band gap
The optical data of the samples are obtained from the reflection and absorption spectra in the UV-visible region. The band gap (Eg) of the Si films has been estimated from the Tauc's equation:25,26  where K is a constant, E is the energy of a photon and α is the absorption coefficient. The optical band gap of the Si film grown at a pressure of 1 Torr is about 1.85 eV. The Eg has been estimated to decrease monotonically to 1.65 eV as the gas pressure is systematically elevated to 4 Torr, as shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Change of optical band gap and Urbach energy of p-nc-Si films grown on glass at various gas pressures. 
As per theoretical calculation, α(E) = α0exp(E/E0), where α0 is a constant and E0, the Urbach energy, is an empirical parameter representative of the width of band tail states. The E0 has been measured as the inverse of the slope of the considerable linear section of the ln(α) vs. E plot, for energies below the band edge (E < Eg). At p = 1 Torr, the corresponding E0 is low, ∼300 meV and increases to 450 meV with increase in p to 4 Torr as shown in Fig. 5. At increased gas pressure in the plasma during deposition, increased boron incorporation into the Si network may introduce enhanced defect states and subsequently lead to a lower optical band gap.
DC conductivity
The electrical conductivity of the films has been measured with co-planar Al electrodes. As shown in Fig. 6, the dark conductivity increases at elevated gas pressure in the plasma and a high σD = 1.04 × 102 S cm−1 is obtained for the highly nanocrystalline film prepared at an optimum pressure of 2.5 Torr. On further increase in p the dark conductivity decreases and attains a magnitude as low as 2.3 × 10−1 S cm−1 at p = 4 Torr.
 Fig. 6  The variation of dark conductivity (σD) of the p-nc-Si films with gas pressure. 
The increase in σD at the initial increase of p from 1.0 to 2.5 Torr could be correlated to the enhanced crystalline volume fraction from 78 to 86% as well as the enlarged size of the Si nanocrystals from 8.4 to ∼18.5 nm. Enhancement of short range interaction and the percolation of charge carriers through the closely spaced nanocrystals increases the electrical conductivity. Further, effective B doping within the nc-Si network by its 15.5 at% elemental composition, as estimated from the XPS study, enhances the electrical conductivity significantly. However, at higher pressure beyond 2.5 Torr, in addition to reduced crystallinity and diminished grain size, the grain boundary portion increases enormously, as evident from the sharp rise in the unc/nc component ratio from 0.15 to 0.65, shown in inset (d) in Fig. 2. Segregation of B-atoms at the grain boundaries reduces the overall doping efficiency of the nanocrystalline network which results in a sharp reduction in the electrical conductivity by about three orders of magnitude.27 The grain boundary is a complex segment in consequence of the misfit of crystalline orientations and is relaxed by initiating a high amount of defects. These extremely defective grain boundary regions act as the trapping centers for the electrons, thereby reducing the number of electrons freely available for electrical conduction. Furthermore, gradually elevated grain boundary related disorder causes an enhanced band bending effect that finally results in narrowing the band gap, as presently evident at elevated gas pressures.
Increasing the conductivity of the p-type silicon films at elevated pressure to 2.5 Torr may arise primarily by the enhanced compensation of defects and impurities by the dopant atoms.28 Furthermore at enhanced pressure He (present as a diluent of dopants) induced enhanced dissociation of SiH4 produces increased atomic H density in the plasma, which in turn compensates the unsaturated Si and B atoms forming Si–H and B–H bonds;6 H-atoms thereby, play a significant role in the execution and passivation of Si dangling bonds in the p-type Si films.29 At further increased pressure beyond 2.5 Torr, increased H-atoms, moving to the substitutional B–Si bonds, may create the neutral B–H–Si complex that is electrically inactive and thereby drastically reduce the electrical conductivity.30–32 By virtue of increased growth rate at higher pressure, B-atoms are spread on the upper surface of Si grains creating defects in the grain boundaries which enhance at higher pressure, as evident from the increased Xunc/Xnc ratio estimated in Raman analysis. These B-atoms create self-agglomerates of a small potential barrier and Si populates randomly around these B-atom agglomerates and induces enhancing amorphous component in the film. As a result, the carrier transport happens to be restricted by the grain boundaries, which produces drastic deterioration in σD of the p-Si films.33

Table 1 presents a comparative study relating electrical conductivity and optical band gap with crystallinity and grain size among a variety of p-type Si films prepared by different deposition techniques, reported in the recent literature.28,34–38 The high magnitude of the dark electrical conductivity, σD ∼ 104 S cm−1, of the presently reported p-nc-Si film grown at p = 2.5 Torr, may arise because of its highest volume percentage of crystallinity (86%) along with large crystallite size (18.5 nm). The material possessing a simultaneous wide optical band gap, Eg ∼ 1.77 eV, appears significantly useful for device fabrication, particularly considering an associated device friendly deposition temperature (180 °C) and the most popular growth technology (13.56 MHz RF PECVD). However, it needs to be noted that all the properties typically degrade at reduced thickness of the material at which it is used as a practical component in solar cells.39

Silicon solar cell
The single junction p–i–n silicon solar cells have been fabricated by using 2500 nm thick i-layers as the active material grown at 97% H2 dilution to the SiH4 plasma operated at 27.12 MHz frequency.40 In the sequence of steps of fabrication, a 20 nm thick p-nc-Si layer was deposited onto the top of an Ashai U-type SnO2 coated glass substrate at 180 °C by adding 1% B2H6 in He to the (SiH4 + H2) plasma in 13.56 MHz PECVD at a gas pressure, p = 2.5 Torr. The a-Si n-layer of thickness ∼30 nm was coated onto the i-layer at 170 °C from 1% PH3 in H2 added to the 13.56 MHz (SiH4 + H2) plasma in PECVD.41 The general characteristics of each individual layer are presented in Table 2.

High crystallinity (∼86%) along with a large grain size (18.5 nm) and low fraction of ultra-nanocrystalline component (Xunc/Xnc ∼ 0.14) of the optimum p-nc-Si window-layer obtained at p = 2.5 Torr, may help to maintain the high JSC = 23.85 mA cm−2 of the nc-Si solar cell. Further, the 〈220〉 preferred crystallographic orientation of the nanocrystallites (I〈220〉/I〈111〉 ∼ 1.68) ensures low recombination losses for conduction of charge carriers along the vertical direction at the p/i-interface and facilitates increasing the ISC.42 The external quantum efficiency data demonstrate the moderately longer wavelength response of the nc-Si solar cell. The optical band gap matching between the p-nc-Si window layer and i-nc-Si absorber layer holds a reasonably good fill factor of the cell, maintaining a defect equilibrium at the p/i-interface. Using this optimum window layer, a reasonably acceptable conversion efficiency, η ∼ 7.05%, of the single junction nc-Si solar cell has been attained; its further escalation depends sensitively on the improvement of the absorber layer which will be considered in a different program. The single junction nc-Si solar cell could be an integral part of the all-Si tandem structure solar cells.

Table 4 presents a comparative study relating solar cell parameters among a variety of Si films prepared by different deposition techniques, reported in the recent literature.43–46 It has been found that the silicon solar cell developed by a solution based process43 shows lower current density and fill factor as in this process the device has only a small shunt resistance, which would imply electron–hole recombination causing a significant loss channel in the device. In another study by the same solution process, although the VOC and FF have been found to be high, the current density happens to be very low because of inefficient transport of the charge carriers through the active layer to the electrodes, before recombination occurs due to the low mobility of charge carriers in the organic material.44 The a-Si solar cell developed in a radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF PECVD) system at 280 °C demonstrated very lower efficiency mainly because of the use of smooth AZO films as electrodes in the p–i–n diodes.45 Generally a TCO layer with a suitable surface texture is used at the front contact of thin-film silicon solar cells to increase light scattering and subsequent light trapping in the absorber layer, and a reflective back contact material is needed. In another study the silicon solar cell prepared by very-high frequency (110 MHz) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition at 200 °C, shows reasonably good VOC, JSC and high FF in the p–i–n configuration, and the presence of Si nanocrystals in the p-nc-SiOx allows for improved nucleation of the nanocrystalline i-layer that provides a good p/i-interface.40,46 Thus, a PECVD based process in combination with a proper TCO component and, more importantly, a suitable B-doped nanocrystalline window layer has been found to be appropriate for the fabrication of reasonably good quality solar cells, in the present report.

Conclusion
In order to simultaneously maintain an elevated crystallinity, high electrical conductivity and wide optical band gap, particularly usable in the fabrication of nc-Si solar cells, a set of p-type nc-Si films have been prepared at ∼180 °C and a low 13.56 MHz RF power of 30 W in PECVD. Films produced at elevated pressure are of, in general, enhanced growth rate and reduced optical band gap. However, structural and electrical properties mostly demonstrate optimum specifications, suitable for applications in solar cells, at an intermediate pressure of the reacting gases in the plasma at 2.5 Torr. The optimum p-nc-Si window-layer obtained at p = 2.5 Torr exhibited a high crystallinity of ∼86% along with a large grain size of ∼18.5 nm, a low fraction of ultra-nanocrystalline component, Xunc/Xnc ∼ 0.14 and a preferred 〈220〉 crystallographic orientation of the nanocrystallites, I〈220〉/I〈111〉 ∼ 1.68. The p-nc-Si film possessing dark electrical conductivity as high as σD ∼ 104 S cm−1 along with a wide optical band gap of ∼1.77 eV appears amply suitable for nc-Si p–i–n junction solar cells.
A significantly high crystalline volume fraction with large size nanocrystallites of the p-nc-Si window layer minimizes the lattice mismatch at the p/i-junction and further facilitates the growth of proper crystallinity in the i-nc-Si absorber layer from its incubation stage, during its sequential growth over the window layer. Promoted crystallinity in i-nc-Si induces a moderate longer wavelength response of the nc-Si solar cell. Preferred 〈220〉 oriented growth of the p-layer nanocrystallites ensures low recombination losses for conduction of charge carriers along the vertical direction at the p/i-interface and contributes to enhancing the ISC. Proper matching of the optical band gaps between the p-nc-Si window layer and i-nc-Si absorber layer provides a sensibly good fill factor of the cell, maintaining a defect equilibrium at the p/i-interface. Single junction nc-Si solar cells have been realized with reasonably acceptable conversion efficiency, η ∼ 7.05%, as demonstrated in Table 3; further improvement sensitively depends on proper optimization and future ungradation of the i-nc-Si absorber layer. This single junction nc-Si cell could play a significant role in the fabrication of all-Si tandem structure solar cells, being an integral part of it.
