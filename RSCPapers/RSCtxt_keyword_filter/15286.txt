    , Accepted 1st September 2017First published on 1st September 2017AbstractThe field of solution-processable oligomer-based organic solar cells is progressing rapidly. However, common halogenated solvents used in the fabrication of solar cell devices stand out as a growing problem concerning industrial applications. Here, we report on the fabrication and post-treatment of solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells exclusively from non-halogenated solvents o-xylene for processing and tetrahydrofuran for solvent vapor annealing (SVA). As donors, we incorporated a series of three different dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) containing A–D–A co-oligomers and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as acceptor. The resulting devices exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 7.04%. The photoactive layers were probed using absorption spectroscopy, grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to clarify the effect of the solvent vapor treatment.
Introduction
In the last few years, tremendous progress concerning organic photovoltaics (OPVs) especially in the field of solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) has been demonstrated. As a result of the extensive development of novel materials and improved device architectures,1–4 power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer- and oligomer-based organic solar cells (OSCs) have reached close to 12% in single-junction devices.5–7 In addition to high-performance solar cell devices, BHJSCs fabricated from solution offer the opportunity of being coated or printed on a large scale, which is an attractive feature for production and commercialization,8 and become reasonably viable with regard to PCEs achieved so far.9 However, solvents for the deposition of the photoactive layer from solution are so far predominantly chlorinated, such as chloroform or chlorobenzene, etc. Although these solvents exhibit excellent dissolution properties for common polymer- and oligomer-based donors and acceptors,10–12 chlorinated solvents are highly undesired for industrial applications due to negative impacts on the environment and living beings.13 Because decent miscibility is mandatory with respect to solution-processing and good film formation, the use of alternative, non-chlorinated solvents might lead to drawbacks in film morphology and consequently in the efficiency of the resulting device.
Post-treatment of the photoactive layer by means of thermal annealing,14 solvent additives,15,16 or solvent vapor annealing (SVA)17–23 is a common method to improve the performance of organic solar cells. However, in this process halogenated solvents or additives such as diiodooctane, chloronaphthalene, etc. are frequently used. Thus, in the ideal case, alternative, sustainable solvents should provide decent solubility for both, donor and acceptor components, while the morphology and the efficiency of the resulting device should not suffer from this alteration.
The field of sustainable solution-processed BHJSCs has started to grow and major contributions have been demonstrated based on polymer solar cells, which were recently reviewed by Hou et al.24 Accordingly, a variety of non-halogenated solvent alternatives have been utilized including xylenes, anisole, toluene, trimethylbenzene, acetone, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), etc. So far, the highest efficiency of 11.7% achieved for polymer-based solar cells using non-halogenated solvents was reported by Han et al.25 In contrast, only very few examples have been reported for oligomer-based solar cells processed from non-halogenated solvents (see Table S1, ESI†). Besides the common benefits including low batch-to-batch variation and high purity,2,17,26 oligomer-based materials offer, due to their lower molecular weight and defined structure, solubility in a greater variety of solvents, including non-halogenated alternatives.9,27–29
The very first example of a sustainably prepared oligomer-based BHJSC was reported by Singh and co-workers.30 Although PCEs of up to 2.7% could be achieved by using tetrahydrofuran as solvent, PCEs close to 5% were only achieved using chlorinated solvent additives (chloronaphthalene). Shortly thereafter, Brabec et al. used a solvent mixture of benzaldehyde and mesitylene and efficiencies of up to 3.7% were realized.9 Interestingly, this rather exotic solvent mixture was predicted with the help of Hansen solubility parameters (HSP),31 which can be envisioned as a powerful tool to avoid empirical trial-and-error methodologies finding alternative solvents. Further contributions to this field were made by Bazan et al., who prepared oligomer-based devices from 2-methyltetrahydrofuran as processing solvent exhibiting PCEs of up to 5%.32 Solvent alternatives such as toluene and o-xylene came into play and have been employed by Peng et al. and Chu et al. to prepare efficient devices with PCEs in the range of 5–7%.33,34 With respect to oligomer-based BHJSCs, Chu and co-workers have recently obtained PCEs of up to 8.1% using a solvent mixture of toluene and cyclopentyl methyl ether for processing.35 Very recently, Peng et al. achieved so far the highest PCE of up to 11.5% using carbon disulfide as solvent.36
In this report, we present the fabrication of efficient oligomer-based BHJSCs processed and post-treated with eco-friendly solvents. ADA-type co-oligomers 1–3 comprising dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as central donor (D) and dicyanovinyl (DCV) as terminal acceptor (A) moieties were used as p-type and PC71BM as n-type organic semiconductors giving devices with decent PCEs of 6–7% (Fig. 1). These values are close to those reported in our previously published studies, in which co-oligomers 2 and 3 and PC71BM were processed from and post-treated with chloroform resulting in efficient devices with PCEs of up to 7.74% and 8.16%, respectively.18,37 It seemed reasonable to involve these co-oligomers in this study as a reference. Novel co-oligomer 1 bearing a triethylene oxide side chain at the central DTP unit was added to the series and designed to force enhanced solubility in polar, non-halogenated solvents. Surprisingly, solubility experiments showed that all three donor materials are well soluble in o-xylene, which therefore emerged as a promising solvent for processing. Xylenes in general have reasonably established their role as alternative solvents in the field of eco-friendly processed organic solar cells.12 As the deposition technique, we focused on doctor-blading instead on the mostly used spin-coating, because this deposition technique comes much closer to technical printing techniques than the latter one. Furthermore, doctor-blading allows for controlled device fabrication at elevated temperatures to ensure uniformity of the resulting films leading to the possibility to use solvents with high boiling points. Further post-treatment of the photoactive layer of our BHJSCs was conducted by solvent vapor annealing (SVA) with tetrahydrofuran (THF). In order to clarify the impact of the solvent vapor treatment on the photoactive layer investigations, thin film absorption spectroscopy, grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed.

Results and discussion
The synthesis of co-oligomer 1 is depicted in Scheme 1, while the synthesis of co-oligomers 217 and 337 is reported elsewhere. Because the recently reported synthesis of triethylene oxide-functionalized DTP 6 by tandem Buchwald–Hartwig amination gave only moderate yields,38 we started from non-substituted DTP 4,39,40 for which we recently improved the synthesis.41 In this respect, DTP 4 was reacted with tosylate 542 under phase-transfer catalysis conditions in a mixture of toluene and 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide with tetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate as a catalyst giving heteroacene 6 in 71% yield. Lithiation of DTP 6 and quenching with trimethyltin chloride gave the corresponding stannane 7, which was cross-coupled under Pd-catalysis with DCV-substituted bromobithiophene 843 to yield co-oligomer 1 in 53% yield after purification by flash column chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. NMR and mass spectroscopic measurements confirmed the structure and purity of co-oligomer 1.

After initial experiments for finding suitable non-halogenated solvents for solution-processing (see Table S2, ESI†), o-xylene emerged as a promising candidate providing decent solubility (>16 mg mL−1) for all three oligomers and the acceptor PC71BM (66.2 mg mL−1).44 In addition, the thermal stability of co-oligomers 1–3 was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as a directive for the maximum processing temperature during doctor-blading (see Table S2 and Fig. S1, ESI†). All three oligomers exhibited melting points above 150 °C without decomposition restricting the processing temperature during doctor-blading to the boiling point of o-xylene.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was performed in dilute o-xylene solutions and thin films were cast from o-xylene (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Absorption bands with maxima at ∼550 nm and extinction coefficients from 53000 to 61000 M−1 cm−1 were observed for all three co-oligomers 1–3 which can be attributed to the charge transfer character of the central donor moiety and the flanking DCV-acceptors. In addition, the weaker absorption band at around 400 nm can be correlated to the π–π* transition of the conjugated oligomeric backbone. The absorption spectra of the corresponding thin films exhibited pronounced red-shifted absorption bands with maxima at ∼710 nm including vibronic progression. This finding is indicative of an enhanced planarization and aggregation of the molecules in the bulk. In the case of co-oligomer 1, the absorption onset is more red-shifted (∼50 nm) compared to 2 and 3 which leads to a better aggregation behavior in the film due to the linear side chain.

Electrochemical measurements by means of cyclic voltammetry of novel co-oligomer 1 in solution were performed to determine redox potentials and the energy levels of the frontier orbitals thereof. The data are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 1. Two reversible one-electron oxidation waves at 0.27 V and 0.64 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) were observed which can be assigned to the stepwise oxidation of the conjugated backbone and the formation of stable radical cations and dications, respectively. One irreversible two-electron reduction wave is observed at −1.56 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) corresponding to a simultaneous reduction of the terminal DCV-acceptor groups. The HOMO (−5.28 eV) and LUMO (−3.74 eV) energy levels were calculated from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction potential, respectively. The data for the novel co-oligomer 1 are very similar to those for the other co-oligomers 217 and 337 indicating negligible effects of the pendant side chain at the central DTP moiety on the electronic properties.

Solution-processed BHJSCs with the standard device architecture glass|ITO|PEDOT:PSS|D:A blend (1:2)|LiF|Al were fabricated. The measured photovoltaic parameters of the optimized co-oligomer:PC71BM devices processed from o-xylene and post-treated with THF solvent vapor are presented in Table 2 and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are illustrated in Fig. 4. All three oligomers 1–3 displayed short-circuit current densities (JSC) above 12 mA cm−2 and fill factors (FF) of around 68%, and slight deviations in the open-circuit voltage (VOC), which ranged from 0.735 V to 0.804 V, were noted. In total, decent PCEs of 6.57% for 1, 7.04% for 2, and 6.82% for 3-based devices were obtained. In this respect, ADA-oligothiophene 2 bearing a 2-hexyldecyl side chain gave the best result (7.04%), which comes close (and corresponds to approximately 90%) to that of the devices prepared from chloroform (7.74%18) as solvent and to that of the record devices published by Chu et al. (8.1%).35 Also, BHJSCs containing co-oligomer 3 do not lose too much performance when the processing conditions are changed from chloroform (8.16%37) to o-xylene/THF (6.82%).

J–V curves of the solar cell devices based on oligomers 1 (green curve), 2 (blue curve), and 3 (red curve) before (dashed line) and after (full line) SVA with the device architecture glass|ITO|PEDOT:PSS|oligomer:PC71BM (1:2)|LiF|Al (left) and the EQE spectra of the best performing solar cell devices, using the same cell architecture (right). 
In order to confirm the high potential of charge carrier extraction and to gain insights into the internal working mechanisms, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of various co-oligomer:PC71BM photovoltaic devices has been measured. Fig. 4 presents the EQE spectra for blends containing co-oligomers 1–3. Over a broad range of the visible spectrum (400–750 nm), efficient photon-to-charge conversion is observed and in particular co-oligomers 1 and 3 show EQE maxima of around 63% at 520 nm. Photocurrent densities independently determined from the EQE data show rather small deviations for all three co-oligomer:PC71BM blends compared to the values under the AM 1.5G solar spectrum (Table 2).
In order to further clarify the origin of the different photovoltaic properties before and after treatment with THF solvent vapor, UV-vis spectroscopy and grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements of the active layers deposited on PEDOT:PSS coated glass substrates were performed. The deposition of the active layers for the following studies was conducted comparable to that for the BHJSC device fabrication. In Fig. 5, the normalized absorption spectra and diffraction patterns of blends featuring co-oligomer 1:PC71BM before and after solvent vapor treatment are displayed. For the untreated films, an absorption maximum at 380 nm and shoulders at approximately 405 and 470 nm are observed which is indicative of a main contribution of PC71BM to the absorption,18 whereas only marginal contributions to the absorption from the donor are seen at higher wavelengths. Upon exposure of the photoactive layer to THF solvent vapor, the absorption spectrum exhibits more pronounced spectral features at higher wavelengths, along with a remarkably enhanced absorptivity and a sharper, red-shifted absorption onset. These results suggest molecular rearrangements upon exposure to solvent vapor leading to an improved packing motif of the oligomers in the active layer. Similar observations were made for blends containing donors 2 and 3 (see Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra (left) and GIXRD diffraction patterns (right) of blends containing co-oligomer 1:PC71BM (1:2) before (black line) and after SVA (red line). The film was deposited by doctor-blading on a PEDOT:PSS-coated glass substrate. 
GIXRD measurements were performed at an incidence angle of 0.2° for films of 1:PC71BM (Fig. 5, right), 2:PC71BM (see Fig. S2, ESI†), and 3:PC71BM (see Fig. S3, ESI†) on PEDOT:PSS-coated glass substrates before and after SVA (THF). The D:A blend of the untreated films revealed a low-angle reflex, which can be ascribed to the presence of oligomer crystallites. The d100-spacing was determined to be 16.0 Å for 1, 18.0 Å for 2, and 19.1 Å for 3 correlating to the lamellar separation between the corresponding donor backbones. In comparison to 2 and 3, this low-angle reflex is less distinct in the blend containing co-oligomer 1 which is indicative of an amorphous morphological composition that might originate from an enhanced perturbation by the acceptor with respect to the crystallization of 1 in the bulk. In addition, the blends containing 2 and 3 exhibited a broad reflex between 7–15° derived from a combination of the donor, acceptor, and substrate. The reflection intensity at low angles increases upon SVA which is more pronounced for the 1:PC71BM blend indicating an increased order and crystallinity of the oligomers in the blend.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in the intermittent tapping mode were conducted in order to gain insight into the surface morphology of the photoactive layers. The topography images of the surface of photoactive layers before and after solvent vapor annealing are displayed in Fig. 6. In general, the pristine films exhibited a rather smooth surface, which is reflected by a low average height (1.7 nm for 1, 1.5 nm for 2, and 1.8 nm for 3). In all three cases, some crystallites adsorbed onto the surface are visualized as brighter spots (heights of up to 12 nm) being less common for the blend 2:PC71BM (Fig. 6 and Fig. S4–S6, ESI†). The average roughness of the untreated films is below 1 nm in all cases and increases only slightly after SVA. The analysis of the phase images (see Fig. S4–S6, ESI†) did not give evidence of any significant contrast indicating the homogeneity distribution of the materials at the surface. Upon exposure to THF vapor, drastic changes occur concerning the height profile and surface's structure (Fig. 6d–f). The blend films evidenced fibril-like structures with increasing fiber thickness from 2 (0.06 ± 0.02 μm) through 1 (0.15 ± 0.04 μm) to 3 (0.25 ± 0.05 μm). The average height increases to 7.9 nm for 1, 5.4 nm for 2, and 9.7 nm for 3. The phase images after SVA (see Fig. S4–S6, ESI†) showed negligible phase differences indicating homogeneity in the material composition on the surface.

To sum up the section concerning device characterization, absorption spectroscopy, and GIXRD measurements, an indication of a higher degree of order in the donor phase in the active blend upon exposure to solvent vapor was found. In the case of blends containing co-oligomer 1, the increase of the GIXRD reflection is remarkably pronounced. These observations are also supported by the finding during solid-state absorption spectroscopy, in which an increased absorptivity as well as a red-shift upon exposure to solvent vapor occurs. AFM measurements revealed an increased structuration of the active layer surface by SVA. Because no evidence of phase separation on the surface of the blend could be provided by AFM, we suggest that SVA enhances phase separation and the order of molecules in the bulk.
Conclusion
In summary, we have extended the series of A–D–A type co-oligomers comprising dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as central donor (D) and dicyanovinyl (DCV) as terminal acceptor (A) moieties (2 and 3) and synthesized a novel derivative 1 bearing an amphiphilic triethylene glycol side chain at the central DTP-nitrogen instead of branched hydrocarbon side chains in 2 and 3. The characterization of the optoelectronic properties by means of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry revealed a negligible influence of the pendant side chains exhibiting good promise of all three derivatives for application as donors in organic photovoltaics. All three co-oligomers 1–3 in this study were tested in bulk-heterojunction solar cells with the aim to use exclusively non-halogenated solvents and doctor-blading for processing steps. The structural design of the co-oligomers led to high solubilities in various non-halogenated solvents and we finally used o-xylene for the fabrication of the photoactive layer and tetrahydrofuran for solvent vapor annealing as the post-treatment method. Highly efficient devices were obtained for all three derivatives 1–3 with power conversion efficiencies between 6.5% and 7%, which were only slightly smaller than those obtained using chloroform and spin-coating. Absorption spectroscopy, GIXRD, and AFM measurements of the photoactive layer were conducted to visualize the consequences of the solvent vapor annealing on the morphology. These experiments indicated that the exposure of the active blend to THF solvent vapor induces restructuring of the donor in the bulk leading to an enhanced absorptivity and crystallinity. Ultimately, this rearrangement led to a higher order in the bulk heterojunction resulting in an increased efficiency due to increased current density and high fill factors around 70%.

Materials and methods
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz) or a Bruker AMX 500 (1H NMR: 500 MHz, 13C NMR: 125 MHz). Chemical shift values (δ) are expressed in parts per million using residual solvent protons (1H NMR: δH = 5.32 for CD2Cl2, δH = 5.93 for C2D2Cl4; 13C NMR: δC = 54.00 for CD2Cl2, δC = 74.20 for C2D2Cl4) as an internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), and m (multiplet). Melting points were determined using a Mettler Toledo DSC 823 under argon (50 mL min−1) at an heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out on a Mettler Toledo Typus TGA/SDTA 851e in a nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Preparative column chromatography was performed on glass columns packed with silica gel, Merck silica 60, particle size 40–63 μm. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed an a 1.5 m long glass column packed with Bio-Beads S-X1 (BIO-RAD) using dichloromethane (VWR) as eluent. High resolution MALDI mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a MS Bruker Reflex 2 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as a matrix. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded in 1 cm cuvettes with Merck Uvasol grade solvents on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferricenium (Fc/Fc+) couple. Toluene (VWR), tetrahydrofuran (VWR), diethyl ether (VWR), and N,N′-dimethylformamide (Merck) were dried and purified using a MB SPS-800 (MBraun). All synthetic steps were carried out under argon atmosphere. XRD measurements were carried out using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with a fixed incoming angle of 0.2°. Surface images of photoactive layers were recorded with the help of an atomic force microscope (MultiMode V AFM, Bruker). The microscope was operated in air at room temperature in the tapping mode using commercial silicon tips at a resonance frequency of 200–400 kHz and spring constants of ≈50 N m−1.

Device fabrication
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P, VP.AI 4083 solution from Heraeus) was bladed onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates from Naranjo Substrates (15 Ω cm−2) at 50 °C upon 30–40 nm thick layers were obtained. The active layer solution (total concentration of 60 mg mL−1; stirred at 80 °C for >1 h), comprised of the donor and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, 99% purity purchased from Nano-C) was deposited by doctor-blading from o-xylene at 80 °C leading to film thicknesses of ∼90–110 nm. Solvent vapor annealing was carried out according to the literature procedure.4 Thin layers of LiF (∼0.7 nm) and Al (∼100 nm) were then deposited by high-vacuum evaporation at pressures <5 × 10−6 mbar (Nano 36, Kurt J. Lesker Co.). The photoactive areas of the cells were 0.09 and 0.16 cm2. Finalized devices were evaluated using a Oriel Instruments solar simulator (class AAA, AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The EQE was measured under monochromatic light from a 300 W Xenon lamp in combination with a monochromator (Oriel, Cornerstone 260), modulated with a mechanical chopper. The response was recorded as the voltage over 220 Ω resistance, using a lock-in amplifier (Merlin 70104). A calibrated Si cell was used as a reference (Newport 70356_70316NS).
Synthesis

4-{2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethyl}-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (6)38. 
A Schlenk tube was charged with dithienopyrrole 4 (343 mg, 1.91 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (167 mg, 0.48 mmol) in 15 mL toluene and a sodium hydroxide solution (50%, 7 mL, 87.5 mmol) and the mixture was stirred 15 min under argon atmosphere. After addition of tosylate 5 (853 mg, 2.68 mmol), the reaction was stirred at 80 °C for 18 h. After cooling to room temperature, water was added and the product was extracted using dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (SiO2, dichloromethane/ethyl acetate = 97:3) gave DTP 6 as a brown oil (441 mg, 1.37 mmol, 71%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD2Cl2, 20 °C, δ): 7.14 (d, J = 5.3 Hz, 2H, H-3,5), 7.09 (d, J = 5.3 Hz, 2H, H-2,6), 4.39 (t, J = 5.5 Hz, 2H, N–CH2–), 3.83 (t, J = 5.5 Hz, 2H, N–CH2–CH2), 3.54–3.44 (m, 6H, –CH2–), 3.44–3.40 (m, 2H, CH2–O–CH3), 3.30 (s, 3H, O–CH3). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD2Cl2, 20 °C, δ): 145.81, 123.18, 115.18, 112.11, 72.41, 71.36, 70.99, 70.93, 70.85, 59.11, 48.05.


4-{2-[2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethyl}-2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (7). 
A solution of dithienopyrrole 6 (128 mg, 0.39 mmol) in 0.4 mL dry THF was cooled to −78 °C and n-butyl lithium (0.74 mL, 1.18 mmol, 1.6 M) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 1 h and allowed to warm to 5 °C, while stirring was continued for 2 h additionally. After re-cooling to −78 °C, a solution of trimethyltin chloride (172 mg, 0.87 mmol) in dry THF (0.3 mL) was added in one portion and the mixture was stirred for 5 h at that temperature. The cold reaction mixture was poured into a cold, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and the product was extracted using diethyl ether. The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. Stannane 7 was obtained as a dark brown oil in quantitative yield (256 mg, 0.39 mmol) with a purity of >95% and was used without further purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD2Cl2, 20 °C, δ): 7.10 (s, 2H, H-3,5), 4.39 (t, J = 5.8 Hz, 2H, N–CH2), 3.83 (t, J = 5.8 Hz, 2H, N–CH2–CH2), 3.55–3.44 (m, 6H, –CH2–), 3.43–3.39 (m, 2H, CH2–O–CH3), 3.30 (s, 3H, O–CH3), 0.40 (s, 18H, –SnCH3). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CD2Cl2, 20 °C, δ): 148.65, 136.32, 120.72, 119.02, 72.42, 71.44, 71.00, 70.80, 66.22, 59.12, 47.97, −7.95.


2,2′-{[4-(2-{2-[2-Methoxyethoxy]ethoxy}ethyl)-4H-bisthieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-2,6-diyl}bis[(3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithien-5′,5-diyl)methylylidene]]dipropanedinitrile (1). 
Bithiophene 8 (28 mg, 57.6 μmol) and stannane 7 (15 mg, 23.0 μmol) were dissolved in 3 mL anhydrous DMF and stirred under argon atmosphere at room temperature for 15 minutes. After addition of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (1.60 mg, 2.30 μmol), the mixture was stirred at 160 °C for 3 h under microwave irradiation (300 W). After cooling to room temperature, water was added and the product was extracted using dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were washed with water and brine. After drying over magnesium sulfate, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by chromatography (SiO2) using dichloromethane as eluent to remove major impurities. Ethyl acetate was added to the eluent mixture (3%) to obtain the product. Further purification via size-exclusion chromatography (dichloromethane) gave oligomer 1 (14 mg, 12.25 μmol, 53%) as a black solid. M.p.: 181–185 °C. 1H NMR (500 MHz, C2D2Cl4, 90 °C, δ): 7.64 (s, 2H, DCV-H), 7.54 (s, 2H, H-4,4), 7.21 (s, 2H, H-3′), 7.16 (s, 2H, H-3), 4.38 (t, J = 5.4 Hz, 2H, N–CH2–), 3.90 (t, J = 5.4 Hz, 2H, –CH2–O–), 3.61–3.57 (m, 2H, O–CH2–), 3.57–3.53 (m, 2H –CH2–O), 3.51–3.47 (m, 2H, O–CH2–), 3.43–3.38 (m, 2H, –CH2–OCH3), 3.26 (s, 3H, –OCH3), 2.90–2.79 (m, 8H –CH2–), 1.77–1.65 (m, 8H, –CH2–), 1.48–1.38 (m, 8H, –CH2–), 1.39–1.30 (m, 16H, –CH2–CH2–CH3), 0.93–0.86 (m, 12H, –CH3). 13C NMR (125 MHz, C2D2Cl4, 90 °C, δ): 149.78, 145.53, 144.17, 141.55, 141.31, 140.92, 136.12, 133.42, 132.42, 132.04, 131.71, 120.63, 116.55, 114.64, 113.72, 110.99, 76.34, 72.20, 71.26, 70.86, 70.71, 70.53, 58.88, 48.09, 31.82, 31.72, 30.63, 30.15, 29.72, 29.53, 29.23, 22.74, 22.68, 14.12.
