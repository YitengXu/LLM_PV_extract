Microwave energy is absorbed strongly by conductive films, which enables preferential heating to a sufficiently high temperature for the deposition of CZTS exclusively on the conductive layer without homogeneous nucleation of CZTS in the liquid phase or heterogeneous nucleation of CZTS on uncoated portions of substrates.
Current thin film solar cells based on copper indium gallium selenide and cadmium telluride absorbers employ scarce and expensive elements including indium and tellurium. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in finding alternative solar absorbers composed of abundant, inexpensive, and nontoxic elements. Such materials could prove suitable for the sustainable, widespread, and terawatt-scale implementation of photovoltaic electricity generation.1 One of these materials is copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS, Cu2ZnSnS4).2–5 CZTS has a high absorption coefficient (∼104 cm−1) and a direct band gap of 1.45 eV,6 which places its theoretical solar energy conversion efficiency at approximately 32%. Its band gap can be decreased to 1 eV by alloying it with Se, forming Cu2ZnSn(SexS1−x)4 (CZTSSe), and device efficiency increases when some of the sulfur is replaced with selenium (x = 0.6 to 0.92).4 CZTSSe solar cells have already reached 11.1% power conversion efficiency.7 Thin films of CZTS and CZTSSe have been synthesized using various vacuum deposition methods such as sputtering,6,8,9 pulsed laser deposition,10 and chemical vapor deposition.11,12
Liquid-phase synthesis of CZTS films is a low-cost alternative to vacuum deposition techniques. One approach uses a hydrazine-based precursor slurry4 while others rely on colloidal dispersions of CZTS nanocrystals to cast precursor films, which are then annealed in a S- or Se-containing atmosphere to form polycrystalline films with micrometer-sized grains.13–15 The colloidal CZTS nanocrystal dispersions are typically synthesized using hot-injection methods and surfactants,13,16,17 which are used as labile ligands on the nanocrystals to control particle size, shape, and aggregation state. These ligands must be removed, typically through annealing; otherwise, they limit particle–particle contact and may become incorporated into the absorber layer and thus compromise device performance.18 This high-temperature annealing step substantially increases the energy required for fabricating solar cells and prevents the use of flexible substrates.
Rapid microwave synthesis of thin CZTS films reduces both time and energy required to prepare crystalline CZTS. CZTS nanocrystals have been synthesized in as little as 20 min using the rapid microwave-heating of precursor solutions.19,20 Microwaves have also been used for the selective heating of conductive substrates allowing for the formation of thin films of anatase (TiO2) directly onto conductive substrates.21
The successful and rapid synthesis of CZTS thin films onto conductive substrates by microwave irradiation is herein reported. When substrates coated with a conductive film are submerged into homogeneous solutions of precursors and exposed to microwave energy, the conductive films are selectively heated, resulting in fast and selective deposition of CZTS by thermolysis. Conductive films were either tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) on glass or molybdenum on glass or Kapton. The comparatively low solution temperature prevents heterogeneous nucleation of material onto the nonconductive sides of the substrates and homogeneous nucleation of metal sulfides in the liquid phase.
In a typical deposition, a 1 cm2 piece of glass or Kapton, coated on one side with a 200 nm thick Mo layer, or 1 cm2 piece of ITO was submerged in 4 mL of an ethylene glycol (Macron Fine Chemicals, ≥99%) solution in a 10 mL glass vial. The solution contained 0.005 mmol copper(II) acetate monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 98+%), 0.025 mmol zinc acetate dihydrate (Acros), 0.025 mmol tin(II) chloride pentahydrate (Acros, 98%), 0.1 mmol thiourea (Riedel-de Haën, ≥98.5%) and 0.086 mmol thioglycolic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 98+%). The substrate was held vertical and 1 cm above the bottom of the reaction vial using a glass holder. Following, the solution and substrate were placed in a 2.45 GHz CEM Discovery S Class microwave reactor for 15 min operated at 40 W. The vial and its contents were cooled by flowing room temperature air at 30 psig through a 6 mm inner diameter orifice. The solution temperature at the bottom of the vial was monitored using the integrated infrared sensor. The solution reaches a steady-state temperature of ∼80 °C in ∼5 min. After the reaction, the microwave power was turned off and the sample cooled to room temperature by air flow. Finally, the sample was removed and rinsed with isopropanol. By refreshing the precursor solution and repeating the microwave treatment, thicker films were prepared (maximum of 3 cycles in this study).
Following the last growth stage, films were annealed by submerging washed samples in 4 mL of octadecene (Sigma-Aldrich, 90%) followed by microwave irradiation at 60 W for 30 min using a cooling air pressure of ∼1 psig and no stirring. The solution reached a maximum solution temperature after ∼10 min of ∼160 °C. The substrate was then rinsed with isopropanol prior to analysis.
When conductive-film coated substrates were immersed in the precursor solution and irradiated with microwave energy, CZTS thin films were deposited only on the conductive side of substrates. While the solution also heats as a result of microwave energy absorption, the cooling air serves to limit the increase in solution temperature. No evidence of homogeneous nucleation of CZTS or any other solid particles was detected, and the solution remained optically clear with no color change. Furthermore, the backside of the substrate is nonconductive and microwave transparent. The microwave energy was strongly absorbed only by the thin conductive coating, preferentially heating it to temperatures high enough to enable selective thermolysis of precursors and deposition of CZTS directly onto the conductive coating. We surmise that the small thermal mass of the conductive layer and high heat transfer coefficient between the liquid and substrate creates steep temperature gradients away from the conductive layer. The compressed air cooling limits the solution temperature to below that which would favor precipitation of metal sulfides, including CZTS. The temperature differential between the conductive substrate and the solution allows for the formation of thin chalcogenide films exclusively onto the conductive side of the substrate, without forming sulfide nanoparticles in the solution. Visual inspection demonstrated the deposition of dark brown material on the conductive side of the substrates only. Results reported here focus on the Mo-coated glass substrates.
To identify materials formed, a suite of characterization methods was employed (see ESI† for more information). Fig. 1(a and b) shows the plan view SEM micrographs of a typical film and demonstrates the formation of a thin film onto the conductive side of the Mo-coated substrates. The films have continuous uniform coverage over hundreds of microns.

Compositional analysis by standardless energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was consistent with the formation of CZTS. The experimentally determined stoichiometry was Cu2Zn0.87Sn0.91Sx, normalized to copper. While sulfur content was not quantified due to its overlap with the molybdenum peaks, data from XRD and Raman spectroscopy are consistent with a nominally stoichiometric CZTS, with x = 4. No evidence of carbon or oxide impurities was detected by EDS.
XRD patterns of the as-synthesized films on Mo-coated glass are shown in Fig. 2(a). The diffraction patterns are consistent with the Kesterite phase (JCPDS 26-0575) of CZTS, with an average crystallite size of ∼12 nm as calculated from the full width at half maximum of the 112 reflection using the Debye–Scherrer equation. No evidence for other phases can be discerned from the diffraction patterns, though the XRD data alone cannot exclude the possible formation and presence of materials crystallographically similar to CZTS, including ZnS and Cu2SnS3.22 Complementary to XRD, Raman scattering was used to test for the presence of the ZnS and Cu2SnS3 and other possible phases. Fig. 3(a) shows the Raman spectra of as-synthesized films. The representative CZTS peak at 338 cm−1 is evident in Fig. 3, and there are no peaks at 475 cm−1, which rules out the presence of copper sulfides. Ruling out Cu2SnS3 and ZnS is still more difficult because of the width of the Raman peaks and small crystallite size. Nevertheless, the Raman scattering from our films resembles those observed from colloidal CZTS nanocrystal dispersions.19

To investigate the use of microwave energy for annealing of nanocrystalline sulfide films the substrates, films deposited onto Mo-coated glass substrates were annealed using microwave heating in octadecene. Fig. 4(a and b) shows the plan view SEM micrographs of the CZTS thin films on Mo-coated glass substrate following microwave annealing at 60 W for 30 min in 4 mL of neat octadecene. After annealing, the CZTS films retain their continuous and uniform appearance and have no signs of cracking or delamination. Cross sectional micrographs (Fig. 4(c and d)) and the histogram (Fig. S3, ESI†) show the films have an average thickness of 1.4 μm, with a minimum of 0.37 μm and a maximum of 2.5 μm. The crystallite growth by microwave annealing exploits the high microwave absorption by the conductive films, again allowing for high temperatures at the surface of the films while solution temperatures remain comparatively low. Importantly, the solution temperature during annealing were observed to reach only 160 °C, which would be appropriate for annealing on some types of polymer flexible substrates.

Cross sectional SEM micrographs (c, d) of the CZTS thin films annealed using microwave heating in octadecene show no signs of delamination. The average film thickness is 1.4 μm. 
Microwave annealing of CZTS films on conductive substrates resulted in an eightfold increase of average particle volume. XRD from annealed films (Fig. 2(b)), show a narrower peak width and Debye–Scherrer analysis indicates that the crystal domain size has increased from 12 nm to 24 nm. The XRD is otherwise identical to that of the as-deposited films indicating that new impurity phases have not formed during annealing. Similarly, the Raman spectrum of the annealed film in Fig. 3(b), exhibits narrower peak widths. By modifying the solution chemistry of the annealing solution, larger gains in crystallite size, which would be necessary to produce films suitable for photovoltaic devices, are expected.
A facile synthesis technique for CZTS thin films directly onto conductive substrates is reported for the first time. Our method exploits preferential heating of conductive substrates by microwave energy in homogeneous solutions of precursors. XRD, SEM, EDS, and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate the formation polycrystalline thin films that are nominally stoichiometric and phase-pure CZTS. Films with thicknesses (1–3 μm) can be deposited in a short period. Microwave annealing of the as-synthesized films in solvent can increase the crystallite size without formation of new impurity phases or delamination and at temperatures suitable for flexible polymer substrates.
