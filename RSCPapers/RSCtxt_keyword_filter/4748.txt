    , Accepted 7th February 2016First published on 9th February 2016AbstractWe have presented a detailed analysis of the phase transition kinetics and binding energy states of solution processed methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) thin films prepared at ambient conditions and annealed at different elevated temperatures. It is the processing temperature and environmental conditions that predominantly control the crystal structure and surface morphology of MAPbI3 thin films. The structural transformation from tetragonal to cubic occurs at 60 °C with a 30 minute annealing time while the 10 minute annealed films posses a tetragonal crystal structure. The transformed phase is greatly intact even at the higher annealing temperature of 150 °C and after a time of 2 hours. The charge transfer interaction between the Pb 4f and I 3d oxidation states is quantified using XPS.
1. Introduction
The world's energy consumption is moving towards renewable energy resources, mainly solar energy due to environmental concerns related to global warming and sustainability. The challenge has always been the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy in an efficient and cost-effective way. Though crystalline silicon dominates the photovoltaic industry with efficiencies over 20%, it remains relatively expensive to manufacture.1 In silicon photovoltaics, the substantial reduction of the manufacturing cost is highly required to assure the mass production and to fulfil future energy consumption demands.2 Recently, single or multiple solution processes have been introduced to fabricate dye-sensitized,3 quantum dot,4 and polymer solar cells5 at low temperatures and the manufacturing cost of these cells are cheaper than silicon cells; however, they still suffer from long-term stability and low power conversion efficiency (PCE) as a result of fundamental energy losses occurring at the heterojunction interface.6
Perovskite solar cells have emerged as leaders in photovoltaic technologies and seem to contribute to large scale solar energy production due to their high PCEs and compatibility with scalable processes and are a promising alternative to conventional silicon solar cells.7 Especially the MAPbI3 perovskite light harvester, as having a direct band gap of about 1.45–1.6 eV, high carrier mobility, large absorption coefficients and the ability to form very high quality crystals rapidly at low temperature are added advantages.8 The introduction of MAPbI3 as a sensitizer in electrolyte based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was marked as the beginning of perovskite-based photovoltaic technology.9 Consequently, the planar heterojunctions and mesoscopic metal oxide structured solar cells start with increased efficiency.10 Since the first work published on MAPbI3 perovskites, a set of prominent ideas have been stimulated over past few years with different feasible methodologies focused only on achieving higher efficiency, but lacking identification of the cause of perovskite degradation when exposed to air.11,12
The hygroscopic nature of the methylammonium (MA) cation traps moisture from the air which increases the crystal size along with causing contamination. However, moisture is not the only problem for degradation, even perovskite devices processed in an inert (N2) atmosphere also undergo destabilization.12,13 The device interface may also play a crucial role in the degradation mechanism.14 This issue has grown as a big concern for fabricating perovskite-based photovoltaic devices on a large scale. It is mainly due to a lack of understanding of their physical properties. In this work, we have intensely focused on investigating the phase transition kinetics and surface binding states of MAPbI3 thin films prepared at ambient conditions and processed at different temperatures such as 60 °C, 100 °C, and 150 °C and tried to understand the real issues affecting the perovskite over the fundamental physical properties, beyond the concern of photovoltaic efficiency. Here, we report a MAPbI3 thin film prepared on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate under atmosphere. It is a highly challenging task to make a uniform coverage of the perovskite film on FTO using spin coating in an ambient atmosphere. Accordingly, we optimized the parameters, such as concentration of both methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) spin speed with respect to the number of layers deposited, and annealing time and temperature, and utilized different solvents based on their dielectric constant to help us to achieve uniform film coverage with stability. Subsequently, the samples were employed in different physical characterization techniques to examine the quality of the film through structural and morphological properties. The phase transition occurs at 60 °C for the films annealed for 30 minutes and the noticeable changes in the binding states according to atmospheric effects are discussed in this work.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the MAPbI3 thin film
The FTO substrates (7–10 Ω cm−1, Hartford Glass Corporation) were well-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with ethanol, acetone and deionized water sequentially for 10 minutes each followed by drying under N2 gas. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received unless otherwise stated. The MAPbI3 perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving a 2:1 molar ratio of MAI and PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirring at 60 °C overnight. The MAPbI3 precursor solution was drop cast on FTO for three consecutive cycles at an optimized spin speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s. After spin coating, each set of films was annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C or 150 °C in air for 10, 30, 60 or 120 minutes.
2.2 Characterization
The phase identification of the spin-coated MAPbI3 perovskite films were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8-Advance) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 Å) source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA in the range of 10–60°. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed using an Optizen 3220 UV spectrophotometer in the 400–800 nm wavelength range. The morphology of the films was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Hitachi, model S-4200) operated at 15 kV, 150 W. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (UK) ESCALAB 250 system with monochromatic Al Kα radiation at 1486.6 eV and with an electron take off angle of 45°. The measurement was conducted without ion etching, to avoid reconfiguration of the bonds. The pressure of the chamber was kept at 10−10 Torr during the measurement. The survey spectrum was scanned in the binding energy (BE) range of 100–1200 eV in scan steps of 1 eV with a spot size of 500 μm. All of the obtained binding energy values were corrected using the fixed core level peak of adventitious carbon (C 1s) at 284.6 eV as a reference. We used the lowest possible number of components to fit the data satisfactorily. The uncertainty in the binding energy position was within 0.05 eV for a particular component. Peak fitting and quantitative analysis were done using the Casa XPS program (Casa Software Ltd) and the results were justified using an average matrix relative sensitivity factor (AM-RSF) with respect to the peak area and atomic sensitivity factor of the identified components. The binding energy of the identified components was assigned from the NIST X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Database (NIST Standard Reference Database 20, Version 4.1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural analysis
XRD analysis was carried out to understand the effect of temperature on the structural properties of the MAPbI3 films processed in atmospheric conditions. Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD for the MAPbI3 films annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C and 150 °C for 10 minutes. The diffraction peaks of FTO at 26.52, 33.67, and 37.75° are assigned to the (222), (314) and (200) lattice planes, respectively. The MAPbI3 thin films have a preferential orientation with a = 8.789 Å and c = 12.567 Å axes for a tetragonal perovskite structure at RT with the (110), (202), (220), (310), (224), (314) and (330) lattice planes corresponding to the 14.10, 24.5, 28.50, 31.87, 40.55, 43.17 and 44.60° (2θ) diffraction positions, respectively.15,16 The indexing was performed by the relative combination of planar-spacing and Bragg's law, which determined the unit cell parameters from the peak positions.17,18 The intensity of the MAPbI3 characteristic peaks gradually increased with decreasing full width at half maximum when the annealing temperature was increased, along with few peaks disappearing and new minor peaks appearing at 150 °C due to the elimination of defects. The substantial changes in the MAPbI3 perovskite crystal structure from tetragonal to cubic occurs at 60 °C through unit cell distortion and this crystal structure is maintained even at 150 °C with increased grain size. Fig. 1(b) shows XRD spectra of MAPbI3 thin films annealed at 60 °C for 30, 60 and 120 minutes. Even though, the crystal growth has been initiated at RT itself, the film structure is significantly reformed at 60 °C annealed for 30 minutes. It is observed that the shifting of MAPbI3 characteristic peaks occurs towards the lower angles and new peaks appear for the (111), (112), (004), (312) and (324) lattice planes corresponding to the 19.59, 20.85, 28.80, 46.24, 46.75° (2θ) positions, respectively. The diffraction peak of (220) that splits into the (004) and (220) crystal planes for the films annealed at 60 °C for 30 minutes indicates the structural transformation of MAPbI3 from the tetragonal to the cubic crystal structure19 and is shown in Fig. 2. However, there is no significant change in the crystal structure observed even when the annealing time is increased up to 120 minutes at 60 °C. Parallel results are obtained for higher annealing temperatures of 100 °C and 150 °C, as is shown in Fig. 3. The phase transformation of the perovskite from tetragonal to cubic is schematically represented in Fig. 4. The transformed phase is highly conserved at the longer annealing time of 120 minutes and higher annealing temperature of 150 °C. The phase transition of perovskite is mainly due to its low tolerance factor of 0.83 and the alteration of the d spacing upon annealing.8 The tetragonal crystal structure exhibited below 60 °C is distorted by the thermal vibration of the lattice planes upon annealing by the rotational disorder of MA+ ions due to the short relaxation and the atomic disordering of iodide (I−) ions, which may decrease or increase its symmetry in the way of expansion or contraction.20,21

The tetragonal symmetry has been distorted only along one preferential axis, which changes the unit cell dimensions and generates more diffraction lines as well as shifts in its peak positions. The average grain sizes were calculated using Scherrer's formula (eqn (A) in the ESI†)22–24 and are 36.0, 39, 47.7, and 59.1 nm for the films annealed at 60 °C for 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes, respectively.
3.2 Optical and morphological studies
UV-visible spectroscopy studies were carried out to investigate the thermal effects on the electronic band gap of MAPbI3 thin films. Fig. 5(a) shows the absorption spectra of the MAPbI3 thin films annealed for 10 minutes at different temperatures. The exciton state in the organic–inorganic interface of MAPbI3 is mainly associated with the bandgap of the inorganic layers which deliver a sharp peak even at RT.25,26 The absorption spectra exhibits a very wide spectral response over the entire visible range, the exciton peak appears in the range of 400–450 nm and onset of absorption is between 700 and 800 nm. Fig. 5(b) shows the absorption spectra of films annealed at 60 °C for 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes to further examine the variation of the band gap. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the UV-Visible spectra of MAPbI3 perovskite annealed at 100 °C and 150 °C for 1 and 2 hours and shows very little influence on absorption and band gap energy. It is observed that the absorption onset shifts towards the longer wavelength region with increased annealing temperature and time. The reduced optical bandgap energy with respect to annealing temperature and time is because of the increased grain size.27,28 The band gaps of the MAPbI3 films were estimated using the absorption spectrum fitting (ASF) method,29,30 where the absorption coefficient as a function of wavelength (λ) is (1)Here, λg, c, and h are the wavelength corresponding to the optical bandgap, the velocity of light and Planck's constant, respectively.

Using Beer–Lambert's law in eqn (1): (2)Here  and B2 are constants.

Eqn (2) was used to estimate the bandgap using the ASF method without the need of the film thickness. The value of the band gap in eV can be calculated from the parameter λg using (3) The λg value can be calculated from Fig. 6(a–d) by extrapolating the linear region of  Here, m is the index that depends on the nature of the optical transition. For direct band gap materials m = 1/2 and m = 2 for indirect band gap materials.31
 Fig. 6  ASF plots for the MAPbI3 thin film at (a) RT and those annealed at (b) 60 °C, (c) 100 °C, and (d) 150 °C for 10 minutes. 

Fig. 6 shows the band gap energies for the film prepared at RT and those annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C, and 150 °C for 10 minutes and they are 1.73, 1.66, 1.62, and 1.56 eV, respectively. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the perovskite films annealed at 100 °C and 150 °C for 1 and 2 hours have minor changes in their bandgaps of 1.55, 1.53, 1.52, and 1.51 eV, respectively. Upon annealing, the bandgap may also decrease due to the thermal vibrations of the organic (MA+) crystal ions that weakly interact with the inorganic species (Pb) via intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurring through the NH3+ group, which predominantly reduces the surface energy of organic–inorganic interfaces.32,33 It is also suggested that a longer annealing time increases the grain size by the agglomeration of grains at the surface of the film, as confirmed in the XRD and morphological analysis.
The SEM images (Fig. 7(a–d)) depict the thermal effects on the surface morphology of the MAPbI3 perovskite at RT and those annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C and 150 °C for 10 minutes under ambient atmosphere. Instantly after spin coating, the film is covered with quite a high number of pinholes, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Upon annealing at 60 °C, the number of pinholes have reduced that stimulate the formation of tightly packed agglomerated grains at the surface until the crystallization is completed at the bottom layer of MAPbI3 perovskite. If the annealing temperature is increased to 100 °C, the size of the grains increases with voids in between due to the agglomeration of small islands to become larger crystallites, as is shown in Fig. 7(c). The formation of still larger crystallites associated with the voids in between is observed at 150 °C (Fig. 7(d)). The change in surface morphology due to annealing is mainly caused by the excess surface energy gained from the lattice which tends to increase the rate of perovskite crystallization at the organic–inorganic interfaces of MAPbI3 in air.34

Fig. 7(e and f) illustrate the morphological transformation of the MAPbI3 perovskite from agglomerated crystals (Fig. 7e) to densely arranged needle like crystals. It is suggested that the change in annealing time facilitates the surface tension to upsurge the rate of perovskite crystallization by stretching the bonds at the surface of the MAPbI3 film.35,36 This extended surface energy may be minimized if the atoms have enough energy and time to diffuse to lower energy nucleation sites.37,38 At lower annealing temperatures, large numbers of critical nucleation sites are formed that tend to form smaller crystallites and higher annealing temperatures result in fewer nucleation sites, causing the formation of larger crystallites at the surface.
3.3 Surface analysis of the MAPbI3 perovskites
The XPS spectra were recorded to investigate the interaction of organic–inorganic species in the MAPbI3 thin films and to understand the impact of annealing on the elemental chemical states and relative surface elemental composition. The XPS survey spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The small features at binding energies of 284.7, 401.0 and 531.0 eV correspond to the photoelectron peaks of C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively. The doublet peaks of I and Pb are located at 618 and 137 eV, respectively, with spin orbit splitting.39 The elemental surface composition of MAPbI3 is depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

3.3.1 High resolution X-ray photoelectron (HRXPS) spectra of the MAPbI3 thin films. 
High resolution XPS spectra were acquired over much restricted ranges to evaluate the thermal effects on the different chemical states of the same element and the atomic concentration. Typically, the atomic concentration of the element was extracted from the core-level spectra using the CASA XPS software with the average matrix relative sensitivity factors (AM-RSFs)40,41 according to eqn (B), given in the ESI† (Fig. S3, ESI†). The XPS data were fitted with Gaussian–Lorentzian (30% Gaussian) functions and a Shirley type background.42 The core-level spectra of C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s for the MAPbI3 perovskite at RT and the films annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C, and 150 °C for 10 minutes are shown in Fig. 8(a–l). The deconvoluted characteristics of the carbon peaks exhibited the bound state of the carbon species with atmospheric oxygen, shown in Fig. 8(a–d). At RT, the peak at 283.17 eV is assigned to the aliphatic hydrocarbon (C–H/C–C) and the peak at 283.97 eV corresponds to the hydroxyls (C–OH). The next higher binding energy peak at 284.84 eV corresponds to the carbon atoms bonded to single nitrogen atoms (C–N). The carbon adjacent to (CO) is the most electron withdrawing environment and corresponds to the peak at 285.81.43 This distortion causes the variation of atomic concentration of the C 1s components and is given in Fig. 8(a–d).
 Fig. 8  XPS core-level spectra of (a–d) C 1s, (e–h) O 1s, and (i–l) N 1s for the MAPbI3 thin films at RT and annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C, and 150 °C for 10 minutes in air. 
The hygroscopic nature of the MAPbI3 thin films was subjected to surface oxidation when exposed to air. Fig. 8(e–h) show the O 1s core level spectra deconvoluted into five oxygen binding states located at 530.51, 531.17, 532.06, 532.16 and 533.22 eV that come from weakly adsorbed O molecules from air, hydroxyls (C–OH), carbonyls (CO), (C–O) and aliphatic O–C–O, respectively, for the film at RT and those annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C, and 150 °C. It is found that MAPbI3 films are drastically affected by surface oxidation resulting from chemisorbed or dissociated oxygen species. It is clear that the variation in the atomic percentage of O 1s is mainly attributed to the elimination of weakly bonded organic components at higher annealing temperature.44 The reduction of chemisorbed O and carbonyl (CO) species at 150 °C leads to the appearance O–CO and OC–N species at the higher binding energies of 534.64 and 535.42 eV, respectively. Fig. 8(i–l) shows the XPS N 1s core level spectra of the MAPbI3 film at RT and films annealed at 60 °C, 100 °C, and 150 °C for 10 minutes. At RT, the N 1s spectrum is deconvoluted to three spectral contributions such as single and double bonded nitrogen atoms with carbon atoms (N–C, NC) and amide ions (–NH2) located at the binding energies 398.70, 398.92, and 399.31 eV, respectively.45 The appearance of an amide group (N–CO) is thermodynamically favourable at 100 °C and 150 °C.
The doublet orbitals of Pb (4f7/2 and 4f5/2) and I (3d3/2 and 3d5/2) are quantified with an area ratio of 3:4 and 2:3 and elemental spin orbit splitting (SOS) of 11.5 and 4.8, respectively, was fixed with an equal FWHM.
Prior to the peak fitting of Pb and I, the transition intensity is measured using two independent quantification regions to avoid the creation of a poor background with high residues. Fig. 9(a–d) show the deconvoluted XPS spectra of the I 3d doublets of 3d5/2 at 619.5 and 631 eV, corresponding to the I3− charge state, and 3d3/2 at 619.37 and 630.87, corresponding to the I2+ charge state. Fig. 9(e–h) show the Pb core-level doublet spectra of 4f7/2 at 138.0 and 142.8 eV, corresponding to metallic lead (Pb), and the 4f5/2 peaks at 137.7 and 142.5 eV correspond to Pb(II).46 The significant change in the surface states of the Pb 4f core levels indicates the surface re-structuring of the Pb atoms into Pb ions with oxygen states upon annealing. Particularly, the Pb(II) species percentage is relatively higher than the metallic Pb, even while increasing the temperature up to 150 °C, which illustrates that the iodine species strongly interact with the Pb species and form donor–acceptor complexes (Pb–I charge transfer interface) between the iodine atoms and Pb atoms.47 The internal charge transfer occurs between the valence states of Pb and iodine (I) atoms such as the low electronegative (Pauling scale 1.87) Pb atom donates its excess unpaired electrons (outermost p subshells) to the highly electronegative (Pauling scale 2.66) iodine (I). During the electron transfer process, the Pb gets oxidized to attain its oxidation state 2+ as a Pb2+ ion and iodine is reduced to an iodide ion (2I−). The remaining unpaired electrons in the 4f valence levels (outermost s subshells) of the Pb atoms have either parallel or anti-parallel orientation to the orbital angular momentum that causes the energy difference in the Pb 4f valence states.

Fig. 10(a–c) shows the HRXPS spectra of C 1s, O 1s, and the N 1s singlet for the MAPbI3 perovskite annealed at 60 °C for 30 minutes. The estimation of binding states with atomic concentration is a significant aspect of revealing the thermal effects on the MAPbI3 perovskite in the XPS spectra. In Fig. 10(a) the C 1s core-level spectra of the 30 minute annealed at 60 °C film exhibited additional binding states due to the presence of epoxy carbons (C–O–C) and carboxylate carbons (O–CO) at 288.03 and 289.33 eV, respectively, compared to the 10 minute annealed film (Fig. 8(b)).46 The increase in the annealing time could incorporate additional oxygen free radicals to the carbon species that would shift the binding energy positions. Moreover, Fig. 10(b) shows the O 1s spectra with additional peaks due to lattice oxygen (O2−), iodate (IO3−) and carboxylates (O–CO) at binding energies of 528.44, 529.95 and 534.76 eV, respectively. It is suggested that the hygroscopic methylammonium cation could have more strongly bonded with the oxygen than the metal–halide (Pb–I) complex under atmospheric conditions in the 10 minute annealed films. In addition, the ionic radius of the organic cation is much larger than those of the inorganic lead and halide ions and hence, an increase in annealing time might have led to the delocalization of the halide free radicals that directly bond to the surface oxygen atoms.48 The noticeable shift in the O 1s maxima could be due to the incorporation of additional oxygen atoms into the distorted lattice of the metal–halide complex. On the other hand, the N 1s core level spectra (Fig. 10(c)) exhibited distinguished binding states of an amide carbonyl (N–CO) at 398.60 eV, and nitrogen singly bonded with oxygen atoms (N–H) at 397.24 eV might be arising from dehydrogenated NH2 binding states.46

Iodine exhibits a very strong interaction with atmospheric oxygen since the doublets of 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 have been deconvoluted into three distinguished valence states corresponding to iodide (I−) at 629.33 and 617.83 eV, triiodide (I3−) at 619.01 and 630.49 eV, and iodite (IO2−) at 620.20 and 631.81 eV, respectively. The increase in annealing time increased the surface oxidation of iodine and lead to the formation of the iodite (IO2−) anion and the I2+ cation, easily reduced to the iodide (I−) anion (oxidation state of −1) in the MAPbI3 perovskite film.50

4. Conclusion
In this work, we studied the effect of temperature on structural, morphology and optical properties of MAPbI3 films with the help of complementary characterization techniques. MAPbI3 thin films are optimized for low-temperature solution process preparations in ambient atmospheric conditions.
Our findings are organized as follows: (a) a structural transition of the MAPbI3 films from tetragonal to cubic occurred at 60 °C, (b) the transformed cubic structure is highly preserved even when the annealing temperature is elevated up to 150 °C, (c) larger aggregated grains are formed at the surface of the MAPbI3 films at higher annealing temperatures and longer times, (d) changing the annealing time results in distinct morphological variance of the MAPbI3 films and (e) the variations in the binding states with atomic concentration of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s states and I 3d, and Pb 4f doublets states according to the annealing temperature were clearly quantified from XPS core-level spectra. The optimization of the MAPbI3 precursor concentrations, solution temperature and spin speed would help to get a uniform and stable perovskite film on FTO substrate in an ambient atmosphere. It is suggested that an annealing temperature of 60 °C for 30 minutes is superior to ensure the perovskite crystallization. We conclude that these results offer a feasible way to achieve a better uniformity of MAPbI3 films under atmospheric conditions. This initial effort is to comprehend the physical properties of MAPbI3 thin films and to reveal the challenges associated with the processing of MAPbI3 films in air. Further device development and characterization is under way to get highly efficient perovskite solar cells fabricated in atmospheric conditions without an organic hole conducting material with good stability.
