    , Accepted 12th May 2017First published on 12th May 2017AbstractAfter rapid progress in the past few years, emerging solar cells based on metal halide perovskites have become a potential candidate to rival and even outperform crystalline silicon photovoltaics (PV) in the marketplace. With high material utilization, easy manufacturing processes, and high power conversion efficiencies >20%, many experts anticipate that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be one of the cheapest PV technologies in the future. Here we evaluate the economic potential of PSCs by developing a bottom-up cost model for perovskite PV modules fabricated using feasible low-cost materials and processes. We calculate the direct manufacturing cost ($31.7 per m2) and the minimum sustainable price (MSP, $0.41 per Wp) for a standard perovskite module manufactured in the United States. Such modules, operating at 16% photoconversion efficiency in a 30-year, unsubsidized, utility-level power plant, would produce electricity at levelized cost of energy (LCOE) values ranging from 4.93 to 7.90 ¢ per kW per h. We discuss limitations in comparing calculated MSPs to actual market prices, determine the effect of module lifetime, examine the effects of alternative materials and constructions, and indicate avenues to further reduce the MSP and LCOE values. The analysis shows that PSCs can emerge as a cost leader in PV power generation if critical remaining issues can be resolved.

Broader context
In the past few years, solar cells based on metal halide perovskites have emerged as a promising technology for high efficiency and low cost photovoltaics (PV). The rapid rise in photoconversion efficiency (PCE) to over 20% coupled with low-temperature solution-based processing has made perovskite solar cells a rival to other more established PV technologies. With advances in large area processing, there is now serious interest in commercializing this promising new PV technology. Consequently, it is important to evaluate the economics of manufacturing and electricity production from perovskite PV. This article presents a detailed technoeconomic model based on production processes that are similar to the high rate, low cost processes that are currently in use for large volume production of CdTe modules. Using this model, we evaluated the minimum sustainable manufacturing price (MSP) and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for perovskite PV modules and identified the most critical factors that influence the costs. Our result shows that perovskite PV would be a low-cost leader with an economic edge over all of the competition.

1. Introduction
To achieve a low levelized cost of energy (LCOE) that rivals the cost of energy from conventional sources, solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies must possess the combined merits of high efficiency, low cost, and long-term stability.1 In the past few years, PV technologies based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, with methylammonium lead iodide being the prototype, have demonstrated remarkable progress.2–8 Extensive research efforts have been undertaken to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from less than 4%9 to more than 22%10 in less than a decade. This latter value makes PSCs comparable to crystalline silicon (c-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), all of which are commercially available terrestrial PV technologies.10 In addition to very high efficiencies, PSCs present opportunities to markedly reduce manufacturing costs due to ease of processing via various solution-based, low-temperature deposition methods11–13 and the potential for roll-to-roll manufacturing on flexible substrates.14 Moreover, preliminary life-cycle assessments show that perovskite solar modules are expected to have lower environmental impacts,15–18 and the important energy payback time (EPBT) metric has been calculated to be shorter for PSCs in comparison to other more established PV technologies.15–19 Although these aspects provide advantages to PSCs, operational instability and lack of durability are major concerns that will limit the use of PSCs on a commercial scale.20,21 Reports of improved stability have appeared recently, with stable operation increased from just a few days to more than 6 months when moisture and UV resistant encapsulation was employed.22 Four months of stable operation has been demonstrated in a field test,23 and 500 to 4000 hours of stable operation has been measured under stress tests.24 Clearly, solving the degradation and instability issues will be essential to allow PSCs to compete in the PV marketplace.25
Another significant impediment to large-scale commercialization of PSCs is the lack of a demonstrated manufacturing process. Several research groups have recently developed deposition techniques to scale-up fabrication from small cells (<1 cm2) to mini-modules with sizes ranging from 4 to 100 cm2, and PCEs up to 12% have been demonstrated.26–31 Recently, a certified efficiency record of 15.2% was reported for a perovskite mini-module.32 From this work it is evident that PSC manufacturing may be able to follow the processing pathways that have been developed for other thin-film PV technologies, such as CdTe. Consequently, researchers and investors have started to seriously consider the potential for commercialization of this promising new PV technology.
Recently, two research groups reported cost assessments for the manufacturing of perovskite PV modules with different device geometries and presented estimates of the associated LCOE.33,34 Cai et al. concluded that perovskite PV modules could be manufactured at ultra-low costs from $30 per m2 to $41 per m2 using simplified module geometries, but the cost estimates did not include back-sealing glass, a junction box, or wiring. Under their assumptions, impressive LCOE values of 3.5–4.9 cents per kW per h, well below the cost of fossil fuels, could be achieved.33 Unfortunately, as stated previously, this study did not properly include all module components in the cost model. More recently, Chang et al. performed a much more complete assessment and estimated manufacturing costs and LCOE values to be in the ranges of $87 to $140 per m2 and 9.0 to 18.6 cents per kW per h, respectively.34 Although this result showed that perovskite PV could be cost-competitive with c-Si and thin-film CdTe modules, the effort underestimated the economic potential due to the choice of impractical module production sequences, the use of costly materials (e.g., Ag and Au), and slow-throughput deposition techniques (e.g., thermal evaporation).
In this contribution we have selected a more manufacturable module configuration that allows the process flow of an actual thin-film PV plant to be followed. Moreover, we have utilized low cost materials that have demonstrated high performance in the lab. We describe a detailed technoeconomic analysis for a reasonable low-cost process and quantitatively assess the manufacturing costs associated with each module processing step. We also consider the sustainable operation of the PV factory, and our analysis shows that the manufacturing costs and LCOE of completed perovskite modules will be substantially lower than the values reported by Chang et al.34
2. Methodology
2.1 Perovskite module cost
The technoeconomic cost analysis was performed for a hypothetical PV manufacturer located in the United States, starting operation in 2020. The manufacturing cost is calculated using an internally developed spreadsheet calculator based on the “bottom-up cost modeling” as used by Powell,35 Goodrich,36 and Woodhouse et al.37,38 In short, we consider the mass-scale manufacturing of perovskite PV modules with a production volume of 200 MWp per year. Projections of potential perovskite module costs have been made following the standard engineering cost estimating methodology in the literature.38–40 To provide a realistic and accurate estimation, we chose a relatively conservative approach (see assumptions in the ESI†) for developing a cost estimation, and analyzed the uncertainties of the most sensitive assumptions.

2.1.1 Reference module assumptions. 
To estimate the module manufacturing cost, we selected a monolithic module geometry based on a rigid glass substrate as the reference module. Currently, a variety of device structures and alternative materials for PSCs are reported in the literature.12 Cai et al.33 and Chang et al.34 both analyzed the so-called “n–i–p” structure, which is comprised of a high-temperature (∼500 °C) processed TiO2 layer as the electron transport material (ETM), an organic hole transport material (HTM), and a noble metal as the back electrode material. This structure, although having demonstrated high PCEs of >20%,4 may not be suitable for manufacturing due to the relatively slow processing and expensive materials. In contrast, here, we consider the “p–i–n” configuration consisting of inorganic metal oxide HTM and ETM (NiO and ZnO, respectively) as the benchmark reference module. This particular PV cell geometry is selected as the reference because it contains feasible low-cost materials and has been demonstrated with high PCEs in laboratories.3,41 Other commonly used structures, including the normal “n–i–p” structure42 and the inverted “p–i–n” type,43 and the materials and processes involved with these structures, are considered as alternatives in the sensitivity analysis.
The perovskite module (Fig. 1) is constructed with the reference perovskite cells and other components that are essential for the module production. The latter, so-called balance of module (BOM) components, include glass plates, interconnection busbars, sealant, lamination film, edge-sealing frame, a junction-box, and wiring. This glass–glass design should provide excellent protection against water-induced degradation,44 is compliant with the environmental regulatory codes and standards,45 and is widely used in the conventional design of commercial thin-film (CdTe46 and CIGS38) PV modules. This glass–glass module configuration also lowers the probability of emission of toxic contents to the environment,47 and eases the environmental concerns associated with using water-soluble Pb-based perovskite materials.48

2.1.2 Manufacturing processes. 
After selecting the reference module, we constructed a representative step-by-step manufacturing process flow diagram (Fig. 2). We assume that a large area, low-temperature deposition technique is used for manufacturing of the perovskite solar modules.49,50 The front and back electrodes, ITO and Al, respectively, are prepared by industrial-scale magnetron sputtering. The charge transport layers, namely NiO and ZnO, are prepared by screen printing followed by a post-deposition heat treatment. We select a single-step screen printing of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI) mixture dissolved in a dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution to deposit the perovskite layer.51 Other techniques such as doctor blade coating,27,52 slot-die coating,14,53 or spraying,31,54 could also be used for manufacturing the envisioned large (∼m2) modules. Note that because the equipment price and energy consumption are approximately the same,49,50 variation of the deposition method does not significantly change the manufacturing cost (vide infra).
 Fig. 2  Flow diagram of manufacturing process for perovskite solar modules. 
The manufacturing cost per unit area of the perovskite module (MC) is calculated by adding up the costs of the individual manufacturing process in Fig. 2 using eqn (1): (1)Here, we consider the costs per unit area ($ per m2) for raw materials (Mi), utilities (Ui, including electricity and water), engineering and production line labor (Li), equipment maintenance (Ei), and depreciation of the equipment and building (Di) in the ith step of the process.
Among these cost categories, materials and utilities costs are directly determined by the selection of the device structure and the manufacturing processes. Labor costs, although perhaps differing from place to place, is expected to be minimized relative to other recurring costs due to automation of the production line. The processing time and the degree of automation for each step is used to estimate the minimum labor cost. The maintenance cost is defined as a fixed percentage (20%) of the costs of equipment and buildings to take into account that expensive equipment will cost more to maintain and repair. Note that changing the method of distributing depreciation costs can vary manufacturing costs in the different periods of production. For instance, a company can depreciate its physical properties in the early period (e.g., the first five years) to avoid adding these costs to its products at the later stages. In this approach, the manufacturing cost can be significantly reduced after the depreciation cost is removed from the balance sheet. To calculate the expected value of the module cost, we selected the linear depreciation method that evenly distributes the costs of the physical property to each year of production throughout the lifetime of the factory. Because there is little publicly available information on the costs and prices from perovskite companies, other assumption details and cost data were obtained from the literature and online sources, including global trading websites, as well as from reports from governments and other organizations (see ESI† for details). This approach assumes that the cost inputs will be the same when commercialization begins, as is typically done in other PV cost assessments.


2.1.3 Minimum sustainable price. 
To estimate the total cost of perovskite modules, we use the minimum sustainable price (MSP) model,35,36,38 which is defined as the minimum selling price at which the internal rate of return (IRR) for the PV manufacturer is equal to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Eqn (2) shows how the MSP value is calculated: (2)Here, the MSP of the solar module is comprised of the direct manufacturing cost of the module (MC), the overhead costs (OH) associated with the manufacturing operations [e.g., sales, general, and administrative (SG&A); research and development (R&D), taxes & interest], and the required WACC; the cost per unit area ($ per m2) is converted to cost per peak DC watt ($ per Wp) by dividing the product of module efficiency (η), and the irradiance power density at the standard test condition (P0 = 1000 W m−2 under AM1.5 illumination).
To simplify the calculation, the OH is assumed to be 15% of the operating revenue plus tax on the operating profit,4 which is typical for comparable industries. The WACC value of 14%,35,38,55 a commonly expected financial return for a PV company in the United States, was used as the expected IRR for the factory. To minimize the influence of uncertainties in the assumptions we allow a normal distribution with a 10% standard deviation on the manufacturing cost, overheads, and WACC, following a previously reported method (see the ESI†).56 The calculated average module MSP is given as the module sale price and used in the LCOE calculations.

2.2 Levelized cost of energy calculation
To further assess the potential solar electricity cost of PSCs, we calculated the LCOE of a PV system employing perovskite PV modules using the System Advisor Model (SAM, version 2016.3.14) developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).57 In general, LCOE is defined as the ratio of the total lifecycle cost of a PV system to the total energy generated during the lifetime the system (eqn (3)):58 (3)where Ci and Ei are the total cost ($) and energy production (kW h) in the ith year, respectively, d is the discount rate, and n is the lifetime of the system.
For a PV power plant with a fixed solar array capacity, the annual energy production (Et) is calculated using eqn (4). Et = P × S × (1 − L) × (1 − r)t(4)where P is the rated power of the solar array, S is the annual solar insolation at the installed location, L is a constant loss factor for the array due to shading, soiling, DC connection, and AC conversion, and r is the system degradation rate (r). The solar insolation data is site specific, representing multi-year averaged analyses that have been collected and curated by NREL.
The annual cost of the system (Ct) can be expressed by eqn (5). Ct = It + Ot + Ft(5)where It is the initial installation cost (It = 0 when t > 0), Ot is the system operating cost, and Ft is the financing costs in year t. The upfront investment for the initial installation (I0) is the major cost component of a PV system. This initial cost includes the PV modules, inverters, other BOS equipment (e.g., racking, wiring, and tracking), installation labor, project overhead costs (e.g., permitting, environmental studies, and designing), grid interconnection, land fees, and taxes. The system operating cost includes an annual cost to maintain the normal operation of the system and the costs for repairing and replacing broken modules and inverters. The financial cost includes project debt interest, tax, insurance, incentives, and internal return of capital investment.
We calculate the LCOE of a 100 MW, single-owner PV power plant installed in Wichita, Kansas and operated under Purchase Power Agreement (PPA). We use the expected PV system cost inputs for the year 202038,59 in the calculation because this new PV technology would take a few years at a development stage before commercialization.60 We exclude subsidies such as the investment tax credit or production tax credit in our calculations because the development of future alternative energy generation technologies should be commercially viable without government incentives. More detailed information on the assumptions may be found in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Manufacturing cost

Fig. 3 shows the direct manufacturing costs for the reference perovskite PV module broken out by processing step and cost category. The estimated manufacturing cost of the reference module is $31.7 ± 5.5 per m2, which consists of $6.8 ± 1.2 per m2 for processing the perovskite cells and $24.9 ± 4.3 per m2 for the associated BOM components (glass, frame, laminating film, junction-box, and testing). As compared with processing costs of $29 per m2 and $27 per m2 (excluding BOM, in 2016 dollars) for CIGS and CdTe cells, respectively, with similar module designs,38,46 the perovskite processing cost is much lower due to the use of lower cost materials, lower energy needs, and less capital-intensive manufacturing processes.
 Fig. 3  (a) Step-by-step direct manufacturing costs of the reference monolithic perovskite PV module. (b) Direct manufacturing cost distribution and (c) materials cost breakdown of the reference module with a total manufacturing cost of $31.7 per m2. 
The dominant cost of the perovskite PV module is the material costs, accounting for 76% of the total cost (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, the cost for the material in the perovskite cell structure only contributes 6.5% to the total material cost (Fig. 3c), and only 1.1% of the total materials cost is attributed to the active materials that form the perovskite “p–i–n” junction (NiO, perovskite, and ZnO). Note that the high absorption coefficient of the perovskite material allows the design of a cell with an ∼300 nm absorber layer thickness while an ∼3 μm thickness is required for other inorganic thin films. The thin perovskite cell structure not only saves material and reduces energy consumption, but also enables high production throughput for the process. The remaining 93.5% of material costs belong to the BOM category (Fig. 3c).
Depreciation from equipment and buildings is the second most significant segment, comprising 13% of the total cost. Due to the high capital costs of the processing facilities, these costs are very sensitive to the process throughputs, which can be influenced by the device architecture and processing design. Chang et al. considered a relatively slow throughput of 0.53 m2 min−1, mainly due to several slow manufacturing processes, such as sintering (TiO2) and thermal evaporation (Ag or Au).38 In contrast, we assumed a 1.44 m2 min−1 throughput in our base case, which is close to a real thin-film PV manufacturing scenario.38Fig. 4 show the impact of processing throughput on the manufacturing cost. Increasing the throughput from 0.53 m2 min−1 to 1.44 m2 min−1 reduces the manufacturing cost by ∼20%. Further increase in the throughput leads to even lower cost, but the effect becomes less significant as the throughput is increased beyond 2.5 m2 min−1.

The sustainable operation of a PV manufacturing factory requires the sale of solar modules at a MSP value (eqn (2)) that covers manufacturing cost, overheads, and WACC.35 Our results show that a perovskite PV manufacturer located in the U.S. can achieve an MSP of $0.41 per Wp for perovskite PV modules with a 16% module efficiency (Fig. 5). Although the MSP is a key metric to determine the actual cost of PV modules, the modeling assumptions can make a significant impact on the estimated MSP due to the potential differences between the real and assumed values of direct and indirect costs, WACC, and module efficiency.59 Consequently, it is useful to examine the standard deviation of the MSP at each module efficiency (Fig. 5) by considering the market price variations of materials and equipement (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†) and 10% uncertainties in other parameters.
 Fig. 5  MSP of the p–i–n structure as a function of module efficiency, with cost breakdown for a 16% module. The calculated MSPs for CIGS,38 CdTe,46 c-Si,39 and n–i–p type perovskite modules34 are adopted from the literature. 
Comparing the $0.41 per Wp MSP for PSCs with the calculated MSP values for other PV technologies, such as CdTe ($0.60 per Wp),46 CIGS ($0.67 per Wp),38 c-Si ($0.64–0.76 per Wp),35,39 and the n–i–p perovskite modules of Chang et al. ($0.57 per Wp),34 the perovskite PV module shows a clear edge on the basis of the MSP. This cost advantage derives not only from the low-cost materials, but also from the low-energy consumption and high throughput manufacturing processes. It is worth noticing that the actual average selling price for both CdTe and Si modules is $0.40–0.50 per Wp at present.61 The low selling price is at least partially due to the fact that technical advances and the potential for cost savings are not fully captured in published cost models, and also at least partially due to price competition from subsidized manufacturing in which all costs are not directly borne by the manufacturer. In the former case, the expanding market creates learning cycles and innovation, as well as savings in the supply chain, which lead to a decline in manufacturing costs. In the latter case, manufacturers are forced to accept reduced profit in order to maintain or gain market share in order to gain access to the aforementioned learning cycles. Consistent with the latter effect being strongly dominant in today's market, market prices for Si and CdTe modules are currently the same61 despite the fact that the technologies and the underlying manufacturing cost structures are very different.39,46 This is an issue, for example, for U.S. manufacturers who must compete with manufacturers from outside the country that are not subject to the same economics.
Despite the differences between the current market prices and those modelled from the bottom-up approach, it is important to note that the data presented in Fig. 5 compares the different technologies under the same basis assumptions (e.g., U.S. manufacturing site, publically available materials prices, similar monetary assumptions, similar labor and energy prices, etc.). Consequently, the lower MSP values for PSC modules relative to the other more established PV technologies should translate into a real advantage in the marketplace, regardless of process innovation or competition issues that lead to lower actual sales prices. We also note that the manufacturing process that we modelled is conservative. If the stability and longevity issues can be solved it should be relatively straightforward to manufacture PSC modules via high-speed, roll-to-roll processes that would be even lower in cost. This possibility would be afforded by capitalizing on the low-temperature, solution processing methods, and replacing the costly rigid glass substrate/back glass combination with polymer,62,63 flexible glass,64,65 or thin metal foils.66
3.2 Variations of perovskite cell structure and deposition method
PSCs have a variety of device structures and alternative materials that could be used for the module fabrication. To determine the sensitivity of the model to the choices that were made, Fig. 6 shows the impact on the MSP if alternative materials and corresponding processes are used. As one would expect, the use of Au in commercial fabrication is highly unlikely due to the high cost increment (+100 ¢ per Wp). In contrast, the use of Ag or graphite paste in the “n–i–p” type structure to form a contact to the HTM results in relatively small changes to the MSP (+2.3 ¢ per Wp and −0.6 ¢ per Wp, respectively), consistent with the analysis by Chang et al.34 Due to varying degrees of complexity in the synthesis and scarcity in the market, the use of organic charge transport materials, P3HT, PCBM, and spiro-OMeTAD, lead to cost increases of 1.2 ¢ per Wp, 28.4 ¢ per Wp and 18.0 ¢ per Wp, respectively. If mass production allows prices of these materials to be reduced, it is possible they could be used in the future. The use of a TiO2 layer to replace ZnO increases the cost by 9.0 ¢ per Wp due to the increased energy consumption and reduced processing throughput associated with a high temperature sintering process. Some less expensive alternatives, such as FTO and PEDOT:PSS, show small price reductions, and thus could be used as substitutions. However, using these cheaper materials to construct the perovskite module results in a MSP value that falls in the uncertainty range of the benchmark reference module. As a result, the reference cell structure is representative of a potential low-cost perovskite PV module.
 Fig. 6  MSP variation with the use of alternative materials and absorber layer processing methods. 
One advantage of perovskite materials is that a variety of different deposition methods such as single-step solution (SSS), two-step solution (TSS), thermal vapor deposition (TVD), and two-step hybrid (TSH) methods, can be used to fabricate the perovskite absorber layer.12 The variation in the module MSP if an alternative processing approach is used is expected to be very small, less than +0.5 ¢ per Wp. In this case, changes are mainly due to decreasing process throughput and the depreciation costs of the additional processing facilities.
3.3 Levelized cost of energy
With MSP values in-hand, we could analyze the LCOE of a PV system constructed with perovskite modules. Input assumptions for the LCOE calculations are tabulated in Tables S4–S6 (ESI†). As a baseline, we used the 16% reference perovskite module, an installed cost of $1.12 per Wp, a lifetime of 30 years, an 0.05% per year degradation rate, 0% project debt and no incentives, and found that a PV power plant located in Wichita, Kansas in the U.S. would achieve a real LCOE of 5.82 ¢ per kW per h in mid 2020. However, the two most significant assumptions for the LCOE calculation are the lifetime and the PCE of the modules. To further explore the influence of these factors, we varied the lifetime of the system from 5 to 30 years and the module efficiency from 10 to 30% (Fig. 7). Under the assumption of a constant $ per m2 module cost, the module MSP varies as a function module efficiency from $0.66 to 0.22 per Wp (Fig. 5). To specify the lifetime, we required that the module have 85% of its rated output at the end of its lifetime, in accordance with industry norms. This led to degradation rates ranging from ∼3% per year to 0.05% per year (Table S7, ESI†), and the analysis period and the IRR target year was then set to equal the lifetime.
 Fig. 7  LCOE for perovskite PV module with different module efficiencies and lifetimes. The 6 ¢ per kW per h SunShot goal and 10 ¢ per kW per h average electricity price in the U.S. are presented in the dotted curves. 

Fig. 7 shows that if a >10% perovskite module in Wichita, Kansas could achieve a lifetime of ∼15 years, the LCOE would be lower than the 10 ¢ per kW per h average price of electricity in the U.S.67 For comparison, the LCOE of utility scale solar PV is currently in the range of 7 to 9 ¢ per kW per h,68 but this fact must be considered with the knowledge that actual selling prices are substantially below calculated MSPs (vide supra). Increasing the module efficiency and reducing the degradation rate reduces the total cost and increases the energy production, leading to a reduced LCOE. The dashed curve in Fig. 7 presents the target LCOE of 6 ¢ per kW per h for a subsidy-free PV infrastructure set forth by the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot program.69 Modules with >15% PCE and a 30 year lifetime, or high efficiency modules with shorter lifetimes, would meet this goal.
The energy yield of a PV system is highly sensitive to insolation and climate, which are a function of location. Fig. 8 shows that the LCOE value for the 16% perovskite module ranges from 4.94 to 7.90 ¢ per kW per h, with a simple national average of 6.30 ¢ per kW per h. Note that these LCOE values are substantially lower than those the 9.0 to 18.6 ¢ per kW per h values presented by Chang et al. simply due to the different cell configurations and manufacturing process.

4. Conclusion
In summary, this analysis and others33,34 indicate strong economic potential for PSCs. Still, there are significant barriers to large-scale commercialization. Barriers include device degradation due to moisture,44 heat and illumination,70 and hysteresis in the current density–voltage characteristics.71 There are also toxicity concerns related to the use of water-soluble lead compounds even though recent studies indicate that environmental impacts would be negligible.15–17,72 These concerns will be further allayed by the development of more environmentally-friendly alternative perovskite materials containing less Pb.73–75 Though issues remain to be addressed, the low LCOE and manufacturing costs that have been determined for PSCs suggest good reason for cautious optimism.
We performed a technoeconomic cost analysis using a bottom-up cost model. We analyzed the critical factors that determine the manufacturing costs for perovskite PV modules and obtained an average cost of $0.41 per Wp for a 16% efficient module. The calculated cost is substantially lower than the value previously determined by Chang et al.34 due to the choice of the n–i–p architecture, lower cost materials, and a more manufacturable process. The LCOE of perovskite PV is estimated to be 5.82 ¢ per kW per h in Wichita, Kansas, if a system lifetime of 30 years can be achieved. The full potential of perovskite PV technology will be unlocked by improving the device stability. If the advances in this emerging PV technology continue, perovskite PV would be a low-cost leader with an economic edge over the competition. Such an economic advantage without subsidies would stimulate a wider degree of PV deployment.

Broader context
In the past few years, solar cells based on metal halide perovskites have emerged as a promising technology for high efficiency and low cost photovoltaics (PV). The rapid rise in photoconversion efficiency (PCE) to over 20% coupled with low-temperature solution-based processing has made perovskite solar cells a rival to other more established PV technologies. With advances in large area processing, there is now serious interest in commercializing this promising new PV technology. Consequently, it is important to evaluate the economics of manufacturing and electricity production from perovskite PV. This article presents a detailed technoeconomic model based on production processes that are similar to the high rate, low cost processes that are currently in use for large volume production of CdTe modules. Using this model, we evaluated the minimum sustainable manufacturing price (MSP) and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for perovskite PV modules and identified the most critical factors that influence the costs. Our result shows that perovskite PV would be a low-cost leader with an economic edge over all of the competition.
