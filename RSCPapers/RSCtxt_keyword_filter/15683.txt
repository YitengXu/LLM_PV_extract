    , Accepted 23rd July 2020First published on 24th July 2020AbstractHighly transparent and active Pt–Mo2C counter electrodes were successfully fabricated by the strong metal–support interaction, with high dispersity of Pt nanoclusters on Mo2C support, which endowed bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells with a rear-to-front efficiency ratio as high as 0.75.
Bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) play an important role in furthering photovoltaic applications because they can utilize photons from different directions and sources for additional power generation.1,2 In particular, DSCs promise multi-color appearances and satisfactory power outputs under insufficient illumination.3–5 These factors endow bifacial DSCs with many potential applications in architectural solar modules and indoor devices.6–8 However, the illumination from the rear side of a DSC suffers from large energy losses because of light reflection, scattering, and adsorption of the counter electrode (CE), electrolyte, and photoanode. Consequently, great efforts have been made to reduce the light absorption of bifacial DSCs illuminating from the rear side.9–13 The constitution and morphology of TiO2 mesoporous film were optimized to decrease the light loss caused by the photoanode.1,9,11 Various kinds of high-transparency electrolytes were designed to replace the light-absorbing I−/I3− redox electrolyte.10,14 Nevertheless, obtaining highly transparent CEs with desirable catalytic activities remains a great challenge.
CEs work based on the electrocatalytic principle, and a common strategy to increase their transparency is to reduce the amounts of light-absorbing electrocatalytic materials, such as the thinning and patterning of the electrocatalytic material films.15–18 However, these methods usually result in an insufficient number of catalytic sites, restricting the catalytic activity of the transparent CEs. Recently, the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) has attracted considerable attention in the research field of catalytic materials, due to its potential to reduce the dosage of catalysts without weakening the activity and stability of the catalyst. SMSIs overcome the cohesive energies of metals and thus prevent metal agglomeration.19,20 Nano-size, even single-atom metal catalytic sites, can be easily produced on the support surface by SMSIs, which results in high catalytic activity because of the extremely large area of the reaction interface.21–23 In addition, the electron transfer between the metal and support caused by the SMSI may lead to unexpected performance enhancements of the catalyst. Various high-efficiency and low-loading catalytic materials, based on the SMSI, have been used in the alcohol fuel electro-oxidation, reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, and CO oxidation.24–26 Ma group utilized SMSIs to develop single-atom Pt/FeOx CEs, but the poor conductivity of the FeOx support material limited the catalytic activities of the CEs.
Herein, we utilized SMSIs to fabricate highly transparent and active Pt–Mo2C CEs for bifacial DSCs. We rationally chose Mo2C as the support for Pt clusters because Mo2C has been reported to exhibit strong interaction with Pt and promising conductivity due to its metal-like electronic structure.27 We carefully investigated the effect of SMSIs on the CEs by comparing the morphologies of the Pt clusters as well as the transmittances and the catalytic activities of CEs based on different supports, including Mo2C, W2C, and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). The Pt–Mo2C CEs promoted the dispersion of small-sized (∼2 nm) Pt clusters by SMSIs. This not only enhanced the availability of Pt to improve the catalytic activity, but it also minimized the light loss of the CEs caused by the inactive materials. Consequently, the DSCs with Pt–Mo2C yielded a high efficiency of 5.5% when illuminated from the rear side, retains as high as 75% of that obtained from the front-side irradiation. The SMSI strategy is effective for developing highly active and transparent electrocatalytic materials, which can be used in various photoelectrochemical systems.
The Mo2C supports were prepared on the cleaned FTO by radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) technology and then were loaded with Pt catalytic sites through immersing deposition method. We named this complex CE as Pt–Mo2C.28,29
The top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) indicated that the Mo2C supports were continuous and uniform without detectable aggregation on the FTO substrates. Transmission electron microscopy images (TEM, Fig. 1(d) and (e)) showed the ultrathin Mo2C supports with a thickness of ∼6 nm. After the Pt deposition, there were no large Pt aggregates on the Mo2C supports observed in the SEM and TEM results, and the diameters of the Pt clusters, determined from the TEM image, were ∼2 nm. The high-resolution TEM image of the Pt clusters showed a crystal lattice with a d spacing of 2.27 Å, which matched well with the (1 1 1) plane of Pt. We attributed the small size and good dispersity of the Pt clusters to the SMSIs between the Pt and Mo2C supports. The existence of these SMSIs has been proven by previous theoretical calculations and used in the devolvement of various high-efficiency catalytic systems. To confirm our hypothesis, we fabricated Pt–W2C CEs (Fig. S2, ESI†) using a similar preparation process to that of the Pt–Mo2C. Pt CEs (HT–Pt), usually used in the high-efficiency DSSCs, were also fabricated using the spinning coating method followed by high-temperature pyrolysis process. As shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S3 (ESI†), the Pt–W2C and HT–Pt CEs exhibited larger Pt aggregates with diameters over 20 nm. The lack of SMSIs between the Pt and support (W2C and FTO) allowed the agglomeration of Pt, leading to large Pt aggregates.

The optical transmittances of the Mo2C supports and Pt–Mo2C on the FTO were examined by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 2) to determine their application potential in bifacial DSCs. The transmittances of Mo2C supports on FTO at 550 nm were only reduced by 3% compared with that of bare FTO. Further loading of the Pt catalytic sites on Mo2C supports led to no evident reduction of transmittances. It should be noted that the preparation process of these Pt–Mo2C CEs was suitable for large-scale DSCs. The photograph in Fig. 2 confirmed the good transparency of the large-scale Pt–Mo2C CEs. In contrast, the HT–Pt CEs on the FTO substrates showed the limited transmittances of less than 60% from 350 to 800 nm. The excellent transmittances of the Pt–Mo2C CEs were attributed to the small size, low loading, and good dispersity of the Pt clusters on the Mo2C supports which prevented light absorption and scattering caused by the Pt aggregates.

We performed a series of electrochemical measurements using the I−/I3− electrolyte to investigate the influence of SMSIs on the electrocatalytic abilities of the CEs. The influence of the chloroplatinic acid solution concentration on the catalytic activity of Pt–Mo2C CEs were carefully studied (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†), and the following discussion is based on the optimized Pt–Mo2C CEs. Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured with a symmetric dummy cell (CE//electrolyte//CE). In the Tafel curves, the intersection of the tangent of the cathode branch and the equilibrium potential represents the exchange current density (J0), and the higher J0 values represent the higher catalytic activities of the CEs. As shown in Fig. 3(a), we calculated the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CEs from the equation: J0 = RT/nFRct, in which R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of transferred electrons during the reaction. The Pt–Mo2C and HT–Pt exhibited similar Rct values of 1.08 and 1.00 Ω cm2, respectively (Table 1). While Pt–W2C possessed larger Rct of 12.03 Ω cm2.

This Rct variation between three CEs was further confirmed by fitting the EIS results using the Z-view software (Table 1). In addition, we extracted the series resistance (Rs) from the EIS results, and the Pt–W2C CE (12.32 Ω cm2) exhibited a greater Rs than the Pt–Mo2C (11.71 Ω cm2) and HT–Pt (11.83 Ω cm2) CE. Both Rct and Rs determine the catalytic activities of CEs. Small Rct values indicate rapid charge transfer from the catalytic sites to the reactants, and the small Rs could reduce the energy loss during the charge transport before the catalytic reaction. Consequently, the Pt–Mo2C CEs showed the high activity comparable to that of HT–Pt. However, the activity of the Pt–W2C CEs was far from satisfactory, as indicated by the large Rct and Rs. It is worthy to mention that the high activity of HT–Pt CEs is related to the high Pt loading resulted from the spinning coating method. A reference CE (Pt–FTO), fabricated on FTO through immersing method similar to that of Pt–Mo2C, shown poor activity (Fig. 3). This suggests the effect of SMSIs on the enhancing the activity of CEs.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were also carried out to discuss the catalytic activities of the three CEs. The smaller peak-to-peak separation (Epp) and the higher reduction current density (Jred) indicated a more efficient catalytic activity. The CV curves in Fig. 3(d) suggested that the Pt–Mo2C possessed the better catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− than the Pt–W2C. Meanwhile, the Pt–Mo2C exhibited excellent catalytic activity in a cobalt redox electrolyte, which would be suitable for the future advancement of bifacial DSCs (Fig. S5, ESI†). Current density–time (J–t), multiple Tafel polarization, and successive CV tests were performed to verify the stability of the Pt–Mo2C.30 The Pt–Mo2C showed no obvious J reduction after long-term J–t (1800 s) and Tafel (180 cycles) tests (Fig. S6(a) and (b), ESI†). The Jred of the Pt–Mo2C decreased by only 7% after a 30-cycle CV test (Fig. S6(c) and Table S2, ESI†). Pt–Mo2C CEs exhibited excellent electrochemical stability in the I−/I3− electrolyte system, which was important for the commercial application of DSCs.
We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to determine the origin of the promising transparency and catalytic activity of the Pt–Mo2C CEs. As shown in Fig. 4, the binding energy of metallic Pt 4f7/2 of the HT–Pt sample was 70.9 eV, whereas the metallic Pt 4f7/2 peak of the Pt–Mo2C signal was 0.61 eV higher than that of HT–Pt.21 This indicated that the electron density of Pt atom was reduced on the Mo2C surface. Previous density functional theory calculations proved that when Pt was incorporated with C atom of Mo2C, the electron density at the Pt sites decreased greatly compared with that of metallic Pt. This electron density reduction indicated the presence of SMSIs in the Pt–Mo2C CEs. In contrast, the binding energy shift of metallic Pt 4f7/2 of the Pt–W2C was much smaller than that of Pt–Mo2C, suggesting that the interactions between Pt and W2C were weaker. SMSIs in the Pt/Mo2C CE prevented the agglomeration of Pt clusters and stabilized the small-size Pt clusters on the Mo2C surface with good dispersity. Nevertheless, the lack of strong interactions in the HT–Pt and Pt–W2C samples did not significantly inhibit the formation of large Pt aggregates with irregular morphologies (as shown in the right part of Fig. 4). Compared with the aggregates, the well-dispersed, small-size Pt clusters maximized the number of Pt atoms on the interface at which the electrocatalytic reaction occurred and endowed the Pt–Mo2C with a promising catalytic activity. Additional peaks at 72.3 and 74.2 eV were observed in the HT–Pt samples, representing the oxidized Pt (PtO and PtO2). These oxidized Pt species were reduced in the Pt–Mo2C and Pt–W2C samples. Both the small sizes of the Pt clusters and reduced the protention of oxidized Pt species in the Pt–Mo2C CEs improved the availability of the Pt catalyst, which was crucial for the activity enhancement and reduction of the light-loss of the CE.

Fig. 5(a) showed the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the bifacial DSCs with Pt–Mo2C and HT–Pt CEs, which were obtained under AM 1.5G illumination from the front and rear sides, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters were collected in Table 2 and the statistics of the J–V curves were listed in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The Pt–Mo2C cell exhibited front-side power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.4%, comparable with that of HT–Pt (7.5%). This further proved the high catalytic activity of the Pt–Mo2C. When the illumination was from the rear side, the PCE of the Pt–Mo2C cell was reduced to 5.5% (Jsc: 12.00 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.70 V, FF: 0.66), which was 75% of the front-side PCE. In comparison, the HT–Pt cell, under rear-side illumination, only retained 60% of the front-side PCE (Jsc: 9.35 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.69 V, FF: 0.69). The high efficiency retention of the Pt–Mo2C cell was attributed to the high-transparency CE. We measured the efficiency of two cells simultaneously irradiated by AM 1.5G light from the front side and the 1400 lux LED from the rear side to simulate the operation of bifacial DSCs. The current density of Pt–Mo2C increased by 990 μA cm−2 after adding the weak light on the rear side, while that of HT–Pt only increased by 230 μA cm−2 (Fig. 5(b)). These results indicate that Pt–Mo2C CEs have great potential as high-performance bifacial DSC.

In summary, the transparent and active Pt–Mo2C counter electrodes for bifacial DSCs were successfully prepared based on the strong metal–support interactions between Pt and Mo2C. The essential effect of the Mo2C supports in providing strong interactions for loading Pt catalysts was clearly demonstrated by comparing the Pt 4f binding energies on the Mo2C, W2C, and FTO surfaces, which ensured ultra-small sizes (∼2 nm) and good dispersity of the Pt clusters in the Pt–Mo2C CEs. As a result, the Pt–Mo2C CEs showed comparable catalytic activity to that of HT–Pt but exhibited much higher transmittance. The satisfactory transparency and catalytic activities of the Pt–Mo2C CEs generated the high rear efficiencies of the bifacial DSCs, which retained 75% of the PCEs of the front illumination. The retention of the DSCs with HT–Pt CEs illuminated from the rear side was only 60%. Our results provide a strategy to construct CEs with ultra-small sizes and good dispersity of the Pt catalyst, which could be utilized not only for the development of low-cost DSCs, but also for promoting the application of bifacial and transparent DSCs in in-door and building-integrated photovoltaics.
