    , Accepted 11th May 2012First published on 14th May 2012AbstractTwo new truxene-based organic sensitizers (M15 and M16) featuring high extinction coefficients were synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells employing cobalt electrolyte. The M16-sensitized device displays a 7.6% efficiency at an irradiation of AM1.5 full sunlight.
Research on replacing the conventional iodide/triiodide electrolyte system in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) with Co-complex based redox couples has recently received great attention because of their low corrosiveness, low visible light absorption, and especially high redox potential, which enables attainment of high photovoltages.1–3 Recently studies have shown that cobalt redox couples can give impressively high efficiencies comparable to iodide/triiodide electrolyte by using organic dyes. By employing a combination of an zinc porphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8) and an organic dye (Y123) in conjunction with tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II/III) redox couple, Grätzel et al. showed a 12.3%-efficiency DSC.1 The efficiency exceeds those obtained with today’s best ruthenium sensitizers. Wang et al. explored tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttles in conjunction with triphenylamine-based organic dyes to fabricate DSCs displaying power conversion efficiency of 5.8–9.4%.2 Boschloo and Hagfeldt et al. reported triphenylamine-based organic dye-sensitized DSCs employing tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttles displaying the best efficiency of 6.7%.3 An advantage of the cobalt electrolyte over the iodide/triiodide redox couple is that very high open-circuit voltages can be realized but without sacrificing short circuit photocurrent or fill factor. However, simply replacing the iodide/triiodide couple in the DSCs by cobalt redox couples may led to poorly performing devices with low photovoltages and photocurrents, which has been attributed to slow mass transport and increased recombination of photoinjected electrons with oxidized redox species in the electrolyte.3b,4 To overcome the mass transport limitation associated with the polypyridyl cobalt redox shuttles, a relatively thin titania film is always needed. Additionally, to meet the requirements of effective light harvesting and retard the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film to the Co(III) ions, developing new classes of photosensitizers with high extinction coefficients, suitable electronic structures and steric properties is warranted.
In our previous study, we have explored triarylamine organic dyes containing a functionalized-truxene unit for DSCs based on iodine electrolyte.5 The hexapropyltruxene group on the dyes retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film to the I3− ions, which enables attainment of high photovoltages approaching 800 mV. In addition, these truxene-based dyes display high extinction coefficients apart from their ability of retarding charge recombination. It is expected that these truxene-based dyes could show interesting performance in the cobalt redox couple system.
In this work, two new truxene-based organic sensitizers (M15 and M16, Fig. 1) bearing binary π-conjugated linkers were designed, synthesized and characterized. To tune both the electronic structures and steric properties of linker, benzene ring and 3-methylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (MTT) were introduced, bringing on an opportunity to understand the dye structure–performance relationship of iodine-free dye-sensitized solar cells. Syntheses of dyes M15 and M16 are described in detail in ESI† (Scheme S1 and S2).
 Fig. 1  The molecular structures of M15 and M16. 
Both the dyes have a relatively broad and strong absorption in the UV and visible region (Fig. 2a). The absorption spectrum of M15 shows an absorption maximum (λmax) centered at 498 nm (ε = 7.6 × 104 M–1 cm–1), which is assigned to the π–π* transition. M16 shows a broad absorption spectrum covering a wide range of the visible region with a superior light-harvesting efficiency relative to M15 (λmax = 500 nm, ε = 8.1 × 104 M–1 cm–1) due to the stronger electron-donating nature of MTT and relatively smaller torsion angles between the plane of the donor and that of the acceptor (Fig. S11†), which is desirable for harvesting more solar light. It is noted that both the dyes have high extinction coefficients compared to ruthenium-based dyes (e.g. N719,6 1.47 × 104 M–1 cm–1), which is desirable for thin-layer DSCs.

To obtain and understand the molecular orbital energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with TiO2 film (5.5 μm) stained with sensitizer as the working electrode (Fig. S4†). The HOMO levels of M15 and M16 are calculated to be 0.91 and 0.90 V (vs. NHE), respectively, which are more positive than the [Co(II/III)(phen)3]n+ (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) and I−/I3− redox couples (0.62 V3b and 0.4 V vs. NHE,7 respectively). In this work, the driving forces for dye regeneration of the dyes are around 0.5 eV for the iodine control cells, indicating the driving forces for dye regeneration are sufficient for the iodine control cells.8 Recently, Wenger et al. has proved that efficient regeneration of sensitizers with as little as a 0.15 eV driving force between the oxidation potential of the sensitizer and the redox potential of the mediator is possible.9 In the cobalt control cells, the calculated driving forces for dye regeneration of M15 and M16 are 0.29 and 0.28 eV, respectively. Considering the fact that cobalt control cells presented comparable JSC values to that of iodine control cells (see next section) it can be stated that the driving forces in the cobalt control cells were sufficient to regenerate most of these dyes. On the other hand, the LUMO of M15 and M16 (−1.28 and −1.26 V vs. NHE, respectively) are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE). Assuming that an energy gap of 0.2 eV is necessary for efficient electron injection,10 these driving forces are sufficiently large for effective electron injection.
Using the dyes as sensitizers, we compared the photovoltaic performances of DSCs employing a cobalt electrolyte with those employing an iodine electrolyte. A relatively thin titania film (5.5 μm) is employed so as to avoid the mass transport limitation of the cobalt redox couple and to minimize interfacial charge recombination. The cobalt electrolyte is composed of 0.25 M [Co(II)(phen)3](PF6)2, 0.05 M [Co(III) (phen)3](PF6)3, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile. For comparison, an iodine electrolyte consisting of 0.25 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiTFSI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile was formulated.
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices measured under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3 and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open–circuit photovoltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of a M16-sensitized cell with the cobalt electrolyte are 11.9 mA cm−2, 830 mV and 0.70, respectively, affording an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.9%. In comparison the M16-sensitized cell with the iodide electrolyte exhibits an slightly increased JSC of 12.2 mA cm−2 but a remarkably decreased VOC of 675 mV, leading to a relatively lower PCE of 5.6%. For the M15-sensitized solar cells based on the cobalt electrolyte, we again observe an obvious improvement of VOC to 810 mV, but significant decreased JSC to 9.8 mA cm−2, leading to an attenuated PCE compared to corresponding iodine-based cell. This discrepancy of JSC is well consistent with the IPCE measurements (Fig. 2b).

The concentration of TBP was found to be crucial in the cobalt cells. Cobalt electrolytes with different concentration of TBP were prepared for DSC application and corresponding experimental results are shown in Fig. S5†. Under the optimized condition, cells containing 0.8 M TBP gave the best efficiency among all the cobalt electrolytes. As presented in Fig. 3, the lower rate of electron recapture by [Co(III)(phen)3] for M16-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film allows very high VOC to be realized, with this sensitizer reaching a value of 900 mV in full sunlight without sacrificing short circuit photocurrent or fill factor. The advantage in voltage of M16 over M15 is maintained at lower light levels, down to 10 mW cm−2 solar intensity (Fig. S8†). The cumulative increases of VOC and FF give rise to an efficiency of 7.6% at AM 1.5 global full sun. M15-sensitized cells also display similar features. This phenomenon has also been observed by Yella et al.1 These results confirm that for M16, the Co(II/III)tris(phen) redox couple outperforms the I−/I3− redox couple for thin-film DSCs.
It is noteworthy that the dye alteration from M15 to M16 in the iodine cells (with 0.5 M TBP) have caused a VOC attenuation of 81 mV (756 vs. 675 mV), sharply contrasting a 20 mV enhancement (810 vs. 830 mV) in the cobalt cells (with 0.5 M TBP). The opposite VOC variation for the iodine and cobalt cells from M15 to M16 is intriguing. To clarify the origin of our observation, the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface (RCT) was modelled from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a function of EF,n level, as shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Plots of Rctvs. EF,n level of the cobalt cells and the iodine cells. 
The charge recombination resistance is related to the charge recombination rate, such that a smaller RCT means the larger charge recombination rate. For the cobalt cells, RCT increases in the order of M15 < M16, indicating a same order of decreased charge recombination rate. In iodine cells, an opposite result was observed. It is known that the halogen bonding between iodine and some electron-rich segments of dye molecules could cause a larger charge recombination rate at the titania/electrolyte interface.11 It is suspected that the RCT variation of the dyes in different electrolytes is probably related to the adverse impact of possible halogen bonding on interfacial charge recombination in DSCs. M16 containing MTT with more interaction sites (sulfur atom) prefers formation of dye–iodine complexes in comparison with M15. Thereby, the increasing I3− concentration at the vicinity of the TiO2 decreases the electron lifetimes (τ, extracted from the Cμ and RCT using τ = CμRCT,12 Fig. S10†), leading to a lower VOC for M16-sensitized cells. In cobalt cells, the VOC of M16-sensitized cells higher than those of M15 can be partially ascribed to the absence of this non-covalent interaction between the dyes and electrolytes. These results suggest that organic dyes with thiophene derivates as linkers are suitable for iodine-free DSCs.
To summarize, the feasibility of employing truxene-based organic dyes for high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cell free of a corrosive iodine electrolyte has been demonstrated. The hexapropyltruxene group on the dyes retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film to the Co(III) ions, which enables attainment of high photovoltage up to 900 mV. The photovoltaic performance of the cobalt redox couple was superior to that of I−/I3− redox couple for thin-film DSCs sensitized with M16. Our results strongly indicate that the application of truxene-based organic dyes as photosensitizers in DSCs employing cobalt electrolyte is promising.
