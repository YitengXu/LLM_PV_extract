1. Introduction
One-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials, such as wires, rods, ribbons and tubes, have received significant interest for wide-ranging industrial, biomedical, energy storage and electronic applications due to their various fascinating and novel properties.1–8 Among them, 1D p–n heterojunctions, the assembly system made of p-type and n-type semiconductors, are of great importance in modern electronics and optoelectronics because they not only provide us with a good platform for fundamental charge transport and photoelectrical conversion research but also are the basic building blocks for sophisticated integrated optoelectronic circuits.9–15 Moreover, importantly, structures containing two or more functional materials and unique heterojunction interfaces potentially could lead to new or novel enhanced properties and useful multi-functionality. Fig. 1 briefly demonstrates the typical structures of these 1D p–n nanomaterials reported so far, including cross-stacked, bilayer, multi-segmented, core–shell and branched structures. Until now, 1D p–n heterojunctions of inorganic materials have received extensive research interest and have demonstrated excellent performance in various optoelectronic devices.10,15,16 Compared to inorganic materials, organic semiconductors including small organic molecules and polymers exhibit many unique properties, such as lightweight, low cost, easy processing with low energy consumption, and abundant material resources by molecular design and synthesis.17–20 Therefore, recently, enormous efforts have also been made in synthesizing and preparing 1D organic p–n heterojunctions in order to advance their application in the next generation organic microelectronics and photonics. However, the traditional methods of oxidation, diffusion of dopants, and ion implantation for inorganic heterojunctions21–23 are generally inapplicable to organic semiconductors because of the fragile properties of organic materials. Therefore, several new techniques, such as templating,24 vapor-phase synthesis,11 and solution method,25 have been developed to synthesize or fabricate organic p–n heterojunctions to meet the requirements of different device applications. Additionally, the utility of weak noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions and π–π stacking in organic semiconductors could open another unique way to grow high-quality organic nanoscale p–n heterojunctions through the multistep “bottom-up” self-assembly process.26 Through considerable efforts, significant advances have been made and a timeline of breakthroughs in 1D organic p–n heterojunctions is simply depicted as shown in Fig. 2. The thus achieved organic p–n heterojunctions have already been employed in new organic optoelectronic applications as well as in the fundamental research science,11,14,27 though there is still a long way to truly realize the controllable preparation of desired organic heterojunctions, especially in large area and mass production.12,28 The aim of this MiniRev is to highlight the remarkable progress in the research field of 1D organic p–n heterojunctions including pure organic–organic components and organic–inorganic hybrid components, with an emphasis on their synthesis and preparation methods, properties and device applications. By analyzing these results, the challenges and opportunities of 1D organic p–n heterojunctions are also deeply discussed finally.

2. Synthesis and preparation of 1D organic p–n heterojunctions
Understanding the controllable growth and assembly of organic molecules is an important issue to construct well-defined 1D organic p–n heterojunctions with uniform sizes and desirable structures (as mentioned in Fig. 1). Basically speaking, the two components used for fabricating p–n heterojunctions should first satisfy some interfacial matching parameters such as strong attractive interactions (e.g., π–π stacking or other intermolecular interactions) and similar lattice constants (for epitaxial growth).29–31 Additionally, to achieve functional materials for optoelectronic device applications, the two components used should also be matched in energy levels for efficient charge transport/photoelectrical conversion.32 With these guidelines in mind, various 1D organic p–n heterojunctions have been successfully prepared. According to the types of material systems used for 1D organic p–n heterojunctions, we can simply divide them into pure organic semiconductors and organic–inorganic hybrid p–n heterojunctions. In comparison, the latter type is more easily constructed and investigated. In the following, we will discuss them separately. The molecular structures of small organic molecules and polymeric materials discussed in this review are also demonstrated in Scheme 1.

2.1 Organic–organic p–n heterojunctions
The ideal organic heterojunctions are pure organic–organic single-crystalline p–n junctions with different structures like that of inorganic material systems (as shown in Fig. 1) to probe the charge transfer property at the p–n interfaces of organic materials and realize the fabrication of organic optoelectronic devices and circuits. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize pure organic–organic heterojunctions, especially the single-crystalline p–n heterojunctions because of the rare material systems with well-matched crystal lattice through the epitaxial growth process by the physical vapour transport (PVT) or organic molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) techniques, and the difficulty of finding orthogonal solvents for growing the organic p and n components step-by-step through the solution process.
A breakthrough in this field was made by Zhang et al. in 2010.11 The authors for the first time synthesized single crystalline bilayer p–n heterojunctions (Fig. 1, II) based on hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F16CuPc, n-type) and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc, p-type) through the PVT method. In a two-zone tube furnace, the previously as-grown CuPc single crystal nanowires on a SiO2 substrate were used as the template for the selective crystallization of F16CuPc on top (Fig. 3a). Because of the good crystal lattice match between the (001) faces of CuPc and F16CuPc, high quality well-defined p–n interface junctions, on a molecular scale, were achieved, which was confirmed by the diffraction patterns of heterojunctions uniaxially commensurate (i.e., the two lattices share exactly one lattice vector), providing an ideal system for understanding the fundamental charge-transport and photovoltaic behaviors at nanoscale organic–organic interfaces. Subsequently, Cui et al. synthesized the core–shell structured organic–organic single-crystalline heterojunctions (Fig. 1, IV) based on p-type CuPc and n-type 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-porphyrin (H2TPyP) (Fig. 3b) also through the PVT technique but with a one-step growth process.33 In a horizontal tube furnace, the boat with H2TPyP was placed at the center of the tube and the other one with CuPc was laid on the upstream side while the Si(100) substrates were placed on the downstream side of the flowing argon to collect the products.

After heating the central boat at a certain temperature of 460 °C, H2TPyP and CuPc were co-evaporated at a higher evaporation rate when H2TPyP first deposited on the substrate, which could act as the nucleation center for the growth of subsequently deposited CuPc. Finally, single-crystalline core–shell structured heterojunctions with p-type CuPc nanowires partly wrapped by n-type H2TPyP compounds formed due to the strong π–π connection between the two conjugated compounds. Furthermore, Sassella et al. investigated the growth of crystalline nanopatterned organic p–n heterostructures through the MBE technique, with rubrene and α-quaterthiophene (4T) as the research examples.34 Based on the two systems, the authors discovered a new growth mechanism of organic droplet epitaxy and indicated the importance of selecting a suitable substrate for growing and showed how to transfer the complete nanopatterned heterojunctions on technological substrates for optoelectronic device applications. Zheng et al. reported a two-step synthesis of organic nanowire heterojunctions composed of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) (Alq3) trunks and 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (DAAQ) branches (Fig. 3c). The preformed Alq3 microwires, made by self-assembly in the liquid phase, were used as nucleation centers for the site-specific secondary epitaxial vapor growth of DAAQ branches to give dendritic heterostructures (Fig. 1, V) with optical channelling properties.35
In comparison with PVT and MBE methods that usually need high temperature, high cost, atmosphere control (ultra-high vacuum or inert gas) and long time, the solution process is a more convenient approach with low cost. However, it has been a big challenging for selecting orthogonal solvents to avoid the disturbances of p-type and n-type organic semiconductors in the solvent environment for a step-by-step growth process are the big challenges for growing p–n organic heterojunctions from solution. In 2012, Li et al. developed a droplet pinned crystallization (DPC) method,36 which has been proved effective for the growth of high quality single crystals of organic semiconductors from solution. Recently, they further extended this DPC method to prepare p–n organic heterojunctions.25 A mixed solution of 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) (p-type) and C60 (n-type) was used in the DPC process (Fig. 3d). Similar to the crystallization from solution with one component, aligned ribbon-like crystals from the mixed solutions could also be obtained with a bilayer heterostructure of C60 crystals at the bottom partly overlapped by C8-BTBT crystals on the top. One advantage of the DPC process for growing p–n heterojunctions is that it doesn't need the choice of orthogonal solvents for p-type and n-type organic semiconductors, separately. Of course, meanwhile, two important requirements should be satisfied for growing the crystalline p–n junctions from a mixed solution, which are (i) different growth rates for p- and n-type organic components and (ii) the heterogeneous nucleation of later formed molecules on the former crystals. Similarly, by selecting another appropriate p-type organic semiconductor of 3,6-bis(5-(4-n-butylphenyl)thiophene-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP-PR) to combine with C60, they further synthesized single-crystalline DPP-PR-C60 donor–acceptor heterojunctions through the DPC solution process.37 Lately, Zhang et al. prepared organic core–shell heterojunction microwires via a solution-processed method by self-assembly of p-type materials of 3,7-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)dithieno[2,3-b:2′,3′-e]pyrazine (BEHT-DTP) on the surface of n-type cores of N,N′-(3,7-didecyl-2,6-bis(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-4,8-diylidene)dicyanamide (TDCNQI) driven by hydrophobic interactions of the long alkyl chains.38 Besides these advances, large-area cross-stacked single-crystal organic nanowire p–n heterojunction arrays (Fig. 1, I) made of the p-type 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-PEN) semiconductor on top of the n-type C60 (Fig. 3e) have also been achieved by Park et al. through a direct nanotransfer printing technique, suggesting its potential application in a desired arrangement for future nanoscale electronics.12
Compared to small organic molecules, polymeric semiconductors exhibit high molecular weight, complex intermolecular interactions and easy entanglement of the chains, which make them very difficult to prepare crystalline structures of polymers,39 not to mention the pure 1D crystalline p–n polymeric heterojunctions that can only be synthesized through the solution process. Among these methods, electrospinning is a very versatile and attractive technique for the fabrication of polymer fibers with one component and/or two blend components, which demonstrate potential applications in stretchable devices based on their large-area aligned nanofiber arrays.6,8,28 For example, Lin et al. fabricated aligned electrospun nanofibers from P3HT–graphene composites as a nanoscale channel for organic field effect transistors, which demonstrated superior performance in FET devices compared with the use of pristine P3HT or thin films.7 Yang et al. fabricated 1D core–shell structured nanofibers using n-type small organic Alq3 as the core and p-type poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) as the shell by the coaxial electrospinning technique.40 More recently, Zhang et al. also combined 1D small-molecule crystalline microwires with semiconductive polymers to form all-organic 1D core–shell heterojunctions using Alq3 as the core and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the shell in one-step by using an antisolvent diffusion method combined with the solvent-evaporation-induced self-assembly according to their different crystallization ability.41 It is a pity that until now there has been no report regarding polymer–polymer 1D crystalline p–n heterojunctions in the literature, which is also a challenging task in this field.
2.2 Organic/polymer–inorganic p–n heterojunctions
Compared with organic–organic heterojunctions, the preparation of organic/polymer–inorganic p–n heterojunctions is more convenient because inorganic nanostructures as one of their components are easier to prepare and are quite stable (Fig. 4). The template-assisted methods (TAMs) are routinely used to produce 1D organic–inorganic nanostructures with controlled dimensions and morphology by adjusting the pore dimensions of the templates.42–47 Alumina (AAO) and ion-track-etched membranes of polycarbonate or polyester are the widely used templates. The electrochemical process is a widely used method for depositing the materials of inorganic and organic/polymer materials into the pores of templates.4,5,47 One limitation with the electrodeposition method is that the materials to be deposited should be conductive and easily reduced. Other methods such as electroless deposition, sol–gel deposition, or layer-by-layer deposition have also been used to deposit inorganic materials and organic materials.42,48,49 1D p-n heterojunctions have been successfully synthesized by using a sequential combination of these techniques in TAMs. Non-template methods (NTMs) have also been used for the fabrication of 1D heterojunction hybrid micro/nanostructures, mainly for the core–shell structures. CdS, CdSe, TiO2, MnO2 and ZnO are often used as the n-type inorganic semiconductor materials, and polymers possessing delocalized ∂-electrons and an “intrinsic” wide band gap are usually used as p-type organic candidates.

(Note: here the yellow and green respectively represent inorganic and organic components.) 

2.2.1 Template-assisted methods (TAMs). 
In 2001, Kovtyukhova et al.50 fabricated multi-segmented structures and core–shell nanostructures through the TAMs combining a simple layer-by-layer assembly process. However, because the polymer nanoparticles were directly chemisorbed onto the metal/inorganic substrates, the quality and dispersion of polymer nanoparticles at the interface were relatively low. The Mirkin group have demonstrated the systematic synthesis of rod like structures composed of metals, inorganic semiconductors, and conducting polymers via in situ electrochemical deposition since the 1990s;43,51,52 however, actually it was only in 2004 that Park et al. for the first time utilized this method to fabricate organic–inorganic p–n heterojunctions,24 such as the four-segment nanorods (Au–PPY–Cd–Au) (Fig. 5a) prepared via electrochemical deposition of gold into alumina templates, followed by electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole, and deposition of Cd on top of the polymer block. Through this method, the length of each block could be well controlled by monitoring the charge passed during the electrodeposition process.53 Guo et al. further used this electrochemical deposition method to prepare a series of polymer p–n heterojunction nanostructures, for example, the segmented CdS–PPY27 nanorods and the core–shell/segmented polythiophene (PTh)–CdS54 nanorods (Fig. 5b and c); the two different structures of PTh–CdS nanorods can be prepared using the same method only by simply controlling the current density of CdS deposition. A modified TAM was further developed to prepare polymer–inorganic/metal core–shell p–n heterojunctions where the inorganic materials were directly deposited on the contracted polymer nanostructures that were pre-electropolymerized in the AAO templates under vacuum or with solvent evaporation,55–58 such as the P3HT/CdSe heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 5d.57 The viability of this method was further confirmed by the Mirkin group.59 Lee and co-workers60 further fabricated the MnO2/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coaxial nanowires by a simple one-step co-electrodeposition process based on the AAO template. The growth mechanism of coaxial nanowires could be explained as follows. The ring-shaped Au electrodes sputtered at the bottom of the pores can direct the growth of PEDOT nanotubes at low overpotential, which could result in the preferential formation of the PEDOT shell. The phase segregation of MnO2 and PEDOT forced the MnO2 to grow in the spaces left by the PEDOT shells as the cores. Sharma and co-workers61 synthesized PANI–ZnO 1D coaxial nanowires based on a track-etched porous polycarbonate membrane as the template one side of which was made conductive by metal for the subsequent electrodeposition. The monomer aniline was first deposited and polymerized to the PANI polymer on the pore walls that was followed by ZnO deposition in the core to finish the resulting core–shell heterojunctions, which demonstrated certain single-crystalline properties characterized by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. Wang and Li et al.62,63 directly utilized the highly oriented nanoporous TiO2 nanotube arrays pre-prepared as the building block to fabricate the coaxial TiO2-conducting polymer p–n heterojunctions in which the target polymer monomer materials were electrochemically polymerized in the TiO2 nanotubes. Additionally, the Fu group64 obtained a large quantity of ZnS–PPY core–shell heterojunctions through a developed method by combining metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) with in situ electrochemical deposition based on the AAO templates.

2.2.2 Non-template methods (NTMs). 
The NTMs have also been used to prepare organic–inorganic heterojunctions. For example, Briseno et al.65 produced p–n core–shell polymer–inorganic nanowires by chemically grafting the end-functionalized p-type oligo- and polythiophenes of P3HT and didodecylquaterthiophene (QT) to the n-type ZnO nanowires (Fig. 5e). The resulting thickness of the polymer shell was generally in the range of 5–20 nm. The ZnO nanowires could be prepared via solution or vapour-phase synthesis as previously reported.66,67 Later, other systems of core–shell heterostructures were also prepared through the NTMs.68,69 However, because of the low degree of functionality at the polymer chain-end, the efficiency of attachment of the polymer on the inorganic surface is relatively low. To increase the efficiency of attachment of the polymer, Redeker and co-workers70 utilized side-functionalized regioregular P3HT and poly(3-(5-carboxylpentyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3CPenT) to covalently graft polymers onto ZnO nanowires. These core–shell nanostructures exhibited an elongated conjugation length of polymer backbones that were confined on nanowire surfaces, demonstrating potential fast charge transfer across the interface.

3. Device applications of 1D organic p–n heterojunctions
The achievement of various 1D organic heterojunctions guarantees the investigation of their application in different devices, including optoelectronics, photonics and electronics (Fig. 6). To some extent, the optoelectronic property is significantly dependent on the heterojunction structures due to their different effective heterojunction area, which thus determines their application fields. For example, 1D cross-stacked (Fig. 1, I) and multi-segmented (Fig. 1, III) p–n heterojunctions assembled from nanowires show excellent rectification and light-emitting behaviour.13,15 1D bilayer (Fig. 1, II) and core–shell (Fig. 1, IV) p–n heterojunctions are often used to fabricate single nanowire solar cell devices.10,11,16 In the following, we will give a detailed demonstration of these device applications, separately.

3.1 Ambipolar transistors
One typical device application based on heterojunctions is the transistors, particularly the ambipolar transistors, which are the basic components in the organic logic compensation circuits.71,72 Zhang et al.11 first fabricated single crystalline micro/nano ambipolar organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on the p–n heterojunction nanoribbons of CuPc and F16CuPc through a “stamping electrode” technique. The transistors based on CuPc–F16CuPc heterojunctions exhibited a typical “V-shape” characteristic, wherein one arm was for electron transport and the other was for hole transport, confirming the ambipolar behavior of the transistors. Due to the high quality of CuPc–F16CuPc heterojunctions, excellent ambipolar transport performance was observed in OFETs with balanced carrier mobilities of 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and holes, respectively (Fig. 7). Subsequently, Fan et al.25 constructed another type of ambipolar OFETs based on the solution-processed p–n junctions of C8-BTBT and C60, and a high carrier mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons was achieved by optimizing the fabrication process and increasing the junction crystal quality.

3.2 Diodes and light-controlled diodes (photodetectors)
1D one-dimensional organic p–n heterojunctions can also be used as an important unit in diodes and the related light-controlled diodes (that is, photodetectors) because of their unidirectional conductivity or rectifying property. For example, the Mirkin group24 used a single Au–PPY–Cd–Au nanorod to construct a device, which exhibited typical “diode” behaviour at room temperature (as shown in Fig. 8a). Holes move from the PPY block to the Cd block during the forward bias, and in the reverse bias, current does not flow until the bias overcomes the breakdown potential (−0.61 V). In the forward bias, there is a positive voltage on the Au block adjacent to the PPY and a negative potential on the Au block interfaced with the Cd block. The I–V characteristics of the Au–PPY–Cd–Au nanorods at room temperature showed a rectifying ratio (i.e., forward bias current/reverse bias current) of ∼200 at ±0.6 V. The Li group27 reported light-controlled diodes based on the individual organic–inorganic hybrid CdS–PPY nanowires, which demonstrated an obvious increase of conductivity under the evaluated illumination intensity. Later, the same group73 constructed another type of diodes based on a newly synthesized heterojunction of poly[1,4-bis(pyrrol-2-yl)benzene] (PBPB) and an inorganic material (CdS) with the highest rectification ratio increased from 29.9 to 129.7 compared with that based on CdS–PPY nanowires. Recently, the Liu group74 developed a special structure with novel axial nested p–n heterojunction nanowires based on the inorganic semiconductor PbS and the conjugated polymer PPY, which also demonstrated a high rectifying ratio of 100 at 15 V in the diodes, much higher than that in the planar heterojunction devices. The Yao group fabricated the pure organic light-controlled diode based on the single CuPc–H2TPyP nanowire.33 The devices based on the cross-stacked single-crystal TIPS–PEN/C60 nanowires were also used in the diodes with a rectifying on/off ratio of ∼13 and photodiodes with the photogain of ∼2 under a light intensity of 12.2 mW cm−2.12 Based on the highly photosensitive properties of 1D organic–inorganic heterojunctions, Lin et al.75 fabricated a blue light photodetector with the PANI–CdS heterojunction nanowire arrays as the active component (Fig. 8b). The device showed high sensitive dependence of device performance on the wavelength of light with the highest conducting values under 420 nm wavelength light, much higher than that for the other wavelengths of light. Moreover, with the light illumination on and off, the rectification ratio of the PANI–CdS heterojunction nanowire array device could respond quickly at “high” and “low” states with an “ON/OFF” ratio of about 11.6, suggesting its potential applications in photoswitches (Fig. 8d).

3.3 Photovoltaic devices

3.3.1 Bulk heterojunction solar cell devices. 
The performance of bulk heterojunction solar cells depends strongly on the nanoscale morphology of the active layer. 1D core–shell structures of organic–inorganic p–n heterojunctions have an increased interfacial contact between the two constituents and continuous pathways provided by the long axis of anisotropic nanocrystals, enabling their potential application for improving power conversion efficiency. In order to realize the nanoscale controlled morphology in bulk heterojunction solar cells, Mawyin et al.68 used core–shell nanorods as photoactive material, which gave bulk heterojunctions with large donor–acceptor interfaces. The corresponding solar cells revealed efficient interpenetrated networks which led to an external quantum efficiency of 20% at the absorption maximum λmax = 498 nm. Although the donor domains of these hybrid bulk heterojunctions are constituted by self-assembled monolayers, transient absorption spectroscopy gives direct evidence of long-lived photoinduced charge carrier generation of significant intensity in these systems. Thus the described hybrid heterojunction nanorods represent a promising strategy toward nanoscale controlled bulk heterojunction solar cells. Zhao et al.69 directly grafted the vinyl-terminated P3HT onto bromobenzylphosphonic acid (BBPA)-functionalized CdSe quantum rods (QRs) (i.e., BBPA-CdSe QRs) by Heck coupling, yielding P3HT–CdSe QR nanocomposites, and solid-state emission spectra of nanocomposites showed the charge transfer from P3HT to CdSe.


3.3.2 A single nanowire solar cell device. 
It has been demonstrated that a single nanowire solar cell device is not only useful for fundamental understanding of the mechanism of large-area nanowire-array-based and bulk heterojunction solar cells, but it also provides a new nanoscale test bed to accomplish nanoscale optical electrical integration.76 Yang and co-workers65 fabricated individual organic–inorganic hybrid nanowire solar cells by grafting the end-functionalized oligo- and polythiophenes onto ZnO nanowires to produce p–n heterojunction nanowires. These hybrid p–n heterojunction P3HT–ZnO nanowire solar cell devices exhibited ideal characteristics with efficiencies (η) as high as 0.036%, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 0.32 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.4 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.28 under the solar spectrum (AM1.5) illumination with 100 mW cm−2 light intensity (Fig. 9a and b). These results are consistent with literature values of P3HT–ZnO bulk nanowire solar cells.77 At the same time, Zhang et al. reported the first micro-scale photovoltaic devices based on the pure organic p–n heterojunction nanowires of F16CuPc and CuPc, with Au as the anode electrode and Al as the cathode electrode (Fig. 9c). The CuPc–F16CuPc nanoribbon device yielded a JSC of ∼0.054 mA cm−2, a VOC of ∼0.35 V, a FF of ∼0.36, and an η of ∼0.007% under 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 9d). Currently, various single nanowire solar cell devices based on different structures of p–n heterojunctions have been reported,11,37,78–80 with the hope of further increasing the efficiency of these devices in comparison to the conventional photovoltaics.81,82

4. Conclusions: opportunities and challenges
In this MiniRev, recent advances in the study of synthesis and device applications of 1D organic p–n heterojunctions have been demonstrated. The 1D p–n heterojunctions mentioned here contain a combination of metallic, inorganic semiconducting and organic components, which endows them with unique physical and chemical properties. As a result, a variety of device applications with obviously enhanced device performance for these 1D organic heterojunctions have been developed in several areas, such as optoelectronics, photonics, and electronics, and other related potential applications.
Although great attention has been centered on the improvement of 1D organic heterojunctions by the utilization of newly developed functional materials and optimization of synthesis and preparation methods, many challenges still lie ahead before implementation of the 1D organic p–n heterojunctions in high-performance devices and sophisticated integrated circuits. The overall quality of 1D organic heterojunctions, i.e., crystallinity and the controllable structure, needs to be further increased. In addition, the present studies on pure organic 1D heterojunctions are mainly focused on small organic molecular systems. There is no report on pure polymeric heterojunctions which significantly hinders the development of micro/nano polymeric optoelectronic devices. And the poor regularity and low crystallinity of 1D polymeric–inorganic heterojunctions, especially for the polymeric regions are unfavorable for efficient charge transport and the construction of high performance optoelectronic devices, which are also needed to be further increased.
