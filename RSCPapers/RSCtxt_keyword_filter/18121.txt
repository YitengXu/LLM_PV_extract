    , Accepted 19th November 2021First published on 30th November 2021AbstractIn the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have developed rapidly and are now marching towards the stage of commercialization. In the process of developing perovskite solar cells, researchers have explored various schemes to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells, which include ion engineering, additive engineering, passivation engineering, interface layer engineering, packaging engineering, etc. While improving efficiency, these methods also enhance the long-term stability of the device, including thermal, humidity, and UV-light stability, etc. Among them, atomic layer deposition technology is a powerful tool for preparing dense and defect-free films with Å level thickness at a low temperature. It also has high conformality and repeatability and plays a vital role in the stability of the perovskite device. Nowadays, more and more researchers use atomic layer deposition technology to prepare high-quality thin films to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. This paper summarizes the typical cases of using atomic layer deposition technology to prepare the charge transport layer, passivation layer, buffer layer and encapsulation layer to improve the device conversion efficiency, humidity stability and thermal stability reported in recent years. It also discusses the research direction and existing challenges of atomic layer deposition technology in the future development of perovskite devices.
1. Introduction
With the increasingly severe problem of energy shortage and environmental pollution in the world, photovoltaic technology has become one of the most important potential solutions, in which the research and development of high-efficiency solar cells have attracted unprecedented attention.1–4 Among various types of solar cell materials, perovskite materials have the advantages of a high light absorption coefficient, a long carrier life and simple preparation.5–10 Since their first application in 2009,11 the photoelectric conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% to 25.5%.12–14
The factors affecting the stability of perovskite solar cells mainly include the following two: external stability factors and intrinsic stability factors.15 External stability factors include water, oxygen, heat and ultraviolet light, which can be solved by device encapsulation in general. Intrinsic stability factors include ion migration, light and electric field, which need to rely on the improvement of the performance of the device itself to prevent its influence.16–22 External and intrinsic stability factors are a challenge to improve the long-term stability of the device. To enhance the stability and realize the practical commercialization of perovskite solar cells, the optimization of the absorbing layer, high-quality charge transport layer, barrier layer and encapsulation layer is also a top priority.23
The performance of perovskite solar cells is directly influenced by the film quality of its functional layer.24 Traditional film preparation methods are generally divided into chemical methods and physical methods. The most commonly used method in the laboratory is the solution–gel method, which belongs to the chemical methods.25–29 Firstly, the solution is dropped onto the substrate, and then the rotary coater is rotated at a high speed to obtain a uniform thickness of the film. This method is simple to operate, and the film thickness can be controlled by substrate rotation speed, acceleration and time. However, it will be affected by the surrounding environment, so the repeatability of the experiment is poor.30 In addition, the spraying method is also commonly used to prepare NiO and TiO2. Compared with the solution method, it can control the thickness of the film by spraying time and flow rate, but usually there will be problems of film uniformity.31 This will seriously affect the performance of the device.32–34 To prepare functional layers of perovskite solar cells, it is necessary to prepare thin films with controllable thickness and high surface uniformity. As a result, deposition becomes a better choice, and physical and chemical vapor deposition are gradually used. Physical vapor deposition is a process of nucleation and growth of the source material through evaporation and solidification under vacuum.35–37 It has a fast deposition rate and a low deposition temperature and there is no introduction of impurities, but the step coverage of the thin film is general. The thickness of the thin film is adjusted by controlling the deposition time.38 Chemical vapor deposition is a process of nucleation and growth through vapor reaction. Its deposition rate is fast, and the step coverage of the film is better. Still, the deposition temperature is high, and impurities are easily introduced in the deposition process.39 The film thickness is controlled by deposition time and vapor partial pressure.40–42
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film preparation technology based on the chemical reaction between the vapor precursor and bottom surface group.43–46 It is a repeated self-limiting reaction that plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability of perovskite films and devices.
The principle and reaction process of ALD are shown in Fig. 1. There are four main steps in the ALD preparation process, including precursor pulse, purge, oxidant pulse and purge again. First, the precursor enters the cavity through pulse and reacts with the substrate surface group to generate semi-reaction products and gaseous by-products. Second, inert gas is injected into the chamber to purge excess precursor A and its reaction by-products out of the chamber. Third, oxidizing precursor B is introduced into the cavity to generate the target product by a self-limiting reaction with the substrate surface. Finally, inert gas was injected again to purge the reaction by-product and excess precursor B out of the cavity.

A layer of the target reactant is obtained after each cycle reaction, and the film grown layer by layer is dense and without a pinhole. By controlling the cycle number of self-limiting reactions between the two precursors and the substrate surface groups, the film growth thickness can be accurately controlled at the Å level.47–49 Furthermore, a third precursor can also be introduced in the deposition process, which can be the doping element to change the chemical properties of the target products.50 At the same time, a chemical bond connection between the atomic deposition product and the substrate, which has a higher binding force compared to the physical adsorption by van der Waals force connection, more suitable for the preparation of ultra-thin films, and has the characteristics of conformal growth in the deposition process, can grow evenly on the substrate with a high aspect ratio.51,52 This is because of the characteristic of the self-limiting reaction that the deposition rate is slow and the deposition time is long, and the vacuum required for the reaction increases the cost of the process. In addition to these drawbacks, the other advantages of ALD are unmatched by physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition.
Because ALD technology has the potential to prepare commercial low-temperature and large-area thin films, it has been used in microelectronics, semiconductors and optoelectronic devices, including crystalline silicon solar cells, copper indium gallium selenide thin-film solar cells, organic optoelectronic devices and so on.53 In the field of perovskite solar cells, ultra-thin, compact and defect-free film materials can be prepared by ALD technology, which can act as different functional layers in perovskite solar cells (as shown in Fig. 1e).54 When used as a charge transport layer, it can improve the efficiency of charge transport, and thus the stability of the device is significantly improved.55–57 As a passivation layer, it can optimize the energy level arrangement of the device, passivate the defects of the film and improve the long-term stability of the device.58–60 As a buffer layer, it can act as a dense water barrier to prevent the device from being eroded by external water and oxygen, and improve the long-term stability of the device.61–63 When acting as an external film encapsulation layer, it provides an intact barrier to prevent the device from being damaged by the external environment.64–66 It can be seen that atomic layer deposition technology has significant advantages in the perovskite field.
In recent years, ALD technology has been applied in the preparation of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. In addition to the deposition of functional layers, ALD also plays a vital role in the deposition of the buffer layer and encapsulation layer to further strengthen the stability of perovskite devices. This review will summarize these successful development cases and the application prospects of ALD technology in perovskite solar cells.
2. ALD-grown charge transfer layers
The preparation of a perovskite device with excellent performance requires a high-performance and high-quality perovskite absorption layer, excellent cell interface characteristics and a high-quality charge transport layer.67 For planar perovskite solar cells, the charge transport layer plays a vital role in charge separation, transmission and reducing charge recombination at the interface.68–70 A compact and defect-free charge transport layer with excellent charge transport capability is very important for the performance of perovskite solar cells, which can be achieved via ALD. At present, there are many labs preparing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with efficiencies higher than 20% achieved through atomic deposition of the charge transport layer (Table 1).71

2.1. ALD optimization of the electron transport layer (ETL)
Commonly, electron transport materials are mainly divided into two categories: metal-oxides and organic compounds. Among them, metal oxide electron transport materials generally have the advantages of adjustable bandgap, high transmittance and strong carrier transportability. They can be prepared by ALD, widely used in perovskite solar cells.72 At present, the typical metal-oxide electron transport materials that can be prepared by ALD technology mainly include TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 and so on. TiO2 can not only transport electrons, but also assist perovskite crystal growth as a mesoporous material.73,74 It is also a non-toxic and stable direct bandgap n-type semiconductor material.75 Therefore, it is the most typical and commonly used electron transport material in perovskite solar cells.
TiO2, as an electron transport material with a high electron transport rate, especially the double electron transport layer structure of c-TiO2/m-TiO2, has refreshed the efficiency record of perovskite solar cells many times. However, this c-TiO2 preparation method (spray method) cannot control the thickness of the film accurately, and the uniformity of the film cannot be guaranteed, so the stability of the device is affected to a certain extent. Therefore, it is a new idea to prepare a TiO2 thin film as a compact layer by using ALD. Tae et al.76 prepared an 11 nm ALD c-TiO2 film by depositing TDMATi and H2O precursors at 225 °C and annealing at 450 °C for 10 minutes. The microstructure of the c-TiO2 layer prepared by ALD was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (as shown in Fig. 2). No diffraction points represented crystalline properties in the electron diffraction pattern. The amorphous c-TiO2 prepared by ALD means that there are no defects caused by lattice mismatch, so the stability and efficiency of devices are improved, which is different from the c-TiO2 prepared by the spray method. Therefore, the long-term stability of the device can be improved.

ALD can accurately control the thickness of the electron transport layer and optimize the energy level arrangement according to the ETL thickness variation, leading to better electron transport and hole blocking. Chen et al.77 prepared a 10 nm thick TiO2 film as the electron transport layer through low-temperature ALD together with SnO2/PCBM prepared by the solution method (as shown in Fig. 3a). They found that the thickness of the ALD TiO2 ETL is conducive to optimizing the energy level configuration (as shown in Fig. 3b) and improving the surface morphology, crystal quality and light absorption capacity of the perovskite layer, which can directly affect the long-term stability of the device. Finally, the highest efficiency of the device from ALD is 19.45%, and the FF and Voc are significantly increased, while the device with an 18.64% efficiency in which the TiO2 layer was prepared by the solution method. The main reason is that ALD can optimize the device energy level arrangement, which will improve the carrier transmission speed and reduce the charge recombination at the thin film interface.

Compared with TiO2, SnO2 is also an electron transport material with excellent electron extraction ability and hole blocking ability. It has a wider bandgap, higher transmittance, more extensive electron mobility, a lower conduction band edge and higher stability. It is easier for electrons to flow in, and the devices with SnO2 often show a lower hysteresis coefficient. In addition, compared with TiO2, the preparation of SnO2 does not require high-temperature annealing, and the preparation temperature is lower. Because SnO2 is flatter than the TiO2 electron transport layer, its stability is also more prominent for the preparation of SnO2 by ALD, and an appropriate deposition temperature can improve the device performance. Kuang et al.78 used TDMASn and oxygen plasma to prepare the SnO2 electron transport layer at different substrate temperatures to explore the influence of different deposition temperatures on the device performance. The amorphous SnO2 electron transport layer was deposited at 50 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The J–V performance of the device (as shown in Fig. 4a) was better at 200 °C. The reason is that there is good contact between the SnO2 film deposited at 200 °C and the perovskite, and the electron transfer rate is fast. However, the SnO2 film deposited at 50 °C is too low to provide the activation energy of the precursor for the self-limiting reaction, resulting in too many defect states in the film. Through the optical stability test, it can be seen that, after 16 hours of AM1.5G illumination, the efficiency of SnO2 deposited at 50 °C has decreased by 50%, while the efficiency of the SnO2 thin film deposited at 200 °C displayed almost no changes.78 From this, we can see the importance of deposition temperature on film quality, which will directly affect the long-term stability of the devices.

In addition to the traditional oxide electron transport layer, the non-oxide ETL is also gradually developed. GaN is a direct bandgap semiconductor, which has similar photoelectric properties to SnO2 and TiO2. With stable chemical properties and high electron mobility, it is considered to be a very promising electron transport material.79 As shown in Fig. 5, Wei et al.80 introduced GaN into perovskite solar cells as an electron transport layer at 280 °C through ALD. By depositing GaN with different thicknesses, it was found that when the deposition cycle was 50 and the thickness was about 5 nm, the cell efficiency reached 15.18%, increased by nearly 5% compared with the control sample, and the hysteresis effect was significantly reduced. The device's long-term stability is greatly improved, which retains 92% of the original efficiency after 30 days under 65 °C and 30% humidity. The reason is that the addition of 5 nm ALD GaN better adapts the energy level arrangement of the device, promotes electron extraction and reduces the recombination of carriers. This achievement guides the direction for the preparation of non-oxide charge transport layers by ALD in the future.

2.2. ALD optimization of the hole transport layer (HTL)
The HTL in perovskite solar cells can accelerate the hole transport efficiency, block electrons and prevent direct contact corrosion between perovskite materials and electrodes. In the development of hole transport layers in recent years, some organic molecular materials and inorganic oxide materials have become common choices for perovskite solar cells.81 Among them, metal-oxides such as NiO, MoOx and VOx have developed rapidly in reverse perovskite solar cell devices due to their low price, simple process, high stability and easy preparation by ALD.
NiO, as a mature inorganic hole transport material, has high light transmittance and a wide direct bandgap (3.4–3.8 eV). It can form a good band arrangement with a variety of perovskites. Koushik et al.82 prepared polycrystalline cubic NiO films with a bandgap of 3.75 eV by ALD at 150 °C using Ni(MeCp)2 as the precursor and O2 plasma as the oxidation precursor. The 10 nm ALD NiO film has excellent compactness, which can be used as a very stable HTL to obtain efficient perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, they found that the Jsc and FF of the ALD NiO device were improved after annealing, the hole extraction effect at the NiO/perovskite interface was better, and the energy band arrangement was more ideal (Fig. 6). Therefore, a high-efficiency perovskite solar cell with a 17.07% efficiency has been achieved.82 We believe that the NiO HTL prepared by ALD can effectively extract holes and realize the rapid transfer of holes, optimize the quality of the film surface, which is very important for the preparation of efficient and stable devices, and provide a way for the preparation of commercial large-area perovskite solar cells in the future.

Chu et al.83 deposited ultra-thin (1 nm) VOx films by ALD as the HTL of perovskite solar cells at 50 °C, and the best efficiency of 11.53% was obtained. The test results show that, after UV post-treatment on the ALD VOx film, the interface between the VOx film and perovskite is conducive to the bending of the energy band and hole transmission. The new hole transport material prepared by ALD has the function of adjusting energy levels, and the stability of the device is greatly improved due to the inherent chemical properties of VOx. This study shows that inorganic VOx films prepared by ALD technology can be used as hole transport materials to obtain efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and have the potential to be used in flexible and large-area perovskite solar cells.
3. Stability enhancement of perovskite solar cells through the ALD passivation layer
The passivation layer in perovskite solar cells can achieve surface modification of thin films, energy level matching, and passivation of interface defects, promote carrier transport, reduce compound current, and improve the conversion efficiency of the cells. In addition, the introduction of the passivation layer can also serve as a sandwich between the two active layers to prevent the degradation caused by chemical reactions between the two materials from direct contact, which can enhance the service life of the perovskite film and significantly improve the long-term stability of the device.86–89 The passivation layer is usually thin and flat, usually only a few nanometers thick, so ALD technology can accurately control the film thickness and enhance the relative stability after passivation. Therefore, more and more researchers choose to use atomic deposition technology to develop and prepare passivation layers to ensure the improvement of device performance.90
In perovskite solar cells, the passivation layer can be divided into two types according to the role of the passivation layer.91 The first type requires the passivation material to be deposited directly on the perovskite layer to passivate the perovskite light-absorbing layer. The other is to passivate the charge transport layer.92 These two types of passivation layers can repair the defects of the underlying film, thus improving the service life of the film and device.
3.1. Passivation of perovskite layers by the ALD technique
In perovskite solar cells, there are a lot of defects in the perovskite film, which affect the charge recombination and ion migration process, thus affecting the stability and conversion efficiency of the device. Therefore, passivation treatment of film defects via the ALD technique is an effective way to prolong the life cycle of the film (Table 2).93

Al2O3, due to its wide bandgap, is often used as a passivation layer. However, due to the nature of insulation, the tunneling effect of the ultra-thin film is needed to take a charge in the normal interface transport, so ALD technology has become a common means of preparing passivation layers.94 In the passivation of the perovskite film surface by ALD, substrate inhibition often occurs during the initial deposition of ALD due to the lack of active sites for self-limiting reaction on the surface of the perovskite film and the characteristics of easy decomposition when heated.95 This will cause deposition difficulties, so it is necessary to choose a reasonable deposition temperature.
Zhao et al.93 revealed the mechanism of ALD Al2O3 passivation of the perovskite film in detail through a series of experiments. It can be seen by XRD that when the temperature is 125 °C, a characteristic peak representing PbI2 appears (Fig. 7a). At the same time, a large number of white PbI2 appear on the surface of the film, directly resulting in an increase in the roughness of the film, which also affects the carrier transport. Meanwhile, according to the initial growth mechanism of ALD, the growth mechanism of ALD Al2O3 at different temperatures on the surface of the MAPbI3 film can be obtained. When the deposition temperature is 75 °C, the growth rate of ALD slows down, and the growth of ALD selectively occurs at the surface defects of the film, which does not hinder the transport of carriers at the interface while passivating the interface defects (Fig. 7f). Therefore, the ALD Al2O3 layer can passivate the perovskite film to improve the carrier transmission efficiency and reduce perovskite decomposition to increase the long-term stability of the device.

Koushik et al.96 inserted an ultra-thin ALD Al2O3 layer (as shown in Fig. 8a) into the traditional n–i–p structure perovskite cell to reduce the hysteresis loss in order to make the device more stable under wet conditions. As shown in Fig. 8b, the ALD device without encapsulation still maintained 65% of the initial efficiency after 70 days. The efficiency of the original cell without the ALD Al2O3 layer decreased sharply to 12% of the initial value. Of course, in addition to ALD Al2O3, other oxide materials deposited as a passivation layer at the interface between the perovskite and hole transport layer also have great application potential.

Wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells have a relatively high output voltage, but their stability is relatively weak. Passivation on the perovskite layer is a means to improve the long-term stability of the device without damaging the perovskite and reducing the output voltage. Hu et al.97 used ALD ZrO2 to passivate the perovskite layer (as shown in Fig. 9a). The MoOx layer treated with a high power function electron beam was used to modify the anode interface, and the ultra-thin ZrO2 layer was prepared by ALD technology to passivate the perovskite. Due to the substantial advantages of ALD technology, the prepared ALD ZrO2 passivation layer did not damage the perovskite. It could match the level blocking holes, which inhibited the recombination of carriers and led to a higher open-circuit voltage of 1653 mV. Even more critical, the thin and dense ZrO2 prevents the internal perovskite layer from being eroded by external water and oxygen, thus significantly improving the long-term stability of the device. After three months of aging, the device can still maintain its original efficiency.

3.2. Passivation of charge transport layers
ALD passivation on the charge transfer layer can change the film surface morphology and chemical properties, adjust the energy level arrangement of the device, improve carrier transport efficiency, and improve the long-term stability of the device.98–101
Chavan et al.102 used Nb(OEt)5 and H2O as two precursors to deposit a 2.1 nm Nb2O5 film at 300 °C to passivate a mesoporous TiO2 (ms-TiO2) film by ALD (as shown in Fig. 10b). In addition, the surface modification of the ms-TiO2 film resulted in the change of energy level arrangement, which was more conducive to charge transfer between interfaces. The thermal stability, UV light stability and humidity stability of the device are improved. The stability of the optimized unencapsulated device increases by 10% compared with the original device after 700 h at room temperature with 50% humidity.102

Existing studies have shown that ZnO, as an electron transport layer, will decompose when directly contacting the methylamino perovskite absorbent layer, so a passivation strategy is needed to avoid the decomposition reaction between the two. Jin et al.103 prepared a ZnO electron transport layer by the sol–gel method and then deposited an ultra-thin TiO2 passivation layer by ALD technology, which effectively suppressed the decomposition of the ZnO/perovskite contact. The improvement of device performance is mainly attributed to the more stable ZnO/perovskite interface. With the increase of TiO2 layer thickness (deposition thickness x = 0 to 2.8 nm), the decomposition effect of the perovskite absorption layer gradually disappears. SEM results show (Fig. 11) that a high-quality perovskite layer is formed on the TiO2 buffer layer, whose morphology and surface roughness are significantly improved, and the contact between the perovskite layer and the cavity transport layer is smoother. The experimental results show that, due to the addition of the ALD TiO2 passivation layer, the decomposition reaction between the perovskite and ZnO electron transport layer is inhibited, the defects of the perovskite film are significantly reduced, and the charge extraction efficiency is high, and these led to the long-term stability of the device.104 Earlier research results show that deposition of a 0.4 nm Al2O3 passivation layer between ZnO and the perovskite layer could also avoid the decomposition reaction between ZnO and the perovskite.103 Therefore, it can be seen that the ALD passivation layer is beneficial to obtain more stable perovskite films and devices.

In addition to the deposition of oxide passivated layer by ALD, non-oxide passivated layers often have a more dense morphology and are gradually developed and utilized. Chavan et al.105 used ALD technology to deposit an ultra-thin (1.9 nm) TiN layer on the surface of the mp-TiO2 electron transport layer (Fig. 12a), and its simulation diagram is shown in Fig. 12a. After passivation by ALD TiN, the XRD images show similar peak patterns to the original film, indicating that TiN deposition did not damage the perovskite layer (Fig. 12b). After experimental characterization, the photovoltaic parameters of the devices passivated by ALD TiN are significantly enhanced. The reason is that, after the intervention of the ALD TiN layer, the dense film passivates the defects on the interface, so the devices have lower charge interface recombination, better charge transfer and more matched energy level arrangement (as shown in Fig. 12c). More notably, compared with the original devices, the hysteresis effect of the devices passivated by ultra-thin TiN almost disappears and their stability is greatly improved. After 500 h storage at room temperature and 40% RH, the passivated devices can maintain 80% of the original efficiency (Fig. 12d). Therefore, we believe that ALD passivation at the ETL/perovskite interface with broad band gap materials such as TiN can provide a new direction for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

4. Stability enhancement of perovskite solar cells through the ALD buffer layer
In perovskite solar cells, the buffer layer is generally located between the charge transfer layer and the electrode, which can be used to adjust the energy level between the electrode and the charge transfer layer to increase the charge transport efficiency.106 Generally, it is at the upper end of the device. Thus it can be used as a water vapor isolation layer to prevent external water and oxygen from entering the device to improve the long-term stability of the devices.107–110 Flexible control of buffer layer thickness can better adjust the device energy level arrangement, and a compact and defect-free film can prevent the invasion of water and oxygen. Hence, ALD technology is very suitable for the preparation of the buffer layer.110–112 However, since halide perovskites decompose quickly when exposed to higher temperatures or humidity, the process of ALD often requires substrate conditions greater than 100 °C, and the needed oxidizing precursor for deposition often uses H2O. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the setting of deposition temperature and selection of oxidizing precursors during buffer layer deposition.
As with the deposition of a passivation layer on the perovskite layer, the deposit of the buffer layer also encountered the absence of substrate reaction sites to produce substrate inhibition. Since there are few active sites for atomic deposition and nucleation on the organic surface of PCBM, Brinkmann et al.113 introduced ZnAlxOy (AZO) on the upper layer of PCBM, which provided sufficient active sites for the self-limiting reaction for subsequent atomic deposition of SnO2. Finally, they successfully prepared a double-layer electron extraction buffer layer composed of AZO and ALD SnOx (as shown in Fig. 13). The results show that SnOx grown by ALD forms a very dense gas permeation barrier, which effectively prevents water from entering the perovskite, and it also prevents the diffusion of perovskite decomposition products, which significantly inhibits the overall decomposition of the perovskite and endows the device with excellent stability.

Previous studies have found that Ga2O3, as a broad band gap semiconductor material, displays a solid hydrophobic capacity when combined with perovskite solar cells. It can play an essential role in inhibiting carrier recombination, reducing leakage current, improving interface contact and other aspects. Ma et al.114 deposited an inorganic Ga2O3 nanolayer as a buffer layer between the charge transfer layer and the electrode using ALD technology. As can be seen from the contact angle test results (as shown in Fig. 14a and b), the contact angle of the film containing ALD Ga2O3 was increased from 79.7° to 92.28°, and the hydrophobic performance of the film was greatly improved. Deionized water was directly dropped onto the film surface, and the original film was rapidly decomposed which could observed by the naked eye. Still, the film containing the ALD Ga2O3 buffer layer did not have any change. After the two samples were placed in the air for 10 days, from the SEM characterization results, it was found that the morphology of the film containing the buffer layer did not change, proving that the ALD Ga2O3 buffer layer of water vapor isolation performance is very excellent. The reason is that the Ga2O3 buffer layer can form a dense permeability barrier, effectively slow down the diffusion of water and metal ions, and prevent the corrosion of electrode materials. With ALD preparation of the Ga2O3 buffer layer to significantly improve the long-term stability of the device, the device can still maintain the original efficiency of 86% after 20 days under the condition of 40% environmental humidity.

At present, most of the hole transport materials of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells with an n–i–p structure are spiro-OMeTAD doped with Li salt. After doping, the transport speed of carriers can be improved, but Li+ has the disadvantages of hygroscopic and easy migration, which leads to the decomposition of perovskite films. Therefore, a buffer layer deposited between the hole transport layer and the electrode can directly isolate the contact between water vapor and Li+ in spiro-OMeTAD. Seo et al.115 deposited a-TiO2 on spiro-OMeTAD at 60 °C by using TDMATi and H2O as precursors. The a-TiO2 buffer layer of about 5 nm size directly blocked the direct contact between the outside environment and spiro-OMeTAD. It prevented the migration of Li+ in spiro-OMeTAD and the decomposition of perovskite materials in water. The device stability is greatly improved after the buffer layer is deposited. After aging at 70 °C for 80 h, the Jsc and FF of the device without the buffer layer decreased significantly, while the Jsc of the device with the buffer layer decreased slightly. After the two kinds of films were placed at 70 °C and 80% RH for 80 h, it could be seen intuitively from the SEM images that the samples without the buffer layer had apparent degradation. In contrast, the film surface with the buffer layer did not have apparent degradation. After aging for 100 h at 85% RH, the samples without the buffer layer have completely decomposed, and their surfaces have entirely discolored. However, the XRD results of the sample with the buffer layer show that the characteristic peak of the perovskite still exists without any degradation (Fig. 15). This indicates that a-TiO2 prepared by ALD is a compact and defect-free barrier, which can prevent the inside erosion of the device by the external environment and prolong its service life.

For the future commercial applications of perovskite solar cells, it is an auspicious development direction to combine them with silicon-based solar cells to form multiple series devices. The contact processing technology of double cells is not mature yet. James et al.116 developed a new type of contact material by taking advantage of the density of the thin film prepared by ALD. They deposited a 9 nm VOx buffer layer (Fig. 16a) using two precursors VTIP and H2O at a base temperature of 100 °C. The thin and dense VOx buffer layer can prevent the direct invasion of external water and oxygen. Moreover, it can protect the lower perovskite from damage when the upper ITO electrode is sputtered. In the stability test of the device, it can be seen that the degradation process is significantly slowed down by the buffer layer containing VOx, and the area of color degradation of the device is reduced considerably after 1000 hours in a N2 atmosphere at 85 °C (Fig. 16b). The device with a sputtering ITO electrode and an ALD VOx buffer layer shows a slight improvement in performance after 1000 hours of thermal aging. It can be seen from these results that the ALD VOx buffer layer is an effective barrier to prevent perovskite decomposition and diffusion, which can significantly improve the stability of the devices.

In conclusion, the ALD buffer layer in perovskite solar cells can improve the efficiency and prolong the long-term stability. Furthermore, the buffer layers prepared by ALD can play different roles simultaneously, except for optimizing the energy level arrangement of the devices, passivating the surface of the perovskite, and isolating from water vapor, which shows the power of the ALD technique for stable perovskite devices (Table 3).

5. Improvement of the long-term stability of perovskite devices via the ALD encapsulation layer
To realize long-term efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells, only a dense buffer layer is not enough. The encapsulation layer can directly prevent the direct erosion of the environment to the devices. It is the first line of defense to prevent the decay of devices by harsh external conditions.117–119 The encapsulation methods in the fields of organic optoelectronic devices and organic light-emitting diodes are relatively mature. Still, when they are applied to perovskite solar cells, due to the extreme sensitivity of metal halide perovskites to moisture in the air and the sensitivity of common hole transport materials to temperature,120 the packaging conditions of perovskite solar cells are more stringent.121–123 Therefore, when using ALD technology to encapsulate devices, the parameter setting during deposition is also essential.
Wincukiewicz et al.124 introduced about 50 nm ALD Al2O3 on a perovskite and studied the degradation kinetics of the perovskite with and without film encapsulation; the two samples were placed in the air with 65% humidity, and the degradation process of the perovskite was detected by XRD. It was found that, after 10 days, the characteristic peak of the perovskite in the unencapsulated sample had disappeared, and two characteristic peaks (∼13° and ∼39°) representing PbI2 were detected. The encapsulated sample had almost no changes (Fig. 17).

Lv et al.125 deposited ultra-thin TiO2 as a buffer layer between the electron transport layer and the electrode to prepare p–i–n perovskite solar cells. XPS characterization shows that (Fig. 18a–d) the dense and nonporous TiO2 layer can fill some defects in PCBM to improve the water vapor resistance of the perovskite light-absorbing layer. At the same time, TiO2 can also optimize the energy level arrangement, which is conducive to the separation of electrons and holes to reduce the interfacial charge recombination loss significantly. But its ability to resist water vapor is limited. Therefore, a 60 nm Al2O3 encapsulation layer has been deposited on the upper layer of the device through ALD. This composite device shows excellent stability compared with the unpackaged device. When the ambient temperature is 25 °C, and the ambient humidity is 40–60%, the stability of the device with only the TiO2 buffer layer is slightly improved compared with the original device. After 40 hours, the efficiency of the TiO2 device is reduced to 80% of the original efficiency. However, after ALD Al2O3 encapsulation, the device efficiency is reduced to 80% of the original value after 600 hours (Fig. 18e). The authors also placed the TiO2 buffer layer device and the ALD encapsulated device with a buffer layer in deionized water. After 1 minute, the color of the unpacked device turned yellow, indicating that CH3NH3PbI3 had been decomposed into PbI2 (Fig. 18f). Therefore, we believe that the Al2O3 film prepared by ALD technology as an encapsulation layer has the characteristics of high density, being pinhole-free, good continuity, chemical solid corrosion resistance, and water and oxygen penetration resistance, which can significantly improve the long-term stability of the devices.

The early thin film packing methods of organic light-emitting devices often use the structure of alternating organic/inorganic thin films. The inorganic barrier layer is usually an Al2O3 film,126 which is the core of the packaging layer to block external water vapor. However, the thickness of the inorganic layer is very thin. When there are defects in the film, the water vapor and oxygen molecules in the air will penetrate the device through the defects.127 Adding an organic layer can make up for the defects of the inorganic layer, increase the flexibility of the whole ALD encapsulation layer and make the surface of the ALD encapsulation layer more smooth.128
Lee et al.129 used an organic/inorganic multilayer encapsulation structure to prepare a pV3D3 organic film by initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD), deposited an Al2O3 film by ALD, and finally completed the encapsulation of perovskite solar cells (Fig. 19d). The first deposited 800 nm pV3D3 film on the upper end of the device by iCVD can be used as an organic layer to protect the device from the ALD process with water as the oxidation source and ensure the smooth growth of the ALD film. After debugging, it is found that when the organic/inorganic film packaging layer number is three (Fig. 19b), pV3D3 and Al2O3 are 250 nm and 21.5 nm, respectively. At this time, the water vapor transmittance (WVTR) of the device is low, and the delay time of water vapor transmission through the film is longer, which has little impact on the efficiency of the device. The existence of ALD Al2O3 can significantly improve the packaging effect of the encapsulation layer. In the long-term stability test, after 300 hours of exposure to the aging conditions of 50 °C and 50% humidity, the efficiency of the cell still remains at 97% of the original value (Fig. 19c), which proves that the pV3D3 and ALD Al2O3 multilayer packaging can effectively enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells.

Eun et al.130 also used an organic/inorganic structure to encapsulate n–i–p devices. A 55 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film was used as the organic layer and 30 nm ALD Al2O3 was adopted as the inorganic film. By studying the placement sequence of organic and inorganic layers, it is found that the deposition sequence of PDMS/AlOx has the best water vapor barrier rate. The WVTR reaches 5.1 × 10−3 g m−2 d−1, and the delay time of water vapor penetrating the film also reaches the highest value of 19.71 h (Table 4). In the stability test, under the conditions of 45–65% ambient humidity, the efficiency of PDMS/AlOx encapsulated solar cells is reduced by no more than 8% within 300 hours (Fig. 20). In contrast, the efficiency of the devices packaged with AlOx alone decreases by more than 15%. Therefore, ALD is a powerful tool for improving the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.

Due to the particularity of perovskites, their packaging method is found to be different from the traditional silicon-based cells. The packaging layer via ALD can be the first barrier of perovskite devices, which can reduce the damage caused by glass packaging and improve the long-term stability. The ALD packaging layer will be an indispensable step in the preparation of stable perovskite devices (Table 5).

6. ALD technology in the use of two-terminal perovskite silicon tandem solar cells
Two-terminal perovskite silicon tandem solar cells have the potential to surpass the efficiency limits of silicon-based solar cells. By stacking light absorbers with wide and narrow bandgaps in an orderly manner, the top cell absorbs high-energy photons and the bottom cell absorbs low-energy cells, thus making full use of energy. Such batteries are now more than 25% efficient.131 To achieve the purpose of stacking the two batteries, we need to prepare a contact layer between the interfaces using ALD. It also protects the underlying perovskite while providing a contact layer.132–134
Hatt et al.135 tried using an electrochemical method to deposit Cu electrodes in order to reduce the use of Ag (Fig. 21b). Therefore, a protective layer is required to protect the perovskite from damage. They prepared a 100 nm Al2O3 protective layer using ALD to avoid damage to the perovskite layer when using the electrochemical method to prepare the Cu electrode (Fig. 21a). The results showed that the Cu electrode formed an excellent contact between ITO and PSCs. Due to the protective effect of ALD Al2O3, the perovskite was not damaged during the preparation of the Cu electrode. This provides a new idea for the future development of two-terminal perovskite silicon tandem solar cells.

Hossain et al.136 used ALD technology to prepare the contact layer of two-terminal perovskite silicon tandem solar cells. They took advantage of ALD AZO's tunneling effect, which allows charge to be transported quickly between interfaces. The AZO film prepared through shape-preserving characteristic of ALD technology has very low roughness (Fig. 22b), which is good for the direct contact between the wide-band gap cell and narrow-band gap cell, and accelerate the charge transport between the interface. ALD AZO also acts as a barrier to prevent water and oxygen from entering the device which significantly improved the stability of the tandem device.

7. Conclusion and outlook
In conclusion, we review the frontier progress of functional layer preparation of perovskite solar cells by ALD and the stability that comes with it in recent years. In terms of charge transport layer deposition, atomic deposition technology can provide a dense, defect-free and controllable charge transport film for perovskite cells, which prolongs the service life of the charge transport films, significantly improves the transmission efficiency of carriers at the interface of the functional layer, makes the device have a more suitable energy level arrangement and enhances the overall stable performance of the device. The ALD buffer layer can not only make the perovskite solar cells have a better energy level arrangement, but also prevent water and oxygen from eroding the perovskite absorption layer and delaying the decomposition of the perovskite absorption layer when it is deposited on the upper layer of the perovskite film, to prolong the long-term stability of the device. The main function of the ALD packaging layer is to resist the erosion caused by environmental factors from the outside, which is beneficial to the long-term stability of the device.
Furthermore, in addition to various materials prepared by ALD technology, there are many suitable materials that can be applied to perovskite solar cells. For example, SiO2 can be used as a suitable ALD material and embedded in the perovskite structure as a buffer layer or packaging layer. Doping Zn, Mg and Si in Al2O3 materials by ALD technology can change the chemical properties of the material, which can also be used as an idea to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.
Perovskite/perovskite tandem solar cells have the potential to surpass the efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells. Through metal oxide atomic layer deposition, the hole and electron selective contact layer of the double cell can be prepared without damaging the perovskite and the energy of the two cells can be correlated. The development of new ALD materials is of great significance for the preparation of solar cells beyond the single efficiency limit in the future.
As one of the means to prepare high-quality ultra-thin films, the advantages of atomic deposition technology are obvious to all. However, in order to realize the commercial preparation of large-area films, the shortcomings of ALD are exposed. If the deposition temperature is too high when preparing the encapsulation layer or buffer layer, the perovskite light-absorbing layer will be damaged, which will affect the device efficiency. In addition, the deposition requires vacuum conditions, the deposition time is long, and there is a waste of precursors in the deposition process, resulting in a high deposition cost. Therefore, these problems need to be considered in the future research of ALD technology to make ALD stand out on the road to commercialization of perovskite solar cells.
