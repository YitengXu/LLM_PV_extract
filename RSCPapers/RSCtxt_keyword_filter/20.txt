    , Accepted 29th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractA ternary organic solar cell, consisting of two compatible non-fullerene acceptors and one wide band-gap donor, with a high efficiency of over 14% is reported, and the working mechanism of the bandgap structure modulation is studied. Based on that, we fabricate six-component OSCs by selecting one donor and five non-fullerene acceptors, exhibiting easily tuned current and voltage.
Introduction
As a promising clean-energy technology that converts solar energy into electricity, organic solar cells (OSCs) are suitable for low-cost solution processing methods and have some unique aspects, such as flexibility and light-weight.1–5 The active layers in OSCs, consisting of electron donors and acceptors, harvest solar photons while providing an efficient approach to separate the photo-generated organic excitons.6,7 Optimizing the active layers to make the best of sunlight is one of the key strategies to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs.8–11 However, as organic photovoltaic materials intrinsically have narrow absorption bands, the mostly used active layers based on one donor and one acceptor can hardly cover entirety of the sunlight spectrum for single-junction OSCs.12
To solve this issue, blending multiple components in active layers is easy and effective. Over the past decade, ternary solar cells, composed of one donor/two acceptors or two donors/one acceptor, have attracted much attention and achieved many significant results.13–16 In previous reports, fullerene derivatives like [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and indene-C60/C70 bisadduct (ICBA) are the dominant electron acceptors, which have weak absorption in the visible region.17 High-performance ternary solar cells usually have two donors and one fullerene acceptor.18,19 Bringing a third compound into the active layer will not only enhance the absorption but also optimize the blend morphology and improve the charge transport.20–23 As a result, the best-performing ternary solar cells based on fullerene acceptors achieved impressive PCEs of ∼11–12%, which are obviously superior to those of most of the binary OSCs.24,25
Non-fullerene electron acceptors have experienced rapid development in the past few years.26–28 Many highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors based on diimide (NDI),29 perylene diimide (PDI),30 or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT)31 as core structures were developed and applied in OSCs. At present, binary non-fullerene OSCs have achieved PCEs above 13%.32–35 Meanwhile, newly emerging high-performance non-fullerene acceptors offer a new opportunity for ternary solar cells because they have great tunability of absorption and molecular energy levels.36–38 If ternary solar cells are fabricated by selecting two small-molecule acceptors with similar chemical structures, compatible blend morphology and efficient charge transport can be easily obtained.39 By integrating the advantages of non-fullerene acceptors, Zhang et al. demonstrated a PCE of 13.7% in ternary OSCs.40 Based on these new developments, it is very important to further improve the PCEs of ternary OSCs and it is of great interest to investigate multi-component OSCs beyond the ternary.
In this contribution, we fabricated ternary solar cells based on a polymer donor PBDB-TF and two non-fullerene acceptors (IT-2F and IT-4F). A high PCE of 14% was recorded due to the balanced photovoltaic parameters of open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC). We also synthesized IT-3F by using the end-groups of IT-2F and IT-4F to make a comparison with the blend systems. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the chemical modification and physical ternary blending have almost the same role in modulating the absorption spectra and molecular energy levels for this kind of system. We then blended five non-fullerene acceptors with the polymer donor to fabricate six-component solar cells. By changing the blending ratios of the acceptors, the multi-component solar cells show very good PCEs with easily tuned VOCs and JSCs, suggesting that the blending of multiple components beyond the ternary is an efficient method to tune the light harvesting and energy level alignments in OSCs. The multiple blending may be a promising method for improving the photovoltaic performance of non-fullerene OSCs.
Results and discussion
The molecular structures of the non-fullerene acceptors are illustrated in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1a shows that it is very easy to obtain IT-2F and IT-4F via Knoevenagel condensation reactions between the core units and the end-groups (Scheme S1†). For the asymmetric acceptor IT-3F, there are two potential synthetic routes. As displayed in Fig. 1b, we first adopted route i but obtained the product at a very low yield of about 10%. Unexpectedly, we obtained IT-2F and IT-4F at higher yields than that of IT-3F. Therefore, we believe that exchange reactions between the end-groups exist in this kind of reaction. We then performed the synthesis via route ii and got IT-3F at a moderate yield of approximately 30%. The chemical structures of the intermediates and acceptors are characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR and mass spectroscopies. The detailed synthetic processes and characterization techniques are provided in the Experimental section of the ESI (Fig. S1†). The acceptors have very good solubility in commonly used solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene.

We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the impact of the end-groups on the energy levels and absorption properties of the acceptors (Fig. S2†). As shown in Fig. 2a, taking IT-4F as an example, we plotted the total and partial density of states (DOS) distributions, and the DOS distributions of IT-2F and IT-3F were also investigated and the results are provided in Fig. S3.† It is very interesting that the core unit contributes greatly to the orbitals around the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels while the end-groups have the dominant impact on the orbitals near the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the acceptors, which is related to electron transport and has a crucial role in determining the VOC of the OSCs. The modulation of the end-groups comprises a very efficient method to tune the performance of this kind of acceptor.

Fig. 2b displays the calculated absorption spectra of the three acceptors. With increasing number of fluorine atoms, the acceptors show enhanced molar absorption coefficients in the 600–800 nm wavelength range, which have a good consistency with the measured absorption spectra in diluted solutions (Fig. 2c). The blending of IT-2F and IT-4F at a molar ratio of 1:1 shows similar absorption properties to IT-3F, implying their excellent mixability. From solutions to films, the absorption spectra of the acceptors are red-shifted and larger shifts are observed with a higher degree of fluorination (Fig. 2d). All the thin films possess strong absorption at 600–800 nm with absorption coefficients of ∼1.2 × 105 cm−1. We estimated the molecular energy levels of the acceptors by square wave voltammetry measurements, as shown in Fig. S4.† The ionization potential (IP) and electro affinity (EA) are calculated as 5.63/4.06, 5.67/4.09 and 5.68/4.14 eV for IT-2F, IT-3F and IT-4F, respectively. The IT-2F:IT-4F (1:1) blend was also measured in parallel, showing an IE/EA of 5.67/4.09 eV, which is located between the energy levels of two neat materials and is very close to that of IT-3F. We then performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements on the three acceptors and the blend (Fig. 2e). With more fluorine atoms, the acceptors show higher binding energies, suggesting gradually decreased IEs. To acquire a deep understanding of the blending between IT-2F and IT-4F at the molecular energy levels, we established molecular models with varied IT-2F:IT-4F ratios by referring to the reported studies (Fig. S5†).25 Both the HOMO and LUMO levels exhibit a monotonous shift to low energies with the content of IT-4F, which agrees very well with the UPS and CV results (Fig. 2f). We also measured the electron mobilities of the three acceptors. As shown in Fig. S6,† IT-3F possesses a high electron mobility of 1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas IT-2F shows a relatively low electron mobility of 8.42 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and IT-4F shows an electron mobility of 9.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.
We selected a wide bandgap polymer named PBDB-TF as a donor material and fabricated the OSCs to study the photovoltaic performance of the acceptors. The devices adopt a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-fluorene-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br)/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and PFN-Br served as the anode and cathode interlayers, respectively.
As displayed in the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the summary of the photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 3a and Table 1), the PBDB-TF:IT-2F device shows a maximum VOC of 0.91 V but the lowest JSC of 19.57 mA cm−2, leading to a PCE of 12.65%. In comparison, the PBDB-TF:IT-4F device yields the lowest VOC of 0.86 V but a higher JSC of 20.85 mA cm−2, achieving a PCE of 13.62%. For the PBDB-TF:IT-3F device, both the VOC (0.90 V) and JSC (20.35 mA cm−2) values are quite good, resulting in a maximum PCE of 13.83%. We optimized the blending ratios of IT-2F:IT-4F in the ternary OSCs to achieve the best device performance (Table S1†). Ternary cells with IT-2F:IT-4F = 1:1 in weight ratio and molar ratio all demonstrate similar device performance to PBDB-TF:IT-3F binary cells. With increasing amount of IT-4F, the ternary devices show decreased VOCs and increased JSCs (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, the ternary devices show improved fill factors (FF) compared to the binary OSCs. At a ratio of 0.2:0.8, a remarkable PCE of 14.04% is recorded, with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 20.70 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.1%. Fig. 3c shows the variation of PCEs for the devices, from which it can be seen that the ternary OSCs have obviously higher PCEs than the binary devices.

Fig. 3d displays the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the OSCs. The photo-response regions of the devices exhibit a good consistency with the corresponding absorption spectra of the active layers (Fig. S7†). The narrowed photo-response region should be responsible for the relatively low JSC in the PBDB-TF:IT-2F device. The PBDB-TF:IT-3F and ternary OSCs have slightly changed photon-response onsets in the short wavelength region. The deviations between integral current densities (Table 1) from the EQEs and JSCs of J–V measurements are less than 5% for the devices. It is worth noting that the ternary device displays slightly higher EQE values than the binary OSCs at approximately 300–500 nm.
In order to investigate the origin of the improved FF and EQE in the ternary devices, we measured the carrier mobilities and lifetimes in the devices. Photo-induced charge-carrier extraction in a linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements were conducted to obtain the comprehensive charge-carrier mobility of the working devices. As exhibited in Fig. 3e, the PBDB-TF:IT-2F, PBDB-TF:IT-3F, PBDB-TF:IT-4F and ternary devices show photo-CELIV mobilities of 1.88 × 10−4, 2.03 × 10−4, 1.65 × 10−4 and 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
We than performed transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements to measure the carrier lifetimes in the binary and ternary OSCs (Fig. 3f). At a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, the charge carrier lifetimes are 0.85, 1.33, 1.45 and 2.70 μs for PBDB-TF:IT-2F, PBDB-TF:IT-3F, PBDB-TF:IT-4F and the ternary devices, respectively. The higher charge carrier mobility and longer charge carrier lifetime will be beneficial for efficient charge transport and contribute to better photovoltaic performance, which may be associated with the cascade charge transfer in the ternary system. The energy transfer from IT-2F to IT-4F and electron transport in the ternary blends may improve the mobility and lifetime in ternary blends.25,40
We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to probe the morphologies of the acceptors, binary and ternary films. All films were fabricated under the same conditions as the optimized devices. The morphologies of the pure and blended acceptor films, IT-2F, IT-3F, IT-4F and IT-2F:IT-4F = 1:1, are provided in Fig. S8;† the more homogeneous morphology of the blended films indicates the good miscibility of IT-2F and IT-4F. As for the blend morphologies of active layers, the AFM height images (Fig. S9a–d†) reveal that the four blends have uniform surfaces with root-mean-square surface roughnesses of around 2–3 nm. From the AFM phase images (Fig. S9e–h†), nanoscale phase separation domains of appropriate sizes are observed. The TEM patterns also confirm the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks in the bulk of the four blends. When compared with the binary films (PBDB-TF:IT-2F and PBDB-TF:IT-4F), the ternary film (PBDB-TF:IT-2F:IT-4F) shows very little difference in morphology characterization, suggesting their good mixability.
Beyond the three acceptors discussed above, many other non-fullerene acceptors have been developed by modification of the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures like ITIC,31 such as IT-M,39 IDTBR,41 IDT-BOC6,42 NFBDT43 and IT-4Cl.35 They have demonstrated very good photovoltaic performance in binary OSCs. As these acceptors possess varied molecular energy levels and absorption regions, it is very interesting to explore what will happen when blending multiple acceptors in the devices.
As shown in Fig. 4a, we selected five acceptors (IT-M, ITIC, IT-2F, IT-4F and IT-4Cl) to fabricate multi-component OSCs, where PBDB-TF was used as the polymer donor. Among the acceptors, IT-M has the highest EA of −3.94 eV but the narrowest absorption, while IT-4Cl possesses the lowest EA but the widest absorption with an onset at approximately 830 nm (Fig. 4b and c). The photovoltaic parameters of the binary OSCs are listed in Table S2.† The PBDB-TF:IT-M device yields the maximum VOC of 1.01 V and the PBDB-TF:IT-4Cl shows the best JSC of 22.23 mA cm−2. When the five acceptors of equal mass (20% for each) were blended with the polymer donor PBDB-TF, the six-component OSCs show a compromised VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 19.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.65, leading to a PCE of 11.41% (Fig. 4d and Table 2). If we want to obtain a higher VOC or a higher JSC, we just need to increase the content of ITIC, ITM (Table S3†) or IT-4F in the blends, and both of the resulting multi-component OSCs will achieve good PCEs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated a ternary solar cell by integrating the advantages of two non-fullerene acceptors, IT-2F and IT-4F. Compared with the binary OSCs, the ternary device achieved a compromised VOC but improved FF, leading to an outstanding PCE of 14.0%. A non-fullerene acceptor IT-3F was synthesized to make a comparison with the ternary systems. Both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that ternary blending plays a role similar to chemical modification in modulating the bandgap structure of this kind of acceptor. Based on these findings, we studied the photovoltaic performance of multi-component OSCs by blending five non-fullerene acceptors together. Interestingly, the six-component OSCs show VOCs and JSCs that are easily tuned by changing the ratios of the components, and very good PCEs can be obtained. Considering the varied electronic structures of the numerous non-fullerene acceptors, our work demonstrates that multi-component blending might be an easy and effective strategy for fine-tuning the photovoltaic parameters of OSCs.
