    , Accepted 10th October 2018First published on 11th October 2018AbstractA facile in situ seeded ion exchange approach was used to produce nearly monodisperse and uniformly distributed PbS quantum dots (QDs) on mesoporous TiO2 films. This strategy solves the size distribution problem for conventional SILAR-processed QDs and shows promise for constructing high-performance near-infrared-responsive PbS QD solar cells.
Inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising as light absorbers for constructing highly efficient, stable next-generation solar cells owing to their unusual optoelectronic properties, including the quantum size effect, multiple exciton generation (MEG), high absorption coefficient, ease of fabrication, cost-effectiveness and superior stability toward the ambient environment.1–3 QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have achieved substantial advances in material development, configuration design, and performance optimization.4 In particular, the theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSCs reaches a high value of 44% when the MEG effect is included.5,6 A number of QDs have been explored for photovoltaic applications, including binary cadmium chalcogenides (CdS, CdSe, CdTe),7,8 binary lead chalcogenides (PbS, PbSe, PbTe),6,9,10 binary silver chalcogenides (Ag2S, Ag2Se),11,12 ternary chalcogenides (CuInS2, CuInSe2, AgInSe2, etc.),13–15 and ternary and quaternary alloyed compounds (CdSexTe1−x, PbSxSe1−x, CuInSexS2−x, etc.).16–18 The large number of QDs affords plenty of choice for tailoring the absorption spectrum and band structure.
As one of the important IV–VI group semiconductors, lead sulfide (PbS) QDs have attracted special attention for solar cells. PbS QDs have two major advantages. The narrow bandgap (0.41 eV for the bulk material) extends light absorption towards the near-infrared (NIR) range of the solar spectrum, and the large exciton Bohr radius (18 nm) may allow the MEG effect to be harnessed.19 However, there is still a large gap between the present efficiency level and the potential value for PbS QDSCs despite major advances over the past few years. Researchers have explored a number of strategies to enhance device performance, such as surface passivation,20 metal ion doping,21 and band engineering,22 whereas little attention has been paid to developing new methods of fabricating PbS QDs. The most common processing methods can be classified as in situ or ex situ.23 Typically, the ex situ strategies suffer from complicated synthetic processes for preparing colloidal QDs and problems obtaining sufficient and uniform coverage of QDs because of the bulky nature of colloidal nanoparticles.19,24 These problems are often overcome by in situ strategies, especially the most widely used successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for QD loading,24 which has been optimized.25 SILAR allows a high loading of QDs, thereby ensuring adequate light harvesting. However, SILAR-processed QDs usually suffer from the problem of broad size distribution because of the excessive growth of QDs.23 These shortcomings slow charge transport and allow charge recombination in the photoanodes.23,26 QDs should have a suitable particle size and narrow size distribution. Therefore, better innovative synthesis and processing approaches to prepare high quality QDs and construct highly efficient solar cells are still urgently required.
To address this challenge, we explore a facile and effective ion exchange (IE) approach to produce uniformly distributed PbS QDs on mesoporous TiO2 films. The typical IE process (Fig. 1, experimental details provided in the ESI†) involves chemical bath deposition to load the PbSO3 seeds, followed by an IE reaction between PbSO3 and S2−. This strategy allows the synthesis of nearly monodisperse QDs with a well-defined shape, thereby solving the broad size distribution problem for the conventional in situ-processed QDs. Moreover, this approach uses low-cost solution processes at low temperatures and ambient conditions, which are ideal for up-scaling. Compared with conventional SILAR, the IE-processed PbS QDSCs enhanced photovoltaic performance.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the typical IE approach for the deposition of PbS QDs on mesoporous TiO2 films. 
The microscopic nanostructures of QDs loaded on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the IE-processed PbS QDs (Fig. 2a) shows well-distributed small uniform dots on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles, indicating the successful deposition of nearly monodisperse QDs. The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2b) reveals the ellipsoidal shape of the IE-processed PbS QDs with particle sizes around 3.5 nm. The lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of ∼0.297 nm are associated with the (200) plane of PbS.22 This particle size is much smaller than the Bohr radius of excitons (18 nm). The quantum confinement in colloidal nanocrystals has been demonstrated to contribute to the increase of the photovoltage of solar cells.27 The elemental mapping images for the sample with IE-processed PbS deposited on TiO2 (Fig. S1, ESI†) reveal the homogeneous uniform distribution of Pb and S on the TiO2 nanoparticles. This observation confirms the favorable loading of QDs by the IE approach. Compared with the IE-processed QDs, the SILAR-processed QDs (Fig. 2c and d) have a larger particle size and broader size distribution, ranging from 4.0 to 5.0 nm. That is, IE-processed QDs have a more homogeneous distribution. The broad size distribution of SILAR-processed QDs is thought to slow the charge transport in photoanodes because of unfavorable energy band structures. The IE approach suppresses unwanted excessive growth of QDs, and the resultant nearly monodisperse QDs are expected to afford more efficient charge transfer in photoanodes.28 The effective control of QD growth is also well-suited for engineering energy band structures. For a particular kind of QDs, a smaller particle size is accompanied by a larger bandgap and a higher conduction band (CB) level, contributing to the facilitated electron injection.6

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bare, PbSO3-seeded, IE-processed, and SILAR-processed PbS QDs (Fig. S2, ESI†) also show the deposition of QDs in the mesopores of TiO2 films. Compared with the IE-processed sample, the SILAR-processed sample has a more compact film surface, indicating a higher loading of QDs on the TiO2 films. X-ray diffraction patterns of film samples (Fig. S3a, ESI†) reveal two typical broad peaks at 2θ of 30.2° and 43.2°, corresponding to (200) and (220) reflections of cubic PbS with a rock salt structure (JCPDS No. 65-0132), respectively.22 Furthermore, an atomic ratio of Pb/S around 1.01/1, estimated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S3b, ESI†), reveals the nearly stoichiometric formation of PbS. These results confirm that the IE approach provides uniform nucleation over large-scale TiO2 films.
The absorption spectra of IE- and SILAR-processed PbS QD-sensitized TiO2 films are compared in Fig. 3a. Both photoanodes extend the light absorption range to the NIR region of the solar spectrum. In contrast to the SILAR method, the absorption spectrum of IE-processed QDs shows lower light absorption and a narrower harvesting region. This result indicates that the IE approach produces PbS QDs with a smaller particle size and lower QD loading. The effective bandgaps of PbS QDs processed by different approaches were estimated (Fig. 3b, detailed descriptions are provided in the ESI† and summarized in Table S1). The bandgap of IE-processed PbS QDs is around 1.43 eV, about 0.34 eV larger than that of SILAR-processed QDs (∼1.09 eV). Both bandgaps are much larger than that of 0.41 eV for bulk PbS as a result of the quantum size effect. The particle sizes of PbS QDs that show bandgaps of 1.43 and 1.09 eV have been reported to be around 3.4 and 4.3 nm, respectively.24,29 In general, for PbS QDs, the critical diameter for allowing favorable electron injection from PbS into TiO2 should be smaller than 4.3 nm.29 Thus, the PbS QDs processed by both approaches are suitable for building working devices. Fig. 3c shows the band structures (energy vs. vacuum) of PbS QDs with respect to TiO2, according to the estimated bandgaps and previous results.24,29 The smaller IE-processed QDs display a higher CB than that of SILAR-processed QDs, which may allow more efficient electron injection from PbS to TiO2. Fig. 3d shows the tuning of the light harvesting range by controlling the QD sizes. The extension of the absorption into the NIR region and the flexibility for band structure engineering make PbS QDs promising for photovoltaic applications.

Fig. 4a shows a schematic of the device configuration of a PbS QDSC and some of the main charge transport processes in the device. The working principle of the device can be described as follows. Under sunlight, PbS QDs harvest the photons incident upon the active layer, and then produce electron–hole pairs that are rapidly separated. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of the QDs are quickly injected into the CB of TiO2, and are collected by the conducting FTO substrate. The electrons are transferred from the photoanode to the counter electrode through the external circuit, and are further oxidized by Sn2− in the polysulfide electrolyte. The photogenerated holes left in the valence band of the QDs are scavenged by S2−. Thus, a closed circuit is formed, generating an electric current in the external circuit. The corresponding J–V characteristics of PbS QDSCs fabricated through the IE and SILAR approaches are shown in Fig. 4b. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The IE-processed device has Jsc of 8.73 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.43 V, and FF of 0.34, yielding a PCE of 1.30%. In contrast, the SILAR-processed device delivers poor PCE of 0.03%, Jsc of 2.26 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.07 V, and FF of 0.21. The IPCE spectra of PbS QDSCs (Fig. S4, ESI†) verify the Jsc values measured from the J–V curves. In PbS QDSCs, there are also some comparative charge recombination processes, which mainly involve the trapping of electrons by surface defects in the PbS QDs and the back reaction of electrons in the QDs and TiO2 with Sn2− in the electrolyte.22 The substantial charge recombination, probably arising from the high density of defect states in PbS QDs, is likely responsible for the overall poor performance of PbS QDSCs. To improve the device performance and stability further, an additional CdS passivation layer was added.22 The CdS capping layer greatly improved all the photovoltaic parameters for both the IE- and SILAR-processed devices. The IE-processed device with the CdS layer yielded an impressive PCE of 3.01%, much higher than that of the SILAR-processed device (2.48%).

The surface states of oxygen on the as-obtained QD-sensitized films were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4c and d show high-resolution O 1s spectra for IE- and SILAR-processed photoanodes, respectively, with the peak positions of different species identified by spectrum deconvolution. For both samples, the O 1s spectra contain a main peak centered at ∼530.0 eV attributed to oxygen bound to Ti4+ ions, and a weak shoulder at ∼531.8 eV, which indicates the presence of SO42−.30,31 These results imply the partial oxidation of the top-most QD layer in PbS-sensitized films because of the exposure to the ambient atmosphere. Moreover, careful examination of the O 1s peaks reveals that the degree of outer PbS oxidation for the IE-processed sample is lower than that for the SILAR-processed sample. This result may be explained by the rapid nucleation of IE-processed PbS QDs from the reaction precursors, which avoids the tedious SILAR process involving rinsing and drying in air numerous times. That is, the IE process provides much more effective protection of QDs from environmental conditions. The oxidation of photoactive QD layers, which leads to the changes in the electronic structure of QDs, has a detrimental impact on the corresponding cell performance.32 The lower oxidation of PbS QDs to PbSO4 on the surface of the IE-processed photoanode is reflected in the enhanced device performance. In addition, Carey et al. speculated that the presence of oxidation products in colloidal PbS QDs might contribute to positive surface passivation that improves performance; the oxidation products mainly include PbO and PbSO3, but not PbSO4.30 Considering that XPS is a surface-sensitive analysis with a typical probe depth of a few nanometers, the oxidation of QDs is proposed to occur at the surface rather than in the interior of films.30 In this work, because PbS QDs are obtained through the in situ IE between pre-deposited PbSO3 seeds and S2−, it is reasonable to expect that some PbSO3 seeds that are not involved in the IE process remain in the interior of the mesoporous TiO2 film. This small amount of PbSO3 might passivate the defect states on the surface of PbS QDs, thereby suppressing the charge recombination and improving electron collection.
The CdS-capped PbS QDSCs that show relatively high efficiencies were compared further, highlighting the benefits of the IE strategy with resorting to their optical and electrochemical properties (Fig. S5, detailed discussions are provided in the ESI†). The critical factors that determine the cell performance include light harvesting, electron injection and charge collection.6,28 Because the light harvesting of the IE-processed photoanode was lower than that of the SILAR-processed photoanode, we speculate that the electron injection and/or collection efficiencies followed by photocarrier generation were much higher in the IE-processed device in view of its superior cell performance. The higher CB of IE-processed QDs should contribute to more efficient electron injection. The electron collection was evaluated by electrochemistry impedance measurements. In contrast to the SILAR-processed device, the IE-processed device afforded larger recombination resistance, which allowed more effective suppression of recombination, thereby boosting the electron collection efficiency. The impedance results were supported by the dark J–V measurements, which showed a smaller dark current for the IE-processed device. In addition, the stability test of devices measured after various times reveals that the stability of the IE-processed device was better than that of the SILAR-processed device, probably because of the slower charge recombination.
In summary, nearly monodisperse PbS QDs with well-defined shapes were deposited on mesoporous TiO2 films through an in situ IE approach. In contrast to the conventional SILAR approach, our strategy offers the following two benefits for carrier multiplication to construct high-performance PbS QDSCs: (1) facilitated electron injection from PbS to TiO2, owing to the up-shifting of the CB level in the smaller QDs; and (2) lower charge recombination in the photoanode, arising from the monodispersity of the PbS QDs. Consequently, a PCE of 3.01% was achieved for the IE-processed PbS QDSCs capped with a CdS passivation layer. These results emphasize the importance of exploring innovative processing strategies to achieve the desired QD loading for highly efficient solar cells. The IE strategy is effective for the direct synthesis of compound semiconductors for various potential applications.
