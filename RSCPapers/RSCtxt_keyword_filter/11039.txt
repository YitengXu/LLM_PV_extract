    First published on 23rd December 2022AbstractFossil resources are rapidly depleting, forcing researchers in various fields of chemistry and materials science to switch to the use of renewable sources and the development of corresponding technologies. In this regard, the field of sustainable materials science is experiencing an extraordinary surge of interest in recent times due to the significant advances made in the development of new polymers with desired and controllable properties. This review summarizes important scientific reports in recent times dedicated to the synthesis, construction and computational studies of novel sustainable polymeric materials containing unchanged (pseudo)aromatic furan cores in their structure. Linear polymers for thermoplastics, branched polymers for thermosets and other crosslinked materials are emerging materials to highlight. Various polymer blends and composites based on sustainable polyfurans are also considered as pathways to achieve high-value-added products.

Introduction
The development and implementation of new technologies based on renewable raw materials has become “hot topics” and one of the key areas of research in the 21st century. Plant biomass appears to be one of the most promising alternatives to fossil sources, and significant progress has recently been made in obtaining new sustainable biofuels, building blocks for organic synthesis, and biologically active substances.1–3 Among the number of platform chemicals easily obtained by the conversion of natural polysaccharides,4,5 highly functionalized furans are of particular interest,6,7 which is emphasized recently by considering the F2A (furan-to-aromatics) process for industrial shortlinking8,9 and the “furanery” processes for furan refining.10
A most important and actively studied furanic platform chemical in the last two decades is 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), a “sleeping giant” of sustainable chemistry,11 which combines two active functional groups in its structure and can be selectively functionalized into a wide variety of oxidized, reduced or substituted derivatives.12,13 Moreover, despite its low reactivity, the furanic core itself can be modified via a number of C–H functionalization procedures with directing group assistance or using directing group-free protocols.14,15 From the materials science point of view, it is especially important that furfural, HMF and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), as well as their closest analogs can be used as starting compounds in the synthesis of new promising bio-based monomers.16–18 In agreement with the innovative concept of sustainable development,11 these furan platforms can serve as literally inexhaustible feedstock for the production of sustainable green alternatives to large-capacity polymeric materials, most of which are currently produced worldwide from petroleum-based benzene/toluene/xylene (BTX) derivatives.19
A significant number of papers are published annually in the field of furanic materials science with continued growth of interest in various applications (Fig. 1). The diversity of these fully or partially renewable polymers is emphasized by a significant number of reviews devoted to a detailed description and consideration of either linear materials (polyesters,20–22 polyamides,23 polyurethanes,24etc.) or their branched analogs (epoxy resins,25,26 polybenzoxazines,27,28etc.). However, there are no comparative analyses that deal with different types of polymers at the same time, which are necessary to illustrate state-of-the-art in the field of sustainable furan-based materials science.
 Fig. 1  Different areas of furan-based materials application and the trend towards an annual increase in the number of articles (bottom estimate) and the average number of citations per document according to the Scopus database. 
In this review, representative most important and significant reports are covered on the synthesis of novel furanic materials containing an aromatic furan rings in their unchanged form, published recently (mostly from 2017 to 2022). A plethora of work devoted to self-healable and click-polymerizable Diels–Alder materials are beyond the scope of this review; however, this chemistry is well described in other comprehensive reviews.29,30 Several other chemical transformations and corresponding materials were also reviewed,31–35 and those discussions will not be repeated here. Nonbiomass-derived furanic polymers were also not included in this work; only monomers easily derived from the platform chemicals furfural, HMF or FDCA are considered.
To systematize the studies under consideration, we will divide the materials into two types. The linear type includes unbranched polyesters, polyethers, polyurethanes, polyamides and other thermoplastics, as well as their blends and composites based on them. The branched type includes a variety of thermosetting plastics: epoxy resins, polybenzoxazines, vitrimers, branched polyesters/amides/imines, and different composites. Each type is subdivided into a few subsections, and can vary greatly in their size/structure – here, materials based on different monomers, such as FDCA, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) furan (BHMF), furanic benzoxazines, etc., will be considered separately (Fig. 2A).
 Fig. 2  Common examples of furanic monomers used in the preparation of a series of corresponding linear and branched materials (A), different types of specially tuned molecular frameworks for particular applications (B) and few other individual substrates, mentioned in this review (C). 
Diverse monomer types/combinations and a variety of chemical bindings
Limited structural and functional variabilities are often noted as limitations upon the comparison of furan-based monomers with a large variety of well-recognized classical monomers developed over many decades. Here, we point out that assumptions about the variability limitations are not correct, and we highlight the key directions how to further strengthen structural diversity.
For the analysis in this review, the monomers can be roughly divided into four types (Fig. 2B). The first type includes oxygen-containing monomers bearing few hydroxyl, carbonyl or carboxyl groups, and can be used for the synthesis of linear or branched polyesters, polyamides, polyimines, etc. The second type includes monomers that form polymeric chains through more specific reactions: substitution of fluoride in the aromatic ring, the Barbier reaction, C–H activation, etc. The polymerization of the third type monomers occurs due to the presence of unsaturated fragments in its structures and can proceed by chain transfer reactions or due to the involvement of alkyne fragments in the Glaser coupling or CuAAC reaction. Finally, the monomers of the fourth type polymerize by oxirane or benzoxazine ring opening and the generation of new reactive centers, which leads to the formation of cross-linked materials. Furan resin, which is crosslinked by the partial opening of furan heterocycles during the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol and the subsequent Diels–Alder reaction between the chains, can also be assigned to this type.
The possible paths of polymerization for different monomer types are generalized and are shown in Fig. 3. Various polymer-forming chemical conjugations (ester, (thio)ether, amide, triazolyl, etc.) are shown on the left side, where new chain assembling bonds are highlighted in color. Furan monomers of the above-defined types (on the top) can react with various co-monomers, e.g., diols, diamines, diacids and their esters, isocyanates (on the middle right) or with themselves, resulting in materials of different classes, both linear and cross-linked (on the bottom). Depending on the number of functional groups in the initial monomers (two or more), representatives of various classes were obtained for polyesters, polyamides and polyimines.
 Fig. 3  Roadmap for the preparation of various fully and partially renewable furanic polymers from different types of starting materials. See Fig. 2 for the structures of furan monomer types I–IV; chain assembling bonds – possible chemical bonds to assemble the polymer; cross-linking bonds – possible chemical bonds to build interconnections (CA – curing agent); co-monomers – additional monomers to combine with main furan monomer types; the products of these combinations are summarized as linear and branched materials at the bottom of the figure; the line thickness reflects the relative number of available examples (thin/thick line to the product denotes fewer/more examples currently available, correspondingly). 
Cross-linking bonds formed during the thermally or catalytically induced opening of the benzoxazine heterocycle or the curing of furan epoxy resins, as well as the Diels–Alder adduct of polyfurfuryl alcohol with its partially opened fragments, are shown at the top right. It should also be noted that the same comonomers can be used to obtain different types of polymers (cross-linked or linear) depending on the type of furanic starting materials, which demonstrates wide possibilities for controlling the product properties by changing the structure of the renewable monomer.
At the state-of-the-art level, we can emphasize the flexibility and variety of material construction pathways. Although the component of the central furan core is preserved, structural diversity is achieved by combinations of functional groups, different chemical bonds and components. In the sections below, we describe in more detail particular types of materials and also illustrate diverse functional properties.
Linear type
FDCA-based materials
Currently, the most actively studied linear furanic polymer is poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF), which originates from FDCA or its esters and ethylene glycol (EG). This material is considered a sustainable analog of BTX-derived poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and is widely used in various industrial fields. PEF has been known since the early 1950s, when Drewitt and coworkers proposed the polymerization of this novel biobased polyester in which a benzene moiety in PET was replaced by a furan moiety.36 Over the past seven decades, PEF has come a long way from being just an interesting example of a renewable polymer with almost no practical relevance to a “promising rising star” in materials science, considering now as not an alternative but a real future substitute for PET.37 Technical processes for the large-scale production of PEF are currently under development in the chemical industry (for example ref. 38 and others). This promising sustainable polyester benefits from its renewability and recyclability,39–41 high glass transition temperature and excellent barrier properties, which provide great potential in the area of green packaging applications.42,43 Additionally, it was recently shown that PEF is well suited for employment as a material for reusable 3D printing filaments44 and thermoplastic adhesives with very high adhesion to glass and various metals (Fig. 4).45 The specific thermomechanical properties of the furanic material may be due to the nonlinear structure of the polymer chains, which are twisted in contrast to the PET structure. In turn, very high adhesion to glass, various metals and alloys can be due to the presence of a significant number of oxygen-containing fragments in the PAF structure, which form van der Waals complexes with ions on the metal or glass surface.

It was discovered that the reason for the extremely low PEF gas permeability compared to PET is the higher dipole moment of the furan ring.46 Notably, this polarity has less and less effects with the growth of an alkyl chain, and the barrier properties rapidly decrease from ethylene to butylene counterparts,47 which is consistent with other trends in the change of the thermal and mechanical properties (Fig. 5A).48 However, PEF has only moderate thermal stability and suffers from a slow crystallization rate, poor crystallinity and associated brittleness due to the peculiarities of its crystal structure.49–51 These disadvantages can be partially solved by variation in material processing and controllable polymerization under different conditions52–56 with various metal and organic catalysts,57–63 isothermal crystallization of PEF,64 or mixing with stabilizing additives.65

Another development direction for modifying the properties of furanic polyesters is FDCA (co)polymerization with other diols and diacids – an extensive number of reports on the synthesis of other poly(alkylene/arylene 2,5-furandicarboxylates) (PAFs) have been published recently, as well as on polymers derived from several carboxylic monomers. For example, it was shown that PEF/PET copolyesters exhibit intermediate properties between neat materials and may have the advantages of both polymers: the high gas barrier properties of PEF and good thermal stability of its fossil-based counterpart.66–68 Interestingly, biaxially oriented copolymers can form several fractions with different degrees of crystallinity (Fig. 5B).66 The results of FDCA (co)polymerization with other glycols and acids (Scheme 1) are summarized in Table 1, which demonstrate wide variability in the properties of the obtained polyesters and the possibility of obtaining materials for a very different application. Finally, it was shown that annealing of poly(alkylene furanoates) results in its multiple melting behaviors on DSC thermograms and increases the crystallinity of polyesters.69

Copolymerization of FDCA with common monomers, widely used for the synthesis of large-tonnage polymers such as polylactide (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL), allows the regulation and control of the properties of the corresponding materials. Modification of lactic acid with poly(butylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) significantly improves the PLA thermal, mechanical and gas barrier properties while maintaining its inherent biodegradability.152 Likewise, the introduction of furanic segments in PCL chains accompanied by the addition of ethylene,153 butylene154,155 or longer glycolic fragments156 results in the excellent mechanical performance, enhanced thermal properties and noticeable biodegradability of the obtained materials. The enzymatic copolymerization of PCL with 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid, similar to ε-caprolactone in having both hydroxyl and carboxyl moieties in one molecule, also allows obtaining well-biodegradable materials but with an unsatisfactorily low molecular weight.157
Few examples of the synthesis of polyamides and mixed poly(ester-amide)s have also been reported. The enzymatic polyamidation of FDCA with different heteroatom diamines with oxygen or nitrogen into its chains results in materials with relatively high thermal stability.158 Polycondensation of FDCA chloroanhydride with 3,4′-diaminodiphenyl ether with subsequent dry-jet wet spinning allows obtaining aromatic polyamide fibers with excellent mechanical, thermal and flame-retardant properties, as well as a very high weight-average molecular weight of 477800 g mol−1.159 Polyamides from p-phenylene diamine were synthesized in different solvents to evaluate their degradation stability depending on the material microstructure.160 It was shown that the usage of N,N-dimethylacetamide leads to more thermally stable materials compared to N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone-derived materials. Copolycondensation of FDCA and TPA chloroanhydrides with prepolymerized fluorinated diamino-polyamide, followed by the treatment of materials with acetic anhydride, results in partially biobased block copoly(amide-imide)s suitable for colorless transparent film casting.161
Poly(ester-amide) analogues of poly(propylene furanoate), synthesized from FDCA, PG and 1,3-diaminopropane, exhibit good mechanical properties and high thermal/thermo-oxidative stability.162 Copolymerization of FDCA with diols and diamido-diols results in poly(ester-amide)s with rapid crystallization and increased crystallinity compared to analogous polyesters due to the suppression of intramolecular hydrogen bonds by the alkylene spacer (Fig. 7A).163,164

The enzymatic polymerization of FDCA with different even-numbers diols and diamines (from C4 to C12) was performed in ionic liquids, as well as polymerization with the corresponding bifunctional aminodiols, resulting in materials with similar properties.165 In the last example of polyamide synthesis, an interesting and novel approach was demonstrated – multicomponent polymerization was performed using the Ugi reaction of sucrose-derived and unpurified FDCA with isobutyraldehyde, tert-butyl isocyanide and 1,10-diaminodecane (Fig. 7B); however, the properties of the polymeric material were not studied appropriately in this work.166
BHMF-based materials
The list of articles published in the last five years and devoted to the synthesis of polymers from 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl) furan is much more limited compared to FDCA applications. Nevertheless, few examples of polyesterification using different catalysts have been reported: the enzymatic synthesis of polyesters with succinic, adipic and sebacic acids for potential PET substitution;167 the novel integrated process with subsequent fructose dehydration, HMF hydrogenation and BHMF esterification;168 the multicatalytic approach with Mg-catalyzed FDCA esterification, Ru-catalyzed hydrogenation to BHMF and Mg-catalyzed polyesterification with adipic and pimelic acids;169 organocatalyzed polymerization via oxidative esterification of BHMF with different dialdehydes, including renewable 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and bis-HMF ether – 5,5′-oxybis(5-methylene-2-furaldehyde) (OBFA).170 It should be noted that 2,5-bis(aminomethyl) furan, an amino analog of BHMF, can also be involved in such organocatalyzed oxidative polycondensation with different aldehydes, which results in the formation of corresponding polyamides.171
A mechanochemical approach was used to carry out the reaction between BHMF, 4,4′-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and a variety of diols or diamines, resulting in eco-friendly thermoplastic polyurethanes with controllable thermomechanical properties (Fig. 6IV).172 Click-polycondensation of BHMF diacrylate with aliphatic and aromatic dithiols via thiol-Michael addition allows the corresponding poly(tioether-ester)s to be obtained in a short time at room temperature,173 as well as copolymers with PLA, combining soft thioether–ester chains and hard PLA fragments.174 Finally, uncommon environmentally degradable poly(silylether)s can be synthesized using Mn-catalyzed polycondensation of BHMF and other furan precursors with disubstituted aliphatic and aromatic silanes.175
Scattered materials
This section contains several reports on linear polymers, which cannot be unified under one furan precursor (Fig. 2A) or chemical class. Two isomeric furoins, synthesized via organocatalyzed benzoin condensation of HMF and furfural, were used as starting materials in the synthesis of various polyesters and polyurethanes with a wide range of Tg values (Fig. 6V); however, this approach still requires the use of toxic and hazardous acyl chlorides and diisocyanates for effective polymerization.176 Another furoin triol, derived by organocatalyzed condensation of two HMF molecules, was used for the enzymatic synthesis of polyesters using succinic and sebacic acids.177 A feature of this work is the possibility of selectively esterifying only primary hydroxyl groups in the presence of secondary groups, which results in linear polyesters with free alcohol moieties.
Condensation of guaiacol with furfural results in the bisphenolic monomer, which was copolymerized with widely used in the resin industry bisphenol A (BPA) and either difluorinated benzophenone178 or biphenyl sulfone.179 Both copolymers have random structures and good thermal stability and are suitable for the construction of tough transparent and flexible films. Conjugated bis-furanic diol was synthesized by aldol condensation of HMF and acetone and then used for the preparation of polyurethanes and polyesters, which can further serve as flexible UV-blocking packaging materials.180 It was also shown that the usage of partially or fully hydrogenated derivatives with broken conjugation allows the control of the thermal and mechanical parameters of the obtained polymers. Diesters of bisfuroic diacid and TPA with EG were copolymerized to obtain materials with enhanced oxygen gas barrier properties and superior UV blocking.181 Partially bio-based materials with excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties, decreased viscosity and good processability were obtained via the nucleophilic poly-substitution of fluorine atoms in FDCA-derived di(fluoroaryl) ketones by different nucleophiles.182 It was found that the potential platform chemical 5-chloromethylfurfural is prone to self-polymerization during the zinc-mediated Barbier reaction in an aqueous medium with good monomer conversion, resulting in the hydroxy-decorated material with a relatively low molecular weight.183
Acetal based on two HMF molecules and pentaerythritol was used for the synthesis of copolyesters with TPA and HG, as well as for the preparation of polyurethanes from the diisocyanate derivatives of lignocellulose-derived isophorone.184 This work also accompanied LCA and indicated the high sustainability of monomeric spiro-acetal. Another cycloacetal based on HMF and di-trimethylolpropane was copolymerized with poly-BG and two diisocyanates.185 Melting spinning of the obtained polyurethanes results in long fibers with a homogeneous thickness, low coloration and inherent flame resistance. Acetalization of bis-furfural with glycerol results in three isomeric diols, which can be polycondensed with either succinic or phthalic acid to provide chemically recyclable materials with enhanced thermal properties.186
Since the C2 and C5 positions of the furan ring are susceptible to electrophilic attack, furoic acid methyl ester was condensed with levulinic acid to provide a bis-furanic diester monomer, which was then used for the synthesis of polyamides with different diamines.187 Additionally, a partially biorenewable amine obtained by the condensation of furfurylamine (FA) with acetone was used for this purpose. A rare example of unsubstituted furan polymerization was demonstrated by cationic polycondensation of this heterocycle with 1-phenylazepan-2-one, providing useful oligomeric precursors to small band-gap soluble materials suitable for photovoltaic and solar cell applications.188
The condensation of furfuryl isocyanate with propargylic alcohol, followed by the Glaser coupling of the obtained alkyne, provides a symmetrical furanic diacetylene, which can be topochemically polymerized in the corresponding poly(diacetylene).189 The crystal structure of the obtained material was thoroughly studied and characterized. The reaction of furfuryl thiol with myrcene peroxide provides a diene monomer that can be involved in reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, resulting in a series of materials with tunable molecular weights, hydrophilicity and mechanical properties.190
Acetylene fragments can be inserted into carbonyl-containing furans by the reaction with the Bestmann–Ohira reagent, which provides a series of furanic alkynes.191 Symmetrical 2,5-diethynylfuran can be involved in Cu(I)-catalyzed Glaser–Eglinton–Hay polymerization, resulting in a high-energy material, while Rh-catalyzed polymerization provides a series of conjugated polyacetylenes with furanic moieties. The insertion of an azide fragment into furanic acetylene allows a “click” Cu(I)-catalyzed self-polycondensation to be carried out with a low molecular weight poly(furan triazole)s as a product.192
Blend materials
Since the largest number of studies in the field of linear furan-containing materials is devoted to FDCA-based polyesters, these materials have indeed attracted significant attention in the field of the creation and study of polymer blends. Because vigorous mixing under harsh conditions can lead to transesterification of polyesters, by the term “blends” in this review, we mean miscible or immiscible mixtures of polymers with low or zero degree of copolymerization, unless otherwise noted.
A series of reports are devoted to the study of PAF miscibility with each other and with other polymers: PET and its propylene counterpart (PPT), PLA, polycarbonate (PC), and poly(butylene 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate) (PBN).193–199 It was shown that, despite the homogeneous nature of PEF/PPF mixtures, all other blends were either only partially miscible (PPF/PBF, PBF/PET, and PBF/PPT) or completely immiscible (PEF/PBF, PBF/PLA, PBF/PC, PBF/PBN, and all PC blends). However, in many cases, reactive blending by the vigorous mixing of polymers at elevated temperatures for an extended period of time leads to transesterification and copolymerization of polyesters, which results in the homogenization of blends.
Despite the immiscible nature of PBF and PLA mixtures, these blends have excellent mechanical properties, high impact strengths, and good barrier properties and can be toughened/strengthened by the elongation process (Fig. 6VI).200,201 Additionally, the preliminary copolymerization of PBF with poly-EG allows PLA-based blends to be reached with limited miscibility and improved biodegradability.202 It was shown that retroreflection, manifesting in a shining surface of some binary blends, was caused by its “cat's eye” morphology: PBF droplets fixed on PLA lamellar crystals.203 Blends of PLA and other PAFs with different carbon numbers in the alkylene chain (C5, C8–12) obtained via the wet spinning process were also immiscible, but their low water absorbency and solvent retention allow their potential application as sustainable fibers/textiles.204,205 The use of dicumyl peroxide on PLA blends with FDCA/dodecanedioic acid/itaconic acid/PG copolyester results in the simultaneous dynamic vulcanization and interfacial compatibilization of the mixture, providing a material with high and balanced mechanical properties.206 A mixture of PEF and biobased polyamide 11 can also be modified by treatment with a commercial epoxy compatibilizer, which allows obtaining a blend with excellent toughness.207
The blends of PEF with CHDM-modified PET (also known as polyethylene terephthalate glycol, PET-G) were immiscible but exhibited improved thermal stability and barrier properties compared to neat PEF and PET-G, respectively.208 Finally, the blends of PEF with poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) with a sea-island morphology, where the latter acts as a continuous phase and the former as a discrete phase, exhibit good thermal stability and mechanical properties, exceeding those of the starting materials.209
Composite materials
By the term “composites” in this review, we mean complex multicomponent materials, consisting of furan monomer-derived polymer matrices reinforced with some particles, fibers or other agents. As in the previous section, the overwhelming majority of composites based on unbranched furanic polymers are associated with FDCA derivatives. As an exception to this trend, an example of a BHMF-derived composite not based on a Diels–Alder cycloaddition network has been described.210 In this report, three aliphatic isocyanides were reacted with poly-EG with subsequent polycondensation of the resulting pre-polymers with BHMF synthesized from different furan precursors. Cellulose citrate was chosen as a thickener for the synthesized polyurethane foams, which allowed improving its mechanical properties.
The selected representative examples of FDCA-based composites are summarized in Table 2. Most of the articles are devoted to increasing the PAF crystallization ability attempts by adding highly crystalline nucleating agents, either during the polymerization or cooling process.

In addition to composites based only on neat FDCA polyesters, it was shown that the addition of acetylated bacterial cellulose into a copolymer of PBF and diglycolic acid results in a material with high stiffness and reasonable elasticity, along with high barrier properties.211 Additionally, when an immiscible blend of PLA and poly(dodecylene furanoate) was filled with reduced graphene oxide, it served as a weak compatibilizer for these materials, allowing the composite to be obtained with improved ductility, crystallization kinetics and gas barrier performance.212
Finally, although materials in the studies listed below cannot be called furanic polymers in the strict sense, we would like to mention a few recent studies on the modification of large-tonnage materials by their combination with furanic additives. The low thermal stability of PLA can be partially resolved by mixing PLA with FA-based salt213 or phosphamide,214 which significantly improves the flame retardancy of the obtained composites. Additionally, FDCA derivatives and esters of its reduced counterpart 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid can be used as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plasticizers, decreasing Tg and improving the mechanical properties of mixed materials.215–219
Branched type
Polybenzoxazine materials
The most significant amount of work on the synthesis of renewable furan-based branched polymers is dedicated to polybenzoxazines (pBOx) – a relatively new class of advanced materials with improved intrinsic properties, such as the near-zero volumetric change upon curing, low flammability and water absorption, high thermal stability and char yield. Another benefit is that there is no need to use strong acid catalysts for curing, accompanied by the release of only nontoxic byproducts during thermally or catalytically induced ROP of the BOx ring.247,248 The main method for synthesizing benzoxazines is the Mannich condensation between o-unsubstituted phenol, aliphatic or aromatic amine and carbonyl fragment (usually paraformaldehyde). Furfurylamine or its derivative acts as an amine component, but it is not the only bioderived reagent in this condensation – phenols and polyphenols are also ubiquitous in nature, which makes them highly promising substrates for the synthesis of green or even wholly sustainable materials.249 The high reactivity of phenols and a wide variety of their chemical structures opens up great opportunities for tuning the BOx and pBOx properties by varying substituents, encouraging further studies of the phenolic structure influence on the characteristics and performance of the resulting materials.
Despite the complexity of the benzoxazine ROP mechanism, it is assumed that the improvement in the characteristics of furan-containing polybenzoxazines can be associated with an increase in the number of reactive centers (Fig. 8I). It was shown that the isomerism of the double bond in the p-propylene fragment of eugenol/isoeugenol leads to a significant difference in the ROP rate and properties of pBOx due to the conjugation of the isoeugenol propylene fragment with the aromatic system, which can serve as indirect evidence in favor of this assumption.250 Additionally, the high thermal and oxidative stabilities of pBOx may be due to the hyper crosslinking related to the presence of hydrogen bonding interactions between furanic oxygen atoms and phenolic hydroxy-groups, which are released during ROP.251,252

Several studies have been aimed at establishing relationships between PBOx material properties, the rate of ROP and the monomer chemical structure, such as the number of methoxy groups,253 the donor–acceptor properties of the p-substituent,254 the presence of isomeric neglected short alkyl chains255 or halogens256 on phenolic substrates. Despite the complex nature of the reaction, it can be concluded based on the experiments performed that the bulk and electron–donor substituents reduce the polymerization rate and the thermal stability of the resulting materials, while electron-withdrawing substituents promote ROP and have a beneficial effect on the properties of the polymers. The use of bulk carbonyl counterparts, either aromatic or aliphatic, instead of common formaldehyde also increases the polymerization activity and thermal stability of pBOx.257–259 Furthermore, the insertion of furfural as a carbonyl moiety into the naphthoxazine ring with subsequent MgCl2-catalyzed ROP results in a sustainable material with high thermal stability, flame resistance and self-extinguishing properties.260
Another way to increase the rate of ROP and lower the curing temperature is the synthesis of BOx containing free carboxyl groups in its structure, probably due to the self-catalytic effect of acidic fragments on the polymerization process.261–265 The disadvantage of this approach is the tendency of the free carboxyl groups to decarboxylate; however, it has been shown that amidation of acid prevents this process while maintaining the positive effect of the carboxyl group on the properties of the material.266,267 Thiolic fragments can also catalyze the polymerization of BOx and can be easily obtained by Willgerodt–Kindler thioamidation of carbonyl-containing substrates with amines and elemental sulfur.268 Finally, ROP of BOx can be dramatically increased by the microwave irradiation of starting materials in different solvents269,270 or under solvent-free conditions.271 Several reports on PBOx synthesis from different phenols, paraformaldehyde and some additives are briefly summarized in Table 3.

In addition to monomeric pBOx precursors, benzoxazines can be prepolymerized without opening the BOx ring, forming three types of polymers: main-,292 side-293 and end-chain294 polybenzoxazine precursors, usually resulting in materials with a higher cross-linking density and reduced fragility after curing. A furan-based main chain-type pBOx precursor was synthesized from silylated eugenol, paraformaldehyde, FA and diamines with even carbon numbers from two to six. These oligomers are suitable for vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding due to soft silicon segments, resulting in pBOx with good thermal and mechanical stabilities, along with hydrophobic performance.295 Sustainable diamine, synthesized via the condensation of FA with acetone, can be used for the preparation of polymeric BOx, where salicylic acid condensed with paraformaldehyde serves as a phenolic source. Transparent films with high Tg and thermal stability can be obtained after curing this resin.296 A hyperbranched polymeric main-chain-type BOx precursor was synthesized from 2,5-bis(aminomethyl) furan (BAMF) and tris-phenolic resveratrol. Subsequent curing results in a nonignitable material with good thermal stability, an ultralow coefficient of thermal expansion and low dielectric constants, which makes it suitable for high-frequency microelectronic device applications.297 Another main-chain type resin was prepared from renewable daidzein, FA and polyetheramine and was distinguished by excellent processability, the variability of the product thermal and mechanical properties and very good antibacterial and algae-killing activities.298
An end-chain-type pBOx precursor was synthesized from FA, phloretic acid, paraformaldehyde and either EG or poly-EGs with different molecular weights. Rheo-kinetic measurements revealed the lengthening of the gelation time and lowering of the mechanical relaxation temperature with the increasing backbone chain length of the model molecules.299 Finally, the benzoxazine end-capped oligomer was synthesized from FA, paraformaldehyde, vanillin and diamine-terminated polyether, resulting after curing in materials for shape memory applications with ultrahigh mechanical properties due to the combination of a Schiff base and rigid polyether structural fragments.300
Another research direction is the blending of BOx with other resins, either sustainable or not, with subsequent curing and the study of combined material properties. Polybenzoxazines derived from a mixture of two or three BOx can often exhibit better thermal stability and flame retardancy, along with improved mechanical and barrier properties, compared with their mono-sourced analogues.301–309 Few other studies have been devoted to the co-curing of furan-based BOx with the commercial epoxy EPON Resin 828,310 polypyrrole311 and epoxidized castor oil,312,313 as well as mechanochemical preparation of pBOx-based polyamide resin,314 resulting in a variety of materials with tunable properties depending on the nature and the ratio of the reagents.
Epoxy resins
Epoxy resins are well known as one of the most widely used thermosets and are suitable for the preparation of coatings, electronic materials, adhesives, and matrices for fiber-reinforced composites and other applications because of their outstanding mechanical properties, high adhesion strength, good heat resistance and high electrical resistance.315 Unfortunately, most of the commercially available resins are based on the nonrenewable diglycidyl ether of BPA (DGEBA), which was recently identified as an endocrine disrupting molecule associated with many disease entities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and reproductive and neurodevelopmental disorders.316 The active search for new bioderived and nontoxic DGEBA alternatives for this reason has led to a series of studies on furan-based epoxy resins and curing agents. It should be noted that despite the renewable nature of furanic alcohols and acids, the corresponding epoxy monomers are only partially sustainable since epichlorohydrin is a non-renewable and highly toxic substance, the use of which should be avoided in the future. For this situation, even a partial replacement for bisphenol A with less potential toxicity of the resulting materials is an extremely relevant direction of development in the field of epoxy resins.
The simplest furanic diol is BHMF, which can be condensed with large-capacity and affordable epichlorohydrin with the formation of 2,5-bis[(oxiran-2-ylmethoxy)methyl]furan (BOMF). Curing of this furanic epoxy resin using the common curing agents (Fig. 9A and B) resulted in materials with good chemical–physical properties, a wide range of Tg and tensile moduli,317 high crosslink density and excellent flame retardancy.318 Additionally, the diglycidyl derivative of dimeric BHMF ether (Fig. 9B) was cured by the diamine derivatives of di-, tri- and tetra-EG and exhibited good thermal stability and outstanding flame retardancy.319 As in the previous polybenzoxazine section, it was demonstrated that the superiority of furan-based thermosets over petroleum-derived thermosets can be explained by the presence of hydrogen bonding interactions, sufficiently increasing the crosslinking density and the thermal/mechanical properties of sustainable polymers.320,321
 Fig. 9  (A) General scheme of furanic epoxy oligomer preparation and schematic representation of its subsequent curing. (B) Some furan-based epoxy resins and curing agents covered in this section. 
Similarly, the ester counterpart of BOMF was synthesized from FDCA (Fig. 9B) and cured using di(aminophenyl)sulfones, resulting in thermosets with ultrahigh stiffness and Tg, high thermomechanical properties, flame retardancy, fluorescence intensity and hydrophilicity.322,323 UV-induced cationic copolymerization of this resin with epoxidized fatty methyl esters allows the insertion of flexible hydrophobic structures into the polymer network, maintaining its rigidity and mechanical stability.324 The coupling of FDCA and eugenol with subsequent epoxidation of its double bonds results in self-curing epoxy-ester resin with a low dissipation factor and signal propagation loss in a circuit.325 The use of a curing agent such as methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride allows demonstrating the advantages of this renewable resin in terms of thermal properties, rigidity and flame retardancy compared to DGEBA.326 FDCA was used for the preparation of hyperbranched resin from tris-hydroxy functionalized isocyanurate, mercaptopropionic acid and allyl glycidyl ether. This dendrimer was then copolymerized with DGEBA, leading to degradable and recyclable materials with improvements in the impact, tensile strength, flexural strength, storage modulus and elongation compared to the neat petroleum-derived epoxy resin.327
An interesting example of copolymerization was described for furfuryl alcohol (FAlc) glycidyl ether, which can be used as a reactive diluent in ROP of BPA- and m-toluidine-derived BOx, resulting in blends with good thickness at RT, reduced viscosity and increased curing temperature.328
Furan derivatives can be used not only as epoxy resins but also as curing agents for other monomers. The condensation of FA with acetone leads to the heterocyclic amino analog BPA, which can be used for curing BOMF and its diethyl phosphate-modified derivative.329 It should be noted that the insertion of phosphate fragments remarkably improves the flame retardancy and mechanical properties of thermosets. This bis-furanic diamine was also used for curing bio-based epoxy resin, synthesized from syringaldehyde, 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole and epichlorohydrin. The obtained material demonstrated not only excellent flame retardancy, a high limiting oxygen index and Tg but also inherent antibacterial activity.330
The widely used phosphaphenanthrene-oxide DOPO is prone to react with imine bonds and can be used for the preparation of furan-based flame retardant hardeners for DGEBA. Curing agents synthesized from tyrosine, furfural and DOPO lead to materials with improved strength, toughness and flame retardancy,331 as do their counterparts synthesized from the aniline analog BPA.332 The addition of DOPO to the “inverse” imine, prepared by the reaction of FA with vanillin, leads to a hardener that allows obtaining a DGEBA-based transparent nonignitable material with improved mechanical properties.333 Additionally, even in the absence of polymerizable fragments, phosphate-modified furans can be used as monomeric flame retardant additives for DGEBA modification.334
Nonmodified FA can be used for curing commercially available cardanol-based epoxy resins, resulting in potential anti-ice coatings with very low ice adhesion strength and corrosion current, as well as high corrosion potential. These thermosets can be additionally hydrophobized by copolymerization with diamine-terminated polydimethylsiloxane.335 Finally, an interesting bis(furanic)-bis(carboxy)-cyclobutane hardener can be synthesized from furfural and malonic acid with subsequent blacklight-catalyzed dimerization of furan-acrylic acid. The curing of epoxidized linseed oil then leads to fully bio-based hard rubber materials with a high tensile strength and Tg.336
Scattered materials
Several studies on the preparation of new branched furanic materials in other chemical classes have also been reported. The term “furan resin” is widely used for the designation of resin derived from acid-catalyzed polycondensation of FAlc. The complex structure of this thermoset was studied by NMR,337 FT-IR and resonant Raman spectroscopies338 and is due to chain crosslinking by side processes: Diels–Alder cycloaddition and furan ring opening. The carrying out of polycondensation in protic polar solvents and without them makes it possible to tune materials properties and crosslinking degree by controlling over the course of these side processes.339,340 The copolymerization of FAlc with lactic acid allowed obtaining fully bioderived polymers with a high furanic character and low crosslinking degree.341 Another bio-based partner for FAlc and its eleostearate are natural oligomeric tung oil derivatives, which were copolymerized in different combinations leading to crosslinked materials with a tunable Tg.342 The copolymerization of FAlc glycidyl ether with highly hydrophilic poly(glyceryl glycerol ether) results in unimolecular star-shaped micelles with good nifuratel encapsulation, suitable for use as injectable self-healable hydrogel platforms for gynecological therapy.343 The combination of furan resin with DGEBA results in a completely miscible blend, which can be cured by diethylenetriamine under solvent-free conditions, leading to thermosets with significantly improved mechanical properties compared to neat resins.344
Oxiran rings in the diglycidyl esters of FDCA and bifuroic diacid can be opened by the reaction with methacrylic acid, resulting in novel bioderived resins with high reactivity toward radical cross-linking, including being mixed with methacrylated eugenol.345 UV-curable coatings with excellent self-healing, repairable and remodeling abilities were prepared from furoic acid and glycidyl-containing derivatives of methacrylic and itaconic acids.346 A series of branched polyesters with increased Tg and stiffness were synthesized from FDCA, itaconic acid and two isomeric propane diols, with the good life-cycle assessment of the prepared thermosets.347 Allylic esters of FDCA and 5,5′-oxybis(methylene)bis[furan-2-carboxylate] were used as crosslinking agents for the modification of polyacrylate, polymethacrylate and polystyrene matrices via free-radical solution copolymerization, resulting in materials with high metal and excellent water adsorption capacities.348 UV-initiated thiol-ene click crosslinking of diallyl FDCA ester with different polythiols leads to a series of hydrolysable materials with variable softness/stiffness.349
The aforementioned bis(furanic)-bis(carboxy)-cyclobutane, synthesized from furfural and malonic acid, was polymerized with glycerol, leading to a wholly renewable material with good thermal stability.350 The application of FDCA for crosslinking of amine-decorated carbohydrate chitosan by amide bond formation resulted in novel materials with a high Cu2+ ion uptake and anti-inflammatory activity, which can be suitable for the removal of metal impurities and biomedical applications.351 Another sustainable novolac-type resin was prepared using a one-pot reaction of HMF, derived in situ from glucose, with phenol. The resulting void- and formaldehyde-free materials exhibited good heat resistance and mechanical performance.352
Few reports are devoted to furan vitrimers – a fascinating class of polymer materials that make the link between historically opposed 3D networks (thermosets) and linear polymers (thermoplastics) due to the possibility of intermolecular bond rearrangement (Fig. 10).353 BHMF was used for the preparation of self-healing vitrimers with shape memory by mechanochemical polycondensation with HG, meso-erythritol and 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (Fig. 8II).354 Nonisocyanate synthesis of branched poly(ester-urethane)s from FDCA and hydroxyl urethane tetraols with different chain lengths leads to functional materials with satisfactory thermal stability and vitrimer-like behavior.355 Additionally, the first bio-based polyimine vitrimers were prepared from DFF and dimeric/trimeric amines and have demonstrated fast stress relaxation at RT, tunable mechanical properties and good reprocessability without the loss of these properties.356,357

Despite the fact that metal–organic frameworks cannot be considered true organic polymers, we should mention a number of studies in which FDCA and furoic acid were used as ligands, which allows the preparation of MOFs with different applications from photocatalytic/photosensitive/luminescent activity to single-molecular magnets and metal ion detectors.358–366 Finally, it was demonstrated that humins, usually regarded as a waste and the product of furans and carbohydrate tarring, can also be considered a new class of thermoset materials and composite matrices.367
Composite materials
The furan resins most commonly used for composite preparation are BOx and pBOx, and this evidence is clearly correlated with the overall ratio of articles for different classes of polymers. These reports are briefly summarized in Table 4.

The reinforcement of FAlc resins with various fillers allows obtaining high-performance materials with desired properties. The mechanical properties, chemical and thermal stabilities, thermal conductivity and flame retardancy can be tuned by the addition of an organically modified woven glass fiber and talc filler368 or organically modified glass microspheres.369 Fully bio-based composites can be prepared by furan resin copolymerization with tung oil and bacterial cellulose fibers370 or by compression forming with bamboo culms, resulting in construction materials with a remarkable compressive strength and excellent recovery characteristics.371 The reinforcement of FAlc resin with the melamine foam leads to a composite suitable for use as a highly efficient absorbent for oil–water separation due to its excellent sorption capacities for various oils and organic solvents and high recycling abilities.372 The co-curing of furan resin and DGEBA with methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride as a hardener and basalt fibers as a filler results in a composite with excellent acid resistance.373
BHMF diglycidyl ether can be cured by methyl nadic anhydride with the addition of either TiO2374 or silica NPs.375 Both materials can be used as protective coatings, since the former composite demonstrated improved anti-corrosion performance, hardness and adhesion to the substrate, while the latter exhibited low thermal conductivity and decreased smoke parameters. The use of 10,10′-oxybisphenoxarsine as a curing agent accompanied by a graphene additive as the filler results in stable π–π conjugated hard graphene suspensions with significantly increased mechanical and thermal properties and water contact angles (Fig. 8III).376
Finally, the furan analog of DGEBA can be synthesized by the condensation of FAlc with acetone with subsequent diglycidation with epichlorohydrin. The reinforcement of this epoxy resin with graphene oxide leads to composites with superior mechanical and thermal properties.377
Conclusions
Here, we emphasize that recent advances in the field of sustainable materials science based on furanic monomers have led to the production of a wide range of new polymers, blends and composites, which are superior in their properties to those materials that are now widely used in very different areas: packaging and coatings, self-healing materials and thermoplastics, biodegradable, bioactive, conductive materials and shape-memory polymers. Considering various classes of furanic polymers, we can make a conclusion about the presence of dominant directions of development in the field of both linear materials and their branched analogues (Fig. 11). The main direction in the development of linear polymers is the search for sustainable analogues of PET, primarily to replace this non-renewable material in the field of packaging. Meanwhile, the field of cross-linked polymers is annually enriched with a significant number of studies on the synthesis of furanic polybenzoxazines – a novel promising class of polymeric materials with high thermal stability and flame retardancy, not yet managed to fully conquer their industrial niche, and therefore do not have problems with the need to restructure existing technologies from petroleum-based ones to sustainable ones.
 Fig. 11  Distributions of potential applications for the articles devoted to the study of different types of furan-based polymers (for the covered period of 2017–2022). 
Despite the huge progress in sustainable materials science achieved to date, there are still several problems in this area that have yet to be solved. The main problem is the huge gap between the availability and the price of renewable and nonrenewable monomers. As described above, furanic polymers often outperform large-capacity petroleum-based materials such as PET, BPA, epoxy and acrylic resins in some physical and chemical parameters. However, despite the superior properties of renewables, their widespread introduction into long established industries is very difficult due to the necessity of full restructuring for production and supply technologies.
Only through a conscious movement towards a sustainable economy and the widespread introduction of sustainable technologies and materials into different areas of life green polymers will turn from a promising concept into a reality around us. With each passing year, the reality of such a replacement seems more and more obvious, and now the task of every chemist and technologist in the field of sustainable chemistry is to bring this moment closer.
