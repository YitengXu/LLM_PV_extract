    , Accepted 15th May 2017First published on 30th May 2017AbstractTernary conjugated D–A copolymers are designed and synthesized by using indenothiophene and benzodithiophene as the weak and the strong donors, respectively, and fluorinated benzodithiazole as the strong acceptor. The best performance copolymer delivers a high PCE of 9.08%, which is a record efficiency for ternary conjugated D–A copolymers reported to date.
The last decade has witnessed significant breakthroughs of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers, which led to single-junction polymer solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10%.1–5 Different from homopolymers such as P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)), typical D–A copolymers consist of one electron donating unit and one electron withdrawing unit. The bandgaps as well as energy levels of D–A copolymers can be tuned through molecular engineering of the donor and acceptor units separately.1–6 At the same time, the resulting push–pull nature along the polymer backbone would help in an efficient intramolecular charge transfer.2 Therefore, over the past decade, a large number of electron donating units and electron withdrawing units have been developed for efficient binary D–A copolymers.1–3 For example, one of the benchmark binary D–A copolymers is PTB7, which incorporates the electron-donating benzodithiophene unit as the donor and the electron-withdrawing thienothiophene unit as the acceptor. In combination with PC71BM, the PTB7-based PSCs exhibited a PCE of 7.2%, a record efficiency at that time.7 Through further interface and device engineering, a PCE over 10% was achieved for PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM.8 Another example of efficient binary D–A copolymers was reported by Yan et al. where terthiophene and benzothiadiazole derivatives were incorporated into the binary D–A polymer backbone as electron-donating and electron-withdrawing units, respectively, leading to PSCs with PCEs over 11%.9 So far, binary conjugated D–A polymers which contain only one donor–acceptor pair, are dominating p-type semiconductors for PSCs.1–3 Ternary conjugated D–A copolymers (or called as tercopolymer) which have either two donors with one acceptor or two acceptors with one donor (two donor–acceptor pairs), are more or less neglected in the past decade although they have also been demonstrated to possess decent optoelectronic properties with more sophisticated structures.10–14 For example, Bazan et al. reported a conjugated copolymer (PIPCP) with the D–A–D′–A structured backbone where cyclopentadithiophene and indacenodithiophene are two different electron donating units, and thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine is an electron deficient unit. The regioregular PIPCP exhibited the best PCE of 6.13% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V.12 Considering a large number of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing units developed for PSCs in the past decade, the design strategy in going from binary to ternary conjugated D–A copolymers may lead to even more efficient D–A copolymers. Furthermore, the bandgaps as well as the energy levels of ternary conjugated copolymers can be fine tuned or optimized with the combination of one weak donor with one strong donor, or the combination of one weak acceptor with one strong acceptor.
In this context, we report the design and synthesis of two ternary conjugated D–A copolymers using indenothiophene (bridged by a thiophene) and benzodithiophene as the weak and the strong donors, respectively, and using fluorinated benzothiadiazole as the strong acceptor (Scheme 1). The best performance ternary conjugated copolymer (PBIBD-T in Scheme 1) exhibits a high PCE of 9.08% with a VOC of 0.884 V. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is the highest for all ternary conjugated D–A copolymers reported in the literature. Furthermore, the structure–property and morphology-performance relationships of the ternary conjugated D–A copolymers are investigated in detail.
 Scheme 1  The design strategy for ternary conjugated D–A copolymers. 
The key intermediate for the synthesis of the copolymers is the A–D–A structured building block (1), which was synthesized by Stille cross coupling between the trimethylstannylated indenothiophene (IT-Sn)15 and brominated benzothiadiazole (BT) (Scheme 2). Control over the structure of the intermediate was achieved owing to the preferential reaction of the Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling at the meta-position to the fluorine atom on the BT unit. The asymmetric reactivity afforded the A–D–A intermediate 1 in 85% yield. The proposed chemical structure was confirmed by 2D NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). The nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum shows that the proton in the fluorinated BT is in close proximity to the proton in the indenothiophene fragment. Compounds 1 and 2 were subsequently polymerized using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst to yield the target PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T in 63% and 77% yields, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the backbone structures of both copolymers are not defined due to the asymmetric monomer (compound 1). Both copolymers were purified by a series of Soxhlet extractions and obtained as black solids. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of both copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T have Mns of 14.0 and 21.9 kDa, with similar PDIs of 1.74 and 1.78, respectively. Both copolymers exhibit good solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene at room temperature in concentrations higher than 10 mg mL−1. As shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), a random structural isomer of PBIBD-T was prepared for comparison purpose through the one-step Stille coupling reaction between IT-Sn (1 equivalent), compound 2 (1 equivalent) and the brominated BT (2 equivalents). However, the random PBIBD-T has a much lower Mn of 3.1 kDa (PDI of 1.78) in comparison with the more regioregular PBIBD-T (Mn = 21.9 kDa) obtained according to the synthetic route shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of ternary conjugated D–A copolymers PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two copolymers in chlorobenzene solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 1a. Similar to binary conjugated D–A copolymers, both copolymers exhibit one low-energy and one high-energy absorption bands corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer and the localized π–π* transition, respectively. From solution to thin film, the absorption maxima of the copolymers bathochromically shift 45–49 nm, which can be a result of solid-state packing-induced conformational change into a more coplanar polymer backbone. The absorption edges of PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T in thin film are at 718 and 722 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.73 and 1.72 eV, respectively. In both solution and thin film, PBIBD-T shows red-shifted absorption maxima in comparison with PBIBD-O due to the incorporation of two dimensional thiophene groups into the benzodithiophene unit. In solution, PBIBD-O exhibits slightly stronger absorption per repeat unit in comparison with PBIBD-T (Fig. S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) Normalized absorption spectra of the copolymers in solution and in thin film; (b) cyclic voltammogram of the copolymer thin films. 
To estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, i.e. ionization potential) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, i.e. electron affinity) energy levels of the copolymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 1b. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBIBD-O are calculated to be −5.43 and −3.77 eV, respectively. Similarly, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBIBD-T are calculated to be −5.46 and −3.73 eV, respectively. One may find that the introduction of two substituted thienyl groups leads to a slightly deeper-lying HOMO level, which is similar to the finding in the binary D–A copolymers reported by us previously.16 It should be noted that the VOC of a PSC is related to the energy level difference between the HOMO of a donor material and the LUMO of an acceptor material. Therefore, the PBIBD-T-based device would exhibit a higher VOC compared to the PBIBD-O-based counterpart.
Conventional PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM (1:2.2, w/w)/PDIN/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and PDIN are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrenesulfonate and 2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) anthrax[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10 (2H, 9H)-tetraone,17 respectively. Diphenyl ether (DPE) was used as a solvent additive to tune the morphology of the active layer. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices were measured under the simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. Without any additive, PBIBD-T afforded a PCE of 6.63% with a high VOC of 0.888 V, a JSC of 12.00 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62.2%. PBIBD-O, on the other hand, afforded a PCE of 3.84% with a VOC of 0.852 V, a JSC of 8.10 mA cm−2, and a FF of 55.7%. The decreased VOC and JSC values in going from PBIBD-O to PBIBD-T are in part attributed to the increased HOMO energy level and the blue-shifted absorption band of PBIBD-O, respectively. It was found that the DPE additive has pronounced effect on the device performance. With 2% DPE, PBIBD-O-based PSCs exhibited a PCE of 5.90% with a VOC of 0.855 V, a JSC of 12.94 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.3%. Similarly, with 2% DPE, the PBIBD-T-based device showed an increased PCE of 9.08% with a VOC of 0.884 V, a JSC of 15.38 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.8%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 9.08% is the highest for any ternary conjugated D–A copolymers reported to date. It should be noted here that the best performance PSC based on the random PBIBD-T (Mn = 3.1 kDa) exhibited a much lower PCE of 1.88% with a VOC of 0.830 V, a JSC of 5.42 mA cm−2, and a FF of 41.5% (Fig. S3, ESI†).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the best performance devices based on PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T are depicted in Fig. 2b. All the devices show a broad spectral response in the wavelength range of 300–720 nm, which is generally in agreement with the corresponding absorption spectra. For both copolymers, the EQE responses of the devices with DPE are 20–50% greater than those of the devices without any additive. These EQE results are in agreement with the corresponding JSC values of the devices. For example, for the device based on PBIBD-T (2% DPE) with a measured PCE of 9.08%, the calculated JSC is 15.27 mA cm−2, only slightly lower than the measured JSC of 15.38 mA cm−2.
To understand the effect of additive on the active layer and the resulting photovoltaic performance, the morphologies of the active layers were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the obtained AFM images are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, clear phase separation is observed for both copolymers with or without DPE. Furthermore, obvious morphological changes are found for both copolymers when DPE was added. Without DPE additive, apparent aggregates with large sized domains were observed for both copolymers. PBIBD-O:PC71BM with DPE exhibits a smaller phase-separated domain size of 10–20 nm compared to the counterpart without DPE. In consideration of the exciton diffusion length of ∼10 nm, the 10–20 nm domain size of PBIBD-O:PC71BM is beneficial for efficient charge separation and transport. Furthermore, by adding DPE, the PBIBD-T:PC71BM blend formed nanoscale fibril features where a bicontinuous interpenetrating network may be formed in the blend film. The fibrillar structures may help to enhance the carrier mobility, FF, JSC and the resulting PCE of PSCs. From AFM topography images, the morphology change with DPE is also evident. For example, the additive-free PBIBD-O:PC71BM exhibits an average roughness value of 3.69 nm due to the formation of large sized aggregates. However, the PBIBD-O:PC71BM blend with DPE shows a decreased average roughness value of 1.01 nm. Similarly, a slightly decreased average roughness value of 3.20 nm is observed for PBIBD-T:PC71BM with DPE compared to PBIBD-T:PC71BM without DPE (3.74 nm). This morphology difference between the blend films with and without DPE is one of the main reasons for the photovoltaic performance variation of the PSCs listed in Table 1.

The molecular packing and crystallinity of the pure copolymer film and blended films with and without DPE were investigated by Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The 2D GIWAXS patterns of the spin-coated films are shown in Fig. 4a–f and the corresponding 1D line-cuts in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are shown in Fig. 4g. The two pure films show lamellar (100) peaks and π–π stacking (010) peaks in the both in-plane and out-of-plane directions, while the PBIBD-O film presents a sharp (010) peak with a slightly larger coherence length (CL) of 26.01 Å in comparison with the PBIBD-T film (23.94 Å) according to 1D line-cut fitting data. An obvious difference in d-spacing in the (100) direction is found for the two copolymers which is ascribed to the different lengths of the side chain on the benzodithiophene core. The π–π stacking distances of pure PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T films are determined to be 3.70 and 3.76 Å, respectively, according to the (010) diffraction in the out-of-plane direction. As the pure PBIBD-T film shows stronger diffraction signals in the out-of-plane direction in comparison to the in-plane direction, it could be deduced that the PBIBD-T polymer molecules are predominantly arranged with the face-on structure in the pure film. As for the blend films, the line-cuts of four blends are generally similar. However, much more apparent and pointed π–π stacking peaks emerge for the polymer blends with the DPE additive in comparison with those without DPE. The PBIBD-T:PC71BM film shows the (010) peak at q = 1.83 Å−1 (π–π stacking distance of 3.43 Å) with a CL of 12.46 Å slightly lower than that for the PBIBD-O:PC71BM blend (q = 1.83 Å−1 and CL = 13.80 Å). With 2% DPE, the PBIBD-T blend exhibited the (010) peak at q = 1.74 Å−1 with a CL of 37.68 Å, and the PBIBD-O blend showed the (010) peak at q = 1.71 Å−1 with a CL of 35.36 Å, all of which firmly demonstrated the greatly enhanced crystallinity of both copolymer blends with DPE. Therefore, the JSC values were apparently improved for both polymer blends with 2% DPE due to the high crystallinity which explains the better photovoltaic performance. However, we noticed that the FF of the PBIBD-O:PC71BM-based device decreased slightly with 2% DPE which might be related to the increased thickness of the active layer (69 versus 91 nm)18 as well as a reduced domain purity which will be discussed later.

At the same time, the characteristic phase separation length scale and relative average domain purity of the polymer blends with or without DPE were investigated by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS). The scattering profiles were acquired at the photon energy of 284.2 eV and Lorentz-corrected R-SoXS scattering data (Iavgq2) are plotted against the scattering vector q (Fig. 5). The scattering profiles can be fitted by log-normal distributions and characteristic phase separation length scale ξ can be obtained using the equation of ξ = 2π/qmode. At the same time, the relative average domain purity can be evaluated by calculating the total scattering intensity through the integration of the scattering profiles over the q range and taking the film thickness into account.19 As shown in Fig. 5, for the copolymer blends without DPE, two strong peaks with smaller q-values are observed, in which the peaks with a lower q value are related to surface roughness by comparison with scattering profiles at 270 eV. Meanwhile, phase separation was presented by the peaks with a higher q value, which correspond to domain sizes of 65.9 nm for the PBIBD-T blend and 91.8 nm for the PBIBD-O system, much larger than the exciton diffusion length of 10 nm. At the same time, these polymer blends without DPE exhibit relatively high average domain purity as evidenced by the higher intensity compared to those with DPE. For the phase separation of organic photovoltaics, a large domain size with high purity leads to a decrease of the D/A interfacial area, at which excitons could thoroughly separate. Consequently, these two copolymer blends have poor performance due to insufficient D/A interface. Interestingly, the PBIBD-T blend without DPE has a smaller domain size with relatively low average domain purity, in comparison with the PBIBD-O blend, which is in agreement with the better photovoltaic performance of the former one. However, the domain size and relative average domain purity of both polymer blends with DPE decrease significantly, which is helpful for a more efficient diffusion of excitons. Furthermore, with DPE, the domain sizes of both PBIBD-T:PC71BM and PBIBD-O:PC71BM decrease to 27.3 nm and 26.1 nm, respectively. Although the domain sizes are slightly higher than the ideal exciton diffusion length, sufficient D/A interface emerged because of low domain purity, which is beneficial for charge transport and charge separation, in comparison with no additive blends. As for PBIBD-T:PC71BM with DPE versusPBIBD-O:PC71BM with DPE, the high average domain purity is beneficial for charge transport and reducing bimolecular recombination, which is in accordance with the higher PCE for PBIBD-T:PC71BM. Also, the R-SoXS data are in good agreement with the observations from the AFM images. The AFM images in Fig. 3 clearly demonstrate the formation of large-size aggregated domains for both copolymer blends without DPE.

To determine the effect of the DPE additive on the active layer, we measured the charge transport properties of the blend films by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobilities of copolymer:PC71BM blends with and without DPE were investigated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Au, the J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices under dark conditions are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). For the additive-free devices, the hole mobilities of PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T are determined to be 3.4 × 10−6 and 8.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, with DPE, the hole mobility of PBIBD-O and PBIBD-T increased to 1.3 × 10−5 and 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The increased hole mobility for the active layer with DPE can be attributed to the improved morphology as demonstrated previously. This observation is also consistent with the corresponding PCE changes shown in Table 1. Around 2–3 times higher hole mobility of the polymer blends with DPE compared to the additive-free blends is one of the main reasons for the enhanced JSC of the corresponding devices.
In summary, two novel ternary conjugated D–A copolymers using the indenothiophene and benzodithiophene as the weak and the strong donor units, respectively, have been designed and synthesized. A high PCE of 9.08% with a VOC of 0.884 V has been achieved for the best performance ternary conjugated copolymer, PBIBD-T, which outperforms its random ternary conjugated counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 9.08% is the highest for all ternary conjugated D–A copolymers reported to date. These findings and detailed studies provide an important guidance to design and synthesize high performance ternary conjugated D–A copolymers.
