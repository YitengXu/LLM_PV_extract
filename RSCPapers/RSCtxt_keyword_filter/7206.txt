    , Accepted 17th February 2017First published on 17th February 2017AbstractA high quality thick (500 nm) CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber with a horizontal grain size up to 3 μm and a lateral size equal to the film thickness was prepared by the synergistic effect of a H2O additive and DMF vapor treatment via a two-step spin coating method. The inverted (p–i–n) cell based on this high-quality thick perovskite film achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 20.1%. The cell shows no current hysteresis and is stable in inert and ambient atmospheres with appropriate encapsulation. H2O helps MAI to penetrate into the thick PbI2 to form a thick film with a pure MAPbI3 phase and produces bigger gains by slowing down the perovskite crystallization rate. It can also cooperate with DMF to control the dissolution of perovskite grains during DMF vapor post treatment. As a result, large multi-crystalline perovskite grains without observable holes and creases are formed when DMF and H2O were removed during the following heating process. The synergistic effect of H2O and DMF was evidenced by SEM images and GIWXRD patterns taken simultaneously. This synergistic strategy for preparing a high-quality, thick perovskite film was extended to fabricate a large-area MAPbI3 film (1.3 cm2 and 11.25 cm2 for the cell and mini-module, respectively) to realize an efficiency of 16.7 and 15.4%.

Broader context
The synergistic effect of H2O and DMF was used to prepare a high quality, thick MAPbI3 film via a two-step spin-coating method. The best p–i–n perovskite cell based on the MAPbI3 film achieved a very high efficiency of 20.1% and was stable both in an inert atmosphere and air after appropriate encapsulation. The same perovskite film preparation strategy was used to fabricate a large area film for a perovskite mini-module with an active area of 11.25 cm2 to realize an efficiency over 15%.

Perovskite solar cells have huge commercial attraction due to their high efficiency and solution process using cheap materials.1–15 Perovskite solar cells have two major configurations: n–i–p (mesoscopic or planar) and p–i–n (inverted planar) architectures. The record-high efficiency2 perovskite solar cell is a n–i–p mesoscopic device. However, compared to n–i–p mesoscopic cells, inverted p–i–n cells can be fabricated at relatively low-temperatures (<100 °C). One of the advantages of a low-temperature fabrication process is that it can be adopted in roll-to-roll production of flexible devices for a wide range of applications. Nevertheless, so far the highest Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) for a p–i–n device16,17 is lower than that for an n–i–p cell.18 This may be due to the fact that it is difficult to fabricate a highly flat, full coverage, thick perovskite film composed of large (>2 μm) multi-crystalline grains on top of the smooth PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer with the methods reported in the literature.19
Snaith13et al. demonstrated that the morphology (such as grain size, defect, continuity, and flatness) rather than the crystallinity of the perovskite film is the most important parameter for the photovoltaic performance in a p–i–n perovskite solar cell. The boundaries of the multi-crystalline grains and the defects within the grain are proposed to be the imperfections of the perovskite film, which cause energy loss via non-radiative recombination, and therefore decrease the efficiency of the corresponding cell.20,21 Several methods were used to improve the morphology of the perovskite film and among them, adding an additive in the precursor solution(s) is one of the most effective strategies. The concept of an additive, which is widely used in bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs),22–26 was applied successfully to grow high-quality perovskite films to improve their photovoltaic performance.27–42 The function of most additives is to slow-down the crystallization rate of perovskite to form a continuous film with big multi-crystalline grains (and/or a large crystalline domain).43 Furthermore, the post-treatment on the compound semiconductor, such as CdTe44 and CuInS245 films, can induce the recrystallization of the films to form bigger grains, thus significantly improving the film quality and the efficiency of the corresponding solar cell. Post vapor treatment has also been demonstrated to be a way to increase the grain size and therefore enhance the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite film.46–48
Recently, we have reported the use of H2O as an additive in PbI2/DMF precursor solution to prepare a full coverage, good quality PbI2 film on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO. A high-quality MAPbI3 film was then formed by adding MAI/IPA on top of PbI2 using a two-step spin coating method. The resulting inverted cell reaches a very high efficiency of 18% with a remarkable high fill factor of 0.85.17 Compared to the high-efficiency n–i–p cell, our p–i–n device has a higher FF but a lower Jsc value. It may be due to the active perovskite film which is not thick enough. To increase further the efficiency of the inverted perovskite cell, a strategy for preparing a high-quality, thick perovskite film is necessary. In this paper, we report on how to combine a H2O additive and DMF vapor treatment to prepare a 500 nm-thick perovskite film with large grains and a very smooth surface. The corresponding inverted cell achieves a maximum efficiency exceeding 20% and is stable, when appropriately encapsulated, even in ambient atmosphere under room lighting. Furthermore, using the synergistic effect of H2O and DMF, a good quality, large area (11.25 cm2) MAPbI3 film was prepared for a perovskite mini-module to realize a PCE over 15%.
A two-step spin-coating method11 was used to fabricate the perovskite film reported in this paper: the PbI2 film was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS and then MAI/IPA was added via spin-coating followed by thermal annealing to form perovskite. A full-coverage, high-quality PbI2 film on PEDOT:PSS was prepared by using a H2O additive in PbI2/DMF precursor solution in the first step.17 The second-step for adding MAI to PbI2 is also very critical for preparing a high-quality, thick MAPbI3 film to achieve high photovoltaic performance. Not only the spin programs, and the concentration and quantity of MAI/IPA solution but also the humidity and temperature of the reaction environment will affect the reproducibility and photovoltaic performance of the resulting films. In particular, the humidity of the ambient atmosphere is important, since it is known that water can decompose perovskite by extracting MAI out of MAPbI3 (forming MAI(aq))49 leaving PbI2 solid (we found50 that the remaining PbI2 is also soluble in H2O slowly). Nevertheless, water can also assist to grow bigger perovskite grains through a not well-known mechanism.6,51,52 We found that the quality of the thick (>400 nm) MAPbI3 film prepared with the two-step method is not so reproducible when the humidity of the environment and reagents (PbI2, MAI, DMF and IPA) were not controlled. Unreacted PbI2 was detected sometimes in the thick film even when the reaction conditions are the same except the humidity of the environment is relatively low (in the dry season). It seems that the moisture is one of the key components for preparing high quality, thick MAPbI3 films. Therefore, instead of maintaining carefully the moisture of the environment, we added a controllable amount of water also in MAI/IPA precursor solution. A thick (>400 nm) MAPbI3 film with a pure phase was fabricated when a suitable amount of water was added into both the PbI2/DMF and MAI/IPA solutions.
GIWXRD patterns of Psk-X (Psk-X represents the MAPbI3 film prepared from MAI/IPA solution containing X vol% (vs. dried IPA) of H2O additive) are illustrated in Fig. S1 of the ESI† and the corresponding crystallinity and crystalline domain size estimated from the line-broadening using Scherrer's equation are listed in Table S1, ESI.† GIWXRD patterns of all H2O added films show only seven characteristic peaks occurring at 2θ from 10 to 35 degree, belonging to the tetragonal phase of perovskite suggesting the formation of the pure MAPbI3 phase.14,53,54 The weak diffraction peak at 2θ of 12.4° for the Psk-0 film comes from the unreacted PbI2. The crystallinity of the films increases as the water content increases, however, the crystalline domain size of Psk-1.0 is close to that of Psk-0.1 and smaller than that of Psk-0.5 (see Table S1, ESI†). A suitable amount of H2O additive in MAI/IPA solution can increase both the crystallinity and crystalline domain size but excess H2O will reduce the crystalline domain size of the resulting perovskite film. SEM images of Psk-X films displayed in Fig. 1 reveal that the grain size of the perovskite film increases as the amount of H2O additive in MAI/IPA increases, consistent with the GIWXRD data. Comparing the crystalline domain size (Table S1, ESI†) calculated from the GIWAX patterns and the grain size from the SEM images (Fig. 1), it was revealed that perovskite grains of the film are multi-crystalline particles. MAPbI3 films are also continuous and fully covered on PEDOT:PSS when the water content in MAI/IPA is less than 1 vol%. Nevertheless, when the H2O additive is equal to 1.0 vol%, some holes on the film and lots of very small particles dispersed on top of the big grains are observed. The perovskite film with the best quality (largest grains with a very smooth surface and no holes) was obtained when the concentration of H2O in MAI/IPA is 0.5 vol%. Furthermore the thickness of all the Psk-X films is similar at ∼500 nm. The small amount of water in the films did not affect their thickness. The UV/Vis absorption spectra displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†) reveal that the absorption intensities of the Psk-X films in the visible light range are also almost the same. Therefore the effect of the film thickness on the variation of the photovoltaic performance can be ruled out.

Inverted cells with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Psk-X/PCBM/Ca/Al architecture were fabricated via spin coating a PCBM film, solvent annealing the active layers and employing a Ca/Al electrode using thermal evaporation. The photovoltaic parameters of the D-X cells (cells based on Psk-X films) are listed in Table 1 and the origin of the I–V curves is displayed in Fig. S3, ESI.† Data in Table 1 show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells is closely related to the morphology, especially the grain size and defects/holes, of the perovskite films. In general, a perovskite film containing larger grains has better photovoltaic performance (certainly the presence of PbI2 also decreases the efficiency of the D-0 cell). However, the PCE of D-1.0 is lower than that of D-0.1 even Psk-1.0 contains larger grains (see Fig. 1) with higher crystalline domain size and crystallinity (see Table S1, ESI†) compared to the Psk-0.1 film. This is due to the holes and sparsely dispersed small particles (on the grains) on the Psk-1.0 film causing current leakage which was proved by the I–V curves (under dark) of D-0.1 and D-1.0 cells displayed in Fig. S4, ESI.† Without illumination, the dark current of D-1.0 is higher than that of D-0.1, which decreases all the photovoltaic parameters especially the FF value of the D-1.0 cell, resulting in low efficiency. Overall, the D-0.5 cell using the Psk-0.5 film as an absorber has the highest PCE of 18.33%. SEM, XRD, and PCE data together suggest that there are two possible routes, increasing the grain size and reducing the defects (holes and small particles) of the film, to further elevate the photovoltaic performance of MAPbI3.

The PCE of the best performance cell (D-0.5) is ca. 18%, although the Psk-0.5 film is a thick film without defects, the grain sizes of the film are inhomogeneous with very few grains with sizes up to 1 μm. It is known46,55 that post-synthesis treatment is a way to self-repair a perovskite film to form larger grains with fewer defects. Therefore after MAI/IPA/H2O was spin-coated on PbI2, before heating, a DMF vapor treatment was performed at 60 °C for 10 min. The SEM images of the VPsk-X (VPsk-X means DMF vapor treated Psk-X) films are shown in Fig. 2. Compared to the morphology of the Psk-X films displayed in Fig. 1, DMF vapor annealing can enlarge the grain size of all films but there are still holes on some grains of the VPsk-1.0 film. The grain size of VPsk-0.5 enlarges up to 3 μm with a very smooth surface (no holes or creases were observed at the magnification of 100000). The SEM cross-section images of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/VPsk-0.5 film displayed in Fig. 3 reveal that the VPsk-0.5 film is very dense with the height (the thickness of the lateral direction) of the grains equal to the thickness of the film. The uniformity of the VPsk-0.5 film increases to several micrometers as shown in the SEM image displayed in Fig. 3(b). The thickness of the film estimated from the cross-section image is ca. 500 nm which is close to that measured by using a surface profile-meter. It is also similar to the thickness of the Psk-X films, suggesting that DMF solvent annealing will not change considerably (SEM and surface profile-meter) the thickness of the perovskite film. The size of the perovskite grains being equal to the thickness of the film provides a facile pathway for the carriers to travel with less resistance for both hole and electron transporting layers to achieve high efficiency as observed in our previous study.17

GIWXRD data (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†) of the VPsk-X films reveal that both the crystallinity and crystalline domain size of all MAPbI3 films increase after DMF vapor treatment. The photovoltaic parameters of the VD-X cells (VD-X means the p–i–n perovskite cell based on the VPsk-X film) with the highest and average (based on 35 cells) efficiencies are summarized in Table 2 and the I–V curves of the highest efficiency VD–X cells are displayed in Fig. S6, ESI.† The efficiency of all cells based on DMF vapor treated perovskite absorbers increases but the PCE of VD-1.0 is much lower than that of VD-0.5 even though VPsk-1.0 and VPsk-0.5 have similar grain size, crystallinity and crystalline domain size. VD-1.0 also has a PCE lower than VD-0.1 even though the grain size, crystallinity and crystalline domain size of the VPsk-1.0 film are all larger than those of the VPsk-0.1 film. On the other hand, both the VPsk-0 and VPsk-0.1 films have no observable holes within the grains and their crystallinity and crystalline domain size are also very close. Nevertheless, the PCE of VD-0.1 is significantly higher than that of VD-0 due to the VPsk-0.1 film being composed of larger grains. These data further confirmed that the grain sizes and the defects (the holes or creases within the grains and grain boundaries) of the perovskite film have a huge impact on its photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, all the photovoltaic parameters increase for the cell based on the DMF vapor treated film (see Tables 1 and 2) suggesting that larger perovskite grains not only have a few grain boundaries but also form better HTL/perovskite/ETL interphase contact. VPsk-0.5 has grain size up to 3 μm and no observable holes or creases within the grain therefore the best VD-0.5 cell exhibits a remarkably high efficiency of 20.1% with a high FF of 0.83. The histograms of the efficiency based on 35 VD-0.5 cells fabricated from several batches are illustrated in Fig. S7, ESI.† The maximum derivation in PCE is only 2.5%, suggesting that the high-efficiency cells are quite reproducible.

The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are related to the resistance of the cell (including the contact resistance and bulk resistance of the absorber as well as the interface resistance) and the carrier recombination at the interfaces of the device, respectively. Rs and Rsh estimated from the slopes of I–V curves under the open circuit and the short circuit conditions, respectively, of the highest efficiency cells (prepared with various DMF treating times) are also listed in Table 2. The highest efficiency VD-0.5 cell has a very low series resistance of 1.85 Ω cm2 and an extremely high shunt resistance of 71430 Ω cm2. It was proposed56 that the charges in the perovskite material are predominantly present as free electrons and holes, rather than as bound excitons. Therefore, small Rs suggests that the inter-particle contact resistance is small, the conductivity within the perovskite grains is high, and the perovskite has good contact with both the electron and hole transporting layers, resulting in a high FF. Whereas large shunt resistance implies that the carrier recombination at the interfaces is small, resulting in high Jsc and Voc values. Compared to the VD-0.1 cell, the VD-1.0 cell has higher Rs and much lower Rsh suggesting that the holes on the VPsk-1.0 film not only have high resistance but also induce serious short-circuiting in the VD-1.0 cell, resulting in low efficiency.
The IPCE curve, reflective absorption, and internal quantum efficiency spectra of the VD-0.5 cell with a PCE of 20.1% are displayed in Fig. 4. The IPCE value is above 85% from 440 nm to 750 nm and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE, estimated by dividing the EQE by the reflective absorption as reported by K. Xiao57et al.) is almost 100%, indicating that the cell has very small charge recombination.58 The devices also have a Jsc value obtained by the I–V measurement that matches well with the Jsc integrated from the IPCE curve. It is notable that the cell has not only a high Jsc but also a high FF of 0.83 which is close to that of the multi-crystalline GaAs cell with a total area of 4.01 cm2.59 We believe that a high quality and thick perovskite absorber is the key parameter for achieving such high PCE and FF values. Compared to the photovoltaic parameters of the high-efficiency p–i–n cell we reported previously,17 the highest-efficiency cell reported in this paper achieves the higher Jsc value (although slightly lower FF). The larger Jsc values of the cell is due to the fact that a thicker (500 nm vs. 410 nm reported previously17) high quality perovskite film was used as the absorber in this study. Although VPsk-0.5 is composed of large grains, the grain size is still much smaller than the area of the film, therefore the thicker film has a higher resistance. As a result, the VD-0.5 cell has a lower FF compared to the champion cell we reported previously.17

The long-term stability is also very important for the real application of perovskite solar cells but the highest efficiency regular (n–i–p) cells show poor stability.2,6 The grain size of the active perovskite film also affects significantly the stability of the corresponding inverted cell. For a continuous and no defect film, the cell based on the perovskite film with larger grains shows better stability both in a glove box and in ambient atmosphere.60Fig. 5(a) is the result of the stability test of the VD-0.5 cell (with appropriate encapsulation) both in ambient atmosphere and a nitrogen-filled glove box. The data clearly reveal that the high-efficiency cell is very stable even sitting in air when it was encapsulated (see the Experimental section). The stability of the VD-0.5 cell under continuous irradiation was also tested in the glove box and is displayed in Fig. 5(b). Both Jsc and PCE did not change after soaking in 1 Sun (AM 1.5G) light for 500 s. Perovskite solar cells may show some degree of photocurrent hysteresis at certain voltage scanning rates (sweep delay times) or scan directions, which can be eliminated by using high-quality perovskite films.61,62 The I–V curves (displayed in Fig. S8, ESI†) of our high-efficiency cell (VD-0.5) show almost no current hysteresis in two different directions and scan rates of 0.01–0.5 V s−1. We also tested the stability of the VD-0.5 cell under severe conditions (85 °C, 85% relative humidity) and the changes in the I–V curves are displayed in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The cell cannot withstand such severe conditions even with our encapsulation, therefore the efficiency drops from 20.1% to 1.7% after 5 days. The instability may be due to the intrinsic properties of the perovskite material, the components of the cell and/or the cell packing method. We are working on these issues now.

Furthermore, a large FF is very critical for extending the area of the thin film photovoltaic cell, since FF decreases more seriously (compared to other photovoltaic parameters) when the area of the cell was enlarged. A high-quality perovskite film can be prepared by combining a H2O additive and DMF vapor annealing to realize both high efficiency and high FF of the resulting cell. We have used the same strategy to fabricate a cell with an active area up to 1.3 cm2 and the photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding cells are also listed in Table S2 (ESI†). All photovoltaic parameters of the large area cell decreased only slightly compared to those of cells with a small area (typically 0.1 cm2) except the FF value which drops significantly (10%, see Table S2, ESI†). The large area film is also very homogeneous; we measured the IPCE curves (Fig. S10, ESI†) at 5 points of the 1.3 cm2 cell and the difference is less than 5%. Therefore the same method was used to fabricate a MAPbI3 film for the perovskite mini-module using the designed pattern illustrated in Fig. S11, ESI.† The p–i–n perovskite mini-module containing 5 cells (45 mm × 5 mm for each) in a series circuit having the designated illumination area (da) of 11.25 cm2 exhibits a high PCE of more than 15% and is very reproducible. The histograms of the PCE based on 60 modules are listed in Fig. S12, ESI† and the standard deviation of the efficiency is only 5%.
Xiao54,63et al. also used a two-step method to prepare a perovskite film and heated the film to trigger inter-diffusion between PbI2 and MAI followed by solvent (DMF) annealing to improve the film quality. The resulting perovskite film has a maximum grain size of less than 1 μm, and the height of the grains is smaller than the thickness of the film. Therefore the efficiency of their best cell is only 15.6% with a FF of 80%. The high FF and PCE values of the p–i–n cell reported here are due to a thick perovskite film composed of large grains being used as an absorber which can be prepared by combining the effect of a H2O additive and DMF vapor treatment.
A water additive in MAI/IPA is very important for preparing a high quality, thick (>420 nm)17 film. The results illustrated in the previous paragraphs reveal that a thick film with a pure phase can be prepared by adding H2O in both PbI2/DMF and MAI/IPA solutions but DMF post treatment can help to grow bigger MAPbI3 grains. In this study, perovskite films were prepared by a two-step spin coating method. When a thick perovskite film is required for achieving a high Jsc value, a thick PbI2 film is needed. H2O in MAI/IPA solution can help MAI to penetrate into the PbI2 film to complete the reaction, therefore a pure phase, thick perovskite film was fabricated. However, further enlarging the grain size of the perovskite film to achieve better photovoltaic performance by adding more H2O in MAI/IPA was not successful. SEM images displayed in Fig. 1 disclosed that although the average grain size of the Psk film increases as more H2O was added in MAI/IPA, at the same time small particles (attached on the top of the big grains) and holes on the film were produced. If the small particles could be dissolved and filled the holes, large MAPbI3 grains could be fabricated. DMF is a very strong solvent for organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite. When the dried film was treated with DMF vapor, too much perovskite (even big grains) was dissolved, and small grains were formed after heating. Therefore DMF vapor treatment was performed on the wet perovskite film before heat treatment. A well-controlled amount of H2O in MAI/IPA solution can not only help MAI to penetrate inside the thick PbI2 film to complete the reaction but also protect the grains from dissolving totally in DMF during solvent annealing. As a result large grains with no observable defects were formed upon heating to remove both DMF and H2O. It seems that the synergistic effect of H2O and DMF is the reason that a thick perovskite film containing big grains without observable holes and creases was fabricated.
To understand the synergistic effect of the H2O additive and DMF vapour treatment, the film growing steps were explored with SEM and GIXRD studies simultaneously. The preparation of high-quality perovskite films occurs in roughly 4 steps. First, a high-quality PbI2 film (Fig. 6(a)-i) was coated on PEDOT:PSS via H2O additive in PbI2/DMF solution. In the second step, MAI/IPA containing H2O additive was added on top of the PbI2 film by spin coating. The H2O additive can help MAI to penetrate inside the thick PbI2 film since perovskite can totally but very slowly dissolve in H2O and the dissolving process depends on the amount of water.50 Therefore H2O-rich small particles mixed with perovskite aqueous solution and imperfect (containing lots of rifts) large perovskite grains were formed (see the SEM image in Fig. 6(a)-ii). At this stage, a very weak diffraction peak at 2θ of 12.8° was found in the GIWXRD pattern (Fig. 6(b)), which may belong to the H2O rich particles and not PbI2 or MAPbI3. In the third step, when the H2O-containing film was treated with DMF vapor, DMF may mix with H2O and the rifts of big grains or the surface of the grains on the film surface to form a solvent rich perovskite (since the solubility of perovskite toward the DMF/H2O mixture is not as good as toward pure DMF). Some perovskite may also dissolve in DMF and fill the pin-holes on the grains and grain boundaries. The SEM image displayed in Fig. 6(a)-iii reveals that the grain boundaries became blurred and no small particles were revealed. At this stage, the intensity of the perovskite diffraction peak decreased limitedly and the solvent rich phase enhanced slightly (Fig. 6(b)). In the final (fourth) thermal annealing step, DMF and H2O were removed slowly, and perovskite at the boundaries grows slowly to connect the grains as there exists a mixed solvent. As a result, big (up to 3 μm) perovskite grains were formed (Fig. 6(a)-iv) and the GIWXRD pattern shows that the intensity of the perovskite (110) peak increases significantly, the crystalline domain also expanded and no solvent rich phase was detected. These data clearly suggest that for fabricating high quality (big and continuous grains), thick MAPbI3 films, the synergistic effect of H2O and DMF is necessary, which cannot be achieved by only one remedy. Therefore if one can find a single solvent that has the same property as a H2O/DMF mixture, it could be used as a solvent to anneal the film to form big perovskite grains. The synergistic effect for growing big perovskite grains by H2O additive and DMF vapor post treatment is illustrated in Fig. 7.

The defects/holes inside the perovskite grains may not be revealed by SEM and GIWXRD data. Therefore time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was used to get information regarding the defects (including inside and between the grains) of the film. TR-PL spectra of glass/Psk-0, glass/Psk-0.5, and glass/VPsk-0.5 are presented in Fig. S13, ESI.† The lifetime of the excitons (or charge recommendation rate) can be resolved by fitting the normalized time-dependent photoluminescence using a 2-constant exponential decay function as follows64 and the fitting results are listed in Table 3.IPL = ANRexp(−t/τNR) + ARexp(−t/τR)where ANR is the normalized amplitude of non-radiative exciton annihilation (including the trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination), AR is the normalized amplitude of the radiative monomolecular recombination, τNR is the lifetime of non-radiative exciton annihilation, and τR is the radiative monomolecular recombination lifetime.

The power (25.5 nJ cm−2) of the exciting laser is low; the bimolecular recombination is limited in general. The Psk-0 film has two decay lifetimes of 0.80 ns and 5.56 ns, corresponding to the non-radiative (causing by traps/defects) and radiative decays, respectively. On the other hand, only one quenching process was found for the Psk-0.5 and VPsk-0.5 films with the lifetimes of 102 ns and 154 ns, respectively. This is probably due to the lifetime of the non-radiative decay being close to that of the radiative decay, due to the presence of very few defects or the defects being too few to be detected. Moreover, the-radiative lifetimes of the Psk-0.5 and VPsk-0.5 films are much longer than that of the Psk-0 film. In other words, we do not know the location of the defects within the grains, nevertheless, the TRPL data show that fewer defects exist in Psk-0.5 and VPsk-0.5 compared to the Psk-0 film.
In conclusion, we report a new approach (synergistic effect of H2O additive and DMF vapour post treatment) to improve the quality of thick MAPbI3 films prepared with a two-step spin-coating method under ambient atmosphere. A H2O additive was added into both the PbI2/DMF and MAI/IPA precursor solutions. The resulting film was further exposed to DMF vapor before thermally annealing at 100 °C to remove the solvent. A perovskite film with a thickness of 500 nm, grain size up to 3 μm and no observable defects within the grains was prepared by the synergistic effect of H2O and DMF. The champion p–i–n cell realizes a very high PCE of 20.1% and a FF of 0.83. The cell also exhibits no current hysteresis and is stable both in air (when encapsulated) and in a glove box. This new method was applied to fabricate a perovskite solar cell and a mini-module with an active area of 1.3 cm2 and 11.25 cm2, respectively, to achieve a PCE of more than 15% and was very reproducible. The results provide an important facile approach to fabricate a high-efficiency, stable and large area perovskite solar cell/module for commercial applications.
Experimental section
Chemicals and physicochemical studies
The chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received unless specified. CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized by the same method as published in the literature.65 GIWXRD data were collected in the 2θ range of 5–50 degree on a Bruker powder diffractometer (D8 Discover) equipped with a 2D detector using Cu Kα1 radiation. UV-VIS spectra of the perovskite active films were measured using a Cary 300 Bio spectrometer at room temperature. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed with a Hitachi S-800 microscope at 15 kV. Samples (surface and cross-section of the film on substrates) for SEM imaging were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape then coated with a thin layer of gold film to avoid charging. The cross section SEM image was used for estimating the film thickness. The thickness of the perovskite films was also measured with a depth-profile meter (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Five lines on the 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm film were made by carefully scratching with a tip and the average height between the hills and valleys is used to represent the film thickness.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurements
The cells (with an active area of 0.1–1.3 cm2) were fabricated using a similar method we reported previously17 except a controlled amount of water was added to MAI/IPA solution followed by DMF vapour treatment. PbI2/DMF precursor solution (conc. 1.0 M) was prepared by first dissolving PbI2 in DMF, then adding 2 wt% H2O (vs. DMF) and stirring at 80 °C overnight. CH3NH3I/IPA solutions with various concentrations and H2O contents were made by dissolving varied amounts of MAI(s) in HPLC grade IPA (stored in the glove box) and then adding double-distilled H2O. To fabricate an inverted perovskite solar cell, PEDOT:PSS was first spin-coated on a patterned ITO substrate at 5000 rpm for 50 s from an aqueous dispersion (AI4083, 1.3–1.7 wt% of PEDOT:PSS, purchased from H.C. Stark Baytron P) and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min to be a hole transporting layer. For depositing a perovskite film, first a layer of PbI2 was spin-coated on top of the preheated (100 °C) PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s from the PbI2/DMF/H2O precursor solution at 85 °C. Before the PbI2 film was dried, CH3NH3I/isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (w/w H2O at 80 °C) was added on top of the PbI2 film via spin coating using various spin programs to form the perovskite film. Specifically, the perovskite film with the best photovoltaic performance was fabricated by using 30 μL, 60 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I/IPA solution with 0.5 vol% H2O (vs. IPA) at a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s. The resulting perovskite film was solvent annealed with DMF vapor at 60 °C for 10 min, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. An acceptor layer was prepared by spin coating (1000 rpm, 30 s) from 50 μL, 2 wt% PC71BM in chlorobenzene (at room temperature) on top of the perovskite film and then solvent annealed for 24 hour at room temperature. All the fabrication procedures were carried out in the ambient atmosphere. Finally, a Ca/Al (20 nm/100 nm) electrode was deposited via high-vacuum thermal evaporation to construct the typical inverted (p–i–n) perovskite solar cell. The area of the cell was defined by a mask whose area was measured with the same method we reported.17 The stability of the cell was tested by storing it in a glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 10 ppm) or leaving it in ambient atmosphere (25–30 °C, 30–35% humidity) without special storage and the efficiency was measured every 5 days. As the calcium (Ca) electrode used in the cell is very sensitive to moisture and oxygen, the cell for the stability test in air was carefully packed with epoxy resin and glass slides as shown in Fig. S14, ESI.† The stability of VD-0.5 under severe conditions was tested by putting the cell in a chamber having 85% relative humidity at 85 °C (without lighting) and the cell was taken out of the chamber to measure the I–V curve every day. The stability of the cell under continuous illumination (1 Sun, AM 1.5) was tested only in the glove box without packing. The large area cells and mini-modules were fabricated basically with the same steps as the small device except the active film was enlarged from 0.2 cm × 0.5 cm (typically used in this study) to 1.3 cm × 1.0 cm or connecting 5 cells in series (the active area of each cell is 0.5 cm × 4.5 cm with the designed pattern illustrated in Fig. S11, ESI†) using more volume of precursor and acceptor solutions. The used Sun simulator, the I–V and IPCE curves measurements, the determination of the photovoltaic parameters as well as the calibration of all measuring facilities are the same as what we reported previously.17 The film homogeneity of the large area cell was probed by selectively (using a mask with a hole of 0.5 mm radius) illuminating 5 different spots of the cell and recording the IPCE curve of each spot.

Broader context
The synergistic effect of H2O and DMF was used to prepare a high quality, thick MAPbI3 film via a two-step spin-coating method. The best p–i–n perovskite cell based on the MAPbI3 film achieved a very high efficiency of 20.1% and was stable both in an inert atmosphere and air after appropriate encapsulation. The same perovskite film preparation strategy was used to fabricate a large area film for a perovskite mini-module with an active area of 11.25 cm2 to realize an efficiency over 15%.
