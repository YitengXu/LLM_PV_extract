    , Accepted 3rd April 2020First published on 7th April 2020AbstractAlthough perovskite solar cells have achieved an efficiency over 25%, the scalable fabrication of high efficiency and stable large perovskite solar modules is still a big challenge. To date, various up-scaling methods have been developed to deposit large area perovskite films, but most of them are mainly based on the MAPbI3 perovskites and a few on the more stable FA-based perovskites. Here, two-step sequential blade-coating is employed for the scalable fabrication of FA-based perovskite solar cells from ∼0.1 cm2 devices to 100 cm2 modules. It is found that a non-volatile solvent having strong coordination and low solubility with PbI2 is beneficial for self-formation of regular nano-porous structured PbI2 films through blade-coating. This continuous porous structure is extremely important for the PbI2 films to be effectively converted to black phase perovskites. Upon further combining with appropriate perovskite seed-assisted growth to improve the crystallinity, a champion efficiency of 20.49% for 0.16 cm2 devices, an efficiency of 16.54% for 5 × 5 cm2 perovskite solar modules, and an efficiency of 13.32% for 10 × 10 cm2 modules are achieved, all with outstanding stability. This indicates the great potential of two-step sequential printing of perovskite films in scalable production.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn more and more attention due to their excellent photoelectric properties, high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low manufacturing cost.1–3 The PSCs have achieved a certified PCE of 25.2% comparable to that of single-crystal silicon solar cells,4 showing great promise in future commercialization. However, almost all the high-efficiency PSCs have been prepared in a glovebox through spin-coating with various strategies such as anti-solvent, vacuum or gas blowing methods.5 Spin-coating is actually not an ideal method for fabrication of large-sized perovskite films due to the huge waste of materials and the difficulty in scaling up, especially when combined with the anti-solvent process.6,7 Therefore, a simple printable way for continuous fabrication of high quality large-sized perovskite films is more desirable for fast and cheap manufacturing, which is still the major problem.8,9
Blade coating is a simple and low-cost scalable thin-film deposition method and has also been widely applied in scalable fabrication of perovskite films recently.10–12 In general, a one-step method is a preferred choice because it is easy to achieve high efficiency by accurately tuning the perovskite composition through the perovskite precursor solution.13–15 Thus, efforts have been devoted to one-step blade coating, but most are based on the methylammonium (MA) based-perovskites.16–18 For more stable formamidinium (FA) or FA-rich perovskites, due to the difficult control of nucleation and growth of FA-based perovskites, almost all the one-step deposited high-efficiency FA-based perovskites are prepared by the spin-coating method with the assistance of anti-solvent engineering.19–21 It is difficult to obtain high quality FA-based perovskite films via a simple one-step blade coating method.
Alternatively, the two-step method employs PbI2 as the template to react with MAX or FAX,22–24 skipping the most difficult step of the uncontrollable nucleation of the perovskite and thus has greater flexibility in preparation.25,26 The problem in two-step fabrication is the incomplete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite due to the dense PbI2 films.23 Therefore, a lot of studies have been reported to prepare porous PbI2 films, demonstrating the faster and more complete conversion. For example, Yaghoobi Nia et al. utilized a slow evaporation method to control the crystal growth from a supersaturated PbI2 wet film to form a porous PbI2/DMF layer, which facilitated the infiltration of MAI into the PbI2/DMF layer.27 Hwang et al. reported two-step sequential slot-die coated PbI2 films via gas quenching, which were then stored in an enclosed space to induce the formation of a porous structure for high efficiency MA-based PSCs.28 Li et al. reported two-step sequential deposition based on a vacuum deposition method by controlling the evaporation rate of PbI2 to adjust the porosity of the film, achieving an efficiency of 12.7% in 1.2 cm2 flexible PSCs.29 Seo et al. reported a mediator extraction treatment in the two-step sequential spin-coating process, by which the pre-deposited PbI2-DMSO dense film was converted into a porous PbI2 film.30 Although high efficiencies over 20% have been reported for two-step spin-coating of a PbI2 solution and FAI/MABr/MACl solution,31,32 there are few reports on the two-step blade-coating method. During spin-coating, due to the centrifugal force and fast evaporation of the solvent to increase the concentration, it helps the penetration and fast reaction of the organic salts with PbI2. However, for the blade-coating process, an incomplete reaction of the blade-coated PbI2 films prepared from the DMF solution is found. Therefore, a continuous porous structure of PbI2 allowing the fast diffusion of organic salts is more important for the two-step blade-coating method.33
In this work, we obtain a continuous and regular nanostructure in the blade-coated PbI2 films through screening of different solvent additives. We find a coordination solvent of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) can be a simple pore-guiding additive to achieve continuous regular porous PbI2 films by blade-coating after thermal annealing without a further assisting process. After blade-coating of FAI/MABr/MACl onto the porous PbI2 films, complete black perovskite films can be obtained. This strategy successfully increases the average PCE of blade-coated small-area devices from 14.38% to 16.52%. To further improve the PCE, appropriate perovskite seeds are added to the porous PbI2 film, achieving a champion PSC with a PCE of 20.49%. This method is also demonstrated in fabrication of large-area modules, and high efficiencies of 16.54% for 5 × 5 cm2 (aperture area 10 cm2) and 13.32% for 10 × 10 cm2 (aperture area 53.6 cm2) have been successfully obtained. Therefore, this simple blade-coating strategy shows great promise for future commercial application.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Screening of solvent additives
In general, the blade-coating fabrication of perovskite films via the two-step method involves two coatings as shown in Fig. 1. The first deposition of PbI2 films includes two steps: (i) blade-coating of PbI2 with gas blowing to remove the solvents, followed by (ii) thermal annealing for 10 min at 100 °C to obtain PbI2 crystalline films. The second deposition of organic salts includes (iii) blade coating of FAI/MABr/MACl isopropanol (IPA) solution followed by (iv) thermal annealing for 15 min at 150 °C to convert them into perovskite crystalline films. The most important step is the first step, achieving continuous regular porous PbI2 films, which could be realized by additive engineering.34–36 Adding solvents to induce the formation of a porous structure is a desired approach as, compared with other additives, they can be easily removed. Such a solvent should evaporate after the bulk solvent. The removal of the additive solvent leaves pores in the PbI2 films. The amount of the solvent added should be as low as possible to avoid the formation of very large pores that would result in an undesired porous structure in the as-transformed perovskite films. Ideally, the compact PbI2 film bound with the additive solvent forms first, then thermal annealing removes the solvent resulting in the continuous porous structure. Since the drying process for blade-coating is quite different from that for the spin-coating process, we need to screen the commonly used solvents, such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), pyridine (PY), and γ-butyrolactone (GBL), which have different boiling points, vapor pressures, solubilities and coordination abilities with PbI2 as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The corresponding Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the PbI2 and perovskite films are shown in Fig. 2 and S2 in the ESI,† respectively. It is found that only TBP (with 5 vol% in DMF) could generate the desired porous structure and the high quality perovskite film. Fig. 2a, b, d and e show the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and SEM images of the PbI2 films with/without TBP additives. The roughness of the PbI2 films increases from Rq = 12.6 nm for the pure DMF solvent sample (labeled PbI2) to Rq = 36.7 nm for the 5 vol% TBP containing DMF solvent sample (labeled PbI2-TBP). The corresponding SEM images (Fig. 2g and h) of the perovskite films also demonstrate that the porous PbI2 film can grow into large crystal grains. The PbI2 films fabricated from the DMF solvent which contains 5 vol% GBL, DMSO and PY are similar to the one made from the pure DMF solvent, with a few pores, and the corresponding perovskite films have much smaller grains than the PbI2-TBP sample. As GBL could not coordinate with PbI2, it would evaporate with the DMF during the drying process. Although DMSO could coordinate with PbI2 (Fig. S3, ESI†), due to the low vapor pressure (0.42 mmHg at 20 °C) of DMSO,37 too much DMSO residue remained in the dried PbI2 films. During thermal annealing, as DMSO has a high solubility with PbI2 (∼1.14 M, Fig. S1, ESI†), it acts as an annealing solvent to eliminate the nano-pores, and also results in slightly larger perovskite grains than those obtained using the pure DMF solution. PY is quite similar to TBP but has a lower boiling point. As it evaporates too quickly, we could not find the existence of the coordinated compounds from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, to achieve the continuous porous structure in the blade-coated PbI2 film, the solvent added should have strong coordination with PbI2 and at the same time have a high boiling point and a low solubility with PbI2. Compared with DMSO, TBP has a much lower solubility with PbI2 (<0.1 M, Fig. S1, ESI†). It can form coordinated compounds (Fig. S3, ESI†) and be quickly removed by thermal annealing. Thus, the desired porous structure is formed with the addition of TBP in DMF (Fig. 2f).

The corresponding grain size distribution of perovskite films converted from different blade-coated PbI2 films: (j) PbI2, (k) PbI2-TBP and (l) PbI2-TBP-PS, respectively. 
After the second blade-coating step of the organic mixed salts of FAI/MABr/MACl, the PbI2 film is converted to FA/MA-mixed perovskites (Fig. 2g and h). The TBP-assisted perovskite (Fig. 2k) has much larger grains than the control one (Fig. 2j). The average grain sizes of perovskite converted from the pristine compact PbI2 and porous PbI2-TBP films are ∼200 nm and ∼500 nm, respectively. Fig. 3a and b show the cross-sectional SEM images of the two perovskite films. A lot of small sized perovskite grains converted from the pristine compact PbI2 are stacked together in the vertical direction, while for the porous PbI2-TBP films, the perovskite films consist of much bigger grains. The XRD patterns (Fig. 3d) of the prepared perovskites show that the TBP-assisted perovskite has much less PbI2 residue compared with the control sample. The UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 3e) confirm that more perovskites form in the TBP-perovskite film than in the control sample. This confirms the importance of the continuous porous structure in the PbI2 film.

2.2. Perovskite seed additive
Although the TBP additive has shown advantages in high quality perovskite formation, there is still some unreacted PbI2 (Fig. 3d). In addition, the grain size of the perovskite is not large enough, as in the normal direction of the perovskite film there are still several grain boundaries that are harmful for charge transport. In order to further improve the quality of the perovskite crystals, perovskite seeds have been added into the PbI2 precursor solution. Seed-assisted growth has been demonstrated to form highly crystalline perovskite films.38 A normal crystallization process first requires the precipitation of nuclei, and then the nuclei start to grow. The added perovskite seeds can act as the nuclei, allowing direct growth into high quality perovskite crystals.38,39 In our work, we add a (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/DMF solution to the PbI2-TBP precursor solution (labeled PbI2-TBP-PS) as seeds to improve the crystallization of perovskites. From the AFM images in Fig. 2c, we can observe that the roughness has reduced to Rq = 18.2 nm, which indicates that the growth of PbI2 has also been affected by perovskite seeds. The SEM image (Fig. 2f) of the PbI2 film shows a more porous structure, which results in much larger perovskite grains as shown in Fig. 2i. The average grain size of perovskite converted from porous PbI2-TBP-PS films is ∼900 nm (Fig. 2l), almost double that of perovskite prepared without seeds (500 nm). The cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite film (Fig. 3c) also shows that in the normal direction of the film it consists of a single grain without any grain boundaries that would be beneficial for charge transport.
The corresponding XRD patterns obviously demonstrate the enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film by this optimization strategy as shown in Fig. 3d. A greatly reduced intensity of the (001) lattice plane of PbI2 is exhibited by the perovskite film converted from the PbI2-TBP-PS film. There is a slight right-shift of the typical (110) lattice plane of perovskite prepared from the PbI2-TBP-PS film, which can be ascribed to the extra Br− from the mixed halide perovskite seeds and reduced PbI2 residues. The UV-Vis spectra also match well with this result (Fig. 3e), having a slight blue-shift and obviously enhanced absorption of the PbI2-TBP-PS derived perovskite film. The porous PbI2 films with seeds greatly accelerate the conversion and formation of high quality perovskite films, as visualized from the photographs (Fig. 3f). As explained in Fig. 3g, the organic salts diffuse with difficulty into the compact PbI2 films; therefore, the reaction mainly occurs at the surface, showing a high transparency perovskite film. For the porous PbI2 films, the organic salts can quickly and deeply diffuse into the porous structured PbI2 films to quickly convert into much blacker perovskite films. With the assistance of the perovskite seeds embedded in the porous PbI2 films, the perovskite crystals form even more quickly and the conversion is more complete, resulting in a more black perovskite film.
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements have been further performed to understand the quality of these different perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 4a. Obviously increased PL intensity is found in the perovskite films based on the PbI2-TBP-PS sample compared to the PbI2-TBP and pristine PbI2 samples, revealing the high quality of the perovskite film with much fewer defects. Moreover, the emission peak shifts from 800 to 786 nm with the decrease of the residual PbI2, which is consistent with the blue-shift of the absorption edge (Fig. 3e). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements are employed to evaluate the recombination behavior of the photo-excited carriers in the perovskite films (Fig. 4b). The TRPL spectra show a longer lifetime in the perovskite film based on the PbI2-TBP-PS sample compared to the other perovskite films, which confirms that the PbI2-TBP-PS perovskite film has fewer irradiative defects.40

2.3. Device performance
To further explore the performance of the blade-coated perovskite films in solar cells, planar n–i–p devices with the structure of FTO/SnO2/(FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x/spiro-OMeTAD/Au as shown in Fig. 5a have been fabricated. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 5b) shows the complete device structure fabricated from the blade-coated PbI2-TBP-PS sample with the horizontally aligned single-grain perovskite. All the devices are based on 5 vol% TBP containing PbI2 films, which is the optimized concentration determined from the relationship between the TPB amount and efficiency as shown in Fig. S4.† The distributions of photovoltaic characteristics for the pristine PbI2, PbI2-TBP and PbI2-TBP-PS devices are depicted in Fig. 5c and S5a–c in the ESI.† The detailed parameters are listed in Table S1.† There is an obvious increase of the PCE from an average of 14.54% for the pristine PbI2 based devices to 16.36% for the porous PbI2-TBP based devices, and a further increase to 19.0% for the porous PbI2-TBP-PS based devices. The corresponding open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and FF also exhibit a similar tendency. This indicates the great improvement of the quality of the perovskites made from the seed-assisted porous PbI2 films. We also further investigated the device performance of the perovskites fabricated from the seed-assisted pristine compact PbI2 films. Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the typical J–V curves of the devices based on different contents of perovskite seeds in the pristine PbI2 films. The performance of devices based on perovskite seed-assisted PbI2 films is better than that of the pristine devices, but still much lower than that of the PbI2-TBP-PS devices. This indicates that the porous nanostructure is essential to achieve high quality perovskite films. Fig. S5d† shows the champion device with a high efficiency of 19.5% based on porous PbI2-TBP-PS films via blade coating, which exhibits a comparable efficiency to that of the traditional spin-coated devices although it has hysteresis. To further eliminate the hysteresis and improve the device performance, a large cation based iodide salt, a tert-butylammonium iodide (tBAI), was employed to engineer the interface, which has been demonstrated to suppress the hysteresis effectively.41Fig. 5d shows a J–V curve of the champion PbI2-TBP-PS device via this sequential blade-coating process with the assisted interface treatment of tBAI IPA solution. A high PCE of 20.49% with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 23.70 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.79 under reverse scan and a PCE of 19.74% with a Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 23.69 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.78 under forward scan are achieved. The corresponding EQE spectrum of this champion device is showed in Fig. 5e. The integrated photocurrent density is 22.96 mA cm−2, which matches well with the Jsc measured by the J–V test. The steady-state output current densities at the maximum power point of the devices are shown in Fig. 5f, exhibiting a steady-state output efficiency of 19.7% at a bias of 0.9 V.

(e) The corresponding EQE spectra and (f) steady-state output current density at the maximum power point of the champion PSC. 
The stability of these different devices based on blade-coating is also examined. Fig. 6a shows the curves of the different devices which are stored under laboratory conditions at room temperature (about 25 °C) with a relative humidity of 20 ± 5%. The PbI2-TBP-PS devices exhibit excellent environmental stability retaining over 90% of the original PCE after 1000 h, while the pristine devices retain only less than 50% of the original PCE. Moreover, we also measure the outdoor environmental stability of the best-performing devices at 20 ± 5 °C with a relative humidity of 60 ± 10% (Fig. 6b). After 200 h, the PbI2-TBP-PS devices retain only about 55% of the original PCE due to the harsh environmental conditions; however, other devices quickly failed after 150 h of operation. The results confirm the improved stability due to the improved perovskite quality.

(e) The best PCE of reported devices with different aperture areas fabricated by two-step sequential deposition scalable printing methods. 
Finally, up-scaling the PbI2-TBP-PS films by the two-step blade-coating method is demonstrated successfully. Fig. 6c shows photographs of the front and back of a 10 × 10 cm2 large perovskite solar module (PSM) with 12 series-connected sub-cells fabricated by the scalable blade-coating method. Fig. 6d shows the J–V curves of the champion modules with different sizes. The detailed parameters of these champion devices derived from the J–V curves are listed in Table 1. The 5 × 5 cm2 PSM with an aperture area of 10 cm2via a mask (Fig. S7a and c, ESI†) shows a high PCE of 16.54%, with a Voc of 6.713 V, a Jsc of 3.47 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.71 as shown in Fig. S8a.† Fig. S8b† shows the corresponding steady state output efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking. The 10 × 10 cm2 PSM with an aperture area of 53.64 cm2via a mask (Fig. S7b and d, ESI†) shows a high PCE of 13.32%, with a Voc of 11.826 V, a Jsc of 1.80 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.62. Fig. 6e shows the recently reported champion PCE of devices fabricated by two-step sequential scalable printing methods.25,28,42–45 The detailed parameters are listed in Table S2.† This two-step sequential blade-coating strategy leads to the highest PCE for both small FA-based devices and large solar modules. Furthermore, the indoor storage stability of the large modules is shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI,† which still retain over 80% of the original PCE after 1000 h. Therefore, employing this optimized two-step blade-coating strategy would provide more convenience for the future scalable fabrication of PSMs.

3. Conclusion
In summary, high quality perovskite films via a modified two-step sequential blade-coating process are demonstrated successfully and are converted from self-formed regular nano-porous structured PbI2 films with pre-added perovskite seeds. Self-formed nano-pores in the PbI2 films can be easily realized by adding a proper nonvolatile solvent of TBP that has strong coordination and low solubility with PbI2 in the PbI2 DMF solution. This method completely solves the common difficulties of incomplete conversion and small-sized perovskite grains in the traditional two-step process. By further introducing the perovskite seeds in the porous PbI2 films, a FA-based champion device with the highest PCE of 20.49% is achieved via blade-coating. We also demonstrate a 5 × 5 cm2 perovskite solar module with a high PCE of 16.54% and a 10 × 10 cm2 module with a high PCE of 13.32%. In addition, both the small devices and large modules show outstanding stability in an ambient environment without encapsulation. Therefore, preparation of these self-formed porous structured PbI2 films with the perovskite seed-assisted growth strategy via blade-coating is a feasible approach for scalable fabrication of large sized perovskite solar modules, showing great promise in future commercial production.
