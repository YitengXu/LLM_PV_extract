    , Accepted 30th May 2017First published on 30th May 2017AbstractA novel solid-state electrolyte based on 1,3-dihexylbenzimidazolium ([DHexBIm]) cations combined with Br−, BF4− or SCN− anions is used in CdS/CdSe sensitized quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). A power conversion efficiency of 4.26% was achieved with a fill factor of 56.44% using the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte. X-ray powder diffraction analysis reveals that [DHexBIm][SCN] is crystalline with a much higher symmetry than the other two salts. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis of [DHexBIm][SCN] reveals a solid–solid phase transition at 50 °C together with a high thermal stability. Current density–voltage (J–V) tests, Tafel-polarization plots, cyclic voltammetry curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic methods were used to characterize QDSSCs and to probe the mechanism of device performance. These studies show that good ionic conductivity and a low RCE value lead to a good short-current density (Jsc) of 12.58 mA cm−2, which is the major effect factor for the high power conversion efficiency observed. In the stability test, this device shows excellent long-term stability, maintaining 67% of the initial efficiency after 504 h.
Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are promising photovoltaic devices due to the unique features of quantum dots (QDs), including their high absorption coefficient and multiple exciton generation.1–3 The electrolyte plays a crucial role in the regeneration of the QDs and charge transfer between the photoanode and counter electrode in QDSSCs.4,5 Despite considerable efforts devoted to the development of QDSSCs, the most widely used electrolytes are still liquids based on water or methanol.6,7 The complex chemistry of sulfur species (the common redox couple in QDSSCs) in aqueous solution and the volatility of the solvent lead to fabrication and stability problems of QDSSC devices.8–10
To address these issues, solid-state electrolytes have been evaluated due to their advantages which include good thermal stability and facile manufacture.11 However, most of the solid-state QDSSCs require expensive hole transport materials (HTMs), such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Table 1). Spiro-OMeTAD demands a lengthy synthesis and is obtained in low yield,12 whereas P3HT-based QDSSCs require the time-consuming either thermal or solvent annealing to reach maximum performance.13 Nevertheless, QDSSCs fabricated with Spiro-OMeTAD are less efficient.14–19 Although an efficiency of 8.07% for P3HT-containing QDSSCs is reported (Table 1), it depends largely on the PbS QD sensitizer, providing a wider absorption band for incident light.20 Small molecule solid-state electrolyte materials, as a facile and low-cost alternative to the solid-state electrolyte of QDSSCs, have received little attention in addition to several plastic crystalline and p-type semiconductors (Table 1).21,22 Hence, the exploration of readily available small molecule solid-state electrolytes could lead to rapid improvements in QDSSC performance.

Imidazolium salts have been widely employed in photovoltaic devices due to their favorable properties, such as high thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical windows and the ability to dissolve organic or inorganic solutes.26–28 Several organic ionic conductors based on imidazolium salts have been shown to be effective solid-state electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).29–33 However, there are no reports on the application of organic ionic conductors in QDSSCs. Benzimidazolium-based salts maintain many of the features of imidazolium salts, while presenting the solid state at room temperature due to the larger size of the cation which has a propensity to form π–π stacking interactions.34 Herein, we report for the first time the application of an all solid-state electrolyte with a benzimidazolium-based conductor. We synthesize a benzimidazolium cation with two hexyl groups, combined with a linear thiocyanate anion which could exhibit high conductivities.35 The high conducting nature of the benzimidazolium thiocyanates allowed us to prepare efficient QDSSCs without the addition of Spiro-OMeTAD or other polymers. The QDSSC employing the 1,3-dihexylbenzimidazolium thiocyanate-based electrolyte yielded an optimized efficiency of 4.26% under simulated full air-mass sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), the highest among solid-state QDSSCs using a non-polymer electrolyte.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
1-Bromohexane, sodium sulfide, sulfur (sublimed), benzimidazole and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate were purchased from Aladdin Industrial (China). Potassium thiocyanate, potassium tetrafluoroborate, and chromic nitrate were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All chemicals were of analytical grade. Organic solvents were purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conductive glass used as the substrate for the fabrication of electrodes was purchased from Wuhan Geao Science Instruments. Titania photocatalyst aeroxide TiO2 (P25) particles were purchased from Evonik Degussa (China).
Characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 MHz spectrometer using deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as the solvent. IR spectra were measured on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. ESI-MS was performed on a Bruker MALDI-TOF instrument. The thermal properties of crystals (benzimidazolium salts) were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a Thermoanalyzer Systems Q1000DSC + LNCS + FACS Q600SDT at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range of 20–800 °C under a N2 atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Rigaku D/Max-RA X-ray diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromatized high-intensity Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the surface morphology was carried out on a FEI Quanta 200 instrument. The short-circuit current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of cells were acquired using a Keithley 2400 source meter under standard air mass (AM) 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) under dark conditions. Tafel polarization and conductivity studies of the electrolyte were performed on an electrochemical workstation CHI660d. Cyclic voltammetry curve investigation was carried out on a CHI660d electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 from −0.7 to 0.7 V. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were tested with the bias voltage from −0.7 to 0.7 V in the frequency range from 0.01 to 106 Hz.
Synthesis of the organic ionic conductor
The benzimidazolium salts N,N′-dihexylbenzimidazolium bromide36 and N,N′-dihexylbenzimidazolium tetrafluoroborate37 were prepared according to literature methods. The N,N′-Dihexylbenzimidazolium thiocyanate was prepared by anion exchange of [DHexBIm]Br with NaSCN. [DHexBIm]Br (2.2 g, 6 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (20 mL), NaSCN (1.46 g, 18 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at 30 °C for 24 h. The solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure and the resulting white solid was washed with diethyl ether (2 × 15 mL). The final product was dried under vacuum at 40 °C for 24 h. Yield: 87%, MP 170 °C. [DHexBIm][SCN], δH (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): 9.82 (s, 1H), 8.09–8.12 (m, 2H), 7.67–7.71 (m, 2H), 4.46–4.51 (t, 4H), 1.88–1.93 (m, 4H), 1.25–1.29 (m, 12H), 0.81–0.86 (t, 6H). δC (75 MHz, DMSO-d6): 142.0, 131.1, 126.5, 113.7, 46.6, 30.5, 28.4, 25.3, 21.8, 13.7. IR (cm−1): 2070. ESI-MS calculated for C19H31N2 (m/z): 287.2487, found: 287.2482.
Preparation of the electrolyte
The electrolyte consists of an ionic conductor matrix, sodium sulfide, sublimed sulfur, potassium chloride, and a crystal inhibitor (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate). The components were mixed in a 1:1:1:0.1:0.4 molar ratio and uniformly ground.38
Fabrication of QDSSC devices
FTO conductive glass was successively washed with ethanol, hydrochloric acid, isopropanol and finally with anhydrous ethanol in an ultrasonic cleaning machine. Adhesive tapes with a 6 mm diameter hole were stuck on the surface of FTO glass, and the P25 particles were deposited on the FTO glass with a doctor blade. The resulting FTO glass was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min to form a mesoporous TiO2 film. The obtained TiO2 electrode was cooled to room temperature and co-sensitized with CdS/CdSe quantum dots by applying a successive ion layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) technique.39 In brief, the SILAR technique used to prepare CdS/CdSe co-sensitized photoanodes comprises five cycles for CdS and three cycles for CdSe. The resulting TiO2 film was immersed in 0.1 mol L−1 Cd(NO3)2 methanol solution for 1 min and then washed with methanol. After removing the solvent on the surface with a filter paper the TiO2 film was immersed again in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2S methanol/water solution (1:1 volume ratio) for 1 min. The above two steps consist of one cycle of CdS sensitization. One cycle of the deposition of CdSe consisted of the immersion of the TiO2 electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Cd(NO3)2 methanol solution for 10 min and in a 0.3 mol L−1 aqueous Na2SeSO3 solution for 20 min at 50 °C (the Na2SeSO3 solution was prepared according to a literature method).40,41 For the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized photoanode, a passivation layer of ZnS is necessary as it effectively suspends the recombination of photoelectrons. This ZnS layer was added by the immersion of the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized photoanode in 0.1 mol L−1 Zn(CH3COO)2 methanol solution and 0.1 mol L−1 Na2S methanol/water solution (1:1 volume ratio) consecutively for 1 minute each immersion, repeating the two steps twice. The PbSe counter electrode was prepared by the electrochemical deposition method with a pulse voltage of 3 V and a constant current of 5 A. The QDSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the ionic electrolytes into the space between the quantum-dot sensitized TiO2 electrode and PbSe counter electrode with the doctor blading method to form sheets of 0.28 cm2 area.
Results and discussion
Electrolyte preparation and characterization
The benzimidazolium bromide salt, [DHexBIm]Br, was prepared by the reaction of benzimidazole and 1-bromohexane as shown in Scheme 1.36 Subsequent anion exchange of the bromide anion by the reaction of [DHexBIm]Br with NaBF4 (ref. 37) or NaSCN affords the salts [DHexBIm][BF4] and [DHexBIm][SCN].

XRD analysis of the benzimidazolium salts reveals that the Br− with BF4− salts exhibit similar diffraction patterns, indicative of an analogous crystal structure. Indeed, the single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures of a series of N,N′-dihexylbenzimidazolium salts exhibit a U-shaped conformation and interdigitated bilayer packing with additional anion-independent structural properties.36 The XRD pattern of [DHexBIm][SCN] is distinct from those of the other two salts (Fig. 1a), containing fewer diffraction peaks with much stronger intensities, reflecting the higher symmetry and better crystallinity of [DHexBIm][SCN] compared to [DHexBIm]Br and [DHexBIm][BF4]. It is to be noted that the symmetry of the crystal of the dihexylbenzimidazolium salts increases from bromide and iodide to hexafluorophosphate.36 The good crystallinity and the high symmetry of the [DHexBIm][SCN] are clearly observed in the SEM images, which show well-regulated cubic textures with the edges in the micrometer regime (Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD pattern of [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br, BF4 and SCN) and (b) SEM image of [DHexBIm][SCN] (inset shows solid [DHexBIm][SCN]). 
The phase behavior and the thermal stability of [DHexBIm][SCN] were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, 5% weight loss). As shown in Fig. 2, [DHexBIm][SCN] displays three different phases in the temperature range of 20 to 350 °C. The first phase transition is a solid–solid phase transition at 50 °C, after which a particular broad temperature range comprising a plastic phase is observed. As the temperature is increased, it changes from the solid to the liquid state at approximate 170 °C, and decomposes at around 250 °C. Overall, [DHexBIm][SCN] has a good thermal durability in the operating temperature range of a QDSSC. It is worth noting that the presence of a plastic phase originating from molecular motions is a beneficial characteristic of conductors, enabling good conductivity and ensuring good contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes, which are highly favorable properties for solid-state electrolytes.42

Charge transport is a crucial property of electrolytes directly affecting the efficient generation of electricity5,43 and is related to the ionic conductivity of electrolytes. The ionic conductivities of [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br, BF4, SCN) were therefore investigated together with the electrolyte additives using EIS and two symmetric FTO electrodes (Fig. 3). The value of the conductivity can be calculated by using the formula σ = l/RS, where σ is the conductivity in S cm−1, R is the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, l is the distance between the two electrodes and S is the area of the electrodes. The calculated conductivities are 2.59 × 10−4 S cm−1, 2.66 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 2.78 × 10−4 S cm−1 for the Br, BF4 and SCN salts, respectively. Although these values are similar the conductivity of the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte is slightly higher than those of the other electrolytes, which may be related to the linear nature of the anion.

Evaluation of the effect of the electrolytes on QDSSC performance
QDSSCs were fabricated using the sensitized photoelectrode, electrolyte and counter electrode to evaluate the effect of the [DHexBIm] (X = Br, BF4 and SCN) salts on the photovoltaic performance of the devices and compared to a device containing a common liquid electrolyte (2.0 mol Na2S/2.0 mol S/0.2 mol KCl in 50 mL of methanol/H2O solution in a 3:7 volume ratio).44 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the solid electrolyte containing [DHexBIm][SCN] and the liquid electrolyte. Detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2 (also see Fig. 4). The [DHexBIm][SCN] based device registered a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.58 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60 V and a fill factor (FF) of 56.44%, leading to a photoelectric efficiency (PCE) of 4.26%. The PCE is superior to those of the devices containing [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br or BF4), although the device containing the liquid electrolyte has slightly superior Jsc, Voc and PCE values. From the J–V curves under dark conditions (Fig. 4b), the dark currents, especially in the device with the [DHexBIm]Br-based electrolyte, drop much faster than that for the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based cells, which indicates that the dark current can be more effectively suspended in the cell with [DHexBIm][SCN].

To further investigate charge transfer in the solid-state electrolyte at the counter electrode, Tafel-polarization curve measurements were carried out by fabricating a symmetric cell composed of [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br, BF4 and SCN) sandwiched between two electrodes (Fig. 5).45,46 The right-hand branch of the Tafel plots should correspond to the oxidation of S2− (S2− → Sn2−), and the left-hand branch correspond to the reduction of Sn2− by electrons (Sn2− → S2−), which is an important back reaction that causes electron losses.47 From the intersection of the above two branches, the exchange current density, j0, can be obtained, and the calculated data are summarized in Table 3. The j0 value can be described by using the following equation:  where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the polysulfide reduction, F is the Faraday constant, A is the electrode area and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode.48 The device with [DHexBIm][SCN] exhibits a j0 of 0.275 mA cm−2, significantly higher than those containing [DHexBIm]Br (j0 = 0.108 mA cm−2) and [DHexBIm][BF4] (j0 = 0.170 mA cm−2). As a result, the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte shows the highest current flow at the catalytic counter electrode of PbSe, which is further indicated by the cyclic voltammetry traces.

As the current density is basically dependent on the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte,43 the trend of the Jsc values of the devices is in good agreement with that of the ionic conductivities of the [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br, BF4, SCN) salts. Furthermore, the rapid reduction of Sn2− on the counter electrode can facilitate a further rise in electron density. In order to assess the reduction activity of the counter electrode for the different electrolytes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using symmetrical PbSe counter electrodes. Fig. 6 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the electrolytes and the corresponding data are listed in Table 4. The cathodic peak corresponds to the reduction of Sn2− to S2−, and the anodic peak corresponds to the oxidation of S2− to Sn2− in the CV curves. The reduction current density of 14.52 mA cm−2 for the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte is larger than those of the [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br and BF4) salts with values of 12.32 mA cm−2 and 12.44 mA·cm−2, respectively, suggesting a faster rate of reduction of Sn2− in the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte at the PbSe electrode/electrolyte interface. Both the good ionic conductivity and the rapid reduction of Sn2− on the counter electrode promote the higher short-circuit photocurrent density in the device with the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte.

To gain further insight into the photovoltaic performance of the tested solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded. The Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of the devices based on electrolytes containing the [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br, BF4 and SCN) salts are shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7a, the intercept of the curve on the real axis is assigned to the series resistance of the cell.49 The first semicircle in the high-frequency region is regarded as the charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte/PbSe counter electrode interface (RCE), and the large semicircle in the mid-frequency range may be attributed to the resistance related to the charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface (Rrec).5,50 The calculated data are summarized in Table 5. As can be seen in Table 5, the values of Rrec for the devices with the [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br, BF4 and SCN)-based electrolytes are 759.5 Ω, 687.3 Ω and 526.1 Ω, respectively, suggesting that the dark current in the device with [DHexBIm]Br can be more effectively suppressed than in the other devices. The RCE values of 530.5 Ω, 240.6 Ω, and 232.8 Ω for the devices incorporating the [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br, BF4 and SCN)-based electrolytes, respectively, imply the fastest reduction of Sn2− at the electrolyte/PbSe counter electrode interface in the [DHexBIm][SCN]-containing system. These results are consistent with the Tafel curves.

The FF is an important parameter of QDSSCs related to their photovoltaic performance. Usually the FF for QDSSCs is about 20–40%.51 With the electrolytes containing the benzimidazolium salts, the resulting QDSSCs show higher FFs, with the values for the [DHexBIm]Br and [DHexBIm][BF4] systems being 41.35% and 44.35%, respectively (Table 2). Importantly, for the device containing the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte, the FF is 56.44%, which is considerably higher than that of the cell using the liquid electrolyte which has a FF of 49.89% (Table 2). In general, the FF is related to the series resistance (Rs) and the shunt resistance (Rsh) in an ideal diode model of a solar cell (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Accordingly, Rs and Rsh are associated with the charge transport and recombination characteristics.52 From Table 5, Rs is 17.8 Ω for the device with [DHexBIm][SCN], which is the lowest of all the cells (Rs of the cell with the liquid electrolyte is 18.67 Ω; see Fig. S2, ESI†).
Considering the similar ionic radius of 182, 218, and 186 pm for Br−, BF4−, and SCN− anions,53,54 the contribution of the anion size to the conductivity may be neglected. BF4− possesses a larger ionic radius than Br−, but the conductivity of the resulting electrolyte and the corresponding cell performance with the [DHexBIm][BF4]-based electrolyte are superior to those based on the [DHexBIm]Br electrolyte (see Fig. 3). Thus, it would appear that the crystallinity of the electrolyte has a key effect on cell performance. As mentioned above, [DHexBIm][SCN] is more crystalline than the other two related salts (Fig. 1b). Along with the relatively small ionic radius of the SCN− ion, larger voids may be present, and doped Sn2− ions may migrate more efficiently across these voids.
The charge transfer kinetics of the electrolyte are related to the effective electron lifetime, i.e. the transfer time of the photon-generated carriers successfully injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 film. The effective electron lifetime can be calculated by using the equation τe = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the peak frequency value of the mid-frequency range in the Bode phase plot as shown in Fig. 7b. The [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte shows a τe of 4.16 ms, much higher than those of the [DHexBIm][X] (X = Br and BF4)-based electrolytes (0.90 and 2.34 ms respectively). Hence, the higher value of τe is also one of the factors which leads to the high PCE of the device with the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte.
Incident photo-to-carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE) corresponds to the percentage of incident photons which are converted to charge carriers and collected at the electrode surface.55 The curve of the QDSSC with the [DHexBIm][SCN]-based electrolyte is shown in Fig. 8. This solid-state QDSSC exhibits a high IPCE of over 80% in a wavelength window from 450 to 550 nm. Solar cells with [DHexBIm][BF4]- and [DHexBIm][Br]-based electrolytes show lower IPCE, which is in good agreement with the PCE data.

The long-term stability of the solid-state QDSSC incorporating [DHexBIm][SCN] was evaluated over a period of >500 h (Fig. 9 and S4 and Table S1, ESI†). The device retains 67% of the initial efficiency after 504 h. In comparison the liquid-type QDSSC decays much more rapidly with the same loss in efficiency occurring in less than a third of the time.

Conclusions
A novel solid-state electrolyte for QDSSCs based on the benzimidazolium salt, [DHexBIm][SCN], was obtained. By studying the dark reaction, the exchange current density, the internal resistance and the effective electron lifetime, it was possible to attribute the high efficiency of 4.26% to the good reduction activity of the counter electrode and the long electron lifetime. Moreover, the high FF of 56.44% appears to correspond to the small series resistance rather than the shunt resistance. The [DHexBIm][SCN] salt, with two hexyl chains and a linear anion, is readily prepared from commercially available starting materials, has a high thermal stability and is easy to handle. This research not only resulted in an effective solid-state electrolyte for application in QDSSCs, but also provides useful mechanistic information for the rational improvement of solid-state QDSSC electrolytes.
