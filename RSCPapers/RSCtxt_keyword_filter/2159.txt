    , Accepted 11th January 2018First published on 12th January 2018AbstractOne solar-driven electrochromic photoelectrochemical fuel cell (PFC) with highly efficient energy conversion and storage is easily constructed to achieve quantitative self-powered sensing. Layered bismuth oxyiodide–zinc oxide nanorod arrays (ZnO@BiOI NRA) with a core/shell p–n heterostructure are fabricated as the photoanode with electrochromic Prussian blue (PB) as the cathode. The core/shell p–n heterostructure for the ZnO@BiOI photoanode can effectively boost the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance through the improvement of photon absorption and charge carrier separation. The optimal assembled PFC yields an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.48 V with the maximum power output density (Pmax) as high as 155 μW cm−2 upon illumination. Benefitting from the interactive color-changing behavior of PB, the cathode not only exhibits cathodic catalytic activity in the PFC but also serves as an electrochromic display for self-powered sensing. The as-constructed PFC possesses multiple readable signal output nanochannels through the maximum power output density (Pmax) of the PFC or the color change of PB. Meanwhile, the dual-signal-output makes the as-constructed self-powered sensor highly available in various operations demands with the enhanced reliability. With the advantages of high efficiency of PFCs, unique assay ability, and broad environmental suitability, the constructed self-powered platform shows broad application prospects as an integrated smart analytical device.
Introduction
The utilization of solar energy has attracted considerable attention due to its intrinsic merits as an inexhaustible, self-sustainable, and green energy source.1–3 However, the diurnal and intermittent nature of solar energy puts forward significant challenges for its practical utilization.4 At present, a variety of approaches have been explored in order to better utilize the solar energy.5,6 Photoelectrochemical fuel cells (PFCs) provide a powerful means of harnessing solar energy by photoelectrochemical reactions, without an additional energy input. Thereinto, the solar energy conversion efficiency of PFCs is strongly dependent on the light absorption, charge separation, charge migration, charge recombination processes and (electro)catalytic activity in photoactive semiconductors, and much efforts have been proposed progressively in recent years.7–11 The exploration of suitable photoactive and thermodynamically stable photoanodes for fuel oxidation is still an intense issue for the development of PFCs.12 Among various photoanode materials reported previously, zinc oxide (ZnO) is believed to be a promising candidate due to its high chemical stability and excellent carrier mobility.13 As an n-type wide band gap semiconductor (∼3.2 eV), the absorption efficiency of ZnO is usually restricted in the ultraviolet region which accounts for a small part in the full solar spectrum limiting its widespread applications.14 To address this issue, the combination of n-type and p-type semiconductors to form a p–n heterojunction has been demonstrated to be an efficient way for the separation of electron–hole pairs.15–17 As a typical p-type semiconductor, layered bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) with a narrow band gap (∼1.8 eV) can be used as a visible-light photosensitizer for n-type ZnO to improve the photovoltaic performance.
As one of the key components in PFC devices, a variety of cathode materials have been developed to date,18–21 such as biocatalysts, noble metals, and p-type semiconductors. Although great progress has been achieved, either high cost or low power output has blocked their further application. It is necessary to seek alternative cathode materials to eliminate the problems mentioned above. In recent years, some solid-state cathodes, such as Prussian blue (PB),22 MnO2,23 and Ag2O,24 have received great attention due to their specific features for electron acceptance by self-charging. In particular, PB as an excellent electrochromic material with a suitable redox reaction region is an attractive material as a cathodic catalyst.25,26
In the current work, a solar-driven PFC with the aim of solar and biomass to electricity conversion and storage was assembled based on a ZnO@BiOI p–n core/shell heterostructure photoanode and electrochromic PB cathode. The ZnO@BiOI photoanode was simply prepared by sensitizing a ZnO nanorod array (NRA) with layered BiOI through successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). The light absorption efficiency and charge transport ability of the photoanode were greatly improved after the formation of a p–n heterostructure. Meanwhile, the PB cathode with interactive color-changing behavior acts as an oxidant to acquire photoelectrons by the reduction of PB (Fe(III)) to Prussian white (PW, Fe(II)) accompanied by the energy storage.26–29 Through recognizing the color variations of PB, the level of energy storage can be constantly and visually conveyed.30
At present, most pioneering studies have been devoted to fabricating PFCs for the application of photocatalytic degradation or photoelectrochemical water splitting.31–34 However, relatively little work has been focused on self-powered devices, which operated independently, sustainably and wirelessly.35 To expand their practical applications, PFCs are considered as a possible alternative to conventional power systems to supply a self-powered system. Furthermore, direct and unambiguous visual read-out is an ideal way to deliver the result on a disposable self-powered device.36 The incorporation of electrochromic materials provides a new way for readable quantification. Many reports have demonstrated the quantification method relying on the colour translation from blue PB to transparent PW with the aid of smart phones or cameras.37,38 The PB cathode proposed here with interactive color-changing behavior can be used as a self-indicating coulometer to give direct quantification information without the use of any equipment. Our result demonstrates that the decoloration of PB affords an amount of photoelectrons that can be easily visualized through the naked eye without the need for any complicated read-out strategy.
The as-constructed electrochromic PFC based self-powered sensing platform can achieve the advantages of dual model output where the level of the analyte can be visually conveyed through the power output of the PFC or the decolorization of PB. Such multiple signal outputs provide more choices for the quantified readout as well as enhance the quantification reliability. This work not only holds great potential contribution to quickly make accurate decisions related to the appropriate channeling of precious healthcare resources, but also provides one effective strategy to reduce lengthy time-to-diagnosis. Meanwhile, the unique combination of multifunctional features may further promote the application of PFCs with preferable suitability for user–device interactions.
Results and discussion
Materials characterization
The ZnO@BiOI photoanode was fabricated on a fluorine-doped indium tin oxide (FTO) substrate by a hydrothermal reaction and the SILAR approach. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the ZnO@BiOI photoanode was greatly enhanced due to the improved visible light collection and facilitated charge separation. Fig. 1a and S1a† illustrate the top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bare ZnO NRA. ZnO NRA vertically aligned on the surface of the FTO substrate with uniform dimensions of 1 μm in length. From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, it is clear that ZnO NRA has a smooth surface with a diameter of around 150 nm (Fig. 1b and S1b†). As shown in Fig. 1c, after the growth of layered BiOI, the surface is uniformly covered and became coarsened. In the corresponding TEM image of ZnO@BiOI, it can be clearly observed that epitaxial and lamellar nanosheets uniformly grew on the surface of ZnO NRA with the increase of rod diameter (Fig. 1d).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of ZnO NRA (a) and ZnO@BiOI (c); TEM images of ZnO NRA (b) and ZnO@BiOI (d); (e–g) HRTEM images of ZnO@BiOI. 
The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1e further demonstrated the successful deposition of layered BiOI on ZnO nanorods with a layer thickness of around 25 nm. Fig. 1f and g provide the typical HRTEM images of this structure. In Fig. 1f the well-resolved lattice spacings were calculated to be 0.260 nm corresponding to the (002) plane of ZnO, further confirming the formation of the wurtzite phase. From Fig. 1g the interplanar distances of 0.175 and 0.205 nm match well with the (121) and (113) planes of tetragonal BiOI, respectively, further indicating that the layered BiOI has successfully enwrapped on the ZnO NRA to form a uniform ZnO@BiOI core/shell composite. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data in Fig. S1c† suggested the co-existence of Zn, O, Bi, and I elements in the as-made core shell ZnO@BiOI heterostructure.
UV-vis absorption spectra are used to investigate the optical properties of ZnO NRA, layered BiOI, and ZnO@BiOI (Fig. 2a). There is no absorption observed in the visible light region for bare ZnO NRA due to its wide band gap (3.2 eV). The absorption wavelengths of pure BiOI display distinct absorption in the visible light region from 400 to 680 nm owing to its narrow band gap (1.8 eV). After the formation of ZnO@BiOI, a prominent absorbance appears in the visible light range, meanwhile, an increased absorbance and an obvious redshift of the absorption edge position can be observed, which is preferable for obtaining enhanced overall PEC performance of the photoanode.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra (a) and XRD patterns (b) of ZnO NRA, layered BiOI, and ZnO@BiOI. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to characterize the crystal structure and composition of the samples. From Fig. 2b, the as-made ZnO NRA possesses a wurtzite structure with strong preferred orientation. The diffraction peaks at 34.52° can be assigned to the (002) lattice planes of ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451), indicating that the ZnO NRA is highly c-axis oriented.39 Several strong diffraction peaks at 29.6°, 31.6°, 45.4°, and 55.2° can be indexed to the tetragonal phase of BiOI (JCPDS 10-0445).40 For the pattern of the ZnO@BiOI composite, all of the diffraction peaks can be ascribed to the tetragonal phase of BiOI and the hexagonal phase of ZnO, respectively. No impurity peaks were observed, confirming the high purity of ZnO@BiOI. The sharp and intense diffraction peaks indicate the highly crystalline nature of both BiOI and ZnO.
The microstructure of the PB cathode on the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate was also examined by SEM. As shown in Fig. 3a, a rough but uniform film composed of densely packed nanoparticles is evenly coated on the ITO substrate with an obvious color change after the electropolymerization (Fig. 3a, inset). In addition, an obvious absorption can be clearly found in the wavelength range of 500–800 nm in an open circuit (Fig. 3b). After applying a reduction potential, the absorbance of PB dramatically decreased, which could be attributed to the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) accompanied by the elimination of the intervalence charge transfer from Fe(III) to Fe(II).29

Performances of the photoanode, PB cathode, and assembled PFC
The performance of the PFC strongly depends on the photoelectrocatalytic activity of the photoanode towards glucose. Fig. 4a shows the cyclic voltammetric (CV) responses of the photoanode recorded in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) with and without 50 mM glucose between −0.6 and +0.8 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. No obvious catalytic current could be obtained either in the absence or presence of 50 mM glucose in the dark due to the slow electron transfer of the photoanode's semiconductive property.41,42 Once under the illumination conditions, a clear and high photoelectrocatalytic activity toward glucose was observed because the participation of photogenerated electrons accelerated the oxidation process of glucose. Fig. 4b shows the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) recorded at the photoanode under different conditions from −0.6 to +0.8 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. Under the dark measurement conditions, the catalytic currents could be negligible either with or without the addition of glucose. When exposed to exciting light, an intense anodic current emerged with an onset potential around −0.40 V, which was induced by the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose.
 Fig. 4  CV scans (a and c) and LSV scans (b and d) of the prepared ZnO@BiOI photoanode (a and b) and PB cathode (c and d) under different conditions; (e) dependence of the power density on the PFC voltage in 0.10 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) under ambient air containing 50 mM glucose upon light illumination; and (f) ratio of the power output (P/P0) of the PFC changed with cycling operation. 
The electrochemical properties of the PB cathode were also explored by the voltammetric method. Fig. 4c shows the CV response of the PB cathode. A pair of distinct redox peaks appeared at around 0.16 V and 0.06 V under different conditions, which is due to the redox reaction between KFeIII[FeII(CN)6] and K2FeII[FeII(CN)6].29Fig. 4d illustrates the LSV curves of the PB cathode in different environments. It should be noted that the exposure to different environments does not change the electrochemical performance of the PB cathode. Additionally, the above results demonstrated that the reduction potential of PB/PW is higher than the onset oxidation potential on the photoanode, implying that the combination of glucose oxidation at the photoanode with the PB reduction at the cathode can produce an efficient electric power output.
Based on the experimental observations above, it is theoretically possible to construct a glucose fueled PFC coupled with a ZnO@BiOI photoanode and electrochromic PB cathode. Fig. 4e presents the relationship between the power output and cell voltage of the PFC operated in the presence of 50 mM glucose. It shows an open-circuit potential (VOC) of 0.48 V, meanwhile the maximum power density (Pmax) reached as high as 0.155 mW cm−2 around 0.38 V under illumination. In addition, the present PFC shows superior or comparable performances by comparison with other PFCs previously reported even under different experimental conditions (Table 1). It is known that the as-assembled PFCs based on biocatalysts or noble metals usually exhibit much higher performances. By comparison, our PFC shows more preferable performance with the use of common and cost-effective electrodes. And the performance of the as-assembled PFC might be further improved through incorporating the biocatalysts or noble metals.

When disconnecting the photoanode and PB cathode, PW could be oxidized to PB by dissolved oxygen accompanied by colouration from transparent to blue as displayed in eqn (1): (1)and the excellent reusability is an important factor for the practical application of PFC devices. Fig. 4f shows the cycling performance of the as-made PFC upon repeated operation. There are little changes in the power output density after 50 cycles, indicating that the PFC based self-powered device possesses a good electrochemical stability.
The possible working mechanism of the as-fabricated PFC is presented in Scheme 1. The p–n junction band structure of the photoanode and the charge separation mechanism are illustrated in Scheme S1.† ZnO NRA acted as a typical n-type semiconductor (n-ZnO) with the Femi level located close to the conduction band (CB), while BiOI is a p-type semiconductor (p-BiOI) with the Femi level close to the valence band (VB).48 After the formation of ZnO@BiOI, an intrinsic electric field develops in the p–n heterojunction until the Fermi levels of n-ZnO and p-BiOI reach the equilibrium. The internal electric field directed from n-ZnO to p-BiOI is simultaneously built to prevent the charge diffusion from n-ZnO into p-BiOI. Under solar irradiation, light-induced separation of electron–hole pairs could occur both in ZnO NRA and BiOI. Driven by the inner electric field, the photoinduced electrons on the CB of p-BiOI could easily transfer to that of n-ZnO, while the holes inversely transfer to the VB of p-BiOI. Eventually, the accumulated electrons in the CB of n-ZnO transfer to the PB cathode, resulting in decolourization and realizing energy storage. Meanwhile, the holes on the surface of p-BiOI are scavenged by glucose molecules.

Photocurrent response of the photoanode
Chronoamperometric I–t curves for different types of photoanodes are shown in Fig. 5 under the white light ON–OFF cycling at 0 V vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode, and steady and prompt photocurrent generation can be observed during on and off cycles of illumination. The photocurrent intensity increased significantly after the modification of the BiOI layer compared with ZnO NRA, demonstrating the improvement of the optical absorption efficiency and the well separation between photoinduced electrons and holes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Fig. S2†) shows that larger amounts of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups exist on the surface of ZnO@BiOI. It has been found that the Cu2+ could be easily coupled to quench the charge transfer from BiOI to ZnO, resulting in the photocurrent decrease to almost the same level as the pristine ZnO nanorods. The weakened photoelectrochemical performance can be ascribed to the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the excited states of BiOI to the d orbitals of Cu2+.49

Phosphorus, one of the most abundant elements in the human body, has a critical impact on bone mineralization, cellular structure, genetic coding, and energy metabolism.50 It has been demonstrated that phosphate species especially pyrophosphate ions (PPi) not only play vital roles in many biological metabolic processes, such as DNA replication, cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation, and hydrolysis of citrate and ATP,51 but also relate to some severe medical conditions in terms of their levels.52 Thus, there is a great desire to develop convenient and facile approaches to PPi assay. Based on the charge quenching transfer of Cu2+ toward the photoanode and strong chelation between PPi and Cu2+, the proposed method could be expended for the practical sample assay. Scheme S2† outlines the design principle of the self-powered technique for PPi assay based on the as-proposed PFC. Incubation of PPi with the photoanode pretreated with Cu2+ resulted in a more intense photoanode response compared with the single Cu2+ pretreated photoanode, which can be ascribed to the chelation between PPi and Cu2+ and the inhibited photogenerated electrons from the excited states of BiOI to the d orbitals of Cu2+. Consequently, through controlling the photoelectron generation, it is highly desirable to achieve an effective method for PPi quantification.
Feasibility investigation of visually detectable signal for quantification
The prepared photoanode and electrochromic PB cathode were assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of this electrochromic PFC based self-powered sensing platform (Scheme 1 and S3†). Fig. 6 provides various PPi-course color change images of the electrochromic PB cathode. With the increasing amount of PPi, the absorbance of the electrochromic PB cathode decreased together with decolourization. As a result, the bleaching degree of PB is directly proportional to the amount of photoelectrons generated from the photoanode. This phenomenon demonstrated that the PFC based self-powered device for direct visual detection can be achieved through controlling the amount of photoelectrons generated (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 6  Colorimetric and absorbance results of the electrochromic PB cathode after the modified photoanode treated with different amounts of PPi. Photo clips of the cathode are shown under-laying the data points of absorbance. 
Analytical performances of the as-constructed self-powered sensor
The designed PFC based self-powered strategy was applied to the quantitative determination of PPi under the optimized conditions (Fig. S3†). A limit-of-detection study was performed by varying the concentration of PPi from 0.1 to 150 μM (Fig. 7a and b). It is clearly observed that the maximum power output (Pmax) directly depends on the PPi concentration. Meanwhile, the increase of PPi concentration leads to the change of the power output accompanied by a color transformation of PB from blue to transparent. With the increasing amount of PPi, the PB turned from blue to colorless because more Cu2+ ions were chelated and removed from the pretreated photoanode (Fig. 7c and d). The results demonstrated that the PPi content can be easily quantified by measuring the color change of PB. Meanwhile, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can catalyze PPi hydrolysis to generate phosphate disabling the complexation between Cu2+ and PPi, and thereby influencing the PFC performance. Consequently, on the basis of the charge quenching transfer of Cu2+ toward the photoanode, strong chelation between PPi and Cu2+, and ALP catalyzed PPi hydrolysis reaction, our proposed method could also be expanded for Cu2+ or ALP sensing.

This work not only provided a simple assay method for PPi detection with better analytical performance compared with previously reported methods (Table S1†), but also exhibited high selectivity (Fig. S4†), excellent reproducibility, and good stability. In addition, the feasibility of this method toward PPi detection was evaluated by assaying clinical serum samples. The analytical results summarized in Table S2† showed acceptable reliability and accuracy. All observations dramatically confirm that our proposed PFC based self-powered device is amenable to the quantification in predicting the presence of the target analyte by simple visualization by the naked eye without the need for any external electrical power source.
Experimental
Preparation of ZnO NRA on FTO
ZnO NRA was synthesized on a FTO substrate via a modified hydrothermal process according to the previous work.53 Prior to the growth of ZnO NRA, the FTO substrate was degreased by sonicating in acetone, ethanol and ultrapure water for 10 min, respectively. First, 0.5 M Zn(CH3COO)2 in ethyl alcohol solution as a seed layer was spin-coated on the FTO electrode substrate for 5 min, followed by heating in air at 350 °C for 30 min and a conformal covering of ZnO seeds was obtained. Then ZnO NRA was grown on the ZnO seeded FTO substrate through a hydrothermal method by immersing in an aqueous solution of 0.05 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.05 M hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) maintaining their volume ratio at 1:1 and kept at 95 °C for 12 h. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the ZnO NRA on FTO substrates were removed from the solution, rinsed with deionized water, and then dried in air.
Fabrication of the ZnO@BiOI core/shell heterostructure
Layered BiOI was synthesized on a ZnO NRA modified FTO substrate through a modified SILAR approach.54 In detail, the FTO substrate modified with ZnO NRA was first immersed in 5 mM Bi(NO3)3 aqueous solution for 30 s, rinsed with deionized water to remove excess ions that weakly bonded to the ZnO NRA surfaces, and then immersed in 5 mM KI aqueous solution for 30 s and rinsed with deionized water again. This deposition process was repeated for 30 cycles, and a compact layer of BiOI on the ZnO NRA was formed.
Analytical procedure toward the pyrophosphate ion (PPi)
The PB cathode was prepared according to the previous work with details shown in the ESI.†29 Prior to detection, the prepared ZnO@BiOI on the FTO substrate (photoanode) was first immersed in Cu2+ standard stock solution with a concentration of 200 μM and then kept for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing with ultrapure water to remove the residual unbound Cu2+, the as-prepared photoanode was immersed in a PBS (0.10 M, pH 7.0) solution with different concentrations of PPi. Followed by incubation for 5 min at room temperature to enable sufficient combination of PPi and Cu2+, the photoanode was subsequently rinsed with deionized water. For the qualitative detection of PPi, the processed photoanode was finally connected to the PB cathode and immersed in 50 mM glucose (dissolved in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0). White light, with a spectral range of 200–2500 nm, was utilized as the excitation light (Scheme S3†). The experimental result was obtained by measuring the power output or the color change of PB. This study revealed a quantitative relationship between the concentration of PPi and the power output of the proposed PFC device or the color change for the electrochromic PB cathode.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a solar driven PFC system by assembling a ZnO@BiOI photoanode and electrochromic PB cathode for simultaneous solar energy conversion, electrochemical energy storage, and self-powered sensing application. The ZnO@BiOI photoanode exhibited enhanced photon absorption and better electron–hole separation. Under illumination, the developed PFC device exhibited the maximum power output density of 155 μW cm−2 with a high open circuit potential of 0.48 V. More importantly, the energy generation could be readily read out through recognizing the color variations in the PB cathode. By virtue of the electrochromic PB, a self-powered sensing platform with multiple readable quantitative information was achieved based on the charge quenching transfer of Cu2+ toward the photoanode and the strong chelation between PPi and Cu2+. Meanwhile, the specific dual signal outputs endue the proposed method with more choices for the quantified readout as well as enhanced reliability. In particular, the presented PFC based self-powered sensing platform can be accomplished in a simple, economical, and rapid manner for assaying without the need for any expensive and sophisticated instruments. Herein we believe that our work may provide an alternative approach for future practical applications in environmental monitoring, security inspection, personalized healthcare, and clinical diagnostics.
