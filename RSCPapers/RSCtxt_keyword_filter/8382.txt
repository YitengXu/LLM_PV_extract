    , Accepted 6th May 2013First published on 8th May 2013AbstractSnS nanosheets (NSs), SnS nanowires (NWs) and SnS2 nanosheets were synthesized and investigated as counter electrode (CE) catalysts in a I3−/I− based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) system for the first time. It is found that the SnS NS based DSCs show comparable power-conversion efficiency (Eff = 6.56%) to Pt (7.56%), while the Eff of SnS NW and SnS2 NS based DSCs are 5.00% and 5.14% respectively, indicating the excellent catalytic activity of SnSx for the reduction of triiodide to iodide.
In the past decade, energy crisis and global warming related to the burning of fossil fuels attracted people's attention. As some of the most promising devices to convert solar energy directly to electric power, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have become the focus of attention due to their clean and pollution-free nature, low consumption, easy fabrication and powerful harvesting efficiency.1 Generally, a typical DSC is composed of a sensitizer dye adsorbed nanocrystalline TiO2 anode, an electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple and a counter electrode (CE).2 As one of the most important components in the DSCs, the CE collects the electron from the external circuit, and catalyzes the reduction of triiodide ions.3 It is well known that platinum (Pt) shows a very good performance as a superior CE material due to its excellent catalytic activity and high electrical conductivity. However, the limited reserves and high cost of Pt severely restrict the large-scale application of DSCs.4 Therefore, exploring cheap and high performance substitutes for Pt has become a topic of interest.
Since 1996, a great deal of effort has been made to develop alternative noble metal-free materials, such as carbon materials5 and conducting polymers.6 Recently, several inorganic materials have attracted people's attention and have been explored as CEs in DSCs, such as CoS,7 MoS2,8 WS2,9 NiS,10 Fe2O3,11 TiN,12 NiSe2 (ref. 13), etc. Compared to other inorganic materials, chalcogenides have unique properties such as material diversity, abundance, low cost, high catalytic activity and excellent electrical conductivity. Tin sulfides, which include several compounds such as SnS, SnS2, Sn2S3, Sn3S4 and Sn4S5, have attracted more interest owing to their structural multiformity,14 appealing catalytic activity and high electrical conductivity demonstrated in lithium batteries,15 photovoltaic applications16 and so on. To the best of our knowledge, no research on the use of SnSx as CEs in DSCs has been reported so far.
Herein, we synthesized SnS nanosheets (SnS NSs) and applied them as CE materials in DSCs for the first time. The SnS NSs were synthesized via a modified two-step method, by thermal decomposition of a molecular precursor (tin diethyldithiocarbamate, Na-DEDTC).17 Meanwhile, we also prepared SnS nanowires (SnS NWs) and SnS2 nanosheets (SnS2 NSs) by hydrothermal methods. Compared with Pt or some other CE materials, SnSx synthesized by these strategies is low-cost, innocuous and maneuverable. As a result, the SnS NSs showed excellent catalytic activity for triiodide reduction, surpassing that of the SnS NWs and SnS2 NSs. And the power-conversion efficiency (Eff) of the DSC with a SnS NS CE is 6.56%, which is comparable to Pt (7.57%), while the Eff of the other two are 5.00% and 5.14% respectively.
The morphology of SnSx samples (SnS NSs, SnS NWs and SnS2 NSs) were analyzed using typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 1. The high magnification image clearly shows that the SnS NSs synthesized via the modified two-step method have a hexagonal shape, and the mean diameter is in the range of 50–150 nm (see Fig. 1a), which can be confirmed from the TEM image (see Fig. 1d). The flake-like morphology is mainly caused by the intrinsic anisotropic growth of SnS crystals. SnS2 NSs synthesized by the hydrothermal synthesis method show a similar hexagonal shape with a smaller size, and the mean diameter ranges from 20 nm to 30 nm (see Fig. 1b and e), which is similar to that reported in the literature.15Fig. 1c and f show that the SnS nanowires have a distinctive wire-like morphology, and their homogeneity is inferior to SnS NSs and SnS2 NSs. From the XRD pattern (see Fig. S1, ESI†) of the SnS NSs, it can be seen that all diffraction peaks of the typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern match well with those of SnS (JCPDS no. 75-1803). All diffraction peaks of SnS NWs and SnS2 NSs are also in agreement with the PDF database (SnS2: 40–1467; SnS: 65–3812).

Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSCs with different CEs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of DSCs based on SnS NS CEs are 17.70 mA cm−2, 740 mV and 0.50, respectively, yielding an overall energy conversion efficiency (Eff) of 6.56%. And the photovoltaic characteristics of DSCs based on Pt CEs are Jsc: 17.50 mA cm−2; Voc: 720 mV; FF: 0.60; and Eff: 7.57%. The Jsc for the DSCs with SnS NS CEs is slightly higher than that of Pt CEs, which means that the SnS NS CEs have a higher electrical conductivity and a better electrocatalytic activity towards I3−/I− redox pairs.18 Also, the Voc of SnS NS CEs is 740 mV, and has an improvement of 20 mV compared with Pt CEs. The higher Voc of SnS NSs may be due to the more interfacial active sites of SnS NS CEs and the higher proton concentration in the case of Pt CEs. The above results demonstrate that SnS NS CEs possess not only high electrical conductivity to promote the electron translocation but also excellent electrocatalytic activity to reduce triiodide to iodide. Meanwhile, the energy conversion efficiency of SnS2 NS and SnS NW CEs is inferior to that of SnS NS CEs. The Jscs were also lower compared with SnS NS CEs, which indicate that their electrical conductivity is lower than that of SnS NS CEs.

I–V characteristics of the DSCs using SnS NS, SnS2 NS, SnS NW and Pt CEs. 
To further investigate the electrochemical characteristics of excellent SnS NSs and Pt electrodes, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out with symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE//electrolyte//CE) at 293 K, and the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells are shown in Fig. 3. The values of the series resistance (Rs) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) obtained by fitting the spectra with an EIS spectrum analyzer are summarized in Table 1. The equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental EIS data is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. It is well known that the catalytic activity of the electrodes can be reflected from the Rct in the electrode/electrolyte interface, which is directly proportional to the diameter of the semicircle in the high-frequency regions.12 The Rct of SnS NS CEs is 0.94 Ω, smaller than that of Pt CEs (4.51 Ω), which means a better catalytic activity, and can explain why the energy conversion efficiency of DSCs using SnS NS CEs is comparable to that of Pt CEs. The high-frequency intercept on the real axis (X′ axis) represents Rs, which is mainly composed of the bulk resistance of CE materials, the resistance of the FTO glass substrate, and the contact resistance. The Rs of SnS NS CEs is 6.34 Ω, smaller than that of Pt CEs (10.67 Ω), which means that SnS NS CEs have a faster electron transfer kinetics and better electrical conductivity than Pt CEs, and is also consistent with the tendency of the observed Jsc. Cdl stands for the double layer capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte interface because of the accumulation of ions at the electrode surface. Zw stands for Warburg impedance, which arises from mass transport limitations due to diffusion of the triiodide/iodide couple in the electrolytes.2 The Zw of SnS NS CEs is 87.06 Ω, much larger than that of Pt CEs (4.51 Ω), which means a large diffusion impedance, and can explain why the fill factor (FF) of DSCs using SnS NS CEs is lower than that of Pt CEs.
 Fig. 3  EIS data of the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical SnS NS and Pt electrodes. 
To evaluate the electrocatalytic properties of the as prepared SnSx, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system (see Fig. 4). For SnSx, typical curves with two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks were obtained as reported in the previous literature.19 The left peak corresponds to the redox reaction in eqn (1), while the right peak corresponds to the reaction in eqn (2). I3− + 2e = 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e = 2I3−(2)The CV profile and the peak positions of SnS NSs are similar to Pt, which indicates similar catalytic activities. Moreover, the SnS NS CE has a smaller peak-to-peak splitting (Epp = 255 mV) than that of Pt-CE (Epp = 260 mV), suggesting that the electrocatalytic activity and reversibility of the I3−/I− redox reaction on the SnS NS CE are better than those of the Pt CE, which is in accordance with the results of EIS analysis. However the lower peak current density of SnS NS CE peaks reveals that the cathodic peak area is slightly smaller than that of the Pt CE, which corresponds to the energy conversion efficiency. Although, the peak-to-peak splitting of SnS2 NS CEs (Epp = 180 mV) is the smallest of the synthesized SnSx, the current density of SnS2 NSs is the lowest, which results in inferior energy conversion efficiency. SnS NW CEs have the opposite peak-to-peak splitting (Epp = 396 mV) and current density, leading to a similar energy conversion efficiency to the SnS2 NS CE based DSCs. Meanwhile, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the SnS2 NS and SnS NW CEs are much lower than those of SnS NS CEs, which is attributed to the inferior electrocatalytic ability of the I3−/I− redox reaction. SnS NS CEs have the appropriate peak-to-peak splitting and current density. The synergistic effect of those properties causes the high energy conversion efficiency, suggesting that the reversibility of the I3−/I− redox reaction on SnS NS CEs is great, leading to the high electrocatalytic activity.

In summary, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that SnSx are effective in catalyzing the reduction of triiodide to iodide in a DSC, superseding Pt as an electrocatalyst. The DSCs based on the SnS NS CE reached a energy conversion efficiency of 6.56%, comparable to that of the DSC using a Pt CE (7.57%). Furthermore, the low cost and environmentally friendly properties of the SnS NSs would be very promising to accelerate the large-scale applications of DSCs in the future.
