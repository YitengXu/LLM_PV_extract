    , Accepted 14th December 2021First published on 14th December 2021AbstractThe recently described monodimensional hybrid pseudo-perovskite ((CH3)3SO)PbI3 exhibits complete Pb2+/Bi3+ miscibility in the B site. Heterovalent substitution imposes that charge-compensating defects are introduced in the lattice as well. This paper reports the energetics of point defects and the interaction between charge-compensating defects that occur upon Bi3+ doping in ((CH3)3SO)PbI3. Periodic DFT simulations were employed to analyze the formation energy of Pb2+ vacancies, (CH3)3SO+ vacancies, iodide vacancies, or the insertion of interstitial iodide ions. Solid solutions with a large Bi3+ content were modeled considering different charge compensation defects (Pb2+ vacancies, (CH3)3SO+ vacancies, and interstitial iodide) to consider electrical neutrality. Both the formation energy evaluation and the structural parameters after relaxation are in very good agreement with available experimental data (both X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy), confirming that Pb2+ vacancies are indeed the primary ionic charge-compensation mechanism leading to solid solutions described by the formula ((CH3)3SO)3Pb3xBi2(1−x)V(1−x)I9 (0 < x < 1), where V indicates a B site vacancy. As a consequence of the complete miscibility, the defect concentration at intermediate compositions is considerable, and it is probably responsible for various peculiar structural effects observed, e.g., in ((CH3)3SO)3Pb0.99Bi1.34I9, which are related to short-range order phenomena in the chain composition. Atomistic simulations were then carried out to estimate defect–defect interactions as a function of their respective positions inside the linear PbI6/BiI6 octahedral chains. The resulting bond energies for atom pairs and triads effectively explain the relative stability of defect clusters. This approach is expected to shed light on the short-range order in this class of doped materials, but it can be extended to other structures as well. The understanding of defect structures and control of structural and electronic properties have implications for the engineering of doped materials, which find vast applications in optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Property engineering of existing materials is at the forefront of hybrid halide perovskites’ research. Although this class of compounds have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies in the last decade for energy applications such as photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, laser, and detector devices, the achieved performances are still not adequate for large-scale use.1,2 Among the functional properties that need to be modulated to enhance the performance, the most important are chemical and thermal stability, optical bandgap, and carrier mobility. All of them can be considerably modified by reducing the connectivity of the inorganic scaffold:3–5 the three-dimensional ABX3 perovskite framework composed of corner-sharing [BX6] octahedra can be broken down into one, two, or three dimensions, resulting in 2D, 1D, or 0D lower-dimensional structures respectively (more properly described as pseudo-perovskites).6 These materials are appealing due to their unique characteristics: they are generally chemically stable in air and moisture unlike 3D hybrid halides and exhibit unprecedented tunability in the electronic structure. However, they often feature wide band gaps and low charge concentration, low mobility, or both, all of which are undesirable for applications. Due to the high structural flexibility and defect tolerance of these compounds, compositional engineering is a powerful tool to overcome the actual shortcomings of pseudo-perovskites. The presence of any kind of impurity (e.g., intrinsic defects and dopant atoms) in a periodic lattice is bound to influence the performance of a perovskite-based device. The intentional introduction of dopants is usually aimed to enhance the charge transport properties of the pristine compound. It can also introduce intrinsic or charge-compensating defects that can severely limit the efficiency of optoelectronic devices by acting as carrier recombination centers.7,8 Since countless combinations of (multiple) dopants in different lattice sites could in principle be considered, ab initio modelization methods of such systems are of fundamental importance to direct the experimental efforts in the right direction.7 To date, most theoretical studies have been devoted to the study of homovalent doping in 3D perovskites. Heterovalent doping has remained relatively less studied until recently due to the complexity of the charge compensation mechanisms that must be considered. In particular, bismuth has been investigated as a donor dopant for various inorganic and hybrid 3D perovskites.9–16
Bi3+ doping in 3D perovskites (most notably, methylammonium lead iodide or bromide – MAPbI3 or MAPbBr3) is a debated topic, since the experimentally determined charge carrier concentration is orders of magnitude lower than expected from Bi donor concentration. Rakita et al.15 examined several possible causes for this behavior, including the formation of stable defect pairs, or thermodynamic and kinetic instability of the defects. An interpretation of the lattice parameter changes in MAPbI3 after Bi doping has been proposed very recently, using the elastic properties of the bulk and DFT simulations. Different point defects compensating for Bi3+ are possible, whose nature is, however, still unclear.13 In MAPbI3, most studies attribute the formation of deep traps to Bi3+ doping, hindering electron transport;14,16 it was also proposed that the Bi donors shift the Fermi level instead, causing, in turn, an increased concentration of I-interstitials.10 A careful control of the synthetic conditions was therefore proposed to balance the opposing tendencies towards I-vacancy and I-interstitial formation. In the following, we also discuss the effect of the iodine chemical potential on the formation energy of the various point defects. In any case, the metal site doping of pseudo-perovskites with lower connectivity remains nearly unexplored both experimentally and theoretically. Their substantially higher stability than 3D structures opens new possibilities to achieve extremely high defect concentrations in the bulk, kinetically and/or thermodynamically stabilized.15
In this work, we carried out a periodic ab initio study of the energetics of heterovalent Bi3+ doping and defect creation in a trimethylsulfoxonium (TMSO) 1D pseudo perovskite (TMSO)PbI3. The presence of sulfur-based aprotic cations leads to lower-dimensional, highly air-stable compounds. The alkylammonium cations, in contrast, result in highly hygroscopic hybrid compounds, vulnerable to moisture degradation.17 For instance, the use of TMSOPbI3 in 1D/3D photovoltaic devices employing CH3NH3PbI3 has been recently reported to lead to increased performance and moisture resistance.18 We recently described the crystal structure and phase diagram of the (TMSO)PbX3/(TMSO)3Bi2X9 system with X = (I, Br), reporting complete miscibility of Pb2+/Bi3+ in the B-site throughout the composition range.19 This work explores the defect formation mechanisms needed to compensate for the difference in charge between lead and bismuth. Our simulations show that the formation of Pb2+ vacancies for each two Bi3+ dopant atoms is the most probable mechanism, confirming the previous assumption from XRD data. The electronic band structure of the Bi-doped compounds shows the presence of deep trap defect states in the bandgap below the conduction band. The different possible configurations for the dopant and defects among chains are also considered to evaluate the interaction between adjacent B sites in the structure. These interactions will affect the optoelectronic properties and bandgap of the doped materials, and eventually determine their stability and performance in possible applications in e.g. solar cells or thermoelectric devices.
While the insertion of Bi3+ cations in the perovskite B-site gives rise to a single phase roughly following the Vegard law, very peculiar X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) peak shapes are observed at higher Bi content hinting at significant short-range order, driven by first neighbor interactions between B-sites.19 Atomistic simulations were therefore carried out to study the energetics of different defect configurations in highly defective supercells. Accordingly, this study enables bridging the gap between the short-order phenomena and functional properties of ((CH3)3SO)3Pb3xBi2(1−x)V(1−x)I9 (0 < x < 1) solid solutions, providing a precious tool to guide in the development of better performing hybrid pseudo-perovskites for green energy applications.
2. Methods
Periodic ab initio quantum mechanical calculations were carried out with density functional theory (DFT) using the PWscf package in the Quantum Espresso suite.20–22 Kohn–Sham equations are solved with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA),23 adopting the PBE exchange–correlation functional24 within the Projector Augmented Wave method (PAW),25 with an energy cutoff of 50 Ry.
A TMSOPbI3 2 × 1 × 1 supercell containing 144 atoms was fully relaxed and used as a starting point for further calculations. All structure relaxations and single-point calculations were carried out on centered 2 × 2 × 2 and 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack (MP) grids, respectively. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) was considered for lead, bismuth, and iodide atoms in the band structure calculations. The convergence threshold criteria are as follows: 10−6 a.u. for electronic structure, 10−4 a.u. for total energy, 10−2 a.u. for forces, and 0.5 kbar for pressure.
The energy of charged defects in supercells was corrected using the correction schemes implemented in the program CoFFEE: Corrections For Formation Energy and Eigenvalues.26 Sample stoichiometries (from ICP-OES and XRF) and lattice parameters (from powder XRD) discussed in Section 3.4 and shown in Fig. 5 are taken from ref. 19. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of (TMSO)3Pb0.99Bi1.34I9 were acquired at beamline LISA of the ESRF and analyzed with Viper.27

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Undoped (TMSO)PbI3
(TMSO)PbI3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma space group (Fig. 1a). Each Pb2+ cation is octahedrally coordinated to six iodide anions [PbI6]. The octahedra are connected throughout faces, with each iodide bound to two lead cations with Pb–I distances between 3.16 and 3.26 Å. The resulting infinite [PbI3]∞ polyanionic chains form the framework of a one-dimensional structure. The chains run parallel to the a-axis, so the Pb–Pb distance (3.91 Å) corresponds to half of the a lattice parameter (7.82 Å). The [PbI3]∞ chains are interspersed with TMSO cations, leading to a 1D pseudo-perovskite structure. The supercell approach was then used to calculate the formation energy of point defects. The unit cell contains four TMSOPbI3 formula units, so the content of the undefective unit cell is described as (TMSO)4Pb4I12, where the four Pb2+ ions reside in two parallel linear chains. Due to its size, the crystallographic structure was replicated along the a direction (i.e., the short axis), leading to a (TMSO)8Pb8I24 2 × 1 × 1 supercell (Fig. 1b). The a direction choice leads to two linear chains containing four Pb2+ sites each. Structural relaxation of this supercell (a = 15.66 Å, b = 11.57 Å, and c = 14.72 Å) results in a slightly larger volume than the experimental one (+0.16%, +3.35%, and +2.36% on each axis, respectively). The optimized supercell structure is used as a reference for all calculations hereafter. Due to the satisfactory agreement with experimental data, no further corrections (due to e.g. van der Waals forces) were included. For an in-depth discussion of dispersion interactions in halide perovskites, see ref. 28.
3.2 Point defects in the dilute limit
To investigate the relative stability of defects in the (TMSO)PbI3 lattice, the choice of the chemical potential is essential to calculate the defect formation energy. Indeed, it must ensure the stability of the perovskite against precipitation of elemental phases (e.g., metallic Pb) and secondary phases (e.g., PbI2), leading to boundary conditions that define acceptable ranges for chemical potentials (see the ESI†). In the following, the chemical potential of element X (μX) is chosen with respect to the standard chemical potential as . The  values are calculated from elemental phases.
These boundary conditions can be partially represented graphically by a phase diagram. We evaluate the relative stability of defects in three different conditions inside the (TMSO)PbI3 stability regions (Fig. S1, ESI†): Bi-rich (1), Pb-rich (2), and I-rich conditions (3).
The formation energy of a defect in a semiconductor is expressed as29 Eform = Edefect − Epristine − ΣnμX + q(EVBM + EF) + qEcorr(1)where Edefect and Epristine are the total energy of the defective and undefective supercells, respectively; n is the number of atoms introduced or removed from the pristine supercell; μX is the chemical potential of the exchanged element; q is the defect charge; and EF is the Fermi level (chemical potential of electrons) relative to the energy maximum of the valence band EVBM. The Ecorr term represents the correction for the electrostatic interaction of a charged defect with its periodic images.
Various strategies to correct the formation energy of charged defects have been developed in the last two decades and extensively tested on simple semiconductors,30–32 and their shortcomings were critically examined by Castleton et al.33
The formation energies of point defects are shown in Fig. 2. For each point defect, the most stable charge state is shown as a function of the Fermi level, and the charge reflects on the slope of Eform.
The iodine vacancy turns out to be the most energetically favorable intrinsic defect in almost any condition. The formation of iodine vacancies has been recently proved to enhance the ionic conductivity of (CH3NH3)PbI3 under illumination.34 The enhancement is driven by defect-mediated ion migration: this kind of effect has been reported to be beneficial for the cell efficiency,35–37 although the long-term stability of the perovskite scaffold may suffer as a consequence. It could also affect the conductivity in thermoelectric applications, where poor electrical transport is a significant issue in pseudo-perovskites.
All the charge level transitions within the defect (e.g., from  to ), whose energy is independent of μX, are reported in Fig. 3a. While VI and BiPb don’t present charge transition within the bandgap, VPb and VTMSO are deep donors with charge transition in the upper half of the bandgap. Thus they can be a primary source of charge trapping. Iodine interstitials, in contrast, are shallow donors with charge transition near the conduction band. Nevertheless, even if these defects can trap and scatter charge carriers, their formation energy is relatively high in all the selected conditions, and therefore unlikely to be found in appreciable concentrations. The lowest-energy donor–acceptor defect couples (e.g., from  to ) can pin the Fermi level: the position of each couple under different chemical potential conditions is illustrated in Fig. 3b. All the synthetic conditions chosen tune the Fermi level towards n-type semiconductors. Moreover, in excess of iodine, all the donor–acceptor pairs lie immediately below the CBM, creating several near states that can more easily de-trap charges and help in carrier transport.
3.3. 
           defects and the charge compensation mechanisms
Upon bismuth doping, it is expected that the Bi3+ cation substitutes Pb2+ forming a  defect. While the rare +5 oxidation state may exist for bismuth in some oxides, only the +3 state has been reported so far in its chlorides, bromides, and iodides.38 The difference in charge between the two cations invokes a charge compensation mechanism to preserve electroneutrality. For this reason, either vacancy or interstitial (ionic compensation) or electron or hole (electronic compensation) defects must also be introduced. The former is known to be more likely to happen for this kind of hybrid structure;39 thus in this work, three possible mechanisms involving ionic compensation with negatively charged defects were considered, described by the following Kröger–Vink equations:
(i) Lead vacancy:  (2)
(ii) TMSO vacancy:  (3)
(iii) I interstitial:  (4)
The above mechanisms (depicted in Fig. 4) involve forming a negative defect to compensate for the positively charged Bi3+ dopant. As a consequence, neutral defect complexes are formed overall. In particular, mechanism (i) was previously assumed – from stereochemical considerations – to be the primary charge compensation mechanism.19 To corroborate this hypothesis and evaluate the possibility of coexisting charge compensation mechanisms, a computational study on the energy formation and the geometrical parameters for these defect complexes is carried out in the following.
3.4. Ionic compensation mechanisms: Eb and structure parameters
Bi-Doped TMSOPbI3 is best described as a continuous solid solution between TMSOPbI3 and (TMSO)3Bi2I9.19 In this respect, the supercells described below are realistic descriptions of the structure and composition of the doped compounds at various Bi levels between 12% and 67%. This means that there are no spurious interactions between periodic images of the defects to be taken into account.
For mechanism (i), introducing two bismuth atoms and one vacancy in the 8 B sites of the pristine supercell (TMSO8Pb8I24) results in a TMSO8Pb5Bi2I24 composition (28.6% doping level). A higher doping level is also possible within the same supercell for this mechanism: the substitution of six Pb2+ by four Bi3+ and two vacancies, resulting in TMSO8Pb2Bi4I24 (66.7 Bi%). Since the experimental evidence shows the formation of a single phase throughout the phase diagram (from 0 to 100% Bi),19 both dopant percentages were considered. In the same fashion, the two lowest possible doping levels for mechanisms (ii) and (iii) have been investigated leading to composition described by TMSO7Pb7BiI24 (Bi = 12.5%) and TMSO6Pb6Bi2I24 (Bi = 25%) for the TMSO vacancy, and TMSO8Pb7BiI25 (Bi = 12.5%) and TMSO8Pb6Bi2I26 (Bi = 25%) for the interstitial iodide. As two or three defects are contemporary present in the cell, several different configurations arise, depending on the position of the defects with respect to each other. For simplicity, just one configuration for (i), (ii), and (iii) was considered. In each case, once the charge compensating defect (VPb, VTMSO, or Ii) is placed, all the different configurations were evaluated by placing the BiPb defect in each of the possible inequivalent sites. Among all possible defect configurations, it is found that he lowest energy configurations for each mechanism are those where the bismuth atom(s) and the compensating defect(s) are as close as possible, and they were then used for further calculation.
The binding energy (Eb) of each neutral defect complex is calculated as Eb(X + Y) = Eform(X + Y) − Eform(X) − Eform(Y)(5)where Eform is the formation energy of the defect in its neutral charge state. The formation energies for the defects described in eqn (2)–(4) are calculated as described in Section 3.2. The binding energy values obtained are reported in Table 1. All the neutral defect complexes show negative binding energy, which indicates a high probability of formation of defect complexes compared to individual defects. Among the three possible mechanisms, the one involving  (mechanism (i)) is much more favored, with markedly lower binding energy (−4.62 eV) than the others (−2.17 and −1.35 eV). These outcomes confirm eqn (2), the lead vacancy, as the major compensation mechanism for the (TMSO)PbI3 – (TMSO)3Bi2I9 solid solutions.

Further evidence for mechanism (i) comes from comparing the geometrical parameters (both cell parameters and bond distances) of the relaxed structures and the experimental data. The cell parameters of the relaxed cells are also compared to the experimental trend reported recently.19 The experimental X-ray diffraction data acquired over the whole Pb/Bi composition range show a significant contraction of only a lattice parameter (i.e., the direction along which the chains are oriented). In contrast, the b and c parameters (normal to the chains) remain unchanged upon doping. These trends of a, b, c, and V parameters against the %Bi of the experimental data are reported in Fig. 5 and compared to the one obtained from the relaxation of the supercell herein described. As expected, mechanism (i), which heavily affects the chain composition along a, shows trends qualitatively in good agreement with the experimental trend.
Mechanisms (ii) and (iii) are not expected to influence the chains significantly as the difference in the ionic radii between Pb and Bi is only 0.16 Å. The b and c cell parameters, which represent the stacking direction of TMSO molecules and eventually interstitial iodide sites, are the one which undergo significant variation in these cases. The experimentally determined lattice parameters (in black in Fig. 5) indicate a substantial contraction of the a-axis with increasing Bi content. The calculated lattice parameters clearly show that only mechanism (i) can reproduce the correct contraction along a and not along the other axes. This corroborates mechanism (i) as the primary charge compensation mechanism after Bi insertion in the lattice, leading to solid solutions described by the stoichiometry (TMSO)3Pb3xBi2(1−x)I9 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1).
The relaxed atomic positions of the (TMSO)8Pb2Bi4I24 supercell, containing two defect clusters , are in very good agreement with the experimentally determined Bi–I and Pb–I from X-ray absorption spectroscopy on (TMSO)3Pb0.99Bi1.34I9. First and foremost, the EXAFS results unequivocally confirm that Bi3+ ions substitute Pb2+ in a (slightly distorted) octahedral cavity.
Fittings are shown in Fig. 6 and the Pb–I and Bi–I average distances and bond length variances are summarized in Table 2. It is worth noting that the high bond length variance (10−2 Å) arises from two different contributions: the one probed by DFT (at 0 K) represents only static disorder, coming from the different “frozen” bond lengths spread around the average. The experimentally probed disorder is both static and thermal instead, as it also comes from vibrationally elongated and shortened bonds. It can be concluded that: the disorder in BiI6 distorted octahedra is significant and essentially static in nature, arising from different Bi–I bonds; PbI6 octahedra, in contrast, are fairly regular, and their disorder is almost all vibrational. In any case, the difference between these kinds of disorders is lost at room temperature, and all metal–iodide correlations end up having a similar high variance. These results show no evidence of DY centers (negative defect complexes featuring a heavily distorted Bi environment and longer Bi–I bonds) described in MAPBr.40

3.5. Interactions between metal cation sites: atomistic simulations

Fig. 7 shows a schematic depiction of the local structure around a Pb site. Due to the linear arrangement of octahedra, in pristine undefective (TMSO)PbI3, each Pb atom has two cation first neighbors at 3.9 Å (red dashes) and two cation second neighbors at 7.8 Å (blue dashes). Farther cation neighbors that reside in adjacent chains at around 9–10 Å and beyond are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Cation–cation distances in (TMSO)PbI3. The Pb–I chains are represented schematically as flat in this diagram to highlight the cation–cation pairs. The first and second neighbor distances are highlighted by red (1N) and blue (2N) dashes, respectively. The color code for atoms is as in Fig. 1. 
Considering that the vacancy formation on the Pb site is the charge compensation mechanism after the insertion of Bi, we study the energetics of the system as a function of all possible atomic arrangements for the  defect complex in a 2 × 1 × 1 supercell. Such a supercell contains 8 cation sites occupied by 5Pb2+, 2 Bi3+, and 1 vacancy, resulting in (TMSO)8Pb5Bi2I24 (x = 0.62, Bi = 28%). All different arrangements of Pb/Bi/V in the supercell resulted in 16 inequivalent configurations (described in full in the ESI†). Among all 16 possible defect configurations, five (A, B, C, I, and P) features differ in their first-neighbor pairs and are depicted in Fig. 8 and detailed in Table 3.

The effect of the cation placement inside a supercell has been recently used in oxide perovskites to explain the bandgap reduction as a function of the position of a dopant in the cation sublattice.41 In the following, we apply a similar approach to explore the correlation between the energy of a configuration and the occurrence of B-site pairs and triads inside the 1D chains.
The total energy difference between two given configurations is only due to the different interaction energy terms between cation pairs, everything else (anions, TMSO ions) being equal. The relative energy of each structure is then factorized as Etot = ΣE1N + ΣE2N +ΣEother(6)where E1N represents the interaction energy due to each first-neighbor cation–cation pair (3.9 Å apart) and E2N represents the interaction energy due to a second-neighbor cation–cation correlation (7.8 Å apart), as shown in Fig. 7. Eother describes all farther cation–cation interactions between adjacent chains. These are neglected in the following discussion since each cation–cation interaction between adjacent chains is at least two orders of magnitude less important than between first neighbors (see the ESI† for details). E1N and E2N contain five different terms each (i.e., Pb–Pb, Pb–Bi, Bi–Bi, Pb–V, and Bi–V) for the first- and second-neighbor interactions; this results in ten additional energy terms being responsible for all calculated energy differences between configurations. As an example, the following equations show Etot factorization for configurations A and B:Etot,A = 4E1,Pb–Pb + 2E1,Pb–Bi + 2E1,V–Bi + 4E2,Pb–Pb + 2E2,Bi–Bi + 2E2,V–PbEtot,B = 4E1,Pb–Pb + 1E1,Bi–Bi + 1E1,Pb–Bi + 1E1,V–Bi + 1E1,V–Pb + 4E2,Pb–Pb + 2E2,Pb–Bi + 2E2,V–Bi
The DFT simulations give Etot values for each A, B, … configuration (reported in the ESI†), resulting in a sparse and noisy linear system with ten unknowns (the energy terms described above).
The relative energy fluctuates by about 1.5 eV between the lowest and the highest energy configurations, representing the order of magnitude of the energy due to cation placement. Comparing those configurations with the same first-neighbor cation correlations (E1N), and that differ only for E2N contributions (e.g., D and E), it can be seen that their energies differ by about 0.06–0.15 eV. As it is expected, E2N has relatively low importance in determining bond energy, and cation–cation first neighbor interactions dominate the total energy differences.
After solving the linear system described above, the ten energy contribution terms due to each Pb–Pb, Pb–Bi, etc., can be derived (shown in Table 4). These represent the relative energy of each M–M first neighbor or second neighbor pair occurring in the structure.

As a validation of the robustness of such an approach, the pair contributions to energy E1N and E2N reported in Table 3 can be used to re-calculate the energy of all 16 possible configurations and compare these with the values obtained with DFT. This procedure yields values that are self-consistent down to a 0.05 eV accuracy.
A few interesting considerations can then be summarized from inspection of Table 4: (a) the most relevant energy costs are due to Pb–V pairs and Bi–Bi clusterization; (b) Bi–V pairs, in contrast, are energetically favored (they are the only pairs with the negative sign); (c) the clusterization of Pb–Pb is the most likely consequence, segregating (Bi/V)-rich regions to avoid Pb–V pairs; (d) interactions between second neighbors are in general significantly lower with respect to the first neighbors, but not negligible, especially for Bi–Bi pairs, providing an observable basis for the second-order Markov chain analysis.
The stochastic matrix elements can then be calculated for every non-equivalent configuration of defects in (TMSO)8Pb5Bi2I24. The lowest-energy configurations have large matrix elements for V–Bi → Pb, Pb–V → Bi and Bi–V → Pb; in contrast, large matrix elements for Bi–Bi → Pb, Pb–Bi → Bi and Pb–V → Pb are all associated with the highest-energy configurations.
Further validation of the energy contributions of Table 4 was carried out on a 2 × 1 × 1 supercell with a higher Bi content, (TMSO)8Pb2Bi4I24 (x = 0.25, Bi = 75%), to investigate the possibility to extend these energy terms to a different composition. A (TMSO)8Pb2Bi4I24 2 × 1 × 1 supercell contains one defect complex , which can be arranged within the 8 B sites. We then compared the total calculated DFT energy of four different configurations, labeled AB to AF, all having very different first neighbor arrangements; for consistency, the energy is reported relative to configuration A of (TMSO)8Pb5Bi2I24 and corrected for composition by suitable addition of chemical potentials. These energy values were compared to those calculated by applying equation (6), all reported in Table 5. They show a remarkable correlation, with a linear slope of 1.1. Such chemical transferability between very distant compositions (i.e. (TMSO)8Pb5Bi2I24 and (TMSO)8Pb2Bi4I24) shows that the approach described above is robust and describes satisfactorily realistic solid solutions with a tunable concentration of interacting point defects in a wide range.

3.6. Effect of Bi doping on the density of states
The substitution of lead with bismuth causes a significant reduction of the optical band gap as observed by UV/vis spectroscopy (in particular, a 0.54 eV reduction for (TMSO)3Pb2.67Bi0.22I9 compared to the undoped sample).19 As shown in Fig. 9, the Bi–I states at the CBM band lay around 1 eV lower than the corresponding Pb–I states (in A configuration). In addition, the latter are also split due to the inequivalent Pb sites (closer or farther away from defect sites) arising in the structure. The effect of the different configurations on DOS, and thus on the predicted bandgap, is considerable. As reported in Fig. 10, other configurations have Bi–I states at different energies, thus reducing the bandgap in different ways. Such a difference between experimental and predicted bandgap arises from the different chemical environments for lead and bismuth, which split and spread throughout the bandgap of the Bi–I and Pb–I states. Configurations A, M, and N all feature equivalent local environments for the two bismuth atoms in the structure and two different local environments for the lead atoms: both effects limit the splitting between the electronic levels. In particular, configuration A features the same local environment for both Bi sites, limiting the energy spread of Bi–I levels in the bandgap, resulting in the best agreement between the experimental (0.54 eV) and modeled (0.4 eV) bandgap reduction upon doping. These results leave room to explore the engineering of the bandgap of doped TMSOPbI3 by developing a synthetic tool to control the Bi3+ position in the lattice: different configurations can lead to different bandgap values. Moreover, Bi–I states belonging to Bi sites with the same first neighbors have similar, but not identical, energy positions (e.g. configuration G). The second neighbors may therefore also be important in determining the states close to the Fermi level. Thus, it is possible to control the bandgap of the material from wide to very low (e.g., in configurations M and N) and then to control the relevant technological properties of the perovskites, e.g., power conversion efficiency.42

The experimental features that correlate with the DOS close to the bandgap can be found in the ultraviolet or inverse photoelectron spectra. A proper detailed correlation between these surface spectroscopy measurements and the ab initio calculations on prototype lead halide perovskites (e.g. MAPbI3) has been developed very recently.43,44
4. Conclusion
Bismuth doping is currently considered as one of the promising routes to fine-tune the electronic properties of lead halide perovskites. We recently described the hybrid (TMSO)3Pb3xBi2(1−x)I9 solid solutions with a monodimensional structure, where the presence of bismuth decreases the optical bandgap even at very low concentrations.19 In this work, we combine evidence from DFT calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy to prove that positively charged Bi3+ defects are compensated by Pb2+ vacancies (as predicted for both MAPbBr345 and CsPbBr314). The formation energy of point defects was calculated at the GGA-PBE level of theory. At the same time, binding energies were also used to evaluate the neutral cluster of defects, which take into account different charge compensation mechanisms. The most energetically favored is the  neutral defect complex, confirming previous hypotheses.19 Atomistic simulations were also carried out to evaluate the differences of placing  and  in supercells, showing that the point defects are preferentially clustered in Bi–V–Bi arrangements in the linear metal halide chains at high Bi concentrations. Therefore, the metal cation sublattice of (TMSO)3Pb3xBi2(1−x)I9 deviates from the ideal solution model, in which competing sites are randomly distributed because of clustering of point defects. In turn, this results in the very peculiar X-ray diffraction peaks with a trapezoidal shape observed at high Bi concentrations (e.g. (TMSO)3Pb0.99Bi1.34I9). We used this hybrid pseudo-perovskite as a case study for its wide compositional range. Still, the same approach can be easily extended to other systems such as inorganic or hybrid (pseudo-)perovskites where a similar interaction between defects needs to be taken into account at moderate dopant concentrations (e.g., 10%).
The introduction of Bi3+ in (TMSO)PbI3 induces the appearance of several donor–acceptor defects in the region immediately below the conduction band, pinning the Fermi level to an n-type semiconductor. Moreover, it causes localized states below the conduction band, observed as lowered bandgaps in optical absorption experiments. We demonstrate that the effects of the position of the Bi3+ dopant in the lattice are essential for accurate bandgap prediction. Moreover, analysis of the different configurations highlights the possibility of modulating the bandgap of this doped material by engineering the Bi3+ position. Atomic-level engineering of short-range order could have significant consequences for application since it enables the control of doped samples with a bandgap range spanning more than 1 eV.
This approach is expected to shed light on the defect interactions in this class of doped materials and devise strategies to correlate the local structure of the dopants with the electronic structure close to the bandgap. The deeper knowledge of the electronic structure has implications for the engineering of doped materials, which find vast applications in optoelectronic devices.
