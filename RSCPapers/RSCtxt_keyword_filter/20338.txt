    , Accepted 7th September 2017First published on 7th September 2017AbstractQuantum dots (QDs) are very attractive materials for solar cells due to their high absorption coefficients, size dependence and easy tunability of their optical and electronic properties due to quantum confinement. Particularly interesting are PbS QDs owing to their broad spectral absorption until long wavelengths, their easy processability and low cost. Here, we used control of the PbS QD size to understand charge transfer processes at the interfaces of a NiO semiconductor and explain the optimal QD size in photovoltaic devices. Towards this goal, we have synthesized a series of PbS QDs with different diameters (2.8 nm to 4 nm) and investigated charge transfer dynamics by time resolved spectroscopy and their ability to act as sensitizers in nanocrystalline NiO based solar cells using the cobalt tris(4,4′-ditert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) complex as a redox mediator. We found that PbS QDs with an average diameter of 3.0 nm show the highest performance in terms of efficient charge transfer and light harvesting efficiency. Our study showed that hole injection from the PbS QDs to the NiO valence band (VB) is an efficient process even with low injection driving force (−0.3 eV) and occurs in 6–10 ns. Furthermore we found that direct electrolyte reduction (photoinduced electron transfer to the cobalt redox mediator) also occurs in parallel to the hole injection with a rate constant of similar magnitude (10–20 ns). In spite of its large driving force, the rate constant of the oxidative quenching of PbS by Co(III) diminishes more steeply than hole injection on NiO when the diameter of PbS increases. This is understood as the consequence of increasing the trap states that limit electron shift. We believe that our detailed findings will advance the future design of QD sensitized photocathodes.
Introduction
The design of novel sensitized NiO photocathodes with wide visible light absorption and good stability is of great significance for tandem dye sensitized solar cells1 and for photoelectrochemical devices for hydrogen evolution2 or carbon dioxide reduction.3 Indeed, the development of efficient and stable photocathodes that can successfully achieve the above practical applications is still a great challenge. Quantum dots (QDs) are very attractive light collectors to sensitize wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO24 (n-type semiconductor) or NiO (p-type semiconductor) as there are several successful demonstrations of their efficiencies in solar cells and in photoelectrocatalytic devices. For example, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) using NiO as the semiconductor have been reported with nanocrystals of CdS,5 CdSe,6 Cu2S,7 CdTeO38 and CuInS2.9 More recently we have reported the potential of PbS10 QDs, notably to exploit the near infrared (IR) region of the solar spectrum which contains about 50% of the solar spectrum photons. Metal chalcogenides were also successfully implemented in NiO based photoelectrocatalytic devices for solar hydrogen evolution.11 These successes clearly illustrate the great potential of quantum dots to act as efficient and stable sensitizers for p-type semiconductors such as NiO. As mentioned above, lead sulfide (PbS) is an attractive material owing to its low bandgap, which makes it very valuable for harvesting low energy photons of the visible spectrum and the near infrared (NIR). The good photovoltaic performance of p-QDSSCs with PbS nanocrystals reported earlier10,12 prompted us to investigate deeper the potential of this system and the operation mechanism of the solar cells. Herein, we have focused on how the photovoltaic performance is determined by the PbS size and investigated in detail the operation principle of p-QDSSCs with time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. In this paper, we demonstrate optimization of QDSSCs by investigating the effect of the size of PbS nanocrystals on the photovoltaic performances. We have identified that hole injection from the PbS QDs to the NiO valence band (VB) occurs in 6–10 ns, while the photoinduced electron transfer to the cobalt redox mediator is on the timescale of 10–20 ns. Accordingly, both processes (photovoltaic and photogalvanic) occur in parallel. Moreover, an important finding of this study is the relatively high hole injection efficiency in NiO in spite of the low driving force (around −0.3 eV).
Results
Preparation of the PbS nanocrystals
The PbS quantum dots used in this study were all synthesized according to the so-called hot injection method using a procedure adapted from Hines and Scholes.13 It is based on the reaction of a solution of lead oleate (Pb(OA)2) with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (TMS)2S as a source of sulfide anions:

  The control of the reaction temperature (between 90 °C and 130 °C) and the concentration of oleic acid (OA) of the initial lead oleate solution enables the quantum dot size to be precisely tuned from 2.8 nm to 3.4 nm (see the ESI† for details). High temperatures and large concentrations of OA promote the formation of large size QDs because the high concentration of OA slows down the kinetics of the nucleation step.13b The quantum dots were purified by three cycles of precipitation into acetone and redispersed in n-octane. The resulting QDs were capped with a monolayer of oleate ligands, and it is known that they contain a significant amount of traps owing to the presence of surface dangling bonds.4f,14 As reported before, these traps were passivated with iodide ligands upon treatment of the PbS quantum dots with a solution of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI).14,15 Indeed, the iodide anion is a sufficiently small ligand to infiltrate inside of the OA shell and to chelate the surface free lead atom. The passivation of these intragap states is crucial to achieve high photovoltaic performance, because they would otherwise quench the exciton, and reduce its lifetime and consequently decrease the quantum yield for charge transfer. Finally, the film was treated with a solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to substitute further some more OA ligands by halides. We have observed that this treatment is crucial to diminish the thickness of the insulating shell of OA and to induce a closer distance between the PbS and NiO surface.10 It also increases the density of QDs grafted onto the NiO surface in the second cycle of loading, most probably by reducing the footprint of the QDs. The QD loading is repeated a second time to maximize the amount of PbS grafted on the NiO surface.
The QD diameter was determined from two independent methods and they were both fully consistent. First, the optical bandgap (Eg) deduced from the absorption spectrum in solution was used to calculate the nanocrystal diameter (d) from the empirical equation reported by Moreels:16 Eg = 0.41 + (0.0252d2 + 0.283d)−1(1)
The optical bandgap (Eg) was calculated from the wavelength on the excitonic peak (λ) according to the equation: Eg(eV) = 1240/λ(nm)(2)
High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is the second technique that was used to determine the size of the PbS nanocrystals (Fig. 1). The TEM images show that all the prepared QDs have a spherical shape and a quite narrow size distribution. The diameters measured on the HRTEM images are in agreement, within experimental error, with the value extracted from the optical bandgap (Table 1 and Table S1†).

Electronic absorption and steady state emission spectra
The electronic properties of the quantum dots capped with OA only (PbS-OA) were first examined with the measurements of their electronic absorption and emission spectra recorded in toluene solution (Fig. 2). The extinction coefficients were calculated from eqn (3) developed by Ozin and co-workers:17 ε(PbS) = 19600r2.32(3)where r is the radius of the PbS nanocrystal. The maximum absorption wavelengths, extinction coefficients and emission wavelengths are collected in Table 1.
 Fig. 2  Absorption (upper panel) and normalized emission (lower panel) spectra of the PbS-OA quantum dots recorded in toluene solution. The samples were excited at 700 nm for all emission spectra. 
The absorption spectra of the PbS quantum dots treated with TBAI (PbS-TBAI) are slightly altered, with a bathochromic shift of about 5 nm on the excitonic peak (see ESI Fig. S1 and Table S2†). This small change does not significantly impact the bandgap and most probably does not affect much the conduction and valence band positions.
Determination of the position of the PbS valence band potential and calculations of the charge transfer Gibbs free energies for the charge transfer reactions
The determination of the position of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) potentials of the PbS QDs is important for calculating the Gibbs free energies of the various charge transfer processes taking place between the PbS nanocrystal and NiO or with the redox mediator. The valence band potentials were determined by recording cyclic voltammetry of the PbS-OA QDs in acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte with a conventional one compartment three electrode setup.18 These experiments were attempted with PbS-TBAI but the wave of the iodide oxidation does not permit one to observe that of PbS. However, owing to the slight variation of the bandgap between PbS-OA and PbS-TBAI (ΔEg = 0.03 eV at maximum), we can reasonably assume that the alteration of the position of the VB upon treatment with TBAI is really weak. A few drops of the colloidal solution of PbS QDs were deposited on the surface of the platinum working electrode and dried in air before cyclic voltammetry was performed. Prominent and highly irreversible cathodic and anodic waves were observed on the voltammograms. The irreversibility of the electrochemical processes is usual for QDs immobilized on electrodes due to the detachment of the QDs from the electrode surface upon oxidation or reduction. A typical voltammogram is shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† All potentials reported in this paper are referenced relative to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and they are collected in Table 1.
The Gibbs free energy of the hole injection reaction into the valence band of NiO (ΔGinj) is the energy associated with the oxidation of NiO and the reduction of PbS corresponding to the difference of the VB potentials of PbS and NiO: ΔGinj = EVB(PbS) − EVB(NiO)(4)
The numerical values of ΔGinj are gathered in Table 2. Clearly, as the diameter of the PbS nanocrystal increases, the hole injection driving force steadily decreases until reaching a low value for d = 3.4 nm (ΔGinj = −0.22 eV).

The free energy of the regeneration reaction (ΔGreg) taking place between the reduced quantum dot and the electrolyte is simply given by the difference of the redox potential of the CoIII/II complex and the conduction band potential of PbS according to the equation: ΔGreg = ECB(PbS) − E(CoIII/II)(5)
The data are summarized in Table 2 and show that this reaction is very exergonic for all sizes of the QDs. Finally, it is also interesting to assess the Gibbs free energy for the reduction of the cobalt electrolyte (ΔGred) from the photoexcited PbS quantum dot. This driving force can be approximately similar to ΔGreg because the one electron reduced QD and the exciton in the photoexcited PbS quantum dot can be considered to have the same reducing power. Again, the calculations indicate that the direct electron transfer from the photoexcited PbS quantum dots to the Co(III) complex in solution is a very thermodynamically favorable reaction.
Overall, the reductions of the Co(III) redox shuttle in the electrolyte either from the reduced QDs or from the photoexcited QDs are both very exergonic processes independent of the size of the PbS nanocrystal, while the hole injection reaction has a much lower driving force, which steeply decreases to very low values as the diameter of the QDs increases.
Photophysical study
The different charge transfer steps potentially involved in the p-DSSCs are summarized in Scheme 1. The main objective of this photophysical study was to give an insight into the photovoltaic mechanism involved in this p-QDSSC via the determination of the rate constants of the charge transfer processes occurring in the system, that is the charge exchange between NiO and the PbS quantum dot (reaction 3) and between PbS and the electrolyte (reaction 4) occurring after light absorption by PbS QDs (reaction 1). Indeed, the exact sequence of the electron transfer chain has never been investigated in quantum dot sensitized NiO semiconductors.

The direction of the arrow indicates the movement of the electron. The rates indicated on the arrows correspond to those measured with PbS-TBAI with diameter = 3.0 nm. 
Upon excitation by light, an exciton is created when an electron is excited from the VB to the CB (reaction 1). The exciton can decay following several pathways. First, radiative decay (reaction 2) or hole injection into NiO can take place (reaction 3). If the hole injection reaction occurs, then the electron residing on the CB of PbS can either recombine with the hole in NiO (reaction 5) or can be shifted to the cobalt(III) complex in solution (reaction 4). Conversely, the photoexcited QDs can first react with the electrolyte and reduce the cobalt(III) complex (reaction 4), then the hole in PbS can be either injected in NiO (reaction 3) or recombine with the cobalt(II) complex in solution (reaction 6). Another important recombination reaction found in NiO based p-DSSCs is the interfacial charge recombination of the redox shuttle in the electrolyte with the injected holes in NiO (reaction 7).19 The sequence of the charge transfer chain has most certainly an impact on the photovoltaic performances of the solar cell. This prompted us to investigate the kinetics of the processes occurring from the photoexcited PbS.
Towards this goal, we have used 3 different sizes of PbS-TBAI nanocrystals with a diameter: 3.0, 3.4 and 4 nm. The 3.0 nm diameter shows the optimal photovoltaic performances, while the 3.4 nm has a weaker power conversion efficiency (PCE), and an additional QD with 4.0 nm which was specially prepared for this study in order to confirm the trend of the photoluminescence measurements. The luminescence lifetime measurements were recorded in different environments by time resolved spectroscopy using an excitation wavelength at 640 nm and photoluminescence was detected using a Hamamatsu infrared streak camera (C11293) in the range from 1060 nm to 1400 nm. First, the PbS QDs were grafted on mesoporous alumina films according to exactly the same procedure as that used for NiO photocathodes (see the ESI†). The photoluminescence decay of PbS luminescence was monitored in the presence of the electrolyte lacking the redox couple (propylene carbonate + LiClO4) to provide the reference lifetime of PbS emission without a quencher (reaction 2 in Scheme 1) and then in the presence of the oxidized species of the redox shuttle (Co(III) and Co(II) complexes) to determine the rate constant of the photoinduced electron transfer to Co(III) (reaction 4 in Scheme 1), that is the oxidative quenching of the QDs. Alumina exhibits a VB and a CB located far apart from those of PbS, which guarantees the absence of any charge transfer reaction between all the QDs and this oxide. The lifetime measurements were also performed on the NiO films coated with PbS QDs. First, measurements were conducted in the absence of the cobalt complex in the electrolyte solution to determine the hole injection rate constant (reaction 3 in Scheme 1) and then in the presence of the Co(III) and Co(II) complexes to meet the exact conditions of the solar cells. The normalized photoluminescence decays (integated over whole emission spectrum (from 1060 nm–1200 nm)) of the PbS QDs with diameter = 3.0 nm are shown in Fig. 3 (left panel) and those of larger sizes are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.†

(Right panel) Ratio of photoluminescence kinetics of the 3.0 nm PbS QDs with quencher (electron/hole acceptor) to photoluminescence kinetics without quencher (i.e. on alumina). The solid black lines are fits to PL decays. 
On alumina films without a quencher, the emission decays are relatively long for smaller size PbS QDs and shorter for the larger size PbS (the emission decays of different sizes of PbS QDs on alumina are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI†). Clearly, as the diameter of PbS increases the rates are faster (Table 3). This can be interpreted as the consequences of the energy gap law and the enhancement of the number of traps as the surface of the nanocrystal increases. Moreover, for all sizes of QDs the emission decay is much longer on alumina films with a neutral electrolyte than on films with the electron/hole quencher (Co(III) or NiO). In the presence of a quencher (Co(III) or NiO), the PbS emission lifetimes are greatly shortened relative to that of the reference and the decays are multiexponentials as has always been observed on mesoporous semiconductor surfaces with NiO and TiO2 films (Fig. 3).32 The faster emission decay both in the presence of Co(III) and on NiO confirm that the exciton in PbS can be quenched both reductively (by hole injection into NiO) and oxidatively (by photoinduced electron transfer to Co(III)) with high quantum yields. This result is particularly new as oxidative quenching by the electrolyte was never reported before in p-QDSSCs. This is also unusual with molecular sensitizers, where hole injection into NiO is the major deactivation process from the dye excited state.20 Interestingly, the rates of both processes decrease as the diameter of PbS increases. The slower hole injection rate constant with bigger QDs can be understood as a consequence of the lower injection driving force (Table 2), while the decrease of the electrolyte reduction may originate from the fact that PbS is a p-type rather than an n-type semiconductor. Consequently in PbS, the electron extraction is less efficient than the hole, because the electron is trapped.

The rate of quenching of the PbS QDs by the quencher (cobalt, NiO or combination of both) is given by the additional rate of PL decay. We determine this by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of the photoluminescence (PL) decay of QDs with a quencher to the PL decay of QDs without a quencher (i.e. on the alumina substrate). This would give a horizontal line for no quenching (no electron or hole transfer) and line of a constant slope for a constant rate of electron or hole transfer. However, in Fig. 3 we have a range of slopes indicating a strongly time dependent process. We determined these time dependent rates by differentiating the natural logarithm of the ratio according to eqn (6): (6)
This quenching rate was determined by fitting the experimental data in Fig. 3 (right panel) with three exponentials before differentiation. The resulting values of the quenching rates are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 4 and clearly show that the quenching rate is strongly time dependent as already observed before on NiO for other types of QDs,32 but here we observe this behavior in different nanocrystals of high importance for p-QDSSCs. In order to compare our results with previous studies, an average charge transfer rate was determined using eqn (7): (7)where τ1 is the time for the fluorescence decay to fall to 1/e of its initial value. The obtained values of average charge transfer rates are given in Table 3. Caution should be taken when using this number as it is a gross simplification of the time dependent behaviour seen in Fig. 4. The charge transfer efficiency (quantum yield) for each reaction was determined using the approach we reported previously (eqn (8)).21 (8)where PL of QDs with an acceptor and PL of QDs on alumina are intensity decays of PbS QDs with a quencher and without a quencher i.e. on an alumina substrate. The obtained values are given in Table 3.
 Fig. 4  Charge transfer rate constants determined by differentiating the logarithm of PL ratios (black lines in right panel of Fig. 3); blue line – on Al2O3 with solvent and with CoII + CoIII complexes; red line – on NiO with solvent but without CoII + CoIII complexes, orange line – on NiO with solvent and with CoII + CoIII complexes. 
The average rate constants for the hole injection reaction for the PbS QDs with diameters of 3.0, 3.4 and 4.0 nm are respectively 1.7 × 108 s−1, 1.2 × 108 s−1 and 4.7 × 107 s−1 giving an injection quantum yield of 65%, 53% and 33% respectively. Here, the injection rate constants measured with these PbS QDs are 10–50 times slower than those reported by Pullerits6e or Yeow6d with CdSe QDs on NiO and 1000 times slower than from most molecular sensitizers.1c,19b,20b–d,22 This difference is most likely due to the lower driving force with PbS (−0.3 eV vs. −1 eV) and weaker electronic coupling than with molecular dyes, that are, usually, attached with a conjugated spacer to NiO. On the other hand, the average rate constant for photoinduced electron transfer to Co(III) from the photoexcited PbS with diameters of 3.0, 3.4 and 4.0 nm are respectively 1.3 × 108 s−1, 5.5 × 107 s−1 and 1.4 × 107 s−1 accounting for a (PbS)* + Co(III) → PbS(+) + Co(II) charge transfer quantum yield of 49%, 19% and 14% respectively. The ratios of hole injection relative to photoinduced electron transfer to Co(III) for PbS QDs with diameters of 3.0, 3.4 and 4.0 nm are 1.3, 2.2 and 3.4 respectively. These results indicate, firstly, that both reductive quenching (reaction 3 in Scheme 1) and oxidative quenching processes (reaction 4 in Scheme 1) occur in parallel during the cell operation and, secondly, that the rate of reduction of the Co(III) complex decreases more rapidly than the hole injection when the diameter of PbS increases. This is clearly reflected by the decrease by a factor of 3.6 of the hole injection rate constant while the reductive quenching is slowed down by almost a factor of 10 when the PbS diameter increases from 3.0 nm to 4.0 nm (Table 3). Interestingly, the quenching of PbS exciton by NiO or Co(III) is never quantitative even with the PbS with a diameter of 3.0 nm (Table 3). This result means that there is scope for greater progress if the traps in PbS are better passivated (enhancement of the intrinsic lifetime) or if the injection rate constant is increased (by using a more suitable linker). It is important to note that all the processes, such as ligand exchange of OA on PbS with TBAI and all the fabrication steps of solar cells, were accomplished under an ambient atmosphere, since a glove box was never used. As a consequence, the concentration of trap states on these quantum dots PbS is certainly larger than the concentration that can be achieved under an inert atmosphere with optimized procedures.23 Optimization can also be envisioned with the use of another redox mediator with a faster regeneration rate constant than cobalt polypyridine complexes, because they are known to be slow acceptors owing to spin change and non-adiabatic electron transfer.20a,24
Photovoltaic performances in p-DSSCs
The PbS quantum dots were immobilized on mesoporous NiO with the traditional linker assisted methodology, which was previously developed as it proved to be particularly suited for this purpose in p-QDSSCs.10 It is important to mention that NiO nanoparticles were deposited by screen printing on a thin dense layer of NiO and not directly on the FTO surface. Indeed, we observed that the direct contact of PbS on FTO glass leads to the appearance of an anodic photocurrent (probably due to electron injection in the FTO substrate from PbS exciton), which counterbalances the cathodic photocurrent (hole injection into NiO). This result is in agreement with previous reports.25 Moreover, it is known that the presence of a NiO dense layer improves the adhesion of NiO nanoparticles to the transparent electrode and reduces the interfacial charge recombination with the electrolyte.1g,26 Finally, the sintered NiO films were soaked into an ethanolic solution of nickel acetate to diminish the surface nickel oxide recombination sites and to improve the NiO nanoparticle necking.27 The redox couple used in this study was the cobalt complex: tris(4,4′-ditert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(III/II) (structure shown in Fig. S5†), because it is fully compatible and not corrosive with the PbS quantum dots that are reputed to be corroded with iodine and polysulfide based electrolytes.28 The solar cells were all fabricated with the PbS quantum dots treated with TBAI, since the initial oleic acid capped nanocrystals give much lower photovoltaic performances as we have already reported before.10 This is most certainly due to the shorter lifetime of the exciton, which decreases the injection quantum yield. The metrics of the solar cells are collected in Table 4, the photoaction spectra (incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength) are shown in Fig. 5 and the current/voltage characteristics are shown in Fig. S6.† The values given in Table 4 correspond to the average of the results recorded in six independent solar cells.

Inspection of the IPCE spectra shows that as the bandgap of the QDs decreases, the IPCE values, particularly on the exciton band, increase and shift to the lower energy part of the solar spectrum, but when the size goes above 3 nm, the maximum IPCE values decrease, reflecting a diminution of the injection efficiency. In the IPCE spectra, we can also notice that the high energy maximum absorption peak of the large quantum dots (3.4 and 4.0 nm) is not any more discernible. This is certainly due to a combination of factors, including the lower injection quantum yield of the large size QDs (owing to low injection driving force), the significant absorbance of the NiO film and possibly light scattering. Moreover, the absorption of the redox mediator is too weak to cause the observed change (see Fig. S7†).
Clearly, the photovoltaic performance is dependent on the size of the nanocrystal with the maximum performance measured for PbS quantum dots of 3.0 nm diameter. First, the Voc steadily decreases as a function of the PbS size. This is a quite general behavior already observed in TiO2 based DSSCs since low bandgap QDs usually display lower Voc than larger ones.29 On the other hand, the Jsc increases for sizes from 2.8 to 3.0 nm and then decreases for larger sizes (Table 4). The photocurrent density is proportional to the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), the injection quantum yield (ϕinj) and the charge collection efficiency (ηcharge): Jscα LHE × ϕinj × ηcharge(9)
The absorption spectra in Fig. 2 indicate that the LHE increases with the size of the PbS nanocrystal because the band is extended towards the low energy region with an increase in extinction coefficient (Table 1); therefore the growth of Jsc from 2.8 nm to 3.0 nm is certainly the consequence of higher LHE. This is corroborated by the IPCE spectra, which span to longer wavelengths and reach higher values as the diameter of PbS increases from 2.8 to 3.0 nm (Fig. 5). The decrease of Jsc for larger diameter than 3.0 nm indicates that lower charge regeneration and hole injection efficiencies counterbalance the higher LHE (see below). Therefore, there is a trade-off effects between the light-harvesting and the hole injection efficiency that lead to the highest Jsc for the PbS nanocrystal of 3.0 nm. The charge collection efficiency is controlled by the regeneration reaction of the reduced PbS by the redox couple. The rate constant of the reduction of Co(III) from the exciton is more size dependent than the hole injection reaction (Table 3), we can therefore conclude that this will be most probably the case for the electron shift from the reduced PbS to the Co(III) complex in the electrolyte. As a result, the efficiency of the electron shift from reduced PbS to Co(III) (reaction 4 in Scheme 1) may control the Jsc, since this process slows down as the diameter of PbS increases. Moreover, this process is in competition with the charge recombination (CR) from the injected hole in NiO and the electron residing in the conduction band of PbS (reaction 5 in Scheme 1). The slower rate of PbS regeneration as the size of PbS increases will naturally decrease the charge collection efficiency, because the CR pathway is very acute in p-DSSCs owing to the presence of intragap states and the location of recombination centers at the surface of NiO.30 In addition, the oxidative quenching of PbS by Co(III) diminishes more steeply than hole injection on NiO, therefore we can assume that the regeneration of the oxidized PbS controls the photocurrent density. In other words, improving electron transfer from PbS to the redox mediator could be a favorable strategy to enhance the photovoltaic performance of these p-QDSSCs. Finally, the efficiency of the hole injection quantum yield also decreases with the size of PbS, because of the reduced injection driving force (Table 2); therefore the slower rate of this reaction in combination with the shorter intrinsic lifetime of large PbS both lead to a diminution of the injection quantum yield and necessarily to the Jsc (Table 4). Overall, the decrease of the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells when the size of the PbS nanocrystal is raised above 3 nm can be understood as a decrease of both of the regeneration and the hole injection efficiencies. Oxidative quenching (reaction 4) cannot account on its own for the total photocurrent production, because the reductive quenching quantum yield is lower than the maximum value of IPCE with PbS of diameters 3.4 and 4 nm (IPCE at 400 nm reaches 22% and 20% for PbS diameters of 3.4 and 4 nm respectively, while ϕred is only 19 and 14%). As a consequence, reductive quenching of PbS* by NiO (reaction 3), that is the decay of PbS exciton first by hole injection into NiO, is necessarily an operative pathway to produce electricity. On the other hand, the direct reduction of the electrolyte from the photoexcited PbS is certainly also an effective process during the cell operation because CR between the reduced redox mediator (Co(II) species) and hole in PbS is most certainly slower than hole injection from PbS+ (bimolecular process with two positively charged species), since hole injection from PbS* occurs in a few nanoseconds. These results have important implications for the future design of QD sensitized cathodes, because firstly it indicates that direct reductive quenching of the photoexcited QDs (by a redox mediator for p-DSSCs or by a reduction catalyst for solar fuel production in DSPECs) can be a favorable pathway to attain large photocurrent densities. Additionally, this work demonstrates that efficient hole injection into NiO with low bandgap QDs can occur even with a low driving force. This result is in sharp contrast with what is usually accepted with molecular sensitizers in p-DSSCs, for which a minimum of 0.6 eV driving force is necessary to ensure efficient hole injection into NiO.31
Conclusion
In this work, we optimized the energy band alignment, rates of charge transfer at the interface and resulting photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs by controlling the size of the PbS nanocrystal. For this we have synthesized a series of PbS QDs with different diameters and investigated their ability to act as sensitizers in NiO based solar cells. Towards this goal, the quantum dots were fully characterized by absorption and emission spectra and by electrochemistry. Additionally, time-resolved emission spectroscopy of the PbS luminescence measured on different surfaces (Al2O3 and NiO) and in different environments (presence or absence of the redox shuttle) enabled the determination of the rate constants for the hole injection and for the oxidative quenching by the electrolyte from the photoexcited PbS. The photovoltaic performance of the nanocrystals was also determined in NiO based p-QDSSCs with a cobalt complex as the redox mediator. A highly performing stand-alone NiO based photocathode for solar cells (power conversion efficiency above 10%) may be limited by the shallow valence band potential of NiO, that will make it difficult to reach high open circuit potential (Voc) unless very negative redox potential is used.32 This study demonstrates that the optimal size of PbS to sensitize mesoporous NiO films is 3.0 nm. The photophysical study rationalizes the influence of the size of PbS quantum dots on the photovoltaic performances of PbS nanocrystals in p-QDSSCs. It first demonstrates that hole injection into NiO from the photoexcited QDs is an efficient process even with low injection driving force. Second, the direct electrolyte reduction by the QDs is a competing process of the hole injection, that occurs in parallel with a significant quantum yield. However, the reductive quenching of PbS by the reduced form of the redox mediator (here Co(II)) can be favorable to produce electricity, because the charge recombination from the reduced QDs with the redox mediator is most probably slower than the charge recombination with the hole in NiO. These results suggest that efficient photocathodes can be prepared with low bandgap nanocrystals and that initial hole injection from the photoexcited QDs is not necessarily the only process to generate electricity in the QD sensitized photocathode. Another direct consequence of this finding is the probable important impact of the linker used to connect the QDs to NiO, because depending on its length and its electronic properties it will most certainly impact the ratio of the hole injection and electron transfer processes (kinj/kred) and consequently the photocurrent density produced by the system. In addition, better passivation of traps in PbS QDs with improved strategies (new procedures, core/shell structure and preparation of the samples under an inert atmosphere) should lead to even higher photovoltaic performance of PbS QDs. Finally, new redox mediators with lower reorganization energy than polypyridine cobalt complexes might be better suited to maximize the electron transfer reaction from PbS to the electrolyte. These results represent new and critical information to consider for the future design of QD sensitized photocathodes for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.
