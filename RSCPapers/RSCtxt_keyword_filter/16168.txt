    , Accepted 5th September 2022First published on 6th September 2022AbstractSide chain modification on small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) is an effective method to realize high device efficiencies for organic solar cells (OSCs), among which the asymmetric side-chain strategy is a promising one. However, the underlying mechanism of this tactic has not been clearly understood from the aspect of material's eigen-properties, especially the single crystal structure. In this work, for the first time this gap is filled by focusing on parent molecules Y6 and BTP-PhC6, together with the corresponding asymmetric molecule BTP-PhC6-C11 (originally synthesized here). These three acceptors present similar optical and electrochemical properties. The crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that asymmetric BTP-PhC6-C11 shows stronger π⋯π interactions between two terminal accepting units, larger electronic couplings in 3D charge transport networks due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonding interactions and small steric hindrance, and comparable internal reorganization energies as compared with symmetric Y6 and BTP-PhC6. Upon pairing these SMAs with polymer donor PM1, the BTP-PhC6-C11-based device realizes a highest PCE of 18.33% as compared with the devices based on Y6 (17.06%) and BTP-PhC6 (17.43%). The best PCE achieved for the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 device is mainly attributed to the larger and more symmetric charge mobility, longer carrier lifetime, enhanced molecular packing along the conjugated backbones of BTP-PhC6-C11, and more suitable phase separation. Overall, our systematic study reveals that asymmetric side-chain substitution is a simple and feasible method to enhance π–π stacking, increase electronic couplings, and thereby promote photovoltaic efficiency.

Broader context
Thanks to solution-processability, flexibility, low cost, light weight and large area fabrication properties, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention. It is well-known that the photoactive layer containing donor polymers and organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors becomes a key factor determining the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the OSCs. The emergence of A–DA1D–A type small molecule acceptor (SMA) materials like Y6 has driven the surge in the device performance of OSCs. Side chain modification on SMAs is an effective method to realize high device efficiencies for OSCs, among which the asymmetric side-chain strategy is a promising one. However, the underlying mechanism of this tactic has not been clearly understood from the aspect of material's eigen-properties, especially the single crystal structure. In this work, for the first time this gap is filled by focusing on parent molecules Y6 and BTP-PhC6, together with the corresponding asymmetric molecule BTP-PhC6-C11. These SMAs with different side chains show similar optical and electrochemical properties, but different crystal packing mode, electronic couplings and molecular stacking. As a result, the asymmetric BTP-PhC6-C11-based device yields a highest PCE of 18.33%, owing to the larger and more symmetric charge mobility, longer carrier lifetime, enhanced molecular packing along the conjugated backbones of BTP-PhC6-C11 and more suitable phase separation, which is among the highest values reported for asymmetric SMAs in binary OSCs. This study suggests that asymmetric side-chain substitution is a simple and effective way to optimize the molecular structure of SMAs, leading to improved π–π stacking and crystallinity and increased electronic couplings, thereby promoting device performance.

1. Introduction
π-Conjugated organic semiconductor materials have been adopted in a growing number of optoelectronic products due to the rapid development of semiconductor technology.1–5 In addition to being comparable to inorganic materials in terms of performance, organic materials demonstrate some unique advantages, including solution-processability, flexibility, low cost and light weight. When it comes to organic solar cells (OSCs), it is well-known that a photoactive layer containing donor polymers and organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors becomes a key factor affecting the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the OSCs.6–16 Great breakthroughs have been made in device performance of OSCs,17–22 with PCEs exceeding 19% to date,23–27 which mainly results from the advent of small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure.28–42
A–D–A-type acceptors, like ITIC38 and Y6,39 usually consists of three elements: an aromatic electron-donating central core (D unit), an electron-withdrawing terminal group (A unit), and side chains. Among the three elements, the modification of side chains on SMAs is an intuitive and simple approach to optimize molecular structures and thereby improve the cell efficiency of the resulting OSCs.43–50 Many studies were devoted to optimizing the alkyl-chain branching points, dimensions, length and shape of the SMAs. For example, Sun and coworkers developed a series of SMAs by employing branched alkyl chains to replace the straight n-undecyl on Y6, and achieved a high PCE of 18.32% as well as an impressive fill factor (FF) of 0.815.46 Hou and co-workers examined the impact of the alkyl-chain length in BTP-4Cl-BO (a Y6 analogue) on the solubility, electron transport properties, and device performance. As a result, PM6:BTP-eC9 cells recorded a high PCE of 17.8%.47 Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated that breaking the symmetry of the alkyl chains is also an effective way to boost photovoltaic performance.48,49 For instance, Huang and coworkers introduced two different side chains into the pyrrole motif of Y6 to develop two SMAs (EH-HD-4F and Bu-OD-4F) with asymmetric chains, and the EH-HD-4F-based device yielded a remarkable PCE of 18.38%.48
It has been proposed that the single crystal structures of SMAs with symmetrical alkyl chains could be powerful for gaining insight into the intrinsic properties of the corresponding molecules, such as molecular packing, electronic coupling and charge transport properties, which in turn contribute to the future development of high-performance SMAs.46,51–58 However, to date, there have been no research efforts that focused on a systematic study incorporating detailed single crystal and density functional theory (DFT) level computation to probe the effect of SMAs containing asymmetric side chains on the molecular stacking, electronic coupling, crystal packing motifs, and cell efficiency, which may be due to the strong disorder asymmetric side chains making it difficult to obtain single crystals that can be resolved. Thus, it is interesting to investigate the intramolecular and intermolecular forces of SMAs with asymmetric side chains by utilizing the single crystal structures at the atomic level, and correlating the basic information of single crystals with the morphology of neat acceptor films and blend films and device performance.
In this contribution, we systematically survey the impact of asymmetric/symmetric side chains on the single crystal packing, physicochemical properties, internal reorganization energies, electronic couplings and OSC responses of SMAs. Herein, we employed a reported high-efficiency SMA (named BTP-PhC6)43 and Y6 as parent acceptors to develop a new asymmetric SMA of BTP-PhC6-C11 (Fig. 1(a)) by swapping an alkyl chain at the β position of thiophene on Y6 with BTP-PhC6. The three acceptors present similar optical properties in both solution and film states, but gradually and slightly upshifted molecular energy levels in the order of Y6, BTP-PhC6-C11, and BTP-PhC6. Crystallographic analysis and DFT data indicate that asymmetric BTP-PhC6-C11 shows stronger π⋯π interactions between two terminal accepting units, larger electronic couplings in 3D charge transport networks, and comparable internal reorganization energies as compared with symmetric Y6 and BTP-PhC6. In addition, BTP-PhC6-C11 shows enhanced molecular stacking along the conjugated backbones confirmed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, resulting in enhanced electron mobility in the pure acceptor film and D–A blend film. Together with PM1, the BTP-PhC6-C11-based device affords an outstanding PCE of 18.33% as well as a high FF of 0.7905, higher than Y6- (PCE = 17.06% and FF = 0.7577) and BTP-PhC6-based devices (PCE = 17.43% and FF = 0.7786). The higher PCE in the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 device is ascribed to the stronger and more symmetric charge transport ability, longer carrier lifetime, enhanced molecular interaction and clearer phase separation. To our knowledge, a FF of 0.7905 and a PCE of 18.33% are the best photovoltaic values for binary OSCs based on asymmetric SMAs. Overall, our work indicates that asymmetric side-chain substitution is a simple but feasible approach for tuning the photoelectric properties, thereby promoting the photovoltaic performance.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Chemical synthesis
The synthetic details of BTP-PhC6-C11 are displayed in Scheme S1, ESI.† The key compound 4 was obtained via a Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed Stille-coupling reaction by using two different organotin compounds (compound 1 and 2) and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dinitro-[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (compound 3) in 40% yield. Then, intramolecular Cadogan reductive cyclization with PPh3 and N-alkylation with 2-ethylhexyl were conducted to yield a central core with asymmetric alkyl sides (compound 5). Subsequently, compound 5 was subjected to a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction, followed by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction to produce the target molecule BTP-PhC6-C11. It should be mentioned that BTP-PhC6-C11 shows the same number of synthetic steps as symmetric Y6 and BTP-PhC6, and the only difference is the coupling reaction between the organotin reagent and compound 3. For BTP-PhC6-C11, we employed two different organotin reagents to yield an asymmetric coupling product (compound 4) via the one-pot method, while for Y6 and BTP-PhC6, both are a single organotin reagent. Although the final yield of BTP-PhC6-C11 is lower than those of Y6 and BTP-PhC6, the same synthetic steps and one-pot method show great promise in developing asymmetric SMAs. 1H and 13C NMR spectra and mass spectra of all intermediates and BTP-PhC6-C11 are outlined in the ESI.†
2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of Y6, BTP-PhC6 and BTP-PhC6-C11 in chloroform (CF) solution as well as in the solid state are displayed in Fig. 1(b), and the related optical parameters are outlined in Table 1. In solution, these three SMAs show almost the same spectra with the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmaxs) located at 732 nm for Y6, 731 nm for BTP-PhC6-C11, and 728 nm for BTP-PhC6, respectively, suggesting that modifying the side chains of Y6-like SMAs has little effect on the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. The maximum extinction coefficient (εmax) are recorded to be 2.52 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for Y6, 2.47 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for BTP-PhC6-C11, and 2.33 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for BTP-PhC6, respectively. From BTP-PhC6 to BTP-PhC6-C11 to Y6, the absorption strength gradually increases, which may be related to the gradual improvement of the molecular planarity.59 From solutions to films, Y6 and BTP-PhC6-C11 exhibit similar and more remarkable redshifts (85 nm for Y6 and 84 nm for BTP-PhC6-C11) relative to that of BTP-PhC6 (77 nm), which are ascribed to the distinct aggregation behavior of these three SMAs in the solid state. The extinction coefficients of Y6, BTP-PhC6-C11, and BTP-PhC6 in the solid state were about 1.07 × 105, 1.05 × 105 and 0.98 × 105 cm−1, respectively, which exhibits the same trend as that in CF solution. In addition, the optical bandgaps of Y6, BTP-PhC6-C11 and BTP-PhC6 were estimated to be 1.33, 1.33, and 1.34 eV, respectively, from their absorption edge onset (the intersection of the tangent to the peak absorption edge and the vertical axis Y = 0).

The molecular energy levels of these three acceptors were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods (Fig. 1(d)). The LUMO and HOMO values of Y6, BTP-PhC6-C11 and BTP-PhC6 are −4.04/−5.77 eV, −4.01/−5.74 eV, and −4.00/−5.74 eV, respectively. From Y6 to BTP-PhC6-C11 and BTP-PhC6, the slightly upshifted LUMO values could be related to the weak electron-donating properties of benzene, which contributes to gaining a larger open circuit voltage (VOC) in the resulting devices.
2.3 Molecular packing in crystals and thin films
To learn the effect of side-chain engineering on intermolecular packing and aggregation behaviors, single-crystal diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the packing modes of BTP-PhC6-C11 and BTP-PhC6, and the single-crystal information of Y6 was extracted from the reported work.60 As illustrated in Fig. 1, the single crystals of the three SMAs demonstrate a similar Y-shaped molecular geometry due to the S⋯OC intramolecular interactions. The S⋯O distances in single crystals are 2.66 Å for Y6, 2.63 Å for BTP-PhC6-C11, and 2.72 Å for BTP-PhC6, respectively. The smallest S⋯O distances in BTP-PhC6-C11 are helpful for molecular packing. Besides, we find that replacing n-undecyl with 3-hexylphenyl increases the dihedral angle between the end-capping unit and the central core, which arises from the steric hindrance effect of the benzene.
Furthermore, the single crystals of Y6, BTP-PhC6-C11 and BTP-PhC6 exhibit four packing motifs with four pairs of dimers (Fig. 2): dimer I (π⋯π stacking between two central cores), dimer II (π⋯π stacking between two end-capping units in the head-to-foot mode), dimer III (π⋯π stacking between the central core and the end-capping unit), dimer IV (π⋯π stacking between two end-capping units in the head-to-head mode). Regarding dimer I, all three molecules have the same π⋯π stacking distance of 3.36 Å, suggesting that the stacking between the central cores is determined by the 2-ethylhexyl side chains on the nitrogen. Focusing on the other packing motifs, BTP-PhC6-C11 shows smaller π⋯π distances (dimer II: 3.33 Å, dimer III: 3.31, dimer IV: 3.32 Å) than those of Y6 (dimer II: 3.46 Å, dimer III: 3.40, dimer IV: 3.35 Å) and BTP-PhC6 (dimer II: 3.38 Å, dimer III: 3.47, dimer IV: 3.36 Å), implying the stronger intermolecular interactions, which is instrumental in improving charge transport. Interestingly, we find that hydrogen bonding interactions of C–H⋯O exist in BTP-PhC6 and BTP-PhC6-C11 provided by 3-hexylphenyl side chains (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is different from that in Y6. For BTP-PhC6, two groups of hydrogen bonding interactions of C–H⋯O are provided by two 3-hexylphenyl side chains, namely a pair of C–H⋯O with a distance of 2.47 Å in dimer I and a pair of C–H⋯O with a distance of 2.52 Å in dimer III. Although the benzene ring in side chains causes a steric hindrance effect (the increased π⋯π distance in dimer III), the additional hydrogen bonds formed in BTP-PhC6-C11 are beneficial for improving charge transport. In BTP-PhC6-C11 single crystals, due to the asymmetric substitution, the steric hindrance caused by the 3-hexylphenyl chain is reduced as compared with BTP-PhC6, and the hydrogen bonding interaction (2.53 Å and 2.47 Å) of C–H⋯O provided by the 3-hexylphenyl chain is also observed. The synergistic effect of hydrogen bonding interaction and small steric hindrance leads to the tightest molecular packing. Additionally, all three single crystals display connected frameworks with ordered 3D network transport structures due to F⋯S, F⋯N, and π⋯π interactions, contributing to carrier transport.

2D GIWAXS measurements were utilized to probe the molecular packing and crystallinity behaviors. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table S1 (ESI†), all the three neat SMA films show a remarkable (100) lamellar stacking peak and a (001) backbone ordering peak in the in-plane (IP) direction and a strong π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, suggesting the dominant face-on arrangement and 3D charge transport features of the three SMAs, which coincides with the results from single crystal experiments. In comparison with BTP-PhC6, BTP-PhC6-C11 shows a similar d-spacing but a larger coherence length (CL) for both (100) and (001) peaks in the IP direction (BTP-PhC6: d-spacing100 = 21.7 Å, CCL100 = 30.4 Å, d-spacing001 = 14.8 Å, CL001 = 36.0 Å; BTP-PhC6-C11: d-spacing100 = 21.7 Å, CL100 = 46.0 Å, d-spacing001 = 14.3 Å, CL001 = 51.4 Å), indicating the more ordered molecular packing and improved crystallinity of BTP-PhC6-C11. Focusing Y6 and BTP-PhC6-C11, close CLs were observed for both the (100) peak in the IP direction and the (010) peak in the OOP direction (Y6: CL100 = 21.6 Å, CL001 = 43.5 Å), while for the (001) peak in the IP direction, BTP-PhC6-C11 exhibits an obviously smaller d-spacing and a larger CL than Y6 (Y6: d-spacing001 = 15.1 Å, CL001 = 34.1 Å), suggesting the continuous molecular stacking along the conjugated backbones of BTP-PhC6-C11, which is helpful for improving charge transport within the molecular main chain, thereby enhancing electron mobility.61 The strongest diffraction intensity of the (001) peak in the IP direction matches well with the smallest π–π stacking distance between two end-capping units in the head-to-foot mode in the BTP-PhC6-C11 single crystal.

2.4 Molecular orbitals, electronic coupling and reorganization
We next computed the frontier molecular orbitals, electronic coupling and internal reorganization energies of Y6, BTP-PhC6-C11 and BTP-PhC6 at the B3LYP/def2-SVP level. As shown in Table 1, the calculated LUMO/HOMO energies are −3.73/−5.76 eV for Y6, −3.70/−5.73 eV for BTP-PhC6-C11, and −3.65/−5.69 eV for BTP-PhC6, respectively, which coincide with the results obtained from CV curves.
The calculated electronic coupling (|J|) between a reference molecule and its nearest molecule in a single crystal structure is a commonly used approach to estimate the charge transfer among SMAs. In a single crystal structure, A, B, C, D…, etc. represent different molecules. Taking A as a reference molecule, an electronic coupling pair can be formed with its nearest molecule, which is represented by AB, AC, AD, etc. The Y6 crystal possesses 6 nearest neighbors (Fig. 4), while only four dimers have non-zero electron coupling, namely 12.54, 15.32, 32.8, and 43.31 meV, and the specific values are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). For BTP-PhC6, its crystal exhibits 8 nearest neighbors, and four dimers have decent electronic couplings (|J|AC = 37.25 meV, |J|AE = 12.9 meV, |J|AF = 58.95 meV, |J|AH = 21.65 meV). In comparison with Y6, the enhanced electronic couplings in BTP-PhC6 could be related to the πextended conjugation of benzene in side chains. Note that BTP-PhC6-C11 has the largest |J| value of 71.5 meV among the three SMAs, originating from the coplanar π–π interactions between terminal accepting units in the dimer AC, which matches well with the shorter π–π distances of dimers II and IV in the BTP-PhC6-C11 crystal than Y6 and BTP-PhC6. The largest electronic coupling in BTP-PhC6-C11 could be attributed to the molecular asymmetry,62 contributing to the charge transfer.

Fig. 4(c) displays the internal reorganization energies (λints) of the three molecules. We find that these three molecules show similar and low λints (Y6:137.6 meV, BTP-PhC6-C11: 136.7 meV, PhC6-C11: 135.6 meV), indicating that the changes in the side chains have little effect on the internal reorganization energies. It is worth mentioning that the λints in the BTP-based SMAs are lower than those of IT-4F (158 meV)52 and PC61BM (154 meV),63 making them the most popular SMAs.
2.5 Solar cell characterization
To investigate the influence of asymmetric side chains on cell efficiency, we prepared conventional binary OSCs with the architecture ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS (hole-transporting layer)/PM1:SMAs (active layer)/PFN-Br (electron-transporting layer)/Ag, where polymer PM1 (Fig. S2, ESI†) was chosen as a donor in the active layer because of its deep HOMO energy level and the complementary absorption spectra with these three acceptors.64 The device preparation details are provided in the ESI,† and the best J–V curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are presented in Fig. 5(a) and (b).

As shown in Table 2, with the increase of benzene-based side chains in SMAs, the VOCs gradually increases, namely 0.864 V for Y6 (without a benzene-based side chain), 0.871 V for BTP-PhC6-C11 (one benzene-based side chain), and 0.884 V for BTP-PhC6 (two benzene-based side chains), which coincides with the different LUMO values. Notably, the asymmetric BTP-PhC6-C11-based device realizes an impressive PCE of 18.33% with an outstanding FF of 0.7905 and a decent short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.62 mA cm−2, higher than those of symmetric acceptor-based devices (Y6: PCE = 17.06%, JSC = 26.07 mA cm−2, FF = 0.7577; BTP-PhC6: PCE = 17.43%, JSC = 25.30 mA cm−2, FF = 0.7786). The enhanced JSC and FF value in the BTP-PhC6-C11-based device might result from the enhanced molecular stacking and better charge transport ability of the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 blend. As far as we know, the impressive PCE of 18.33% and FF of 0.7905 are among the highest values for the asymmetric SMA-based binary OSCs (see Fig. 5(c) and Table S3, ESI†).48,65–68 As shown in Fig. 5(b), all three optimal cells showed strong and broad photovoltaic responses in the wavelength range from 500 to 900 nm, and the EQE peaks are located at 560 nm with maximum EQE values of 84.7% for Y6-, 87.9% for BTP-PhC6-C11-, and 84.9% for BTP-PhC6-based devices, respectively. The strongest EQE response in the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 device should result from the more favorable morphology as compared with those of the PM1:Y6 blend and PM1:BTP-PhC6 blend. The integrated JSC value of 25.5 mA cm−2 from EQE spectra in the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 device confirms the reliability of device data.

To gain insight into the properties of charge dissociation in the three groups of devices, we probed the relationship between the effective voltage (Veff) and the saturated photocurrent density (Jph) (Fig. 5(d)).69 Under the short-circuit conditions, the exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)) values are 95.1% for the PM1:Y6 device, 97.1% for the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 device, and 96.2% for the PM1:BTP-PhC6 device, respectively, indicating the better exciton dissociation ability of the BTP-PhC6-C11-based device, which is responsible for the higher FF.70
We next draw the curves of JSC/VOCversus different light intensities (Plight) to access the behaviors of charge recombination. As displayed in Fig. S3a (ESI†), all the devices yield the same slope (A) of ∼1 in the equation of JSC ∝ PA, implying that bimolecular recombination loss is negligible for these three cells. Focusing on the relationship of VOCversus Plight (Fig. S3b, ESI†), the slopes of the Y6-, BTP-PhC6-C11-, and BTP-PhC6-based cells are 1.58, 1.41, and 1.47 kT/q, respectively, demonstrating that the PM1:Y6 system yielded more serious trap-assisted recombination.
Furthermore, experiments of transient photocurrent (TPC) under short-circuit conditions and transient photovoltage (TPV) under open-circuit conditions were conducted to survey the charge extraction and recombination behaviors. As illustrated in Fig. 5(e), the decay times (τCCs) are recorded as 0.45, 0.40, and 0.41 μs for PM1:Y6, PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11, and PM1:BTP-PhC6 devices, respectively. The close and small τCCs of the three cells mean similar and strong charge extraction ability, consistent with similar bimolecular recombination from the curves of JSCversus Plight. Under the open-circuit conditions, the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 based device realizes a longer carrier lifetime value of 8.20 μs relative to those of Y6- (3.69 μs) and BTP-PhC6-based devices (4.77 μs) (Fig. 5(f)), implying less charge recombination, which may be a reason for a better FF in the BTP-PhC6-C11-based device.
2.6 Film morphology and charge transport
In order to understand how different side chains affect the morphology of the active layer, PM1:acceptor blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 6(a), the AFM height images of the three blend films show relatively smooth and uniform surface features, and similar root mean-square roughness (RMS) values were recorded for the three blends (Y6: 0.41 nm; BTP-PhC6-C11: 0.70 nm; BTP-PhC6: 0.74 nm), revealing that SMAs with different side chains do not have an obvious impact on the surface morphology of the active layer. In the TEM images (Fig. 6(b)), all the blends demonstrate fiber-like network structures with phase-separated characteristics, and a clearer and more apparent phase separation was observed in the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 blend, which might be attributed to the strong crystallization characteristics and tight molecular stacking of BTP-PhC6-C11. The results indicate that modifying the side chains of SMA is helpful for achieving the optimal phase separation structure of blend films, leading to the promotion of charge transport and the FF, and thereby cell efficiency.

Furthermore, the 2D-GIWAXS technique was employed to study the molecular packing and crystallinity of blend films. For a neat PM1 film (Fig. S4, ESI†), a low (010) peak with a qxy value of 0.298 Å−1 in the IP direction and a strong (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak with a qz value of 1.646 Å−1 were observed. Upon blending PM1 with these three SMAs, all the blends demonstrate a face-on molecular orientation with the (100) peak with a qxy value of ca. 0.29 Å−1 and the (010) peak with a qz value of ca. 1.70 Å−1. The PM1 diffraction peak values are similar to the three SMAs in both (010) π–π stacking and (100) lamellar stacking regions, and therefore it is difficult to clearly distinguish PM1 and SMAs in the two regions for the three blends. In addition, in both (010) π–π stacking and (100) lamellar stacking regions, close d-spacing and CL values are presented, as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Importantly, the PM1:Y6 blend presents almost no (001) diffraction signal, which is different from the other two blends. Compared with PM1:BTP-PhC6, the BTP-PhC6-C11-based blend displays a reduced d-spacing and an enhanced CL in the (001) region (BTP-PhC6: d-spacing = 16.7 Å, CL = 16.3 Å; BTP-PhC6-C11: d-spacing = 16.1 Å, CL = 16.8 Å), implying the maintainable chain-extended feature and larger crystalline domain of BTP-PhC6-C11, which are consistent with the TEM images.
To more clearly demonstrate the topographic differences in this work, the schematics of the film morphology of three active layers are presented in Fig. 7. In comparison with PM1:Y6 and PM1:BTP-PhC6 blends, PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 shows larger BTP-PhC6-C11 pure domains due to the stronger crystallization tendency of pure BTP-PhC6-C11. In addition, more pronounced stacking along the backbones of BTP-PhC6-C11 is represented by parallel staggered solid lines, and the line-to-line distances are shorter than those of Y6 and BTP-PhC6, indicating a stronger molecular packing of BTP-PhC6-C11. Focusing on PM1:Y6 and PM1:BTP-PhC6 blends, the slightly pronounced acceptor domain of BTP-PhC6 comes from the remaining (001) diffraction peak in PM1:BTP-PhC6, and neat BTP-PhC6 displays a negligible difference in crystallization characteristics as compared with Y6, which is validated by single crystal and GIWAXS measurements.

To learn the asymmetric-substitution effect on charge mobility, we performed the space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements to investigate the electron mobility (μe) of neat acceptors and the hole mobility (μh) and μe of blends. As exhibited in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the μe values are 5.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Y6, 8.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BTP-PhC6-C11, and 6.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BTP-PhC6, respectively. The largest μe value of BTP-PhC6-C11 is in accordance with its highly connected crystal structure and enhanced molecular packing from GIWAXS results. Upon blending with PM1, the trend of the mobility values in the three blend films is similar to that of the neat acceptors, and a higher μh value of 6.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1and a μe value of 6.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 are achieved based on the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 blend (Fig. S6, ESI†). In addition, the μe/μh ratios of Y6-, BTP-PhC6-C11-, and BTP-PhC6-based blends are 1.25, 1.02, and 1.17, respectively. Additionally, we further assessed the charge mobility by conducting photo-CELIV experiments (Fig. S7, ESI†).71 The measured charge mobilities are 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Y6-based device, 1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BTP-PhC6-C11-based device, and 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BTP-PhC6- based device, which match well with the data obtained by the SCLC method. The better charge mobility and more symmetric μe/μh ratio of the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 blend film are responsible for the better FF of its resulting cell.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we develop a new asymmetric SMA of BTP-PhC6-C11 based on Y6 and BTP-PhC6, and successfully obtained its single crystal despite the strong disorder asymmetric side chains in BTP-PhC6-C11. Single-crystal data and morphological analysis indicate that asymmetric BTP-PhC6-C11 shows stronger π⋯π interactions between two terminal accepting units, enhanced molecular stacking along the conjugated backbones and improved crystallinity due to the synergistic effect of hydrogen bonding interactions and small steric hindrance as compared with symmetric Y6 and BTP-PhC6. The DFT results demonstrate that BTP-PhC6-C11 has larger electronic couplings than and comparable internal reorganization energies to its two symmetrical counterparts. Among the three PM1-based D–A blends, higher and more balanced charge mobility, longer carrier lifetimes, shorter decay times, enhanced molecular packing and clearer phase separation are observed in the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 blend. Consequently, the PM1:BTP-PhC6-C11 device exhibits a PCE as high as 18.33%, along with a high FF of 0.7905, and a decent JSC of 26.62 mA cm−2. This excellent PCE of 18.33% is among the highest values reported for SMAs with asymmetric side chains in binary organic solar cells. Overall, our systematic study suggests that asymmetric side-chain substitution is a simple and effective way to optimize the molecular structure of SMAs, leading to improved π–π stacking and crystallinity, increased electronic couplings, and thereby promoting the device performance. We believe that this work not only provides a strategy to construct efficient SMAs but also systematically reveals the molecular structure-single crystal-morphology–performance relationship, shedding light on the development of the OSC community.

Broader context
Thanks to solution-processability, flexibility, low cost, light weight and large area fabrication properties, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention. It is well-known that the photoactive layer containing donor polymers and organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors becomes a key factor determining the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the OSCs. The emergence of A–DA1D–A type small molecule acceptor (SMA) materials like Y6 has driven the surge in the device performance of OSCs. Side chain modification on SMAs is an effective method to realize high device efficiencies for OSCs, among which the asymmetric side-chain strategy is a promising one. However, the underlying mechanism of this tactic has not been clearly understood from the aspect of material's eigen-properties, especially the single crystal structure. In this work, for the first time this gap is filled by focusing on parent molecules Y6 and BTP-PhC6, together with the corresponding asymmetric molecule BTP-PhC6-C11. These SMAs with different side chains show similar optical and electrochemical properties, but different crystal packing mode, electronic couplings and molecular stacking. As a result, the asymmetric BTP-PhC6-C11-based device yields a highest PCE of 18.33%, owing to the larger and more symmetric charge mobility, longer carrier lifetime, enhanced molecular packing along the conjugated backbones of BTP-PhC6-C11 and more suitable phase separation, which is among the highest values reported for asymmetric SMAs in binary OSCs. This study suggests that asymmetric side-chain substitution is a simple and effective way to optimize the molecular structure of SMAs, leading to improved π–π stacking and crystallinity and increased electronic couplings, thereby promoting device performance.
