    , Accepted 23rd August 2022First published on 23rd August 2022AbstractA high temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell is recognized as a promising technology for CO2 conversion (CO2-SOEC). The development of alternative cathode materials substituting conventional Ni/YSZ is a great challenge for SOECs, on which multi-step elementary reactions (e.g., adsorption of CO2, conversion of reaction intermediates, and desorption of CO) occur in succession. Herein, the Ce decorated La0.43Ca0.37Ti0.94Ni0.06O3−δ perovskite (denoted as LCTNi-Ce) is synthesized and applied as a potential cathode electrocatalyst for a CO2-SOEC. The in situ exsolution strategy and A-site deficiency enable the surface decoration of plenty of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) serving as efficient reactive sites. Furthermore, the Ce decoration leads to increased oxygen vacancy concentration, accelerated oxygen exchange rate and improved CO desorption capacity. The symmetrical half-cell measurement confirmed the boosted electrolysis performance in both CO2/CO and CO2/H2 atmospheres. DRT analysis further evidences the facilitated oxygen ion transportation and gas adsorption/dissociation upon Ce decoration. Compared to a LCTNi cell, the LCTNi-Ce cell exhibits a significantly promoted current density of −0.557 A cm−2 in 50% CO2/50% H2 at 800 °C and 1.3 V, and a reduced Rp value of 0.514 Ω cm−2 under OCV condition.
1 Introduction
To address the global warming caused by CO2 emission, researchers are striving to develop efficient technology to convert CO2 into CO fuel and achieve a carbon neutral cycle.1 Among various CO2 conversion strategies via thermocatalytic, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic pathways, solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) have attracted extensive interest because of the unrivaled efficiency and ease of operation.2,3 The representative high temperature CO2 electrolysis in a SOEC (denoted as CO2-SOEC) produces CO at the cathode side and pure O2 at the anode side, respectively.4 This process is environmentally friendly and economical, allowing storage of the excessive off-peak power as well as intermittent clean energy, such as solar energy and wind energy, in the form of chemical energy for downstream industrial production processes directly.
Typically, the CO2 reduction reaction occurring at the cathode side is considered to be crucial for the overall performance of a CO2-SOEC, which involves the steps of (1) adsorption/activation of reactants (CO2), (2) formation of reaction intermediates (CO32−), (3) ionic transportation (O2−), and (4) desorption of products (CO). The traditional Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) cathode is reported to be a potential cathode, in which Ni and YSZ guarantee high enough electronic and ionic conductivities, respectively. However, the Ni/YSZ cathode usually suffers from irreversible deactivation due to Ni agglomeration and carbon deposition, particularly operated under the conditions of high temperature and electrolysis current.5,6 Alternatively, perovskite oxides are widely studied and employed for CO2-SOECs owing to the mixed ionic–electronic properties and structure stability.7–9 Aliovalent cation doped perovskite oxides including (La,Sr)(Ti)O3−δ (LST) based, (La,Sr)(Fe)O3−δ (LSF) based, (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3−δ (LSCM) based and Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ (SFM) based perovskites have been explored as potential SOEC cathodes for CO2 electrolysis, mainly owing to the abundant vacant oxygen sites for CO2 adsorption (Step 1).4,10–15 Nevertheless, according to Goldschmidt's rule, the excessive incorporation of heteroatoms and structural defects will deteriorate the integrity of the perovskite framework16 and restrict the tunability of structural defect engineering. On the other hand, the pristine perovskite parent favors the structural termination of catalytically inert “A–O–A”,9,17,18 which results in insufficient contact between adsorbed reactants and catalytically active B-site species, as well as an unsatisfactory conversion efficiency (Steps 2 and 3). Moreover, the ready desorption of the product, e.g., CO, is an equally important criterion to be met (Step 4), since the accumulation of CO will not only block the reactive sites for further adsorption of CO2, but also trigger the unfavorable Boudouard reaction.
Targeting the above-mentioned four elementary steps, in this work, we designed a Ce decorated La0.43Ca0.37Ti0.94Ni0.06O3−δ cathode (denoted as LCTNi-Ce) for efficient CO2 electrolysis with the following considerations. Based on previous studies,9,19,20 the in situ exsolution strategy and A-site deficiency principle were collectively employed to construct the metallic Ni NP socketed perovskite parent. The evenly distributed CeO2 was introduced onto such a metal/perovskite heterostructure via a simple hydrothermal process, which plays a key role in tuning the chemical/physical properties of the electrode. The CO2 adsorption ability was found to be promoted on LCTNi-Ce cathode, owing to the co-existence of a basic site of Ca and abundant surface oxygen vacancies. The decoration of CeO2 not only accelerates the oxygen exchange, but also facilitates the fast CO desorption without the trade-off of efficient conversion. The experimental results of catalytic activity show that LCTNi-Ce is a promising cathode material for CO2-SOECs with CO or H2 as the protective gas.
2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce
The La0.43Ca0.37Ti0.94Ni0.06O3−δ (LCTNi) perovskite was prepared by the modified solvothermal synthesis as reported by Lee et al.21 Polyethylene glycol (PEG-400, Aladdin, AR) was used as a solvent, and tetrabutylorthotitanate (TBOT, Aladdin, AR) instead of TiO2 was the titanium source. A mixture of La(NO3)3·6H2O (Energy Chemical, 99.99%), Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (Xilong Scientific, AR) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, AR) in desired stoichiometric amounts was dissolved in a moderate amount of PEG-400 under stirring at 60 °C. Then the desired stoichiometric amount of TBOT was added to the above solution and kept stirring at 60 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 180 °C for 10 h. The resulting solid was centrifuged, washed with alcohol three times, dried at 60 °C overnight and calcined at 800 °C for 5 h in air with a ramping rate of ∼3 °C min−1.
The Ce decorated LCTNi sample was obtained by the hydrothermal treatment process.22 Approximately 0.5 g of LCTNi powder was added into 50 mL of 0.02 M Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (3A Chemical, 99.99%) aqueous solution. The suspension was aged at 150 °C for 4 h. After centrifugation, washing with deionized water three times and drying at 60 °C overnight, the resulting solid was denoted as LCTNi-Ce.
2.2 Cell fabrication
La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3−δ (LSGM) electrolyte pellets with a thickness of ∼300 mm were prepared through tape casting, which was provided by Zhu et al.23 To prevent the potential reaction between the LSGM electrolyte and LCTNi/LCTNi-Ce fuel electrode, La0.4Ce0.6O2−δ (LDC) was screen-printed as the barrier layer. La0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (LSCF, Fuel Cell Materials) was used as air electrode, and LSCF-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC, Fuel Cell Material) with a weight ratio of 1:1 was applied to increase the three-phase boundary (TPB). All the electrode slurries were prepared as described in our previous work.24 The LSGM electrolyte supported symmetric half-cells of LCTNi‖LDC|LSGM|LDC‖LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce‖LDC|LSGM|LDC‖LCTNi-Ce, as well as the electrolysis cells of LCTNi‖LDC|LSGM‖LSCF-GDC|LSCF and LCTNi-Ce‖LDC|LSGM‖LSCF-GDC|LSCF were fabricated by the screen-printing method. Afterwards, the cell was calcined at 1100 °C for 5 h in air with a ramping rate of ∼3 °C min−1. The effective electrode area of each cell was ∼0.5 cm2. The Ag grids were screen-printed on the surface of electrode and sintered at 600 °C for 1 h as current collectors. The electrolysis cell was sealed on a home-made alumina tube by using a ceramic sealant (Aremco 552) and connected to an electrochemical workstation (Wuhan Corrtest Instruments, CS2350H) via Ag wires and a silver conducting resin (Shanghai Institute of Synthetic Resins, DAD 87).
2.3 Electrochemical test
The well fabricated electrolysis cell was heated to 800 °C with a ramping rate of ∼1 °C min−1 from room temperature to 260 °C and ∼2 °C min−1 from 260 to 800 °C. Both temperatures of 70 and 260 °C were held for 1 h. The fuel electrode was placed in N2 with a flow rate of 50 mL min−1, and the air electrode was in free air. After reaching 800 °C, the fuel electrode gas was switched to pure H2 for 3 h to reduce the LCTNi/LCTNi-Ce electrode. Then, the cathode gas was switched to CO2 with CO or H2 as the protective atmosphere, and the total flow rate was maintained at 50 mL min−1. For a symmetric half-cell, it was heated from room temperature to 800 °C with a ramping rate of ∼3 °C min−1 in N2, then reduced in pure H2 for 3 h and switched to a CO2/CO or CO2/H2 atmosphere for testing. The cell electrochemical performance was evaluated on a CS2350H electrochemical workstation. The open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the electrolysis cell in different atmospheres was monitored to check the gas leakage. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was conducted in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz with a potential amplitude of 10 mV. The DRT technique was applied to further analyse the EIS data via DRTtools, which is a MATLAB program developed by the Ciucci group.25 The current–voltage (j–V) curves were recorded with a voltage sweeping speed of 5 mV s−1.
2.4 Characterization
The bulk phases and Ni NP exsolution of synthesized LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrodes were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV) equipped with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ interval from 20° to 90° with a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The cross-sectional microstructure of the cell was observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss GeminiSEM 500). The morphology of exsolved NPs was characterized by using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai F30 TWIN). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a home-made chemisorption apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to detect H2 consumption. Approximately 0.05 g of the sample was pre-treated with 5% H2/N2 at room temperature for 1 h and then heated to 700 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Quantum 2000) was used to analyse the valence states of elements and oxygen vacancies in LCTNi, LCTNi-Ce and reduced samples. The XPS data were calibrated with the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as a reference. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies could identify the oxidation state and electronic structure information.26 The XANES and EXAFS spectra of Ni K-edge for LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce before/ after reduction were recorded at the TPS 44A beamline of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Taiwan. The Athena software of the Demeter software package was used to process the XANES/EXAFS data.27 CO temperature programmed desorption (CO-TPD) measurement was conducted on a chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, Autochem II 2920). The reduced sample was pre-treated in helium (He) at 300 °C for 1 h to remove the adsorbed species. After cooling to 50 °C in He, 10% CO/He was introduced for 0.5 h and then switched to He for 1 h to remove the weakly adsorbed CO. The desorption data were obtained on a mass spectrometer from 50 to 800 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1. The total conductivity of the reduced electrode was determined by the van der Pauw technique.28 The LCTNi/LCTNi-Ce electrode slurry was screen-printed in circle with an area of ∼0.5 cm2 on the side of LDC|LSGM electrolyte. After being calcined at 1100 °C for 5 h in air, four Ag wires were fixed on the corners of a virtual square. The conductivities of reduced electrodes were recorded from 800 to 600 °C with an interval of 50 °C in CO2/CO and CO2/H2 atmospheres. For the electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) test, the variation of conductivity with time was recorded during the atmosphere switching from 50% CO2/50% CO to 70% CO2/30% CO on the reduced electrode.
3 Results and discussions
3.1 Perovskite structures

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the XRD patterns of as-synthesized LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce, as well as the corresponding reduced samples (treated in pure H2 at 800 °C for 3 h). All the samples exhibit the typical orthorhombic perovskite structure, which is in good match with the standard structure of CaTiO3 (PDF#82-0283). Considering that the LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce powders were co-fired with the LSCF-GDC|LSCF electrode during the cell fabrication procedure, the phase structures of these samples after cell manufacture will be worthy of investigation. As shown in Fig. S1,† both LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce samples calcined at 1100 °C display the similar structure to those calcined at 800 °C. There is no impurity phase formed, indicating that the LCTNi perovskite structure and Ce decorated sample (with CeO2 formation) are relatively stable at the higher temperature. The metallic Ni phase of 2θ ∼ 44.5° (PDF#04-0850) is observed on reduced samples with the bulk perovskite phase being well maintained, preliminarily proving the successful Ni metal exsolution. Furthermore, there exists an additional CeO2 diffraction peak at 2θ = ∼28.5° (PDF #81-0792) on pristine LCTNi-Ce, which becomes weaker and broader after reduction treatment. This intensity evolution suggests that the reduction treatment triggers the decreased particle size and re-dispersion of CeO2. The H2-TPR profiles in Fig. S2† provide information on reducibility of the materials. It is suggested that a reduction temperature of 800 °C is enough for Ni exsolution. The H2 consumption peaks at 500 °C for LCTNi-Ce can be ascribed to the reduction of decorated CeO2.29

Fig. S3† shows the cross-sectional microstructure of the LCTNi-Ce‖LDC|LSGM‖ LSCF-GDC|LSCF electrolysis cell. The LSGM electrolyte seems dense, and the thicknesses of the LDC barrier layer, LCTNi-Ce cathode and LSCF-GDC|LSCF anode layers are measured to be ∼5, ∼17 and ∼19 μm, respectively. Fig. 1(c) presents a typical cross-sectional microstructure of the cathode layer before the test. It can be seen that the LDC barrier layer is attached well to the surface of LSGM electrolyte with clear interfaces. The morphology of the porous electrode is further observed in Fig. 1(d) and (e). Apparently, numerous nanoparticles with uniform distribution are exsolved from the bulk after being reduced at 800 °C for 3 h in pure H2. More than 100 NPs were counted for each sample, and the NP sizes are in the range of 20–70 nm. The average NP size of reduced LCTNi is measured to be ∼44 nm, slightly greater than that of reduced LCTNi-Ce (∼35 nm). The corresponding EDS-mapping results confirm that the in situ exsolved particles mainly consist of Ni element, as shown in Fig. S4.† The presence of Ni NPs on the surface of reduced sample agrees with the above XRD results. For the reduced LCTNi-Ce sample (see Fig. S4b†), the Ce element appears to be distributed uniformly as well, without significant aggregation. The backscattered electron (BSE) micrograph in Fig. S5(b)† also demonstrates that the decorated Ce is highly dispersed on the surface of reduced LCTNi-Ce perovskite. Therefore, it is preliminarily concluded that the hydrothermal treatment leads to the surface decoration of CeO2 nanoparticles with homogeneous distribution.
To investigate the structure of in situ exsolved Ni NPs, the HRTEM and HAADF-STEM images as well as EDS elemental mappings of reduced powders are presented in Fig. 2. As can be seen from Fig. 2(a), (b) and S6,† the La, Ca, Ti, O and Ce species are dispersed well on the bulk of reduced LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce. The nanoparticles are composed of Ni element, demonstrating that Ni NPs successfully exsolved via the reduction treatment. Fig. 2(c) shows a typical morphology of in situ exsolved Ni NPs. The measured spacing of the lattice fringe in square “1” is determined to be ∼0.203 nm, agreeing with the value of Ni(111) in PDF#04-0850. The spacing of lattice fringe in square “2” is ∼0.274 nm, which is close to the value of CaTiO3(112) in PDF#82-0231. The results of lattice spacings are consistent with the XRD patterns in Fig. 1(a) and (b). XPS analysis further confirms the presence of Ni0 species within the reduced LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce, as shown in Fig. 2(d). For reduced samples, there exists an additional peak associated with Ni0 (∼852.3 eV) as compared to the pristine samples with only one peak related to Ni2+ (∼853.3 eV). The oxidation states of the Ni cation in the samples were also analysed by Ni–K XANES, which shift to higher energy with the increase in the valence state of 3d element. As can be seen from Fig. 2(e) and (f), the absorption edges in the Ni–K XANES of reduced LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce shift clearly to lower energy relative to those of pristine samples, implying that the oxidation state of Ni species decreases after reduction treatment.30 Moreover, Fig. 2(g) shows the Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra, which are sensitive to the local structure of 3d element.31 One can see that the first peak at about 1.68 Å, related to the Ni–O bond in the pristine sample, is strongly reduced for the reduced sample, while the second peak at ∼2.4 Å corresponding to the Ni–Ni coordination in fcc Ni metal32 becomes a dominant one, indicating the reduction from Ni oxide to Ni metal.

Squares “1” and “2” are the partial magnified TEM images of selected regions. The spacing of lattice fringe is determined by FFT and IFFT analyses.

(e) XANES spectra of the Ni K-edge and (f) the first derivative absorption, and (g) the fitted Fourier transform magnitude spectra of Ni K-edge EXAFS oscillations for LCTNi, LCTNi-Ce and reduced samples. 
The combined XPS and XANES/EXAFS results support the conclusion that the Ni NPs indeed segregated from the deep lattice onto the surfaces after being reduced at 800 °C for 3 h in pure H2. Fig. S7† presents the Ce 3d XPS spectra of LCTNi-Ce before/after reduction. The Ce4+ peak at ∼880.0 eV is observed in pristine LCTNi-Ce. There is an additional Ce3+ peak at ∼882.3 eV in reduced LCTNi-Ce, indicating that Ce exists as a mixture of Ce4+ and Ce3+ after reduction treatment. This is in accordance with the H2-TPR result in Fig. S2.†
3.2 Electrochemical performance of half-cells

3.2.1 Electrochemical performance in the CO2/CO atmosphere. 
The CO2 electrolysis activities of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce were first assessed in half-cell mode. Fig. 3(a)–(c) show the electrochemical performances of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrodes in the CO2/CO atmosphere with different ratios at 800 °C. Before the EIS test, the half-cells were reduced at 800 °C for 3 h in pure H2 to trigger the formation of exsolved Ni NPs. All the EIS data were analysed by using an equivalent circuit model with three R–Q elements, as depicted in the inset of Fig. S8.† Fig. S8† presents the example fits to the EIS data of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce half-cells in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800 °C. The Nyquist and Bode plots are divided into three parts, i.e., high frequency (HF), middle frequency (MF) and low frequency (LF). Obviously, the fitting results match well with the experimental data. The sum of HF, MF and LF values is the polarization resistance (Rp), which reflects the catalytic activity of electrode material. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a)–(c), in each CO2/CO atmosphere, the Rp value of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell is smaller than that of the LCTNi half-cell. Table S1† lists the specific Rp values of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce half-cells in different CO2/CO atmospheres at 800 °C. The Rp values of the LCTNi half-cell in 90% CO2/10% CO, 70% CO2/30% CO and 50% CO2/50% CO are determined to be 4.615, 2.482 and 2.059 Ω cm−2, while those of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell decrease to 3.962, 2.149 and 1.920 Ω cm−2, respectively. The reduced Rp value of LCTNi-Ce half-cell under the same conditions indicates that the presence of decorated Ce benefits the electrochemical performance of LCTNi electrode in the CO2/CO atmosphere.
 Fig. 3  EIS results of LCTNi‖LDC|LSGM|LDC‖LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce‖LDC|LSGM|LDC‖LCTNi-Ce half-cells in 90% CO2/10% CO, 70% CO2/30% CO and 50% CO2/50% CO at 800 °C under OCV condition. (a–c) Nyquist plots, (d–f) DRT analysis and (g–i) the fitted polarization resistance values (including RHF, RMF and RLF). The solid lines in (a–c) are the fitting results via an equivalent circuit model. All the ohmic resistances are subtracted for clear comparison. 
To investigate the detailed electrochemical processes in different CO2/CO atmospheres, the EIS data of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce half-cells were further analysed by the DRT technique. Fig. 3(d)–(f) provide the corresponding DRT curves of abovementioned two half-cells at 800 °C in 90% CO2/10% CO, 70% CO2/30% CO and 50% CO2/50% CO, respectively. All the DRT curves are divided into three parts, namely, P1 at high frequency (103–104 Hz), P2 at intermediate frequency (10–100 Hz) and P3 at low frequency (1–10 Hz), corresponding to three sub-steps involved in the electrode reaction. As reported in literatures,24,33,34 the P1 peak at high frequency is associated with charge transfer process, the P2 peak at intermediate frequency is related to oxygen ion transportation as well as lattice oxygen bulk diffusion, and the P3 peak at low frequency is ascribed to the reaction at the gas/solid interface such as adsorption and dissociation. The proportions of P1, P2 and P3 peaks are calculated and presented in Fig. S9.† Apparently, the proportion of the P3 peak is much greater than those of the other two peaks, indicating that the gas adsorption/dissociation corresponding to the P3 peak is the rate-limiting step at 800 °C in the CO2/CO atmosphere. Given that the DRT peak area is proportional to the polarization resistance,34 the resistance corresponding to P3 peak of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell is smaller than that of the LCTNi half-cell in each CO2/CO atmosphere. The sum of P3, P2 and P1 peak areas of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell is also smaller than that of the LCTNi half-cell, agreeing with the reduced Rp value of the Ce decorated electrode in Fig. 3(a)–(c). The polarization resistance corresponding to each peak (RHF ∼ P1 peak, RMF ∼ P2 peak and RLF ∼ P3 peak) is presented in Fig. 3(g)–(i). Compared to the LCTNi half-cell, the LCTNi-Ce half-cell exhibits a significantly reduced polarization resistance in different CO2/CO atmospheres, indicating that the Ce decorated electrode contributes to the facilitated electrode electrochemical reaction.
Further, we systematically study the effect of operating temperature on catalytic activities of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrodes in the CO2/CO atmosphere. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the EIS results of half-cells tested in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800, 750 and 700 °C, respectively. The EIS data at 750 and 700 °C were analysed using an equivalent circuit model with four R–Q elements, and the Nyquist plots are divided into four parts, i.e., HF, MF1, MF2 and LF, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(e). Fig. 4(e) provides the resistance of each part, denoted as RHF, RMF1, RMF2 and RLF. For each half-cell, the fitted Rp value (i.e., the sum of RHF, RMF1, RMF2 and RLF) increases gradually with the decrease of operating temperature, suggesting that the higher temperature is conductive to accelerating the electrode reaction process in the CO2/CO atmosphere. At a specific temperature, the Rp value of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell is smaller than that of the LCTNi half-cell. Table S2† summarizes the Rp values of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce half-cells in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800–700 °C under OCV condition. The Rp values of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell at 800, 750 and 700 °C are determined to be 1.920, 3.383 and 9.305 Ω cm−2, respectively, slightly smaller than 2.059, 3.552 and 10.330 Ω cm−2 of the LCTNi half-cell. The reduced Rp values indicate that the Ce decorated LCTNi electrode improves its electrochemical performance in the CO2/CO atmosphere ranging from 800 to 700 °C. The corresponding DRT curves of two cells are presented in Fig. 4(c) and (d). There exist four peaks, P1 at 103–104 Hz, P′ at 102–103 Hz, P2 at 10–100 Hz and P3 at 1–10 Hz except that the P′ peak disappears at 800 °C. The P3, P2 and P′ peaks of each half-cell shift to a lower frequency as the temperature decreases, while the P1 peak shifts to a higher frequency. Again, the P3 peak is assigned to the gas adsorption and dissociation process, the P1 peak is related to the charge transfer process, and the P2 and P′ peak represent lattice oxygen bulk diffusion and oxygen ion transportation, respectively. Fig. S10† provides the calculated proportions of abovementioned four peaks. The greatest proportion of the P3 peak shows that the gas adsorption/dissociation process is the rate-limiting step at 800–700 °C in the CO2/CO atmosphere. The activation energy (Ea) of the electrode in 50% CO2/50% CO is shown in Fig. 4(f), and those in 70% CO2/30% CO and 90% CO2/10% CO are presented in Fig. S11.† The Ea value of the LCTNi-Ce electrode is slightly smaller than that of LCTNi in the same CO2/CO composition, revealing that the Ce decoration has little effect on the kinetics of the CO2 reduction reaction in the CO2/CO atmosphere.

3.2.2 Electrochemical performance in the CO2/H2 atmosphere. 
With the consideration that H2 is also employed as a protective gas for CO2-SOEC, we conducted the EIS tests of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce half-cells in the CO2/H2 atmosphere with different ratios at 800 °C. As shown in Fig. 5(a)–(c), all the Rp values of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell are slightly smaller than those of the LCTNi half-cell in the same CO2/H2 composition. Table S3† lists the Rp values of the two half-cells. DRT analysis in Fig. 5(d)–(f) shows that three peaks (i.e., P1, P2 and P3 peaks) exist for DRT curves of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce half-cells in the CO2/H2 atmosphere at 800 °C, which is similar to the result in the CO2/CO atmosphere at 800 °C, as shown in Fig. 3(d)–(f). Fig. S12† shows the calculated proportions of the three peaks based on the DRT analysis. The proportion of the P3 peak is significantly greater than those of P1 and P2 peaks, suggesting that the gas adsorption/dissociation process is also the rate-limiting step at 800 °C in the CO2/H2 atmosphere. In contrast to the half-cells in the CO2/CO atmosphere, the proportion of the P1 peak is greater than that of the P2 peak in the CO2/H2 atmosphere at 800 °C. Fig. 5(f) and (g) show the fitted resistances of the three parts in the equivalent circuit model corresponding to the fitting curves in Fig. 5(a)–(c). It can be seen that the RHF value of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell is a little greater than that of the LCTNi half-cell, indicating that the charge transfer process on the Ce decorated electrode becomes sluggish in the CO2/H2 atmosphere. This could be explained by the conductivity differences shown in Fig. S13.† The total conductivity of the LCTNi-Ce electrode is smaller than that of LCTNi at 800 °C in the same CO2/H2 composition. For example, the conductivities of LCTNi-Ce and LCTNi electrodes at 800 °C in 50% CO2/50% H2 are determined to be ∼1.49 and ∼1.54 S cm−1, respectively. This is because the ionic conductivity of reduced CeO2 is not high.35 To sum up, the total conductivity of the LCTNi-Ce electrode decreases as compared to LCTNi under the same conditions (see Fig. S14†). The reduced RMF and RLF values of LCTNi-Ce as compared to the LCTNi half-cell reveal that both oxygen ion transportation and the gas adsorption/dissociation process are improved on the Ce decorated electrode using H2 as the protective gas.

The solid lines in (a–c) are the fitting results via an equivalent circuit model. All the ohmic resistances are subtracted for clear comparison. 
The effect of operating temperature on the catalytic activities of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrodes in the CO2/H2 atmosphere was further discussed, as shown in Fig. 6. All the fitted EIS data were analysed using an equivalent circuit model with four R–Q elements, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 6(e). As can be seen from Fig. 6(a) and (b), the Rp value of each half-cell increases with the decrease of operating temperature, agreeing with the tendency in the CO2/CO atmosphere in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The Rp value of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell in 50% CO2/50% H2 at 800 °C is very close to that of the LCTNi half-cell (0.259 vs. 0.268 Ω cm−2), while Rp values of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell at 750 and 700 °C are much smaller than those of the LCTNi half-cell (0.473 vs. 0.836 Ω cm−2 at 750 °C and 1.097 vs. 1.809 Ω cm−2 at 700 °C), as listed in Table S4.† The reduced Rp values in the CO2/H2 atmosphere reveal that Ce decoration enhances the electrochemical activity of LCTNi electrode in CO2 with H2 as the protective gas. The DRT curves in Fig. 6(c) and (d) show that the P′ peak only appears at 700 °C, indicating that the oxygen ion transportation is improved at the relatively high temperature based on the abovementioned analysis. The P3 peak area is the greatest, and its proportion is significantly greater than those of the other two peaks, as shown in Fig. S15.† It is concluded that the gas adsorption/dissociation process is also the key step at 800–700 °C in the CO2/H2 atmosphere. The RLF value of the LCTNi half-cell corresponding to the gas adsorption and dissociation process is greater than that of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell at each temperature, as shown in Fig. 6(e). Therefore, the Ce decorated LCTNi electrode enhances the electrochemical reaction in the CO2/H2 atmosphere and exhibits the reduced polarization resistance. Fig. 6(f) presents the calculated Ea values of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrodes in 50% CO2/50% H2, and those values in 80% CO2/20% H2 as well as 90% CO2/10% H2 are provided in Fig. S16.† Notably, the Ea value of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell is smaller than that of the LCTNi half-cell in the same CO2/H2 composition. For example, the Ea value of the LCTNi-Ce half-cell in 50% CO2/50% H2 is calculated to be ∼1.20 eV, while that of the LCTNi half-cell is ∼1.58 eV. The decrease in the Ea value suggests that the Ce decorated electrode exhibits the accelerated kinetics of CO2 reduction reaction in the CO2/H2 atmosphere as a result of the enhanced oxygen ion transportation as well as gas adsorption/dissociation process over LCTNi-Ce, as mentioned in the previous discussion.

3.3 Electrochemical performance of the electrolysis cell

3.3.1 Electrochemical performance in 50% CO2/50% CO. 
Next, the CO2 electrolysis activities of electrolysis cells with LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce as the cathodes, LSGM as the electrolyte support and LSCF-GDC|LSCF as the anode were investigated. Fig. 7 shows the electrochemical performances of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrolysis cells in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800 °C. It can be seen from Fig. 7(a) that the LCTNi-Ce cell exhibits greater current density than the LCTNi cell under the same electrolysis voltage, indicating that the Ce decorated electrode exhibits better electrochemical performance for CO2 electrolysis with CO as the protective gas. For example, the electrolysis current densities at 1.3 V of LCTNi-Ce and LCTNi cells are determined to be −0.429 and −0.389 A cm−2, respectively. The OCV values of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce cells are approximately 0.92 V, thus the partial pressure of oxygen in the fuel electrode (i.e., cathode) is calculated to be ∼1.094 × 10−18 atm considering that the partial pressure of oxygen in the anode is ∼0.21 atm. Fig. 7(b) and (c) show the EIS results of LCTNi-Ce and LCTNi cells under OCV condition, as well as voltages of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 V. All the lines are fitted using an equivalent circuit model with four R–Q elements owing to the existence of four DRT peaks (i.e., P1, P2, P3 and P4 peak), as shown in Fig. S17(a) and (b).† Fig. S17(c) and (d)† provide the calculated proportions of P1, P2, P3 and P4 peaks for the above two cells. The P4 peak area is the greatest, and it occupies the largest proportion among the four peaks, indicating that the gas adsorption/dissociation process is the rate-limiting step at 800 °C in 50% CO2/50% CO. Fig. 7(d) presents the resistances of RHF corresponding to the P1 peak, RMF1 corresponding to the P2 peak, RMF2 corresponding to the P3 peak and RLF corresponding to the P4 peak. Obviously, RLF values of the two cells mainly contribute to their total polarization resistances and gradually decrease with the increase of applied voltage. The Rp value of the LCTNi-Ce cell in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800 °C under OCV condition is smaller than that of the LCTNi cell (1.748 vs. 2.129 Ω cm−2). The Rp values of the LCTNi-Ce cell at various voltages are also decreased as compared to those of the LCTNi cell (1.092 vs. 1.113 Ω cm−2 at 1.1 V, 0.651 vs. 0.693 Ω cm−2 at 1.2 V, and 0.505 vs. 0.537 Ω cm−2 at 1.3 V). The reduced Rp value of the LCTNi-Ce electrolysis cell under the same conditions is consistent with the better electrochemical performance in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800 °C, as shown in Fig. 7(a).

The lines in (b and c) are the fitting results via an equivalent circuit model as shown in the inset of (d). All the ohmic resistances are subtracted for clear comparison. 


3.3.2 Electrochemical performance in 50% CO2/50% H2. 

Fig. 8 shows the electrochemical performances of electrolysis cells with LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce as the cathodes in 50% CO2/50% H2 at 800 °C, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a), the OCV value of the above-mentioned two cells is approximately 1.02 V, thus the partial pressure of oxygen in the cathode is calculated to be ∼1.117 × 10−20 atm, which is far smaller than ∼1.094 × 10−18 atm in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800 °C. The lower partial pressure of oxygen in 50% CO2/50% H2 might be responsible for better electrolysis performance than the cells in 50% CO2/50% CO at 800 °C. Liang et al. also reported a similar superior CO2-SOEC performance with H2 as the protective gas as compared to that with CO.36 This was attributed to the change of CO2 reduction pathway from electrochemical reduction to thermochemical one under the existence of H2. In the CO2/H2 atmosphere, the LCTNi-Ce cell exhibits much better electrolysis performance than the LCTNi cell, especially at a greater current density. The electrolysis current densities at 1.3 V of LCTNi-Ce and LCTNi cells are determined to be −0.557 and −0.478 A cm−2, respectively. The excellent electrolysis performance of the LCTNi-Ce cell results from the synergistic effect between Ni exsolution and Ce decoration. Fig. S18† shows the CO2-SOEC performances of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrolysis cells before/after reduction in 50% CO2/50% CO and 50% CO2/50% H2 at 800 °C, respectively. Notably, the co-existence of in situ exsolved Ni NPs and decorated CeO2 leads to the best electrochemical performance in the above two atmospheres. For instance, the electrolysis current density at 1.3 V in 50% CO2/50% H2 of the LCTNi-Ce with Ni exsolution cell is −0.557 A cm−2, greater than −0.229 A cm−2 of the LCTNi-Ce without Ni exsolution cell, −0.255 A cm−2 of the LCTNi without Ni exsolution cell and −0.478 A cm−2 of the LCTNi with Ni exsolution cell.

The lines in (b and c) are the fitting results via an equivalent circuit model as shown in the inset of (d). All the ohmic resistances are subtracted for clear comparison. 
Compared to the LCTNi cell, the LCTNi-Ce cell also has a reduced Rp value in the CO2/H2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the Rp values of LCTNi-Ce and LCTNi cells in 50% CO2/50% H2 at 800 °C under OCV condition are 0.514 and 0.650 Ω cm−2, respectively. The Rp values at various electrolysis voltages (e.g., 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 V) of the LCTNi-Ce cell are also smaller than those of the LCTNi cell, as presented in Fig. 8(c). All the lines in Fig. 8(b) and (c) are fitted by using an equivalent circuit model with three R–Q elements based on the DRT analysis in Fig. S19.†Fig. 8(d) shows the corresponding resistance of each DRT peak in Fig. S19† (RHF ∼ P1 peak, RMF ∼ P2 peak and RLF ∼ P3 peak). Apparently, the RLF value of each cell decreases as the applied voltage increases, and the calculated proportion of the P3 peak area is greater than those of P1 and P2 peaks. It is concluded that the gas adsorption/dissociation process is the key step at 800 °C in 50% CO2/50% H2. In summary, the LCTNi-Ce electrolysis cell exhibits better electrochemical performance than the LCTNi cell in both CO2/CO and CO2/H2 atmospheres. Furthermore, the electrolysis performances of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce cells in pure CO2 at 800 °C were investigated, as shown in Fig. S20.† The performances of the two cells in pure CO2 are worse than those under the existence of CO or H2. The introduction of the reducing gas prevents the oxidation of in situ exsolved Ni NPs (serving as reactive sites), reduces the partial pressure of oxygen in the cathode and decreases the overpotential for CO2 electrolysis, thus enhancing the electrochemical activity significantly. The LCTNi-Ce cathode cell performance in this work is superior as compared to those of other perovskite cathodes with NP exsolution, as listed in Table 1. Therefore, the Ce decorated LCTNi perovskite with in situ exsolved Ni NPs is a promising cathode material for CO2 electrolysis using CO or H2 as the protective gas.

3.4 Further discussion
Based on four elementary steps for the CO2-SOEC reaction, the CO2 adsorption (Step 1), oxygen exchange process (Steps 2 and 3) and CO desorption (Step 4) are further discussed to elucidate the enhanced CO2-SOEC performance over the Ce decorated cathode. Given that the CO2 adsorption capacity is related to the oxygen vacancy concentration in the cathode, the O 1s XPS spectra were measured for LCTNi, LCTNi-Ce and the reduced powders. As shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b), there exist three peaks, corresponding to three kinds of oxygen species, i.e., lattice oxygen (OL at ∼529.1 eV), surface adsorption oxygen (OA at ∼531.4 eV) and hydroxyl oxygen (OH at ∼533.0 eV).52,53 The calculated relative proportions of different oxygen species are presented in the inset of Fig. 9(a) and (b). Generally, the surface adsorption oxygen (OA) is recognized to be associated with the oxygen vacancy. The greater OA proportion suggests more surface vacancy sites for oxygen absorption and activation. Fig. 9(c) summarizes the calculated OA proportions of LCTNi, LCTNi-Ce and the reduced powders. For LCTNi-Ce, the reduction process increases the OA proportion from ∼41.4% to ∼46.1%. The OA proportion of reduced LCTNi also increases to ∼37.4% from ∼30.5% of the pristine sample. Compared to reduced LCTNi, the reduced LCTNi-Ce exhibits greater OA proportion (∼46.1% vs. ∼37.4% of reduced LCTNi), indicating that the Ce decorated cathode shows an increased oxygen vacancy concentration. It is concluded that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the LCTN-Ce cathode is indeed enhanced, that is, step 1 for the CO2-SOEC reaction is improved.

(d) ECR results of reduced LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce porous electrodes at 800 °C with the atmosphere quickly switching from 50% CO2/50% CO to 70% CO2/30% CO. CO-TPD curves of reduced LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce powders: (e) CO (m/z = 28) and (f) CO2 (m/z = 44). 
The ECR measurement was applied to analyse the oxygen exchange process on the electrode surface. Fig. 9(d) shows the normalized conductivity curves of reduced LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce porous electrodes as a function of relaxation time at 800 °C with the atmosphere quickly switching from 50% CO2/50% CO to 70% CO2/30% CO. The corresponding ECR curves at 750 and 700 °C are presented in Fig. S21.† Obviously, the re-equilibrium time of reduced LCTNi-Ce is shorter than that of reduced LCTNi (∼400 vs. ∼600 s at 800 °C, ∼440 vs. ∼620 s at 750 °C, and ∼520 vs. ∼650 s at 700 °C), indicating that the oxygen exchange process on the LCTNi-based cathode can be accelerated by the decorated CeO2 nanoparticles. In other words, steps 2 and 3 for the CO2-SOEC reaction are improved over the LCTN-Ce cathode. CO-TPD measurement was carried out to investigate the CO desorption characteristics on the surface of reduced LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce electrodes. Fig. 9(e) and (f) present the detected signals of CO (m/z = 28) and CO2 (m/z = 44), respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 9(e), there is a CO desorption peak at ∼470 °C for reduced LCTNi, while no peak exists for reduced LCTNi-Ce. It means that the produced CO by CO2 electrolysis hardly adsorbs on the surface of Ce decorated electrode, that is, CO can be more easily desorbed from the LCTNi-Ce cathode surface than from the LCTNi cathode surface. As shown in Fig. 9(f), three CO2 desorption peaks are observed owing to the oxidation of CO during CO-TPD measurement. The peak at low temperature (∼100 °C) is attributed to the desorption of physically adsorbed CO2, and the other two peaks at higher temperature (∼360 and ∼470 °C) are ascribed to the decomposition of chemically adsorbed CO2.35,54 Moreover, the sum of peak area of reduced LCTNi-Ce is smaller than that of reduced LCTNi, agreeing with the increased oxygen vacancy concentration in the Ce decorated electrode. Thus, step 4 for the CO2-SOEC reaction is also improved over the LCTN-Ce cathode. Thanks to the comprehensive effect of the increased oxygen vacancy concentration (Step 1), enhanced oxygen exchange process (Steps 2 and 3) and improved CO desorption capacity (Step 4), the LCTNi-Ce cathode exhibits better electrochemical performance for CO2 electrolysis, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8.
In addition, the Faraday efficiency of the LCTNi-Ce cathode cell for CO2 electrolysis was found to be close to ∼100%. Fig. S22† shows the electrochemical performances of LCTNi and LCTNi-Ce cells in 90% CO2/10% H2 at 800 °C and the corresponding faradaic efficiency under a constant current of 240 mA cm−2. The faradaic efficiency of the LCTNi-Ce cell is 96.9%, and that of the LCTNi cell is ∼99.8%. The LCTNi-Ce cell also exhibits better short-term stability than the LCTNi cell under the electrolysis conditions.
4 Conclusions
In this work, a Ce decorated LCTNi electrode was successfully prepared by the hydrothermal treatment process and applied as a CO2-SOEC cathode material. The results of XRD, SEM, TEM-EDS and XANES/EXAFS demonstrate the in situ exsolved Ni NPs after reduction treatment and confirm the decoration of highly dispersed CeO2 in the as-synthesized LCTNi-Ce. H2-TPR and XPS analysis show the co-presence of Ce4+/Ce3+ pair in LCTNi-Ce under operation conditions, which enhanced the oxygen vacancy concentration. The EIS and ECR tests prove the improved oxygen exchange process over the LCTNi-Ce cathode, and the CO–TPD curves reveal the enhanced CO desorption capacity. Owing to the facilitation of four elementary steps for the CO2-SOEC reaction, the Ce decorated cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in the CO2/CO as well as the CO2/H2 atmosphere. Compared to the LCTNi cell, the LCTNi-Ce cell has greater current densities at 800 °C and 1.3 V of −0.429 A cm−2 in 50% CO2/50% CO and −0.557 A cm−2 in 50% CO2/50% H2. The corresponding Rp values are decreased to 1.748 and 0.514 Ω cm−2 under OCV condition. This work provides a valuable reference for the design of functional materials toward diverse energy conversion processes.
