    , Accepted 10th March 2019First published on 11th March 2019AbstractSuppressed charge recombination and facilitated charge collection are critical for achieving perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with improved efficiency and stability. Herein, a multifunctional 2D polymeric semiconductor is incorporated into perovskite ink to assist the crystal growth of perovskite films with large grains and fewer defects. Anchoring heterogeneous polymeric molecules on perovskite not only enhances the efficacy of defect passivation at the grain boundaries and/or surface but also facilitates the charge extraction and collection, as evidenced by thermal admittance spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Accordingly, the PSCs incorporated with a polymeric semiconductor achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 21.1% (aperture 0.16 cm2) and 19.5% (aperture 1.0 cm2), featuring an illustrious open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V (corresponding to a small voltage loss of 0.39 V) and an improved device operational stability (∼90% initial efficiency retained after constant one sun illumination for 500 h). This work highlights the effectiveness of using multifunctional passivation agents capable of providing surprisingly robust efficacy in defect passivation of perovskite, which are also advantageous to crystal growth modulation and carrier dynamic management for efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Recent years have witnessed the rising prominence of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite (OIP) materials by virtue of their remarkable optoelectronic properties, such as a high absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, etc.1–6 Much effort has been devoted to optimizing the film deposition technique, perovskite composition and device architecture which has boosted the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to 23.7%.7
High-quality perovskite films are crucial to realize highly efficient and stable PSCs.8–12 However, a fast reaction of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) would often result in perovskite films with uncontrolled crystal sizes and incomplete surface coverage during the film preparation.13–15 Previous studies have demonstrated strategies such as a Lewis-base adduct approach (slow-down crystallization rate)16–20 or template-assisted heterogeneous nucleation route (facilitate the nuclei formation)21,22 to enlarge the grain sizes and improve the surface coverage of perovskite films. For instance, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),23 fullerene24,25 or fullerene derivatives26–29 have been widely employed as a heterogeneous nucleation template to modulate the perovskite film formation with large grains and improved surface coverage. However, there is a dilemma in the utilization of such additives to improve the quality of perovskite films, because the heterogeneous additives were either insulated or light absorbents (especially in the visible light region),26,30 which would impair charge extraction or exert a light absorption competition with active perovskite materials. Moreover, in some cases, the additives themselves could act as recombination centers depending on their intrinsic electronic properties. On the other hand, the as-prepared polycrystalline perovskite films inevitably contain a high density of uncoordinated ion defects at surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs), which can lead to severe charge recombination, and thus impair device performance.17,30–32 Hence, it is highly desirable to explore a new type of multifunctional additive that is capable of simultaneously modulating the crystal growth, passivating the defects, and facilitating the charge transfer and collection, while without engaging in light absorption competition and charge recombination.
Herein, we demonstrate that simply incorporating a small amount of 2D polymeric additive, i.e. graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), into the perovskite ink not only helps in constructing compact perovskite films with large grains and high crystallinity, but also effectively passivates the defects within the perovskite films. This new g-C3N4-assisted crystal growth modulation and defect passivation strategy results in significantly enhanced efficiency and stability of PSCs. The g-C3N4 additives were heterogeneously concentrated around the GBs, which could serve as the carrier shuttles to facilitate charge separation and extraction, and thus suppress the charge recombination within the devices. Evidence of the effectiveness of this strategy is the concurrent enhancement of photocurrent density (Jsc), photovoltage (Voc) and negligible hysteresis.
Results and discussion
The methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) film was fabricated via a gas-assisted spin-coating process, in which the perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving equimolar amounts of PbI2 and CH3NH3I with or without a small amount of g-C3N4 added (denoted as with or w/o g-C3N4, see the Experimental section for details). As can be seen in Fig. 1a, the g-C3N4 incorporation is beneficial to improve the crystallinity of the resultant perovskite film, as evidenced by the increased intensity of all CH3NH3PbI3 characteristic peaks.8 In particular, the main (110) and (112) peaks have witnessed the most significant enhancement, suggesting that g-C3N4 can affect the crystal growth to a preferred orientation.17 To investigate how g-C3N4 interacts with the perovskite, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were analyzed. As displayed in Fig. S1,† pristine g-C3N4 exhibited stretching vibration at 807 and 1313 cm−1, which can be assigned to the typical C–N and CN vibration.33,34 Similar stretching vibration at these two positions was observed in the g-C3N4 incorporated CH3NH3PbI3 film, accompanying a shift to a higher value in comparison to pristine g-C3N4. These results reveal that the g-C3N4 additive remained and chemically interacted with the perovskite film. This notion is further supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 1b and S2†). It is revealed that the Pb 4f signal shifted to a lower binding energy after g-C3N4 incorporation (Fig. 1b), indicating that the undercoordinated Pb2+ ions or clusters in CH3NH3PbI3 can be effectively passivated by the lone pair electrons from N atoms in g-C3N4, thus increasing the electronic cloud density.35,36 Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) was used to investigate the conductivity of the corresponding perovskite films. As displayed in Fig. 1c and d, it turned out that the g-C3N4 modified perovskite film presented a significantly enhanced current signal compared with the control sample, suggesting the improved conductivity of perovskite films upon g-C3N4 incorporation for improved carrier transport capability. The functions of the 2D polymeric g-C3N4 additive are multifaceted, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1e. Firstly, during the film deposition process, g-C3N4, that was well-dispersed in the perovskite precursor, served as the heterogeneous site to facilitate nucleation and formation of the g-C3N4/perovskite intermediate composite. The perovskite intermediates merged together and evolved into large grains upon Ostwald ripening in the annealing process,11,37 which spontaneously extruded the heterogeneous component and thus keeping the g-C3N4 condensed at GBs and/or the film surface owing to the polymeric characteristics of g-C3N4. This is evidenced by the uniform anchoring of heterogeneous g-C3N4 at the GBs or the surface of the perovskite grains, as is shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. S3†). Secondly, the N atom in g-C3N4 enabled coordination bonding with dangling Pb2+ in CH3NH3PbI3, which slowed down the crystallization rate to support the growth of large grains with preferred orientations and more importantly exerted add-on defect passivation functions for improved device performance.15,30,38 Last but not least, the conductive g-C3N4 network condensed at the GBs and passivated the defects, which could function as an efficient carrier shuttle to facilitate the charge separation and transfer and also suppress charge recombination (discussed in a later section). The beneficial effect of g-C3N4 assisted heterogeneous nucleation on crystal growth modulation of perovskite films is investigated.

As presented in Fig. 2a, the control CH3NH3PbI3 film showed a small grain size (around 200 nm) with noticeable pinholes and a rougher surface (a root-mean-square value of 15 nm, Fig. S4a†). The grains were disorderly oriented with numerous tortuous GBs (Fig. 2b). For the g-C3N4 modified CH3NH3PbI3 film, fewer pinholes, large grains (∼500 nm in size, Fig. 2c) and a smoother surface (a root-mean-square value of 9.6 nm, Fig. S4b†) were observed. The g-C3N4 modified CH3NH3PbI3 film showed fewer GBs and possessed an optimized film thickness (∼450 nm) that is comparable to the size of the grains (Fig. 2d), which is beneficial to facilitate the charge transfer and charge collection.35,39–41

We then investigated the impact of g-C3N4 incorporation on the optical and electronic properties of the perovskite film. The light harvesting capability has been largely improved for the g-C3N4 incorporated CH3NH3PbI3 film, especially in the wavelength region of 350–550 nm (Fig. S5†), as a result of the improved quality of perovskite films with enlarged grains, increased thickness and enhanced crystallinity.42 The improved quality of the g-C3N4 incorporated perovskite film can be confirmed by the significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity as compared to the control analogue (Fig. S6†), which implies suppressed nonradiative recombination that is related to the reduced trap states by g-C3N4 passivation, which will be discussed in detail later. Overall, it can be concluded that g-C3N4 was beneficial to improve the light harvesting capability and suppress charge recombination of the perovskite films, which is favourable to fabricate high-performance PSC devices.
We evaluated the effect of g-C3N4 incorporation on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with a device architecture of FTO/compact TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of the control or g-C3N4 based PSCs are displayed in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The g-C3N4 incorporated PSCs attained a high PCE of 21.1%, along with a photocurrent density (Jsc) of 23.0 mA cm−2, a photovoltage (Voc) of 1.16 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.79, which represented a 17% enhancement in PCE as compared to the control PSC (a PCE of 18.0% along with a Jsc of 21.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V and an FF of 0.77). The hysteresis index (HI) values for the PSCs with or without the g-C3N4 additive have been included in Table 1. Specifically, the PSC incorporated with g-C3N4 showed a smaller HI value of 0.43%, as compared to that of the control device without g-C3N4 (5.8%). This can be ascribed to the facilitated charge extraction and collection, as well as effective defect passivation upon g-C3N4 additive incorporation, thus leading to significantly suppressed J–V hysteresis.43Fig. 3c shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PSCs in a wavelength region from 400 to 800 nm. A noticeable IPCE enhancement was characterized for the g-C3N4 incorporated PSC, especially in the wavelength region from 350 nm to 550 nm, which is in good accordance with the observed enhanced light harvesting capability (Fig. S5†) in this region and thus contributing to a higher Jsc. Fig. 3d depicts the stabilized photocurrent density of the champion g-C3N4 based PSC as measured at 0.95 V, resulting in a stabilized PCE of 20.8% under AM 1.5G illumination. The PCE histogram of g-C3N4 based PSCs was plotted from data collected from a batch of 30 devices (Fig. S7†), and shows that over 80% of the cells had PCEs above 20% under 1 sun illumination. This result highlights the excellent reproducibility of this g-C3N4 additive engineering method. The stability of encapsulated PSCs fabricated with or without g-C3N4 under realistic operating conditions was measured. We fabricated PSCs incorporated with different amounts of g-C3N4, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† Clearly, the optimal content for the g-C3N4 ingredient within the perovskite ink is 0.1 wt%, and a champion PCE up to 21.1% has been achieved. Herein, the content of g-C3N4 within the perovskite ink should be carefully adjusted. In one case, too less g-C3N4 (0.05 wt%) will result in an insufficient defect passivation function. In another case, too much g-C3N4 (0.2 wt%) will significantly impair the device performance, which can be ascribed to the formation of a perovskite film with a poor morphology, i.e. observable pinholes and small grain sizes (Fig. S8†). It should be noted that the dispersity of the g-C3N4 additive in the perovskite ink is not that good, and the increasing contents of heterogeneous polymeric g-C3N4 will inevitably result in severe aggregation on its own, which will exert an adverse effect on perovskite crystal growth and film formation. In addition, the aggregated clusters will also serve as recombination centers, thus lowering the charge collection efficiency and device performance. As a result, the g-C3N4 based PSCs showed enhanced operational stability under continuous one sun illumination, with 90% of the initial PCE retained after 500 h. For the reference device, the PCE decreased with prolonged illumination to only 46% of the original PCE after being tested for 300 h (Fig. 3e). It is generally believed that the degradation of perovskite materials tends to be initialized from the defective surface, especially the grain boundaries.44 In our work, the significantly enhanced operational stability of the PSCs incorporated with g-C3N4 can be attributed to the improved quality of the perovskite films with high-crystallinity, large grains and fewer defects, as well as reinforced grain boundaries induced by g-C3N4 assisted surface modification and functionalization.44 Large-area PSCs using the g-C3N4 modified perovskite films were also fabricated. The J–V curve of a PSC with an aperture of 1 cm2 demonstrated a PCE of 19.5%, along with a Jsc of 22.2 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.14 V and a FF of 0.77 (Fig. 3f).

To further elaborate the rationale behind device performance enhancement, the effect of the g-C3N4 additive on the charge carrier dynamics and defect passivation efficacy within the devices and/or at the interfaces has been studied. We measured the PL spectra of the different CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on a FTO/TiO2 substrate (Fig. 4a). As a result, PL quenching has been observed at the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 + g-C3N4 interface, indicating more efficient electron extraction owing to the carrier shuttle functions induced by g-C3N4 incorporation. This fact was further supported by much faster time-resolved PL decay (Fig. 4b). Specifically, the corresponding PL lifetime was calculated to be 17 ns when the g-C3N4 modified CH3NH3PbI3 film was deposited on TiO2, which represents only half of the value for pristine CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on TiO2 (33 ns). To better understand the ultrafast photo-excited carrier dynamics upon g-C3N4 incorporation (i.e. charge transfer process with a timescale of picoseconds),43 we conducted femtosecond (fs) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy characterization on perovskite films sandwiched between a TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and spiro-MeOTAD hole transport layer (HTL). As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the contour plot of the TA spectrum of both control and g-C3N4 modified CH3NH3PbI3 exhibited a distinct ground-state bleaching (GSB) peak at ∼750 nm, and its intensity can reflect the photoinduced carrier population in the conduction and valence bands of CH3NH3PbI3.45,46 It is noticeable that the induced absorption change (ΔA) intensity of the GSB signal gradually decreased with prolonging delay time (Fig. 4e and f), indicating that the photoinduced electrons and holes in CH3NH3PbI3 were progressively extracted out to TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD, respectively. After incorporating with g-C3N4, the GSB peak intensity at the same delay time of the perovskite film appeared to be much weaker, which is coincident with the more promptly faded signal in the contour plot as compared to the control CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 4c and d). Accordingly, the decay kinetics of the GSB were analyzed and interpreted, which showed a much faster decay for the sample with g-C3N4 incorporation (Fig. 4g). This result verified the roles of g-C3N4 in functioning as carrier shuttles for significantly accelerated charge extraction and collection from the perovskite to the respective carrier transport layers.47 In addition, transient photocurrent decay of the corresponding PSCs was compared (Fig. S9†), which indicated that the charge transport time of the g-C3N4 incorporated PSC was shorter than that of the control devices, again confirming that the photogenerated charges in the g-C3N4 modified perovskite film could be extracted out and collected more efficiently.

Photoelectrochemical characterization can offer a useful perspective to understand the charge recombination and carrier lifetime within devices.48 Accordingly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out under varied applied bias from −0.8 to −1.0 V in the dark and the Nyquist plots are depicted in Fig. 5a and b.49–52 Accordingly, the recombination resistance (Rrec) and carrier lifetime (τe) of the PSCs were calculated by fitting the EIS spectra with an equivalent circuit model (Fig. S10†) and the corresponding values are summarized in Table S2.†48–50 As a result, the PSC incorporated g-C3N4 showed a larger recombination resistance and longer carrier lifetime (Fig. 5c, d and Table S2†) as compared to its control counterpart. In addition, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurement was also performed to characterize the charge recombination within the PSCs based on different CH3NH3PbI3 films (Fig. 5e).53,54 Obviously, the carrier lifetime is longer in the device with g-C3N4 incorporation when compared with the control CH3NH3PbI3-based counterpart, suggesting the suppressed charge recombination for the former device. The suppressed charge recombination can be attributed to the facilitated charge extraction at both the ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL interfaces and effectively reduced trap state densities owing to the g-C3N4 induced GB functionalization and defect passivation. We performed thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) to quantify the trap density of states (tDOS) for the devices fabricated with or without the g-C3N4 additive. As is shown in Fig. 5f, one can observe the significantly reduced tDOS for the g-C3N4 device in both the deeper trap region (0.40–0.55 eV), which corresponded to defects at the film surface, and shallower trap region (0.30–0.40 eV), which is assigned to traps at GBs.55 The reasons for the remarkable reduction of trap state densities upon g-C3N4 incorporation are multifaceted. Firstly, the g-C3N4 incorporation helps to enlarge the grain sizes and increase the crystallinity, thus reducing the bulk trap densities of the resultant perovskite films. Secondly, the g-C3N4 featuring a soft and mechanically flexible framework can effectively passivate the defects, such as the under-coordinated ions located at the GBs and/or surface of perovskite film. More importantly, the g-C3N4 provides a surprisingly robust efficacy in defect passivation effect on perovskite owing to its polymeric nature with numerous exposed N atoms (lone pair electrons). Overall, it is worth noting that the defect passivation can be attributed to the beneficial effects of g-C3N4 incorporation, which not only functions as an efficient “carrier shuttle” for facilitating charge extraction and collection, but also suppresses the charge recombination, thus greatly contributing to a higher Voc and PCE.

Conclusions
In summary, the perovskite ink incorporated with a small amount of g-C3N4 was demonstrated for large-scale fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs. PSCs incorporated g-C3N4 showed impressive PCEs up to 21.1% with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2 and 19.5% with an aperture area of 1 cm2. The g-C3N4 semiconductor exhibited multiple functionalities, including modulation of crystal growth and film formation of perovskite via heterojunction nucleation, effective passivation of undercoordinated Pb clusters, and facilitation of charge extraction and collection via embedded carrier shuttle paths. The PSCs with g-C3N4 incorporation exhibited negligible J–V hysteresis and improved operational stability with nearly 90% of the initial PCE retained under continuous 1 sun illumination for 500 h. This work provides a new insight to use simple and low-cost multifunctional semiconductor materials towards the fabrication of large-scale perovskite photovoltaics with improved efficiency and stability.
Experimental section
Preparation of perovskite thin films
PbI2 and CH3NH3I (MAI) with a molar ratio of 1:1 were dissolved in a mixed DMF and DMSO solution (4s:1 by volume ratio) with a 0.1 wt% g-C3N4 additive added. g-C3N4 was prepared by a traditional thermal polycondensation method of dicyandiamide at 500 °C.34 The perovskite precursor was then spin-coated onto a cleaned and UV-ozone treated FTO substrate via a gas-assisted method at 6500 rpm for 30 s. The as-spun films were annealed at 115 °C for 10 min.
Device fabrication
The hole-transporting precursor solution was prepared by dissolving spiro-MeOTAD and additives of lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (in acetonitrile) and 4-tert-butylpyridine dissolved in chlorobenzene and then spin-coating on top of the perovskite layer to serve as a HTL. The devices were completed by thermal evaporation of Au as the counter layer.
Materials and device characterization
Morphological observation was carried out with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Quanta 200F FEI). The crystallinity of the prepared perovskite films was measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was performed with a Bruker (Dimension FastScan Bio). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) was performed with a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The J–V performances of the solar cells were determined using an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator (Class AAA), and the light intensity was calibrated to AM 1.5G one sun conditions (100 mW cm−2) by using a calibrated KG5 filtered silicon reference cell (Peccell Technologies). The J–V curves of the PSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The device was masked with a metal aperture to define an active area of 0.16 cm2. The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 330 to 800 nm using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp fitted with an Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4 m monochromator. The photoluminescence (PL) measurement was carried out with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FluoroMax-4) as a function of emission wavelength ranging from 650 to 850 nm with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed using an in-house setup. Samples were photoexcited with 532 nm laser pulses (30 ps FWHM, 1 μJ cm−2 per pulse) at 50 Hz and the signal was recorded at 780 nm with a 10 nm bandwidth. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was performed using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium) as a frequency response analyzer. Steady-state and modulated illumination was provided by a light emitting diode (435 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, PP211). Modulation intensities were restricted to less than 5% of the steady-state intensity and were determined in the 10 Hz to 10 kHz frequency range. The steady-state illumination intensity ranged from 8 to 273 mW cm−2. The EIS measurements were carried out by using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz without illumination conditions and under different applied biases from −0.8 V to −1.0 V.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) characterization
Transient absorption measurement was conducted by using a regeneratively amplified Ti:Sapphire laser source (Coherent Legend, 800 nm, 150 fs, 5 mJ per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate) and Helios (Ultrafast Systems LLC) spectrometers. A portion of the 800 nm output (75%) pulse was frequency-doubled in a BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal, which could generate 400 nm pump light; meanwhile the remaining portion of the output was concentrated into a sapphire window to produce white light continuum (420–780 nm) probe light. The 400 nm pump beam was generated as part of the 800 nm output pulse from the amplifier and its power was adjusted by using a range of neutral-density filters. The pump beam was focused at the sample with a beam waist of about ∼360 μm and the power intensity was fixed at 14 μJ cm−2 in this experiment. With the aid of a mechanical chopper, the pump repetition frequency was synchronized to 500 Hz. The probe and reference beams could be split from the white light continuum and sent into a fiber optics-coupled multichannel spectrometer by using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors with a frequency of 1 kHz.
