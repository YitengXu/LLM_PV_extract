    , Accepted 7th April 2019First published on 9th April 2019AbstractPt-Decorated Ir black (Pt@Ir) nanoparticles with two varying Pt mass fractions (Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84) were generated by a facile method in water with the aid of Ir black. The Pt@Ir nanoparticles were investigated as a bifunctional oxygen catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. Benefiting from the good dispersion of ultrafine Pt nanodots on the Ir black surface and the synergistic effect between the Pt and underlying Ir atoms, Pt@Ir nanoparticles have exhibited outstanding ORR activity and comparable OER performance in comparison with commercial Ir black. In particular, Pt16@Ir84 shows an ORR mass activity of 2.6 times that of commercial Pt black and exhibits much better bifunctional performances than a mixture of Pt black and Ir black with a Ir/Pt mass ratio of 50/50 (Pt50Ir50). Our work highlights the effectiveness of decorating Ir black with Pt nanodots to fabricate bifunctional oxygen catalysts.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, it has become more and more urgent to develop efficient energy storage and conversion devices with low environmental impact due to accelerated depletion of fossil fuels.1–3 A unitized regenerative fuel cell (URFC) can combine hydrogen production and consumption in one device and serve as an electrochemical energy conversion/storage system with high specific energy and no self-discharge for long term storage.4 It can be applied for remote off-grid power sources or act as a renewable energy source when cooperating with solar and wind energy systems.5 One key matter in the exploitation of URFC technology is the synthesis of corrosion-resistant bifunctional oxygen catalysts (BOCs) for catalyzing oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in high efficiency, especially in acidic media. In the past few decades, many significant investigations on BOCs used in acid electrolytes have been focused on binary Pt–IrO26–16 and Pt–Ir17–29 catalysts, together with a few of ternary Pt–RuO2–IrO230 and Pt–Ru–Ir31 catalysts included. Conventional BOCs were obtained by mechanically mixing commercial Pt black with Ir black or Ir/Ru oxides.20,25,32 However, both of them can hardly be highly dispersed, resulting in low bifunctional performances.10 To address this problem, Ir or IrO2 supported on Pt black8,28,30 and, more commonly, IrO2 supporting Pt nanoparticles9–11,13,15,16 were developed as BOCs and showed better dual-functional activities than the mixed ones. These supported BOCs could not only get a better dispersion of the active component for the ORR or OER, but also offer a possibility of a synergistic effect between two kinds of active components.28,29
It has been demonstrated that Pt is one of the best catalysts for the ORR and Ir is one of the most stable elements against corrosion. Therefore, Ir is widely accepted as the core element to construct Ir core Pt shell (Ir@Pt) catalysts for the ORR.33–36 Among these studies, a positive effect of the Ir core acting on the Pt shell towards the ORR has been reported, which is mainly induced by the Ir core to moderate the binding of oxygen to the Pt surface.35 However, Ir@Pt core–shell catalysts could not be used as BOCs when the Ir (active for the OER) core was completely covered by the Pt (sluggish for the OER) shell. Inspired by these achievements, we have tried our best to fabricate BOCs comprising the Ir core partially covered by Pt nanoparticles to achieve excellent activities for both the ORR and OER.
In this study, we used commercial Ir black as the OER catalyst and decorated it with Pt nanodots by a facile synthesis method. Intriguingly, we discovered that Pt nanodots could be successfully dispersed on Ir black with the aid of water without using any other reducing agents. The ORR and OER performances of the Pt@Ir catalysts were thoroughly investigated via a typical three-electrode electrochemical system equipped with a potentiostat. For comparisons, commercial Ir black and its mixture with Pt black were also investigated. The results showed that decorating Ir black with Pt nanodots would greatly enhance the ORR activity though at the expense of sacrificing a little bit OER performance of Ir black. Importantly, when the Pt content exceeded 15% mass fraction of the total catalyst, the Pt@Ir catalyst displayed a superior activity towards the ORR compared to the commercial Pt black catalyst, which demonstrated that our newly designed catalysts have great potential in utilizing as ORR and bifunctional catalysts in oxygen electrodes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Potassium chloroplatinite (K2PtCl4) was acquired from Shenyang Research Institute of Nonferrous Metal. Commercial Pt black and Ir black were acquired from Johnson Matthey. Isopropanol (99.9%) was acquired from Aladdin. Nafion solution (5 wt%) was acquired from DuPont. Perchloric acid (HClO4, 70.0–72%) was acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the chemicals in the experiment were used without further purification. The water used in all tests was ultrapure (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm).
2.2. Synthesis of Pt-decorated Ir black (Pt@Ir)
In a typical synthesis of Pt16@Ir84, a given amount (0.1 mmol, 19.2 mg) of commercial Ir black was dispersed in ultrapure water (24 mL) in a vial under sonication for 30 minutes. Then it was placed in an oil bath at a temperature of 100 °C under magnetic stirring. Upon stirring for 15 minutes, K2PtCl4 (400 μL, 50 mmol L−1) aqueous solution was added rapidly into the vial under stirring. The mixture was kept at 100 °C for 12 hours under stirring and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed four times using ultrapure water and dried overnight in an oven at 60 °C before electrochemical measurements. Pt4@Ir96 was synthesized using a similar method with different amounts of K2PtCl4 and Ir black (100 μL of 50 mmol L−1 K2PtCl4 and 19.2 mg of Ir black). The Pt50Ir50 catalyst obtained through mixing commercial Pt black with Ir black at a mass ratio of 50:50, a composition most commonly found for the mixed catalyst in previous studies,6,18,32 was used as a reference catalyst.
2.3. Physical characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2000EX microscope. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping were performed via a JEM-2100F (JEOL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on an Empyrean diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm). The elemental compositions of those as-prepared catalysts were measured by EDX on a JED-2300 analysis station equipped with a scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDX, JSM-IT300). The surface chemical characteristics were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer with a monochromatized Al (Kα) source. XPS peaks were fitted using XPS PEAK 4.1 software. Inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was performed on a PerkinElmer ICP-OES 7300 DV.
2.4. Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical tests were performed at 30 °C on an electrochemical station (GAMRY Interface 1000E) coupled with a system of a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The inks for the electrochemical measurements of the Pt@Ir catalysts were prepared by adding 50 μL Nafion into 1 mL of the isopropanol suspension containing 5.0 mg catalyst, followed by sonication for at least 30 minutes. As a contrast, an ink containing Pt50Ir50 was prepared by adding 5.0 mg of Pt black and 5.0 mg of Ir black into a mixture of isopropanol (2 mL) and Nafion (100 μL), followed by sonication for more than 30 minutes. A working electrode was prepared by loading 4 μL of ink on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) (0.196 cm2). A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a Pt foil served as reference and counter electrodes, respectively, in a three-electrode electrochemical system. All potentials were presented versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The electrolyte was an aqueous HClO4 solution (0.1 mol L−1). According to the Ir and Pt contents in the inks, the Ir and Pt loadings on the GCE for Pt50Ir50, Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84 were 0.0488 and 0.0488 mg cm−2, 0.0933 and 0.0039 mg cm−2, and 0.0815 and 0.0155 mg cm−2, respectively. The Pt loading for Pt black on the GCE was 0.0974 mg cm−2, and the Ir loading for Ir black was 0.0976 mg cm−2.
The ORR and OER activities were tested separately for all the catalysts. Prior to ORR tests, all catalysts were cycled 20 times between 0.05 and 1.20 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in a N2-purged electrolyte to clean their surface. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded under the same conditions, except that the scan rate was changed to 50 mV s−1 for three cycles. The ORR linear sweep voltammetry curves (LSVs), swept from 0.20 to 1.05 V at 10 mV s−1, were recorded in an O2-saturated electrolyte at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. The background current was recorded by running the ORR linear sweep profile in a N2-purged electrolyte before the ORR polarization measurements. It was subtracted from the ORR current to eliminate the contributions of capacitive current.37 ORR accelerated durability tests (ADTs) were performed in an O2-saturated electrolyte in a potential range between 0.6 and 1.0 V at 100 mV s−1 for 5000 cycles. After ADTs, the ORR activities were measured in a fresh electrolyte under the same conditions as used for the above ORR measurements. All the current densities were compensated for solution resistance correction. To measure solution resistance, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at open circuit voltage with an AC potential amplitude of 10 mV from 106 to 103 Hz after the CV and LSV measurements. Solution resistance was extracted through the X-intercept of the Nyquist plot in the high-frequency region.
Prior to OER measurements, the electrochemical oxidation process was performed by the CV technique within a potential range from 0.05 to 1.42 V at 100 mV s−1 for 60 cycles to prepare a catalytically active OER catalyst.38 The CV curves were recorded in the same potential range for three cycles at 50 mV s−1. The electrochemical surface areas were calculated through integrating the charge from the hydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd) region located between 0.05 and 0.30 V. The LSV curves were swept from 1.20 to 1.64 V at 5 mV s−1 and 1600 rpm to evaluate OER activity. The compensation for solution resistance (iR correction) was used as the same as ORR activity measurements. To investigate the OER stability, chronopotentiometry curves were recorded for 2 h at 1.96 mA, resulting in a current density of 10 mA cm−2. After the durability test, the electrolyte was replaced by a fresh one, and the CV, LSV, and EIS measurements were repeated. All the measurements were performed in a N2-purged 0.1 mol L−1 HClO4 electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical characterization of Pt-decorated Ir black (Pt@Ir)
The Pt@Ir nanoparticles were obtained through a one-pot method that was seldom reported previously. The final mass compositions of Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84 were determined by SEM-EDX (Fig. S1 and S2†). The Pt/Ir nominal compositions for Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84 are Pt5/Ir95 and Pt17/Ir83, respectively. The SEM-EDX results showed that Pt/Ir real compositions of the synthesized nanoparticles were consistent with their corresponding nominal compositions, implying that Ir black has been successfully decorated with Pt species. To investigate the unique reaction mechanism of K2PtCl4 being reduced in water without adding any other conventional reductants, the composition of the supernatant after a typical synthesis of Pt16@Ir84 was checked by ICP-OES. 0.459 ppm of Ir ions was detected, indicating a galvanic replacement between Ir black and K2PtCl4. However, only a slight amount (calculated 0.7%) of K2PtCl4 was consumed by galvanic replacement, signifying that the vast majority of K2PtCl4 was reduced by water since no other reducing agents were added. Interestingly, the Pt nanoparticles cannot be obtained when the Ir black was replaced by Vulcan XC-72 under the same reaction conditions as the typical synthesis for Pt16@Ir84, which implies the irreplaceable role of Ir black in inducing water to reduce Pt ions. Moreover, the surface analysis of chemical valence of Pt in Pt16@Ir84, shown in Table 2, indicates that 97% of Pt is in the Pt0 form. Thus, we conclude that the Pt element detected by SEM-EDX on Pt-decorated Ir black nanoparticles indeed forms through reduction but not hydrolysis of K2PtCl4 by water; otherwise Pt mostly in the form of Pt0 cannot be deduced by XPS analysis. Therefore, we attribute the reaction of K2PtCl4 reduced by water with the aid of Ir black to a noble metal-induced reduction (NMIR) mechanism which was first proposed by Yadong Li.39 Based on this mechanism, the Ir atoms on the surface of Ir black catalyze water to reduce Pt2+, leading to the formation of small Pt nanodots decorating the Ir black surface. Recently, the NMIR strategy has been used to synthesize bimetallic nanocrystals for various catalytic applications.39–44 Here, the novel method to obtain a bifunctional electrocatalyst provides three advantages as follows. Firstly, it is easier to obtain a clean catalyst in the absence of any organic agents. Secondly, the Pt nuclei only form in situ on the Ir black surface, resulting in good dispersion of Pt nanodots on the surface of Ir particles, which is quite beneficial for Pt utilization. Thirdly, a synergistic effect could be achieved between the two active components, which would be good for catalytic activity.
XRD patterns of the as-prepared Pt-decorated Ir black (Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84) are shown in Fig. 1, with the profiles of Ir black, Pt black and their mixture (Pt50Ir50) also included. The strong diffraction peaks of Ir black and Pt@Ir are assigned to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystalline planes of the face-centered cubic Ir metal (JCPDS No. 87-0715), whereas for Pt black and its mixture with Ir black (Pt50Ir50) the (222) crystalline plane, representing the typical face-centered cubic crystalline structure of the Pt metal (JCPDS No. 87-0640), can also be observed. Moreover, the diffractograms of Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84 exhibit the same patterns as Ir black with no characteristic peaks of metallic Pt detected. The reason for this observation might be that the Pt nanoparticles are ultrafine; thus we call them nanodots. However, the XRD pattern of Pt50Ir50 displays that all peak positions are identical to those of Pt black beyond that the corresponding peak patterns of Pt50Ir50 are broadened, similar to that of Ir black. The crystallite sizes and lattice parameters of the studied catalysts were calculated from the XRD data using Jade software, with results shown in Table 1. The crystallite sizes calculated from the (111) diffraction peaks of the investigated catalysts vary between 3.3 and 8.6 nm. Specifically, the crystallite size for the Pt-decorated Ir black catalysts (Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84) is 3.4 nm, approaching that for pure Ir black (3.3 nm), which demonstrates that Pt decoration hardly affects the size of Ir black. Besides, the lattice parameters are almost the same for Ir black and Pt-decorated Ir black, meaning that the lattice of the former is not affected by the decoration of Pt. However, for Pt50Ir50, the calculated crystallite size is 7.4 nm, which is located between that of commercial Pt black (8.6 nm) and Ir black (3.3 nm), showing a mixture characteristic. Besides, the lattice parameter of Pt50Ir50 comes close to the value of Pt black.

TEM observations were made to confirm the structure of Ir black and Pt16@Ir84, together with Pt black and its mixture with Ir black (Pt50Ir50) for comparisons. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively, both Ir black and Pt black aggregate severely; thus Pt50Ir50, shown in Fig. 2(c), is the mixture of the agglomerates. In contrast, the structure of Pt16@Ir84, displayed in Fig. 2(d), is the same as that of Ir black, which demonstrates that decorating Ir black with Pt does not change the structure of the former. The comparisons of HRTEM images of Ir black (Fig. 2(e)) and Pt16@Ir84 (Fig. 2(f)) clearly demonstrate the success of decoration of Ir (111) facets with Pt nanodots exposing the (111) facets. To further check the distribution of Pt and Ir elements in the Pt16@Ir84, HAADF-STEM and EDX mapping analyses were performed and are shown in Fig. 2(g). The EDX mapping images verify that the Pt nanodots are finely dispersed on Ir black for Pt16@Ir84.

The surface compositions of the catalysts were characterized by XPS. Survey spectra of Pt black, Ir black, Pt50Ir50 and Pt16@Ir84 are shown in Fig. S3,† in which the C 1s and O 1s peaks come from the carbon conductive tape adopted as the supporting material for catalysts. The surface element fractions were calculated based on those survey spectra of Pt and Ir 4f signals. The surface mass ratio of Pt for Pt50Ir50 is 47.0%, which approximates to that obtained by EDX (47.3%, Fig. S4†). Whereas for Pt16@Ir84, its surface mass percentage of Pt is 32.1%, different from that gained by EDX (15.8%, Fig. S2†), reflecting a great elevation of the Pt content on the surface for the Pt-decorated Ir black sample.
The high-resolution XPS spectra of Pt black, Ir black, Pt50Ir50 and Pt16@Ir84 are displayed in Fig. 3. Each region relative to the 4f7/2 or 4f5/2 spin–orbit component can be deconvoluted into two doublets, which can be assigned to metallic Pt0 or Ir0 and oxidized Pt2+ or Ir4+, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the binding energies (B.E.) of Pt0 4f7/2 and Ir0 4f7/2, together with the percentage of Pt and Ir in metallic or oxidation states for Pt50Ir50 and Pt16@Ir84, with the data of Pt black and Ir black included for comparisons. The results reveal that the B.E. of Pt0 4f7/2 shifted toward the positive direction for Pt16@Ir84 (71.17 eV) while that of Pt50Ir50 showed no shift relative to Pt black (71.07 eV). When compared with Ir black, the B.E. of Ir0 4f7/2 shifted toward the negative direction for Pt16@Ir84 (60.75 eV), but no shift occurred for Pt50Ir50 (60.97 eV). We can clearly conclude that the electronic structure of Ir changed after Pt decoration, which suggests that the intra-atomic-charge transfer process from Pt to Ir occurred.45

3.2. Electrochemical performances of Pt-decorated Ir black (Pt@Ir)
Considering the fact that the unique morphology of Pt nanodots partially covered the surface of Ir black, the Pt@Ir nanoparticles could be used as active catalysts for the ORR and OER. After cycling 20 times at 100 mV s−1 between 0.05 and 1.20 V in a N2-purged electrolyte for electrochemical cleaning, the cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves of Ir black, Pt black, Pt50Ir50, Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84 are recorded within 0.05–1.20 V at 50 mV s−1. As presented in Fig. 4(a), all CV profiles reveal peaks related to the adsorption/desorption of H on Ir or Pt within 0.05–0.30 V,46,47 with these peaks being more distinct for the catalyst with a greater Ir content. Usually, the electrochemical surface area (Aecsa) of Pt black can be estimated via integrating the charge of the hydrogen underpotential deposition (Hupd) region with the double-layer charge subtracted.37 However, the calculation of catalysts’ Aecsa by integrating the Hupd region from Fig. 4(a) is evidently not appropriate. The adsorption and desorption of hydrogen contributed by Ir are greater than those of Pt, which will over-estimate the Aecsa of Pt. To overcome this difficulty, Aecsa calculations were performed after an electrochemical oxidation process was performed by the CV technique within a potential range from 0.05 to 1.42 V at 100 mV s−1 for 60 cycles, when the majority of Ir was oxidized to IrOx (exhibited no Hupd) while the Hupd of Pt remained unchanged (Fig. 4(b)). The XPS analysis (Fig. S5†) of the Pt16@Ir84 sample initially and after the electrochemical oxidation process further verifies that almost all Ir0 has been oxidized to Ir4+. The calculation of catalysts’ Aecsa through the integration of the Hupd region according to Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S6† is presented in Table 3. The Aecsa values of Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84 increase in line with the Pt content enhancement, varying from 18.3 m2 gPt−1 for Pt4@Ir96 to 28.7 m2 gPt−1 for Pt16@Ir84. As expected, the Aecsa value of Pt16@Ir84 exceeds that of commercial Pt black (18.3 m2 gPt−1), which should be ascribed to the high dispersion of Pt nanodots on the Ir black surface. In contrast, the Aecsa value of the Pt50Ir50 (14.0 m2 gPt−1) is inferior to that of commercial Pt black, indicating a screening effect of Ir black covering the active sites of Pt black.

The activities for the ORR of Ir black, Pt black, Pt50Ir50 and Pt-decorated Ir black catalysts (Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84) were studied using the RDE technique, with anodic LSVs shown in Fig. 4(c). The results denote that all the catalysts containing Ir present an ORR onset potential inferior to that of Pt black, indicating the poor ORR activities of the Ir-based catalysts. Similar results have been displayed previously.22,34,35 Obviously, these catalysts (except for Pt50Ir50) exhibit half wave potentials and current densities obtained through the normalization of electrode's geometric area (j) (Table 3) increasing in the order of Ir black < Pt4@Ir96 < Pt16@Ir84 < Pt black, in line with the enhancement of the platinum content.
More specific analysis of the ORR performance at 0.85 V was conducted by using the mass activities (jk) (Table 3) calculated through the well-known Koutecky–Levich equation.48 Excitingly, although a bit lower than for Pt black, the jk value of Pt4@Ir96 is almost equal to that of Pt black, given the Pt4@Ir96 only reserving 4 wt% of the platinum content. This demonstrates the effectiveness of decorating Ir black with the Pt component to enhance the ORR performance of Ir black. However, it may be difficult for practical applications with such a low Pt loading when the durability is to be considered. Thus, we further increase the Pt content to 16 wt%. Strikingly, the jk value for Pt16@Ir84 (373.3 mA gPt−1) is 2.6 times that of Pt black (142.9 mA gPt−1). Here, the 1.6 times elevation in mass activity of Pt16@Ir84 can be partially attributed to the high dispersity of Pt nanodots on the surface of Ir black, resulting in a higher Aecsa value than that of Pt black (Table 3). However, the 0.6 times enhancement in Aecsa alone cannot explain the 1.6 times enhancement in the mass activity of Pt16@Ir84. Thus, we calculate the specific activity, an indicator of the intrinsic activity of a catalyst,49 of Pt16@Ir84 and Pt black. As displayed in Fig. S7,† the results show that the specific activity (js) of Pt16@Ir84 is 1.30 mA cm−2, which is 1.7 times that of Pt black (0.78 mA cm−2), indicating an obvious enhancement of intrinsic activity. Previously, the positive effects of Ir importing on the ORR activity of Pt have been reported.50–52 Here, the enhancement of intrinsic activity can be partially attributed to the adsorbate–adsorbate repulsion between the OH adsorbed on a Pt atom and the OH or O adsorbed on neighboring Ir atoms.53 The OH on Pt is adverse for the ORR; thus a destabilization of OH on Pt would enhance its ORR kinetics. Besides, the multilayer Pt of Ir@Pt core–shell nanoparticles has been shown to bring about a noticeable increase in the intrinsic activity of Pt,35 whereas monolayer Pt on the Ir core results in an evident loss of intrinsic activity in comparison with pure Pt due to over-weakening of the binding of oxygen to the Pt surface.54 In this work, the structure of Pt16@Ir84 nanoparticles with the Ir black surface partially covered by Pt nanodots can be considered as multiple layers of the Pt shell on the Ir core structure locally, as evidenced by HRTEM analysis (Fig. 2(f)). Thus, the enhancement of intrinsic activity of Pt16@Ir84 should be partially put down to the electronic effect of Ir acting on Pt (as evidenced by XPS analysis) in addition. Ir serves to weaken the binding of oxygen to the Pt surface, resulting in more active sites for Pt16@Ir84 relative to Pt black. More importantly, the jk value for Pt16@Ir84 is 6.9 times that of Pt50Ir50 (53.8 mA gPt−1). The inferior performance of Pt50Ir50 towards the ORR should be assigned to the screening effect of Ir black acting on the Pt black, which not only lowers the Aecsa of Pt black (Table 3) by covering its active sites, but also worsens its intrinsic activity (Fig. S7†). Moreover, the TEM and EDX mapping characterisation of Pt16@Ir84 reveals that no obvious morphology change occurs after the ORR test (Fig. S8†). XPS analysis for Pt16@Ir84 after the ORR test verifies that the changes of the surface element composition and valence are minimal (Fig. S9(a and b) and Table S1†). Besides, no Pt species in the tested electrolyte could be detected by ICP-OES. All the above analyses of Pt16@Ir84 after the ORR test coincidentally verify that the Pt nanodots are rather stable during the ORR test.
Moreover, the OER catalytic performances of all catalysts were also measured through the RDE technique, with the LSVs for the OER shown in Fig. 4(d). The results reveal that the OER activities decrease with the increase of the platinum content in the tested catalysts, showing an opposite tendency to that exhibited for the ORR. Usually, the current at an over potential of 300 mV (1.53 V) was introduced as a reference to compare the OER activities.55 The values of current densities based on the geometric area (j) at 1.53 V decrease in the sequence of Ir black > Pt4@Ir96 > Pt16@Ir84 > Pt50Ir50 > Pt black (Table 3), confirming that the OER activity exhibits a positive correlation with the Ir content. With regard to the values of current densities per mass of iridium (jm), Pt4@Ir96 exhibits a jm value of 216.8 mA mgIr−1, comparable to that of Ir black (217.0 mA mgIr−1). It shows no deterioration of the OER activity of Ir black when partially covering it with a small amount of Pt, such as 4 wt%. Unfortunately, when the Pt content was increased to 16 wt%, such as Pt16@Ir84, the current density fell to 151.6 mA mgIr−1, representing a drop of 30% of jm when compared to that of Ir black. It implies that further increasing the Pt content in decorating the Ir black would severely deteriorate its OER performance. The lower jm value of Pt16@Ir84 towards the OER can be attributed to the screening effect caused by ultrafine Pt nanodots overmuch covering the active sites of Ir black. It is in accordance with the XPS results showing that the Pt content on the surface is 32.1 wt% for Pt16@Ir84. In contrast, for Pt50Ir50, although the mass ratio of Pt is as high as 50%, the current density of Pt50Ir50 reaches 214.8 mA mgIr−1. It demonstrates that the Pt black with a larger crystallite size compared with that of Pt16@Ir84 has no screening effect on the OER performance of Ir black. Profitably, the agglomerates of Pt black may construct electron conduction paths along the agglomerates of Ir black, which is beneficial for OER activity.8 Moreover, the TEM and EDX mapping images of Pt16@Ir84 show obvious migration and slight aggregation of Pt nanodots after the OER test (Fig. S10†), which is different from that of Pt16@Ir84 after the ORR test. It signifies that the Pt nanodots are moveable under wide potential sweep (0.05–1.42 V). However, no Pt species in the tested electrolyte could be detected by ICP-OES, indicating that the Pt nanodots are hardly dissolved under OER test conditions. As shown in Fig. S9(c and d) and Table S1,† XPS analysis of Pt and It 4f regions for Pt16@Ir84 after the OER test demonstrates that the surface Ir species is mostly oxidized to Ir4+ while the surface Pt component is slightly oxidized to Pt2+. In a word, the above analyses of Pt16@Ir84 after the OER test verify that the Pt nanodots are moveable but dissolution and oxidation resistant due to the synergistic effect between the surface Pt and underlying Ir atoms during the OER test.
The potential gap (ΔE) between the OER potential corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej=10) and the ORR potential at a current density of −3 mA cm−2 (Ej=−3) is often employed to assess the dual-functional oxygen activity for BOCs,2,56,57 where a lower value of ΔE means better overall oxygen activity. The ΔE values for Pt50Ir50, Pt4@Ir96 and Pt16@Ir84 are summarized in Table 4, together with the potential values of Ej=10 for the OER and Ej=−3 for the ORR. The ΔE decreases in the sequence of Pt4@Ir96 (768 mV) > Pt50Ir50 (711 mV) > Pt16@Ir84 (677 mV), showing the importance of a proper Pt content in the Pt-decorated Ir black as BOC. Above all, only Pt16@Ir84 exhibits an optimal balance between the ORR and OER activities and thus presents a better bifunctional performance than Pt50Ir50, since a too low Pt content leads to inferior ORR activity, and a too high Pt content renders inadequate Ir active sites, thereby sluggish OER activity.

Furthermore, to determine the practicability of Pt16@Ir84 as a BOC, its stabilities in both ORR and OER operation conditions are estimated separately. A potential cycle of 5000 cycles within 0.6–1.0 V was applied to evaluate the long-term stability towards the ORR, together with Pt50Ir50 for comparison. Fig. 5(a) and (b) compare the changes of ORR performances and surface Pt mass fractions, respectively, for Pt50Ir50 and Pt-decorated Ir black (Pt16@Ir84) evaluated initially and after the ORR ADT. Fig. 5(a) clearly shows that Pt16@Ir84 presents a less negative shift of LSV than Pt50Ir50, indicating better ORR durability of the former. Fig. 5(b) demonstrates that the variation trend of the ORR mass activities at 0.85 V is consistent with that of surface Pt mass fractions for the two catalysts, which signifies that the leaching of the surface Pt component is responsible for the deterioration of ORR performances. XPS characterisation of two catalysts was also performed after the ORR ADT. As displayed in Fig. S11,† the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ir 4f regions show an obvious elevation of Ir4+ proportions while those of Pt 4f regions present no obvious changes of Pt oxidation states when compared with that of Fig. 3. Thus, both the loss of the Pt component and the elevation of Ir4+ proportions contribute to the deterioration of ORR activities of two catalysts. Specifically, after the ORR ADT the Pt16@Ir84 maintains a jk value of 314.6 mA mgPt−1 (Table S2†), which is 20 times that of Pt50Ir50 (15.6 mA mgPt−1). It should be noted that this value is still 6 times higher than the initial jk of Pt50Ir50 (53.8 mA mgPt−1). This enhanced durability could be owing to the specific structure of Pt decorating Ir black since the surface Pt nanodots could be stabilized by the underlying Ir carrier, as indicated by the results of TEM, XPS and ICP-OES analyses taken after the ORR ADT. TEM and EDX mapping characterisation (Fig. S12†) reveals that no obvious morphology change occurs after the ORR ADT for Pt16@Ir84. Table S3† displays the variations of the surface element composition and valence obtained from XPS analyses of two catalysts initially and after the voltage cycles. The decrease of the surface Pt atomic ratio of Pt16@Ir84 after the potential sweeps is significantly lower than that of Pt50Ir50 (5.4% vs. 22.9%), which is consistent with the ICP-OES analysis shown in Table S4.† What's more, the comparisons of changes of surface element valence verify that Pt16@Ir84 is more anti-oxidized, especially for the Ir element, which could be attributed to the synergistic effect between the surface Pt and underlying Ir atoms. It should be noted that the Ir species are more stable towards electrochemical leaching while Pt dissolves rapidly during the ORR ADT, especially for Pt50Ir50. It again verifies the effectiveness of using Ir black as the support for Pt nanodots to fabricate bifunctional oxygen catalysts.

(a) ORR polarization curves recorded between 0.20 and 1.05 V with background current subtracted and iR-drop corrected. (b) ORR mass activity at 0.85 V and surface Pt mass ratio taken from XPS analyses. (c) OER polarization curves with iR-compensation. (d) OER mass activity at 1.53 V and surface Ir mass ratio taken from XPS analyses. 
The OER durability of the above two catalysts is tested using the chronopotentiometry method performed at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for two hours. The chronopotentiometry curves (Fig. S13†) show that the potential of Pt16@Ir84 is below 1.60 V and rather stable during the durability test while for Pt50Ir50 it grows rapidly from 1.44 to 1.91 V in less than two hours, indicating a superior OER durability of the former. OER LSV curves of two catalysts were also recorded after the ADT. Fig. 5(c) and (d) compare the variations of OER performances and surface Ir mass ratios, respectively, for Pt50Ir50 and Pt-decorated Ir black (Pt16@Ir84) evaluated initially and after the OER ADT. Fig. 5(c) shows that the OER performance for Pt16@Ir84 enhances slightly while for Pt50Ir50 it degenerates severely after the ADT, which further verifies the superb stability of Pt16@Ir84. Fig. 5(d) displays that the change tendency of the OER mass activities at 1.53 V is in line with that of surface Ir mass ratios for the two catalysts, which signifies that the variation of the surface Ir content is responsible for the deterioration or enhancement of OER performances. TEM and EDX mapping characterisation for Pt16@Ir84 reveals that the surface Pt nanodots aggregate and grow into large particles after the OER ADT (Fig. S14†). XPS characterisation for two catalysts was also performed after the OER ADT. As displayed in Fig. S15 and Table S5,† the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ir 4f regions, especially for Pt50Ir50, show a drastic enhancement of Ir4+ proportions while those of Pt 4f regions present a slight increment of Pt2+ ratios when compared with that of Fig. 3. Specifically, the jm value of Pt16@Ir84 after the OER ADT slightly increases to 175.6 mA mgIr−1, while for Pt50Ir50 it plummets to 91.0 mA mgIr−1 (Table S2†). It should be noted that the Pt16@Ir84 exhibits a 15.8% enhancement in the jm value after the OER ADT, whereas Pt50Ir50 shows a degradation percentage of 57.6%. The enhanced OER activity of Pt16@Ir84 can be attributed to the aggregation of surface Pt nanodots rendering more active sites of inner layer Ir to be exposed, which is verified by the enhancement of the surface Ir atomic ratio (Table S5†) retrieved from XPS analyses. As a contrast, the deteriorated OER activity of Pt50Ir50 can be assigned to the severe leaching of OER active component-Ir during the durability test, which is proved by the ICP-OES analysis (Table S6†). Moreover, the superb OER durability of Pt16@Ir84 could be owing to the specific structure of Pt decorating Ir black in which the underlying Ir atoms were well protected by the surface Pt nanodots, as indicated by the results of TEM, XPS and ICP-OES analyses taken after the OER ADT. Besides, it should be noted that the Pt nanodots supported on Ir black are as stable as Pt agglomerates in the mixture of Pt and Ir black during the OER ADT, as shown in Table S6,† which is beneficial for Pt-decorated Ir black utilized as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst. The comparisons of potential gap (ΔE) after the OER ADT displayed in Table S7† further verify that the Pt16@Ir84 exhibits much better bifunctional performances than Pt50Ir50.
4. Conclusions
In summary, Pt nanodots could be successfully deposited on Ir black using water as the reductant to yield bifunctional oxygen catalysts of Pt@Ir with controllable compositions. The galvanic replacement between Ir black and the Pt precursor and the noble metal-induced reduction that Ir black catalyzes the water reducing Pt2+ are believed to answer for the formation of Pt@Ir nanoparticles. XRD, SEM-EDX, HRTEM and HAADF-STEM results prove that ultrafine Pt nanodots are well dispersed on the surface of Ir black, and the XPS results demonstrate the electron transfer from Pt to Ir. ORR activities show an ascendant tendency towards the increase of the Pt content, while a too low Pt content leads to insufficient ORR activity when compared with Pt black. Besides, OER activities exhibit a positive correlation with the proportion of Ir, whereas a too high Pt content leads to sluggish OER activity, which can be explained by the initial blockage of Ir active sites by Pt. In particular, Pt16@Ir84 shows an ORR mass activity of 373.3 mA mgPt−1 which is 2.6 times that of the Pt black (142.9 mA mgPt−1). More importantly, Pt16@Ir84 has exhibited much better bifunctional activity and durability in comparison with Pt50Ir50, with potential application for URFCs.
