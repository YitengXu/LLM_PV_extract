    , Accepted 28th November 2012First published on 29th November 2012AbstractThe photovoltaic performances of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been studied for ZnO porous films prepared by different techniques. A comparison is made between nanoparticle (NP) films prepared by a sol–gel method and two different electrodeposited (ED) nanoporous films. The D149 indoline dye/ZnO with ZnO prepared by electrochemistry at rather high overvoltage has been found to be the best system. The cell functioning has been studied in-depth by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements made over a large potential range, in the dark and under illumination. It is shown that a much deeper sub-conduction band edge density of states (DOS) exists in the case of NP cells compared to ED cells. The electron dynamics have been analysed by determining the charge carrier lifetimes and transport/collection times. In the case of NP films, the charge carrier behaviour is characterized by rather long lifetimes and transport times with a marked voltage response typical of conduction that is governed by trapping–detrapping events. On the contrary, in the case of electrodeposited films, these two parameters are much shorter and the transport is characterized by a straight charge transport. Using photoluminescence data, the charge carrier lifetimes have been related to the surface defects of the ZnO nanostructures. The deduced electron collections were found to be very efficient with values greater than 90%. We have also determined that the ZnO film conductivities were higher than for anatase TiO2, and that the electron diffusion coefficient was higher in the ED film compared to the NP film.
1 Introduction
Interest in the study of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has grown considerably in recent years from both fundamental and applied viewpoints.1–3 Owing to their simple fabrication and potentially low production costs they can be regarded as attractive photovoltaic devices for mass production. The most typical DSSC consists of a nanoparticle anatase TiO2 photoelectrode and a platinum counter-electrode separated by an iodide-triiodide (I−/I3−) liquid electrolyte.4 Zinc oxide has recently emerged as a promising alternative semiconductor material to TiO2, with marked performance improvements of ZnO-based DSSCs achieved during the last few years.5–10 The potential advantages of ZnO in DSSCs include a fast charge transport with an electron mobility several orders of magnitude higher compared to anatase TiO2.11 This property is supposed to ensure a high charge collection efficiency and to facilitate the change of the redox shuttle in new generation solar cells with higher open circuit voltage (Voc) for instance.12–14
During the last decade an impressive variety of ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized and assembled as thin films by various growth methods. For instance, highly efficient DSSCs have been made using nanoporous ZnO films.8,9 Other ZnO nanostructures successfully investigated in ZnO-based DSSCs include nanowires,11,15 nanorods,16–18 nanotubes,12 nanoparticles,3,9,19,20 tetrapods,21,22 nanoflowers23 and hierarchical structures.7,24,25 Most of these structures combine fast electron transport but inefficient sunlight harvesting or, on the other hand, efficient light harvesting but slow electron transport due to traps at the grain boundaries caused by the sintering process used to ensure the electrical continuity between the nanoscale building blocks of ZnO. Among these ZnO photoelectrodes, nanoporous ZnO films prepared by electrodeposition are especially interesting due to their high performances combined with a low temperature growth route. The deposition/crystallization process occurs in solution and produces an oxide material with high crystallinity.26,27 The electrochemical preparation of ZnO photoelectrodes is compatible with flexible lightweight plastic substrates28,29 and can be easily upscaled for mass production.
Various metal-free organic dyes with high absorption coefficient have been investigated as sensitizers of TiO2 and ZnO for DSSC applications. These molecules have to meet several important requirements such as a good intramolecular charge transfer upon excitation, a fast regeneration by the redox couple in solution, an efficient charge injection in the conduction band of the oxide and a LUMO (lowest unoccupied molar orbital) energy sufficiently higher than the conduction band edge energy.30 The first requirement is achieved by using D–Π–A molecular structures, D being a donor group, A an acceptor group and Π a long conjugated chain.31 The anchoring group is localized in the vicinity of the acceptor group in order to favor the swift electronic charge transfer to the oxide after excitation.30,31 In the case of ZnO, indoline dyes, especially D149 and its derivative D205, yield solar cell devices with high efficiencies.8–10,13,24–31 Indoline dyes exhibit not only remarkable performance but also a relatively inexpensive manufacturability due to their simple preparation procedure.32,33
In a previous paper9 we have compared DSSCs made with a nanoporous electrodeposited ZnO film (ED-ZnO), prepared by a low temperature growth technique, and those made with porous sintered nanoparticles (NP-ZnO). The layers were sensitized by various dyes. We have pointed out that the recombination rate is higher in the ED-ZnO cells compared to the reference NP-ZnO films prepared by a classical sol–gel technique.9 This seems to be contradictory to the performance results since we have also reported that the ED-ZnO devices outperformed the NP-ZnO cells in terms of overall conversion efficiency. In the present study we have carefully investigated the electron dynamics in three different types of ZnO solar cells. The investigation has been carried out by impedance spectroscopy which is a powerful technique for the understanding of the DSSC performance.34–36 The effect of ZnO preparation technique and film structure has been studied by comparing two different types of ED-ZnO films with a reference NP-ZnO film prepared by the sol–gel technique.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the ZnO porous layers
Fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass sheets (TEC-10 from Pilkington) were used as the substrate. They were carefully cleaned in steps with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min each. For the ZnO nanoparticle film preparation (hereafter designated as NP-ZnO), the substrates were additionally heated at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the last organic traces. The film was prepared by the doctor-blade technique from a paste using a blend of ethylcellulose (Fluka) and ZnO nanoparticles with a size of about 20 nm using a procedure described previously.9 The film was annealed at 410 °C for 30 min before sensitization. The electrodeposition was carried out in a three-electrode cell. The reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (with a potential at +0.25 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode) placed in a separate compartment maintained at room temperature. The FTO/glass substrate was fixed to a rotating electrode and used as the working electrode. The rotation speed was set at 300 rpm. The bath temperature was controlled at 70 °C. It contained initially 0.1 M KCl (Aldrich) as the supporting electrolyte and 5 mM ZnCl2 (Merck) and was saturated with molecular oxygen by vigorous bubbling. The counter-electrode was a zinc wire. A thin continuous blocking ZnO layer was then produced on the FTO for 10 min.37 In the solar cell, this layer acted notably as a barrier to avoid the direct contact of the DSSC electrolyte and the FTO substrate and favored the adhesion of the nanoporous second layer. This layer was then electrodeposited by addition of eosin Y (EY) (Panréac) in the bath.27 Two different deposition conditions were used in this work: (i) 200 µM EY and an applied potential of −0.8 V vs. SCE for 20 min and (ii) 50 µM EY with an applied potential of −1.0 V vs. SCE for 20 min. In both the cases, EY was codeposited with ZnO. The eosin Y incorporated in the film was subsequently removed by soaking in a KOH solution at pH 10.5 overnight, according to a procedure described by Yoshida et al.38 In the following study, the ZnO films electrodeposited according to (i) and (ii) are designated as ED1-ZnO and ED2-ZnO, respectively. The film thicknesses were measured with a Dektak 6M stylus profilometer. The sample morphologies were examined with a high resolution Ultra 55 Zeiss FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at 293 K and the continuous wave (CW) PL was excited by the 4th harmonic (266 nm) line of an YAG:Nd laser and dispersed with a HR250 monochromator (Jobin-Yvon) coupled to an UV-enhanced Intensified Charge Coupled Device (ICCD) (Roper).
2.2 Cell preparations and characterizations
The ZnO films were sensitized using two different dyes, namely the D149 organic indoline dye (Chemicrea, Inc.)30 and the Ru-based dye known as N719 (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)) (Solaronix). After a heat treatment at 150 °C for 30 min, the porous ZnO films were immersed upon cooling in a solution of 0.5 mM D149 and 1 mM cholic acid in a 1:1 volume mixture of acetonitrile–tert-butanol or in a solution of 0.5 mM N719 with one equivalent of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide added in the same solvent mixture. The impregnation time of D149 dye was 15 min for the ED-ZnO films and 2 h for the NP-ZnO film. In the case of the N719 dye, the sensitization time was 2 h for all the ZnO films.
The counter-electrode was prepared using a FTO glass substrate (TEC7, Pilkington) cleaned by ultrasound in acetone and ethanol for 5 min each. Thereafter, it was treated in a furnace for 30 min at 450 °C to remove organic contaminants. The Pt catalyst was deposited onto the FTO glass by spreading a 10 µL drop of H2PtCl6 solution (6 mg Pt in 1 mL ethanol) followed by subsequent heating at 400 °C for 30 min. This step was repeated once. The two electrodes were sealed with a 60 µm hot melt spacer (Surlyn, DuPont) and the internal space between the two was filled with the electrolyte through a hole drilled in the counter electrode, which was subsequently sealed with Surlyn and aluminum foil. The electrolyte choice was dependent on the sensitizing dye. The D149 electrolyte composition was 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) in acetonitrile and the N719 electrolyte was a mixture of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85/15 volume ratio).
The J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 digital sourcemeter, using a 0.01 V s−1 voltage sweep rate. The solar cells were illuminated with a solar simulator (Abet Technology Sun 2000) filtered to mimic AM1.5G conditions. The illuminated surface was delimited by a black mask with an aperture diameter of 4 mm. The power density was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by the use of a reference silicon solar cell. The impedance spectra were measured on solar cells with a surface area of 0.3 cm2 over a large potential range before and after Voc, in the dark and under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination, by a Solartron FRA1255 coupled with a PAR273 potentiostat. The AC signal was 10 mV and the frequency range was 100 kHz–0.1 Hz. The spectra were fitted and analysed using the Zview modeling software (Scribner). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results are corrected for IR-Drop over the sum of all series resistances with the real potential (V) applied determined by the subtraction of the voltage drop (VDrop) from the applied potential (Vapplied). The voltage drop is calculated by the integration of the sum of all series resistances (RAseries) over the current passed (V = Vapplied − VDrop; with VDrop = ∫RAseriesdI whereby RAseries = Rs + Rce).
The D149 and N719 dye loadings of the photoelectrodes were measured by dye desorption in 4 mL of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and in 4 mL of KOH, pH 10.5, respectively. The dye concentration in solution was subsequently titrated by spectrophotometry using 72350 L mol−1 cm−1 at 530 nm and 13730 L mol−1 cm−1 at 500 nm for the D149 and N719 molar extinction coefficients, respectively. The dye densities in the films were then calculated.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows SEM images of the three studied ZnO films after dye sensitization. The NP-ZnO films were made of ZnO nanoparticles sintered at 410 °C (Fig. 1a). They were porous with an open structure and large pores. Fig. 1b–f shows SEM views of the electrodeposited films. These films were prepared in soft conditions with thermal steps that never exceeded 150 °C. The ED1-ZnO film was synthesized at high structure directing agent concentration and at rather low electrodeposition overvoltage, −0.8 V per SCE. Fig. 1b depicts that it had a smooth surface. A zoomed in view of the film cross-section (Fig. 1c) shows the presence of narrow interconnected pores. They are oriented perpendicular to the substrate and the porosity is open at the film surface; therefore these structures can be soaked with the cell electrolyte. The pore size was in the 10 nm range. Porous films can be electrodeposited even at rather low overvoltage for which EY is not reduced electrochemically (Fig. 1b and c)26 but, in that case, EY concentration in the deposition bath must be rather high. In Fig. 1d–f, images of a film prepared at lower eosin Y concentration and higher overvoltage (−1 V per SCE) (ED2-ZnO) are shown. The film consists of large rounded coalesced grains. We have shown elsewhere26 that each grain is single crystalline and contains a fine network of nanopores. In Fig. 1f, the cauliflower-like aspect of the film surface and the porosity are observed. In Fig. 1e, an enhanced view of the film cross-section confirms the fine nanoporosity of the ED2-ZnO layer. The characteristics of the pores appear to be similar to those of ED1-ZnO films. The pore formation and properties of the ED2-ZnO films have been studied in detail in our previous work.9

The photoluminescence spectra of the films at room temperature are presented in Fig. 2. The spectrum of the NP layer is characterized by an intense UV emission (386 nm) due to exciton recombination. No visible emission due to the radiative recombination at material defects is found and the layer is of high structural quality. In the case of ED films the UV emission is much weaker, in part due to lower layer thicknesses. It is shifted to lower wavelength (378 nm) and a shoulder at low wavelength is observed. The shift of the emission could be due to the presence of some hydroxide remaining in the layers because no high temperature annealing was used here. A second broad emission is now present which is centered at 550 nm. It is classically assigned to structural intrinsic defects in thin layers.39–41 However, for nanostructured films, as is the case here, it can be assigned to surface defects.42,43 The intensity ratio between the UV peak intensity and the visible peak intensity (IUV/Ivis) is a measure of the nanostructured film structural quality.44 It is found to be 5.1 and 3.6 for ED1 and ED2, respectively. It suggests that the ED2 film had more surface defects than the ED1 film.

The ZnO films have been sensitized either by the D149 metal-free indoline organic dye or by the classical N719 Ru–bipyridine complex. The dye loadings are reported in Table 1. We can note that in the case of the D149 dye, the dye loadings were very similar for the different ZnO structures. These measurements show that the surface area per film thickness unit is similar for the ED1-ZnO and ED2-ZnO films and is much lower for the NP-ZnO film. To compensate the lower surface area, the optimized photoelectrode layers based on nanoparticles were thicker than the electrodeposited ones (Table 1).

The J–V curves recorded under calibrated illumination are presented in Fig. 3 and their characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Compared to our previous study,9 the NP-ZnO and ED2-ZnO cell performances have been significantly improved mainly due to higher fill factors (FF). The performances of the ED1-ZnO cells, prepared using novel electrodeposition conditions, remain below those of the ED2-ZnO cells for both D149 and N719 dyes. In Table 1 we can observe that the N719 dye loading is higher than that of the D149 dye due to a smaller projected size of the former compound (1.50 nm2 instead of 2.17 nm2 calculated using an ellipsoidal projected shape). However, Jsc values measured with the N719 dye are lower due to the significantly lower molar extinction coefficient of the Ru–bipyridine complex (see Experimental section).

In the next part of the paper, we focus on the D149/ZnO cells because they showed the highest conversion performances. We have investigated in detail the effect of ZnO layer morphology on the solar cell functioning by using EIS.34–36 Typical impedance spectra of a D149 sensitized ED2-ZnO cell measured at variable applied forward bias voltages in the dark and under illumination are presented in Fig. 4a and c and Fig. 4b and d, respectively. The effect of ZnO film preparation on the impedance spectra recorded at various voltages is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). All the spectra showed a characteristic low frequency semicircle which is assigned to the resistance to charge transfer (recombination) (Rct) across the sensitized oxide–electrolyte interface coupled to the total capacitance (denoted as Cµ). At high frequency, a second semicircle was observed due to the resistance (RPt) and capacitance (CPt) of the charged counter-electrode–electrolyte interface (see Fig. S2 of the ESI†). Finally, in the intermediate frequency range, an ∼45° straight-line segment could be observed in the dark and for some illuminated devices which is characteristic of the electron transport by diffusion and is modeled by a transport resistance, Rtr. The full equivalent circuit used to fit the spectra is shown in Fig. 4e. The transmission line in Fig. 4e is used to model the photoelectrode response which consists of a series of distributed elements along the porous film thickness. It supposes a diffusion/recombination phenomenon of the photogenerated charges in the photoelectrode and the absence of a space charge region. When the transport resistance Rtr was negligible, the spectra were fitted by the simplified circuit presented in Fig. 4f. In Fig. 4e, Zd is the diffusion of the redox couple in the electrolyte. This step was not limiting in our system (no significant low frequency third loop) and this parameter has been neglected in the following study. The electrical parameters of the equivalent circuit of Fig. 4e or 4f have been determined from the fit of the spectra. Some fits are reported in Fig. 4a–d.

µ values determined from the spectral fitting in the dark and under illumination are presented in Fig. 5 as a semilogarithmic plot versus the applied forward bias voltage corrected for the ohmic drop. The exponential variation is clearly observed and the data have been fitted by the function (1)where kBT is the thermal energy, V is the real applied potential EF,ZnO–Eredox (Fig. 5c) and α is a parameter that accounts for the depth of the trap energy distribution below the conduction band. α = T/T0 with T0 a parameter with temperature unit that indicates the depth of the distribution. Values between 800 and 1200 K have been typically reported for nanoparticle TiO2–based DSSCs.45,46 The fits of the experimental data yield the α and T0 values given in Table 2. α is much lower in the case of the NP-ZnO cells compared to the two different ED-ZnO cells. They yield higher T0 for the former (∼2900 K) compared to the latter and indicate a deeper distribution of states in the case of the sintered nanoparticles.

In semiconductors immersed in a well-conducting electrolyte, the charge carriers present in the solid phase can be compensated by the ionic charges in the electrolyte. If the semiconductor is nanostructured and not highly doped, the variation of the applied potential produces an equivalent Fermi level shift that sweeps the density of states (DOS) localized below the conduction band edge of the semiconductor, modifying the capacitance that, in these conditions, is termed “chemical” capacitance (Cµ). It normally shows close to exponential voltage dependence which reflects the exponential distribution of states in the bandgap as illustrated in Fig. 5c.
From Cµ, the DOS parameter was calculated using the formalism proposed by O'Regan et al.:47 (2)with q denoting the electron charge, A the geometric area of the cell, L the layer thickness and p the film porosity (determined at about 0.6 for electrodeposited nanoporous ZnO films and 0.7 for the NP-ZnO film).27 The drawing of the DOS as a function of V in Fig. 5b and the scheme in Fig. 5c illustrate the deeper distribution of sub-conduction band edge states in the case of the NP-ZnO sample compared to ED-ZnO samples.
The variation of charge transfer resistance, Rct, with the applied forward bias voltage corrected for the ohmic drops occurring in the devices (V) was determined from the impedance spectra fit with the equivalent circuit presented in Fig. 4e. The results in the dark and under light are presented in Fig. 6a and in S3 (ESI†), respectively. The found exponential behavior has been quantified according to the relationship (3)where β can be considered an empirical estimation of the reaction order in sublinear recombination kinetics. The typical reported values for ZnO cells range between 0.46 and 0.70.12,20 In Fig. 6a, it is observed that the charge transfer resistances, Rct, are higher for the ED2-ZnO cell compared to the ED1-ZnO and NP-ZnO cells. A higher conduction band edge by about 60–70 mV for ED2 compared to ED1 can be observed if we refer to Fig. 5b. Taking a look at the Voc, the gain in Voc is about 20 mV. The reason for the lower than expected Voc can be seen in the low β values of ED2 cells. β values of the investigated cells have been determined under illumination and in the dark and are reported in Table 3. They are lower in the light because the interface is different compared to the dark, due to the increase in tri-iodide concentration and also to the dye conformation change. Higher slopes are found in the case of ED1-ZnO cells compared to the other cells.

The transport of electrons in ZnO photoelectrodes is characterized by the resistance Rtr in Fig. 4e. When the transport phenomenon is observed in the impedance spectra, it gives rise to an ∼45° linear section at intermediate frequencies. The Rtr from the EIS fit in the dark and under light are presented as a function of the applied potential in Fig. 6a and Fig. S3 (ESI†), respectively. For the DSSCs with ED-ZnO, no transport resistance could be determined under illumination since the Rtr was so low that it was not apparent in the Nyquist plot. The Rtr values are significantly lower than those of Rct and therefore a good charge collection efficiency can be assumed.
With the used diffusion interpretation of the data, the lifetime of the electrons in the photoelectrode could be approximated to τn = RctCµ(4)and the transport/collection time by τd = RtrCµ = L2/Dn(5)where L is the photoelectrode thickness and Dn is the electron chemical diffusion coefficient.

τ
n in NP-ZnO films, in the dark, as a function of the applied voltage before ohmic drop correction is presented in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† The result is in good agreement with ref. 48. This figure also shows the effect of ohmic drop correction. The semilogarithmic plots of τn and τdversus the DOS measured in the dark and in the light are presented in Fig. 6b and c, respectively. For the various cells, τn is more than about one order of magnitude larger than τd in Fig. 6b and c and S5† (discussed below) with a positive consequence on the charge collection that is detailed in the following section. Another important observation is that both τn and τd are significantly higher in the case of NP-ZnO cells compared to the ED-ZnO cells. τd in the latter is dramatically shorter than in the former showing that electron transport in ED-ZnO is very fast. The transport in NP-ZnO is inferior because of its sintered nanoparticle structure with the presence of a large number of grain boundaries which act as traps. On the contrary, the number of grain boundaries in the electrodeposited layers is much lower and the electron transport is fast.
We have also found that the electron lifetime is much larger in NP-ZnO cells compared to ED-ZnO cells. The higher recombination rate in the latter can be explained by the film morphology first. Indeed, the NP-ZnO films have large pores which favor the dye accessibility and formation of a well-covering dye monolayer. On the contrary, the optimum sensitization of the nanoporous ED-ZnO is more difficult because of the narrow pores. A related consequence is our observation that the use of cholic acid as co-adsorbent to avoid aggregates was more critical in the case of ED-ZnO films compared to NP-ZnO films. The other reason relates to the pore surface properties. Indeed, the photoluminescence spectra (Fig. 2) suggest a much higher density of surface defects in ED-ZnO compared to NP-ZnO films. More recombination centers between charge carriers and tri-iodide must be present in ED-ZnO photoelectrodes. This is also in agreement with the observed larger lifetime in ED1 compared to ED2: the visible PL spectra (Fig. 2) show that there are more surface defects in ED2-ZnO compared to ED1-ZnO that give rise to shorter τn values.
Another difference between the two electrodes is the slope of the τ-curves. In the case of NP-ZnO, τ decreases rapidly with the DOS. For the transport time, τd, it can be assigned to the presence of traps at the grain boundaries of the sintered nanoparticles that slow down the electronic transport in the oxide. When these traps are filled, the transport is faster. The DOS (voltage) effect on τn can be explained by the increase of the energy difference between the electrons in the oxide, EF,ZnO, and the redox couple in solution which promotes the recombination and decreases τn. The behavior of the ED-ZnO cells is dramatically different. τn and τd vary to a much less extent with the DOS. The ED films are well-crystallized, their crystal grain length being the thickness of the film.26 The multiple trapping–detrapping occurs to a much less extent upon the charge transport which is faster. From the comparison of the electron lifetimes of ED1 and ED2 one can also understand why the difference in the conduction band edge between the different photoanodes is not completely transferred into Voc of the device: on one side ED2 has the lower β value and on the other side its lifetime is lower at a given DOS. This leads only to an overall gain of 20 mV instead of the expected 60 to 70 mV.
From the calculated τn and τd values, the collection efficiencies were calculated by (6)

coll are presented in Fig. 7. For all the cells that could be fully analyzed, this parameter was very good (ηcoll > 80%) and the best collection was found for the ED2 cell.

From the impedance spectroscopy spectrum analysis, the conductivity of ZnO material in the photoelectrodes was determined by (7)
In Fig. 8a, we can see that the conductivity is much higher for ED samples at low DOS but tends to level off with DOS, while for the NP sample it continues to increase. We have also reported in the same figure the conductivity of an anatase TiO2 particle film measured by EIS. TiO2 has a significantly lower conductivity than the ZnO films. In Fig. S5 (ESI†), τn and τd in the dark have been presented as a function of the film conductivity. Linear relationships are found. In this case, several assumptions are implied for the comparison such as a small mobility change of electrons between ED-ZnO and NP-ZnO samples and also that the change in conductivity is based on the change in the concentration of the electrons due to thermalisation from the states underneath the conduction band edge. The shape of the lifetime in this graph justifies these assumptions. The general trends observed in Fig. 6b and discussed above are confirmed by this representation of the data.

The diffusion coefficient of the electrons in ZnO, Dn, was also determined from the fit parameters by Dn = L2/τd(8)
In Fig. 8b, the deposit prepared at lower eosin Y concentration and higher cathodic potential (ED2-ZnO) has the best Dn. We can note that Dn remains less than that reported in dry single-crystalline ZnO nanowires (0.05–0.5 cm2 s−1).11
The average distance that electrons diffuse before undergoing transfer to the redox species is the electron diffusion length, denoted Ld. In the case of first order recombination kinetics, we have (9)
For all the investigated D149/ZnO cells, Ln is much higher than the film electrode thickness (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†) and this ensures very good charge collection efficiencies (Fig. 7). Ln are estimated at about 70, 20 and 50 µm for the NP-ZnO, ED1-ZnO and ED2-ZnO cells, respectively, and they do not vary significantly with the applied voltage.
4 Conclusion
The photovoltaic performances of ZnO-based DSSCs have been thoroughly investigated for nanoparticle films prepared by the sol–gel technique and nanoporous films prepared using two different electrodeposition conditions. The presence of surface defects in ED ZnO nanostructured films has been demonstrated by photoluminescence measurements. Indoline dye-sensitized photoelectrodes gave rise to higher performances compared to N719 dye. The functioning of the D149/ZnO cells has been studied in detail by EIS measurements. We found that the distribution of the DOS is much deeper in the case of NP cells compared to ED cells. The electron dynamics have been analyzed by determining the charge carrier lifetimes and transport/collection times. In the case of NP films, it was characterized by rather long lifetimes and transport/collection times with a marked voltage response typical of conduction governed by trapping–detrapping effects. On the contrary, in the case of electrodeposited films, these two parameters were much shorter and characterized by a straight transport. Using photoluminescence data, the charge carrier lifetimes have been related to the surface defects of the ZnO nanostructures. The deduced electron collection efficiencies in the dark were very high in both cases, greater than 90% for NP and ED2. We have determined that the ZnO film conductivities were high and the electron diffusion coefficient was highest in the ED2 film compared to the NP film. The present study demonstrates the significant interest in developing low temperature electrochemical growth techniques of ZnO porous films for advanced applications and in applying spectroscopy techniques for an in-depth understanding of device functioning.
