    , Accepted 20th November 2017First published on 21st November 2017AbstractSputtered ultrathin silver-based multilayer electrodes have emerged as promising ITO-free candidates for lightweight, roll-to-roll processable flexible organic photovoltaics due to their high conductivity, low parasitic absorption, and excellent mechanical flexibility. However, Ag-based flexible solar cells normally yield inferior device performance when compared to conventional glass/ITO analogues. In this work, we report the use of a two-resonance tapping cavity (TRTC) based transparent electrode for achieving high-performance flexible PBDBT:ITIC solar cells. To reach optimal light harvesting without significantly sacrificing the high open-circuit voltage, the non-fullerene acceptor was partially substituted by PC71BM to transform the binary blend into a ternary blend. The combination of open-circuit voltages as high as 0.88 V with short-circuit currents close to 18 mA cm−2 leads to power conversion efficiencies higher than 11% for optimal TRTC rigid cells under AM 1.5G 1-sun illumination. Remarkably, when the TRTC was integrated onto flexible PET substrates, a 10.6% efficiency was achieved for the cells, while a robust mechanical flexibility was preserved. This is the highest efficiency value ever achieved for flexible organic solar cells.
Introduction
Lightweight and mechanically flexible thin-film photovoltaic cells have attracted a great deal of interest over the last two to three decades, due to their large potential to be implemented as portable or wearable low-cost power sources.1 Indeed, organic semiconductors (small molecules and polymers) are good candidates for a wide range of cost effective, flexible and/or semi-transparent photovoltaic applications.2,3 Recently, low-bandgap polymer donors combined with the [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) fullerene acceptor in a single-junction bulk-heterojunction architecture have enabled polymer solar cell (PSC) efficiencies beyond 11%, with a certified record efficiency of 11.5%.4–7 Also, non-fullerene acceptor-based PSCs have experienced rapid progress during the past few years and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) higher than 12% were reported in the literature.8–17 Such high-performance cells are fabricated on the commonly used commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode due to its excellent optical and electrical properties. However, one of the major drawbacks of ITO film is its brittleness under bending stress, thus making it unsuitable for flexible cells.18,19 In addition to high conductivity and low parasitic absorption, an ideal transparent electrode for flexible device applications should possess superior mechanical flexibility and be compatible with large scale roll-to-roll manufacturing.
Over the past decade, many alternatives to flexible ITO have already been demonstrated and a certain level of success has been reached. Flexible solar cells employing highly conductive PEDOT:PSS,20,21 metal nanowires (AgNWs22–24 and CuNWs25), metal grids,26–28 conducting metal oxides (ZITO,29 Ga:ZnO30 and Al:ZnO31), graphene,32–34 and ultrathin metal multilayers35–41 exhibited a much better transparency, conductivity, or mechanical flexibility compared to a given flexible ITO reference cell. Nevertheless, developing truly flexible PSCs with efficiency comparable to, or even exceeding, those fabricated on glass remains challenging, mostly due to the limited choice of flexible electrodes and lack of photon management in the flexible devices. To improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art flexible cells, it is desirable that open-circuit voltage (Voc), as well as short-circuit current (Jsc), are increased. This should be achieved without a reduction in fill factor (FF).
Recently, we reported a one-dimensional optical approach based on a two-resonance tapping cavity (TRTC) for broadband light confinement in thin film solar cells.42 By tuning both the dielectric cavity layer and metallic cavity layer, an optimal light-harvesting can be reached in the cell without sacrificing the device electrical properties. Although not interpreted as a TRTC, in the past, similar electrode configurations have been used for flexible PSCs, yielding good device performances, such as Ta2O5/Al-doped Ag,36 TiO2/Ag/ITO,38 ZnO/AgOx/ZnO,41 TeO2/Ag/MoO3 (ref. 43) and ZnO/CuOx/ZnO.44,45 All such ultra-thin Ag-based multilayer configurations not only ensure competitive stability under ambient conditions but also superior mechanical stability against substrate bending cycles.38,39 Furthermore, TRTC type electrodes can be sequentially deposited at room temperature by a magnetron sputtering technique, which allows for a continuous roll-to-roll deposition on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or other plastic substrates using sputtering roll coaters.46,47 These merits make TRTC based cells one of the best configurations for flexible photovoltaic applications.
In this work, we successfully integrate the TRTC configuration on PET substrates to achieve improved efficiency in ITIC based non-fullerene flexible devices. A high-performance PBDBT:ITIC non-fullerene blend9 is considered within a TRTC, providing a broadband light absorption with the objective of maintaining a high open circuit voltage (Voc). With proper photon management, the TRTC effect on the light absorption in such a blend is increased by partially substituting the non-fullerene ITIC molecule with PC71BM, while only a mild Voc reduction is observed. When TRTC cells with an optimal ternary blend were fabricated on glass, an 11.2% PCE was reached. Moreover, when such a TRTC was integrated onto PET flexible substrates, it exhibited a 10.6% PCE, the highest value ever achieved for flexible organic solar cells. Also, after 500 bending cycles, no degradation was observed in the flexible cells.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a illustrates the flexible device architecture: MgF2/PET substrate/TRTC/SG-ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The TRTC multilayer electrode was fabricated on highly flexible PET substrates using the same procedure as for the SK10 glass substrates, as detailed in the Experimental section. The PET substrate has a refractive index of 1.58–1.62 similar to the SK10 glass; therefore, to reduce the reflectance loss of the air/PET interface we deposited a 100 nm MgF2 anti-refraction coating (ARC) layer on the other side of the substrate. The transmission spectra of PET/TRTC with and without ARC are shown in Fig. 1b. The thicknesses of the TiO2 dielectric cavity layer and Ag metallic cavity layer in the TRTC are determined by optical simulations for the specific cases, as seen in ESI Fig. S1.† Note that our purpose here is not to optimize the transmission of the flexible electrodes, but to maximize the light absorption of the active layer in the flexible cells. In this situation, the transmission of the optimal TRTC flexible electrode could be much lower than that of the commercial glass/ITO substrate (Fig. 1b).

For comparison, the transmission curves of commercial ITO/glass and MgF2/SK10 glass/TRTC are included. Here, the TRTC cell configuration is TiO2 (18 nm)/ZnO (5 nm)/Ag (9 nm)/ZnO (3 nm) and SG-ZnO is sol–gel zinc oxide. The inset is the image of the flexible PET/TRTC electrode.

(d) Optical constants for PBDBT:ITIC (non-fullerene) and PBDBT:ITIC:PC71BM (1:0.5:0.5, 50% PC71BM) blend films. 
Here, we consider the PBDBT:ITIC non-fullerene photoactive material due to its high device performance and high open circuit voltage. Unlike fullerene derivatives, the ITIC acceptor exhibits a very large extinction coefficient (k) peaked at ∼705 nm, as seen in Fig. 1c, which partially overlaps with the PBDBT polymer absorption in the 550–700 nm range. This leads to a strong and localized absorption in the red and near-infrared regions combined with a limited absorption on the blue side of the spectrum. For this reason, relatively high k values >0.7 are expected on the red side of the spectrum for the non-fullerene blend, as seen in Fig. 1d. A relatively high k value of the spectrum implies that integrating PBDBT:ITIC in a TRTC would not provide the enhanced absorption that is characteristic of such an optical cavity, as can be seen in the EQE panel shown in Fig. S1 and S2 of the ESI.† To address this issue, PC71BM was introduced into the non-fullerene binary blend, while the donor/acceptor ratio was kept at 1:1. In this way, the k value of the blend film could be finely tuned. The absorption evolution of the PBDBT:ITIC:PC71BM ternary films with different PC71BM contents is shown in Fig. S3.† With increasing the PC71BM fraction, the ternary blend absorption is gradually enhanced in the blue region, while it gets reduced at near-infrared wavelengths. It is interesting to note that the PC71BM-based ternary blend absorption edges are red shifted relative to the non-fullerene one. We would attribute this effect to the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive-induced molecular interactions between ITIC and PC71BM, as shown in Fig. S4,† leading to a more ordered ITIC nano-morphology and stronger π–π stacking interactions.48 This provides a wider overlap with the solar spectrum and an enhanced infrared photon harvesting in the ternary devices. For the optimal ternary blend PBDBT:ITIC:PC71BM = 1:0.5:0.5 (named “50% PC71BM” from now on), k is clearly reduced in the 550–750 nm range compared to the non-fullerene blend film, and the maximum value decreases from 0.7 to 0.4, as can be seen in Fig. 1c. All the optical constants of the photoactive materials were accurately determined by fitting measured transmissions for blend films with different thicknesses deposited on fused silica substrates. An excellent agreement between numerical predictions based on the transfer matrix method and experimental data was found, as shown in Fig. S5.†
The numerically computed short circuit currents as a function of the active layer thickness for both glass/ITO and glass/TRTC configurations are compared in Fig. 2a when using non-fullerene and 50% PC71BM blends. As expected, when a non-fullerene blend is used, a negligible gain in Jsc is achieved for the optimal glass/TRTC cell when compared to the glass/ITO configuration (see simulated EQEs and the experimental J–V curve in Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating that the best PET-flexible cell based on the TRTC electrode cannot surpass the performance of the glass–ITO cell. In contrast, numerical calculations show a Jsc increase by more than 1.2 mA cm−2 for the ITO device (integrated Jsc = 15.6 mA cm−2) when employing a 50% PC71BM blend. As seen in Fig. 2a, this current density can be further enhanced up to ∼18 mA cm−2 when employing the TRTC configuration. Note that the active layer thickness used for simulation purposes was kept under 140 nm in order to limit possible electrical losses commonly occuring in organic cells when the active layer thickness exceeds 100 nm, as indicated in Table S1.† The experimental EQEs shown in Fig. 2b, as well as the integrated Jsc values given in Table 1, clearly demonstrate that the TRTC combined with a ternary blend having 50% PC71BM leads to an optimal photocurrent.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the ITO and TRTC based cells with different PC71BM percentages, measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, are shown in Fig. 2c. The TRTC cell using the 50% PC71BM blend exhibited a 2.4 mA cm−2 higher Jsc than its non-fullerene ITO counterpart. A best efficiency of 11.2% for the ternary TRTC cell was obtained, which is about 15% higher than that of the optimal non-fullerene ITO or ITIC cell, as indicated in Table 1. To demonstrate the reproducibility of this approach, over 25 non-fullerene based ITO and 50% PC71BM based TRTC cells were fabricated. The PCE distributions presented in Fig. 2d demonstrate the good reliability and reproducibility of the approach.
To shed more light on the higher photocurrent of the 50% PC71BM ternary blend compared to the non-fullerene one in the ITO configuration, the electric field intensity (|E|2) distribution inside the active layer and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) were also evaluated. From the field intensity contour plot of Fig. 3a, a stronger field intensity or localization is clearly observed for the near-infrared and visible regions of the active layer. Such an enhancement is nicely reflected in the EQEs of Fig. 2b, where the 50% PC71BM cell outperforms its non-fullerene counterpart both in the visible region (<650 nm, PC71BM contribution) and in the near infrared range (730–800 nm, DIO contribution). The introduction of PC71BM is also responsible for an increased IQE (Fig. 3b): an approximate value of 0.88 was found throughout the whole measured range for the binary PBDBT:PC71BM fullerene cell, while non-fullerene cells did not show IQE values higher than ∼0.80 on average. The IQE numbers nicely match those estimated in the optical simulations (Fig. S7, ESI†). We ascribe such lower IQE values to the lower exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiencies of the non-fullerene system. The photoluminescence quenching (Fig. S8†) and electron-only device experiments confirm such a trend in the IQE. The electron mobility extracted from the dark J–V curves of Fig. 3c using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method is estimated to be 1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the non-fullerene electron-only device. This value is 4 times smaller than that of the 50% PC71BM blend (7.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and one order of magnitude lower than the one for the 100% PC71BM blend (2.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The details of the mobility calculation are shown in the Experimental section.

(b) IQE comparison in PBDBT:ITIC:PC71BM ternary ITO cells with various PC71BM ratios. IQE spectra here were obtained following the reported method.49,50 IQE(λ) = measured EQE(λ)/1 − R(λ) − A(λ), where R(λ) is the reflectance of the device and A(λ) is the parasitic absorption of non-active layers in the devices calculated by the transfer matrix method.

The figures of merit (FOM) of the PBDBT:ITIC:PC71BM ternary cell are presented in Fig. S9 and Table S2,† as a function of the PC71BM content. They clearly show how PC71BM addition up to a certain percentage induces a boost in each FOM. Note that such ternary solar cells are likely to work in a parallel-like configuration consisting of a PBDBT:ITIC and a PBDBT:PC71BM single bulk-heterojunction sub-cell. Electrons generated at the ITIC or PC71BM acceptors mainly travel through their corresponding molecule-linked channels towards the cathode for collection.51,52 PC71BM here seems to provide a more efficient electron-transport channel than ITIC in the ternary blend systems, leading to a higher electron mobility and a more balanced hole/electron mobility ratio (see Fig. S10, ESI†). As a result, higher FF values in the solar cells incorporating PC71BM are expected. An interesting observation in this system is that the Voc tends to values close to those of the non-fullerene cell, as seen in Fig. 3d. This suggests that after the exciton splitting, the electron quasi-Fermi level is more likely to be determined by the LUMO energy level of the ITIC acceptor, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3d.
Then, we fabricate flexible solar cells under the same experimental conditions as those of the optimal glass-TRTC based cells, and the fabrication details are shown in the Experimental section. In contrast to the silver metal nanowire or metal grid based flexible electrodes, the layered TRTC electrode does not introduce any alteration in the critical nano-morphology of the same active layer, which may have a detrimental effect on the device FF and Voc.38,41Fig. 4a shows that by integrating the 50% PC71BM blend based PET-TRTC cell with an ARC layer, an ∼7% EQE increase can be reached, yet its performance is slightly lower than that of its SK10 glass-based counterpart, mainly due to the PET parasitic absorption and a slight difference in the refractive index. A 10.6% best efficiency for a flexible cell was measured under AM 1.5G 1-sun illumination, as shown in Fig. 4b. It is worth noting that almost no loss in FF was observed for these flexible cells, provided the measured sheet resistance of 8.8 Ω sq−1 for the flexible TRTC electrode is similar to the 8.4 Ω sq−1 for the glass substrates. Flexible devices incorporating the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer were also fabricated and showed a PCE as high as 10.5% (Fig. S11, ESI†), this being an ∼12% improvement compared to the average performance of their glass/ITO counterparts.10 Bending tests were performed on the 50% PC71BM flexible cells, as shown in Fig. 4c. No degradation was observed in the cell performance even after 500 bending cycles at a curvature radius of ∼5.9 mm (see Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†), demonstrating an excellent mechanical flexibility. This should be attributed to the non-brittle nature of the Ag metallic cavity layer (Fig. 4c).

Fullerene derivatives are known to have a tendency to aggregate in bulk-heterojunction blends under thermal treatment, causing a deterioration in the active layer nanomorphology and in the overall cell performance, in particular, in the presence of DIO or other small molecule additives.53,54 Obtaining an intrinsically stable blend nanomorphology is a prerequisite for realizing long lifetime solar cells. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the use of non-fullerene alternatives eliminates light-induced burn-in and improves the cell stability.55 This is, however, not the only way to improve stability which can also be achieved by introducing a robust crystalline ordering in the fullerene phase. Indeed, very long lifetime solar cells using PTB7-Th:PC71BM have recently been reported, too.56 This indicates that PC71BM is still a good electron acceptor candidate for stable polymer solar cells. Thus, we examined the thermal stability of the non-fullerene and 50% PC71BM ternary blend based ITO cells. The devices were first encapsulated in a N2-filled glovebox, and then they were thermally annealed at 85 °C in air, according to the ISOS-D-1 protocol.57 Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5, both types of cells exhibited a similar degradation behaviour with aging. A fast burn-in was observed during the first 5 hours of thermal aging and, after this initial ∼20% relative loss, a steady plateau was reached with no major further losses. In other words, the PC71BM addition did not cause any significant fullerene aggregation or nano-morphology change of the ternary blend films under thermal aging.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a TRTC based transparent electrode for improved efficiency in ITIC-based non-fullerene flexible solar cells. Indeed, by adjusting both dielectric and metallic cavity layers, enhanced PCE in any flexible devices (both fullerene and non-fullerene) can always be achieved using photoactive materials with a suitable extinction coefficient. A significant enhancement in light absorption was seen for the non-fullerene TRTC cells, when half of the ITIC acceptor in the active blend was replaced by PC71BM. In that configuration, a highly efficient cell was obtained, with open-circuit voltage values very close to 0.9 V. On the other hand, the PC71BM addition did not induce any significant change in the device thermal stability. In addition, an almost negligible performance loss was observed compared to their glass counterparts when the TRTC device was integrated on the flexible PET substrates. Therefore, the TRTC concept not only enables enhanced photovoltaic performance than glass/ITO analogues, but also good mechanical flexibility. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge we achieved the highest PCE ever reported for flexible organic solar cells combined with an excellent bending stability. We believe that the approach presented may pave an ideal path to fabricate high-performance, large-area flexible solar panels for commercial applications.
Experimental section
Materials and preparation
PBDBT and ITIC from 1-Material and PC71BM (purity > 99%) from American Dye Source were used as received. Patterned ITO glass substrates (∼15 Ω sq−1, 135 nm) were purchased from Lumtec. SK10 glass and 0.125 mm thick PET flexible substrates were purchased from UQG Optics and Goodfellow, respectively. 2-inch ZnO, TiO2 and Ag targets were purchased from Kurt J. Lesker Company. Solutions of PBDBT:ITIC:PC71BM blends with different PC71BM contents at a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 were prepared in chlorobenzene (CB) and stirred at 50 °C overnight in a N2-filled glovebox. The DIO additive (0.5% vol for the non-fullerene blend and 1% vol for the other blends) was added into the blends one hour prior to spin-coating. Details of the preparation of the sol–gel ZnO precursor can be found elsewhere.58
Solar cell fabrication
The TRTC electrodes were sputtered on pre-cleaned SK10 glass or PET substrates according to our previous report.42 Note that the PET substrates were pre-attached onto glass substrates using two-sided tape until the fabrication of cells was completed. Solar cells were fabricated by spin-casting a 0.15 M ZnO sol–gel precursor on the pre-cleaned ITO glass and SK10 glass or PET-based TRTC substrates. After annealing at 150 °C in air for 10 min, an ∼10 nm electron buffer layer was formed. The prepared samples were then transferred into a N2-filled glovebox for spin-casting the photoactive layer with a controlled thickness of ∼95 nm. The resulting active films were firstly dried under high vacuum (<5 × 10−6 mbar) for one hour, and then thermally annealed in a glovebox for 10 minutes. The annealing temperatures for the non-fullerene and PC71BM containing blend films are 140 °C and 80 °C, respectively. Finally, MoO3 (5 nm, 0.5 Å s−1) and Ag (100 nm, 1 Å s−1) back electrodes were sequentially deposited on the active layer through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation (<5 × 10−6 mbar). The device area, defined by the overlap between transparent electrodes and thick Ag electrodes, was 0.08 cm2. For TRTC cells, an additional 100 nm MgF2 ARC layer was thermally evaporated on the other side of substrates at a rate of 0.5–1 Å s−1.
Characterization
The J–V curves of all devices were measured with a Keithley 2420 sourcemeter under 1 sun, AM 1.5G illumination from a solar simulator (ABET Sol3A, 1000 W m−2). The illumination intensity of the light source (Xenon lamp, 300 W, USHIO) was calibrated using a Hamamatsu silicon photodiode (with a KG-5 filter, area = 0.1296 cm2) certified by ISE Fraunhofer. Spectrally resolved EQEs were measured using a bench top QEX10 measurement system supplied by PV Measurements Inc. Optical transmission measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer. For the reflectance measurements, a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere set-up was used. The sheet resistance of the TRTC substrates was determined by a four-point method with a cascade Microtech 44/7 S 2749 probe station connected to a Keithley 2001 multimeter. Single-carrier mobility measurements were performed on electron-only devices of ITO (135 nm)/SG-ZnO (20 nm)/blends (95 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) and hole-only devices of ITO (135 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/blends (95 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The carrier mobilities were extracted by fitting their dark J–V characteristics using the SCLC Mott–Gurney model.56,59
Bending and thermal stability tests
Device bending tests were performed on PET-TRTC electrodes and flexible cells in air following a similar literature reported method.60 A bending radius of around 5.9 mm was determined by bending PET substrates on a 6 mm radius stainless steel post (see Fig. S12, ESI†). All the sheet resistance and PV parameters were recorded when the PET substrates recovered to the horizontal position. For thermal stability tests, the devices were sealed with glass and UV curable epoxy (DELO KATIOBND LP655) in a N2-filled glovebox before testing in air. The encapsulated cells were placed on a hotplate at a controlled temperature of 85 ± 1 °C and J–V characteristics were recorded when the cells cooled down to room temperature.
