    , Accepted 25th October 2022First published on 4th November 2022AbstractMorphology control of all-small-molecule (ASM) organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucial for improving their efficiencies. However, choosing an appropriate strategy for these systems is highly challenging. In this study, carbon disulfide (CS2) is demonstrated to tune morphology and synchronously enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BTR-Cl/Y6 based ASM-OSCs. The improved PCEs are mainly due to the with better phase separation resulting in reduced recombination, prolonged carrier lifetime, and facilitated charge extraction. Thus, compared with TA (thermal annealing) based devices, the CS2-treatment based devices exhibit better performance with FF enhanced from 65.8% to 74.2% and JSC increased from 24.23 to 24.78 mA cm−2, leading to a higher PCE of 15.5%. These findings demonstrate that the solvent (CS2) treatment can be a simple and effective way to deliver highly efficient OSCs.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a promising competitor for the next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their low carbon footprint, lightweightness, semitransparency and so on.1–7 In particular, all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs have attracted tremendous industrial interest due to their well-defined chemical structures, high purity, and excellent reproducibility.8–12 However, defects in the active layer (AL) morphology are a big challenge in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ASM-OSCs. Thus, addressing the technique to optimize the AL morphology and enhance PCEs is important to facilitate the commercialization of ASM-OSCs.
Thus far, the research community has dedicated great efforts to control morphology to further evaluate PCEs.4,13,14 Sun et al., in 2021, demonstrated that a volatile additive, namely dihalogenated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC-FI), can enhance the PCE of BTR-Cl/N3 based ASM-OSCs from 13.36% to 14.43%.15 In 2020, our group induced PC71BM material as a ternary component into the BTR-Cl/Y6 blend, leading to significantly enhanced PCEs with an increase in FF from 69.63% to 77.11%.16 The above results indicate that the solid additive and ternary strategies are efficient methods for obtaining high ASM-OSC photovoltaic performance. Besides, post-processing is turning out to be a more simple and effective way for improving PCEs. In 2019, our group designed a concentration-induced morphology manipulation strategy to fine-tune the morphology of BTR-Cl/Y6 based ASM-OSCs, resulting in significantly enhanced PCEs.17 Ge et al. explored different post-treatment methods including TA and solvent (CF, CS2, and THF) annealing to control morphology, and ultimately, a 15.39% efficiency for BT-2F/N3 based devices was realized with CS2 solvent annealing.18 The CS2-annealing blend film with better J-aggregation and molecular interconnection significantly suppresses recombination and trap states, simultaneously leading to enhanced PCEs. It follows that the post-treatment strategy is a simple and efficient way for evaluating PCEs.
Herein, the CS2 solvent annealing method is demonstrated to optimize the AL morphology and synchronously promote the PCEs of BTR-Cl/Y6 systems. The CS2 processed devices yield higher efficiency (15.5%) with faster charge extraction (0.78 μs vs.0.97 μs), longer carrier lifetime (1.07 μs vs.1.29 μs), additionally much lower recombination, large charge collection (82.7% vs.80.8%), and exciton dissociation (97.9% vs.95.4%) than those of TA processed devices. Besides, the CS2-treatment blend presents stronger crystallinity and better phase separation, which benefits charge transfer. Thus, our proposed CS2 solvent annealing strategy can enhance the PCEs of ASM-OSCs and further promote commercial applications.
Results and discussion
The molecular structures of the donor (BTR-Cl) and non-fullerene acceptors (Y6) used in this study are presented in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b depicts the energy level diagram of the materials used in the active layer, in which BTR-Cl possesses the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −3.70 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.42 eV, which matches well with those of acceptor Y6 (LUMO: −4.10 eV, HOMO: −5.65 eV).19,20 The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of BTR-Cl and Y6 neat films are shown in Fig. 1c. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the film absorption is located in the 450–700 nm range for BTR-Cl, which is complementary with the Y6 acceptor in the absorption range from 680 nm to 900 nm.

To explore TA and CS2-treatment impact for morphology control, we employ normal architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, 4083)/active layer/1,10-phenanthroline, 3-[6-(diphenylphosphinyl)-2-naphthalenyl]-; [6-(1,10-phenanthrolin-3-yl)-2-naphthyl]diphenylphosphine oxide; 3-[6-(diphenylphosphinyl)-2-naphthalenyl]-1,10-phenanthroline (Phen-NaDPO)/Ag is fabricated, experimental protocols in detail are given in the ESI.†Fig. 1d presents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of BTR-Cl/Y6 with TA and CS2 treatments. The TA processed device depicts a PCE of 13.8% with a VOC of 863.4 mV, a JSC of 24.23 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.8%. The CS2 treatment in blends can efficiently enhance the photovoltaic performance of the devices. The PCEs of CS2 processed devices (15.5%) with synergistically enhanced JSC of 24.78 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.2% (Table 1). It is worth noting that the device with CS2 treatment can effectively enhance JSC and FF, resulting in a better-performing BTR-Cl/Y6 system compared to TA-treatment devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 1e. At the wavelength range from 480 nm to 850 nm, the EQE response of the devices with the CS2 treatment is stronger than that of the TA-treatment devices, resulting in higher JSC. The integrated JSC values of the TA and CS2-treatment devices are 23.82 and 24.24 mA cm−2, respectively, well in line with the JSC values tested from the solar simulator (within a 3% error, Table 1).

The higher JSC and FF values for CS2 processed devices respond to more efficient charge collection and exciton dissociation. To confirm this hypothesis, we tracked the behavior of photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) for both devices. Jph ∝ Veff was plotted to study charge generation and extraction properties (Fig. 2a), and the measurement protocols are given in detail in the ESI.†21 Both TA and CS2-treatment devices show non-field-dependent behavior within the Veff range of 0–2 V, suggesting that gross photogenerated excitons are assumed to be dissociated into free charge carriers and then collected by electrodes.22 As demonstrated in Fig. 2a, the CS2 processed devices present a ηdiss of 97.9% and a ηcoll of 82.7%, higher than those of the TA processed devices (ηdiss of 95.4% and ηcoll of 80.8%), indicating that the CS2 treatment can effectively promote exciton dissociation and charge collection.23

In addition to charge generation and extraction properties, the recombination mechanism plays an irreplaceable role in improving JSC and FF. To illustrate the carrier dynamics process in devices, light-intensity dependence and transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) measurements24 are adopted to unveil the impact of the CS2 treatment. As demonstrated in Fig. 2b, a value of 0.994 was obtained for the CS2 processed device, which is much higher than that of the TA processed device (0.979), inferring negligible bimolecular recombination losses for the CS2-treatment BTR-Cl/Y6 system. Moreover, the existence of trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination can be inferred from Fig. 2c. The fitted data shown in Fig. 2d present n values of 1.13 and 1.02 for TA and CS2-treatment devices, respectively, indicating that trap-assisted recombination was efficiently suppressed in CS2 processed devices. These results reveal that the CS2 treatment can notably suppress the density of trap-assisted recombination centers, which contribute to enhanced PCEs.
The charge recombination dynamics and extraction across active layers could be quantitatively analyzed by TPV and TPC characterizations in devices. As depicted in TPC (Fig. 2e), the charge extraction time of TA and CS2-treatment devices are 0.97 μs and 0.78 μs, respectively, indicating that the CS2 processed devices demonstrate faster charge extraction. Further, the carrier lifetimes (ι) under open-circuit conditions (Fig. 2e) are extracted from the TPV decay dynamics using mono-exponential fits. The device with the CS2 treatment exhibits a ι value of 1.29 μs, longer than that exhibited by the TA counterpart (1.07 μs), in line with the trap-assisted recombination results. In addition, mobilities are also crucial factors in explaining the CS2 processed devices, having better FFs compared with the TA processed devices. The electron and hole mobility are derived from the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, and the experimental detail is presented in the ESI.† As depicted in Fig. 2f, the CS2 processed devices have higher hole and electron mobilities (6.99 and 9.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to those of the TA processed devices (4.05 and 7.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), specifically indicating more balanced electron and hole mobilities for CS2 processed devices.
The donor/acceptor phase separation in the BHJ active layer is investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As displayed in AFM height images, the TA-treatment blend demonstrates a root mean square roughness (Rq) value of 1.25 nm (Fig. 3a), lower than that of the CS2-treatment blend (Fig. 3d, Rq = 1.81 nm), implying that the solvent CS2 treatment can enhance molecular aggregation and crystallinity.16 Furthermore, as demonstrated in Fig. 3b and e, the CS2-treatment blend exhibits clearer phase separation compared to the TA-treatment blend, which can be beneficial for charge transport. As depicted in the TEM images (Fig. 3c and f), the CS2-treatment blend presents clearer phase-separation, which is in line with the phase images by AFM measurements (Fig. 3b and e).

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a solvent (CS2) annealing strategy to tune morphology and simultaneously enhance the PCEs of BTR-Cl/Y6 based ASM-OSCs. The CS2 treatment can effectively improve JSC and FF of the devices resulting in the enhancement of PCEs from 13.8% to 15.5%. We found that the improved PCEs are mainly from the finely controlled phase separation with improved exciton dissociation, reduced recombination, faster charge transfer, and higher mobility, leading to enhanced JSC and FF. In the light of this study, we conclude that the solvent (CS2) annealing technique can tune the morphology of the system and further improve the efficiency of ASM-OSCs.
