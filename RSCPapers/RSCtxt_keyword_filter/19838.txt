    , Accepted 13th March 2020First published on 14th March 2020AbstractSolar driven conversion of CO2 into carbonaceous chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emission and simultaneously store renewable energy. The rational construction of heterostructured cocatalysts represents an efficient method to improve the photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction. In this work, with Pd@Au core–shell nanostructures with tunable Au thickness as model cocatalysts, we demonstrate the synergism of surface strain and interfacial polarization for enhanced photoreduction of CO2 to CO. According to our experimental analysis and theoretical simulation, resulting from the mismatch in lattice parameters between the Pd core and the Au shell, compressive strain on the Au surface elevates the d-band center and improves the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH. Meanwhile, charge polarization, driven by the difference in electronegativity between Pd and Au, accelerates the interfacial charge transfer and increases the electron density on the Au surface. It is found that both effects are dependent on the thickness of the Au shell. As a result, a three-atom-thick Au shell dramatically boosts the overall efficiency in CO2-to-CO conversion with an impressive activity of 166.3 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and selectivity of 90.6%. This study can be viewed as a means of designing photocatalysts via the simultaneous control of surface catalytic reactivity and interfacial charge transfer in cocatalysts.
Introduction
Solar driven conversion of CO2 to renewable chemicals is a green and sustainable approach to simultaneously overcome global warming and reduce fossil fuel consumption.1–4 Since the pioneering work of Inoue et al., numerous efforts have been directed to the development of semiconductor photocatalysts in the conversion of CO2 with H2O to value-added products.5–11 In particular, TiO2 is widely used as a photocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction due to its high stability, nontoxic nature and abundant availability.12,13 Unfortunately, pristine semiconductors often suffer from serious electron–hole recombination or poor surface reactivity.14,15 To address these great challenges, the loading of cocatalysts has been proven to be an efficient strategy which not only improves the electron–hole separation efficiency, but also provides highly active sites on the surface to steer the reactivity.16–21 So far, various metal,22,23 oxide,24 sulfide,25 hydride26 and carbide27 cocatalysts have been developed to increase the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency. However, owing to the uncontrollable electron trapping and surface reactivity of cocatalysts, the product selectivity is frequently restricted by multiple reaction routes (e.g. CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O, CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− → CH3OH + H2O and CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O) and side reactions (2H+ + 2e− → H2), while the catalytic activity still needs to be improved to meet the needs of practical application. Considering the two key roles of cocatalysts, simultaneous optimization of interfacial charge transfer and surface catalytic reactivity, represents a promising route to further improve the photocatalytic conversion efficiency, which cannot be achieved without the fundamental understanding of the correlation between structure and property.28 Previous research studies have proved that the rational surface and interface design of multi-component cocatalysts play a vital role in maximizing the synergistic effect of different components and boosting the photocatalytic performance.24,29,30
Surface strain, generally generated by lattice mismatch between different components, is a powerful factor to regulate the catalytic property of heterogeneous catalysts by modifying the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates.31–33 Recently, there have been a few reports where strain was explicitly used to steer the activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.34,35 Inspired by the crucial effects of surface strain on the performance of electrocatalysts, we reasonably deduced that surface strain on photocatalysts would be utilized as an important knob to tune solar driven CO2 conversion efficiency.36 On the other hand, interfacial polarization, enabled by materials of differing work functions/electronegativities, is a driving force to promote interfacial charge transfer and enable electron accumulation on catalyst surfaces.37,38 The modification of surface charge states plays an additional role in tuning the catalytic activity.39 Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, a clear and systematic understanding of strain effect and interfacial polarization in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is still lacking at present, which restricts their use as tools to optimize the performance of photocatalysts. Given that the parameter adjustment of light-harvesting semiconductors inevitably alters light absorption, cocatalysts only participating in the charge transfer and surface reaction processes offer an ideal platform for the study of strain and polarization effects in photocatalysis.
Of all heterostructures, the core–shell structure is an ideal configuration that induces the largest lattice strain, provides the maximal interfacial area for charge polarization and maximizes the surface areas for catalytic reactions.37,38,40,41 Herein, we design an ideal platform based on Pd@Au core–shell cocatalysts to explore the synergistic effect of surface strain and interfacial polarization for enhanced photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction. Enabled by the different lattice constants and electronegativities between Pd and Au, a compressive strain on the Au surface shifts up the d-band center and strengthens the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH, while charge polarization occurring at the interface between Pd and Au facilitates charge separation and increases electron density at the Au surface. Moreover, both the strain and polarization effects are strengthened with the shrinkage of Au thickness. As a proof of concept, Pd@Au core–shell cocatalysts with an ultrathin Au overlayer remarkably improve the CO2-to-CO conversion efficiency.
Experimental
Synthesis of TiO2–Pd@Au
In a typical synthesis of TiO2–Pd@Au, a solution was first prepared in a vial as follows: 9.625 mL aqueous solution containing 0.32 g cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), 10 μL aqueous solution of NaBr (0.01 M), 80 μL aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (10 mM) and 90 μL aqueous solution of ascorbic acid (AA, 0.04 M) was mixed at 30 °C to obtain a colorless solution. Subsequently, a certain amount of TiO2–Pd was added into the mixed solution. The solution in the vial was left undisturbed for 15 min to complete the Au growth. The resultant product was separated by centrifugation, washed with water four times, and dried at 45 °C in a vacuum. TiO2–Pd@Au samples with different Au shells were obtained through altering the amounts of TiO2–Pd used, including 4.5, 1.5 and 0.5 mg for the synthesis of TiO2–Pd@Au-1, TiO2–Pd@Au-2 and TiO2–Pd@Au-3, respectively.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
3.0 mg as-synthesized products were dispersed in a mixture of 10 μL ethanol and 10 μL Nafion, which were then uniformly spin-dropped onto at a 1 cm × 1 cm indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass by using a spin coater (SC-1B, China). Subsequently, the ITO-coated glasses were heated at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h. The photocurrents were measured on a CHI 760E electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China) under ambient conditions under irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300/300UV, Beijing Perflectlight, China). UV light (320 < λ < 420 nm) was used as the illumination source, which was realized in the presence of a short-wave-pass 420 nm cutoff filter. The power density of the light was measured to be 2.7 mW cm−2. A three-electrode cell was used to perform the electrochemical measurements. The working electrode was the ITO-coated glass. A Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt foil were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The three electrodes were inserted in a quartz cell filled with 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The photoresponse of the prepared photoelectrodes (i.e., I–t) was obtained by measuring the photocurrent density under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles: 60 s) at a bias potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 400 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the 10−1 to 105 Hz frequency range with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV at an applied potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Transient open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was measured for a total of 800 s under UV light irradiation, and the light was switched on and off after 100 and 400 s from the start, respectively. The average lifetime of the photogenerated carriers (τn) was obtained according to the OCVD using the following equation:  where KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (in Kelvin), and q is the unsigned charge of an electron.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction measurements
To investigate the photocatalytic activities of TiO2-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, 15 mg of photocatalysts were dispersed on a flat glass plate at the bottom of a photocatalytic reactor. And 5 mL H2O was added and it surrounded the plate. Prior to the test, the reactor loaded with the catalyst was first purged with high purity CO2 (0.15 MPa) for 20 min. Then the light-irradiation experiment was performed by using a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300/300UV, Beijing Perflectlight) with UV light as the illumination source. The power density of UV light (320 < λ < 420 nm) was measured to be 2.7 mW cm−2. The photocatalytic reaction was performed under irradiation of UV light with stirring at 300 rpm for 4 h. After completion of the reaction, the gaseous mixture was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Ar carrier, Shimadzu) with Ar as the carrier gas. The amount of H2 and O2 was determined using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The amount of CH4 was measured by using a flame ionization detector (FID). The amount of CO was converted to CH4 by using a methanation reactor and then analyzed by using the FID. After the reaction was completed, the sample was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min. During the stability test, the photocatalyst with the best performance was collected after each run and then reused for the photoreduction of CO2. The photocatalyst was heat treated at 160 °C for 3 h after the runs before reusing. Isotope-labeling experiments were performed using 13CO2 instead of 12CO2, and the products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (7890B/5977A, Agilent). Visible photocatalytic performance was measured under the same experimental conditions except that both long-wave-pass 420 nm and short-wave-pass 780 nm cutoff filters (420 < λ < 780 nm) were used instead of a short-wave-pass 420 nm (λ < 420 nm) cutoff filter.
Results and discussion
Sample synthesis and characterization
In the proof-of-concept design, TiO2 nanosheets were used as a model semiconductor and were synthesized according to a literature procedure (Fig. S1†).42 As revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, TiO2 nanosheets with an edge length of approximately 200 nm and thickness below 10 nm are monocrystalline structures dominated with the (001) facet (Fig. S2†). The large flat surface of the nanosheets facilitates the loading of cocatalysts, while the low thickness shortens the electron migration distance to cocatalysts. Secondly, Pd nanocrystals were in situ grown on TiO2 by reducing K2PdCl4 with ascorbic acid (AA) (Fig. S1†). With KBr as a facet-selective capping agent, cubic Pd nanocrystals with an average edge length of 10.6 nm are uniformly distributed on the flat surface of TiO2 (Fig. S3a and b†).43 As revealed by the TEM image with a standing-up TiO2 nanosheet, Pd nanocubes are integrated with TiO2 nanosheets through facet-to-facet contact (Fig. S3c†). As a result, TiO2–Pd interfaces with a large area guarantee the stability of the supported structure and the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer. The HRTEM image of Pd shows continuous lattice fringes with a spacing of 1.95 Å, implying monocrystalline nanostructures enclosed by six (100) facets (Fig. S3d†).
In the third step, Pd nanocubes were coated by a Au shell with tunable thickness via the reduction of HAuCl4 with AA (Fig. S1†).29 Given the larger lattice mismatch between Pd and TiO2, Au selectively wets the Pd surface through an epitaxial growth mode to minimize the interfacial energy.44Fig. 1a and b show TEM images of the as-obtained TiO2–Pd@Au-1 with a smaller Au/TiO2–Pd ratio. It can be clearly seen that Pd@Au core–shell nanostructures dispersed on TiO2 nanosheets inherit the cubic profile shape with truncated corners. In particular, resulting from the higher electron density of Au than that of Pd, there is an image contrast between the inner grey black Pd and the exterior deep black Au. The Au shell is determined to be around 0.6 nm in thickness, which is also a piece of single crystal enclosed by (100) facets as revealed by the HRTEM image, forming perfect Pd(100)–Au(100) interfaces with the existing Pd core (Fig. 1c). The number of Au atomic layers is three and the interatomic spacing of the Au–Au pairs is 1.96 Å, 4.35% smaller than that of pure Au (2.05 Å), suggesting that compressive residual strains are developed in the 0.6 nm thick Au shell. This argument is further supported by the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images taken from an individual core–shell nanocube (Fig. 2a and b). The elemental distributions in the as-obtained sample can be further confirmed by the scanning TEM (STEM) image together with the corresponding energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping profiles (Fig. 2c)

With the further increase of the Au/TiO2–Pd ratio, TiO2–Pd@Au samples with higher thicknesses of the Au shell were obtained. As shown in Fig. 1d, e, g and h, the shell thickness of deep black Au increases to around 3 nm for TiO2–Pd@Au-2 and then to 7 nm for TiO2–Pd@Au-3 on average. As the shell thickness increases, the corners of the Pd@Au core–shell nanocrystals become more round and the morphology tends to be more irregular. According to HRTEM images (Fig. 1f and i), the planes of the Au shell also share the same orientation with Pd cores, contributing to the construction of the Pd@Au core–shell nanostructure with Au(100) surfaces and Pd(100)–Au(100) interfaces. The number of Au atomic layers is estimated to be 15 and 34, and the lattice spacings in the Au shell are measured to be 2.01 and 2.05 Å for the TiO2–Pd@Au-2 and TiO2–Pd@Au-3, respectively. The above results imply that the compressive strains along the directions parallel to the exposed (100) planes of Pd nanocrystals gradually reduce as the Au thickness increases. For TiO2–Pd@Au-2, the 3 nm Au shell is also under compression with a 1.93% lattice strain. When the shell thickness becomes greater than 7 nm, the compressive strain on the Au shell reduces to the level of that of bulk Au. The morphological evolution of Pd@Au nanocrystals along with the increase of Au thickness could also be clearly seen from STEM images and EDS mapping profiles (Fig. 2d and e). It should be noted that as one plane of Pd nanocubes in the TiO2–Pd@Au samples is in intimate contact with TiO2, only five planes are covered by Au to form stack structures, which can be verified by the TEM images with standing-up TiO2 nanosheets (inset of Fig. 1b, e and h). Additionally, with the deposition of single crystalline Au nanocubes enclosed by (100) planes on TiO2 nanosheets via facet-to-facet contact, TiO2–Au is also fabricated as a reference sample (Fig. S4†).
The structures of the as-obtained samples were further characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns. As shown in Fig. 3a, in addition to the peaks of the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272), all other peaks can be ascribed to face-centered cubic (fcc) Pd (JCPDS no. 65-2867) and Au (JCPDS no. 65-2870). In comparison with the pattern of TiO2–Pd, no additional Au peak can be observed in TiO2–Pd@Au-1, except a slight leftward broadening of Pd peaks. These results indicate that the lattice parameter of ultrathin Au layers is similar to that of Pd, further suggesting the compression of the Au lattice.33 As the Au thickness increases, characteristic peaks of Au appear in TiO2–Pd@Au-2 and TiO2–Pd@Au-3, the intensities of which gradually increase while the positions shift to lower angles, implying the increased lattice spacing of the Au shell. The positions of Au peaks in TiO2–Pd@Au-3 are close to those in TiO2–Au, again proving that Au is nearly free from residual strain.

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were then used to collect surface composition information on the samples. Survey spectra further confirm the presence of Pd and Au, along with Ti and O in the TiO2–Pd@Au samples (Fig. S5†). In the spectrum of Pd 3d and Au 4f, doublets with binding energies of 335.2 eV (Pd 3d5/2), 340.6 eV (Pd 3d3/2), 83.3 eV (Au 4f7/2) and 87.0 eV (Au 4f5/2) are in agreement with zero-valence Pd and Au, respectively, while a small number of Pd(II) states are also detected and shown as doublets (336.6/342.0 eV), which are typical features for solution-synthesized Pd (Fig. 3b and c). It is worth noting that the Au 4d5/2 signal at 335.4 eV is overlapped with the Pd 3d spectrum (Fig. 3b and Fig. S5†). Owing to the limited detection depth of XPS, with the increase of Au shell thickness, Au 4d and Au 4f signals become stronger while the Pd 3d signal gradually weakens. More importantly, Pd 3d and Au 4d/Au 4f peaks shift to higher and lower binding energies compared with those of TiO2–Pd and TiO2–Au, respectively, suggesting electron-deficient Pd and electron-rich Au.29,45 What's more, more obvious shifts occur when the Au shell of TiO2–Pd@Au is thinner, suggesting more significant charge re-distribution between them.
Photocatalytic performance analysis
Upon acquiring structure and composition information on the samples, we are in a position to investigate their photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction. The TiO2 based samples were used as photocatalysts in a mixed vapor of CO2 and H2O under UV light irradiation (320 < λ < 420 nm), and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography. As shown in Fig. 4a, it can be clearly seen that the loading of metal significantly improves the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Moreover, the yields of the reduction products show a strong correlation with the type of metal, which should be related to the functions of cocatalysts. The reduction product over TiO2–Pd is dominantly H2 with trace amounts of CO and CH4. With the further deposition of Au on Pd, the side reaction of H2 evolution is effectively inhibited, while CO yield is remarkably improved. According to previous reports,35,46 water splitting prefers to occur on the Pd(100) plane, while Au exhibits high activity and selectivity in the conversion of CO2 to CO due to the weak Au–CO binding energy. More importantly, the average CO production rates are greatly dependent on the thickness of the Au shell. With the thinnest Au shell, TiO2–Pd@Au-1 achieves an impressive value of 166.3 μmol gcat−1 h−1, 97.8- and 75.6-fold higher than those of TiO2 and TiO2–Pd, respectively (Table 1). With the increase of Au thickness, the CO evolution rate falls to 38.4 and 14.8 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for TiO2–Pd@Au-2 and TiO2–Pd@Au-3, respectively, superior to that of TiO2–Au. For TiO2–Pd@Au samples, the selectivity for CO production follows the same order as the CO evolution rate (Fig. 4a), which is calculated according to the average evolution rates of reduction products as well as the electrons required to generate products using the following equation:CO selectivity (%) = [2ν(CO)]/[2ν(H2) + 2ν(CO) + 8ν(CH4)] × 100%

TiO2–Pd@Au-1 exhibits the highest selectivity of 90.6%, which drops to 68.9% for TiO2–Pd@Au-2, and then to 53.8% for TiO2–Pd@Au-3, almost close to that of TiO2–Au (52.9%) (Table 1).
The photocatalytic performance of TiO2–Pd@Au-1 also surpasses those of reported state-of-the-art Au cocatalysts supported by TiO2 measured under comparative conditions (Table S1†).29,47–51 Moreover, after five 4 h cycling tests, TiO2–Pd@Au-1 still maintain efficient activity and selectivity in CO evolution (Fig. 4b). As revealed by TEM, XRD and XPS of TiO2–Pd@Au-1 after long-term testing, the excellent durability can be ascribed to the well-maintained structure and composition of the catalyst (Fig. S6 and S7†). It should be noted that O2 as an oxidation product was also detected in the photocatalytic reaction, suggesting the occurrence of H2O + 2h+ → 1/2O2 + 2H+ (Table 1). Moreover, no low-carbon product was detected in the control experiments without photocatalysts, in the dark or in an Ar atmosphere, confirming that CO actually originated from the photoreduction of CO2 rather than adsorbed carbon species (Table 1). To further confirm this, the 13C isotope labeling experiment was performed over TiO2–Pd@Au-1 using 13CO2 as a substrate to explore the source of carbon. As shown in Fig. 4c, the strong signal at m/z = 29 can be assigned to 13CO, suggesting that the carbon source of CO is derived from used CO2. Besides CO, the CH4 evolution rate of TiO2–Pd@Au gradually increases with the reduction of Au thickness, while the H2 production rate gradually decreases, suggesting that it is possible to totally suppress H2 evolution when the Au shell has further shrunk to a monolayer (Table 1).9,52,53 When the photocatalytic performance of TiO2–Pd@Au samples was measured under visible light irradiation (420 < λ < 780 nm), no obvious product was detected for TiO2–Pd@Au-1, while TiO2–Pd@Au-2 and TiO2–Pd@Au-3 produced trace amounts of H2 and CO. The main reason is that the plasmonic absorption of the three-atom-thick Au shell in TiO2–Pd@Au-1 is too weak to generate hot electrons and inject them into the conduction band of TiO2 for a surface reduction reaction through Au → TiO2 and Au → Pd → TiO2 routes.54,55
Photocatalytic mechanism study
It is natural to ask what factor is responsible for the Au thickness-dependent photocatalytic performance. To decode the underlying mechanism, charge kinetics is first taken into consideration, which plays a key role in the photocatalytic processes.56,57 As the driving force of photocatalysis, light harvesting behaviors of the samples were evaluated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. As shown in Fig. 5a, the loading of metal does not alter the light absorption of TiO2 in the UV region. The varied visible absorption behaviors are mainly attributed to the plasmonic band of Au as well as the interband absorption of nonplasmonic Pd.43,58,59 Given the comparable light absorption in the UV region, the photocurrent response offers an informative evaluation of the electron–hole separation efficiency. As indicated by the photocurrent versus time (I–t) curves in Fig. 5b, the addition of metal significantly boosts the photocurrent density of TiO2, confirming the role of cocatalysts in preventing charge recombination in TiO2. Moreover, various metal cocatalysts show obviously different photocurrent enhancements, which turned out to be in the order: TiO2–Pd < TiO2–Au < TiO2–Pd@Au-3 < TiO2–Pd@Au-2 < TiO2–Pd@Au-1, demonstrating that the low thickness of the Au shell is beneficial to charge separation. This statement is also confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra (Fig. 5c and d). Along with the decrease of Au thickness, the reducing arc radii of Nyquist plots indicate lower interfacial charge transfer resistances, while the increasing PL quenching degrees of TiO2 suggest more effective prevention of charge recombination through radiative pathways. The augmented charge separation inevitably contributes to prolonged carrier lifetimes. As indicated by transient open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements (Fig. 5e), the average lifetimes of the photogenerated carriers (τn) were estimated according to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) decay in the dark as the electron–hole recombination gradually occurred when the light illumination was turned off. As expected, the average lifetime of the carriers follows the same sequence as photocurrent, which is in good agreement with the photocatalytic results in CO2-to-CO conversion (Fig. 5f).

The next question that arose was what in-depth mechanism results in Au thickness dependent charge kinetics behavior. Considering the encapsulation of the cubic Pd core with the TiO2 supporter and the Au shell in the TiO2–Pd@Au samples, photoexcited electrons in TiO2 migrate to the surface of Au cocatalysts in a larger work function for the CO2 reduction reaction through both TiO2 → Pd → Au and TiO2 → Au pathways.60 Given the same TiO2(001)–Pd(100), Pd(100)–Au(100) and TiO2(001)–Au(100) interfaces for electron transfer, the effect of interface structures on photocatalytic properties could be excluded. In addition to the diffusion of photogenerated electrons, previous studies have shown that charge transfer from Pd to Au occurs even without the assistance of external light excitation because of the larger electronegativity of Au (2.5) than that of Pd (2.2), which is in line with the charge re-distribution revealed by XPS results.61–63 The efficiency of electron migration from Pd to Au may be related to the thickness of the Au shell, which may explain the varied charge kinetics behaviors. Previous reports on Pd@Pt core–shell nanostructures have revealed that the Pt shell dependent interfacial polarization effect steers the flow of electrons from Pd to Pt.37,38 To confirm the possible mechanism behind this process, we employed first-principles simulation to examine the Au thickness dependent charge transfer between Pd and Au. As revealed by the charge density difference (Fig. S8†), when Au is 1 atomic layer thick, distinct interfacial polarization occurs, leading to the accumulation of a certain number of electrons on the exposed Au surface. However, this interfacial polarization effect dramatically decreases with the increase of Au thickness. Given the migration of photogenerated electrons through the Pd–Au interface during the photocatalysis process, Fig. 6 illustrates the charge density differences in the presence of one additional electron as a function of Au thickness. It can be clearly seen that the negative charge accumulation on the Au surface follows the same thickness dependence as in the neutral state. Nevertheless, the dependence of surface electron accumulation on the Au thickness is reduced when a photoelectron is added to Pd. Additional electrons remain on the Au surface as the shell thickness increases from 1 to 4 atomic layers, which explains the superior charge transfer and separation efficiency of TiO2–Pd@Au-1. The interfacial polarization effect serves as an additional driving force for the migration of photo-induced electrons from Pd to unoccupied 5d orbitals of Au. However, there is no denying that the effect of interfacial polarization still becomes weaker with the increase of Au thickness to a certain extent, which cannot clearly explain the superior photocatalytic activity of TiO2–Pd@Au-2 with 15-layer Au atoms in comparison with those of TiO2–Pd@Au-3 and TiO2–Au, implying that other factors may also contribute to the Au thickness dependent catalytic performance.
 Fig. 6  Differential charge density determined by first-principles simulations for the Au(100) shells on Pd(100) substrates in the presence of one additional electron (subtracting the charges in the neutral case (Fig. S8†) from this system). The Au shell thickness is altered from 1 to 4 layers. The olive and cyan colors represent an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively. 
Aside from charge separation, surface reactivity is another key factor determining the photocatalytic performance. In comparison with the photocurrent response, the difference in photocatalytic activity appears to be more obvious, implying that tunable shell thickness also mediates the surface reaction. Given the exposure of the same Au(100) facet, the influence of the surface structure of the cocatalyst on the catalytic reactivity could be excluded. Only the difference in surface strain should be the dominant factor responsible for the enhanced CO2-to-CO conversion. To gain an intrinsic understanding of the surface strain on CO2-reduction activity, we constructed Gibbs free energy diagrams for CO2 reduction to CO under different surface strains. As shown in Fig. 7a and Table S2,† the formation of intermediate *COOH on Au(100) is the key step in the CO2-to-CO conversion, which is associated with an increase in free energy of 0.42 eV under a compressive strain of −4.35%. While in the cases under strains of 0% and −1.93%, the free energy increases by 0.55 and 0.49 eV, respectively, suggesting that the surface compressive strain is beneficial to the formation of *COOH. According to the projected d-density of states (PDOS) of surface atoms on Au (100) surfaces (Fig. 7b), the d-band center shifts from −3.30 eV to −3.23 eV and then to −3.14 eV with the increase of surface strain from 0% to −1.93% and then to −4.35%. The upward shift of the d-band center toward the Fermi level results in higher surface electron density and stronger adsorbate bonding of Au (Fig. S9†). The changes of Gibbs free energy for the formation of *CO are analogous to that of *COOH. The hydrogenation of *COOH to *CO is more favorable on cocatalysts with high surface strain (−0.63 eV) as compared with those with low strain (−0.55 eV) and without strain (−0.51 eV) (Fig. 7a and Table S2†). From the viewpoint of reactive kinetics, the energy barriers were calculated to investigate the relationship between surface strain and the CO2 reduction reaction (Fig. S10 and S11†). It can be seen that the barrier for the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH on the Au(100) surface without strain is 1.74 eV, which decreases to 1.49 and 1.20 eV under a strain of −1.93% and −4.35%, respectively. Furthermore, for the further hydrogenation of *COOH to *CO, the barriers experience a gradual decline from 0.52 to 0.54 and to 0.47 eV when the strains increase from 0% to −1.93% and to −4.35%. Taken together, both the thermodynamic and kinetic analyses confirm the positive correlation between compressive strain and surface reactivity.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the synergistic interplay between surface strain and interfacial polarization in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with Pd@Au core–shell cocatalyst as a well-defined platform. The photocatalytic performance of Pd@Au cocatalysts integrated with TiO2 turned out to have a strong correlation with Au shell thickness. Remarkably, by substantially reducing the Au thickness to three atomic layers, TiO2–Pd@Au-1 achieves a high selectivity of 90.6% for CO production with an average rate of 166.3 μmol gcat−1 h−1. The combination of experimental analyses and theoretical simulations reveals that the compressive strain on the Au surface shifts up the d-band center and strengthens the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH, while charge polarization promotes interfacial electron transfer from Pd to Au. This work not only offers a method of collaborative utilization of surface strain and interfacial polarization in photocatalysis, but also enables the design of more active and highly selective photocatalysts toward solar-driven CO2 conversion with atomic precision based on united engineering on the surfaces and interfaces of cocatalysts.
