    , Accepted 3rd September 2018First published on 4th September 2018AbstractA triple-layer TiO2 (TiO2-TL) structure was synthesized with an over-layer composed of TiO2 flower-like microspheres (MSs), a middle layer of TiO2 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) and an under-layer of TiO2 compact film (CF) on a flexible titanium (Ti) mesh substrate using a one-step hydrothermal route followed by calcination post-treatment and used to make a series of flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The dependence of the physical features (diameter and length) of this hierarchical TiO2 structure on the NaOH concentration, temperature and hydrothermal duration is systematically studied. The fully flexible DSSCs employing such a hierarchical triple-layer TiO2 structure as a photoanode and poly-aniline film (PANI) on the indium doped tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) substrate as a counter electrode exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 5.04%, which mainly benefited from the enhanced capacity for effective light scattering of MSs and fast charge transfer of NSAs.
1. Introduction
In the past several years, flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) have attracted great interest due to their flexibility, light weight and being adaptable to different surface shapes.1–4 Typically, indium tin oxide coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (ITO/PET) films have been considered as attractive flexible substrates for FDSSCs. A variety of strategies have been explored to deposit TiO2 film on ITO/PET.5–9 However, this polymer substrate can't withstand the high-temperature sintering process, which results in poor crystallization and interparticle connection, and hampers the photovoltaic performance.10,11 Alternatively, metal foils are another group of potential flexible substrates for FDSSCs owing to their high heat-resistant ability and low electric resistance.12–15 However, the low flexibility and opacity of metal foils are restricting some possible applications of FDSSCs. Recently, researchers began to pay attention to metal meshes, which are used as a substitute for metal foils as the flexible substrates of FDSSCs.16–23 Metal mesh, particularly titanium (Ti) mesh, which possesses electrical conductivity, good flexibility, favorable light transparency and stable electrochemical activities, is a great potential candidate for FDSSC substrates.24–27
As a key part of FDSSCs, TiO2 film is required to have strong dye adsorption capacity and exhibit effective charge transport. The performance of a TiO2 nanomaterial is highly dependent on several parameters, including morphology, size and crystalline phase.28,29 To date, a variety of TiO2 morphologies, including nanoparticles,30 nanosheets,31 nanotube arrays,32,33 nanorod arrays,34 and three-dimensional (3D) architectures,35,36 have been successfully realized through various approaches. Among these, 3D hierarchical architectures assembled from nanoscale building blocks have currently been widely investigated.37,38 The 3D hierarchical TiO2 structure takes advantage of the properties of micron- or submicron-sized assemblies as well as of nanometer-sized building blocks and then displays attractive properties different from the nanoscale building blocks, for example, efficient light scattering of microsized 3D structures39 and fast charge transfer of oriented one-dimensional arrays.40 So far, hydrothermal methods, template-assisted synthesis,41 and electrochemical processes42 have been employed for the fabrication of 3D hierarchical TiO2 structures. However, in many cases, the synthesis processes are carried out under special conditions, such as template assistance, a high temperature and using organics as surfactant.41,43 Thus, it is still a great challenge to develop facile and effective methods for the fabrication of 3D hierarchical TiO2 structures with excellent properties, such as fast charge transfer, great light scattering ability and a large surface area to potentially improve the conversion efficiency of mesh-based flexible DSSCs.
Herein, for highly efficient flexible DSSCs, a hierarchical TiO2 triple-layer structure photoanode was developed with an over-layer composed of TiO2 flower-like MSs, a middle layer of TiO2 NSAs and an under-layer of compact TiO2 film. The flower-like MS layer consists of nanometric petals oriented in different directions, resulting in a huge increase in the surface area. The TiO2 NSA layer grew in a radially outward direction around the Ti wire uniformly and compactly. Such a hierarchical structure can guarantee the light scattering effect from MSs and fast charge transfer from NSAs (Fig. 1). In particular, 3D flower-like TiO2 MSs with hierarchical microstructures and a high surface area allow for multiple light scattering. Oriented TiO2 NSAs with one-dimensional nanostructures can provide a short pathway for electron transfer. Both of these have contributed to an increased photocurrent and an improved efficiency of DSSCs. We synthesized this hierarchical TiO2 structure via a hydrothermal method directly on polished Ti mesh substrates and used it as the photoanode for fully flexible DSSCs. The effect of the hydrothermal parameters on the synthesis of the hierarchical TiO2 is described and a detailed study of their structural and morphological properties is presented. The performance of the DSSCs based on this hierarchical TiO2 structure is investigated.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
The titanium (Ti) mesh was purchased from the Metrology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was made from commercially available 99.5 wt% pure titanium. Woven with a 0.10 mm single wire, the applied 100-mesh cloth had a 60% open area. Before the experiment began, the Ti meshes were polished in a hydrofluoric acid solution (HF:H2O = 1:4 (vol)) for 90 s, followed by ultrasonic cleaning with deionized water and ethanol for 15 min, respectively. All the applied aqueous solutions in the experiment were prepared by utilizing deionized water. All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade and were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Growth of TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF on Ti mesh
TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF was prepared on Ti mesh substrates through a hydrothermal procedure. In a typical synthesis, polished Ti meshes were placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave which was filled with 50 ml of 8 M NaOH aqueous solution, and then heated at 190 °C for 24 h. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature in air. The obtained products were washed several times using distilled water and then immersed in 0.1 M HCl solution for 30 min to replace Na+ with H+, depositing H-titanate on Ti meshes. Subsequently, the Ti meshes were removed from the HCl solution and rinsed with deionized water and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 2 h. Finally, the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF was obtained after heat treatment of H-titanate at 450 °C for 2 h. In control experiments, the hydrothermal conditions were changed, including the temperature (e.g., 150, 170, 190 and 210 °C), NaOH concentration (e.g., 4, 6, 8 and 10 M) and hydrothermal duration (e.g., 12, 24, 36 and 48 h).
2.3 Preparation of the photoanode and cell assembly
P25 paste was prepared as a binder to increase the contact of the Ti mesh with indium doped tin oxide/polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN). The P25 paste was prepared by mixing 1.0 g of P25 powder in 5 mL of isopropanol and 2 ml HCl (0.01 M), stirring and dropping a few drops of ammonia to adjust the pH to 5. It was then deposited by the screen printing method on clean ITO/PEN. A Ti mesh was quickly placed on the P25 film and dried in an oven at 120 °C for 30 min. When it had cooled to about 80 °C, the ITO/PEN with TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF was immersed in an ethanol solution of cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719 dye, 5 × 10−4 M) for 12 h at room temperature. After being rinsed with absolute ethyl alcohol to remove the physically adsorbed dye molecules, two edges of the mesh were coated with conductive silver paste and used as the working electrodes of DSSCs.
PANI/ITO-PEN was used as the counter electrode to assemble the DSSCs. Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (4 wt%, PVP, 99.8% purity, Urchem) and ammonium persulfate (25 mM, APS, 98% purity, TCI) were added to hydrochloric acid (0.5 M, HCl, 50 mL) containing aniline (25 mM, ANI, 99% purity, TCI). ITO/PEN (surface resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) was immersed in this solution under an ice bath for 20 min to obtain HCl-doped PANI films. After rinsing repeatedly with DI water and 1 M HCl, the transparent PANI film was dipped in HCl (1 M) for 4 h and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 30 min.
Subsequently, flexible DSSCs were assembled by clamping together the flexible working electrode and the PANI/ITO–PEN counter electrode. Once the electrodes were assembled, a drop of electrolyte solution was injected into the cell from the edges, and the cell was tested immediately. The electrolyte solution was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine, and 0.5 M tert-butylpridine in methoxypropionitrile. The active area of all cells was 0.2 cm2.
2.4 Characterization
The morphology of the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF on the Ti mesh was observed using a JSM-6510 scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The phase structures of the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF were obtained on a D/MAX-Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα irradiation at a scan rate (2θ) of 8° min−1. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.4 eV from adventitious carbon. The accelerating voltage and applied current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the products were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2010HR, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples were measured using an UV-visible spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere set-up (U-3010, Hitachi, Japan). BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard in a UV-vis diffuse reflectance experiment. Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660C Instruments) controlled by a computer. A solar simulator (Newport 91160) with an intensity of 1000 W m−2 (1 sun) was employed as the light resource, calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (PVM193, Oriel, Certificate number 2236.01 from NREL, USA). The mechanical flexibility of the solar cells fabricated on PEN substrates was tested using a custom-built two-point bending test system.
3. Results and discussion
Before hydrothermal reaction, the “activation” of the Ti mesh should be considered. Polishing with a suitable concentration of hydrofluoric acid can not only remove the oxides on the surface of the titanium mesh but also activate the surface of the titanium mesh to provide active sites for the hydrothermal reaction. Fig. 2a shows the low-magnification overall SEM image of a polished titanium mesh. It can be seen that the surface of the titanium mesh becomes rather rough after polishing and the magnified image shows that it was a regular uniform honeycomb (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2(c and d) show a representative photograph of a Ti mesh before and after hydrothermal reaction at 190 °C for 24 h. The mesh shows a uniform white color throughout the entire region, indicating that the hydrothermal reaction is consistent (Fig. 2d). This is further confirmed by FESEM measurements as will be discussed later. Further, as expected, the transparency of the hydrothermal mesh is retained, as evidenced by the explicit “mesh” characters on the background in Fig. 2d.

The phase purity and structure of the hydrothermal synthesis samples were characterized by XRD measurements. The XRD patterns of the titanate products obtained through the first hydrothermal growth steps and the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF nanostructures synthesized at different hydrothermal temperatures (Fig. 3) and NaOH concentrations (see Fig. S1, ESI†) are presented. For the first hydrothermal products, it could be seen from Fig. 3a that, after being exposed to hydrothermal treatment at 190 °C for 24 h, the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized titanate nanosheets can be assigned to the layered Na2Ti2O5·H2O with an orthorhombic unit cell (JCPD-47-0124). The diffraction peaks should be ascribed to the 200, 310, 020 and 002 lattice planes, respectively. For the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF nanostructures, all characteristic diffraction peaks were favorably indexed to the anatase TiO2 structure in terms of the JCPDS standard card (No. 01-073-1764) and no other characteristic impurity peaks were observed, apart from some peaks located at the 35.1491, 40.174, 52.882, 70.761, and 76.094 positions for the Ti metal substrate (JCPD-00-001-1197). It can be seen from Fig. 3b–e that, with the temperature increasing from 150 to 210 °C, the intensity of the diffraction peaks increased, indicating that the crystallinity of the as-prepared TiO2 samples was gradually enhanced. The same phenomenon can also be seen when the NaOH concentration was increased from 4 M to 10 M (Fig. S1†). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were utilized to obtain the chemical composition of the elements for each part of the structures (micro-flower, nanosheet array and under layer compact film) (Fig. 4). It can be seen from the results that Ti and O peaks were observed in each layer of TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF, and no Na peak was observed, which indicates that Na ion is fully replaced (Fig. 4a–c). XPS analysis was performed to further determine the elemental composition and the binding energies of the species (Table S2†). Fig. 4d shows the XPS survey spectrum of TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF. As expected, XPS peaks including Ti, O and C were observed, and no Na peak was observed, which was consistent with the EDS results. The presence of carbon at a binding energy of 284.42 was due to surface contamination when the TiO2 thin film was exposed to the atmosphere. The binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis were calibrated by taking the C 1s peak (284.42 eV) as a reference. The photoelectron peak of Ti 2p appears clearly at a binding energy Eb = 459.71 eV, and that of O 1s is at Eb = 529.66 eV. Fig. S3a and b† present the high-resolution Ti 2p and O 1s spectra. The binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are 458.61 and 464.41 eV (spin-energy separation of 5.8 eV), which are ascribed to Ti4+ bonding to oxygen. It can be seen from Fig. S3b† that there is one strong peak at 529.89 eV assigned to Ti–O. As seen in Table S2,† the O/Ti ratio was 1.98, which is close to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio 2. The XPS results confirm that the Na-titanate has decomposed into TiO2.

Fig. 5(a–d) show the typical top view and cross-sectional FESEM images of the as-obtained Na2Ti2O5·H2O MSs/NSAs/CF sample without calcination on a flexible Ti mesh (8 M, 190 °C, 24 h hydrothermal). From the cross section of a single wire in the mesh (Fig. 5b), we can determine that the under-layer is a compact TiO2 film. Na2Ti2O5·H2O nanosheet arrays grew on the surface of the compact TiO2 film. The compact TiO2 film with Na2Ti2O5·H2O nanosheet arrays on the surface grew in a radially outward direction around the Ti wire uniformly and compactly. Such compact packing of photoactive materials can reduce the contact between the conductive Ti substrate and the electrolyte, which is considered to be vital for suppressing the dark current in DSSCs.44 The length of the nanosheet arrays obtained under this condition is about 15 μm (Fig. 5c). It is interesting to note that numerous flower-like microspheres appeared on top of the nanosheet array film, as shown in Fig. 5b, which is attributed to the secondary self-assembly growth of the Na2Ti2O5·H2O nanosheets. The higher magnification image (Fig. 5d) shows that each flower is composed of many thin nanosheets with a thickness of about 4–6 nm, which are assembled spokewise, projected from a common central zone to form the flower-like architecture. Furthermore, each nano-petal has almost the same thickness, indicating that the sheet growth is strictly oriented and limited to the 2D plane during the whole growth process. After calcination treatment of the sample at 450 °C for 2 h, it is clearly observed that the microspheres still keep their spherical structure (Fig. 5e). The length of the TiO2 nanosheet arrays and the size of the microspheres did not change significantly after the calcination treatment (see Fig. S2, ESI†). However, by careful observation, we can see that the shape of the petals has changed a little. The top becomes sharper resulting in the formation of leaf-like petals. Furthermore, the HRTEM image (Fig. 5f) reveals that the calcined hierarchical TiO2 microspheres are composed of crystalline anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with a fringe spacing being approximately 0.35 nm corresponding to the (101) plane of the anatase phase.

We studied the effects of NaOH concentration, temperature and hydrothermal duration on the physical features of hierarchical TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF on a Ti mesh. As shown in Fig. 6a, the diameter of TiO2 microspheres can be increased from 6.9 to 25 μm by simply increasing the NaOH concentration from 4 to 10 M, and the length of nanosheet arrays can be increased from 6 to 30 μm. It should be noted that when the concentration is lower, i.e. 4 M, only a few TiO2 microspheres are formed. When the concentration is 6 M, some TiO2 microspheres can be observed. When the concentration is 8 M, the number of TiO2 microspheres is significantly increased. Increasing the NaOH concentration increased the number of TiO2 microspheres, but it also increased the size of the microspheres. Fig. 6b indicates that the diameter of TiO2 microspheres and the length of nanosheet arrays also depend on the hydrothermal temperature. The diameter of TiO2 microspheres increased from 9.5 to 30 μm by increasing the hydrothermal temperature from 150 to 210 °C, and the length of nanosheet arrays can be increased from 6.4 to 31 μm. It is known that the crystallinity of a crystal is greatly determined by the hydrothermal temperature, and a higher temperature would give rise to an improvement in the crystallinity. At a lower temperature, i.e. 150 °C, a lot of irregular TiO2 microspheres were formed, but the crystallinity was poor, which is in agreement with the results of the XRD. At 170 °C, the TiO2 microspheres became more regular, and the crystallinity was increased obviously. At 190 °C, a large number of TiO2 microspheres with a uniform morphology and size were obtained. Finally, at 210 °C, bigger TiO2 microspheres with a diameter of 30 μm were obtained. We also studied the kinetics of hierarchical TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF formation by synthesizing samples in different hydrothermal durations keeping the solution concentration at 8 M and the temperature at 190 °C. It can be seen from Fig. 6c that the diameter of TiO2 microspheres can be increased from 14 to 25 μm by increasing the hydrothermal duration from 12 to 48 h, and the length of nanosheet arrays can be increased from 12 to 16 μm. When the duration is 12 h, fewer TiO2 microspheres and nanosheet arrays of shorter lengths were formed. When the duration is up to 48 h, the length of nanosheet arrays does not increase too much (16 μm), but the number of TiO2 microspheres is significantly increased and the cavities of the Ti mesh were almost filled up.
 Fig. 6  Effects of NaOH concentration (a), temperature (b) and hydrothermal duration (c) on the physical features of TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF. 
Based on the above experimental results, the growth mechanism for the formation of TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF on Ti meshes in the novel hydrothermal process could be explained as follows. The related reactions that occurred can be described as the following equations: 2Ti + 2NaOH + 4H2O = Na2Ti2O5·H2O + 4H2 (hydrothermal reaction)(1) Na2Ti2O5·H2O + 2HCl = H2Ti2O5·H2O + 2NaCl (ion exchange)(2) H2Ti2O5·H2O ≜ 2TiO2 + 2H2O (calcination treatment)(3)
The Ti meshes acted both as the substrate and as the titanium source. During the hydrothermal process, first the Ti substrate reacted with the NaOH aqueous solution to form TiO6 octahedral ions. Then the Na2Ti2O5·H2O crystal nuclei, which were composed of edge-shared TiO6 octahedra and had a two-dimensional chain structure, were formed on the active sites of the surface of the Ti mesh substrate.45 After a great number of nuclei were formed, the supersaturation of TiO6 ions near or on the Ti provided the solution system for growth of Na2Ti2O5·H2O nanosheet arrays. The possible formation process of Na2Ti2O5·H2O nanosheet arrays is described as follows: at the beginning, the alkaline treatment of the Ti mesh induces their delamination into sodium dititanate nanosheet intermediates in a highly alkaline system, then large-sized sodium titanate nanosheets tend to grow via an Ostwald ripening-assisted oriented attachment crystal growth mechanism. We have found a few previous works where the formation of titanate nanosheet structures has been achieved by a hydrothermal method.46–48 As the reaction proceeded, flower-like microspheres appeared on the surface of the nanosheet arrays. The growth of the microspheres is due to the secondary self-assembly growth of the Na2Ti2O5·H2O nanosheets that follows the lowest-energy path. Our experimental results showed that the NaOH concentration is the key to the formation of microspheres, because when the concentration is low (4 M), only a few microspheres can be observed. In fact, we did not observe any microspheres when we experimented using a lower concentration (2 M).
After the ion-exchange process, Na+ ions were replaced by H+ ions to form H2Ti2O5·H2O. Further, H2Ti2O5·H2O is transformed into the anatase structure through the calcination process. In the structure transformation process, two types of reactions will occur simultaneously.48 One is an in situ topotactic transformation reaction, in which the structure of titanate is transformed into the TiO2 structure by an in situ topotactic dehydration reaction, where the morphology of the flower-like microspheres and nanosheet array precursor is retained after the topotactic reaction. Another is a dissolution–deposition reaction on the surface of titanate, resulting in a morphology change of the precursor from flat top petals to leaf-like petals. In the in situ topotactic dehydration reaction, the TiO6 octahedra in the titanate structure slightly and equably shift to the positions of the anatase structure. The (101) basal plane (the basal plane of the titanate nanosheet) is transformed into the (101) plane (the basal plane of sheet-like anatase nanocrystals) of the anatase structure in the topotactic reaction. The formation of leaf-like petals is due to dissolution reaction along the (100) plane of the anatase structure.
The I–V curves of the fully flexible DSSCs based on flexible TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF on Ti meshes synthesized in different hydrothermal durations are shown in Fig. 7a, and the corresponding short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), the fill factor of the cell (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are listed in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that with the hydrothermal duration increasing from 12 to 48 h, the Jsc values first increased from 7.72 to 12.23 mA cm−2, then decreased to 8.81 mA cm−2, but the VOC of DSSCs shows no remarkable dependence on the diameter of TiO2 MSs and the lengths of NSAs. In general, the VOC of DSSCs is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in TiO2 and the redox potential of the I3−/I− couple. The similarity in VOC means that the quasi-Fermi levels of electrons in the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF synthesized in different hydrothermal durations are similar. The illumination can induce a high concentration of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, which makes the quasi-Fermi levels in all the MSs/NSAs/CF structures approach the conduction band edge of TiO2.49 The PCE value of DSSCs based on MSs/NSAs/CF (12 h) is 3.32%, while the PCE value of DSSCs based on MSs/NSAs/CF (24 h) increased to 5.04%; however, by further increasing the hydrothermal duration to 36 h and 48 h, the PCE of the flexible DSSCs decreased to 2.42% and 3.89%, respectively. The decrease in PCE may be ascribed to the increased series resistance of DSSCs caused by the increased diameter and length of MSs/NSAs/CF. Meanwhile, the incident light is blocked when the cavities of the Ti meshes were almost filled. It is also noted that further extending the diameter and length of MSs/NSAs/CF makes it quite brittle. Care should be taken in assembling the DSSC device. It is also worth noting that the FDSSCs using TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF exhibited excellent flexibility. Fig. 7b summarizes the relationship between the performance parameters and the bending radius. The device performance did not change significantly even after bending with a bending radius of 1 mm. Fig. 7c also showed that the JSC, VOC, FF and PCE values of this flexible solar cell with 500 times of bending can still be maintained above 95% of those under a no-bending condition (bending radius: 10 mm), with JSC = 11.69 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.641 V, FF = 0.637, PCE = 4.77% and JSC = 12.05 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.645 V, FF = 0.639, and PCE = 4.97% respectively. The excellent flexibility of DSSCs based on the hierarchical TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF on the Ti mesh can be attributed to the following reasons. (a) The strain intensity, which is determined by the distance from the active layer to the mechanical neutral plane, will become smaller. This is because the distance from the mechanical neutral plane to the deposition will become much shorter if the mesh is used as the substrate, compared with foil as the substrate.50 (b) The ordered-aligned TiO2 array structure can effectively release the bending stress and improve the bending resistance of the device. The gaps between TiO2 MSs can be easily adjusted during the bending treatment. However, the closely packed TiO2 nanoparticles lead to a lack of space between them and uncontrollable squeezing between each other during bending tests.51 (c) In addition, the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF on the Ti mesh with a three-dimensional structure has a unique advantage to benefit bending. The metal wires surrounded with TiO2 layers can be considered as independent coaxial cables. The active layer is still stably fixed to the mesh wires during bending and will not cause deposition loss or peeling. In contrast, the deposits on metal foil easily fall off once they crack or break under bending.50

The enhanced light-scattering ability of the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF may also have contributed to the increased JSC and PCE values. Fig. 8 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF obtained at different hydrothermal times, in comparison with commercially available P25 nanoparticles (P25 NP). It is clearly observed that in the visible-light region, the light absorption of the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF was enhanced when the hydrothermal time was increased from 12 h to 24 h. However, light absorption decreased when the hydrothermal time was increased to 36 h and 48 h. In addition, except for the sample obtained at a hydrothermal time of 12 h which has weaker light absorption in the range of 250–380 nm compared with P25, the light absorption of the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF is considerably stronger than that of P25 in all wavelength ranges, indicating that TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF has a higher light scattering effect due to its relatively lager particle size and complicated morphology compared with the P25 nanoparticles. Therefore, it is expected that this light scattering effect can be used in the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode to enhance the light harvesting efficiency due to the lengthened optical path in the film electrode.

In order to obtain deeper insights into the interfacial charge transfer process within the fabricated FDSSC with the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded in the frequency range between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz at an open circuit bias under illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 9), and the equivalent electrical circuit is shown in the inset. Two semicircles including a large one at a middle frequency and a small one at a high frequency can be observed (Fig. 9a). Rs is attributed to the sheet resistance of the ITO/PEN substrate and the contact resistance at the ITO–PEN/TiO2 interface.52 The Rs values of DSSCs based on the P25 NP photoanode and TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanodes calculated according to the equivalent circuit were 22.46 Ω and 21.59 Ω, respectively. It is clear that Rs slightly increases when TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanodes are used, implying better electronic contact between TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanodes and ITO–PEN. The biggest semicircle located at medium frequencies was related to the charge transfer resistance (R2) within the TiO2 film and the interfacial capacitance (CPE2) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.46R2 plays a vital role in the photovoltaic performance of the FDSSC in that it is related to the number of electrons going back to the electrolyte at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The TiO2/electrolyte was significant as the interface controlling the photocurrent of the FDSSC. The R2 values of FDSSCs based on the P25 NP photoanode and TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode calculated according to the equivalent circuit were 43.24 Ω and 23.08 Ω, respectively. It is clear that the R2 value of DSSCs based on the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode is smaller than that of DSSCs based on the P25 NP photoanode. It is indicated that the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode composed of oriented nanosheet-based one-dimensional nanostructures can improve electron transfer, and the fast electron transfer of photoelectrons from the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode to ITO–PEN will reduce the recombination and back reactions of electrons with I3−. The electrochemical parameters were estimated by fitting experimental data with the equivalent circuit and are listed in the inset of Fig. 9b.

Based on the Bode phase plots (Fig. 9b), the frequency shifted to the lower frequency region when the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode was used. The maximum frequencies (fmax) in the middle frequency region of the Bode plots for the P25 NP photoanode and TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode were 237.8 Hz and 22.32 Hz, respectively. Since fmax is inversely associated with the electron lifetime τe = 1/(2πfmax),53,54 the decrease in fmax indicated the reduced rate of the charge-recombination process in the DSSC. The τe values of DSSCs based on the P25 NP photoanode and TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode were calculated to be 0.67 ms and 7.13 ms, respectively. A longer τe means a lower recombination rate of electrons during the electron transfer across the photoanode film.55 It can be seen that the DSSC based on the MSs/NSAs/CF photoanode has a longer τe, which was in good agreement with the analysis of PCE.
It is known that the PCE of FDSSCs is basically decided by the VOC, the JSC as well as the FF; the high PCE of DSSCs based on the hierarchical TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF can be attributed to the combined effects of several factors: firstly, the strong light scattering of TiO2 MSs enables the increase in the optical path length of incident light within the film and effectively enhances light harvesting, which can be seen from the UV absorption spectra. Secondly, uniform and compact formation of TiO2 nanosheet arrays over an underlying network of a Ti backbone enhances the already improved charge collection efficiency resulting from the oriented one-dimensional nanostructure. Thirdly, the TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF nanostructure has an exceptional ability for electron–hole separation and transmits the electrons, which can be seen from its smaller charge transfer resistance (R2) and longer electron lifetime (τe).
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesitized TiO2 flower-like microspheres/nanosheet arrays/compact film triple-layer TiO2 photoanodes on a flexible Ti mesh substrate by a facile hydrothermal method and demonstrated their application in fully flexible DSSCs. The TiO2 MSs are composed of many thin nanosheets with a thickness of about 4–6 nm. The TiO2 NSAs grew in a radially outward direction around the Ti wire uniformly and compactly. The diameter of the TiO2 MSs and the length of the TiO2 NSAs increased with the NaOH concentration, temperature and hydrothermal duration. The light absorption of TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF in the visible region is significantly enhanced due to its enhanced light-scattering ability. Varying the diameter of TiO2 MSs and the length of TiO2 NSAs has been demonstrated to critically influence the PCE of DSSCs. TiO2 MSs/NSAs/CF obtained under optimized experimental condition (8 M, 190 °C and 24 h) on a Ti mesh substrate achieved a PCE of 5.04%. Such a high PCE of flexible DSSCs can be ascribed to their enhanced light-scattering ability from TiO2 MSs and improved charge collection efficiency resulting from the TiO2 NSAs with an oriented one-dimensional nanostructure.
