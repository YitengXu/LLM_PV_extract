    , Accepted 26th April 2005First published on 13th May 2005AbstractBy employing mixed inorganic precursors and finely tuning the ageing conditions, crack-free surfactant-templated mesoporous titania films of thickness up to 4 µm have been obtained efficiently. Low angle XRD and TEM show that the mesostructure of the multilayered films was maintained when calcined at the developed temperature of 350 °C, but those films developed crystallinity. A novel type of mesoporous structure featuring highly crystallized anatase framework was produced by a two-step sintering process. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated from these films. The short circuit photocurrent (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and thus the performance of the cell was greatly enhanced when adopting a two-step sintering process, confirming that high crystallinity of the TiO2 electrode is required for high efficiency conversion.
Introduction
The organization and assembly of inorganic and organic materials into a wealth of textured forms represent an exciting direction for developing novel multifunctional materials.1 Mesoporous materials2 prepared via
				‘soft chemistry’ (templated by surfactants, block copolymers, colloids, etc.) have overcome the restriction of the dimensions and accessibility of the well developed microporous solids and have therefore sparked a wide spectrum of interest in various areas. In this field, most of the research has been initially devoted to silica-based materials,3 and later this approach was extended to non-silica oxides,4 which may hold promise for application to electron transfer, magnetic interactions, photocatalysis or catalyst support. In particular, titania is a very interesting material as it can be used in the photodegradation of environmental pollutants,5 splitting of water,6etc. Moreover, titania, especially in its anatase phase, has been intensively investigated as an electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells over the past decade since M. Grätzel and co-workers reported their breakthrough work.7,8 For many of these applications, processing the material as a coating is essential. Mesoporous titania thin films have been extensively investigated,9 but most of the mesopores in the films are derived from the intercrystalline voids rather than regular and integrated pores.10
Compared with fractal-like aggregates, surfactant-templated mesoporous TiO2 has a degree of order and continuous framework. Therefore, mesoporous TiO2 are expected to facilitate pore diffusion, give easier access to the film surface, and allow the nanocrystal junctions to be formed under better control.11 In 1998, Stucky and co-workers reported for the first time a generalized synthesis method for large-pore mesoporous oxides.12 More importantly, these large pore nonsiliceous materials exhibit relatively thicker walls (normally above 4 nm), paving the way for the possibility of crystalline nanoparticles formation within the pore walls, which is indeed interesting for a wealth of applications. However, as to the preparation of mesoporous TiO2, TiCl4 was used as the single inorganic precursor and thus, the extremely strong acidic media generated via alcoholysis of TiCl4 intended to restrain the hydrolysis and condensation of titano species will result in a relatively long film-ageing time, which may be somewhat disadvantageous for use in multi-layered film preparations. Herein, we employed mixed inorganic precursors (TiCl4 and Ti(OC3H7)4) as previously reported,13 which make the mesostructured films gel more easily, to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells composed of multi-layered mesoporous TiO2 films.
Previous literature has well documented the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells using mesoporous titania (in the anatase phase).14 However, almost all of them deal with mesoporous anatase nanoparticle aggregates, the mesopores of which are derived from the intercrystalline voids. Reports of the application of surfactant-templated mesoporous TiO2 still remain limited, or show very low efficiency due to the amorphous nature of the surfactant-templated mesoporous materials.15,16 For the applications of mesoporous TiO2 films in DSSCs, two issues must be addressed. Firstly, the films must reach a certain thickness. Secondly, the film must be highly crystalline for the transfer of the injected electrons. Therefore, attempts to increase the thickness and the crystallinity of the mesoporous TiO2 framework are much desired. In this article, we report the preparation of a fully crystalline multi-layered mesoporous TiO2 films reaching a thickness up to 4.0 µm and their applications as electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells.
Experimental
General
Tri-block copolymer Pluronic P123 and titanium isopropoxide were purchased from Aldrich. Propylene carbonate and tert-butylpyridine were obtained from Acros. The dye Ru[L2(NCS)2] (donated as N3, L = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid), was synthesized according to literature.8 All the other solvent and chemicals used in the experiments were at least reagent grade (Beijing Chemical Factory, Beijing China) and used as received. The electrolyte used in this work is 0.5 M LiI + 0.05 M I2 + 0.1 M tert-butylpyridine in 1 : 1 (volume ratio) acetonitrile–propylene carbonate. Optically transparent electrode were made from an F-doped SnO2-coated glass plate (CTO, 85% transmittance in the visible, 20 Ω per square) received as a gift from the General Electronics Company.
The structural quality of the TiO2 samples was monitored by both low-angle and wide-angle powder X-ray diffractions (XRD), recorded on a German Bruker D4 X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. The film samples were scratched from the substrate and made as powder form prior to XRD measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were conducted on a JEOL 2011 microscope operated at 200 kV. For TEM measurements, the samples were prepared by dispersing the scratched powder products from the film as slurry in acetone or ethanol, after which they were dispersed and dried on a porous carbon film on a Cu grid. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) was estimated using adsorption data in a relative pressure range from 0.04 to 0.3. The total pore volume, Vt, was estimated from the amount of N2 adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.95. The mesopore size distributions (PSD) were calculated by analyzing the adsorption data of the N2 isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The film thickness was determined with a DEKTAK-3 profilometer. The UV-Vis spectra of the dye-covered mesoporous and nanoparticle films deposited on conducting glass substrate were measured with a Shimadzu mode 3100UV-VIS-NIR (full name) spectrophotometer. The spectra of the dye-infiltrated (or dye-adsorbed) films were referenced to those of the respective dye-free samples. Photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out in a standard two-electrode system. Photocurrent-voltage I–V measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. A 500 W Xe lamp (Ushio Electric, Tokyo, Japan) was employed as the light source in conjunction with an IRA-25S filter (Schott, USA) and a GG400 cutoff filter (Toshiba, Japan). Monochromatic light in the range of 400 to 800 nm was obtained by setting an IRA-25S filter and a suitable band-pass filter (Schott, USA) in the path of the light beam before the solar cell.
Synthesis of mesoporous titania
The synthetic procedure of the mother solution was similar to that reported by Tian et al.,13 except that worm-like mesoporous multilayered films were designed. Typically, 1.0 g of P123 (EO20PO70EO20, Mav = 5800) was dissolved in 20 g of ethanol, then 0.6 g of TiCl4 and 2.0 g of titanium isopropoxide were added in turn to the solution and the mixture was further stirred at 25 °C for 2 h.

Electrode S1. 
To make crack-free mesoporous TiO2 films, the as-synthesized mother solution was diluted by ethanol (mother solution–ethanol = 2 : 1, volume ratio) and spread onto the surface of a conducting glass by doctor-blading technique. The coated CTO were dried and aged under relative humidity (RH) of 20–30% and at 40 °C for about 2 h. Additional heating at 130 °C for 2 h was required to promote framework crossing-linkage and to prevent the films from cracking and mesostructure collapse under high temperature treatment.17 Finally, the as-made mesostructured hybrid films were sintered at 350 °C for 2 h. TiO2 films with different thickness were obtained by repeating this process for different times. The prepared multi-layered films on CTO were denoted as S1. For BET measurement, a large-area film was prepared as described above for S1 on a glass sheet (donated as L-S1). After calcinations, the film was scratched from the glass.


Electrode S2. 
The highly crystallized mesoporous TiO2 films were prepared by adopting a two-step calcination procedure. The first step was quite similar to the sintering process as illustrated above. Then the multi-layered films were further treated at 450 °C for 2 h. The prepared films on CTO were further denoted as S2. For BET measurement, also a large area film was prepared as the process described above for S2 (donated as L-S2). After calcinations, the film was scratched from the glass.


Electrode S3. 
TiO2 nanoparticle films were prepared from colloids with particles of about 15 nm in diameter. The preparation of the nanoparticle colloid was similar to that of previous literature.8 The colloids was spread onto the conducting glass evenly (also using the doctor-blading technique), and then the sample was dried in air, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 40 min. The film thickness was about 2.5 µm. Before being immersed in the dye solution for coloration, the films calcined at 450 °C were soaked in 0.2 M aqueous TiCl4 solution for 24 h followed by washing with deionized water and annealing again at 450 °C for 40 min.18
To remove impurities, all the films mentioned above were heated at 150 °C for 0.5 h and then cooled down to 80 °C prior to immersion in the dye solution. The films were colored by immersing them in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of N3 in absolute ethanol for about 24 h. The fabrication of the solar cell was the same as previously documented.18

Results and discussion
Structural characterization of the mesoporous titania film

Fig. 1a (curve A) shows the low-angle powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the powder scratched from S1. A broad Bragg diffraction peak centred at 2θ of 0.80 suggests the formation of mesostructured textures. The absence of other distinguishable peaks indicates that mesoporous TiO2 films are not ordered, but just worm-like, which is caused by the low RH (20–30%) employed during film gelation.1 Multiple film deposition procedures may also contribute to the formation of worm-like mesostructures. It should be noted here that since the titania films were processed via multiple-layer deposition and sintering, there might be a mesoscopic textural gradient along the direction perpendicular to the substrate. This presumption can be rationally proved by curve B and curve C in Fig. 1a, which represent mesoporous titania membranes sintered at 350 °C for 2 and 24 h, respectively. It is clear that mesoporous TiO2 sintered for a longer time exhibits lower structural ordering, which is very probably caused by the crystallization process. Therefore, we tentatively conclude that the layers close to the film/air surface feature better mesostructures than those close to the film/substrate interface, since the former underwent less sintering cycles or a shorter overall sintering duration. This mesoscopic structural gradient is also determined by the sintering temperature (350 °C) if the mesopores of the titania coatings that directly generated from the organic templates need to be retained, since higher temperature calcination (such as 380 °C) would lead to mesostructure collapse when sintered for over 18 h (judged from small-angle XRD patterns, not shown here).

Wide-angle XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1b (curve A) shows several well resolved peaks, as indexed as (101), (004), (200), (105), (204), etc. which are typical of anatase phase TiO2. The average grain size of anatase nanocrystals is calculated by the Scherrer equation to be 4.5 ± 0.5 nm. Combined with curve B and curve C, the titania coatings also proved to feature a crystallinity (atomic scale) gradient, namely, the layers deposited at the early stage have higher crystallinity than those deposited at the later stage.
Nitrogen sorption curve (Fig. 2) of mesoporous TiO2 coatings L-S1 is a typical IV isotherm with an H2 type hysteresis loop. The coatings have a uniform pore size centered at ca. 7.4 nm, though the mesostructures are not perpendicularly uniform along the substrate, and they have relatively high BET surface area (SBET = 190 m2 g−1) and high pore volume (Vt = 0.28 cm3 g−1), which are quite advantageous for dye adsorption.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in Fig. 3a displays worm-like patterns, further confirming that the mesoporous TiO2 films exhibit less ordered 3D mesostructures. A selected area electron diffraction pattern (inset) of the films confirms that the TiO2 frameworks are polycrystalline and can be well indexed as anatase, which is in accordance with the wide-angle XRD data. The HREM image (Fig. 3b) suggests the partially crystalline nature of mesoporous TiO2 coatings and the mesopore walls were built up of anatase nanocrystals (marked by circles) which were embedded within the amorphous titania matrix. This “brick-and-mortar” structure helps to preserve the mesoporous structures, and makes the mesoporous TiO2 film a novel inorganic ‘host’ for dye molecules. The presence of nanocrystals paves the functions of dye-sensitized solar cells as discussed below.

When the aforementioned mesoporous titania coatings are further sintered at 450 °C for another 2 h, the mesostructures are lost to a certain degree, as is suggested by their small-angle XRD pattern (not shown). However, the crystallinity of the coatings clearly increases (see Fig. 4a), when compared with that of titania films sintered at 350 °C. Moreover, the average grain size of anatase nanocrystals calculated by the Scherrer equation is 7.5 ± 0.5 nm, larger than that of nanocrystals sintered at 350 °C.

The N2 sorption curve of mesoporous titania coatings prepared via two-step sintering process L-S2 (Fig. 4b) exhibits a typical IV isotherm, but different to that of TiO2 coatings sintered at 350 °C L-S1, it shows a pseudo-H1 type hysteresis loops. This suggests that the texture of the coatings has changed upon higher temperature treatment. Furthermore, the mesopore size decreases from 7.4 to 6.4 nm, clearly triggered by sintering at 450 °C for another 2 h. The total surface area is calculated to be 120 m2 g−1, which is sufficient to absorb a large amount of dye.
Then, what is the exact mesostructure of the film on S2? TEM and HREM images of the scratched coatings shown in Fig. 5 clearly suggest another type of worm-like mesoporous structures. Although the irregular nature of the mesopores (lack of small-angle XRD diffractions), the pores are not intercrystalline voids as are those of nanoparticle aggregates. We tentatively believe that these mesopores originate from the partial degradation and rearrangement of the mesopores generated upon detemplating at 350 °C, the latter feature has a direct correlation with the micellar structures of the organic structure-directing agents (P123) used. HREM images (Fig. 5b) clearly indicate that the mesoporous titania coatings are highly crystalline and almost no amorphous structures can be observed. The SAED pattern (Fig. 5c) further corroborates the conclusion that a more highly crystalline mesoporous anatase framework is obtained when adopting a two-step sintering process. This virtue enables the superior performance of the titania based dye sensitized solar cells, as discussed below.
 Fig. 5  TEM images (a), (b) and (d) and SAED pattern (c) of mesoporous titania samples, prepared via (a–c) two-step sintering S1 and (d) direct sintering at 450 °C. 
We also prepared TiO2 coatings via the direct sintering at 450 °C. But TEM observations (Fig. 5d) indicate that these mesoporous coatings are basically composed of nanocrystal aggregates (10–20 nm in size), which is quite similar to the morphology of conventional mesoporous nanocrystalline anatase that is employed as a dye-sensitized solar cell matrix.
The role of this two-step sintering can be elucidated as follows: part of the anatase nuclei have been formed at low temperature (350 °C), the anisotropic and highly dispersed nature of which impede the anatase crystal growth at higher temperature (450 °C). Therefore, the mesoporous structure will not totally convert to large nanocrystal aggregates. This is quite different from the direct high temperature calcination at 450 °C, since the nucleation and growth of anatase crystals will not be restrained therein.
Application in dye-sensitized solar cells
In 1991, M. Grätzel et al. first reported the dye-sensitized solar cell with efficiency as high as 10%.7,8 The high efficiency is attributed to the high surface area of the nanoparticle TiO2 electrode. The monolayer of the dye adsorbed on the huge surface can harvest light efficiently and thus a high efficiency of the solar cell can be obtained. The surface areas normally used are between 80–120 m2 g−1, providing the surface required for dye monolayer adsorptions to yield a significant optical density. The surface area of the mesoporous titania synthesized via the surfactant-templating pathway is around 100–200 m2 g−1 and partially or fully crystalline, which makes this type of mesoporous titania attractive for dye-sensitized solar cell. A given optical density is expected to be achieved by using a thinner electrode. By doing so, the mean path of a injected electron should be shortened, which is expected to reduce the chance of electron recombination and increase the collecting efficiency of the cells, thus improving the efficiency of the solar cells.15
As the film thickness will greatly affect the performance of the cell, we investigated the effect of the film thickness on the cell parameters using the films S1 and S2. Table 1 and Table 2 illustrate the results for the two kinds of films whose thickness varied from 1.0 to 4.0 µm.

It can be seen from the tables that the film thickness greatly affects the cells’ performance. When the film thickness is increased from 1.0 to about 2.5 µm, the photocurrent Isc increases from 1.63 mA cm−2 to 3.76 mA cm−2 and from 7.73 mA cm−2 to 13.30 mA cm−2 for the samples S1 and S2, respectively. Concomitantly, the Voc decreased in both cases. For the homogeneously harvested light by the dye molecules adsorbed on the film, one would expect the electron injection current density, and thus Isc, to increase approximately linearly with the film thickness, owing to the increased total surface area of the film and therefore the increase the amount of dye adsorbed by the film. In Table 1 and Table 2, we can see that the Isc increased with increased film thickness. But, when the films are thicker, both Isc of the cells (S1, S2, respectively) decreased; this can be ascribed to the following two reasons. Firstly, as the film thickness is increased, the numbers of recombination centres are also expected to increased, especially for the films prepared by our method sintered at 350 °C. For S1, parts of the walls of the mesoporous TiO2 are composed of amorphous TiO2, which should greatly decrease the efficiency of the cell. Secondly, when the films are thicker, the transparency of the films is greatly decreased as they become more opaque, which is detrimental to the performance of the cells, especially for the films that experienced the additional 450 °C treatment, which crack more readily. From the above discussions, we can see that the optimal film thickness in our experiment is around 2.5 µm. We chose 2.5 µm thick films to carry out all of the following experiments, unless otherwise specified.
The absorbance spectra of the three kinds of films (S1, S2, and S3) were measured with a Shimadzu mode 3100UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (see Fig. 6). The extinction coefficient of the dye at 532 nm is 1.42 × 107 cm2 mol−1. The absorbance for S3, S2, S1 at 532 nm is 0.4785, 0.5476 and 0.7825, respectively, so dividing this by the extinction coefficient of the dye, we can deduce that the surface concentration of the dye on the films is 3.37 × 10−8, 3.86 × 10−8 and 5.51 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for the S3, S2 and S1, respectively. It is obvious that the amount of dye adsorbed on the S1 film sintered at 350 °C is much greater than that adsorbed on the S2 film and the S3 film. It is believed that this fact should be attributed to the high surface area of the mesostructured film sintered at low temperature. When the mesostructured film is sintered at 450 °C for another 2 h, the mesostructure of the film collapses and the BET surface decreases greatly. So it is natural that the amount of dye adsorbed by the S2 film decreases with higher sintering temperatures. But, even if sintered at a higher temperature, i.e. 450 °C, the BET surface area of the S2 film is still a little higher than that for the S3. More importantly, as can be seen in the HREM image (Fig. 5b), the S2 film is almost completely crystallized, so it is expected that the photo–current energy conversion efficiency of the mesoporous titania film prepared via two-step sintering is comparable to that of a nanoparticle film with the same thickness.

Fig. 7 shows the cell performance obtained with the thin layer sandwich-type solar cells made with the two mesoporous films sintered by different method under illumination of simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) by a xenon lamp. The short-circuit photocurrent (Isc) and open circuit photovoltage (Voc) were 3.76 mA cm2 and 0.634 V for the cell based on the S1 electrode, while that for the S2 based electrode is 13.30 mA cm2 and 718 V, respectively. The fill factors for the cells are 0.524 and 0.564 for electrode S1, S2, respectively. The overall light to electricity conversion efficiency(η) was obtained by the equation:η = (Voc
						×
						Isc
						× FF)/Pinhere the Pin is the incident light intensity, Voc is the open circuit voltage, Isc is the short circuit current, and FF is the fill factor. According to Fig. 7, the power conversion efficiencies for the two cells are 1.25 and 5.31%. To the best of our knowledge, this represents for the first time an electrode (S2) made with surfactant-templated mesoporous titania of such a high efficiency. Zaban et al.16 have reported the fabrication and characterization of dye-sensitized solar-cells, but the light to electricity conversion efficiency in their work is extremely low, which is obviously due to the extremely low crystallinity of the surfactant-templated mesoporous titania matrix employed and the difficulty to completely remove the surfactant therein. In our work, especially when adopting a two-step sintering procedure, the crystallinity of the titania is much higher, thus the power conversion efficiency is greatly enhanced compared to the result reported earlier.16

We further compared the performance of the cells fabricated using S2 and S3. Fig. 8 displays the monochromatic photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the S2 and S3 electrodes, as a function of wavelength at short circuit, and no correction was made for the reflection loss of the conducting glass. The IPCE can be expressed theoretically as the product of the light absorption efficiency of the dye, the quantum yield of charge injection, and the efficiency of collecting the injected electron at the back contact. Data show that in the range of 400–800 nm, the IPCE of the S2 based solar cell is a little higher than that of S3 based solar cell, especially in the range of 400–520 nm.

Fig. 9 compares the I–V characteristics of dye-sensitized mesoporous and nanoparticle films of the same thickness (2.5 µm) under simulated sunlight. The open-circuit voltage of S2 is 0.718 V, a little lower than that of S3, 0.743 V. While the short-circuit current of the S2 based solar cell (13.22 mA cm−2) is a little higher than the S3 based electrode (11.69 mA cm−2). The respective overall energy conversion efficiencies of the S2 and S3 based cells are 5.31 and 5.21%, respectively. As mentioned above, the amount of the dye adsorbed by the S2 electrode is a little higher than the dye adsorbed by the S3 electrode due to its higher surface area. Considering the fact that sintering at another 450 °C can fully crystallize the amorphous wall of the titania framework. Therefore, the overall energy conversion efficiency of the S2 is a little higher than that of S3 based solar cell.

Conclusions
Multilayered mesoporous TiO2 films of thickness up to 4 µm were prepared by using mixed precursors, which greatly shortened the ageing time. When sintered at 350 °C, the mesostructure of the multilayered films (S1) was maintained. By employing two-step sintering procedure, a novel type of mesoporous structure (S2) was obtained with high crystallinity. The mesoporous films (S2) still have higher BET surface areas compared to conventional nanoparticle films. More dyes were adsorbed due to their high surface area, which makes these mesoporous TiO2 films attractive for dye-sensitized solar cells. Our results indicate that this surfactant-templated highly crystallized mesoporous TiO2 exhibited a light to electricity conversion efficiency comparable to that of nanocrystalline anatase films with the same thickness.

Note: While we finished drafting this manuscript, we noticed a publication on the hydrothermal seeded synthesis of mesoporous titania (powder) for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (calcined at 450 for 30 min), published by Lu et al., which is listed as ref. 19, below.
