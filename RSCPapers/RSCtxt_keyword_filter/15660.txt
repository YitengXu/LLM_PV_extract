    , Accepted 26th March 2015First published on 27th March 2015AbstractChemical modification of the aligned single crystalline TiO2 nanorods provides possibilities to improve their photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity under visible light. This work reports on the N/Si co-doped single crystal rutile TiO2 nanorods fabricated by a flexible one-step hydrothermal procedure for PEC water splitting, exhibiting a photocurrent of 1.77 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a noticeable visible-light response under standard testing conditions (xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter, 100 mW cm−2). The excellent PEC activity can be attributed to the synergetic effect of N and Si co-dopants, which enhances the incident photon to current conversion efficiency both in ultraviolet and visible regions, and improves the charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. A solar-powered water splitting device has been designed by combining an efficient perovskite solar cell with the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs-based PEC system, achieving an overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 1.1%. This has been the highest value reported for TiO2-based PEC systems so far.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen production provides a promising route for clean, low-cost, and environmentally friendly production of hydrogen from solar energy. The key component in the PEC water splitting technology is the photocatalyst that should absorb enough sunlight and split water to hydrogen and oxygen. In a PEC solar hydrogen-generation system, the reduction reaction takes place at the photocathode, whereas the oxidation reaction occurs at the photoanode. In the past decades, a large number of semiconductors, such as TiO2,1 Fe2O3,2 and WO3,3 have been investigated to effectively harvest sunlight and split water. Among them TiO2 has attracted extensive attention for water splitting since the report by Fujishima.4,5 In addition to its low cost, chemical stability, resistance to photo-corrosion and environmental friendliness, the fascination of TiO2 comes from its electronic band edge positions, which theoretically points out the feasibility for water splitting.6,7
Photo-electrodes fabricated from oriented, one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanostructures such as nanorods, nano-wires, and nanotubes are receiving wide attention. Specifically, oriented single crystalline TiO2 NRs on a transparent conductive substrate should be most desirable for PEC water splitting, but achieving these structures has been limited by the availability of synthetic techniques.8,9 A low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency has been seen in the TiO2-based PEC system.4,10 A challenge in increasing the STH conversion efficiency of this system is to develop photoanodes with efficient visible light absorption.11 An enormous amount of research has been devoted to broadening the absorption of TiO2 into the visible light range. For example, the band gap of TiO2 can be decreased by substituting lattice oxygen with nonmetal elements such as S, N, and F.12–14 N doped TiO2 turns out to be a good candidate, however a lower UV-activity has been usually found for these samples compared to the un-doped ones.15 The stability of N-doped TiO2 was reported to become worse.16 Si has been reported to be a preferable dopant for TiO2 with unique properties of high thermal stability and fewer carrier-recombination centers.16 This can be attributed to the Si 3p states, which are effectively mixed with O 2p states.17 Very recently, co-doping of TiO2 with two elements was reported to further improve the visible-light PEC activity of TiO2.18–22 For instance, Hwang et al. reported Sn and C codoped single crystal TiO2 nanowires (NWs).23 The resulting electrodes showed photoelectron-catalytic activity with 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under Hg–Xe lamp irradiation, which mainly originated from the photo-to-electricity conversion in the ultraviolet region. Zheng et al. reported W and C co-doped TiO2 NWs.24 The electrode showed a photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under xenon lamp irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The enhancement was ascribed to the improved electrical conductivity and activity for the oxygen-evolution reaction due to the synergistic effects of codoping. Zhang et al.18 fabricated N/Si-codoped TiO2 hollow microspheres via an aerosol flow synthesis method. This work has demonstrated that the photocatalytic performance in the degradation of salicylic acid could be improved due to the synergistic effects of codoping. Besides, the density functional theory calculation and first principle calculation suggest that codoping TiO2 with N and Si codopants is more effective than mono-doping with respect to the photo-electrochemical performance.25,26 Their results have shown that the TiO2 with N/Si codoping can harvest visible light owing to the N 2p in the ‘forbidden gap’ and Si 3s–3p at the tail of the conduction band. Besides, the Si 3p orbital of N/Si-codoped TiO2 plays a key role in increasing the carrier mobility which is beneficial for the PEC performance.
In this study, we describe a facile hydrothermal method to grow an oriented N/Si co-doped single crystalline rutile TiO2 NR film on a transparent conductive FTO substrate for PEC water splitting. An enhancement in the photoelectrocatalytic activity was observed for the photoelectrode based on N/Si codoped TiO2 NRs. Further, an integrated device combining a CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cell and the N/Si codoped TiO2 NR PEC cell was designed to realize solar-powered water splitting. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of this device reaches 1.1%, which is the highest reported value compared to other TiO2 based PEC cells.
Experimental section
Synthesis of the TiO2-based photoanodes
The photoanode of N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs were synthesized on the FTO substrate by a hydrothermal method.27 The diameter, length and density of the NRs could be varied by changing the growth parameters, such as growth time, growth temperature, acidity and additives. In a typical experiment, 15 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%) was diluted with 15 mL of deionized (DI) water, and then 500 μL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, Sigma-Aldrich, >99%) was added into the diluted HCl solution. After 30 min of continuous stirring, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and polyimide (PI) were added into the mixed solution and stirred for another 30 min to obtain a homogeneous pale yellow solution. Finally, the precursor solution was transferred into a 50 mL sealed Teflon reactor. The clean FTO substrate was placed at an angle against the wall of the reactor with the conductive side facing down. The sealed autoclave was heated at 150 °C for 12 h in an oven and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. A uniform pale yellow film composed of N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs was found on the FTO glass. The sample was then washed with DI water and dried under a high purity nitrogen stream. Finally, the sample was annealed in air at 450 °C for 2 h to obtain single-crystal rutile TiO2 NRs. Under the same conditions, Si doped TiO2 NRs were acquired in the presence of TTIP and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS); N doped TiO2 NRs were obtained with TTIP and polyimide (PI) as precursors. For comparison purposes, the TiO2 NRs were synthesized without the addition of TEOS and PI under the same conditions. All the reagents used were of analytical grade and solutions were prepared with DI water.
Characterization
The morphology of all prepared samples was determined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, Netherlands) and the microstructure of the single crystals was further investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F30, Netherlands). The crystalline structure of electrodes was identified through X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, PANalytical B.V. Co., Netherlands) using Cu Kα source radiation. UV-visible absorption spectra of the electrodes were obtained using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan) at room temperature. The elemental compositions were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600 W, Shimadzu) under ultrahigh vacuum (<10−8 Torr) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source operating at 150 W. The survey and high-resolution spectra were collected at fixed analyzer pass energies of 160 and 20 eV, respectively. The binding energy shifts were corrected by using the C 1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard to compensate for the surface-charging effect during data analysis.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC activity was determined by using a standard three-electrode configuration using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 630D, Shanghai Chenhua, China) with 1 M KOH (pH = 13.6) solution as the supporting electrolyte. The photoanode (area = 1 cm2), a SCE and twisted platinum wire acted as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. High-purity N2 was purged into the three-electrode cell for 30 min to remove O2 before the illumination. A 300 W xenon lamp (Newport, model 69911, USA), calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a silicon diode, was used as the light source which is coupled with an AM 1.5G filter. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the dark and under light illumination. The stability test was evaluated under light irradiation at a fixed potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. The monochromatic IPCE was calculated from chronoamperometry measurements at a fixed potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE using a motorized monochromator (Newport, model 70356, USA). Gas chromatography (Shimadzu, TCD/FID, Ar carrier) was used to verify the composition of evolution bubbles both on the photoanode and counter electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under similar conditions to those described above. The impedance versus frequency spectra were recorded at open circuit potential over the frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz, with an AC voltage magnitude of 10 mV amplitude. The carrier density (Nd) was determined by using the Mott–Schottky measurements at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz.
Results and discussion
The N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR film was synthesized directly onto the FTO substrate using a modified hydrothermal method.25Fig. 1 shows the SEM and TEM images of the TiO2 NR and co-doped TiO2 NR samples. The diameter of the TiO2 NRs (Fig. 1a) is in the range of 75–220 nm. The N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs show an average diameter of 150 nm with a length of about 2.2 μm (Fig. 1b and c). The sample exhibits a nearly rectangular cross-section (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d and e present the high-resolution TEM images of the TiO2 NRs and N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs, respectively. The synthesized samples are single crystalline, which can be confirmed by the corresponding fast-Fourier-transform pattern as shown in the insets of Fig. 1d and e, respectively. The clear lattice fringes in Fig. 1d confirm the d values of the (110) and (101) planes to be 0.325 and 0.254 nm for the tetragonal rutile TiO2, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction pattern in the inset of Fig. 1e shows a set of sharp spots and further suggests the high crystallinity of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs. The d-space values for the (110) and (101) planes increase to 0.335 nm and 0.262 nm, respectively, which indicates that the N and Si dopants have been successfully introduced into the TiO2 NRs.28 This result agrees well with the X-ray diffraction pattern for the doped TiO2 NRs (Fig. 1f). The relatively intense diffraction peak at 36.1° corresponding to the (101) plane indicates a preferential orientation growth along the c-axis. Therefore, charge transfer could be improved by providing a conductive pathway through TiO2 NRs for electrons to reach the substrate and thus increased charge separation, which is beneficial for PEC water splitting.

The N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR sample is pale yellow, which is different from the TiO2 NRs (white), indicating an extended absorption into the visible range by the N/Si co-doping (Fig. S1†). This is further confirmed by the UV-visible spectroscopy measurement (Fig. 2) of the TiO2 NR, N doped TiO2 NR, Si doped TiO2 NR and N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR samples. The N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR sample has an extended absorption in the range of 400 to 600 nm with strong absorbance. The significant absorption both in ultraviolet and visible regions is caused by the doping. The red shift of absorbance for the N/Si co-doped TiO2 sample could be attributed to the synergistic effects of N and Si codopants.

The optimum monodoped and co-doped TiO2 NR photoanodes were separately characterized and investigated for photoelectrochemical performance. By varying the percentage of Si and N precursor solution, the highest photocurrent was first determined for the Si and N mono-doped TiO2 NRs. As shown in Fig. S3a and S3b,† the highest photocurrent was found for the N or Si doped TiO2 NR electrode with a Ti/N ratio of 3.03% or a Ti/Si ratio of 5%, respectively. In the case of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs (Fig. S3c†), the photocurrent density reached the maximum with an N/Si ratio of 0.8%. The effect of the hydrothermal reaction time on the PEC performance was also investigated (Fig. S3d†), and the highest PEC performance of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs was achieved at 12 h.

Fig. 3a shows the representative chopped-light current density versus potential curves for various photoanodes with alternating 2 s light on–off cycles. The test was performed under simulated solar light (xenon lamp, 100 mW cm−2). The N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR electrode showed an abrupt increase of performance with the onset potential of 0.15 V vs. RHE and a saturated photocurrent after 1.0 V vs. RHE. Under the same conditions, the photocurrent of the TiO2 NR electrode increased more slowly and no saturated photocurrent was observed even in a high applied bias regime. The N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR photoanode generated a photocurrent density of 1.77 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was enhanced by a factor of 4.4, 2.3, and 1.7 compared to the TiO2 NR, N doped, or Si doped TiO2 NR electrodes, respectively. The attainment of a saturated photocurrent with a very steep rise at low over-potential for the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR electrode indicates the efficient charge carrier transfer and the suppressed surface charge recombination. Recently, high performance PEC systems based on photoanodes using hierarchical TiO2 nanotubes29 or hierarchical TiO2 nanostructured arrays composed of core–shell structures30 have been reported. These photoanodes showed high photocurrent densities of 1.59 mA cm−2 and 2.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively. These values are higher than that in the present work, in which the TiO2 nanorods are used. This comparison indicates that the performance of co-doped TiO2 nanostructured electrodes can be further improved by tuning their morphology.

(d) Nyquist plots of all photoanodes collected at open circuit potential under light illumination. 
The stability of the TiO2 NRs and co-doped TiO2 NRs was evaluated by measuring the photocurrent–time (I–t) response. As shown in Fig. 3b, the photocurrent density of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR electrode (red, solid line) showed ignorable decay after 1800 s illumination. This is much better than the TiO2 NR electrode (black, solid line). This stability test was repeated several times and the results were found to be reproducible. Moreover, gas chromatography (GC) analysis demonstrated that the evolution gas was composed of H2 and O2, indicating that no other reaction happened during the water splitting.
IPCE measurements of various photoanodes were performed with a three-electrode system at 1.23 V vs. RHE illuminated from a 300 W xenon lamp and a monochromator. The IPCE values were calculated using the following equation: (1)where Jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), P(λ) is the incident-light power density for each wavelength (mW cm−2), and λ is the incident-light wavelength (nm). As shown in Fig. 3c, the photoactivity improvement of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs within the visible spectrum region is clearly evidenced in comparison to the TiO2 NRs. The N/Si codoped TiO2 NRs show a noticeable IPCE response in the visible-light region (400–600 nm), which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectrum. The IPCE values decreased from 10.7% at 590 nm to 5.7% at 620 nm for the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs.
To gain an in-depth understanding of the electrical properties and the charge transfer process at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, the EIS measurement was carried out at open circuit under illumination (xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. 3d presents the typical Nyquist plots for various photoanodes. We have fitted the EIS data with a two series RC circuit with Warburg diffusion impedance as shown in Fig. S6.† As the frequency increases, there are several elements in the equivalent circuit model corresponding to the ionic diffusion in the electrolyte, the charge transfer process at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, and the charge transport process in the depleted layer of the bulk TiO2.31,32 For better fitting, all capacitor elements were replaced by constant phase elements that, in any case, maintain the constant phase element (CPE) exponent p quite close to the perfect capacitor value, p ≈ 1. The reaction taking place at the photoanode, i.e., water oxidation at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, can be ascribed to a charge transfer resistance and a double layer capacitance. A decrease of the charge transfer resistance indicates a fast interfacial charge transfer process. Obviously, the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR electrode exhibits the smallest charge transfer resistance among the four samples (Table S1†). This result is consistent with the PEC measurements, showing that the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR sample has the best PEC water splitting performance. Fig. S7† presents the Mott–Schottky plots of the bare, monodoped and codoped TiO2 samples. Therefore, the carrier density (Nd) values can be calculated (see Table S2†). The N/Si codoped TiO2 NR electrode has a higher value of Nd than the bare and monodoped TiO2 NR electrodes, indicating that the codoping process improves the charge conductivity.

Fig. 4 shows the XPS characterization for different samples. In the TiO2 NR sample, the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks are centered at 458.6 eV and 464.4 eV (Fig. 4a).15 A slight positive shift in the binding energy (BE) for the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks was observed in the Si doped and N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR samples. This is attributed to the substitution of Ti atoms with Si atoms that results in a shift of the electron density from Ti to Si (1.54 vs. 1.90 in Pauling units). Fig. 4b compares the O 1s peaks for all samples. In the TiO2 NRs, the peak at 529.9 eV with a shoulder peak at 531.6 eV corresponds to the lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl oxygen atoms, respectively. A small positive shift of the BE of O 1s in Si doped and N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs further confirms the substitution of Ti atoms with Si atoms. Fig. 4c shows the Si 2p peaks of Si doped and N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs at 101.7 eV and 102.3 eV, respectively. Compared to the reported value of 103.4 eV for Si 2p in SiO2,33 a lower BE was observed in both samples, indicating that no SiO2 existed in Si doped and N/Si co-doped samples. This phenomenon together with the positive peak shift of the BE of Ti 2p and O 1s for the Si doped TiO2 NRs and N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs could be the evidence of the formation of the Ti–O–Si bond in the samples. Fig. 4d presents the XPS peaks for the N 1s band. It is acknowledged that the BE of the substitutional N and interstitial N is assigned to 396 and 400 eV, respectively.34 The N 1s band for the N doped and N/Si codoped TiO2 NRs centers at around 400 eV, indicating that N is incorporated into the interstitial site and directly bound to the lattice oxygen (Ti–O–N). This is consistent with the slight positive shift of the BE of Ti 2p in the N doped TiO2 NRs compared to the N/Si codoped TiO2 NRs as shown in Fig. 4a. Peng et al. reported that both the substitutional N-doping and interstitial N doping could enhance the photoactivity of TiO2 in visible light, and the interstitial N doped TiO2 presented the highest performance.33
 Fig. 4  The XPS peaks of Ti 2p (a), O 1s (b), Si 2p (c), and N 1s (d) for mono-doped and co-doped TiO2 NRs. 
Based on the observation of the N 1s and Si 2p XPS spectra of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs, the augmented catalytic activity can be ascribed to the formation of the Ti–O–Si bond and the low electronegative N atoms and the interstitial site, which leads to a lower electron density around Ti4+ than that of the TiO2 NRs.33 As indicated in Fig. 4c, the N/Si co-doping changes the density of the hydroxyl group on the TiO2 surface as well, which can be directly evaluated with the contact angle measurement. The contact angle for the Si doped TiO2 NRs and N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs becomes smaller than that of the TiO2 NRs (Fig. S2†). Therefore, the attached hydroxyl groups onto the electrode surface could be helpful for trapping the photo-generated holes and the formation of OH radicals to carry out water oxidation at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.35 As a result, the photocatalytic activity of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs film can be enhanced.
Herein, the solar-powered photo-electrochemical water splitting with the TiO2 NRs-based PEC system was tested with the aid of a CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) and showed an appreciable performance. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curve of the PSC device tested under AM 1.5G simulated irradiation (100 mW cm−2) is shown in Fig. S4a.† It was found that the device displayed a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.55 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.956 V, achieving a PCE of 10.26%. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PSC device reached a broad maximum at 400 nm remaining at a level over 50% up to 750 nm (Fig. S4b†). The appearance of an IPCE plateau indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3 embedded in the mesoporous TiO2 film harvests efficiently the incident photons, converting them with a high quantum yield to electric current.36 When combining with the PEC cell, the PSC cell could provide the necessary potential to drive the water-splitting reaction as indicated in Fig. 5a. In this measurement, the perovskite solar cell was series connected to the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR photoanode of the photoelectrochemical cell. Both devices were exposed to the incident irradiation. The obtained photocurrent density for the PSC + N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR PEC system was nearly 5 times higher than that of without doping. Gas evolution was clearly observed on the surface of the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs and Pt electrode (Fig. S5†). The stability of the PSC + N/Si co-doped TiO2 NRs was also tested. As shown in Fig. 5b, the photocurrent of the PSC/PEC combined device was maintained constantly even after 2400 s illumination. Fig. S8a and S8b† present the amount of evolved H2 as a function of operation time, and the net photocurrent obtained during the gas measurement. The amount of H2 is close to the theoretical amount calculated by the integration of the photocurrent over time for hydrogen evolution (two-electron process). The Faradic efficiency was evaluated to be 98% and 86.4% for the PSC + N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR and the PSC + TiO2 NR devices, respectively. The overall STH efficiency of the PSC + N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR electrode system was calculated to be 1.1%, which was 5.7 times higher than that of the PSC + TiO2 NR PEC system. The high efficiency could contribute to the performance of the perovskite solar cell with a high output photovoltage.

Conclusions
In summary, the N/Si co-doped single crystal rutile TiO2 nanorods had been successfully fabricated by a hydrothermal method. The N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR photoanode displays a high photocurrent density (1.77 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), coupled with a better stability and high visible light response. It is clear that the increased absorption in the ultraviolet and visible light ranges and improved charge transfer at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte are responsible for the improved PEC performance, which is benefited from the synergetic effect of N and Si co-dopants. A STH efficiency of 1.1% can be achieved by assembling an efficient CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cell with the N/Si co-doped TiO2 NR based PEC system.
