High-efficiency organic–inorganic hybrid solar cell Si/PEDOT–PSS with a hierarchical surface, showing a power conversion efficiency of 12%. The structure provides excellent light absorption over 97% for the spectral range of 300 to 1100 nm with a thickness of 60 μm due to internal multiple reflections caused by subwavelength features of high density silicon nanoholes and micro-desert textures. In addition, from the angle of incidence (AOI) observed, even at the large angle of 75°, the reflectance value still exhibits less than 1%. With the advantage of very thin silicon material and inexpensive processing, hybrid silicon/polymer solar cells are promising for various applications and thus could be an economically feasible alternative energy solution in the future.
1. Introduction
A major long-standing concern faced by the world is the problem of global warming due to greenhouse gases, so it creates an ever-increasing global demand for renewable clean energy. An efficient and feasible alternative source of clean renewable energy is solar radiation. Up to nowadays, the majority of commercial solar cells are still dominated by crystalline silicon due to its abundant material resources, non-toxic, and long-term stability. The silicon solar cells manufactured today have a typical thickness above 180 μm, making them bulky and rigid. Therefore, lightweight and flexible cells with trade-off efficiency and robustness are emerging.1 Thin-film, lightweight and flexible solar modules are attractive for roofs and facades of building, automobiles, curved surfaces, and portable electronics.2–5 As a result, the solar industry moves toward decreasing the wafer thickness and utilizing bendable silicon wafers. It is thus of significant interest to develop flexible crystalline silicon wafer for use in modern applications. However, thin crystalline silicon solar cells may suffer from several problems like inadequate light absorption and poor carrier collection.6 Hence, new concepts need to be exploited to address these concerns. In the past few years, silicon nanowires (SiNW), nanoholes (SiNH) and other nanostructures7–10 have become major candidates for the development of silicon solar cells. The incorporation of silicon nanostructures provides broadband anti-reflection and enables efficient light absorption improvement in thin film solar cells.11–14 The nanostructures can also provide excellent light trapping for different incident angles of incidence, which is considered to be essential for sunrise-to-sunset applications.15
On the other hand, conventional processes of Si solar cells normally require high temperature for dopant diffusion or ion implantation and annealing processes. Those steps are expensive and consume lots of energy, so there has been significant interest towards forming hybrid organic–inorganic silicon solar cells using a low temperature process.16–18 The low-cost organic solution deposited on c-Si to form a Schottky junction can replace the expensive methods. Most commonly, a transparent conductive polymer is used for the hole transporting layer, based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS), usually available in aqueous solution and amenable to solution processing.
Recently, hybrid solar cells composed of silicon nanostructures and organic polymers with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% have been developed.19–21 To further improve the efficiency of PCE for hybrid solar cells, a variety of strategies have been applied. Recently, Jeong et al. demonstrated a silicon nanocone hybrid solar cell with a high PCE of 11.1%.22 Nonetheless, this approach requires costly fabrication processes to form silicon nanocones by deep reactive ion etching. Liu et al. reported 11.34% of PCE for planar-Si and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS) with the addition of Zonyl to improve the adhesion on Si wafers.23 The above approach employed a polished silicon surface without utilizing any nanostructures. The nanostructures have been used in solar cells to suppress light reflection, increase the junction area and efficiently collect photo-generated carriers. Nonetheless, the hybrid solar cells developed so far are rigid. By further acclimating a thin flexible template, the organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells will become a very feasible option for future next-generation solar cells.
In this study, we demonstrate a high-efficiency organic–inorganic hybrid solar cell Si/PEDOT–PSS with a hierarchical surface composed of silicon nanoholes and micro-desert textures, showing a power conversion efficiency of 12% which is the highest PCE among all reported Si/organic hybrid solar cells. The hierarchical surface provides excellent light absorption over 97% for the spectral range of 300 to 1100 nm with a thickness of 60 μm due to internal multiple reflections caused by subwavelength features of high density silicon nanoholes and micro-desert textures. At an angle of incidence up to 65°, the reflectance maintains less than 0.7% and at the large angle of 75° the value is still less than 1%. In addition, we made the back surface of flexible-Si as a highly doped n-type layer to reduce the surface recombination rate and decrease contact resistance.
2. Experimental
We chose Czochralski (CZ) 6-inch solar grade n-type single crystalline (100) wafers for this study. We made the back surface of the Si substrate a very highly doped n-type layer through conventional N+ diffusion of phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) gas. The temperature was 850 °C for 30 min and the depth was 0.3 μm, sheet resistance was 80 Ω sq−1. After the diffusion process, we dipped the silicon wafer into BOE for 5 min to remove phosphorus silicate glass (PSG). Flexible crystalline film silicon with micro-desert arrays were developed on silicon wafers by HF/nitric acid/acetic acid (HNA) etching solution. Before that, we needed to protect the back side of Si wafers (N+ layer) with a surface protection layer. The solutions were mixed in the volume ratio 1:3:5 to make the flexible thin wafer. The etching time for obtaining 60 μm thick wafer was 20 min. The desired thickness and surface roughness could be varied by the etching solution concentration ratio and time. The high-density silicon nanoholes were fabricated by a two-step metal assisted etching method. First, the flexible thin wafers were cleaned with de-ionized water (DI water), acetone (ACE), piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2), and isopropanol (IPA) for 5–10 min each. Between each step, the wafer was rinsed with DI water. Afterwards, the backside of the wafers was protected by spin-coated photoresist. Next, the flexible thin wafer was dipped in aqueous solution containing HF (3.71 mol L−1)/AgNO3 (0.004 mol L−1) for 5 s to deposit silver nanoparticles. Then, the silver nanoparticle deposited thin wafer was immersed in aqueous solution containing HF (6.57 mol L−1) and H2O2 (0.18 mol L−1). In this step, the vertically-aligned Si nanoholes were formed by etching the thin wafer. The nanohole depth could be altered by varying the etching time. Finally, the photoresist, silver, and silicon dioxide were removed using acetone, HNO3/H2O = 1:1(v/v), and HF/H2O = 1:1(v/v), respectively. Subsequently, the rear metal electrodes of Ti, 50 nm, and Ag, 250 nm, were deposited on the backside of the flexible thin wafer using an E-gun evaporator.
Solar devices were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates. The substrates were first cleaned with acetone and isopropanol (IPA) for 5–10 min each, and rinsed with DI water between those two steps. Afterwards, PEDOT–PSS solution (Clevios™ PHCV4 Stark GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany) was spin-coated on silicon nanoholes by a two-step coating process and also on ITO to form close contact. Finally, the fabricated devices were annealed under 140 °C for 10 min in the atmosphere.
For current density–voltage characteristic measurement, the devices were illuminated from ITO side under1 sun AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 using solar simulator SUN 2000, Abet Technologies, Inc, and measured using Keithley 2400 source meter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures of silicon nanoholes on the micro-desert textures were observed using LEO 1530 field emission-SEM. The optical reflectance of the thin films with silicon nanoholes was measured using JASCO V-670 UV-Vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere.
3. Results and discussions

Fig. 1 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of flexible crystalline film silicon with hierarchical surfaces composed of micro-desert features and silicon nanoholes, and the heavily doped n-type layer was protected on the back side of the silicon substrate. Fig. 1a shows etched thin wafer films with a bumpy surface like micro-desert texture, the average thickness of the thin Si is 60 μm. The rapid etching wafer led to a texture of a micro-desert with formation of the thin wafer at the same time. Fig. 1b shows that the high density nanohole array on micro-desert surface is homogeneously distributed over a large surface area. The nanohole diameter size is about 25–30 nm with density as high as 7.52 × 1010 per cm2. The density and diameter can be controlled by an etching mask of the silver nanoparticles size and the deposition time. The depth of the high-density silicon nanohole can be controlled and varied with the etching time. Fig. 1c and d show SEM images of the hierarchical surface with silicon nanoholes and micro-desert textures. They were produced with etching time of 25 and 35 s, corresponding to silicon nanoholes with 340 and 480 nm of the averaged depth, respectively. Fig. S1a† show the SEM images of the etched thin wafer films with a bumpy surface and average thickness of 60 μm. Fig. S1b† shows the high flexibility of the single-crystalline-film silicon upon bending.

The detailed fabrication processes of hybrid solar cells using flexible crystalline film silicon with conductive polymer PEDOT–PSS are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. In Fig. 2 the schematic diagram represented forms a thin silicon wafer with thickness of 60 μm, after the diffusion process the back surface was protected. In Fig. 3, high density silicon nanoholes were formed, next the conductive polymer PEDOT–PSS was spin-coated on the hierarchical surface (silicon nanohole/micro-desert) with a two-step coating process to form the hybrid polymer heterojunction solar cell. The rear electrode was formed using evaporated Ti/Ag on the backside of the flexible silicon wafer film. Silicon nanoholes are the leading light absorber due to a light trapping effect and the medium for excited electrons transport, while PEDOT–PSS is a transparent layer which acts as a hole transport and electron blocking layer. To complete the solar cell device, the flexible film silicon with rear electrode was inversely laid on an ITO substrate that was further coated with PEDOT–PSS to make better contact. The film-Si fabrication process and device synthesis are also based on a cost- and energy-efficient solution process. This etching technique can also be made for large scale production and a PEDOT–PSS hole transporting layer is available in aqueous suspension and amenable to solution processing. Alternatively for scalable production the PEDOT–PSS and back electrode can process through screen-printing instead of using E-gun evaporation.

Fig. 4a and b show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of hybrid solar cells with different etching time of silicon nanoholes with and without a heavily doped N+ layer. They were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a power of 100 mW cm−2 derived from a solar simulator and the device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The 25 s etching time for silicon nanoholes on the micro-desert textured surface without N+ layer shows Voc of 0.5 V, Jsc of 33.42 mA cm−2, FF of 61.9%, and PCE of 10.35%. After employing the N+ layer at the backside of wafer, the cell shows an improved performance of Jsc 36.81 mA cm−2, FF of 66.3%, and PCE of 12.00%. This high performance is due to inserting a heavily doped N+ layer at the back surface, decreasing the series resistance from 2.32 to 1.64 Ω·cm2, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4b. The heavily doped layer reduces not only the contact resistance but also the recombination rate due to a built-in electric field on the backside that deflects the minority carriers. With improvements of the Jsc and FF, we achieved an efficiency of 12% from the hybrid film-silicon/PEDOT–PSS heterojunction solar cells. The optimal depth of high-density silicon nanohole with conformal polymer coverage into the nanohole via the spin-coating method provides excellent light trapping properties and a higher junction area. Fig. 4c displays an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25 s etching time for silicon nanoholes on the micro-desert textured surface with and without N+ layer. Obviously, the improvement in the device performance can be attributed to introducing of N+ layer at the back surface. The EQE improved markedly in the visible and near infra-red region (>700 nm) for the N+ layer as compared to that without N+ layer. The EQE of the N+ layer device has 80% of EQE at 480 nm and a large improvement at longer wavelengths, but the EQE without N+ layer device decreases from 650 to 1000 nm. The improvement in the EQE spectra is owing to the reduction of recombination rate at the back surface and deflects minority carriers effectively.

Fig. 4a shows J–V curves with different etching times of silicon nanoholes that correspond to three depths of 270, 340, and 480 nm, respectively. The 25 s etched silicon nanoholes for 340 nm depth give the best performance among all the devices. Silicon nanoholes with a longer depth have more surface states and poor infiltration of PEDOT–PSS, resulting in poor performance. The detailed effect had been studied previously.24Fig. 5 shows an energy band diagram for ITO/PEDOT–PSS/n-Si/Ti/Ag with and without N+ layer. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for PEDOT–PSS is around 5.1 eV, which is similar to the valence band energy of n-Si. Here the organic material PEDOT–PSS forms a Schottky junction with silicon. Also the PEDOT–PSS can be a barrier for electron transport at the interface. The photogenerated holes in silicon nanoholes move toward PEDOT–PSS and photogenerated electrons move along the silicon nanoholes toward the back surface metal contact, as shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows that the back surface typically has large density of surface traps. The minority carrier of holes in the n-type silicon at the back surface could recombine with electrons via those traps. To avoid this problem, we made the back surface with a heavily doped n-type layer, creating a back-surface field, as shown in Fig. 5c. In Fig. 5c, the minority carriers in n-type silicon, holes, get repelled at the back surface due to the heavily doped N+ layer and effectively reduces the recombination rate at the back surface. The substantial improvement of high Jsc is obtained due to the strong light trapping effect caused by the hierarchical surface of silicon nanoholes on a micro-desert textured surface with a heavily doped n-type layer. The optical property study was performed to characterize the light-harvesting behaviour. Fig. 6a shows the absorption spectra for different depths of silicon nanoholes with a micro-desert textured surface in the wavelength range from 300 to 1100 nm. The average absorption is achieved over 97% for an etching time of 35 s with thickness 60 μm flexible silicon film. For etching time less than 35 s, the average absorption is over 94%. With a thickness of 60 μm for regular thin silicon, the near-infrared region (1000–1100 nm of wavelength) can usually penetrate through. However, with high-density silicon nanoholes and a micro-desert textured surface, the transmission is low due to the excellent light trapping effect. The absorption spectra were deduced from Fig. 6b and c, which show the total reflectance and transmittance measurement for different depths of the silicon nanoholes. The reflectance is extremely low in the spectral window between 300 and 1100 nm. When the etching time increases, reflectance is further suppressed because the silicon nanoholes are deeper. In addition, for all depths of the silicon nanoholes in the thin wafer, the transmittance has an average value of 0.02%, as shown in Fig. 6c. It is imperative to have omnidirectional light harvesting in the entire AOI light, which is essential for solar cells. One of the exclusive characteristics of the nanostructures is the efficient light trapping occurring irrespective of the angle of incidence. The performance of the hierarchal surface shows significant low reflectance at almost any angle. Fig. 6d shows that a wide range of AOI is observed in the wide range of wavelength for the etching time of 35 s. Fig. 6d clearly shows that the hierarchical surface with silicon nanoholes and a micro-desert textured surface can achieve omnidirectionality and extremely low reflectance in the wide range of AOI and wavelength. At an angle of incidence up to 65°, the reflectance stays less than 0.7% and at the large angle of 75° the value is still less than 1%. This remarkable property indicates that a flexible thin wafer with a hierarchical surface is ideal for hybrid solar cells in terms of light trapping, anti-reflection properties, and efficient carrier collection.

Table 2 summarizes the up-to-date reported hybrid solar cells based on Si nanostructures and microstructures. Our nanohole/micro-desert textured hybrid solar cell has a competitive highest PCE of 12% and the highest Jsc of 36.81 mA cm−2 to date. Compared with other nanostructures, silicon nanoholes give higher Jsc due to excellent light trapping effect.25 In addition to the light harvesting behaviour, the reduced recombination rate due to a built-in electric field on the backside and decreases in the contact resistance are also of help.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate a high-efficiency hybrid Si nanohole and micro-desert/polymer PEDOT–PSS solar cells with power conversion of 12%, which is the highest among Si/organic hybrid solar cells to our knowledge. PEDOT–PSS/Si hybrid solar cells exhibit high Jsc of 36.81 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.492 V, FF of 66.3%, and PCE of 12.00%. The hierarchical surface provides excellent light harvesting due to internal multiple reflections. It has high absorption over 97% for the spectral range of 300 nm to 1100 nm with a thickness of 60 μm. For the AOI, at an angle of incidence up to 65°, the reflectance value stays less than 0.7% and at the large angle of 75° the value is still less than 1%. This hierarchical surface with silicon nanoholes and micro-desert is well suitable for high-efficiency hybrid solar cells.
