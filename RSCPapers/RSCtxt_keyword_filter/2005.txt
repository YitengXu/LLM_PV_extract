, Accepted 4th July 2023First published on 5th July 2023AbstractAniline was introduced into a solution of tin halide perovskite precursor to interact with formamidinium iodide (FAI) through hydrogen bonding, which optimized the crystal orientation of the tin halide perovskite and contributed to the charge transport and structural stabilization. The lead-free tin halide perovskite solar cells achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.04% together with a high open-circuit voltage of 788 mV.
As one of the most promising lead-free analogues, tin halide perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have obtained massive research interest and achieved a record PCE of 14.81%,1 but mainly suffered from fast crystallization,2,3 high open-circuit voltage (Voc) deficit,4 and easy oxidation.5 It has been well recognized that the film quality of the perovskite layer is a critical factor determining the PCE of TPSCs. So far, many methods have been proposed to improve the quality of perovskite films, such as solvent engineering,6 additive engineering,7,8 component regulation,9–11 fabrication technology optimization,12,13 and so on.
In terms of additives to the precursor solution, there have been many examples of solid additives to enhance the perovskite film quality and promote the PCE. For instance, Han et al.14 added poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to interact with formamidinium iodide (FAI) to retard the crystal growth and suppress iodine migration. Yang et al.15 incorporated piperazine to lower the energy barrier for nucleation, thus obtaining high quality perovskite films. However, residual solid additives tended to be presented at the perovskite surface or grain boundaries, which limited the device photovoltaic performance.16,17 Cao et al.18 reported that the presence of a Lewis base, like thiourea, could remain on the film surface after annealing and increase the charge recombination at the interface. In this regard, liquid additives such as acetic acid,19 formic acid,20 etc. are widely used since they can be removed during the annealing process.
Hydrogen bonding, as an effective pathway for regulating the coordination chemistry of precursor solutions, is often applied in the deposition of perovskite thin films. For instance, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate (DPPA) was introduced into the precursor solution to interact with FAI through –OH⋯I− hydrogen bonding to inhibit the I− migration.21 Moreover, Zhou et al.22 incorporated sulfonyl, 3-ethylbenzo[d]isothiazole 1,1-dioxide (PSAD) to generate chemical interaction. The hydrogen bonding of FAI and methylammonium iodide (MAI) with PSAD not only retarded the perovskite crystal growth but also induced the vertical grain orientation, resulting in decreased defect density and facilitated carrier transport of the TPSCs.
Herein, we introduced aniline, a type of liquid additive, into the tin perovskite of FA0.75MA0.25SnI2.75Br0.25. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been performed to probe the hydrogen bonding between aniline and formamidinium iodide (FAI). Furthermore, such hydrogen bonding could optimize the orientation of FAI, and regulate the crystallization process of the perovskite film. The obtained high-quality perovskite film exhibited relaxed microstrain, stabilized structure, and reduced energy disorder. Consequently, the PCE of TPSCs with aniline was increased from 10.34% to 12.04%, together with a Voc enhancement from 757 mV to 788 mV. In addition, the aniline device maintained 90% of the initial PCE in a N2 atmosphere for 1440 h and 81% of the initial PCE in air conditions (RH ∼ 70%, without encapsulation) for 24 h.
First, we noticed that when aniline was spin-coated directly on the tin perovskite film, the black phase was immediately dissolved (Fig. S1, ESI†). Meanwhile, aniline cannot dissolve SnI2 even after stirring overnight (Fig. S2, ESI†). The poor solubility of SnI2 indicated a very weak interaction between aniline and SnI2. Therefore, aniline is able to interact with other components in the precursor solution. As demonstrated in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. 1a and b), compared with pure FAI, the ν(N–H) at 3352 cm−1 downshifted to 3346 cm−1, and the ν(C–N) + δ(NH2) at 1705 cm−1 downshifted to 1683 cm−1, with aniline introduction.23,24 Moreover, the N–H of aniline downshifted from 1621 cm−1 and 1601 cm−1 to 1615 cm−1 and 1596 cm−1, respectively, after FAI addition. Furthermore, Park et al.25 have shown that aniline does not interact with MABr. Consequently, the aniline introduced into the precursor solution just interacted with FAI through hydrogen bonding.

Then, the FAI solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate to check the crystallization behaviour. Before annealing (Fig. 1c), the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak intensity of FAI was significantly improved with aniline, especially at 26.04°, which implied an optimized crystalline orientation of the FAI crystals. With the removal of aniline after annealing (Fig. 1d), the high crystalline intensity remained. The optimized orientation of FAI may be associated with the hydrogen bonding formation. Simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 1e, the perovskite film fabricated with aniline exhibited a more distinct diffraction intensity variation before and after annealing, compared with the control film, manifesting the retarded crystal growth of the aniline film.26 In Fig. S3 (ESI†), the XRD patterns of the control (without aniline) and with aniline films exhibited similar characteristic peaks at 14.28°, which corresponds to the (100) crystal plane. And the peaks at 28.56°, and 43.30° were related to the (200) and (300) crystal plane, respectively. The perovskite film with aniline showed an enhanced crystalline intensity perpendicular to the substrate. The vertical growth of the perovskite crystals helps to optimize the carrier transfer in PSCs.27 Impressively, the microstrain was reduced apparently with aniline (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†). The relaxation of microstrain is beneficial to the structure stability of perovskite crystals.28 Moreover, the decreased microstrain implied a lower defect concentration.29 Furthermore, SEM was conducted to estimate the perovskite film quality (Fig. S5, ESI†). With the addition of aniline, the perovskite film displayed a flatter and smoother surface morphology without pinholes. In addition, the integrity and crystallization orientation were improved with aniline optimization. Improved film quality indicates reduced defect density and contributes to better photovoltaic performance.
As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the perovskite film fabricated with aniline showed a slightly improved absorption capability. Subsequently, the Urbach energy was calculated from the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectral data (Fig. 2a). The perovskite film with aniline demonstrated a reduced Urbach energy of 64.77 meV, compared with the control film (77.82 meV). The declined Urbach energy indicated that the aniline perovskite film displayed suppressed energy disorder and lower defect density. Generally, the decline of Urbach energy contributes to the improvement of Voc in PSCs.30,31 As shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S7 (ESI†), with the change of light intensity, the film with aniline maintained a much higher carrier mobility compared with the control film. Furthermore, to evaluate the trap density in the perovskite film, the electron-only and hole-only devices were adopted in space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement (Fig. 2c and Fig. S8, ESI†). The VTFL in the electron-only devices decreased from 1.34 V of the control device to 0.98 V of the aniline device, resulting in the reduction of the trap density from 1.30 × 1016 cm−3 to 9.48 × 1015 cm−3. Meanwhile, in the hole-only device, the VTFL was also reduced (from 0.19 V to 0.09 V) with the addition of aniline. And the corresponding trap density was decreased from 1.84 × 1015 cm−3 to 0.87 × 1015 cm−3. The reduction of defect density was attributed to the optimization of the crystal growth orientation, which is beneficial to inhibit the non-radiative recombination.32 In Fig. S9 (ESI†), the perovskite film with aniline exhibited stronger PL intensity compared with the control film. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 2d and Table S2 (ESI†), the fitted average carrier lifetime of 6.99 ns and 13.52 ns corresponded to the control and aniline films, separately. The incorporation of aniline almost doubled the carrier lifetime. Therefore, aniline optimized the orientation of the perovskite crystals, and the orientation perpendicular to the substrate helped the carriers move toward the electron and hole transport layers, respectively. Superior charge transport together with less defect-induced recombination resulted in the extension of the carrier lifetime.

Thereafter, the inverted structure of TPSCs was fabricated (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA0.75MA0.25SnI2.75Br0.25/C60-ETPA33/BCP/Ag) (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b and Table S3 (ESI†), the aniline device exhibited a PCE of 12.04% in forward scanning, which was substantially higher than that of 10.34% without aniline addition. In particular, the Voc was boosted to some degree, primally owing to the minimization of energy disorder and non-radiative recombination. The related external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement results are shown in Fig. 3c. The control device obtained an integrated current density of 19.40 mA cm−2 and the value of 20.60 mA cm−2 was for the aniline device. As shown in Fig. 3d, the steady-state power output was tested under a biased voltage of 630 mV (control) and 660 mV (aniline), respectively. The aniline device displayed a higher and more stable PCE than the control device. The distribution chart of PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF are summarized and presented in Fig. 3e, f and Fig. S10 (ESI†), which further confirmed the good reproducibility and overall PCE and Voc promotion with aniline. Furthermore, the stability of the TPSCs was tracked and recorded in a N2 atmosphere and in air, separately (Fig. S11, ESI†). After being stored in a N2 glove box for 1440 h, the aniline device maintained 90% of the initial PCE, compared with 81% retention of the control device. Meanwhile, when exposed in air (RH ∼ 70%, without encapsulation) for 24 h, the aniline device kept 81% PCE. The promotion of the device stability is mainly attributed to the stabilized perovskite structure with the relaxation of microstrain and the decreased defect density.

Subsequently, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurement and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement were conducted to investigate the density of the midgap defect state (DOS) in the perovskite thin film (Fig. S12 and Table S4 and S5, ESI†). In Fig. S13 (ESI†), a much lower DOS in the perovskite film with aniline illustrated the reduced defect state in the bandgap, which was consistent with the Voc improvement depicted in the J–V curves. Furthermore, the aniline device demonstrated a lower leakage current owning to the suppressed recombination and efficient carrier extraction and transport (Fig. S14, ESI†).34 In addition, the greatly increased Vbi from 632 mV to 708 mV manifested better charge separation and collection, which contributed to the high Voc (Fig. S15, ESI†).15 Likewise, as shown in the electrical impedance spectra (Fig. S16, ESI†), the aniline device showed a larger charge recombination resistance (Rrec) of 17.90 kΩ, compared with the Rrec of 4.02 kΩ of the control device. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†), the transient photovoltage decay (TPV) lifetime was extended from 3.77 μs to 13.49 μs for the aniline device. The slower TPV decay further validated the decrease of defect concentration and promotion of charge transport. Fig. S18 (ESI†) depicts the light-dependence of Voc for the control and aniline devices. The slope of the fitted curves decreased from 1.71kT/q (control) to 1.40kT/q (aniline), validating the reduction of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in the TPSCs.35
In summary, we demonstrated a convenient liquid solvent additive of aniline to form hydrogen bonding with FAI and manipulate the perovskite crystal growth along the vertical direction. It has been revealed that the introduction of aniline optimized the crystal orientation and stabilized the structure of the perovskite, thus improving the film quality and diminishing the microstrain in the crystal lattice. The high film quality was reflected in the reduction of energy disorder, the decrease of trap concentration and excellent carrier transport performance. Therefore, the aniline film exhibited a prolonged carrier lifetime with suppressed non-radiative recombination. Ultimately, the TPSCs achieved a PCE of 12.04% with a high Voc of 788 mV. Moreover, the aniline device maintained 90% PCE under 1440 h storage in a N2 atmosphere and kept 81% PCE in air (RH ∼ 70%) for 24 h without encapsulation. Therefore, aniline, as an efficient liquid additive, provides a feasible strategy to regulate the tin halide perovskite crystallization by hydrogen bonding for efficient TPSCs.
