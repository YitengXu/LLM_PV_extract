    , Accepted 9th March 2016First published on 9th March 2016AbstractHere a series of isoindigo (ID) and quaterthiophene (T4)-based donor–acceptor copolymers are synthesized and compared. The polymer with fluorination on the donor unit exhibits the strongest extent of temperature-dependent aggregation, which leads to a higher hole mobility of the polymer and PSCs with efficiencies up to 7.0% without using any processing additives. Our results provide important insights into how fluorination affects the aggregation properties and performance of isoindigo-based polymers.
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained tremendous momentum in both academia and industry due to the benefits of light-weight, low-cost and mechanical flexibility.1–4 The past twenty years have witnessed great progress in the field of PSCs since the introduction of bulk heterojunction (BHJ).5 The advancement of the PSC field has benefited from the developments of new conjugated polymers based on various electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units. By using such a D–A copolymer strategy, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers along with their optical properties can be readily tuned with the combination of different D and A moieties.6–8 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded the 10% threshold for single-junction PSCs9–13 and are expected to reach even higher values for tandem PSC devices.14,15 Nevertheless, developing novel conjugated polymers with low optical band-gaps is still a great challenge.
Owing to its strong electron withdrawing ability and planar backbone, isoindigo (ID) has been shown to be a useful acceptor block that was used to construct conjugated copolymers yielding high-performance organic thin-film transistors.16–18 Moreover, ID-based polymers exhibit strong absorption across the visible light region, high extinction coefficients and deep HOMO energy levels, which makes ID one of the most promising electron-deficient building blocks for constructing D–A type polymers toward high performance PSCs.19–23 To date, the majority of efforts to study the halogenation effect on ID-based D–A copolymers have been focused on fluorinating the A unit22–25 or introducing large-size chlorine into polymer backbones.26 It was found that the fluorinated ID-based polymers work well when matched with specific D units22–24 and a PCE of ∼8.0% was achieved using a five-ring-fused aromatic unit (dithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole (DTC)) as the D unit.22 In addition, the weak F–S interaction introduced by the fluorine atoms on the A unit resulted in a more rigid polymer backbone conformation and thus higher hole mobility,16,22 while the effect of fluorination on the D moiety is not known.
In this work, conjugated polymers with fluorine atoms on the donor (quaterthiophene, T4) or acceptor (ID) unit are synthesized and compared to investigate the relationship between the fluorination position and photovoltaic properties. It was found that the fluorination on the T4 unit introduced the most dramatic improvement in the device performance. With PC71BM as the acceptor, PSCs based on the polymer with the fluorinated D unit delivered a high PCE up to 7.0%, which is much higher than the best value of 4.8% achievable with fluorination on the A unit. The polymer with fluorination on the D unit exhibits the strongest extent of temperature dependent aggregation properties in solution among the three polymers, leading to high polymer crystallinity, hole mobility and higher domain purity which have an overall beneficial effect and lead to enhanced PSC performance.
The synthesis routes and structures of PID-T4, PID-ffT4 and PffID-T4 are illustrated in Scheme 1 and the synthesis of monomers is described in the ESI.† To ensure good solubility and processibility of the polymers, the 2nd position branched alkyl chains (2OD) are attached to the thieophene rings as such functionalization was shown to be the key structural feature that enables the highly temperature-dependent aggregation properties of the polymers. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) along with the polydispersity index (PDI) were found to be 55.9 kDa and 1.6 for PID-T4, 52.4 kDa and 1.5 for PID-ffT4, 48.6 kDa and 1.6 for PffID-T4, respectively, as measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with a refractive index detector at 135 °C, in which 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was used as an eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The three polymers have sufficiently high molecular weight to avoid any negative effects of low molecular weights on the device performances. The polymers showed dramatically different solubilities despite their comparable molecular weights. The PID-T4 polymer can be dissolved in chloroform, while the PffID-T4 polymer can be dissolved in toluene but not in chloroform and the PID-ffT4 polymer can only be dissolved in hot chlorobenzene. To understand the effect of fluorination on polymer solubility, density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. S5†) were carried out to obtain the relative energy profile of the polymer units. It is clear that the ffT2 unit exhibits a large energy difference (∼10 kJ mol−1) in favor of the planar conformation, while there is no strong conformation lock for the case of PffID-T4.27 This can explain why PID-ffT4 exhibits a stronger extent of aggregation than PffID-T4. It was also reported that the introduction of fluorine atoms could decrease the torsional angle, which enables a more planar backbone conformation,16,28–30 moreover, the weak attractive C–F⋯H, F⋯S and C–F⋯πF interactions22,31,32 introduced by the fluorine atoms may also improve the intermolecular interaction of polymers and enhance the molecular ordering, which has an overall effect and leads to the decreased solubility.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic procedures of PID-T4, PID-ffT4 and PffID-T4. 
The temperature-dependent aggregation properties of the three polymers in solution were studied by comparing their UV-vis spectra at different temperatures. For PID-T4, the onset and peak of the absorption spectra red-shifted by about 75 and 50 nm, respectively, when the solution is cooled from 95 °C to 25 °C and the shape of the spectra remains the same during the cooling process. The extent of the red-shift is slightly more (about 10 nm) for the PffID-T4 polymer solution due to the fluorination effect. However, the temperature dependent aggregation properties of PID-ffT4 are significantly different. The absorption onset of PID-ffT4 red-shifted about 95 nm. More importantly, an additional absorption peak appears at 750 nm (as shown in Fig. 1b), which indicates strong polymer aggregation in solution at low temperatures. We refer to this additional absorption feature as “aggregation peak”, which has been shown to be directly correlated with polymer aggregation in solution and polymer crystallinity in the film.10,33,34 The appearance of the aggregation peak during the solution cooling process shows that the aggregation of the PID-ffT4 polymer is significantly stronger than the other two. Also, it is interesting to note that the absorption spectrum of PID-ffT4 in solution at room temperature has a similar onset wavelength to its film absorption. In contrast, the film absorption spectra are significantly red-shifted compared to the spectrum of the 25 °C solution for the other two polymers.

The frontier orbital energy levels of the polymers are measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S2,† the measured HOMO levels of PID-4T, PID-ffT4 and PffID-4T are −5.28, −5.40 and −5.38 eV, respectively, indicating that the introduction of fluorine atoms effectively lowers the HOMO levels of the copolymers. Consequently, the PID-ffT4 polymer based devices are expected to exhibit higher VOC, which is generally determined by the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor.35,36
PSCs were fabricated with an inverted device structure with a sequence of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/V2O5/Al. The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are presented in Fig. 2a and the performance parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table 1. The results show that both the fluorinated polymers (PID-ffT4 and PffID-T4) deliver higher JSC and FF than the non-fluorinated polymer. Compared to the fluorination on the acceptor moieties, the introduction of fluorine atoms onto the donor unit in the conjugated polymers appears to be a more effective strategy for ID-T4 polymers. Notably, the high performance of the PID-ffT4:PC71BM devices was achieved without using any additives during the active layer processing. It is well known that the presence of DIO, a poor solvent for the polymers, can enhance the aggregation of PID-T4 and PffID-T4 and thus improve their performance.37,38 Herein, as PID-ffT4 exhibits strong temperature-dependent aggregation, it can achieve high polymer crystallinity and great PSC performance without using the DIO additive. The results clearly show the beneficial effects of fluorination on the donor unit for D–A polymers.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is employed to study the morphology of the polymer:fullerene blends. As shown in Fig. S1,† the AFM image of the PID-T4:PC71BM blend shows a relatively large surface feature of ∼60 nm, which may contribute to the lower EQE values of the devices. The blend films of PID-ffT4:PC71BM (Fig. S1b†) and PffID-ffT4:PC71BM (Fig. S1c†) show smoother surfaces with no surface features larger than 50 nm. In addition, grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis was also performed. As shown in Fig. 3, all blend films exhibit preferentially face-on orientations relative to the substrate, as the (010) diffraction peaks (corresponding to the π–π stacking) appear on the qz axis. The PID-ffT4:PC71BM blend film shows a peak at q = 1.77 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, indicating a π–π stacking distance of 3.54 Å, which is slightly smaller than that of PffID-T4 (3.60 Å) and PID-T4 (3.64 Å). Most importantly, the (010) coherence length (CL) of the blend films was found to be about 10.0 nm for the PID-ffT4:PC71BM blend, which is the largest among the three polymers. In comparison, the (010) CLs of PffID-T4 and PID-T4 blend films are 7.8 nm and 5.7 nm, respectively. The lamellar d spacings of PID-T4, PID-ffT4 and PffID-T4 based films are quite comparable (21.4, 21.9 and 21.9 Å, respectively). The high crystallinity and preferential face-on polymer backbone orientation should be favourable for hole transport in the vertical direction across the electrodes. The hole mobilities of the optimized polymer:PC71BM blends were estimated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method to be about 6.4 × 10−4, 3.4 × 10−3 and 2.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PID-T4:PC71BM, PID-ffT4:PC71BM and PffID-T4:PC71BM, respectively.

The polymer:fullerene blends were further analyzed with resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS, Fig. 4) by using an X-ray energy where the polymer and fullerene scattering contrast is relatively large. The mode of spacing indicated by the R-SoXS measurements is about 45.4 nm for PID-T4:PC71BM, which means the average domain size of the PID-T4:PC71BM should be about 22.7 nm. The domain spacing of the polymer:fullerene blends is reduced to 36.5 nm for PID-ffT4:PC71BM and 31.6 nm for PffID-T4:PC71BM. The relative domain purity is also measured from the R-SoXS profile along with domain spacing. The relative purity values of 0.92, 1, and 0.97 are observed for PID-T4:PC71BM, PID-ffT4:PC71BM and PffID-T4:PC71BM, respectively, which are in good agreement with the trend of FF and JSC. It was demonstrated in many material systems that high domain purity is important to achieve high SCLC mobilities and thus high FFs for BHJ devices.39,40 It is noted that PID-ffT4:PC71BM exhibited a higher VOC than PffID-4T:PC71BM devices, while the two polymers show quite similar HOMO levels. The higher domain purity of PID-ffT4:PC71BM than that of PffID-T4:PC71BM may contribute to the higher VOC of PID-ffT4:PC71BM based devices, as the radiative and nonradiative recombination loss also has great effect on the VOC loss.41 A similar phenomenon of the fluorination position effect on VOC was reported for benzothiadizole–quaterthiophene-based polymers.42

We note that the polymer crystallinity and hole mobility data are consistent with the polymer aggregation properties. PID-ffT4 is the polymer with the strongest extent of aggregation, which allows it to achieve high polymer crystallinity and hole mobility. The PID-ffT4 polymer chains exhibit a similar conformation (in solution at 25 °C) to that in the solid state as they have nearly the same absorption onset. In contrast, the film absorption of the other two polymers (Fig. 1a and c) are significantly red-shifted (for about 20 nm) compared to those of the solution at 25 °C. These results prove that the PID-T4 and PffID-T4 polymers exhibit a more twisted polymer backbone orientation in the solution (at 25 °C) than in the solid state. The rationale behind this observation appears to be that the polymer chains can change their backbone conformation from a more twisted to a more planar structure during the cooling process of the solution. It is important for the polymer backbone to take on a planar structure and fully “line up” in solution during the solution cooling/casting process before the polymer chains crush out from solution and into a solid film. The fact that the absorption onset is similar for the solution at 25 °C and the film is a good support for the similar polymer backbone conformation between the two states, which is an important factor to achieve high polymer crystallinity and hole mobility and thus high-performance PSCs using temperature-dependent aggregation polymers. The phenomenon is supported by the collective evidence from this paper and previous reports.10,33,34
In summary, a family of ID-based D–A copolymers with or without the fluorine substitution were designed and synthesized. Comparing the two polymers that differ in the positions of fluorine substitutions, it was found that the polymer (PID-ffT4) with a fluorinated donor unit exhibits significantly stronger temperature dependent aggregation in solution supported by the emergence of the additional “aggregation peak” and by the fact that the absorption onset of its room temperature solution is similar to that of the film. The stronger aggregation properties of the PID-ffT4 led to a more crystalline polymer texture and thus higher hole mobility. These beneficial changes in polymer properties contribute to the enhanced photocurrents and fill factors, leading to PSCs with PCEs up to 7.0% without using any additives.
