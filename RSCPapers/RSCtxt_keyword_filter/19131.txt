    , Accepted 19th December 2012First published on 3rd January 2013AbstractWe demonstrated the p-type chemical doping by chlorine and nitrate anions to enhance the Schottky junction in the solar cell. Nitrate ions were found to be more effective for reducing the sheet resistance and enlarging the work function of graphene for effective charge separation and transport, and the efficiency was increased to 9.2% by a factor of 1.68 under AM 1.5 illumination.
In the past few years, graphene has been produced in the form of ultra-thin films consisting of one or a few atomic layers1–3 and these transparent, conducting films achieved progress for applications in graphene-based solar cells.4,5 However, the electronic properties of graphene remain the most restricting factor. Subsequently, chemical methods have been developed for improving the physical properties of graphene with the emergence of novel electronic devices. Work on chemical doping showed efficient processes for adjusting the work function of graphene and reducing its resistance and of the resulting characteristics of p-doping (HNO3,6,7 AuCl3,8,9 thionyl chloride (SOCl2)10,11).
We directly deposited highly conductive, semi-transparent graphene films on n-type silicon (n-Si) wafers to form Schottky junction solar cells.12 Our results show that graphene as an energy conversion material not only contributes to charge separation and transport but also functions as a transparent electrode. The power conversion efficiencies of this solar cell were still low due to the weak junction and contact between the interfaces.13 Recently, many works have expanded this simple concept of Schottky junction solar cells by replacing silicon with various semiconducting substrates such as CdS14 and CdSe.15,16 In addition, more functional layers such as trifluoromethanesulfonyl-amide (TFSA) were introduced as the p-dopant and increased the conversion efficiencies.17 Although partial improvement was achieved for these devices, the direct improvement for this solar cell based on graphene leads to better understanding of this simple concept of Schottky junctions. SOCl2 and HNO3 are known to be the p-type dopants in graphitic materials,18,19 and the holes were impacted at the surface of this carbon structure. In this study, we investigated the effects of doping with chlorine and nitrate ions, the physical and chemical properties of graphene after doping, and the improvements for these Schottky junction solar cells.
The fabrication of the graphene/n-Si solar cell was previously described.12,20,21 Large multilayer graphene (MLG) films were synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method using copper foil at atmospheric pressure. The graphene growth was conducted at 1000 °C for 10 min with a mixture flow of Ar/H2/CH4 (1600/400/30 mL min−1). As previously reported, the size of graphene films depends on the metal substrate. The metal substrate was etched away by a ferric chloride solution, and the free-standing graphene films were rinsed with deionized water. The MLG films were prepared with conductivity (500–1000 Ω sq−1) and transmittance (83–90% at 550 nm, 4–7 layers). The freestanding graphene films were easily transferred onto any substrate, such as silicon, and favorably and effectively contacted the substrate. As shown in Fig. 1a, the graphene film was coated conformally onto a patterned Si/SiO2 substrate with a 0.1 cm2 Si window. This MLG/Si device was exposed to SOCl2 or HNO3 vapors for a few seconds, and chlorine or nitrate anions were doped on the films, as shown in Fig. 1b. The photovoltaic properties of these solar cell devices were measured under air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5, 70 mW cm−2) illumination.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization shows the SOCl2 and HNO3 treatment of graphene films (Fig. 1c). The pristine graphene films were undefiled and had slight wrinkles in the surface, due to the nucleation of defect lines on Cu terrace edges and thermal stress-induced step edges and defect lines.22 An organic substance was observed after the graphene films were exposed to the chemical vapors. The images suggested that the chemical treatment promoted aggregation along the planes and folded more wrinkles on the surface. No significant breakages were shown on the film, implying that the vapor treatment was not strong enough to induce the type of rips observed on chemically converted graphene flakes.10,23 The suitable transmittance and high conductivity of the graphene film are vital for solar cell applications. The optical spectra showed that the transparency of the film doped with SOCl2 and HNO3 vapors did not decrease significantly (Fig. 1d), from 81.7 to 81.5% when doped with SOCl2 and from 83.7 to 83.1% when doped with HNO3. However, the electric performance of graphene films was improved by doping. The sheet resistance of graphene films from CVD commonly was approximately 500–1000 Ω sq−1. We examined a variety of sheet resistances of doped graphene films. After chemical treatment, the sheet resistance of graphene films was decreased to 405 Ω sq−1 (a 45% decrease) from 735 Ω sq−1 in samples doped with SOCl2 and to 210 Ω sq−1 (a 62% decrease) from 550 Ω sq−1 in samples doped with HNO3; these values were steady as the doping time increased. However, the sheet resistance began to revert slightly after doping ended, suggesting that the physical adsorption existed on the surface of the graphene film. In all, chemical vapor treatment of the graphene film could reduce the sheet resistance by nearly 42% (SOCl2 doping) or 55% (HNO3 doping), and HNO3 was more beneficial to the loss of resistance.6
To confirm and analyze the effect of the chemical doping, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) were employed to verify the quality and structure of graphene. Fig. 2a shows the Raman spectra of MLG before and after chemical vapor treatment. The G band indicates the C–C bonding structure and provides a way to monitor electron acceptor or electron donor dopants. After vapor exposure, the G peak blue shifts from 1579.8 cm−1 (pristine) to 1581.2 cm−1 (SOCl2 treatment) and 1582.6 cm−1 (HNO3 treatment), which indicates electron transfer from pristine graphene to the dopant (inset of Fig. 2a).10,24 There is no splitting of the G peak, indicating that the dopant is mainly adsorbing to and interacting with the surface rather than intercalating.23 The 2D peak (∼2705 cm−1) shows a downshift, probably caused by the overlapping of signals from different graphene layers.25 The shape of the 2D band can also be used to explain the aggregation and folding along the film planes.

XPS spectra show the C1s, Cl2p (C–Cl) and N1s (C–N) binding energies (Fig. 2b–d, respectively). The results indicate that C–Cl and C–N interactions form from the doping process, which leads to the overall enhancement of the electronic transport.26,27 The C1s peak at 284.4 eV shifts slightly to a lower binding energy (283.9 eV) after vapor treatment, ascribed to the sp2 hybridization. Furthermore, the Cl2p and N1s core level spectra are shown, confirming the presence of chlorine and nitrate anions in the graphene lattice. The Cl2p spectra show two nonequivalent chlorine sites from the 3/2 and 1/2 levels, and the more intense peak at 200.5 eV was from C–Cl covalent bonds, while the less intense peak at 198.7 eV was from Cl−1 ionic bonds. The N1s spectra exhibit two peaks which were from NO3−1 ionic bonds at 400.2 eV and from C–N covalent bonds at 407.3 eV. These spectra show that the surface is doped mainly by surface adsorption and surface interaction. The atomic concentrations of C, O, Cl and N are estimated and summarized in Table 1. It is inferred that the oxygen concentration is enhanced from 9.28 to 12.61% upon HNO3 doping, but it is difficult to calculate the exact oxygen content using XPS, as graphene is coated on SiO2 during measurements. The SOCl2 and HNO3 doping process can be explained according to eqn (1) and (2).10,27 SOCl2 + C+OH−1 → C+Cl−˙HCl + SO2(1) 4HNO3 + C+OH−1 + C → 2C+NO3−˙HNO3 + NO2 + 2H2O(2)

The reaction mechanism can be illustrated by the schematic structure in Fig. 2e. SOCl2 reacted with water releasing hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. The edges and basal planes of graphene were functionalized with chlorine and nitrate anions where the hydroxyl and carboxyl functionalities had existed.

Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage (I–V) curves before and after the chemical treatment of MLG/Si solar cells. For the MLG/Si solar cell doped with SOCl2, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the SLG/Si solar cell changed from 0.50 V to 0.55 V, 17.83 mA cm−2 to 17.18 mA cm−2 and 0.44 to 0.66, respectively, corresponding to a solar energy conversion efficiency (η) increase from 5.52% to 8.94%. The Voc, Jsc and FF of the MLG/Si solar cell upon doping with HNO3 were 0.55 V, 17.06 mA cm−2 and 0.69, respectively, and the conversion efficiency was 9.27%, as shown in Table 2. After chemical treatment, the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, FF, η) increased significantly, and HNO3 doping exhibited an extraordinary effect corresponding to overall solar energy conversion efficiency and exceeding the cell performance by a factor of 1.68. It is worth noting that Jsc dropped slightly for the decrease in transparency of the doped film. The effect of doping time on MLG/Si solar cell devices was investigated. The conversion efficiency sharply increased and tended to be stable rapidly when the films were doped. The maximum power conversion efficiency appeared after a treatment period of 60 s. Fig. 3b and c show the effects of doping time on Voc, Jsc, FF and η. The η, Voc and FF parameters increased consistently in relation to one another, while Jsc dropped slightly owing to little change in transparency of the doped film. The pristine external quantum efficiencies (EQEs, measured with CEP-25/CH) of the MLG/Si were measured in the visible and near-infrared regions (300–1100 nm), as shown in Fig. 3d. The EQE spectra significantly overlapped at high wavelength and decreased at low wavelength, showing that the n-Si mainly absorbed the incident photon and generated the charge carriers in this solar cell. After chemical doping, the EQE increased, for a nearly 50% enhancement relative to the pristine one. The higher EQE after doping was due to increased charge separation and collection.

The higher conversion efficiency with chemical doping can be attributed to the enhancement of the Schottky junction, leading to efficient charge separation and transport. There are two possibilities for this enhancement based on the results shown in Table 2. The first possibility is that the improvement arose from the reduction of series resistance (calculated from the plot dV/dln I vs. I)12 and increase of FF. From Fig. 3e, series resistance Rs decreased with SOCl2 and HNO3 doping, from 54.41 to 47.43 Ω (a 13% decrease) and from 49.58 to 26.84 Ω (a 46% decrease), respectively. These significant decreases were attributed to chlorine and nitrate anions that possessed additional charge transfer sites and the impaction of the holes at the surface of the graphene film. The FF was affected mainly by the series resistance and increased obviously by a factor of approximately 1.5–1.6. Compared to SOCl2, HNO3 was more effective as a p-type dopant in graphene, enlarging both Voc and FF and promoting the energy conversion efficiency of the solar cell. The second possible cause for the enhancement of the Schottky junction is the increase of Voc, which would adjust the work function of graphene. From Fig. 3f, the increase in Voc after doping promoted higher built-in potential Vo and the barrier height (Φb) which is in agreement with the difference between the work function of MLG (ΦG) and the electron affinity of silicon (χ). After chemical doping, the higher ΦG increases Φb, resulting in greater charge transfer and collection across the interface.
To conclude, we discussed the effects of the chemical doping of graphene films for solar energy conversion. This p-type doping in graphene was attributed to the chlorine and nitrate anions impacted into the surface of the graphene film for charge separation and easier transport. Our results show that nitrate ions were more effective for chemical doping of graphene films compared to chlorine, resulting in decrease of Rs, increase of Voc and FF and enhanced the conductivity of graphene films, which further contributed to the photovoltaic enhancement of the Schottky junction. The solar energy conversion efficiency improved to 9.27% from 5.53% by a factor of 1.68. This chemical treatment was a simple and practical method for improvement of the work function of graphene for optimization of solar cells or other devices based on graphene.
