    , Accepted 17th March 2021First published on 18th March 2021AbstractThe application of exotic conjugated skeletons in organic semiconductors is alluring due to the topology related optoelectronic peculiarities. In this paper we explore the design of molecular semiconductors starting from the saddle-shaped o-tetraphenylene (OTP) for the first time. The in silico tailored molecular semiconductor OTPE-OMeTPA with extended π-conjugation presents an improved hole mobility in comparison with its counterpart OTP-OMeDPA, due to the reduced reorganization energy and the larger intermolecular centroid distance. Molecular dynamics simulations clarify the atomic-scale microscopic origins of glass transition in the pristine materials and their p-doping promotor containing composites, being associated with the torsional motion of central OTP and the translational motion of all centroids, respectively. The OTPE-OMeTPA based organic composite displays desirable combined properties of conductivity, glass transition temperature, solution processibility, and interfacial charge transfer kinetics, allowing for the fabrication of thermostable perovskite solar cells with 21.5% power conversion efficiency. A comprehensive comparison of device degradation is also performed by joint experimental measurements and theoretical modeling, laying a solid foundation for further materials and device development.
1. Introduction
The n–i–p structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which are made with electron-transporting materials, light-absorbing perovskite materials, and hole-transporting materials (HTMs), have been reported with excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), e.g. a current record of 25.17%.1 In this type of device, since the yield of electron extraction from the photoexcited perovskite by titania is very poor, the choice of a hole transport layer (HTL) capable of quantitative extraction of photogenerated holes is of great concern.2 This means that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of a suitable HTM for titania based PSCs must be adequately high to ensure a certain driving force, which is very much different from the scenario of PSCs with fullerene and its derivatives for electron extraction.3,4 In the last decade, various HTMs have been explored for titania based PSCs, e.g. inorganic semiconductors,5–8 polymeric semiconductors,9–19 and molecular semiconductors.20–33
However, the reported efficiency record of PSCs is so far kept by the device made with the state-of-the art HTM, spiro-OMeTAD, in spite of its relatively low glass transition temperature (Tg) of 122 °C.34,35 From the viewpoint of topology, spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S1A†) can be regarded here as a molecule formed by connecting two N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzidine (MeO-TPD)36,37 with four C–C bonds to a tetrahedral carbon. Indeed, the resultant spiro-OMeTAD has already had a greatly enhanced Tg in comparison with 67 °C for MeO-TPD.38 Recently, two MeO-TPD molecules were tethered to CC with four C–C bonds, affording 9,9′-bifluorenylidene and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene based molecular semiconductors, KR216 (ref. 33) and DBC-OMeDPA,24 respectively, both of which exhibit Tgs higher than 150 °C. For their chemical structures, see Fig. S1A of the ESI.† It can also be imagined that even without using any additional atoms, two MeO-TPD molecules can be connected to each other with two C–C bonds, forming OTP-OMeDPA (Fig. 1A) with an o-tetraphenylene (OTP) core. Intriguingly, nonplanar OTP has a saddle-shaped structure, with two pairs of benzene rings oriented alternately above or below the average plane of the molecule.39 The four benzene rings form a rigid central eight-membered ring by ortho-annulation. To our surprise, OTP is not yet used in organic molecules showing charge transport properties.

(B) Two conformations identified in the OTP-OMeDPA single crystal analysis, where one is marked in cyan and another in magenta. Bond angles 1–8 of OTP are 123.79°, 124.38°, 123.12°, 124.04°, 123.82°, 124.89°, 122.99°, and 124.66°, respectively. (C) Stacking of OTP-OMeDPA molecules viewed from the crystallographic a axis. 
Our preliminary density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that in contrast to spiro-OMeTAD, KR216, and DBC-OMeDPA, OTP-OMeDPA exhibits a destabilized energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and a slightly stabilized energy level of the HOMO (Fig. S1B†). In addition, theoretical prediction based on molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, and kinetic Monte Carlo methods shows that the amorphous solid of OTP-OMeDPA has a higher hole mobility than the other three related molecules (Fig. S2A†), due mainly to the smaller reorganization energy (Fig. S2B†) and the diminished energetic disorder (Fig. S2C†). The in silico predicted material properties motivated us to prepare OTP-OMeDPA and explore its potential as a HTL for PSC application. Furthermore, the conjugated block of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and benzene can be inserted between the central OTP and the terminal bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine (OMeDPA) electron-donor, generating OTPE-OMeTPA (Fig. 1A), which presents a further improved theoretical hole mobility (Fig. S3A†) and an impressively increased theoretical Tg than OTP-OMeDPA (Fig. S3B†). Our subsequent experimental studies show that with a molecular weight of over 2000, OTPE-OMeTPA free of any flexible long chains can still be solution-processed into a HTL for the fabrication of 21.5%-efficiency PSCs, exhibiting a good durability at 60 °C for 1000 h.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis, solubility, and structure
2,7,10,15-Tetrachlorotetraphenylene (4Cl-OTP) can be conveniently prepared according to the reported procedure.40 The Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 4Cl-OTP with 4-fold bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine afforded OTP-OMeDPA in an excellent yield of 91%. On the other hand, the Stille cross-coupling of 4Cl-OTP with a tributylstannyl derivative of EDOT-OMeTPA produced OTPE-OMeTPA in a good yield of 72%. The chemical structures of target compounds were confirmed by 1H and 13C nuclear resonance spectra, high-resolution mass spectra, and infrared spectra (Fig. S4–S11†). The solubility of OTPE-OMeTPA in chlorobenzene was measured as 73 mM, which is even much higher than 45 mM for OTP-OMeDPA.
The OTP-OMeDPA single crystal was successfully obtained for X-ray crystallographic analysis, and its key crystal parameters are collected in Table S1.† The OTP-OMeDPA molecules crystallize into the triclinic P space group, where two molecules with different conformations (Fig. 1B) are identified in a unit cell. The molecular arrangement of OTP-OMeDPA along the crystallographic a axis is presented in Fig. 1C. Along the b axis, the dimer formed by molecules with different conformation stacks repeatedly, yielding two types of molecular arrays. Two types of molecular arrays can be transformed into each other by inversion operation. The molecular arrays present an alternate, slip arrangement along the c axis to form a molecular lamella in the bc plane.
2.2. Electrochemical and photophysical properties
To study whether the tetrapod π-linker alteration from OTP to the conjugate of OTP, EDOT, and benzene will impact the HOMO energy levels of molecular semiconductors, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA in tetrahydrofuran (THF) were measured with a glassy carbon electrode. From the CV curves shown in Fig. 2A, the electrochemical HOMO energy levels (EcvH) can be calculated from the onset oxidation potentials (Eonset) vs. ferrocene using the equation EcvH = −Eonset − 5.10, being −5.23 eV for OTP-OMeDPA and −5.18 eV for OTPE-OMeTPA. The higher HOMO of OTPE-OMeTPA is apparently associated with its extended π-linker. The trend of HOMO energy levels measured by CV is in rough agreement with that derived from DFT (Fig. 2B).

The steady-state UV-vis absorption spectra of these two molecules in THF were measured and are provided in Fig. 2C. The low-energy absorption maximum of OTPE-OMeTPA has a red-shifted wavelength of 404 nm, relative to 306 nm of OTP-OMeDPA. As presented in Fig. S12,† the time dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculation at the PBE1PBE/6-311G(d,p) level roughly replicates the experimental electronic absorption spectrum of OTP-OMeDPA, but fails for OTPE-OMeTPA to some extent. Thus, the long-range hybrid functional of BMK containing 42% Hartree–Fock exchange was chosen to better reproduce the experimental spectra of OTPE-OMeTPA (Fig. S13†). By taking a scrutiny on TDDFT results in Tables S2 and S3,† one can easily find that the low-energy absorption bands mainly originate from vertical electronic transitions, from S0 to the high-energy excited states of S1, S2, S5, and S6 for OTP-OMeDPA, and from S0 to S1 and S2 for OTPE-OMeTPA. In addition, OTPE-OMeTPA presents a red-shifted photoluminescence (PL) maximum by 50 nm compared to OTP-OMeDPA (Fig. 2C). The PL of both molecules can be mainly ascribed to the LUMO to HOMO electronic transition of the equilibrium singlet excited state. The red shifting of the PL peak of OTPE-OMeTPA is in general linked with its smaller HOMO/LUMO energy gap, which can be seen from Fig. 2B.
2.3. Hole mobility and conductivity of amorphous organic solids
In a disordered organic solid, weak intermolecular noncovalent interactions between molecules bring forth small electronic couplings, which means that charge carriers are instantaneously localized and hole transport takes place by the hopping mechanism. In the framework of non-adiabatic Marcus theory,41 the main determinants of hole hopping rate (ωij) are reorganization energy (λht), site energy difference (ΔEij), and transfer integral (νij). Actually, the HTL made with molecular semiconductors for photodiodes is ordinarily amorphous. The reorganization energy for arylamine-based materials mainly consists of the change of molecular geometries and greatly influences the hole transport of organic amorphous solids.42 As displayed in Fig. 3A, the λht value of OTPE-OMeTPA was calculated by the adiabatic potential-surface (AP) method, being 100 meV, which is lower than 121 meV for OTP-OMeDPA. The reduced λht of OTPE-OMeTPA is likely correlated with the greater hole delocalization length and/or the smaller geometric distortion, such as changes in bond length alternation and average inter-ring dihedral angels.42

The dashed line indicates the theoretical hole mobility of the amorphous solids. (H) Conductivity (σ) of thin films made from the pristine organic semiconductor (filled symbol) and the BPTFSI containing composite (open symbol). 
A disordered solid composed of organic molecules with different molecular conformations and orientations is separated by topological defects, and usually presents a Gaussian distribution of ΔEij due to the effects of electrostatic and polarization.43 This scenario is also embodied in the ΔEij distribution (Fig. 3B) of molecular dynamics (MD) simulated amorphous solids of OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA.44 Obviously, hole transport will be greatly subjected to the potential traps of molecules centered at the ΔEij tail. The energetic disorder of OTPE-OMeTPA is derived as 180 meV, which is larger than 163 meV for OTP-OMeDPA. This should be intrinsically related to more randomly located and oriented dipoles for OTPE-OMeTPA with a large molecular length. The distribution profile of the square of transfer integral and centroid distance (v2d2), which is proportional to hole mobility (μh),45 is plotted in Fig. 3C. In spite of similar distribution in the range of v2d2 < 100 meV2 Å2, the OTPE-OMeTPA system has a higher probability in v2d2 > 100 meV2 Å2 than the OTP-OMeDPA one. As noted in Fig. S14,† the positive contribution of larger d overwhelms the adverse influence of inferior v, leading to an advantageous v2d2 profile.
After knowing the sites and rates of hole transfer, we can obtain the solution of the master equation by virtue of the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method, which has already been implemented in the software of VOTCA,46 to afford the dynamics of hole transport. As shown in Fig. 3D and E, the projections onto the xy, yz and zx planes, of 20 kMC trajectories of hole hopping, do not vary too much, which suggests the isotropic hole transport characteristic in amorphous organic solids. The mean square displacement (MSD) of the hopping of a hole in the OTPE-OMeTPA system is ca. 4 times as large as that in the OTP-OMeDPA one (Fig. 3F). This can be rationalized in terms of the smaller λht and the larger averaged d of the OTPE-OMeTPA system, albeit its larger energetic disorder and inferior v profile. The theoretical μh for OTPE-OMeTPA was calculated as 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than 5.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OTP-OMeDPA.
The hole-only devices were fabricated for the dark current density–voltage (J–V) measurements (Fig. S15†) with the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO electrode for hole injection and the evaporated gold electrode for hole collection. By use of the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, the experimental μh value of the pristine OTPE-OMeTPA thin film is derived as 3.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is twice as high as 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the OTP-OMeDPA one. Actually, the trend of experimental μh is in general accordance with the theoretical one (Fig. 3G). Upon incorporating 4-tert-butylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (BPTFSI) for air doping, the thin film μh values were improved by 12 and 16 times, being 6.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OTPE-OMeTPA and 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OTP-OMeDPA (Fig. 3G). This scenario can be well understood in terms of the analytic model proposed by Arkhipov et al. on charge transport in doped disordered organic semiconductors.47 This model sets forth that at a high doping level, the overlapping of Coulomb potential wells lowers the activation energies of Coulomb traps and simultaneously leads to a smoother potential landscape, greatly enhancing mobility.
From the current–voltage (I–V) curves (Fig. S16†) of thin films which are deposited on interdigital gold electrodes, we can derive the direct current electrical conductivities (σ), being 0.042 μS cm−1 for pristine OTP-OMeDPA and 0.17 μS cm−1 for pristine OTPE-OMeTPA, which are around two orders of magnitude enhanced to 5.3 μS cm−1 for the air doped BPTFSI composite of OTP-OMeDPA, and 15.6 μS cm−1 for that of OTPE-OMeTPA (Fig. 3H). Referring to the increased ratios of μh, the larger augmentation of σ induced by doping is also associated with the increase of hole density. Moreover, it can be deduced that the hole density of pristine OTPE-OMeTPA is about twice as large as that of OTP-OMeDPA. This phenomenon can be rationalized by unintentional p-doping of high HOMO OTPE-OMeTPA to a relatively high level under ambient conditions.
2.4. Glass transition of amorphous organic solids
Any type of practical solar cell is undoubtedly capable of certain resistance to thermal stress. In this respect, a sufficiently high Tg of the HTL prepared from molecular semiconductors is a pre-requisite for application in PSCs; only in this way can the atomic-level microstructure of a HTL be maintained at elevated temperatures.48,49 As shown in Fig. S18A and B,† the experimental Tgs derived from differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) curves, Tdscgs, are 141 °C for pristine OTP-OMeDPA and 193 °C for pristine OTPE-OMeTPA, both of which are by accident ∼65 °C higher than 71 °C for the BPTFSI containing composite of OTP-OMeDPA, and 134 °C for the OTPE-OMeTPA congener. Further MD simulations of these amorphous systems were performed for the assessment of theoretical Tg values, Tspgs, which can be obtained from the intersection of two linear fittings of specific volume–temperature (Vsp–T) plots (Fig. S17G–K†). Although Tspgs are generally overvalued compared with Tdscgs due to the fast cooling rate in MD simulation, one can note that there is indeed a good correlation between Tspgs and Tdscgs as plotted in Fig. 4A.
 Fig. 4  (A) Correlation between the theoretical (Tspg) and experimental (Tdscg) glass transition temperatures: (a) the pristine OTP-OMeDPA, (b) the pristine OTPE-OMeTPA, (c) the composite of OTP-OMeDPA and 0.5 equivalent BPTFSI, and (d) the composite of OTPE-OMeTPA and 0.5 equivalent BPTFSI. The light gray line is the linear fitting. (B) Evolution of MSD of organic semiconductor molecules at the temperatures of ca. 40 °C above and below Tspg. (C and D) Dihedral angles of φ1, φ2, φ3, and φ4. (E and F) Mean standard deviation (s) of φ1 and φ2 as a function of temperature (T) in the amorphous solids of pristine organic semiconductors. (G and H) s–T plots of φ1 and φ2. (I) MSD–t plots for the BPTFSI containing composites at the temperatures of ca. 40 °C above and below Tspg. 
As shown in Fig. 4B, the MSD of either OTP-OMeDPA or OTPE-OMeTPA does not grow within the time range of 400 ps at the temperatures of ca. 40 °C above and below Tspg, suggesting that the diffusion of individual molecules does not occur. We further monitored the dihedral angels of φ1, φ2, φ3, and φ4 as marked in Fig. 4C and D, to scrutinize whether torsional motions are affiliated to the glass transition process. As noted from Fig. 4E, the standard deviation (s) of φ1 for the pristine systems increases linearly with temperature in the low-temperature region, but suddenly encounters an inflection point just at the temperature near Tspg. The change point in s of φ1 is located at a higher temperature for OTPE-OMeTPA than OTP-OMeDPA, which is consistent with the trend of Tspg. This may be explained by the larger energy barrier of the internal and external relaxation processes of OTPE-OMeTPA. By contrast, the s values of φ2 (Fig. 4F), φ3 (Fig. S18A†), and φ4 (Fig. S18B†) increase linearly throughout the whole temperature range, which means that the twisting motions of these three dihedral angels are not intrinsically linked with glass transition. However, as shown in Fig. 4G and H, the torsional motions of both φ2 and φ1 are not related to glass transition anymore for the BPTFSI containing composite of either OTP-OMeDPA or OTPE-OMeTPA. More notably, for the BPTFSI composites, the translational motions of not only the cations and anions of BPTFSI (Fig. S19†) but also molecules of OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA (Fig. 4I) are clearly probed at temperatures of ca. 40 °C above Tspgs. This is strongly linked with the glass transition dynamics of semiconductor composites.
2.5. Charge extraction from the photoexcited perovskite
For PSCs using TiO2 as the electron transport layer, the small offset of the conduction band between TiO2 and a lead halide perovskite leads to a fairly slow rate of electron extraction upon photoexcitation (Fig. S20†), although a high-quality perovskite film ordinarily presents a long lifetime and a long diffusion length of excited state. In this connection, hole extraction by a HTL from the photoexcited perovskite must be sufficiently expeditious. To appraise the time constants (τh) and yields (ϕh) of hole extraction from the alloyed perovskite film of (CsPbI3)0.05(MAPbBr3)0.075(FAPbI3)0.875(PbI2)0.03 (abbreviated as CsMAFA), the time-resolved PL (TRPL) traces of the alumina based samples were measured. Herein, due to the wide bandgap of 7–9 eV, alumina does not extract charges from the photoexcited perovskite and just functions as the scaffold of the spin-coated perovskite.50 As shown in Fig. 5A, the TRPL decays can be fitted by a biexponential function and key fitting parameters are compiled in Table 1. The amplitude average time constant () of the perovskite film sandwiched between alumina and polystyrene (PS) is as large as 1426 ns. Moreover, the perovskite with either OTP-OMeDPA or OTPE-OMeTPA shows an over one order of magnitude diminution of . As tabulated in Table 1, the derived τh values are 34.1 ns for the OTP-OMeDPA based sample, and 31.3 ns for the OTPE-OMeTPA counterpart. On the basis of the  of 1426 ns for the pristine perovskite, the ϕh values of OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA are estimated to be 97.6% and 97.8%, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 5B, the HOMO energy levels are deduced from ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (Fig. S21A†), being −5.12 eV for OTP-OMeDPA and −5.09 eV for OTPE-OMeTPA, both of which are higher than the valence band edge of −5.45 eV for CsMAFA. Furthermore, the energy alignments of HTMs with respect to CsMAFA are completed in Fig. 5B with the aid of optical gaps (Fig. S21B†), manifesting the energetic role of electron blocking effect of OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA. The driving force of hole extraction (ΔG0) with OTPE-OMeTPA is 360 meV, which is 30 meV larger than 330 meV with OTP-OMeDPA. In addition, the reorganization energy of hole extraction (λhe) calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level is 50 meV for OTPE-OMeTPA, which is slightly smaller than 61 meV for OTP-OMeDPA (Fig. 5C). Overall, the faster hole extraction of OTPE-OMeTPA benefits from the larger ΔG0 and the smaller λhe.
2.6. Application in PSCs
The BPTFSI and TBP containing chlorobenzene solutions of OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA were spin-coated onto the surface of the CsMAFA based perovskite, as HTLs, for the construction of archetypal PSCs with a multilayer-stacked device structure: glass/FTO/compact-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/HTL/Au. For the details of cell fabrication, encapsulation, and optoelectronic characterization, see the Experimental section of ESI.† The representative current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of our PSCs, measured under the irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) sunlight are shown in Fig. 6A and B. Table 2 collects the photovoltaic parameters of short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and PCE. The PSC with OTP-OMeDPA shows a JSC of 24.43 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.105 V, a FF of 76.2%, affording a PCE of 20.6%, which is slightly lower than 20.9% for the control cell using the state-of-the art spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S22†). Moreover, the cell with OTPE-OMeTPA exhibits an improved VOC of 1.115 V and an aggrandized FF of 78.8%, generating a better PCE of 21.5% along with a similar JSC of 24.44 mA cm−2. One can note from Table 2 that the short-circuit photocurrent densities under the AM1.5G conditions predicted by EQE curves (JEQESC) are very close to the JSC values of J–V measurements. As presented in Fig. S23,† there is a very small electric hysteresis index (ηHI) less than 1% in our cells. In addition, the narrow distribution of cell parameters shown in Fig. S24† for 4-batch 16 cells suggests a good repeatability of photovoltaic behavior.

To understand the physical origins of enhanced VOC and FF with OTP-OMeDPA as the HTL instead of OTP-OMeDPA, impedance spectra (IS)51 of PSCs were further recorded at a series of forward bias potentials (V). The recorded IS (Fig. S25A and B†) can be well fitted by an equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. S25C,† affording two key physical parameters, i.e. interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rrec) extracted from the low-frequency region and transport resistance (Rtr) from the high-frequency one. As presented in Fig. S25D,† at a given V, the cell with OTPE-OMeTPA has a larger Rrec than the OTP-OMeDPA counterpart, nicely explaining the relative magnitude of VOC. We remark that when spin-coating is performed at 30 mM of HTM, OTP-OMeDPA with a lower molecular weight forms a thinner organic film (about 70 nm) on the surface of the perovskite than OTPE-OMeTPA (90 nm). In this case, some microscopic shunts between the perovskite and the gold electrode may occur, explaining its smaller Rrec. To prove this point, an additional OTPE-OMeTPA cell made with a lower concentration HTM solution (10 mM) does present reduced Rrec and thus lower VOC (Fig. S26†). As shown in Fig. S25E,† the Rtr of the OTPE-OMeTPA based cell even with a thicker HTL is however still smaller than that of the standard OTP-OMeDPA one, which seems consistent with the higher conductivity of the doped OTPE-OMeTPA film. We also suspect that the contact resistance between the HTL and gold is probably smaller for OTPE-OMeTPA. Overall, the ameliorative FF of the cell with OTPE-OMeTPA can be ascribed to the joint contributions of larger Rrec and smaller Rtr.
2.7. Device stability and degradation analysis
To evaluate if hole transport layers with different Tg values will affect the thermal stabilities of PSCs, we stored the cells with OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA in a 60 °C oven for 1000 h. J–V curves of the aged cells are also given in Fig. 6A and B to make a comparison with the fresh ones. As listed in Table 2, the aged OTPE-OMeTPA cell presents a PCE retention rate of 82%, which overmatches 70% of the OTP-OMeDPA counterpart. The aged OTPE-OMeTPA cell suffers a JSC loss of 5%, which is superior to 9% of the OTP-OMeDPA cell. Besides, after thermal aging, the FF of the OTP-OMeDPA cell is significantly reduced by 20%, which is damped to 14% for the OTPE-OMeTPA cell. In addition, the decline in VOC is 45 meV for the aged OTP-OMeDPA cell while the VOC of the OTPE-OMeTPA cell is almost invariable.
Subsequently, IS analyses of aged PSCs were also carried out to diagnose if Rrec and Rtr are changed after 1000 h thermal aging. On the whole, the aging causes Rrec to decrease and Rtr to increase for both cells studied here, as shown in Fig. 6C–F. Actually, the change of Rrec is almost negligible for the OTPE-OMeTPA cell, however the aged OTP-OMeDPA cell presents a marked reduction in Rrec compared to its fresh one, which nicely accounts for the degradation degree of VOC. What is more, the decrease of Rrec and the remarkable augmentation of Rtr collectively give rise to a large loss of FF for the aged OTP-OMeDPA cell.
As noted from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images shown in Fig. 6G and H, the perovskite layer is well covered with a pinhole-free HTL of either OTP-OMeDPA or OTPE-OMeTPA. However, the thermal aging brings forth a lacerated surface for the OTP-OMeDPA layer (Fig. 6I), which is clearly dotted with sub-micrometer-sized, variform pinholes. This large morphological variation of the HTL correlates well with the appreciably large change of both Rrec and Rtr of the aged OTP-OMeDPA cell. In contrast, the PSC with the OTPE-OMeTPA characteristic of high Tg only exhibits slightly fracted HTL morphology after thermal aging (Fig. 6J).
As presented in Fig. S25F†, there is a good relationship between JEQESC predicted from EQE curves and JSC derived from J–V curves, for the fresh and aged cells with OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA. Aging brings forth an obvious decrease in the EQE of the OTP-OMeDPA cell (Fig. 7A), especially in the wavelength range from 550 nm to 800 nm, which suggests that the electron collection is likely problematic in this aged cell. By contrast, the extent of EQE degradation (Fig. 7B) is distinctly damped for the OTPE-OMeTPA cell.

Note that the broken x-axis was set to be in a partially linear and partially logarithmic mode. The encapsulation materials and gold electrodes of PSCs were removed before the electronic absorption, XRD, and POM measurements. 
Nevertheless, the decreased EQE values can only be weakly correlated with the reduced light absorption (Fig. 7C). As noted from Fig. 7D and E, the fresh PSCs with OTP-OMeDPA and OTPE-OMeTPA show almost identical X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. However, after 1000 h thermal aging at 60 °C the peak height of PbI2 diffraction of the OTP-OMeDPA cell increases considerably, which is over three times higher than that of the OTPE-OMeTPA counterpart. In addition, there is a high density of dots and rods in the transmission polarization optical microscopy (POM) image (Fig. 7F) of the aged OTP-OMeDPA cell, in sharp contrast to the OTPE-OMeTPA counterpart (Fig. 7G). Note that no fine structure can be observed for the fresh PSCs (Fig. S27†). One can also note that the intensity of PL at 620 nm, which is attributable to the emission of the PbI2 G-band,52 is evidently stronger for the aged OTP-OMeDPA cell (Fig. 7H). As a whole, our electronic absorption, XRD, PL, and POM measurements have uncovered that the use of an organic HTL with high Tg is a valuable strategy to control the thermal decomposition of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite into PbI2.
Indeed, the gaseous species such as CH3I and NH3 can be released when the CsMAFA perovskite is thermally decomposed.53,54 Thereby, we used MD simulation to inspect the diffusion dynamics of CH3I in the herein studied BPTFSI composites. As presented in Fig. S28,† the diffusion coefficient of CH3I is 2.4 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 in the OTPE-OMeTPA composite at 60 °C, which is over 6 times smaller than 1.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for the OTP-OMeDPA counterpart.
Furthermore, the charge separation yields (ϕc) of fresh and aged PSCs were quantified by measuring TRPL traces, as presented in Fig. 7I and J. After 60 °C aging, the amplitude average time constant () elongates remarkably from 27 ns to 95 ns for the OTP-OMeDPA cell, which is however only changed from 25 ns to 29 ns for the OTPE-OMeTPA one (Table S4†). We deduce that this scenario should be originated from the formation of wide band-gap PbI2 at the interface between the perovskite and HTM, which can weaken the wavefunction overlap between the perovskite and HTM. In consideration of the  values of the perovskite layer itself, i.e. 1426 ns for the fresh sample and 865 ns for the aged one, the ϕc values are calculated and also collected in Table S4.† The small attenuation in charge separation yield also underpins the better retention of EQE and JSC of the OTPE-OMeTPA cell.
3. Conclusions
To sum up, we have employed the saddle-shaped o-tetraphenylene for the construction of molecular semiconductors for the first time. The in silico designed molecular semiconductor OTPE-OMeTPA with extended π-conjugation exhibits an improved hole mobility and a higher glass transition temperature, compared to its counterpart OTP-OMeDPA. Theoretical calculations have disclosed that an enhanced mobility of OTPE-OMeTPA is intrinsically related to the joint contribution of smaller reorganization energy and larger intermolecular centroid distance. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations for the pristine organic amorphous solids have reproduced the experimental results of glass transition and illustrated the microscopic origin, which is in nature correlated with the torsional motion of central saddle-shaped OTP. The doped composite of OTPE-OMeTPA exhibits an augmented conductivity and a reduced interfacial charge recombination than OTP-OMeDPA, enabling the fabrication of a 21.5%-efficiency perovskite solar cell also with a good long-term stability at 60 °C. The hole transport layer made with OTPE-OMeTPA possesses a stable morphology at 60 °C, and also markedly damps the thermal decomposition of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, which has been further rationalized from the perspective of diffusion control of released gas molecules. It has also been uncovered that the translational motion of charged and neutral species in a doped molecular semiconductor composite plays a crucial role in glass transition. Our work has supplied new physical insights on the further development of key organic materials for perovskite solar cells.

 	Fig. 7  (A and B) Plots of external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of wavelength for the fresh and aged PSCs. The aged cells are stored for 1000 h in a 60 °C oven. (C) Electronic absorption spectra of the fresh and aged cells. (D and E) X-ray diffraction patterns of the fresh and aged cells. The diffraction intensity is normalized with respect to the (110) plane of the CsMAFA based perovskite. (F and G) Transmission polarization optical microscopy (POM) images of the aged cells. Scale bar: 100 μm. (H) Steady-state PL spectra: (a) the fresh OTP-OMeDPA cell, (b) the aged OTP-OMeDPA cell, (c) the fresh OTPE-OMeTPA, and (d) the aged OTPE-OMeTPA. The PL intensity is normalized with respect to the peak of the CsMAFA perovskite. (I and J) TRPL decays of the fresh and aged cells. The gray lines are the biexponential function fittings. Note that the broken x-axis was set to be in a partially linear and partially logarithmic mode. The encapsulation materials and gold electrodes of PSCs were removed before the electronic absorption, XRD, and POM measurements.
