    , Accepted 4th March 2022First published on 21st April 2022AbstractDithienothiophene (DTT), a versatile building block for π-conjugated organic materials, has been efficiently synthesized through copper-catalysis with an inexpensive sulfur source in the essential ring-closure/C–S bond formation step, instead of using previously often reported n-butyllithium, costly bis(phenylsulfonyl)sulfide, or palladium-based catalysis. Furthermore, π-extension from DTT was also achieved step-economically by optimized copper-catalyzed direct C–H arylation reactions, giving three new oligoaryls that were used as effective hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells. One of the solar devices demonstrated the highest energy conversion efficiency of 14.67%. For the first time, [Cu]-catalyzed direct C–H/C–I couplings were used as key transformations to access small molecular HTMs.
Introduction
Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT) is one of the most used fused-thiophene cores in the field of organic semiconducting materials owing to its flexible synthesis, effortless conjugation extension, high-planarity with smooth charge transfer, and promising optoelectronic performance.1 The DTT moiety was often incorporated into oligo(hetero)aryls for organic field-effect transistors (OFET),2 used as a small-molecule organic dye for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC),3 or employed as a monomer in donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers.4 For materials chemists, DTT is a commercially available starting material for the production of sufficient target functional molecules for device applications. This usually requires a significant amount of raw DTT due to tedious synthetic transformations. However, we have noticed that it is difficult to find low-priced commercial DTT (523 USD per g from Sigma-Aldrich; 580 USD per g from TCI). Hence, the most economical way to obtain sufficient quantities of DTT might be carrying out our own synthesis. For example, Holmes5 reported a synthesis of unsubstituted dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene and its dibromo derivatives starting from tetrabromothiophene; He6 prepared alkyl-substituted DTTs using a diketone intermediate for the ring-closure step; and Zong7 disclosed a three-step approach to access DTT using thiophene as the starting material, in which the preparation of tetraiodothiophene required harsh conditions (reflux for 7 days). In addition, we noted that the annulation step could also be realized by the reaction of 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene 2 with n-butyllithium and the costly bis(phenylsulfonyl)sulfide (Scheme 1, approach A).8 On the other hand, for the ring-closure reaction under transition-metal catalysis, we found an interesting work published by Paradies,9 showing the employment of bis(3-bromobenzo[b]thiophene) to perform C–S bond formation in the presence of a palladium catalyst with an inexpensive thioacetate, MeC(O)SK. Encouraged by Paradies's results, we performed a similar C–S bond-forming reaction with 3,3′-dihalo-2,2′-bithiophene 2 or 3 (Scheme 1, approach B). However, less than 5% conversion of the desired DTT was observed. Instead, we obtained a complex mixture that was difficult to analyze. We speculated that, in addition to the annulated C–S bond formation, the unblocked C–H bonds at 5,5′-positions of 2 or 3 might be activated under the palladium-based catalytic conditions shown in approach B, thus leading to unidentified complex mixtures. Compared to the palladium-catalysis, we anticipated that a copper-based catalytic system would be relatively milder, which might restrict the competitive C–H bond activations/functionalizations. Therefore, we demonstrate herein a copper-catalyzed ring-closure of 3 using inexpensive thioacetate instead of high-cost K2S,10 which afforded the versatile dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene in excellent isolated yields of up to 92% (Scheme 1, approach C). In addition to developing copper-catalyzed C–S bond formation/annulation, the bidirectional π-extension from the DTT core has also been achieved by copper-catalysed direct C–H/C–I cross-couplings under preoptimized conditions, successfully producing three new oligoaryls that were applied as effective hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To the best of our knowledge, no reports on the connection of [Cu]-catalysed C–H arylations with the step-saving synthesis of HTMs have appeared to date. Moreover, to date there has only been one paper describing the synthesis and application of DTT core-based conjugated oligomers for HTMs/PSCs by [Pd]-catalysed Suzuki reactions.11

Results and discussion
For the copper-catalyzed cyclization step, we have been endeavoring to find the optimum reaction conditions by screening various [Cu]-catalysts, ligands, bases, solvents, and the prominent sulfur-containing reagents. The results are summarized in Table 1. Referring to the reported procedures as our initial test,9 we conducted the ring-closing reaction of 2 or 3 under palladium-based conditions. The desired dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene DTT, however, was generated in only trace amounts (entry 1). As mentioned in the previous section, we then became interested in the examination of copper-based catalytic systems using 3,3′-diiodo-2,2′-bithiophene 3 as substrate. First of all, a variety of copper salts were screened. Cyclization of 3 was conducted, respectively, with Cu(I)X (X = Cl, Br, I), 1,10-phenanthroline (L1), thioacetate, and K3PO4 in nonpolar toluene (110 °C, 16 h). In contrast to Pd-based catalysis, we were pleased to isolate the target DTT in moderate yields (61–62%, entries 2–4). In entry 5, we found Cu2O was inefficient under similar conditions, producing DTT in trace amounts. Other Cu(I)-catalysts such as CuCN and CuSCN, used individually, gave DTT in 64% (entry 6) and 54% (entry 7) yields. More noteworthy was that Cu(II)-catalysts including CuCl2, Cu(OAC)2, and Cu(acac)2 also efficiently performed ring-closure of 3 and afforded DTT in moderate to good yields (62–80%, entries 8–10). While fixing on the use of CuCl2, various N,N-type ligands were investigated (L2–L6, entries 11–15). Except for L3 (bathophenanthroline, 53%, entry 12), other ligands were ineffective toward the present cyclization and DTT was formed in trace amounts. Next, we examined a number of bases including carbonate salts (K2CO3, Na2CO3) that furnished the desired product in 62–75% yields (entries 16 and 17). Stronger t-butoxides (KOtBu, NaOtBu) did not promote C–S bond formations, resulting in poor yields of DTT (21%, entry 18; trace amount, entry 19). Besides toluene, reactions were carried out in other nonpolar solvents such as m- and p-xylene, which also led to satisfactory outcomes (78% yield, entry 20; 92% yield, entry 21). On the other hand, polar aprotic solvents (DMAc, DMSO, DMPU) were tested to provide DTT in moderate to good yields (67–82%, entries 22–24). Interestingly, we found the annulation reaction was able to take place in water under air, giving the product in 75% yield (entry 25). Furthermore, we investigated other sulfur-containing reagents including inexpensive Na2S·9H2O, S8, and the costly S(PhSO2)2. Unfortunately, all of these afforded DTT in trace amounts (entries 26–28). We then selected cheap thioacetate as the optimum sulfur source to perform cyclization under ligand-free conditions; however, no desired product was generated (entry 29). We speculated that the coordination of ligand to copper is crucial, which may stabilize the copper-based complex intermediate at high reaction temperatures. In entry 30, the catalyst loading was reduced to half (10 mol%), and DTT could still be obtained in a good isolated yield of 85%, whereas the yield was decreased to 60% as the CuCl2 was further lowered to 5 mol% (entry 31). With the optimum reaction parameters (CuCl2, 1,10-phenanthroline, K3PO4, MeC(O)SK, p-xylene), we used 2 as substrate (the dibromo-congener of 3); however, it was found the optimized copper-catalysis was inefficient toward 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene, thus the C–S formation/cyclization hardly happened (trace amount, entry 32). In addition to copper salts, other inexpensive metal catalysts (Mn, Co, Fe) were also investigated under optimum conditions, but no desired DTT was observed (entries 33–37). Lastly, we wondered if the [Cu]-based catalytic system could be applied to prepare dithienoselenophene or dithienotellurophene. However, results given in entries 38–39 revealed that no reactions took place.

Having established a copper-catalyzed cyclization methodology to access DTT, we anticipated further extending the π-conjugation length from both ends of DTT by using similar copper salt-based catalytic conditions. As shown in Scheme 2, in contrast to the reported multistep synthesis, we planned to prepare DTT core-based oligomers, TTh10111 and CHC05, via single-step [Cu]-catalyzed direct C–H/C–I coupling reactions. In order to obtain the optimum reaction conditions, direct arylation of DTT with iodoarene 4a affording the known TTh101 was demonstrated as a model study (Table 2). According to our previously developed C–H arylation approaches for thiophene derivatives,12 firstly the direct coupling was performed in cosolvents with CuCl2, 1,10-phenanthroline, and Cs2CO3 (130 °C, 24 h) producing the desired TTh101 in unsatisfactory yields (trace–15%, entries 1–2). If the polar solvents (DMAc, DMPU) or the nonpolar one (m-xylene) were used individually, we still obtained poor conversions (trace–20%, entries 3–5). Other polar aprotic solvents such as NMP, DMSO, or o-DCB (1,2-dichlorobenzene) did not give improvements (6% yield, entry 6; trace amount, entry 7; 10% yield, entry 8). Nevertheless, based on the above results, we noticed that the experiments employing DMPU as solvent (entries 2 and 4) exhibited relatively better yields. Hence, we decided to use DMPU in subsequent screenings. From entry 9 through entry 13, we examined a series of common Cu(I) salts, showing that cuprous iodide was the optimum catalyst (39% yield, entry 11). With CuI, we were pleased to find that the yield could be significantly improved while the reaction temperature was elevated to 160 °C (67%, entry 14). Importantly, we observed a better yield when the base (Cs2CO3) was replaced with K3PO4 (78%, entry 15), presumably owing to its good solubility in general organic solvents. Stronger bases such as NaOtBu and KOtBu gave much lower yields of TTh101 (47–52%, entries 16–17). Next, in addition to L1, various oxalamide-type13 ligands (L2–L7) were tested; however, poor isolated yields were obtained (11–37%, entries 18–23). In entry 24, it was found that prolonging the reaction time to 48 h under optimum conditions did not contribute to product conversions (66% yield). Finally, the bromo-congener of 4a was employed as the coupling partner affording the desired TTh101 in only 30% yield. This implied that current [Cu]-based reaction parameters are less effective toward the direct C–H/C–Br couplings.

In order to further expand the reaction scope, direct coupling of DTT with a carbazole–triphenylamine hybrid iodoarene 4b under optimum reaction conditions (entry 15 of Table 2) was successfully achieved, thus leading to the formation of a new oligoaryl molecule, CHC05 in 61% yield (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of CHC05 under optimum reaction conditions of [Cu]-catalyzed direct C–H/C–I couplings. 
In addition, in one of our former publications describing a benzotrithiophene (BTT) core-based hole-transporting material for perovskite solar cells,14 we found that introducing a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) moiety into a π-conjugated backbone as a π-spacer can induce materials with dopant-free properties as well as promote power conversion efficiencies. Therefore, in this work, we intended to insert EDOT groups between DTT and the iodotriphenylamine derivative (4a). As shown in eqn (a) of Scheme 4, we anticipated synthesizing an EDOT-containing new building-block 4c starting from 4a by a two-step protocol. However, after step 1 realized by [Cu]-catalyzed C–H/C–I coupling,12 we failed to carry out the iodination of EDOT-TPA (5a) and eventually the desired product 4c was not obtained in eqn (b). We reasoned that compound 4c might be formed during step 2, but it was prone to decomposing shortly after purification. In light of the above results, we planned to take an alternative route to access the target EDOT-incorporated oligoaryls by exchanging one of the reaction roles with the other while conducting the [Cu]-catalyzed C–H/C–I cross-coupling; in other words, direct C–H arylation of 5a–b with a diiodo-DTT (6) would be carried out (eqn (c), Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Synthetic plans for accessing EDOT-containing new oligoaryls. 
As demonstrated in Scheme 5, EDOT-TPA (5a, 5b) proceeded to react via C–H arylations with 6 under previously optimized reaction conditions detailed in Table 2 (CuI, 1,10-phenanthroline, K3PO4, DMPU). However, in both experiments, we observed a significant amount of unreacted 6 and the monoarylated DTT predominated (I-DTT-EDOT-TPA). That is, the expected products (CHC05, CHC06) were formed in trace amounts, which were analytically invalid. Since we previously explored the solvent effect on metal-catalyzed C–H arylations in former publications,12,15 for the present reactions, we tried to change the polar aprotic DMPU to nonpolar mesitylene and the coupling reactions were performed at 160 °C for 24 h. Although the nonpolar solvent still did not lead to satisfactory results, desired CHC05 and CHC06 could be isolated in 25% and 22% yields, respectively. For the reverse type C–H/C–I cross-couplings, further screenings for acquiring more efficient catalytic conditions to improve reaction conversions would be necessary.
 Scheme 5  Preparation of CHC06 and CHC07 by a reaction-role exchanged synthetic pathway. 
In addition to the synthetic study, we also investigated the optical, electrochemical, thermal, and electrical properties of TTh101 and the three new oligoaryls CHC05–07. The corresponding results are collected in Table 3. Compared to TTh101 and CHC05, oligoaryls with π-extended EDOT moieties (CHC06, CHC07) possessed relatively smaller optical band gaps (2.39 eV). Electrochemical characteristics of each molecule were explored by performing cyclic voltammetry, indicating that CHC06 and CHC07 exhibited higher-lying HOMO energy levels (EHOMO = −5.01 eV for CHC06; EHOMO = −5.03 eV for CHC07), presumably due to the introduction of the electron-donating EDOT groups as π-spacers. In general, the EHOMO values of the four oligoaryls are higher than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (perovskite layer, EHOMO = −5.43 eV). This implied these compounds might be able to extract holes efficiently from the perovskite layer when fabricated as hole-transporting materials in perovskite solar cells. Besides, we also obtained thermal property data of the oligoaryls by conducting thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. It was found that, compared to the known TTh101, molecules with longer conjugation lengths did not contribute considerably to enhancing the decomposition temperatures (Td = 322–392 °C for CHC05–07 vs. Td = 380 °C for TTh101). Nevertheless, CHC05–07 exhibited much higher glass transition temperatures than TTh101 (Tg = 128–201 °C for CHC05–07 vs. Tg = 105 °C for TTh101). Finally, the hole mobility (μh) of oligoaryls was estimated by space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs). Importantly, we noticed that the EDOT-inserted CHC06 and CHC07 displayed higher hole mobilities than TTh101 and CHC05. All spectra regarding the above measurements are provided in the ESI.†

Next, the perovskite solar cells employing TTh101, CHC05, CHC06, or CHC07 as hole-transporting material (HTM) were fabricated and the data of their photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 4. Devices with TTh101 showed a good open-circuit voltage (Voc = 1.05 V), a moderate short-circuit current (Jsc = 17.54 mA cm−2) and fill factor (FF) of 62.08%, which led to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.41%. Compared to TTh101-based devices, CHC05-based solar cells exhibited inferior Voc and Jsc, while a much better FF of 87.99% was observed, thus giving a higher PCE of 12.45%. Solar cells with CHC06 or CHC07 showed good Voc (0.92–1.01 V) and improved Jsc (20.53–21.00 mA cm−2) and FF (68.90–71.20%), resulting in superior PCEs (13.45–14.67%) to those of the devices using TTh101 as HTM. We found that, among the four HTMs, CHC07 bearing t-butyl groups possessed the best solubility in most organic solvents including chlorobenzene used for the fabrication of hole-transport layers. This might be beneficial to a smooth film-formation during spin-coating.

Additionally, we performed the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements of each HTM molecule to investigate their hole-extraction abilities. Based on the results shown in Fig. 1, CHC06- and CHC07-based devices displayed relatively stronger PL quenching effects, suggesting that CHC06 and CHC07 could effectively extract holes from the perovskite layer [(CH3)NH3PbI3]. These results are consistent with the PCE data provided in Table 4.

Concerning the formation of the key building block, DTT, we proposed a plausible reaction mechanism for the [Cu]-catalyzed ring closure/C–S bond formation (Fig. 2). 3,3′-Diiodo-2,2′-bithiophene 3 underwent oxidative addition with Cu(I) to give intermediate A, which subsequently proceeded to a ligand substitution with MeC(O)SK to afford B. Reductive elimination of B produced C and regenerated Cu(I), which performed oxidative addition again with the other thienyl iodide, giving intermediate D. Addition–elimination of the thioacetate group of D was carried out by iodide to give E with a sulfide anion that substituted the iodide ligand of Cu(III) to form F. Analogously, reductive elimination of F yielded the desired DTT and regenerated Cu(I).

Finally, focusing again on the synthesis of the key building block, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT), we provide data to compare the cost of commercially available and homemade DTT (Table 5). The commercial ones purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI were fairly expensive (523–580 USD per gram). Those who require a large quantity of DTT (e.g. >10 grams) are suggested to carry out the synthesis themselves. Thus, we estimated that, starting from bithiophene 1, DTT prepared via n-BuLi/(PhSO2)2S ring-closure (Scheme 1, approach A)8b would cost 234 USD per gram, whereas it costs approximately 50 USD to obtain 1 gram of DTT by the present copper-catalysed methodology using inexpensive CuCl2 and MeC(O)SK (1.2 USD/gram) in the key C–S bond formation/annulation step. In addition, comparison and calculations of the E-factors regarding the conventional and new synthesis of DTT (Scheme 1) are provided in the ESI (Table S1†). The data indicated that approach C shown in this work exhibits the smallest E-factor of 74.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a copper-catalyzed C–S bond formation/annulation procedure to access the versatile π-conjugated building block, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT), utilizing inexpensive reagents including CuCl2 and MeC(O)SK. Reaction conditions were optimized, giving DTT in excellent isolated yields of up to 92%. Besides, the bidirectional π-extension from DTT was also efficiently accomplished by copper-catalyzed direct C–H arylations under optimum reaction parameters, producing three new oligoaryls CHC05–07. To demonstrate their photovoltaic applications, these molecules were fabricated as hole-transporting materials in perovskite solar cells, displaying promising PCEs of up to 14.67%. The PCEs of spiro-OMeTAD-based cells are higher than those of CHC07-based PSCs. We speculated that this result was attributed to the better film quality and sufficient hole-transfer capability of spiro-OMeTAD. The hole-mobility of spiro-OMeTAD is 1.28 × 10−4, which is higher than that of CHC07 (6.21 × 10−5). In terms of structural design, CHC07 bearing a DTT core and EDOT π-spacers is relatively simpler to synthesize because the spiro-type moiety/molecules are generally more difficult to produce. Therefore, we suggest the introduction of appropriate π-spacers such as EDOT to the backbone of oligoaryls would considerably improve the thermal properties and photovoltaic performances.14 For future molecular designs, it would be worth trying to insert other π-spacers like 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT), olefins, or acetylenes between core- and end-groups. The design and preparation of new functional π-conjugated small molecules for optoelectronic applications by efficient and novel synthetic approaches16 are currently underway in our laboratory.
Experimental
General procedure for the synthesis of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT)
To a solution of CuCl2 (10–20 mol%), 1,10-phenanthroline (10–20 mol%), potassium thioacetate (1.50 mmol) and K3PO4 (1.50 mmol) in p-xylene (2.0 mL) in a dried Schlenk tube was added 3,3′-diiodo-2,2′-bithiophene 3 (1.00 mmol) under N2. The reaction mixture was then heated at 130 °C under N2 for 16 hours. After the reaction mixture had cooled to room temperature, water (10 mL) was added. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 30 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine (50 mL), dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by flash chromatography (hexanes) afforded the desired product DTT in 85–92% isolated yields (entries 30 and 21 of Table 1).
