    , Accepted 26th January 2019First published on 29th January 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) perovskite micro/nanostructures have drawn considerable attention worldwide for their unique optoelectronic properties and promising applications in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. In this article, syntheses of 2D propylammonium lead halide perovskite microstructures are reported. The iodine-containing perovskite exhibits a flower-like hierarchical morphology with the “petals” consisting of approximately vertical-crossing ribbons. This compound possesses the chemical formula (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14, with the structure consisting of both corner-sharing and face-sharing PbI6 octahedra to complete the 2D network. The hydrogen-bonding interactions between organic group C3H7NH3+ and bilateral nearest-neighboring perovskite sheets are deemed to be responsible for this structure. By contrast, the lead bromide perovskite displays a plate-like morphology and bears the formula (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4, with its structure containing purely corner-sharing PbBr6 octahedra. Optical measurements indicate that a more evident 2D exciton feature can be observed in (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 than in (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. For (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4, photoluminescence (PL) measurement displays a strong emission peak at 419 nm, stemming from free exciton transition. PL decay analysis of the free exciton in (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 shows its lifetime of about 16.4 ns. Our successful syntheses and preliminary optical investigations on such 2D perovskite nanostructures offer a new material for research on the fundamental properties of 2D perovskites and their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have attracted significant interest for their photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.1,2 As two-dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskites are essentially natural multi-quantum wells with charge carriers mainly confined in the 2D crystal planes, they display a very large exciton binding energy of a few hundreds of meV. For instance, 2D perovskites (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 and (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 have an exciton binding energy around 220 meV (ref. 3 and 4) and 480 meV (ref. 5), respectively, significantly higher than those of their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts (5–16 meV)6–8 and the ionization energy at room temperature (26 meV). Therefore, normally, 2D perovskites exhibit very important optical properties, such as sharp exciton emission at room temperature, high-efficiency electroluminescence and large third-order optical nonlinearity. It was reported that the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbBr4 thin film reaches 34%, much larger than that of its 3D counterpart (2–3%).9 The external quantum efficiency of a light emitting diode (LED) using a 2D perovskite as an optical absorption layer reaches up to 11.7%, far beyond its 3D counterpart (3.5%).10 2D perovskites have also attracted great attention in photovoltaic devices owing to their superior ambient stability. A respectable power conversion efficiency of 12.52% was obtained for 2D layered (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)3Pb4I13 perovskite solar cells. Most importantly, the 2D perovskite devices demonstrate greatly improved long-term stability in contrast to their 3D counterparts when subjected to light, humidity and heat stress.11 In addition, 2D perovskites have shown significant promise in photodetectors,12 field-effect transistors,13 broadband solid-state lighting,14 and ferroelectric15 and dielectric applications.16
Ever since the existence of some relevant reports in the 1980s,17 a large variety of methods, including spin coating,18 vacuum vapor deposition,19 two-step dip processing,20 anti-solvent vapour-assisted crystallization,21 slowly cooling down the saturated solution22 and solvent evaporation methods,23 have been developed for the preparation of 2D perovskite thin films and bulk single crystals. These perovskites have demonstrated superior optical, electrical, magnetic and optoelectronic properties and have become a hot research topic in the field of semiconductor materials and devices.24 Apart from the rapid progress of the 2D perovskite thin films and bulk single crystals, considerable attention has also been focused on nanostructured 2D perovskites for their unique optoelectronic properties and promising applications in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Yang's group25 reported ultra-thin (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4 nanoplates with well-defined square shape together with a PLQY of 26%, much larger than that of its bulk counterpart (<1%). We previously reported shape-controlled syntheses of 2D perovskite nanostructures of (C6H5CnH2nNH3)2PbX4 (n = 1, 2; X = Br, I).26,27 With regard to the nanostructured perovskite syntheses, the perovskite formation processes play a key role in determining their final device performances. Therefore, the shape-controlled syntheses of perovskite nanostructures have received heightened attention.
In this article, we report the syntheses of 2D propylammonium lead halide perovskite microstructures. We found that the I-containing perovskite exhibits a flower-like hierarchical morphology with the “petals” consisting of approximately vertical-crossing ribbons and adopts the chemical formula (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. We gave a very detailed explanation on the growth mechanism of this kind of microstructure based on its crystal structure and time-dependent experiments. By contrast, the Br-containing perovskite displays a plate-like morphology and possesses the most common chemical formula (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4. Preliminary optical measurements show a more evident 2D exciton feature in (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 than in (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. As for (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4, PL measurement displays a strong emission peak at 419 nm, coming from free exciton transition. PL decay analysis of the free exciton in (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 shows its lifetime of about 16.4 ns. To our knowledge, few research studies on the syntheses and optical properties of propylammonium lead halide were reported previously.28–31 Our research reports a new material to explore its fundamental properties and potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
2. Experimental
Starting materials
HI (57 wt% in H2O, 99.99%), HBr (48 wt% in H2O, ≥99.99%), propylamine (≥99%), PbAc2·3H2O (99.999%), isopropanol (≥99.5%) and diethyl ether (≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The C3H7NH3X (X = Br, I) precursor was synthesized with a similar method reported previously.26,27 To put it simply, first, HI (or HBr) was added slowly to an equal molar ratio of propylamine in a flask at 0 °C. Then, the solution was evaporated at 100 °C until propylammonium halide crystals precipitated from the solution. After the solution cooled down, the powder product was filtered and rinsed with diethyl ether several times before it was dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for one day to remove the residual water.
Syntheses
PbAc2 thin film was first prepared by drop-casting 100 mg mL−1 PbAc2·3H2O aqueous solution on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate, and then dried in an oven for 30 min at 60 °C. After that, the PbAc2 film-coated substrate was immersed into C3H7NH3X solution in isopropanol (IPA) with various concentrations from 2.5 mg mL−1 to 60 mg mL−1 at room temperature. After a specified reaction time, the FTO substrate was taken out and dipped into IPA to remove any leftover solution on the sample, and then dried under a stream of nitrogen flow.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a LEO SUPRA 55 VP field-emission SEM operated at 3.0 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were carried out with a LEO 1530 field-emission SEM equipped with an EDS detector operating at 15.0 kV. Optical images were obtained with an Olympus BX51M optical microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were executed with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.54056 Å) on a Siemens STOE diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA). The optical absorption spectra were recorded between 375 nm and 900 nm with a UV-3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Instruments). The PL excitation (PLE) and PL spectra were measured with a FLS 980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a xenon lamp as the excitation source, and a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-405, excitation wavelength 400.2 nm, pulse width: 57.3 ps) was employed for lifetime measurement.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a–h) show the SEM images of the as-synthesized samples grown at varying C3H7NH3I/IPA concentrations from 2.5 to 60 mg mL−1 for 10 h. At a low C3H7NH3I concentration of 2.5 mg mL−1, we noticed that the substrate was mostly covered with plates measuring 5–7 μm in diameter and 0.05–0.3 μm in thickness, in which some plates possess a well-defined hexagonal shape, and some plates coalesce into spindle-like aggregates. The corresponding XRD pattern in Fig. 1(i) (black curve) displays clear diffraction peaks, ascribed to (001), (011), (102) and (110) peaks of the PbI2 phase, except that a little peak marked “black dot” at a 2θ value of 8.04° is unclear. This indicates that PbAc2 converts to PbI2 mostly at this concentration. When the C3H7NH3I/IPA concentration was increased to 5 mg mL−1, some rod-like structures together with some well-defined hexagons were observed on top of the substrate, where the hexagons should be the PbI2 phase, as seen in Fig. 1(a). The diffraction pattern of this sample (red curve in Fig. 1(i)) shows broad halos in the low 2θ range, suggesting that the sample is mostly composed of amorphous states. With a continued increase of the precursor concentration to 10 mg mL−1, some ribbon-like superstructures and columns with sizes of several micrometers form on top of the substrate. The products grown at a precursor concentration of 20 mg mL−1 typically exhibit a flower-like hierarchical morphology with the “petals” consisting of approximately vertical-crossing ribbons (Fig. 1(d and e) and S1†). The crossing ribbons are assembled together to form a knot at one end (Fig. 1(f)). A higher precursor concentration (30–80 mg mL−1) leads to the overgrowth of the flowers, more ribbons intertwine and cross to form “petals”, and more “petals” organize to the flowers ultimately (Fig. 1(g and h) and S2†). XRD peaks of the products grown at the precursor concentration >10 mg mL−1 (Fig. 1(i)) match well with those of a newly reported layered perovskite of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14.31 The peaks at 2θ values of 6.11°, 9.31°, 12.01°, 24.16° and 36.59° are attributed to the (011), (021), (002), (004) and (006) lattice planes of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14, respectively.

(i) Corresponding XRD patterns of the samples synthesized at varying C3H7NH3I/IPA concentrations of 2.5–60 mg mL−1 (note: the peak marked “•” is unclear). 
EDX measurements were carried out to determine the elemental constituents in the (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 ribbon. Elements I and Pb were found clearly in a representative EDX spectrum of an individual ribbon (Fig. S3(a)†). Elements C and O may come from the surface contamination and oxidation of the sample. The qualitative result of 15 individual ribbons gives an average atomic ratio of 3.3/1 for I/Pb (Fig. S3(b)†), reasonably in agreement with the stoichiometry of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. EDX elemental mapping of an individual (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 ribbon (Fig. S3(c–e)†) shows uniform spatial distribution of I and Pb throughout the ribbon.
To explore the formation process of ribbon-like (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 flowers in solution, the effect of reaction time on the crystal growth of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 was studied, where the precursor concentration of C3H7NH3I was fixed at 20 mg mL−1. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the samples grown at the reaction times of 1 min–5 h together with their corresponding XRD patterns. At the reaction time of 1 min, some aggregates with irregular shape form on top of the substrate (Fig. 2(a)). The corresponding diffraction peaks marked “solid triangle” can be ascribed to a basic lead acetate (3PbAc2·PbO·H2O) phase (black trace in Fig. 2(e)) without other phases detected. This is reasonable considering the partial hydrolysis of lead acetate.32,33 The product at the reaction time of 10 min shows a few ribbon-like structures with polyporous texture sparsely distributed on the substrate (Fig. 2(b) and the inset figure). The phase of basic lead acetate still dominates at this moment, but the peak intensity decreases sharply (red curve in Fig. 2(f)), presumably due to the dissolution of lead acetate and generation of certain amorphous structure. When the reaction time was further prolonged to 1 h, many ribbons generate, with the tendency to adhere together on one side (Fig. 2(c)). The morphology of this product is similar to that at the time of 10 h (Fig. 1(d)). However, the corresponding XRD pattern (blue curve in Fig. 2(f)) is apparently different from the one at 10 h (pink pattern in Fig. 2(f)), with the former exhibiting new peaks labeled “circle” besides the peaks from unreacted basic lead acetate. Based on similar morphologies between the former and the latter, we speculate that the new peaks are from a different intermediate phase as the final product of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. It is assumed that the intermediate phase presents an approximately amorphous state but similar chemical constituents to (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 from the crystalizing process of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. The product characterization at lengthened times of 2–5 h supports this speculation, featuring a loose sponge structure at 2 h (Fig. 2(d)) to a coarse and porous structure at 5 h (Fig. 2(e)), and the corresponding XRD patterns displaying very small diffraction peaks attributed to the same intermediate phase as above (brown and cyan curves in Fig. 2(f)). No lead acetate was detected by XRD measurement at this duration, suggesting the complete conversion of lead acetate. Finally, the crystal structures of the (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 flowers evolve and become much denser in texture (Fig. 1(d–f)).

(d and e) are the magnified SEM images for the reaction times of 2 h and 5 h, respectively. (f) Corresponding XRD patterns of the products grown at different times (the XRD pattern at 10 h corresponding to the pink curve in Fig. 1(i) was redrawn in (f) in order to facilitate a comparison. Note: The peaks marked “▲” are from a phase of basic lead acetate, and the peaks marked “○” are from an intermediate phase). 
To clarify the growth mechanism of ribbon-like (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 superstructures, we start to show the crystal structure of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 first, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a and b). Differing from purely corner-sharing PbX6 (X = Cl, Br or I) octahedra extensively existing in 2D perovskites with the chemical formula (RNH3)2PbX4 (R = long-chain alkyl or aromatic group), the structure of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 consists of face-sharing PbI6 octahedral dimers, with the dimers connected to each other in a corner-sharing mode to organize a 2D layered network (see below Fig. 3(a and b)).31 The hydrogen bonding between the organic group C3H7NH3+ and the inorganic sheet of [PbI6]4− octahedra is the main driving interaction responsible for the final crystal structure.27,34 The length of the organic cations obviously influences the perovskite sheet spacing and consequently the hydrogen bonding scheme. Normally, a long-chain organic group with four or more C atoms makes the effective hydrogen bonding interaction only occur between the organic group and the halogens in one single perovskite layer, thus leading to the formation of Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite with such a commonly-seen formula as (RNH3)2PbX4. Yet, a short-chain amine of C3H7NH3+ has the chance to hydrogen-bond to bilateral nearest-neighboring perovskite sheets (Fig. 3(a)), with its organic tail (–C3H7) extending into the interlayer space. For the relatively spacious [PbI4]2− framework, the resulting inorganic layer is then twisted as the highly-stable dimeric units of [Pb2I7]3− corner-connecting in an alternating trans fashion (Fig. 3(a and b)).

According to Gibbs–Wulff theorem, the lattice plane with lower surface energy generally exhibits a relative lower growth rate and can be preserved during crystal growth. The inorganic layer consists of corner- and face-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra, it grows along the a–b crystallographic plane shown in Fig. 3(b). During the crystal growth of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14, this inorganic layer should be a lower surface energy plane since it is sheathed on both sides by the organic cations of C3H7NH3+ and kept electrical neutrality. This plane is conserved and shown as the ribbon surface in Fig. 1(e and f). The periodic bond chain (PBC) theory declares that a crystal often grows along the bond chain and demonstrates a faster growth rate along the direction of the stronger chemical bond.35 Along the b-axis shown in Fig. 3(b), the [Pb2I7]3− dimers are linked one by one in a corner-sharing mode, and the Pb–I chemical bonds along this direction are stronger than those along the a-axis where one half Pb–I bonds are relevant to the face-sharing [Pb2I7]3− dimers, because the Pb–I bond lengths to corner-sharing I atoms (3.101–3.189 Å) are shorter than those to face-sharing I atoms (3.237–3.371 Å). Therefore, the (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 grows as ribbons with the longest axis being the b-axis.
The precursor concentration dependence shows that the C3H7NH3I concentration has an important influence on the final product. At a high concentration of C3H7NH3I/IPA larger than 10 mg mL−1, 2D perovskite (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 is the main product, while a low precursor concentration such as 2.5 mg mL−1 yields the dominant product of PbI2. Based on the reaction time-dependent experiments and the crystal structure of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14, the chemical reactions during the formation process of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 can be hypothesized as follows: PbAc2(s) + 4I−(sol) → PbI42−(sol) + 2Ac−(sol)(1) 4PbI42−(sol) + 6C3H7NH3+(sol) → (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14(s) + 2I−(sol)(2)
The schematic illustration depicting the structural evolution of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 is shown in Fig. 3(c). Firstly, the predeposited PbAc2 thin film reacts with I− in solution to generate dissolved [PbI4]2− complex-ions. Then the [PbI4]2− complex-ions are organized into [PbI4]2− octahedral layers in a corner-sharing mode by the C3H7NH3+ cation hydrogen-bonding interactions. On the one hand, the relatively short –C3H7 chain provides the possibility of the C3H7NH3+ cation hydrogen-bonding to its bilateral adjacent [PbI4]2− octahedral layers. On the other hand, the corner-sharing [PbI4]2− octahedral layer needs to adjust its relatively flat framework gradually in order to hold the organic tails simultaneously. The combined effects of the two aspects finally lead to the corrugated framework organized by corner-connecting highly-stable [Pb2I7]3− dimers instead of [PbI4]2− octahedra. The gradual adjustment process requires a relatively long time and corresponds to a nearly amorphous state—the so-called “intermediate phase” mentioned above, which can be reflected by the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2(f) (brown and cyan curves).
During the ribbon growth, some dangling bonds in the b–c plane appear, the ribbon accordingly tends to attach to the other to reduce its free energy, leading to vertical-crossing ribbons as stated above (Fig. 1(d and e) and S1†). Likewise, the crossing-ribbons assemble together at one end to minimize surface energy, causing the ultimate hierarchical ribbon-like flowers. In addition, the reaction time for generating (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 is much longer than the time for 2D perovskites with the formula (RNH3)2PbI4. As displayed in Fig. 2(f), the time of 5 h is still insufficient for forming (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. However, a mere 30 min can bring about the formation of (C6H5CH2NH3)2PbI4.27 Obviously, the corrugated structure of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 formed by C3H7NH3+ hydrogen-bonding to both neighboring inorganic sheets displays a much higher energy barrier for unreacted C3H7NH3+ cations and iodide species diffusing through this structure to reach the unreacted PbAc2 starting material underneath the structure of (RNH3)2PbI4 with a van der Waals gap, thus the diffusion of the reacting species proceeds much slower.
In the following, we used C3H7NH3Br to replace the C3H7NH3I precursor to study the crystalline behavior of Br-containing perovskite. The upper image in Fig. 4 shows an optical microscopy image of the sample grown at a C3H7NH3Br/IPA concentration of 40 mg mL−1 for 8 h. We noticed that some microplates formed on the substrate, completely different from the ribbon-like morphology of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. The matching XRD pattern in the bottom image of Fig. 4 displays a series of almost equally spaced peaks at 2θ values of 7.03°, 14.07°, 21.17°, 28.38° and 35.66° between 5–40°, which can be attributed to (00 l) (l = 1–5) diffraction peaks of a 2D layered perovskite with the commonly-seen formula (RNH3)2PbX4, so here, the 2D perovskite should be (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4. The product synthesized at a low C3H7NH3Br concentration of 5 mg mL−1 also exhibits a plate-like morphology and a crystal structure of (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 (Fig. S4†). This kind of plate-like morphology is reasonable and very common for 2D perovskite with chemical formula (RNH3)2PbX4 (X = Cl, Br and I) in terms of its crystal structure consisting of neutral organic–inorganic–organic (RNH3)2PbX4 sandwiches, with van der Waals forces between the tails of the organic cations holding the sandwiches to form a full 3D structure.26 Moreover, according to Pauling's third crystal rule, the formation of edge-, especially face-sharing PbX6 octahedra, are unfavored in contrast to that of the corner-sharing PbX6 octahedra, because the configuration of the former decreases the stability of the crystal structure due to the fact that the cations in the edge/face-sharing octahedral centers are in closer proximity to each other, so that cation–cation (Pb2+–Pb2+) electrostatic repulsion is increased.36 Comparing the Br- with the above discussed I-containing layered perovskites, the smaller ionic radius of Br− (1.96 Å) than that of I− (2.20 Å) makes the distance of Pb2+–Pb2+ occupying the given face-sharing PbBr6 octahedron centers closer than that from the face-sharing PbI6 octahedra, thus the electrostatic repulsion of the former is much larger than that of the latter, which leads to the instability of the given face-sharing PbBr6 octahedra. The presence of face-sharing PbI6 octahedra was also found in other perovskites such as (CH3CH2NH3)PbI3 (ref. 37) and (C6H5(CH2)nNH3)3Pb2I7 (n = 3, 4).38 In contrast, the perovskites containing face-sharing PbBr6 octahedra are rarely reported.

Due to the quantum confinement existing in lead halide perovskite layers, the layered perovskites show superb optical properties such as high quantum efficiency and narrow emission peaks,4,26 which are attractive for light-emitting applications. Preliminary investigations on the optical properties of the 2D perovskites were made to explore their potential optical applications. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the absorption peak of (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 is located at the wavelength of 401 nm, which is well consistent with previous reports on (RNH3)2PbBr4 (for example R = C4H9NH3+, C6H5CH2NH3+ or C6H5C2H4NH3+) with the values around 400 nm.39,40 Nevertheless, (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 exhibits an absorption peak at 500 nm, smaller than those of (RNH3)2PbI4 (R = C4H9NH3+, C6H5CH2NH3+ or C6H5C2H4NH3+) with the absorption peaks around 520 nm.36–41 This is reasonable because the presence of face-sharing [Pb2I7]3− dimers induces additional confinement effect that enhances the blueshift from the 2D confinement effect.34 PL tests show strong emission peaks for (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4, but none from (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. On the one hand, the electronegativity of Br (3.0) is larger than that of I (2.7), which makes the Br-containing compound of (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 fabricate a 2D confinement easier than its I counterpart.23 On the other hand, the more complicated crystal growth process of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 discussed above together with more complex inorganic layers containing face-sharing [Pb2I7]3− dimers leads to the possible presence of shallow trapping levels or localized strains inside the crystals, which generally behave as nonradiative recombination centers.34Fig. 5(b) shows the PL spectrum as well as the PLE spectrum of (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4. The PLE spectrum shows a maximum emission at around 375 nm. Hence, a 375 nm wavelength light source was used to excite the PL spectrum at room temperature, and a strong emission peak at 419 nm, stemming from free exciton transition,27,42 was observed in the PL spectrum of (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 (Fig. 5(b)). The PL decay curve of the free exciton emission (recorded at the wavelength of 419 nm) in (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 is shown in Fig. 5(c). From this curve, the lifetime τ1/e (the time taken for the PL falling to 1/e of its initial intensity) of the free exciton was evaluated to be about 16.4 ns.

4. Conclusions
We reported the syntheses of 2D propylammonium lead halide perovskite microstructures by a solution route. The precursor concentration plays an important role in the final product. For the iodine compound, the concentration of C3H7NH3I larger than 10 mg mL−1 leads to the formation of 2D perovskite with a flower-like hierarchical morphology and the chemical formula (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. EDX analysis gives an average atomic ratio of 3.3/1 for I/Pb, in reasonable agreement with the stoichiometry of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14. The growth mechanism of this compound was elucidated in depth in terms of its crystal structure and time-dependent experiments. The hydrogen-bonding interactions between organic group C3H7NH3+ and bilateral nearest-neighboring perovskite sheets are deemed to be responsible for this structure. The bromide-containing compound displays a plate-like morphology and possesses the formula (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4. Optical absorption spectra show that the absorption peaks of (C3H7NH3)6Pb4I14 and (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 are located at the wavelengths of 500 nm and 401 nm, respectively. The PL spectrum of (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 displays a strong emission peak at 419 nm, stemming from free exciton transition. PL decay analysis of the free exciton in (C3H7NH3)2PbBr4 shows its lifetime of about 16.4 ns.
