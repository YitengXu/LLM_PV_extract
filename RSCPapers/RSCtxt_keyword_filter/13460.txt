    , Accepted 12th October 2012First published on 15th October 2012AbstractA low band-gap copolymer PDTBTFV alternating bis-thienyl-(bis-alkoxy)-benzothiadiazole blocks with difluorovinylene units and its non-fluorinated counterpart PDTBTV have been synthesized and characterized as donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with PCBM as the acceptor. The solar cells with the fluorinated polymer show better photovoltaic performances than those recorded with the non-fluorinated material. Comparative spectroscopic and computational studies, together with morphological, electrical and optical characterization of thin films, have been carried out to shed light on the reasons for the improvement of performances as induced by the double bond fluorination. Our study introduces the fluorinated double bond as a new conjugated unit in donor polymers for BHJ solar cells.
Introduction
Fast progress has been recorded in the last few years in the development of polymer solar cells (PSCs) as an alternative to traditional silicon-based photovoltaics.1 Although the efficiency and lifetime of organic-based devices still remain lower than those of silicon solar cells, inexpensive and fast processing as well as the possibility to fabricate coloured and semitransparent photovoltaic modules on flexible platforms make the new technology suitable for many applications, and continuous improvements are expected in the near future. The BHJ solar cells based on a π-conjugated polymer donor blended with an electron acceptor (most commonly a soluble fullerene derivative, for example [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)),1,2 are one of the most effective device configurations in organic photovoltaics. The advantages of this approach for fast production of large area devices have been recently extended by roll-to-roll fabrication of plastic solar cells.3
The main factors that still limit the BHJ PSC performances and prevent their wide commercialization are the not optimized efficiency and the low chemical stability of the organic active layer.4 Strong research efforts are devoted to design and synthesize donor polymers that are able to overcome the current limitations. An electron donor material must have the following characteristics: (a) light absorption matching as much as possible the solar spectrum for effective harvesting of the solar photons; (b) high extinction coefficient; (c) proper alignment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with respect to the acceptor;5 (d) good exciton and positive charge (holes) transport properties; and (e) thermal and chemical stability to optimize the device lifetime.
Hereby, the morphology of the BHJ active layer plays an important role favouring exciton transport and dissociation as well as the transport of separated charges to the respective electrodes,6 thus increasing the open circuit voltage (Voc).7
An important difference of organic semiconductors compared to inorganic ones is the generally poor charge-carrier mobility. However, organic semiconductors have a relatively strong absorption coefficient (usually ≥ 105 cm−1), which partially balances the low mobility, giving effective light absorption also in active films thinner than 100 nm.8 The efficiency of BHJ solar cells is also limited by the short exciton diffusion length (i.e. the distance over which excitons travel before undergoing deactivation), which is about 3–10 nm in most organic semiconductors.8 Excitons formed at a distance from the donor–acceptor interfaces longer than the exciton diffusion length have a lower probability of being harvested. As a consequence, the active volume of this type of solar cells is limited to a very thin region close to the donor–acceptor interfaces; thus the increase of the absorption coefficient of the polymeric donor material matching the solar emission spectrum is a key target.
Based on these considerations, an ideal donor polymer to be blended with PCBM in BHJ configuration must exhibit a low band gap (between 1.2 and 1.9 eV), with the HOMO energy level between −5.2 and −5.8 eV and the LUMO energy level near −3.8/−4.0 eV to ensure an efficient charge separation, maximizing the Voc.9
Several low band gap polymers have been reported in the recent literature; these mainly include homopolymers, donor–acceptor polymers and quinoid polymers.1d–g A record average efficiency of 7.4% has been achieved in a single layer configuration using copolymers based on benzodithiophene (PTB) derivatives blended with phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)10 and the present record laboratory efficiency of over 8.6% has been measured with a tandem device configuration.11
The introduction of double bonds in the conjugated backbone of semiconducting polymers has been proposed as a structural modification to reduce the band gap as in poly(phenylenevinylene)s (PPVs)2a,b,12 and poly(thienylenevinylene)s (PTVs).13 The vinylene units increase the effective conjugation length by inducing planarization of the polymeric backbone, thus decreasing the band gap and extending the absorption in the low energy spectral region. In fact, the effect of double bonds in donor polymers for BHJ solar cells has been investigated especially as a bridge between donor and acceptor units in donor–acceptor type low band gap polymers.14
We have recently reported general synthetic methods for arylenevinylene oligomers and polymers containing fluorinated double bonds as conjugation units.15 The spectroscopic and optoelectronic properties15h–j of the resulting materials have been studied, also with the support of theoretical calculations,15g in comparison with those of the non-fluorinated counterparts. The results have shown that the fluorination of the double bond can tune optoelectronic properties and solid state organization and it can improve the material lifetime in devices, in comparison with the corresponding non-fluorinated materials.15j
Starting from these results, here we extend our investigation to the impact of the fluorinated double bond on the photovoltaic performances of donor arylenevinylene polymers in BHJ solar cells. We have synthesized two soluble conjugated polymers alternating the double bonds (either fluorinated or non-fluorinated) with bis-thienyl-bis-alkoxybenzothiadiazole units. The results of the synthesis, spectroscopic and computational studies, electro-optical and morphological characterizations are reported in this article, emphasizing the impact of the fluorination of double bonds on the spectroscopic, solid state and photovoltaic properties of the resulting donor polymer in BHJ solar cells with PCBM as the acceptor. Our study demonstrates that the fluorinated vinylene unit can represent a suitable structural motif to increase the performances of donor polymers in BHJ solar cells, and opens the way to entirely new families of materials for polymeric photovoltaics.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The monomers M1 (ref. 16) and M2 (ref. 15a) were synthesized following the procedures reported in the literature. The monomer M3 was synthesized as outlined in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for the monomer M3. 
1,2-Bis(octyloxy)benzene 1 was obtained by a standard alkylation of catechol with bromooctane in acetone at reflux. Nitration of compound 1 affords 1,2-bis(octyloxy)-4,5-dinitrobenzene 2 in high yield. Reduction of compound 2 was performed with Pd/C and H2 in ethanol at 2 atm.17 The resulting 1,2-bis(octyloxy)-4,5-diaminobenzene (unstable) was immediately treated with thionyl chloride and triethyl amine in dichloromethane18 to yield benzothiadiazole 3 that was, in turn, brominated with bromine in acetic acid and sodium acetate to give dibromobenzothiadiazole 4 in high yield.19 Compound 4 was reacted with 2-tributylstannylthiophene by the Stille cross-coupling, in refluxing toluene using PdCl2(PPh3)2 as the catalyst, obtaining compound 5 as a highly fluorescent yellow solid. Finally, the treatment of compound 5 with N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) in chloroform and acetic acid at room temperature gave the monomer M3 as an orange solid in 98% yield.
Poly[5,5-(5′,6′-di-octyloxy-4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)-alt-1,2-vinylene] PDTBTV and poly[5,5-(5′,6′-di-octyloxy-4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)-alt-1,2-difluorovinylene] PDTBTFV were synthesized via the Stille cross-coupling reaction between M3 and M1 or M2, respectively (Scheme 2). Polymerizations were performed with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, and CuI in a stoichiometric amount at room temperature in a mixture of DMF–THF as the solvent, for 1 week. End capping with iodobenzene removes the tributyltin terminal groups. The polymers were purified by washing the crude products in a Soxhlet apparatus with hexane and methanol. A final extraction with chloroform yields the pure polymers as dark-violet (PDTBTV) and dark-blue (PDTBTFV) powders in good yields (70% and 75%, respectively). Both the polymers are soluble in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). The average molecular weights were determined by conventional size exclusion chromatography (SEC), with polystyrene narrow standards calibration and chlorobenzene as the mobile phase, and the results are shown in Table 1 together with optical and electrochemical data which are discussed below.

PDTBTV shows only limited variations in the photovoltaic parameters with the D/A ratio, always maintaining quite low Voc and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The best performances were measured with a 2:7 (D:A) weight ratio. PDTBTFV shows better photovoltaic performances with significantly higher Voc and PCE values (0.73–0.83 V and 0.83–1.24%, respectively) compared to PDTBTV (Voc 0.43–0.56 V and PCE 0.33–0.53%, respectively) for all the measured weight ratios. For PDTBTFV the most efficient devices were obtained by mixing the donor and acceptor in a 1:1 weight ratio.
Thermal annealing of the active layer in the temperature range 70–150 °C does not significantly affect the photovoltaic performances of both polymers, in agreement with both the lack of any transition in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of donor polymer and of the almost negligible modification of the blend morphology with the temperature.

J–V curves of the solar cells and power voltage characteristics of the solar cells based on PDTBTV and PDTBTFV are shown in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively.

Polymer properties in solution

Molecular geometry. 
The calculated structure for model oligomers of both polymers in the gas phase shows an anti-arrangement of the thiophene rings against the thiadiazole ring (Fig. 3), stabilized against the syn-form by 10.2 kJ mol−1 (0.106 eV), due to (non-bonding) S–O interactions similar to the case of PEDOT.20
 Fig. 3  Chemical structure of PDTBTV and PDTBTFV, geometry of oligomers with m = 1, 4. 
The thiadiazole ring drives the conformation somewhat out of co-planarity; however, packing forces are expected to overcome this barrier to effectively planarize the backbone in the solid state. The alkoxy groups point almost perpendicular to the plane of the conjugated backbone.


Optical spectra in solution. 
The absorption spectrum of PDTBTFV in solution shows a broad, unstructured main absorption band at around 550 nm, whereas the spectrum of PDTBTV is somewhat red-shifted (Fig. 4). The long wavelength side shows a pronounced shoulder centered at 660 nm for PDTBTFV and 690 nm for PDTBTV.
 Fig. 4  Normalized absorbance (solid) and PL excitation (dashed) spectra of PDTBTFV (red) and PDTBTV (blue) in ODCB solutions; thin film absorption spectra (thickness = 15 nm) are shown for comparison (dotted line). 
In order to check whether the shoulder is an intramolecular property (owing to an electronic state with small oscillator strength) or an intermolecular property through aggregates, we recorded a PLE spectrum, which allows for photo-selection if the quantum yield of the single chain is considerably higher than that of the aggregates. Indeed, the PLE spectra in Fig. 4 do not show the shoulder, and thus they represent the absorption features of the dissolved chain. Therefore, the shoulder is assigned to some (minor) aggregation, which is still present despite the low concentrations, longer dissolution time and use of a good solvent (ODCB).
This is fully supported by the comparison with the film absorption spectra, also given in Fig. 4, which resemble the position of the aggregate shoulder in the solution spectra. From the PLE spectra the absorption maxima of the dissolved chains can be determined to be 548 nm (2.26 eV) for PDTBTFV and 569 nm (2.18 eV) for PDTBTV, resulting in a fluorination-induced blue-shift of 0.07 eV. Such blue-shifts were observed before and ascribed to the specific interplay of the mesomeric (+M) and inductive (−I) character of the fluorine atom, which can each dominate the effect depending on the nature of the backbone21,22 and substituent position.23
The shift agrees very well with the one calculated by TD-DFT (Fig. 5), although the absolute values are underestimated both by the B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP functional. This is due to the inherent limitation of the TD-DFT calculations with standard functionals, overestimating long-range interactions. Although CAM-B3LYP clearly gives better results, the difference with experiment (−0.2 eV) is still significant.
 Fig. 5  TD-DFT calculated chain length dependence of the absorption maxima for PDTBTFV (blue) and PDTBTV (red) oligomers (mDTBTFV, mDTBTV, with m = number of repetition units), employing the CAM-/B3LYP functionals as a function of 1/m, which relates to the number of double bonds N along the conjugated path as m = 7N.24 Experimental polymer values in solution are shown as squares; solid lines are Kuhn fits25 for m ≥ 2 according to E = a{1 + bcos(π/(N + 1))}1/2. Inset: TD-DFT (CAM-B3LYP) calculated absorption spectra of 4DTBTFV (blue) and 4DTBTV (red) oligomers, depicting the first 20 electronic states (broadened by a Lorentzian, half-width 0.5 eV). 
The extinction coefficient was estimated from absorption measurements on solutions with defined concentration, considering the molar mass of the repeating units (MPDTBTV = 580 g mol−1, MPDTBTFV = 616 g mol−1), which gives εPDTBTV = 2.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and εPDTBTFV = 3.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. In any case, the unknown degree of aggregation makes an exact determination difficult; from the quantum-chemical calculation (Fig. 5), PDTBTFV might have just a slightly higher extinction coefficient (ca. 3%).
According to the TD-DFT calculation the main absorption band is ascribed to the symmetry allowed S1 ← S0 transition, mainly described by a HOMO → LUMO excitation but showing some minor contributions of higher excitations. While the HOMO is rather delocalized over the molecular backbone (Fig. 6), the LUMO is strongly localized in the benzothiadiazole unit due to its acceptor properties; these effects however depend strongly on the specific electronic properties of the donor and acceptor fragments.26
 Fig. 6  MO topologies of the PDTBTFV oligomers (m = 1, 4). 
The admixing of higher excitation states is not observed for the monomer (m = 1). This change in the CI (configuration interaction) description is the obvious reason why the chain length dependence of the main absorption cannot be fitted with a 2-parameter Kuhn equation; the latter works both for PDTBTV and PDTBTFV only for m ≥ 2 (Fig. 5). This result shows once more that simple conclusions of polymer properties from monomer calculations, as frequently done,27 are not always possible.

Thin film properties

Electrochemical characterization. 
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels in thin films of the two polymers were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the results are summarized in Table 1. The CV measurements were carried out using 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in dry acetonitrile. Cyclic voltammograms of the PDTBTFV and PDTBTV thin films are shown in Fig. S10 of the ESI.† Both polymers present two sequential irreversible oxidation peaks in the range from +1.0 to +2.0 V and a reversible reduction process with peaks between −1.0 and −1.5 V. In particular, anodic peaks relative to PDTBTV are at +1.27 V and +1.64 V, while those of PDTBTFV are at +1.67 V and +1.86 V. Cathodic peaks are at −1.33 V, −1.23 V and −1.06 V for PDTBTV and at −1.21 V and −1.13 V for PDTBTFV, respectively. The estimated HOMO energy levels (based on Koopmans theorem) is −5.20 eV for PDTBTFV and −5.01 eV for PDTBTV, while the LUMO energy level is −3.14 eV for PDTBTFV and −3.03 eV for PDTBTV. The electrochemical energy gap Eg, calculated as the difference between the HOMO and LUMO energies, is 2.06 eV for PDTBTFV and 1.98 eV for PDTBTV, respectively. Hence the effect of fluoro-functionalization of the double bond is an overall stabilization of both HOMO and LUMO energy levels; similar values for the frontier MOs as well as for oxidation potentials and electron affinities were obtained from the DFT calculations, see Table 1.
The optical band gap of the films, Eoptg, extracted from the onset of the absorption, was found at 1.79 eV for PDTBTFV and 1.69 eV for PDTBTV, i.e. significantly smaller than the electrochemical gaps thus demonstrating that electronic relaxation is considerable in these polymers. The absorption maximum, which is dominated by the HOMO–LUMO transition, was found at 2.06 eV for PDTBTFV and 1.98 eV for PDTBTV (see ellipsometric characterization below), respectively.
In agreement with previous studies4,28 on conjugated polymers bearing fluorine atoms on aromatic rings, a first positive effect of fluoro-functionalization on the photovoltaic performances of the BHJ organic solar cells can be attributed to the lowering of the HOMO energy level of the donor material, EHOMO(D), resulting in a better matching with the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, ELUMO(A), which leads to an enhancement of the VOCvia29VOC = EHOMO(D) − ELUMO(A) − 0.3with ELUMO(PCBM) = 3.7 eV, and the HOMO levels of the polymers in Table 1. This gives a VOC = 1.2 V for PDTBTFV, while for PDTBTVVOC = 1.0 V, which already leads to an increase of the PCE by 20%. Furthermore, two previous investigations stressed the influence of fluorination on hole mobility.28b,c Finally, as discussed below, we find a significant enhancement of thin film light absorption in PDTBTFV compared to PDTBTV, which we held responsible for an additional improvement in device performance.


Atomic force microscopy characterization. 
The AFM characterization was performed on thin films of the two polymers and of their blends with PCBM, deposited in the same conditions used for photovoltaic device fabrication.
For pure PDTBTFV the morphology consists of a distribution of interconnected clusters of polymer grains (Fig. 7a and b). In the blend with PCBM the roughness decreases from Zav = 5.6 nm, Rms = 1.5 nm for the pure polymer to Zav = 2.3 nm, Rms = 0.6 nm due to the homogeneous distribution of the PCBM spherical structures onto the previous layer (see arrows in Fig. 7e and f). The corresponding pure PDTBTV layer is less organized into clusters and more amorphous (Fig. 8a and b) in comparison with PDTBTFV. Also in this case a partial filling process of the original PDTBTV voids by the PCBM spheres is evidenced by a decrease of roughness from the pure polymer (Zav = 6.0 nm, Rms = 1.5 nm) to the corresponding blend with PCBM (Zav = 1.8 nm, Rms = 0.5 nm).

Fig. 8e–f show PCBM distributed onto PDTBTV. It is worth noting that these short range morphologies obtained to determine the intimate distribution of the two components in the blend layer are compatible with a previous study on the long range (5 micron) morphology dependence on the layer thickness.30 Morphology doesn't seem to significantly change with annealing for both the fluorinated and non-fluorinated polymers (results not shown here).


Ellipsometric characterization of the thin films. 
It is well known that for thin films of conjugated polymers deposited onto substrates the macroscopic optical response is not only dependent on the intrinsic electronic structure of the chain but also on inter-molecular interactions determined by their relative orientation, position and aggregation, as well as on the interactions with the substrate. A versatile technique to address both optical properties and morphology of thin films is reflection variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry.31 The advantage of this technique for the analysis of the films is mainly that it does not require transparent substrates; it can thus be used to measure films also directly in the device configuration. Spectra of the complex refractive index, i.e., N = n + ik, (where n is the real part of the refractive index and k is the extinction coefficient) are simultaneously measured in a very broad spectral range from 0.75 eV to 6.5 eV. The absorption coefficient α, which is related to the extinction coefficient through α = 4πk/λ (λ; wavelength of the light), is also determined.
Furthermore, it allows for discerning possible optical anisotropy of the polymer films by measuring spectra at various angles of incidence of light and also by rotating in-plane the sample.

Fig. 9a shows the experimental spectra of the pseudoextinction coefficient (measured for the whole system substrate + film) in the photon energy range of 0.75–6.5 eV for films with an approximate thickness of 15 nm. Here, for convenience only the spectra acquired at an angle of incidence of 70° are shown; however, varying the angle of incidence and in-plane rotation did not show significant variation (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†), thus indicating that the films (with the morphology shown here) are isotropic. Five main bands can be identified which correspond to different optical transitions. Therefore, the optical response of the two polymers has been modelled by a dispersion relation including an ensemble of five oscillators.32,33 The derived spectra of the extinction coefficient, k, and of the absorption coefficient, α, for both the non-fluorinated (PDTBTV) and fluorinated (PDTBTFV) polymers films are reported in Fig. 9b.
 Fig. 9  (a) Experimental ellipsometric spectra of the pseudoextinction coefficient, for the non-fluorinated, PDTBTV (red), and fluorinated, PDTBTFV (blue), films of similar thickness of approximately 15 nm, and (b) the derived optical spectra of the extinction coefficient, k, and, in the inset, of the absorption coefficient, α. The main absorption bands for both films are indicated. 
The pattern of the observed optical transitions are similar to those reported for other conjugated polymers,33,34 where the prominent bands below 4 eV are described by π–π* type singlet transitions, involving both localized and delocalized states, often with a complex configuration interaction contribution; the high energy transition V originates from states associated with π–π* transitions localized in the benzene rings.
The main absorptions are at 2.05 eV and 2.25 eV for PDTBTV and PDTBTFV, respectively. The blue shift upon fluorination of the vinylene unit was also observed in structurally similar compounds15b,f and is consistent with the shifts of the polymer chains in solution and with the theoretical calculations (vide supra). In any case, the blue shift (0.2 eV) is larger than in solution (0.1 eV), thus pointing to somewhat improved packing of the chains in PDTBTFV.25 Further indication for different packing arises from the extinction coefficient k (Fig. 9) which is higher for PDTBTFV compared to PDTBTV all over the investigated spectrum.
In particular, for the application in BHJ devices, it can be useful to compare k values of our polymers with some reference materials, e.g. P3HT; in fact PDTBTV shows a k value of 0.9 at its maximum, which is comparable to that of P3HT,30 whereas PDTBTFV has a maximum k value of 1.25. Considering the limited increase in the absorption coefficient of PDTBTFV with respect to PDTBTV estimated from solution measurements as well as in the TD-DFT results (i.e., an increase of 3%, see Fig. 5), the remarkable enhancement of k cannot be attributed to e.g. increased D–A intramolecular charge transfer interaction in the polymer backbone, as in previously reported donor–acceptor copolymers.35–37 Instead, it must be due to interchain effects of both polymers in the film. In fact, double bond fluorination can be responsible for the increased intermolecular interactions between almost coplanar adjacent polymer chains38 which, depending on the nature of the chains and interactions, can result in the observed increased absorption coefficient. Additionally, while the PDTBTV film shows a sharper absorption edge, the PDTBTFV film even at lower energies has a higher absorption coefficient (see the inset of Fig. 9), e.g. at an energy of 1.5 eV it is approximately one order of magnitude higher, being 2.5 × 103 cm−1 for PDTBTV and 2.7 × 104 cm−1 for PDTBTFV.
The ellipsometric analysis has also been carried out on the polymer blend used for the BHJ solar cells. Similarly to the pure polymer films, ellipsometric measurements performed at various angles of incidence as well as the AFM morphologies show that the blend films can be approximated as isotropic homogeneous materials. The optical response of the blend has also been modelled by five oscillators.39,40 As can be seen in Fig. 10, the spectrum of the blend films is a superimposition of the spectra of each component.41 In the spectral region above 3 eV, the electronic transition originates mainly from PCBM,42 whereas below 3 eV, where PCBM has no characteristic bands, the transition originates from the respective conjugated polymer with similar spectral positions as in the pristine materials.43
 Fig. 10  Ellipsometric spectra of the extinction coefficient and, in the inset, of the absorption coefficient for the non-fluorinated PDTBTV and fluorinated PDTBTFV polymers blended with PCBM (polymer/PCBM ratio 1:1 for both blends). For comparison, the spectrum of PCBM is also shown. 
As in the pristine samples, the absorption coefficient of the PDTBTFV-PCBM blend still remains higher than that of the PDTBTV-PCBM blend in the region of the main optical transition of the polymer (see Fig. 10).
Thus, the increased light absorption of the fluorinated polymer blended with PCBM might be a main reason for the enhanced photovoltaic performance of PDTBTFV compared to PDTBTV, since higher light absorption implies larger exciton formation rates, so that a higher number of free charge carriers can be generated. Such an increase of light absorption in BHJ solar cells also allows for the use of thinner films to better match the diffusion length of excitons in conjugated polymers.

Synthesis of polymers
General procedure
Poly[5,5-(5′,6′-di-octyloxy-4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)-alt-1,2-difluorovinylene] (PDTBTFV): M3 (2.0 g, 2.47 mmol) and (E)-(1,2-difluoro-1,2-ethenediyl)bis[tributylstannane] M2 (1.59 g, 2.47 mmol) were dissolved under a nitrogen atmosphere in a mixture of dry THF (20 mL) and dry DMF (20 mL). Then Pd(PPh3)4 (0.14 g, 0.12 mmol) and CuI (0.5 g, 2.47 mmol) were added and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 days. Iodobenzene (0.52 g, 2.47 mmol) was added for end-capping and the mixture stirred for another day. The reaction mixture was poured into methanol (300 mL) and the crude polymer was allowed to precipitate. The crude polymer was filtered and purified by Soxhlet extraction using hexane (24 h), methanol (24 h) and chloroform (12 h). The chloroform fraction was concentrated at about 30 mL and precipitated in methanol (200 mL). Filtration and drying in vacuum yielded PDTBTFV as a dark blue solid (1.13 g, yield 75%).

Device fabrication
Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated in a nitrogen protected atmosphere following a conventional architecture, by spin coating a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS Clevios P, VP AI4083) on an ITO/glass substrate (Kintec ∼10 Ω cm−1), previously patterned with wet-etching in hydrobromic acid and cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone and isopropyl alcohol (10 min each step). The active layer was deposited by spin coating a blend of polymer and PC61BM dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) (13 mg mL−1). Finally, an aluminum layer (100 nm) was evaporated on top as a metal cathode.
Devices were characterized in air under a solar simulator KHS Solar Constant 1200 AM 1.5 Class B (100 mV cm−2) with a parameter analyzer (Agilent E5291A). For the measurements, a 5 × 5 mm2 (as the active area of the device) shadow mask was used to illuminate one cell at a time. The irradiation level was verified at quote and position where the solar cell was placed by means of a calibrate Pyranometer (Skye model SKS 1110).
Optical measurements
The concentrations in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB; Sigma Aldrich) solution were 4.957 μM for PDTBTV and 2.042 μM for PDTBTFV. Spin coated films of 15 nm thickness were deposited on quartz substrates.
The absorption spectra of solutions (standard quartz cells) and films were recorded in a Cary 50 CONC (Varian) spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL)/-excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded in a Fuoromax-4 (Horiba JobinYvon), equipped with a Xe high pressure lamp and a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R928). PL spectra were recorded after excitation of samples at 600 nm (PDTBTV) and 550 nm (PDTBTFV). PLE were recorded at a fluorescence wavelength of 750 nm for both polymers (10 averaged scans). PL and PLE spectra were corrected for the characteristics of the detection and excitation parts, respectively.
Computational details
Ground state geometries of the oligomers (in vacuo) with one to four repetition units (m) were calculated by density functional theory (DFT), without imposing symmetry. All calculations were done employing the standard B3LYP functional and 6-311G* basis set as defined in the Gaussian09 program package.44 Adiabatic electron affinities and ionization potentials were calculated by optimization of the radical anions and cations, taking into account the solvent (dichloromethane) with the polarizable continuum model (PCM) as implemented in Gaussian09. Time-dependent (TD) calculations based on the DFT geometries were done by the TD-DFT methods (in vacuo), employing both the B3LYP functional as well as the coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP) to correctly account for long-range interactions. Polymer extrapolations were done using the Kuhn approach as described elsewhere.25
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out under inert nitrogen atmosphere with an AUTOLAB potentiostat PGSTAT 10 using a classical three-electrode cell. The CV measurements were carried out in CH3CN solutions of TBAPF6 (0.10 M) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. An indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode coated with a thin film of the relevant polymer was used as the working electrode. A Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were utilized as the counter electrode and pseudo-reference electrode, respectively. All measurements were calibrated against ferrocene, the ionization potential of which is −4.80 eV.45 The evaluation of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers was carried out by measuring the onset potential of the redox processes.
Atomic force microscopy
Morphological characterization has been carried out with commercial AFM NT-MDT in non-contact force modulation mode. Both height and phase images have been contemporarily acquired. The typical parameters used are 50–60% of the original modulation amplitude as a reference signal at the cantilever resonance.
Spectroscopic ellipsometry
The optical response of films was investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE).15i,j,46 Measurements were carried out at various angles of incidence in the range of 55–75° to investigate anisotropy of optical transitions using a phase-modulated spectroscopic ellipsometer (UVISEL, JobinYvon) in the energy photon range of 0.75–6.5 eV with a resolution of 0.05 eV.
Ellipsometry is a technique that measures the change in polarization of light as a function of incident angle and wavelength. The measured parameters are Ψ and Δ, which are related to the reflection coefficient, r, of the sample for p and s polarized light, and ultimately to the sample optical properties by    where N is the complex refractive index, and ϕ is the angle of incidence.
Because of its isotropy, the spectra of polymer films were modelled with a simple two layer model, i.e., substrate/film/surface roughness to extract the optical constants, namely the refractive index, n, and the extinction coefficient, k, and absorption coefficient, α, of the films. The film was described by an ensemble of Lorentzian oscillators, as reported in detail in the text. Table S1† reports the ellipsometric fit parameters with the corresponding errors, for the oscillators associated with the main optical absorption bands.
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the synthesis and properties of PDTBTFV as the first arylenevinylene polymer for BHJ with fluorinated double bonds. Its features and photovoltaic performances have been studied in comparison with those of its non-fluorinated counterpart, PDTBTV, in order to evaluate the impact of the double bond fluorination on properties of donor polymeric semiconductors in BHJ polymer solar cells. Combined spectroscopic and computational investigations, optical and morphological studies and tests of the photovoltaic performances of the two polymers in blends with PCBM in BHJ solar cells reveal a favourable effect of fluorinated double bonds which remarkably enhance the solar cells performance. This result is attributed to a synergetic effect of double bond fluorination which (i) lowers the frontier MOs leading to an increase of the VOC and (ii) increases the molar extinction coefficient by a combined intra- and interchain effect. This latter might additionally allow reduction of BHJ film thickness, and thus enhances charge carrier generation at the interface and easy collection of the carriers at the electrodes against their tendency to recombination.
Experiments are in progress in order to improve the PCE values of BHJ based on the fluorinated polymer PDTBTFV as donor materials via different approaches: introduction of the LiF interlayer between the aluminium cathode and the organic blend; use of processing additives in the active layer thin film deposition; and replacement of PCBM with PC71BM as an acceptor material.
In conclusion, our study introduces fluorinated double bonds as a new suitable conjugated unit for polymers in BHJ solar cells, opening the way to the exploration of an entirely new class of donor materials for polymer photovoltaics.
