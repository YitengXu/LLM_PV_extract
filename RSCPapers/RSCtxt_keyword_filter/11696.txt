    , Accepted 15th August 2017First published on 15th August 2017AbstractConjugated bifluorenylidene and naphthalene central cores are introduced into hole-transporting materials DT1 and DT2 to replace the spiro-core of the reported, highly efficient FDT. The effects of the conjugated core on the geometrics, electronic properties and hole transport properties are investigated by using density functional theory coupled with Marcus theory and the Einstein relation. The calculated results show that DT1 (−5.21 eV) and DT2 (−5.23 eV) have lower HOMO levels than FDT (−5.15 eV), which indicates that the perovskite solar cells with conjugated hole-transporting materials can have higher open-circuit voltages. The introduction of the conjugated core is beneficial to the more efficient face-to-face packing pattern of the dimer, resulting in a larger intermolecular electronic coupling. Importantly, it is found that DT1 (1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and DT2 (2.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) exhibit relatively higher hole mobilities than FDT (1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) owing to the larger electronic coupling. Therefore, enhanced hole transport ability can be achieved by switching from the spiro-core to the conjugated core. The present work provides a new strategy to improve the hole transport properties of hole-transporting materials, which will contribute to the development of conjugated small molecules as hole-transporting materials in efficient perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Since the first report in 2009 by Miyasaka and co-workers, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly attracted considerable attention in photovoltaics due to their unique optical and electrical properties and superior power conversion efficiency (PCE).1 Typically, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites are used as light absorbents, and organic or inorganic materials are employed as hole transport layers in PSCs.2–5 The hole-transporting materials (HTMs) can usually enhance the open-circuit voltage by decreasing charge recombination at the hole-collecting electrode and increase the internal quantum efficiency through reducing the loss of charges.6
Various organic small molecule-based HTMs have been explored and synthesized in PSCs with a PCE of 16–18%.7–11 To date, the most commonly used HTM is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), which exhibits impressive photovoltaic performance and has achieved a PCE of over 20%.12–15 The expensive multi-step synthesis and low intrinsic hole mobility (3.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1)16,17 of Spiro-OMeTAD, however, significantly limit its up-scaling applications in PSCs. Thus, researchers are working on replacing Spiro-OMeTAD with alternative low-cost and efficient HTMs that yield PSC devices with high efficiency. Up to now, PSCs have achieved a PCE of 20.2%, employing 2′,7′-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,9′-fluorene] (FDT) as the HTM.18FDT provides potentially low-cost HTMs, because its structure is modified easily and it can be dissolved in a friendly solvent environment. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, the molecular structure of FDT contains a cyclopentadithiophene in the core moiety, which induces thiophene–iodine interactions between the hole transport layer and the perovskite interface. The additional thiophene–iodine interaction can improve hole transfer at the FDT/perovskite interface. In addition, FDT has a slightly lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, which retains a higher open-circuit voltage. However, the multi-step synthesis of spiro-type derivatives is prohibitively challenging, since it requires low temperature and harsh acid and basic conditions. A PCE of 17.8% has been achieved by using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-bifluorenylidene (KR216) as the HTM in PSCs.19 Compared to Spiro-OMeTAD and FDT, the difference when using KR216 is that it introduces a CC double bond into the spiro-core moiety to form a conjugated 9,9′-bifluorenylidene central core. The synthesis of KR216 was accomplished through a more straightforward two-step procedure and used inexpensive starting reagents. The reason is that the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene central core can be synthesized by a single-step reaction. The conjugated 9,9′-bifluorenylidene central core effectively increases the planarity of the whole molecule, which may lead to the face-to-face packing pattern of the dimer, and the hole transport ability can be improved with this stacking pattern. However, KR216 is similar to Spiro-OMeTAD, in that four methoxydiphenylamine groups lead to high steric hindrance in the molecular structure. A highly sterically hindered geometry causes the HTM molecules to form a poor packing pattern of the dimer, which reduces the facile establishment of highly efficient hole transport channels. Therefore, it is important to develop an excellent HTM that not only has a relatively low HOMO energy level to increase the open-circuit voltage and a straightforward synthesis to decrease cost, but also possesses a good planarity to improve the hole transport ability at the HTM/perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) interface.
According to the advantages that FDT has a low HOMO energy level and a thiophene–iodine interaction between the hole transport layer and the perovskite interface, we chose FDT as the reference molecule in this work. Again, considering the characteristics that a conjugated core is synthesized easily and increases the planarity of the whole molecular structure, two conjugated central cores, bifluorenylidene and naphthalene, are respectively introduced into DT1 and DT2 to replace the spiro-core of FDT (Fig. 1). For the three HTMs, the effects of the conjugated core on their geometric structure and electronic properties are investigated in detail by density functional theory (DFT), and the effects of the conjugated core on the hole-transport properties are explored through DFT coupled with Marcus theory and the Einstein relation. The calculated results show that DT1 and DT2 as HTMs may have higher open-circuit voltages due to their lower HOMO levels compared with FDT. The hole mobility is an important parameter for hole transport properties of HTMs. In order to accurately evaluate the intermolecular electronic coupling and hole mobility, the possible intermolecular hopping pathways between the neighboring molecules are identified through their single-crystal structures. The studied results show that introducing a conjugated core into DT1 and DT2 is beneficial for the face-to-face packing pattern of the dimer, resulting in a large intermolecular electronic coupling. DT1 and DT2 have higher hole mobility than FDT due to their larger electronic coupling. Thus, the two new HTMs possess better hole transport ability and may be the most promising alternatives to FDT, especially DT2.

2. Computational methods
2.1 Theoretical background
In this study, Marcus theory is applied to describe the hole transport behavior. The charge hopping rate (k) for all investigated molecules is expressed as:20  where h denotes the Planck constant, kB represents the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. λ represents the reorganization energy that is obtained from the adiabatic potential energy surface method:21,22λ = (E0* − E0) + (E+* − E+)where E+* and E0* represent the total energies of cationic and neutral species with the geometries of the neutral and cationic species. E+ and E0 are the total energies of the cationic and neutral molecules in their lowest energy geometries.

V denotes the intermolecular electronic coupling between adjacent molecules in the crystal structure, as shown in the equation:23,24  where HRR and HPP are site energies, SRP is the spatial overlap and JRP is the charge transfer integral for one dimer.
The hole mobilities of the investigated molecules are calculated by using the Einstein relation:25,26  where n represents the spatial dimensionality and the hole transport pathway is considered in three dimensions; i is the given hopping pathway and ri is the charge hopping centroid-to-centroid distance, and ki denotes the charge hopping rate. Pi is defined as the relative hopping probability for charge hopping to the ith pathway, which can be obtained using:  
2.2 Computational details
The electronic structure calculations of the individual HTM molecule are performed with DFT and TD-DFT methods using the Gaussian 09 software package.27 The ground-state (S0) geometry of the model compound FDT is optimized through different functional and basis sets. The calculated results show that the HOMO energy of the FDT computed with the BMK/6-31G** method agrees well with the experimental data (Table S1, ESI†),18 and optimized structures are confirmed to be minimum-energy points by vibrational analysis. Thus, all individual HTMs are optimized using this theoretical level. In the TD-DFT calculations, the B3LYP/6-31+G** method is used to calculate the UV-vis absorption spectra with the 30 lowest singlet–singlet excitations on the basis of the optimized S0 geometry (Table S3, ESI†). The emission spectra are also calculated using this method on the basis of the first excited-state (S1) geometry. The optimizations of geometries are carried out in dichloromethane solvent, since the experimental HOMO energy was measured by pulse voltammetry in dichloromethane solvent. The spectra are simulated in a chlorobenzene solvent for all investigated molecules, because the experimental absorption spectra were prepared from chlorobenzene. The optimizations of the geometries and simulations of spectra are based on the conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM).28 In addition, the electron density differences are calculated for comparing the charge separation efficiency with the code Multwfn 2.5.29 The fraction of charge exchange and distance of charge transfer are calculated with the DctViaCube.30
The crystal structures of DT1 and DT2 are predicted by employing the Polymorph module in the Materials Studio (MS) package based on an optimized individual HTM structure.31 The predicted crystal structures of DT1 and DT2 with the lowest total energy are achieved and belong to the P21/C and P21 space groups. On the basis of the crystal structure, the most stable single-crystal structure is used to generate the possible intermolecular hopping pathways between the neighboring molecules. The different molecular dimers are chosen to calculate their intermolecular electronic coupling. For calculation of intermolecular electronic coupling, Han et al. have proved that the PW91 functional is reliable in that calculation results are in agreement with the experimental values.23,32 Thus, the intermolecular electronic coupling calculations of dimers are performed by the VWN/PW91/TZP method as implemented in the ADF program.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structures and electronic properties
Conjugated bifluorenylidene and naphthalene central cores are introduced into DT1 and DT2 to replace the spiro-core of the reported, highly efficient FDT. FDT and the two designed molecules are shown in Fig. 1. The center of the spiro-core is formed by a sp3 hybridized carbon atom, while the center of the conjugated core is a CC double bond formed through two sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. The introduction of a CC double bond increases the conjugation of the DT1 and DT2 molecules, especially DT2. It is known that the sp2 hybridized π-bond cannot rotate freely and tends to form either the cis- or trans-conformation. So the competition between the planarization and the repulsive steric hindrance leads to a pseudo spiro conformation and small torsion angles.19 The dihedral angles of the bifluorenylidene core of DT1 and the naphthalene core of DT2 are calculated to be 27.47° and 19.64° (Fig. S1, ESI†); these values are much smaller than that of FDT (88.67°). Thus, DT1 and DT2 possess a better planarity compared with FDT, which can facilitate delocalized π-conjugation to ensure high carrier mobility in the π-stacking direction.
In π-conjugated oligomers and polymers, it is found that the more delocalized frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) stimulate faster carrier transport by decreasing the intramolecular reorganization energy and increasing the electronic coupling of adjacent molecules in the crystal structure or dimer.33 The HOMOs and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the three molecules are calculated to determine the relations between electronic structure and carrier transport performance. As shown in Fig. 2, there is only a trifling difference in the HOMO among all molecules. The HOMOs are delocalized over the methoxysubstituted phenylamine moieties. The LUMOs for FDT are mainly located at the fluorine–dithiophene, while the LUMOs of the molecules DT1 and DT2 are mainly spread over the conjugated core moieties due to the enhanced π-conjugation effect. Obviously, there is very little orbital overlap between the HOMOs and the LUMOs for DT1 and DT2. The orbital overlap between the HOMOs and LUMOs suggests that fast formation of neutral excitons and hole transfer transition may take place.34 Thus, DT1 and DT2 may have better hole-transport ability than FDT.

In PSCs, the open-circuit voltage of the device is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi levels of TiO2 and the HOMO energy level of HTMs. A higher open-circuit voltage can be achieved when the HOMO level is lower. Thus, it is necessary to obtain an appropriate HOMO level of HTMs. For reference molecule FDT in this work, the calculated HOMO is −5.15 eV with the BMK/6-31G** method, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of −5.16 eV (Table S1, ESI†). The HOMO levels of the investigated molecules are shown in Table 1 and the energy level diagram of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au is shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that DT1 (−5.21 eV) and DT2 (−5.23 eV) have a deeper HOMO level than FDT (−5.15 eV). Taking into account the calculated accuracy, two additional methods (M06 and PBE0) were considered to calculate the HOMO energy levels for DT1, DT2, and FDT in this study. The calculated results show that although the difference between the HOMO energy for DT1, DT2, and FDT is still small, the HOMO energy levels follow the same order: DT2 < DT1 < FDT (Table S2, ESI†). Therefore, the PSCs with the conjugated HTMs DT1 and DT2 can have higher open-circuit voltages due the deeper HOMO level compared with FDT. The molecular HOMO level also reflects the hole injection ability of the device. The HOMO levels of the investigated molecules are well matched with the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV),35 which can ensure efficient hole injection from the perovskite into the HTMs. Furthermore, in order to hinder the electron transportation from perovskite to the metal electrodes, the LUMO level should be higher than the conduction band of perovskite such as CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV). The LUMO levels are estimated through the equation of LUMO = HOMO+E (E is the excitation energy), which is calculated at the TD-B3LYP/6-31+G** level. Accordingly, the calculated LUMO levels of FDT, DT1 and DT2 are −2.19, −2.22 and −2.25 eV, respectively, which are much higher than the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 3). Therefore, the backflow of electrons can be effectively blocked when these molecules are used as HTMs.

3.2 Spectra and charge transfer properties
A broader UV-vis absorption band and large Stokes shift are typical features for a good HTM. The UV-vis absorption spectra of all molecules in chlorobenzene are presented in Fig. 4 and the corresponding data are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). FDT, DT1, and DT2 show similar absorption maxima (λmax) at 418, 414 and 416 nm, respectively, and the absorption band (350–450 nm) is associated with the π → π* transitions of the π-conjugated system. DT1 and DT2 have broader absorption bands in the visible region compared with FDT; DT1 exhibits a significant absorption between 450 and 500 nm due to the better π-electron delocalization, which reveals the enhanced conjugation through introduction of a CC double bond. Corresponding to the dominant transition, the λmax of FDT, DT2, and DT1 transfers from HOMO to LUMO+1. The emission spectra of all molecules in chlorobenzene are also calculated and the corresponding data are displayed in Table S4 (ESI†). The emission maxima (λem) are red-shifted in the following order: FDT (486 nm), DT2 (526 nm), and DT1 (538 nm). Stokes shifts are estimated from the difference between the maximum of the absorption and emission spectra (Stokes shift = λem − λabs). The magnitude of the Stokes shift is parallel to a change of the molecular structure from nonplanar in the S0 state to more planar in the S1 state. DT1 and DT2 exhibit a larger Stokes shift of 124 nm and 111 nm compared with FDT (68 nm); this indicates a greater substantial change of the geometric structure from the S0 to the S1 state. Therefore, CC double bonds in the HTM molecules should play an important role during the electron transition (S0 → S1). In addition, a HTM with a spiro-core will lead to strong twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) induced absorption, which may lead to a decrease in photocurrent. The introduction of the conjugated core is beneficial to reduce TICT absorption of HTM molecules, resulting in a high photocurrent.

In order to study the influence of the conjugated core on the charge transfer properties, the electron density difference plots of each isolated HTM are calculated. These values, electron transfer distance (L), fraction of electron exchange (Δe), and overlap between the zones of density depletion and increment (Ω, isovalue: 4 × 10−4 e au−3), are presented in Table S5 (ESI†). Normally, with a longer distance and less electron density overlap, a favorable efficiency of charge separation can be achieved. The overlaps of each molecule are similar. These values are 0.21, 0.28, and 0.23 for FDT, DT1 and DT2, respectively. Relatively good results are obtained regarding the fraction of electron exchange, and the values of FDT (1.47 eV), DT1 (1.20 eV), and DT2 (1.10 eV) are more than 1.00 eV. This means that the efficiency of charge separation of all HTMs is good. The electron transfer distance is in the following order: DT2 (3.71 Å) > FDT (3.56 Å) > DT1 (3.36 Å). From the above results, DT2 has not only a sufficient fraction of electron exchange and less electron density overlap, but also a long electron transfer distance. Therefore, DT2 should possess the best efficiency of charge separation.
3.3 Reorganization energy and exciton binding energy
The reorganization energy (λ) is one of the important parameters to determine the hole mobility. Generally, a lower reorganization energy can ensure a faster hole transfer. The λ of the molecule undergoing charge transfer has two components: inner reorganization energy (λin) and outer reorganization energy (λout). λin is the total energy associated with deformation in the nuclear coordinates of the dimer when a charge localized on molecule i is transferred to molecule j; λout results from changes in the electronic and nuclear polarization of the surrounding medium of the dimer upon charge transfer reaction. For most organic molecules, the λin should be dominant, while λout is small and often is neglected (λ = λin).36 Thus, in the present work, the inner-sphere reorganization energy is only considered.37 The λ is obtained by calculating the optimized geometries in neutral and cationic states at the BMK/6-31G** level and the results are presented in Fig. 5. The λ values of FDT, DT1, and DT2 are 0.271, 0.278 and 0.239 eV, respectively. The λ value of DT1 is similar to that of FDT, and DT2 shows a smaller λ value than FDT. This implies that the introduction of a naphthalene central core into DT2 decreases the λ value, and this decrease may be caused by the minimum dihedral angle of the naphthalene core. Therefore, owing to the smaller λ, DT2 may possess a better hole-transport ability compared with FDT and DT1.

To obtain efficient charge dissociation, the bound electron–hole pairs should be dissociated into the free charges (hole and electron) to overcome the Coulomb attraction.38,39 The exciton binding energy (Eb) is mainly derived from the Coulombic attraction energy in the electron–hole pair. The employed expression is Eb = Eg − Ex = ΔEH–L − E1,40,41 where Eg is the electronic band gap that is replaced through the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (ΔEH–L), and Ex is the optical gap that can be approximated as the first singlet excitation energy (E1). The E1 is obtained at the TD-B3LYP/6-31+G** level based on the optimized geometry of the S1 state and the results are listed in Table S6 (ESI†). The calculated Eb values for FDT, DT1, and DT2 are 0.41, 0.69 and 0.63 eV, respectively. This result means that the electron–hole pairs of FDT can more easily dissociate into free charge carriers than those in the DT1 and DT2 molecules. The large exciton binding energies of DT1 and DT2 may not be beneficial to a good hole-transport ability. However, there are many factors that affect the hole-transport ability such as intermolecular electronic coupling; these will be discussed below.
3.4 Intermolecular electronic coupling and hole mobility
Carrier transfers are very important in many physical and chemical processes.42 The intermolecular electronic coupling significantly affects the carrier mobility. In general, a large electronic coupling leads to high hole mobility. The electronic coupling value is dependent on the relative position of the interacting molecules and the distribution patterns of the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). Thus, the relative positions of the neighboring molecules must be provided when calculating the electronic coupling of the investigated molecules. The relative positions of the neighboring molecules are highly affected by the crystal structure of the molecule. The experimental crystal structure of FDT has been reported,18 which can be directly used to generate all possible intermolecular hopping pathways between the neighboring molecules.43 However, the experimental crystal structures are not available for DT1 and DT2, so we carried out the crystal prediction employing the MS package. The calculated crystal structures (Fig. S2, ESI†) with the lowest total energy of DT1 and DT2 belong to the P21/C and P21 space groups. The corresponding lattice parameters are Z = 4, a = 4.953 Å, b = 71.306 Å, c = 11.903 Å, and α = γ = 90°, β = 104.569° for DT1, Z = 2, a = 18.093 Å, b = 4.506 Å, c = 25.582 Å, α = γ = 90°, and β = 109.440° for DT2. In these crystal structures, a molecule is chosen as the center to diffuse charge, and eight or nine nearest neighboring intermolecular hopping pathways are recognized. Then, the possible hole transfer pathways between the center molecule and the neighboring one are identified. Fig. 6 displays the possible hole transfer pathways of the three HTMs. After that, the relative positions of the neighboring molecules are achieved and the electronic couplings of the dimers are evaluated directly by dimer fragment analysis in the ADF software package.23 The centroid-to-centroid distance (ri, Å) of the correlated dimer, the electronic coupling (V, eV), the charge hopping rate (kij, s−1), and the hole mobility (μ, cm2 V−1 s−1) of the main hopping pathways are presented in Table 2.

The packing pattern strongly influences the centroid-to-centroid distance and the electronic coupling value. As shown in Fig. 6, all dimers exhibit three packing patterns: face-to-face packing, herringbone-to-edge packing, and edge-to-edge packing. The face-to-face packing can effectively increase the π–π stacking of the dimer, while the herringbone-to-edge packing and the edge-to-edge packing are not beneficial for π–π stacking of the dimer. Among the hole transfer pathways, pathway 2 of FDT, pathway 5 of DT1, and pathway 4 of DT2 belong to face-to-face packing (see Fig. 6). In the packing, the molecules stack in a slipped fashion via the cyclopentadithiophene or benzodithiophene planes. The shortest centroid-to-centroid distance and the largest electronic coupling value are achieved on pathway 2 of FDT, pathway 5 of DT1, and pathway 4 of DT2 for all pathways due to the effective π–π stacking of the dimer. From Table 2, we can find that the shortest centroid-to-centroid distance is in the order of FDT (6.44 Å) > DT1 (5.30 Å) > DT2 (4.51 Å), and the largest electronic coupling value is in the sequence of FDT (−1.49 × 10−3 eV) < DT1 (3.99 × 10−3 eV) < DT2 (2.50 × 10−2 eV). Furthermore, a short distance of sulfur (S)⋯sulfur (S) contacts leads to a strong S⋯S interaction, and the strong S⋯S interaction can increase the electronic coupling. Shorter intermolecular S⋯S contacts are found between the neighboring molecules when the spiro-core is replaced by a conjugated core (Fig. 6). The distances of S⋯S contacts for FDT, DT1, and DT2 are 6.44, 4.95 and 4.51 Å, respectively. This result shows that DT2 has the strongest S⋯S interaction. Thus, the introduction of the conjugated core is beneficial to the π–π stacking and strong S⋯S interaction of the dimer, which can facilitate highly efficient hole transport. For the pathways with herringbone-to-edge packing and edge-to-edge packing, smaller electronic couplings are achieved compared to the pathway with face-to-face packing for FDT, DT1 and DT2; for example, the smallest electronic couplings are obtained on pathways 6 of FDT (2.29 × 10−5 eV), 8 of DT1 (2.73 × 10−7 eV) and 1 of DT2 (−7.56 × 10−5 eV). Overall, although the herringbone-to-edge packing and the edge-to-edge packing are not beneficial to large electronic coupling, they do not hinder the increase in total electronic coupling as the increase of molecular conjugation (see Table 2). Therefore, according to the difference of electronic coupling between FDT, DT1 and DT2, we think that the conjugated core may play an important role in increasing the electronic coupling due to the core of the architectural structure increasing conjugation and advancing electron-transfer ability.
In addition, like FDT, DT1 and DT2 also contain dithiophene in the molecular structure. When they are adsorbed on the perovskite surface, they not only exhibit the main interaction between the HTM methoxy groups and the perovskite methylammonium sites, but also reveal an additional interaction between the dithiophene and the perovskite surface via thiophene–iodine interactions. The interaction of the HTMs/CH3NH3PbI3 stems from a synergistic effort of covalent bonding and van der Waals forces,44,45 and van der Waals interactions contribute significantly to the binding between the HTMs and the perovskite surface. This suggests a stronger adsorption and enhanced interfacial coupling between the HTMs and perovskite. The photogenerated hole delocalized on the perovskite iodine atoms, contributing to the perovskite valence band, can be effectively transferred to the HTM due to the additional thiophene–iodine interaction. This may also provide an alternative hole transfer pathway. Therefore, the effect of covalent bonding and van der Waals forces between the HTMs and perovskite surface facilitates the formation of a highly efficient hole transport system.
Good hole transport properties are obtained due to the large electron coupling and dual-channel hole transfer. The charge hopping rate and hole mobility are calculated based on the Marcus formula and Einstein equation. The calculated maximum values of charge hopping rate are 5.16 × 109, 3.46 × 1010 and 2.11 × 1012 for FDT, DT1 and DT2, respectively. The values of hole mobility are 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for FDT, DT1 and DT2, respectively. It can be found that the order of hole mobility is consistent with the changing trend of electronic coupling and the charge hopping rate of the transfer pathway of dimers. From the previous discussion, although DT1 and DT2 have larger exciton binding energies that are not conducive to improving hole transport, larger electronic coupling increases the hole mobility of DT1 and DT2 further. Thus, DT1 and DT2 possess better hole-transport ability compared with FDT. The results showed that the introduction of the conjugated core to the HTM can improve the hole-transport ability. The efficient charge collection in PSC devices is related to fast interfacial hole transfer, and the efficient charge collection can promote a large short-circuit current density in PSCs.46 Therefore, the hole mobility of the HTM also plays a critical role in determining the short-circuit current density of the device, and DT1 and DT2 may have higher short-circuit current density. Considering enhanced hole-transport properties, the designed DT1 and DT2 may provide high PCEs, when they are applied as the HTM.
3.5 Stability of individual molecules
A good stability is necessary for the application of HTMs in PSCs. Generally, the stability of an organic semiconductor can be assessed by absolute hardness (η).22,47–49 The larger the absolute hardness is, the better the stability of the material will be. The absolute hardness of all investigated molecules was calculated by using the expression:50η = (IPa − EAa)/2, where IPa represents the adiabatic ionization potential and EAa denotes the adiabatic electron affinity. The calculated absolute hardness values are listed in Table 3 and the values of DT2, FDT, and DT1 are 2.72, 2.55 and 1.97 eV, respectively. Obviously, the absolute hardness of DT1 is the smallest among the three molecules. This means that DT1 may exhibit poor stability, and DT2 may be more stable. Furthermore, the ionization potential and electron affinity relate to overcoming the energy barrier of holes and electrons injecting into the electrodes or virtual orbitals.51 The ionization potentials of FDT, DT1, and DT2 are 5.34, 5.41 and 5.47 eV, respectively. The larger ionization potentials of DT1 and DT2 are beneficial for the holes injecting into empty orbitals of semiconductors.

In addition, the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) can also afford a clue about molecular stability.52 The ESPs of the investigated molecules are displayed in Fig. 7. The green color represents the neutral region. The red color means regions of negative charge and blue color denotes regions of positive charge. In general, more negative charges on the molecule make oxidation of the structure easier, and thereby the molecular stability will decrease. The regions of positive charges of all molecules are mainly delocalized on nitrogen atoms and benzene rings of diphenylamine. The negative charges of FDT and DT2 are located on oxygen atoms of methoxy units due to the strong electron-deficiency ability, however, the negative charge of DT1 is distributed on the oxygen atoms of methoxy units and the thiophene rings of the bifluorenylidene core. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that FDT and DT2 have more regions of positive charge compared with DT1. Therefore, DT1 is the most easily oxidized of the three molecules, and DT2 and FDT show better stability properties compared with DT1. The results are in good accordance with the absolute hardness. From an overall perspective, deeper HOMO levels, broader absorption bands, and better hole-transport ability are achieved when introducing a conjugated core into the structure of HTMs. Therefore, DT1 and DT2 with a conjugated core may be promising alternatives to FDT.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, two HTM molecules DT1 and DT2 are designed by introducing a conjugated core into the structure to replace the spiro-core of FDT. The effects of the conjugated core on the geometries, electronic properties, and hole-transport properties of all molecules are theoretically investigated. The HOMO values of DT2, DT1, and FDT are −5.23 eV, −5.21 eV, and −5.15 eV, respectively. Deeper HOMO levels are obtained with an increase in molecular conjugation, which will result in higher open-circuit voltages of PSCs. Replacing the spiro-core with a conjugated core, the face-to-face packing of the dimer with larger π–π stacking and shorter centroid-to-centroid distance can contribute to higher intermolecular electronic coupling. The hole mobilities of DT1 (1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and DT2 (2.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) are higher than that of FDT (1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) owing to the higher electronic coupling. Taking into account the appropriate HOMO level and the improved hole mobility, the two HTMs with a conjugated core may be promising alternatives to FDT. The present study can provide crucial information for designing excellent conjugated small molecules as HTMs for high-performance PSCs.
