    , Accepted 16th February 2022First published on 16th February 2022AbstractOrganic cations are believed to have little influence on the charge carrier lifetime in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites. Experiments defy this expectation. We consider formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) doping with and without Br as two prototypical systems, and perform ab initio time-domain nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics simulations to investigate nonradiative electron–hole recombination. The simulations demonstrate that correlated organic–inorganic motion stabilizes the lattice and inhibits nonradiative charge recombination in FAPbI3 upon Br doping. Br doping suppresses the rotation of FA and the vibrations of both organic and inorganic components, and leads to hole localization and the extent of localization is enhanced upon thermal impact, notably reducing the NA coupling by decreasing the overlap between the electron and hole wave functions. Doping also slightly increases the bandgap for further decreasing NA coupling and enhances the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. The small NA coupling and large bandgap beat the slow coherence loss, delaying electron–hole recombination and extending the charge carrier lifetime to 1.5 ns in Br-doped FAPbI3, which is on the order of 1.1 ns in pristine FAPbI3. The obtained time scales are in good agreement with experiments. Multiple phonon modes, including those of both the inorganic and organic components, couple to the electronic subsystem and accommodate the excess electronic energy lost during nonradiative charge recombination. The study reveals the unexpected atomistic mechanisms for the reduction of electron–hole recombination upon Br doping, rationalizes the experiments, and advances our understanding of the excited-state dynamics of perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are of great interest in solar cells due to their remarkable electronic and optical properties, including high optical absorption coefficient,1–3 long carrier diffusion length,4 and excellent defect tolerance.5,6 Such advantages have led to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from the initial value 3.8%7 rapidly growing to the champion value of 25.7%8 within a decade, which is comparable to those of silicon photovoltaic cells.9–11 The champion PCE perovskite solar cells based on formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) exhibit superior thermal stability and strong light-harvesting ability due to its small bandgap of 1.47 eV.12 However, the maximum PCE is still smaller than the value predicted by the Shockley–Queisser theory for a single-junction photovoltaic solar cell13 due largely to the nonradiative charge and energy losses. More seriously, the metastable black α-FAPbI3-to-δ-FAPbI3 phase transition under ambient conditions causes the perovskite to lose the outstanding optical and electronic properties and thus it shows a poor response to photoexcitation.14 In order to circumvent the fatal instability issue, a number of experiments have been conducted to synthesize and maintain α-FAPbI3 by mixing FA with other cations or anions to suppress the undesired phase transition.15–23
Zhang et al. demonstrated that a mixture of MA and FA tends to stabilize α-phase FAxMA1−xPbI3 associated with a well-ordered crystalline and compositionally uniform structure, resulting in a reduction of charge trapping and recombination and an extension of carrier diffusion length.20 Incorporation of alkali metals, such as Cs+ or Rb+, into FAPbI3 has a similar effect to suppress the phase transformation from the black α-phase to the non-perovskite δ-phase, notably enhancing the moisture tolerance and photovoltaic performance with respect to pristine FAPbI3 perovskites.17,19,22 Compared to engineering the A-site cations, mixing halogen anions in FAPbI3 holds an additional advantage by increasing the open-circuit voltage due to the precisely tuned and enlarged bandgap. At the same time, partial replacement of I− with Br− or Cl− changes the hydrogen bond interaction and electrostatic interaction between the organic and inorganic components, which notably affects the rotational motion of organic cations.23 Ultrafast two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that incorporation of bromine into metal iodine perovskites slows down the rotation of organic cations due to the enhancement of N–H⋯Br hydrogen bond strength.21 By the quasielastic neutron scattering technique, Johnston and coauthors showed that the nonradiative charge recombination is substantially retarded in Br-doped FAPbI3 with an optimal 15% Br doping concentration for achieving the longest carrier lifetime due in part to the preferred orientation of FA in mixed halide perovskites.18 However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear yet. Therefore, a detailed time-domain study is needed to deepen the understanding of the reduction of nonradiative electron–hole recombination in FAPbI3 upon Br doping.
Stimulated by the experimental and theoretical works,18,21 we use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)24 combined with nonadiabatic MD (NA-MD)25,26 to investigate the nonradiative electron–hole recombination in pristine FAPbI3 and FAPbI3 doped with Br and establish the atomistic mechanism for the extended charge carrier lifetime. The simulations demonstrate that recombination of free electrons and holes across the fundamental bandgap of pristine FAPbI3 takes one nanosecond, agreeing well with the experiment. Partial replacement of I with Br delays the recombination by a factor of about 1.4 and extends the charge carrier lifetime to 1.5 ns due to small NA coupling. The introduction of Br dopants into the lattice restricts the rotation of FA cations and coherently suppresses inorganic lattice vibrations due to the enhanced correlated motion between the two components, thus leading to small NA coupling not only because the nuclear velocity dR/dt enters into the coupling matrix, but also it significantly localizes the hole wave function, resulting in a notable decrease in the overlap between the electron and hole wave functions. Reduced atomic motion improves the lattice stability and causes a reduction of phonon-induced loss of coherence, which is counterintuitive to common sense because the replacement of heavier I with lighter Br is expected to accelerate the decoherence process. Br doping increases the bandgap for reducing NA coupling further and simultaneously enhances the open-circuit voltage of perovskites solar cells. Small NA coupling and a large bandgap beat the long coherence time, resulting in the reduction of the nonradiative electron–hole recombination in FAPbI3 containing Br dopants. The multiple phonon modes, including those of both inorganic and organic components, lead to short decoherence times, about 10 fs, which are responsible for the long-lived charge carriers and high-performance of FAPbI3 solar cells.27–29 The study deepens our understanding of prolonged charge carrier lifetimes in mixed iodine–bromine perovskites by revealing the importance of the correlated organic–inorganic motion at the atomistic level for the first time, and provides valuable guidelines for the design of high-performance perovskite photovoltaics and optoelectronics.
2. Computational details
The NA-MD simulation of nonradiative electron–hole recombination is performed with a mixed quantum-classical decoherence-induced surface hopping (DISH) algorithm,25 implemented within TDDFT in the Kohn–Sham (KS) framework.30,31 In mixed quantum-classical dynamics, the lighter and faster electrons are described quantum mechanically, while the heavier and slower nuclei are treated classically. The DISH approach includes a semiclassical description of the decoherence process that occurs when the electronic degree of freedom is coupled to quantum nuclei. The decoherence time, known as the pure-dephasing time in the optical response theory,32 is much shorter than the quantum transition time that is on the order of several nanoseconds. Therefore, decoherence correction is needed to be taken into account in the NA-MD simulation of nonradiative electron–hole recombination. The approach has been widely applied to the study of photoexcitation dynamics for a broad range of systems, including perovskites containing defects33–35 and grain boundaries,36–38 transition metal oxides,39,40 transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures,41,42etc.
Geometry optimization, adiabatic MD, and NA coupling are performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP),43 employing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerh (PBE) functional44 and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method45 to treat electronic exchange–correlation interactions and ion-valence electron interactions, respectively. A 500 eV plane-wave basis energy cutoff and a Γ-centred 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh46 are employed for geometry optimization. A much denser Γ-centered 6 × 6 × 6 k-mesh is used for electronic structure calculations. The van der Waals interaction is introduced by the Grimme DFT-D3 approach47 with Becke–Johnson damping. The phonon frequencies and force constants are computed using the Phonopy package48–50 implemented with the VASP code based on the density functional perturbation theory.51 The convergence criterion for electron relaxation is set to 10−8 eV·Å−1. The phonon projected density of states (phonon PDOS) is obtained with a 3 × 3 × 3 q-point mesh. After the geometry is relaxing at 0 K, both the systems are heated to 300 K with repeated velocity rescaling for 2 ps to equilibrate the structures. Then, 8 ps adiabatic MD trajectories are obtained in the microcanonical ensemble with a 1 fs atomic time step. Note that heating, MD, and NA coupling calculations are carried out at the Γ point because both systems have a direct bandgap at the Γ point. Then, the last 3000 geometries of the 8 ps MD trajectories are selected as the initial configurations for NA-MD simulation of the nonradiative electron–hole recombination using the Python Extension for Ab Initio Dynamics (PYXAID) code.26,52 The quantum transition across a direct bandgap is more efficient than that across an indirect bandgap in materials, because the latter requires emitting phonons. We and other groups have applied this method to study nonraditive electron–hole recombination at the direct bandgap for various materials, including perovskites and metal oxides.35,53–59 Currently, NA-MD simulations of the quantum transition between an indirect bandgap are challenging because the electron momentum goes to the phonon momentum during the transition, which means a change in electron k-points accompanied by a change in phonon q-points. The related method is still under development.
Spin–orbital coupling (SOC) is important for the heavy Pb and I atoms.60 To obtain an accurate bandgap of FAPbI3, hybrid functional/GW combined with SOC correction is necessary.61,62 However, such calculations suffer from the huge computational cost because NA-MD simulation requires thousands of NA couplings derived from non-self-consistent field calculations. As a consequence, a combination of the hybrid functional/GW band and SOC correction is impossible for the NA-MD study of quantum dynamics in condensed-phase materials at the nanoscale. Previous work showed that the bandgap of a perovskite is reasonably reproduced to an experimental bandgap by the PBE functional55,63,64 due to the cancellation of the neglect of the SOC effects and the electron self-interaction error of the PBE functional.65 Therefore, we chose the PBE functional for the calculation of electronic structures, adiabatic MD, and NA coupling for the two systems. Previous works conducted by us and other groups have shown the robustness of the PBE functional for predicting charge carrier lifetimes in HOIPs35,56,57,66 and all-inorganic perovskites.53,67
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structure
Pristine FAPbI3 is represented by a 192-atom (2 × 2 × 2) supercell constructed using the optimized unit cell. Regularly replacing an iodine atom with a bromine atom in each [PbI6]4− octahedron forms the Br-doped FAPbI3 system. At 0 K, the FA cations are orderly located in the cavities formed by [PbI6]4− octahedra in pristine FAPbI3 with and without Br doping (Fig. 1a). The inorganic lattice changes slightly, and the averaged Pb–I bond length shortens from 3.15 Å in pristine FAPbI3 to 3.13 Å upon Br doping, caused by lattice compression due to the introduction of smaller bromine atoms. The geometric change becomes more pronounced at room temperature due to the dynamic distortion of the inorganic lattice, as evidenced by the averaged Pb–I bond length and the equatorial I–Pb–I angle. The particularly averaged bond length and angle correspond to 3.25 Å and 3.24 Å, and 156° and 157° in the pristine and Br-doped FAPbI3, respectively. A larger equatorial I–Pb–I angle reflects a smaller distortion of octahedra. Furthermore, the frequency distribution of the two quantities is narrower in Br-doped FAPbI3 than that in pristine FAPbI3, which also confirmed the above analysis. The observation is counterintuitive because replacing larger I with smaller Br releases space for atomic motions, and thus an increase in the distortion of the inorganic lattices is expected.

(b) The averaged Pb–I bond lengths (Å) and the averaged equatorial I–Pb–I bond angles (inset) and (c) the angular velocity of FA relative to the N–N axis as the rotation vector of pristine FAPbI3 (black line) and Br-doped FAPbI3 (purple line), computed over the 6 ps MD trajectories at 300 K. (d) Schematic diagram of the FA cation rotating along the N–N axis vector in different visual angles. 
In order to explore the origin of the interesting phenomenon, we calculated the angular velocity of the FA cation (Fig. 1c) with the N–N axis as the rotation vector (three different views shown in Fig. 1d) using the 6 ps MD trajectories. The quantity can measure the time rate at which an FA rotates about the N–N axis vector. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, the Br-doped FAPbI3 system exhibits a denser distribution in the low rotation angular velocity regime than the pristine system, indicating that the FA rotation is suppressed upon Br doping, i.e. 1.69 × 10−6 degree per fs versus 1.67 × 10−6 degree per fs of the averaged angular velocity in the pristine and Br-doped systems. The result can be rationalized by the following factors. First, the N–H⋯Br hydrogen bond is stronger than the N–H⋯I hydrogen bond because the Br atom has a higher electronegativity than the I atom. Second, the higher electronegativity of Br serves to enhance the electrostatic interaction between FA and the inorganic lattice. Thus, the two factors rationalize the suppressed FA rotation despite Br atom being smaller than I atom. Slow rotation of FA cations correlated with a strong Pb–Br bond may stabilize the perovskite by suppressing the thermal fluctuations of Pb, I and Br atoms. To verify this hypothesis, we computed the averaged standard deviation of the position of each type of atom (FA, Pb, I, and Br) in the two systems and summarized it in Table 1 according to the formula . Here,  denotes the location of atom i, and the angular brackets indicate canonically averaging along the chosen 6 ps MD trajectories. The calculated overall standard deviations decrease from the pristine FAPbI3 to the Br-doped FAPbI3, indicating that Br doping suppresses the atomic motion. Analysis of the individual standard deviation of each type of atom shows that slow FA rotation may be responsible for inhibiting the inorganic lattice vibration due to the enhanced hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions between the organic and inorganic components. As a result, correlated organic–inorganic motion stabilizes the perovskite lattice and reduces electron-vibrational interactions. This conclusion should hold for Br-doped MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+) because the MA and Br atoms can form strong N–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds. The electrostatic interaction is even stronger than that in Br-doped FAPbI3 due to the larger dipole moment of MA. However, it is not safe to extend this conclusion to other hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites because the overall hydrogen bond interaction depends on the number of hydrogen atoms bound to highly electronegative atoms of given organic cations, such as oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and the strength of the electrostatic interaction relies on the dipole moment of the organic cations. Alternatively, this conclusion should not work for all-organic perovskites, such as CsPbI3, because there is a lack of hydrogen bonds and the electrostatic interaction is weak. In general, weak electron-vibration results in a slow loss of coherence and small NA coupling, which have an opposite influence on the nonradiative electron–hole recombination.

3.2. Electronic structure

Fig. 2 presents the projected density of states (PDOS) (top panel) and charge densities (bottom panel) of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM), calculated using the optimized geometries. The CBM and VBM primarily constitute the initial and final states for electron–hole recombination of the two systems under investigation. The PDOS is split into the contributions from FA, Pb, and halogen (I and Br) components. Fig. 2a shows that in FAPbI3 the VBM is primarily composed of I atomic orbitals with small contributions from Pb orbitals, while the CBM arises from the atomic orbitals of Pb. They are responsible for creating the NA coupling and driving nonradiative electron–hole recombination. However, FA cations contribute to neither the CBM nor the VBM, and therefore, they indirectly influence NA coupling and charge recombination via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. In the Br-doped FAPbI3 system, the bandgap increases to 1.39 eV from 1.31 eV of pristine FAPbI3, which is close to the experimental value.12 Typically, a larger bandgap tends to create small NA coupling because it makes the electronic and vibrational quanta away from resonance.
 Fig. 2  PDOS (top panel) and charge densities of VBM and CBM (bottom panel) are involved in the electron–hole recombination in (a) pristine FAPbI3 and (b) Br-doped FAPbI3. Zero energy is to the Fermi level. Br dopants significantly decrease the VBM charge densities and thus their overlap, reducing NA coupling. 
The NA coupling between the initial and final states primarily determines the nonradiative electron–hole recombination rate. We numerically calculated the NA coupling dij as the overlap of orbitals i and j at sequential time steps using the Hammes–Schiffer–Tully method:68  
In general, multiplying dij with a factor of -iħ to the above formula leads to the NA coupling having energy units in eV or meV. Here, H is the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian, Ṙ is the nuclear velocity, φi and φj are the wave functions for the orbitals i and j, and εj–εi is the corresponding energy gap. The larger overlap between the electron (CBM) and hole (VBM) wave functions, 〈φVBM(t)|φCBM(t + Δt)〉, facilitates creating stronger NA coupling. The hole wave function is mainly supported by I atoms and secondarily by Pb atoms, while the electron wave function is supported by the Pb atoms in pristine FAPbI3. This situation minimizes wave function mixing and leads to small NA coupling, rationalizing the long-lived charge carrier and high performance of FAPbI3 solar cells.69 Br dopants not only contribute little to the hole wave function, but also decrease the contribution from the neighboring I atoms, resulting in localization of the hole wave function and the reduction of the mixing with electron wave functions. As a consequence, the NA coupling is decreased. Furthermore, the nuclear velocity, dR/dt, entering the coupling matrix, also takes part in creating NA coupling. Note that the organic–inorganic motions are correlated rather than irrelevant via hydrogen bond interactions and electrostatic interactions. As reflected by the angular velocity of FA (Fig. 1c) and the averaged standard deviation (Table 1), the incorporation of Br into the FAPbI3 lattice suppresses the rotation of FA and the vibrations of both organic and inorganic components due to the enhanced mutual hydrogen bond interactions and electrostatic interactions, which further reduces NA coupling.
To deepen our understanding of the change in NA coupling arising from the thermal-induced variation of charge localization, we computed the inverse participation ratio (IPR)70,71 of the VBM and CBM along the 1.5 ps MD trajectories for the two systems under study. The IPR of a specific KS state is defined as , which characterizes the degree of charge localization of a given KS orbital. Here, the values of IPR lying between 0 and 1 correspond to a fully charge delocalized and localized state, respectively. Therefore, a large IPR value represents a localized state, while a small value corresponds to a delocalized state. N denotes the number of grids of a given eigenstate and ki indicates the charge density within the volume of a unit grid. Fig. 3 shows that the average IPR value of the CBM differs slightly, while the value of the VBM notably increases upon Br doping, because electrons are residing on Pb atoms while holes are supported by I atoms that have a strong response to the replacement of partial I with Br. The strong localization of the VBM indicates highly localized holes that separate electrons and holes in the Br-doped FAPbI3, decreasing the NA coupling (Table 2). The analysis is in full agreement with the charge densities shown in Fig. 2.

3.3. Electron–vibrational interactions
To characterize the phonon modes taking part in electron–hole recombination in the pristine and Br-doped FAPbI3 systems, we computed the phonon total density of states (TDOS) and phonon PDOS using the optimized geometries. The phonon PDOS is splitting into contributions to Pb, halogen and FA ions. The TDOS shows that the phonon frequencies remain identical in the two systems associated with a slight decrease in the intensities of the entire spectrum of FAPbI3 upon Br doping, as shown in Fig. 4a and the inset. It indeed indicates that Br doping suppresses atomic motions. Analysis of the phonon PDOS demonstrates that the frequencies below 300 cm−1 arise primarily from the I–Pb inorganic lattice and secondarily from the organic cation while the frequencies ranging from 300 to 3600 cm−1 are totally originating from the FA cations, Fig. 4b. All of the phonon modes couple to electronic subsystems, cause loss of coherence, and accommodate the excess electronic energy lost during nonradiative charge recombination. To resolve which phonon mode plays a dominant role in determining charge dynamics, we performed Fourier transforms (FTs) of the unnormalized autocorrelation function (un-ACF) of phonon-induced fluctuations for the VBM–CBM energy gap in two systems. The FTs shown in Fig. 4c demonstrate that low-frequency vibrations in the 30–300 cm−1 range dominate the overall spectral density for both the pristine and Br-doped systems. The strongest peak at 100 cm−1 can be attributed to the bending and stretching mode of the inorganic Pb–I lattice.72 The side peak around 40 cm−1 can be ascribed to the [PbI6]4− octahedral distortion.73 These phonon modes are directly responsible for creating the majority of NA coupling and promoting nonradiative electron–hole recombination. A similar observation was reported by Chu et al. that low-frequency phonon modes arising from the Pb–I inorganic lattice exclusively couple to the key states, create the NA coupling, and drive the charge dynamics in the MAPbI3 perovskite.54 The minor peak above 150 cm−1 can be assigned to the librations of the organic cations, which affects the NA coupling indirectly.72 Incorporation of Br into the lattice lowers the intensities of most peaks, especially at 100 cm−1 and 40 cm−1, because Br dopants enhance the mutual interaction between the organic and inorganic components and suppress their collective motions. This leads to the quantum decoherence time decreasing from the pristine FAPbI3 to Br-doped system, Table 2.

(c) Spectral density obtained from Fourier transforms (FTs) of autocorrelation functions for the fluctuation of energy gap. (d) Pure-dephasing functions for pristine FAPbI3 and FAPbI3 with Br doping. 

Fig. 4d presents the pure-dephasing function, Dij(t), calculated using the second-order cumulant approximation of optical response theory:32. Here, Cij(t) = 〈δEij(t′)δEij(t − t′)〉t′ is the un-ACF of the thermal fluctuation for the VBM–CBM energy gap δEij(t). Fitting the curves in Fig. 4d to a Gaussian exp(−0.5(t/τ)2) gives the pure-dephasing time τ in Table 2. The decoherence times are short, at around 10 fs. Such short-lived quantum coherence favors long-lived excited states, as exemplified by the quantum Zeno effect.74 Contrary to the replacement of heavier I with lighter Cl in HOIPs shortening decoherence time,75 Br doping increases the decoherence time because of the suppressed atomic fluctuations due to enhanced organic–inorganic interactions, Table 1 and Fig. 1c.
3.4. Nonradiative electron–hole recombination

Fig. 5 shows the time evolution population decay of the CBM for the pristine and Br-doped FAPbI3 systems. Here, the bandgap of FAPbI3 was scaled to an experimental value of 1.47 eV.12 The same constant was applied to the scale bandgap of Br-doped FAPbI3. The nonradiative electron–hole recombinations, summarized in Table 2, are obtained using the short-time linear approximation to the exponential decay function P(t) = exp(−t/τ) ≈ 1 − t/τ. The charge recombination occurs over 1 ns in both systems. This is beneficial for minimizing charge and energy losses and improving the performance of perovskite solar cells.76 The calculations show that Br doping reduces electron–hole recombination and extends the charge carrier lifetime to 1.5 ns, which takes place in 1.1 ns in pristine FAPbI3 and agrees well with the experiment data.69
 Fig. 5  Electron–hole recombination dynamics in pristine FAPbI3 and Br-doped FAPbI3. 
The charge recombination time scale is determined by the energy gap, NA coupling and pure-dephasing time. In general, a smaller energy gap, stronger NA coupling, and slower pure-dephasing lead to faster charge recombination. The nonradiative transition rate is exponentially related to the energy gap according to the energy gap law,77 and is proportional to the NA coupling squared according to Fermi's golden rule,78 and depends on the decoherence subtly. Furthermore, the NA coupling is inversely proportional to the energy gap and is proportional to the nuclei velocities based on the formula: . Therefore, the energy gap affects the recombination rate by both affecting NA coupling and directly entering in the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Doping FAPbI3 with Br increases the canonically averaged bandgap by only 0.08 eV and the NA coupling correspondingly decreases by about 5.44%, which is notably smaller than the overall reduction by about 12.2%. Therefore, the decrease of NA coupling (Table 2) mainly arises from the strong localization of hole wavefunctions (Fig. 3) and suppresses nuclear velocities and FA rotation (Table 1 and Fig. 1c) in Br-doped FAPbI3. At the same time, the suppressed electron–vibrational interactions also extend the coherence time (Table 2). Overall, the small NA coupling and the large energy gap beat the long decoherence time, delaying nonradiative electron–hole recombination in Br-doped FAPbI3. It is important to emphasize that the slight increase of bandgap upon Br doping not only decreases NA coupling leading to the reduction of the electron–hole recombination, but also increases the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. The study emphasizes the importance of correlated organic–inorganic motion retarding electron–hole recombination and provides valuable guidelines for the design of high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.
4. Conclusion
Using a combination of NA-MD and real-time TDDFT, we investigated the recent time-resolved experiment18 to explore the atomistic origin of the observed reduction of charge recombination in the FAPbI3 perovskite upon Br doping. The calculations show how the correlated organic–inorganic motion significantly affects the charge carrier lifetime, which was believed to be governed by the inorganic lattices in HOIPs. Incorporation of Br into FAPbI3 stabilizes the lattice and enhances the strength of hydrogen bond interactions and electrostatic interactions between organic and inorganic components, which inhibit the rotation of the FA cations and coherently suppress the overall atomic fluctuations due to the correlated motion between the two components. The reduced atomic motion delays the decoherence for accelerating charge recombination upon Br doping. Alternatively, the decreased nuclear velocities correlated with highly localized hole wave functions reduce the NA coupling. The NA coupling is further decreased due to an enlarged bandgap, which is beneficial to prolong the excited state lifetime. Multiple vibrational modes arising from both inorganic and organic components couple to the electronic subsystem and induce rapid decoherence. As a result, the recombination time scales are over 1 ns in FAPbI3 and extend to 1.5 ns upon Br doping due to the small NA coupling and the larger bandgap competing successfully with the relatively long decoherence time, agreeing well with the experiment.69 The study advances our understanding of the correlated motion influencing the excited-state charge carrier lifetime and provides critical insights for improving the performance of perovskite solar cells and optoelectronics by halogen alloying.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Simulation cells showing the optimized geometries for pristine FAPbI3 and Br-doped FAPbI3. (b) The averaged Pb–I bond lengths (Å) and the averaged equatorial I–Pb–I bond angles (inset) and (c) the angular velocity of FA relative to the N–N axis as the rotation vector of pristine FAPbI3 (black line) and Br-doped FAPbI3 (purple line), computed over the 6 ps MD trajectories at 300 K. (d) Schematic diagram of the FA cation rotating along the N–N axis vector in different visual angles.	 

Pristine	0.857	0.426	0.465	—
Br-doped	0.811	0.353	0.415	0.451

 	Fig. 2  PDOS (top panel) and charge densities of VBM and CBM (bottom panel) are involved in the electron–hole recombination in (a) pristine FAPbI3 and (b) Br-doped FAPbI3. Zero energy is to the Fermi level. Br dopants significantly decrease the VBM charge densities and thus their overlap, reducing NA coupling.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 3  Time-evolution inverse participation ratio (IPR) of (a) VBM and (b) CBM for pristine FAPbI3 and Br-doped FAPbI3 along the 1.5 ps MD trajectories. The numbers shown in the insets represent the average values of IPR. The larger the IPR, the stronger the charge localization is.	 

Pristine	1.4712	0.90	9.55	1.1
Br-doped	1.5579	0.79	10.9	1.5

 	Fig. 4  (a) Phonon total density of states (TDOS) and (b) phonon PDOS of pristine FAPbI3 and Br-doped FAPbI3 calculated using the optimized geometries. The inset in (a) shows the zoom-in local TDOS. (c) Spectral density obtained from Fourier transforms (FTs) of autocorrelation functions for the fluctuation of energy gap. (d) Pure-dephasing functions for pristine FAPbI3 and FAPbI3 with Br doping.	 

 	Fig. 5  Electron–hole recombination dynamics in pristine FAPbI3 and Br-doped FAPbI3.
