    , Accepted 5th February 2020First published on 10th February 2020AbstractTwo important factors in solar cells are efficiency and long-term stability. The commercialization of halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing organic cations may be limited due to their low stability, in spite of their high efficiency. The molecular features of the organic cations adopted in perovksites belong to a subset of ammonium cations, such as methylammonium (MA), which are known to display poor humidity stability. Based on the molecular aspects of organic cations, the humidity stability of perovskites can be affected by their structural stability, the hydrophobicity, chemical environment near the heteroatom, and stereochemistry. Organic cations with large ionic radii produce two-dimensional (2D) structures with significantly improved stability. 2D perovskites show high humidity stability due to their increased chemical stability and hydrophobicity, but have the drawback of slow charge transport due to the insulating properties of the organic cations. Accordingly, many efforts have been devoted to form conductive inorganic layers in 2D perovskites in addition to the light-active layer of PSCs in several ways. In this perspective, we have analyzed the possible degradation initiators formed under humid conditions based on a comprehensive review of the literature, followed by practical experimental results using ammonium-driven PSCs, focusing on their humidity stability and device performance. As a strategy to enhance the wet-fastness of perovskites, we propose new under-explored sulfonium cations (R3S+), showing characteristic stereochemistry and significantly increased humidity stability of perovskites, which differ from conventional protic ammonium cations.

Broader context
Long-term stability of halide perovskite-based devices has been a challenging issue to the commercialization, despite promising optoelectric properties. Material engineering of the perovskites can be the most straightforward way to improve humidity stability. However, although structural (dimension) flexibility is high, typically adopted cations have been limited to the ammonium cations, which have been known to irreversibly degrade by forming perovskite hydrates and/or gaseous products upon attack of water. Newly studied sulfonium-driven perovskites showed the unique geometries with enhanced humidity stability compared to typical MAPbI3 perovskites. The phase tuning of 3-dimensional perovskites into the lower dimension using large sulfonium cations can be a strategy to strengthen chemical and humidity stability. In this context, current perspective emphasizes the molecular aspects of perovskites, which is suggested by analyzing experimental and theoretical results on the degradation of perovskites under humid condition. Exploring new organic cations beyond typical ammoniums will open up the diverse research arena regarding their application to robust optoelectronics.

1. Introduction
The emergence of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (HPs) has triggered great advances in a variety of research fields, including photovoltaics (PVs), field-emission transistors (FETs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), etc.1,2 The practical advantages of HPs include their structural diversity, high absorption coefficients, ambipolar charge transport, and low carrier effective mass. Moreover, their economic benefits arise from low-cost components and solution-based fabrication process.3 In particular, the dimensional flexibility (structural versatility)4 of perovskites can be realized using appropriate organic cations, which have the potential to confer the desired properties for targeted applications (e.g. two-dimensional (2D) perovskites inducing quantum confinement for use in LEDs) (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  A Schematic representation of the different dimensionalities of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (HPs) depending on the type of organic cations employed. The octahedra and purple spheres indicate metal halides and small organic cations such as MA or FA, respectively. The center image is a simple cubic lattice of HPs. The values reported in the parenthesis are the ionic radius (taken from ref. 4 and 26). The structural configuration of low-dimensional metal halide frameworks can be varied depending on the cations employed. 
Despite the comparable photovoltaic properties of perovskites solar cells (PSCs) to those of silicone solar cells,5 stability issues pose a challenge for the commercialization of PSCs. Prototype perovskites, which are based on 3D methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), undergo decomposition when exposed to humid air.6 Considerable efforts are being made to compensate for the hygroscopic nature of methylammonium (MA) cations in perovskites. These efforts include: (i) encapsulation of the device,7 (ii) modification of the electron or hole transporting layer with components exhibiting hydrophobic properties,8 (iii) controlling the surface morphology of perovskites by employing small molecules (e.g. functionalization of the surface with hydrophobic cations9 or the use of a small organic mediator to form a complex such as MAI⋯X⋯PbI2),10 (iv) manipulation of an A- or X-site in ABX3 perovskites, which induces the formation of layered 2D hybrid perovskites (e.g. Ruddlesden–Popper phases)11 or pseudo-halide perovskites,12 and (v) interface engineering (e.g. 3D/2D hybrid perovskites).13
Among these efforts, material engineering in perovskites is the most straightforward method to improve their humidity stability. In particular, organic A-site cations have a high degree of freedom for molecular engineering to tune 3D perovskites. For example, larger cations (A′ versus small cation A), which induce a Goldschmidt tolerance factor14 of >1, can be intercalated between the inorganic layers of the corner-sharing PbX64− octahedra,15 resulting in 2D perovskites with a general formula of A′2(A)n−1BnX3n+1, where B refers to a divalent metal, X is a halide anion, and n is an integer representing the number of metal halide monolayer sheets.
When compared to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites are known to exhibit enhanced humidity-tolerance because of their hydrophobic properties arising from the aliphatic- or aromatic-based organic spacers. However, the positive aspects of the hydrophobic spacers on the humidity stability of 2D perovskites can conflict with the factors that affect the photovoltaic conversion efficiency. In particular, the out-of-plane arrangement of the spacer unit may act as an insulating layer between the conducting layers of the perovskite, hindering charge transport and consequently, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Significant effort has been devoted to reducing the excitonic nature of the charge carriers in 2D PSCs,16–19 recording recent efficiencies of ∼15%.18 In an effort to maintain the high efficiency of 3D PSCs, the generation of a 3D/2D junction (interface) or passivation layer has been reported to be achieved by the addition of large cations, improving the humidity stability to be comparable to those of 3D perovskites.20–22
Since the advent of HPs, the organic cation candidates have been mainly limited to the protonated ammonium cations (e.g. RNH3+).23 Other heteroatom-based cations have not been extensively studied. However, the previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the protic ammonium cations (e.g. CH3NH3+ in MAPbI3) degrade upon attack by base or radical species under a moist environment, causing very poor wet-fastness.24,25 On the other hand, little has been reported on perovskites containing aprotic cations beyond the ammonium core. Recently, a new perovskite ((CH3)3SPbI3, TMSPbI3) employing trimethyl sulfonium (TMS) has been synthesized.26 The resulting 1D perovskite exhibited a wide band gap (3.1 eV) and higher polarity (vs. ammonium cations, observed in our study), which hinders its application as an efficient 3D PSC. Nonetheless, the high chemical (structural) stability of TMSPbI3 suggests that the sulfonium core is a promising candidate for the robust cations. Furthermore, a variety of sulfonium derivatives inducing a large bandgap can be designed as not only the organic components in perovskites used for tandem cells,27 but also the passivation layer in 3D PSCs28 and low-dimensional applications. Related to their successful assembly into perovskites, understanding the sulfonium cations on a molecular level is important considering their different geometry and chemical nature (e.g. stereochemistry, size, and electronegativity) can affect degradation as well as solution-based processing for the thin film formation.29
Herein, we summarize (i) instability of 3D perovskites arising from the degradation under humid conditions, focusing on the molecular aspects and (ii) representative results on the improvement of humidity stability upon introducing large cations (mostly ammonium cations). Finally, the characteristics of sulfonium cations as an alternative to ammonium cations are discussed focusing on expanding this new family of organic–inorganic hybrids for the development of wet-fast perovskites, based on both experimental and theoretical results.
2. Degradation of perovskites by humidity
The intrinsic instability of 3D perovskites, which arises from the hygroscopic properties of their organic cations,6 low formation energy,30,31 and/or phase stabilization (e.g. phase transition of black α-FAPbI3 to yellow δ-FAPbI3) has been the main obstacle for the commercialization of PSCs despite of their impressive solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies (>25%).5 In this sense, it is necessary to understand the possible initiators inducing the degradation process by humidity and their concomitant mechanisms, which is important for the molecular engineering of robust perovskites. Consideration of the degradation products and rates depending on different humidity parameters (e.g. inert gas, ambient air, vacuum, light, different % relative humidity (RH), etc.) and the adjacent layers (e.g. HTLs, ETLs) has been excluded from current discussion due to some discrepancies in degradation products detected under similar humid conditions.32 Instead, we have focused on what is mainly responsible for the humidity-induced degradation of perovskites. Although the exact degradation process is still not clear, the plausible intermediates and degradation products depending on the type of initiators can be proposed from previously reported results by combining the experimental and theoretical results. As shown in Fig. 2, neutral water, hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), and/or hydroxide (OH−) have been considered as the degradation initiators in perovskites under humid conditions. In general, water from humid air has been suggested to act as a catalyst during the degradation of perovskites. Kelly et al.24 suggested that the formation of a low-dimensional hydrated phase (MAPbI3·nH2O) is the first step of the degradation process based on the observation of the isolated PbI64− using in situ GIXRD (cf. eqn (1) and (2) in Fig. 2). They claimed that the acid–base reaction33 (eqn (4) in Fig. 2) was not the first step in the degradation process, due to the partial recovery of a black phase from the yellow hydrated phase following flushing dry N2 gas over the perovskite films degraded under 98 ± 2% RH. Later, Sit et al. reported ab initio calculations on the adsorption of water on the (110) surface of perovskites, which showed a negative adsorption energy of −40.2 kcal mol−1.25 However, oxonium ions (H3O+), which may be a product from the acid–base reaction between water and methylammonium (MA), were not formed. Their follow-up study on the degradation pathways induced by H2O showed that the formation of the monohydrate phase (Fig. 2, MAPbI3·H2O(s); s for solids) of perovskites was exothermic, with a reaction energy of −50.2 kcal mol−1 (eqn (1) in Fig. 2).34

The (s) and (l) indicate solid and liquid, respectively. 
However, no further exothermic reactions involving methylamine gas were observed during the reaction between water and MAPbI3 perovskites. Other studies have shown that the solvation of MAI (eqn (3) in Fig. 2) is the first step in degradation process by using experimental35 and ab initio molecular dynamics.36 Thus, these findings imply that water from humid air catalyzes the degradation reaction of perovskites, by forming the hydrated perovskites.
Water can also exist in other forms such as hydroxyl and hydroxide during processing of materials in humid air.37,38 These species can be formed via dissociation or the reaction between water and oxygen.39 The presence of hydroxyl or hydroxide on the surface and point defects of perovskites is known to accelerate their decomposition.40,41 It is apparent that the degradation products are dependent on the different types of initiators (Fig. 2). In addition to forming perovskite hydrates caused by catalytic water, gaseous species have also been investigated experimentally.7,42,43 It is clear that the detection of volatile methylamine was due to hydrogen abstraction from the MA cation.33 Based on the theoretical results on the degradation of MAPbI3 in the presence of the three possible initiators, hydroxyl and hydroxide (not H2O) were associated with the hydrogen transfer reaction from MA, which facilitates the desorption of methylamine, resulting in the irreversible decomposition of perovskites (eqn (6) and (8) in Fig. 2).34 It was predicted that the proton transfers from MA to OH− or ˙OH was rapid (<2 ps from AIMD) and methylamine drifted along the perovskite surface. Furthermore, the infiltration of water was calculated with the aid of CI-NEB, from which the Pb–O bonds formed between the oxygen atoms in ˙OH (or OH−) and Pb atoms. The formation of the Pb–O bond may be related to degradation products such as PbO and Pb(OH)2 (eqn (5) and (7) in Fig. 2), which were detected experimentally.44 In the presence of ˙OH (or OH−), the degradation reactions involving gaseous products (eqn (5)–(8) in Fig. 2) predicted thermodynamically favorable reaction energies.
It is interesting to note that the charges trapped along the grain boundaries can trigger the humidity (or oxygen)-induced degradation of perovskites in the irreversible process, which is similar to the acid–base reaction shown in eqn (4).45,46 To prove the trapped-charge assisted degradation of perovskites under humid air conditions, Choi et al. constructed an experimental set-up employing an ion generator using corona discharge and a chamber connected to the inlet to regulate the humidity.45 The different polarity of ions was produced by the N2+ and H2− corona ions. The irreversible decomposition of perovskites was only observed when humidity was present on the charge-deposited perovskite films. According to the evolution of the XRD patterns and morphology of the ion-deposited films under humidified N2+ with time, it was found that the degradation process begins at the grain boundaries (Fig. 2c–f). Furthermore, the results obtained from KPFM for the negative ion treated perovskite film showed that the surface potential distribution of perovskite surface was consistent with its corresponding topology (Fig. 2a and b). Eqn (9) shows the proposed mechanism based on the experimental observations combined with a follow-up modeling study.46 Briefly, unlike the case of the neutral MAPbI3 surface (without trapped charge), a significant change in the atomic motions was observed on the charged surface of MAPbI3. The evolution of volatile gas (HI and CH3NH2) was observed for the negative charged surface, while the positively charged surface induced the solvation of CH3NH3+ (eqn (3)). Based on the species identified using AIMD, the authors suggest that the degradation of the negatively charged MAPbI3 occurs in a sequential manner involving proton transfer (eqn (9)), which is similar to the Grotthuss mechanism,47 rather than direct proton transfer. It is believed that the driving force for the formation of the initially solvated MA or I− is due to the new electrostatic force field formed by the excessive charge, which helps weaken the existing bond between MA and PbI64− or repels the I− ions away from the MAPbI3 surface.
Despite the outstanding achievements in the performance of perovskite-based devices, the absence of standard measuring conditions for their stability obscures the main cause of discrepancies in the degradation products and rate. In particular, the degradation rate of perovskites, which undergo a hydrated phase, is difficult to determine without in situ techniques due to the reversibility between the black and transparent phases. For example, n-butylammonium-treated MAPbI3 shows XRD peaks corresponding to the hydrated phase6 in the early stage of the degradation process,29 while some other cation-driven perovskites degrade with a characteristic peak of PbI2. A precise and full detection for the degradation phenomena (especially, gaseous products) requires additional apparatus (e.g. mass analyzer) and in situ analytical techniques connected to a humidity chamber. Such an approach helps the prediction of the long-term degradation (lifetime) of perovskites, which will contribute to the construction of a reliable database for the materials properties.
3. The use of large cations to enhance humidity stability of perovskites
Tuning A-site cations to improve the poor wet-fastness of 3D-ABX3 perovskites is limited to cations with a small ionic radius (e.g. 2.17 Å for MA) due to the tolerance factor48 forming perovskites. Currently, MA and FA (formamidinium) are representative organic cations used to construct 3D perovskites. Unlike small cations, larger cations (vs. MA), which can provide functionality, have opened the door for their application in 2D perovskites as well as lower dimensional perovskites (1D, 0D). Their sizes are too large to be accommodated into the A-site cage of 3D lead-halide lattice (center image describing perovskite cage in Fig. 1) and thus, give rise to dimensional flexibility with unique and diverse physical properties. Fig. 1 shows that a wide range of structural (dimensional) tunability in perovskites can be achieved depending on the ionic radius (or geometry) of the cations, covering from 3D corner-sharing metal–halide octahedra to 0D comprised of isolated octahedra or clusters of BX64− (e.g. A4BX6).49
According to assembling methods of large cations into perovskite films, large cations can play an important role in some aspects including the stability, passivation of surface defects (or grain boundaries), tuning the energy level, and/or crystal growth. The related details will be discussed below.
3.1. Formation of 2D perovskites

Table 1 shows the representative large-sized organic cations used to form perovskite films in different ways. Among these examples, 2D perovskites have been actively explored to overcome the poor humidity stability of 3D perovskites.17,50 They feature single or multi layers (quasi 2D) cut to form the specific crystallographic directions of 3D cubic perovskites. Thus, they can form different chemical formulas depending on the direction of the cut in 3D perovskite crystal (e.g. 〈100〉, 〈110〉, and 〈111〉), together with the number of inorganic slabs (n = 1, 2,…, if n = ∞, then a 3D perovskite).4 Also, the different nomenclature can be applied to distinguish the relative stacking fashion of the inorganic layers, which is governed by the steric demand of the interlayered organic spacers. The stacking fashion of inorganic slabs is either staggered, eclipsed, or in between, which makes RP (Ruddlesden–Popper),11,51–53 DJ (Dion–Jacobson),54–57 ACI (alternating cations in the interlayer space),58 and AV (Aurivilius)59 2D perovskites. Among these layered 2D HPs, the most crystallographically proven structures are RP phases, with only a few DJ phases taking the second place. Except some case,61 large monovalent (+1 of A′) and divalent (+2 of A′) cations can generally form the RP ((A′)2(A)n−1BnX3n+1) and DJ ((A′)(A)n−1BnX3n+1) phase, respectively, where the A-site accommodates small-sized monovalent cations such as MA and B-site can be divalent inorganic groups (e.g. Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, Cu2+, etc.).

Upon comparison with humidity stability and photovoltaic performances of PSCs (Table 1), 2D perovskites provided better humidity stability than 3D PSCs but at the expense of PCEs. In 2D perovskites, multiple quantum wells (QWs)72 are induced by the multi-layered inorganic slabs (wells) sandwiched by the insulating organic spacers (barriers). Therefore, as the number of inorganic slabs increases from n = 1 to ∞, the corresponding bandgap decreases. This QW effect confines the charge carriers, which is in turn lead to the limited charge transport, lowering PCE. Recently, to not only save the hydrophobic nature of the organic spacer but also address the low conductivity in 2D PSCs, the preferential alignment of inorganic slabs perpendicular to the substrate has been achieved by an additive18 or hot-casting technique.57,73 For example, 2D-(BA)2(MA)2Pb3I1019 is formed using a hot-casting method to give an out-of-plane arrangement of inorganic slabs with near single-crystal quality. This feature facilitates continuous charge transport across the electrodes, leading to the increased mobility and PCE (12.52%) (when compared to the RT-casting method).51 Later, Chen et al.18 reported that the MACl-assisted perovskite film (2D-(ThMA)2(MA)2Pb3I10) produced a nanorod-like morphology. The MACl additive helps the crystal growth and the orientation in 2D perovskites, with only (111) and (202) textured and PCE was significantly improved from 1.74 to 15.42%, which emphasizes the effect of the vertical alignment of 2D-MA(n−1)PbnI(3n+1)2− and crystallinity in PCE.
Despite many reports regarding the improved stability of 2D (vs. 3D) perovskites, a systematic comparison of their stability based on the structural features of the cations is limited, due to the different measuring conditions, device contact,74 morphology,36,75 and/or neighboring transporting layers24 affecting the stability. Thus, some interesting points pertaining to the geometrical features and stability of 2D perovskites are focused on this perspective. In this regard, the former aspects, the formation of the expected 2D phase based on the oxidation state of cations does not appear to be strictly followed due to the structural flexibility caused by the size, stereochemistry, and/or bonding modes between the organic species and halide groups in the inorganic slabs. Specifically, aliphatic monovalent cations (e.g. CH3(CH2)mNH3+, m = 4–9) typically used in HPs are modified into divalent cations to form 2D perovskites with the chemical formula of (NH3CmH2mNH3)(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–4).61 However, divalent cation-mediated perovskites containing long chains are structurally assigned to RP phase (cf. otherwise, DJ phase is formed when introducing divalent cations) by a combination of XRD, Hamilton significance test,76 and DFT results. The octyl chain in the divalent ammonium cations adopts the folded conformations (like a compressed spring) within the neighboring inorganic slabs. This flexible feature of the long alkyl chains offsets the inorganic slabs by half of the PbI64− (∼ 3.2 Å) to produce RP phase, which differs from monovalent cations with stretched-out conformations or simple inorganic cations.
It is important to point out the effect of the structural difference in 2D perovskite on their stabilization. 2D-DJ phase has been considered to confer the structural rigidity by forming perfect displacement of the inorganic layers compared to the RP phase, which has an offset of inorganic slabs and double layer of monovalent organic spacers.50 Furthermore, while the RP phase has a van der Waals gap arising from the weak interactions between two sheets of interlayered organic cations, the divalent cations in DJ phase strengthen the structural stability by forming H-bonds between the organic and inorganic layers at both ends of the cations.57 In practice, the structure-stabilizing effect by the divalent cations (PDA: propane-1,3-diammonium) in the layered 2D-DJ perovskites has been reported.57,77 When compared to the PA-driven RP phase, which shows moderate stability, divalent cation-based DJ analogs show significantly improved stability against all environmental parameters including humidity, damp heat, and light (Table 1). 2D-DJ-(PDA)(MA)3Pb4I13 conserved 95% of the initial PCE after 4000 h under 40–70% RH in ambient air (cf. 75% loss of the initial PCE in the case of the PA-driven RP phase). In addition, the increased phase purity of DJ phase resulted in higher mobility and reduced charge recombination, achieving an efficiency of 13.3%. As another example of DJ phase, Kanatzidis and co-workers reported two series of 2D perovskites (n = 1–4) upon the introduction of piperidinium derivatives (AMP; aminomethyl piperidinium).54 The increased oxidation state (2+) of the divalent cations contributes to decreasing distance observed between the inorganic slabs, inducing the greater interlayer electronic coupling (anti-bonding interaction) accompanied by shortened I⋯I distances (∼4 Å for n = 4 employing 3AMP). The resulting destabilized VBM (valence band maximum) gives rise to a lower band gap than RP analogs with relatively flexible stacking of layers. A champion efficiency of 7.32% was achieved using the 3AMP-driven DJ perovskites (n = 3), which reflect the positive effect of more rigid (less distorted inorganic slabs) structures on the charge transport as well as the light harvesting. Although experimental results obtained for stability were not shown in this study, an increased fastness to environmental parameters is expected, due to the aforementioned structural rigidity. Recently, a series of FA-based DJ type of perovskites has been realized by the introduction of the divalent cation, PDMA (1,4-phenylenedimethanammonium).56 Characteristic layered 2D perovskites were identified by the large Stokes shift (>100 nm for n > 2), which was associated with the “layered edge state” (LES)78 and/or interphase charge transfer cascade process.79 The resulting DJ-(PDMA)FA2Pb3I10 PSCs achieved a PCE > 7% without the use of an anti-solvent or additive (cf. otherwise, more increase in PCE18). In addition, they showed resilience to humid air where >85% of the initial PCE was conserved for 60 d under 30–50% RH and dark conditions.
Within the DJ family of perovskites that display improved chemical stability (vs. RP phase), the stereochemistry of the cations plays a crucial role in reinforcing their structural rigidity, provided that the structural isomers of the piperidinium derivatives, which are sandwiched between inorganic slabs, form H-bonds with the iodine atoms in different bonding modes.54 As a result, the interaction modes (distortion of octahedra) between the H-donors and iodine atoms affect the materials stability as well as their optical properties and device performance.
3.2. Manipulation of large cations to passivate 3D perovskites
In addition to the introduction of large cations to produce 2D perovskites, they can be applied not only as an additive in 3D perovskite films, but also for the construction of hybrid-type perovskites. The main concept is that the superior optoelectronic properties of 3D perovskites remain almost unchanged, but functionality is added to enhance stability, quality of crystalline phase, and/or charge transport by tuning the energy band. With a small number of large cations as the guest cation (via compositional optimization), it was found that they exist on the grain boundaries and/or surface of the perovskites, thus conferring the passivation of vulnerable sites against charge recombination and humidity.21,22,29
According to the results obtained for mixed-cation perovskites such as Cs0.05FA0.80 MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3,22 introducing alkylated ammonium (2–3 mol% vs. Pb) into 3D perovskites has a positive effect on the power conversion efficiency of PSCs including preferential crystal orientation, higher crystallization, and larger grain size (∼860 nm). In particular, propylammonium (PA) helps crystal growth normal to the substrate. Results observed using GIWAX showed doubled intensity at the azimuthal angle (π = 0) for the (001) reflection. In addition, when comparing transient absorption (TA) and reflection (TR) spectra, the decay kinetics obtained from TR spectra were much faster, indicating that the surface has more trap sites when compared to the bulk of perovskites. The decay kinetics were much slower after adding 3 mol% of PA (vs. Pb). On the other hand, some aliphatic ammonium cations such as ethane-1,2-diammnonium (EDA)62 and tert-butyl diammonium (tBA)80 can be incorporated into 3D perovskite lattice (mostly on the surface) accompanied by lattice expansion. Here, compositional optimization is one of key factors affecting PCE as an excess of cations can form low-dimensional perovskites, which cause the low mobility of the charge carriers. Under a controlled composition ratio, the reaction of the cations with the unreacted PbI2 on 3D perovskite surface imparted the uniform morphology of 3D perovskite, consequently contributing to the passivation of any defects. From this finding, alkylated ammonium cations used as guest cations can play an important role in the stabilization of 3D perovskites, the orientation of 3D crystal growth, and passivation of the grain boundaries and/or surface of perovskites.
By using the aforementioned large ammonium cation derivatives, 3D/2D hybrid-type13,20,66–71 (or hetero-structured65) perovskites were also used to secure both stability and photovoltaic performance. Many examples covering simple aliphatic-65,66 and aromatic-68 ammonium cations to functionalized analogs-13,69–71 driven RP phase perovskites, which are formed on top (or at the grain boundaries) of 3D perovskites have been reported, achieving efficiencies up to ∼21%. Apart from the improved stability, the reduced ion migration and accumulation benefit from the 2D capping layer between 3D perovskites and HTM, resulting in reduced hysteresis and an increase in Voc when compared to 3D perovskites. Modification of the side groups in the large cations can boost the functionality for the desired stability. For example, 2D perovskite of an interlayer based on a fluorinated aliphatic ammonium (A43; (CF3)3CO(CH2)3NH3+)70 showed similar stability to that of its corresponding 2D-(A43)2PbI4 PSCs under the same operating conditions for 100 h, indicating the robustness of the fluorinated 2D phase during the initial stage of the degradation process. Similarly, a perfluorinated arene (pentafluoro-phenylehtylammonium69) was adopted to derive the FEA-based 2D phase of perovskites. As expected, the functionalization of PEA by fluorine atoms resulted in reduced dispersion forces and thus, a hydrophobic surface on the resulting 3D/2D hybrids (surface free energy = 24.3 mJ m−2). A humidity stability test conducted at 40% RH under operating conditions (AM1.5) showed good resilience, conserving 90% of the initial PCE for 1000 h. In spite of the resulting 2D phase having mosaicity but still out-of-plane alignment, the FEA-driven 3D/2D PSCs delivered an excellent efficiency of 22.16%.
Despite of the significant progress reported to date, long-term stability without sacrificing performance is still needed to be achieved for practical applications. In particular, as can be seen at Table 1, most of the 2D capping layers are based on A2PbX4 (including some higher membered analogs), which may be thermodynamically favorable to form.61 Nonetheless, it is expected that the exact control of the 2D phase with target n plays an important role in finding an optimal point where both stability and performance are boosted. To realize this, exact assignment of 2D phase formed, which is frequently ambiguous, should be addressed first.
4. Potential application of sulfonium cations in perovskites to improve humidity stability
As shown in Table 1, many organic cations have been assembled into different dimensional halide perovskites. Nonetheless, most of them are limited to the structural pool based on ammonium cations (e.g. RNH3+). Furthermore, the lack of a systematic comparison of humidity stability arising from different A-site organic cations has led us to have the following questions. Do the widely employed protic ammonium cation cores guarantee humidity stability of perovskites? To explore different types of cations (e.g. S+), what are the important parameters that affect the wet-fastness of perovskites?
By considering all of the possible degraded products formed under humid conditions (Fig. 2) combined with our previous results29 (discussed below), the key molecular aspects of the organic cations that affect humidity stability of perovskites may include: (i) the phase stability of perovskites (or structural rigidity), (ii) the hydrophobicity of the side chains, (iii) the chemical environment near the heteroatom, and (iv) the stereochemistry. Regarding the phase stabilization of 3D perovskites, MAPbBr3 (vs. MAPbI3) is known to impart improved wet-fastness. The smaller atom size of Br (vs. I) forms a smaller lattice25 by forming stronger hydrogen bonds between the Br atoms and protons in MA (the shorter distance of Br⋯H vs. I⋯H), which consequently produces improved wet-fastness.45 Similarly, large cations that can still be incorporated into the perovskite lattice will play an important role in improving the stability of perovskites. For example, Nazeeruddin et al. successfully incorporated the large guanidinium cation (C(NH2)3+; GA), which has an ionic size of 2.78 Å, into the MAPbI3 matrix.81 The computed results showed that MA0.75GA0.25PbI3 has multiple H-bonding modes from the six available sites in the lattice, which accounts for the materials stability. On the other hand, the incorporation of TMS (trimethyl sulfonium), which has an ionic radius of 2.44 Å26 but different stereochemistry from ammonium cations, into MAPbI3 perovskites was not realized in our previous study. Aiming at this type of phase stabilization in 3D perovskites limits the discovery of many organic candidates because both the ionic size and stereochemistry should be considered.
4.1. Passivation of 3D perovskites by sulfonium cations
Bearing in mind that H2O, hydroxyl radicals, and/or hydroxide are responsible for the degradation of perovskites under humid conditions, it has been pointed out that an ammonium cation (RNH3+) with a potential hydrogen donor will be vulnerable to hydration and/or hydrogen extraction from the attack of these initiators, resulting in the degradation of the perovskites. In this context, our group recently investigated the effect of the protic (acidic) nature of ammonium cations on the humidity stability of additive-treated MAPbI3. Specifically, a new series of fully alkylated sulfonium cations ((CH3)(CH2)nS(CH3)2+, n = 1, 3, and 11)29 was successfully assembled into 3D MAPbI3 PSCs with the aim of improving the wet-fastness. Among these, BDMS (butyldimethyl sulfonium; (CH3)(CH2)3S(CH3)2+), was chosen as an analogue to the protic ammonium of BA, which has been widely employed in perovskites.19,51,63,65 Considering the negative effects of the increased number of guest cations on the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the composition ratio of (BDMS)0.02(MA)0.98PbI3 was used. The results obtained from the XPS and XRD analysis showed that BDMS was introduced onto the surface and/or grain boundaries of the 3D perovskites. The surface-modified 3D perovskites obtained using a small number of sulfonium cations almost conserved the PCE observed for pristine MAPbI3 (Fig. 3d), while humidity stability was significantly improved in the BDMS-modified MAPbI3.

Fig. 3c shows the experimental results on the properties of the BA- and BDMS-halides stored under 85% RH. Notably, unlike aprotic BDMS, which shows no water-uptake, the large water-uptake of protic BA was observed by quantitative NMR analysis. The hygroscopic nature of BA was completely reflected in the stability of the perovskite films as well as PSCs. The color of the BA-driven perovskites became a colorless hydrated phase (Fig. 3b) during the early stage of the degradation process. On the other hand, aprotic BDMS had a pronounced effect on the increase in the wet-fastness of perovskites (Fig. 3a), emphasizing the generic difference between the protic ammonium and aprotic sulfonium cations. It seems that the function of the butyl group, which is hydrophobic, was offset by the chemical environment near heteroatom. Considering that the grain boundaries and/or defects could act as a landing road for the fast permeation of water,6,36,75,82 the passivation effect of the butyl group in BA was easily counteracted by the protic nature attracting water molecules. Therefore, humidity stability is dependent on not only the hydrophobicity (e.g. alkyl groups, aromaticity, etc.), but also the protic nature near the heteroatom of the cations.
Apart from the chemical environment near the heteroatom, it is also considered that the geometry of the large cations at the surface of the inorganic layers affects the lattice energy. For example, either small or bulky cations, which do not fit into the troughs formed by the array of corner-sharing octahedra, can give rise to the facile deformation (decomposition) of perovskites.4 Regarding the results obtained for the structural features affecting humidity stability, DFT calculations on the surface-modified MAPbI3 showed that the bulky size of the sulfonium cations (vs. protic ammonium cations RNH3+) helps sterically hinder the access of water, giving an adsorption energy with water of −0.34 eV (cf. −0.58 eV for BA-treated perovskite surface) (Fig. 3e and f). Similarly, related research has shown that the surface-modified perovskites using bulky tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA) gave rise to a reduced adsorption energy of −0.43 eV when compared to that of pristine perovskites (−0.52 eV).9 Here, the steric effect was mostly responsible for the different values obtained for the adsorption energy. Due to the steric arrangement of large cations sitting between the 5-coordinated lead halides (Fig. 3e), the runway for water is the Pb(II) atoms. Thus, the energy of the hydrated perovskites will be determined by the free volume accessible, which in turn forms the Pb–O bonds near the guest cations. No hydrogen abstraction (e.g. acid–base reaction) was observed during the optimization of this system, further supporting the steric effect of the relatively large sulfonium cations (vs. BA) on the reduced adsorption energy. In addition, it is anticipated that the acidic nature of BA is prone to degrade upon attack of the possible initiators such as OH− (or ˙OH) given that the infiltration process of water results in hydrogen bonding between the protic BA and oxygen atom in water (Fig. 3g(upper) and h).
As a result, the advantages of bulky sulfonium versus protic ammonium cations regarding humidity stability of perovskites include: (i) aprotic nature, which does not permit hydrogen abstraction by unstable radical or basic initiators and (ii) bulkier atom size, which is not loosely, but rather tightly bound to the lead halides to help hinder the access of water. It should be noted that the hydrophobicity of protic ammonium cations may be less perturbed by the introduction of much longer alkyl chains or functional side groups. However, the power conversion efficiency of PSCs will be affected by insulating longer alkyl groups, although the appropriate chain length has not been suggested at this point. When engineering cations in HPs, the introduction of the protic feature is sometimes inevitable to give the materials stability, templating effect (especially for 2D materials), and/or modified electronic and optical properties.54,83–85 A previous theoretical study has investigated the relationship between chemical stability and hydrogen bonding by comparing MA- to protic sulfonium-driven lead halide perovskites.83 The less electronegative sulfur atom (vs. N) makes the attached protons loosely bound to the sulfonium cation, so that the interaction (subsequent electronic coupling) between protons and [PbI6] octahedra is increased. When compared to MAPbI3, the increased electronic coupling arising from the protic S+ cation was reflected in the chemical stability, with (CH3)3−xSHxPbI3 (x = 2 and 3) exhibiting a lower reaction and hull energy with the band gap corresponding to 3D MAPbI3 (cal. band gap of 1.73 eV for SH3PbI3). Nonetheless, bearing in mind that the hydrophobicity imparted by the cations can be overshadowed by their protic nature, studies on the diverse variation in their molecular structure will help find promising cations in view of both the device performance and stability.
Although our approach using BDMS to improve wet-fastness is applicable to the modification of 3D perovskites, other types of assembly methods (e.g. 2D, 3D/2D hybrids, etc.) can be expected as in ammonium-driven perovskites. In addition, having linked aforementioned advantages of sulfonium cations to low dimensional perovskites with structural rigidity, the successful synthesis of DJ phase 2D perovskites employing divalent sulfonium derivatives will give high tolerance against humidity. Furthermore, the strengthened structural rigidity of the DJ phase using divalent cations is considered to enhance the thermal stability, judging from the results showing the relationship between bonding strength and heat-fastness.57,81
4.2. Sulfonium-driven metal–halides frameworks
In an effort to extend the conventional organic library of perovskites to sulfonium-based lead halides, it is important to note the related synthetic aspects, electronic, and chemical properties of sulfonium cations (or sulfonium-based metal halides) affecting the integration of the final device.
Regarding the synthetic aspects of the materials, aprotic alkylated sulfonium halides can be generally prepared using a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2-type),86 while the protic ammonium halides are synthesized via an acid–base reaction. To increase the reaction yield of the target sulfonium salts, reaction parameters such as temperature, solvent, and the concentration of reactants can be controlled. In particular, solvents (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid) with high dielectric constant (ε) are preferred as they contribute to the solvation of the halides (stabilization of the sulfonium cation). However, solvents with high ε but nucleophilic properties can cause unwanted by-products, reducing the product yield. In addition, some sulfonium salts containing a Cl− counter ion is hygroscopic like their corresponding ammonium cations. Thus, anhydrous conditions are necessary during the reaction and purification to prevent the formation of sticky and decomposed products.
Although only a few examples have been reported regarding sulfonium-based lead26,87,88 (or tin89) halides, sulfonium salts can impart structural versatility in sulfonium-driven hybrids depending on the different metals and halides employed. As shown in Fig. 4, it seems that the sulfonium derivatives induce the different connectivity of lead-halides from the typical corner-sharing octahedra4,61 found in ammonium-driven perovskites.
 Fig. 4  The structural versatility of TMS(trimethyl sulfonium)-driven metal–halide hybrids. In a clockwise direction, 0D-(1,4-bbdms)3Pb3Br12 and its diffuse reflectance UV-Vis and PL spectra (a) (adapted with permission from ref. 87, Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society), 0D-((CH3)3S)2SnX6 and its corresponding diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra (b) (adapted with permission from ref. 89, Copyright 2018 Elsevier), 1D-(CH3)3Pbl3 and its corresponding calculated electronic band structure (c) (adapted with permission from ref. 26, Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society), 2D-((CH3)3S)4Pb3Br10 and its diffuse reflectance UV-Vis and PL spectra obtained at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm (d) (adapted with permission from ref. 87, Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society), and 3D-(CH3)3PbCl3 and its corresponding diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra with spectra based on 1D-(CH3)3SPbX3 (e) (adapted with permission from ref. 88, Copyright 2017 Elsevier). 
Furthermore, similar reaction conditions (e.g. relative ratio of reactants and solvents) produced different dimensions of the hybrids depending the halides used. To be specific, the reaction of TMS (trimethyl sulfonium) with PbI2 in a stoichiometric ratio yielded 1D TMSPbI3 (Fig. 4c),26 while 3D perovskite (TMSPbCI3; Fig. 4e),88 with connectivity of the vertex- and face-sharing octahedra (FSO), was produced when the size of the halide was reduced to chlorine (e.g. ionic radius of chloride = 1.81 Å4).
As shown in Fig. 4c, DFT calculations on 1D-TMSPbI3 showed a dispersive band structure along the 〈001〉 direction, reflecting the 1D network of [PbI6]2− with the other directions giving flat bands. Unlike hygroscopic MAPbI3, all the resultant TMSPbX3 materials were durable for several months in ambient air. On the other hand, Smith et al. reported that the layered 2D-(TMS)4Pb3Br10 (Fig. 4d),87 emitting a red/NIR around 700 nm, was produced by the precursor solution including lead bromide and TMS. The resulting material showed a characteristic broad and large Stokes-shifted emission as well as long lifetime and a linear dependence of its PL intensity on the laser power. Based on these experimental observations, they claim that this unusual PL was caused by radiative recombination of the self-trapped excitons90 (cf. free-excitonic luminescence showing a narrow Stokes shift) like the case of perovskite-based white LEDs. Consequently, the structural features of the [Pb3Br10]4− lattice (Fig. 4d), which is composed of FSO trimers connected to the bridging Br atoms, are responsible for the broadband emission with a large Stokes shift and luminescent color.
Similarly, in the case of using divalent cations instead of monovalent cations, the resulting dimensionality and connectivity of the metal halides were different between the sulfonium- and ammonium-driven lead halides. For example, 1,4-butanediammnonium (BDA) results in the formation of 1D-C4N2H14PbBr4 perovskites91 adopting edge-sharing octahedral chains of [PbBr42−]∞ with the surrounding C4N2H142+ cations. On the other hand, the reaction of the disulfonium analogue of BDA with PbBr2 produced 0D-(1,4-bbdms)3Pb3Br12 (Fig. 4a). The resulting bonding skeleton of the lead bromides was the isolated trimer of FSO-[Pb3Br126−], which is the building block of 2D-(TMS)4Pb3Br10, and gives rise to a broad red emission at 690 nm. Even though the final geometries were different depending on the types of cations, the resulting characteristic building block of sulfonium-driven lead halides shows the potential to function as light-emitters in LED applications.
As another example of TMS-driven organic–metal frameworks, the variation in the metal (e.g. Sn) instead of PbX2 yielded zero-dimensional ((CH3)3S)2SnX6 (Fig. 4b).89 According to Hirshfeld surface analysis, the protons of the methyl groups on TMS contribute to the H-bond with the halogens, but in a different way depending on the halide used (X = Cl, Br, and I). As in 3D-MAPbX3, by going from the larger iodine to smaller (more electronegative) chlorine, a much stronger interaction between the protons (from TMS) and halides (from SnX62−) was reflected in Raman spectra (above 400 cm−1) by the shifts of each mode to higher frequencies, inducing a blue-shift in the band gap (Fig. 4b). 0D-((CH3)3S)2SnI6, which shows theoretically non-flat dispersive conduction bands, was assembled into solid HTL in DSSCs adopting Z907,92 resulting in an efficiency of 5%. An EIS study (impedance spectroscopy) on the charge transport showed more efficient charge transport when compared to the frequently employed HTM of spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs. To date, a few sulfonium-driven metal hybrids have been reported and are mostly based on low-dimensions. When compared to 3D perovskites, the merit of low dimensionality in view of humidity stability will be significantly increased degree of freedom for cation engineering. The introduction of inactive (robust) large sulfonium cations against humidity will be helpful to protect the 2D sheets, 1D chains, or 0D of the metal–halides frameworks. More importantly, their manipulation should be studied without causing any deterioration in the device performance of 3D PSCs. Even though the application of sulfonium-driven organic–inorganic frameworks is difficult due to the lack of research results, this new type of organic–inorganic hybrid family based on the sulfonium cations will offer further opportunities to understand the unexplored optoelectric properties for their applications in diverse fields of research (LEDs, PSCs, etc.)
It is important to emphasize the polarity (or solubility) of sulfonium derivatives regarding integration into device. Simple processing based on solution chemistry involves several interactions among the precursors as well as the interactions between the preformed complex with the anti-solvent. First of all, the precursor mixture (or solid perovskites) should be soluble in conventional solvents (e.g. DMSO, DMF) for the formation of thin perovskite films.93 Unfortunately, the first sulfonium-based perovskites of TMSPbI326 were not dissolved in conventional solvent mixtures during their one-step processing to construct efficient PSCs.29 TMS may be more polar when compared to its corresponding ammonium cation, judging from the results that the increased ratio of DMSO (ε = 46.7) to DMF (ε = 36.7) dissolved TMS.29 The low solubility of the cations is not the only issue for the interactions among the precursors, but is interconnected with the morphology (quality) of the thin films, which consequently affects the neighboring interfaces and device performance. For example, in the case of introducing large sulfonium cations (BDMS) into 3D MAPbI3 perovskites, the surface morphology observed by SEM showed somewhat smaller grains, which is different from that of 3D perovskites. The higher polarity of the sulfonium cations affect the crystal growth of MAPbI3 by attracting the polar solvent (DMSO) from the colloid state,29 otherwise large grains will form by forming a PbI2⋯DMSO⋯MA complex.94 Although there has been an on-going debate on the identification of the smaller grains regarding 2D formation on the top of 3D perovskites,20,95 in-depth understanding of the morphology will play a critical role in improving the stability and device performance (e.g. recombination kinetics). In addition, modification of polar monovalent cations into their divalent form can increase the polarity, which requires further study regarding colloidal chemistry.96
5. Summary and outlook
Representative organic–inorganic halides hybrids (e.g. MAPbI3) have suffered from environmental factors such as light, humidity, oxygen, and high temperature. In this perspective, the intrinsic stability issues related to the protic A-site ammonium cation (in 3D-ABX3) was addressed under humid conditions. Despite of on-going investigations, the comprehensive review of recent developments pertaining to stability shows that the humidity-induced degradation process is associated with the synergetic action of both catalytic H2O and hydrogen abstractors (such as OH−, ˙OH, or accumulated charges on the grain boundaries), which consequently produces the irreversible volatile degraded products via the hydrated phase of perovskite. Progress in the strategies used to improve their humidity stability has been made by manipulating large organic cations due to their merits in view of their diverse assembly into perovskites (2D-DJ, 2D-RP, 3D/2D, passivation of surface/grain boundaries of 3D perovskites). The structural rigidity (chemical stability) can be reinforced by 2D-RP (or DJ) phase employing the large monovalent (or divalent) cations, considering that the crystal cohesion energy is affected by the interactions between the organic sheets and inorganic layers, organic sheets, and/or H-bonding. So far, some challenges regarding 2D phase showing promising humidity stability have remained to control the preferential alignment of inorganic slabs for efficient charge transport in PSCs. Furthermore, an increase in the number of inorganic slabs (for n >5), which is necessary to give high efficiency corresponding to 3D perovskites, is thermodynamically less stable.97 Thus, precise control of quasi-2D onto the film-state in an efficient manner will be promising in view of both the device performance and stability of PSCs.
Even though the long-term stability of perovskites has to be significantly improved for commercialization, many reports on the improvement of their stability have been mostly based on the use of ammonium cations (bulky- or protic-ammonium cations). Practical examples beyond ammonium cations are rare, which is in turn connected to the failure of structure-performance-stability studies. The surface (and/or grain boundaries) passivation of 3D perovskites by newly explored aprotic sulfonium (BDMS) (vs. protic BA) showed a pronounced effect on the wet-fastness by imparting not only a desirable stereochemistry on the surface, but also unperturbed hydrophobicity. Unfortunately, there have been no reports on the sulfonium-driven corner-sharing 2D phase of perovskites. Instead a few examples (using TMS) induced different dimensionalities (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) with good chemical stability. Considering that hybridized 3D perovskites (or surface passivation of 3D) improve humidity stability, it is anticipated that the same assembly principles will be realized as in the case of ammonium-driven perovskites. Nonetheless, to address the stability issue of the currently-available ammonium-based perovskites by exploring a new family of organic–inorganic hybrids based on sulfonium salts, interdisciplinary studies linking chemistry, theory, and device fabrication should be augmented with the aim of establishing the structure–performance–stability relationships as follows:
(i) Establishment of synthetic rules: most low-dimensional perovskites are synthesized after many trials and errors. Nonetheless, the dimensional flexibility of HPs offers diverse ways to improve the stability in a different manner (2D, 3D/2D, etc.). Furthermore, control over the dimensionality determines their best fit to a particular application (LEDs, PSCs, lasers, etc.). To date, sulfonium-based hybrids are limited to a few alkylated derivatives with the synthetic rule inducing different dimensionality remaining undiscovered. A significant advancement in their synthesis is necessary to expand the current library from ammonium- to sulfonium-based hybrids.
(ii) Thin film formation by solution processing: some sulfonium derivatives show much higher polarity (vs. ammonium salts), limiting crystal growth as a thin-film when using the typical molar concentrations in efficient solution processing. The successful transformation of sulfonium derivatives into hybrid materials in the film-state will open the door to understanding their diverse physical properties and stability depending on the type (single crystals vs. film-state) and orientation (alignment of metal–halides octahedra) of the materials. To explore such aspects, in-depth studies including the interactions between the precursors, behavior of the metal–halides clusters, and solvent effect on crystal growth should be significantly augmented with an aid of tuning the sulfonium derivatives.
(iii) Understanding the electronic, photophysical, and kinetic properties: there have been no reports on the use of sulfonium-driven perovskites as a light-harvester in PSCs. In addition, their emissive behavior has been reported in the absence of PLQY data. Studies on the detailed optoelectric properties are of great importance to understand these materials properties. The practical aspects for application, such as charge transport (e.g. at the 3D vertex- and face-sharing octahedra), manipulation of the alignment of inorganic metal–halides, and origin of the self-trapped excitons should be experimentally studied to gain a deeper insight into sulfonium-driven metal hybrids.
(iv) Unveiling the structural factors governing degradation: the difference in the degradation behavior is mainly associated with the materials properties. The surface treatment of perovskites using even a small number of large sulfonium cations can significantly affect the degradation behavior in a different manner (e.g. adsorption, infiltration). A systematic study on the stability depending on the functionality, stereochemistry, and protic nature under controlled humid conditions will contribute to unveiling the properties of underexplored sulfonium derivatives regarding their degradation behavior.
(v) Understanding the degradation behavior on a molecular level: it is sometimes hard to experimentally control the humidity-induced degradation initiators in a precise manner. Virtual modeling could be a good alternative to gain insight into understanding what takes place on an atomic scale.
Overall, a new family of sulfonium-driven metal hybrids with structural flexibility will open up a vast research arena in view of not only the device performance, but also stability, finally advancing the commercialization of perovskite-based devices.

	Sang Il Seok is currently a Distinguished Professor at the School of Energy and Chemical Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Korea. Before he joined UNIST in 2015, he served as the principle investigator of Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology and as a professor at the Department of Energy Science, Sungkyunkwan University. He obtained his BS and PhD degrees at Kyungpook National University and Seoul National University, Korea, respectively. His current researches focus on the preparation of functional inorganic–organic hybrid materials and their application to energy devices including perovskite solar cells. He won Korea Scientists award from Korean government, 2017 and Kyung-Ahm Prize by the Kyung-Ahm Education & Cultural Foundation, 2019 respectively.

Broader context
Long-term stability of halide perovskite-based devices has been a challenging issue to the commercialization, despite promising optoelectric properties. Material engineering of the perovskites can be the most straightforward way to improve humidity stability. However, although structural (dimension) flexibility is high, typically adopted cations have been limited to the ammonium cations, which have been known to irreversibly degrade by forming perovskite hydrates and/or gaseous products upon attack of water. Newly studied sulfonium-driven perovskites showed the unique geometries with enhanced humidity stability compared to typical MAPbI3 perovskites. The phase tuning of 3-dimensional perovskites into the lower dimension using large sulfonium cations can be a strategy to strengthen chemical and humidity stability. In this context, current perspective emphasizes the molecular aspects of perovskites, which is suggested by analyzing experimental and theoretical results on the degradation of perovskites under humid condition. Exploring new organic cations beyond typical ammoniums will open up the diverse research arena regarding their application to robust optoelectronics.


 	Fig. 1  A Schematic representation of the different dimensionalities of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (HPs) depending on the type of organic cations employed. The octahedra and purple spheres indicate metal halides and small organic cations such as MA or FA, respectively. The center image is a simple cubic lattice of HPs. The values reported in the parenthesis are the ionic radius (taken from ref. 4 and 26). The structural configuration of low-dimensional metal halide frameworks can be varied depending on the cations employed.
