    , Accepted 13th March 2017First published on 13th March 2017AbstractA systematic methodology is developed to construct the angular-shaped β-form naphthodithiophene (β-aNDT) core with regiospecific substitution of two alkyl groups at its 4,9- or 5,10-positions via the base-induced double 6π-cyclization of dithienyldieneyne precursors, leading to the two isomeric 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT monomers. It is found that a more curved geometry of the β-aNDT units intrinsically increases the solubility and thus the solution-processability of the resultant polymers. Therefore, β-aNDT units are ideal for polymerization with an acceptor-containing monomer without the need for any solubilizing aliphatic side chains, which are considered the insulating portion that jeopardizes charge transport. Based on this consideration, the 4,9- and 5,10-dialkylated β-aNDT monomers are polymerized with the non-alkylated DTFBT acceptor to afford two P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT copolymers for head-to-head comparison of the 4,9-inner/5,10-outer isomeric alkylation effect. It is found that 4,9-β-aNDT adopts a twisted conjugated structure due to the intramolecular steric repulsion between the inner branched side chains and the β-hydrogens on the thiophene rings. The slightly twisted 4,9-β-aNDT moiety allows P4,9-βNDTDTFBT to have higher solubility upon polymerization and thus a higher molecular weight, which eventually induces a higher ordered packing structure in the thin film compared to P5,10-βNDTDTFBT. As a result, P4,9-βNDTDTFBT exhibits a higher OFET mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the P4,9-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM-based solar cell device also achieves a higher PCE of 7.23%, which is even better than the corresponding P4,9-αNDTDTFBT-based device.
Introduction
Conjugated donor–acceptor copolymers have been widely used in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).1–20 Considerable research has been directed to the development of new donor building blocks for the construction of donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers.21–30 The acenedithiophenes (AcDT) have been demonstrated as superior building blocks due to their rigid and coplanar architectures for efficient charge transport and selective C2-functionalization of the terminal thiophenes for π-extension. Among the members in the AcDT family, the benzodithiophene (BDT)-based7,29,31–35 and also the anthradithiophene(ADT)-based36–45 D–A copolymers have successfully achieved high performances in OPV and OFET applications, respectively. Very recently, tetracyclic naphthodithiophenes (NDTs)46–54 have also emerged as promising materials but with much less research exploration. “Zigzag” angular-shaped NDT (aNDT) units in the anti-orientation have particularly received appreciable attention, considering that the copolymer incorporated in the aNDT units packs into higher ordered structures to achieve higher OFET mobilities in comparison with polymers employing linear-fused NDT (lNDT) units.52,53 The sulfur atoms can be attached on the α- or β-positions of the central naphthalene moiety in aNDTs, yielding two regioisomers denoted as α-aNDT and β-aNDT, respectively (Scheme 1). It is necessary to introduce aliphatic side chains to bare aNDT moieties as solubilizing groups toward polymer synthesis. To this end, we develop a systematic strategy to implant two alkyl groups at the 4,9- or 5,10-positions of α-aNDT and β-aNDT units, leading to the formation of four isomeric 4,9- and 5,10-dialkylated α-aNDT structures as well as 4,9- and 5,10-dialkylated β-aNDTs. The two isomeric 4,9-α-aNDT and 4,9-β-aNDT monomers are copolymerized with dithienylnaphthobisthiadiazole (DTNT) monomer to form PαNDTDTNT and PβNDTDTNT, (Fig. 1) to systematically investigate the α- and β- main-chain isomeric effect.51

We found that the geometry of the α-aNDT moiety results in a more linear polymeric backbone than the β-aNDT counterpart. The less curved conjugated main chain facilitates stronger intermolecular π–π interactions compared to the PβNDTDTNT counterpart. As a result, the PαNDTDTNT-based device delivered a higher OFET mobility and superior solar-cell efficiency of 8.01% that outperformed the PβNDTDTNT-based device with a moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.6%.51 On the other hand, the 4,9-α-aNDT monomer was also copolymerized with the dioctyldithienyldifluorobenzothiadiazole (DTFBT) monomer to form the corresponding PαNDTDTFBT, which also exhibited a decent efficiency of 6.86% (Fig. 1).50
It is documented that the incorporation of bulky aliphatic side chains close to the acceptor subunit might sterically hinder the photo-induced electron transfer from the D–A copolymer to fullerene materials.57,58 In view of the fact that the geometry of β-aNDT gives rise to a more curved conjugated main chain and thus less closely packed structure, the β-aNDT-based copolymers possess much better solubility compared to the corresponding α-aNDT-based copolymers. We envision that the molecular properties and device performance of β-aNDT-based D–A copolymers could be further modulated and improved by cutting off the insulating aliphatic side chains installed near the acceptor units without largely affecting the polymer solubility. Furthermore, the 5,10-dialkyl β-aNDT unit with two alkyl groups at the outer 5,10-positions has never been incorporated into D–A copolymers. The position of the aliphatic side chains might dramatically influence the solubility, crystallization, molecular packing and thus charge transportation of the polymers, resulting in variations in device performance.57–64 It is therefore of great interest to head-to-head compare the inner (4,9-dialkyl) and outer (5,10-dialkyl) side-chain isomeric effect of the β-aNDT motifs on the resulting D–A copolymer properties. In this research, two 4,9-di(2-octyldodecyl) β-aNDT and 5,10-di(2-octyldodecyl) β-aNDT monomers were synthesized and polymerized with a dithienyl-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTFBT) monomer, which does not contain any aliphatic side-chain groups on the thienyl units next to the central FBT acceptor unit, affording two new copolymers P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT with adequate solution-processability (Fig. 1). The molecular properties, device performance and isomeric effect51–53,55,56 of the new polymers are discussed.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes for the Br-4,9-β-aNDT and Br-5,10-β-aNDT monomers are illustrated in Scheme 1. Nucleophilic addition of (3-octyltridecylidyne)lithium to thiophene-3-carboaldehyde (4), followed by pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) oxidation yielded compound 5. Dimerization of 2-bromothiophene-3-carboaldehyde 1 and 5 by McMurry condensation formed the olefinic products 2 and 6, respectively, with the E-form as the major olefinic configuration. The alkynylation of 2 with 9-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)nonadecane by the Sonogashira coupling reaction afforded the dialkynylated compound 3. The desired isomeric 4,9-β-aNDT as well as 5,10-β-aNDT were successfully obtained by the 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU)-induced intramolecular tandem 6π-cyclization of 3 and 6. Double bromination of 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT was selectively carried out at the 2,7-positions using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to yield Br-4,9-β-aNDT and Br-5,10-β-aNDT. The two brominated monomers were copolymerized with the Sn-DTFBT monomer by Stille coupling to afford P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT, respectively. The molecular weight (Mn) was determined to be 24.5 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.9 for P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and 16.1 kDa with a PDI of 1.6 for P5,10-βNDTDTFBT by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement. Even though the two polymers have only two aliphatic side chains on the β-aNDT units, P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT can be completely dissolved in hot dichlorobenzene solution (5 mg mL−1) at 80 °C and 100 °C, respectively, which indicates that P4,9-βNDTDTFBT has better solubility than P5,10-βNDTDTFBT.
Thermal properties

P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT did not show thermal transition peaks in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements; from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the polymers exhibit high decomposition temperatures (Td) of 468 and 450 °C, respectively (Fig. 2).

Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical properties of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 3) and their characteristics are shown in Table 1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the small molecules 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT were estimated to be −5.72 and −5.66 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels calculated by HOMO + optical bandgap (Eoptg) were determined to be −2.10 and −2.14 eV for 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT, respectively. The two polymers exhibited stable and reversible electrochemical characteristics during the oxidative and reductive scans. The HOMO levels of P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT are approximately located at −5.55 eV and −5.49 eV, respectively. Moreover, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are estimated to be −3.70 eV for P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and −3.61 eV for P5,10-βNDTDTFBT, which are higher than the LUMO level of PC71BM (−3.8 eV) for favorable electron transfer. The estimated electronic band gap of P4,9-βNDTDTFBT (1.85 eV) is slightly lower than that of P5,10-βNDTDTFBT (1.88 eV).

Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorbance spectra of 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT measured in orthodichlorobenzene (o-DCB) are illustrated in Fig. 4. Although 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT have identical conjugated backbones, the difference in the side-chain substitution positions makes the profile of the absorption spectra different. 5,10-β-aNDT with the outer alkylation essentially shows higher extinction coefficient red-shifted bands at around 300 to 350 nm and thus a smaller optical bandgap compared to 4,9-β-aNDT with inner alkylation. The normalized absorption spectra of the two polymers show two distinct bands (Fig. 5). Similar to the smaller molecules, P5,10-βNDTDTFBT exhibits a slightly smaller optical band gap of 1.74 eV than P4,9-βNDTDTFBT with 1.76 eV estimated from the onset of the thin film absorption spectra. The temperature-dependent absorption spectra were measured at room temperature (rt), 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, and 140 °C (Fig. 6). The absorbance of the two polymers gradually blue-shifted as the temperature increased, suggesting that the polymeric interchain interactions occurring at room temperature are weakened at high temperatures as a result of increased thermal motion around the polymer main chains.65 From rt to 140 °C, the λmax of P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT is blue-shifted by 12 and 43 nm, respectively, which implies that P5,10-βNDTDTFBT might have stronger intermolecular interactions in solution (Table 2).

Theoretical calculations
In order to gain insight into the inner/outer side-chain isomeric effects on the β-aNDT main-chain structure, geometry optimization of the 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT structures was performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. As shown in Fig. 7(a), unlike 5,10-β-aNDT, which exhibits a coplanar conjugated structure, 4,9-β-aNDT shows a twisted structure with a dihedral angle of 12.3° between the two benzothiophene subunits. This distorted structure of 4,9-β-aNDT clearly is a result of the steric repulsion between the hydrogens on the second carbon of the branched alkyl chains and the β-hydrogens on the thiophene units. Compared to its 5,10-β-aNDT counterpart, the distorted structure of the 4,9-β-aNDT units in the polymer might slightly shorten the effective conjugation length and weaken the intermolecular interactions. This structural disparity could rationally explain the phenomena discussed previously: (1) 5,10-β-aNDT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT show slightly smaller optical bandgaps and stronger intermolecular interactions than the corresponding 4,9-β-aNDT and P4,9-βNDTDTFBT; (2) P4,9-βNDTDTFBT intrinsically has much higher solubility than P5,10-βNDTDTFBT due to its less tendency for aggregation, leading to a much higher molecular weight. (3) 4,9-β-aNDT and P4,9-βNDTDTFBT have slightly lower-lying HOMO energy levels.

Transistor characterization
OFET devices using the bottom-gate/bottom-contact configuration with evaporated gold source/drain electrodes were fabricated to evaluate the mobilities of the polymers. The surfaces of SiO2 as the gate dielectric were modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The polymer films prepared by spin-coating from chlorobenzene (CB) solutions were subsequently annealed at 200 °C. All the output and transfer plots of the devices show typical p-type OFET characteristics (Fig. 8). The hole mobilities listed in Table 3 with on/off ratios were calculated from the transfer characteristics of the devices in the saturation regime. The P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT devices without thermal annealing exhibit hole mobilities of 0.025 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 6.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. After thermal annealing at 200 °C, the mobilities dramatically improve to 0.18 cm2 V−1 S−1 for P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and 0.058 cm2 V−1 S−1 for P5,10-βNDTDTFBT. The higher mobility of P4,9-βNDTDTFBT might be ascribed to its much higher molecular weight.

Photovoltaic characteristics
Bulk heterojunction devices with an inverted architecture ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were thus fabricated. The current density–voltage characteristics and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices under simulated 100 mW cm−2 at AM1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 9 and the device parameters are shown in Table 4. The device using the P4,9-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM (1:1 wt%) blend with 5 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE) as an additive delivered a PCE of 7.01% with a Voc of 0.88 V, moderate Jsc of −11.57 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.88%. To make a consistent comparison, the P5,10-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM based device using identical fabrication conditions (1:1 wt% with 5 vol% DPE) showed a PCE of 5.08%, with a Jsc of −11.26 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V, and FF of 62.63%. The PCE of both P4,9-βNDTDTFBT- and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT-based devices can be further improved to 7.23% and 5.56%, respectively (Table 4). The higher molecular weight of P4,9-βNDTDTFBT in comparison with P5,10-βNDTDTFBT might be the major reason for its higher efficiency. It should be emphasized that by molecular engineering of the polymer structure, the β-NDT-based P4,9-βNDTDTFBT can exhibit a better performance than the corresponding α-NDT-based P4,9-αNDTDTFBT copolymer (Fig. 1).50

X-ray diffraction measurements
2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (2D-GIWAXRD) was conducted to investigate the thin film morphologies of the neat polymers and polymer/PC71BM blends (Fig. 10). Compared to P5,10-βNDTDTFBT, P4,9-βNDTDTFBT exhibits stronger high-order lamellar stacking peaks in the out-of-plane direction and a π-stacking peak at qxy = 1.83 Å−1 in the in-plane direction corresponding to the π-stacking (edge-on) with a distance of ca. 3.43 Å (Fig. 10a and b), which is believed to facilitate the charge transport along the OFET transport channel. The higher ordering of P4,9-βNDTDTFBT relative to P5,10-βNDTDTFBT is likely to be associated with its better solubility, which allows more time for the polymer to pack during solvent evaporation from the film. Consequently, P4,9-βNDTDTFBT has a hole mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 S−1, which is 3-fold higher than that of P5,10-βNDTDTFBT with 0.058 cm2 V−1 S−1. Compared to P5,10-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM (1:1 wt%), the P4,9-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM thin film shows a more pronounced out-of-plane diffraction peak at qz = 1.71 Å−1, corresponding to the π-stacking with a distance of ca. 3.67 Å (Fig. 10c), suggesting that P4,9-βNDTDTFBT tends to adopt a face-on orientation in the blend, which is beneficial for vertical charge transport in the active layer. Interestingly, the π-stacking of P4,9-βNDTDTFBT changes from the edge-on to face-on orientation after the incorporation of PC71BM, which is an indication of stronger association with PC71BM, thereby resulting in the higher filling factor of the P4,9-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM-based device.

Conclusions
Compared to the α-aNDT unit, studies have shown that the molecular geometry of the β-aNDT building block, which leads to a more curved backbone of β-aNDT-based polymers, is not ideal for the formation of ordered structures in the solid state. Nevertheless, such a structural configuration also simultaneously imparts much better solubility to β-aNDT-based polymers. On the basis of this characteristic, we rationalize that the charge transport of β-aNDT-based polymers can be improved by reducing the content of insulating aliphatic groups near the acceptor units without encountering poor solution-processability. In addition, the inner or outer dialkylation of β-aNDT might play an important role in determining the molecular properties and organic electronic applications, which are worthy of investigation. To this end, we have successfully synthesized two regiospecific 4,9-di(2-octyldodecyl) β-aNDT and 5,10-di(2-octyldodecyl)-β-aNDT isomeric monomers, which were further copolymerized with a non-alkylated DTFBT monomer to afford the two polymers P4,9-βNDTDTFBT and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT with adequate solution-processability. Although the 4,9-β-aNDT and 5,10-β-aNDT molecules have identical conjugated backbones, theoretical calculation suggests that 4,9-β-aNDT actually forms a twisted structure due to the steric congestion between the inner alkyl groups and the β-hydrogens on the fused thiophene units, whereas the 5,10-β-aNDT molecule with outer alkylation still maintains a planar structure. The twisted 4,9-β-aNDT units in P4,9-βNDTDTFBT might reduce the intermolecular interactions. Therefore, P4,9-βNDTDTFBT possesses much higher solubility than P5,10-βNDTDTFBT, thus yielding a higher molecular weight during polymerization. Due to the higher ordered molecular packing in the solid state associated with its higher Mn, P4,9-βNDTDTFBT shows a higher OFET hole mobility of 0.18 cm2 V−1 S−1 than P5,10-βNDTDTFBT with 0.058 cm2 V−1 S−1. Furthermore, the P4,9-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM-based device exhibits an efficiency of 7.23% which is also superior to the P5,10-βNDTDTFBT:PC71BM-based device, thus indicating that inner/outer isomeric side-chain variation of β-NDT indeed can further modulate the microscopic properties and macroscopic performance of the polymers. Notably, by cutting off the aliphatic side chains in the polymer, the β-NDT-based P4,9-βNDTDTFBT can ultimately exhibit an even better performance than the corresponding α-NDT-based PαNDTDTFBT copolymer.50 This research demonstrates that the dialkyl β-NDT units can function as promising building blocks for the fabrication of semiconductor polymers as long as proper molecular engineering can be smartly implemented. Further exploration of β-NDT-based copolymers is still ongoing in our laboratory.

Instrumentation

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer and obtained in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) with TMS as the internal reference unless otherwise stated, and chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded on a PerkinElmer Pyris under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was measured on a TA Q200 Instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Absorption spectra were obtained on an HP8453 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a CH instruments electrochemical analyzer. A carbon glass was used as the working electrode, Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ electrode (0.01 M AgNO3, 0.1 M TBAP in acetonitrile) was used as the reference electrode in a solution of dichloromethane with 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosophate) at 80 mV s−1. CV curves were calibrated using ferrocence as the standard, and the E1/2 of ferrocence was 0.09 V, which was calculated as the average of the two peak maxima Epa and Epc. The HOMO energy levels were obtained from the equation HOMO = −(Eonsetox − E1/2(ferrocene) + 4.8) eV and the LUMO energy levels were obtained from the equation LUMO = −(Eonsetred − E1/2(ferrocene) + 4.8) eV.

Fabrication and characterization of OFET devices
300 nm thick SiO2 was deposited on n-doped silicon wafers (Ci = 11 nF cm−2). The substrates were rinsed with sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (30% solution in water) (3:1, volume ratio) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 15 min of sonication in pure water. The substrates were heated on a hot plate in a glovebox at 150 °C to remove water, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 30 min. The SiO2 wafers were immersed in an octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS):toluene solution (1:100, volume ratio) for 3 h. The surface of the ODTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates was washed with acetone and heated for 1 h at 100 °C. Thin films (40–60 nm in thickness) of the polymers were deposited on ODTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating (1000 rpm) their hot CHCl3 solutions (10 mg mL−1). Thermal annealing was then conducted at 200 °C for 10 min. A gold source and drain contacts (40 nm in thickness) were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the polymer layer to complete the bottom-gate/top-contact OFET devices. Electrical measurements of all OFET devices were carried out at room temperature in air on a 4156C instrument (Agilent Technologies). The field-effect mobility was calculated at saturation using the equation Ids = (μWCi/2L)(Vg − Vt)2, where Ids is the drain–source current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W is the channel width (1 mm), L is the channel length (100 μm), Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, Vg is the gate voltage, and Vt is the threshold voltage.
Fabrication and characterization of OPV devices
For the inverted architectures, a ZnO precursor solution was spin coated onto ITO-coated glass and followed by thermal annealing at 170 °C in air for 15 min to crystallize the film (thickness = ca. 50 nm). The detailed processing parameters (polymer/ODCB concentration; spin coating speed) are as follows: P4,9-βNDTDTFBT/PC71BM (15 mg mL−1; 1200 rpm) and P5,10-βNDTDTFBT/PC71BM (15 mg mL−1; 1200 rpm). An MoO3 layer (thickness = ca. 7 nm) and silver top anode (thickness = ca. 150 nm) were then thermally evaporated through a shadow mask under high vacuum (<1 × 10−6 Torr) to complete the inverted devices. Each device was constituted of 4 pixels defined by an active area of 0.04 cm2. Finally, the J–V curves were measured in air under an AM 1.5 G spectrum from a solar simulator.
