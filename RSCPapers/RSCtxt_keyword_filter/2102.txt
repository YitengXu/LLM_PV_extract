    , Accepted 1st February 2020First published on 19th February 2020AbstractThe effect of a graphene oxide (GO) intermediate layer on the performance of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells was studied. The formation of dielectric MoSe2, which can be induced by a reaction between CZTSSe and Mo, was successfully suppressed. The GO layer prevented the decomposition of CZTSSe along with the formation of binary chalcogenides. Furthermore, the interference effect generated between the incident light and the light reflected by Mo was effectively alleviated, thereby reducing photon loss to effectively absorb light. The incorporation of the GO layer resulted in a stronger electric field in the absorber, as determined by the transfer matrix method, and accordingly, a higher absorption spectrum was observed in absorption measurements. Consequently, the series resistance was reduced because MoSe2 formation was inhibited, and a significant improvement in the Jsc value was confirmed via the mitigation of the interference effect and an improved series resistance. The CZTSSe solar cell exhibited a notable power conversion efficiency of 11.2%, which represented an improvement over a conventional reference cell that was fabricated with a GO layer.
1. Introduction
Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe)-based inorganic solar cells have been evaluated as potential candidates for future renewable energy supply because CZTSSe is composed of earth-abundant nontoxic elements and has a high absorption coefficient (≈104 cm−1) and a direct band-gap energy (0.9–1.55 eV) that can be tuned by varying the S/Se ratio.1–5 The remarkable record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CZTSSe solar cells reached 12.6% in 2014 and has since remained stagnant, unlike its well-developed inorganic solar cell counterparts (CIGS: 22.3%, CdTe: 21.0%).6,7 In this regard, efforts have been expended to surpass the highest PCE of CZTS-based solar cells by overcoming issues of poor interfacial control, and the formation of defect complexes in the CZTSSe absorber layer.8–14
The study of the CZTSSe/Mo interface is a prerequisite for solving the above-mentioned problems. At high temperatures above 500 °C, CZTSSe decomposition occurs at the interface via a reaction with sulfur and selenium, which contributes to the formation of binary chalcogenides. In addition, the formation of a MoSe2 layer, a byproduct of a reaction with molybdenum (Mo), deteriorates the electrical contact and increases the series resistance. To solve the problems caused by these interfacial reactions, research studies have been conducted on the intermediate layer using various materials, such as TiB2, TiN, SixNy, ZnO, and Ag, pre-alloying temporary barriers and carbon.15–20 An appropriate intermediate layer can be used to mitigate the formation of binary chalcogenides from decomposition and suppress the formation of thick MoSe2 layers that affect the electrical contact.21,22 In addition, proper embedding of an intermediate layer could be expected to mitigate the interference effect. Inorganic solar cells, such as CZTSSe, normally suffer from the loss of charge carriers because of recombination at defect sites in bulk CZTSSe and at interfacial recombination sites, band-gap fluctuations, and short diffusion lengths.9,10,23–28 One of the reasons for the poor PCE of CZTSSe solar cells is photon loss that is induced by the formation of a dead zone resulting from the interference between the incident light and the reflected light from the back contact.29 Mo is currently considered to be a representative back contact for inorganic solar cells because of its high conductivity. However, the high reflectance of a Mo back contact induces the reflection of a considerable fraction of the incident light, resulting in the interference of the reflected light with the incident light that passes through the absorber layer.29–34 The light interference in this dead zone decreases the concentration of photo-generated carriers, thereby lowering the PCE of the solar cell.
Here, we propose the use of a graphene oxide (GO) film as an intermediate layer for a CZTSSe solar cell and study the effect of the GO film on the performance of CZTSSe solar cells. GO is a suitable material for overcoming the detrimental interfacial issues that occur in CZTSSe solar cells. A GO film of an appropriate thickness is transparent and does not lower the sheet resistivity of the back contact. Moreover, GO has a suitable Φ for both the CZTSSe absorber layer and the Mo back contact layer and can thereby function as a hole transfer layer.35–38 Embedding a GO layer at the interface could also prevent the formation of interfacial secondary layers, such as MoSe2. Crystallographic and morphological studies are performed to determine the effect of GO on secondary phases and layers at the interface. The internal optical electric field distribution in the CZTSSe layer is calculated for a device with and without a GO layer. A comparative analysis of the complex refractive index distributions is performed for solar cells with and without a GO layer using spectroscopic ellipsometry. To confirm that GO acts as a hole transfer layer, a band-gap energy diagram is constructed by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to measure Φ and the valence band offset for each layer. Our results show that a GO layer can significantly boost the PCE of CZTSSe solar cells with improved electrical contact and light harvesting.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of a graphene oxide film
A GO layer was prepared by spin coating using GO aqueous solution on the Mo substrate. The GO aqueous solution was prepared via Hummers' method using KMnO4, NaNO3, and H2SO4, which is the most common method used to synthesize. GO aqueous solution (0.44 mL) was added dropwise onto the Mo substrate using a micropipette. The GO layer was formed on the Mo substrate by spin coating using an acceleration of 200 rpm, deposition spin rate of 2000 rpm, and deposition time of 40 s. Deposition cycles of 3, 7, and 11 were conducted. The sample was dried on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 s in air after each deposition cycle. The sample was cooled to room temperature naturally before deposition of the absorber layer.
2.2 CZTSSe preparation for solar cell fabrication
To prepare the CZTSSe absorber layer, precursor Zn, Sn, and Cu films were initially sequentially deposited on the GO-coated Mo substrate using a DC sputter coater at 1.06 Pa with argon (Ar) gas under a base pressure of 1.33 × 10−4 Pa. CZTSSe thin films were then obtained from the precursor films by two-step annealing using a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) system. First, precursor films were annealed at 300 °C for 60 min using a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a conventional two-zone furnace under an Ar atmosphere. The alloyed precursor films were then further annealed at 520 °C for 10 min with a heating rate of 52 °C min−1 using an RTA system by placing the alloyed precursor film in a graphite box with Se (1.98 g) and sulfur (0.02 g). The annealed film was naturally cooled to room temperature. The thickness of the annealed CZTSSe film was ∼1.5 μm.
2.3 CZTSSe solar cell fabrication
CZTSSe solar cell fabrication was completed by deposition of cadmium sulfide (CdS), intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO)/aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), and aluminum (Al) layers. CdS was grown via chemical bath deposition. A cadmium sulfate aqueous solution (0.003 M), thiourea aqueous solution (0.199 M), and ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution (2.567 M) were prepared for CdS deposition along with a potassium cyanide (KCN) aqueous solution (0.199 M) to remove surface Cu-based secondary phases. The CZTSSe film was etched for 1 min using the KCN aqueous solution and then rinsed with deionized water for 1 min prior to CdS deposition. The film was immersed in a mixture of the cadmium sulfate aqueous solution, thiourea aqueous solution, and ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution placed in a water circulating bath at 60 °C with a flow rate of 3.78 L h−1. The deposition was conducted for 14 min and then the film was cleaned by ultrasonication in deionized water for 1 min. The thickness of the CdS buffer layer was 50 nm. The i-ZnO (∼80 nm thick) and AZO (∼600 nm thick) layers were deposited as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering and then the Al top contact grid was formed on the top of the TCO layers using a custom-designed patterned mask and DC sputter coater. All of the solar cells were defined by mechanical scribing of six cells with an active area of 0.31 cm2 on a substrate with a size of 2.5 × 2.5 cm.
2.4 Characterization
The surface and cross-sectional microstructures of GO/Mo films were observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; JSM-6701F, JEOL, USA). Elemental mapping analysis was performed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS; JSM-6701F, JEOL) attachment on the FE-SEM to detect the GO film on the Mo/glass substrate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Multilab 2000, Thermo VG Scientific, UK) with a monochromatic Mg-Kα (1253.6 eV) radiation source was used to analyze the binding energy of GO films. The crystal structure and quality of the CZTSSe films were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements that were performed on a diffractometer (X'pert PRO, Philips, the Netherlands) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Micro-Raman spectroscopy (Reflex UV Raman microscope, Renishaw, UK) was conducted with excitation wavelengths of 325, 515, and 785 nm and a resolution of 1 cm−1, and He–Ne laser operating at a power of 15 mW in the range of 100–600 cm−1. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of CZTSSe solar cells were measured using a Xe light source-based solar simulator (Sol3A, Oriel, USA) under standard conditions (AM 1.5G radiation, 1000 W m−2, 25 °C). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of solar cells in the wavelength range from 300 to 1300 nm was acquired using an incident photon PCE measurement unit (Bunkou keiki Co. Ltd, CEP-25BX, Japan). The sheet resistivity of the Mo back contact layer was determined after exfoliating a fully fabricated cell using four-point probe resistivity measurements (Guardian Manufacturing Inc., SRM-232, USA). The cross-sectional microstructure of the CZTSSe solar cell and MoSe2 layer was observed by FE-SEM and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; Philips, Tecnai F20) with a point resolution of 0.19 nm. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, Thermo VG Scientific, Sigma Prove, USA) was used to determine the energy-band alignment profile of the GO, Mo, and CZTSSe layers. UPS measurements were carried out using a base pressure below 10−9 Torr with a He I discharge lamp (hν = 21.22 eV) as the UV source. Complex indexes of refraction were obtained with a spectroscopic ellipsometer (JY Horiba, ex situ UVISEL VIS, Japan). Distributions of the normalized modulus squared of the optical electric field were determined by analysis of ellipsometry data using the transfer matrix method. The absorption spectra of absorber layers were obtained using a UV-VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 1050, USA).
3. Results and discussion
GO films were deposited on Mo back contacts using an aqueous GO solution that was synthesized by the conventional Hummers method.39 The GO films were fabricated by spin coating at different deposition cycle times of 3, 7, and 11 (to produce film thicknesses of 25, 45, and 65 nm, respectively) and are denoted as G1, G2, and G3, respectively. The film thicknesses of the GO films that were formed using with different deposition cycles can be found in Fig. S1.† The microstructures of a Mo back contact covered with a GO film and a Mo back contact for which the half of the GO film was exfoliated are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. A uniform GO film was formed on the Mo substrate. Raman spectroscopy and XRD analyses were used to unequivocally confirm the formation of a GO layer on the Mo back contact, and the results are presented in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. The Raman spectrum exhibited peaks at 1351 (D band) and 1600 cm−1 (G band), which was consistent with the presence of GO, and the XRD pattern exhibited a peak at 11.0° that corresponded to GO.40–42 In the EDS profile, oxygen and carbon including Mo were clearly detected from the GO/Mo surface, which is confirmed in Fig. S2.†

An XPS analysis was performed to investigate the structure of the chemical bonding in the GO films, and the results are presented in Fig. 2. The spectra show the chemical bonding states of carbon and oxygen in the GO films that were fabricated using different deposition cycles. In the C 1s spectra (Fig. 2a–c), peaks at binding energies that are consistent with C–C single bonds and oxygen functional groups, such as C–O single bonds, carbonyls (CO), and carboxylate (O–CO), were observed for all of the GO films.43,44 The peak intensities exhibited the same trend for all of the three GO films, where the highest peak intensity was observed for the C–C bonds, and the peak positions shifted slightly depending on the deposition cycle. The O 1s spectra that are presented in Fig. 2d–f show that oxygen functional groups, including quinone, were present in the GO films.45 The intensity of the carboxyl (OC–OH) peak decreased with the deposition cycle, whereas that the peak intensity for the C–O bonds increased. A peak consistent with quinone was only detected for G1. The strongest carbonyl peak was observed for G2. The peaks in the O 1s spectra were detected at slightly different positions for the three GO films.

As detailed in the Experimental section, CZTSSe synthesis involves a two-step annealing process. Pre-annealing was conducted to facilitate CZTSSe crystallization via the formation of binary phases, followed by heat treatment to fully crystallize the CZTSSe. A crystallographic analysis using XRD and Raman measurements was performed for the annealing steps, as shown in Fig. 3a, to examine the phase change in the absence or presence of GO. Temperature steps (T1, T2 and T3) were used to confirm the XRD and Raman spectra (see Fig. 3). The Raman spectra were acquired from different excitation light sources (325, 515 and 785), and the results from T1 can be found in Fig. S3.† Similar phase formations were observed in T1 and T2, irrespective of the absence or presence of GO. For T1, the CuSn (ICDD 00-047-1575) and CuZn (ICDD 00-002-1231)-based binary compounds, which were supposed to be induced during pre-annealing, were mainly identified in the XRD results.46,47 For T2, the CZTSSe phases had already formed completely, even though the maximum annealing temperature was reached in a short time (150 s). In addition to Cu2SnS3, Cu2SnSe3 and binary chalcogenides, such as ZnSe (JCPDS 37-1463), ZnS (ICSD 042833), SnSe2 (JCPDS 23-0602), Cu2S (JCPDS 84-0206), and CuS (JCPDS 65-3929), were also been found.48–56 In T3, several binary phases were found with fully formed CZTSSe phases.50,51,57 Based on the phases generated in T1 and T2 and considering the reactions that have been reported in the literature on the growth process that can occur in ternary and binary systems, the reaction pathway for phase formation in this study in which the two-step annealing was applied can be understood as follows:21,58–63 4/3Cu3Sn + Se2(g) → 2Cu2Se + 4/3Sn(1)2/3Cu6Sn5 + Se2(g) → 2Cu2Se + 10/3SnCu5Zn8 + Se → 2Cu2Se + 2ZnSe4Cu + S2(g) → 2Cu2S2Sn + S2(g) → 2SnSSnS + Se → SnSe2 + SnSe2SnSe + Se2(g) → 2SnSe2 2Cu2S(e) + 2SnS(e)(2) + S(e)2(g) → 2Cu2SnS(e)3(2) Cu2SnS(e)3 + ZnS(e) → Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4(3)Cu2S + SnSe2 + ZnSe → Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4

Eqn (1) and (2) represent the formation of binary and ternary chalcogenides, after which CZTSSe is synthesized through a second process (eqn (3)). However, during annealing at high temperature, sulfur and selenium decompose the CZTSSe phase via the following reaction with Mo as follows:21 2Cu2ZnSnS(e)4 + Mo → 2Cu2S(e) + 2ZnS(e) + 2SnS(e) + MoS(e)2.(4)
Since sulfur and selenium react deeply inside the thin film, the following reactions (eqn (5)–(7)) have been reported to occur in sequence:21 SnS + S(→Sn2S2) → SnS2(5) Cu2S + SnS2 → Cu2SnS3/Cu4SnS4/Cu2Sn4S9(6) Cu2SnS3 + ZnS → Cu2ZnSnS4.(7)
In eqn (7), Cu2SnS3 and ZnS cannot be synthesized by CZTS because there is no driving force and remain at the bottom of the CZTS film.21 The growth of CZTSSe by embedding GO as an intermediate layer appears to be able to change the phase decomposition process. By comparing the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of the CZTSSe thin film with and without GO at T3, it was unequivocally confirmed that the binary chalcogenides (SnSe2 and ZnSe) that appeared in the film without GO clearly disappeared in the film with GO. In the Raman results, the SnSe2 and the stronger ZnSe peaks were observed only in the CZTSSe film without a GO layer (see Fig. 3h and j). This result can be explained by the successful prevention of the decomposition of the CZTSSe phase via the reaction of Mo with sulfur and selenium, and it can be seen that the formation of the SnSe2 and ZnSe phases remaining in the GO embedded film was significantly suppressed.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics, the calculated average Jsc and the PCE for the CZTSSe solar cell with and without a GO layer. The electrical performance is detailed in Table 1. The CZTSSe solar cells with embedded GO layers generally exhibited enhanced Jsc and FF, showing the effectiveness of GO in improving the electrical performance. In the open circuit voltage (Voc) similar values were obtained, except for the G3 cell, and Jsc was increased remarkably by 2.9 mA cm−2 (from 34.7 mA cm−2 to 37.8 mA cm−2) for the G2 cell compared with the results for the reference cell without a GO layer. The average Jsc and PCE were calculated for six cells (active area of a cell: 0.31 cm2) that were fabricated using a 2.5 cm2 substrate. A photograph of the cell is shown in the inset of Fig. 4b. The CZTSSe solar cell with a GO layer exhibited a higher maximum average Jsc value of 37.3 mA cm−2, whereas the CZTSSe solar cell without a GO layer showed a low average Jsc of 35.3 mA cm−2. The average PCE of 9.25% was found for the CZTSSe solar cell without a GO layer, whereas the highest average PCE of 11.02% was found for the G2 cell. The most notable performance was observed for the G2 cell, a CZTSSe solar cell with an embedded GO layer, for which the PCE was increased by 2.0% and the FF by 3% over the corresponding values of the reference cell without a GO layer.

To diagnose the loss mechanism in the CZTSSe solar cells, diode quality factors, such as the series resistance (Rs), the ideality factor (nd), the shunt conductance (Gsh) and the reverse saturation current density (J0), were determined sequentially using a lumped circuit model from dark IV curves.64,65 The diode quality factors were tabulated along with the J–V characteristics for the CZTSSe solar cells in Table 1. The Jsc and FF values were most directly affected by the Rs values, which were evaluated by plotting the derivative dV/dJ against (1/(J + Jsc)) in Fig. 4d. Comparatively low Rs values were observed for the CZTSSe solar cells with GO layers, and the highest value was found for the reference cell in which a GO layer was not inserted. G2 exhibited the lowest Rs value of 1.51 Ω cm2 among the cells with GO layers. The sheet resistance was measured on the Mo after exfoliating the films using a four-point probe and is given in Table 1; lower values were recorded on the surfaces of the Mo back contacts in the CZTSSe solar cells with GO layers. The complete suppression of the formation of a dielectric secondary layer at the interface can be attributed to the improvement in the sheet resistance and Rs; thus FF was correspondently enhanced by the embedded Go layer. The cross-sectional morphology of cells with and without GO layers can be found in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen that MoSe2 grew at the interface between the absorber and the Mo back contact in the cell without a GO layer. The selective area electron diffraction pattern and the interplanar spacing in the TEM image of the cell without the GO layer correspond to hexagonal MoSe2, (JCPDS 20-0757) as is confirmed in Fig. 5d.66–69 In the annealing process for synthesizing CZTSSe, sulfur was also supplied, but MoSe2 was mainly formed because selenium was intentionally used more than sulfur. However, MoSe2 was not generated in the cell into which GO was inserted, and it was eventually confirmed that the intermediate layer successfully suppressed the generation of the secondary layer (see Fig. 5a, b, and S4†). The plot of dJ/dV against V in Fig. 4e was used to obtain Gsh. Only G3 exhibited higher Gsh values than those of the reference cell, whereas no meaningful change was observed in the other cells; thus, we can assume that residual parallel shunt paths resulting from relatively thick GO layers existed inside the absorber bulk film. Residual shunt paths can be considered to be recombination sites that attributed to the relatively poor Voc in G3. A similar behavior was observed for J0, which was extracted from the plot of J + Jsc-GV against V-RJ in Fig. 4f. G3 exhibited the highest J0 of the solar cells with and without GO layers, which unequivocally explains the low Voc values, because Voc is closely related to J0, as shown below:   where nd and kT/q denote the ideality factor and the thermal voltage, respectively. The thick GO layer that was formed in G3 could have partially hindered a majority carrier migration at the interface; thus, sufficient recombination could have occurred at the interface. A well-formed GO intermediate layer helps to enhance the electrical performance of CZTSSe solar cells.

To evaluate the suitability of a GO layer as a hole transfer layer, a UPS study was performed. Fig. 6 shows the UPS results for the Mo, GO, and CZTSSe films, an energy-level diagram, and the device structure. UPS was used to study the energy levels in Mo, Mo/GO, and Mo/GO/CZTSSe films to extract Φ and ionization potentials. The Φ values for the GO layer and the Mo back contact layer (Fig. 6a and b) were determined to be 5.39 and 5.42 eV, respectively. The Φ value for each layer was extracted using the formulaΦ = hν − |Ecutoff − EF|,where Ecutoff denotes the secondary electron cutoff, and EF denotes the Fermi level. A valence band edge of 0.51 eV and a Φ of 4.92 eV were observed for the CZTSSe absorber layer, as presented in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. Thus, the ionization potential of the CZTSSe absorber layer, which is the distance from the vacuum level to the valence band, was 5.43 eV. Fig. 6e shows the energy level diagram that was determined using the UPS results for each layer. The Φ value for the GO layer is located between the Φ value of the Mo back contact layer and the ionization potential of the CZTSSe absorber layer, which indicates that the GO layer is suitable for use as a hole transfer layer.

One way in which a GO layer can favorably impact the performance of a CZTSSe solar cell is via the prevention of interference effects at the interface. Evidence for photon harvesting by resolution of the interference effect was obtained using the optical electric field distribution in our devices. The distributions of the internal optical field intensity in the complete solar cell devices were calculated using complex refractive indices, which were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry using the transfer matrix method.70 The complex refractive indices for each layer of the CZTSSe solar cell, except for the Al top contact, are given in Fig. 7a and b. The optical electric field intensity in a device primarily depends on the complex refractive index. Fig. 7c shows the optical electric field distribution in the CZTSSe solar cells with and without GO layers. The results indicate that the optical electric field clearly depended on the interference effect. A higher optical electric field distribution was observed in the area corresponding to the absorber layer in the CZTSSe solar cell with a GO layer, and this distribution was slightly shifted compared with that of the cell without a GO layer. The absorption analysis depending on the wavelength for the absorber layer with and without a GO layer can be found in Fig. S5.† Absorption was enhanced in the absorber layer in which GO was embedded, as shown correspondingly by the simulated optical electric field results. Solar cells, however, absorb photons to generate excitons, and the subsequent dissociation of the excitons generates a charge in the active layer. The insertion of dissociation sites can therefore enhance the PCE of inorganic solar cells. Exciton generation depends on the optical electric field distribution in a device.70–72 The optical electric field distribution in a solar cell device is a yardstick for measuring the photo-generated carrier concentration, and the insertion of a GO layer improves the optical electric field intensity distribution in the CZTSSe absorber layer. The improved distribution of the optical electric field intensity results in the increased photo-generation of charge carriers. Our results showed that the most important role that the GO layer played was to improve the photo-generation of charge carriers in the absorber layer. The energy that is absorbed at position x in the layer can be determined using the following formula:   where Qj(x) denotes the time average of the energy that is dissipated in layer j at position x, c denotes the speed of light, εo denotes the permittivity of free space, ηj denotes the refractive index in layer j, αj denotes the absorption coefficient in layer j, and |Ej(x)|2 denotes the square modulus of the optical electric field. This equation shows the contribution of the optical electric field to the absorbed energy. The number of excited states in a layer is proportional to the number of absorbed photons; thus, the optical electric field represents the production of excited states. The GO layer increased the concentration of absorbed photons at the bottom of the absorber layer by suppressing the interference effect. This behavior of the GO layer was confirmed by the redistribution of the internal optical electric field in the CZTSSe solar cell with a GO layer compared with that for the device without a GO layer. Thus, the GO layer contributed to charge photo-generation by facilitating the formation and dissociation of excitations.

To explore the action of GO as an interfacial barrier to a MoSe2 secondary layer and the charge photo-generation ability of GO, a comparative study was performed between the highest performing CZTSSe solar cell with and without a GO layer to evaluate the effectiveness of the GO layer. The J–V results for the highest performing CZTSSe solar cell with and without a GO layer are presented in Fig. 8a. The CZTSSe solar cell with a GO layer that was deposited at a 45 nm thickness (G2) exhibited the highest PCE of 11.2%, along with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 37.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 453 mV, a FF of 64%, and a Rs of 1.76 Ω cm2. The electrical properties of the CZTSSe solar cells, including Voc, Jsc, FF, and Rs, were generally enhanced by the presence of the GO layer. The PCE was enhanced by 1.8% (from 9.4% to 11.2%), and Jsc increased by 2.9 mA cm−2 (from 34.7 to 37.8 mA cm−2) by the inclusion of a GO layer, which was in agreement with the EQE analysis shown in Fig. 8b. The CZTSSe solar cell with a GO layer showed a higher spectral response of over 90% for wavelengths ranging from 540–1020 nm than the cell without a GO layer. Considering the average Jsc for the cells (Fig. 4b), cells with GO layers exhibited higher Jsc than those of a typical CZTSSe solar cell without a GO layer. The dramatic improvement in the PCE from the presence of the GO layer was attributed to the resolution of the interference effect and the enhancement of FF by the passivation of a secondary dielectric layer.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the effect of a GO layer on the performance of CZTSSe solar cells that were fabricated by a sputtering method. A GO layer was embedded between the CZTSSe absorber layer and the Mo back contact layer with the objectives of (i) suppressing the formation of a secondary dielectric layer during the annealing process and (ii) blocking photon loss caused by interference between the incident light and the reflected light from the back contact. The lower Rs and enhanced FF of a CZTSSe cell with a GO layer compared with the corresponding values of an equivalent device without a GO layer resulted from the effective inhibition of the formation of a secondary layer at the interface between the absorber layer and the back contact during the annealing process. The internal optical electric field distribution in devices with and without a GO layer was calculated using the transfer matrix method to demonstrate the modification of the interference effect by the GO layer. The GO layer provided a higher optical electric field intensity distribution, which facilitated charge photogeneration and increased the excess carrier concentration, thereby considerably enhancing the Jsc and FF of the CZTSSe solar cells with a GO layer. UPS analysis confirmed that the GO layer had a suitable Φ to block electrons and transfer holes smoothly between the absorber layer and the Mo back contact layer. Consequently, the substantial improvement in the PCE of the CZTSSe solar cells upon inclusion of a GO layer occurred because the GO layer suppressed the formation of a dielectric secondary layer and resolved the interference effect in the absorber layer. The highest efficiency of 11.2% was achieved for a CZTSSe solar cell with a GO layer.
