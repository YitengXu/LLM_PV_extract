    , Accepted 4th September 2016First published on 5th September 2016AbstractA water/alcohol soluble conjugated porphyrin small molecule, FNEZnP-OE, in which two amino-functionalized fluorenes (9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorenes) are linked to a porphyrin core substituted with two polar 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyls by ethynylene linkages, is designed and synthesized as a cathode interfacial material (CIM) for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. The PTB7/PC71BM- and PTB7-Th/PC71BM-based devices with FNEZnP-OE as the electron transport layers (ETLs) exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.52% and 9.16%, respectively, which are increased by 47% and 41% compared to the devices with no ETL (5.78% and 6.50%, respectively). Most significantly, these PCEs are increased by 13.6% and 8%, respectively, over those with the widely used polymer ETL PFN (poly[(9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-ioctylfluorene)]). The outstanding performance of FNEZnP-OE CIM is contributed by not only the polar groups of 9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorenes and 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyls but also the porphyrin-relating π-conjugated backbone of FNEZnP-OE induced by the ethynylene linkages, demonstrating that functionalized porphyrins are very promising interfacial materials.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted ever-increasing interest due to their light weight, mechanical flexibility, and the potential of developing large-area devices through low-cost solution processing.1,2 Also, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) greater than 10% have been achieved in the past few years.3,4 Among the several factors that contributed to this advance, cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) ranging from inorganic metal compounds to organic polymeric/small molecules have been proven effective in improving OSC performance5–16 because an effective electron transport layer (ETL) between a metal cathode and the active layer can decrease the high work function (WF) of a bare metal cathode, improving the ohmic contact of the metal with the electron acceptor material and thus enhancing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of OSCs.16–18
Among the numerous CIMs, water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers are very promising in optoelectronic devices since they are processed from environmentally friendly alcohol solvents, which is important for future industrial applications and can prevent solvent erosion during the multilayer device fabrication, since active layers are usually not soluble in alcohol. Especially, the water/alcohol-soluble conjugated CIM poly[(9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-ioctylfluorene)] (PFN) has been widely used in organic photovoltaics (OPVs),4,19–21 and the amino-functionalized fluorene moiety plays very important roles in the OPV's excellent performance.
Compared to polymers, organic small molecule (SM)-based CIMs are recently attracting attention due to their intrinsic advantages such as well-defined chemical structure, simple synthesis and purification, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. However, the reports on SM CIMs are very limited.11,15,22–27 Therefore, it is very important to develop new and better CIMs. As the analogues of chlorophylls, porphyrins and their derivatives have been intensively investigated as electronic materials due to their large π-conjugated planes, high molar absorption coefficients and easy chemical modifications of the peripheries to improve the intramolecular charge transport and intramolecular electron transfer. We employed ethynylene linkages to connect electron-acceptor moieties such BT and DPP to the porphyrin core to synthesize conjugated porphyrin donor materials for OSCs. Due to the ethynylene linkages, these molecules are planar and the backbones are fully conjugated, significantly enhancing their charge mobilities and OPV performance compared to the corresponding materials without ethynylene linkages.28–30 Very recently, meso-tetra-pyridinium- and meso-tetra-phenyl-derived porphyrins were reported as CIMs with improved OPV performance. However, these compounds are not conjugated due to the perpendicular conformation between the pyridiniums or phenyl groups and the porphyrin core,31–33 which can limit the charge mobilities/transportation between the cathode and the active layers even though the self-assembled porphyrin can enhance the electron transport to some extent.31
In this study, using ethynylene linkages, we connect a very typical CIM block 9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene (FN) to a porphyrin core substituented with two polar 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyls to synthesize a conjugated porphyrin small molecule FNEZnP-OE (Fig. 1a). Contributed by the polar groups of two FN moieties and two 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyls, FNEZnP-OE shows good solubility in alcohol and is also soluble in pure water. The BHJ OSCs using FNEZnP-OE as the ETL between the Al cathode and the active layers of PTB7/PC71BM and PTB7-Th/PC71BM (Fig. 1, PTB7: poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl] [3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexy)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]; PTB7-Th: poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b] dithiophene] [3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] and PC71BM: [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester) exhibit PCEs of 8.52 and 9.16%, which are increased by 47% and 41% compared to the corresponding devices without any interlayer (5.78% and 6.50%, respectively). Most significantly, these PCEs are even higher than those with the widely used polymer PFN ETLs, with 13.6% and 8% improvement, respectively.

2. Experimental section
2.1. OPV fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned prior to device fabrication by sonication in acetone, detergent, distilled water, and isopropyl alcohol. After treatment with oxygen plasma for 4 min, 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) layer was spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s, and the substrates were subsequently dried at 150 °C for 10 min in air and then transferred to a N2 glovebox. Then, an active layer was prepared on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating at 1400 rpm for 40 s from a chlorobenzene solution of PTB7 (or PTB7-Th):PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w, total concentration of 25 mg ml−1) with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodoctane. 0.4 mg ml−1FNEZnP-OE methanol solution was then spin-coated onto the active layer with a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s (10 nm thick). For PFN interlayers, methanol solution with concentration of 0.2 mg ml−1 was spin-coated onto the active layer with a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Al (∼90 nm) was evaporated in a high-vacuum chamber with base pressure < 3 × 10−6 mbar as the top electrode. Masks made from laser beam-cutting technology with a well-defined area of 0.16 cm2 were attached to define the effective area for accurate measurement.
2.2. Thickness measurement
The thicknesses of films more than 100 nm thick were measured by a profile. For very thin films, their thicknesses were calculated based on their absorption values and the absorption and thickness values of the thick films.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Scheme S1†, FNEZnP-OE was obtained from the coupling of 5,15-diethynyl-10,20-bis(3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]phenyl)porphyrin zinc with 2-bromo-9,9′-bis(3′′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-fluorene, which were both synthesized and purified according to reported procedures.28,34 Contributed by the two FN moieties and two 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyl groups, FNEZnP-OE shows excellent solubility in polar solvents such as H2O, alcohol, DMF, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) without using any acid. Furthermore, FNEZnP-OE also shows good thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature higher than 300 °C (Fig. S5†).
As seen in Fig. 2a, FNEZnP-OE exhibits a typical porphyrin Soret band at 454 nm and a Q band at 665 nm in CH3OH. Since nonconjugated zinc porphyrins usually exhibit Soret and Q bands at about 420 and 550 nm, respectively,31,35 the significant redshifts of the Soret and Q bands are attributed to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the fluorene units and the porphyrin core due to the π-conjugation of the backbone induced by the ethynylene linkages. Furthermore, though the Q band intensity of FNEZnP-OE is much weaker than the Soret band, it is still much stronger than the very weak Q bands of non-conjugated zinc porphyrins, giving more evidence of the conjugation between FN units and the porphyrin core.
 Fig. 2  (a) Absorption spectra of FNEZnP-OE in CH3OH solution and in thin film, and (b) energy level diagram of the related OPV materials. 
The quantum chemical calculations further confirm the π-conjugation of the FNEZnP-OE backbone. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/(6-31G(D)+LANL2DZ) level show that the optimum geometry is planar (Fig. S2†), enabling conjugation of the whole molecule. The π-electrons at the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are delocalized at both the porphyrin core and the two fluorene moieties, while those at the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are mainly localized at the porphyrin core, which is beneficial for the ICT as revealed by its absorption spectrum.
In film, these bands red-shift to 470 and 683 nm, respectively, with the enhanced intensity of the Q band, and the absorption edge is seen at 713 nm, from which the optical band gap (Eoptg) was calculated to be 1.74 eV. The HOMO energy level (EHOMO) of FNEZnP-OE was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Since the oxidation onset potential (Eox) of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.36 V with respect to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode under the same experimental conditions, the EHOMO of FNEZnP-OE was estimated to be −4.99 eV from its onset oxidation potential (Fig. S3†) and according to the formula of EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.80 − 0.36) (eV).36 From the Eoptg and EHOMO, its LUMO energy level (ELUMO) was calculated to be −3.25 eV, which is higher than those of PTB7 and PTB7-Th as illustrated in the energy level diagram in Fig. 2b.27,37,38
3.2. Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the interfacial performance of FNEZnP-OE, it was spin-coated on top of the active layers from methanol solution as an ETL with the conventional BHJ OSC architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/FNEZnP-OE/Al (ITO: indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) (Fig. 1b) with PTB7:PC71BM or PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layers. For comparison, devices without ETL and with PFN ETL were also fabricated at the same condition. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the corresponding EQE curves of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 3 with the OPV characteristics of the short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) summarized in Table 1. As seen in Fig. 3 and Table 1, without any ETL, the OSCs with PTB7:PC71BM as the active layers show a moderate PCE of 5.78% with a JSC of 15.96 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.62 V and a FF of 59.48%. When the very typical polymer CIM of PFN was employed, the VOC, JSC, and FF values are increased simultaneously to 16.37 mA cm−2, 0.72 V and 63.61%, respectively, leading to a much improved PCE of 7.50%. When PFN ETL is replaced by FNEZnP-OE, the PCE is further enhanced to 8.52% with a significantly enhanced FF to 70.31%, a slightly improved VOC of 0.74 V and almost the same JSC of 16.38 mA cm−2. The PCE of 8.52% is increased by 13.6% and 47.4% compared to those devices with PFN and no ETL, respectively. For the devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layers, the solar cells with FNEZnP-OE ETLs show a JSC of 16.47 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.81 V and a FF of 68.69%, leading to a PCE of 9.16%, which is increased by 8% and 41% compared to those devices with PFN and no ETL, respectively. We noted that some groups have already reported high PCE around 9%, and the PCEs optimized here are only average for devices based on PTB7- or PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers and PFN ETLs,27 which may be ascribed to the material batch differences.

The JSC values calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. S4†) of the devices without and with ETLs are listed in Table 1, which agree well with the measured values. It is noted that FNEZnP-OE ETLs can simultaneously enhance the JSC, VOC and FF, though only slightly for JSC but significantly for both the VOC and FF, compared to those with no ETL for both PTB7-Th:PC71BM- and PTB7:PC71BM-based devices. Even compared to the devices with the widely used PFN ETLs, the OSCs with FNEZnP-OE ETLs show slightly improved JSC and VOC and enhanced FF to different extents, indicating that FNEZnP-OE performs excellently as a CIM.
3.3. Work functions of the modified cathodes
Since it has been reported that the VOC enhancement by an ETL could be attributed to the WF decrease of a cathode,25 we employed the Kelvin-probe system under N2 atmosphere to measure the effective WF values of the Al electrodes, bare or modified with the two CIMs of PFN and FNEZnP-OE, to clarify the effect of the FNEZnP-OE ETL. As listed in Table S2,† the WF values of bare, FNEZnP-OE and PFN-modified Al electrodes were measured to be 3.9, 3.4 and 3.5 eV, respectively.39 The WF of FNEZnP-OE-modified Al electrode is even slightly smaller than that modified with PFN, indicating the good electron injection ability of FNEZnP-OE.
The electron transport from the active layer to the Al cathode was not very efficient in devices with bare Al cathode because of the Schottky-barrier effect caused by the high contact resistance between the high-work function Al cathode and the LUMO of PC71BM.40 However, amino-functionalized, material-modified metal cathodes (such as Al) could increase the built-in potential of the OSCs through the surface dipole interaction between the pendant amino groups and the cathodes, leading to increased VOC values.41,42 Since it also has been proven that polar side groups can induce a CIM with excellent interfacial modification capability to enhance the charge collection from an active layer to the electrode,43 the excellent electron transport and extraction abilities of FNEZnP-OE can be ascribed to not only the amino-functionalized side groups but also the polar 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyl groups, which play very important roles for the reduction of the WF of the Al electrode due to the large interfacial dipoles.44–46
3.4. Dark J–V characteristics of the devices
Compared to devices with PFN ETLs, the performance enhancement of FNEZnP-OE-based ones is mainly contributed by the improvement of FF especially for PTB7:PC71BM active-layer devices. The dark J–V characteristics of the devices shown in Fig. 4 can provide useful information for the FF improvement. In the dark, the reverse currents of the OSCs in the region from −2 to 0 V are the largest suppressed by FNEZnP-OE ETL among the three devices, suggesting the best charge transport and extraction abilities to reduce the hole and electron recombination near the FNEZnP-OE modified Al cathode.25 These results are also consistent with the decreased series resistances (Rs) by FNEZnP-OE ETLs as summarized in Table 1, since reduced Rs values have been reported to be important for achieving higher FF values in OSCs.47 In addition, the reduced leakage currents and Rs in devices are also beneficial for obtaining a higher VOC due to the reduced potential drop across the devices.48

3.5. Electron mobilities
Electron mobilities measured by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method for the electron-only devices based on the architectures of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:PC71BM/interlayer/Al provide us more information for the enhanced FF by FNEZnP-OE ETL.49 As calculated from Fig. 5, the electron mobilities for the devices with no, PFN and FNEZnP-OE ETLs are 1.92 × 10−5, 2.30 × 10−4 and 3.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. While the electron mobilities of both devices with PFN and FNEZnP-OE ETLs show more than 10-folds enhancement compared to that with the bare Al, the mobility of FNEZnP-OE-modified devices is even larger than that of PFN-modified ones, demonstrating the better electron transporting ability of FNEZnP-OE.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a new conjugated water/alcohol-soluble small molecule FNEZnP-OE, consisting of two amino-functionalized fluorene units and a porphyrin core with the polar 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyls connected by ethylene linkages, is developed as a cathode interface material for OSCs. The BHJ solar cells with FNEZnP-OE-modified Al cathodes and PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layers show power conversion efficiencies of 8.52% and 9.16%, which are increased by 47% and 41% compared to the devices with no ETLs (5.78% and 6.50%), respectively. More importantly, FNEZnP-OE performs even better than a widely used polymer, CIM PFN, with 13.6% and 8% PCE enhancement, respectively. One the one hand, the two amino-functionalized fluorene units and the two polar 3,4-bis-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-phenyls at the porphyrin core play very important roles for the more favorable WF of FNEZnP-OE-modified cathode to increase the built-in potential. On the other hand, the extended π-conjugation backbone of FNEZnP-OE by the ethylene linkages is also beneficial for the enhanced electron transport. These preliminary results demonstrate that suitably functionalized porphyrins and their analogues are very promising cathode interfacial materials.
