The EELs of TAABs lead to simultaneous increases in open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density, and fill factor, enhancing the power conversion efficiency of BHJ solar cells from 2.38% to 4.02–4.19%. It is interesting that the same increase in VOC of about 0.14 V is obtained for devices with Al, Ag, and Au cathodes by using the EEL of TOAB. The self-assembly of TOAB into the lamellar structure stacked upright atop P3HT:PCBM is corroborated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The surface morphologies of TAABs atop P3HT:PCBM, explored by atomic force microscopy, show that there are ultrathin layers of TAABs in the regions beside large island clusters. The underlying mechanism is inferred that the TAAB molecules introduce anisotropic dipoles toward P3HT:PCBM which significantly elevate the vacuum level of the metal cathode for the efficient electron extraction. Our results provide a simple method to fabricate high performance BHJ solar cells by solution processing.IntroductionPolymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their potential of realizing low-cost, lightweight, flexible, and large-area devices.1 The commonly used architecture of PSCs is the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell composed of a phase-separated blend of a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative as the active layer sandwiched between an anode and a cathode.2–4 The nature of the active layer–electrode interface is critical and must be optimized for achieving high performance BHJ solar cells. Conventionally, indium tin oxide (ITO) coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and a low work function metal such as Ca are used as the anode and the cathode, respectively, to ensure ohmic contacts at both interfaces for achieving both high short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC).5 However, the low work function metal is susceptible to moisture and oxygen, which undermines its use for practical applications. Stable metals such as Al, Ag, or Au have been used as cathodes, but their high work function mismatches with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene derivative. It results in the decreases in both VOC and device performance.6To alleviate this problem, thermally evaporated LiF and Cs2CO3 as electron extraction layers (EELs) were inserted between the active layer and the Al cathode to enhance device performance.7,8 The development of solution-processed EELs has been prompted by the fact that fabricating PSCs by solution processing is an important advantage over inorganic solar cells.5,9,10 Solution-processed materials including poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),11 fullerene surfactants,12,13 alcohol–water soluble conjugated polymers,14–16 and conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs)17–19 were used to increase VOC, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ solar cells.The ionic functionalities of CPEs, commonly quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), ensure their solubility in the orthogonal solvents of the active layer, allowing the simple fabrication of BHJ solar cells by solution processing.17 Recently, it was reported that two cationic poly(thiophene) derivatives containing QASs led to the increase in VOC, enhancing the PCE of polycarbazole-based BHJ solar cells from 5.0% to >6.0%.18 It was also reported that a bis-adduct fullerene surfactant and a water-soluble polyfluorene derivative,13,19 containing QASs and ethylene oxide units, were used to increase VOC for achieving high performance BHJ solar cells with Al, Ag, and Cu cathodes. QASs should play an important role in the increase in VOC since the specific interaction between ethylene oxide units and Al is essential for the decrease in work function of Al and the formation of interfacial dipoles.20In our previous paper, we reported that the self-assembled tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), a general QAS, introduced anisotropic dipoles for the efficient electron injection in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs).21 In this study, we examine the performance of BHJ solar cells with tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB), TOAB, tetrahexadecylammonium bromide (THDAB), and their lowest homolog, ammonium bromide (AB) as EELs (Fig. 1). Four EELs improved the contact between the active layer and the Al cathode, leading to simultaneous increases in VOC, JSC, and fill factor (FF) to enhance the PCE of BHJ solar cells. Due to the strong dipoles of TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB, the enhancement of PCE is more pronounced with the EELs of TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB than the EEL of AB. The PCE of devices with TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, and THDAB/Al cathodes was 4.04%, 4.02%, and 4.19%, respectively, comparable to that of the device with a Ca/Al cathode (4.03%). The details are described in the following. Fig. 1  The conventional architecture of BHJ solar cells and the structure of four compounds as EELs. Results and discussionTo examine the performance of BHJ solar cells with four general compounds as EELs, the most extensively studied blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) was chosen as the active layer in BHJ solar cells. The configuration of each device was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/EEL/metal cathode as shown in Fig. 1. The EEL was prepared by spin-coating the ethanol solution of each compound (2 mg ml−1) atop P3HT:PCBM. For reference purposes, devices with the configuration of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/metal cathode were also fabricated.Devices with AB/Al, TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, and THDAB/Al cathodes were first studied and compared with those with Al and Ca/Al cathodes. Fig. 2a and b present the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all six devices under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark, respectively. The detailed performance parameters are tabulated in Table 1. The VOC was increased from 0.44 V for the device with an Al cathode to 0.54 V, 0.56 V, 0.58 V, and 0.58 V with AB/Al, TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, and THDAB/Al cathodes, respectively. The increased VOC is attributable to the increased built-in potential across devices with EELs.22 This speculation can be supported by the dark J–V characteristics of devices (Fig. 2b) since the diodes turn on at the voltage where the built-in potential is compensated.23,24 The turn-on voltage was increased from 0.16 V for the device with an Al cathode to 0.25 V with an AB/Al cathode, and further increased to 0.30 V with TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, and THDAB/Al cathodes. It is clear that the built-in potential across devices is increased with four EELs. Because all devices have the same anode, the increased built-in potential across devices with EELs is attributable to the decreased work function of Al.23,24 As a result, both series resistance (RS) and parallel resistance (RP, or shunt resistance) were affected by the decreased work function of Al. The RS value of the device with an Al cathode (10.08 Ω cm2) was decreased by 61%, 78%, 82%, and 78% with AB/Al, TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, and THDAB/Al cathodes, respectively. It indicates that four EELs effectively decrease the contact resistance at the P3HT:PCBM–Al cathode interface, which is favorable for the electron extraction from PCBM to the Al cathode.5,19 Therefore, devices with EELs showed a larger JSC than that of the device with an Al cathode. In addition, the JSC for devices with EELs was increased with the alkyl chain length. EELs also protect the active layer from physical damage and chemical degradation during thermal evaporation of Al, resulting in the decreased leakage currents (Fig. 2b) and the increased RP.7,11,19 The small RS and the large RP are responsible for the increased FF. Due to simultaneous increases in VOC, JSC, and FF, devices with AB/Al, TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, and THDAB/Al cathodes showed a higher PCE, 3.36%, 4.04%, 4.02%, and 4.19%, respectively, than that of the device with an Al cathode (2.38%). Note that the VOC, the turn-on voltage, and the RS of devices with TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, and THDAB/Al cathodes were almost the same as those of the device with a Ca/Al cathode which possesses an ohmic contact between PCBM and the Ca/Al cathode.22 It suggests that the EELs of TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB facilitate the ohmic contact between PCBM and Al for the efficient electron extraction. The PCE of the device with TBAB/Al, TOAB/Al, THDAB/Al cathodes was as high as that of the device with a Ca/Al cathode (4.03%). It demonstrates that tetra-n-alkyl ammonium bromides (TAABs) are effective solution-processed EELs for high performance BHJ solar cells.

Fig. 3 shows the J–V characteristics of devices and Table 2 tabulates the detailed performance parameters. The EEL of TOAB led to simultaneous increases in VOC, JSC, and FF for devices with Al, Ag, and Au cathodes. Interestingly, the same increase in VOC of about 0.14 V and the almost same RS value were obtained for devices with Al, Ag, and Au cathodes by using the EEL of TOAB, regardless of the work function of metals. It indicates that the EEL of TOAB significantly decreases the work function of Al, Ag, and Au. The decrease in work function of metals is not due to the chemical reactions between TOAB and metals because both Ag and Au are stable metals. The self-assembled TOAB with an ordered lamellar structure was proposed to introduce anisotropic dipoles toward the conjugated polymer, improving electron injection in PLEDs with Al, Ag, and Au cathodes.21 Therefore, the molecular stacking of TOAB atop P3HT:PCBM was investigated by synchrotron XRD. Fig. 4 shows the synchrotron XRD patterns of two samples with configurations as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TOAB. A broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.64°, corresponding to the interchain spacing in P3HT, was observed in both samples.25 The intensity and full width at half maximum of the diffraction peak were identical in both samples, indicating that there is no damage to P3HT:PCBM after spin-coating the ethanol solution of TOAB atop P3HT:PCBM. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.17° clearly indicates that TOAB molecules self-assembled themselves into the ordered lamellar structure with a d-spacing of 18.5 Å. It can be explained by the formation of a lamellar structure with a lattice plane consisting of horizontally arranged Br− with a d-spacing of 18.5 Å.21 In order to further confirm the orientation of the TOAB lamellar structure, the intensity of the diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.17° was monitored with the sample tilted in a few degrees along the chi dimension. The corresponding rocking curve is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The intensity of the diffraction peak with a maximum at χ = −90° sharply decreased with the sample tilted in a few degrees. It depicts that the lattice planes of the TOAB lamellar structure are normal to the P3HT:PCBM surface. This phenomenon is similar to the self-assembled TOAB atop the conjugated polymer in our previous report for PLEDs.21 In fact, tetra-n-alkyl ammonium halides show the lamellar structure in their crystals.26–28 Since the alkyl chains of the cations assemble into lattices that make “pockets” to accommodate the anions, the positively charged N atoms (N+) and anions are orderly arranged in a common plane called the “ionic plane”. The distance between ionic planes is dependent on the n-alkyl chain. Therefore, the self-assembled TOAB atop P3HT:PCBM introduces the anisotropic dipoles toward P3HT:PCBM through the ordered arrangement between N+ and Br−. The anisotropic dipoles toward P3HT:PCBM elevate the vacuum level of the metal cathode, decreasing the energy difference between the LUMO of PCBM and the work function of the metal cathode for the efficient electron extraction.29,30 It is the possible reason that the same increase in VOC is obtained for devices with Al, Ag, and Au cathodes by using the EEL of TOAB. Furthermore, the application of TBAB and THDAB is presumed to be the same as TOAB since both TBAB and THDAB show the lamellar structure in their crystals.27,28 In addition, the four alkyl chains in the tetra-n-ammonium cation prevent an anion from approaching closely to N+, which renders the QASs for the strong dipoles (>11 D).31 The replacement of one alkyl chain by hydrogen will result in the closer approach of N+ to Br−, significantly decreasing the strong dipoles of QASs. For example, the strong dipole decreases from 11.6 D for TBAB to 7.61 D for tri-n-butylammonium bromide with the replacement of one butyl chain by hydrogen.31 Therefore, we can expect that the dipole of AB is smaller than that of TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB. It is the reason that the increase in VOC is more pronounced when using the EELs of TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB than the EEL of AB.

Inset: corresponding rocking curve at 2θ = 3.17°. The surface morphologies of AB, TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB atop P3HT:PCBM explored by AFM are shown in Fig. 5a. There were large island clusters on the surfaces of four EELs; however these island clusters do not adversely affect the device performance. The number of island clusters seemed to increase with the alkyl chain length. It indicates that the alkyl chains improve the adhesion or wetting to the underlying P3HT:PCBM, which is the possible reason that the JSC was increased with the alkyl chain length. Fig. 5b shows AFM images of Al (80 nm) atop four EELs. There still were island clusters distributed on the surfaces of four samples, being similar to Fig. 5a. However, there were new raised spots with a diameter about 200 nm and a height about 50 nm distributed in the region beside island clusters. The raised spots are not observed for both P3HT:PCBM and Al atop P3HT:PCBM as shown in Fig. 6. It is inferred that there are ultrathin layers of AB, TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB in the region beside island clusters, influencing the growth of Al atop them. The enhanced performance of BHJ solar cells should originate from these ultrathin layers. Fig. 5  (a) AFM images for the EELs of (i) AB, (ii) TBAB, (iii) TOAB, and (iv) THDAB atop P3HT:PCBM.

The EELs of TBAB, TOAB, and THDAB facilitate the ohmic contact between the active layer and the Al cathode, resulting in simultaneous increases in VOC, JSC, and FF to achieve the high PCE, 4.04%, 4.02%, and 4.19%, respectively. The superior device performance is clearly attributable to anisotropic dipoles toward the active layer due to the ordered arrangement between N+ and Br− in the self-assembled TAABs atop the active layer. The anisotropic dipoles significantly elevate the vacuum level of the metal cathode, rendering stable metals (Al, Ag, and Au) as cathodes for high performance BHJ solar cells. Our results provide a simple method to fabricate high performance BHJ solar cells by solution processing.ExperimentalITO-coated glass substrates (RITEK Corp., 15 Ω □−1) were cleaned ultrasonically in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, sequentially, for 20 min each. Subsequently, they were treated with UV ozone for 25 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios™ P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated on each substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s and then baked at 150 °C for 30 min. The active layer, P3HT:PCBM, atop PEDOT:PSS was obtained by the slow-growth process without any heat treatment. The P3HT:PCBM blend with a ratio of 1:1 w/w was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (20:20 mg ml−1) and stirred for at least for 24 h in a nitrogen-filled glove box. P3HT (Rieke Metals, Inc.) and PCBM (Nano-C, Inc.) were used as received. After spin-coating the P3HT:PCBM solution, the samples were dried in covered glass Petri dishes. AB, TBAB (m.p. 121 °C), TOAB (m.p. 101 °C), and THDAB (m.p. 105 °C)32 were used as EELs and their ethanol solution (2 mg ml−1) was spin-coated atop P3HT:PCBM to prepare EELs. AB (Alfa Aesar, ≥99%), TBAB (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%), TOAB (Fluka, ≥99%), and THDAB (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%) were used as received. The metal cathode of each device, Al (80 nm), Ca/Al (40 nm/80 nm), Ag (80 nm) or Au/Ag (10 nm/80 nm), was thermally evaporated at a pressure of about 10−6 torr. The area of each device was 0.06 cm2 defined by a shadow mask during thermal evaporation of metals.The J–V characteristics of devices under an AM 1.5 G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The AM 1.5 G illumination was simulated by using an Oriel 91160A 300 W Solar Simulator and calibrated by using a standard Si photodiode detector with a KG-5 color filter (Hammastau, S1133).33 The values of RS and RP were calculated from the reciprocal slope at 2.0 V and 0 V, respectively, in the dark J–V characteristics of devices.34 XRD experiments were performed using the X-ray with a wavelength of 1.0252 Å at the superconducting wiggler beamline BL13A1 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. AFM images were obtained by a NanoScope IIIa (Digital instrument Inc.) operating in the tapping mode.AcknowledgementsFinancial support by the National Science Council (NSC), Taiwan (NSC 100-2221-E-006-165-MY2 and NSC 101-2918-I-006-022), is gratefully acknowledged.
