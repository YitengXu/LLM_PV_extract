    , Accepted 6th February 2016First published on 8th February 2016AbstractA series of polymer photodetectors (PPDs) are fabricated based on P3HT as an electron donor and fullerene-free material DC-IDT2T as an electron acceptor. The only difference among these PPDs is the P3HT:DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios from 2:1 to 150:1. The PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) as the active layers exhibit champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28000% and 4000% corresponding to 390 nm and 750 nm light illumination at −20 V bias, respectively. The photomultiplication (PM) phenomenon should be attributed to the enhanced hole tunneling injection due to the interfacial band bending, which is induced by the trapped electrons in DC-IDT2T near the Al cathode. The high EQE value in the long wavelength range is due to the effect of DC-IDT2T photon harvesting and exciton dissociation on the interfacial trap-assisted hole tunneling injection. Meanwhile, the PPDs with DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor exhibit superior stability compared with the PPDs with PC71BM as the electron acceptor.
Introduction
Polymer photodetectors (PPDs) have attracted increasing attention due to their advantages compared with inorganic counterparts, for example, low-cost fabrication, light weight, large-area detection and a tunable spectral response range.1–4 Most of the PPDs reported so far are photodiode type photodetectors with photocurrents originating from the collection of photogenerated charge pairs.5–9 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of photodiode type PPDs are lower than unity, which is codetermined by the insufficient photon harvesting efficiency, exciton dissociation efficiency, charge carrier transport and collection efficiency.8,10–12 Therefore, a preamplifier circuit is required to identify the weak photocurrent of photodiode type PPDs for real applications.13 It is desirable to obtain ultra-high EQE and low dark current PPDs to meet the potential applications, especially in the near infrared (NIR) region. Recently, we reported a series of photomultiplication (PM) type PPDs based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC71BM (100:1, w/w)/LiF/Al device structure.14–18 The champion EQE of the PM type PPDs is about 16700% for the devices under −19 bias.14 Then, the champion EQE of the PM type PPDs was further improved to 37500% or 115800% by removing the LiF interfacial layer or further adjusting the P3HT molecular arrangement from an edge-on to a face-on structure.15,16 The spectral response range of the PM type PPDs can be extended to the NIR region based on P3HT:PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layers due to the photon harvesting by the narrow band gap material PTB7-Th.17 This approach has been confirmed to be an efficient strategy for ternary polymer solar cells to increase the power conversion efficiency.19–22 However, PM type PPDs should be further evaluated with different materials as the active layers, which can clarify the effects of interfacial band bending, the origin of trapped electrons, charge carrier transport and charge carrier injection barrier on the performance of PM type PPDs.
In recent years, fullerene-free materials have attracted increasing attention as excellent electron acceptors for efficient polymer solar cells due to their unique advantages such as strong absorption in the visible and NIR regions, adjustable energy levels and good stability.23–27 Namdas et al. reported a series of photodiode type PPDs with P3HT doped fullerene-free materials, exhibiting a relatively high EQE value of 80% under −3 V bias.28 Park et al. also reported a green-sensitive OPD with high spectral sensitivity and selectivity using SubPc derivatives as the electron acceptor, exhibiting an EQE value of 60.1% under −5 V bias.29 The photodiode type PPDs also become unstable or are vulnerable to break down under a relatively large reverse bias (>5 V), which is mainly attributed to the relatively large dark current. To the best of our knowledge, a fullerene-free material as the electron acceptor has never been reported in the PM type PPDs. In this study, a fullerene-free material DC-IDT2T was selected as a substitute of PC71BM to investigate the effect of the electron acceptor on the performance of PM type PPDs. The PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1) as the active layers exhibit a champion EQE of 28000% and 4000% corresponding to 390 nm and 750 nm light illumination at −20 V bias, respectively. Meanwhile, the EQE values of the PM type PPDs were enhanced in the longer wavelength range due to the effect of DC-IDT2T photon harvesting and exciton dissociation on the interfacial trap-assisted hole tunneling injection. The champion EQE, responsivity and detectivity values of PPDs reach 4000%, 23.9 A W−1 and 2.60 × 1013 Jones at −20 V bias under 750 nm light illumination with an intensity of 54.72 μW cm−2, indicating a high NIR spectral response of PPDs with the fullerene-free material DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor.
Experimental section
The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω per square were sequentially cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water and ethanol. The cleaned ITO substrates were dried using nitrogen gas and treated with oxygen plasma for 1 min to improve its work function and clearance. The solution of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrates at a spin speed of 5000 rounds per minute (rpm) for 40 s. The PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates were baked at 120 °C for 10 min. Polymers P3HT (purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp.) and DC-IDT2T27 (synthesized according to our previous report) were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) to prepare 40 mg per ml solutions, respectively. The molecular weight and regioregularity of the used P3HT is about 48000 g mol−1 and 91%–94%, respectively. Then, the P3HT and DC-IDT2T solutions are blended with various volume ratios 150:1, 100:1, 50:1 and 2:1, respectively. The mixed solutions were spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS layers at 800 rpm for 30 s in a high purity nitrogen-filled glove box, and the thickness of the active layers is about 300 nm. The cathode of Al (100 nm) film was deposited on the active layers by thermal evaporation under 10−4 Pa and the thickness was monitored by using a quartz crystal microbalance. The active area of each device is about 3.8 mm2, which is defined by the overlap of the Al cathode and the ITO anode.
The current density versus voltage (J–V) curve of PPDs was measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A calibrated solar simulator (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) with 100 mW per cm2 power density was used as the light source. The used monochromatic light was provided by a 150 W xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator. The light intensity spectrum of the monochromatic light was recorded by using a Thorlabs S120VC power meter. The absorption spectra of films were recorded by using a SHIMADZU UV-3101 PC spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films were recorded using a HORIBA Fluorolog®-3 spectrofluorometer system. The thickness of active layers was measured by using an AMBIOS Technology XP-2 stylus profilometer. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions. The chemical structures of the used materials and the device structure of the PPDs are shown in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
The absorption spectra of neat P3HT and DC-IDT2T films were recorded and are shown in Fig. 2a. P3HT exhibits a strong absorption in the visible light range with an absorption peak at 520 nm, DC-IDT2T has strong absorption in the longer wavelength range with an absorption peak at 725 nm and a shoulder peak at 670 nm. The blend solutions P3HT:DC-IDT2T with different weight ratios of 150:1, 100:1, 50:1 and 2:1 were used to prepare the active layers of PPDs. The dark current density versus voltage (JD–V) curves of PPDs with different DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. It is apparent that the dark current density (JD) of PPDs decreased with the decrease of DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios in the active layers. The underlying reasons can be attributed to the limited electron injection and transport in the active layers with low DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios. For the PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) as the active layer, electrons can be easily injected from ITO onto the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of DC-IDT2T due to the large contact interface between ITO and DC-IDT2T. The injected electrons can be effectively transported along the continuous electron transport channels under reverse bias. For the PPDs with relatively low DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios, electron injection and transport should be limited due to the small contact interface between ITO and DC-IDT2T and the absence of electron transport channels. Meanwhile, hole transport should be improved with the decrease of DC-IDT2T doping weight ratio due to the more ordered P3HT molecular arrangement in the active layers. If the valve of hole injection can be turned on under light illumination, holes will be continuously injected from the external circuit and effectively transported from one electrode to the other electrode, resulting in a large light current density (JL). The J–V curves of all the PPDs were measured in the dark and under different light illumination intensities to investigate the hole tunneling injection and transport properties in the active layers. The J–V curves of the PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T weight ratios of 2:1 and 100:1 as the active layers are shown in Fig. 2c and d. The J–V curves of the PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T weight ratios of 50:1 and 150:1 as the active layers are shown in Fig. S1.†

As seen from Fig. 2c, it is apparent that the light current density (JL) of PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) as the active layer rapidly reaches the saturation state when the applied bias is larger than −0.2 V, indicating that photogenerated charge carriers can be effectively collected by the corresponding electrodes. Meanwhile, the JL of PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) as the active layer is markedly increased with the increase of light illumination intensity, which should be attributed to the greater number of photogenerated charge carriers in the active layers. As seen from the J–V curves of PPDs with rather low DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios as shown in Fig. 2d and S1,† the JL is increased with the increase of applied bias and the JD of PPDs is kept at a rather low level, suggesting that the valve of hole tunneling injection can be turned on under light illumination. The JL of PPDs with different DC-IDT2T doping ratios also increased with the increase of light illumination intensity, which should be attributed to the greater number of electrons trapped in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode, resulting in more efficient hole tunneling injection from the Al electrode. The PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) as the active layer exhibit the best performance due to appropriate interfacial traps to enhance hole tunneling injection and efficient hole transport in the active layer. The JL is increased to about five orders of magnitude greater than JD at −10 V bias. The large JL/JD ratio may be attributed to the more efficient hole tunneling injection under light illumination. As we can envisage, the small amount of DC-IDT2T can be considered as electron traps in the blend films due to the large LUMO barrier of 0.95 eV between P3HT (−2.9 eV) and DC-IDT2T (−3.85 eV). The photogenerated electrons can be trapped in DC-IDT2T due to the rather low DC-IDT2T doping ratio, resulting in a rather low electron transport in the active layers. Meanwhile, holes can be effectively transported along the continuous channels formed by P3HT in the active layers. The charge carrier transport properties can be further demonstrated from the rather low electron current density of electron-only devices and the rather high hole current density of hole-only devices under the same bias, as shown in Fig. S2.† The trapped photogenerated electrons in DC-IDT2T near the Al cathode can build up a Coulomb field to induce the interfacial band bending for hole tunneling injection from the Al electrode. According to the Richardson–Dushman equation:30,31 (1)where J is the injection current density, Δϕ is the average energy barrier change of the Schottky junction, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and nt is the trapped electron density. The average energy barrier change (Δϕ) is a linear function of trapped electron density (nt) in DC-IDT2T, and the injection current density (J) obeys an exponential relationship with the energy barrier change (Δϕ). More electrons will be trapped in DC-IDT2T near the Al cathode under a relatively strong light illumination intensity and a large applied bias, resulting in the enhanced hole tunneling injection from the Al electrode and improved hole transport in the active layers.
To confirm the effect of trap-assisted hole tunneling injection on the performance of PPDs, the EQE spectra of all PPDs with different DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios were recorded under −10 V bias. For the PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) as the active layer, there are two apparent dips from 490 nm to 570 nm and from 650 nm to 750 nm in the EQE spectrum of PPDs with a thick active layer, EQE values are less than 20% in the whole spectral range, as shown in Fig. 3a. According to the EQE spectra and J–V curves of PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) as the active layer, the PPDs should be photodiode type photodetectors. It is highlighted that the two dips in the EQE spectrum agree well with the absorption peaks of P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) blend films. To intuitively investigate the correspondence, the dips in the EQE spectrum and the peaks of the absorption spectrum are marked by double arrow lines in Fig. 3a. The dips in the EQE spectra of the photodiode type PPDs can be well explained by the suppressed charge collection efficiency due to the relatively large active layer thickness of 300 nm.32–34 As we can envisage, most of the incident photons will be harvested by the materials near the ITO electrode, especially for the light in the strong absorption range of the active layers, resulting in most of the charge carriers getting generated near the ITO electrode. Holes can be easily transported and collected by the ITO electrode, while electrons are hardly collected by the Al electrode due to the thick active layers. Therefore, EQE values are suppressed in the strong absorption range of P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) blend films due to the unbalanced charge carrier transport and collection. To further confirm the effect of the charge carrier transport balance on the EQE spectra of PPDs, a series of PPDs were fabricated with different thicknesses of active layers by adjusting the spin-coating speed. The EQE spectra of the PPDs were recorded under −10 V bias, as shown in Fig. S3.† It is apparent that the EQE spectra become increasingly flatter with the decrease of the thickness of the active layers, which should be attributed to the shorted electron transport distance and the more balanced charge carrier collection in the PPDs with relatively thin active layers.

For the PPDs with relatively low DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios, EQE values of the PPDs are larger than 100% in the spectral range from 350 nm to 750 nm under −10 V bias, as shown in Fig. 3b. This phenomenon indicates that PM type PPDs were successfully fabricated by using DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor and traps in the active layers. The PM phenomenon indicates that the working mechanism of the PPDs should be the enhanced hole tunneling injection assisted by interfacial band bending under light illumination, rather than the photovoltaic phenomenon. The interfacial band bending of P3HT should be attributed to the trapped electrons in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode, and the origin of trapped electrons in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode can be reflected from the EQE spectra of PPDs. The fewer electrons trapped in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode can hardly cause the interfacial band bending, leading to the inefficient hole tunneling injection from the Al electrode and relatively low EQE values. A distinct dip in the EQE spectra of the PM type PPDs was observed from 490 nm to 570 nm, which is very similar to that in the EQE spectra of PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (2:1, w/w) as the active layer. However, the underlying reason for the dips in the EQE spectra is completely different for the photodiode type or PM type PPDs. The dip in the EQE spectra of PM type PPDs should be attributed to the fewer trapped electrons in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode under light illumination in this spectral range. As we can envisage, most of the incident photons with wavelengths from 450 nm to 600 nm can be harvested by P3HT near the ITO electrode due to the strong absorption of P3HT in this spectral range, resulting in most of the excitons getting generated in P3HT near the ITO electrode. The photogenerated electrons near the ITO electrode are difficult to transport to DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode due to the rather low DC-IDT2T content in the active layer, leading to less interfacial band bending and inefficient hole tunneling injection. A similar phenomenon was observed in the EQE spectra of PPDs with P3HT:PC71BM (100:1, w/w) as the active layer.14–17
To investigate the effect of bias on the performance of PPDs, EQE spectra of PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) as the active layer were recorded under different biases and are shown in Fig. 4a. It is apparent that the EQE values of the PPDs increased with the increase of reverse bias. The champion EQE values of the PPDs reach 28000% and 4000% corresponding to 390 nm and 750 nm light illumination at −20 V bias, respectively. The increased EQE with the increase of reverse bias can be well explained by the following three points: (i) more electrons can be collected and trapped in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode under a relatively large reverse bias; (ii) the trap-assisted hole tunneling injection should be enhanced due to more interfacial band bending under a relatively large reverse bias; (iii) the transport time of holes flowing across the whole active layer can decrease under a relatively large reverse bias. It is known that the EQE values can also be calculated using the following equation:35 (2)where χ is the fraction of excitons that are dissociated into trapped electrons and free holes, τ is the lifetime of trapped electrons, T is the transport time of holes flowing across the active layers, V is the applied bias, L is the active layer thickness, and μ is the field dependent hole mobility. Meanwhile, the dip in the EQE spectra becomes shallower with the increase of reverse bias, indicating that the large number of photogenerated electrons near the ITO side can accumulate in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode under a large reverse bias. The responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) are the typical figures of merit to evaluate the performance of photodetectors. The R and D* value dependences on incident light wavelength were calculated under −20 V bias and are shown in Fig. 4b. The light intensity spectrum of the used monochromatic light is shown in Fig. S4.† The R can be calculated according to the following equation:11,36 (3)where Jph is the photocurrent density and Iin is the incident light intensity. The R is about 131.4 A W−1 under 630 nm light illumination with an intensity of 67.13 μW cm−2, and about 23.9 A W−1 under 750 nm light illumination with an intensity of 54.72 μW cm−2, respectively. The dark current of PM type PPDs is rather low, which can be considered as the noise current. With the given assumption, the D* of the PPDs can be estimated according to the following equation:37,38 (4)where e is the absolute value of electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 Coulombs). The champion D* values reach 1.43 × 1014 Jones (cm Hz1/2 W−1) at 630 nm and 2.60 × 1013 Jones at 750 nm under −20 V bias, respectively. The relatively large R and D* values should be attributed to three key points: (i) the low JD due to the absence of an electron transport channel in the active layers and the relatively large Schottky barrier for hole tunneling injection under dark conditions; (ii) the valve of hole tunneling injection can be turned on under light illumination, resulting in the efficient hole tunneling injection assisted by interfacial traps; (iii) efficient hole transport in the active layer (donor:acceptor = 100:1, w/w). The high response of PPDs in the long wavelength range should be attributed to the photon harvesting by DC-IDT2T according to the absorption spectrum of DC-IDT2T.

To clarify the effect of the electron acceptor on the performance of PPDs, a series of PPDs were fabricated with P3HT:PC71BM (100:1, w/w) as the active layer and the EQE spectra of PPDs were recorded under different biases, as shown in Fig. 5a. The EQE values of PPDs increased with the increase of reverse bias. The champion EQE values reach about 35000% at −20 V bias in the spectral range from 350 nm to 650 nm, which is slightly larger than those of PPDs with DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor under the same conditions. However, the EQE values are rather low in the long wavelength range for the PPDs with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. For the intuitive comparison, Fig. 5b shows the EQE spectra of PPDs with PC71BM or DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor under −10 V bias. It is apparent that the PPDs with DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor exhibit relatively large EQE values in the long wavelength range, which should be attributed to the greater number of trapped electrons in DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode under long wavelength light illumination. The trapped electrons should originate from the exciton dissociation on DC-IDT2T. This means that the photon harvesting of the acceptor also plays a key role in determining the number of trapped electrons in the acceptor near the Al electrode, which will influence the EQE values of PPDs in the absorption range of acceptor material. For the PPDs with P3HT:PC71BM (100:1, w/w) as the active layer, the EQE values are much larger than those of the PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) as the active layer in the short wavelength range, which should be attributed to the effect of PC71BM photon harvesting on the number of trapped electrons near the Al electrode, as shown in Fig. S5.† Meanwhile, the EQE values of PPDs with PC71BM as the electron acceptor are much larger than those of PPDs with DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor in the strong absorption range of P3HT. Although the photon harvesting should be very similar for the P3HT:PC71BM (100:1, w/w) or P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) blend films, especially in the strong absorption range of P3HT, the exciton dissociation efficiency of P3HT may be different due to the different driving force provided by the different LUMO levels, resulting in a different number of trapped electrons in PC71BM or DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode. As we know, the hole tunneling injection strongly depends on the interfacial band bending, i.e., the number of trapped electrons in PC71BM or DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode.

To investigate exciton dissociation of P3HT in blend films, the PL spectra of P3HT:PC71BM and P3HT:DC-IDT2T with different doping weight ratios were recorded under the excitation of 490 nm light and are shown in Fig. 6. For the two kinds of blend films, PL emission quenching of P3HT can be continuously enhanced with the increase of PC71BM or DC-IDT2T doping weight ratios in blend films. Meanwhile, PL emission of P3HT can be efficiently quenched by doping PC71BM compared with DC-IDT2T for the blend films with the same donor:acceptor doping weight ratio, resulting in a relatively greater number of trapped electrons in PC71BM near the Al electrode under the same light illumination conditions. The more efficient exciton dissociation in P3HT:PC71BM films can well explain the relatively large EQE values of the corresponding PPDs. The fullerene-free material DC-IDT2T was used as the electron acceptor for polymer solar cells, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.93% based on PBDTTT-C-T:DC-IDT2T (1.2:1, w/w) as the active layer.27 To further clarify the effect of electron acceptors on the performance of PM type PPDs, the energy levels of the used materials are schematically depicted for the PPDs under working conditions, as shown in Fig. 7. The greater number of electrons trapped in PC71BM or DC-IDT2T near the Al electrode should result in more obvious interfacial band bending for efficient hole tunneling injection.

When PPDs are illuminated for light incident from the ITO electrode, most of the photogenerated electrons are generated near the ITO electrode and then trapped in the acceptor near the ITO electrode. The trapped electrons will be transported and accumulated in the acceptor near the Al electrode under reverse bias.18 The number of trapped electrons in the acceptor near the Al electrode is codetermined by the trap depth and photogenerated electrons from exciton dissociation in the active layers. More trapped electrons in the acceptor near the Al electrode will result in more obvious interfacial band bending, which means that the valve of hole tunneling injection can be easily turned on under light illumination. The schematic energy levels of PPDs with P3HT:PC71BM (100:1, w/w) and P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) as the active layers are shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. The depth of electron traps in the blend films is about 1.4 eV or 0.95 eV for P3HT/PC71BM/P3HT or P3HT/DC-IDT2T/P3HT, which is determined by the LUMO levels of P3HT and PC71BM or DC-IDT2T. This means that the excitons on P3HT can be easily dissociated into free charge carriers at P3HT/PC71BM interfaces due to the relatively large driving force of 1.4 eV, which is well confirmed by the PL spectra of the two blend films. The number of trapped electrons in the acceptor near the Al electrode plays a key role in determining hole tunneling injection under light illumination. The electron acceptor DC-IDT2T can harvest the low energy photons in the NIR region, resulting in relatively high EQE values in this spectral range for the PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) as the active layer.
To investigate the air stability of PPDs with PC71BM or DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor, the EQE spectra of the PPDs were recorded after different storage times under −10 V bias, as shown in Fig. S6.† All the PPDs were exposed to air without encapsulation during the stability measurement. It is apparent that the EQE spectra of the PPDs with PC71BM or DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor exhibit different decay processes with the increase of storage time. For the intuitive comparison, the relative EQE values at 390 nm of the two kinds of PPDs dependent on storage time are depicted in Fig. 8. The real EQE decay values of PPDs dependent on the storage time are shown in the inserted image of Fig. 8. It is obvious that PPDs with PC71BM as the electron acceptor exhibit a more rapid decay process compared with the PPDs with DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor due to the easier PC71BM aggregation under working conditions. The PPDs with DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor exhibit relatively high air stability, maintaining 61% initial EQE value after 40 hours exposure in air. The PPDs with PC71BM as the electron acceptor only maintained 43% initial EQE value after 40 hours exposure in air. The relatively high air stability of the PPDs with DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor may be attributed to the weak aggregation of DC-IDT2T in the active layers.26,27 The air stability of PM type PPDs is also one of the key parameters for its potential application, especially for the high performance NIR photodetectors.

Conclusions
In summary, PM type PPDs are realized based on P3HT as the electron donor and fullerene-free material DC-IDT2T as the electron acceptor. The PPDs with P3HT:DC-IDT2T (100:1, w/w) as the active layer exhibit the champion EQE values of 28000% and 4000%, corresponding to 390 nm and 750 nm light illumination at −20 V bias, respectively. The PM phenomenon should be attributed to the enhanced hole tunneling injection assisted by the trapped electrons in DC-IDT2T near the Al cathode. The high EQE values in the NIR region should be attributed to the effect of DC-IDT2T photon harvesting and exciton dissociation on the interfacial trap-assisted hole tunneling injection. The PM type PPDs provide an efficient method to detect NIR light with high EQE, responsivity and detectivity characteristics. This work opens up a new potential application of fullerene-free materials to obtain high performance PM type PPDs with superior stability.
