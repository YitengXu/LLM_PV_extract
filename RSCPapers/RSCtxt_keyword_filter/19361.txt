    , Accepted 15th January 2018First published on 15th January 2018AbstractThe unprecedented rise in efficiency of perovskite-based photovoltaics has sparked interest in semi-transparent devices, particularly for tandem structures. Despite promising reports regarding efficiency and reduced parasitic absorption, many devices still rely on processes from the gas phase, compromising both applicability and cost factors. Here, we report all-solution perovskite solar cells with improved infrared transparency ideally suited as top-cells for efficient multi-junction device configurations. We demonstrate the functionality of copper(I) thiocyanate as antireflective layer and as selective contact between the transparent conductive oxide and the perovskite. This concept allows us to fabricate an opaque device with steady state efficiency as high as 20.1%. By employing silver nanowires with robust environmental stability as the bottom electrode, we demonstrate different regimes of device performance that can be described through a classical percolation model, leading to semi-transparent solar cells with efficiencies of up to 17.1%. In conjunction with the implementation of an infrared-tuned transparent conductive oxide contact deposited on UV-fused silica, we show a full device average transmittance surpassing 84% between 800 and 1100 nm (as opposed to 77% with PEDOT:PSS as the selective contact). Finally, we mechanically stacked optimized perovskite devices on top of high performing PERL and IBC silicon architectures. The measured imputed output efficiency of the 4-terminal perovskite–silicon solar cell was 26.7% and 25.2% for the PERL–perovskite and IBC–perovskite, respectively.
Introduction
The advent of perovskite solar cells has lead to the fastest rise in performance in the history of photovoltaics, with the highest certified power conversion efficiency for single junction devices recently topping 22%.1 The combination of low material cost, solution processability and high efficiency confers perovskites the status of a highly promising source of sustainable energy with very low energy payback time.2 Conversely, during the last few decades a worldwide cumulative effort has made silicon solar technology approach its theoretical efficiency limits.3–5 On that account, the tandem integration of these two solar technologies has been envisioned as an approach to potentially boost the efficiency of silicon, with the minor complication of installing a parallel production line for solution processed perovskite-based technology.6–9 As such, recent theoretical simulations proposed that 4- and 2-terminal configurations could comfortably exceed the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit. Although these findings clearly demonstrate an interesting direction for perovskite–silicon multijunction technology, the wholesome optimization of optical and electrical losses including electrodes and buffer layers is not finished.10 Using a more realistic approach, Filipič et al.11 conducted optical simulations utilizing 4-terminal geometries including different levels of optical losses. The latter characterization based simulations forecasted 4- and 2-terminal silicon–perovskite tandem architectures well exceeding 30% efficiency. This estimation pushed the interest of the community even further showing significant efficiency advances (see the state-of-the-art evolution depicted in Fig. S1†). One of the advantages of the 4-terminal configuration is that the two cells are only optically coupled, but not electrically. A schematic representation of a 4-terminal silicon–perovskite configuration is depicted in Fig. 1. This enables the independent development of both the silicon and the perovskite solar cells without the necessity of current matching (2-terminal series) or voltage matching (2-terminal parallel). A particularly promising experimental result has shown 4-terminal imputed conversion efficiencies of up to 26.4% by combining 16.0% efficient perovskite solar cells with a 23.9% efficient silicon cell.12 The latter example, however, along with the majority of reports fell short of demonstrating one of the most relevant advantages of perovskite technologies: complete solution processability (see Fig. S1†). Usually, vacuum processed top-electrodes (e.g. ITO)12–14 and energy-intensive deposition techniques (e.g. sputtering)7,8,12,15,16 are utilized to achieve high transparency and performance, thereby compromising part of the cost benefit of the solution-processed absorber layer. Engineered designs that provide improved light management and more functional elements deposited by inexpensive scalable techniques are necessary milestones on the roadmap for realizing industrially relevant protocols.

With respect to semi-transparent electrodes, different strategies have been reported for improving their optical transmittance attributes. These strategies often range from innovative semitransparent nanostructured conductive layers to highly transparent conductive composites incorporating optical coupling and antireflection coatings.17–21 Despite the large research attention, nurtured by the vision of semitransparent photovoltaics as part of urban infrastructures, there is only little information on the optical losses for both illumination directions.22,23
In this work, we study the opto-electrical effects of nanostructured transparent electrodes on the device performance of single-junction perovskite solar cells when measured from both directions. In this way, the opto-electric properties of the electrode can be tailored according to the application and transmittance requirements. Among the various solution processable electrodes, silver nanowires (AgNWs) excel with a trade-off between transmittance and sheet resistance that approaches the values of sputtered ITO.24,25 In previous reports, we developed a protocol for obtaining semitransparent devices with similar shelf lifetimes to their counterparts with evaporated silver as the electrode.26,27 Here, utilizing a similar fabrication method, we carry out an in-depth analysis of the energy losses of perovskite devices with spray coated AgNW electrodes of varied conductivities. We identify the optimum performance conditions for AgNW electrodes close to their percolation threshold. We further minimize parasitic absorption typically originating from the hole-transporting layer using copper(I) thiocyanate as the contact of choice. CuSCN has been reported as a PEDOT:PSS replacement for the fabrication of transistors28 and organic photovoltaics,29 but solution processing so far has suffered from low solubility. The utilization of CuSCN as a HTL underneath the perovskite absorber layer is more challenging as one of the most crucial requirements for growing perovskite is an ideal morphology of the template layer. The utilization of electro-deposited CuSCN as the HTL led to efficiencies up to 16.6% (ref. 30) and only very recently similar efficiencies were achieved with the deposition from solution.31,32 As a result, we achieve a 17.1% efficient perovskite device showing high levels of optical transmission towards the infrared region. We then explore the potential of our device architecture as a top-cell in multi-junction tandem devices utilizing two different high performing silicon-based solar cell structures.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the electrodes and their effects on the device performance
To evaluate our nanostructured metal nanowire electrodes we deposited various films via spray coating on glass and on ZnO-nanoparticle coated glass substrates. The latter is important because it features the surface used in our most common device architecture (see Fig. S2c†). The measured sheet resistances ranged from 2 ohms sq−1 to 120 ohms sq−1 (2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 16, 31 and 120 ohms sq−1). A complete collection of opto-electrical characteristics of our AgNW electrode is displayed in Fig. S2.† Following the percolation model,33,34 as the nanowire density increases, two different regimes can be recognized. The percolation threshold is the onset of finite conductivity once a continuous path of connections between single wires has been established across the whole electrode. When the density of connecting links within the nanostructured material increases to a value larger than the percolation threshold, we can observe a parallel rise in conductivity. Subsequently, when the nanowire density increases further to a value greater than a critical thickness, tmin, the optoelectrical properties of the film start to deviate from the percolation behavior. At this point, the overall optical transmittance of the film drops rapidly while the sheet resistance decreases only slightly. In Fig. 2a we fitted the behavior of the transmittance at 500 nm as a function of sheet resistance using the equations described by the percolation model (see description in the ESI†). As can be seen from Fig. 2a, tmin, indicated by an arrow, is defined by the intercept of the fitting lines between the percolation regime and the bulk regime. The derived electrical to optical conductivity ratio describing the bulk regime (σDC/σOP) for our films was 187, while the percolation regime factor (Π) was 45.2. An analysis of the figures of merit for alternative geometrical aspect ratios on the silver nanowires as well as for a variety of nanostructured materials other than AgNWs can be found in the literature.6,13,19

The observed trend can be divided in two regimes: the bulk-like (gray box) and the percolative (white section) regime. These regimes have been fitted using eqn S1 (solid-black line) and eqn S2 (solid-blue line) discussed in the ESI,† respectively (a). Schematic representation of the device architecture utilized for electrode characterization (b).

The error bars represent one standard deviation above and below the arithmetical media extracted from a total of 12 cells, excluding outliers. The values are presented either as absolute or normalized by opaque devices performance. Top view SEM micrograph of AgNW electrode with sheet resistance of 16 ohms sq−1 (d and e). 
In order to correlate the optical and electrical properties of the AgNW electrode with the solar cell performance, we fabricated semitransparent devices with a relatively thin active layer (∼250 nm) and electrodes with sheet resistances as reported above. The device architecture utilized is as follows: glass/ITO/PEDOT (<50 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (∼250 nm)/PC60BM (∼50 nm)/ZnO:Al nanoparticles (nps) (∼30 nm)/AgNWs. A scheme describing the two illumination conditions, from the AgNW electrode and from the ITO electrode, is shown in Fig. 2b. The full set of photovoltaic parameters can be found in the ESI (see Table S1†). In order to provide a better understanding of the electrode related losses it is necessary to analyse the interplay between the spectrally resolved incident photon to current efficiency (external quantum efficiency, EQE) and the optoelectrical properties of the AgNW electrode. To this end, we recorded the device's EQE in both illumination directions (Fig. S3†). The EQE corresponding to the opaque cell with an evaporated Ag electrode shows a well-defined signature structure corresponding to the Beer–Lambert and optical cavity spectral regime, characteristic of this particular architecture with an active layer thickness of 250 nm.26,35 Not surprisingly, for the semitransparent solar cells using AgNW electrodes with the lowest sheet resistance (2 ohms sq−1), the spectrally resolved EQE is similar to the opaque device with evaporated silver when illuminated from the substrate side (Fig. 2c and S3†). Regardless of the illumination condition, electrodes with higher sheet resistance lead to a distinct overall EQE loss. For the AgNW illumination condition, these EQE losses are mostly dominated by parasitic light absorption in the nanowire electrode. This optical attenuation then governs the EQE spectral response for AgNW electrodes with sheet resistance in the bulk regime (grey box in Fig. S3† described by the solid-black line). When going from the bulk to the percolation regime, the series resistance of the electrode increasingly dominates the nature of the performance losses under both illumination conditions (see Table S1†). Nevertheless, the electrode's parasitic light attenuation affected the performance less significantly under the AgNW illumination condition until it becomes negligible. In the extreme case of electrodes with conductivities as low as 50 ohms sq−1 the series resistance losses not only affect the photocurrent generation under short circuit conditions but also begin to govern the fill factor and the injection regime (Fig. 2c).
Rationalizing the electrode-related optical and electrical loss mechanisms allows the selection of the best configuration for a specific application. Particularly, our detailed analysis shows that for higher conductivity electrodes, optical losses dominate while electrical losses are almost negligible. However, this slowly changes for lower conductivity electrodes (see Fig. S3†) and a transition occurs when the sheet resistance changes from 8 ohms sq−1 to 16 ohms sq−1. At a sheet resistance of ∼16 ohms sq−1, the total transmittance is 88% (averaged over 300 nm to 1100 nm) and accounts for 78% of the substrate losses. The 16 ohms sq−1 electrode results in devices with comparable overall efficiency. In addition, the 16 ohms sq−1 AgNW electrode works exceptionally well for the 4-terminal tandems, as we will see further below (even better than the 2-terminal tandems), because it guides light with longer wavelengths to the bottom Si cell. A top view of the semitransparent devices shown in Fig. 2d and e illustrates the separation between conductive wires with the selected sheet resistance.
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells with reduced wide-band gap parasitic absorption and reflection losses
For the perovskite-based semitransparent devices, the selection of the charge extraction material is of equally crucial importance as the electrode optimization.36 In order to minimize the parasitic absorption of the semitransparent perovskite solar cell we decided to use wide bandgap semiconductors. Specifically, a combination of copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole transporting layer and aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) nanoparticles as the electron selective top layer were selected to engineer the following device architecture: ITO/CuSCN (<10 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (∼650 nm)/PC60BM (∼50 nm)/ZnO:Al nps (∼30 nm)/AgNWs. CuSCN is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor with hole mobilities of 0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, showing almost negligible absorption throughout the visible and near infrared spectra due to its wide bandgap of more than 3 eV (EVB = 5.3 eV and ECB = 1.5 eV; VB = valence band, CB = conduction band) (see Fig. S4†)37,38 and good thermal and chemical stabilities.28,39 Subsequently, CuSCN was utilized as a hole transporting layer on top of the perovskite semiconductor showing efficiencies of up to 16%.14 Accordingly, we selected CuSCN as an underlying HTL because of its low parasitic optical absorption and a diffractive index approaching perovskite values in the IR regime. ZnO:Al was selected to properly decouple the AgNWs from the iodine containing perovskite. As a reference, we fabricated devices with PEDOT:PSS and benchmarked them with our CuSCN HTL. In order to further minimize the parasitic absorption, typically introduced by the glass–ITO (∼15 ohms sq−1) substrate, we utilized a commercially available infrared-tuned transparent metal oxide contact (∼20 ohms sq−1) deposited on UV-fused silica. The fused silica substrate presents superior optical properties showing an average ITO/air corrected total transmittance in the vicinity of 90% for both ranges 300 nm to 800 nm and 800 to 1100 nm (see Fig. S5a and b†). The devices presented almost identical performance for both the fused silica and the glass substrates with a moderate increase in current density generation (see Fig. S5c and d†). Except for the HTL, both architectures were prepared using the same fabrication steps. The AgNW electrodes were deposited utilizing the same optimization criteria for reducing optical losses on the perovskite semitransparent single junction as mentioned above. Typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a for the opaque as well as for the semitransparent configuration and the key metrics for best performing devices are summarized in Table 1. The efficiency of the best performing device on both the opaque and the semitransparent configuration was determined to be 20.1% and 17.1%, respectively, with CuSCN as the HTL. CuSCN-based devices show high reproducibility (Fig. 3c), negligible hysteresis (Fig. S6a†) and outstanding shelf-lifetimes exceeding 3600 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere and without encapsulation (Fig. S6b†). In order to validate the short circuit photocurrent (Jsc) extracted from the J–V characterization, we recorded EQE spectra (Fig. 3b) showing Jsc values consistent with J–V measurements. The perovskite semitransparent solar cell was fabricated with a protocol modified from a previously developed method in our laboratories,26,40 and the full details are provided in the Methods section. Typical cross-sections of a full device are shown in Fig. 4a and b.

Independent theoretical studies realized by D. T. Grant et al.36 and S. Albrecht et al.41 showed that the largest loss mechanism for a tandem perovskite/silicon solar cell is reflection. The largest part of this loss is then distributed into the interfaces corresponding to the selective contact and the absorber layer for both the perovskite subcell and the silicon one (see Fig. 2b).36 Analogously, for the interface ITO/HTL/perovskite the selection of an HTL with a relatively high refractive index and low extinction coefficient will reduce Fresnel reflection and parasitic absorption (see Fig. S7a and b†). In the same framework, we recorded the total reflectance and corresponding total transmittance of our two systems, CuSCN-based and PEDOT:PSS-based semitransparent devices (see Fig. S7c†). The CuSCN-based device shows a significant improvement in transmittance over its PEDOT:PSS counterpart, 84.8% versus 77.4% (800 nm to 1100 nm range), respectively. However it is not yet apparent whether this advantage is induced by the refractive index distribution difference or their respective extinction coefficients in the IR regime.
In order to decouple the influence of the extinction coefficient from the Fresnel reflection losses, we compared our CuSCN-based devices with devices using the widely utilized poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,5,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA).12,15,42,43 PTAA has a similar extinction coefficient than CuSCN only with a lower refractive index distribution (see Fig. S7a†). When comparing the full device transmittance of identically fabricated devices using PTAA (81.1% AVT; 800 nm to 1100 nm) and CuSCN as the HTL we observe, again, a clear superiority of the latter in the IR transmittance. Moreover, by extracting the reflection and transmission difference, it becomes apparent that CuSCN affords and improves optical coupling compared to PTAA by reducing the overall device reflection (lower panel in Fig. S7d†). To better understand the absorption and reflection losses of the individual architectures we simulated in the following the optical response of different equivalent layer stacks using the Transfer Matrix Formalism (TMF) using various hole-transporting layers (Fig. 3d–f). TMF properly accounts for absorption, constructive and destructive optical interactions as well as reflection losses from all interfaces in the absence of strong scattering. We utilized the layer stack sequence reported above only exchanging the HTL with some state-of-the-art selective contacts, including NiO14 PEDOT:PSS44,45 and PTAA.12,42,43 We then calculated the IR average transmission (Fig. 3d) and average reflection (Fig. 3e) (800 nm to 1100 nm) emulating full semitransparent devices comprising HTLs with thicknesses ranging from 0 nm to 200 nm when illuminated through the substrate. The recognizable under-estimation of the transmittance compared to our experimental results can be attributed to errors in the optical constants, microstructure inhomogeneity and localized thickness variations. Our simulations show the superiority of CuSCN across the complete thickness range under study. Following the same methodology, we performed subsequent simulations with fixed HTL thicknesses and varied perovskite layer widths (Fig. 3f). The thicknesses of the HTL layers were 10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm and 60 nm for CuSCN, NiO,14 PTAA12,42,43 and PEDOT:PSS,44,45 respectively. The latter shows an oscillating average transmittance response most likely due to a cumulated resonating optical interference effect in the multi-layer structure. Within this oscillation, the CuSCN-based architectures predominantly outperformed their counterparts showing higher average transmittance in the 800 nm to 1100 nm range (Fig. 3f) at a reduced average reflectance in the same range (Fig. S8a†). This assertion remains true when fixing the thicknesses of all the HTLs to the same value (Fig. S8b and c†).
4-Terminal perovskite/silicon tandem measurements utilizing semitransparent devices with a highly IR-transparent HTL and electrode
The reduced parasitic absorption and minimized reflection losses in the ITO/CuSCN/perovskite layer stack, along with the correct selection and optimization of the electrode are of strategic relevance for the design of 4-terminal tandem architectures. As can be seen in Fig. S9,† the ∼16 ohms sq−1 electrode reduces the transmission by a spectrally flat 10%, approximately. This drop is in agreement with the total transmittance of a pure AgNW layer alone after correction for the glass contribution, which we determined with 88% total transmittance over the full spectral regime (see Fig. S10†). Consecutively, we measured a series of silicon cells under light filtered with a perovskite full device (a schematic diagram of the measurement can be found in Fig. 4c–e). Particularly, we utilized a passivated emitter with rear locally diffused silicon cells (Si-PERL) and interdigitated back contact silicon cells (Si-IBC) with an area of 1 cm2. The fabrication method of our silicon devices is described in detailed elsewhere.46,47 The performance of the silicon cell was evaluated with J–V and EQE measurements and the results are summarized and in Table 1. For the 4-terminal tandem evaluation, the characterization was carried out independently for each sub-cell. The reduced light intensity over the silicon solar cell translated into a mild reduction in Voc along with an increase in FF. The latter is attributed to a reduced effect on the series resistance under low illumination conditions. The resulting EQE spectra of CuSCN-based 4-terminal tandem cells are shown in Fig. 5b for the PERL–perovskite and in Fig. 5d for the IBC–perovskite configuration (for the PEDOT:PSS-based 4T measurements see Fig. S11†). The photocurrent density extracted from EQE measurements of the silicon PERL cell is 17.7 mA cm−2 when it is filtered using a CuSCN-based semitransparent device or 16.0 mA cm−2 when it is filtered using a PEDOT:PSS-based semitransparent device.

The photocurrent density extracted from EQE measurements of the silicon IBC cell is 17.0 mA cm−2 when it is filtered using a CuSCN-based semitransparent device or 15.2 mA cm−2 when it is filtered using a PEDOT:PSS-based semitransparent device. We further observed the power output over time of our semitransparent devices with a silicon cell underneath in order to confirm the efficiency (Fig. S12†). The total added efficiencies of the 4-terminal perovskite–silicon tandems were 26.7% (26.9% when using MgF2 as the antireflection layer, Fig. S13†), 20.9%, 25.2% and 19.5% for CuSCN/perovskite–PERL, PEDOT:PSS/perovskite–PERL, CuSCN/perovskite–IBC and PEDOT:PSS/perovskite–IBC based architectures, respectively. Finally, in order to prove the relevance of our study, and particularly of our percolation electrode, we tested the intrinsic stability of our AgNW electrodes under various conditions including: light soaking under solar spectral irradiance, damp heat (85 °C – 85% R.H.) and dark shelf storage in air (Fig. S14 and S15†). Our electrodes show a very robust behavior with little to no degradation even when exposed to the harshest environments for more than 800 hours (for more details on the stability assessment of the electrode refer to the ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a single-junction semitransparent perovskite-based solar cell with an efficiency of 17.1%. This device is fully solution processed including the top electrode, which is deposited at room temperature using spray coating. Solution processed AgNWs, a prototype representative for percolation-based electrodes, allow minimizing the overall losses with unprecedented precision by simply optimizing the spray coating process parameters. Our findings inform a correlation between charge carrier percolation, optical transmittance and photovoltaic performance in devices with nanostructured metal electrodes. We emphasize that percolation and transmittance need to be carefully balanced in order to minimize optical and electrical losses relevant for tandem structures. This is particularly critical in the UV and IR regimes where the introduction of copper(I) thiocyanate as a hole-transporting and antireflective layer between the transparent conductive oxide electrode and the perovskite active layer further reduces optical losses to a minimum due to its better-matched refractive index. The optical contribution of the nanowire mesh showing a 550/1000 nm total transmittance ratio greater than ∼0.95 and the reduced reflection losses brought about by the copper-based selective contact enabled us to produce a 4-terminal PERL–perovskite tandem cell with imputed 26.7% efficiency (26.9% when using MgF2 as an antireflective layer). The results presented in this manuscript represent one step forward towards the realization of multijunction photovoltaics with device architectures relevant for large-scale employment and efficiency values surpassing the single-junction limit. Future efforts would be dedicated into the incorporation of impermeable electron extraction layers between the metal halide perovskite and the silver nanowire electrode. It has been shown in the literature that a thin continuous layer of thin oxide can successfully suppress the ingress of moisture towards the perovskite, and more importantly, prevents the egress of decomposition products of the perovskite.48
Materials and methods
Materials and precursor
Unless stated otherwise, all materials were used as received and were purchased from Merck or Aldrich. CH3NH3I was purchased from Dyenamo. PEDOT:PSS 4083 was provided by Heraeus. 12 wt% CuSCN in diethyl sulphide was stirred at room temperature overnight. ZnO, ZnO:Al and NiO nanoparticle inks were supplied by Avantama; anhydrous solvents and short exposures to air were used during its preparation upon request. PbI2 and CH3NH3I (1:1 molar ratio, respectively) were diluted (∼40 wt%) into a DMF–DMSO dilution (2:1 v/v, respectively). The precursor was stirred at 60 °C for 20 minutes and subsequently filtered while still warm. Prior to utilization, the precursor solution was stored in the dark for at least 24 hours. Isopropanol based AgNW ink with a 1 wt% loading was provided by Rent A Scientist (RAS). Individual solvents comprising the ink were tested to evaluate whether the perovskite film can withstand exposure to them, this would be evident by a change in colour from dark brown to light yellow. Acetone, ethylene glycol, isopropanol and ethyl acetate were tested from which only ethylene glycol proved to be detrimental to the film by this particular test. This solvent was removed from the ink upon request. The AgNW ink was used as received.
Device fabrication
Laser patterned ITO (with a roughness of 5–7 RMS) substrates were ultrasonically cleaned using acetone and isopropanol for 10 minutes each followed by an oxygen plasma cleaning process. The cleaned substrate was then coated with a PEDOT:PSS layer by means of spin coating at a speed of 2000 rpm and annealed at 140 °C for 15 minutes. The CuSCN solution was spin coated at 3000 rpm and annealed at 110 °C for 10 minutes. The perovskite deposition was performed by spin casting ∼90 μL of the precursor on the selective contact layer at various speeds. Right after deposition, the wet film was partially dried with a moderately strong Nitrogen stream for 10 seconds. The partially dry perovskite film was annealed at 110 °C for 10 minutes.
After perovskite deposition, a compact ∼60 nm thick layer of PC60BM is spin coated. A 2 wt% solution of PC60BM in chlorobenzene is then deposited using a three-step speed profile with no subsequent annealing. The ZnO or ZnO:Al film was spin coated at 2000 rpm and annealed for 5 minutes at 80 °C. For opaque devices, the counter electrode was deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 10−6 torr. For semitransparent devices, the AgNW counter electrode was deposited using an automated spray coating system where the sheet resistance was controlled by the number of layers deposited. The device area for all perovskite-based devices is 10.4 mm2.
Device characterization
Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization under light was carried out by means of a Keithley 2400 source measure unit and Newport Sol1A solar simulator with an AM1.5G spectrum at 0.1 W cm−2, which was determined using a calibrated single-crystal standard Si-cell. To avoid current contribution from adjacent pixels during the measurement we utilized a shadowing mask for all J–V characterizations. J–V characterization was carried out as follows: forward direction, speed: 1 mV ms−1 and a dwell time of 8 ms. Semitransparent and opaque devices were initially tested with the aid of a maximum power point tracker consisting of a perturb-and-measured routine and/or uninterrupted current density sampling under initial Vmpp conditions (a full description is provided in the ESI†). All reported J–V characterizations were obtained after efficiency stabilization for at least 1 minute (Fig. S11†). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded with an Enli Technology QE-R measurement system, also calibrated with a Si PV cell. Optical absorption measurements were performed with a UV-Vis spectrometer Lambda 950 from Perkin equipped with an integrating sphere.
Optical simulation
Except for PTAA and CuSCN, all the optical constants where estimated as follows: reflection (incidence angle of 8°) and transmission (normal to the sample) of the deposited layers are measured and implemented using the software NIKA47 in order to obtain the wavelength-dependent complex refractive index. It should be mentioned that, in the case of NiO, optical constants were estimated only until 1000 nm. Completion until 1100 nm was then extrapolated according to the literature values and trend. Furthermore, the AgNW layers are treated as an effective medium in the framework of the TMF method. As such, optical constants were extracted using the software NIKA and the nominal thickness was verified by experimental measurements.
