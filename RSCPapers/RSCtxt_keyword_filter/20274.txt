    , Accepted 13th February 2012First published on 14th February 2012AbstractIn this paper, novel chalcopyrite copper indium sulfide (CuInS2) nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized by a simple one-pot route using the inorganic ligand [Sn(acac)2Cl2] as an auxiliary agent (capping agent and shape-control agent). Factors including reaction temperature, reaction time and amount of Sn(acac)2Cl2, that influence the morphology, size, monodispersity and optical properties of the CuInS2 NCs were studied in detail. The results showed that the morphology and size of the CuInS2 NCs can be controlled by changing the reaction conditions, and Sn(acac)2Cl2 played an important role in the formation of the final nanocrystals. Sn(acac)2Cl2 not only controlled the shape and improved the monodispersity, but also improved the chemical composition and photoelectric response of the prepared CuInS2 NCs. Time-dependent experiments were performed to observe the growth of CuInS2 NCs. CuInS2 NCs with sizes ranging from ∼5 to ∼17 nm could be obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions, and the corresponding optical and electrical properties of the different size CuInS2 NCs were also investigated. The Ostwald ripening mechanism has been proposed for the formation of final polygon CuInS2 NCs with the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 and has been compared with the mechanism of CuInS2 NCs prepared without the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2. CuInS2 NCs synthesized by the proposed method showed broad absorption in the visible region and a high photoelectric response to visible light, which indicates that CuInS2 NCs capped with inorganic ligands may have potential applications as an absorber layer in solar cells. The synthesis strategy developed in this work may be used as a general process for the synthesis of pure or doped chalcogenide NCs.
Introduction
In recent years, semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted great attention due to their size-dependent properties, flexible processing chemistry, novel properties and potential technological applications in photovoltaic solar cells, light emitting diodes, and non-linear optical devices.1,2 NCs could be used as nanocrystal ink that is coated on a substrate to yield a low-cost solar cell, so the synthesis of semiconductor NCs has attracted great attention in the area of solar cells. Up to now, a series of semiconductor NCs such as CdSe, CdTe, etc. has been prepared and investigated for application in nanocrystal-based solar cells because of their obvious photoinduced charge-transfer effects and high power conversion efficiency of the devices.2–4 However, most of the semiconductor nanocrystals contain toxic heavy metals such as Cd, Pb, Te, and so on, which limits their practical applications. CuInxGa1−xSe2 (CIGS) with a band gap of 1.3 eV has been demonstrated to have a high power efficiency of ∼20%, which is the highest among thin-film solar cell technologies. An analogous system, copper indium sulfide (CuInS2) has a desirable direct band gap of 1.5 eV, which is well matched with the solar spectrum and is more environmentally friendly without the Se.5 Thus CuInS2 has great potential as a solar harvester for the new generation of solar cells.6 The power conversion efficiencies of using CuInS2 NCs in solar cell devices have approached ∼5%.7,8 Solution routes to semiconductor nanocrystals are particularly appealing because they are less energy intensive than vacuum techniques and have the potential for scalability; the nanocrystal suspensions can also be easily deposited via spin-coating or printing.9 So far, several solution synthetic methodologies for CuInS2 NCs have been explored, including the hot-injection method,10–12 hydrothermal techniques,13,14 chemical transformation route,15 and thermal decomposition of suitable precursors.16–18 However, these synthetic procedures still require relatively complex and costly operation. And these methods do not always yield monophasic CuInS2 NCs, but also hybrid materials, e.g., materials composed of Cu2S–In2S3.14
It is widely known that the surface ligands play a key role in the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals19 and strongly affect the physics,20 charge transport property,21,22et al. In order to obtain high-quality nanocrystals, it is necessary to select suitable surface ligands in the synthesis process. In most synthesis procedures of different NCs, surface ligands are usually organic compounds with long hydrocarbon chains.23 The insulating nature of such organic ligands typically results in poor electronic communication between the NCs. Recently, Talapin found that various molecular metal chalcogenide complexes (MCCs) such as [Sn2S6]4− and [Sn2Se6]4−, could serve as convenient ligands for colloidal nanocrystals.24 MCC inorganic ligands open an innovative way to device-level manipulation of nanocrystals and benefit many nanocrystal-related potential applications. However, hydrazine used for the preparation of MCCs is a highly toxic chemical, and these MCCs could not be used directly for the preparation of NCs. As is well known, the shape and size of semiconductors are vital parameters for their properties,25 so controlling the shape and size of inorganic nanomaterials is of fundamental importance because of the strong correlation between these parameters and physical chemical properties.26 Therefore, a facile and inexpensive method for the preparation of monodisperse and pure CuInS2 NCs that have controlled size or shape is still highly demanded.
In this work, we describe a kind of inorganic ligand [Sn(acac)2Cl2] and use it directly for the preparation of NCs by a simple one-pot route. With the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2, nearly monodisperse CuInS2 NCs can be synthesized by the one-pot synthesis method. The factors [reaction temperature, reaction time and amount of Sn(acac)2Cl2] that influence the morphology, monodispersity and size of CuInS2 NCs were studied in detail. The experimental results indicated that the Sn(acac)2Cl2 not only controlled the shape, improved the monodispersity, but also influenced the chemical composition and photoelectric response of CuInS2 NCs. The size and optical properties of the CuInS2 NCs can be easily controlled by adjusting the reaction time and reaction temperature. CuInS2 NCs synthesized by the proposed method showed broad absorption in the visible region and high photoelectric response to visible light, which indicate CuInS2 NCs capped with inorganic ligands may have potential application as an absorber layer in solar cells. The synthesis strategy developed in this work may be used as a general process for the synthesis of pure or doped chalcogenide NCs.
Experimental details
Materials
Indium(III) acetylacetonate [In(acac)3] and copper(II) acetylacetonate [Cu(acac)2] were purchased from Afla. 2,4-pentanedione (98%), tin tetrachloride, 1-dodecanethiol (DDT, 98%), triethylamine (99%), ethanol, acetone and chloroform were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
Synthesis of CuInS2 NCs by one-pot route
The synthetic process of Sn(acac)2Cl2 was similar to before.27 In a typical procedure: Cu(acac)2 (0.2 mmol), In(acac)3 (0.2 mmol), Sn(acac)2Cl2 (0.1 mmol) and DDT (10 mL) were mixed in a 25 mL three-necked bottle with the aid of magnetic stirring. Then the mixture was heated to 200 °C for 120 min. After being cooled to room temperature, the NCs were separated by precipitation with the addition of acetone. The precipitates were further purified by chloroform and acetone several times. Final products were obtained and dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room temperature for further characterizations. The synthesis of different CuInS2 NCs was performed by changing one of the experimental parameters as indicated. In order to ascertain the growth mechanism of CuInS2 NCs, time-dependent experiments were performed and aliquots were taken out with a syringe at different times (30, 60, 90 and 120 min) to monitor the growth of CuInS2 NCs during the reaction.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations were performed using a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The phase and crystallographic structure of the products were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X'Pert Pro, Cu-Kα: λ = 0.154056 nm). The chemical composition of products was analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS, Horiba EMAX Energy EX-350). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained by using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 35). The I–V curve was measured by the Semiconductor Characteristic Measurement System (Model: SCS/F′-4200). The photoelectrical property of the CuInS2 NCs thin films was studied with the surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS, Stanford SR830). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 360 FT-IR spectrometer using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e thermal analyzer in a flowing nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature region of 25–700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of polygon CuInS2 NCs
The XRD pattern of the representative CuInS2 NCs synthesized at 200 °C for 120 min is shown in Fig. 1A. The diffraction peaks of as-synthesized CuInS2 NCs can be indexed to the chalcopyrite phase of CuInS2 (JCPDS No. 75-0106). The major XRD diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ = 27.97°, 46.46° and 55.16° which are attributed to (112), (220)/(204) and (312)/(116) planes can be seen clearly. The peak intensity of (112) is stronger than that of (220) and (312), revealing that the (112) is the preferred growth plane. No obvious peaks resulting from impurities are observed, indicating the high purity of the as-synthesized CuInS2. The lattice parameters (a = b = 5.52 Å; c = 11.13 Å) of the typical sample refined by the Jade 5 software are similar to the reported data (JCPDS No. 75-0106, a = b = 5.517 Å, c = 11.06 Å). The morphology of the as-synthesized CuInS2 NCs was investigated by TEM and HRTEM. From the TEM image of CuInS2 NCs in Fig. 1B, we can see that the products are polygon NCs, and the size of the obtained NCs is about 17 nm in diameter. The HRTEM image indicates that the NCs have good crystallinity, and the lattice fringe d = 3.2 Å corresponds to the (112) lattice place of CuInS2 NCs (Fig. 1C), which indicates the growth of CuInS2 NCs along the [112] direction. This result corresponds well with that from XRD pattern. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of nanocrystals is shown in Fig. 1D, the diffraction spots corresponding to the (112), (220)/(204) and (312)/(116) planes can be seen clearly which match the XRD pattern of CuInS2. The SAED pattern of the CuInS2 NCs also suggest that the nanocrystal is a single crystal and the CuInS2 NCs have good crystallinity. The composition of CuInS2 was confirmed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (detail of the EDS results are shown in Tab. S1–S3).† EDS of typical CuInS2 NCs shows an average value of the Cu:In:S ratio of 0.87:0.88:2.00. The relatively large S content may be partly attributed to DDT (also playing the role of capping agent) existing on the surface of the CuInS2 NCs. Considering the error of the EDS detector (approximately ±2 atom%), this value basically agrees with the theoretical value of 1:1:2.

Influence of the reaction conditions
As we all know, the reaction temperature, reaction time and concentrations of the surfactants have significant impacts on the morphology, size and photoelectric properties of the NCs. To ascertain the growth mechanism and influence of reaction conditions, we performed a number of experiments under different conditions, including adjustment of the reaction temperature (180 °C to 240 °C), reaction time (30 min to 120 min) and the amount of Sn(acac)2Cl2 (0 mmol to 0.2 mmol).
Influence of reaction temperature
During the growth process, the initial yellowish solution gradually changed color to yellow-orange, and finally became brown-black (Fig. S4 in ESI).† When the reaction temperature was set at 200 °C, the initial solution changed color to brown-black within around 30 min. And the color change occurred within 45 min or 15 min for a relatively low reaction temperature (180 °C) or high reaction temperature (>200 °C), respectively. TEM images of the as-synthesized CuInS2 NCs at different reaction temperatures are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† It can be seen that the CuInS2 NCs synthesized at 180 °C are quite small, only about 2 nm (Fig. S1A). The CuInS2 NCs become larger when synthesized at a higher temperature. The XRD patterns of the samples prepared at different temperatures (180 °C to 240 °C) for 60 min were also obtained. The XRD patterns show that the diffraction peaks of all samples can be indexed to the pure phase of CuInS2 (JCPDS No.75-0106). The diffraction peaks increase gradually with the increase in the reaction temperature, indicating the improvement of the crystallinity. It should be noted that there was a broad distribution of size presented in the reaction products when the reaction temperature was higher than 200 °C. Composition analysis by EDS shows the values of the average composition and Cu:In ratio of the CuInS2 NCs obtained at different reaction temperatures (Table 1). When synthesized at 200 °C, the Cu:In ratio and average Cu:In:S composition of CuInS2 NCs were 1:0.92 and 0.93:0.85:2.00, respectively. These values are quite close to the stoichiometric ratio of CuInS2. When synthesized at 180 °C, a much higher Cu:In ratio of 1:0.76 was obtained. When the reaction temperature was set at above 200 °C, though the Cu:In ratio and average Cu:In:S composition of NCs were close to that of CuInS2, the products had a broad size distribution. Therefore, a temperature of 200 °C was required to obtain the typical CuInS2 NCs.

Influences of reaction time
Further experiments revealed that the size of CuInS2 nanocrystals could be tuned simply by changing the reaction time. Fig. 2 shows the TEM images of CuInS2 NCs synthesized after various reaction times ranging from 30 min to 120 min with other parameters kept constant. When the solution reaction proceeded for 30 min, the particle size grew to approximately 5 nm, which was consistent with the value calculated from the XRD data. As the reaction time was prolonged to 60, 90 min and 120 min, the NCs size increased to 10, 12 nm and 17 nm respectively, while the morphology did not change. The XRD patterns of the nanocrystals isolated from the reaction mixture at 30 min, 60 min and 90 min are shown in Fig. S2.† The intensity of the diffraction peaks increased gradually with the increase in the reaction time, also indicating the growth of the CuInS2 NCs. The compositions and Cu:In ratios of CuInS2 NCs obtained in different reaction times are shown in Table 1. From Table 1, we can observe that the Cu:In ratio reduces from 1:0.77 to 1:1.01, and results to a more stoichiometric composition (0.87:0.88:2.00) of CuInS2 when the reaction time was prolonged to 120 min.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of CuInS2 NCs obtained at different reaction times is shown in Fig. 3A. The absorption spectra were measured by the liquid phase method. The CuInS2 samples were dispersed in chloroform by ultrasound for several minutes, and then the final solution was transferred to the cuvette to measure the absorption spectra. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the CuInS2 NCs synthesized at different reaction times exhibit broad absorption in the visible region, indicating a potential application in solar cells. As the time was prolonged, the absorption edge of NCs gradually shifts toward longer wavelengths. From the long wavelength extrapolation of the band edges, the band gap values for all of the obtained NCs were determined to be 1.83 eV, 1.75 eV, 1.72 eV and 1.58 eV corresponding to 30, 60, 90 and 120 min respectively. Semiconductor NCs possessing several nanometer diameters, which are termed quantum dots, show a widening of their optical energy band gap upon decreasing their crystal size because of the quantum size effect, etc., the optical absorption is adjustable by control of their crystal size.28,29 The relationship between the diameter and band gap of the CuInS2 NCs was also studied. The evolution of the band gap and size of the NCs with different reaction times is shown in Fig. 3B. As the reaction time is prolonged, the size of CuInS2 NCs gradually increased from ∼5 nm to ∼17 nm, while the absorption edge of CuInS2 NCs gradually shifted toward longer wavelengths. The band gaps were obtained by plotting (Ahν)2 as a function of hν (A = absorbance, h = Planck's constant and ν = frequency), and the band gap value of the NCs gradually decreased from 1.83 eV to 1.58 eV. This phenomenon and result are similar to the report described in the literature,28 and it also suggests that the band gap of the CuInS2 NCs could be simply adjusted by changing their size.

To study the electrical properties of the CuInS2 NCs, simple PV devices were fabricated with CuInS2 NCs prepared with different reaction times. The device structure is shown in the right corner of Fig. 5A. The typical I–V curve of the CuInS2 films fabricated with the as-prepared CuInS2 NCs is shown in Fig. 5A. As shown in Fig. 5A, the electronic transport properties of CuInS2 NCs increase with the growth time (sizes of CuInS2 NCs), while the reason is unknown. The surface photovoltage technique is an effective way to study the process of photoinduced charge separation and transfer in the surface and interface. The CuInS2 films were fabricated on FTO glass by the drop-casting method using a solution of CuInS2 NCs prepared with different reaction times. After casting, the CuInS2 films were dried at 200 °C for 2 min in atmosphere without further annealing. The surface photovoltage spectra of the CuInS2 films show significant surface photovoltage effects between 400 nm and 600 nm (Fig. 5B). We can see that the surface photovoltage effect is improved by nearly 1 order of magnitude when the reaction time was prolonged from 60 min to 120 min (Fig. 5B). This result indicates the potential of photocurrent generation, and thus great potential use of CuInS2 NCs in solar cells.

Influence of Sn(acac)2Cl2
As a surface ligand, Sn(acac)2Cl2 was expected to have a great effect on the nucleation and growth of the final CuInS2 NCs. So, CuInS2 NCs were prepared in the presence of different amounts of Sn(acac)2Cl2 to investigate the influence of Sn(acac)2Cl2 concentrations on the formation of final NCs with different morphology, monodispersity, optical and electrical properties. Here, the influence of Sn(acac)2Cl2 concentrations in the range of 0–0.2 mmol was studied. Fig. 2 shows the TEM of CuInS2 NCs synthesized with different concentrations of Sn(acac)2Cl2. From Fig. 2A, we can see that the size distribution of CuInS2 NCs is not uniform without the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2. The different shapes of nanocrystals appear to be desultory and lots of lute-like CuInS2 NCs are observed. When 0.05 mmol of Sn(acac)2Cl2 was added, the lute-like CuInS2 NCs disappeared, while the NCs started to aggregate and flower-like aggregations appeared (Fig. 2B). When a higher concentration of Sn(acac)2Cl2 (0.1 mmol) was used, monodisperse CuInS2 NCs obtained (Fig.2C), and the shape of the CuInS2 NCs changed to polygons. EDS measurements revealed that the CuInS2 NCs prepared without the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 were copper-rich (Cu:In ratio was 1:0.81) (Table 1). When 0.1 mmol Sn(acac)2Cl2 was used as the inorganic ligand, a decrease in the Cu component was observed (Cu:In ratio was 1:0.92). This result demonstrates that the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 can enhance the In:Cu ratio. It also means Sn(acac)2Cl2 can improve the chemical composition for CuInS2 NCs. The typical XRD patterns of all as-synthesized CuInS2 NCs with different concentration of Sn(acac)2Cl2 are shown in Fig. S2.† The XRD patterns clearly reveal that all diffraction peaks match well with the chalcopyrite CuInS2 (JCPDS No. 75-0106) and no obvious peaks resulting from impurities are observed. As the amount of Sn(acac)2Cl2 increased, the major diffraction peaks of CuInS2 NCs become narrow and sharp, which means the crystallinity of CuInS2 NCs was improved by the addition of Sn(acac)2Cl2. However, when the addition of Sn(acac)2Cl2 was increased to 0.2 mmol, the as-synthesized samples were tuned to be SnS [Fig. S2(f)]. We assumed that at a relatively low concentration, Sn(acac)2Cl2 may preferentially be absorbed on some faces with a higher density of surface atoms, and the growth along this face could be restricted.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of CuInS2 NCs prepared in the presence of different amounts of Sn(acac)2Cl2 are shown in Fig. S3A. Compared with CuInS2 NCs prepared without Sn(acac)2Cl2, the CuInS2 NCs synthesized with Sn(acac)2Cl2 show a broader absorption in the visible region. When 0.1 mmol Sn(acac)2Cl2 was used, the broadest absorption in the visible region is observed. The corresponding band gaps of CuInS2 NCs are shown in the inset of Fig. S3A. From the long wavelength extrapolation of the band edge, the values of the band gaps for CuInS2 NCs prepared by different amounts of Sn(acac)2Cl2 were determined to be 2.10, 1.98 and 1.72 eV, respectively. CuInS2 NCs prepared with 0.1 mmol Sn(acac)2Cl2 show a more desirable direct band gap for solar cells.
In order to further investigate the ligand effect related to Sn(acac)2Cl2 and evaluate the potential device applications with such CuInS2 NCs, we studied the I–V characteristics and surface photovoltage effects of CuInS2 NCs prepared with and without the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2. The device structure of a simple I–V device is shown in the inset of Fig. 5A. Compared with the CuInS2 film prepared without the Sn(acac)2Cl2, the conductivity of CuInS2 film prepared with the participation of the Sn(acac)2Cl2 increases greatly. This result indicates that CuInS2 NCs prepared with Sn(acac)2Cl2 are favorable for increasing the current carrier concentration and electron transmission. In addition, the surface photovoltage effect of the CuInS2 film in the visible light range is also greatly improved by the addition of Sn(acac)2Cl2, especially in the range from 500–700 nm (Fig. 5B). Thus the CuInS2 NCs synthesized by Sn(acac)2Cl2 may have a potential application in high efficiency, yet low cost energy areas as solar harvesters. The amount of 0.1 mmol Sn(acac)2Cl2 is required to obtain the typical CuInS2 NCs. In our experiments, Sn(acac)2Cl2 might play one main role in the process: to serve as an inorganic ligand to replace the organic ligand on the surface of nanocrystals to obtain high-quality nanocrystals.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technology was also used to study the capping of Sn(acac)2Cl2. From Fig. S3B, we can see that CuInS2 NCs prepared with and without the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 both have a major mass loss event at 260–330 °C, indicating the loss of ligands exist on the surface of CuInS2 NCs. It should be noted, the CuInS2 NCs prepared with the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 has a little mass loss before 260 °C, that may contribute to the volatilization of Sn(acac)2Cl2 or Sn. The significant difference is the fact that the CuInS2 NCs prepared with the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 had a smaller amount of ligand loss (mass loss of 33%) than that of CuInS2 NCs prepared without the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2. This result indicates that Sn(acac)2Cl2 and DDT coexist on the surface of the CuInS2 NCs or some DDT is replaced by Sn(acac)2Cl2. This phenomenon leads to a reduction of organic ligands which is consistent with the result of FTIR spectra.
Growth mechanism
The photographs of solution color changes during the growth process are shown in Fig. S4.† The trend of color changes of the two solution mixtures is the same; the color of the mixed solution gradually turns from a turbid yellow to clear yellow, orange, deep red and finally a dark red, which indicates the formation of CuInS2 NCs. It should be noted that the reaction mixture was slightly turbid when Sn(acac)2Cl2 was used as the inorganic ligand for the preparation of CuInS2 NCs. On the basis of the above phenomenon, we assumed that the two different intermediate compounds may be produced during the reaction. The FTIR and XRD techniques were used to investigate the formation of the intermediate compounds (Fig. 6). From the FTIR spectra (Fig. 6A(a)) and the photographs of solution color changes (Fig. S4B), the intermediate compound produced without the addition of Sn(acac)2Cl2 may be ascribed to the CuIn(SR)x, as before.30 By comparing with the FTIR spectra of pure DDT and CuIn(SR)x, a different new intermediate compound was found [Fig. 6A(c)], we named it as CuIn(S-Sn)x. The sharp peaks at 2923 and 2857 cm−1 of this new intermediate compound may be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric methylene stretching vibration. The peaks at 2577 cm−1 and 1550–1700 cm−1 which belong to the S–H and CO stretching vibrations disappeared during the reaction. We expected that the new intermediate compound might come from the reaction between Sn(acac)2Cl2, DDT and two metal salts. The XRD pattern of the intermediate compound obtained from the solution mixture for 5 min is shown in Fig. 6B, indicating that the intermediate compound of CuIn(S-Sn)x has been formed. So we expected that the intermediate compound of CuIn(S-Sn)x formed first, and then it decomposed to form CuInS2 NCs.

(B) The X-ray diffraction pattern of the intermediate compound prepared by heating 0.1 mmol Sn(acac)2Cl2, two metal salts and excess DDT at 200 °C for 5 min. 
Based on the two different intermediate compounds, the CuInS2 NCs were obtained through two different mechanisms: Stage growth and Ostwald ripening (Fig. 7). Without the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2, some lute-like nanocrystals composed of “head” and “tail” are observed (Fig. 4A). From the TEM images of CuInS2 NCs, we can see clearly that the lute-like nanocrystals have “tails” with different lengths, and some NCs have no “tail”. Based on the different lengths of “tail”, we assume that the lute-like nanocrystals grow through a stage growth mechanism. At first, a “head” segment grows, then a “tail” segment grows along the “head” segment as the growth continues. Finally, lute-like CuInS2 NCs with different lengths of “tail” were obtained (Fig. S5).† From the HRTEM image of single lute-like nanocrystals, we can discover the obvious bottleneck of the lute-like NCs, which indicates the stage growth of NCs like before.12,31 When Sn(acac)2Cl2 (0.1 mmol) was added, the shape of CuInS2 NCs changed to polygons. The time-dependent evolution of morphology was studied by TEM, which is shown in Fig. 2. From the TEM image, we can see clearly that NCs become large as the time is prolonged. We believe that the formation of polygon CuInS2 NCs could be rationally expressed as a kinetically controlled nucleation mechanism, Ostwald ripening mechanism.32 Cu(acac)2, In(acac)3, Sn(acac)2Cl2 and DDT initially reacted to form an intermediate compound of CuIn(S-Sn)x upon heating. Then the intermediate compounds acted as precursors and decomposed into CuInS2 NCs. Compared with small NCs, the large ones have lower surface free energies. As the reaction time is prolonged, the CuInS2 NCs grew further. Based on the Ostwald ripening process, after all the precursors were consumed, CuInS2 NCs formed by dissolving the monomers from relatively smaller NCs into solution and growing them back onto larger ones with polygon shapes.

Conclusions
In summary, a facile synthetic procedure has been described for the preparation of CuInS2 NCs. XRD, FTIR, TEM, TGA, EDS, UV-Vis, I–V and SPS characterizations confirmed the structure, shape, composition, optical properties and electrical properties of CuInS2 NCs. The factors, reaction temperature, reaction time and amount of Sn(acac)2Cl2, that influence the morphology, size, monodispersity and optical properties of the CuInS2 NCs were studied in detail. The experimental results indicated that the CuInS2 NCs obtained with the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 at 200 °C had good crystallinity, monodispersity and stoichiometric composition. Sn(acac)2Cl2 not only controlled the shape but also improved the chemical composition and photoelectric response of CuInS2 NCs. The UV-Vis absorption spectra revealed that the as-prepared CuInS2 NCs had an absorption in the visible wavelength range, indicating its potential application as a solar absorber. CuInS2 nanocrystals with sizes ranging from ∼5 to ∼17 nm could be obtained, and that the optical absorption edge was adjustable by changing the reaction time. The stage growth mechanism and Ostwald ripening mechanism for CuInS2 NCs preparation without and with the participation of Sn(acac)2Cl2 had been discussed. The synthesis strategy developed in this work may be used as a general process for the synthesis of pure or doped chalcogenide NCs, and may have great potential to be applied in high efficiency, yet low cost photovoltaic areas.
