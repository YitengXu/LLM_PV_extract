    , Accepted 8th December 2020First published on 9th December 2020AbstractThe hole-transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays a critical role in achieving high photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. Although a great number of HTMs have been explored for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), only a few reported HTMs can comprehensively outperform the current state-of-the-art Spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, further understanding of the relationship between the photovoltaic performance of PSCs and the chemical structure of HTMs is imperatively needed. In this work, two novel HTMs (YT4 and YT5) have been developed for application in PSCs and the influence of the different dimensional structures of the HTMs on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was also investigated accordingly. YT5 with a larger dimensional structure possesses a lower-lying HOMO energy level, a higher hole-extraction/transport ability and conductivity, and a better film morphology. Consequently, the hybrid PSCs based on YT5 exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.34%, which is significantly higher than that of the cell employing YT4 (18.58%). Meanwhile, YT5 can also be applied in all-inorganic PSC, which shows an impressive PCE of 14.61%, outperforming that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device (13.49%). Furthermore, the long-term stability of the PSC can be enhanced for YT5 compared to that of YT4 owing to the superior hydrophobicity of YT5. These results confirm that HY5 as the HTM shows great potential for replacing Spiro-OMeTAD for application in PSCs, and also provide new important insights for further developing new HTMs with a large dimensional structure to greatly push forward the progress of PSCs.
Introduction
Developing from the dye-sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising renewable and clean solar technologies towards large-scale photovoltaic power generation, mainly due to their easy-manufacturing process, high conversion efficiency and cost-effective commercial production.1–3 In the past decade, tremendous time and effort has been devoted to improving the performance and long-term stability of PSCs, which includes the careful optimization of the perovskite components, new strategies for defect passivation in the perovskite layer and various growth techniques for high-quality perovskite thin films,4–10etc. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has dramatically skyrocketed from merely 3.8% in 2009 to a certified record 25.5% in 2020,11,12 making this the fastest-advancing alternative to commercial nano-crystalline silicon-based solar cells to date.
Currently, the most efficient PSC device configuration is the sandwich p–i–n junction with an n-type electron transport material/perovskite/p-type hole transport material (HTM) structure, where the HTM is of great importance for achieving high device performance and long-term stability because it can not only effectively transport the photogenerated holes and reduce the charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface,13–17 but also act as a protective layer against moisture penetrating into the perovskite active layer.18–21 In general, an ideal HTM for highly efficient PSCs should have well-aligned energy levels with the perovskite material, acceptable hole-mobility, good solubility in organic solvents, easy accessibility with low cost and high thermal stability. Since its first report in PSCs,22Spiro-OMeTAD has been proven to be the most efficient HTM; however, its complicated lengthy synthesis makes it highly expensive, thus greatly restricting its practical commercialization. Additionally, Spiro-OMeTAD exhibits relatively poor intrinsic charge-carrier mobility, which is not favorable for charge-transfer in PSC devices. Therefore, further development of new high mobility HTMs through facile synthetic routes to substitute costly Spiro-OMeTAD is highly desirable for PSC applications. In this regard, linear organic small molecule-based alternative HTMs have been vigorously developed and utilized in PSCs with impressive conversion efficiencies.23–27 Studies have found that linear HTMs exhibit large coplanar molecular structures and high crystallinity within thin solid films, thereby easily resulting in the formation of pinholes in the HTM layer, which quickly deteriorates the performance and stability of PSCs.28–31 It is well-known that bulky organic p-type semiconductors can effectively suppress intermolecular π–π interactions and thus prevent molecular crystallization, favoring the formation of high-quality thin films. Specifically, a bulky molecular geometry is beneficial for forming a 3D charge transport network, which is conducive to improving the charge carrier transport property in organic field-effect transistors and organic photovoltaics.32,33 Inspired by the above-mentioned findings, two new HTMs (YT4 and YT5) were synthesized to investigate the effect of molecular size on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, as shown in Fig. 1. Our findings indicate that bulky YT5 with a larger molecular size is beneficial to obtain a lower-lying HOMO energy level, a higher hole-extraction/transport ability, better film morphology and superior hydrophobicity, resulting in attractive performance in PSCs.

Results and discussions
The chemical structures of YT4 and YT5 are shown in Fig. 1 and their detailed synthetic procedures and full characterization data can be found in the ESI.† Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the optimized molecular geometries. As depicted in Fig. S8,† the HTM YT5 shows a more significantly distorted spatial structure than that of YT4, which can effectively weaken the intermolecular interactions. The thermal stability of the HTMs was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis, as shown in Fig. S9.† A high decomposition temperature (Td) of up to 462 °C is observed for YT5, which is higher than that of YT4 (403 °C).34 Clearly, this result suggests that YT5 exhibits a higher intrinsic thermal stability than YT4 in the solid state, which is good for the morphological stability of the HTM applied in a PSC device.
The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of the HTMs in solution are shown in Fig. 2a. YT4 and YT5 in CH2Cl2 solution show similar absorption spectra in the range of 300–450 nm. Clearly, both HTMs exhibit weak absorption in the visible region, and thus they would not compete with the perovskite active layer for light harvesting in PSCs. Moreover, the energy bandgap (E0–0) values of YT4 and YT5 were calculated to be 2.97 eV and 2.93 eV, respectively, from the onset wavelength of the normalized absorption spectra. It is crucial to finely optimize the energy level of the HTM to match that of the perovskite material to achieve good photovoltaic performance in PSCs; in this respect, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the HTMs were estimated by differential pulsed voltammetry (DPV) measurements in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. S10†). As shown in the energy level diagram of the PSCs (Fig. 2b), the HOMO energy level of YT5 is determined to be −5.20 eV, which lies above the valence band of the perovskite material (−5.6 eV), ensuring that the perovskite-generated hole transfer at the perovskite/HTM interface is energetically favorable. Encouragingly, YT5 exhibits a slightly lower-lying HOMO level compared with that of YT4 (−5.18 eV), which can be expected to suppress photovoltage loss in the resulting YT5-based PSC device.35 Besides, the LUMO level values of YT4 and YT5 are sufficiently more positive than the conductive band of the perovskite (−3.9 eV), which suggests that they can effectively prevent the undesired electron transfer to the Au counter electrode.

The hole-transport mobility and conductivity of the two HTMs were studied by using space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) and two-contact electrical conductivity measurements, respectively.36–40 As shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1, YT5 exhibits a respectable hole mobility of 3.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is around 3 times higher than that of YT4 (1.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This result is also in good agreement with the computational study, which shows that YT5 has a significantly smaller calculated hole reorganization energy (ER) value of 48 meV in comparison with YT4 (495 meV), suggesting possibly faster hole-transport capability in YT5 solid thin-film. Moreover, the hole-conductivity of oxidized YT5 is determined to be 1.14 × 10−4 S cm−1, which is superior to that of YT4 (8.25 × 10−5 S cm−1) under the same experimental conditions. Notably, the mobility and conductivity obtained here for YT5 are slightly higher than that of the doped Spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, these results clearly indicate that bulky molecular geometry YT5 is a greatly promising candidate to work as a HTM in PSCs.

To study the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on these two HTMs, the devices were fabricated with a configuration of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/Au. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on doped YT4, YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs are shown in Fig. 3 and S11,† respectively, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The best-performing solar cell based on YT5 as a doped HTM possesses a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.76 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.13 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.795, producing an impressively high PCE of 21.34% under reverse scan conditions. Under the same working conditions, the YT4-based cell exhibits a much lower PCE of 18.58% with a JSC of 23.07 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.10 V and a FF of 0.732. In comparison, the referenced Spiro-OMeTAD-based device yields a much lower PCE of 19.72% with a Jsc of 23.04 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and a FF of 0.771. In summary, YT5-based PSCs exhibits a much higher Voc and FF as compared to the YT4-based device. The relatively high Voc for the YT5-based PSC could be due to its deeper HOMO energy level alignment, as shown in Table 1. The YT5-based device exhibits significantly higher FF (0.795) compared to that of YT4 (0.732), which could be mainly attributed to its higher hole-mobility as well as conductivity and thus low series resistance in the device.41,42 The integrated photocurrent densities from the IPCE spectra (Fig. S12†) are 22.46 mA cm−2, 22.63 mA cm−2 and 22.37 mA cm−2 for YT4, YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which well match with the measured Jsc values. We further investigated the stabilized PCE at the maximum output power conditions (Fig. 3c). The PSC devices with YT4, YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM maintain a stabilized efficiency of 18.31%, 20.89% and 19.33%, respectively, without any decay after being illuminated for 200 s. In addition, the statistical efficiencies of the HTM-based devices are presented in Fig. 3d, which demonstrates highly reproducible photovoltaic performance for YT5-based PSCs, in which the average PCE value of the devices fabricated with YT5 as a HTM is higher than that of YT4 and Spiro-OMeTAD.

Possessing an appropriate HOMO energy-level, hole-mobility and conductivity of YT5 prompted us to explore its hole-transfer behavior in all-inorganic PSCs; therefore, we fabricated PSCs based on doped YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD with a device structure of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/HTMs/Au (Fig. 4a). The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4b and their relevant photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. The YT5-based solar cell shows a Jsc of 15.89 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.17 V and a FF of 0.786, yielding an encouraging PCE of 14.61%, distinctly superior to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device with a PCE of 13.49%. Moreover, the integrated current densities estimated from the IPCE spectra presented in Fig. 4c are 15.56 mA cm−2 and 14.95 mA cm−2 for YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which is consistent with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. Fig. 4d shows that the stable efficiency outputs of YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD are 14.18% and 12.78%, respectively.

In order to investigate the morphology of the HTM film, top-down scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 5a, when YT4 is deposited onto the perovskite surface, some large particles can be detected on the film. Noticeably, YT5 produces extraordinarily homogeneous HTM capping layer without any observable particles, which means that YT5 can prevent aggregation and crystallization and exhibit an improved distribution, providing a smoother HTM surface. These results here reveal that a bulky structured HTM is beneficial for the formation of a uniform morphology. Moreover, the control Spiro-OMeTAD-based film is also slightly less homogeneous than that of YT5, which results in more efficient hole transfer in the YT5-based PSC device. Therefore, the superior photovoltaic performance of the YT5-based cell may be originated from its smooth HTM thin film. To evaluate the hole-transfer property of the HTMs at the perovskite/HTM interface, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL), as illustrated in Fig. 5b. The PL intensity of the neat perovskite was significantly decreased when YT4 and YT5 were spin-coated onto the top of the perovskite film. It is noted that a slightly more pronounced PL quenching was observed within the perovskite/YT5 film with respect to the perovskite/YT4 and perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD films, which suggests that the hole transfer at the interfaces is more efficient with a YT5-based HTM. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement was conducted to further investigate the charge carrier dynamics, as shown in Fig. 5c. The PL decay lifetime of 16.12 ns for perovskite/YT5 is shortened compared with that of perovskite/YT4 (22.48 ns) and perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD (20.05 ns), confirming a faster charge transfer at the perovskite/YT5 interface. Correspondingly, the excellent hole transport ability of YT5 contributes significantly to the PSCs photovoltaic performance. To gain insight into the internal recombination properties of the charge-carrier in the studied PSCs, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed. Fig. 5d shows the TPV curves of the PSCs based on YT4, YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD. It is found that the YT5-based PSCs exhibit a longer decay life-time of the charge-carriers (68.32 ns) compared to the devices based on YT4 (46.14 ns) and Spiro-OMeTAD (56.08 ns), indicating that the PSC device with YT5 has more efficient charge extraction/transfer and a lower charge recombination rate,19,43,44 contributing to a higher Voc for the device based on YT5 recorded by J–V measurements.

To investigate the long-term stability of PSCs based on different HTMs, aging tests were measured for 1000 hours at room temperature. As presented in Fig. 6a, the hybrid PSC based on YT5 retains 93% of its original PCE value after storage in a gloves box (filled with N2) for 800 h without any encapsulation, whereas the PCE of the YT4-based device degrades to about 78% under the same working conditions. Subsequently, when these devices were stored in air with a relative humidity of 40%, the YT5-based solar cell maintained 90% of the initial PCE after 200 h, whereas that of YT4 dropped to 69%. Moreover, the YT5-based cell can retain over 79% of its initial PCE after 1000 h under continuous illumination (100 mW cm−2), while the YT4-based cell showed a continuous efficiency decrease to 56% (Fig. 6b). It can be concluded that the YT5-based solar cell exhibits significantly better long-term device stability than that of YT4. The hydrophobicity of the HTM film is highly important for the long-term stability of PSCs, because it can effectively protect the perovskite material against degradation in humidity. As shown in Fig. 6c, YT4 and YT5 exhibit measured water contact angles of 84° and 106°, respectively. Thus, the superior hydrophobicity of YT5 is greatly beneficial for improving the long-term stability of PSCs. Therefore, the utilization of a bulky organic semiconductor as a HTL provides a promising solution to enhance the long-term durability of PSCs.

In conclusion, we have successfully designed and synthesized two new hole-transporting materials (YT4 and YT5) with different dimensional structures for perovskite solar cells. YT5 presents a highly distorted molecular structure, which can effectively suppress the crystallization of the HTM. Compared to YT4, YT5 shows a deeper HOMO energy level, better HTM film-forming ability and higher hole-extraction/transport ability as well as superior hydrophobicity. As a result, hybrid PSC devices based on YT5 achieve a very impressive PCE of 21.34%, which is much higher than the PCE of 18.58% from YT4-based control devices. Importantly, the YT5-based PSCs without encapsulation exhibit better long-term stability than YT4 after 1000 h. Moreover, all-inorganic PSCs fabricated with YT5 show a PCE value of 14.61%, which is higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (13.49%). The excellent photovoltaic performance provides new insights into further designing HTMs with large dimensional structures for highly efficient and stable PSCs in the future.
