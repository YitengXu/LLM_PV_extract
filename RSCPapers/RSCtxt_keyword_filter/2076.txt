    , Accepted 10th February 2021First published on 10th February 2021AbstractAll polymer solar cells (APSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique advantages such as flexibility and mechanical stability. However, their poor charge mobility and difficulty in accurately optimizing phase separation structures have limited their performance improvement. Here, we achieved a multilength scale morphology control of the molecular local orientation and component distribution of the J51:N2200 blend by adding a volatilizable solid additive Bipy to the blend. Since Bipy was more compatible with J51 than N2200, J51 could be enriched on the bottom surface. During thermal annealing, with evaporation of Bipy across the thin thickness direction, Bipy has more chance to contact N2200. The repulsive force between Bipy and NDI2OD units of N2200 enhanced the chain planarity of N2200 and the connectivity between crystalline lamellae. This dual role of Bipy in J51:N2200 contributes to increases of the charge mobility and more balanced charge transfer simultaneously. Meanwhile, the rate of charge recombination decreases and charge extraction increases which result in an efficient PCE of 8.73%.
Introduction
All polymer solar cells (APSCs) have attracted much attention for their special advantages such as solution treatment, large-area preparation, flexibility and excellent thermal and mechanical stability.1–4 This field has been driven by the design and synthesis of new materials.5–8 Most remarkably, the Cao group recently reported 15.11% PCE, and used a Y5-derived polymer as an acceptor with the strategy of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs).9 Although good PCEs have been achieved, due to the difficulty in controlling the phase separation structure and the low charge mobility, there is a considerable development imbalance between understanding their working mechanism and designing new materials.10–13 The construction of the structure–property relationship is still the focus of the study of APSCs.14–16
Charge transport in organic semiconductors is a multi-length-scale process from the molecular to macro-scale,17,18 which is attributed to the feature of semi-crystalline conjugated polymers19 and the working scope of devices in organic field-effect transistors (a few nanometers between the interface layer and the active layer)20 or organic solar cells (the film is about 100 nm thick).21 It is important to understand the charge transfer process at each scale. The torsion angle between the monomer units of the molecular chain determines the degree of electronic coupling in the chain and the chain coplanarity. The twisted-free chain can promote intra-chain transfer.22,23 The crystalline stacking in aggregates or crystallites affects the difficulty of the charge hopping along the chain, and a good π–π stacking provides more possibilities for local charge hopping between chains.24,25 In addition, the adequate connectivity between crystals softens the crystal boundary and reduces the charge transfer barrier, providing sufficient guarantee for charge transport on a device scale.26,27
The active layer of APSCs is composed of donor and acceptor polymers, and its morphology is an important factor to determine the device performance.28 It can be manipulated by changing the molecular properties (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, regioregularity, backbone and side-chain structure, etc.),29 solvent additives,30,31 and post-deposition treatments (solvent vapor annealing, thermal annealing, etc.).32 In an ideal BHJ morphology, donor and acceptor components form domains on the 10–20 nm scale that are sufficiently interconnected to create charge transport pathways to the electrodes. It is difficult to construct a bicontinuous network structure because the different interaction energies of polymers can lead to gradient differences of components along the longitudinal direction of the film during solution casting.33,34 The difference in the vertical phase separation structure caused by the composition distribution directly affects both the interface area and phase purity, resulting in a competition between exciton separation and charge transport.35,36 Therefore, controlling over composition distribution and ensuring sufficient charge transport on the multiscale are the key to the construction of an ideal morphology for improving the device performance.
In this work, we elaborately selected a volatile solid additive of Bipy to regulate the component distribution of the J51:N2200 blend in the vertical direction and N2200 local chain orientation, attempting to build a structure–morphology–performance relationship. The addition of a trace amount of Bipy significantly changed the photovoltaic performances, and both Voc and FF increased. At the micro scale, Bipy increased the coplanarity of the N2200 chain, improving the connectivity of crystallizing lamellae. It promoted the charge transport between crystals. Furthermore, at the macro scale, J51 domains were enriched on the substrate, while N2200 domains were more located on the surface, forming the optimal vertical separation structure for conventional device structures. This structure improved the phase purity of the donor and acceptor, providing guarantee for charge transport on a domain scale. The multi-scale structure optimization promoted charge transport and reduced charge recombination, helping us to have a deeper insight into the structure–property relationships of organic solar cells.
Experimental section
Materials
The number average molecular weight of poly{4,8-bis(5-(2-hexyldecyl)-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-octyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]trazole} (J51) and poly{(N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenedicarboximide-2,6-diyl)-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200) was 23 kDa (PDI = 2.1) and 110 kDa (PDI = 2.0), respectively. They were obtained from Solar and Derthon company. 4,4′-Bipyridine (Bipy) was acquired from Macklin company. Chloroform solvent was bought from Beijing Chemical Plant.
Device fabrication
The conventional structure was used in devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag). The ITO substrates were sonicated by isopropanol, water, acetone, and isopropanol, respectively. Then, the ITO surfaces were treated with UV ozone for 25 min. Then, PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated for 40 s on the ITO substrate at 3000 rpm. The active layers were fabricated by spin-coating a chloroform solution (9 mg ml−1) on the PEDOT:PSS-based ITO substrates, and the weight ratio between J51 and N2200 was 2:1. The content of Bipy added was 0.75 wt% of N2200 weight. The films whose thickness is nearly 100 nm were treated with thermal annealing (130 °C for 10 min). Finally, PFN-Br (5 nm) and Ag (95 nm) were deposited below 1 × 10−4 Pa atmospheric pressure. The effective device area was 0.04 cm2.
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) was adopted to calculate the carrier mobility. The structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag were used to obtain the hole-only and electron-only mobility, respectively. Nearly 100 nm films were annealed at 130 °C and held for 10 min. The SCLC devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 SMU to get current–voltage (J–V) curves under dark conditions and in a nitrogen glove box. The Mott–Gurney formula was utilized to get the carrier mobility (eqn (1)): (1)here J, ε0, εr, μ, d, and V are the current density, the free space and relative permittivity, the zero-field mobility, the thickness of films, and the effective voltage (V = Vapplied − Vbi − Vseries), respectively.
Characterization
Atomic force microscopy (SPI 3800N) was used to characterize the surface morphology of the film. The morphology of the Bipy pure film was tested using an optical profiler (ContourGT). The TGA plots were acquired using TGA Q50. The heating rate is 10 °C min−1. A goniometer (DO3021 Mk1) was utilized to measure the water contact angles (WCAs). Using an AvaSpec-3648 spectrometer the UV-vis absorption spectra were tested. A plasma etching machine (Diener ZEPTO Plasma) etched the film's surface gradually under low-pressure oxygen, using a UV-vis spectrometer to monitor light absorption after plasma etching to get the film-depth-dependent light absorption spectra. IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ALPHA. The thin film crystallinity was investigated by two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D GIXRD), and the two-dimensional GIXRD images were tested at the BL14B beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) (λ = 1.24 Å) and 1W1A beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) (λ = 1.54 Å). The incidence angle is 0.16°. The exposure time of samples is 100 s. The J–V curves of the devices were tested in a nitrogen glove box, and the light intensity is AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The QE-R 3011 instrument (Enli Tech. Co) was used for obtaining EQE curves in an ambient atmosphere.
Results and discussion
The basic information about materials is listed in Fig. 1a–e. The chemical structures of materials are displayed in Fig. 1a, where J51, N2200, and Bipy are the donor, the acceptor, and the solid additive, respectively. The normalized absorption spectra of pure components and blend films are illustrated in Fig. 1b. The J51 film exhibited an absorption region between 400 and 700 nm. The N2200 film had two feature bands, the 350–450 nm band assigned to the π–π* transition and the 500–900 nm band attributed to the charge transfer state. The absorption of two polymers was complementary. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level alignment is listed in Fig. 1c, −5.26/−3.08 eV for J51 and −5.77/−3.84 eV for N2200, providing a suitable energy level.37 The fabrication processes of the active layers containing a Bipy additive are illustrated in Fig. 1d. The active layer was prepared by dissolving a trace amount of Bipy in chloroform, and then dissolving the mixture of donor, acceptor and spin-coating solution with the solution containing Bipy. All polymer solar cells were constructed by conventional structures, as displayed in Fig. 1e.

Photovoltaic performances
The effect of Bipy and thermal annealing treatment on the photovoltaic properties of J51:N2200 devices was examined, as presented in Fig. 2. For convenient readability, the experimental conditions were labeled as follows: Blend (J51:N2200 blend without any treatment), Blend/TA (J51:N2200 blend treated with thermal annealing), Blend + Bipy (J51:N2200 blend containing a Bipy additive), and Blend + Bipy/TA (J51:N2200 blend containing Bipy and then treated with thermal annealing). The devices with the J51:N2200 blend were optimized by changing the Bipy content, as illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The corresponding parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). After the device was optimized, the content of Bipy was 0.75 wt% that of N2200 and the thermal annealing condition was 130 °C for 10 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding parameters of photovoltaic performance are summarized in Fig. 2b and Table 1. According to the results of photovoltaic performance under these four conditions, there was a significant difference in the changes between Jsc, open-circuit voltage (Voc), and FF. Thermal annealing slightly improved Jsc and FF, from 15.05 mA cm−2 (60.35%) in the Blend to 15.58 mA cm−2 (64.37%) in Blend/TA and 14.04 mA cm−2 (67.54%) in Blend + Bipy to 14.74 mA cm−2 (69.44%) in Blend + Bipy/TA, while the Voc remained unchanged. Interestingly, Voc and FF increased significantly after adding Bipy, from 0.81 V for non-Bipy to 0.85 V for with Bipy, and the FF increased from 60.35% in the Blend to 67.54% in Blend + Bipy, and 64.37% in Blend/TA to 69.44% in Blend + Bipy/TA. In contrast, the Jsc decreased from 15.05 mA cm−2 in the Blend to 14.04 mA cm−2 in Blend + Bipy, and 15.58 mA cm−2 in Blend/TA to 14.74 mA cm−2 in Blend + Bipy/TA. In general, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were 7.37% in the Blend, 8.16% in Blend/TA, 8.06% in Blend + Bipy, and 8.73% in Blend + Bipy/TA, respectively.

All the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves had a wide range of photocurrent response of 300–900 nm, and the EQE was improved in the entire absorption range in TA-based devices compared with that without TA devices. The Jsc of Blend and Blend + Bipy-based devices was 14.16 mA cm−2 and 13.63 mA cm−2, respectively, lower than those of Blend/TA (14.85 mA cm−2) and Blend + Bipy/TA devices (14.20 mA cm−2), as shown in Fig. 2c. The Jsc error between the results of J–V curves and EQE data was less than 6%.
Characteristics of charge dissociation, recombination and transport
Furthermore, we characterized the charge transport properties of J51:N2200 blend films. The characterization results are presented in Fig. 2d and Table 1, and the original data are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Both thermal annealing and Bipy could improve not only the hole mobility but also the electron mobility. The mobility reached a peak in the Blend + Bipy/TA film, with a hole mobility of 1.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 1.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ratio of hole and electron mobility gradually balanced from 2.03 in the Blend film to 1.29 in the Blend + Bipy/TA film, gradually approaching 1. The probability of exciton dissociation was explored by the corrected photocurrent (Jph) as a function of the effective applied voltage (Veff). The ratio between Jph and saturation (Jsat) expresses the probability of charge collection (P) in films.38 The P values for Blend, Blend/TA, Blend + Bipy and Blend + Bipy/TA devices were 92.79%, 94.53%, 92.89%, and 94.85%, respectively. This indicated that exciton dissociation and charge collection are more efficient in the Blend + Bipy/TA film, as presented in Fig. 2e. For tracking charge recombination of devices, the curves of Jscversus the light intensity (Plight) at various light intensities were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 2f. The relationship between them is Jsc ∝ Pαlight, here α is the exponential factor.39 These devices all have a linear relationship between Jsc and Plight, with slopes of 0.965, 0.972, 0.978, and 0.980 for Blend, Blend/TA, Blend + Bipy, and Blend + Bipy/TA, respectively. This result reflects that the Blend + Bipy/TA film could extract charge carriers efficiently and reduce bimolecular recombination than other devices.
In addition, to determine whether Bipy has the influence of universality on photovoltaic performance, the PBDB-T:N2200 blend was tested, as illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Related parameters are presented in Table S2 (ESI†). Similarly, Bipy increased the Voc and FF in devices. The Voc increased from 0.82 to 0.86 eV, and the FF increased from 60.70 to 62.92%. A slight difference was that the EQE data of PBDB-T:N2200 showed that Jsc in the Blend + Bipy/TA film was slightly improved compared with that in the Blend/TA film.
Crystallinity and phase separation structure
The impact of thermal annealing on device performance is consistent with that concluded in other research studies.40,41 However, the impact of Bipy on device performance has attracted our attention. In order to figure out why Bipy affects the performance parameters of the J51:N2200 system, we studied this system in detail, attempting to construct the relationship between the structure and performance.
Firstly, we study the nature of Bipy additives, as presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The Bipy was a crystallizable solid additive (Fig. S4a, ESI†). According to TGA plots, the thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of Bipy was about 149 °C. To approximate the actual device fabrication process, the TGA procedure was performed at 100 °C, 115 °C, and 130 °C for 1 h from 25 °C–200 °C, and the corresponding residue weight percentage of Bipy bulk was 98.4%, 62.8%, and 0.5%, respectively (Fig. S4b, ESI†). Meanwhile, the Bipy bulk was sublimated in the heating process, and then white bulk was formed at the crucible top in the cooling process, as seen in Fig. S4c (ESI†). The absorption intensity of the Bipy film at 385 nm was about 0.16, but decreased to 0 after thermal annealing (130 °C for 10 min), as shown in Fig. S4d (ESI†). The light-yellow uneven structure was observed in the Bipy film using an optical profiler but no Bipy was retained on the Si substrate after TA, as shown in Fig. S4e and f (ESI†). Hence, a drawing of the Bipy feature was constructed that Bipy was a crystallizable substance and could volatilize during thermal annealing.
The morphology of the pure film and blend film, and the corresponding heights of the films treated with different means are shown in Fig. 3a–f. The amount of Bipy was 10 wt% that of N2200. The uniform morphology in the pure J51 pristine film basically remained the same after thermal annealing, and there were some dot-like aggregation protrusions in the J51 + Bipy film, which became smoother after thermal annealing. Under these four conditions, the N2200 thin film always had a fiber bundle structure. After adding Bipy to the thin film, a lot of rough protrusion morphologies appeared, but after thermal annealing, they became relatively flat. The blend film under four conditions all had a uniform and small phase separation size. The height of both pure and blend components changed in the same trend under different conditions. In other words, the roughness of the film after thermal annealing slightly increased compared with that of the original film (4.8 nm to 5.7 nm in J51, 5.9 nm to 7.5 nm in N2200, and 4.8 nm to 5.1 nm in blend), and the roughness of the film containing Bipy was the maximum (9.9 nm in J51, 15 nm in N2200, and 5.3 nm in blend) but decreased after thermal annealing (5.2 nm in J51, 10.3 nm in N2200, and 5.1 nm in blend). Although the Bipy content (10 wt%) in these films was higher than that of the actual device, the volatilization properties of Bipy after thermal annealing could be fully verified. In Fig. S5 (ESI†), the roughness trend of the film with 0.75 wt% Bipy was the same as that of the film with 10 wt% Bipy, and the phase separation sizes of all blend films were uniform and small, indicating that the influence of Bipy on this system might occur in a smaller scale range.

To explore the effect of Bipy on the packing structure and orientation in this system, the film microstructure was comprehensively studied by GIXRD, as displayed in Fig. 4a–e, and the crystallization information of the pure film is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The linecuts for 2D GIXRD on the π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction and the lamellar (100) peak in the in-plane direction are shown in Fig. 4b. As can be seen from the figure, the (100) peak in Blend/TA and Blend + Bipy/TA had a narrower FWHM than those in other films, and the π–π stacking intensity of the Blend + Bipy/TA film was the strongest. However, most of the (100) diffraction peaks of lamellar stacking existed in the in-plane direction, and some in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that these films showed mainly face-on orientation and some showed edge-on orientation. For having a better understanding of the relative orientations, we extracted the (100) peak in the diffraction patterns to execute an orientation analysis, as displayed in Fig. 4c.42,43 The relative proportion of each orientation was calculated by integrating areas as a function of the azimuth angle, χ.44,45 The angles of 0–45° and 135–180° (Axy) were assigned to face-on, while that of 45–135° (Az) was assigned to edge-on. The ratio of integrated areas in Axy and Az is shown in Fig. 4d. The ratio of all samples was larger than 1, indicating that face-on was a dominant orientation. The ratio of the face-on stacking population of Blend/TA and Blend + Bipy/TA films was large, and that of the stacking population of the Blend + Bipy/TA film was the largest, which was 1.54. As shown in Fig. 4e, the coherence lengths of the π–π (010) and lamellar (100) diffraction peaks were computed using the Scherrer grain-size formula. Crystallites grew along both lamellar stacking and π–π stacking directions during thermal annealing. Interestingly, the crystal growth along the lamellar stacking direction increased significantly when adding a Bipy additive, compared with other films. The coherence length of the lamellar stacking in the Blend + Bipy/TA film was quite huge (16 nm). This indicated the formation of large and coherent lamellae. As the Blend + Bipy/TA film had a larger face-on stacking population and bigger and coherent lamellae, the hopping obstacles of adjacent chains were reduced, which was conducive to the formation of a three-dimensional transport pathway.

To investigate the compatibility between Bipy and polymers, we calculated the surface energy, solubility parameter, and interaction parameter of the polymers by testing the water contact angle on the J51, N2200, and Bipy films (Fig. 5a–c), with calculation results summarized in Table 2. The different contact angles in films correspond to the different surface energies of Bipy, J51, and N2200 of 48.46 mJ m−2, 21.54 mJ m−2, and 19.19 mJ m−2, respectively. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ)46,47 was 2.76 and 3.34 for J51:Bipy and N2200:Bipy, and the interfacial energy between components48 was γJ51:N2200 ≈ 0.09 mN m−1, γJ51:Bipy ≈ 10.55 mN m−1, and γN2200:Bipy ≈ 12.88 mN m−1, respectively (calculated by eqn (2)). (2)

The results suggest that J51 and N2200 had good compatibility and that the immiscibility of Bipy and N2200 was stronger than that of Bipy and J51. The N2200:Bipy blend film had a stronger phase separation than the J51:Bipy blend film, which was consistent with the morphologies in Fig. 3a and b.
To gain insights into the role of Bipy in controlling the charge transport mechanisms at a smaller scale, infrared (IR) spectroscopy provided a unique perspective for exploring specific conformations and chain orientations at the molecular level. The samples were produced by spin coating the solution onto the KBr tablets. The IR spectra of the sample are shown in Fig. 6 (Fig. 6a corresponding to 1800–1000 cm−1, Fig. 6b corresponding to 1000–700 cm−1, and the original spectra are shown in Fig. S7, ESI†). No new peaks were found after thermal annealing or addition of Bipy. However, the intensity ratios of these samples differed between 1666 cm−1 (b) and 1707 cm−1 (a) in Fig. 6a, and between 729 cm−1 (d) and 790 cm−1 (c) in Fig. 6b, and their ratios and relative sums are shown in Fig. 6c. The vibration peaks of a, b, c, and d were in the N2200 fingerprint region, as shown in Fig. S7a and b (ESI†). The a and b bands on the NDI2OD unit (representing CO symmetric and antisymmetric stretching, respectively) were mainly polarized in the vertical and along the polymer chain direction. Moreover, bands c and d were localized on the T2 unit (c is CH out-of-plane and d is CS stretching) and polarized out-of- and in-the T2 local plane direction,49,50 respectively. The research on the molecular structure of N2200 has proved that the N2200 chain backbone lies preferentially parallel to the substrate, where T2 moieties remain flat on the substrate while NDI2OD unit moieties are tilted to the plane by an angle θ. The relative arrangements between NDI2OD and T2 are important to help understand the charge transport mechanism. The variation of the vibration intensity of these bands can reflect the conformation and orientation of the N2200 chain to a substrate. The ratio of IR active band intensity Rb,a = (Ib/Ia) of both Blend and Blend/TA films was around 1.7, while that of Blend + Bipy and Blend + Bipy/TA films was increased to 1.86. Moreover, Rd,c = (Id/Ic) basically remained unchanged, which was 0.27 for all films. This result indicates that Bipy might interact with NDI2OD units in N2200. The sum of Rb,a and Rd,c reflects the degree of the tilted N2200 chain towards the substrate plane. The sum of the films containing Bipy was greater than that of the film without Bipy, and the R of the Blend + Bipy/TA film was the largest, indicating that it had a preferential orientation for N2200 and the degree of molecular planarization increased. The coplanar conformation of N2200 increases the electronic coupling between chains, reducing the hopping barrier of charge between adjacent chains and promoting the charge transfer.

The film-depth-dependent absorption spectra are a powerful tool to characterize the composition gradient and crystallinity distribution51 that can help us unveil how Bipy affects the vertical phase separation structure of films. A low-pressure oxygen plasma was used to etch the film from top to bottom, gradually. Then light absorption monitoring52 was performed to obtain depth-dependent absorption spectra of the film. The intensity evolution of film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy during incremental etching of films is shown in Fig. 7a (detailed data in Fig. S8, ESI†). The intensity evolution of all samples was the same as the absorption intensity that decreased with the increase of etching depth. By fitting the line overlap for the absorption spectra of each sublayer to the neat components' spectra (Fig. S9, ESI†), the composition distribution could be obtained, as shown in Fig. 7b. The changes of curve shape show that these four blends featured similar vertical phase separation but different composition gradient. For this J51:N2200 system, donor J51 was enriched at the bottom part of the film close to the hole transport layer of PEDOT:PSS, while acceptor N2200 mainly assembled near the electron transport layer of PFN-Br. This ideal vertical phase separation structure with the donor close to the anode and the acceptor close to the cathode is beneficial for conventional photovoltaic devices, as it promotes charge transport towards respective electrodes, reduces injection barriers, and inhibits charge recombination. Additionally, this result is consistent with the difference in surface energy observed by contact angle, that is, J51 had larger surface energy and was easier to enrich in the substrate than N2200. The degree of inhomogeneous concentration distribution increased (J51 more enriched at the bottom substrate interface) after thermal annealing and the addition of Bipy. Hence, the Blend + Bipy/TA film had a most obvious vertical phase separation structure, and the content near substrates J51 and N2200 was 80% and 20%, as compared with the other blends. The peak position and intensity of the spectrum helped determine the difference in the conformation and orientation of molecular chains in different depths inside the film. The peak position of J51 in all samples had a similar depth distribution, namely, the peak red-shifted at first and then blue-shifted with the increase of etching depth, as shown in Fig. 7c. Besides, the peak position of the thermal annealing film is red-shifted more than that of the film without TA. The ratio of 0-0 and 0-1 peak intensities of J51 are shown in Fig. 7d. It is consistent with the changing trend of the peak position of the 0-0 peak for J51 that the ratio increased at first and then decreased as the etching depth increased. The ratio at 20 nm above the substrate was greater than 1 in all samples. But it was less than 1 in no thermally annealed films near the substrate interface. It is worth noting that the ratio in the thermally annealed film at a depth close to PETOT:PSS layers was 1.02 for the Blend/TA film and 1.17 for the Blend + Bipy/TA film, both greater than 1. Thermal annealing significantly changed the molecular chain conformation near the substrate and made aggregates more ordered.

Working mechanism of Bipy affecting the properties in the J51:N2200 system
Based on the properties of Bipy, the interaction analysis between components, the phase separation structure of films, photophysical properties, and charge transport mentioned before, a diagram of the relationship between the polymer molecular structure and photoelectric performance of Blend + Bipy/TA films was constructed, illustrated as shown in Fig. 8. Bipy, as a volatilizable solid additive with large surface energy, tended to accumulate at the bottom of the substrate after spin coating. During thermal annealing, the Bipy volatilized from the substrate to the surface, which affected both J51 and N2200 in the system. First, the chain of J51 near the substrate was more ordered, which was attributed to thermal annealing. Due to the poor miscibility between Bipy and N2200, the volatile force of Bipy enabled N2200 to be more enriched on the surface and J51 on the substrate. Moreover, there was a strong interaction between the NDI2OD units of N2200 and Bipy, the torsion angle of the polymer chain decreased, and the local conformation adjustment of the molecular chain enhanced the coplanarity of the chain. The more ordered J51 chain and more coplanar N2200 chain contributed to a large coherent lamella. The carrier mobility is determined by the charge transfer integrals and reorganization energy of the material. At the same time, it is also affected by the crystalline and amorphous regions of the thin film. The larger charge transfer integrals, the smaller reorganization energy and more sufficient connection between crystallized regions all contributed to a greater carrier mobility. Improving the coplanarity of the chain increased the degree of energy level splitting, enhancing the ability of charge delocalization between the acceptor and donor units in the chain. Hence, the charge transfer integrals increased. Furthermore, the more planar chain conformation promotes the interpenetration of alkyl side chains and leads to an increase in the coherence length of the (100) lamella stacking, indicating that the connection between crystallites is enhanced. Both effects lead to increased charge mobility. The vertical phase structure and chain conformation of the films changed due to the volatility of Bipy during thermal annealing. The microstructural effects on Voc have not been investigated extensively yet. The changes of photoelectric property parameters after the addition of Bipy in the system enabled us to better understand the PCE mechanism of organic solar cells. Voc is determined by the density of charge carriers at the open circuit. As is known to all, though Voc is considered to be mainly affected by the energy gap of polymers used (the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor),53 it is also dependent on interfacial area and other factors. It will be maximized when the number of electron–hole recombination pathways is minimized. As the interfacial mixed phase decreased, which was ascribed to the donor enriched in the substrate and the acceptor more located on the surface, the Jsc slightly decreased, but recombination was less likely to occur at the donor–acceptor interface, and thus establishing a steep energy gradient between pure phases facilitates charge generation and extraction.54 The Voc increased from 0.81 V to 0.85 V in our research, the Voc increased from 0.81 V to 0.85 V, in addition to the reduction of interface area resulting in an increase in the Voc by 200 meV, and the remaining increase in Voc may be attributed to the reduction of energy disorder at the interface.55 The FF was mainly determined by the charge transfer and recombination in the active layer. The low-energy disorder in the film (due to the sufficient π–π stacking and the twist-free molecular conformation of the units of the chain) improved the ability of charge transport.56 Therefore, both the FF and Voc of the Blend + Bipy/TA film increased. For the decreased short-circuit current induced by the Bipy, it may be caused by the trade-off relationship between the phase purity and interface area in the bulk-heterojunction structure. With the addition of Bipy, the phase purity increased and the interface area decreased, resulting in the number of electrons and holes may be less than that of the devices without Bipy. Although there is some consumption of short-circuit current, the final device performance improved, which is attributed to the decrease of charge recombination and increase of charge extraction.

Conclusions
In summary, adding a volatilizable solid additive 0.75 wt% Bipy to the J51:N2200 blend results in improved performance, with a PCE of 8.73%. Here, the Voc and FF increased from 0.81 V and 64.37% in control devices to 0.85 V and 69.44% in the device containing Bipy. The underlying working mechanism of the Bipy was investigated. This demonstrated that Bipy could enhance the π–π stacking of N2200 and increase the connectivity between crystalline lamellae. Besides, since the compatibility between Bipy and N2200 was weaker than that of J51, N2200 could be enriched on the top-surface during thermal annealing, which is energetically favorable to optimize the vertical phase separation, thus further resulting in better charge transport and higher charge collection efficiency in the devices. This work unveils that the molecular local orientation and optimal vertical separation structures are critical for charge transport. Understanding the correlation between the resulting microstructures and performance will provide useful guidance for the further development of photovoltaic devices.
