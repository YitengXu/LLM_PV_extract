    , Accepted 24th May 2017First published on 24th May 2017AbstractCoupling of TiO2 with rare earth (RE) metal-based upconversion particles (UCPs) is a promising strategy to develop near-infrared (NIR)-driven TiO2-based photocatalysts. This, however, requires the controlled synthesis of bright NIR-to-UV UCPs with tailored morphology, size and crystalline phase. Herein, we report a rapid, efficient and reproducible co-precipitation/microwave (MW)-assisted hydrothermal method for the preparation of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs which allows tailoring the morphology (spherical nanoparticles, microrods) and crystalline phase (cubic, hexagonal) and hence the optical response of the resulting UCPs by simply varying the MW treatment time or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) concentration. The EDTA concentration strongly affects the size of the primary UCPs during the co-precipitation step which plays a decisive role in dictating the final particle morphology in the subsequent MW-assisted hydrothermal step. Based on microscopic and XRD analyses, a model for the growth of UCPs with different morphologies has been proposed. Pure hexagonal microrods with strong upconversion (UC) photoluminescence (PL) in the UV (345 nm, 361 nm) and visible (450 nm, 475 nm) regions are obtained using MW treatment times of 30–60 min and EDTA/RE3+ molar ratios above 1.5. The UCPs@TiO2 core@shell composite photocatalysts prepared by coating anatase TiO2 on the surface of UCPs using a sol–gel method showed good photocatalytic activity under both ultraviolet (UV) and NIR light. This efficient and reproducible co-precipitation/MW-assisted approach may be considered as a step forward towards the efficient harvesting of sunlight for photochemical and photoelectrical applications based on TiO2.
Introduction
Today, the world is facing serious challenges of environmental pollution and exhaustion of available energy resources, which demand to be addressed as soon as possible through the development of effective methods for pollution control and environmental clean-up on one hand and searching for renewable energy resources on the other hand. Among the advanced oxidation methods,1–4 heterogeneous photocatalysis5–9 based on semiconductors (TiO2, ZnO, WO3) has attracted special attention due to their high photodegradation efficiency and potential for hydrogen production, low cost and the availability of various reported synthetic routes. Unfortunately, the most efficient semiconductors such as TiO2 and ZnO require high-energy UV radiation for their photoexcitation and thus only a small (∼6%) UV portion10 of the solar spectrum can be utilized for the above-mentioned applications using semiconductor-based heterogeneous photocatalysis. Thus, it is of great importance to develop new photocatalysts which are responsive to visible and IR radiation that together make about 95% of the solar spectrum.10
Various strategies such as modification of TiO2 with metals11–15 or nonmetals16–18 and combination with narrow band gap semiconductors19–23 have been tested to extend the absorption range of TiO2 to the visible region.18,24 However, until recently, little effort has been directed towards the extension of TiO2-based photocatalysis to the NIR region.25–32 A very promising strategy to develop NIR-driven TiO2-based photocatalysts is to combine heterogeneous photocatalysts such as TiO2 with UCPs such as RE metal-based crystals (NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+, for instance).25–33 The RE-based UCPs exhibit unique luminescence properties and are able to convert low-energy NIR photons into high-energy UV or visible photons through a nonlinear optical process known as photon upconversion.34 During this process, successive absorption of two or more pump photons via intermediate long-lived energy states is followed by the emission of the output radiation at a wavelength shorter than the pump wavelength.35 Thus, the UV light emitted by the UCPs upon NIR excitation33,36 can be used to activate TiO2 (ref. 25) or ZnO.26 This forms the basis of NIR-based photocatalysis.25,27,28 Moreover, the complementary UC nanostructures used in photocatalysts can be used in solar concentrators to harvest NIR sunlight and transform it into UV/visible radiation that can be absorbed by the active components inside solar cells, increasing their power conversion efficiency.37,38 However, effective utilization of the solar light needs optimization of the synthesis procedures to obtain UCPs with tailored crystal size, morphology and chemical composition, surface functionalization and thus improved optical properties.35
UCPs have been prepared using hydro(solvo)thermal,27,32,39–44 thermal decomposition,35,45,46 co-precipitation47,48 and MW-assisted methods.34,35,49–51 Each of these methods carries its own advantages and disadvantages. The hydrothermal method is widely used for the synthesis of UCPs@TiO2 photocatalysts which generally results in good crystallinity at relatively lower temperatures and fewer crystal defects. However, it often requires prolonged heating for 12 to 24 h (ref. 27, 32 and 39–44) and allows little flexibility for controlling the synthesis conditions on a short time scale (min, for instance) as well as observation of the crystals as they grow.34,35 The thermal decomposition method allows fine control of the shape and size of both simple and core@shell particles but it also suffers from disadvantages such as the use of toxic and expensive precursors, rigorous experimental conditions (high decomposition temperatures and a moisture and oxygen-free inert atmosphere) and non-dispersibility of the resulting particles in water.35 Among these methods, the MW-based approach could be considered as a promising and effective alternative for the rapid synthesis of UCPs.35,49–52 Its salient features include short synthesis time due to faster reaction kinetics, high penetrability of MWs, low thermal gradient and uniform heating.
In this study, a rapid, facile and reproducible co-precipitation/MW-assisted hydrothermal method for the preparation of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+-based UCPs is reported. The time for the synthesis is significantly reduced to 60 min or less. Since the photocatalytic activity of the UCPs/TiO2 system directly depends on the UC emission efficiency of the UCPs and since the UC emission efficiency of UCPs is strongly dependent on the morphology, size and crystalline phase,48,52,53 we monitored the evolution of the particle size, shape and crystalline phase as a function of reaction conditions, during both the co-precipitation and the MW-assisted hydrothermal steps. We also studied the role of the reaction parameters in UC efficiency of the resulting UCPs. The prepared UCPs show intense UC luminescence which is discussed with reference to the preparation conditions. To demonstrate their potential for use in NIR-driven photocatalysis, we coated the UCPs with TiO2 and the UCPs@TiO2 photocatalysts showed good photocatalytic activity under both NIR and UV radiation. Though the preparation of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs and UCPs@TiO2 materials has been reported in many studies,25,39,44,45,50,52,54 the ease and flexibility of the synthetic methodology with respect to phase and morphology control reported here are not common. In particular, we demonstrate a general relationship between the primary particle size during the co-precipitation step and its important role in dictating the final particle morphology/phase during the subsequent microwave-assisted hydrothermal step, an aspect which has remained unexplored in the literature. We show how both the particle morphology (spherical nanoparticles or microrods) and crystalline phase (cubic, hexagonal) can be easily controlled by simply varying the MW exposure time or concentration of EDTA used as a chelating agent.
Experimental
Chemicals
Rare earth oxides (Y2O3 99.9%, Yb2O3 99.9% and Tm2O3 99.9%), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TiP, 98%), sodium fluoride (NaF) and polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was obtained from Merck. Nitric acid (HNO3) and crystal violet (CV) were purchased from Qhemis (Brazil). Ethanol and 2-propanol were purchased from Panreac (Spain). All the chemicals were used as-received.
Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs
The α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 particles doped with Yb3+ and Tm3+ were prepared by a facile co-precipitation/MW-assisted hydrothermal method. To tailor their morphology and crystalline phase, the particles obtained from the co-precipitation step using EDTA47 were subjected to an efficient and rapid MW-assisted hydrothermal treatment in a microwave synthesizer system (Model Discover SP-909150, CEM Corp., USA). Firstly, rare earth nitrates (RE(NO3)3) were prepared by dissolving the corresponding oxides (1.411 g Y2O3, 2.463 g Yb2O3 and 0.0482 g Tm2O3) separately in 65% HNO3 and evaporating the solution by heating to complete dryness. The dried RE(NO3)3 powders were separately dissolved in deionized water and the stock solutions were titrated with standard EDTA solution. In a typical synthesis, 0.77 mmol of Y(NO3)3, 0.26 mmol of Yb(NO3)3 and 0.01 mmol of Tm(NO3)3 were added to 10 mL of EDTA solution (0.2 mol L−1) and kept under magnetic stirring for 1 h. Then, 16 mL NaF solution (1 mol L−1) was added dropwise to this reaction mixture and, after stirring for 1 h, the particle suspension resulting from the co-precipitation step was transferred to a 35 mL pressure vessel (CEM part no. 909036) covered with a special cap (CEM part no. 909235) provided by the manufacturer. The reaction mixture was exposed to MW radiation for 10 to 60 minutes at 190 °C (250 psi pressure, 200 W power) under magnetic stirring. The obtained UCPs were centrifuged at 9500 rpm, washed once with ethanol and twice with deionized water using centrifugation/re-suspension cycles and finally dried at room temperature under vacuum.
Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@TiO2 (UCPs@TiO2)
The NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs were coated with a rough layer of TiO2 obtained from the hydrolysis of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TiP) in ethanol in the presence or absence of PVP as a coupling agent27,39,55 according to the literature methods27,56 with modifications. In a typical synthesis, 50 mg of UCPs, previously heat-treated at 400 °C for 1.5 h in air, were dispersed in 40 mL of ethanol by sonication for 30 minutes, and then 1 g of PVP was added to it. The mixture was again subjected to sonication for 30 minutes and then transferred to a Teflon reactor, adding more ethanol (40 mL) to it. After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, 0.018 mmol of TiP was quickly added to the mixture and the reactor lid was closed to block entry of moisture into the reaction system. The mixture was kept under stirring for 24 h followed by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 minutes to collect the UCPs@amorphous-TiO2 particles. The precipitate was washed once with isopropanol and twice with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The amorphous titania shell was crystallized by calcination at 450 °C for 2 h in air.
Photocatalytic activity measurement
To test the photocatalytic activity of UCPs@TiO2 under NIR irradiation, 5 mg of the UCPs@TiO2 photocatalyst were suspended in 1 mL of deionized water and dispersed by sonication for 30 min. Then, a 1 mL aqueous solution of methylene blue (MB) or CV (both 10 ppm) was mixed with it and the dye/photocatalyst mixture was left in the dark for 24 h to attain adsorption/desorption equilibrium. The dye/photocatalyst mixture was transferred to a quartz cuvette and stirred while being irradiated with a 980 nm NIR laser at a power of 0.5 W using an optical fiber of 200 μm diameter. The temperature during the experiments was kept at 20 ± 5 °C. After certain irradiation intervals, 1 mL of the mixture was taken out and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for three minutes and the UV/visible spectrum of the supernatant was measured using a spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu). The sample aliquot was transferred back to the reaction mixture after taking its electronic spectrum. The integrated areas of the MB absorption peak (500–750 nm) or CV peak (450–700 nm) as a function of irradiation time were measured to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst under NIR irradiation.
For photocatalytic tests under UVA irradiation, 10 mg of the UCPs@TiO2 photocatalyst were suspended in 15 mL of CV solution (5 ppm) in a borosilicate vessel and kept under stirring in the dark for 5 h. Then, the dye/photocatalyst mixture was irradiated with a Lightningcure LC8 (Hamamatsu, Japan) Xe arc lamp equipped with a light guide placed at a distance of 10 cm from the sample. After exposing the sample to UVA radiation for a certain interval of time, 1 mL aliquot was collected and centrifuged and the electronic spectrum of the supernatant was taken in order to monitor the photodegradation of CV. The photocatalyst along with the supernatant was transferred back to the photoreactor after each measurement. The area under the CV absorption peak (450–700 nm) as a function of irradiation time was determined to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the samples.
Characterization techniques
The PL spectra of the UCPs were acquired using a Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (model Fluorolog-3 FL3-122) equipped with a photomultiplier tube (model R 928 P, Spex) sensitive between 250 and 850 nm. A 980 nm laser diode coupled with an optical fiber (200 μm diameter) was utilized as the excitation source. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the powder samples were obtained using a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian). The X-ray diffractograms of the powder samples were obtained with a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker) operated at 30 mA and 30 kV using Ni-filtered Cu Kα X-ray radiation (λ = 1.540 Å). The anatase crystallite size was estimated based on the broadening of the (200) diffraction peak at the 2-theta value of 48° using the Scherrer equation.57 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples were acquired using either a LEO 440 (UK) or Inspect F-50 (FEI, Netherlands) microscope equipped with an Everhart–Thornley SE detector. The samples were deposited as thin layers on monocrystalline silicon substrates, dried and then coated with a thin layer of gold or carbon using a MED 020 sputtering coating system (BAL-TEC, Liechtenstein). TEM analysis of the samples supported on holey carbon-coated copper grids was performed using a FEI TECNAI (G2F20) transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and morphology/phase control of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs
The synthesis of UCPs was carried out by a co-precipitation/MW-assisted hydrothermal method. The spherical α-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs obtained by co-precipitation in the presence of EDTA were subjected to a fast MW-assisted hydrothermal treatment in order to obtain phase-pure or mixed phase α- and β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs. Knowing that the UC efficiency of UCPs is closely related to their morphology, crystallinity and phase-purity,35 we first optimized the synthesis conditions in order to obtain nanocrystals with controlled crystal size, morphology and phase-purity and hence intense bright UC emission.
The controlled precipitation of RE3+ and size control of the resulting particles were achieved using EDTA. Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of the as-prepared UCPs from the co-precipitation step prepared using different amounts of EDTA. The mean particle size decreases and the particle size distribution becomes narrower with the increase of EDTA concentration in the reaction mixture during the co-precipitation step (Fig. 1), in agreement with literature reports.47 For example, the mean particle size is 259 ± 56 nm (where 56 is the standard deviation and represents the width of size distribution) when no EDTA is present but decreases to 91 ± 14 nm in the presence of 2 mmol of EDTA (Fig. 1f). More importantly, the size control of primary particles obtained during the co-precipitation step (Fig. 1) determines the final particle size/morphology after the subsequent MW-assisted hydrothermal step (Fig. 2). For instance, after the MW-assisted hydrothermal step, irregular tube-like particles together with some spheroidal particles are formed by the EDTA-free synthetic route (Fig. 2a) due to the uncontrolled growth of the crystals. On the other hand, regular microrods are formed using 2 mmol of EDTA (Fig. 2d). Thus, the general tendency is that with the increase in the EDTA/RE3+ molar ratio, the formation of regular rod-shaped UCPs is favoured.

The error bars in (f) equal the standard deviation around the mean size and represent the width of size distribution. 
 Fig. 2  SEM images of UCPs prepared (a) without EDTA and with (b) 1 mmol, (c) 1.5 mmol and (d) 2 mmol of EDTA during co-precipitation and after subsequent MW treatment under otherwise identical experimental conditions. The insets in (a) show the high-magnification images of the spherical particles (left) and irregular rods (right) obtained without EDTA. 
RE ions exhibit a hard Lewis acid character and high coordination number (8 or 9) and thus prefer to bind with hard Lewis bases such as N, O and F.58 Since EDTA contains both N and O donor atoms and has a strong chelation ability, RE ions form stable mononuclear chelates with EDTA.58 For example, the logarithmic stability constants (logK(RE–EDTA)) of (1:1) RE3+–EDTA complex formation for Y3+, Yb3+ and Tm3+ are 17.62, 19.25 and 18.77, respectively.59 Thus, EDTA may affect both nucleation and growth of the particles, for instance, leading to smaller particles at higher EDTA concentration during the co-precipitation step (Fig. 1). The predominant growth mechanism during hydrothermal treatment involves a dissolution–recrystallization process comprising dissolution of the mixture in the liquid phase, convective mass transfer to the growing seed and growth of the crystal.60,61 We suggest that the smaller particles obtained using higher EDTA/RE3+ molar ratios (>1.5) during the co-precipitation step undergo this dissolution–recrystallization process more readily than bigger particles, leading to the formation of larger, regular microrods. On the other hand, the larger spheroidal particles obtained using lower EDTA/RE3+ ratios (<1.5) during the co-precipitation step are difficult to dissolve and hence convert only partially into microrods. Though such phase changes and morphology evolution of NaYF4-based UCPs have already been observed,41,51,52 the mechanism for such changes and/or the role of primary particle size from the precipitation step in determining the final particle morphology/phase in the subsequent hydrothermal step, as discussed in the present article, has until now mostly remained unexplained.
While the EDTA concentration exerts a strong influence on the particle size during the co-precipitation step (that determines the particle characteristics during the hydrothermal step), the MW treatment time plays a deciding role in determining the particle size, morphology and crystalline phase during the MW-assisted hydrothermal step. The SEM images of the UCPs prepared using different MW treatment times at a fixed EDTA concentration (2 mmol) are shown in Fig. 3. Spherical particles or a mixture of spherical particles and microrods are formed using a MW treatment time of less than 30 min while pure microrods are obtained using MW treatment times longer than 30 min (Fig. 3). A similar trend has been observed for Tb3+ and Eu3+/Yb3+-doped NaYF4 crystals.43,52 The spherical particles obtained using 10 min MW treatment have a particle size of less than 100 nm (Fig. S1†) and a slight increase in particle size observed after 20 min of MW treatment could be related to the dissolution–recrystallization process occurring during the MW-assisted hydrothermal step. The microrods obtained after 60 min of MW treatment have an average length of 3.2 ± 0.2 μm and a diameter of 1 ± 0.1 μm. Again, an increase in MW treatment time allows for efficient dissolution–recrystallization to occur, leading to an increase in mean particle size of the spherical particles until they transform into microrods for a MW treatment time of more than 30 min (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Effect of MW treatment time on the morphology of UCPs under otherwise identical experimental conditions. The amount of EDTA and RE3+ ions was fixed at 2 mmol and 1 mmol, respectively. 
The increase in particle size and change in particle morphology are accompanied by a change of the crystalline structure of the UCPs. The X-ray diffractograms (Fig. 4) of the UCPs prepared using MW treatment times of less than 20 min show the diffractions peaks at 2-theta values of 28.2°, 32.7°, 46.9°, 55.8°, 58.5°, 68.6° and 75.8°, all characteristic of cubic NaYF4 (PDF no. 6-342 and 27-1428). A hexagonal phase starts to appear after 20 min of MW treatment as indicated by the appearance of diffraction peaks of β-NaYF4 at 2-theta values of 17.1°, 29.7°, 30.7° and 39.7°. However, clear diffraction peaks characteristic of only hexagonal β-NaYF4 at 2-theta values of 17.1°, 29.7°, 30.7°, 34.5°, 39.7°, 43.4°, 46.5°, 51.7° and 53.5° (PDF no. 16-334) are seen after 60 minutes of MW treatment. Knowing that β-NaYF4 is thermodynamically more stable than its cubic counterpart, the dissolution–renucleation process occurring during the MW-assisted hydrothermal treatment leads to α → β phase transition,62 especially as the MW treatment time is increased (Fig. 4). In other words, the phase transition is an Ostwald ripening-promoted process, wherein the dissolution and recrystallization are dominant.62 This controlled conversion of the crystalline phase, without particle sintering or aggregation, using mild reaction conditions is an important aspect of MW-based methods. Transformation of α-NaYF4 into the thermodynamically stable β-NaYF4 can also be affected by calcination of the α-NaYF4 particles at 600 °C (Fig. S2†). However, calcination leads to a dramatic increase in size due to sintering (Fig. S3†) and is not recommended in this case. It is important to note that well-defined crystalline particles are formed after MW treatment (Fig. 2–4).
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of UCPs prepared using different MW treatment times (indicated in min above each diffractogram) under otherwise identical experimental conditions (2 mmol of EDTA, 1 mmol of RE3+ ions). The diffractograms on the top and bottom represent the standard diffraction patterns of β-NaYF4 (PDF no. 16-334) and α-NaYF4 (PDF no. 6-342), respectively. 
Effective incorporation of Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions into the NaYF4 lattice is confirmed by EDX analysis of the samples which showed characteristic X-ray emission lines of these elements (Fig. S4†). The average elemental composition estimated from the EDX analysis of six different samples of the same nominal composition was found to be Na1.0Y1.01F4.61Yb0.26Tm0.01 corresponding to 14.4% Na, 14.5% Y, 67.0% F, 3.8% Yb and 0.13% Tm. Similarly, the average molar ratio of Y:Yb for the UCPs (0.78:0.21) roughly matches the solution ratio of these ions (0.77:0.26).
Based on the results of SEM and XRD, the mechanism for the formation of shape- and phase-controlled UCPs as a function of the experimental conditions is summarized in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the formation of spherical and rod-shaped NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs under different experimental conditions. The nuclei formed during the nucleation step grow into small (<100 nm) monodispersed nanoparticles (for EDTA/RE3+ ≥ 1.5) or large (>100 nm) polydispersed particles (for EDTA/RE3+ < 1.5) during the co-precipitation step. Through a dissolution–renucleation process, the particles transform into phase-pure α-NaYF4, β-NaYF4 or a mixture of the two phases depending the MW treatment time during the subsequent MW-assisted hydrothermal step. For a fixed MW treatment time, the small particles formed during the co-precipitation step transform more readily into microrods during the hydrothermal step as compared to the large particles. 
Upconversion (UC) emission of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs
The structural and phase changes occurring as a function of MW treatment time or EDTA concentration have a strong impact on the UC properties of the UCPs. Since hexagonal (β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+) UCPs normally show stronger UC luminescence than their cubic counterparts,63,64 any factor leading to the formation of the hexagonal phase, in general, leads to an enhancement in the UC intensity of the UCPs. For instance, the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ particles obtained just after the co-precipitation step show weak UC emission under 980 nm laser excitation (Fig. S5a†). However, a clear increase in UC intensity along with the evolution of better defined emission peaks of Tm3+ (Fig. S5b†) is seen after MW-assisted hydrothermal treatment for 60 min (due to the formation of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+). Similarly, the irregular UCPs prepared without any EDTA in the reaction mixture show a very weak PL intensity even after hydrothermal treatment as compared to the samples prepared with EDTA (Fig. S6†). Since the SEM image (Fig. 2a) shows the formation of a mixture of spheroidal particles and irregular branch-shaped or tube-like particles with no defined morphology in the absence of EDTA, the weak UC observed in these particles may be related to the presence of crystal defects that might quench their luminescence. Furthermore, XRD analysis also confirmed the lack of phase purity and the presence of both cubic and hexagonal crystals along with some other phases as impurities in these irregular particles (Fig. S7†) which may be responsible for their lower UC efficiency.64 MW-assisted hydrothermal treatment at 190 °C was found optimum for obtaining samples with desired UC properties (Fig. S8†) and further post-synthesis thermal treatment at 400 °C led to a slight increase in UC intensity (Fig. S9†) which may be attributed to a small increase in crystallinity, a decrease in crystal defects and the decomposition of the organic molecules on the surface of the particles.65,66 This shows that the UCPs prepared after MW-assisted hydrothermal treatment had good crystallinity and well-defined crystal structure (both important for efficient UC luminescence35), as confirmed by the XRD results (Fig. 4 and 6c).

Fig. 5 compares the typical UC spectra of the UCPs prepared using different MW treatment times under 980 nm laser excitation. All the samples show the characteristic Tm3+ emission peaks in the UV, blue and NIR regions centered at 290 nm (1I6 → 3H6), 345 nm (1I6 → 3F4), 361 nm (1D2 → 3H6), 450 nm (1D2 → 3F4), 475 nm (1G4 → 3H6), 580 nm (1D2 → 3H4), 650 nm (1G4 → 3F4) and 800 nm (3H4 → 3H6). In general, UC intensity increases with an increase in MW treatment time (Fig. 5) which is concomitant with the conversion of the cubic phase into a hexagonal one (Fig. 3 and 4). For instance, the spherical α-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ particles obtained using MW treatment times of less than 30 min show lower UC intensity and the UC intensity increases as the spherical shaped particles evolve into rod-shaped (β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+) particles with an increase in MW treatment time to 30 min or above. For example, the hexagonal microrods prepared using a MW treatment time of 60 min show intense UC emission in the UV region at 290 nm, 345 nm and 361 nm which is important for TiO2-based photocatalysis.
 Fig. 5  UC spectra of the UCPs prepared using different MW treatment times (in min) under otherwise identical experimental conditions. The spectra were obtained in an identical fashion using a 980 nm laser at 400 mW power. The inset shows the magnified view of the UC spectra of three samples (5 min, 10 min and 20 min). 
Preparation and characterization of NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+@TiO2 (UCPs@TiO2)
A simple sol–gel process was used to coat the UCPs with a rough layer of TiO2 using titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TiP) as the TiO2 precursor and PVP as the coupling agent.27,39,56,67 PVP is important for stabilizing the microrods in suspension and obtain effective coatings.39,67 The diffuse reflectance spectrum of the UCPs (Fig. 6a) shows a relatively broad band centered at 980 nm due to absorption by the Yb3+ ions.35 The same absorption band is observed in the spectrum of the UCPs@TiO2 particles, in addition to an absorption edge between 390–350 nm which corresponds to the absorption of TiO2. A comparison of the UC emission of the UCPs and UCPs@TiO2 clearly indicates a decreased intensity of the UC emission peaks of the latter, especially the ones located in the UV region (Fig. 6b), indicating effective coating of TiO2 on the surface of the UCPs and absorption of the UV lines (345 nm and 361 nm) by the TiO2 shell. At least two possible reasons could be given for this decrease in intensity. First, the absorption edge of TiO2 (390–350 nm) matches the UC emission lines of the UCPs at 345 nm (1I6 → 3F4) and 361 nm (1D2 → 3H6) and thus TiO2 can absorb these UV emission lines, making it possible to utilize the NIR-to-UV UC emission of the UCPs to activate TiO2 under NIR irradiation. Second, the decrease in emission intensity of UCPs@TiO2 may partly be related to the attenuation of the 980 nm laser line by the TiO2 shell which possibly leads to a decrease in the excitation light intensity arriving at the UCPs. Since the emission intensity is proportional to the nth power of the excitation intensity, the faded power density may lead to a decrease in UC emission. However, the decrease in the integrated intensity of the emission peaks of the UCPs@TiO2 sample is more pronounced in the UV region (98.5%) as compared to that in the blue region (66%) which confirms that the UV emission lines are principally absorbed by the TiO2 layer.

The X-ray diffractogram of the UCPs@TiO2 sample is compared with those of anatase TiO2 and the UCPs (Fig. 6c). While the UCPs (microrods) exhibit only diffraction peaks characteristic of the β-NaYF4 structure (PDF no. 16-334), the diffractogram of UCPs@TiO2 exhibits additional peaks at 2-theta values of 25.3°, 37.9°, 48.0° and 62.9°, all of which correspond to the anatase phase of TiO2 (PDF no. 21-1272). TiO2 thus crystallizes in the anatase phase in the UCPs@TiO2 sample. The anatase crystallite size in the UCPs@TiO2 sample is around 12 nm as estimated from the Scherrer equation.57
Detailed morphological information of the UCPs and UCPs@TiO2 samples was obtained using FEG-SEM and TEM analyses (Fig. 7). While the microrods have a hexagonal structure with smooth surfaces (Fig. 7a and c), a rough coating of TiO2 with a layered structure is clearly seen in the SEM (Fig. 7b) and TEM (Fig. 7e) images of the UCPs@TiO2 sample. In the absence of PVP, unsupported core-less titania was obtained (Fig. S10†), in agreement with the literature reports.39,67 The HRTEM image (Fig. 7f) of the TiO2 shell clearly shows the crystal planes with an interplanar distance (IPD) of 0.35 nm which corresponds to the (101) planes of anatase.68 Similarly, the SAED pattern (Fig. 7g) of the shell part of UCPs@TiO2 is typical of polynanocrystalline materials69 and shows concentric circles with their radii equal to 2.37, 8.5, 9.90, 11.18, 12.66 and 13.82 nm−1, which correspond to IPDs values of 0.365, 0.249, 0.235, 0.178, 0.157 and 0.144 nm, respectively. These values of IPDs are typical of anatase TiO2 and correspond to the (101), (103), (004), (200), (105) and (213) planes of anatase.68 The titania shell thus consists of anatase, in agreement with the XRD results (Fig. 6c).

The SAED pattern closely matches that of anatase, confirming that the titania shell consists of phase-pure anatase. 
The core@shell structure of the UCPs@TiO2 sample was further verified by elemental mapping using SEM-EDX analysis (Fig. S11†) and line-scan in TEM (Fig. S12†).
Photocatalytic activity of the UCPs@TiO2 photocatalyst
Before checking the photocatalytic activity of the UCPs@TiO2 sample under NIR light, it was important to demonstrate the activity of the TiO2 shell under UV light. The photoactivity was measured in terms of photodegradation of MB and CV. Fig. 8a shows that the intensity of the MB absorption band centred at 663 nm decreases sharply after 10 min of UV irradiation and almost complete decolourization of the MB solution (5 mg L−1, 15 mL) is observed within 12 min of irradiation (Fig. 8b). The direct photolysis of MB by UV in the absence of any photocatalyst is low (6%) as the borosilicate reactor filters the more energetic UV-C radiation. Similarly, UCPs@TiO2 shows good photocatalytic activity under UV illumination towards CV dye and around 93% of the CV dye is degraded within 1 h of illumination (Fig. S13†). Again, the direct photolysis of CV with UV light is negligible under the experimental conditions.
 Fig. 8  Temporal change in the UV/visible spectra of MB solution in the presence of UCPs and UCPs@TiO2 photocatalysts as a function of (a) UV irradiation (min) and (c) 980 nm laser irradiation (hours); decrease in area of the MB absorption peak (500–750 nm) as a function of (b) UV irradiation and (d) NIR irradiation time in the presence of UCPs and UCPs@TiO2 photocatalysts. The direct photolysis of MB in the absence of any photocatalyst by UV (b) and NIR (d) light, as well as the photocatalytic activity of the UCPs@TiO2 sample in the absence of NIR light (Fig. 8d), is also shown for comparison. 
Next, the photoactivity of the UCPs@TiO2 photocatalyst under 980 nm laser excitation was evaluated through degradation of MB solution. For comparison, photocatalytic experiments were also carried out in the absence of any photocatalyst (direct photolysis) and in the absence of NIR radiation (dark adsorption) for the UCPs@TiO2 sample. As shown in Fig. 8d, almost no photodegradation or photolysis of MB by the laser is observed in the absence of UCPs@TiO2. Also, the change in peak area of the MB peak in the presence of only UCPs under NIR irradiation or in the presence of UCPs@TiO2 in the dark (no NIR) was insignificant. However, a clear decrease in the MB absorption peak intensity (Fig. 8c) and hence peak area (Fig. 8d) is observed in the presence of UCPs@TiO2 under NIR irradiation and around 50% of the MB dye is degraded within 5 h of illumination. Similarly, the photoactivity of UCPs@TiO2 under NIR illumination was also checked by the degradation of CV dye and around 70% of the CV dye is degraded after 14 h of illumination (Fig. S14†).
The mechanism of NIR-to-UV/Vis upconversion in NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ is well established70,71 and is presented in Fig. 9 along with the mechanism for the NIR-driven photocatalytic activity of the UCPs@TiO2 photocatalyst. The NIR light (980 nm) excites only the Yb3+ ions which in turn excite a Tm3+ ion by three successive energy transfer (ET) steps from Yb3+ to Tm3+ in the NaYF4 matrix. These ET steps lead to population of the 3H5, 3F2 and 1G4 levels of Tm3+ ions.70,71 Because of the large energy difference between 1G4 and 1D2, populating the latter by an additional photon through ET is less favourable and cross-relaxation between 3F2 + 3H4 → 3H6 + 1D2 leads to population of the 1D2 level.63,70,71 Once the 1D2 level is populated, transition between the 1D2 and 1I6 levels through a fourth ET step leads to the population of the 1I6 level.71 The excited Tm3+ ion then relaxes by emission of UV light at 290, 345 and 362 nm assigned to 1I6 → 3H6, 1I6 → 3F4 and 1D2 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, respectively.71 As these emission lines overlap with the absorption edge of TiO2 (Fig. 6a), they are effectively absorbed by the TiO2 layers around the UCPs (Fig. 6b), leading to photoexcitation of the TiO2 particles in UCPs@TiO2.25,27 As a result of this photoexcitation, reductive electrons (e−) and oxidative holes (h+) are generated which take part in the photocatalytic degradation of MB and CV molecules.72 The h+ and e− actually trigger a series of reactions with molecular oxygen and water that eventually generate hydroxyl radicals (HO˙) on the surface of the semiconductor catalyst which are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and microorganisms.72
 Fig. 9  Energy level diagram and the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Tm3+ showing the proposed UC mechanism under 980 nm excitation. The photoexcitation of TiO2 by the UC emission in the UV region is also shown. 
The results shown here indicate that the UCPs@TiO2 composite photocatalyst allows better harvesting of both UV (directly through photoexcitation of TiO2) and NIR (indirectly though UC emission in the UV region by the UCPs) radiation for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and coupling of TiO2 with NIR-to-UV UCPs can be regarded as an effective strategy for the development of broad spectrum photocatalytic systems for photo(electro)chemical applications based on TiO2 and other semiconductor materials.
Conclusions
In this study, bright NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+-based upconversion particles with tailored morphology (spheres and rods) and crystalline phase (cubic and hexagonal) and intense UC emission were successfully prepared using a rapid and effective MW-assisted hydrothermal method. The primary particle size decreases with an increase in EDTA concentration during the co-precipitation step which strongly affects the final particle morphology during the subsequent hydrothermal step. The small primary particles obtained using EDTA/RE3+ ratios above 1 easily and effectively undergo a dissolution–renucleation process during the hydrothermal step leading to the formation of β-hexagonal rods while the large primary particles obtained using EDTA/RE3+ ratios below 1 partially convert into microrods and mostly crystallize as spherical particles in the cubic phase. The spherical (α-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+) UCPs undergo transformation into hexagonal (β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+) microrods with an increase in MW treatment time and the latter show strong UC luminescence in the UV and visible regions under 980 nm laser excitation. The emission in the UV region (345 nm, 361 nm) was effectively used to photoexcite anatase nanocrystals coated as a rough shell around the UCPs and the composite UCPs/TiO2 photocatalysts showed good photoactivity under both UV and NIR light as demonstrated by the photodegradation of MB and CV dyes. The method for the synthesis of UCPs reported here is fast, simple, robust and highly reproducible and has the potential to be used for the preparation of other types of UCPs for better and effective utilization of the solar energy for photochemical reactions.

 	Fig. 4  XRD patterns of UCPs prepared using different MW treatment times (indicated in min above each diffractogram) under otherwise identical experimental conditions (2 mmol of EDTA, 1 mmol of RE3+ ions). The diffractograms on the top and bottom represent the standard diffraction patterns of β-NaYF4 (PDF no. 16-334) and α-NaYF4 (PDF no. 6-342), respectively.	 

 	Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the formation of spherical and rod-shaped NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ UCPs under different experimental conditions. The nuclei formed during the nucleation step grow into small (<100 nm) monodispersed nanoparticles (for EDTA/RE3+ ≥ 1.5) or large (>100 nm) polydispersed particles (for EDTA/RE3+ < 1.5) during the co-precipitation step. Through a dissolution–renucleation process, the particles transform into phase-pure α-NaYF4, β-NaYF4 or a mixture of the two phases depending the MW treatment time during the subsequent MW-assisted hydrothermal step. For a fixed MW treatment time, the small particles formed during the co-precipitation step transform more readily into microrods during the hydrothermal step as compared to the large particles.

The SAED pattern closely matches that of anatase, confirming that the titania shell consists of phase-pure anatase.	 

 	Fig. 8  Temporal change in the UV/visible spectra of MB solution in the presence of UCPs and UCPs@TiO2 photocatalysts as a function of (a) UV irradiation (min) and (c) 980 nm laser irradiation (hours); decrease in area of the MB absorption peak (500–750 nm) as a function of (b) UV irradiation and (d) NIR irradiation time in the presence of UCPs and UCPs@TiO2 photocatalysts. The direct photolysis of MB in the absence of any photocatalyst by UV (b) and NIR (d) light, as well as the photocatalytic activity of the UCPs@TiO2 sample in the absence of NIR light (Fig. 8d), is also shown for comparison.	 

 	Fig. 9  Energy level diagram and the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Tm3+ showing the proposed UC mechanism under 980 nm excitation. The photoexcitation of TiO2 by the UC emission in the UV region is also shown.
