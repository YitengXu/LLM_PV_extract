Broader context
Fullerenes have been dominant electron acceptors for solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs), a cost-effective alternative for utilizing solar energy; but some shortcomings of fullerenes, such as weak absorption in the visible spectral region and limited energy level variability, hinder the development of PSCs. Thus, novel alternative electron acceptor materials with strong and broad absorption spectra and appropriate energy levels are necessary for PSCs. So far, PSCs based on nonfullerene acceptors have afforded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5–6% after post-treatments. Here, a nonfullerene electron acceptor (IEIC) based on indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile was designed and synthesized. IEIC exhibited good thermal stability, strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region with an extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 672 nm, deep LUMO energy level (−3.82 eV) close to those of fullerenes, and a relatively high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fullerene-free PSCs based on the blends of the IEIC acceptor and a low-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-TH, using a perylene diimide derivative as a cathode interlayer, showed PCEs of up to 6.31%, which is among the best PCEs reported for fullerene-free PSCs.

1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ)1 structures fabricated by simple solution-processing techniques are a cost-effective alternative for utilizing solar energy, and possess advantages such as low-cost, light-weight, and flexibility.2,3 In the past years, much effort was focused on developing novel narrow-bandgap electron donor polymers, and PSCs exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 9–10%.4–6 On the other hand, electron acceptors are important as electron donors for high-performance solar cells, and lagged far behind donor materials.7–9 Fullerenes and their derivatives are the main electron acceptors in PSCs, because they possess chemical properties that promote unmatched efficiencies for exciton dissociation and electron transport.10,11 However, fullerenes have a few disadvantages, such as restricted electronic tuning and weak absorption in the visible region. Thus, novel alternative electron acceptor materials with strong and broad absorption spectra and appropriate energy levels are necessary for PSCs.
Considerable efforts have been dedicated to the development of photovoltaic nonfullerene acceptors containing electron-withdrawing building blocks exemplified by cyano,12–14 imide,15–33 amide,34–36 benzothiadiazole,37–41etc. So far most of the fullerene-free PSCs have exhibited PCEs <4%.7,8,42,43 Rylene diimide-based acceptors such as perylene diimide and naphthalene diimide small molecules and polymers are the most successful for fullerene-free PSCs. Very recently, PSCs based on several rylene diimide-based acceptors afforded PCEs of >5% after post-treatments.44–48 To achieve higher efficiencies comparable to those of fullerene-based devices, more novel nonfullerene acceptors should be explored.
In this paper, a nonfullerene electron acceptor (IEIC, Scheme 1) was designed and synthesized. IEIC has a bulky indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core end-capped with electron-withdrawing 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (INCN) groups. IEIC exhibited a strong and broad absorption spectrum with a narrow bandgap, low energy levels matched with some typical narrow-bandgap donor polymers, and good electron mobility. PSCs based on a blend of a narrow-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-TH6 (Scheme 1) and IEIC acceptor showed PCEs of up to 6.31%, which is the highest PCE reported for PSCs based on small molecule nonfullerene electron acceptors, and among the best results reported for fullerene-free solar cells.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material synthesis and characterization
IEIC was synthesized via facile reactions (Scheme 1). The intermediate compound IE-CHO was synthesized in 70% yield through the Stille coupling reaction between compounds 1 and 2 using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. A straightforward reaction of IE-CHO with compound 3 afforded IEIC in 80% yield. The compounds IE-CHO and IEIC were fully characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis. IEIC was readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature, because of its solubilizing alkyl substituents. The thermal properties of IEIC were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This compound exhibited good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 324 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). The DSC heating trace for this compound showed a melting peak at 132 °C, suggesting that IEIC is crystalline (Fig. S2, ESI†). The out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the IEIC film showed no obvious reflection peak (Fig. S3, ESI†), suggesting that the crystallinity of IEIC may be weak.
The dichloromethane solution (10−6 M) of IEIC exhibited strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region with a maximum extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 672 nm (Fig. 1a). Relative to its solution, absorption of the IEIC film exhibited a significant red shift of ca. 50 nm and a strong shoulder peak, suggesting that there was some molecular self-organization in the film. The strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region was beneficial to utilizing the solar energy, because the solar spectra have the maximum photon stream density at 700 nm. The absorption edge of the IEIC thin film was 790 nm, thus the optical bandgap was estimated to be 1.57 eV.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the IEIC film and further estimate its energy levels. In Fig. 1b, IEIC exhibited irreversible reduction and quasireversible oxidation waves, and the onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus FeCp2+/0 (0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl) were 0.62 and −0.98 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.42 and −3.82 eV from the onset potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum. Meanwhile, the energy gap (1.60 eV) calculated from CV was similar to its optical bandgap (1.57 eV). The LUMO energy level (−3.82 eV) from CV of IEIC was close to those (e.g. −3.9 eV for PC61BM)11 of fullerenes, and can match most typical donor materials for PSCs.
In addition to energy levels, good electron transport properties are another key factor for efficient acceptor materials. The electron mobility of IEIC was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of Al/IEIC/Al (Fig. S4, ESI†). The IEIC film exhibited a relatively good electron mobility of up to 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the average value for 10 devices was 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Such an electron mobility was close to those (ca. 10−4 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) of fullerene derivatives,11 and met a basic requirement for effective electron acceptors, to ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and to reduce the photocurrent loss in solar cells.
2.2. Energy levels and PL spectra of PTB7-TH and IEIC
From energy levels and electron transport properties, IEIC could be a promising electron acceptor for PSCs. To test the photovoltaic properties of IEIC, a suitable polymer donor should be first chosen. Recently, PTB7-TH based on benzodithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene units was explored and exhibited excellent photovoltaic properties.6 PTB7-TH had a LUMO of −3.59 eV and a HOMO of −5.20 eV, calculated by the CV method (Fig. 1b), 0.22–0.23 eV higher than those of IEIC. However, such a LUMO gap and HOMO gap between PTB7-TH and IEIC calculated from CV results were lower than the empirical value of 0.3 eV required for efficient exciton dissociation.49 Thus, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to measure the energy levels of PTB7-TH and IEIC (Fig. 1c). HOMO levels of PTB7-TH and IEIC were calculated to be −4.95 and −5.61 eV, respectively. LUMO levels of PTB7-TH and IEIC were −3.35 and −4.04 eV, respectively, calculated from the optical bandgaps (1.6 eV for PTB7-TH, Fig. S5, ESI;† 1.57 eV for IEIC) and HOMO levels. The LUMO gap between PTB7-TH and IEIC was 0.59 eV, which was large enough for efficient exciton dissociation.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 1d) showed that blending PTB7-TH with IEIC led to >95% fluorescence quenching of PTB7-TH and IEIC, indicating that effective photoinduced charge transfer occurred between PTB7-TH and IEIC in the blended film and almost all excitons dissociated. This effective photoinduced charge transfer was beneficial to producing a high short circuit current density (JSC) in solar cells.
2.3. Morphology and charge transport of the PTB7-TH:IEIC blended film
The surface morphology of the PTB7-TH:IEIC (1:1.5, w/w) blended film was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2a and b). PTB7-TH and IEIC had favorable miscibility with each other, and the PTB7-TH:IEIC blended film showed a relatively smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.05 nm (Fig. 2c) and nearly uniform crystalline grains with sizes of 20–30 nm estimated by cross-section profiles (Fig. 2d), which approach the exciton diffusion length in organic materials. The XRD pattern of the PTB7-TH:IEIC blended film exhibited no obvious reflection peak owing to its weak crystallinity (Fig. S3, ESI†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the internal structure of the PTB7-TH:IEIC blended film; the TEM image shows a nanoscale interpenetrating structure (Fig. S6, ESI†). This smooth surface and nanoscale interpenetrating morphology led to efficient charge transfer between PTB7-TH and IEIC as seen in PL spectra.

We used the SCLC method with sandwich device structures to measure the hole and electron mobility in the vertical direction of the PTB7-TH:IEIC blended film (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). The average hole and electron mobilities for >10 devices were 4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The balanced and relatively good charge transport properties facilitated charge collection.
2.4. PSCs based on the PTB7-TH:IEIC blended film
These results on photonic, electronic and morphological investigations of the PTB7-TH:IEIC blended film along with low energy levels and good vertical electron mobility of IEIC suggested the potential applications of IEIC in PSCs as an electron acceptor and the PTB7-TH:IEIC BHJ film could exhibit promising photovoltaic performance. Thus we blended IEIC and PTB7-TH, and fabricated BHJ PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-TH:IEIC/Ca/Al. Table 1 summarizes the open circuit voltage (VOC), JSC, fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices at different donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios and using Ca/Al as cathodes. These devices yielded relatively high VOC as we expected; the high VOC resulted from the gap as large as 1.38 eV between the LUMO of IEIC and the HOMO of PTB7-TH. The VOC values increased slightly from 0.91 V to 0.94 V with the increasing acceptor content in the BHJ film. The blended film at a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5 gave the best performance: a VOC of 0.93 V, a JSC of 12.24 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.46 and a PCE of 5.24% (Fig. 3a). Most of the high-performance PSCs and almost all efficient fullerene-free devices need to optimize the active layer morphology by several post-treatment methods, such as thermal annealing, solvent annealing and solvent addition. It is worth noting that this novel system based on the PTB7-TH:IEIC blend did not need any post-treatment, which is an advantage for economical large-scale production. A PCE of 5.24% is one of the best values reported for fullerene-free organic solar cells without post-treatments.

In the previous work,50 an amino-substituted perylene diimide (PDIN, Scheme 1) was used in PSCs as a cathode interlayer51,52 and the PDIN interlayer significantly improved the device performance relative to the calcium interlayer. Thus we introduced the PDIN interlayer into fullerene-free PSCs based on the PTB7-TH:IEIC blend. The PDIN layer increased the PCE up to 6.31%, with an average value of 6.08% for 20 devices. The PDIN-based devices exhibited a higher VOC of 0.97 V and a higher JSC of 13.55 mA cm−2 relative to the Ca-based counterparts (Fig. 3a). An excellent PCE of 6.31% is the highest reported value for PSCs based on small molecule nonfullerene electron acceptors, and one of the best results reported for fullerene-free solar cells. Furthermore, we investigated the initial stability of the best device under continuous AM1.5G illumination. After continuous AM1.5G illumination for 17 h, the PCE of the device decreased by ca. 17%, and then remained almost stable (Fig. S9, ESI†).
The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs based on the blended film with a Ca or PDIN cathode interlayer are shown in Fig. 3b. These blended films showed broad IPCE plateau spectra from 450 to 800 nm. The PSCs based on Ca/Al or PDIN/Al showed a maximum IPCE of 55% and 57%, respectively. To evaluate the accuracy of the photovoltaic results, the JSC values were calculated from the integration of the IPCE spectra. The calculated average JSC was 11.67 and 12.73 mA cm−2 for the devices based on the Ca/Al and PDIN/Al top electrode, which had a 0.7% and 2.5% mismatch with those measured by J–V measurements, respectively.
3. Conclusions
An electron acceptor (IEIC) with an IDT core end-capped with INCN units was explored. IEIC exhibited a strong and broad absorption in the visible and even NIR regions, and appropriate energy levels matched with several typical low-bandgap electron-donating polymers like PTB7-TH, relatively high electron mobility, and good miscibility with polymer donors. PSCs based on a PTB7-TH:IEIC BHJ film without any post-treatments showed PCEs as high as 6.31%, which is the highest PCE for PSCs based on small molecule nonfullerene electron acceptors, and among the best results reported for fullerene-free solar cells. The high efficiency is attributed to strong and broad absorption, matched energy levels, efficient and balanced charge transport, and nanoscale interpenetrating morphology of the blended film. These preliminary results demonstrate that IEIC is a very promising alternative of fullerene derivatives for application as an acceptor in PSCs.

4.2. Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-TH:IEIC/Ca or PDIN/Al. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 10 Ω □−1) was precleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone and isopropanol, and treated using an ultraviolet ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and then baked at 150 °C for 15 min. A solution (totally 25 mg mL−1) of PTB7-TH:IEIC blend was subsequently spin-coated (1000 rpm) on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer (ca. 110 nm). The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Calcium (ca. 15 nm) and aluminium (ca. 50 nm) layers were evaporated under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The methanol solution (0.2% acetic acid) of PDIN at a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was deposited atop the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and the thickness of the PDIN layer was ca. 14 nm. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured using a computer-controlled B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit (Agilent Technologies). An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI ELECTRIC Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) coupled with AM1.5G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was recorded using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

Broader context
Fullerenes have been dominant electron acceptors for solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs), a cost-effective alternative for utilizing solar energy; but some shortcomings of fullerenes, such as weak absorption in the visible spectral region and limited energy level variability, hinder the development of PSCs. Thus, novel alternative electron acceptor materials with strong and broad absorption spectra and appropriate energy levels are necessary for PSCs. So far, PSCs based on nonfullerene acceptors have afforded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5–6% after post-treatments. Here, a nonfullerene electron acceptor (IEIC) based on indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile was designed and synthesized. IEIC exhibited good thermal stability, strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region with an extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 672 nm, deep LUMO energy level (−3.82 eV) close to those of fullerenes, and a relatively high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fullerene-free PSCs based on the blends of the IEIC acceptor and a low-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-TH, using a perylene diimide derivative as a cathode interlayer, showed PCEs of up to 6.31%, which is among the best PCEs reported for fullerene-free PSCs.
