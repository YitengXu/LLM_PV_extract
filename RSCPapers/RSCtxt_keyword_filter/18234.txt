    , Accepted 13th July 2014First published on 7th August 2014AbstractA new class of non-planar and three-dimensional spirobifluorene-modified perylene diimide compounds has been successfully designed and synthesized. The functionalization of the perylene diimide core with different spirobifluorene moieties can alter the molecular geometry as well as extend the spectral coverage into the red region. In addition, these compounds can be utilized as donor materials in combination with fullerene to form bulk heterojunctions, and particularly efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices demonstrating high open-circuit voltages of 0.97 V and a power conversion efficiencies of up to 4% have been prepared. These values are the highest among the cells utilizing p-type perylene diimide as photoactive material in OPV devices. This work opens up a new avenue for the design and synthesis of a new class of p-type perylene diimide compounds that are promising candidates as donor materials in the fabrication of OPV devices.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are considered as a promising renewable energy source due to their distinct properties, including light weight, flexibility, and low manufacturing cost, over their inorganic counterparts. Significant advances in the developments of smart materials and innovative device architectures have boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 9.2% for a single cell and 10.6% for a tandem device.1,2a Heliatek recently reported a world-record OPV device with a PCE of 12% based on oligomers with a tandem architecture.1b While most of the record-high OPV devices are based on employing newly synthesized polymers or oligomers as donor materials in combination with fullerene acceptors,2b–e the difficulty to produce high quality thin films and to obtain a high batch-to-batch reproducibility poses a major challenge for achieving efficient polymeric OPV devices. In addition, it is quite difficult to control the morphology and phase separation of active layer blends, which play a vital role in governing the device performance. On the other hand, small molecules are monodisperse in nature with well-defined chemical structures and can be synthesized with high purity and reproducibility. More importantly, it is much easier to produce high quality and uniform thin films based on small molecules via a vacuum deposition technique.
While small molecules can in principle give rise to OPV devices of better performance, the development of small molecular-based OPV devices is lagging much behind those of the polymer counterparts.3a–d,f–h A major challenge lies in the much smaller carrier mobility in small molecules than those of the polymers that leads to a low fill factor (FF), and hence a relatively low PCE of the OPV devices. This is especially the case for the devices with bulk heterojunctions, in which the carrier mobility in the blended layer is two or three orders of magnitude lower than that in the homogeneous layer.4 In addition, the planar geometry of small molecular-based donor materials would favor a mutually parallel orientation or polaron-pair recombination with fullerene acceptors, which would inevitably induce significant charge recombination to lower the device performance.5,6 As recently reported by Adachi and coworkers, the planar structure of donor materials, such as pentacene and copper phthalocyanine, would disrupt the molecular stacking of the fullerenes, resulting in a low PCE of the OPV devices.6
Apart from the metal phthalocyanine or aromatic compounds,7 perylene diimide (PDI) is another class of small molecules that has aroused much interest in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and more recently in OPV.8–10 PDI is a traditional dye with large molar extinction coefficients, high photo-stability and good chemical robustness. Owing to the π–π stacking in the conducting direction, it has an excellent electron-accepting property with a high electron mobility. Particularly, PDI and its derivatives have been widely studied for their self-assembly behavior and have been extensively used as semiconducting materials in the fabrication of organic field-effect transistors.8 Taking the advantages of the high electron mobility, PDI compounds are prototypes of n-type acceptors in OPV devices.9 However, the performance based on PDI is rather poor, in which the strong π–π stacking of the PDI molecules may be the major reason for the occurrence of severe exciton quenching and results in a considerably low PCE of such devices.10 It was only until very recently that Zhao and coworkers demonstrated a series of PDI dimers connected with different spirobifluorene linkers that served as an acceptor in a PDI dimer:poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)-based device to give a satisfactory PCE of up to 2.3%.9e The introduction of spirobifluorene linkers has been suggested to effectively suppress the self-aggregation and crystallization of the PDI units and enhance the exciton dissociation at the organic heterojunction. Narayan and coworkers also reported another twisted PDI compound as an acceptor.9a A high PCE of 2.8% has been achieved when this compound was blended into a polymer donor. These results demonstrate that non-planar PDI molecules can disrupt the crystallinity and enhance the short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCE of OPV devices.
As the planarity of the PDI molecules has proven to have an impact on the photovoltaic responses, this would provide new insights and open up new opportunities for the design and synthesis of efficient PDI molecules as donors or acceptors for the fabrication of OPV devices. Indeed, there are very limited reports on the synthesis of the p-type PDI counterparts.11 Herein, we report the synthesis, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of a novel class of p-type, non-planar and three-dimensional spirobifluorene-modified PDI derivatives. By functionalizing the PDI core with various spirobifluorene groups, both the optical and electronic properties of the PDI derivatives can be significantly manipulated. In particular, the electronic absorption spectral properties of such PDI compounds can cover the entire visible region with a low optical bandgap. In addition, this class of compounds has been explored as donor materials in the fabrication of efficient bulk heterojunction OPV devices.

Physical measurements and instrumentation

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400 (400 MHz) Fourier-transform NMR spectrometer with chemical shifts reported relative to tetramethylsilane ((CH3)4Si). Positive-ion EI and FAB mass spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific DFS high-resolution magnetic sector mass spectrometer. The electronic absorption spectra were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed with a CH Instruments, Inc. model CHI 620A electrochemical analyzer. Electrochemical measurements were performed in dichloromethane solutions with 0.1 mol dm−3 nBu4NPF6 as supporting electrolyte at room temperature. The reference electrode was a Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 mol dm−3 in acetonitrile) electrode, and the working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode (CH Instruments, Inc.) with a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The working electrode surface was first polished with 1 μm alumina slurry (Linde) on a microcloth (Buehler Co.), and then with a 0.3 μm alumina slurry. It was then rinsed with ultrapure deionized water and ultrasonically mixed in a beaker that contained ultrapure water for five minutes. The polishing and ultrasonic mixing steps were repeated twice, and then the working electrode was finally rinsed under a stream of ultrapure deionized water. The ferrocenium/ferrocene couple (Fc+/Fc) was used as the internal reference. All solutions for electrochemical studies were deaerated with prepurified argon gas prior to the measurements. Current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a programmable Keithley model 2400 power source. The photocurrent was measured under illumination from an Oriel 300 W solar simulator equipped with AM 1.5G (AM: air mass; G: global) filter, and the light intensity was measured using an Oriel silicon reference cell. For the external quantum efficiency measurements, devices were irradiated with monochromatic light of variable wavelength by using an Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator with a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel Model no. 74125). Thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a thermal gravimetric analyzer (Perkin-Elmer TGA 7) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Fabrication of OPV devices
OPV devices were fabricated on patterned ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq.−1. The substrates were cleaned with Decon 90, rinsed with de-ionized water, dried in an oven, and then treated in an ultraviolet ozone chamber. After that, the substrates were transferred into a vacuum deposition chamber for thermal evaporation of organic materials and metal, and all the films were sequentially deposited at a rate of 0.1–0.2 nm s−1 without a vacuum break. A shadow mask was used to define the cathode and to make four 0.1 cm2 devices on each substrate. All devices were measured under ambient conditions without encapsulation.

Precursors TPA-SPIRO-Br and TPA-tert-SPIRO-Br were obtained in moderate yields, and they were then converted to their corresponding boronic ester precursors TPA-SPIRO-Bpin and TPA-tert-SPIRO-Bpin by palladium-catalyzed borylation with KOAc and B2pin2 in toluene. Precursors PDI-(OPhI)4 and PDI-(OPhI)2 were synthesized according to modification of a procedure reported in the literature.12d−f A mixture containing 4-iodophenol and tetrachloro/dichloro-PDI (8:1) were heated at 90 °C in dry 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) overnight in the presence of excess K2CO3. Finally, compounds 1–4 were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction of precursors PDI-(OPhI)4 and PDI-(OPhI)2 with an excess amount of the respective boronic acid/ester. Compounds 1–4 were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and HR-EI or HR-MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The synthetic schemes of precursors and compounds 1–4 are shown in Schemes 1 and 2.

Electronic absorption properties
The electronic absorption spectra of spirobifluorene-modified perylene diimide derivatives 1–4 were recorded in dichloromethane at 298 K. In general, the electronic absorption spectra of all the compounds show broad absorption bands ranging from 300 to 650 nm with extinction coefficients on the order of 105 dm3 mol−1 cm−1. The characteristic vibronic absorption bands of PDI located at around 400–600 nm with extinction coefficients of 4 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 correspond to the π–π* transition of the PDI core. The electronic absorption band at 400–500 nm is assigned to the S0 → S2 electronic transition caused by the dipole moment perpendicular to the long perylene axis, while the absorption band at 500–600 nm is assigned to the S0 → S1 electronic transition caused by the dipole moment parallel to the long perylene axis. These assignments are based on the grounds of previous spectroscopic work on PDI compounds.13 The higher-energy absorption bands located at approximately 280–400 nm with extinction coefficients of 3 × 105 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 correspond to the mixing of π–π* transitions of the pendant triphenylamine and spirobifluorene linker. The π–π* transition of the PDI core is found to be slightly blue-shifted in 4 as a result of the less electron-donating substituents on the PDI core. In addition, the extinction coefficients of the absorption bands of the pendant triphenylamine and spirobifluorene linker, i.e. the π–π* transition bands located at approximately 280–400 nm, are found to be correlated to the number of pendant groups attached to the PDI core. It is worth noting that no intramolecular charge transfer band can be found, indicating that there is no significant ground-state electronic interaction between PDI and the pendant triphenylamine–spirobifluorene groups, as expected for the twisted structural configuration of these compounds. The photophysical data of compounds 1–4 are summarized in Table 1, and the UV-vis spectra are shown in Fig. 1.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behaviors of compounds 1–4 were studied by cyclic voltammetry. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded in dichloromethane in the presence of 0.1 M nBu4NPF6. In general, all the spirobifluorene-modified PDI compounds showed two quasi-reversible oxidation couples at around +0.8 to +1.5 V versus standard calomel electrode (SCE). The first oxidation couple is assigned to the oxidation of the triphenylamine moiety, whereas the second oxidation couple is assigned to the oxidation of the spirobifluorene linker. With the introduction of the more electron-rich tert-butyl groups on the spirobifluorene linker, i.e., compound 3, the potentials for the oxidation were found to be less positive relative to that of compound 2. Two quasi-reversible reduction couples ranging from −0.6 to −1.0 V that arise from the PDI-centered reduction are observed. With the attachment of less electron-donating groups to the PDI core, the reduction peak potentials became less negative, whereas the potentials for the oxidation peaks remained almost unchanged. For example, with compounds 1 and 2, the introduction of spirobifluorene linker between the triphenylamine and PDI core would increase the distance between the two chromophores and simultaneously reduce the efficiency of the intramolecular electron transfer, and thus increase the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap. There is also an increased possibility of π–π stacking between the PDI molecules for compound 4, which in turn results in a narrowing of the energy bandgap. Table 2 summarizes the electrochemical data for compounds 1–4, and their cyclic voltammograms are given in Fig. 2.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of compounds 1–4 were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). All of the compounds exhibit no apparent glass transitions. In addition, all the compounds show high decomposition temperatures >400 °C (defined as the temperature at which the material showed a 5% weight loss under a nitrogen atmosphere), indicating that this class of compounds are thermally stable. Fig. 3 shows the TGA curves of compounds 1–4, and the thermal decomposition temperature of the compounds are tabulated in Table 3.

Photovoltaic properties
To study the applicability of compounds 1–4 as donor materials for the fabrication of OPV devices, bulk heterojunction devices with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/molybdenum oxide (MoO3) (2 nm)/x% 1–4: C70 (60 nm)/bathophenanthroline (BPhen) (8 nm)/aluminum (Al) (100 nm) were prepared, where x has been varied from 3% to 9%. ITO, MoO3, C70, BPhen and Al were used as the anode, anodic buffer layer, acceptor, exciton blocking layer and cathode, respectively. A control device without the donor (i.e. C70-only) was also prepared for comparison. Under light illumination of 1 sun, the C70-only device shows a poor photovoltaic response with a JSC of 1.27 mA cm−2, an VOC of 0.98 V and a FF of 0.37, corresponding to a low PCE of 0.46%, consistent with other studies.14 On the other hand, the doping of PDI compounds as donor into C70 to form bulk heterojunctions had significantly improved the photovoltaic responses. For instance, the JSC sharply increases from 1.27 mA cm−2 for the C70-only device to 9.74 mA cm−2 for the device doped with 7% compound 3. Together with the high VOC of 0.94 V, this corresponds to the best device with a PCE of 3.94%. Similar performance has been obtained when the C70 is doped with other PDI compounds. Table 4 summarizes the key parameters of devices without and with PDI as donor materials. It should be mentioned that the doping of the PDI compounds as donors can broaden the spectral coverage and increase the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the OPV devices. Fig. 4 shows the IPCE spectra of devices doped with 7% PDI compound as the donor. Without the donor material, the maximum IPCE of the control device (i.e. the C70-only device) is only 24.6% at 385 nm. The employment of the PDI compounds as donor significantly increased the IPCE of up to 62.9%, 73.0%, 70.6%, and 54.4% for devices doped with 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. In addition, the plateau sensitivity of the doped devices can fully cover the visible spectrum between 380 and 700 nm, which corresponds well to the superposition of the spectral absorption of C70 and the PDI compounds. The IPCE of devices doped with 1, 2, 3, and 4 has been shown to be dramatically increased to 63.2%, 75.6%, 67.5%, and 58.6% at 500 nm, respectively, approaching an order of magnitude higher than that of the C70-only device (7.8%). Note that the JSC obtained by integrating the product of the IPCE data and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum perfectly matches the observed JSC in the J–V curves (i.e. within 5% error). For instance, from the integration of the IPCE spectrum with an AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the JSC calculated for devices doped with 7% of compound 3 is 9.65 mA cm−2, in excellent agreement with that observed from the J–V characteristic (9.74 mA cm−2). The inset in Fig. 4 shows the product of the IPCE data and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum for devices doped with 3.

 Fig. 4  IPCE spectra of devices based on different PDI compounds as donor materials. Inset: The product of the IPCE data and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum for devices doped with compound 3. 
The increase in JSC and IPCE are found to be dependent on the planarity of the PDI molecules. The tetra-substituted PDI (i.e. compound 1) has a non-planar and three-dimensional structure, in which the 7%-doped device gives a moderate PCE of 3.14% with a JSC of 9.04 mA cm−2. Introduction of a spirobifluorene linker between the triphenylamine and PDI core to prepare compounds 2 and 3 would increase the three-dimensional molecular size. Such larger molecular sizes of 2 and 3 can minimize the exciton quenching resulting from the mutual parallel orientation between the donor and acceptor,5,9a,e and thus enhance the possibility for charge dissociation. This, in turn, results in an increased JSC of up to 10.15 and 9.74 mA cm−2, respectively, for devices doped with 2 and 3. In sharp contrast, reducing the number of substitutions on the PDI core (i.e. compound 4) would not alter the planarity of the rigid PDI molecule, in which rapid charge recombination would occur that would quench the photogenerated excitons and results in a lower JSC of 5.78 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 1.53%. Nevertheless, the present findings demonstrate an effective approach for synthesizing a new class of p-type PDI compounds that are suitable candidates to serve as the donor materials in the fabrication of efficient OPV devices. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 3.94% is one of the highest ever reported for a cell utilizing a p-type PDI moiety.
Conclusion
A new class of p-type, spirobifluorene-modified PDI derivatives has been synthesized and characterized. The functionalization of the perylene diimide core with different spirobifluorene moieties has been shown to effectively alter the molecular geometry, as well as extend the spectral coverage into the red region of up to 700 nm, with high molar extinction coefficients of up to 3 × 105 M−1 cm−1. More importantly, these modified-PDI compounds are promising donor materials for the fabrication of OPV devices. Bulk heterojunction devices based upon a fullerene acceptor demonstrated a high JSC of up to 10.26 mA cm−2 and high VOC of up to 0.97 V. In addition, a high PCE of up to 3.94% has been achieved. This is one of the highest ever reported for a cell utilizing p-type PDI moiety.
