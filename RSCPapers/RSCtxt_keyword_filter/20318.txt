    , Accepted 5th September 2015First published on 7th September 2015AbstractIn aqueous dispersions of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) produced by a sono-Fenton method, aniline is in situ polymerized to produce different polyaniline (PANI)–GQD hybrids (PAGD) without using external dopant. FTIR studies indicate that the carboxylic acid groups of the GQDs dope PANI well. The UV-Vis spectra exhibit a π to polaron band transition of the PAGD hybrids and show a gradual red shift with increasing intensity for increasing amounts of GQDs due to the gradual uncoiling and increase of polarons in the doped PANI chains. The fluorescence intensity of the GQDs is drastically quenched in the PAGD hybrids suggesting effective charge transfer between the GQDs and PANI chains. The X-ray diffraction study suggests the presence of a lamellar structure with a lamellar thickness of 13.57 Å. The morphologies of the PAGD hybrids studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy exhibit a change from flakes to rods with increasing GQD concentration, which has been attributed to the change from a flat to cylindrical lamella formation. The thermogravimetric analysis result indicates that, in comparison to HCl-doped PANI, the PAGD hybrids exhibit better thermal stability. In the PAGD composites the dc conductivity increases by three orders compared to that of the GQDs due to polaron formation in the PANI chains. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the PAGD composites indicate semiconducting behaviour and on irradiation with light an almost reversible photoresponse occurs. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated with the PAGD hybrids and N719 dye indicate a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.12%. Impedance data of the PAGD hybrids exhibit semicircular Cole–Cole plots indicating the presence of a resistance (R)–capacitance (C) circuit where the capacitance is in parallel to the bulk resistance which increases with increasing GQD concentration. The Debye plot and the dielectric permittivity values also support the variation of the photovoltaic properties of the PAGD hybrids. The impedance spectra of the DSSCs indicate the presence of three semicircles exhibiting a complex equivalent circuit composed of three R–C circuits, and analysis of the data yields the lifetime values of photo-injected electrons supporting the PCE variation of the PAGD hybrids.
Introduction
Exploitation of the captivating properties1–5 (e.g. physical, mechanical, optoelectronic etc.) of 2D graphene nanosheets has now become the centre of attention for material scientists for numerous purposes. To promote these properties for different applications, a good solubility in different solvents is necessary. Graphene oxide (GO) may be a way out, as its oxygenated functional groups e.g. –COOH, –OH, epoxy etc. make it soluble in water and in some organic solvents, but during the insertion of these oxygenated groups, a few defects enter into the 2D sheets decreasing the conductivity enormously. To make these graphene derivatives soluble without damaging their properties is still a challenge and a lot of trials such as forming controlled reduced graphene oxide,6 attaching/grafting small molecules or polymers with graphene, and preparation of graphene composite materials via non-covalent interactions have been attempted.7–9 In this context, dimensionless graphene quantum dots (GQDs) may be an appropriate replacement for GO as its advanced optoelectronic properties, owing to quantum confinement and edge effects, unwrap new areas of interest e.g. photovoltaics,10–13 light emitting diodes (LED) etc.14,15
Synthesis of GQDs is still at its threshold stage, though there are reports on its electrochemical method,16 hydrothermal route,17 conventional chemical synthesis,18–20 electron-beam lithography21etc. A photo-Fenton reaction was recently reported by Zhou et al.22 for an uncomplicated synthesis of superior GQDs with better optoelectronic properties and solubility in an aqueous medium facilitating some extreme practical applications. We have chosen a modified version of that process with a sonication-assisted Fenton reaction instead of using light.23
Some applications of polymeric nanocomposites with GQDs have been reported by a few groups. In this context, polyaniline (PANI) attracts much attention in the group of conducting polymers due to its straightforward synthesis and widespread applications in LEDs,24 rechargeable batteries25 and of course in solar cells.26 One-dimensional nanowires, nanofibres or nanotubes of polyaniline are very interesting as a result of their higher conductivity and thermal stability.27–29 Polyaniline-encapsulated CdSe QDs decorated onto a graphene surface produce a stable polyaniline/CdSe QD/graphene hybrid, which exhibits photoinduced charge transfer between graphene and the encapsulated QDs within the hybrid.30 Lau and coworkers have observed tunable photoluminescence (PL) and hysteresis in the electrical behaviors of GQDs embedded in PANI and the PL red shift in the composite has been attributed to a π-conjugated interaction between the GQDs and PANI.31 The optoelectronic properties of GQDs and PANI–GQDs have recently been compared by Lau's group using a photoresponse study.32 Under illumination at 405 nm, PANI–GQDs exhibit one order higher photoresponsivity than GQDs. The PANI–GQD devices exhibit a positive photocurrent below 3 V, but change to a negative photocurrent above 4 V and this can be reverted when the voltage is reduced to below 3 V. The negative photocurrent has been attributed to the interaction between trapped charges and injected charges from the electrodes causing a net decrease of free charge carriers.
Utilizing the electron acceptor properties of GQDs for the fabrication of GQD-based solar cells33,34 by combining them with a conducting polymer (donor) is interesting. Previously reported approaches to achieve quality photovoltaic systems by combining GQDs and polymers with donor properties have faced severe difficulties such as multistep synthesis, and inferior electronic and photovoltaic properties.23,35 For this reason, we have developed a system consisting of a GQD dispersion where in situ polyaniline (PANI) is synthesized in the presence of ammonium persulphate (APS) without using any acid. The –COOH groups of the GQDs are utilized for the doping of PANI, making a good dispersion so that it can be easily processed for photovoltaic applications. The –COOH groups of the GQDs could dope PANI well, so they would remain closely adhered to each other and bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) may be produced at the molecular level in the hybrid. The BHJ nature of the hybrid may yield a synergic effect facilitating the photo-excited electrons to be separated from the holes of doped PANI, and transport of both the charges (electron and hole), contributing to the total photocurrent that may occur in the PANI–GQD (PAGD) hybrid.36,37 The relative amounts of GQD and PANI are still to be realized to give the optimum combination for the best photovoltaic application in its class. So, we are looking to find that combination by varying the GQD amount with a fixed amount of aniline and APS (Scheme 1). To understand the materials’ properties, the structure, morphology, and optical and thermal properties of the PAGD hybrids are delineated here. A perfect match between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the donor PANI chains and the conduction band of the acceptor GQDs may be anticipated. The variation of its electronic properties and behaviour under illuminated conditions, and its solar cell efficiency have been studied and the impedance data are analysed to reveal a comprehensive illustration of the electronic and photo-electronic properties of the GQD and PANI moieties dwelling in close proximity.

Experimental section
Materials and purification
Graphite powder (Aldrich, USA), ammonium persulphate (APS), potassium permanganate (E. Merck, Mumbai, synthetic grade), NaNO3, FeCl3, and H2O2 (Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India) were used as received. Aniline monomer (E. Merck, Mumbai) was purified under reduced pressure prior to use. All aqueous solutions were prepared in doubly distilled water.
Preparation of graphene quantum dots (GQDs)
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were synthesized using a simple sono-Fenton method.23 First, GO was prepared using Hummer's method38 and then 75 mg of GO was finely dispersed in 100 mL of deionised water by stirring and ultrasonication for 2 h. 30 mL of 30% H2O2 was added into the dispersion under constant stirring. Then an aqueous solution of FeCl3 (2 mg mL−1) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was sonicated in an ultrasonication bath (80 W) for about 6 hours and was dialyzed in HPLC water for 3 days in order to remove the iron completely. After dialysis, the resulting solution was freeze dried to obtain the graphene quantum dots as a solid material.
Fabrication of GQD-doped PANI nanocomposites (PAGD)
Initially, a fixed volume of aniline (100 μL) was added into different amounts of GQDs (10, 20, 33.3, 50 mg) dispersed in 10 mL of water with constant stirring for 1 h at 10–12 °C in four 30 mL culture tubes. 5 mL aqueous solution of APS (5% w/v) was then added dropwise into each mixture after setting the temperature at 5 °C and the mixture was allowed to stand overnight at that temperature. The desired product was filtered and washed repeatedly first by water and then by methanol in order to remove APS and oligoaniline. Finally, the product was dried under vacuum at 30 °C for 2 days to collect a solid mass of the polyaniline–GQD (PAGD) hybrids (Scheme 1). The composites were designated PAGD1, PAGD2, PAGD3 and PAGD5 in which the amounts of GQD used were 10, 20, 33.3 and 50 mg, respectively.
Characterization

Microscopy. 
For the surface morphological investigation of all the composites, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Jeol GSM-5800) was conducted by moulding the powder samples on carbon tape and coating with platinum prior to observation. The interior morphology of the samples was monitored using a transmission electron microscope (TEM JEOL, 2010EX) operated at a 200 kV acceleration voltage. An aqueous dispersion of the sample was drop casted onto a 300 mesh carbon coated copper grid and after drying it was used for TEM analysis directly.


Spectroscopy. 
FTIR studies of the samples were performed using a Shimadzu FT-IR instrument (model 8400S). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were taken from aqueous solutions of the GQDs, HCl doped PANI and PAGD hybrids using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Cary 8454) in a quartz cell of thickness 1 cm in the wavelength range 190–1100 nm at 30 °C. A photoluminescence (PL) study was conducted using a Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter (Horiva Jovin Yvon). The aqueous solutions of the GQDs and PAGD in a quartz cell of 1 cm path length were excited at 360 nm. Emission spectra were observed from 375 to 700 nm using a slit width of 5 nm with a 1 nm wavelength increment and an integration time of 0.1 s.


pH metric titration of GQDs. 
In order to estimate the amount of –COOH and –OH groups present in the GQDs, a pH metric titration was performed using an OAKTON pH meter. For titration, the GQDs were dispersed in distilled water (1 mg mL−1) by sonication. The aqueous dispersion was equilibrated under a nitrogen flow for 2 h with continuous stirring to remove the dissolved CO2 completely. The titration was performed manually with 0.01 M NaOH solution under a constant stream of nitrogen. The resulting titration curve exhibits two inflection points which are also evident from the derivatogram. The end of each inflection is considered to be the end point of the titration.39,40


X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. 
Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) studies of all the powder samples were recorded using a Bruker AXS diffractometer (model D8 advance) operated at a generator voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. Samples were scanned in the range of 2θ = 5–35° at a scan rate of 0.5 s per step with a step width of 0.02°.


Thermal study. 
The thermal stabilities of the GQDs, HCl doped PANI and all the PAGD composites were measured using a Perkin-Elmer TGA instrument (Pyris Diamond TG/DTA, model SDT Q600) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.


dc conductivity measurement. 
The dc-conductivities of the powder samples were measured using a two-probe method. Each sample was sandwiched between two indium-tin oxide (ITO) conducting strips of 1 mm width placed perpendicularly. The detailed procedure is discussed in our earlier publication.41 The area of the sample was 0.06 cm2 and the thickness of the sample was measured using digital slide calipers. The conductivities of the samples were measured using an electrometer (Keithley, model 2401) at 25 °C using the equation:  where ‘l’ is the thickness, ‘a’ is the area and ‘R’ is the resistance. The current–voltage (I–V) studies were performed by applying a voltage from −5 to +5 V and measuring the current at each applied voltage.


Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). 
The substrates (PAGD samples) were sensitized by immersing them in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the N719 dye, [di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)]. The samples were then carefully rinsed with ethanol to remove the additional dye. The photoelectrodes were fabricated on low resistance ITO glass (2 × 2 cm2, 8–12 Ω) using a drop-cast method. The resulting dispersions in chlorobenzene were casted onto the ITO glass using Scotch tape as a frame and spacer to control the film thickness and were dried in air. The cell area is ∼0.36 cm2. The iodide–triiodide based electrolyte solution, consisting of 0.5 M KI, 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone, was placed on the active electrode area. To assemble the solar cells, an Al-coated conducting glass was placed on the sensitized PAGD sample, separated by a 60 μm parafilm strip to form a sandwich-type configuration. A small portion of bare ITO glass and Al-coated glass was uncovered for wire connection to the anode. The configuration of the solar cell was achieved by putting the sample opposite the ITO substrate on top of the counter electrode in a face-to-face fashion. To seal the DSSC, a 60 μm parafilm strip is used. The sealing is done by heating it at 60 °C. The cell current between the two electrodes was measured using a Keithley source meter (model 2401) by illuminating under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2 illumination) from a 150 W Xenon lamp source (Newport Corp. USA; model no. 67005).


Impedance spectroscopy. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements of all the PAGD hybrids were carried out at 30 °C using a Solarton SI 1260 impedance analyzer (Solarton, U.K.) recorded at a frequency range of 32 MHz to 1 Hz with an oscillation voltage of 100 mV. The data were analyzed using the Solarton Z-view software. The impedance spectra of the DSSCs are recorded at a frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 mHz with an oscillation voltage of 100 mV at an applied DC voltage of 0.64 V, i.e. at the open circuit voltage of the cell.

Results and discussion
Characterization of the GQDs
The transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of GO and the GQDs are compared in Fig. 1. The wrinkled GO sheets of large (μm) dimensions (Fig. 1a) disintegrate into tiny GO particles (Fig. 1b) due to the sono-Fenton reaction (Scheme 1) and the tiny particles may be called graphene quantum dots (GQDs). The diameters of the GQDs are distributed in the range of 0.8–2.6 nm with an average diameter of 1.7 ± 0.6 nm (Fig. 1c). A representative HRTEM image of an individual GQD is presented in the inset of Fig. 1b, and the fringe pattern suggests a lattice parameter of 0.31 nm for the GQDs. So the TEM micrographs clearly indicate that the large sized two dimensional GO sheets are easily disintegrated into zero dimensional GQDs during the sono-Fenton reaction. Fig. 1d exhibits the digital images of GO, GQDs and UV-irradiated GQD dispersions. The photograph of the aqueous dispersion of GO under ordinary light has a brown color, but that of the GQDs exhibits a light yellowish color differentiating the two graphene species which drastically differ in size. It is interesting that the UV-irradiated GQD dispersion exhibits a green colour, suggesting a green emission from the GQDs, however the GO dispersion at neutral pH does not exhibit any emissive property.42 AFM topography (Fig. 2a) of the GQDs clearly indicates a homogeneous dispersion of the GQDs. The height profile (Fig. 2b) of it ranges from 0.3 to 1.1 nm, suggesting that during the sono-Fenton reaction mainly monolayers of GQDs are formed. The histogram of the height images (Fig. 2c) exhibits a most probable height distribution at ∼0.6 nm confirming the formation of a majority of graphene monolayer sheets during the sono-Fenton reaction.43 The formation of GQDs by the sono-Fenton method may also be evident from spectroscopic studies. In Fig. 3a, GO exhibits an absorption peak at 270 nm characterizing the π–π∗ transition of the aromatic sp2 domains of GO. In the case of the aqueous dispersion of the GQDs, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum consists of two absorption peaks centred at 241 and 344 nm, of which the former band can be ascribed to the π → π* transition of the aromatic sp2 domains of the GQDs, while the band at 344 nm is due to the n → π* transition of the functional groups present in the GQDs.44 The 29 nm blue shift in the π → π* transition peak of the GQDs may be attributed to the small sizes of the sp2 domains produced from the large domains of the GO sheets. Also, due to the increased number of carboxylic acid functional groups in the GQDs compared to GO, the n → π* transition peak is prominent here. In Fig. 3b, the excitation dependent PL behaviour of the GQDs is presented. By changing the excitation wavelength from 440 to 530 nm, the PL peak moves towards longer wavelengths from 531 nm to 647 nm. The excitation dependent PL property of the GQDs may be attributed to the zigzag edges of graphene having a carbene-like structure where the triplet ground state (σ1π1) is most common and the emission occurs from the carbene-like triplet ground state.45–47 A quantitative estimation of the –OH and –COOH groups present in the GQDs is made from pH metric titration (Fig. S1†) and the concentrations of the –COOH and –OH functional groups in the GQDs are found to be 1.91 and 3.07 mmol g−1, respectively.

Characteristics of the PANI/GQD (PAGD) hybrids
The formation of the GQD doped PANI nanocomposites is characterized using FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 4) and the characteristic peak of the GQDs for the –OH stretching vibration at 3408 cm−1 is shifted to 3433–3435 cm−1 for the PAGD composites due to interactions between the carboxylic –OH groups of the GQDs with the nitrogen atoms of the growing PANI chains. The GQDs have a broadened peak in the 1600–1800 cm−1 region which is due to merging of two peaks at 1641 and 1710 cm−1 owing to the CC and >CO bond stretching vibrations, respectively. Another peak for the C–O stretching vibration occurs at 1409 cm−1. HCl doped PANI shows characteristics peaks at 1570 cm−1 for the quinonoid (Q) ring deformation, 1474 cm−1 for the benzenoid (B) ring deformation, 1297 cm−1 for the C–N stretching of the secondary aromatic amine, and 1110 cm−1 for the polaron formation of the quinonoid structure (Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B) due to doping.41,48,49 In the case of the PAGD samples, the presence of all the characteristic bands with a shift from the HCl doped PANI occurs. In PAGD1 the quinonoid (Q) ring deformation peak has shifted from 1570 to 1584 cm−1 due to a rigid quinonoid structure forming upon doping with GQDs, but with increasing GQD concentration the peak gradually shifts to lower energy and for PAGD5 it shifts to 1572 cm−1. A probable reason is that with the increase in GQD concentration, an increase in the doping of the PANI chains occurs producing a less rigid quinonoid structure. The polaron band vibration peak occurs at 1110 cm−1 for HCl doped PANI but in PAGD1 it shifts to higher energy at 1118 cm−1. Two possible reasons may be put forward: (i) a lower degree of doping due to the weaker nature of the –COOH groups of the GQDs than HCl and (ii) the bulkier nature of the GQD counter anion than that of Cl− may cause difficulty in the Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B bond vibration of doped PANI. With an increase of GQD concentration in the PAGD hybrids, the increased self aggregation of the GQDs causes increased steric hindrance for the polaron band vibration and the polaron band at 1118 cm−1 of PAGD1 shifts to a higher energy vibration at 1126 cm−1 in PAGD5. It is also interesting to note that the benzenoid ring deformation band position of HCl-doped PANI (1474 cm−1) shifts to 1488 cm−1 in PAGD1 and this band gradually shifts to higher energy with increasing GQD concentration. This may be attributed to the stacking of the benzenoid rings of PANI and the GQDs through a π-stacking process, making the benzene ring more rigid than that of HCl doped PANI, and increasing the GQD concentration causes more π-stacking making the benzene ring of PANI more rigid.
 Fig. 4  FTIR spectra of the powder GQDs, HCl doped PANI and PAGD samples. 

Fig. 5 represents the UV-Vis spectra of the aqueous solutions of PANI and the PAGD hybrids normalized with respect to the PANI concentration. The UV-Vis spectrum of HCl doped PANI shows three absorption peaks at 340, 432 and 812 nm for the π–π* transition of the benzenoid rings, the polaron band to π* band transition and the π band to polaron band transitions, respectively.29,48 The UV-Vis spectra of the PAGD composites dispersed in aqueous medium exhibit three characteristic absorption bands at around 354, 430, and above 800 nm with a hump in the 305–310 nm region. The band at 354 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition in the benzenoid rings, while the bands at about 430 and 802–843 nm represent the polaron to π* band transition and the π to polaron band transition of the doped PANI chains, respectively.50,51 The humps at 305–310 nm are newly developed in the PAGD composites and there is a gradual red shift of the band from 305 to 310 nm with increasing GQD concentration. No definite reason for the occurrence of this new band may be put forward here, but one probable reason may be that it arises from the charge transfer transition between the donor PANI chains and the acceptor GQDs. The increase in GQD concentration increases the possibility of a charge transfer transition causing a gradual red shift of the band. It is interesting to note that the π–π* transition at 340 nm of HCl doped PANI shows a red shift to 354 nm in the PAGD samples and may originate from inter-chain stacking of the PANI chains in the doped conditions. In the HCl doped PANI, the counter chloride ions are of a smaller size facilitating the inter-chain aggregation of the PANI chains by a π–π stacking process causing the π–π* transitions at a higher energy. But in the case of the GQD doped PANI chains, the counter anions of the GQDs are of a bigger size and sterically hinder the inter-chain stacking of the PANI chains, shifting the π–π* transitions to lower energy. Also it is important to observe that the π band to polaron band transition of PAGD exhibits a gradual red shift from 802 nm to 843 nm with increasing amounts of GQD, indicating that the band gap of the π band to polaron band transition becomes progressively lower in the nanocomposites. It implies an increase of effective conjugation length of the PANI chains from PAGD1 to PAGD5 with doping, and this may be attributed to the uncoiling of the PANI chains with increasing GQD concentration due to both the bulkier and polydentate nature of the GQD counter anion used for doping of the PANI chains. It is evident from the figure that the intensity of the π band to polaron band transition peak gradually increases with increasing GQD concentration, showing a maximum for the PAGD5 sample. The intensities are higher even compared to that of the HCl doped PANI. A probable reason is that with increasing GQD concentration, more polarons are produced, and consequently the intensity increases with increasing GQD concentration in the PAGD hybrids. The higher intensity of the polaron band in the PAGD hybrids compared to HCl doped PANI may be attributed to the separation of the radical cations of the polarons due to closer proximity with the π-conjugated moiety of the GQDs. This may cause an increase in the transition moment integral, thus increasing the transition probability and hence the intensity. With increasing GQD concentration not only are more polarons produced but also their transition probability increases simultaneously, contributing to the higher polaron band intensity.
 Fig. 5  Normalized UV-Vis spectra of HCl doped PANI and the PAGD samples in aqueous medium. 
In Fig. S2† the fluorescence spectra of the GQDs and a PAGD composite are compared for excitation at 360 nm. The GQDs exhibit two emission peaks at 462 and 558 nm and it is evident from the figure that the normalized PL intensity of the GQDs in the PAGD hybrid is drastically quenched compared to that of the pure GQDs. This is due to the effective transfer of excitons of GQDs with the PANI chains due to their closer proximity.
To ascertain the crystallinity of the GQDs and GQD–PANI nanocomposites, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed and the corresponding diffractograms are presented in Fig. 6. In the XRD pattern of the GQDs, two diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ = 10.3 and 25.4° having d-spacing values of 8.57 and 3.50 Å, respectively; the latter indicates the π-stacking distance and the former indicates the lateral dimension of the π-stacked graphene rings indicating the presence of a layered graphene structure of the GQDs.33,44 The HCl doped PANI exhibits four diffraction peaks at 2θ = 9.3, 14.8, 20.9 and 25.5° but the GQD doped PANI nanocomposite with the lowest GQD content (PAGD1) exhibits three characteristics peaks of crystalline PANI at 2θ = 6.4°, 19.1° and 25.4°, corresponding to d spacing values of 13.79, 4.64 and 3.50 Å, respectively (Fig. 6).48 The peak centred at 2θ = 6.4° is related to the lamellar distance of a lamella composed of GQDs and a PANI chain (Scheme 2). The lateral dimension of the GQDs is 8.57 Å and the width of the PANI chain is 5 Å (energy minimized), thus the sum of the two nearly equals the lamellar thickness of the PAGD samples (Table S1†). The diffraction peak at 2θ = 19.1° corresponds to the periodicity in the direction parallel to the polymer chain, whereas the presence of the peak at 2θ = 25.4° indicates the periodicity in the direction perpendicular to the polymer chain arising from the face-to-face inter-chain π-stacking of PANI and between the GQDs.52 The 2θ values for the other PAGD hybrids are almost similar to each other, which indicates that the internal structure of each PAGD system is almost the same. It is important to note that in PAGD5 a prominent diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.3° is present along with the other peaks of the PAGD hybrids dictating the lateral dimension of the π-stacked graphene rings.

The TGA thermograms of the GQDs and PAGD hybrids are presented in Fig. 7 where the thermogram for the GQDs exhibits three decomposition temperatures. The first weight loss below 100 °C corresponds to the loss of adsorbed water molecules. The second weight loss around 240 °C may be attributed to the decomposition of oxygen-containing surface functional groups. The final degradation above 500 °C is due to the decomposition of the carbon backbone.53 For all the GQD–PANI composites, a gradual degradation in mass is maintained throughout the whole temperature range. However, HCl-doped PANI (Fig. 7) exhibits a TGA curve having comparatively clear degradation temperatures at 58 and 524 °C, suggesting an inferior thermal stability compared to that of the PAGD composites. It is inferred from the figure that the % weight loss of the PAGD hybrids lies in the range of 27–51%, whereas HCl-doped PANI degrades almost completely after 600 °C. Actually, the PAGD composites show a resistivity towards thermal degradation due to the higher order packing of the polyaniline chains.
 Fig. 7  TGA thermograms of the GQDs, HCl doped PANI and PAGD samples. 
FESEM images of the PAGD composites are presented in Fig. 8a–d and it is apparent from the figure that there is a gradual change in the morphology from flakes in PAGD1 to a rod-like morphology (PAGD2 and PAGD3) and finally a mixture of rods and flakes in the PAGD5 sample. It is clearly evident from Fig. 8c that the rods of the PAGD3 sample are well organized and this is also supported by the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrograph of PAGD3 presented in the inset of the figure. To understand the formation of the different morphologies, a schematic model has been proposed (Scheme 2). In PAGD1 the GQD amount is much less and here a flat lamellar structure is produced where the PANI chains stack over the GQD surfaces, which grow to form flakes.54 But on increasing the GQD concentration, an end-on lamella is formed and the PANI chains prefer to orient themselves in a longitudinal fashion to produce cylindrical units which further self-assemble to arrange as rods.55 A careful observation of the PAGD2 and PAGD3 systems indicates that the rods of the former system are not smooth as in the PAGD3 system and that the roughness may arise from a lack of appropriate amounts of cylindrical units to self-assemble to produce smooth rods. In the PAGD5 sample the GQD concentration is large enough to keep some portion of it outside the cylindrical units and hence a mixture of rods and flakes are produced; the cylindrical units self-assemble to produce rods, while the stacking of PANI chains over the flat lamellar structure of the GQDs produces the flakes.

dc conductivity
The dc conductivity of the GQDs is 3 × 10−7 S cm−1 and the PAGD composites exhibit conductivities three orders higher because the composites contain the emeraldine salt phase of PANI as evidenced from UV visible spectroscopy. Table 1 shows that PAGD1 possesses the highest conductivity (6.42 × 10−4 S cm−1) among all the composites and PAGD3 has the lowest value (1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1), though PAGD3 exists mostly as the finest nano-rods in comparison to PAGD2 and PAGD5, whereas PAGD1 exists as nano-flakes. This is not surprising at all, as in PAGD1 nano-flakes are produced from a highly ordered structure of PANI chains corresponding to the lamellar arrangement (Scheme 2) and the flakes are overlapped with each other producing good conducting paths. So dopant concentration does not take control exclusively over the conductivity values. Here the supramolecular arrangements producing the conducting paths of the charge carriers in the hybrids play an important role in the variation of the conductivity values.

I–V characteristics
After getting an idea about the dc conductivity, it is crucial to inspect the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the PAGD composites in dark as well as in illuminated conditions and these are displayed in Fig. 9 and S3† which reveal that all the PAGD samples exhibit semiconducting behaviour.26 Comparing the current under both dark and illuminated conditions at a particular voltage, it is clearly obvious that the PAGD3 composite is superior and exhibits the highest photocurrent compared to the other composites. For further justification, photocurrent cycles were recorded at a constant bias of 5 V under white light irradiation (for 100 s) and under dark conditions (for 100 s) at a time gap of 1 ms to observe the growth and decay. Fig. 10 exhibits the photocurrent cycles of PAGD3 showing the turn “on” and turn “off” cycles and those of the other PAGD samples are shown in Fig. S4.† Comparing the results (Table 1) it is affirmed that all four ITO/PAGD/ITO devices can be almost reversibly turned “on” and “off” by switching the white light illumination on and off, respectively. The increase in the current density after white light irradiation upon PAGD3 is 4.5 mA cm−2 which is the least amongst all the composites, but the noticeable fact is that the percent photo response [{(photo current density − dark current density)/dark current density} × 100] is the highest (15%) compared to those of the other composites. This is also found to be true even after the 6th cycle and it is predictable from this result that PAGD3 may exhibit the highest photo response.

Dye-sensitized solar cell
Employing the combination of the donor and acceptor properties of the PAGD components, we have fabricated a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)56,57 with N719 dye. Details of setting up the DSSC device have been outlined in the experimental section. The PAGD composites exhibit a short-circuit current (Jsc) in a range of 5.24–7.35 mA cm−2 with the highest value of 7.35 mA cm−2 for PAGD3 (Fig. 11, Table S2†). The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PAGD3 is 0.65 V. The fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) values demonstrate the same trend as the JSC with a maximum fill factor of ∼0.65 and consequently the best η value of 3.12% for PAGD3, confirming it to have the best compatibility between the LUMO of the donor polyaniline chains and conduction band of the acceptor GQDs. In the PAGD systems the Voc does not vary with composition, indicating that the band gaps between the HOMO and LUMO of the donor and acceptor do not vary with composition. The reason for the variation of JSC with composition of the PAGD samples is unknown as it depends on a number of factors e.g. carrier-diffusion length for electrons and holes, lifetime of the photo-injected electrons, etc. From the results (Table S2†) it is apparent that Jsc increases with increasing GQD concentration, but in PAGD5 there is a decrease, indicating that the change of morphology arising from the supramolecular organization of the components in the hybrid also has a crucial role. It is to be noted here that the PCE of the PAGD3 system is much higher than those reported earlier for the polypyrrole and polythiophene derivative hybrids with GQD samples.23 A probable operational principle of the PAGD composite-based DSSCs is shown in Scheme S1.† The energy level diagram is presented considering the LUMO of PANI (−2.7 eV)58 and the conduction band of the GQDs (−3.47 eV).59 The N-719 dye absorbs white light in the DSSC and an electron of the dye is promoted to its excited state. The excited electron then enters into the LUMO of PANI and passes through the conduction band of the GQDs to the external circuit. The interactions between the acceptor GQDs and the donor conducting polymer assist the entire process by producing bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) of the PAGD hybrid at a molecular level, facilitating the photo electrons to be separated from the holes of doped PANI due to the synergic effect.36,37 The transport of the hole in the PANI chains (p-type semiconductor) and that of the electron through the GQDs (n-type semiconductor) contribute to the total photocurrent. Thus the excited electrons from the dye molecules injected into PANI en route to the GQDs lead to a reduction of the detrimental recombination and pass to the counter electrode through the ITO.

Impedance spectroscopy of the PAGD composites. 
To get an insight into the charge transport behaviour of the PAGD nanocomposites, ac impedance analysis was carried out as a non-destructive electrical characterization. A single semicircular arc is observed for all four PAGD composites in the Nyquist plots presented in Fig. 12. Each semicircular Cole–Cole plot signifies the coexistence of both resistive (R) and capacitive (C) features in the composites connected in a parallel mode.60–62 A model equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 12) was constructed to analyze and to interpret the impedance diagrams. We have obtained fitted curves for all the nanocomposites using the Z-view program (Solarton, London, U.K.) and the resistance and capacitance values evaluated from these fits are provided in Table 2. The existence of a single semicircle in all the composites is indicative of bulk resistance (R2), which increases concomitantly with increasing GQD content (Table 2). So it may be inferred that the GQDs play the part of a less-conducting moiety in the composites, thereby increasing the bulk resistance. Also the absence of any spike at the low frequency region of the Nyquist plot confirms the absence of the diffusion of ions at the electrodes and the conductivity observed in the composites is mostly electronic in nature.63,64 Notably for the nanocomposites, capacitance values increase dramatically with increasing amounts of GQD except for the PAGD3 sample. Since GQDs behave as acceptors, the capacitive feature in the composites originates principally from the GQD portion. Being acceptors, GQDs can store charges in the LUMO, thereby facilitating maximum charge storage for a unit increase in voltage in PAGD5 compared to the other three PAGD nanocomposites in this study. However, in contrast to the normal trend, PAGD3 exhibits the lowest capacitance value amongst all the four composites. No definite reason can be afforded here and a probable reason for this behaviour may be attributed to the most favourable interaction between the donor polyaniline chains and acceptor GQDs causing easy separation of charges. Owing to the lower availability of the LUMO of the acceptor, undoubtedly the possibility of charge storage by the acceptor moiety is low and hence PAGD3 exhibits a very low capacitance value.

In Fig. 13a the imaginary part of the impedance is plotted as a function of frequency for all the four PAGD nanocomposites. These plots are conventionally called Debye plots and they provide information regarding the bulk relaxation dynamics of the systems. As evidenced from the figure, each of the composites exhibits a single peak which indicates a single relaxation inside the material. From careful investigation, it is noticed that the peak position shifts toward higher frequencies from PAGD1 to PAGD5 and the maximum shift is observed for PAGD3. This may be ascribed to the fastest relaxation process in PAGD3 compared to the other samples, indicating the increase in lability of all the electrons.63Fig. 13b shows the variation of the dielectric permittivity (ε′) as a function of frequency and from the figure it is found to decrease with increasing frequency. This behavior can be associated with the probable reason that the dipoles are unable to rotate as fast as the change in the direction of the electric field, leading to a decrease in polarization.63 Moreover, in the higher frequency region, the dielectric permittivity exhibits a constant minimum value, indicating the absence of any other polarization processes arising within the bulk. It is to be noted that PAGD3 has the highest dielectric permittivity amongst the composites at a fixed frequency and this indicates it has the easiest dielectric polarization in response to an electrical field.65 Thus the impedance results are in accordance with the photovoltaic performance of the PAGD composites, suggesting that both the fastest relaxation and easiest polarization of the PAGD3 composite yield the highest PCE amongst the hybrids.

Impedance spectra of the DSSCs. 
Impedance spectroscopy of a DSSC is generally used to delineate the electron transfer process within the cell.57,66–68 Here the Nyquist plot of the impedance spectra of the PAGD solar cell devices is presented in Fig. 14, and it suggests the presence of three semicircles in each sample. The high frequency (105 to 106 Hz) semicircle (Z1) corresponds to the impedances for the charge transport at the aluminium counter electrode. The middle frequency (102 to 105 Hz) semicircle (Z2) is attributed to the impedance arising at PAGD/electrolyte interface, and the low frequency (1–102 Hz) semicircle (Z3) is attributed to the impedance value for the Nernstian diffusion of iodide ions within the electrolyte. In the inset of Fig. 14, a complex equivalent circuit consisting of three circuits from the three semicircles obtained from the Z-view software (Solarton) is presented. The semicircle Z1 yields the resistance (RCE) and capacitance (CCE) between the Al/electrolyte interface, the middle semicircle (Z2) yields the resistance (Rrc) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) between the PAGD samples and electrolyte, and finally from the Z3 semicircle the iodine ion diffusion resistance (Rd) and its diffusion capacitance (Cd) are obtained. The above resistance and capacitance values of all the DSSCs are presented in Table 3. The lifetime values (τ) of photo-injected electrons may be computed from the equation:τ = Rrc × Cμ

The τ values are also included in Table 3. It is apparent from the table that the resistances RCE and Rd are invariant with increasing GQD concentration in the samples. The shunt resistance (Rsh) of the working electrode to the counter electrode obtained from the high frequency region (>106 Hz) (Table 3) exhibits an invariant value of 10.8 ohm for all the PAGD samples. Of special interest are the Rrc and Cμ values because they are very important for governing the PCE value of the cell and depend on the active material composition of the cell. The resistance (Rrc) and capacitance (Cμ) at the PAGD/electrolyte interface increase with increasing GQD concentration, which may be attributed to the poor conductivity and good charge stabilizing properties of the GQDs relative to those of PANI, respectively. In the π-stacked state of the GQDs in the composites, charges can accumulate well and its poorer conductivity compared to that of PANI arises due to its shorter conjugation length. The high resistance (Rrc) and high lifetime values indicate a decrease in the back reaction of photo injected electrons which may increase the short circuit current. This is found to be true as the Rrc and lifetime values increase as the Jsc value increases in the composites (cf.Table 3 and Table S2†). The lifetime values show a gradual increase with increasing GQD concentration, showing a maximum value for the PAGD3 sample which thus explains the highest PCE of 3.12%. The highest resistance (Rrc), capacitance (Cμ) and lifetime values in the PAGD3 sample may arise from its well organized rod-like morphology produced from a highly ordered supramolecular structure at this optimum composition. Thus without using TiO2 as an active material we have been able to fabricate a DSSC with a PAGD hybrid showing a good power conversion efficiency.

Conclusion
In PAGD hybrids, the carboxylic acid groups of the GQDs dope PANI well as evidenced from both FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopy. The bulkier and polydentate nature of the GQD counter anions attached to the doped PANI chains cause gradual uncoiling of the chains and thus increase the conjugation length causing a red shift in the polaron band. The X-ray diffraction study suggests the presence of a lamellar structure in all the hybrids, where the GQDs reside between the PANI chains to produce the lamellar structure. The FESEM morphologies of the PAGD hybrids exhibit a change from flakes to rods with increasing GQD concentration, which was attributed to the change from flat to cylindrical lamella formation. In the PAGD composites, the dc conductivity increases by three orders compared to that of the GQDs due to doping. The I–V characteristics of the PAGD3 hybrid exhibit the highest photoresponse compared to the other hybrids and this may be attributed to easier charge separation under illuminated conditions due to the optimum matching of the energy levels of the donor and acceptor moieties. Impedance data also support the highest charge separation in the PAGD3 system. The highest power conversion efficiency (3.12%) for the DSSC fabricated with the PAGD3 hybrid suggests that the perfectly organized supramolecular rod structure composed of closely packed self organized cylindrical lamella has some important role in charge separation and movement under illuminated conditions. The impedance spectra of the DSSCs indicate the highest lifetime (4.46 ms) for the PAGD3 sample, explaining the highest PCE of 3.12% for the PAGD3 sample. So, in the fabrication of DSSCs, PAGD hybrids can be used as an active material in place of TiO2.
