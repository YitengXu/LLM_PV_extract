    , Accepted 10th January 2022First published on 14th January 2022AbstractThe use of layered perovskites is an important strategy to stabilize a formamidinium (FA) based photoactive α-FAPbI3 phase. However, the growth mechanism of FA-based layered perovskites and its influence on their physical properties have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate an inclusive study on the growth, structure and optoelectronic properties of FA-based Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type perovskites M2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 (M = benzylamine (PMA) or FA) during two-step sequential deposition, revealing the transformation of dominant layered perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to novel FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 with increasing FA:PMA ratios in precursors, and increased n values from top to bottom for the former case while a uniform distribution for the latter case. Moreover, we investigated the charge transport kinetics between quantum wells and illustrate the application of these structures in perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency that exceeds 19%, accompanied by enhanced film stability in contrast to 3D analogs.

Broader context
Layered perovskite templates by small cations are expected to be ideal materials for efficient and stable solar cells, which however remain underexplored in terms of growth, physical properties and photovoltaic applications. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 (FA = formamidinium) based solar cells and explored in detail in terms of their growth during two-step sequential deposition, structure and optoelectronic properties. We found that a higher FAI:PMAI (PMA = benzylamine) ratio in organic cations leads to the transformation of predominant Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to novel FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1. The size-dependent diffusivity of cations results in increased n values from top to bottom for the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 films while a uniform thickness distribution of the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 of quantum wells (QWs) with perpendicular orientation to the substrate. The FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs therefore exhibit more efficient charge transport. Finally, the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 based solar cells exhibit an enhanced stability and efficiency as high as 19.33%. This work may serve as a significant step toward understanding the formation of FA-based layered perovskites in the absence of solvent–precursor interactions and controlling their distribution, composition, and orientation, which provides a theoretical basis and technical guidance for stable and efficient perovskite solar cells.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent physical properties, including high carrier mobility, an adjustable band gap, and low manufacturing cost.1–6 The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction perovskite solar cells recently released by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has increased to 25.5%, showing great potential in photovoltaics.7 Generally, organic–inorganic halide perovskites adopt the chemical formula of ABX3, where A is an organic cation (e.g., methylamine (MA+) or FA+), B is a bivalent metal cation (e.g., Pb2+, Sn2+ or Ge2+), and X is a halide anion (typically Cl−, Br−, I− or their mixtures). The three-dimensional (3D) network of the perovskite structure is based on corner-sharing [BX6]4− octahedra, which are balanced with an equal number of positively charged cations residing within the small cavity spaces left behind by the metal halide network. Substituting the small A-site cation, either partially or completely, with organic cations larger than the perovskite network cavities leads to the breakup of this metal halide network into a low-dimensional structure, spatially separated by sublattices of the large cations. The inorganic framework holds great promise for optoelectronic properties, whereas organic cations themselves play a role in a vast array of interesting structural and other physical possibilities. One apparent practical application of low-dimensional structures is the enhanced stability provided by the large constituents which have higher hydrophobicity and crystal formation energy than small amines.
The first embodiments of Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type low-dimensional organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells were demonstrated by introducing phenylethylammonium (PEA+) into 3D MAPbI3, which broke the 3D structure into 2D (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10.8 Solar cells with the targeted material show a PCE of only 4.7%, however, the films were reported to provide improved stability when exposed to ambient humidity (52% relative humidity) at room temperature. After the success of this fabrication, great progress has been achieved via molecular chemistry, solution-processing, and a fundamental understanding of the physical properties of quantum wells (QWs) in films fabricated from MA-based 2D perovskites. For example, in situ analysis based on time-resolved grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) during solution casting established a fundamental understanding of phase crystallization kinetics during solution processing and its impact on the physical properties of QWs in the film.9–17 The formation of intermediate phases is important for the crystalline quality of the final film as the intermediate phases of PbI2 and PbI2-solvent solvates led to greater corrugation of the crystalline surface,18 smaller grain size, and orientation randomness of crystals. Fast fading of the solvent inhibits the formation of PbI2 crystals and the solvated phase, which in turn results in the faster insertion of organic cations into the inorganic framework. The complex formation mechanism of MA-based perovskite QWs has been well understood; this helps in achieving the desired QW distribution in the film, efficient carrier transport between QWs, and the final photovoltaic outcome.19
In contrast to these well-understood MA-based layered 2D perovskites, FA-based analogs, which are believed to be an efficient strategy for customizing the energy characteristics toward stabilizing the 3D α-FAPbI3 phase under harsh environmental and device operating conditions,20 remain under-represented to date. This is likely due to the phase instability of FAPbI3-based systems and the difficulty in obtaining high-quality FA-based layered perovskite films in contrast to MA-based analogs. For example, the FAPbI3 phase with a hexagonal (face-sharing) one-dimensional (1D) structure is favored at room temperature owing to its higher thermodynamically stability in contrast to its photoactive α-FAPbI3 phase, which adopts a cubic 3D corner-sharing [MX6]4− octahedral framework.21–23 Thus, nucleation and growth either with corner-sharing or face-sharing structures should be considered when fabricating FA-based 2D layered perovskites, which makes crystallization of FA-based 2D layered perovskites more complex in contrast to that of MA-based analogs. Meanwhile, the interaction between FA cations and [PbI6]4− octahedra is stronger24 in contrast to MA cations. FA cations interact less with the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent in contrast to MA cations, leading to a lower tendency to form a precursor–solvent intermediate phase during film formation.25 The ability to release protons to generate HI in FA-based films under light is also lower than that of MA-based films.26 Nevertheless, attempts have been made to fabricate FA-based 2D perovskites over the past few years using a number of organic cations, including butylammonium (BA+), 5-ammonium valeric acid(AVA+), benzylammonium (BN+), n-pentylammonium (PA+), 2-thiophenemethylammonium (TMA+), iso-butylammonium (IBA+), and 1-adamantylmethanammonium (ADAM+).27–29 To date, these attempts have been limited to templating layered structures using various ligands and analyzing their potential for photovoltaic applications. In contrast to the well-elucidated growth mechanism of MA-based layered perovskites from intermediate phases formed with the solvent, the growth of FA-based layered perovskites, particularly in the absence of solvent–precursor intermediate phases, has not yet been reported. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the influence of the growth mechanism on the physical and chemical compositions of FA-based layered perovskites remains to be explored.
Herein, we sought to increase the understanding of the growth of FA-based layered perovskites in the absence of solvent–precursor interactions, their structural and optoelectronic characteristics, and their application in photovoltaics based on representative RP type M2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 (M = PMA or FA) systems fabricated via two-step sequential deposition. The combination of femtosecond pump–probe transient absorption (TA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy indicated the critical role of the size and stoichiometry of the loaded precursors on the growth behaviour, composition, and thickness distribution of QWs in films. We found a transformation of dominant layered perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with increasing FAI:PMAI ratios in the loaded precursors. The PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 film exhibited gradient segregation of 3D-like phases at the bottom surface, whereas low-n QWs tended to segregate on the top surface. By contrast, the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 film showed a uniform thickness distribution of the QWs. QW orientation was investigated using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis. Furthermore, the charge transport and optoelectronic properties were investigated in detail to understand the influence of the QW structure on the emergent properties. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time the application of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 film for solar cells, achieving a PCE of above 19% with much improved phase stability in contrast to 3D FAPbI3 analogs.
Results and discussion
We first prepared FA-based layered perovskite films via two-step sequential deposition, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. First, a thin layer of PbI2 film was deposited on the TiO2 electron transport layer, followed by thermal annealing for 1 min. The PbI2 film was then coated with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solutions containing PMAI:FAI mixtures (concentration of 0.5 mol L−1) with molar ratios varying from 2:3 to 2:9 and 2:59. The three as-cast films were thermal annealed at 150 °C under ambient conditions (30–40% relative humidity) for 15 min to obtain FA-based layered perovskite films.

The morphological evolution of the FA-based layered perovskite films was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The film thickness did not change significantly with the PMAI:FAI molar ratio (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Different uniformities and grain sizes were observed for the three films (Fig. 1b). The 2:3 film exhibited densely packed grains with lengths up to ca. 1 μm, which is in contrast to the observation of 2D slices for MA-based RP perovskites.30,31 Such morphological differences might be attributed to different hydrogen bonds between the inorganic framework and FA+ or MA+ organic cations, which yield different nucleation/growth and lattice mismatches.24,32 A higher FAI ratio leads to larger grains, with their size increasing to ∼2–3 μm, which is close to what has been observed in 3D FAPbI3 thin films.30 The cross-sectional SEM images show a concrete-like appearance without obvious grain boundaries along the perpendicular direction for the 2:3 film. However, a higher FAI ratio results in more pinholes throughout the films, particularly for the 2:59 film, indicating different growth behaviors of the perovskite.
We performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses to evaluate the influence of the PMAI:FAI molar ratio on the perovskite crystal structure (Fig. 2a). All three films showed strong diffraction peaks at 14.1° and 28.2°. These peaks are slightly larger than those of the (110) plane (2θ = 13.9°) and (220) plane (27.8°) of the α-FAPbI3 phase,33 and are assigned to the (111) and (202) planes of 3D-like M2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 (M = PMA or FA) phases,34 respectively. The weak diffraction feature at 2θ = 12.8° is assigned to unreacted PbI2, which is believed to be beneficial for trap passivation at grain boundaries.35 In addition to these peaks, we also observed diffraction peaks located at 4.4° and 8.7° for both 2:3 and 2:9 films. These two peaks can also be observed in the n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite (PMA2FAPb2I7) film fabricated using one-step spin-coating (Fig. S1b, ESI†), which correspond to the (020) and (040) crystalline planes of PMA2FAPb2I7,29 respectively. This observation indicates the coexistence of the n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs and 3D-like phases in the 2:3 and 2:9 films.

We observed a decrease in the diffraction intensity of the n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs with higher FAI ratios, and the diffraction peaks completely vanished for the 2:59 film. This indicates less coherent crystallographic regions with the PMA2FAPb2I7 phase when processed from a higher FAI ratio. Importantly, although the PMA still has 2 parts in the initial precursor solution, we did not find the crystalline features of low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs for the 2:59 film, except for the (111) and (202) planes of the 3D-like phases. Instead, we observed the low-n phase of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 in the analysis that follows, so we believe that dominant layered perovskites change in the film at a high FAI ratio. Note that the lack of diffraction peaks for ordered regions with low-n QWs does not preclude their existence; instead, it might indicate merely that sufficiently coherent crystallographic regions cannot be detected by XRD.9 To better understand the formation of low-n QWs with different PMAI:FAI ratios, we used optical analysis, including UV-Vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra show a band edge at ca. 816 nm corresponding to the 3D-like phase for the three films (Fig. 2b). An additional excitonic peak of the n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite (PMA2FAPb2I7) was also observed at ca. 571 nm for the 2:3 and 2:9 films, which is consistent with the XRD observations indicating the co-existence of n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 and 3D-like phase. Interestingly, for the 2:59 film, two exciton absorption peaks appeared at ca. 497 nm and ca. 550 nm, which were assigned to FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with n = 2 and n = 3 phases according to the previous report for FAn+1PbnI3n+1 powder produced via ball-milling.36 Although the existence of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 has been predicted,37 not much is known about these materials. To better understand the growth of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 during film fabrication, we fabricated FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 films using two-step sequential deposition by introducing neat FAI on the PbI2 film, or FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 powders using ball-milling from FAI:PbI2 powders without the solvent, or FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 films via one-step spin-coating from the DMSO solvent. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns and UV-Vis absorption spectra of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 films using two-step sequential deposition. We found appearance of n = 1 (2θ = 10.0°) and n = 2 (2θ = 6.7°) FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 from the XRD patterns,37 and excitonic peaks for n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3 FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases at ca. 450, 497 and 550 nm from absorption spectra, respectively. A table was prepared showing their main characteristic diffraction peaks and plasmon bands in the films (Table S1, ESI†). Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the photographs and absorption spectra of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 powders prepared via ball-milling. We also observed strong excitonic peaks at ca. 456 nm (n = 1) and 496 nm (n = 2) for the materials. The FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 films fabricated from FAI:PbI2 (molar ratios of 4:1, 8:1, and 12:1) via one-step spin-coating from the DMSO solvent also demonstrate the formation of the n = 1 FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phase as evidenced from the absorption spectra and XRD patterns (Fig. S4, ESI†). Grazing-incidence wide angle scattering (GIWAXS) was also performed for the above three samples (Fig. S5, ESI†). Scattering diffraction peaks were observed at q = 0.48 Å−1 (FAn+1PbnI3n+1), 0.70 Å−1 (FAn+1PbnI3n+1), and 1.00 Å−1 (3D-like α-FAPbI3).36 In summary, from the observations mentioned above, the FAI:PbI2 molar ratio plays a key role in the growth of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 RP phases. Note that in the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 crystal, FA+ molecules separate the 2D layers rather than the long-chain or bulky cations typically used in other RP phases.
The PL spectra exhibited dominant emission peaks at ca. 734 nm, 780 nm, and 810 nm for the 2:3, 2:9, and 2:59 films (Fig. 2c), respectively. The red shift of the emission indicates thicker QWs within the films with increasing FAI ratios. Additionally, we found luminescence from the n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phase for the 2:3 and 2:9 films and the n = 4 FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phase for the 2:59 film. The absence of luminescence from the n = 2 and n = 3 FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases is possibly due to the energy transfer to the n = 4 phase. This observation further shows again the transformation of dominant layered perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases with increasing FAI ratios in the precursors.
Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) is a powerful characterization technique to probe the carrier decay lifetime in thin films.17 Here, a bi-exponential decay function was used to fit the TRPL spectral data (Fig. 2d),37 where τ1 and τ2 represent the lifetimes of fast recombination and slow recombination, respectively, and A1 and A2 are their relative amplitudes. The double exponential decay function is as follows:38 (1)where τ1 corresponds to the fast nonradiative recombination which is induced by defects or impurities of grains. τ2 represents the radiative recombination of the charge carriers. A1 and A2 are their relative amplitudes. The τ1 and τ2 present distinctive difference among the three cases, indicating the charge transport and recombination features in films, respectively.39 The τ1 slightly increases from 3.8 to 5.5 and 12.6 ns for the 2:3, 2:9, and 2:59 films, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). The corresponding films exhibit a prominent augment of τ2 from 36.4 to 84.0 and 297.0 ns with higher FAI ratios. The significant improvement in the emission lifetime indicates much improved charge transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination of the 2:59 film, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). This might be due to the high exciton binding energy of M2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs and carrier transport between different M2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs, which play important roles in the carrier transport mechanism. For example, compared to 3D-like phases, MA-based low-n perovskite QWs have relatively shorter carrier lifetime, partially due to higher exciton binding energy.40–42 Based on MA-based low-n perovskite QWs, the QW polydispersity was found to be another critical factor influencing the carrier transport between QWs.41,43
The QW polydispersity was further determined in the 2:3 and 2:59 films using TA spectroscopy with a femtosecond laser pulse. Fig. 3a shows the TA spectra probed at selected delay times with front and back photoexcitation for the representative 2:3 and 2:59 films. Bleaching peaks were observed at ca. 574, 638, 682, and 792 nm in the 2:3 film, which correspond to the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs with n = 2, 3, 4 and 3D-like phases. Note that the bleaching intensity of the low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs was stronger when the QWs were photoexcited from the top surface than from the bottom, indicating a preferential segregation of the low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs near the top surface, along with more 3D-like phases near the bottom surface. The 2:59 film exhibited peaks at ca. 553, 595, and 791 nm, which are assigned to the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs with n = 3, 4 and 3D-like phases (Fig. 3b), respectively. The relative contribution of different QWs was quantified roughly from the TA top/bottom-spectra and is summarized in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†). For the 2:3 film, a preferential segregation was observed for the 2:3 film with low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs near the top surface while high-n phases close to substrate surface. However, the 2:59 film exhibits a uniform distribution of low-n FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs along the perpendicular direction. The thickness distribution of PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 or FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs along the perpendicular direction was in sharp contrast to what have been observed previously for MA-based low-n perovskite QWs fabricated via one-step strategies,44–46 The underlying formation mechanism is discussed next.

The charge transfer kinetics from low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 or low-n FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs to 3D-like phases were compared and are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. At short time intervals (<1 ps), the TA signals corresponding to low-n QWs and 3D-like phases all present a rising trend corresponding to the population. The signals of low-n QWs are much faster than those of 3D-like phases in both PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 and FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 films. Interestingly, the TA rise of 3D-like phases is accompanied by the TA decay of the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 and FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs. This finding is consistent with what has been observed for MA-based 3D/2D perovskite films and should be ascribed to carrier transport from low-n FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 or low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs to 3D-like phases.30,43 We observed a faster decay of the TA signal initially generated at low times (∼0.5–1 ps) within the low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs, followed by a plateau-like feature up to ∼100 ps and a slower decay afterward. By contrast, the TA signal decays much faster for the low-n FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs in contrast to the low-n PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs. This unambiguously indicates faster carrier transport from low-n FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs to 3D-like phases in contrast to the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 case, and which can be partially ascribed to less energy barriers between the low-n phases and high-n phases for the former case.47
Based on the aforementioned analyses, it can be concluded that the n = 1 phase is inhibited either in the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 or FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 cases during two-step sequential deposition. Previous studies have shown that the n = 1 phase tends to be aligned parallel to the substrate and is unfavorable for carrier transport in the device.48 This peculiarity may indicate efficient charge transport in these three films. A key merit of the PMAI:FAI ratio in precursors is that a higher FAI ratio leads to the transformation of dominant layered perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1. Interestingly, the films exhibited increased n values from top to bottom for the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 case, whereas a uniform distribution of n values was observed along the perpendicular direction for the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 case. These observations are in contrast to what have been commonly observed from previous MA-based low-dimensional perovskite films obtained from one-step spin-coating.13,15 During one-step fabrication, precursors and solvents (e.g., DMSO or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)) tend to form crystalline intermediate phases,13,15 which then provide a framework that releases PbI2 during thermal annealing to nucleate and grow low-n perovskite QWs.9 Therefore, the solvent plays a key in controlling the QW formation and distribution. By contrast, the QW formation during two-step deposition does not follow this pathway because of the absence of DMF or DMSO solvents. Furthermore, the distinct thickness distribution of M2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs with organic cations varying from PMA to FA suggests that the organic cation is another influencing factor for the QW formation.
We attempted to connect this specific phase distribution with growth behavior during the two-step sequential deposition (Fig. 4). During one-step spinning, all the components are together and evolve in time before the deposition on the substrate surface. During two-step sequential deposition, however, the amine salt solution and PbI2 are separated and do not react with each other until the second step when they are in contact together and then ionic diffusion begins. Note that intermediate phases will not be generated during two-step sequential deposition because of the absence of DMSO or DMF solvents. During the conversion of PbI2 to perovskites after FAI:PMAI loading, FA cations diffuse and incorporate faster to the PbI2 layer underneath than the PMA cations because of the smaller ionic radius. As such, smaller organic cations were consumed in the lower part of the film, leaving a higher concentration of larger cations for the rest of the film, which would explain the preferential segregation of 3D-like phases near the bottom, whereas 2D phases existed closed to the surface, as observed for the 2:3 and 2:9 cases. This ionic diffusion-determined QW growth is in contrast to what we have previously observed during one-step deposition, where the formation energy of different QWs dominates their growth from solvents, resulting in low-n QWs at the bottom and 3D-like phases near the surface of the films.49,50 For the 2:59 case, given insufficient PMA cations, the overloaded FA cations dominated the QW growth, leading to a uniform distribution of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1.

Examining the crystal orientation of the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 and FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases in the films is of interest because of their critical role in charge transport. We performed grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. The 2D GIWAXS patterns of the 2:3, 2:9 and 2:59 films obtained at the same incidence angle (0.15°) are shown in Fig. 5a–c. The line-cut profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are shown in Fig. 5d and e, respectively. The corresponding crystal orientations are shown in Fig. 5f and g. The 2:3 film exhibited 3D-like phases at q = 1.01 A−1, and n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs at q = 0.31 and 0.62 A−1. These diffractions are also observed for the 2:9 film, with a stronger diffraction intensity for the 3D-like phases and weaker diffraction intensity for the n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phase, in contrast to the 2:3 film. Given that GIWAXS is more sensitive to the crystalline phases near the film surface at the limited penetration depth of X-rays, the aforementioned changes in the diffraction intensity can therefore be attributed to a smaller amount of 2D PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases near the film surface with increasing FAI ratios. Interestingly, consistent with what has been observed in the optical spectra (Fig. 2 and 3), further increasing the FAI ratio leads to the transformation of dominant layered perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases; the corresponding diffractions were observed at q = 0.48 and 0.76 A−1. It is important to note that the 2D GIWAXS patterns for the 2:3 film exhibited much stronger diffractions for both n = 2 PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 and 3D-like phases along the out-of-plane direction, in contrast to the in-plane direction, suggesting the preferential parallel orientation of the crystals. The 3D-like phases become more random with increasing FAI ratios for the 2:9 and 2:59 films. In contrast to the parallel oriented PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases, we found that the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases are more oriented perpendicular to the substrate, as evidenced by the arcs along the in-plane direction. Such perpendicular orientation of FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases is believed to be beneficial for charge transport in a complete solar cell.

Finally, perovskite solar cells were fabricated with the n-i-p architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 6a). The maximum and average photovoltaic parameters of the three devices are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The PCE distributions and representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 6b and c, respectively. The devices deliver average PCEs of 8.46 (±0.87)%, 12.81 (±0.55)%, and 17.46 (±0.73)% for the 2:3, 2:9, and 2:59 films, respectively. Clearly, the efficiency increases with a higher FAI ratio, which is reasonable because of the more efficient carrier transport from low-n QWs to 3D-like phases in the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 film, in contrast to the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 case. The increase in PCEs is mainly attributed to the enhancement of short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The open-circuit voltage (VOC) decreased from 1.11 (±0.02) to 1.06 (±0.02) V. We achieved a PCE of up to 19.33% for the 2:59 film, with a JSC of 25.04 mA cm−2, an FF of 71.98%, and a VOC of 1.07 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 based perovskite solar cell.

(g–i) Dark I–V measurement of the electron only device for the 2:3, 2:9 and 2:59 films. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra show a higher photoresponse for the 2:59 films than for the 2:9 and 2:3 films (Fig. 6d–f), which is probably related to the increased number of 3D-like phases for the former; this can improve the light harvesting capabilities. The integrated current from the EQE spectra is 18.19 mA cm−2, 23.13 mA cm−2, and 25.08 mA cm−2 for the 2:3, 2:9, and 2:59 cells, respectively, which are in agreement with the JSC measured from the J–V characteristics under simulated illumination.
To help explain the enhanced photovoltaic efficiencies from an optoelectronic standpoint, we investigated the charge transport and charge recombination in the three films using space-charge-limit-current (SCLC) analysis. The dark J–V characteristics of electron-only devices based on the architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag are shown in Fig. 6g–i for the three films. The trap density was determined using the following equation:51 (2)where q is the elemental charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, εr is the relative permittivity (62.3), and ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1). The electron mobility μ was further extracted according to the Mott–Gurney law:22 (3)where L is the thickness of the perovskite film, V is the applied bias voltage, and JD is the dark current density. The trap densities were determined to be 2.45 × 1016, 8.60 × 1015, and 7.21 × 1015 cm−3 for the 2:3, 2:9, and 2:59 devices, respectively. As the FAI ratio increased, the trap density of the films decreased slightly. This finding corroborates our TRPL results and supports the notion that the transformation of dominant layered perovskites within the film from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 leads to a slight decrease in non-radiative recombination. Owing to the more efficient carrier transport from low-n QWs to 3D-like phases in the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 film in contrast to the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 case, we observed an increased electron mobility from 0.012 to 0.078 and 0.139 cm2 V−1 when the FAI ratio was gradually increased. Thus, we conclude that the superior performance of the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 device was derived from the significantly enhanced carrier transport from low-n QWs to 3D-like phases and the slightly reduced grain boundaries in these films.
Finally, we explored the stability of neat FAPbI3 and 2:3, 2:9, 2:59 films, all of which were fabricated via the two-step sequential deposition method. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows a photograph of the aforementioned four films during aging for 30 days under ambient conditions (25 °C and 40–50% relative humidity). We observed a color change from dark to gray just after 3 days for the neat FAPbI3 film, which has been commonly attributed to the transformation from the α-phase to the δ-phase and/or perovskite decomposition.11 By contrast, the films with FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 or PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases exhibited excellent phase stability, which was further confirmed via XRD analysis (Fig. 7a). We observed an appearance of the δ-FAPbI3 for the neat FAPbI3 film after aging for only 1 day, which was delayed to >10 days for the 2:59 film. There was basically no change in the 2:3 and 2:9 films. We calculated the relative peak intensity ratio between the δ-FAPbI3 and α-FAPbI3 for the neat FAPbI3, 2:59, 2:9, and 2:3 films during aging (Fig. 7b). Excellent phase stability was demonstrated by the 2:3, 2:9, and 2:59 films, which was expected to enhance the structural stability of the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 or PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 phases. We further investigated the environmental stability of PSC devices based on 2:3 and 2:59 films. Fig. 7c and Fig. S8 (ESI†) show the performance parameter evolution of the unencapsulated devices under ambient conditions with about 40–50% relative humidity. The 2:3 devices retained around 84% of its initial efficiency after 120 h, which was higher than the 2:59 devices (ca. 63%). This agrees well with the XRD analysis. These results are consistent with the previously reported results, where the larger n values of layered perovskites contribute to higher efficiency but inferior stability.52

Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully synthesized FA-based low-dimensional perovskite M2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 (M = PMA/FA) via two-step sequential deposition and explored the growth mechanism in the absence of solvated intermediates and their structure–property relationship. A key merit of the PMAI:FAI ratio in precursors is that a higher FA ratio leads to the transformation of dominant layered perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1. Interestingly, the films exhibited increased n values from top to bottom in the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 film. Meanwhile a uniform distribution of n values along the vertical direction for the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 case was observed. Such a difference of n distribution is driven by ionic-diffusivity-dominated QW growth in the absence of solvated intermediates. FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 exhibited more efficient charge transport between QWs and a longer carrier charge lifetime in the crystals, in contrast to PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1. In addition, we demonstrated a FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite solar cell for the first time with a champion PCE of 19.33%. Moreover, these layered perovskites exhibited enhanced environmental stability corresponding to neat FAPbI3, which was fabricated and stored under the same conditions. Overall, the novel 2D perovskite structure templated by small cations not only increases the “playground” for structure modulation, but also improves the absorption spectrum range and improves the thermal and light stability for optoelectronic devices. We believe that the results may serve as a significant step toward understanding the formation of FA-based layered perovskites in the absence of solvent–precursor interactions and controlling their distribution, composition, and orientation, which provides a theoretical basis and technical guidance for stable and efficient perovskite solar cells.

Broader context
Layered perovskite templates by small cations are expected to be ideal materials for efficient and stable solar cells, which however remain underexplored in terms of growth, physical properties and photovoltaic applications. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 (FA = formamidinium) based solar cells and explored in detail in terms of their growth during two-step sequential deposition, structure and optoelectronic properties. We found that a higher FAI:PMAI (PMA = benzylamine) ratio in organic cations leads to the transformation of predominant Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites from PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 to novel FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1. The size-dependent diffusivity of cations results in increased n values from top to bottom for the PMA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 films while a uniform thickness distribution of the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 of quantum wells (QWs) with perpendicular orientation to the substrate. The FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 QWs therefore exhibit more efficient charge transport. Finally, the FA2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 based solar cells exhibit an enhanced stability and efficiency as high as 19.33%. This work may serve as a significant step toward understanding the formation of FA-based layered perovskites in the absence of solvent–precursor interactions and controlling their distribution, composition, and orientation, which provides a theoretical basis and technical guidance for stable and efficient perovskite solar cells.
