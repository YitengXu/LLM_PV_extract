    , Accepted 12th October 2020First published on 20th October 2020AbstractDuring the last few years, the use of additive manufacturing technologies, also known as 3D printing, has become increasingly popular in laboratories and research facilities. The reduced costs of printers and the large availability of different materials facilitate the adoption of this technology over established fabrication processes generally more costly and time-consuming. The use of 3D printing for the fabrication of electrochemical components is only at a very initial phase but has shown promising results in terms of research and developments of innovative and better performing devices for both energy and synthetic applications. However, a complete understanding of the benefits and limitations of the available 3D printing methods as well as a careful evaluation of the material properties is necessary to fully exploit this technology. A short description of the most commonly adopted 3D printing methods and principles is provided here as a useful foundation prior to the description of their most recent uses for electrochemical flow systems towards energy-related applications, electrosynthesis, water splitting and spectroelectrochemistry. A final discussion of possible future directions will be also given.Adriano AmbrosiAdriano Ambrosi received his Ph.D. degree from Dublin City University (Ireland) in 2007.

1. Introduction
Electrochemical devices can be generally described as systems that facilitate conversions between chemical energy and electrical energy. It simply requires two conductive solids (electrodes) immersed into an ionically conducting solution (electrolyte) and externally connected with an electrical circuit. Chemical oxidation and reduction reactions occur at each electrode/electrolyte interface in concomitance with a flow of an electronic current at the external circuit and an ionic current in solution. If the reactions occur spontaneously, the system is termed galvanic or voltaic and is used to generate electricity (such as fuel cells and batteries in discharge mode). In contrast, other systems, known as electrolysers, can force non-spontaneous redox reactions to occur at the electrode surface by inputting electrical energy through the generation of a potential difference between the electrodes (such as batteries in charging mode).1
Electrolytic systems can be used conveniently in many different industrial applications including the synthesis of organic and inorganic products, metal extractions, water purification, energy storage and energy production. Electrosynthesis is certainly an important industrial application where electrons are used as reactants instead of chemical compounds to drive chemical reactions.2 This type of approach enables great control of the reaction, eliminates the use of hazardous oxidants and reductants, facilitates recycling of unreacted chemicals, is environmental friendly and it is generally more economical compared to traditional processes.3 Simultaneous production of chlorine gas and caustic soda (NaOH) by electrolysis of salty water solutions and aluminium extraction and purification from bauxite ore can be taken as significant examples of industrial-scale productions. Another important process is the so-called water splitting in which hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced by electrolysis of pure water upon the application of a threshold potential difference. These processes combined with renewable sources of electrical energy could drive future transitions to “green chemistry” and clean hydrogen-based economies.1,4
Combining instead two reactions with significant chemical potential difference can drive a spontaneous flow of electrons and therefore constituting the foundation of energy storage and energy production devices. Fuel cells or redox flow batteries represent important examples of electrochemical galvanic systems. While all the above processes can be carried out in batch reactors, that is in a static reaction vessel, significant performance improvements, better control and efficiencies have been achieved by switching to a flow technology.3 Continuous-flow electrochemical processes are seen as an appealing opportunity for industrial chemical synthesis and large-scale energy storage applications.5
3D-printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has recently attracted enormous attention from research institutions and manufacturing industries.6–8 A technology initially utilized for prototyping, artistic realizations and medical implant purposes, has grown now into a potentially disrupting manufacturing technology to be used for industrial scale fabrication of final products for commercial aims.9 However, it is envisioned that a smart and carefully balanced combination of traditional (subtracting or formative manufacturing) and 3D printing could provide the optimal approach for industrial manufacturing depending on the design complexity of the object, the volume requested and material costs.
Innovative solutions, and performance device improvements can only be achieved by using additive manufacturing technologies because they enable faster and more economical realization of initial prototypes and almost-market-ready functional devices. This has been recently realized for the fabrication of functional components and parts of electrochemical systems, both for electrosynthesis and energy-related applications, demonstrating impactful advantages over traditional fabrication methodologies particularly for flow systems.10–12 In this review, we provide a basic understanding of the most commonly adopted 3D printing technologies and their uses in fabricating functional electrolytic devices, water splitting electrolyzers and flow microreactors for different synthetic applications and also energy-related flow devices such as redox flow batteries (RFBs) and microbial and solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). A short section on the use of additive manufacturing technologies for spectroelectrochemical applications is also included as a special case of electrosynthesis.
2. 3D-Printing technologies
Additive manufacturing is one of the automated manufacturing processes (AMPs) that can be employed today for the fabrication of objects and devices. Different conceptually from the traditional formative and subtracting manufacturing, it possesses the potential to revolutionize industrial manufacturing.6,13 Among the advantages can be considered the ability to create complex structures, the significantly reduced waste of raw starting materials, the ability to provide rapid prototyping, faster product development, easy customization and the possibility of on-demand production. Formative manufacturing (injection moulding, bending, forging, etc.) is preferred only for simple designed objects and large-scale productions due to the high costs of the machine components and moulds. Subtracting manufacturing (drilling, sawing, cutting, milling, etc.) is well-established but suffers from the generation of a massive material waste and the limited ability to create hollow sections and complex structures.14
3D printing works with a bottom-up approach in which the raw starting material is deposited layer-by-layer following the instructions of a digital model (CAD design) with a fully automated and autonomous laying process/tool until the final object is created. It appears evident how this approach can reduce material waste by using only the amount required to actually build the object and enabling at the same time almost infinite design possibilities. In general, a 3D printing process consists of three fundamental steps: (i) creation of a digital design of the object to be produced by means of a CAD 3D modelling software, a 3D scanner or photogrammetry techniques; (ii) conversion of the digital design into a multi-layered (sliced) structure by firstly approximating the 3D object surface into a series of triangles (tessellation, STL file), followed by the actual slicing procedure (g-code file) carried out by a slicing software which can dictate the number and density of the layers in the structure prior to printing; (iii) deposition/creation of each layer sequentially using the printing machine fed with the specific raw material. Often, post-processing operations are required to harden, paint, finish or clean the as-printed objects before their use.12 Many different 3D printing technologies are available today and several more are under continuous development to propose innovative ways to create or deposit the material layers, to make faster processes, introduce novel materials to be processed, lower the costs or enhance the resolution.
A simple and convenient way to categorize and distinguish the most common 3D printing techniques is based on the nature of the starting material employed for the process. These can be liquid, solid or in powder form. Table 1 summarizes the principal features of the most commonly adopted 3D printing methods as well as useful corresponding references where more detailed information can be gathered if necessary.

2.1. Liquid based systems
These types of systems employ a raw material in a liquid state which must be solidified during the printing process to generate each solid layer. The most commonly used method is based on liquid photopolymer resins which solidify upon exposure to UV light. Here monomer and photo initiator components polymerize through a free radical generation during a process that is defined stereolithography (SL). Different configurations are possible: vat configuration in which the resin is contained in a vat and an UV laser scans the liquid surface to solidify and cure the first material layer attached to a platform. The platform lowers sequentially to allow more liquid to cover each layer and ready to be cured by the laser (Fig. 1A). Bat configuration uses the opposite orientation in which the platform rises and the curing process is given from a transparent window at the bottom with a digitally controlled light projection (DLP). Jet configuration uses ink-jet technology to deposit small drops of the liquid resin onto the stage according to the layer design; then a wide UV light source is scanned over the entire stage surface to solidify and cure the layer. The stage lowers to repeat the process for the following layers till the whole object is created. Using multiple ink-jet heads is possible and enables multi-color or multi-material printing (polyjet, multi-jet technologies) (Fig. 1B).15 Another 3D printing technology based on photopolymerization uses two photons (lasers) at slightly different wavelengths which solidify extremely small focal regions of special photocurable resins within the liquid matrix and not at the surface. This technology called two-photon polymerization (2 PP) is capable of extremely high resolution and has found applications in the nano and sub-micrometer scale 3D printing16,17 including possible uses for fabrication of membranes (see Section 3.3) (Fig. 1C).

2.2. Solid based systems
The most commonly used 3D printers employ thermoplastic solid filaments as the starting material. With a process so-called fused deposition modelling (FDM), the solid filament goes through a liquefaction process inside a heating chamber immediately before extrusion from a metallic nozzle with sub-mm diameter openings. The liquefied thermoplastic can therefore be deposited over a building stage kept at lower temperature and where the material solidifies again. Either by lowering the stage or raising the extrusion head, multiple layers can be allocated and linked one on top of the other until the final object is created. Due to its simplicity and the large availability of the thermoplastic materials, this 3D printing method is the most widespread in industry, art, research, medicine and hobby activities. A large selection of materials is available such as polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS) and Nylon with several different mechanical properties from hard and durable to flexible and soft. This methodology is particularly useful to generate prototypes and investigate flow systems for electrochemical devices.18–20 Innovative machines are available today to use FDM technology to also print metals and composites, significantly reducing the costs for the fabrication of such valuable engineering components.
A particular type of extrusion method called direct ink writing (DIW) or robocasting, is based on viscoelastic materials that can be extruded by syringe-like tools.21 The materials should have special mechanical properties that allows them to stay sufficiently liquid to be extruded from small orifices but at the same time highly viscous to retain the shape once deposited. This technology offers the largest freedom of possible materials since paste composites can be obtained from any type of material ranging from metals, ceramics, plastics, glass and nanomaterials to name just a few. However significant process time is required to optimize the rheological properties of the composites before printing and also a post-processing treatment is always necessary to harden or stabilize the printed object.22
Laminated object manufacturing (LOM) employs solid materials that are available in sheets. These could be metals, paper, plastic, etc. Each sheet corresponds to a single layer of the object to be printed. A cutting system (laser, blade, etc.) define the sheet contours according to the digital instruction and then a binding process is actuated to firmly bind each layer one on top of the other. This can be done using a glue spraying, soldering, pressing or similar means.23 While important for certain applications, LOM is not generally employed for the fabrication of electrolytic systems and components.
2.3. Powder based systems
An extremely versatile 3D printing technology is based on solid starting materials but in powder form (particles between 50–100 μm diameter) that represent the building blocks of the final printed object. The difference between the various technologies in this category lies in the way such particles are bound together to create the solid layers. Conceptually similarly to stereolithography, selective laser sintering (SLS)24,25 and selective laser melting (SLM)26,27 employ highly energetic lasers to sinter (power ∼ 100 W) or melt (power between 100–1000 W) a thin layer of particles distributed homogeneously over a building stage according to the CAD instructions. Once the layer is solidified due to the linkage of the laser-exposed particles, the operation is repeated with successive particle layers arranged one on top of the other while the stage lowers. There is a large selection of materials that can be adopted for this technology ranging from plastic, ceramic, glass to metals or anything that can be offered in powder form. Clearly the higher the melting temperature of the material, the higher the laser power that is required. Electron beam melting (EBM) lasers have been also employed to bind metal particles with high melting temperatures such as precious metals and strong alloys used especially in aerospace applications.26,28 A more economical approach to link (bind) the particles is based on the use of chemical agents (similarly to glue) that can be jetted precisely and rapidly at exact locations via ink-jet technology (Binder jetting). By varying the chemical nature of the glue and the type of material powder, different mechanical properties can be achieved for the printed components. Such a technology is capable of faster and better finishing product production compared to laser sintering and can be applied to plastic, ceramic and composites materials. Recent developments by the company HP brought significant improvements in the resulting mechanical properties of the objects by inventing a variation of the binder jetting technology called Multi Jet Fusion (MJF). It is based on a combination of binder agents that facilitate heat fusion and IR absorbing agents used to prevent fusion outside the contour edges of the object. A following IR light irradiation can provide precise local heating only where the binder agents are located, fusing the particles in the defined spot and achieving better finishing and solidity. Beside plastic powder materials, the company extended this technology to metal powder.29 Post printing operations are always needed for powder-based printing such as brushing to clean the object from residual particles, curing to further harden it and finishing to improve its surface appearance.
2.4. Material considerations on the use of 3D printing for the fabrication of electrochemical systems
Electrochemical systems for both batch and flow applications require two typologies of materials for their assembly: (i) conductive materials used to build the electrode components and (ii) structural non-conductive materials used to fabricate reactors, separators, flow channel distributors, other gas and/or liquid handling components and the protecting casing.10 For several electrochemical applications such as water splitting or batteries, a membrane is also necessary to separate gaseous products or reactive precursors.30 Each of these components must be carefully designed and assembled to achieve the best possible device performance. They can be manufactured using 3D printing technologies but a clear understanding of their operations and limitations is necessary in order to select the appropriate printing process and materials in relation to the specific task attributed to each component. For example, for liquid handling components, it is necessary to employ a 3D printing method able to create water-tight objects.31 FDM for instance might not be the optimal choice in this case due to the presence of small layer gaps when inter-layer adhesion is not perfect, unless a post printing operation is introduced to improve the hydrophobicity and reduce the porosity such as heating or painting. Equally crucial is the nature of the solutions that are in contact with the device components.32 It appears clear that organic solutions impose more strict criteria for selection of the component materials due to possible chemical incompatibility.33 Aqueous based electrolytes are generally less corrosive unless strong acidic or alkaline solutions are used. Electrodes represent the key element of every electrochemical system since their characteristics can have a profound effect on the efficiency of the electrochemical reaction.10–12,34 They need to be highly conductive, resistant to continuous usage, highly catalytic and typically preferred with a large active surface area. Metal based electrodes in stainless steel or titanium are generally preferred for long-term applications, although sometimes carbon-based electrodes are also employed. In both cases, surface modification/functionalization with an additional catalytic compound is often applied to introduce specific or more efficient catalytic properties for certain processes. These post fabrication processes must be clearly taken into account when selecting the manufacturing technology. The great advantage in the use of additive manufacturing methods is fast prototyping which opens the possibility of exploring more innovative solutions for these devices. Such solutions were previously not applicable using traditional manufacturing due to the high costs for small volume productions. Additive manufacturing offers cheaper prototyping options and therefore, several product iterations can be tested and analysed with great accuracy before conventional manufacturing can be used for large-scale commercialization.
2.5. Advances in the use of 3D printing for membrane fabrication
Membranes represent an important component for several electrochemical systems where a careful separation between the anodic and cathodic compartment is required while preserving ion exchange. While solutions have been proposed in some applications that overcome the use of membranes, it is important to note that an emerging research field is focusing on the use of 3D printing technologies for the fabrication of innovative membrane modules and components with better performance that can be implemented in various applications including desalination, filtration, gas separation and of course electrochemistry. Here we provide an update on the recent advances in this field that holds great potential for the future.
Depending on the type of separation application, the pore size of membranes ranges between sub-nanometre scales for reverse osmosis (RO) to micrometre scale for microfiltration (MF) systems. This represents undoubtedly the main obstacle limiting the use of 3D printing methods for their direct fabrication.35 Resolution of current additive manufacturing technologies ranges between sub-micrometer to millimetre scale and are therefore inherently inadequate to be used for membrane fabrication. Up to the present date, only two-photon polymerization (2PP) additive manufacturing methodology is able to reach sub-micrometre resolution but understandably with significant limitations in terms of materials available and build speeds.16 Despite such limitations, 3D printing techniques have been adopted for the fabrication not only of important components that constitute membrane modules such as spacers and support structures, but also membranes. Wessling and collaborators are among the most active in studying innovative fabrication methods for membrane technology including important theoretical validations. In 2014, they presented a photolithographic method (Digital Light Processing, DLP) to fabricate free-standing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes with a three dimensional porous structure for the gas–liquid-contacting applications.36 The resulted 3D structure was crucial for the membrane performance and most importantly, it was obtained using a single-step direct fabrication method (Fig. 2A). In another work, the same group fabricated PDMS membranes with various triple-periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structure geometries using the moulding technique with a sacrificial resist. The mould structures were fabricated by the rapid prototyping DLP technique (Fig. 2B).37 With the possibility to fabricate membranes with more complex 3D structures, studies to correlate geometry to membrane performance were also carried out.38 With a different fabrication methodology called dual electrospray (DES) which possesses similarities with extrusion based 3D printing technologies, Lim et al.39 successfully obtained a homogeneous blend of two different polyelectrolytes, Nafion and multiblock sulfonated hydrocarbon copolymer (sBlock), which are thermodynamically immiscible. In such way, a thin membrane film with a Nafion structure and also with the enhanced proton conductivity derived by the sBlock was achieved (Fig. 2C). A special and innovative 3D printing technology called CLIP, which stands for Continuous Liquid Interface Production,40 has been used by Mecham et al. to fabricate thin film membranes to study the structure–performance relationship of various membrane geometries.41 The methodology uses a fast photopolymerization process similar to DLP.40

In another work Seo et al.42 used a custom photolithographic 3D printing method to fabricate an anion exchange membrane (AEM) with a photocurable resin consisting in diurethane dimethacrylate (DUDA), poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEGDA), dipentaerythritol penta-/hexa-acrylate, and 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC). Membranes with both a flat and a patterned design were produced and compared in terms of water uptake, ionic resistance and permselectivity. A similar approach was followed by Wardrip et al.43 who used a maskless lithographic patterning technique to modify the surface of an ultrafiltration commercial membrane for waste water treatment with different polymers: N-(3-sulfopropyl)-N-(methacryloxyethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium betaine (DMAB), polyethylene glycolmethacrylate (PEGMA) and methacrylic acid (MA) in parallel or perpendicular patterning designs. Such patterned membranes demonstrated enhanced anti-fouling properties with significant reduction of bacteria growth and immobilization. An interesting application of 3D printing for membrane fabrication is shown in the works of Mattia and collaborators who firstly fabricated a membrane support in ABS-like material by means of a polyjet photocuring 3D printer and then deposited a thin membrane film of polyethersulfone (PES) onto the surface by vacuum filtration. The advantage of using this approach is that the plastic support can have arbitrary 3D architectures which can improve the membrane anti-fouling behaviour. In particular, the authors demonstrated that a wavy structure can significantly improve the permeance, rejection and cleanability of the membrane compared with a flat structure (Fig. 2D).44,45 Beside the use of 3D printing for the fabrication or modification of membrane composites, it is also important to highlight its use for the fabrication of additional components that play important roles in the optimal functioning of the membranes. In particular, it has been demonstrated that spacers and turbulence promoters 3D printed with innovative designs can significantly improve mass transfer, anti-fouling ability and fractionation selectivity in ultrafiltration systems.46,47
3. 3D-Printing for water splitting processes
Water splitting can be considered a special case among the electrolytic processes, due to its simplicity and the potential to solve or significantly alleviate future world energy problems.
In water splitting electrolysers, a voltage is applied between two metallic electrodes to drive reduction of protons at the cathode to generate H2 gas and concurrently, oxidation of water at the anode with production of O2 gas according to the general reaction:H2O + electric energy → H2 + ½O2
Generally, a physical barrier or an ionic permeable membrane divides the electrolytic bath into two compartments to keep the produced H2 and O2 gases separated.
If combined with renewable energy sources, water splitting possesses the potential to drive the transition to a clean hydrogen-based economy. H2 gas can be used as a fuel by burning with oxygen (or air), releasing an enormous amount of energy and only water as a by-product, eliminating completely greenhouse gas pollution. Or alternatively it can be used in fuel cell electric motors in combination with oxygen to produce electricity with only heat and water as by-products. The biggest obstacle for the implementation of this technology is the low process efficiency and the high energy costs needed to achieve sufficient splitting voltage thresholds. Two electrolyser configurations are available: (i) using alkaline electrolytes (KOH) and low-cost catalysts (e.g. Ni) or (ii) acidic electrolytes with proton exchange membrane (PEM) systems which can produce larger amounts of gases but requires costly polymeric membranes and catalysts (e.g. Pt, Ir). Due to these low efficiency issues, a significant research effort is directed to find better performing electrocatalysts and/or innovative system designs with the aim to reduce the overpotential needed to drive the electrosynthesis and therefore, reduce the overall process costs. In this sense, 3D printing has been envisioned as a precious tool to help solving several problems of water electrolysers since it offers the possibility to investigate more efficient device designs, fabricate more cost-effective electrodes with high catalytic properties and fabricate less costly components. In the following sections, examples in the use of 3D printing technologies for the fabrication of innovative water electrolyser components and systems are classified conveniently based on the use of separating membranes, or adoptions of membrane-less approaches with the aim of significantly reducing the production costs and simplifying the production and maintenance of the electrolyser.
3.1. Membrane-based water splitting
Water splitting electrolysers working in acidic conditions and with the adoption of PEM separation systems demonstrate enhanced performances compared to the alkaline based electrolysers but require material components with special mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, which make them more expensive to be fabricated. Reducing the overall fabrication and assembly costs of such type of devices would represent a significant step towards a more convenient adoption of the technology. A pioneering work in 2014 was carried out by Chisholm et al. who adopted 3D printing methods to fabricate light weight flow plates for a PEM electrolyser.48 In this work, the authors used a FDM printing system to create flow plates in polypropylene (PP) material. A silver coating procedure was then adopted to infer conductive properties to the plates prior to the fabrication with a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) commercially available. This work is one of the first showing the potential use of 3D printing for electrochemical device fabrication that can find useful output not only at prototype levels but also as a proof of concept for low-cost large-scale component manufacturing. The assembled device demonstrated excellent performance, comparable with electrolysers with expensive laser engraved metal flow plates. A similar strategy was followed by Hudkins et al. who printed the electrolyser housing with ABS and the flow plates with PLA that were subsequently electroplated with Ni.49 These components that were combined with a titanium current collector and a commercial MEA made an efficient water splitting electrolyser. The authors compared the performance of the PLA-Ni plated plate with that of a Ni alloy machine plate generally adopted in commercial setups. From electrochemical tests, the electrolyser using the 3D-printed PLA-Ni plates was able to reach 100 mA cm−2 current density with an applied potential of 2.2 V, while the one with the Ni alloy plate required a potential of 2.3 V. Similarly, a chronoamperometry experiment showed that with an external potential applied of 2.0 V, the electrolyser with PLA-Ni plate reached a current of 50 mA cm−2versus 30 mA cm−2 achieved with the Ni alloy plates (Fig. 3A).

Mo et al. used electron beam melting (EBM) to fabricate liquid/gas diffusion layers (LGDL) to be tested in PEM electrolyser cells (PEMECs).50 LGDLs, also called porous transport layers (PTLs), facilitate the transport of electrons, heat, water reactants and gas products between the bipolar plate and the catalyst layer, all while minimizing current, voltage, thermal and fluidic losses. In this work, authors employed titanium powder as the raw material to create the bespoke three-dimensional Ti based LGDL with high corrosion resistance and a well-defined porous structure. The assembled device demonstrated an 8% increase in performance compared to a conventional electrolyser using woven diffusion layers. The same group later used the SLM technique to fabricate the bipolar plate in stainless steel (SS) and use it in a conventional electrolyser system as-printed51 (Fig. 3B) and after electrochemical coating with gold.52 The use of an Au layer significantly reduced the interfacial resistance and provided better performance than devices employing the SS plates or conventional graphite plates. Additive manufacturing allows the fabrication of components with innovative design that can simplify assembly and overall fabrication. A good example of this concept is illustrated by Yang et al. who used the SLM technique to fabricate a specially designed single component that can function simultaneously as the current collector, flow plate, gas/liquid distributor and gasket thus significantly simplifying the electrolyser production.53 This powerful example is enabled by the possibility to design and fabricate metallic components with complex internal structures using a single-step additive manufacturing process (Fig. 3C). The electrolyser demonstrated extraordinary performances for hydrogen production over 86% efficiency with an overall potential of 1.71 V at a current density of 2 A cm−2. The same group recently proposed a different electrolyser design incorporating 3D printed non-conductive bipolar plates using the FDM technique and PLA material.54 Current flow and collection is provided by titanium gas/liquid distributors sandwiched between the MEA and the bipolar plates. This simplified design further reduced the overall cost of device fabrication providing good performance for hydrogen production with an overpotential of 2.2 V at 1 A cm−2 current density and at room temperature.
3.2. Membrane-less water splitting
An alternative approach to reduce the costs of water electrolysers is to implement membrane-less designs and adopt fabrication methodologies that can simplify assembly and therefore reduce the overall fabrication costs. High quality membranes can ensure fast ionic transport, reduce efficiency losses and importantly avoid cross-contamination of precursors and products, but represents a significant portion of the electrolyser costs due to the materials employed for their fabrication, the fouling tendency over time and the necessity to be regularly replaced. Membrane-less design is possible with two configurations depending on the type of electrode employed: flow-by and flow-through. In flow-by design, the electrodes face each other and are parallel to the flow. The gas product separation is achieved by physical channel separation upon laminar flow generation. In flow-through systems, the electrodes face each other but are perpendicular to the electrolyte flow and their porous nature allows the liquid to pass-through while producing the oxygen and hydrogen gases. Beside flow systems, another way to separate the gaseous products is by exploiting the buoyancy effect of the gases to travel vertically in a solution towards its surface. In a scenario where low-cost electricity can be available intermittently and for a short-limited time, assembly and fabrication costs must be reduced significantly to give an opportunity for electrolytic water splitting devices to be competitive with other hydrogen production procedures (methane reforming). In this sense, innovative manufacturing procedures represent invaluable tools towards these goals. 3D printing can enable the design and fabrication of simpler electrolyser systems but with innovative designs and materials for enhanced efficiencies as has been demonstrated in recent works.
One of the pioneering studies was performed by O'Neil et al. who designed and fabricated a simple flow-through membrane-less water electrolyser by FDM.55 In this work, the authors used electrodeposition procedures to functionalize commercial titanium electrodes with Pt or Ni and tested water splitting performances in alkaline and acidic solutions. By optimizing the electrodes orientation with respect to the high flow, electrolysis efficiency and low cross-over product contamination was achieved. It is also important to highlight that effective operations at neutral or near neutral pH is another great advantage over conventional PEM or alkaline electrolysers being less prone to impurity or ionic contaminations, longer operating lifetime and less costly catalysts (Fig. 4A). Beside flow system, the same group demonstrated efficient water splitting performances adopting the buoyancy mechanism to separate H2 and O2 products.56,57 In the work published in 2018,33 the group combined water electrolysis with a photovoltaic electrical source for a self-sustainable process. Titanium mesh electrodes were again employed and covered on one side with a Pt catalyst by electron-beam evaporation. The device body was 3D printed by FDM and had floating characteristics and top chambers to collect selectively only H2 gas while releasing into the atmosphere the O2. The electrodes were positioned at different angles while investigating H2 production efficiencies and purity. In this work, a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 5.3% was achieved with 99% gas purity.56

More recently, a similar design was employed for a standard water electrolyser but with both the electrodes and the device body 3D printed using different AM methods.57 The electrodes were printed by FDM using conductive PLA-carbon filaments. The authors embedded copper wires within the electrode structure during printing to improve conductivity and used electrodeposition to cover their surface with a Ni electrocatalyst (Fig. 4B). The electrolyser body was built using stereolithography with acrylic resins which guarantee more robust and gas/liquid tight components. Two separate chambers were designed in the lid structure which can separately collect H2 and O2 from the separated reaction tanks (Fig. 4C).57 The electrolyser can operates at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 with 48% efficiency. It is important to note that while commercial devices normally operate with higher efficiencies in the range 60–80%, lower efficiencies can still be accepted provided that the overall costs for the device function (electricity, manufacturing, maintenance, etc.) is significantly lower. This work clearly shows the usefulness of employing 3D printing manufacturing methods providing here innovative clickable electrode assembly for easy up scale and fast fabrication. Given the cost-effective materials employed, electrodes and device components could be easily renewed or replaced.
In other studies, investigations were directed to evaluate the performance of specific components of an electrolyser but without the testing of a fully functional assembled device. For example Lee and collaborators explored the use of selective laser melting (SLM) metal 3D printing to fabricate conical shaped titanium electrodes to be used for photo-electrochemical water splitting applications.58 The authors in this study highlighted the importance of using 3D printing technology to fabricate innovative electrode structures. TiO2 nanotubes were easily generated on the electrode surface by electrochemical anodization, which produced significantly enhanced photocatalytic performances compared with flat electrodes (Fig. 5A). Similarly, Huang et al. used SLM to fabricate stainless steel porous electrodes which can have high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution in particular. In this work, it was highlighted that 3D printing technology can be used to reproducibly fabricate electrodes with controlled porosity since the pore size and distribution can be modelled in the CAD design. The authors fabricated and compared electrodes with different porosity, showing excellent mechanical resistance in alkaline and sea water solutions with overpotentials as low as 270 mV upon electrochemical anodization in alkaline solution.59 Stainless steel electrodes as well as gas/liquid handling components of an alkaline water electrolyser were also fabricated with 3D printing methods by our group.60,61 We employed SLM methods to fabricate stainless steel electrodes and used electrodeposition procedures to deposit Pt, Ni or IrO2 onto the electrode surface and compared the HER and OER performances for different electrode combinations.60 Efficient water splitting was demonstrated with a commercial alkaline AA type battery using Pt and IrO2 modified electrodes (Fig. 5B). In another work, we employed SLM to fabricate stainless steel electrodes and FDM to fabricate gas/liquid handling components with PLA material. After fabrication all components were assembled into a functional water electrolyser. In this work, the electrode surface was modified by electrodeposition with earth-abundant catalysts such as MoS2 and NiFe double-layer hydroxide for HER and OER reactions, respectively. An overall overpotential of 1.7 V was recorded at 10 mA cm−2 current density in 1 M KOH electrolyte.61 This study emphasised the potential ability of additive manufacturing methods to fabricate fully functional devices using different materials for various components that can be easily assembled afterwards according to precise predefined model designs. This approach can significantly reduce the overall fabrication costs. More recently, a membrane-less electrolyser was fabricated for water and brine electrolysis.62 Stereolithography was utilized to fabricate the main electrolyser body which is based on a Y-shaped millimetre scale channel. Commercial electrodes modified with RuO2, IrO2 and TiO2 were allocated parallel to the liquid flow. Laminar flow dynamics were exploited to produce and separate H2/O2 or H2/Cl2 gases where purified or salty water was used as the electrolyte (Fig. 5C). Computational studies and experimental testing were carried out to evaluate the device efficiency and the optimal flow rate to achieve good gas separation. Performance of the device compared well with that of state-of-the-art alkaline electrolyzers which operate at voltage and current density ranges of 1.8–2.4 V and 200–400 mA cm−2, respectively, and reach a temperature of 60 to 80 °C with a strong KOH solution (∼30 wt%) as the electrolyte.63 The current reactor operates at more than 400 mA cm−2 at a voltage of 2.4 V at room temperature. However, the electrodes employed were more expensive that those Ni-based used in alkaline electrolyzers.

4. 3D-printing for electrochemical reactors
There is a renewed interest in adopting electrochemistry for laboratory and industrial scale synthetic applications.2 This is driven mainly by the fact that electrical energy is becoming more and more available at low cost from renewable sources such as wind and solar, but also because several key intermediate compounds can be easily generated through redox reactions with high levels of control, avoiding dangerous or toxic reactants and with less secondary unreacted residuals. Electrochemical reactors are traditionally designed in a batch static format which requires minimal technological and engineering efforts but suffers from low yields and low efficiencies. This has been overcome by the flow technology which significantly enhances the conversion rates, enabled possibilities of automation and improved reaction control and product purities.3 This at the expense of a higher level of understanding of flow dynamics, electrode surface reactions, mixing phenomena and the necessity of specialized engineering skills beside electrochemical knowledge. 3D printing is gaining popularity in the field of electrocatalytic processes since, in contrast with other manufacturing methods, it allows the fabrication of geometrically optimized reactors.64 Due to the high costs, conventional methods can only generate simple shape (e.g. cylinder) which often cannot fully achieve the potential of flow processes. Beside the fabrication of flow reactors which for now could be not economically convenient for industrial scale applications, custom-made and optimized components such as mixers and electrodes, can be 3D printed and integrated with conventional reactors producing significantly enhanced efficiencies. But it can be easily foreseen that in the near future fully 3D printed reactors and components will be implemented also in large-volume operations, carefully optimized and tailored for the specific reaction and synthetic process they are used for. In the next sections, we describe recent examples of the use of 3D printing manufacturing methods for the fabrication of reactors and components for organic and inorganic synthetic processes classified whether in batch (static) or flow formats.
4.1. Electrosynthesis with static reactors
Electrolytic static reactors are simple containers where reactants are mixed and put into contact with electrodes which drive the reactions. For laboratory setups, it generally consists of glass cells (beaker cells or H-shape cells) with a porous separator (membrane) between electrodes. Given the simplicity of these designs, 3D printing has not been extensively used because its full potential and usefulness is better expressed when dealing with complex architectures. Nevertheless, some pioneering studies were demonstrated by the Cronin group in 2012 who designed and fabricated, by robocasting methods, a series of modular reactors in acetoxy-silicone polymer termed “reactionware” in which non-printable components (glass-frits, electrodes, windows) were inserted while pausing the printing process.65 By optimizing volumes and mixing chambers, different standard organic syntheses were demonstrated. In addition, electrosynthetic processes were also shown with the insertion of electrodes both commercial (ITO, glassy carbon) or directly 3D printed (acetoxy-silicone polymer/carbon black composite) within the reaction vessels. The authors performed the electrolytic transformation of phosphomolybdic acid to polyoxomolybdates (Fig. 6A) which clearly demonstrated how reactors, electrodes and cell components can be all fabricated by economical 3D printing methods. More recently, Guima et al. 3D printed an H-cell electrolyzer using fused deposition modelling (FDM) in a simple 3-part assembly where a commercial glassy carbon working electrode, reference and counter electrodes and membrane can be easily integrated (Fig. 6B).66 The authors of this work employed the electrolyser for the conversion of glycerol to tartronic acid which has a much higher industrial value as a precursor for several mesoxalic acid based pharmaceutical drugs. Process enhancement was accomplished with the use of Pd nanocubes synthesized in-house that were used as elecrocatalysts.

4.2. Electrosynthesis with flow reactors
Compared with static batch reactors, flow reactors and in particular microreactors, possess the advantage of fast mass transport capabilities. For reactions in which the electron transfer is almost instantaneous when the substrate compound touches the electrode surface, the overall rate determining step for the reaction is hugely dependent on the time required by the molecule to travel from the bulk of the solution to the electrode by diffusion.5 Flow systems are designed to significantly reduce the time for convection–diffusion of the reactant to the electrode surface and therefore can provide efficient and fast reaction rates. The combination of flow systems for electrochemical synthetic procedures and 3D printing manufacturing is becoming a powerful tool for synthetic chemistry applications both in laboratory and industrial scales. It appears evident that the possibility to design and optimize flow systems with appropriate mixing capabilities in relation to the specific application and reaction process, is of great advantage and in this sense 3D printing has already been implemented for their fabrication and prototype studies, as documented by several review articles in this topic.19,67,68 However, we wish to highlight here the works carried out specifically for synthetic processes based on electrochemistry and using reactors and/or components fabricated by 3D printing. Early attempts at employing 3D printing for the fabrication of electrochemical reactors were described by Ponce de Leon et al.69 In this report the authors used ABS to fabricate an undivided flow reactor that could be used for different electrochemical applications including redox flow batteries, electrolysis, water treatment and electrosynthesis. The authors investigated mass transport properties of the cell by means of the conventional ferrocyanide redox probe and compared it with commercially available reactors (Fig. 7A). Flow microreactors have been fabricated in Al with conventional methods or in polymeric materials using stereolithography and used for the facile electrochemical generation of radicals. The authors of this work performed hydroaminations to produce isoindolinones and the particular flow design avoided the use of supporting electrolytes even for organic based synthesis (Fig. 7B).70 The use of 3D printing reduced the fabrication costs and also allowed multiple iterations in the flow design in order to achieve the optimized performance and the highest yields. In another work, an electrochemical flow reactor was fabricated by FDM with PLA thermoplastic and used for the synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles.71 Different configurations (series and parallel) and various flow and current simulations were investigated. In addition, other parameters such as pH and voltage applied were also evaluated and correlated with the size of the nanoparticles produced (Fig. 7C).71 van Melis et al. designed and fabricated a 3D printed low-cost electrochemical flow cell for the methoxymethylation of alcohols in an electrolyte-free reaction and compared the system with the batch process.72 Components exposed to the solvent were printed in polypropylene (PP) while structural components in PLA using FDM printing. Commercial carbon electrodes were inserted in the flow system while pausing the printing process of the flow reactor. Base unit, bottle holder, reactor holder, injection unit and the mixing unit were all 3D printed. The 3D printed components were made compatible with the Electrasyn 2.0 system which is a commercial electrochemical device for batch electrosynthetic applications. This electrochemical flow setup is cost-effective and practical and could be used for different organic synthesis. As already described in the water splitting section, a membrane-less electrolyzer was designed and fabricated by Hashemi et al. for water splitting but also for the synthesis of NaOH and Cl2. This flow system adopts a parallel electrode configuration and is printed with the SLA method.62 More recently, Marquez-Monte et al.73 designed and assembled a versatile electrochemical flow system that can be used for several different applications. FDM 3D printing was used to fabricate flow frames, detachable flow distributors, turbulence promoters, and current collector holders of the reactor (Fig. 7D). The authors performed a careful chemical compatibility assessment of the materials used for printing with several common electrolytes and solvents used in electrosynthetic applications, both aqueous and organic based. Then computer flow dynamic (CFD) simulations were realized to investigate different flow configurations in the presence or absence of turbulence promoters and with Ni foam used as the commercial electrode. A Nafion membrane was used as the separator for the filter-press assembled flow cell. The authors encourage the use of this type of flow system to investigate different electrochemical processes from flow batteries to electrosynthesis due to its versatility and low-cost. The turbulence promoters and flow designs can be easily adjusted to the specific application.73 In another work, Arenas et al.74 focused their attention on the 3D printing of metal electrodes with follow-up surface modification by electrodeposition. In their recent work, a titanium mesh electrode was 3D printed by selective laser sintering and then modified with Pt catalyst by electroplating in an hexachloroplatinic acid based bath. The mesh electrode was fabricated with a regular arrangement of triangular pores (Fig. 7E) and various electroplating conditions were tested to achieve optimal coverage and corrosion resistance. This type of electrode can be adopted for water splitting and electrosynthesis applications.

4.3. Spectroelectrochemical cells
Spectroelectrochemistry combines two classical methods, electrochemistry and spectroscopy, to obtain chemical information. An essential feature of this technique is that the two measurements are obtained simultaneously, which allows the identification of unknown intermediates or products of a redox reaction. Such a powerful tool has obtained a renewed interest in recent years not only for analytical purposes but also for synthetic applications. Several different spectroscopic methods can be used in spectroelectrochemistry such as absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), the near-infrared (NIR) or the infrared (IR) regions, Raman scattering spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and luminescence in the UV-Vis regions.75 Given the variability of the techniques, the construction and design of spectroelectrochemical cells needs to be optimized for the particular spectroscopic instrument, and can exhibit various degrees of complexity depending also on the specific chemical reaction under investigation. It is likely that within the same research group different setups are required for different redox reactions and therefore, versatile systems for fast assembly represent critical aspects as well as allowing a trial and error approach to testing the cell performance. 3D printing can provide easy customization of spectroelectrochemical cells and components at much lower costs compared with traditional methods and also more rapidly. One of the first example was presented by Brisendine et al.76 in 2013 who 3D printed a microchannel plastic insert that fits inside conventional 1 cm2 cuvettes used in common transmission spectrometers. The plastic insert was printed by the SLA method and consisted of a small volume cell in which gold electrodes foils were arranged in parallel. Holes in the gold foil working electrodes put the main chamber in connection with a secondary chamber where the reference and auxiliary electrodes were placed. With this cell, a thin layer electrochemistry process can be easily investigated while providing a 1 cm path length for the light with only 75 μL volume of sample (Fig. 8A). With such a cell, the fast potentiometric titration of safranine O and cytochrome c were performed, as representative of a small molecule and protein, respectively.76 Achilli and collaborators showed how 3D printing could play an essential role in building specialized spectroelectrochemical cells.77 In their work, specially designed cells were used to integrate spectroelectrochemical investigations with an additional surface characterization technique (X-ray absorption spectroscopy) carried out in a synchrotron beamline. Such a multi-purpose cell allowed in situ and in operando measurements on photoanodes used for water splitting applications (Fig. 8B).77 The authors of this work adopted 3D printing to create cells useful when using synchrotron-based methods combined with complementary techniques. They could combine spectroscopy, electrochemistry and photochemistry to simultaneously investigate in detail the catalyst behaviour for water splitting. In another study, dos Santos et al.78 used 3D printing to create a special cell able to combine Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry in a spectroelectrochemical study of Prussian blue structural changes upon various voltage bias. Again, 3D printing emerged as an affordable solution to fabricate spectroelectrochemical cells for special applications that would require expensive cells limiting otherwise their implementation (Fig. 8C). Very recently Vaněčková et al.79 used FDM 3D printing to fabricate custom-made electrodes to be used in spectroelectrochemical investigations. They employed UV-Vis spectroscopy to study the electrogenerated products upon anodic activation of electrodes made with a PLA-CNT composite material. The electrodes had an opening window within their structure to facilitate the optical characterization (Fig. 8D). Using a ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate redox probe, the authors of this work were able to optimize the anodic activation pretreatment achieving electron transfer properties of the printed electrodes comparable to commercial ones and resulting in cathodic to anodic peak-to-peak ΔEpp-values obtained during cyclic voltammetry measurements of 72 ± 2 mV.

5. 3D-Printing for redox flow batteries
There have been numerous efforts in improving the performance of redox flow batteries (RFBs) in recent years due to their design simplicity, outstanding operation lifetime, and high capacitance to deal with power supply fluctuations.80–83 RFBs are an electrochemical energy conversion device that consist of a flow system facilitated by the pump, electrolyte tank and the electrochemical cell (Fig. 9). Unlike conventional batteries (e.g. lithium-ion) that store energy within the electrode structures,84 RFBs store their energy in the liquid electrolyte consisting of energy-bearing redox active species, catholyte (positive potential electrolyte) and anolyte (negative potential electrolyte).83 This unique feature is advantageous as it allows independent scaling of energy capacity and power by varying the volume of the electrolyte tank and the surface area of the electrodes or the number of electrodes in the cell stack, respectively.83–85 Such flexibility in cell design allows easy scale-up across applications ranging from large-scale storage applications in industry or utility setting (MW h) to dispatchable residential loads (W h to kW h).86

RFBs can be classified into two primary types: aqueous or non-aqueous (organic) systems. Apart from redox active species, the efficiency of RFBs are determined by several components of the system. For example, mass transfer properties and pressure drop are affected by the type of configuration (e.g. serpentine, interdigitated, and flow-through) used in the flow field design. Also, the geometrical structure of the electrodes with high surface area promotes rapid heterogeneous electrochemical reactions and enables high current density operation.87–89 3D printing has become a very useful tool in RFBs research. Laboratory-scale prototypes can be fabricated easily within a short period time. Innovative design and new concepts can be implemented and assessed in fast and cost-effective ways.90 Over the years, a wide range of materials such as transparent glasses, ceramics, polymers, and metals have been explored and made accessible for 3D printing applications.91,92 The choice of materials is critical in 3D printing as it will dictate the type of application based on material compatibility. To further extend the significance of 3D-printing technologies, this section will highlight some of the recent contributions in 3D-printing research for aqueous and organic RFBs.
5.1. Aqueous based RFBs
The progression in scale in RFBs needs to be significant in order to achieve a practical model for electrochemical energy storage at the grid scale. However, the most concerning aspect in the present studies on aqueous based RFBs is the system operating cost. At present, the vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is one of the most well-established examples. The system employs vanadium ions in four different oxidation states, namely V2+/V3+ and V3+/V4+.80,84,93 Despite many advantages, the high capital cost has limiting the widespread commercialization of the vanadium RFB. Apart from the chemical attributes of the system, one possible approach to reduce the operating cost is to improve the performance of the electrochemical cell, such as through 3D printing.6,90
The flow field and electrode are the main two components in the RFB that affects mass transport performance.87,88 To date, various studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of RFBs across different flow field architectures. Some of the commonly used flow configurations have designed trade-offs between improve mass transport and pumping loss.87,94–96 The main function of the flow field is to facilitate distribution of the electrolyte through the electrode for electron transfer reactions. 3D printing offers a facile and inexpensive way to produce prototypes for evaluation of new flow designs.
Some of the recent studies have shown that the alteration on the flow channel could potentially improve the mass transfer losses while minimizing pressure drop. Marschewski et al.97 have designed a novel microfluidic network to improve the performance of the flow field. Taking inspiration from an interdigitated configuration, the authors have fabricated interdigitated microfluidic networks with a tapered multi-pass structure. The aim of the multi-pass structure is to improve the electrolyte homogeneity and increase the superficial velocity within the electrode domain. 3D printing allows fast and low-cost prototyping to access the benefits and make the comparison between the tapering and multiple-pass design. Promising results were achieved for an alkaline quinone flow battery with the dual-pass interdigitated fluidic network. This innovative design, enabled by 3D-printing, demonstrated a net power density of 0.99 W cm−2 after subtracting the pumping power losses, which is superior to current RFB systems (Fig. 10A).97 In another work, the same group introduced another novel corrugated fluidic network which take inspiration from a parallel flow field design.98 Four different fluidic networks were easily constructed by 3D-printing. In this work, the 3D-printing was used to produce prototypes to validate against the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. Subsequent testing has shown that the power density obtained for the proposed fluidic network outperformed the conventional parallel configuration (Fig. 10B).

Akuzum et al.99 introduced obstructions into two different flow field designs (interdigitated and parallel). The ramps and prismatic obstructions were 3D-printed with low cost PLA polymeric materials. The results have shown good improvement to the power density by integrating ramps into the interdigitated flow field (IDFF). In addition, there was a drastic decrease in the overall pumping pressure for the system. The present of the ramps in the close-ended flow channel (IDFF) allows the electrolyte to penetrate deeper into the membrane–electrode interface, this promotes a more effective redox reaction. This work has shown that 3D printing technology has the potential to produce an innovative flow field modification in a quick and easy way.
Electrodes in RFBs are chemically inert and therefore, their structures are not altered during the electrochemical reactions (charging or discharging). The function of the electrode is merely to provide active sites to facilitate charge transfer. A good electrode geometry provides high specific surface area for a rapid heterogeneous electrochemical reaction, high fluid permeability for the electrolyte to pass through and high electrical conductivity. The electrode material must also be cost-effective and mechanically robust.
Arenas et al.100 proposed the use of selective laser melting (SLM) to fabricate a well-structured stainless-steel electrode for flow systems. In this work, 3D-printing technology has shown good control over the geometrical structure of the electrode and volumetric porosity. The use of SLM also induced a high degree of surface roughness on the fabricated 3D-printed porous electrode. From the mass transport studies, the 3D-printed electrode was found to perform well, and the results were comparable with other types of electrodes (metal mesh and reticulated vitreous carbon). Apart from engineering the electrode, this study showed that a single continuous electrode consisting of the electrode and current collector is achievable by means of addictive manufacturing. Such a configuration will eliminate any gap between the electrode and current collector to prevent ohmic resistance related losses.100,101
5.2. Organic based RFBs
Low operating voltage remains a key concern among the many limitations faced by aqueous based RFBs. The intrinsic narrow electrochemical stability window of water (1.23 V at 25 °C) limits the choices of redox species and prevents the system for achieving a high theoretical cell voltage.82 Consequently, the energy densities based on aqueous electrolytes are correspondingly low. In view of the disadvantages inherent in aqueous based RFB, research interest has gradually shifted towards the development of organic based RFBs. The advantages of organic based RFB comes from the wider electrochemical stability window of non-aqueous solvents102 and the ability to achieve desirable electrochemical properties via molecular structure modifications.89
In theory, 3D printing technologies can be applied to fabricate cell components for rapid prototyping in the design process for organic based RFBs. Armstrong and co-workers103 have constructed a zero-gap flow-through cell by 3D printing. The flow cell bodies were printed with “VeroWhite” resin. In this work, the 3D printed cell was used to evaluate the battery performance for a new class of cobalt(II) complexes in acetonitrile solution at high current densities. The results have shown that the cobalt(II) complexes experienced capacity fading over time owing to a poor electrode kinetics response. Nonetheless, the modified tridentate azole-pyridine ligands have shown improvement in the theoretical RFB cell potential and solubility, also the battery performance was comparable with similar RFB systems.
Undesirable material–membrane interaction and material cross-over are two major drawbacks of organic based RFBs. The practicality of organic based RFBs is further limited by the difficulties in searching for membranes with high ionic conductivity and selectivity.89 Previous studies have proposed a membrane-free flow battery system. The electrolytes maintain a laminar flow to minimize the mixing of the electrolyte. However, the system exhibits poor power capacities due to the relatively low cell potentials.104
Cook et al.105 have proposed a membrane-less organic based RFB system. In their work, the authors have successfully synthesized an ambipolar (can serve as both anolyte and catholyte) organic molecule that exhibits high theoretical cell voltage in propylene carbonate. The use of a single redox-active parent molecule for the system makes crossover completely irrelevant.105 Taking into consideration the material compatibility with the proposed solvent, Taulman T-Glase was used to fabricate the 3D-printed prototype. Tested with a model solution of known chemistry, the performance of the membraneless 3D-printed cell showed low power but high charging-discharging capabilities. Possible underlying problems with the cell design were further investigate using CFD modelling. The use of CFD modelling to validate against the 3D prototype produces meaningful data and allows optimization of the cell design. This brings us a step closer towards the realization of organic based RFBs with practical significance.
5.3. Material compatibility considerations
3D printing technologies in RFB cell designs allow for fast feedback for engineering new prototypes with optimal electrochemical performance, although the choice of the materials for suitability in different media remains one of the key challenges.11 A reliable and durable RFB setup is important for the transition of laboratory prototype to commercial realization. While a wide range of materials are available for 3D-printing,91,92 the importance of material-solvent compatibility will determine the system sustainability and reliability. In previous studies, Armstrong and co-workers103,106 have reported that the “VeroWhite” resin-based flow cell bodies degraded with time due to excessive swelling and absorption of the electrolyte. Due to this limitation, the proposed material is not suitable for long term or repeated experiments. Also, Cook et al. mentioned that nylon was not compatible with their solvent system due to its wiry properties.105 Therefore, the selection of appropriate materials used for 3D-printing is important, particularly the resistance to the choice of solvent used for the RFB.
Erokhin et al.107 have developed a solvent compatibility chart for a wide range of existing polymeric materials (Fig. 11A). The author fabricated cylinders by FDM with several thermoplastics and stereolithography for a photoresin polymer. The 3D-printed cylinder was topped with a glass/steel bead and soaked in a solvent. The polymeric materials were stable in organic solvents over one hour but most of them collapsed by showing signs of disintegration, delamination, dissolution or even swelling after a prolonged storage of 20 hours (Fig. 11B). Results have shown that some of the materials such as POM, PE, PP, Nylon and Nylon-C are resistant to common organic solvents. In their study, they also proposed methods to improve the solvent resistance of the printed parts by (i) modifying the polymers with additive, (ii) altering the 3D printing parameters, i.e. decreasing the porosity and (iii) tuning the geometry of the printed part. Similarly, Salentijn et al.18 have also evaluated solvent compatibility of 12 representative FDM materials. The 3D-printed test structures were exposed to 5 different solvents and their behaviour in the solvent were accessed over a week. Most of materials showed good compatible with water except PVC. Among the 4 other organic solvents, most materials are compatible with methanol and 2-propanol although many were not compatible with acetone and acetonitrile.

(red color) The material collapses during the experiment (ΔS > 20%): the object loses its shape by dissolution, disintegration and/or delamination; (blue color) the material shows moderate stability during the experiment (ΔS = 2–20%), with minor swelling or dissolution of the outer layers, but satisfactory retention of the shape; (green color) the material is stable during the experiment (ΔS < 2%): the object retains its shape, and no dissolution of the outer layers is observed. Destruction of Primalloy in THF took just a few seconds. (b) Representative snapshot series of FDM parts during the chemical resistance tests. Reprinted with permission from ref. 107.

In another study, a new material was developed for improved material-solvent compatibility. Mannel et al.108 have introduced a fluorinated-based resin formulation, 1H,1H,6H,6H-perfluoro-1,6-hexyl diacrylate (PFHDA) for high-resolution 3D printing via micro-stereolithography (μSL). The solvent resistance and swelling effects of the fluorinated material were investigated in eight different solvents. The proposed material has shown resistance towards commonly used organic solvents (THF, DMF and toluene) and exhibits low swelling effects.
6. 3D-Printing for fuel cells
6.1. Microbial fuel cells
In recent decades, rapid growth of world population has increased the demand for global energy consumption far beyond being sustainable. Heavy utilization of non-renewal energy resources (such as fossil fuels and coal) has increased the carbon footprint significantly due to the overwhelming emissions of CO2 from these intense carbon-based sources. Efforts have been diverted towards more sustainable and greener energy technologies such as photovoltaic, wind, hydroelectricity, biofuels, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) etc.109–113 MFC is a promising green energy technology due to its ability to generate electricity through waste-water treatment. A typical MFC consists of anaerobic anodic compartment and aerated cathodic compartment separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM) (Fig. 12A).113 The microorganisms adhere on the anode and serve as a biocatalyst to break down organic matter to generate protons and electrons. The electrons travel through the external load and the protons diffuse across the membrane into the cathodic compartment to produce water. To implement such an application to large scale operation, the technologies needed to develop MFC components such as the electrodes and membranes with improved system efficiency and low-manufacturing cost.112,113

3D printing technologies has been used in several MFC research projects to fabricate MFC components with different design structure and materials (Fig. 12B). Philamore et al.114 has successfully fabricated a novel polymeric ion exchange membrane from Tangoplus for MFC by photopolymer jetting. The 3D printed material has shown resistance to biodegradation and it exhibits a stable power output across a range of loads. Under optimal load conditions, peak power production was 0.92 mW using the innovative 3D-printed membrane (Tangoplus), which is inferior to the 11.39 mW (CEM) and 10.51 mW (latex) achieved with commercial materials. Despite having lower power output, this study has shown the potential of using 3D printing technology to fabricate functional individual MFC components for further optimization (Fig. 12C). In another work,115 the same group adopted a different 3D printing technique, FDM to construct MFC membranes and anodes using different polymeric materials. Among the three materials used to fabricate the MFC membrane, the 3D-printed Gel-Lay membrane generated a maximum power output of 240 ± 11 μW which is 1.4 times higher than the conventional cation exchange membrane (CEM). Although the 3D printed conductive polylactic acid (PLA)-based polymeric anode has underperformed, the 3D printing technique offers an easy and cost-effective solution to fabricate the MFC components. An effective MFC anode structure should also possess high porosity to enhance bacteria adhesion for maximum power output. In a different work, Zhou et al.116 have fabricated two different metallic 3D-printed anodes, namely 316L stainless steel skeleton anode (3DP-SS) and Titanium alloy skeleton anode (3DP-Ti) with X-shape skeleton macro-porous structure. The geometrical structure of the electrode was precisely controlled by 3D printing. The 3D printed anode exhibits anti-blockage ability and promotes bacteria growth due to effective substrates transportation. In a similar direction, Bian et al.117 has successfully constructed a 3D printed porous copper (3D-PPC) electrode by DLP. The 3D printing technique has shown good consistency in controlling the pore size of the printed structure with an error of less than 1.1%. Also, the 3D-PPC exhibit better electrochemical performance than the copper mesh electrode due to its high porosity. In another work,118 the same group has also successfully designed and constructed a 3D-printed carbonaceous (3D-PCP) porous anode. The 3D-PCP was fabricated via DLP followed by a controlled carbonization process. In this study, the performance of 3D-PCPs with porosity ranging from 100–500 μm were evaluated. The average pore size error from the printing was less than 3.5% and the total porosity of the electrode was over 95%. The carbonization process also helps to induce a secondary porous surface which further increases the surface area for bacteria adhesion. The 3D-PCP anode with pore size of 300 μm has outperform the conventional carbon cloth by achieving a maximum voltage of 453.4 ± 6.5 mV and peak power density of 233.5 ± 11.6 mW m−2. This is a significant improvement compared to the commercial carbon cloth anode that produced a power density of 69.0 ± 4.7 mW m−2 (Fig. 12D).
The ease to fabricate functional MFC components for further optimization demonstrates the feasibility of 3D printing technology for future monolithic MFC fabrication.
6.2. Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
The SOFC is considered one of the best sustainable electrochemical energy-conversion devices due to its high energy conversion efficiency and pollution free power generation approach.119 The solid oxide cells (SOC) consists of ceramic-based ion conducting electrolytes held between two porous electrodes, namely the cathode and anode.120 The SOFC operates by converting the chemical energy of a fuel (hydrocarbons, and municipal solid waste) and oxidant (air) into electricity.121 To facilitate long-term operation while generating a high power output, the manufacturing methods play an important role to optimise the efficiency and performance of the SOFC.122 The conventional methods to produce commercial SOFC devices lack the ability to fabricate ceramic parts with high complexity. Also, the manufacturing process involves large number of processing steps which potentially increase the risk of error and raises production costs. To overcome the intrinsic limitations of these conventional manufacturing methods, 3D printing technologies were reported to be successful in designing and fabricating SOFCs with complex geometries in a one-step process (Fig. 13A). Over the years of studies, 3D printing technologies such as Ink-jet printing (Direct Ink Printing, DIP) and UV Stereolithography, which includes stereolithography apparatus (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP) have demonstrated the ability to fabricate functional dense ceramic parts for the SOFC primary cell. Among the three techniques, the use of ink-jet printing in SOFC applications was extensively discussed in a review article by Ruiz-Morales et al.122 This technique is best at producing a dense electrolyte layer of thickness below 10 μm onto substrates for thin film application.123–130 Recently, SLA and DLP were used in SOFC studies to construct self-supported yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes. Wei et al.131 have successfully fabricated multiple 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) electrolytes simultaneously in a batch by DLP 3D printing technology. This printing technique exhibits precise control over the geometrical parameters of the printed green bodies. Under SEM imaging, the 8YSZ electrolyte shows no sign of defects and the measured density was as high as 99.96%. The electrochemical performance of the symmetrical SOFC, Ag-CDC (Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9, gadolinium goped ceria) |8YSZ|Ag-CDC demonstrate good open circuit voltages (OCVs) in the range of 1.04–1.08 V across a range of temperatures from 700 to 850 °C. The values obtained were in good agreement with the theoretical values estimated by the Nernst equation, indicating gas tightness and good integration between the cell components. A peak power density (PPD) of 176 mW cm−2 at 850 °C was achieved with the DLP printed 8YSZ electrolyte. This compares favourably with the power density value obtained with the same electrolyte fabricated by a traditional dry-pressing method (127 mW cm−2). In a similar work, Xing et al.132 have shown the viability of the DLP technique. Despite having a different ceramic-resin formulation, the SOFC assembled with the printed 8YSZ electrolyte has shown excellent OCVs of approximately 1.1 V across the temperature range of 700–800 °C. Also, the conductivity of the 8YSZ electrolyte sintered at 1400 and 1450 °C fall within the acceptable range for practical applications. The PPD achieved for the full cell was 114.3 mW cm−2 at 800 °C. In a different work, SLA printing was performed to fabricate self-supported electrolytes with complex configurations. In these studies, the performance of the SOFC cells was enhanced by altering the geometry of the electrolyte architecture. Masciandaro et al.133 have designed and printed 3% YSZ electrolyte with a honeycomb structure. The annular ring support was incorporated in the design of the electrolyte to support monolithic integration of the active electrode. The cross-section SEM images of the complete fuel cells shows good homogeneity of the grain size across all the layers. The OCVs obtained from the complex geometry (i.e. honeycomb) were closely matched with the theoretical values. The honeycomb fuel cells configuration exhibited a power density of 115 mW cm−2, an increase of 15% as compared to a planar counterpart (100 mW cm−2). Numerical models were also used to determine the enhancement factor of the honeycomb structure. The use of numerical modelling to validate the effects of different geometrical structure bring us a step closer to achieve high performance and innovative 3D printed SOFC. In another work, Pesce et al.134 have fabricated 8YSZ electrolyte with corrugated structure by the SLA technique. A similar approach was taken to incorporate an annular ring into the design of the electrolyte. The 3D printed corrugated architecture has increased the effective surface area of the electrolyte by 57% compared to the planar counterpart. Even at high complexity, the fabricated YSZ electrolyte was defect-free, and exhibited good thickness homogeneity. The conductivity and activation energy of the assembled cells with the 3D printed electrolyte are in good agreement with literature values reported by conventional techniques. Most importantly, the fuel cell obtained a peak power density of 410 mW cm−2 at 900 °C and demonstrated a low degradation rate over a long period at high current density. A significant increase by approximately 57% resulted over the systems employing the planar configuration (233 mW cm−2) (Fig. 13B).

7. Conclusions and future perspectives
The continuous advancements in additive manufacturing technologies will certainly contribute to the fabrication of better performing components of electrochemical devices. However, depending on the type of component and the material needed for the fabrication, such advancements might progress at different paces. We have seen that electrochemical systems for energy or synthetic applications generally require three elements: conductive materials for electrodes comprising the current collectors and the catalysts; polymeric materials for separation membranes; and non-conductive materials for reactor vessels comprising the liquid handling platform and the casing. Taking into consideration the electrodes, they play a crucial role in the overall efficiency of the device and therefore, they need to possess important requisites such as a high conductivity, excellent catalytic properties, and high structural and chemical resistance to withstand prolonged usage. 3D printing conductive materials are limited to metals and carbon based composites. While the former guarantee excellent conduction abilities, they require additive manufacturing processes that are still prohibitive to be considered for large scale fabrication. On the other hand, the carbon based composite materials can be adopted with more established and less demanding printing machines at much lower costs. However, such composites are made with the addition of significant amounts of “binder” materials to facilitate their printability but at the cost of much poorer conductivity properties. Overall, the catalytic ability of the electrode components represents the most challenging and limiting factor for the current 3D printing technologies. The best performing catalysts are generally materials present with nanometer scale architectures and from a practical point of view no 3D printing methodology is available today to reach this level of resolution. The only AM method able to reach sub-micrometer resolution is 2PP which is however limited to few photopolymers and with printing speeds not compatible with large volume demands. Some extrusion methods such as direct ink writing (DIW) were used to print inks made with nanocatalysts but the resolution is still too low to achieve the necessary high catalytic surface area required for efficient reactions. A solution to this problem consists in various post-printing processes that can be adopted to functionalize the conductive electrode surface with thin films of catalytic materials. Such material depositions such as electroplating, painting, hydrothermal growth, spraying or sputtering add inevitable complexity and costs to the overall fabrication process.
A similar problem is faced when printing membranes. We have seen that for some electrochemical applications, special flow systems could avoid the use of separating membranes but when high purity products or static reactors are adopted, membranes represent not only an essential component but also one with large production and assembly costs. This is because membranes must provide good ion conductivity, low resistance while keeping separated the reactants and products. Nanometer and micrometer scale pores are generally present in membranes used from ultrafiltration to microseparation applications and again this represents the main problem when it comes to the use of 3D printing for their fabrication. Current 3D printing methods are not cost effective for membrane fabrication due to low printing speeds to achieve high resolution. More technological advancements must be achieved before membrane fabrication becomes feasible at large scale. For the present times, additive manufacturing has been used to complement current membrane fabrication methods for efficiency improvements by fabricating add-ons components such as spacers, turbulence promoters and membrane supports. Such components, having innovative designs have demonstrated improved membrane performance in terms of permeance, anti-fouling ability and duration.
Microreactor vessels and fluidic systems are certainly more feasible candidates for additive manufacturing methods. Generally, the systems do not require conductive materials and sub-micrometer scale resolutions and therefore can be fabricated at large scale and reduced costs for a wide range of materials available. Reactors with innovative flow designs fabricated by 3D printing have already demonstrated significant enhancements compared to components fabricated by traditional methods which do not offer parallel design freedom. In addition, several non-conductive components can be printed at high speed and low cost to reach comparable large-scale production volumes to traditional methods.
While significant advantages have been shown by the use of 3D printing for the fabrication of electrochemical devices, it is clear that the current limitations such as low resolution, limited material availability and limited fabrication speed, limit such devices to a prototype lab-scale stage. A combination between traditional moulding and subtractive manufacturing with the most advanced additive manufacturing technologies is currently the optimal solution for the fabrication of electrochemical flow systems and devices. When 3D printing methodologies reaches the necessary resolution capabilities as well as the appropriate printing speeds, fully functional electrochemical devices could be produced in large scale and in one-step entirely by additive methods bringing all the advantages seen in the prototype phase to the real world.
