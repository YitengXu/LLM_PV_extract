    , Accepted 20th April 2020First published on 22nd April 2020AbstractLow cost photovoltaic materials and green solvent processing are important issues for commercial application of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we fabricated high-performance OSCs based on the low-cost conjugated polymer PTQ10 as a donor and the small molecule n-type organic semiconductor HO-IDIC-2F as an acceptor, using non-halogen tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the processing solvent. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the as-cast OSCs reached 12.20%, which is comparable with the ones processed with chloroform (CF) (12.43%). Thermal stability of the active layer was also studied by thermal treatment at 100 °C for 8 hours. As a result, the active layer morphology remained unchanged and the PCE of the devices still reached 12.13%, indicating a good thermal-stability of the PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F blend film. As is commonly known, for OSCs fabricated on larger scales, the layer-by-layer (LL) method generally provides more advantages than the traditional D–A blend solution-processing method. Therefore, to test the compatibility of the THF solvent in the LL method, we fabricated blade-coated LL devices with THF as a single type of solvent for both the donor and acceptor, and the PCE could reach up to 11.85%. The surprisingly high performance of the blade-coated OSC based on the green solvent indicates that PTQ10 is a promising donor to be processed in green solvent for LL technology in the future.
Introduction
Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of lab-scale organic solar cells (OSCs) have reached 15–17%,1–6 showing great application potential for commercialization of the OSCs. High performance OSCs have been achieved due to the outstanding progress of organic photovoltaic materials and device optimization.7–9 However, challenges still exist for large-scale production and applications,10–12 such as high cost of the photovoltaic materials, toxicity of solvents (such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB)) commonly used in solution-processing,13–18 extra treatments of high boiling point solvent additive,19,20 high-temperature thermal annealing and/or solvent annealing21–23 to optimize the morphology of the active layer. The use of toxic solvent and additives is not only detrimental for the environment, but could also induce undesirable morphological changes caused by residue additives and sometimes even accelerate the photo-oxidative degradation of the blend active layers.12,24–27 In addition, high temperature thermal annealing or solvent annealing is complex and incompatible with low-cost, industry-scale production and unfavorable for energy saving.28–30 Therefore, it is ideal to fabricate high performance OSCs using green solvent without any extra treatment for commercial production.
In addition, for the commercialization of OSCs, the stability of the active layer is vital to the quality and the lifetime of OSCs.31–35 However, some aging stresses, such as moisture and oxygen, light illumination, electric field and thermal stress, are key factors that affect the morphology of the active layer.32,36 Recently, through synthesizing new materials,33 adopting a third component or additive37,38 and fabricating single-component OSCs,39–41 the stability of the active layer and devices has been well studied. However, there are few works that have studied the stability of as-cast OSCs using green solvent. Developing a green solvent-processed as-cast OSC with good stability is thus quite an urgent task, especially when commercial production is on the agenda.42 Moreover, comparing with the conventional D–A blend solution-processing method, the solution-processed layer-by-layer (LL) method is more able to control the morphology of the photoactive layer, especially when the area is scaled up for commercial printing products.9,43,44 Thus, widely adopting green solvent in large area commercial production with roll-to-roll technology or doctor-blading of the active layer is also meaningful.
The matching of a donor with an acceptor is quite important for achieving excellent performance of OSCs.45,46 Our previously reported polymer, PTQ10,47 is a promising polymer donor for commercial application because of its advantages of low cost and high efficiency48,49 and PTQ10 is soluble in green solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and o-xylene (XY). Here, with PTQ10 as the donor, and HO-IDIC-2F50 as the acceptor, we fabricated high performance green-solvent processed as-cast OSCs with THF as the solvent. The OSC without any extra treatment of additives or thermal annealing demonstrated a high PCE of 12.20%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.911 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.92 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.77%, which is comparable with the PCE (12.43%) of the OSC based on CF solvent. This result indicates that the green solvent THF is a good alternative for the chlorinated solvent CF for PTQ10-based OSCs. The thermal stability of the active layer was carefully investigated. It can be found that the PCE nearly remained unchanged when the devices were heated at 100 °C for 8 hours, which indicates the outstanding thermal stability of the active layer. Furthermore, the LL method was adopted to fabricate the OSCs using the green solvent. With the doctor-blade processing method, the PCE of the OSCs based on the LL method reached up to 11.85%, with a Voc of 0.892 V, a Jsc of 18.79 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.69%. The green solvent as-cast device with outstanding thermal stability implies that the PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F device could be a promising candidate for the future large-scale commercialized fabrication of OSCs.
Results and discussion
Absorption and energy level
The matching of polymer donor with nonfullerene acceptor is important for achieving high performance OSCs. As shown in Fig. 1, PTQ10 shows a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) of −5.54 eV, a large bandgap of 1.92 eV, and an absorption range from 450 nm to 650 nm, which indicates that PTQ10 could be a promising wide bandgap polymer for OSCs based on a narrow bandgap acceptor. Herein, we chose the small molecule HO-IDIC-2F as the acceptor for fabricating the OSCs. HO-IDIC-2F shows a EHOMO of −5.81 eV, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) of −3.91 eV, and maximum absorption at 740 nm. The PTQ10 donor and HO-IDIC-2F acceptor show a complementary absorption at 450–800 nm, as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The electronic energy level alignments of the PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F pair show a small EHOMO offset (ΔEHOMO) of 0.27 eV between donor and acceptor materials, which facilitates a higher Voc of the OSCs. The photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment, shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† indicates that the excitons produced in the PTQ10 donor and the HO-IDIC-2F acceptor can be effectively dissociated into free charge in their blend film.

Fabrication of devices
We fabricated OSCs using the green solvent of THF, with the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al,51 as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† With THF as the solvent, the PCE of the optimal OSC reached 12.20% with a Voc of 0.911 V, a Jsc of 18.92 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.77%, and the PCE of the OSC based on CF reached 12.43% with a Voc of 0.924 V, a Jsc of 19.01 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.73%; the detailed photovoltaic performance data are listed in Table 1. The similar photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs based on THF and CF indicate that PTQ10 and HO-IDIC-2F dissolve well in THF and the blend film morphology of PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F is appropriate for exciton dissociation and charge transportation when THF is used as the solvent. Fig. 2 shows the corresponding J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots. It can be seen that both OSCs based on the two solvents show a wide EQE response in the wavelength region of 330–800 nm with the same maximum response value of about 82%, indicating an efficient photo-to-electron conversion process in the THF- and CF-based devices. The integrated Jsc value from the EQE spectra is 18.52 mA cm−2 for the THF-based OSC and 18.63 mA cm−2 for the CF-based ones, which both agree well with the Jsc values measured from the J–V curves within 3% mismatch.

In order to understand the mechanism of exciton dissociation, charge recombination and collection behavior of the OSCs based on the THF and CF solvents, we measured the relationship of Jsc with the light intensity (P) and the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff). The relationship between Jsc and light intensity should follow the formula of Jsc ∝ Pα and the α value should be equal to 1 if all charges are swept out to the electrode. As shown in Fig. 2c, the α values of the OSCs based on the THF and CF solvents were estimated to be 0.901 and 0.907, respectively, under the short circuit condition, indicating a similar and negligible bimolecular recombination in both devices. The similar curves of Jphvs. Veff shown in Fig. 2d also indicate similar exciton dissociation and charge collection characteristics, and the Jph/Jsat ratio for the OSCs based on THF and CF were calculated to be 0.917 and 0.911, respectively, where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density. This result indicates that the blend film prepared with THF solvent has a suitable morphology for OSCs, which should be responsible for the excellent photovoltaic performance.
Furthermore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are performed to testify the morphology difference of the blend films prepared with the THF and CF solvents. As shown in Fig. 3, the AFM surface images of the blend films based on THF and CF show little difference and the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) is 0.748 nm and 0.763 nm, respectively. A similar morphology was also observed from the TEM images, which indicates that the THF solvent is suitable for fabricating high performance OSCs.

For the commercial application of OSCs, the stability of devices is important. To prove that the green solvent as-cast OSCs are favorable for commercial application, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), we conducted thermal treatment on the active layer of devices at 100 °C with different duration times to test the thermal stability of the morphology; the detailed data are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). For the OSCs with THF as the solvent, the device with a thermal treatment of 30 minutes shows a PCE of 12.21%, with a Voc of 0.900 V, a Jsc of 18.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 72.67%. When the treatment duration increased up to 5 and 8 hours, the devices still retained a high PCE of 12.14% and 12.13%, respectively. As for the OSCs based on the CF solvent, they also showed a similar morphology stability to that of the OSCs based on THF. The barely changed photovoltaic performance indicates that the PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F blend film has excellent morphological stability in a high temperature environment, which is crucial for long term operation under continuous illumination and is beneficial for actual application.
To understand the outstanding stability of the blend film, firstly, the charge mobility of devices with and without thermal treatment was measured using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Table S2 and Fig. S5 (ESI†), the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the as-cast device based on THF solvent were estimated to be 1.66 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μe/μh ratio of 7.76. The high μh and balanced mobility ratio should be responsible for the excellent photovoltaic performance.51–53 The μe and μh of the device with thermal treatment at 100 °C for 8 hours were estimated to be 2.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μe/μh ratio of 11.43. The charge mobility of devices based on CF solvent also shows a comparable value with the devices based on THF solvent, and the μe/μh ratios of the device without and with thermal treatment for 8 hours were calculated to be 12.09 and 12.77. The small change in the charge transport properties indicates negligible induced trap density by thermal stress that can be considered as a result of the thermally stable morphology of the blend film.
Furthermore, to investigate the change of active layer morphology and the crystallinity after long term thermal treatment, we measured the blend film morphology by using AFM and TEM. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), when THF is used as the solvent, the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) is 0.748 nm, 0.798 nm and 0.958 nm for the active layer with thermal treatment for 0 min, 30 min and 8 hours, respectively. The gradually increased Rq value of the active layer testifies that thermal treatment actually caused a larger crystallinity. The change tendency of Rq for the active layer with CF as solvent also testifies a larger crystallinity after thermal treatment. The corresponding TEM images (Fig. S7, ESI†) show that the thermal treatment at 100 °C leads to slightly enlarged phase separation, which is in agreement with the AFM images.

With thermal treatment, the morphology of the active layer changed to some degree, but the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs basically remains unchanged. Thus, we applied grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) to reveal the influence of thermal treatment on molecular packing and phase separation and consequently the performance of the OSCs. As shown in Fig. 4, all blends with THF as solvent show more face-on orientation and unchanged molecular packing with long term thermal treatment. In the 1D profiles of the blend film, it looks similar for all the films with and without thermal treatment and the deconvolution of the π–π peak shows comparable results. The GIWAXS results of the blend film with CF as solvent are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†); all the three blend films show similar molecular packing and the de-convolution of the π–π peak shows comparable results. In addition, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the π–π stacking distance remains unchanged and the coherence length of the π–π stacking is nearly constant upon thermal treatment for both blend films based on the THF and CF solvents. The RSoXS measurement (Fig. S9 and Table S4, ESI†) also shows similar plots, with nearly the same average domain purity and long period for all the blend films, which is in agreement with the similar FF values of the devices with and without thermal treatment. Therefore, we can conclude that although the morphology of the active layer has slightly changed, the molecular packing and purity are stable under long-term thermal treatment, which supports the performance invariance between the devices.
For the commercial production of OSCs, the layer-by-layer (LL) method is favorable because it is easier to control the morphology of the photoactive layer in larger scale devices. To combine the advantages of green solvents and the LL fabrication process, we chose THF as the solvent and fabricated high performance OSCs by using both LL spin-coating and LL blade-coating methods, since the blade-coating technique has been proven to be a low cost, environment-friendly, and simple method for solution-processed roll-to-roll OSCs. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2, THF was used as the solvent for both the donor and acceptor, and without annealing the active layer, the optimized devices based on LL spin-coating in air with a donor layer of 78 nm and an acceptor layer of 43 nm achieved a PCE of 12.03%, with a Voc of 0.905 V, a Jsc of 18.11 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.40%. The optimal device based on LL blade-coating under an ambient atmosphere obtained a PCE of 11.85%, with a Voc of 0.892 V, a Jsc of 18.79 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.69%, which is among the highest reported efficiency of OSCs based on the green solvent LL blade-coating method. The photovoltaic performance of the devices with thermal annealing treatment at 100 °C for 10 min is shown in Table S5 (ESI†); the slightly decreased PCE indicates that the interface between the donor and acceptor layers has morphologically contacted quite well before the annealing of the active layer. The excellent photovoltaic performance of the devices based on LL blade-coating indicates that the PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F blend film is insensitive to oxygen and moisture and suitable for the large-scale solution process. It is worth mentioning that our LL devices are fabricated with the same green solvent, THF, though prior works implied that the LL method must be operated with two orthogonal or semi-orthogonal solvents for protecting the below layer.25,54 As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), we found that the solubility of the mono-component PTQ10 in THF is low and can only be well dissolved with low concentration (<5 mg ml−1), continuous heating and stirring at 45 °C for 12 h, so the bottom PTQ10 layer cannot be dissolved when the upper HO-IDIC-2F layer is fabricated with the cold THF solution. These results testify that PTQ10 holds crucial advantages for fabricating high performance OSCs based on the LL method with a single type of green solvent.

Conclusion
With THF as the solvent, we fabricated high performance green solvent as-cast OSCs with PTQ10 as the donor and HO-IDIC-2F as the acceptor. The maximum PCE value of the devices can reach up to 12.20%, which is comparable with the efficiency of the device fabricated with CF as the solvent (12.43%). With thermal treatment at 100 °C for 8 hours, the PCE of the device can still reach up to 12.13%, which indicates the superior stable morphology of the active layer upon thermal stress. Moreover, with THF as the solvent, the LL method was also used to fabricate the devices with spin-coating and blade-coating methods. The optimal OSC with the LL spin-coating method can yield a PCE of 12.03% and the PCE of the OSC based on the LL blade-coating method can also reach up to 11.85%, which testifies that PTQ10 is suitable for the LL method with THF as the solvent. In a word, the outstanding thermal stability of the green solvent as-cast OSCs and the excellent photovoltaic performance of the OSCs based on the LL blade-coating method indicate that PTQ10:HO-IDIC-2F is highly conducive for commercial application, and low-cost PTQ10 is a highly promising polymer donor for high performance green solvent as-cast OSCs.
