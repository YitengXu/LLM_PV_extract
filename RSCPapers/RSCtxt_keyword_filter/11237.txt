    , Accepted 28th August 2012First published on 29th August 2012AbstractAn innovative solidified redox electrolyte for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) was prepared by incorporating amorphous silica nanoparticles in a liquid system containing the Co2+/Co3+ shuttle dissolved in methoxypropionitrile; the novel material was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and its optical properties were examined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties (diffusion, conductivity, electrolyte compatibility with the cathode) were studied in symmetrical thin layer cells using polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Quasi-solid DSCs were fabricated by incorporating this electrolyte and attained an efficiency of about 2.6% under 1 sun (under 1000 W m−2) AM1.5G illumination, corresponding to 73% of that gained by the reference liquid electrolyte; the cell efficiency depends on the light illumination conditions, significantly increased up to more than 4% under 0.23 sun. The solar cells were further characterized by EIS and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) to investigate charge transport and recombination dynamics, possible conduction band edge shifts, alterations of the interfacial and ohmic resistances, and variations of the diffusion rate through the photoelectrode. It was confirmed that the solidified electrolyte-based DSC presented a slightly enhanced photopotential in comparison with that of the liquid electrolyte due to a negative TiO2 conduction band edge shift upon contact with the electrolyte, accompanied with a decreased photocurrent mainly stemming from the restricted diffusion of the Co3+ species through the pores of the TiO2 photoelectrode.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are like standard photoelectrochemical cells that consist of two electrodes incorporating an electrolyte in between; the anode comprises of an n-type semiconductor (usually TiO2) with a wide band gap, sensitized by molecular dyes, polymers or semiconductor quantum dots. The cathode is usually a passive Pt electrode; the two electrodes are brought into close contact separated by a spacer, and the transfer of charges between them is realized through an electrolyte containing an active redox couple such as I−/I3−.1
Since the pioneering work of O'Regan and Grätzel back in 1991,2 the efficiency slowly progressed over the years toward 12%.3 These record efficiencies have been attained so far with the unbeatable I−/I3− redox shuttle that regenerates the dye very quickly and affords fast diffusion through the porous TiO2, which is rapidly reduced with a low overpotential at the counter electrode, and most importantly shows rather slow charge recombination. However, the standard redox potential of I−/I3−, being about +0.35 V vs. NHE,4 is far away from the typical oxidation potential of the dye. Thus a lot of energy is sacrificed for dye regeneration, preventing the DSC to arrive at large values of the photopotential (typical values of only 0.75 V were attained for high efficiency liquid DSCs employing the I−/I3− redox mediator).1b
To overpass this drawback, many alternative inorganic and organic redox couples with more positive potentials have been used,5 however, the real boost in efficiency came up with the use of Co2+/3+ redox shuttles in 2010 by the groups of L. Sun and A. Hagfeldt attaining very large photopotentials of the order of 0.9 V.6 Since then and in order to increase the overall conversion efficiencies, many efforts have been devoted focusing on the molecular structure of organic dyes,7 TiO2 films' morphology, thickness and porosity,8 cobalt mediators' redox potential,9 and cathode composition,10 reaching efficiencies of more than 10%.11 However, the actual breakthrough came only recently by the groups of Prof. Diau and M. Grätzel; when using a zinc porphyrin (YD2-o-C8), a power conversion efficiency of 11.9% was thereby attained, which increased up to 12.3% when a second pure organic dye (Y123) was employed to co-sensitize the TiO2 photoelectrode.12 These reports now open novel horizons towards further optimization of the solar cell performance, especially by modifying the optoelectronic properties of the organic dyes to reduce the effective optical gap, fine tuning the cobalt complexes structure to control their redox potential, using alternative solvents to better dissolve the redox couple and control diffusivity, preparing quasi-solid systems to improve cell stability and lifetime, etc.
In this direction and based on our experience on the fabrication of solidified electrolytes,13 in this work, for the first time in the literature, we have fabricated novel (iodine-free) electrolytes employing amorphous silica nanoparticles to solidify the standard [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ couple, an approach that has been proven to be very effective in solidifying electrolytes containing the I−/I3− redox shuttle.14 This new electrolyte was characterized in detail and then was incorporated in a sandwich-type solar cell configuration; the performance and characteristics of the corresponding DSCs were examined in direct comparison with those presented by the liquid electrolyte-based DSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
The D35 organic dye and the cobalt-based electrolyte were purchased from Dyenamo AB (Sweden). Fumed silica nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained from Sigma (S-5130, particle size: 7 nm, surface area: 390 m2 g−1) and were used without any further treatment (drying, etc.). Transparent conductive glass substrates were obtained from Pilkington (Active glass, 15 Ohm per square). DSL18NR-O TiO2-based paste was purchased from Dyesol UK and further diluted with a solution of ethyl cellulose–terpineol (6:4, w/w) before deposition. TiCl4 was bought from Fluka. Thermoplastic materials were purchased from Solaronix (Meltonix 1170-100).
2.2 Solidified electrolytes preparation
A liquid cobalt-based electrolyte containing 0.22 M [Co(bpy)3(PF6)2], 33 mM [Co(bpy)3(PF6)3], 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (where bpy stands for tris(2,2′-bipyridine)) dissolved in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) was used as a reference. This electrolyte was further solidified by adding an amount of silica NPs (5% w/w) under continuous stirring.
2.3 Electrodes preparation and solar cells assembly
To construct the photoelectrodes, opaque TiO2 films (about 3.7 μm thick, determined by an AMBIOS XP-2 profilometer) were deposited by doctor-blading a modified titania precursor paste (DSL18NR-O) on TiCl4 pre-treated transparent conductive glass substrates and sintered at 125 (5 min), 325 (15 min) and 525 °C for 30 min in air (heating rate: 5 °C min−1). Afterwards, the films were post-treated with an aqueous solution of 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C. Then, they were thoroughly cleaned with de-ionized water and ethanol and left to dry in air. Finally, the films were heated once again at 450 °C for 60 min and further sensitized by their immersion in an ethanolic solution of pure organic D35 dye (0.2 mM). Pt counter electrodes (100 nm thick) were prepared by sputtering. Open (non-sealed) DSCs were fabricated by putting a small drop of the electrolytes onto the sensitized photoelectrode and simply sandwiching the counter electrode against the first electrode. All DSCs had an active area of 0.25 cm2 and were tested one hour after their preparation.
2.4 Instrumentation
Raman analysis was performed on a Renishaw inVia Reflex spectrometer. The spectra of the two electrolytes (and components) were recorded in backscattering configuration employing a near infrared (NIR) diode laser (λ = 785 nm) as excitation source. Electronic spectra (UV-vis) of the electrolytes were recorded with a Hitachi 3010 spectrophotometer by measuring their reflectance (R%) and transmittance (T%). The UV-Vis spectra were presented in absorbance (A%) units (A% = 100R% − T%). The experiments were realized in 2-compartment pseudo cells consisting of two identical microscopy glasses separated by a thermoplastic spacer. The solidified electrolyte was incorporated between the electrodes and then the cell was sealed at 130 °C, while the liquid electrolyte was introduced in the cell under vacuum through a pre-drilled hole. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were recorded on thin layer symmetrical cells made of identical Pt blocking electrodes (prepared by sputtering) by filling them with the electrolytes. LSV experiments were conducted using an Autolab PGSTAT-30 potentiostat (Ecochemie) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and a voltage range from −0.7 to +0.7 V vs. Pt. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded on the above cells using the same potentiostat, equipped with a frequency response analyzer (FRA), at 0 V vs. Pt in the dark and recorded over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz. In order to accurately determine the conductivity cell constant, a calibration was carried out using a standard solution (10 mM of KCl in water) with a known conductivity (1413 μS cm−1). The obtained spectra were fitted with the FRA software provided by the Autolab in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits.
Current–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed by illuminating the DSCs using solar simulated light (1 sun, 1000 W m−2) from a 300 W Xe source in combination with AM 1.5G optical filters (Oriel). The active area of the DSCs was set at 0.15 cm2, using a large black mask in front of the cells in order to avoid any light peeping inside the cell.15 The J–V characteristics (under dark and light conditions) were recorded using linear sweep voltammetry on the Autolab potentiostat working in a 2-electrode mode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. EIS measurements on complete DSCs were performed under dark in a potential window from 0 to −0.9 V vs. Pt and electron transit times at different light intensities were determined by Intensity-Modulated Photocurrent Spectroscopy (IMPS) using the same system (Autolab). A red light (625 nm) emitting diode was used as the light source for both AC and DC illumination controlled by the FRA module.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Spectroscopic-electrooptic properties of the electrolytes
Both liquid and solid-state electrolytes were initially characterized spectroscopically (Fig. 1a). The Raman spectrum of the liquid electrolyte was dominated by the solvent (MPN). In addition, intense Raman peaks appeared at the 1000–1700 cm−1 region that could be identified with the vibrations of the pyridine rings of the Co-based complexes, the most prominent contribution arising from the Raman bands of the most abundant [Co(bpy)3(PF6)2] in the electrolyte formulation (a characteristic peak arising from LiClO4 could be found only at 934 cm−1, due to the stretching vibration of the perchlorate ion).16 The solidified electrolyte (liquid electrolyte endowed with silica NPs) presented only slight differences; a direct and clear contribution coming from SiO2 NPs was not evident (a sign of the silica NPs could be only traced as a weak contribution in the background of the Raman spectrum of the solidified electrolyte) since the broad peaks due to the phonon vibrations of amorphous SiO2 were essentially masked by the intense Raman bands of the liquid electrolyte. Silica NPs, depending on their percentage in the electrolytes, are considered to interact via the silanol (Si–OH) groups of their surface either with solvent molecules or with the silanol group of adjacent silica particles.17 In our case, the presence of a polar solvent such as MPN18 promotes the organization of the solvent molecules in the vicinity of silica particles, possibly via hydrogen bonding with the silanol groups on the silica surface; these are short-range repulsive forces (physical bonding) that could not give prominent shifts in a Raman spectrum.

For details, see the Experimental section. 
The light harvesting efficiency of the photoelectrode (that determines the obtained photocurrent and photovoltage) is affected by the electrolyte that penetrates the porous TiO2 electrode and possibly cut-offs useful light. To study the above phenomenon, the absorbance of both electrolytes was estimated (by transmittance and reflectance measurements) and the spectra are presented in Fig. 1b (the colour and physical condition of both electrolytes when stored in vials are shown by digital images as insets of Fig. 1b). Only marginal differences were observed between the liquid and the solidified electrolyte. In fact, it seems that silica nanoparticles with refraction indices of around 1.4–1.5 do not interfere with the transparency of the solidified electrolyte.19
3.2 Electrochemical properties of the electrolytes and cathode compatibility
Subsequently, the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes were studied in order to investigate ionic diffusion and conductivity that largely determine their effective behaviour in an electrochemical cell. Initially, the apparent diffusion coefficients of Co3+ species (Dapp) were estimated from the cathodic steady-state currents (due to the large excess of Co2+ species in the electrolyte, only the diffusion of Co3+ limits the current) of the linear sweep voltammograms (Fig. 1c) according to the relation Dapp = Jliml/(2nFC),20 where Jlim is the limiting current density, l is the distance between the two electrodes, F is the Faraday constant, C is the bulk concentration of the diffusion-limiting species and n is the number of electrons transferred in the Co3+ + e− → Co2+ redox reaction. The diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with the literature results (especially if we bear in mind that our solvent is MPN having a much higher viscosity than that of standard acetonitrile);7c the obtained Dapp for the solidified electrolyte (1.9 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) was about 53% of Dapp determined for the liquid electrolyte (3.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, Table 1), apparently due to the increased viscosity of the liquid electrolyte upon adding the silica NPs.

Additional data on the diffusion coefficients and simultaneous extra information about interfacial resistances (and thus the cathode/electrolyte compatibility) were obtained by EIS at thin layer cells.21 The corresponding EIS spectra of both electrolytes composed of two depressed semicircles (Fig. 1d) attributed to the charge transfer at the Pt–electrolyte interface and to the diffusion of ions in the electrolyte, respectively.22 By proper fitting of the EIS diagrams, the series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and double layer capacitance (Cdl) at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface10c were determined. An electrical equivalent circuit (which is essentially a modified version of the standard Randles circuit23 where the Warburg element for diffusion is replaced) of the type Rs(Cdl[RctO]) was used, where O is an element defining the diffusion complex impedance, expressed by the following equation: ZDif(ω) = RDif {[coth(jωτ)1/2]/(jωτ)1/2} with RDif = B/Yo and τ = B2. We must notice here that for more accurate fitting, a constant phase element (CPE) was employed in the equivalent circuit instead of Cdl.21 All the basic parameters, determined by spectral fitting, are summarized in Table 1. The two symmetrical cells, comprising the two electrolytes, differ in the ohmic resistance values, and since the two electrodes (and cables) are identical for both systems, this difference should be reflected at the conductivity of the electrolytes. Using the simple equation24κ = 1/ρ (and ρ = RsA/l), where κ is the specific conductivity, ρ is the resistivity and A is the active area of the cell in cm2, values of 3 and 2.4 mS cm−1 could be estimated for the liquid and solidified electrolyte, respectively. These values correlate very well with the observed differences in the diffusion coefficients. Additionally, the Co3+ diffusion coefficients could be independently determined using the following equation: DCo3+ = (0.5l/B)2.21 The obtained DCo3+ were lower (1.7 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 and 1.0 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for the liquid and solidified electrolyte, respectively) compared to those determined by linear sweep voltammetry, however, the tendency (57% smaller DCo3+ in the case of the solidified electrolyte) observed in polarization measurements was confirmed in this case, too. This feature is not unusual, since similar differences in diffusion coefficients were previously observed, when these are deduced from polarization or impedance spectroscopy measurements on symmetrical cells based on the standard I−/I3− redox couple.21
Another important issue is the dependence of the charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface (Rct) on solidification; here we should point out that extra EIS experiments (not shown) were realized under different anodic potentials (and we compared them with the standard MPN electrolytes containing the I−/I3− redox couple) to assure that the first semicircle is properly assigned to the charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface according to J. D. Roy-Mayhew et al.25 It is evident that no alteration of the Pt–electrolyte interface occurred by changing the electrolyte. It is worth mentioning that Rct for the solidified electrolyte is even lower (6.17 Ohm) than that obtained with the liquid electrolyte (6.90 Ohm), implying perfect wetting of the cathode by the solidified electrolyte. In any event, the solar cell performance (especially the fill factor) should not be largely affected by the Rct at the Pt–electrolyte interface even though later works have proven that graphene and polythiophene-based cathodes work better with the Co(II)/(III) redox mediator than those based on Pt.10 It is very important to notice that when we have used graphene cathodes (prepared by the group of Prof. L. Kavan10b) instead of Pt, no actual differences were observed, in full agreement with J. D. Roy-Mayhew et al.22
3.3 Solar cells photovoltaic performance
The two electrolytes were then incorporated in DSCs and their photovoltaic performance was compared; a batch of 5–6 cells was tested for each electrolyte with a small deviation in the attained performance (below the best cells are presented). The cells were first studied under standard 1 sun illumination; J–V curves are depicted in Fig. 2a, while Table 2 summarizes the cell performance and corresponding parameters derived from the J–V curves. The liquid electrolyte attained an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.52%, while the solidified electrolyte presented a lower performance with a η of 2.58%, both accompanied with large open-circuit photovoltages (Voc) of the order of 0.84–0.86 V due to the incorporation of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttle.26 The attained efficiencies were significantly lower when compared with others in the literature, mainly due to the use of fairly thin TiO2 photoelectrodes.6 In fact, the present DSCs reach 80% of the efficiency of J. D. Roy-Mayhew et al.,22 by using a similar electrolyte, dissolved in the much less volatile acetonitrile and by employing much thicker (18 μm) composite TiO2 films. Furthermore, despite the shortcoming of relatively low DSC efficiency, thin TiO2 films are ideally suited for the investigation of electrolyte effects in DSCs, since they facilitate electrolyte penetration inside the pores and also simplify the complexity of the electrical measurements.27

The corresponding J–V curves under dark (Fig. 2b) prove that the two cells have a similar onset of the cathodic current at around −0.4 V vs. Pt, while the relative magnitude of the dark current is similar. Their main difference arises from the significant shift of the dark current towards negative potentials (−57 mV) for the solidified electrolyte in comparison with the liquid electrolyte that could explain the observed differences in Voc (the solidified electrolyte attains a 19 mV higher Voc than that gained by the liquid electrolyte); this shift could be due to the decreased recombination of photoinjected electrons with Co3+ or due to a negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band energy level (these parameters will be explicitly studied in Section 3.4).
The lower performance attained by the solidified electrolyte is mainly due to the 25% loss of the photocurrent attained by the liquid electrolyte. This loss could be assigned to the more restricted diffusion of the ions in the “solid” (endowed with silica nanoparticles) environment (in agreement with the lower conductivity and diffusion, previously found for the solidified electrolyte). However, one question that arises is whether the solid character of this electrolyte prevents ions diffusion and limits mass transport only under strong light illumination.28 To study these phenomena, J–V curves were taken under different levels of illumination and the results are also included in Table 2. It was then found that when decreasing the illumination intensity, the solidified electrolyte was able to sustain about 85% of the photocurrent of the liquid electrolyte, implying that it could effectively work under low light conditions, by carrying the charges more easily between the two electrodes.
The short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of both cells was drawn against the incident light power density (Pin) (Fig. 2c) to emphasize the large deviation of both electrolytes from linearity above 0.5 sun (linearity is routinely found for electrolytes based on the I−/I3− redox mediator with sufficient content of both I− and I3− ions,29 while linearity was preserved at a large extent for both our systems up to 0.5 sun). This feature suggests that a photoelectrode with a more porous (greater porosity accompanied with larger pore volume) structure8 should be utilized to obtain high photocurrent values with MPN-based cobalt electrolytes under 1 sun illumination. The higher performance of the solidified electrolyte in achieving an increased photocurrent under low light conditions was directly reflected at the value of the overall conversion efficiency which, under 0.23 sun (AM1.5G, 230 W m−2), surpassed 4%. This is a very important result if we bear in mind that it is the first time in the literature that a solidified electrolyte based on the Co(II)/(III) couple is reported.
Finally, the semilogarithmic plots of Voc against the illumination intensity (Fig. 2d) confirmed the fact that for both cells the photovoltage depended linearly on the logarithm of the light intensity and the ideality diode factors (m) were estimated to be 1.15 and 1.37 for the liquid and solidified electrolytes, respectively. These values are in qualitative agreement with m factors estimated for the iodine/triiodide redox shuttle;30 the origin of this deviation from ideality has been frequently assigned to recombination through surface states.31
3.4 Solar cells electrical characterization
To better understand the photovoltaic behaviour (recombination dynamics, conduction band edge shifts, voltage drops through ohmic resistances or losses at the interfaces, etc.) of the different DSCs and correlate it with the electrolyte's composition, EIS was applied.32 The EIS spectra were recorded under dark (since EIS measurements are very time-consuming, the cells were not illuminated during the experiments in order to preserve performance stability during the whole measurement process) for a large potential window of 0 to −0.9 V vs. Pt. However, the classical behaviour, previously perceived for standard iodine-based electrolyte cells exhibiting three prominent semicircles,33 was observed only for a limited range of potentials close to Voc. Besides the fact that this feature rendered the fitting of the data rather difficult,27 analysis of the EIS experimental data was performed; the equivalent circuit used to fit the spectra was similar to the one utilized for the symmetrical cells by simply adding in series an extra RC circuit, which appeared at intermediate frequencies, representing the TiO2–electrolyte interface. Here, we focused on the diffusion impedance as well as on the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2–electrolyte interface (Rrec) and the chemical capacitance (Cμ) that stands for the change of the electron density as a function of the Fermi level.34
First, the Co3+ diffusion coefficients were derived again from the diffusion impedance as previously described (see Section 3.2). Values of 1.6 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 and 0.8 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 were estimated for the liquid and solidified electrolyte, respectively; these values were slightly lower than those derived from the polarization measurements in thin symmetrical cells (Table 1). We should emphasize here that the solidified electrolyte lost 20% of the initial diffusion coefficient (the liquid electrolyte lost only 5% of the initial DCo3+), obviously because the diffusion of the cobalt species is slower in the porous titania films than in the bulk of the electrolyte; these findings are supported by the literature27 and are very well correlated with the 25% loss of the photocurrent in the case of the solidified electrolyte.
Then, the recombination resistance was derived from the fitting and was plotted against the actual voltage drop in the photoelectrode (denoted as VF); VF was estimated as VF = Vapplied − Vseries, where VF is the corrected voltage, Vapplied is the applied voltage during the measurement and Vseries is the voltage drop at the total series resistance Rseries (Rseries is the sum of Rs, Rct and electrolyte's diffusion resistance).23 Here, we should note that the overall Rseries values of the solidified electrolyte-based solar cells were larger than those of the liquid electrolyte-based DSCs, in perfect agreement with the slightly decreased fill factors (FF) observed for the former DSC (Table 2). Rct showed an exponential behaviour with VF at the studied potentials range (Fig. 3a) following the equation32Rrec = [kT/qβj0]e−[qβVF/kT] where kT/q is the thermal voltage, β is a constant defined by the recombination model35 and j0 is the diode dark current.32 A simple inspection of Fig. 3a indicates that recombination is reduced in the case of the solidified electrolyte (in comparison with the liquid electrolyte). However, a correct comparison of the recombination rates between the two different DSCs could only be made if the ratio of free electrons to those located in traps is the same for both samples.30
 Fig. 3  (a) Recombination resistance (Rrec) plotted against the actual potential of the photoelectrode (VF), (b) chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the photoelectrode plotted against VF, (c) Rrec re-plotted against the voltage at the equivalent band position Vecb and (d) electron transit times calculated from IMPS versus Jsc delivered by the DSCs, incorporating the liquid and solidified electrolytes. 
To accomplish the above criterion, the chemical capacitance was estimated through fitting and plotted against VF (Fig. 3b); the capacitance values also show an exponential behaviour confirming the exponential trap energy distribution below the conduction band edge.36 If we assume that the two cells have similar trap distributions (since both use the same TiO2 working electrode), the observed shift of 80 mV, derived from the two plots in Fig. 3b, could be attributed to a negative shift in the conduction band edge (Ec).37 This Ec shift by the solidified electrolyte could be explained by the presence of silica nanoparticles with their surface covered by –OH groups that may interact (upon wetting of the electrolyte) with the TiO2 photoelectrode leading to its negative charging (it was previously found that silica nanoparticles show a slightly negative surface potential at low pH).38 A conduction band edge shift between liquid and gel electrolytes was previously observed by others too.39 This small negative Ec shift could also affect electron injection by the excited dye on the semiconductor by reducing the underlying driving force40 and thus leads to a decrease in Jsc. This small decrement of the injection could account for an extra 5% loss of photocurrent by the solidified electrolyte-based DSC in comparison with the 20% lower diffusion coefficient.
Taking as reference the energy of the conduction band edge for the solidified electrolyte-based DSC and shifting the (Rrec − VF) curve of the liquid electrolyte based-DSC (Fig. 3a) by 80 mV towards negative values, we could draw again Rrec against Vecb (Fig. 3c), that is the voltage at the equivalent band position.32 Thereby, we were able to directly compare the recombination resistances of the liquid and solidified electrolyte-based DSCs independently of conduction band edge shifts. It was then evidenced that the recombination rates of both cells are similar. We could thus conclude that the small increase of Voc using the solidified electrolytes is mainly due to the Ec shift and not because of differences in recombination; the observed discrepancy between the shift in Ec (80 mV) and the Voc increase (19 mV) could be due to Fermi level pinning in the case of the solidified electrolyte-based DSC, arising from increased recombination via surface states, which is also corroborated by the higher ideality factor m in the case of the solidified electrolyte deduced in the previous section.
IMPS experiments were conducted to determine the electron transit times (τtr) at different Jsc values for the different electrolytes (Fig. 3d). It was then found that the transit times for the electrons to reach the back contact are somewhat increased in the case of the solidified electrolyte, thus partially justifying the lower Jsc of the corresponding cell (besides lower values of diffusion and conductivity); however, there is no reason for the electron transport to be different for the two electrolytes, therefore we think that charge transport would be similar under the same Fermi level.
Even though there is a slight efficiency decrease of the solar cell due to the use of a solid electrolyte (although it is very close to the energy conversion efficiency for the solar cells containing the corresponding liquid electrolytes), we consider that there is significant advancement in science. In fact, for practical applications, it is necessary to substitute the liquid electrolytes with solid materials in order to improve the DSCs lifetime and stability. The main novelty and innovation in this work is that for the first time in the literature such solidification was performed on electrolytes using novel redox shuttles (Co2+/Co3+), also compatible with organic dyes. Such an approach avoids serious corrosion problems and losses from enhanced light absorption encountered with the classical iodide/triiodide redox couple and opens new horizons for the development of highly efficient solid-state DSCs. Thus, we are confident that this kind of novel electrolytes could be used in cases where a liquid electrolyte “washes away” small nanoparticles deposited at the TiO2 surface; for instance PbS and CdS (or core shell PbS–PbSe and CdS–CdSe) quantum dots seem to be unstable in a liquid environment (this is why research has been recently focused in solid-state and/or Schottky-type quantum dot solar cells).41 In the same context, the novel solidified electrolytes could be used in highly efficient perovskite nanoparticle-based cells (very recently reported in the literature)42 that suffer from stability issues when using liquid electrolytes.
4. Conclusions
For the first time in the literature, a quasi-solid redox electrolyte based on the novel Co2+/Co3+ charge mediator was prepared upon solidification of the corresponding liquid electrolyte using amorphous silica nanoparticles. The incorporation of the solidified electrolyte in a DSC configuration resulted in an efficiency of 2.6% (retaining 73% of that obtained by the liquid electrolyte). This efficiency was further enhanced up to about 4% (attaining 84% of the efficiency gained by the DSC based on the reference liquid electrolyte) by selecting light illumination conditions, where the linearity of the photocurrent with light power density is preserved. The relatively lower efficiency of the quasi-solid DSCs was due to reduced Jsc and slightly lower FF; the decrease of the photocurrent was assigned to reduced values of conductivity and diffusion of the Co3+ cations, especially when these redox active species have to diffuse through the pores of the TiO2 photoelectrode. The lower FF was attributed to increased Rseries values mainly due to the increase of the diffusion impedance. In contrast, the solidified electrolyte-based DSCs presented a slightly increased Voc, achieving values of about 0.86 V, due to a negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge; this shift might arise from the interaction of the photoelectrode with slightly negatively charged silica nanoparticles.
Extensive work is now under progress to investigate and optimize the stability of these novel composite materials, taking into account that the current literature is very poor in data concerning the stability of DSCs based on the Co2+/Co3+ couple, even for pure liquid electrolytes. Totally novel and revolutionary roads are now open for these novel redox shuttles (Co2+/Co3+) due to the fact that for the first time since many years, scientists involved in the field are convinced that the iodide/triiodide mediator is not unbeatable.
