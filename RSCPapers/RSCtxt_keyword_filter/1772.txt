    , Accepted 17th December 2020First published on 17th December 2020AbstractWe investigated the structural and optical properties of various 2-dimensional (2D) perovskites by incorporating them into a 3-dimensional (3D) perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3 = MA) to address the disadvantages of the existing 3D perovskite. When the 2D perovskites ((BA)2PbI4, (BZA)2PbI4, EAPbI3, (GA)2PbI4, (IM)2Pb2I7 and (PEA)2PbI4 (butylammonium (BA), benzylammonium (BZA), ethylammonium (EA), guanidium (GA), imidazolium (IM) and phenethylammonium (PEA)) were incorporated into the 3D perovskite (MAPbI3), the optical and electrical properties were changed. In particular, the GA2PbI4 mixed with MAI perovskite showed a significantly decreased optical band gap compared to the other mixed perovskites. Remarkable photoluminescence emissions in (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (GA)(MA)PbI4 perovskites were observed compared to their 2D perovskites. Compared to those of the pure 2D perovskites, the longer average carrier lifetimes obtained for the mixed perovskites suggest that the incorporation of the 3D perovskite into the 2D perovskite induced an increase of the efficiency of charge transfer. The optical constants (n and k) of the mixed perovskites are found to significantly increase compared with those of the 2D perovskites. It can be attributed to the larger oscillator strength of excitons in the mixed perovskite than that for the 2D perovskite.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells have gained significant interest, attaining certified efficiencies of 25.2% in power conversion efficiency (PCE)1 from an initial PCE of 3.8% (ref. 2) during the past several years. Their superior photovoltaic performance is attributed to their high absorption, high extinction coefficient, ambipolar charge transport and long carrier diffusion length. However, the intrinsic structural instability of perovskite solar cells under ambient oxygen and humidity is the biggest obstacle against the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. Meanwhile, it was reported that low dimensional perovskite structures are very stable because excitons in low dimensional structures have a high binding energy (0.36 eV) even at room temperature.3,4 In particular, 2-dimensional (2D) perovskite structures, which consist of inorganic layers that have electronic functionality and organic layers that act as a template for the structure, are also able to tune the band structure and are soluble in a wide range of solvents. Because these materials have high conductivity and can be processed in a solution, they show promise as a new class of tunable semiconductors for future solar cell technology. One of the potential structures of 2D perovskites for photovoltaic application is the 2D multilayered halide perovskite (2D MHP), which has the generic structural formula of (A)2(A′)n−1MnX3n+1 (n is an integer), where A represents a primary aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium cation; A′ is a small size cation (Cs, CH3NH3 (MA) or HC(NH2)2) for the formation of the stable three-dimensional (3D) perovskite; M is a divalent metal, and X represents halide ions. Most of the 2D MHPs can be subcategorized as a (100), (110), or (111)-oriented perovskite depending on the cut of the framework of the three-dimensional (3D) cubic type perovskite. A 3D perovskite consists of an interconnection of corner sharing MX6-octahedra with the A′ cation filling the voids between these octahedra. Typically, to induce the formation of a 2D MHP, the A′ cation of the 3D perovskite must be fully or partially replaced with bulkier cations (A). Among the (100) oriented 2D MHPs, Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites5,6 are the most common structure type, which is commonly built with primary mono and diammonium cations. As a consequence, RP perovskites have been explored as potential alternatives to 3D perovskites for use in photovoltaic applications due to their long term stability.7
Herein, we chose small sized ammonium cations, which included butylammonium (BA), benzylammonium (BZA), ethylammonium (EA), guanidium (GA), imidazolium (IM) and phenethylammonium (PEA), to prepare 2D perovskites that have higher resistance to humidity and oxygen compared to 3D perovskites. Because 2D perovskites have a larger band gap compared to 3D perovskites and a dielectric mismatch between the inorganic layer and the organic layer, the mobility and dissociation of the excitons are decreased. As a result, the localized free carriers are prevented from reaching the selective electron/hole contacts in a typical solar cell. To achieve more favorable electric properties for solar cells, these cations were introduced into 3D CH3NH3PbI3 to form a quasi 2D perovskite, in which the 3D frameworks were sliced by the bulky organic cation, resulting in the formation of a quantum well structure. All the mixed perovskites had a medium band gap in the range of Eg = 1.84–2.35 eV. In particular, the MA incorporating GA2PbI4 perovskite had a significantly decreased optical band gap compared to the other mixed perovskites because they had an accessible interlayer space for the insertion of the MA cation. The highest efficiency for the solar cell was obtained with the MA incorporating GA2PbI4 perovskite because it had the smallest band gap among all the mixed perovskites. This result indicates that the properties of a mixed perovskite are mainly dependent on the structure of the 2D perovskite.
2. Experimental section
1) 2D perovskite synthesis
For (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2PbI4 ((BA)2PbI4), a 100 mL two-neck round-bottom flask was charged with 5.0 mL of stabilized HI (7.58 M) with 1 mL of H3PO2 (9.14 M). The mixture was degassed with nitrogen for 1 min, and the flask was kept under nitrogen for the duration of the experiment. The flask was heated in an oil bath to 120 °C, and PbO (223 mg, 1 mmol) was added and then stirred vigorously until the solid dissolved completely. Butylamine (146 mg, 2 mmol) was neutralized with 1 mL of HI in a separate vial under stirring. The protonated butylamine solution was added into the previous solution under heating at 120 °C and stirred for 5 min. Orange plate crystals precipitated during slow cooling to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered and measured for the crystal structure, optical properties and solar cell fabrication.
For the other perovskites, they follow the same route except the ratio was changed to 223 mg (1 mmol) of PbO, 287 mg (2 mmol) of benzylamine hydrochloride for (C6H5CH2NH3)2PbI4 ((BZA)2PbI4), 223 mg (1 mmol) of PbO, 163 mg (2 mmol) of ethylamine hydrochloride for C2H5NH3PbI3 (EAPbI3), 446 mg (2 mmol) of PbO, 541 mg (3 mmol) of guanidine carbonate for (C(NH2)3)2PbI4 ((GA)2PbI4), 223 mg (1 mmol) of PbO, 68 mg (1 mmol) of imidazole for (C3N2H5)2Pb2I7 ((IM)2Pb2I7) and 223 mg (1 mmol) of PbO, 242 mg (2 mmol) of phenethylamine for (PEA)2PbI4. The synthesis procedure for each compound was explained in the ESI† in detail.
2) Mixed perovskite synthesis
For (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7,8 a 100 mL two-neck round-bottom flask was charged with 5.0 mL of stabilized HI (7.58 M) with 1 mL of H3PO2 (9.14 M). The mixture was degassed with nitrogen for 1 min, and the flask was kept under nitrogen for the duration of the experiment. The flask was heated in an oil bath to 120 °C, and PbO (446 mg, 2 mmol) was added and then stirred vigorously until the solid dissolved completely. Subsequently, the addition of the solid powder MACl (135 mg, 2 mmol) to the hot yellow solution initially produced a black precipitate, which subsequently dissolved under heating to boiling. Then, 287 mg (2 mmol) of benzylamine hydrochloride powder was added directly to the above solution under heating. A deep orange plate-like crystal precipitate was produced during slow cooling to room temperature. For (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7,9 it followed the same route as (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 except that 146 mg (2 mmol) of butylamine was neutralized with 1 mL of HI. For (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7,10 it followed the same route as the method above except that 242 mg (2 mmol) of phenethylamine was neutralized with 1 mL of HI. For (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7,11 it followed the same route as the method above except that 163 mg (2 mmol) of ethylamine hydrochloride powder was added directly to the PbO solution under heating. For (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7, it followed the same route as the route above except that the ratio was changed as follows: 223 mg (1 mmol) of PbO, 68 mg (1 mmol) of MACl and 68 mg (1 mmol) of imidazole powder. For (GA)(MA)PbI4, it followed the same route as the route above except that 374 mg (2 mmol) of guanidinium iodide powder was added directly to the PbO solution under heating.12
3) Single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis
The single crystal of perovskites was coated with Paratone-N oil, and the diffraction data were measured at 298 K with synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.61000 Å) on an ADSC Quantum-210 detector at BL2D SMC with a silicon (111) double crystal monochromator (DCM) at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Korea. The PAL BL2D-SMDC program13 was used for data collection (detector distance is 63 mm, omega scan; Δω = 3°, exposure time is 1 s per frame), and HKL3000sm (Ver. 703r)14 was used for cell refinement, reduction, and absorption correction. The crystal structures of perovskites were solved by direct methods with the SHELXT-2014 program15 and refined using full-matrix least-squares calculations with the SHELXL-2014 program package.16
4) Characterization
The time-resolved PL (TRPL) study was performed using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, Picoquant, Germany) with a 40× objective in Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu. A single-mode pulsed diode laser (LDH-P-C-470, Picoquant, Germany) with a 5 MHz repetition rate, ∼30 ps pulse width, and <1 μW average power was used as an excitation source. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a long-pass filter (HQ500lp, AHF), a 75 μm pinhole, a band-pass filter, and a single photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect emissions from the samples. The time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique was used to count fluorescence photons. TRPL images consisting of 200 × 200 pixels were recorded using the time-tagged time-resolved (TTTR) data acquisition method. Exponential fittings for the obtained PL decays with a temporal resolution of 16 ps, which were extracted from the TRPL images, were performed using Symphotime-64 software (Ver. 2.2) with the exponential decay model; I(t) = ∑Aie−t/τi, where I(t) is the time-dependent PL intensity, A is the amplitude, and τ is the PL lifetime. The steady-state PL spectra were measured by dividing and guiding the PL signal through an optical fiber to the external spectrometer (F-7000, Hitachi). The spectrometric ellipsometry measurements were performed at room temperature and low humidity (<30% RH). The data on thin films were gathered using a VASE-ellipsometer from J. A. Woollam Co., Inc. equipped with an Autoretarder™. Optical spectra of thin films were recorded from ca. 1.3 eV to 4.2 eV, at three incidence angles for each sample (65°, 70° and 75°). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out using an AXIS ultra-delay line detector (DLD) (Kratos Inc.) in KBSI, Daejeon and the He I (21.22 eV) emission line was employed as a UV source.
The optical diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using an Agilent (Cary-5000) UV-vis-NIR system. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used as the non-absorbing reference material of 100% reflectance. The reflectance versus wavelength was converted to absorption data to calculate the band gap (Eg) using the Kubelka–Munk equation:17α/S = (1 − R)2(2R)−1, where R is the reflectance, and α and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using an Empyrean PANalytical instrument with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 1.54056 Å), and a Ni filter plus a graphite monochromator. The morphology of the perovskite film was obtained using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8010).
5) Solar cell fabrication
N-type TiO2 layer formation was as follows. A 50 nm compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO substrate by spin coating (2000 rpm, 30s) a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) in ethanol (350 μL TTIP in 5 mL EtOH containing 0.013 M HCl), and then the sintering process was conducted at 550 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated on the TiO2 compact layer with diluted TiO2 paste (DYESOL-30NRD) with ethanol with a ratio of 1:3.5 w/w at 500 rpm for 5 s, 3000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s. The substrate was further treated with a 20 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. A 40 wt% perovskite was dissolved in the mixed DMF and DMSO (4:1 vol%) solvent. The solution was spin coated on the N type TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by the annealing process at 100 °C for 20 min. A solution for spiro-MeOTAD coating was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) were added.18 Spiro-MeOTAD was deposited at 4000 rpm for 30 s on the perovskite layer. A gold layer of 800 Å for the counter electrode was deposited on the perovskite layer with thermal evaporation at 1.5 Å s−1. The photocurrent (Jsc) and photovoltage (Voc) of the solar cells were measured with an active area of 0.175 cm2 using a Keithley 2400 source meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91192), which offered simulated solar light at AM 1.5, calibrated with a NIST-certified monocrystalline Si solar cell (Newport 532 ISO1599). The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using an IQE200B designed by Newport Corporation. A 100 W xenon lamp was applied as the light source for the monochromatic beam. For the calibration of its monochromatic light intensity, a reference silicon photodiode (NIST-calibrated photodiode G425) was used.
3. Results and discussion
The 2D perovskite was synthesized from a stoichiometric reaction between PbO, alkylamine iodide, or free amine in concentrated HI containing H3PO2. We chose compounds that have small organic cations, which have a primary aliphatic or aromatic ammonium compound. The prepared 2D perovskites have an orange or yellow color (Fig. 1). The (BZA)2PbI4, (BA)2PbI4, and (PEA)2PbI4 perovskites have an orange color while the EAPbI3, (IM)2Pb2I7 and GAPbI3 perovskites have a bright yellow color associated with the 1D perovskite structure.19 The crystal structures of (BZA)2PbI4, (BA)2PbI4, (PEA)2PbI4, EAPbI3, (IM)2Pb2I7 and GA2PbI4 are shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed crystallographic data are listed in Table 1.

The crystal structure of (BZA)2PbI4 is orthorhombic with the space group Pbca. The corner-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra were separated by the two unique intercalated BZA cations, for which the ammonium head of BZA is connected with the two iodides in the axial position of the [PbI6]4− organic layer.20–22 (BA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 crystallize in the orthorhombic centrosymmetric space group Pbca, with lattice parameters a = 8.8570 Å, b = 8.6750 Å and c = 27.435 Å,23,24 and in the monoclinic centrosymmetric space group C2/m, with lattice parameters a = 32.572 Å, b = 6.139 Å, c = 6.189 Å and β = 93.64°,25 as previously reported, respectively. EAPbI3 has a phase transition process from the metastable phase (μ-EAPbI3) to the thermodynamic phase (θ-EAPbI3) at 130 °C.19 The EAPbI3 perovskite consists of infinite chains of face-sharing octahedra (PbI6) along the b-axis, which are separated by the EA cation. The crystal structure of IM2Pb2I7 is built up from the IM cation double layer separated by the inorganic Pb2I73− bilayer. The (GA)2PbI4 perovskite consists of corrugated 2D [PbI6]4− layers that are produced by slicing the 3D perovskite in the (110) direction. Each layer forms a corner connected pattern that expands through the linear connection of the [PbI6]4− octahedra along one crystallographic direction (c axis), and a zigzag arrangement in the other direction (a axis) with three consecutive octahedra forming a Pb–I–Pb–I–Pb dihedral angle of 90° between the two intersecting planes defined by the apex-sharing [Pb2I8]4− octahedral pairs. Half of the GA cations sat in the pockets generated by the undulated layers, while the other half occupied the interlayer space, which produced a layer separation of 4.6 Å.19,26

Fig. 3 shows the band gaps of the 2D perovskites. The band gaps of the 2D perovskites are between 2.17 and 2.38 eV due to the quantum confinement effect from the dimensional reduction of the perovskite chromophore. In addition to the primary absorption edge, another peak appeared above the absorption edge. This secondary absorption is attributed to a long lived excitonic state trapped in the strong electric field generated by the localized positive organic ions around the negatively charged inorganic layers.9,27 This local electric field provided the charge screening that prevented the long-range separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pair, which increased its recombination probability. However, the same behavior decreased in the absorption spectra of the mixed perovskites (Fig. 3b). In the 2D perovskites, this excitonic behavior (secondary absorption) arises as a result of the quantum confinement effect between the insulating organic layers and the inorganic semiconducting layer. However, the excitonic peak progressively subsides as the number of inorganic layer increases. Consistent with the reduction of the quantum confinement effect, as shown in Fig. 3b, the secondary absorption peaks were weakened in the absorption spectra of the mixed perovskites due to the increased thickness of the inorganic layer, exhibiting a decreased optical band gap compared to the 2D perovskites. However, in particular, the excitonic behaviour was not observed in the EAPbI3 and (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites. The reason is that the crystal structure of EAPbI3 is crystallized to a long chain-like 1D structure, which consists of only face-sharing PbI6 octahedra.28,29 It does not form the layered crystal structure composed of alternating organic and inorganic layers. This caused the decrease in the quantum confinement effect, resulting in very weak excitonic peaks in the absorption spectra. In the 2D layered (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite, the radius of the EA cation is about 0.23 nm, which is greater than that of the MA cation (0.18 nm) but smaller than that of the formamidinium (FA) cation. Thus, we estimated that since EA is considered to be a too small space molecule compared to the general bulkier organic space groups, the effect of quantum confinement in the (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite appears insignificant.

The high resolution PXRD data of the 2D perovskites were collected, and all the perovskite lattice parameter values were extracted using the Rietveld refinement method (Fig. 4). The experimental data show excellent agreement with the theoretical patterns determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The 2D perovskites were derived from the 3D structure, in which the corner-sharing PbX6-octahedra were interconnected and the large void between these octahedra was filled with the small size cations, by slicing the inorganic lattice along the (100), (110) and (111) crystallographic planes with the elimination of the octahedral layer in the slicing plane, leading to a common 2D compound with a single-octahedron or a thicker one. The (BZA)2PbI4 and (BA)2PbI4 perovskites exhibited preferential growth along the (110) direction, thus exclusively revealing the (00 l) reflections shown in Fig. 5.9 Once the layer was thicker (n > 1), the BA (or BZA) cations compete to occupy the planar layer while the MA ions try to expand the perovskite growth outside the layer. This phenomenon can be confirmed from the (111) and (202) reflections showing vertical growth in the mixed-perovskites (Fig. 5a and b).9 It was also observed in the (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (GA)(MA)PbI4 perovskites, which have peaks at 14° and 28°. These peaks are from the scattering of the (002)/(110) and (004)/(220) crystal planes, respectively, due to the expansion of the c-axis of the perovskite unit cell (Fig. 5c and d). Meanwhile, the (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite has the same growth direction as (IM)2Pb2I7 due to the resonance effect of the imidazole ring (Fig. 5e). The imidazole cation is an aromatic hydrocarbon and diammonium molecule with a small ionic radius (258 pm). It is appropriately alloyed with the conventional MAPbI3 and due to the delocalized π orbital of imidazole with hydrogen bonding with I of the neighboring PbI64− octahedron framework, it may allow low reactivity with its surroundings, leading to increased electrical conductivity. Kim et al.30 reported that the optimal content of the imidazole cation incorporated into the MAPbI3 perovskite exhibited a PCE of up to 20.2% in solar cell devices due to superior stability with improved electronic structures. Moreover, passivation of the imidazole cation in the MAPbI3 perovskite film has been reported to improve the film quality and crystallinity, yielding a PCE of 17%.31 Similarly, the (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite has the same growth direction as (PEA)2PbI4 because the PEA cation is severely disordered in the perovskite structure (Fig. 5f) (note that we measured the XRD as a single crystal powder without grinding the perovskite to show the crystal growth direction of the mixed perovskite).

Fig. 6 shows the normalized PL spectra of the 2D perovskites and their quasi-2D perovskites. Compared with the 2D perovskites, the PL peaks of the quasi-2D perovskites all shift to the long wavelength direction. We provide the intensity of PL emission of the 2D and mixed perovskites in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Except for the (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites, the marked difference between the spectra of the 2D perovskite and mixed perovskite is that the mixed perovskite shows significantly increased PL emission intensity (several thousand orders) relative to the 2D perovskite under comparable excitation conditions, suggesting that the organic space layer between the perovskite layers has a significant effect on PL emission. (BZA)2PbI4 shows multiple emissions at around 530 nm and 750 nm, while (PEA)2PbI4 shows multiple emissions at around 520 nm and 700 nm, respectively. It was estimated that the longer wavelength band originates most probably from defect-related or disorder-activated recombination via sub-bandgap states. Herein, since we measured the PL of the single crystals of the 2D and mixed perovskites, the difference in PL emission between (PEA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites can be explained by the layered 2D perovskite crystal structure rather than the perovskite thin film. As shown in Fig. 6, the 2D (PEA)2PbI4 perovskite shows a narrow single emission line in the wavelength range of 500 to 600 nm, which is different from (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7. The PL intensity of the (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite is obviously increased in the range from 650 to 800 nm which corresponds to the PL emission from the plate layer of the 3D perovskite in the layered 2D and 3D mixed perovskite.

The electronic structure of the 2D perovskites was studied by UPS (Fig. 7). For each compound, the top panel shows the top of the occupied states (Fig. 7a and b); the bottom panel shows the photoemission cut-off, from which the work function of the surface is extracted (Fig. 7c). While the valence band maximum (VBM) is determined from the first ionization energy at low binding energy, the position of the conduction band minimum (CBM) relative to the vacuum level (Evac) was estimated from the difference between the optical band gap and the VBM position.32,33 All energies are referenced to a common Fermi level (EF) of the Au substrate (0 eV). As shown in Fig. 7a, the onset of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is at 0.89 eV below the EF for IM2Pb2I7, which has the lowest binding energy to ionize compared to the other perovskites. The HOMO level of the GA2PbI4 perovskite was located at 1.35 eV below the EF, respectively. It was relatively observed at a higher binding energy among the 2D perovskites, which led to an ionization energy (IE) of 5.96 eV. The HOMO levels of the EAPbI3, (BA)2PbI4, (PEA)2PbI4, and (BZA)2PbI4 perovskites were slightly closer to the EF compared to the GA2PbI4 perovskite and were found at 1.09, 1.03, 0.97 and 0.91 eV, respectively. We calculated the work function (WF) of the 2D perovskites from the secondary-electron cutoff region shown in Fig. 7c. The photoemission cut off energy was influenced by the interface dipole of the perovskite layers, which indicated the change of the WF according to the surface properties of the perovskite. In contrast to the HOMO energy level, the WF of the GA2PbI4 film was 4.61 eV, which was the smallest value among the perovskites. Even though the IM2Pb2I7 perovskite had a low HOMO energy level, it exhibited a larger WF value, which resulted in a higher IE value (5.94 eV). To predict the hole extraction at the interface between the perovskite VBM and the hole transporting layer (HTL) HOMO levels, Fig. 7d shows the energy level of the 2D perovskite for the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au solar cell configuration. All of the perovskites had a VBM energy closer to the HOMO level of the HTL, which indicates no hole extraction barriers. However, because the HOMO level of the HTL is in a position 100 meV higher than that of the perovskite VBM, the built-in field and collection of the hole were constrained, and it causes the Voc to decrease from the device point of view. We conducted the UPS measurement on the mixed perovskites as shown in Fig. 8. Compared to the pure 2D perovskites, all the mixed perovskites show higher HOMO level values, indicating a shift from the Fermi level (Fig. 8a and b). This can be explained by the increase of the dielectric constant due to the coexistence of 2D and 3D perovskites. However, the WF values of the mixed perovskites were lower than those of the corresponding 2D perovskites (Fig. 8c). It was estimated that the conductivity was improved as the 3D perovskite was incorporated into the 2D perovskite. The energy level diagram in the mixed perovskites is shown in Fig. 8d. The perovskite VBM is higher than the HOMO level of the HTL, which is the same trend as the 2D perovskite, whereas the energy barrier is lower between the perovskite CBM and TiO2 CBM compared to the 2D perovskite case. It can increase the current collection in the device, resulting in the improvement of Jsc.

To evaluate the charge transfer in the perovskite layer, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence measurements at room temperature. The emission lifetimes for the PL decay were obtained at 2.34 eV for (BZA)2PbI4 and (GA)2PbI4, 2.38 eV for (BA)2PbI4, IM2Pb2I7 and (PEA)2PbI4, and 2.21 eV for EAPbI3, respectively. The observed PL decays were fitted with exponential decay curves to yield the lifetime of excitons or carriers using the intensity and amplitude average life time.34 We determined the average emission life time based on previous reports.35–37 In Fig. 9a, three decay time constants were required to fit the experimental curve of (BZA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4, whereas for the other perovskites, two decay constants were needed to fit the result. We summarized the decay time constants in Table 2. The fast decay process (τ1) corresponded to the direct recombination of excitons, which contributes to the PL fast decay in the 2D and mixed perovskites, while the slower decay process (τ2 and τ3) is the result of trap state formation in the layered perovskite.38–41 The trap states are caused by the electron–phonon coupling process and susceptible to the deformation of the perovskite crystal structure.38 The photo-excited electron in the excitonic state could be trapped in these trap states, and also could be returned to the excitonic state by thermal activation. The holes have a similar kinetic path to the electrons. This recombination is called indirect recombination because more paths of trapping and detrapping are included.42 Since the holes have heavier mass than the electrons, they show a slower decay compared to the electrons. Thus, the decays of electrons and holes can be designated as the intermediate time (τ2) and long time (τ3), respectively. As shown in Table 2, all the 2D perovskites show that the fastest decay process (τ1) component, corresponding to radiative recombination of excitons, was over 96%, which contributed the most to the carrier lifetime. In this respect, in 2D perovskites, a much more efficient direct recombination of excitons dominantly occurred rather than indirect recombination due to the trapping–detrapping recombination. In particular, the (BZA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 perovskites showed the longest carrier lifetimes (7 ns for (BZA)2PbI4 and 33 ns for (PEA)2PbI4, respectively) among the perovskites, which indicates that after photo-excitation, they rapidly return to the ground state with simultaneous effective PL emission compared to the other 2D perovskites. In addition, the image mapping of the PL emission of the (BZA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 perovskites also exhibited a much longer lifetime among the perovskites (Fig. 9b).

When MAI was introduced to the 2D perovskite structure, the carrier lifetimes were increased except for (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (Fig. 10a). We summarized the decay time constants in Table 3. Compared to those of the pure 2D perovskites, the longer average carrier lifetime obtained for the mixed perovskites suggests that the incorporation of the 3D perovskite into the 2D perovskite induced an increase of the efficiency of charge transfer. It directly translates into an improved device performance. As can be seen in the image mapping of the emission decay results (Fig. 10b), the carrier lifetimes of the mixed materials were found to be longer than those of the 2D perovskites.

We also compared the single crystals and thin films in TRPL measurement. Thin films of 2D and mixed perovskites were prepared by dissolving 1 mmol of single crystal powders of the above compounds in 1 mL of a mixture solvent of DMF/γ-butyrolactone (volume ratio = 3:1). The precursor solution was spin-coated onto a glass substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 11 and Table 4, the films of (BZA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 perovskites have a significantly reduced carrier lifetime compared to their single crystal powder. The carrier lifetimes of the rest of the films show a similar trend to their single crystal powders. In the films of mixed perovskites (Fig. 12), the (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7 film was found to have the longest carrier lifetime (169 ns) among the thin films of mixed perovskites. (GA)(MA)PbI4 and (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 have longer average lifetimes of 23 ns and 9.11 ns, respectively, compared to the other mixed perovskites (Table 5). In general, these carrier lifetimes and cell performance showed a tendency to be proportional to some extent because solar cells based on (GA)(MA)PbI4 and (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 exhibit the highest efficiency among the solar cells.

Fig. 13 and 14 show the optical constants n and k (index of refraction and extinction coefficient) for the perovskites determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry of the thin films. They were determined by simultaneously fitting a Cody–Lorentz oscillator model43 to Ψ and Δ in ellipsometry measurement. As shown in Fig. 13, the extinction coefficients and refractive indexes for the 2D perovskites show the absorption edge with a strong excitonic transition. The n of all the 2D perovskites has a peak around the bandgap, which is higher compared to the 3D MAPbI3 perovskite (Fig. S2†). The n and k spectra of (BZA)2PbI4, EAPbI3 and (GA)2PbI4 perovskites exhibit several peaks above the absorption edge, which is associated with the electronic inter-band transitions.44,45 The optical response of the perovskites depends on the transition from the highest valence band to the lowest conduction band. In particular, the organic moieties in the perovskite structures had a significant influence on the position of the band gap, which suggests that the orientation of the organic moieties could result in variation of the optical constant. Leguy et al.46 compared the optical properties of MAPbI3 for the tree isotropic MA+ equilibrium alignments. According to the orientation of the organic moieties, even though the extinction coefficients show a similar shape over the measured range, it shows some important variation. This is attributed to the difference in the orientation of the dipole to the spatial direction of organic molecules. This could be observed in the ferroelectric (polarized material) domain, which forms the perovskite layers. However, in this study, since we have measured the optical constant for the thin films of 2D and mixed perovskites, the orientation of the organic moieties is unlikely to explain the variation of the optical constant. Since the orientation of the grain is distributed randomly, we believed that the measured optical constants represent the average of the domain orientation. The mixed perovskites showed the same trend as the pure 2D perovskites (Fig. 14). In particular, a very sharp edge at the absorption edge was found in the n and k of the (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites. The n and k of the mixed perovskites are found to generally increase compared with those of the 2D perovskites. It can be attributed to the larger oscillator strength of excitons in the mixed perovskites that that for the 2D perovskites. The n and k of the (GA)(MA)PbI4 and (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites were quite different from those of the pure 2D perovskites. This result suggests that the mixed structure generated by the two organic cations had a significant influence on the variation of the optical properties. In addition, the discrepancies were attributed to the void existence, mixture of crystalline and amorphous phases, and scattering effect from the randomness of perovskite polycrystals in the thin films.47

Since the device performance is determined by the film morphology, it was examined using SEM. Fig. 15 shows the SEM images of the morphology of (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (GA)(MA)PbI4, (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite films. The (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 film shows a wrinkled compact film. Both (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 films also show a continuous smooth film containing randomly-orientated small crystalline grains and are almost pinhole free. This result shows that the cations with rigid benzene rings have the advantage of forming compact films as in a previous report.31 However, since the crystal size of both films is very small, it is closer to an amorphous film rather than the crystalline large-grained film for high efficiency solar cells.32 The morphology of the (GA)(MA)PbI4 perovskite exhibits a compact film of small-sized particles. The (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7 film shows a small domain with a large grain boundary, which increased the charge recombination, leading to a decrease in the solar cell efficiency. Unlike the previous films, small-sized single crystals were observed in the (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 film.

We evaluated the pure 2D and 2D/3D mixed perovskite structures based on their photovoltaic performance by fabricating a device consisting of a FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au solar cell configuration, and its photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 6. First, we reveal that we created solar cells in air. Generally, because perovskites are very sensitive to humidity and oxygen in air, perovskite solar cells are created in an inert atmosphere, making them ultimately unsuitable for commercialization. Fig. 16a plots the photovoltaic performance of the pure 2D perovskites under a simulated AM (air mass) 1.5G (global) illumination (100 mW cm−2). The device composed of the 2D perovskites exhibited an extremely poor efficiency, which was almost less than 1%, due to a high exciton binding energy and larger band gap. However, for the perovskite solar cell made of the 2D/3D hybrid system (Fig. 16b), the performance of the device was significantly improved due to the enhanced Jsc and Voc.

 Fig. 16  Photovoltaic performance (J–V curve obtained from the forward scan) of the perovskite solar cell made with (a) pure 2D and (b) mixed perovskites under simulated AM (air mass) 1.5G (global) illumination (100 mW cm−2). IPCE spectra together with integrated Jsc for the (c) 2D and (d) mixed perovskite-based devices. 
Due to the coexisting 3D perovskite structure, it changed the crystal orientation in the vertical direction to facilitate the charge transport and to decrease the band gap, making it an efficient light absorber in the solar cell. A maximum efficiency of 5.80% was achieved for the device made with the (GA)(MA)PbI4 perovskite. According to a previous report,12 the higher symmetry of the (GA)(MA)PbI4 perovskite has a narrower band gap with respect to its common 2D RP perovskites, which resulted in light absorption in the long wavelength range to improve the light harvesting capability. The (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite also has a significantly decreased band gap compared to the (BZA)2PbI4 perovskite. It exhibited a PCE of 5.46% with a corresponding short circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of 11.59 mA cm−2, 0.75 V and 62.70%, respectively. However, the (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite still showed a very low efficiency. This result suggests that the properties of the 2D/3D mixed perovskite were more influenced by the 2D cations than by the 3D cations. The IPCE spectra are plotted in Fig. 16c and d for the 2D and mixed perovskites, respectively. As shown in Fig. 16c, all the 2D perovskites exhibit a sharp peak at the band-edge, which is consistent with the absorption result (Fig. 3a). The integrated photocurrent densities calculated from the IPCE graph are 0.71 mA cm−2, 1.09 mA cm−2, 0.48 mA cm−2, 0.66 mA cm−2, 0.10 mA cm−2, and 0.87 mA cm−2 for the (BA)2PbI4, (BZA)2PbI4, EAPbI3, (GA)2PbI4, (IM)2Pb2I7 and (PEA)2PbI4 perovskite-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values measured from the Jsc–Voc characteristics. As shown in Fig. 16(d), the IPCE spectra of the mixed perovskites exhibit a broad region range from 400 to 700 nm, showing higher EQEs than those of the corresponding 2D perovskites. The measured external quantum efficiency and corresponding integrated Jsc of the devices of mixed perovskites were displayed. The integrated Jsc from the EQE spectrum is 11.75 mA cm−2, 11.75 mA cm−2, 8.88 mA cm−2, 12.94 mA cm−2, 2.12 mA cm−2 and 5.16 mA cm−2 for (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (EA)2(MA)Pb2I7, (GA)(MA)PbI4, (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites, respectively. The measured Jsc is well consistent with the integrated Jsc from the IPCE results.
Compared to the 3D perovskite, MAPbI3, we chose the best quasi-2D cells, (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (GA)(MA)PbI4, to study the stability under ambient atmospheric conditions with a relative humidity of 30–50%. The results are presented in Fig. 17. It clearly shows that quasi-2D perovskite cells demonstrate excellent long-term stability with less than 22% and 38% PCE loss for (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (GA)(MA)PbI4 perovskite cells, respectively, over 20 days in air. In contrast to the quasi-2D perovskite, the 3D perovskite, MAPbI3, shows a sharp decrease over 31% and 45% for PCE and Jsc loss, respectively, even after only 10 days in air, which is associated with the decomposition of the perovskite layer by exposure to moisture. This large stability difference indicates that the films composed of hydrophobic and bulky cations play an important role in long-term stability toward environmental factors.

4. Conclusions
The present work explored 2D/3D hybrid perovskites by incorporating 2D perovskites into the 3D perovskite structure. In normalized PL spectra, remarkable PL emissions in (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (GA)(MA)PbI4 perovskites were observed compared to their 2D perovskites. Among the 2D perovskites, the (BZA)2PbI4 and (PEA)2PbI4 perovskites showed the longest τ2 and τ3, which indicates that the electron–phonon coupling process dominantly occurred in their structure due to the trap state. Except for (PEA)2(MA)Pb2I7, the n and k of the mixed perovskites are found to significantly increase compared with those of the 2D perovskites. It can be attributed to the larger oscillator strength of excitons in the mixed perovskites than that in the 2D perovskites. In particular, the n and k of the (GA)(MA)PbI4 and (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites were quite different from those of the pure 2D perovskites. This result suggests that the mixed structure generated by the two organic cations had a significant influence on the variation of the optical properties. The (GA)(MA)PbI4 and (BZA)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskites showed a remarkable PCE due to their higher crystal symmetry and different stacking motif structure. However, the (IM)2(MA)Pb2I7 perovskite showed a poor efficiency despite the addition of the 3D perovskite. This indicates that the properties of the mixed perovskites were predominantly controlled by the 2D perovskite rather than by the 3D perovskite in the hybrid system.
