    , Accepted 14th March 2023First published on 14th March 2023AbstractWe report, for the first time, sub-4 nm mapping of donor:acceptor nanoparticle composition in eco-friendly colloidal dispersions for organic electronics. Low energy scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping has revealed the internal morphology of organic semiconductor donor:acceptor blend nanoparticles at the sub-4 nm level. A unique element was available for utilisation as a fingerprint element to differentiate donor from acceptor material in each blend system. Si was used to map the location of donor polymer PTzBI-Si in PTzBI-Si:N2200 nanoparticles, and S (in addition to N) was used to map donor polymer TQ1 in TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles. For select material blends, synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), was demonstrated to remain as the superior chemical contrast technique for mapping organic donor:acceptor morphology, including for material combinations lacking a unique fingerprint element (e.g. PTQ10:Y6), or systems where the unique element is in a terminal functional group (unsaturated, dangling bonds) and can hence be easily damaged under the electron beam, e.g. F on PTQ10 donor polymer in the PTQ10:IDIC donor:acceptor blend. We provide both qualitative and quantitative compositional mapping of organic semiconductor nanoparticles with STEM EDX, with sub-domains resolved in nanoparticles as small as 30 nm in diameter. The sub-4 nm mapping technology reported here shows great promise for the optimisation of organic semiconductor blends for applications in organic electronics (solar cells and bioelectronics) and photocatalysis, and has further applications in organic core–shell nanomedicines.
Introduction
While in silicon photovoltaics, light generates Mott–Wannier excitons which are dissociated at room temperature, in organic semiconductor materials Frenkel excitons are formed instead due to their low dielectric constants. Hence, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices require active layers made of molecular heterojunctions to split the excitons into free charges.1,2 These molecular heterojunctions are comprised of a binary blend of electron donor and electron acceptor material, where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) offsets are sufficient for exciton dissociation. Optimising the morphology of organic photovoltaic active layers comprising a donor–acceptor material blend has formed a significant focus area in this research field.3 Particularly since the average diffusion length of an exciton is 10 nm,4 and hence to reach efficient exciton dissociation rates, the active layer morphology must be engineered on the same length scale. Nanostructuring the donor–acceptor film morphology on the tens of nanometres length scale can be achieved by customising either solvent-cast bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films or water-coated nanoparticulate films.5–10 The current power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of BHJ OPV is 19%.11 Nanoparticulate-based OPV devices have improved significantly over recent years, with the current PCE record of 7.5%8 holding potential for further improvement as new advances are made in understanding film morphology. The available morphology categories of nanoparticles include core–shell, Janus, and molecularly intermixed for two-component blends,12 each with its own unique advantages for different applications. Interest in organic donor:acceptor semiconductor nanoparticles has also expanded to photocatalysis recently due to the work of Kosco et al.,13 who reported increased photocatalytic activity and hydrogen evolution for colloidal nanoparticle systems. In this alternate application, the nanoparticles can be used in water-based colloidal form, meaning the additional fabrication step of coating the nanoparticles to form a thin solid film is not necessary.14
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have overtaken fullerene acceptors in organic photovoltaics and photocatalysis,15–19 both BHJ and nanoparticulate, and the ability to map the morphology accurately is required for optimising structure–function relationships in device applications. In this report, we selected to study the new high performance donor–acceptor material systems PTzBI-Si:N2200 and PTQ10:IDIC, and the more well-known long-standing system TQ1:PC71BM, a fullerene containing system. PTzBI-Si is a donor polymer based on a pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)-dione (TzBI) unit which was later functionalised with a siloxane side chain, increasing the PCE of OPV devices to 11% when combined with the polymeric NFA N2200.20,21 All-polymer solar cell material pairs such as PTzBI-Si:N2200 are popular due to their high thermal, mechanical and photochemical stability and suitability to large area module production.20 Molecular NFA IDIC (and it's structural analogue ITIC) has shown promise as a low-bandgap n-type organic semiconductor in the past 5 years due to the advantages of easy tuning of electronic energy levels for its material sub-group, broad and strong light absorption, high electron mobility, and high morphological stability in comparison with fullerene derivative acceptors.22,23 When combined with the newly developed donor polymer PTQ10, the maximum reported OPV PCE was 13%.24 Wide bandgap polymer donor PTQ10 itself is a very promising organic semiconductor candidate for future energy applications due to its low-cost and simple synthesis via a two-step reaction, producing high yields (87%).23 Sun et al.23 reported the molecular design strategy of PTQ10 to be based on the donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymerisation concept, using a simple thiophene ring as donor unit in combination with a difluorine-substituted quinoxaline as acceptor unit.
It has long been a challenge to characterise donor–acceptor nanoparticle internal morphology due to the low contrast between organic semiconductors. Non-destructive techniques shown to provide contrast are STXM and cryo-TEM, but each have their own limitations. STXM is limited by its spatial resolution, and typically nanoparticles larger than 100 nm are analysed.25–29 Cryo-TEM has high spatial resolution, sufficient for mapping domains within organic nanoparticles, but lacks chemical sensitivity. It is only suitable where one material is crystalline, which affords the use of regular lattice spacing for indication of domains of each material, as was demonstrated for the PTB7-Th:eh-IDTBR system by Kosco et al.13 Energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) and STEM energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping of organic donor:acceptor nanoparticles30,31 and BHJ32 films has, on the other hand, been reported. However, reports were each limited to a single polymer:fullerene material system, and a high spatial resolution for mapping the internal compositional structure of nanoparticles was not achieved. Most importantly, the destructive nature of high-energy TEM mapping of organics was not considered.33 That includes acceleration voltages above 85 kV that is the C–C bond knock-on threshold, dose-rate dependent radiolysis damage and local electron beam heating up to 200 °C that is well above the glass-transition temperature (Tg) for the donor:acceptor nanoparticles.
In this work, we provide the first in-depth study of the STEM EDX mapping of organic semiconductor nanoparticle composition with sub-4 nm spatial resolution. We demonstrate non-destructive low-dose rate multi-frame averaged high S/N STEM EDX mapping at 60 kV. These are conditions required to probe the length scales corresponding to the average exciton diffusion length in organic semiconductors, and without need of complex deconvolution methods used for ensemble averaged optical spectroscopy data. Three polymeric donors (PTzBI-Si, TQ1 and PTQ10) were combined with three categories of acceptor materials, a polymeric NFA (N2200), a fullerene acceptor (PC71BM) and a molecular NFA (IDIC) in the synthesis of binary blend nanoparticles using the miniemulsion route. The internal composition of the nanoparticles was also elucidated by synchrotron-based STXM – to provide a comparative technique that is widely accepted for studying organic semiconductor donor–acceptor material systems. We were able to demonstrate for the first time that the internal nanoscale structure can be resolved for particles in the size range optimal for OPV applications, 30 nm diameter. We demonstrate that this work expands the nanocharacterisation toolkit available for the analysis of nanoengineered colloids for a range of disciplines, including organic electronics, photocatalysis and nanomedicine.

Poly[2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1) ((C40H46N2O2S)n) donor polymer (Mn 53100 Da, Đ 2.5) was synthesised by the copolymerisation of monomers 5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline and 2,5-bis-(trimethylstannanyl)thiophene, with the procedure described in detail elsewhere.27,34 Poly{[N,N0-bis(2-octyldodecyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,50-(2,20-bithiophene)} (N2200) ((C62H88N2O4S2)n) non-fullerene acceptor (also named PNDI-(2OD)2T) was purchased from 1-Material (Mn 55000 Da, Đ 2.5). 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((4,4,9,9-Tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene)) bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDIC) (C66H66N4O2S2) non-fullerene acceptor was purchased from Ossila.

Scale bars are 500 nm. 
Nanoparticle synthesis
The miniemulsion organic phase (oil phase) was prepared by dissolving 15 mg of donor material (PTzBI-Si, PTQ10 or TQ1) and 15 mg of acceptor material (N2200, IDIC or PC71BM) in 1.08 mL chloroform, forming a solution concentration of 27.8 mg mL−1. The miniemulsion aqueous phase was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg of SDS surfactant in 2.8 mL of Milli-Q filtered water to form a solution concentration of 0.18 mg mL−1 for the PTzBI-Si:N2200 and PTQ10:IDIC miniemulsions, and by dissolving 1 mg of SDS surfactant in 2.8 mL of Milli-Q filtered water to form a solution concentration of 0.36 mg mL−1 for the TQ1:PC71BM miniemulsion. The surfactant concentration was purposely low so as to achieve a broad distribution in nanoparticle sizes for X-ray and EM mapping experiments. For subsequent nanoparticle synthesis for application in organic electronic devices it is recommended to use a higher surfactant concentration in order to achieve smaller sized nanoparticles, and additional dialysis steps to remove excess surfactant once the nanoparticles are formed, as reported in our previous work.27 Macroemulsions were generated by combining the organic and aqueous phases and stirring at 1100 rpm, 33 °C for 1 h. A miniemulsion was generated using ultrasonication via a Hielscher UP400St ultrasonic processor with a 7 mm diameter tip. Sonication was at 30% amplitude, 27 W for 2 min, an ice bath was used to prevent overheating of the sample. Following sonication, the miniemulsion was transferred immediately to a hot plate for organic solvent evaporation at 60 °C with rapid stirring (1200 rpm). This evaporation was performed for a minimum of 3 h to ensure complete removal of organic solvent. The total volume of the nanoparticle colloidal dispersion was reduced to 0.5 mL via centrifugal dialysis with Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa cut-off membrane centrifugal tubes and a Heraeus Biofuge Primo centrifuge, yielding nanoparticle dispersions with a solids content of 6 wt%.
Scanning electron microscopy
Samples were prepared for SEM by spin coating 2.5 μL of the nanoparticle colloidal dispersions (3000 rpm, 1 min, low acceleration of 112 rpm per s) onto highly doped silicon substrates (type N (phosphorus), resistivity 3–9 Ω cm). The silicon substrates were UV-ozone cleaned for 10 min prior to spin coating. The nanoparticle films were sputter coated with 5 nm gold in a Safematic CCU-010 compact coating unit prior to SEM measurements. SEM was performed on both a Zeiss Sigma VP HD FESEM and a Zeiss Auriga FIB-SEM (operating in SEM mode only), with an accelerating voltage of 3 kV, using the In Lens secondary electron detector.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy
Low energy annular dark field (ADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was performed using a ThermoFisher (formerly FEI) double spherical aberration (Cs)-corrected Themis-Z 60-300, equipped with a high-brightness field emission (XFEG) gun operated at 60 kV. Chromatic aberrations were reduced by exciting a Wien-type monochromator to +0.6 V. Low dose imaging (<10 pA) was controlled by the monochromator defocus. Spherical aberrations were corrected using a CEOS DCOR+ corrector achieving a resolution of <1.0 Ångström. The convergence angle was set to 17.9 mrad and a collection range of 45–160 mrad was employed using a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. A Super-X energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector was used at a 0.2–20 keV energy range to acquire EDX maps and the Velox software was employed to perform EDX quantification with Brown-Powell ionisation cross-section models and using built-in routines for multiple frame noise reduction. Low dose-rate multiple scan raster imaging was carried out at 0.1 e− Å−2 (0.5 pA current, pixel size 8.9 Å) using 2 μs dwell time. The total counts of all EDX maps was between 106 and 107.
TEM samples were prepared by vertical immersion of lacey carbon on Cu mesh support grids in the colloidal suspension followed by drying excessive suspension on grade 292 filter paper. The samples were subsequently dried at 10−5 mbar pressure at room temperature for 10 min prior to insertion in the TEM.
Correlative transmission electron microscopy
Correlative TEM was used post-STXM to reimage the same nanoparticles for collecting position-matched micrographs. The Si3N4 membrane substrates with deposited nanoparticles were transported back to the University of Sydney (Australia) to measure TEM on a JEOL JEM-1400 at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV, using a Norcada custom TEM holder for Si3N4 membrane substrates (NTS-J-NX5-001).
Synchrotron NEXAFS spectroscopy
NEXAFS at the C K-edge was utilised for the measurement of organic semiconductors in this study. Measurements of PTzBI-Si, PTQ10 and TQ1 donor polymers and N2200, IDIC and PC71BM non-fullerene and fullerene acceptors were performed at two synchrotron beamlines, the PolLux beamline (X07DA) at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) (Villigen, Switzerland) and the polymer STXM 5.3.2.2 beamline of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) (Berkeley, USA). Pristine films of each organic semiconductor material were prepared by spin coating chloroform or chlorobenzene solutions of each material onto PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083 purchased from Ossila) coated glass substrates. 2 × 2 mm2 sections were scored on the films using a scalpel, followed by floating off the film sections onto a D.I. water surface, which was made possible by dissolving the PEDOT:PSS sacrificial layer under the semiconductor material films (for floating off method refer to He et al.36). 2 × 2 mm2 film sections were subsequently collected onto 300 mesh Cu grids (20 mm bar, 63 mm hole, 3 mm diameter, purchased from ProSciTech Pty Ltd) for NEXAFS measurements. NEXAFS linescans were performed for each pristine material film, and the energy of the X-ray beam was varied between 278 and 390 eV, spanning the C K-edge region. Second- and third-order light was removed, at the SLS, by an order sorting aperture and higher order suppressor (further details are provided in Frommherz et al.37), and at the ALS by an order sorting aperture and an N2 gas filter (further details are provided in Kilcoyne et al.38). Orthogonal energies for later STXM mapping were selected by overlaying NEXAFS spectra of each donor:acceptor material combination, PTzBI-Si:N2200, PTQ10:IDIC and TQ1:PC71BM.
Synchrotron X-ray spectromicroscopy
X-ray spectromicroscopy (scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, STXM) measurements were performed at two synchrotron beamlines, the PolLux39,40 beamline (X07DA) at the Swiss Light Source and the polymer STXM 5.3.2.2 beamline of the Advanced Light Source. Samples were prepared for STXM measurements by spin coating 2.5 μL of nanoparticle dispersions onto low stress silicon nitride (Si3N4) membrane windows (window dimensions 1 × 1 mm2, window thickness 30 nm, silicon frame dimensions 5 × 5 mm2, purchased from Silson, UK) at 3000 rpm, 1 min, low acceleration. Samples were air dried at room temperature. The samples on Si3N4 windows were loaded in the STXM sample chamber and rastered with respect to the X-ray beam. The transmitted X-ray beam is detected by a scintillator and a photomultiplier tube. The STXM Fresnel zone plate (Ni at SLS, Au at ALS) had an outer most zone width of 25 nm, setting the spatial resolution limit of the measurement. The transmitted X-ray beam is detected by a scintillator and a photomultiplier tube.38 Singular value decomposition (SVD) was used to fit a sum of the pristine material NEXAFS spectra to the measured blend spectrum of the nanoparticles, at each pixel, in the STXM images. Prior to SVD fitting, the pristine material NEXAFS spectra were normalised to film thickness. The method of reference-spectrum normalisation constitutes dividing the real spectrum by a theoretical spectrum calculated based on the material's chemical formula using henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/filter.html. The aXis2000 package (unicorn.mcmaster.ca/aXis2000.html) was used to perform image analysis of STXM maps. Further details of STXM experimental methods and data analysis methods can be found in the literature.41
UV-visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy
UV-visible spectra were recorded using a SAFAS UV mc2 spectrophotometer in double beam mode. Spectra were recorded from 200 to 1000 nm in steps of 2 nm and using an integration time of 1 s. Quartz cuvettes with 1 cm optical path were used. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a PTI (Photon Technology International) Quantmaster 40 setup with a xenon arc lamp coupled with two monochromators: one for excitation and one for the emission. The detection system is based on a photomultiplier (model 810/814). The excitation wavelength (λexc) was set at 566 nm for PTzBI-Si:N2200 and PTQ10:IDIC, and 600 nm for TQ1:PC71BM. The emission spectra was recorded with 1 nm step and using an integration time of 1 s, from 600 to 900 nm for PTzBI-Si:N2200 and PTQ10:IDIC, and from 650 to 875 nm for TQ1:PC71BM. The excitation and emission slits were all set at 1.5 mm corresponding to a spectral resolution of 6 nm. 4-Sided quartz cuvettes with 1 cm optical path were used for these PL experiments. The different dispersions were diluted with water to reach an optical density of 0.25 at the excitation wavelength.
Results and discussion
Nanomaterials synthesis
Two component nanoparticles were synthesised via the miniemulsion method42 for the donor–acceptor material systems PTzBI-Si:N2200, TQ1:PC71BM and PTQ10:IDIC. A 1:1 w/w ratio was applied to all systems, with a summary of the material properties of the organic semiconductors provided in Table 1 and the nanoparticle synthesis parameters in Table 2. The internal morphology of PTzBI-Si:N2200 and PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticles has not previously been reported, whereas for TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles we have previously reported the internal morphology of 1:3 w/w ratio donor:acceptor nanoparticles to be core–shell, with a TQ1-rich shell and PC71BM-rich core.27 The particle size and size distribution for each nanoparticle sample is provided in Fig. 1e–g and tabulated in Table 2, with the mean value used as an indicator of nanoparticle size and the standard deviation (σ) used as an indicator of the size distribution. The nanoparticle size was measured by applying a circular Hough transform algorithm to SEM images of nanoparticle films (Fig. 1b–d) in MATLAB, with further method details provided elsewhere.27 This method gave diameters of 113 ± 42 nm for the PTzBI-Si:N2200 nanoparticles; 144 ± 56 nm for the TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles and 120 ± 53 nm for the PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticles. Further particle size analysis was performed on high magnification STEM images to account for nanoparticles of diameter <50 nm which are traditionally not captured in large area SEM survey scan analysis. These additional size distribution plots are provided in ESI Fig. S7.†

Sub-4 nm mapping of nanoparticle structure – unique element mapping
The three donor–acceptor material systems each possess a unique element that was able to be utilised as a fingerprint element to differentiate donor from acceptor material when mapping the internal nanoparticle morphology. Si is present in donor polymer PTzBI-Si and absent from NFA N2200, hence useful for the PTzBI-Si:N2200 system; S (in addition to N) is unique to donor polymer TQ1 and absent from PC71BM in the TQ1:PC71BM system; and F is unique to PTQ10 donor polymer and absent from IDIC in the PTQ10:IDIC system.
Low energy STEM EDX mapping is a powerful technique to elucidate composition of organic core–shell nanoparticles. At 60 kV operation voltage, the knock-on damage threshold is well below the C–C bond energy, leaving radiolysis and electron beam induced heating the main damage mechanisms.43 By further controlling the dose-rate of a multiple scan raster image the radiolysis and beam-heating can be significantly reduced while keeping a high S/N.44 Dose-rate limits were previously reported for P3HT and PC61BM, for example.45 0.1 e− Å−2 was reported for PC61BM. For that reason, the total electron dose per pixel for each scan was set to 0.1 e− Å−2 for the high-resolution STEM EDX maps (0.5 pA current, 2 μs dwell time, pixel size 8.9 Å). The increased ionisation scattering cross-section at 60 kV further increases the EDX signal yield at 60 kV (as compared to at 200 or 300 kV), rendering STEM EDX a viable option for organic material as long as a low-dose rate raster imaging is maintained.46 STEM EDX typically has a lower resolution compared to STEM imaging. This is largely an effect of delocalisation stemming from the convolution of the probe with the larger ionisation cross-section (Brown-Powel) of atomic orbitals that accounts for EDX contrast, compared to the Rutherford and thermal diffuse scattering cross-section that describes electron-nuclei scattering in STEM contrast. The delocalisation of STEM EDX can be estimated by measuring the width of the rising slope at atomically sharp compositional interfaces in STEM EDX maps. The spatial resolution of the STEM together with STEM EDX maps (see ESI Fig. S6†), yields sub-nanometre mapping precision, which is highly suitable for mapping the composition of organic semiconductor nanoparticle morphology and a substantial improvement on the spatial resolution of comparative techniques such as synchrotron-based STXM.

Fig. 2 shows STEM EDX maps of PTzBI-Si:N2200 1:1 donor:acceptor blend nanoparticles. In (a) the ADF image demonstrates an asymmetric distribution of mass and particles exhibit an elliptical appearance. Fig. 2(b–f) show the elemental maps of (b) S–K (teal-blue), (c) O–K (yellow), (d) C–K (green), (e) Si–K (purple) and (f) overlay of C (green) and Si (purple), respectively. Additional nanoparticles of PTzBI-Si:N2200 were mapped (at the same K-edge energies) and the elemental maps are provided in ESI Fig. S1.† The EDX spectrum is provided in Fig. S5a,† the peaks assigned comprised S–K at 2.31 keV, O–K at 0.52 keV, C–K at 0.27 keV, and Si–K at 1.74 keV. Si located in a siloxane functional group is unique to PTzBI-Si donor polymer (Fig. 1a) and occupies the off-centred core of these Janus nanoparticles, as evidenced by the location of Si at the nanoparticle centre in Fig. 2e, and the C + Si map overlay in Fig. 2f. It is furthermore observed that the off-centred core has a higher concentration of S compared to the shell, as expected considering in PTzBI-Si the ratio of S to C (1:12) is three times higher than that of S to C (1:31) in N2200. The Janus morphology for the PTzBI-Si:N2200 nanoparticle system measured via STEM EDX is supported by synchrotron-based STXM mapping (Fig. 5a–d), where the same morphology is observed. Compositional analysis of the STEM EDX maps shows a 72 (±7)% N2200 composition in the nanoparticle shell and a 94 (±2)% PTzBI-Si composition in the nanoparticle off-centred core.

A core–shell morphology is the most commonly reported morphology category for nanoparticles synthesised via the miniemulsion method. The core–shell structure formation via self-assembly based on the surface energy differential of donor and acceptor material is a phenomenon reported in our previous work for a range of donor–acceptor material systems.29 During nanoparticle formation, to lower the energy of the free surface the lower surface energy material of the two materials is driven to the nanoparticle shell, and the higher surface energy material is driven to the nanoparticle core. PTzBI-Si is a new organic semiconductor with a surface energy yet to be reported. Our previous studies of donor:acceptor nanoparticles incorporating the low surface energy NFA N2200 (23.7 mJ m−2),47 namely P3HT:N2200 and TQ1:N2200,29 have similarly demonstrated an off-centred polymer core and N2200-rich shell nanoparticle morphology, approaching Janus.
STEM EDX maps of the 1:1 TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 3. In contrast to PTzBI-Si:N2200, TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles are spherically shaped and a core–shell structure is clearly visible by mass contrast, as evidenced in the high resolution ADF image in ESI Fig. S3.† The EDX maps in (b–f), showing (b) N–K (teal-blue), (c) O–K (yellow), (d) C–K (green), (e) S–K (purple) and (f) overlay of C (green) and S (purple), respectively. Additional nanoparticles of TQ1:PC71BM were mapped (at the same K-edge energies) and the elemental maps are provided in ESI Fig. S2.† The EDX spectrum is provided in Fig. S5b,† the peaks assigned comprised N–K at 0.39 keV, O–K at 0.52 keV, C–K at 0.27 keV, and S–K at 2.32 keV. N in the quinoxaline unit and S in the thiophene unit are unique to the TQ1 donor polymer (Fig. 1a) which occupies the shell of the core–shell nanoparticles, as clearly observed by the location of S in Fig. 3e, N in Fig. 3b, and the C + S map overlay in Fig. 3f. Compositional analysis of the STEM EDX maps of TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles shows a 71 (±14)% TQ1 composition in the nanoparticle shell and an 81 (±3)% PC71BM composition in the nanoparticle core.

In Fig. 4, a 1:1 PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticle blend is presented. Fig. 4a shows the ADF image that indicates an elliptical shape of the particles. The ADF mass contrast imaging mode further suggests a uniform distribution of elements as opposed to a core–shell structure. Fig. 4(b–f) show STEM EDX maps of (b) S–K (blue), (c) O–K (yellow), (d) C–K (green), (e) F–K (purple) and (f) overlay of C (green) and F (purple), respectively. In particular, F–K maps show a uniform distribution within the particle. This result is in contradiction with STXM mapping which shows that the PTQ10 donor polymer occupies the shell of the core–shell nanoparticles (Fig. 5(i–l)). It is possible that the unsaturated F-terminations on the quinoxaline units in PTQ10 (Fig. 1a) diffuse into the nanoparticles because of electron beam interaction causing atom displacement, rendering F-mapping inaccurate. The C–F bond in PTQ10 is 1.41 Å, corresponding to a bond dissociation energy of 3.5 eV.48 That is on the same order as the electron-nuclei energy transfer at 60 kV for a low atomic mass element such as F,49 and arguably the reason for the lack of a higher measured concentration of F in the shell. Additional nanoparticles of PTQ10:IDIC were mapped (at the same K-edge energies) and the elemental maps are provided in ESI Fig. S4.† The EDX spectrum is provided in Fig. S5c,† the peaks assigned comprised S–K at 2.31 keV, O–K at 0.53 keV, C–K at 0.27 keV, and F–K at 0.68 keV.

For the mass plots (c, d, g, h, k and l) the colour scale bars indicate concentration of component in mg cm−2. 
PTQ10:IDIC is not the only material system where deferring to synchrotron-based STXM mapping is still beneficial. Donor:acceptor material systems that do not possess a unique fingerprint element for mapping will also need to rely on long-standing techniques such as STXM for mapping composition. Such systems include PTQ10:Y6 (with a record PCE of 16%),24 where the chemical structure of narrow bandgap NFA Y6 (C82H86F4N8O2S5) contains the same elements as the wide bandgap polymer donor PTQ10 ((C28H36F2N2OS)n), hence providing no unique elements for STEM EDX mapping capacity.
Synchrotron X-ray mapping of nanostructure
Unlike STEM EDX, synchrotron-based STXM is not based on unique elemental analysis, it is based on relative absorption in the soft X-ray energy range. NEXAFS provides a fingerprint spectrum that is unique to each component of a blend system by probing the element-specific excitations of core electrons to unoccupied molecular orbitals.50 NEXAFS and STXM measurements were performed using beamline 5.3.2.2 at the ALS synchrotron and the PolLux beamline (X07DA) at the SLS synchrotron to ascertain the internal nanostructure of the donor–acceptor nanoparticles. The resolution limit of STXM is typically 30 nm, set by the outermost zone width of the Fresnel zone plate utilised for focusing the incoming X-ray beam. This spatial resolution limit for STXM is an order of magnitude larger than that of STEM EDX, highlighting the benefit of STEM EDX, where applicable. For further information on STEM EDX compared to STXM as a nanoscale mapping technique with chemical contrast, we refer the reader to Table S1 (ESI†).
Fig. S8† presents the NEXAFS spectra of PTzBI-Si, TQ1 and PTQ10 donor polymers and N2200, PC71BM and IDIC non-fullerene and fullerene acceptors. STXM was utilised to collect X-ray maps of nanoparticle films at multiple photon energies of the incident beam, representing orthogonal energies selected from overlaying pristine film NEXAFS spectra. Singular value decomposition (SVD) was employed to determine the relative ratio of donor and acceptor component (at each pixel) in the composite nanoparticles. STXM composition maps are presented in Fig. 5 for PTzBI-Si:N2200 (a–d), TQ1:PC71BM (e–h) and PTQ10:IDIC (i–l) nanoparticles. Additional nanoparticles of PTzBI-Si:N2200, TQ1:PC71BM and PTQ10:IDIC were analysed and the STXM maps are provided in ESI Fig. S9, S10 and S11,† respectively. A Janus morphology is observed for the PTzBI-Si:N2200 systems and a core–shell structure for the TQ1:PC71BM and PTQ10:IDIC systems, with varying composition of individual domains depending on the donor–acceptor material combination. For the PTzBI-Si:N2200 nanoparticle system characterised via STXM, a PTzBI-Si-rich off-centred core and N2200-rich shell was measured, as depicted in Fig. 5(a–d). For the TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles, the structure inverted to donor-rich shell (a TQ1-rich shell) and an acceptor-rich core (a PC71BM-rich core), as depicted in Fig. 5(e–h). A TQ1-rich shell is evident by the bright rings observed in the TQ1 STXM fractional composition map for the 1:1 nanoparticles (Fig. 5e). Thirdly, for the PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticle system, a PTQ10-rich shell and IDIC-rich core was measured via STXM mapping (Fig. 5(i–l)), although the domain purity of the shell is lower indicating that this domain potentially tends towards a molecularly mixed state. We know from our previous work that the core–shell morphology forms via self-assembly of materials in accordance with their relative surface energies.29 The donor and acceptor materials self-arrange in the miniemulsion droplets (swollen micelles) to minimise surface energy, while the oil-phase solvent (e.g. chloroform or o-xylene51) is being removed via thermal evaporation.
Relevance of sub-4 nm length scales
With STEM-EDX mapping we were able to resolve the composition of core–shell nanoparticles as small as 30 nm in diameter (Fig. 6). With 25–30 nm being the average size of nanoparticles used in nanoparticle OPV applications,25,27,51,52 we highlight that this higher spatial resolution technique has benefits for the OPV research field. In Fig. 6 we present STEM EDX maps of a range of nanoparticle sizes for the TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticle system (30 to 350 nm diameter), showing the smallest nanoparticles that can have their internal morphology reliably mapped.

STXM has previously been used to measure the internal morphology of organic semiconductor nanoparticles of diameter 100–400 nm, a larger size than that used in nanoparticle OPV applications. The reason for this disparity in nanoparticle size measured with STXM and nanoparticle size applied to OPV device fabrication was the inability to resolve the internal structure of nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm, due to the resolution limit of the STXM technique. Hence STXM studies usually measured the morphology over a range of sizes (100–400 nm) and extrapolated to smaller sizes, claiming that the morphology of 25–30 nm nanoparticles would be consistent. Herein, we can now report that this assumption is correct; the morphology of smaller device-appropriate nanoparticles is indeed consistent, with the same core–shell morphology observed for nanoparticles over the full size range in this study, 30–350 nm (Fig. 6).
Quantitative analysis of donor–acceptor nanoparticles
The composition of nanoparticles was quantified on the single-particle level with STEM EDX for the PTzBI-Si:N2200 and TQ1:PC71BM material systems and with synchrotron-based STXM for the PTQ10:IDIC material system. Considering the PTzBI-Si:N2200 nanoparticles possessed a Janus structure, line profiles as opposed to radial profiles were used to measure the composition of domains. Table 3 shows the average composition data acquired from 9, 7 and 10 nanoparticles of the PTzBI-Si:N2200, TQ1:PC71BM and PTQ10:IDIC systems, respectively. The differing sample size for STEM EDX data stems from exclusion of particles overlapping with the C background from the TEM grid and from adjacent particles. The core and shell compositions for PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticles in Table 3 were calculated (in MATLAB) from radial profiles of nanoparticles using the core–shell model reported by Holmes et al.26 On average, the PTzBI-SI:N2200 nanoparticles are comprised of a 72 (±7)% N2200 shell and a 94 (±2)% off-centred PTzBI-Si core; the TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles are comprised of a 71 (±14)% TQ1 shell and an 81 (±3)% PC71BM core; and the PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticles are comprised of a 62 (±9)% PTQ10 shell and a 76 (±4)% IDIC core. A characteristic line profile of a PTzBI-Si:N2200 nanoparticle in two size bins is presented in Fig. 7a, d, and an average profile in Fig. 7g. Radial profiles were generated for TQ1:PC71BM and PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticles, which were more symmetrical and uniform in nature. A characteristic radial profile of a TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticle in two size bins is presented in Fig. 7b, e, and a PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticle in two size bins is presented in Fig. 7c and f. An average radial profile for these two systems is presented in Fig. 7h and i. We observed a small broadening of the donor–acceptor domain interface as nanoparticle size decreased, for all nanoparticle types. The relationship between nanoparticle shell thickness and particle diameter is plotted in ESI Fig. S12.† The results show that as nanoparticle diameter increases, shell thickness increases for both PTzBI-Si:N2200 and TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles, whereas for PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticles the shell thickness on average remains the same.

Connection of structure to function
Photoluminescence experiments were performed to investigate the fluorescence quenching in the different composite donor–acceptor nanoparticles since it is a first indication of potential exciton dissociation and charge transfer from donor to acceptor.53 Photoluminescence of pure donor nanoparticles (PTzBI-Si, TQ1 and PTQ10) were measured and compared to that of donor–acceptor composite nanoparticles (PTzBI-Si:N2200, TQ1:PC71BM and PTQ10:IDIC).
Firstly, for the PTzBI-Si:N2200 material system, the photoluminescence intensity of the donor material, PTzBI-Si, is high and only 32% is quenched by the N2200 acceptor in donor:acceptor nanoparticles (Fig. 8a). This result indicates phase separation within the composite nanoparticles, with domains larger than the exciton diffusion length. This Janus morphology is visible in the STEM EDX images (Fig. 2) which show off-centred cores composed mainly of PTzBI-Si. The photoluminescence result suggests that these domains are composed of almost pure PTzBI-Si, in agreement with the value calculated in Table 3.
 Fig. 8  Steady-state photoluminescence spectra of (a) PTzBI-Si and PTzBI-Si:N2200 nanoparticles, (b) TQ1 and TQ1:PC71BM nanoparticles, and (c) PTQ10 and PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticles. 
In contrast, the TQ1:PC71BM composite nanoparticles present very low photoluminescence intensity compared to that of pure TQ1 nanoparticles (Fig. 8b). Up to 97% of the TQ1 photoluminescence is quenched by the PC71BM, indicating efficient electron transfer from the donor (TQ1) to the acceptor (PC71BM) and spatial proximity between the two materials (within the exciton diffusion length).54 Even though STEM EDX (Fig. 3) and STXM images (Fig. 5e–h) show a core–shell preferential morphology, with the acceptor material mainly in the core and the donor material mainly in the shell, photoluminescence experiments indicate that the shell is not purely composed of TQ1, but comprises also PC71BM since almost all TQ1 PL is quenched.
Concerning the PTQ10:IDIC composite nanoparticles, the photoluminescence intensity is also very weak with respect of the pure PTQ10 nanoparticles. The IDIC acceptor quenches up to 96% of PTQ10 photoluminescence (Fig. 8c), which indicates also that the electron transfer is highly efficient in such composite donor:acceptor nanoparticles. This result indicates a proximity between the donor and the acceptor, within the exciton diffusion length (8–15 nm). STXM analysis shows a core–shell morphology (Fig. 5i–l), with the acceptor material preferentially in the core, while STEM-EDX could not be relied upon due to suspected electron beam damage to the terminal F group (the element belonging to PTQ10 used as the fingerprint element), the result being STEM EDX maps indicating an intermixed morphology (Fig. 4). The photoluminescence results shed further light on the true morphology of the nanoparticles. Indeed, since the acceptor material IDIC must be spatially close to PTQ10 to extinct its fluorescence, the PTQ10 shell is likely to comprise IDIC molecules evenly spread to allow efficient charge transfer. Hence, the PTQ10:IDIC nanoparticle morphology comprises an intermixed PTQ10:IDIC shell and a core predominantly of IDIC.
The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is strongly dependent on the internal morphology of the composite nanoparticles as well as their sizes.55 High efficiency OPV devices have been achieved with nanoparticles presenting intermixed morphology, generally obtained from the nanoprecipitation method, but also the miniemulsion method in several cases.8,13,56,57 One can highlight the 7.5% PCE achieved for the PBQ-QF:ITIC system8 from water-based dispersions and 4.3% for P3HT:ICBA58 from alcohol-based dispersions. It has been shown in several studies by the Venkataraman group59,60 that, if the surfactant is efficiently removed, the charge transport in OPV devices is not drastically affected and it is comparable to thin films deposited from organic solvents. The core–shell morphology of TQ1:PC71BM, while presenting high photoluminescence quenching, and, as a consequence, high exciton dissociation rate, is not suitable for OPV devices if the core and shell domains are pure, which would cause electrons to be trapped in the core of the nanoparticles. Since the core and shell domains are PC71BM-rich and TQ1-rich, respectively, charge percolation pathways exist for the transport of electrons and holes to their respective electrodes. It is also of note that upon thermal annealing, nano-bridges can be formed between the cores of the nanoparticles, improving therefore the device performance, as shown in our previous work.27 Although, there remains a discrepancy between the performance of OPV devices fabricated from organic solvent (BHJ) and that of devices fabricated from nanoparticle dispersions, PCE 6%34 and 2.5%27 respectively (Table 4). Future work should target a nanoparticle shell with a 50:50 blend of donor:acceptor, to improve charge transport and further close the gap between BHJ-OPV and NP-OPV performance. The morphology identified for PTzBI-Si:N2200 is Janus with an off-centred core of donor polymer, and with much larger phase separation than the other two systems studied. This type of nanoparticle morphology has potential to perform well in OPV devices, but only if an essential modification is performed reducing the nanoparticle size to <30 nm,55 such that excitons have a shorter transport distance to reach an interface of donor and acceptor for efficient exciton quenching, which was not the case for the large nanoparticles studied in this report. While OPV devices fabricated from PTzBI-Si:N2200 in organic solvent can reach up to 11.8%,21 we can aim at a NP-OPV device performance of 5.9%, 50% of that value, in alignment with the current trend for NP-OPV reaching 50% of the performance of BHJ-OPV for other material systems. The morphology identified for PTQ10:IDIC seems more adapted to OPV devices than the two others. On the one hand, high exciton dissociation rate is observed from photoluminescence experiments, indicating intermixing between the donor and the acceptor in the nanoparticle shell domain. This type of morphology is promising for OPV devices prepared from nanoparticle dispersions since this donor:acceptor material system can reach up to 12.7%23 PCE when fabricated from organic solvent.

Future directions for ideal nanostructures
Customisable waterborne nanoparticulate colloidal dispersions are highly sought-after in multiple disciplines. For nanomedicines, the ideal structure for drug delivery is core–shell. For example, hybrid bio-nanoconstructs have a drug-loaded core, a biodegradable polymer shell and surface-functionalised peptides. In the emerging field of photocatalysis and hydrogen generation by organic nanoparticles, it has been shown that a molecularly intermixed nanostructure is more favourable than a core–shell nanostructure for improving the hydrogen production rate.13 In the field of organic photovoltaics, core–shell morphologies can produce reasonable efficiencies if the nanoparticle shell composition is a blend of donor and acceptor, to avoid charges being trapped in the core. The highest efficiencies for nanoparticulate based OPV devices are reported for molecularly intermixed structures, since this morphology ensures high exciton dissociation rates and percolation pathways for the charges. Nanoengineering strategies for producing Janus morphologies for applications in OPV have only recently been reported.30,61 It is theorised that the Janus nanoparticle morphology could become the ideal morphology for OPV (and for photocatalytic applications) because Janus nanoparticles of small diameters (<30 nm) could combine high exciton dissociation rate and perfect conduction pathways for both charges.12 Therefore, the OPV field needs strategies to carefully tune the nanomorphology of donor–acceptor nanoparticles and powerful techniques, such as STEM EDX, to confirm their morphologies which will define the device performance.
Conclusions
Here we report the sub-4 nm mapping of composition in organic semiconductor binary blend nanoparticles with STEM EDX. Although STEM EDX has been available for several years, sub-4 nm precision elemental mapping at low accelerating voltage (60 kV) has not previously been reported for donor–acceptor blends to determine the internal morphology of nanoparticles as small as 30 nm in diameter. We provide qualitative and quantitative mapping of two new high performance polymer donor:NFA material systems (PTzBI-Si:N2200 and PTQ10:IDIC), and one long-established polymer donor:fullerene acceptor system (TQ1:PC71BM). The ability to resolve the internal structure of nanoparticles as small as 30 nm in diameter – information that was previously inaccessible – is highly relevant to OPV device applications. This non-synchrotron-based mapping technique is compared to the synchrotron-based STXM technique, with an inferior spatial resolution limit (by an order of magnitude). The chemical identification and quantification of such materials with sub-4 nm resolution is a welcome addition to the nano-characterisation toolbox, and is available for making breakthroughs in organic electronics, photocatalysis and nanomedicine.
