    , Accepted 19th November 2004First published on 16th December 2004AbstractWe report on the photophysical, morphological and photoresponse properties of blends of a regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene)
				(P3HT) as the electron-donor and a quinquethiophene-S,S-dioxide (T5OHM) as the electron-acceptor. A scanning force microscopy study on 100 nm thick blended films revealed the occurrence of a notable phase segregation between the two components and a remarkable tendency of the acceptor molecule to form micrometre sized architectures characterized by sharp edges within the amorphous matrix of P3HT. X-Ray diffraction studies confirmed the high degree of crystallinity of T5OHM in the blended films. The interaction of the oligomer with the polymer resulted in an enhanced photoinduced charge separation, leading to a sixty-fold increase of the power conversion efficiency in the blended cells with respect to the pristine device based on neat P3HT.
Introduction
Unsubstituted oligothiophenes are p-type, hole-transporting materials. However the chemical transformation of one of the thienyl rings into the corresponding thienyl-S,S-dioxide1 leads to very stable oligomers with dramatically increased electron affinity.2 Higher electron affinities and enhanced photoluminescence in the solid state3 allow the fabrication of light emitting diodes characterized by much higher stability and brightness compared to conventional oligothiophenes.4
In a previous letter5 we described the properties of oligothiophene-S,S-dioxides as electron-acceptor materials for organic photovoltaics. Different classes of electron-acceptor (A) materials—polymers,6 dyes,7 fullerenes,8–10 and inorganic nanoparticles11—have already been tested as electron-acceptor components in blended D–A solar cells and power conversion efficiencies up to 3.5%10 have been reported in the literature. Further improvements in the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells require the exploration of new synthetic materials with appropriate physico-chemical properties and supramolecular architectures in thin films, in order to gain a better understanding of the electro-optical mechanisms occurring in the photoactive films. With this purpose, oligothiophene-S,S-dioxides were investigated as a novel class of electron-acceptor materials. We demonstrated photoinduced charge transfer in these materials via photoluminescence spectroscopy, together with an enhanced photoresponse of the blended cells with respect to that of reference devices in which P3HT was the active layer.5
In this paper we report the synthesis and a study of the photophysical properties of T5OHM (Scheme 1), as well as a detailed characterization of the morphology and of the photoresponse properties of blends of this compound with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene)
				(P3HT).

The regioregular P3HT was from Sigma-Aldrich.
The molecular structure and the synthetic pattern of T5OHM, namely 3″-methyl,4″-hexyl-2,2′:5′,2″:5″,2‴:5‴,2⁗-pentathiophene-1″,1″-dioxide, are shown in Scheme 1.
T5OMH was prepared by the Stille coupling between 2,5-dibromo,3-methyl,4-hexyl-thiophene-1,1-dioxide (see below) and 5-tributylstannyl-2,2′-bithiophene, using Pd[AsPH3]4 generated in situ, according to the route described in ref. 1.

					=
					−10 °C, was added dropwise 4.5 mL (0.009 mol) of a 2 M solution of hexyl-magnesium bromide. The mixture was allowed to reach RT and then was stirred overnight. Afterwards it was cooled and hydrolized with 10 mL of a saturated solution of NH4Cl (Warning: keep the mixture cool, the reaction is exothermic!). Then the organic layer was separated, washed with distilled water and dried over Na2SO4. The crude product was distilled at T
					= 106 °C (8 mm Hg) and 1.47 g (95% yield) of a light yellow oil was obtained. The product was identified as 3-hexyl,4-methyl-thiophene.

General
The spectroscopic investigations were carried out in dichloromethane (Carlo Erba, spectroscopic grade, 99.8%). Absorption, emission and luminescence lifetime measurements were obtained as described earlier.12 Luminescence data are corrected for the photomultiplier response. Optical absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer λ9 spectrophotometer.
Scanning force microscopy (SFM) operating in non-contact mode13 was exploited recording both the height image (output of the feedback signal) and the phase image (phase lag of the oscillation relative to the driver). Whereas the former offers a topographical map of the surface, the latter is extremely sensitive to different chemical composition on the sample surface, being therefore ideal to identify heterogeneities in a hybrid film. The SFM Autoprobe CP research (Thermomicroscope) was operating at room temperature under air with scan rates of 0.5–1.0 Hz line−1. Images with scan lengths ranging from 50 µm down to 1 µm have been recorded with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels employing the 100 µm scanner and non-contact Si ultra-levers with a spring constant in the range 2.1–17.0 N m−1. A 80 nm thick PEDOT film supported on ITO was used as support.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out with a Bragg–Brentano diffractometer system (Philips X'Pert PRO), equipped with a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam. A Cu anode was used as X-ray source. Data were collected in the range 3–80°
					(2θ) by step scanning, counting for 2 s (80 s for very slow data collections) at each 0.05° step. A parallel beam optic was used for thin film analysis. The glancing angle between the X-ray source and the sample surface was fixed at 0.8°. The films were prepared by spin-coating from chloroform solutions onto single crystal quartz plates.
Photocells were prepared by spin-coating (2000–3000 rpm) the polymer–oligothiophene blends, at different D–A weight ratio, from chloroform solution of 15 g L−1 concentration onto the top of PEDOT : PSS–indium-tin-oxide–glass electrodes (PEDOT : PSS = poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid) from Bayer AG, and coating these layers with an Al electrode by thermal evaporation. The film thickness, measured with a Tencor Alphastep 200 profilometer, was around 80–100 nm. The active area of the devices was 3.14 mm2. Device fabrication was performed, apart from the cathode deposition, at ambient conditions. The electrical characterization of the devices was performed with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit in a home-made measurement chamber under a pressure of 10−3 mbar. The junctions were illuminated through the ITO side with a 300 W Xe arc lamp. The intensity of the incident light, measured with an Oriel thermopile, was about 80 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
It has been demonstrated that in oligothiophene-S,S-dioxides the main relaxation mechanism from the excited state upon UV excitation is internal conversion14
				(IC, strongly dependent on the coupling with vibro-rotational quanta) rather than intersystem crossing as in conventional thiophene oligomers.15 Owing to the efficient non-radiative IC relaxation mechanism, these compounds display very poor photoluminescence intensities in solution,16 which increase by one or two orders of magnitude when as viscous solvent as decalin is employed17 or when the thienyl-S,S-dioxide group is inserted into a rigid dithienothiophene moiety.18
In the present study the photophysical properties of T5OHM and P3HT were investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopies at room temperature and at 77 K. The luminescence data in CH2Cl2 are collected in Table 1.

A wide absorption band (Fig. 1) in the visible spectral range (400–600 nm) is recorded for P3HT and T5OHM. The spectra reveal a good overlap between the absorption and excitation curves of T5OHM and P3HT, except for the weak absorption tail of the polymer on the low-energy side.

Emission spectra at room temperature are reported in Fig. 2. P3HT exhibits a strong fluorescence band (Φ
				= 0.22) with a lifetime of 660 ps. A biexponential decay is detected in a rigid matrix at 77 K, τ1
				= 510 and τ2
				= 1900 ps. Multiple lifetimes at low temperature are also found in organic aromatic oligomers, which are attributed to multiple conformations in the solid state.19 T5OHM is a much weaker fluorophore than P3HT in solution at room temperature (Φ
				= 0.0042) and also exhibits a shorter lifetime (220 ps).

Substantial recovery of fluorescence intensity is found for T5OHM at 77 K, relative to room temperature. Although quantitative comparisons between results obtained in solution at 298 K and data in 77 K rigid matrix cannot be made, the modifications of experimental conditions (e.g. spectrometer emission slits) allows us to roughly estimate an 80-fold emission increase at 77 K relative to room temperature. Notably, at 298 K the fluorescence intensity of T5OHM solutions increases by a factor of four by passing from CH2Cl2 to the less polar toluene. These results suggest that the lowest electronic excited state of T5OHM has a charge transfer character with the oligothiophene part acting as an electron donor and the thienyl S,S-dioxide moiety as an electron acceptor. These experimental findings are corroborated by semiempirical calculations that, for the LUMO orbital, indicate a much more pronounced electronic density on the thienyl S,S-dioxide ring if compared to the HOMO, where the density is more localized on the thienyl external units.20 In a low temperature rigid matrix the energy of this excited state is expected to increase as a consequence of the lack of solvent repolarization around the excited molecule. Under these conditions the lowest-lying emitting electronic state might be a nearly isoenergetic (Table 1) and more localized ππ* state, relatively unaffected by temperature or solvent polarity. The small, unconventional, red-shift of the 77 K band with respect to 298 K (Fig. 1) may support the view of two distinct close-lying excited states.
The absorption spectra of thin films of poly(3-alkylthiophenes)
				(PATs), in particular of regioregular P3HT, are known to depend strongly on the degree of aggregation. Red-shifted spectra are found for a stronger aggregation. Upon mixing with other components (e.g.
				[60]fullerene or its soluble derivatives), the aggregation of PATs can be hindered, leading to the disappearance of the typical vibronic spectral components and to a blue-shift of the absorption spectra. Blends between P3HT and T5OHM were prepared at different D–A weight ratio. The absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 3 together with those of the pristine donor and acceptor. Differently from the case of blends between PATs and [60]fullerene21 or its soluble derivatives,22 the blend absorption spectra were found to be a rough superposition of the pristine components. The apparent blue-shift of the absorption maximum, observed by decreasing the donor concentration, is due to the increased weight fraction of T5OHM. The presence of the typical vibronic band of P3HT (around 620 nm) even at the P3HT : T5OHM 1 : 3 weight ratio, could suggest the occurrence of a notable phase separation in the blends. This would be in line with the well-known tendency of substituted oligothiophenes23 and oligothiophene S,S-dioxides24 to self-assemble into ordered architectures.

In order to investigate the blend morphologies, scanning force microscopy imaging in non-contact mode has been performed on several blend samples. The investigated thin films, having thicknesses ranging between 70 and 100 nm, were spin-coated onto ITO–glass substrates previously coated with an 80 nm thick PEDOT : PSS layer. The films were prepared using three different weight ratios of the two components in chloroform solutions, namely 3 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 of P3HT : T5OHM. The corresponding representative SFM images are shown in Fig. 4a, 4b and 4c, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Topographical SFM image recorded in non-contact mode of blend films with different weight ratio of P3HT : T5OHM: (a) 3 : 1; (b) 1 : 1; (c) 1 : 3. z-Scales: (a) 125 nm; (b) 100 nm; (c) 300 nm. 
The 3 : 1 ratio film exhibits a few sub-micron sized objects, characterized by sharp edges, embedded in a grainy matrix. The number of these objects notably increases with the concentration of T5OHM in the blend. This unambiguously permits the assignment of the grainy matrix to P3HT and the sharpened features to T5OHM. The quantity of the T5OHM objects increases even further by enhancing the relative amount of the oligomer in the blend (Fig. 4c) leading to a morphology almost fully characterized by these structures. These polygonal architectures exhibit truly sharpened edges, suggesting a high degree of order existing in these objects, especially if one considers that they are self-assembled on the surface by spin-coating. Moreover their surfaces are extraordinarily smooth, although, most surprisingly, the facets are not fully flat. In each object more than one non-adjacent edges in the tetragonal structure appear in the topographical image with a darker color (see black arrows in Fig. 4b). Given that on the crystal surface we could not observe steps indicating the presence of two different surface planes, the obtained structures are very peculiar. This limited planarity of the crystals might be due to an intrinsic curvature of the architecture, which would reflect on the sub-micrometre scale the asymmetrical functionalization of the T5OHM molecular structure.
For the sake of comparison, the morphologies of neat films of the electron donor (P3HT) and of the electron acceptor (T5OHM) components have been also explored. Fig. 5a shows a film of P3HT supported on ITO–PEDOT : PSS. It reveals tightly packed grains with an average diameter of 80–90 nm, similar to those observed in Fig. 4a. The polydispersity of P3HT, together with the finite rigidity of the long polymer chains, hinder the formation of broad crystalline architectures. However, the strong π–π interactions govern the self-organization into the observed grain aggregates.
 Fig. 5  Topographical SFM image recorded in non-contact mode of neat P3HT (a) and T5OHM (b and c). The image of T5OHM is shown with two different color bars in order to give evidence either to the background consisting of tightly packed sub-micrometre sized crystals in (b), or to the macro-structures adsorbed on the top in (c). z-Scales: (a) 40 nm; (b) 50 nm; (c) 200 nm. 

Fig. 5b and c display the topography of a thin film of T5OHM. The film conveys macroscopic tall aggregates (see Fig. 5c), having a fractal shape, with heights in the 50–150 nm range and branches with widths in the tens of nanometres scale forming micrometre sized leaf-like architectures. These anisotropic agglomerates are lying on the top of a matrix of tightly packed crystals, with diameters up to one micrometre, forming a layer (highlighted in Fig. 5b). Each of these grainy structures consists of rod-like objects that are closely packed. The existence of these two different types of arrangements, namely the tall agglomerates and the grainy structure, could be ascribed to structural transition of the Stransky–Krastanov25 type within the film.
Differently from P3HT, the monodisperse T5OHM is capable of organizing into ordered assemblies having micrometre lateral sizes and sharp edges. This high degree of organization is astonishing if one considers the non-symmetrical shape of the molecule due to the different lengths of the aliphatic side groups, leading to an overall Cs symmetry if one does not take into account the tendency of the alkyl side chains to adopt a non-planar, or even sometimes coiled, conformation.
To cast light onto the structure of the investigated materials, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on films spin-coated onto low background quartz plates (for the case of P3HT, T5OHM and P3HT : T5OHM blends) as well as on a T5OHM powder sample. The XRD pattern of the T5OHM powder sample is displayed in Fig. 6a. The presence of narrow peaks and the absence of appreciable amorphous halos provide evidence for a good degree of crystallinity of the sample. Fig. 6b and 6c show the XRD patterns of the 1 : 3 and 1 : 1 blend samples, respectively. Both profiles are characterized by the low angle reflections. In addition, when a very slow data collection is performed, low intensity reflections are also observed for the 1 : 3 blend sample in the wide angle region (Fig. 6c). These peaks can be ascribed to the T5OHM component. For the sake of clarity the low angle region of the profiles is reported in Fig. 7. In the 1 : 1 blend (Fig. 7c) a reflection is found at 2θ
				= 5.55°, corresponding to d
				= 1.59 nm, while the 1 : 3 blend (Fig. 7b) shows a further peak at 2θ
				= 4.6°
				(d
				= 1.92 nm). As previously reported for polyalkylthiophenes possessing alkyl side chains with six or more carbon atoms,26 the sharp low-angle crystalline peak corresponds to the first order reflection which can be attributed to the distance between almost parallel polythiophene chains belonging to the same plane. This distance amounts to 1.68 nm for P3HT (2θ
				= 5.25°).27 In principle the mean distance of the polythiophene chains is maintained in the 1 : 1 blend (Fig. 7c), since the reflection is strongly asymmetric and should be the convolution of the reflection of the polymer (2θ
				= 5.25°) together with the T5OHM signal at 2θ
				= 5.55°. The presence of two distinct reflections in the 1 : 3 blend film seems to be due to two different mean distances between thiophene backbones, regardless the presence of a phase segregation between the two components. These reflections could be likely related to an amount of T5OHM dispersed in the amorphous P3HT-rich phase of the blend. In any case the reflection d
				= 1.59 nm is directly correlated to the distance between the molecules of T5OHM, since the same reflection is also present in both the T5OHM film and the powder sample. In the 1 : 3 blend sample, the presence of a wide angle pattern that strictly matches that of T5OHM powder, even if it has a low intensity, provides evidence for the presence of crystalline T5OHM in the blend samples. This is in good agreement with the SFM results described above.

Photocells were prepared at different P3HT : T5OHM weight ratios and with comparable thickness of the device active layer (80–100 nm). The devices, realized in ambient conditions apart from the cathode deposition, were tested in vacuum (10−3 mbar) under white light irradiation of about 80 mW cm−2. Junctions with good diode properties were obtained in all cases. The current–voltage curves in the dark exhibited a rectification ratio of the order of 102–103 at |2| V (not shown here). The trend of the photovoltaic parameters, averaged over three cells, is reported in Fig. 8 as a function of the concentration of the oligomer in the blends. A significant improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the blended devices, with respect to that of cells made of pristine P3HT or T5OHM, was observed. This indicates that the blend films do indeed generate photocurrents through charge separation at the donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction. An enhancement of both the short-circuit current (jsc) and the power conversion efficiency (η) was obtained with a T5OHM content as low as 25% by weight. The best performance was achieved for blends in which the amount of the oligothiophene was in the 40–50% range. A representative current–voltage curve under illumination is shown in Fig. 9. A gain of over forty-fold for the short-circuit current was obtained in the case of cells with an acceptor content of 50%, with respect to the neat donor cells (from 5.7 × 10−6 to 2.4 × 10−4 A cm−2). Taking advantage of the improvement of the values of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the blended devices, an increase up to sixty-fold was achieved for the power conversion efficiency (from 9.4 × 10−4% for neat donor cells to 6.0 × 10−2% for blended cells with a T5OHM content of 50%). The gain for η was even higher in comparison with the cells based on the bare electron-acceptor, the best power conversion efficiency achieved for pristine T5OHM cells being 7.2 × 10−4%.

Upon addition of the oligothiophene, a considerable increase of the open-circuit voltage was observed (from 0.4 V to around 0.9 V). The value of Voc of the cells made of pristine P3HT is approximately the one expected on the basis of the metal–insulator–metal diode model. In such a model, the upper limit of Voc is defined by the difference of the work functions of the electrode materials (ITO–PEDOT : PSS and aluminium in the present case). Differently, the open-circuit voltage of a D–A bulk-heterojunction solar cell is related to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor component.28 The high value of the open-circuit voltage exhibited by the P3HT : T5OHM cells is justified by the energetics of the two components.2–20
A decrease of the fill factor (FF) was observed with the increasing T5OHM concentration in the blends. The reason for this drop of FF is not clear at this stage. In general, an increasing series resistance and a decreasing shunt resistance tend to reduce the fill factor. Furthermore, FF could be affected by the morphology of the active layer in blended devices. In the case of the studied cells, a reduction of the shunt resistance could be justified for high T5OHM contents, as the active layer morphology is characterized by T5OHM crystallites with dimensions up to half a micrometre (Fig. 4).
Conclusions
We reported a joint photophysical and structural study of a newly synthesized pentathiophene-S,S-dioxide (T5OHM), together with an investigation of the morphological and photoresponsive properties of blends of this compound, as electron-acceptor, with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene)
				(P3HT), electron-donor.
P3HT : T5OHM blends with different D–A weight ratios were prepared and employed as the active layers in sandwiched photovoltaic devices between ITO and Al electrodes. A notable phase segregation between the two components was observed in the blended films, owing to the tendency of T5OHM to form micrometre sized features characterized by sharp edges and a high degree of crystallinity. The P3HT : T5OHM films showed significantly enhanced photovoltaic response in comparison to P3HT single layer, exhibiting an increase in the power conversion efficiency by a factor of up to 60. These results are surprising if one considers the notable phase segregation in the blends, with consequent reduction of the D–A interfacial area. However a trade-off could exist between the efficiency of charge separation and transport in blended solar cells. Improved transport properties through the structured acceptor network could be hypothesized in these samples, partially balancing the reduced interfacial area for the charge transfer between the acceptor and the donor components.
Current work in our laboratories involves the design and the synthesis of new oligothiophene-S,S-dioxides, in order to achieve a better control over the morphology of the photoactive blends of these compounds with common electron-donor polymers. This is required to improve the performance of these devices. Interpenetrating D–A networks with phase separation at the nanoscale level should be the ideal structure for a high amount of photogenerated charges, the exciton diffusion length being of around 10 nm in polymer solar cells.29
