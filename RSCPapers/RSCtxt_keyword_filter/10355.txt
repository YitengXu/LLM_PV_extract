    , Accepted 27th April 2018First published on 28th April 2018AbstractFast and efficient ion-exchange reactions endow CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs) with superior photoluminescence (PL) properties. In this study, SnX2 (X = I, Cl) was used as a Sn precursor to conduct the cation exchange reaction, which was promoted by anion exchange between the parent CsPbBr3 NCs and the guest X in SnX2. The anion-driven cation exchange reaction occurred efficiently (10 min). CsSnI3 NCs were created by ion-exchange reactions between CsPbBr3 NCs and the SnI2 precursor. The CsSnI3 NCs retained the initial morphology of CsPbBr3 NCs and revealed a high PL efficiency (59%) and prolonged PL lifetime. In contrast, the exchange reaction of Sn2+ ions in CsPbBr3 NCs did not occur in a short time using SnBr2 as a precursor. After the cation exchange reaction, the 4f peaks of Pb ions in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra shifted to low binding energies as compared to those of the parent CsPbX3 NCs. This is ascribed to the increase in the number of Pb–oleate (Pb–OA) species. Contrary to the hot-injection method used to synthesize CsSnI3 NCs, the kinetically controlled ion exchange reactions lead to the synthesis of CsSnI3 NCs with a high structural stability. Thus, an anion-exchange-promoted cation exchange reaction is a particularly efficient versatile tool to dope Sn2+ into CsPbX3 NCs.
Introduction
Inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with the formula CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I), have attracted significant scientific interest. These semiconducting materials exhibit outstanding optical properties including high photo-luminescence quantum yields (PLQYs, up to 90%), narrow emission spectra, high defect tolerance, and tunable PL throughout the entire visible spectrum. The recent development of colloidal CsPbX3 perovskite NCs has triggered significant interest among researchers for applications such as in light-emitting diodes (LED), solar cells, and lasers.1,2 The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has improved from 3.8 to 22.1%.3 As photoactive materials of photovoltaic cells, perovskites are considered to be the best candidate for the next generation of high-performance solar cells due to their wide absorption ranges, high carrier mobility, and long electron–hole diffusion lengths.4,5 Inspired by the achievements made in solar cells, there have been some studies about the use of cesium lead halide perovskites as newcomer photocatalytic materials to realize photochemical conversion.6,7 Inorganic lead halide perovskite NCs have been used as optoelectronic and photocatalytic materials.
The optoelectronic properties of perovskite NCs are easily tailored by controlling their size, shape, and composition.8–10 Currently, halide perovskite NCs with a variety of morphologies, such as cubes, nanowires, nanoplatelets, and nanocages, have been synthesized.8,9,11–13 It is well documented that compositional modulations generally lead to novel optical, magnetic, and electrical properties.14 Through halide exchange reactions, the PL can be tuned over the entire visible spectral region. However, the toxicity of the lead component cannot be ignored for commercial applications. As a result, the replacement of toxic Pb with other nontoxic elements is required. Studies have been reported in which lead has been replaced with nontoxic metals such as tin, manganese, and bismuth;15,16 in particular, doping of Sn into perovskites can dramatically improve the performance of the perovskites in solar cells and LEDs.17 A hot-injection method is usually used to partially replace the toxic lead with nontoxic elements; however, toxic tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP), as a reducing and coordinating solvent, is always used in the reaction solution.16,17 In contrast, an ion-exchange reaction occurring at room temperature is a particularly versatile method for the synthesis of metastable nanomaterials that cannot be directly synthesized by the hot-injection method because it is easy to effectively control the degree of the ion-exchange reaction.18
For traditional NCs, cation exchange reactions are more prevalent than anion exchange reactions because doped cations endow NCs with adjusted optical and magnetic properties.19,20 However, this is different for halide perovskite NCs, in which Pb cations are surrounded by six halide anions to form a rigid octahedral structure. The framework of the perovskite structure is retained by lead ions.10 It has been found that replacement of Pb2+ with other cations (Rb+, Ag+, Cu+, Ba2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, or Bi3+) in CsPbBr3 NCs leads to the decomposition of the parent NCs.21 As a result, a few studies have been focused on the cation exchange reactions although cation exchange is more likely to bestow the parent NCs with novel functionalities. Daniel et al. have presented a method to replace Pb2+ with isovalent cations, such as Sn2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+, but a long reaction time was required at room temperature.22
Considering the abovementioned limitations of the cation exchange, a fast and deliberately partial or complete cation exchange reaction driven by a halide instead of Pb2+ with nontoxic Sn2+ was developed. After ion exchange between the CsPbBr3 NCs and SnI2 precursors, the CsSnI3 NCs were obtained, and they maintained the initial morphology and high PLQYs. The exchange reaction only occurred when the halide of the SnX2 precursor and CsPbX3 NCs was different. After ion exchange, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted, and it demonstrated that Pb cations got rid of the Pb–Br species to form Pb–oleate (OA) complexes. The anion exchange reaction broke the Pb–Br bonding in the octahedron and provided a driving force for cation exchange between the host Pb2+ and guest Sn2+.
Experimental
Chemicals
Lead bromide (PbBr2, 99%), lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.5%), tin(II) chloride (SnCl2), and oleylamine (OAm, 90%) were purchased from Aladdin. Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.9%), tin(II) iodide (SnI2, 99.99%), tin(II) bromide (SnBr2), octadecene (ODE, technical grade of 90%), and OA were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Hexane, toluene, ethanol, and methyl acetate (MeOAc, 98%) were purchased from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Company. All chemicals were used without further purification.
CsPbX3 (X = Br, Cl) NC synthesis and purification
The CsPbX3 (X = Br, Cl) NCs were synthesized according to the method described in the literature, with slight modifications.8 At first, a cesium oleate (Cs–OA) precursor stock solution was prepared by loading 0.16 g of Cs2CO3, 2.5 mL of OA, and 6 mL of ODE into a 50 mL 3-necked flask. The temperature of the solution was kept at 120 °C for 30 min and then increased to 150 °C under N2 until Cs2CO3 completely reacted with OA. After this, 5 mL of ODE and 69 mg of PbBr2 (or 45 mg of PbCl2) were loaded in a 50 mL 4-necked flask and dried in vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C. Then, OAm (1 mL) and OA (1 mL) were injected at 120 °C under a N2 atmosphere. After complete solubilisation, the temperature was increased to 180 °C, and 0.4 mL of Cs–OA was quickly injected. The resulting solution was immediately cooled down to room temperature using an ice bath. The CsPbX3 NCs were purified by adding a small amount of ethanol in a volume ratio of 1:10 and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 4 min. The NCs were re-suspended in hexane.
Cation exchange
The precursor solutions for cation exchange were prepared as follows: 0.1 mmol of SnX2 was loaded into a 3-necked flask along with 9.1 mL of hexane followed by stirring at 50 °C. After this, 0.4 mL of OA and 0.5 mL of OAm were injected into the solution of the completely dissolved SnX2 salts. Finally, the concentration of CsPbX3 colloidal solutions and SnX2 precursor solutions were controlled to 100 μM. In a typical cation exchange experiment, 100 μL of CsPbX3 colloidal solution (100 μM) was dispersed in 2 mL of hexane. After this, the SnX2 precursor solution (100 μM) at different amounts was injected under stirring for 10 min at room temperature and under atmospheric conditions. The preparation conditions of the samples are illustrated in Table S1 (ESI†). To adjust the PL spectra of the resulting samples, the molar ratio of SnX2 and CsPbX3 was changed. Samples were centrifuged at 104 rpm for 10 min along with the same volume of methyl acetate as an antisolvent. The isolated samples were re-dispersed in hexane for further characterization.
CsPbBr3 doped with SnI2via one pot hot-injection synthesis
For comparison, Sn-doped CsPbBr3 samples were prepared using one-pot hot-injection synthesis. PbBr2 and SnI2 were loaded into a 50 mL 4-necked flask along with 5 mL of ODE. After drying in vacuum for 1 h at 120 °C, OAm (1 mL) and OA (1 mL) were injected at 120 °C under a N2 atmosphere. After complete solubilisation, the temperature was increased to 180 °C, and 0.4 mL of Cs–OA was quickly injected. The resulting solution was immediately cooled down to room temperature using an ice bath. The molar ratio of Pb and Sn was tuned by changing the molar ratio of PbBr2 and SnI2. The preparation conditions of the samples are illustrated in Table S2 (ESI†). The crude solution was first centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3 min for purification. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 4 min with the addition of MeOAc.
Characterization
A Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer was used to obtain the absorption spectra. Photoluminescence measurements were performed using the Hitachi F-4600 spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained via a Bruker D8 X-ray powder diffractometer using a Cu Kα target. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2010 microscope operated at 120 kV. PL lifetime measurements were carried out using the time-correlated single-photon-counting spectrofluorometer system (λex = 370 nm, Fluorocube-01, JY-IBH, Horiba). The PLQYs of samples in solutions were estimated by comparison with those of the standard solution such as a rhodamine 6G (efficiency of ∼95%) ethanol solution. The emission intensity P0 (in units of the number of photons) is expressed as P0 ≈ Kη0a010−0.5a0 (K is the apparatus function and a0 is the absorbance at 365 nm excitation wavelength). The absorbance and PL intensity of samples were measured when the same apparatus parameters were used. The PLQY of samples was calculated by comparison with the PL intensity P0 of a rhodamine 6G solution. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out in a JEOL JEM-2100F TEM equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) system model JED 2300T. Analytical LCMS was carried out using a PR-LCMS-2020 system. Samples were routinely filtered and injected on a Waters Xbridge Column, C18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 50 mm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha Al-Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) with a 400 μm spot size and 20 eV pass energy.
Results and discussion
The CsSnX3 perovskite NCs were synthesized via a one pot hot-injection method. However, tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) was used in the reaction solution.16,17 Sn-doped CsPbBr3 NCs (samples 1–6) were prepared via one-pot hot-injection synthesis without TOP. For the samples 1–4, the absorption and PL peaks red shifted with an increase in the amount of SnI2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). These two absorption peaks are related to the 3D and 0D phase of perovskite NCs.23 The absorption spectrum of sample 1 has two peaks. When the molar ratio of PbBr2/SnI2 was 1:4 (sample 5), the absorption peak shifted to a longer wavelength, and the peak at 350 nm disappeared. If no PbBr2 was added (sample 6), no absorption peak was observed. XRD analysis indicated that the sample 6 was CsI. This confirms the decomposition of the perovskite structure (Fig. S2, ESI†). Thus, TOP was vital to maintain the structural stability of the Cs(Snx/Pb1−x)(Bry/I1−y)3 perovskite NCs synthesized by a hot-injection method.
Contrary to the thermodynamically controlled hot-injection synthesis, the ion exchange reaction was a kinetically controlled process that did not require TOP. At first, the CsPbX3 NCs were synthesized by a typical hot-injection method using the PbX2 and Cs–OA precursor. The reaction between PbX2 and Cs–OA was as follows:24 2Cs–OA + 3PbX2 → 2CsPbX3 + PbOA2(1)
Some polymorphs, such as cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, and monoclinic, of the perovskite lattice have been reported.11 However, the cubic phase with the highest symmetric structure was always obtained at relatively high temperatures.25 To purify the as-prepared CsPbX3 QDs, a mixture of hexane and a small amount of ethanol was utilized to precipitate the NCs from the solution because polar ethanol initiated NC aggregation, and the NCs precipitated upon centrifugation.26 Since CsPbBr3 NCs possess regular morphology, high PLQYs, and high stability than CsPbI3 and CsPbCl3 NCs, CsPbBr3 NCs were selected to investigate the cation exchange reactions. After the ion exchange reaction, methyl acetate was used as an antisolvent to purify the exchanged perovskite NCs following a recent study reported by Abhishek. Because of the MeOAc-extracted cubic phase CsPbI3 NCs, the PL was not degraded.1
The samples A1–A6 were prepared by adding SnI2 solutions at different amounts to the CsPbBr3 solutions. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the absorption and PL peak were red-shifted upon increasing the addition amount of the SnI2 precursor. The peak position of the absorption and PL spectra and the full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the PL spectra are illustrated in Table S3 (ESI†). The inset in Fig. 1(a) shows the color images of the samples under 365 nm UV light. Previous studies have reported that I anions entering the lattice can result in the red-shift of the PL spectra since the incorporation of I− ions expands the cell.8,10 However, whether ion exchange has occurred needs to be proved.

The CsPbBr3 NCs (sample A1) crystallized as a monoclinic phase with higher XRD peak intensity in (100), (200), and (110) planes, corresponding to the tendency of the cubic phase shown in Fig. 1(b). The XRD pattern in Fig. 1(c) demonstrates that sample A6 is CsSnI3 crystallized in the orthorhombic phase, which is consistent with literature findings that both CsSnBr3 and CsSnI3 form perovskite crystal structures with low symmetry.16 Rietveld refinement was used to fit the XRD pattern of the sample A6 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The orthorhombic model of CsSnI3 fitted well with the experimental data of the sample A6 (Rwp < 15%). The enlarged XRD pattern between 20° and 30° is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The blue line represents the standard PDF card of Cs2SnI6. The inset rhombus indicates the impurity peaks. It has been reported that Sn2+-based CsSnX3 is unstable and easily oxidizes to Sn4+; this results in the presence of a small amount of Cs2SnI6.16,17,27 For sample A6, XRD analysis indicated that the cation exchange between Pb2+ and Sn2+ ions was accompanied by the anion exchange between Br− and I−.
After the ion exchange reaction, the PLQY of CsSnI3 NCs was 59.17%, which decreased slightly as compared to that of the parent CsPbBr3 NCs (73.47%). This result indicated that the ion exchange reaction did not increase the structural and surface defects because the defects decreased the PLQYs. The time-resolved PL decay curves of samples A1–A6 were measured (Fig. S5, ESI†). A biexponential model was used to fit the decay curves. The model is described as follows: F(τ) = A + B1exp(−τ/τ1) + B2exp(−τ/τ2)(2)where τ1 and τ2 represent the time constants and B1 and B2 represent the amplitudes of the fast and slow components, respectively. The average lifetime was calculated as follows: τ = (B1τ12 + B2τ22)/(B1τ1 + B2τ2)(3)
The fitting parameters in PL decay curves and average lifetimes are illustrated in Table S4 (ESI†). The average lifetime (τ) increased with an increase in the amount of Sn2+ and I− ions (22–39.18 ns). The average lifetimes of CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 NCs were 22.00 and 39.18 ns, respectively. Compared with our previous result indicating that the average lifetime of CsPbI3 NCs was 127.03,26 the average lifetime for CsSnI3 NCs decreased to 39.18 ns. It has been demonstrated that doping of Sn into the CsPbX3 perovskite host decreases the average lifetime.22 For the sample A6, the evolution of PL spectra with time was measured (Fig. S6, ESI†). The ion exchange reaction quickly occurred within 10 min. After this, the PL peak position remained unchanged.
The TEM images in Fig. 2(a and d) show that the shapes of NCs are preserved after the fast ion-exchange reaction. The average size of sample A1 (CsPbBr3) and A6 (CsSnI3) was 14.04 and 16.93 nm, respectively (Fig. 2(c and f)). Owing to the similar ionic radii of Sn2+ (118 pm) and Pb2+ (119 pm), the increase in the average size is mainly ascribed to the I anions entering the lattice.2 After the ion-exchange reactions, the size distribution became broad. The lattice fringes of the sample A1 is 5.8 Å, corresponding to the (100) facet of the CsPbBr3 monoclinic phase (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2e, a lattice spacing of 6.2 Å was clearly observed, corresponding to the (002) plane of sample A6, which revealed that the CsSnI3 particles were highly crystalline. Compared with the case of the sample A1, no remarkable defects were observed in the TEM image of sample A6. It must be noted that after 2 min irradiation by 200 kV of incident electron energy, the CsSnI3 NCs decompose almost completely (Fig. S7, ESI†). This illustrated the decrease in the perovskite structure stability after the ion-exchange reaction.28

EDS element mapping and quantification analysis were conducted for sample A6. Fig. 3(a–d) show that the Cs, Sn, and I ions were uniformly distributed. The quantification analysis indicated that the molar ratio of Cs:Sn:I was 0.13:0.16:0.3, as shown in Fig. 3e. Sample A2 was also measured by TEM and EDS analysis. The higher concentration of Cu and C elements was due to the Cu grid. The average size of the sample A2 is 15.15 nm (Fig. S8(a), ESI†). The EDS quantification analysis demonstrated the presence of Sn and I ions (Fig. S8(b), ESI†). The molar ratio of Cs:Pb:Sn:Br:I is 0.267:0.2:0.012:0.174:0.06. The low amount of halide is mainly ascribed to the desorption of halogen species under electron irradiation.28

Both Sn and Pb are in group IV of the periodic table. Moreover, Sn2+ has the ns2 electronic configuration in the outermost s orbital, and this electronic configuration can provide an antibonding valence band maximum, which is the same as the antibonding valence band maximum of CsPbX3.29 Hence, it is promising to replace Pb with nontoxic Sn. The stability of a CsSnI3 perovskite crystal was theoretically estimated using the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) calculated from the ionic radii. The formula was expressed as follows: (4)where rA, rB, and rX represent the ionic radii of the elements Cs, Sn, and I, respectively. The ionic radius of Cs2+ (coordination number = 12) is 118 pm. The ionic radii of Sn2+ (coordination number = 6) and I− are 118 pm and 220 pm, respectively.22 After calculation, the value of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is 0.71. It has been demonstrated that the orthorhombic or rhombohedral structure will be obtained when the tolerance factor value is in the range of 0.71–0.9.5 This result is consistent with the XRD measurement of CsSnI3 NCs. To indicate the role of I− ions in the exchange of Pb2+ and Sn2+ ions, samples were prepared as samples B1, B2, and B3 (Table S1, ESI†). It was found that the absorption and PL peak of the samples remained unchanged with an increase in the amount of the SnBr2 precursor solution, as shown in Fig. 4a. According to the ion-exchange reaction between CsPbBr3 and SnI2, a cation exchange reaction evidently took place when 3 mL of SnI2 precursor solution was used. Therefore, the sample B3 was prepared by adding 3 mL of the SnBr2 precursor solution. XRD analysis confirms that sample B3 is the CsPbBr3 phase, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase, as shown in Fig. 4b. The peak at 29.454 degrees was due to H2O (PDF #16-0598). As shown in Fig. 4c, the lattice fringes were 4.13 Å, corresponding to the (110) facet of the CsPbBr3 monoclinic phase. No cation exchange reaction occurred between the parent CsPbBr3 and guest SnBr2.

To verify the abovementioned result further, EDS element mapping was obtained for the sample B3. The EDS mapping measurements highlighted the spatial chemical distribution of Cs (red), Pb (green), and Br (blue). The result indicated that Cs, Pb, and Br ions had a uniform distribution in the NCs, and Sn cations were not incorporated into the lattice (Fig. 5a–d). Quantification of the EDS measurements reveals the molar ratios of Cs/Pb/Br at 0.21/0.19/0.5, almost in accordance with the ratio of CsPbBr3 at 1/1/3. Daniel et al. conducted a partial cation exchange reaction between the colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs and SnBr2 precursor stock solutions, in which Pb2+ was partially replaced by Sn2+, and doped CsPb1−xSnxBr3 NCs (0 < x ≤ 0.1) were obtained.22 However, a reaction time of 16 h was required at room temperature. In general, compared to the efficient and fast anion exchange process, cation diffusion in perovskites is very slow.8,10 In our experiments, both SnI2 and SnBr2 were used as the Sn source to replace the native Pb cations in CsPbBr3 NCs. After stirring for 10 min, only SnI2 could render the cation exchange between CsPbBr3 and SnI2. As a result, the anion exchange reaction broke the Pb–Br bonding in the octahedral structure and provided a driving force for cation exchange between the host Pb2+ and the guest Sn2+. This phenomenon is also reported for cation exchange between Pb2+ and Mn2+.18
 Fig. 5  TEM image (a) and the corresponding EDS maps of Cs (b), Pb (c), and Br (d) for sample B3. 
To study the ion exchange process, the SnCl2 precursor solution was also used to provide Sn2+. Sample C was synthesized by adding 1 mL of the SnCl2 precursor solution (100 μM) to 100 μL CsPbBr3 colloidal solution (100 μM). The cubic morphology was not changed after the ion exchange reaction (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b, all the peaks of the sample were in the middle of the standard PDF card of CsPbCl3 and CsSnBr3; this suggested that the NCs were an intermediate phase between the cubic CsPbCl3 phase and cubic CsSnBr3 phase. Upon comparing this with the standard PDF card of CsPbCl3 and CsSnBr3, the yellow circle shows the lack of a peak in the middle of 26.62 and 27.54, corresponding to the (111) plane of CsSnBr3 and CsPbCl3. Since the halides are different in the colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs and SnCl2 precursor stock solutions, the cation exchange reaction takes place. Sample D was prepared by adding 3 mL of SnCl2 (100 μM) precursor solution to a CsPbCl3 colloidal solution (100 μM, 100 μL). As shown in Fig. 6c, both parent CsPbCl3 NCs and Sample D crystallized in the tetragonal phase of CsPbCl3. Although a sufficient volume of the SnCl2 precursor solution was added, there was no guest Sn2+ in the lattice.

CsPbBr3 NCs exhibited highest defect tolerance.29 In general, guest ions can diffuse into the parent NCs lattice either via an interstitial or via a vacancy-assisted mechanism.30 However, interstitial migration has not been observed herein owing to the close-packed configuration of perovskite structures.31 During the SnX2 dissolution process, SnX2 reacted with OAm and OA to form a solution. This process was similar to that of PbX2.23 The formation reaction is detailed below:24 SnX2 + xHOOCR + xRNH2 → SnX(2−x)(OOCR)x + xRNH3X x = 1, 2(5)Herein, a mixture of Sn(OOCR)2, RNH3–X, Sn–X–OOCR, and other binding species was present in the precursor solution. The mass spectrum of the SnI2 precursor solution, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), indicated the presence of RNH3–I (M = 395.39) and Sn–I–OOCR (M = 527.07). Fig. S10(b) (ESI†) shows RNH3-Br (M = 348.39) and Sn–Br–OOCR (M = 481.07) present in the SnBr2 precursor solution. This confirms that I ions have a high reaction activity. Fig. 7 presents the schematic of the Sn2+ exchange process, which is driven by the I− exchange reaction. After adding the SnI2 precursor solution to the parent CsPbBr3 solution, the fast and efficient anion exchange reactions between the parent CsPbBr3 NCs and the RNH3I complexes occurred due to the high diffusion/migration ability of halide anions and the effective vacancy-assisted diffusion mechanism.10 Moreover, inward diffusion of Sn2+ and outward diffusion of Pb2+ were primarily driven by the increase in entropy. However, the cation exchange reaction was generally slow due to the demand of high activation energies. This is the reason why cation exchange is not observed between the SnBr2 precursor solution and CsPbBr3 during this short time.
 Fig. 7  Schematic of the ion exchange process in CsPbBr3 NCs upon adding the SnI2 precursor. 
When SnI2 was used to conduct the ion exchange reaction, the anion exchange reaction occurred, and Pb–Br bonding was broken in the octahedral structure. As a result, the anion exchange process broke the thermodynamic balance and provided the driving force for cation exchange between the host Pb2+ and the guest Sn2+. In addition, more halide vacancies probably formed as a result of the anion exchange reaction. It has been reported that cation exchange is actually driven by the concentration of halide vacancies.22,32,33 More halide vacancies are probably formed due to the anion exchange reaction, but it has been reported that an increase in the concentration of surface halide vacancies does not directly increase the extent of cation exchange for shorter reaction times.22 Thus, the breakage of the Pb–Br bonding of the octahedral structure by anion exchange is the main reason for the anion-driven Sn2+ exchange reaction.
XPS measurements were used to indicate the breaking of the parent Pb–Br bonds and formation of the Pb–OA bonds. All XPS spectra were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV (Fig. S10, ESI†). The lower binding energy shift of the Pb 4f spectrum was shown for CsPbxSn1−x(BryI1−y)3 NCs as compared to that for the parent CsPbBr3 NCs (Fig. S11, ESI†). It has been reported that Pb2+ in CsPbBr3 NCs are in two chemical environments: the higher band energy regions and the lower band energy regions, corresponding to the Pb–Br and Pb–OA complexes, respectively.34,35 The lower binding energy shift of the Pb 4f spectrum for CsPbxSn1−x(BryI1−y)3 NCs demonstrated an increase in the number of Pb–OA complexes as well as a decrease in the number of Pb–Br species in reference to the case of the parent CsPbBr3 NCs (Fig. 8(a and b)). In addition, the intensity of Pb–OA peaks in CsPbxSn1−x(BryI1−y)3 NCs was high as compared to that of the parent CsPbBr3 NCs. Moreover, the Br 3d peaks shifted from 69.73 and 68.67 to 68.87 and 67.69, respectively. The shift to the lower binding energy region was assigned to the decrease in the number of the Pb–Br species.35,36 In conclusion, compared to the case of the parent CsPbBr3 NCs, there were more Pb cations originating from the Pb–Br species that formed the Pb–OA complexes; the XPS measurement was further evidence of the Sn and I ions entering the lattice. The atomic ratio of Pb/Sn/Br/I was 0.59/0.13/1.26/0.38. Both CsPbxSn1−x(BryI1−y)3 NCs and the parent CsPbBr3 NCs showed cation-rich composition (Table S5, ESI†). Previous research has demonstrated that OA and OAm have some interaction.23,37,38 As a result, the Pb–OA complexes were extracted by OAm, and the Sn–OA complexes were incorporated. Finally, the extraction rate and the incorporation rate reached a balance. The anion exchange reaction between the native CsPbBr3 NCs and the guest SnX2 (X = I, Cl) precursor promoted the incorporation of the Sn cations.
 Fig. 8  Peak fitting of the Pb 4f spectra of (a) parent CsPbBr3 and (b) CsPbxSn1−x(BryI1−y)3 NCs, and Br 3d spectra of (c) parent CsPbBr3 and (d) CsPbxSn1−x(BryI1−y)3 NCs. The spectra were calibrated using the C 1s peak. 
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated fast and deliberately partial or complete Sn cation exchange reactions driven by a halide exchange reaction. If the precursor and CsPbX3 NCs had a different halide, the cation exchange took place. The anion exchange reaction provided a driving force for cation exchange between the host Pb2+ and guest Sn2+. Contrary to the case of the one-pot hot injection method, herein, no TOP was used. After ion exchange between CsPbBr3 NCs and the SnI2 precursor, CsSnI3 NCs were prepared, and they maintained high PLQYs. This study opens up new opportunities to tune the composition of lead halide perovskite NCs and endow NCs with more special properties. The anion-driven Sn2+ exchange reactions create a possibility for further applications for perovskite NCs.
