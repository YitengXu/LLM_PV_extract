    , Accepted 26th December 2022First published on 30th December 2022AbstractOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer promising aspects such as high efficiency, low-cost, and flexible. The booming growth of PSCs cannot be achieved without the application of chemical dopant engineering. The hole-transporting layer (HTL) in PSCs are critical for predicting device performance and are a major bottleneck for further improving device stability and efficiency. Li–TFSI/t-BP, which are widely used in the doping of hole-transporting materials (HTMs), are essential for the preparation of high-performance devices, and although many novel dopants have been reported, the state-of-the-art devices are still based on this bi-doping system. This review summarizes the latest advances in the modification of the Li–TFSI/t-BP bi-doping system in PSCs. It systematically presents the mechanism of Li–TFSI/t-BP doping of spiro-OMeTAD and the major factors affecting this doping reaction. The modification strategy of the Li–TFSI/t-BP bi-doping system and the application of co-dopant in this system have been focused on. In addition, the selection of doping methods for different doping systems, mainly divided into liquid–liquid, liquid–solid, and gas–solid contact doping methods, is briefly introduced. Finally, the corresponding design principles of the doping system and the subsequent development perspectives in this field are discussed in detail.
1. Introduction
The demand for limiting CO2 emission makes the development of green energy resources vital for the sustainability of the global ecosystem. Among various renewable energy technologies, solar energy offers the most viable solution to problems posed by huge CO2 emission. Among various types of photovoltaic energy harvesting devices, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained special interest due to the potential benefits they offer such as rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) values, ease of fabrication, and cost-effective processing. Considering ongoing research and development efforts, it can be predicted that soon PCE of PSCs will meet the values shown by commercial solar cells (certified PCE of 25.7%).1 Dopants play a critical role in the functioning of PSCs. PSCs comprises a multilayered structure and the proper doping of each layer is important to boost the overall performance of the device.2–4 The research on the hole-transporting layer (HTL) can be divided into the following fields: fabricating HTL-free PSCs, developing novel hole-transporting materials (HTMs), and corresponding chemical dopants. Currently, the efficiency of HTL-free PSCs reaches up to 18.9%,5 while the maximum efficiency of devices with dopant-free HTM is 22.17%.6 Potentially, the optimal efficiency of Li–TFSI/t-BP-doped PSCs is over 25%.1,7 The ongoing research efforts yielded various novel classes of HTMs such as organic small molecules,8,9 polymers,10 and inorganic compounds11,12 have been employed in PSCs; however, the most widely used and effective one is still 2,2′,7,7′-tetra[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), a classical organic small molecule HTM. The spatial configuration of the spiro-OMeTAD molecule shows a mutually crossed rigid structure with a high spatial site resistance, which ensures good solubility and thermal stability, but also leads to a low intrinsic conductivity and hole mobility.13 Therefore, additional dopants are required for p-doping to improve the hole-transporting performance and hence improve the overall efficiency of PSCs.14 Besides, spiro-OMeTAD shows high compatibility with the dopants and favorable alignment with the energy band of the perovskite.15–17 So far, various dopants have been thoroughly analyzed for doping spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs.18–22 However, the dual doping mechanism based on Li–TFSI/t-BP bi-dopants has been performed exceptionally well and produced highly efficient PSCs with record breaking PCE values, as shown in Fig. 1a.7,23

Li–TFSI/t-BP-based dopant system enhanced the efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC from an inferior value of 3.8% to a remarkable value of 9.7%.24,25 The advantage of Li–TFSI/t-BP is evident in that it can significantly improve the conductivity and mobility of the HTL and accordingly improve the performance of PSC. However, the doping mechanism of Li–TFSI/t-BP25–27 (Fig. 1b and c) indicate that these bi-dopants pose threat to the long-term operational stability of PSCs due to the following reasons: (1) doping by-product LixOy increases the hydrophilicity of the HTL, initiating the decomposition of the perovskite in ambient conditions; (2) hydrophilic Li–TFSI increases the hydrophobicity of the HTM; (3) migration of Li+ produces hysteresis; (4) t-BP has a relatively low boiling point (197 °C)28 due to which it evaporates at a different rate than other component solvents, which leads to the appearance of pinholes in the film, providing channels for oxygen and moisture intrusion and ion migration; (5) the doping process is uncontrollable due to the need of ambient air for the oxidation of the dopant. Fortunately, both co-doping Li–TFSI/t-BP by adding oxidizers and modifying Li–TFSI/t-BP by a specific substance is a viable solution to solve the above-mentioned problems. Fundamentally, the chemical properties depend on the featured structure of the molecule.29 Even a minor alteration in the molecular structure of the dopants, such as same cation with various functional groups or different ligands and same combined groups with diverse cations, can affect the photovoltaic performance and the long-term stability of PSCs positively.30,31 Hence, to overcome the problems of conventional dopants, various research approaches have been proposed.
In this review, we systematically outlined the recent advances employed for the modification of conventional Li–TFSI/t-BP doping systems, and these strategies have been classified according to the particular problem they address. Specifically, the modification method of Li–TFSI/t-BP and the strategy to develop novel co-dopants have been discussed. In addition, selecting different doping methods has a positive effect regarding the problems posed by the bi-doping system; hence, here for reference we had. Lastly, we have drawn an outlook for future work in this field, which will inspire other researchers to devote their research efforts in this field (Fig. 2).

2. Modification of Li–TFSI/t-BP
(1) Modified Li–TFSI
The migration of Li+ is a matter of prime concern since unoxidized Li+ with small radius and large diffusion length migrates throughout the layers of the PSCs (Fig. 3a), causing serious damage and hysteresis.32 For example, it reacts with lead halide in the perovskite layer,33,34 though it has been reported that the accumulation of Li+ in TiO2 is favorable for electron injection into the electron-transporting layers (ETL).35,36 In addition, TFSI− anion stabilizes spiro-OMeTAD˙+ radical cation through electrostatic interaction and plays an important role in promoting the oxidation reaction of spiro-OMeTAD.27 Thus, the study on the modification of TFSI− is essential to explore and control its impact on the perovskite layer. In this section, we will discuss the different efforts made by researchers to tackle these problems.

(d) The proposed structure of this work, where CNTs are used as top electrodes and as filters for [Li+@C60]TFSI−, (e) the effect of reaction time on the antioxidant capacity and the concentration of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD,38 copyright 2019, American Chemical Society. 
Generally, the physical or chemical properties of a complex can be modified by the admixture. To solve the problems of small radius and swift migration of Li+, a strategy was proposed to encapsulate Li+ with larger volume materials. In 2018, Jeon et al. reported a method to tackle the aforementioned problems by locking Li+ in the fullerene cage (Fig. 3b).37 As a result, PSCs based on [Li+@C60]TFSI− achieves 10-fold stability as compared to traditional Li–TFSI/t-BP-doped PSCs (Table 1). They attributed this outcome to the larger volume and slow migration of Li+@C60 and the presence of a hydrophobic fullerene cage. Moreover, unlike Li–TFSI, [Li+@C60]TFSI− shows enough redox ability to instantly react with spiro-OMeTAD without oxygen. In addition, UV/Vis-NIR absorption spectrum depicts the generation of Li+@C60−, which indicates the electron transfer between spiro-OMeTAD and [Li+@C60]TFSI− (Fig. 3c). Moreover, spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite, which are vulnerable to deterioration by photo-oxidation or intruding oxygen, can be protected by antioxidation [Li+@C60]TFSI− due to the many double bonds on fullerene posing as the potential oxidation sites (Fig. 3b). These two processes are shown by the equations in Table 2. Although the PSC (based on [Li+@C60]TFSI−) showed superior long-term stability, its PCE was much lower than that of the Li–TFSI-based device due to the poor solubility of [Li+@C60]TFSI− and the aggregation of [Li+@C60]˙− in HTL, with champion PCE values of 16.8% and 18.5% for both, respectively. Apparently, high efficiency comes at the cost of reduced stability. In fact, the appearance of this phenomenon is actually related to the low solubility of [Li+@C60]TFSI−. To address this issue, in 2019, a follow-up study was published. The additive carbon nanotube (CNT) lamination, which functioned as a natural filter for endohedral metallofullerene aggregations and played a decisive role in enhancing the efficiency.38 CNT addition effectively reduced the aggregation of [Li+@C60]TFSI− in the HTL, resulting in a smoother charge transportation and also replaced the metal electrode (Fig. 3d), ultimately achieving a higher efficiency than that of Li–TFSI-doped PSCs (17.2% vs. 16.9%). The optimal reaction time of spiro-OMeTAD with [Li+@C60]TFSI− was 2 h after the addition of CNT, which shows that the inclusion of additional additives has a positive impact on the doping performance of the original dopant system (Fig. 3e).

Later, Priya et al. reported a new dopant, endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) Sc3N@C80.39 The hydrophobicity and oxidation properties of the molecule ensured improved efficiency and stability of the device, simultaneously (Fig. 4a). In addition, this type of materials is tunable; by encapsulating different metal salts, the desired properties can be obtained. Thus, EMFs hold tremendous potential for developing novel dopants.40 In 2022, Fan et al. proposed a new strategy to avoid ion migration by encapsulating Li–TFSI in a metal–organic framework (MOF), composed of Li–TFSI endohedral MOF (namely Li–TFSI@NH2-MIL-101), is constructed.41 Although the efficiency of the PSCs based on Li–TFSI@NH2-MIL-101 (19.01%) remained comparable to that of Li–TFSI (19.23%), the role of the modified molecular structure in enhancing the device stability is significant (Fig. 4b). However, according to our knowledge of the doping mechanism of Li–TFSI, Li+ reacts with O2˙−, which promotes the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD. However, the description of whether a similar effect exists after the formation of Li–TFSI@NH2-MIL-101 is unexplored. But all in all, MOF and carbon materials mentioned above have a significant role in improving the device stability (Fig. 4c–e), which is associated with the nature of such materials.

All the above mentioned methods are designed to inhibit migration by immobilizing Li+ in advance through chemical synthesis. Later, Jiang et al. reported the physical adsorption of Li+, thereby inhibiting its migration between the layers.42 After introducing flower-like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the device stability improved because the large specific surface area of MoS2 can work as a powerful sorbent of Li+ (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, MoS2 can realize effective p-type doping of spiro-OMeTAD, analyzed on the basis of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, which can evaluate the charge states among different molecules. Consequently, high carrier-mobility and conductivity was obtained by efficient charge transfer. Hence, the efficiency (20.18% versus 17.79% for Li–TFSI/t-BP-doped PSCs) and stability (85% of the original efficiency was maintained after 300 h ambient exposure without encapsulation) (Table 1) were improved simultaneously. The inorganic compound MoS2 enhances the crystallinity of spiro-OMeTAD, thereby improving the stability of organic amorphous films. These findings are consistent with the conclusion of previous studies, which proved that the instability and aggregation problems of organic films can be solved with the addition of inorganic materials.43–50

Carbon-based materials play a vital role in enhancing the stability of PSCs.40 In 2015, Luo et al. employed the p-type carbon material rGO to modify the HTL.51 rGO is known due to its favorable conductivity, facile modification, and cost-effective fabrication. rGO-doped spiro-OMeTAD devices achieved a maximum PCE of 10.6%, which is significantly higher than that of dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD devices (6.5%). The performance improvement is attributed to the following special roles of rGO in the HTL: (1) extracting holes from the perovskite layer and transferring them to the electrode; (2) acts as a bridge for hole transportation between the Au electrode and the HTL. Fig. 5b illustrates that rGO is islanded on the perovskite surface, while HTL shows a slightly convex appearance, which firmly contacts with the back electrode and facilitates hole transport. Afterward, Guo et al. explored another role played by rGO in Li–TFSI/t-BP-doped spiro-OMeTAD.52 The presence of defects on rGO can provide adsorption sites for Li+, which can effectively inhibit the migration of Li+; meanwhile, there is also a bonding interaction between Li+ and rGO, which may have an inhibitory effect on the following deleterious water absorption reactions (Fig. 5c). Moreover, the addition of rGO does not damage the structural morphology of spiro-OMeTAD, as illustrated by atomic force microscopy (Fig. 5d); hence, the resultant PSC exhibited a PCE of 19.3% with a negligible hysteresis. After being placed in a relative humidity of 40% for 700 h, it still maintained 97% of the initial PCE, which ultimately allows the device to have a stable and efficient output in ambient conditions (Table 1).
Wang et al. proposed a novel chemical absorption strategy to overcome the aggregation of Li–TFSI.53 By doping antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) nanoparticles into the spiro-OMeTAD together with t-BP and Li–TFSI as the additives, the efficiency and stability (after 85 h of continuous light aging at 25 °C and 1100 h under 25 °C in an ambient environment over 97% of the initial PCE retained) of the device were simultaneously enhanced due to the chemically favorable nature of Sb2S3 (Table 1). For instance, when Sb2S3 interacts with spiro-OMeTAD, a new chemical bond (S–H) is formed between the two compounds (Fig. 5e and f), leading to a significant increase in the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. Meanwhile, the results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments show that Li–TFSI and Sb2S3 can combine to form a Li–S bond, thus inhibiting the aggregation of Li–TFSI (Fig. 5g). Furthermore, interfacial bonding calculations at the Sb2S3/perovskite interface further indicate that S and Sb in Sb2S3 are bonded to Pb and halogens (I, Br) in the perovskite layer (Fig. 5h); thus, Sb2S3 can passivate the surface defects. Unambiguously, S atom plays an important role in this doping, which is consistent with an earlier study.54 Recently, Shen et al. employed crown ether (12-crown-4) in spiro-OMeTAD:Li–TFSI/t-BP,55 which effectively inhibited ion migration by chemical coordination. Meanwhile, 12-crown-4 effectively dissolves Li–TFSI by the following coordination reaction: Li–TFSI + 12-crown-4 → Li(12-crown-4)+ + TFSI−; thus, polar solvents such as acetonitrile are no longer needed. Although the efficiency (Table 2) and stability (Table 1) were remarkably improved with the support of 12-crown-4, TOF-SIMS results showed that a minute portion of the Li+ signal was still detected in the SnO2 layer after the addition of crown ether (Fig. 5i). The host–guest interaction between Li+ and 12-crown-4 allows the migration of Li+ to be mitigated but not completely inhibited. The addition of 12-crown-4 partially solves the problems of the Li–TFSI/t-BP system, and unlike the previously mentioned Li+@C60, the ion migration problem still exists. In conclusion, the interaction between the dopant and host played an important role in the carrier transport process. The molecular stacking formed by bonding also has a profound effect on film morphology and electron transport.56
It is obvious that the major reason for Li–TFSI aggregation is the hydrophilicity of Li–TFSI; thus, to solve this issue Wu et al. modulated the anion structure of Li–TFSI.57 Fluorine atoms play a fundamental role in enhancing the hydrophobicity of molecules. Besides, according to a previous study, fluorine can effectively passivate the interfacial defects.58 By changing the number of fluorine atoms, Li–TFSI derivatives were synthesized (2F for Li–FSI, 6F for Li–TFSI, and 10F for Li–PFSI) (Fig. 6a). The dopant Li–PFSI containing the highest fluorine atoms showed superior performance and thermal stability (Fig. 6b) due to improved film morphology (Fig. 6c). Interestingly, the work from Park et al. showed different results59 (Fig. 6d–f). The excessive fluorine atoms affect the doping properties and film quality, mainly stemming from the increase in the hydrophobic groups, which leads to weakened molecular dispersion force with spiro-OMeTAD. The modulation of the anion structure weakens the properties of the anion, such as the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity and intensity of electrostatic interactions with spiro-OMeTAD˙+, leading to diverse device performance.

(2) Modification of t-BP

t-BP mainly serves to enhance the solubility of Li–TFSI in non-polar solvent chlorobenzene (CB), thus inhibiting Li–TFSI phase separation and contributing to the growth of a uniform HTL.60 Furthermore, the addition of t-BP can improve the film quality as it can form Li–TFSI/t-BP complexes (Fig. 7a), thus reducing the aggregation of Li–TFSI; hence the varied concentration of t-BP generates different device performances60 (Fig. 7b). However, the problems caused by t-BP cannot be ignored. For example, the evaporation of t-BP in the PSC device produces pinholes in the HTL61 and the reaction between t-BP and PbI2 destroys the perovskite layer.62 For the additive such as t-BP corroding perovskite within the cell, the threat to long-term stability is even greater, making it necessary to tune their structure.

(f) Molecular structure of N3 and the schematic mechanism for the effects of N3 on PSCs,66 copyright 2022, Elsevier. (g) The structure of TFP and its photovoltaic performance,67 copyright 2021, Elsevier. 
The formation of new complexes of t-BP with PbI2 destroys perovskite. To solve this issue, in 2016, Lewis-base pyridine derivatives (pyridine, 4-py: 4-amylpyridine, and 2-py: 2-amylpyridine) were reported as substitutes for t-BP by Yue et al. (Fig. 7c).63 2-py, which has a long alkyl chain at the o-position (a large space steric hindrance), leaves no corrosive effects on perovskite (Fig. 7d). In addition, near the nitrogen atom, the alkyl chain can reduce the coordination ability of pyridine, thus inhibiting the reaction with metallic lead ions. Meanwhile, the solubility of 2-py to Li–TFSI is stronger than that of the conventional additive t-BP, which helps to enhance the doping effect. Thus, the stability and efficiency of PSCs improved remarkably (Table 1). Later, Liu et al. utilized the reaction of t-BP with PbI2. Their approach was based on the addition of PbI2 to Li–TFSI/t-BP-doped spiro-OMeTAD to control the evaporation of t-BP and aggregation of Li–TFSI simultaneously, thus avoiding the generation of pinholes in HTL and obtaining a finer HTL (Fig. 7e), which ultimately achieved a PCE of 20.3%.64 The XRD measurements and the Gibbs free energy calculated by DFT analysis demonstrated that strong interactions can occur between PbI2 and t-BP, which effectively inhibit the evaporation of t-BP and form high-quality thin films. On the other hand, the long-term stability of PSCs is reduced by unreacted PbI2 according to Tumen-Ulzii et al.65 The reason is that PbI2 is photolyzed into metallic Pb and I2 under light illumination, and the resulting metallic Pb acts as a quencher of carriers and gradually decreases the PCE. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, Liu et al. verified that small amounts of PbI2 can form passivation layers at the perovskite/HTM interface, thus reducing the defect states. However, the effect of excess PbI2 on the long-term operational stability of PSCs needs further exploration. Soon after, 1,6-diazidohexane (N3) was reported by Han et al.66 N3 stabilizes Li–TFSI and t-BP in the HTL (Fig. 7f) and accelerates the oxidation process of spiro-OMeTAD, while the passivation of the perovskite surface yielded an efficiency of 22.7%. Moreover, after 900 h continuous illumination in N2 glovebox, about 91% of the initial PCE was retained (Table 1). In short, t-BP contains nitrogen atom, and the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen acts as the Lewis base, which can effectively inhibit the volatilization of t-BP by interacting with the Lewis acid.
The hydrophilic nature of the Li–TFSI/t-BP bi-doping system is not suitable for enhancing the long-term stability of PCSs. Based on this, Zhu et al. modified t-BP by replacing the methyl with trifluoromethyl, resulting in 4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (TFP), which improved the hydrophobicity of HTL (Fig. 7g).67 The introduction of F atom enhances the hydrophobic properties of the molecule, which in turn improves the stability (Table 1); these results are consistent with the previous studies on F atom in PSCs.68–70
In summary, although several studies have been carried out to address the stability problems associated with the Li–TFSI/t-BP system doped with spiro-OMeTAD, only some of the problems associated with this system have been addressed. The problems caused by Li+, t-BP, and the oxygen doping process need further exploration.
3. Co-doping of Li–TFSI/t-BP
To promote the commercialization of PSCs, reproducible and stable fabrication process is essential. In the conventional spiro-OMeTAD oxidation process, oxygen is used as a p-type dopant, making the process time-consuming and largely dependent on the environmental conditions, which cannot ensure enough reproducibility. To solve the issues caused by the presence of ambient air, alternative dopants are needed (Table 3).

(1) Inorganic compound
In 2012, Grätzel et al. further improved the efficiency of PSCs using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM and Li–TFSI/t-BP as the dopant.25 During the doping process, Li–TFSI functions as an additive to facilitate the oxidation reaction of spiro-OMeTAD with oxygen. Obviously, without the participation of oxygen, Li–TFSI cannot act as a direct oxidant to produce spiro-OMeTAD˙+. One year later, a further improvement in the efficiency was achieved by employing cobalt-based complex FK209 as the oxygen substituent by Seok et al.71 Utilizing the synergistic effect of the cobalt-based complex and Li–TFSI on spiro-OMeTAD, the PCE increased from 9.7% to 10.4%. FK209 possesses superior oxidation potential (1.06 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) than spiro-OMeTAD (0.72 V vs. NHE) (Table 3). Theoretically, it means effective charge transfer between FK209 and the host, which yields higher concentration of the hole carriers, which is highly desirable. In addition, they found that FK209 plays a vital role in enhancing the VOC due to the reduction in the carrier recombination and the lower Fermi level of HTM. Notably, the absorption peak at 520 nm in the absorption spectra originates from the oxidized spiro-OMeTAD cation radical, while in the case of equal amount of KF209 doping, the further addition of Li–TFSI/t-BP has a decreasing trend of its spiro-OMeTAD˙+ concentration, which shows a decrease in the intensity of the peak. Meanwhile, the devices based on the FK209/Li–TFSI/t-BP co-doping system showed higher efficiency. Whether the special interaction between FK209 and Li–TFSI is responsible for this phenomenon needs further discussion. In addition to FK209, another cobalt-based complex has been reported for spiro-OMeTAD doping, such as FK102 and FK269 (Fig. 8a).72 Moreover, copper-based complexes73 and iridium-based complexes74 have also been reported for increasing the conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD. However, copper-based complexes are easy to synthesize and are more economical. Zhang et al. reported three copper-based complexes (JQ1, JQ2, and JQ3) (Fig. 8b) for the doping of spiro-OMeTAD.75 All three, JQ1, JQ2, and JQ3, showed high ΔV with spiro-OMeTAD, i.e., 90 mV, 190 mV, and 360 mV, respectively. This phenomenon can effectively promote the oxidation process (Table 3) and thus induce a higher doping level of spiro-OMeTAD. In conclusion, the redox potential of the dopant is vital to quantify the doping efficiency and conductivity of HTM. Moreover, the redox potential of the coordination compounds can be regulated by the ligands;73 thus, it is feasible to develop novel co-dopants from them.

To accelerate the commercialization of PSCs, it is desirable to develop cost-effective dopants. According to Gu et al., the inorganic compound FeCl3 is an inexpensive dopant that can be used as an alternative for the cobalt-based complex to oxidize spiro-MeTAD.76 The more positive redox potential of FeCl3 (Fe3+/Fe2+ (NHE, 0.771 V)) vs. (spiro-OMeTAD˙+/spiro-OMeTAD (NHE, 0.63 V)) helps to predict the occurrence of the oxidation reaction thermodynamically. Unsurprisingly, the device based on spiro-OMeTAD showed more than 17% PCE due to the improved hole-transporting ability. Repeatedly, spiro-OMeTAD doped by tri-dopant FeCl3/Li–TFSI/t-BP exhibited better performance as compared to bi-dopant Li–TFSI/t-BP. Perhaps it is the inherent nature of FeCl3 that makes further research on the long-term stability of the device inadequate. Afterward, Wang et al. utilized vanadic oxide (V2O5) as a dopant, where the replacement of oxygen can be realized as well.77 According to the obtained results, it was inferred that owing to the high oxidation ability of V2O5, the time of oxidation was significantly shortened. The chemical reactions involved in this process are shown in Table 3. In addition, V2O5 is insoluble in water, and devices doped with it maintain 90% of their initial efficiency when left in ambient conditions (RH = 40%) for 30 days (Table 1). Moreover, devices based on Li–TFSI/t-BP/V2O5 exhibited optimal performance (20.5%) as compared to devices based on Li–TFSI/t-BP/O2 (18.22%) and Li–TFSI/t-BP/KF209 (19.16%), which indicate that V2O5 played a more significant role in efficiency improvement than O2 and KF209. KMnO4, which has strong oxidizing properties, can also achieve the substitution of oxygen.78 In addition, MnO4−/Mn2+ (NHE, 1.51 V) has a higher redox potential than spiro-OMeTAD˙+/spiro-OMeTAD (NHE, 0.63 V), thus providing sufficient thermodynamic drive for the following reactions. KMnO4 has a high oxidation capacity and its optimal doping ratio in spiro-OMeTAD is 1%. When the doping ratio increases to 2%, the photovoltaic performance of the device decreases abruptly (Fig. 8c). The products Mn2+ and spiro-OMeTAD˙+ can be used as p-type dopants to improve the conductivity of HTL. Meanwhile, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements illustrate that although Mn2+ can penetrate the perovskite layer, migration does not have any deleterious effect on the morphology of the perovskite layer (Fig. 8d). In contrast, it acts as a dopant for the perovskite layer to enhance its optical and electrical properties.79,80 Undoubtedly, the rapid oxidation process of KMnO4 can effectively avoid any damage of Li–TFSI by the air oxidation process and fulfills the adequate stability requirements essential for smooth and efficient functioning of the device. Meanwhile, KMnO4-doped devices exhibit decent stability (Table 1); hence, an efficiency of 20.03% was achieved. Subsequently, Sun et al. reported another strong oxidizing agent K2S2O8.81 Compared to the above dopants, K2S2O8 possesses the strongest oxidizing ability (Table 3); however, its optimal doping concentration is 31.4 mol%. It is different from the pattern exhibited by the previously mentioned dopants, i.e., the stronger the oxidizing capacity, the lower the doping concentration. Due to the solubility of K2S2O8 in water, it has limited effect on improving the device stability (Table 1). In 2017, Liu et al. reported an organic oxidant (benzoyl peroxide (BPO)) (Fig. 8e).82 The presence of peroxides facilitates the spiro-OMeTAD oxidation reaction (Table 3).
In fact, several similar studies on CuSCN/CuI,43 SnCl4,83 SOCl2,84 and other oxidants have been reported successively, which also acts a co-dopant of spiro-OMeTAD in the presence of Li–TFSI/t-BP. However, we have to consider not only their oxidizing properties but also their hydrophobicity while selecting inorganic compound co-dopants to achieve both higher efficiency and stability. Moreover, to solve the problem of poor reproducibility of spiro-OMeTAD oxidation in air, Ma et al. proposed the pre-oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD by introducing oxygen into the solution (Fig. 9a).85 Although this method makes the process more controllable, it still contains the product LixOy and Li+. Hence, the improvement of the stability of the device by this method is not significant enough.

Recently, Kong et al. reported CO2 bubbling doping in spiro-OMeTAD/Li–TFSI/t-BP;86 the addition of CO2 not only caused better performance than the original dopant system but also better stability, and more importantly, the method is stable and reproducible with good generalization for doping π-conjugated HTM. Superior device performance and stability can be inferred from the fact that CO2 doping obtains a more stable product, Li2CO3 and C, and Li2CO3 is more stable in air without deliquescence compared to Li2O, which is prone to moisture absorption. Besides, during the CO2-bubbling process, the free Li+ are converted into Li2CO3, a white precipitate, so that the excess harmful Li+ can be removed, thus improving the reliability of the device. However, during the gas bubbling process, due to the limited solubility of CO2 in CB, it is essential to continuously pass CO2 through spiro-OMeTAD:Li–TFSI, which results in low CO2 utilization. Unquestionably, this method is effective; it maybe possible to further use some additives in this system to enhance the utilization of CO2. Recently, Wu et al. employed CoF3 as a p-type dopant to effectively pre-oxidize spiro-OMeTAD.87 Due to the discrepancy in the solubility between the dopant and the host, the doping reaction occurs at the solid/liquid interface, and excess reactant CoF3 and products CoF2 and LiF can be filtered out (Fig. 9b). The optimal PCE for PSCs using HTL doped with CoF3 was 23.05%, accompanied by decent stability (Table 1). Undoubtedly, the dopant concentration affects the doping effect (Fig. 9c), but for interfacial doping, the duration of the doping reaction also has a great influence, and the reaction end-point is distinguishable.
In summary, certainly the abovementioned inorganic oxidants can replace the air oxidation process. However, it is obvious that most of the oxidants can only partially solve the problems of the Li–TFSI/t-BP doping system. Also, a small number of oxidants are hydrophilic and cannot effectively establish a protective layer for PSCs. Only a few oxidants such as CO2 and CoF3 can solve the problem of Li+ migration without additional oxidation.
(2) MOF-based materials
The hydrophobicity of HTL is essential for the protection of PSCs, especially in the n–i–p structure. Dopants with better hydrophobicity can effectively enhance the ambient stability of HTL. MOF composites are porous materials with high surface area and porosity, containing thousands of different structures, and an abundance of designable organic ligands and metal nodes.88,89 In addition, the advantages of softness, thermal and chemical stability, and tunable hydrophobicity facilitate the excessive usage of MOF.90
In 2019, Li et al. published research on MOF materials.91 With the synergistic effect of [In0.5K(3-qlc)Cl1.5(H2O)0.5]2n (In10) (Fig. 10a) and Li–TFSI/t-BP, PSCs obtained PCE of 17% (14% for Li–TFSI/t-BP-doped devices). Meanwhile, solid UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of In10 indicated that In10 can convert the ultraviolet radiations into visible light (Fig. 10d). Normally, we think that the lower HOMO energy of the dopant is more favorable for the transfer of electrons obtained from the host. For example, F4-TCNQ and other dopants endorses this phenomenon.92 The HOMO of In10 is slightly higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (Table 3), which is probably the reason why the doped devices are less efficient. Afterward, a highly stable MOF {[Zn(Hcbob)]·(solvent)}n (Zn-CBOB) (Fig. 10b) with rod-like topology and Lewis base sites were reported for co-doping by the same group.93 It is worth noting that the HOMO energy of Zn-CBOB (−5.25 eV) is lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.12 eV), which is theoretically favorable for the transfer of electrons from the host to the dopant; the possible equations are as follows (Table 3). The presence of Lewis base sites, such as carbonyl (CO) group, can facilitate the passivation of Pb2+ defects at the HTL/perovskite interface. Consequently, a remarkable PCE of 20.64% can be achieved. The enhanced hydrophobic properties brought about by the special structure also contribute to the stability of the device (Table 1). Notably, owing to the special structure of Zn-CBOB, it can convert ultraviolet into visible light (Fig. 10e). It is known that radiations accelerate the degradation of the perovskite layer, and materials that can absorb UV light can play a protective role in this regard, on the basis of research study conducted by Song et al.94 Meanwhile, research on such materials is still in progress. For example, Zhou et al. synthesized Fe(III) ion-grafted metal–organic complexes (Fe(III) ⊂ MOCs) (Fig. 10c)95 and obtained a remarkable efficiency (20.46%) and improved stability (Table 1) (Fig. 10f).

Furthermore Fan et al. reported a new dopant96 known as H4PMo11V·nH2O (denoted as PMo11V), a kind of Keggin-type polyoxometalates (POMs) (Fig. 11a). In general, POMs can act as an electron accepter in the chemical reaction, and it can be an effective p-type dopant even in the absence of light and oxygen. When Li–TFSI and PMo11V were co-doped into spiro-OMeTAD, the efficiency was significantly enhanced, the champion efficiency of Li–TFSI and Li–TFSI/PMo11V-based PSC devices were 10.77% and 14.05%, respectively. Also, these results indicated that the incorporation of PMo11V generates a synergistic effect between the dopants, such as the combination of FK209 and Li–TFSI. Furthermore, PSCs with Li–TFSI/PMo11V-doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibit a good reproducibility in the J–V performance. Since the POMs have an excellent oxidation activity, high stability, strong catalytic oxidation activity, and variety of substituents,97 it is worthy to develop an optimal one to boost the performance of PSCs. Nonetheless, although POMs can directly oxidize spiro-OMeTAD, it can easily transform into agglomeration and disordered arrangements, leading to decreased oxidation capabilities of POMs and instability of PSCs. To overcome this issue, an in-depth study was conducted by Fan et al.,98 and an efficient hybrid polyoxometalate@metal–organic framework (POM@MOF) material was reported. When [Cu2(BTC)4/3(H2O)2]6[H3PMo12O40]2 (denoted as POM@Cu–BTC) (Fig. 11b) was combined with Li–TFSI/t-BP to co-doped spiro-OMeTAD, it showed a high efficiency (21.44%) with superior fill factor (0.8) as well as long term stability. After incorporating Cu3(BTC)2, the oxidant POMs uniformly distributed in the entire porous mesh structure; thus, its aggregation can be partly avoided. Meanwhile, the moisture stability of the device also improved due to the nanoporous structure of the Cu–BTC framework (Fig. 11c) (Table 1). Subsequently, they further studied the new dopant to find out whether it has the same strong oxidizing ability and co-doping ability as polyoxometalate–PMo11V. Firstly, by comparing the color of the HTM solution with different dopants, they proved the discrepancy in the oxidation ability between Li–TFSI/POM@Cu–BTC and Li–TFSI. To further investigate, the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) clarify the electron transfer between spiro-OMeTAD and POM@Cu–BTC, and meanwhile, combined with the energy levels diagram, a feasible oxidation mechanism was proposed. These studies manifest that polyoxometalates are promising category of oxidative dopants and the structural properties of MOF can modulate the properties of the doping system to obtain the desired properties. Recently, a method to achieve the controlled oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD by modulating the mass loading of H3PMo12O40 in porphyrin-based MOF-545 (P@M) has been reported (Fig. 11f).99 P@M not only have the same properties as the previously reported POM–MOF materials (e.g., porous structure, high stability, and oxidation properties), but also acts as a spider web to sequester Pb2+ ions (Fig. 11f). Meanwhile, polyoxometalates are class of materials with three-dimensional porous structure, highly charged metal ions (e.g., Mo6+ and W6+), and abundant functional groups (e.g., PO43−, MoO42−), which have great potential for development.100,101

(f) The schematic of the positive effects of P@M on the efficiency and stability of devices,99 copyright 2022, Elsevier. 
Fan's group then conducted further research on the application of these two materials in spiro-OMeTAD. For example, Fan et al. reported a POM,102 namely, [Cu(phen)2]2[(α-Mo8O26)] (CMP) (Fig. 11d). [Cu(phen)2]2+ connects with [(α-Mo8O26)]4− by a single Cu–O bond, while the copper atom is connected to two ligands, where this structure facilitates π–π stacking between adjacent clusters, thus promoting carrier transmission (Fig. 11e). Meanwhile, electron transfer between the N of spiro-OMeTAD and the Mo of CMP achieves the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD.
In summary, the co-doping strategy describes an efficient way to improve the efficiency as well as stability of PSCs. In fact, good results were achieved by co-doping, stemming from the joint action of TFSI− and the applied oxidant, which was used for generating spiro-OMeTAD˙+, while TFSI− was used to stabilize spiro-OMeTAD˙+. Moreover, the dopant that can substitute the oxygen and presence with Li–TFSI altogether generate a synergistic effect should fulfill the following criteria: (1) contain appropriate oxidation potential; (2) work together with Li–TFSI/t-BP without any extra influence between them; (3) possess strong hydrophobicity to inhibit moisture protection of HTM; (4) the ability to inhibit the migration of Li+ is also essential.
(3) Catalyst in spiro-OMeTAD oxidation process
As mentioned above, Li–TFSI facilitates the reaction between spiro-OMeTAD and oxygen, but this process is largely dependent on the exposure time of the device in ambient air. Zhu et al. reported an acidic additive, namely, H3PO4, for optimizing the Li–TFSI/t-BP bi-doping system.103 Surprisingly, they found that H3PO4 can catalyze the oxidation process of spiro-OMeTAD in the presence of alkali metal salts, while itself cannot dope spiro-OMeTAD; the corresponding equation is as follows (Table 3). Intriguingly, the addition of H3PO4 did not significantly change the Fermi-level (Ef) position or ionization energies (IE) of spiro-OMeTAD, indicating that the acid does not significantly change the charge carrier concentration in spiro-OMeTAD but exhibits better conductivity (Fig. 12a). 1HNMR experiments were performed to find out the existence of hydrogen bonding interactions between the acid and spiro-OMeTAD and proposed a likely mechanism (Fig. 12b), which can further improve the HTL conductivity by delocalizing electrons in spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast to the previous study conducted by Abate et al., H3PO4 cannot act like H–TFSI to produce protonated spiro-OMeTAD, which can oxidize pristine spiro-OMeTAD;104 even H3PO4 and H–TFSI can be classified into Brønsted acid featuring proton generation. The possible explanation can be attributed to the variety of acid strength, for example, H3PO4 is a mild acid while H–TFSI is a super acid; hence, under their influence spiro-OMeTAD with different degrees of protonation appeared. Furthermore, they also investigated various acids such as H2SO4, AcOH, and CF3PAH, each of them having different counter-anions and different acidity. However, their findings are consistent with H3PO4, although they have one thing in common, the ability to produce protons, and both showed improved charge conduction in HTLs.

Recently, benzoic acid (BA) has been reported for its application as a dopant in spiro-OMeTAD, and as in previous studies, it can catalyze the oxidation process of spiro-OMeTAD.105 Besides, the reaction product LiBA can reduce the size of the pores in spiro-OMeTAD film, thus improving the morphology of the films. In spiro-OMeTAD films, LiBA is present in the form of particles that sink during the film formation process; thus, compressing makes the surrounding pores smaller and finally achieved a PCE of 16.26% as compared to 14.83% for the devices without BA addition. The chemical equation involved in this process is tabulated (Table 3).
4. Doping method
The degree of doping reaction is an important criterion to evaluate the doping performance of dopants. It is important to know that not only the nature of the dopant itself will affect the doping reaction, the impact of solvent on the reaction cannot be ignored. In the bi-doping system of Li–TFSI/t-BP, Li–TFSI is similar to most salts in nature, with certain properties and solubility in polar solvents. Thus, acetonitrile is often needed to dissolve the Li–TFSI, but the addition of excessive acetonitrile damages the perovskite layer.106 On the other hand, a small amount of acetonitrile causes Li–TFSI precipitation in the process of film formation. Finally, the aggregation of Li–TFSI makes the film formation inhomogeneous, thus expanding the invasion channel for humidity, which accelerates the degradation of the perovskite.107 Furthermore, the solubility of the doping reaction products not only restricts the formation of homogeneous films but also affects the doping level because many doping reactions are reversible and cannot be fully implemented. It has been shown that the device properties changed when t-BP is paired with Li–TFSI in different ratios.60 The solubility of lithium salt in CB is limited, and the addition of t-BP plays a role in promoting the solubility, but the polarity of t-BP will have a negative effect on the perovskite layer. Thus, we inevitably have the following doubt: is the doping ratio used now optimal? Therefore, in this section, we summarize the common doping methods to provide insights into the selection of suitable doping methods for different systems, thus promoting the doping reaction and improving the doping efficiency.
Common solution-processed doping methods can be divided into two categories—first is host-dopant mixing-doping and second is post-fabrication doping methods. Obviously, the doping method of co-mingling is limited by the choice of the solvent; for example, in the n–i–p structure, the HTL is located on top of the perovskite layer, and to reduce the influence of the solution on the perovskite layer during the post-spin coating process, we usually choose a non-polar or less polar solvent such as CB or tetrahydrofuran to dissolve the HTM.108 At the same time, for effective doping, the dopant is expected to be compatible with the solvent of the HTM. Though the post-fabrication doping method uses the swelling effect to ensure dopant penetration into the solid film, this method can achieve gradient doping.109–111 Nonetheless, it is not easy to control the quantitative doping of the specified layer, and processing may damage other layers, which is a major obstacle in this method.
To solve the problems raised above, many innovative doping methods have been proposed. Yamashita et al. proposed an anion exchange doping method to promote the doping reaction.112 Firstly, the dopant F4-TCNQ interacts with the host PBTTT to initiate the initial hole production, and this doping process integrates the electron transfer process accompanied by the generation of ion pairs. At a given doping concentration, there is an equilibrium in the reaction, and the reaction system always proceeds in the direction of obtaining a lower Gibbs free energy. Therefore, by means of liquid–solid (film) contact, the anions in the ionic liquid replaces the F4-TCNQ−, disrupting the equilibrium and promoting the forward doping reaction, thus effectively increasing the doping level, while the residual ions can be completely removed by ethanol. The researchers selected the ionic liquids on the basis of HSAB theory, controlling the size of the selected anions and cations to obtain the optimal ion exchange efficiency. Another doping by liquid–solid (dopant) contact occurs in the process of preparing the hole precursor solution. Wu et al. achieved the doping reaction at the solid–liquid interface using the insolubility of CoF3 in the spiro-OMeTAD:Li–TFSI mixture. The reactants CoF3, products CoF2 and LiF are insoluble in CB; thus, the unrequired material is removed by filtration.
The core of post-fabrication doping is the adequate contact between the liquid–solid film, but this method also has a high requirement for the choice of the solvent, and the doping solution should effectively infiltrate the film surface and swelling should occur to achieve effective doping. To solve this problem, the liquid surface contact doping method was reported by Sun et al.113 It is not limited by the incompatibility of dopant and host solvent, and in the liquid state, it must be allowed to move freely between interfaces, which enhances the contact between the dopant and the host and facilitates doping. To increase the contact to make the doping more effective, Lee et al. proposed a vapor-assisted doping method.114 In short, doping methods can be mainly divided into liquid–liquid contact, liquid–solid contact, and gas–solid contact.
5. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, we focused on the progress made by the Li–TFSI/t-BP bi-doping system in spiro-OMeTAD for PSCs. Mainly, the modifications of Li–TFSI anions, the modifications of t-BP, and the optimization of the spiro-OMeTAD oxidation process by researchers to overcome the uncontrollable problems in this process are discussed.
From the above summary, we can conclude that the improvement strategy of the system is based on the following problems: (1) migration and aggregation of Li+, which is mainly due to its small ionic radius and weak electrostatic interaction with other components. The main method is to use materials with pore structure and large specific surface area, such as MOF, carbon materials, and others to stabilize Li+. In addition, using materials that can form chemical interactions with Li+, in general, Li–O and Li–S are relatively stable chemical bonds. Further, the excess Li+ is removed by precipitate generation (LiF, Li2CO3) during HTL solution preparation. However, it should be clear that we modify the HTL for the purpose of improving its ability to the transport holes. Therefore, the conductivity should be considered in the selection of adsorbent materials, considering whether their addition has a negative impact on the doping reaction, whether they have an impact on the HTL morphology, etc.
(2) t-BP has volatilization problems during subsequent placement, leading to the formation of pinholes. There are relatively few studies on t-BP, and the general opinion is that t-BP has a non-negligible role in fabricating films with good homogeneity. The study we mentioned earlier shows that t-BP contains N atoms, and due to the presence of lone pair of electrons on N, it can effectively slow down the volatilization of t-BP and reduce the formation of pores through chemical interactions such as coordination and van der Waals forces. The molecular determines the nature of materials, and the N atom on t-BP contains lone pair of electrons and can be considered as an electron rich system; thus, we can choose compounds containing electron deficient groups to interact with t-BP. When choosing the appropriate reagent, we also need to consider whether the added substance will impair the original function of t-BP and whether the added substance will affect the doping performance of the existing doping system.
(3) Uncontrollable nature of the spiro-OMeTAD oxidation process in air. The effect obtained by introducing an oxidant to replace O2 in the co-doping system usually performed better to that of the oxidant acting alone with Li–TFSI, even at the same doping ratio. We inevitably wonder why higher efficiency can be obtained when the bi-dopant system is utilized since excessive doping will produce excessive holes and thus become a defect in carrier trapping. In addition, the oxidation reaction of spiro-OMeTAD by oxygen will inevitably occur during device placement; thus, perhaps it is more feasible to conduct the study in an oxygen-free environment.
In addition, based on the problems of the Li–TFSI/t-BP doping system, it is advisable to use these problems as a reference when designing our new dopant. Firstly, the designed dopant should have excellent doping performance, i.e., it should match with the energy level of HTM. Secondly, the hydrophobicity of the dopant plays an important role in fabricating a HTL with excellent hydrophobicity; thus, the introduction of hydrophobic units is crucial. The stability problems caused by hole dopants are also a point of concern. We should develop dopants that are non-ionic or have high migration barriers to avoid introducing additional ion migration to weaken the intrinsic stability of the device and improve the thermal stability of the dopant (high glass transition and decomposition temperatures), such as developing polymeric and molecular crosslinked dopants. Last is the selection of solvent-compatible dopants based on HTMs to facilitate the doping reaction.
Finally, although researchers have made several efforts to improve the doping ability of the Li–TFSI/t-BP system in PSCs, the study of the mechanism of co-doping and the development of new alternatives that can solve the above three problems simultaneously remains a challenge. Meanwhile, under the premise of encapsulation of PSCs, we can ignore the influence of external factors such as air or humidity, and we need to consider the influence of internal factors such as the migration of Li+. In addition, the use of gas substitution doping is a good research direction, and further research on t-BP is urgently needed. In conclusion, the traditional doping system of Li–TFSI/t-BP is still an important mechanism that ensures high efficiency, and it is very important to optimize the system to obtain more ideal devices.
