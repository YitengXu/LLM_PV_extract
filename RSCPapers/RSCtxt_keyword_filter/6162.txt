    , Accepted 3rd October 2022First published on 3rd October 2022Abstractπ-Bridges of D–π–A conjugated copolymers (CPs) not only determine the optical absorption, bandgap, energy levels, miscibility, molecular configuration, and aggregation but also affect the dipole moment, electrostatic potential, and photophysical process. Herein, we judiciously regulated the octylthienyl π bridge on both sides of electron-deficient benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) core, and three medium band gap copolymers, irregular PClBDT-TBT, regular PClBDT-BT, and PClBDT-DTBT were synthesized. DFT calculations demonstrated that the irregular models (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3 had larger dipole moment (Δμ) and reduced exciton binding energy (Eb), but the irregular models (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 possessed decreased Δμ and elevated Eb. Irregular PClBDT-TBT not only effectively depressed excessive aggregation and altered molecular orientation but also regulated the molecular crystallinity to improve the charge mobility. Moreover, femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopic analyses suggested that low-regularity PClBDT-TBT:Y6 film had a prolonged exciton diffusion time so as to suppress recombination and ameliorate the charge transfer. Consequently, the low-regularity PClBDT-TBT-based device yielded excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.04% when paired with Y6. Moreover, regular PClBDT-BT- and PClBDT-DTBT-based devices obtained PCEs of 5.54% and 11.12%, respectively, under identical testing conditions. Our work demonstrates that regulating π bridges in D–π–A type CPs is an easy and effective strategy aimed at further boosting the device performance by tuning the molecular aggregation and photophysical processes.
1. Introduction
Thanks to their desirable features of easy manufacturing, flexibility, semitransparency, and molecular structure tunability, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), which can directly convert solar energy into electricity have attracted extensive and persistent attention in the past two decades.1–6 The weak light-harvesting ability, deeper and inflexible energy levels, and high cost, have limited the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fullerene-based OSCs to a value of 11.7% in single junction binary solar cells.7 However, non-fullerene-based OSCs have achieved a great breakthrough and promoted the PCEs to outstrip over 18%.8–12 Among these numerous electron acceptors, non-fullerene (NF) small molecular electron acceptors featuring acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture and low optical bandgap (<1.60 eV), e.g., indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based ITIC,13 fluorinated IT-4F,14,15 and a C-shaped Y6 featuring the fused benzothiadiazole (BT) aromatic ring,8,9,16 have been especially focused on and gained conspicuous successes.17–20 Therefore, it was important and highly desirable to exploit high-performance medium band gap (MBG) polymeric donors paired with the aforesaid electron acceptors.21,22
Historically, an effective strategy for designing efficient photovoltaic (PV) conjugated copolymers (CPs) assisted by alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient building blocks to build up the D–π–A structure has been widely employed because it could easily modulate absorption, energy levels, molecular stacking, and microstructural morphology of the resulting CPs by elaborately choosing suitable D, π-bridge, and A subunits and delicately regulating the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) procedures from the D unit to A moiety. With this in mind, some typical building blocks, for instance, benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),23–27 oligothiophene,16,17,28–31 and BT32–37 were selected to explore the high-performance MBG polymeric donors in order to well match the NFAs. It is well known that because of its planar and rigid geometry, strong o-benzoquinoidal structure, easily functionalized by fluorine, chlorine and alkyloxy substituent groups, and easy preparation, BT was considered to be one of the most excellent electron-deficient units (Chart 1 and Table S1, ESI†).36–42 Early in 2011, You's group designed a fluorinated BT-based PBnDT-DTffBT, exhibiting an optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.7 eV, the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) of −5.30 eV, and thus obtained 7.2% PCE when pairing with PC61BM.37 Subsequently, Yan et al. investigated an oligothiopnene-containing PffBT4T-2OD, the resulting PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM-based device achieved a PCE of 10.8%.38 Then, they further optimized the molecular structure via side chain and boosted the PCE up to 11.7%.7 In 2018, Peng et al. prepared a series of BT-based CPs to investigate the synergistic effect of sulfuration and fluorination onto the alkylthienyl side chain in benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), and found a combination of sulfuration and fluorination in PBDTSF-FBT obtained the best light-harvesting ability, the lowest EHOMO of −5.41 eV, and thus high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.03 V as well as best PCE of 11.66% paired with ITIC.32 Thereafter, Li et al. selected chlorinated BDT and 4,7-bis(thienyl)-5,6-dialkyloxy-BT to construct PBT-Cl, and the simper chlorination strategy impelled to achieve the deeper EHOMO of −5.51 eV, good short circuit current density (JSC) over 20 mA cm−2 and thus PCE of 11.60% when blending with IT-4F even in the adverse condition of slightly narrowing absorption range.33 Meanwhile, Guo et al. reported two D–A1–D–A2 types of MBG phthalimide-involving PhI-ffBT and ffPhI-FFBT, exhibiting excellent hole mobility of 1.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, fill factor (FF) of 76% and remarkably increased PCE of 13.31%.34 In 2020, Bo et al. also selected a BT-based MBG copolymer PBDT-AFBT as a donor to realize an excellent JSC larger than 20 mA cm−2 and PCE of 12.33% that matched with IDTCN-O.36 Evidently, the development of high-performance BT-based MBG polymeric donors was encouraging, however, it still lagged behind the well-developed BDD- and oligothiophene-based ones, and were overlooked to some extent.

Apart from regulating the D and A subunits in the D–π–A type copolymers, the π bridge played a momentous role in lengthening the conjugation, adjusting the absorption, energy levels, molecular backbone and degree of crystallinity of the corresponding PV materials.43–45 Within the numerous D–π–A copolymers, the extensively used conjugated π bridge ranged from the simple ethylene46 and ethynylene47 to the aromatic thiophene,45,48–53 selenophene,54,55 furan,56 thiazole,44,57,58 and larger conjugation thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT).59,60 Of these, thiophene was regarded as the most common and successful application unit, due to its medium electronegativity, tunable distortion angle with the bilateral-linked groups, weak intermolecular S⋯X (X = N, O, S, and halide) non-bonding interaction61 and easily decorated by alkyl-,62 alkyloxy-,63 alkylthio-,61,64 fluoro-,45 chloro-,51 ester65 and siloxane-terminated40etc. substituents. For instance, when the flexible side chain of the thiophene π bridge in naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT)-based CPs was shortened from 2-dodecyltetradecyl (DT) in NT1014 to 2-octyldodecyl (OD) in NT812, the anticipated face-on orientation, and ideal microstructural morphology was formed, which impelled the relevant PCE, remarkably increasing from 3.03% to 10.33%.62 In thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based CPs, the broadened absorption, good planarity, and 11.9 times enhanced hole mobility, and thus 2.17 times increased PCE was observed after the alkyl was substituted with alkylthio chain.61 As for BDD-based CPs, the red-shifted absorption, deepened the EHOMO, closed molecular stacking, and more obvious fibrillar network morphology was obtained and the PCE was elevated from 10.9% to 12.7% after incorporating the chloro group onto the thiophene bridge.51 Easily modified thiophene π bridge was of critical importance and gained more and more attention, thereupon, there were many works devoted to the modification of the thiophene π bridge. Nevertheless, only limited efforts have shown solicitude for the asymmetric thiophene π bridge.50,52,53,66
Given the aforementioned consideration, three MBG BT-based CPs, hereinafter called PClBDT-BT, PClBDT-TBT, and PClBDT-DTBT were synthesized, by regulating the number of π bridges using chlorinated benzodithiophene (ClBDT) as the D moiety and BT as the A unit, (Chart 2), to deeply investigate the impact of the octylthienyl bridge on the absorption, energy level, molecular dipole moment and electrostatic potential (ESP), molecular stacking, charge transfer, microstructural morphology, and photovoltaic properties. It was found that low-regularity PClBDT-TBT:Y6 film not only possessed optimized molecular orientation and aggregation but also yielded prolonged exciton diffusion time in order to reduce the recombination. Accordingly, when pairing with Y6, low-regularity PClBDT-TBT gained the sterling PCE of 13.04% (Chart 1), which outperformed those of regular PClBDT-BT (5.54%) and PClBDT-DTBT (11.12%). This work demonstrates that preciously tuning the π bridge in the D–π–A structure is easy and tried, and is the true scenario to advance the device performance.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials synthesis and characterization
Molecular structures of PClBDT-BT, PClBDT-TBT, and PClBDT-DTBT involving different numbers of octylthienyl π bridges are exhibited in Chart 2 and the corresponding synthetic procedure is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). These BT-based CPs were obtained by the Stille polycondensation reaction between chlorinated bistin 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(4-chloro-5-(2-butyloctyl)thien-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (ClBDTSn) and dibromides 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTBr2), 4-bromo-7-(5-bromo-4-octylthien-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TBTBr2) and 4,7-di(5-bromo-4-octylthien-2-yl)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBTBr2) using Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tolyl)3 as the catalyst.67 The chemical structures and purities of the comonomers were verified by 1H NMR spectra etc. (Fig. S1–S5, ESI†). The end-capping procedure was performed to enhance the stability.49 For removing oligomers and residual catalysts, further treatment was carried out considering our reported method.49 All BT-based CPs formed as black solids with yields spanning from 63% to 83% and their chemical structures were checked by 1H NMR in deuterated o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB-d4) at 85 °C (Fig. S6–S8, ESI†). Furthermore, these resulting copolymers possessed enough solubility in chloroform (CF) to satisfy the requirement for device fabrication. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) exhibited a 5% weight-loss decomposed temperature (Td) varied from 371 to 416 °C (Table S2, ESI†), which meets the need for solar cell fabrication.
2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
Normalized UV-vis absorbance spectra of PClBDT-BT, PClBDT-TBT, and PClBDT-DTBT in diluted chloroform solution and films were measured and are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), and the detailed optical data are listed in Table 1. In dilute solution, three copolymers exhibited absorption ranging from 300 to 780 nm, the weak peak placed in the high-energy region was attributed to the π–π* transition of the π-conjugated backbone, and the ones situated at low energy consisted of two vibrational peaks 0–1 peak originated from ICT interaction from D to A and the 0–0 peak was related to the aggregation.44,49,66,67 It was seen that as the number of octylthienyl π bridges increased, the maximum absorption peak (λmax) was firstly kept unchanged and then blue-shifted, and this trend was close to that found in DFT calculations discussed later (Table 2). Moving from the solution to film, red-shifted values were found to be 3 nm for PClBDT-BT from 639 nm to 642 nm, 14 nm for PClBDT-TBT from 639 nm to 653 nm, and 2 nm for PClBDT-DTBT from 608 nm to 610 nm, respectively. The optical band gap (Eoptg) calculated from the equation Eoptg = 1240/λfilmonset, where λfilmonset refers to the onset absorption band, was 1.79 eV for PClBDT-BT, 1.75 eV for PClBDT-TBT and 1.68 eV for PClBDT-DTBT, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding maximum peak absorption coefficients in the solution were measured (Fig. S10, ESI†) and estimated to be in the range of 3.24 × 104 to 3.58 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Table S2, ESI†), indicative of the π-bridge barely impacting on sunlight-harvesting capability. Importantly, these copolymers can well match with Y6 and form complementary absorption, leading to a desired JSC. Additionally, the EHOMO and ELUMO are estimated on the basis of the equation: EHOMO = −e(φonsetox + 4.70) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(φonsetred + 4.70) (eV) were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method,49 and the CV curves of polymer donors and Y6 under the identical testing condition were shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), as well as the corresponding energy levels diagram is elucidated in Fig. 1(c). We can find that the EHOMO/ELUMO levels were both gradually upshifted from −5.69/−3.60 eV to −5.57/−3.54 eV and then to −5.47/−3.52 eV, when the number of octylthienyl π bridges was increased, resulting in the reduced electrical bandgaps of 2.09, 2.03 and 1.95 eV, verified by the later DFT predication. Obviously, introducing the octylthienyl π bridge in the D–π–A structure was harmful to enlarge VOC, however, the maximized offset of ELUMO between the polymer donors and Y6 could facilitate the photo-generated excitons split into free charges.

Temperature-dependent absorption (TD-Abs) spectra with temperature scope from 25 to 105 °C in an increment of 10 °C in the diluted chlorobenzene (ca. 10−5 M) were recorded to probe into the impact of octylthienyl π bridge on aggregation, in Fig. 1(d)–(f). Obviously, strong 0–1 and 0–0 optical transitions were observed both in PClBDT-BT and PClBDT-TBT, whereas, clear 0–1 but very weak 0–0 peaks were found in PClBDT-DTBT, indicating that the bisoctylthienyl-bridge-containing polymer exhibited the weakest aggregation. As the temperature increased, the 0–0 peak in PClBDT-BT and PClBDT-TBT both blue-shifted, and the intensity decreased. This could be explained that when the solution was heated, the polymers’ aggregation capability declined and polymer chains being full of vigour were disaggregated and well-dissolved in the solvent at high temperature. Obviously, low-regularity PClBDT-TBT possessed moderate pre-aggregation capability.68–70
2.3 Density functional theory (DFT) simulations
To deeply investigate the influence of the octylthienyl π bridge on the molecular geometry and intrinsic properties of polymeric donors, DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations were performed under the B3LYP-(D3)BJ/6-31g(d,p) level and CAM-B3LYP/def2svp level, respectively.71,72 To enhance the calculation efficiency, the alternating regular polymer backbones for PClBDT-BT and PClBDT-DTBT were simplified into three repeating units (ClBDT-BT)3 and (ClBDT-DTBT)3, respectively. To better match the actual polymer, the low-regularity PClBDT-TBT was replaced with the possible linking fashions, i.e., regular (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3, and irregular (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3. Alkyl side chains 2-butyloctyl and octyl were replaced with iso-butyl and methyl, respectively. The optimized molecular geometries are shown in Fig. 2(a). According to Table S3 (ESI†), little differences in the molecular planarity in these model molecules were observed. The electron density of HOMO levels was preferentially distributed onto the whole polymer backbone and that of LUMO levels was predominantly situated on the electron-deficient BT units. The calculated EHOMO/ELUMO/Eecg were observed to be −5.09/−3.05/2.04 eV for (ClBDT-BT)3, −4.89/−2.96/1.93 eV for (ClBDT-TBT-1)3, −4.89/−2.97/1.92 eV for (ClBDT-TBT-2)3, −4.88/−2.99/1.89 eV for (ClBDT-TBT-3)3, −4.87/−2.98/1.89 eV for (ClBDT-TBT-4)3, and −4.78/−2.92/1.86 eV for (ClBDT-DTBT)3, respectively, which well tallied with the above variation trend of energy level from the CV test. We can find that the irregular model in (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 was conducive to reducing the bandgap and harvesting more sunlight.

Furthermore, ESPs were calculated and the corresponding surface ESP distribution (electron density isosurface at 0.001 a.u.), as well as ESP surface area distributions for model molecules of polymeric donors and Y6, are exhibited in Fig. 2(b), Fig. S12, S13 (ESI†), respectively. The related parameters such as molecular surface area, molecular polarity index (MPI), extreme ESP, and total average values are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). It was found that most of the conjugated surfaces of the model molecules had negative ESPs, except for the unconjugated flexible side chain. As for Y6, most conjugated surfaces possessed positive ESPs except for the large electronegative atoms N, O, F and cyano groups. Seen from Fig. S12 (ESI†), the percentage of ESP values (>10 kcal mol−1 and < −10 kcal mol−1) in regular models (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3 were both higher than those of (ClBDT-BT)3 and (ClBDT-DTBT)3. But, the percentage of ESP values (>10 kcal mol−1 and <−10 kcal mol−1) in irregular models (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 were both lower than those of (ClBDT-BT)3 and (ClBDT-DTBT)3. Also, the molecular polarity index (MPI) values of (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3 were 7.16 and 7.19 kcal mol−1, respectively, which were both higher than those of (ClBDT-BT)3 of 7.13 kcal mol−1 and (ClBDT-DTBT)3 of 6.99 kcal mol−1, however, the reduced MPI values in irregular models (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 were calculated to be only 6.37 and 6.40 kcal mol−1, respectively (Table S4, ESI†). Furthermore, the overall total average ESP values in regular models (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3 were both −0.25 kcal mol−1, which were lower than that of (ClBDT-DTBT)3, however, ones in irregular (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 were 0.02 and 0.16 kcal mol−1, respectively, which were higher than that in (ClBDT-DTBT)3 (Table S4, ESI†).
The dipole moments for all model molecules were calculated and the detailed information is listed in Table S5 (ESI†). The overall change in the ground and excited state dipole (Δμg–e) was obtained considering the changes of dipole along each coordinate via the equation: Δμg–e = [(μgx − μex)2 + (μgy − μey)2 + (μgz − μez)2]1/2.73 It was seen that Δμg–e values of two regular models (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3 in low regularity PClBDT-TBT were 9.40 and 8.78 Deby, respectively, which were obviously higher than those of regular (ClBDT-BT)3 and (ClBDT-DTBT)3 (7.24 and 8.18 Deby, respectively). However, the decreased Δμg–e values of 7.84 and 8.06 Deby in the irregular model (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3, respectively, were found. Correspondingly, a reduced Eb of 0.307 eV in the regular model (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3 but enlarged Eb of 0.320 and 0.340 eV in the irregular models (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 were also observed (Table 2). The smaller Eb was helpful in promoting the exciton dissociation efficiency.53 Besides, simulation maximum absorption peak (λmax) and oscillator strengths (f) were calculated and are summarized in Table 2. The calculated λmax values for (ClBDT-BT)3, (ClBDT-TBT-1)3, (ClBDT-TBT-2)3, (ClBDT-TBT-3)3, (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 and (ClBDT-DTBT)3 were found to be 557.06, 554.18, 557.06, 560.67, 558.68 and 569.47 nm, respectively, which were consistent with S0 → S1 transition primarily originating from single one-electron excitation from HOMO to LUMO.74 Note that the actual molecular structures of low-regularity PClBDT-TBT were complicated, however, the DFT prediction still disclosed the variation tendency.
2.4 Photovoltaic properties
To determine the influence of the conjugated octylthienyl π bridge on the device performance, BHJ devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer donors: Y6/PDINO/Al were fabricated. The PV parameters were optimized under different conditions, including screening out the D:A weight ratio, thermal annealing (TA), and using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additives, and tested under the conditions of the AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, as shown in Fig. 3, Fig. S14, S15 (ESI†), and Table 3 and Table S6 (ESI†). After searching, it was found that the best D:A weight ratios for three polymers were all to be 1:1.2 (Fig. S14 and Table S6, ESI†). In detail, the PClBDT-BT-based device exhibited a VOC of 0.88 V, JSC of 9.23 mA cm−2, FF of 52.62%, and PCE of 4.26%, and PClBDT-TBT-based device revealed a VOC of 0.83 V, JSC of 18.61 mA cm−2, FF of 67.54% and PCE of 10.42%. In contrast, the PClBDT-DTBT-based device yielded a VOC of 0.75 V, JSC of 22.97 mA cm−2, FF of 59.72%, and PCE of 10.29%. Following, optimal TA treatment had a positive effect on enhancing PCE and its treatment temperatures were 100 °C, 120 °C, and 110 °C for PClBDT-BT-, PClBDT-TBT- and PClBDT-DTBT-based devices, respectively. Thus, the corresponding PCEs were optimized as 4.86%, 13.04%, and 11.12%. Then, additives 3% DIO and 0.5% CN (volume content) played a negative impact on the device performance except that the PClBDT-BT-based device increased from 4.86% to 5.54% after using 0.5% CN (Fig. S15 and Table S6, ESI†). As a consequence, the optimized J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the related PV data are summarized in Table 3. The optimized PClBDT-BT-based device acquired a VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 12.04 mA cm−2, FF of 52.88%, and PCE of 5.54%, and the best PClBDT-TBT-based device afforded a VOC of 0.81 V, JSC of 23.72 mA cm−2, FF of 67.63% and PCE of 13.04%, whilst, the first ranked PClBDT-DTBT-based device got a VOC of 0.74 V, JSC of 23.88 mA cm−2, FF of 62.94% and PCE of 11.12%. After incorporating the octylthienyl π bridge, VOC gradually down-shifted from 0.84 to 0.81 then to 0.74 V, evidenced by the above-discussed slowly elevated EHOMO from −5.69 to −5.57 then to −5.47 eV observed in the CV tests and up-shifted step by step from −5.09 to −4.89 then to −4.78 eV divined in DFT simulations, and JSC was drastically increased from 12.04 to 23.70 mA cm−2, then kept stable, while FF was firstly raised from 52.88% to 67.63% then dropped to 62.94% which was verified by the anti-V type varied shunt resistance (RSH) from 447 to 878 then to 714 Ω m2 and the V-type changed series resistance (RS) from 8.85 to 3.66 then to 4.30 Ω m2 (Table 3). Apparently, PClBDT-TBT-based device exhibited the highest PCE up to 13.04%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve under the best fabrication conditions is exhibited in Fig. 3(b). It is worth mentioning that the integrated JSC calculated from the EQE curve were 11.69, 23.27, and 23.39 mA cm−2 for PClBDT-BT-, PClBDT-TBT- and PClBDT-DTBT-based devices, respectively, whose tolerable errors were smaller than 5%, testifying the credit of JSC from J–V measurements. In addition, three copolymers showed an optical response ranging from 300 to 950 nm, which coincided with the above absorption profiles. In particular, the EQE peak placed at ca. 470 nm in PClBDT-DTBT was similar to the absorption peak in the film (Fig. 1(b)). Obviously, PClBDT-TBT:Y6- and PClBDT-DTBT-based device exhibited JSC of over 23 mA cm−2, which can be explained by the gratified EQE value over 60% within 450 to 900 nm. In contrast, the PClBDT-BT:Y6-based device possessed an awful EQE value under 35%, leading to an inferior JSC (12.04 mA cm−2).

2.5 Charge recombination behavior and transport properties
To determine the reasons why these optimized devices exhibited different JSC and FF, the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies were examined by measuring the photocurrent (Jph) relative to the effective applied voltage (Veff).75,76 Note that Jph was acquired according to the equation Jph = JL − JD, in which JL and JD represent the current density under illumination and in dark, respectively. Veff was gained from the equation Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 stands for voltage at Jph = 0 and Vappl is applied voltage. As seen in Fig. 4(a), when the Veff was larger than 2.5 V, the Jph attained the saturated values (Jsat) of 13.89, 24.17, and 24.85 mA cm−2 for PClBDT-BT:Y6-, PClBDT-TBT:Y6- and PClBDT-DTBT:Y6-based devices, respectively. The exciton dissociation probability (ηdiss) and charge collection probability (ηcoll) can be estimated according to Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit condition (Jsph) and maximal power output condition (Jmph), respectively. From PClBDT-BT to PClBDT-TBT, values of ηdiss and ηcoll were notably increased from 75.5% to 98.6%, and from 53.0% to 84.9% (Table 4), respectively, consistent with markedly increased JSC and FF. However, the PClBDT-DTBT-based device showed a slightly declined ηdiss of 95.6% and ηcoll 78.0% compared to those of PClBDT-TBT, tallying with declined FF.

To further study the charge recombination mechanism, the dependencies of JSC and VOC on the light intensity (Plight) were measured, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). Utilizing the power-law equation of JSC ∝ Pαlight to fit the data (Fig. 4(c)), the extent of bimolecular recombination can be estimated in light of the exponential factor α. The α value approaching 1 meant that photo-generated carriers in the short circuit were swept out and bimolecular recombination was low.77,78 Also, the level of trap-assisted recombination was evaluated based on the equation  (where k is Boltzmann constant, T is Kelvin thermodynamic temperature and q is the elementary charge), n is the slope value. When n is close to 1, trap-assisted recombination can be effectively inhibited at the open-circuit condition. As seen in Fig. 4(c), (d) and Table 4, from PClBDT-BT to PClBDT-TBT, both α (0.970 vs. 0.995) and n (1.124 vs. 1.049) exhibited approaching 1, demonstrating that obviously depressed charge recombination at both short-circuit and open-circuit conditions upon incorporating the octylthienyl π bridge, consistent with 96.84% increased JSC and 27.89%-enhanced FF. Nevertheless, from PClBDT-TBT to PClBDT-DTBT, both α (0.995 vs. 0.987) and n (1.049 vs. 1.096) diverged from 1, hinting the slightly aggravated charge recombination in PClBDT-DTBT-based device, in line with the 6.93% decreased FF. Obviously, these enhanced exciton dissociations and weakened recombination in PClBDT-TBT-based devices coincided with later enhanced and more balanced mobilities, and prolonged exciton diffusion time observed in transient absorption (vide infra).
To probe into the π bridge on charge mobilities, hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique.51 The related detailed procedures are seen in ESI,† and the J versus V curves are shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†) and relevant gathered data are shown in Table S7 (ESI†). The J0.5vs. V curves are exhibited in Fig. 4(e) and (f). As seen in Table 4, 1.55-fold increased hole mobility (μh) from 1.53 × 10−4 to 3.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.33-fold enhanced electron mobility (μe) from 8.63 × 10−5 to 3.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and more balanced μh/μe from 1.77 to 1.04 was observed from PClBDT-BT to PClBDT-TBT, corresponding to markedly improve, both, JSC and FF. However, from PClBDT-TBT to PClBDT-DTBT, the slightly decreased μh (3.90 × 10−4vs 3.76 × 10−4) and μe (3.74 × 10−4vs. 2.81 × 10−4) and unbalanced μh/μe (1.04 vs. 1.33) were obtained, leading to the decreased FF in PClBDT-DTBT-based device. These were related to improved aggregation, dominant face-on molecular orientation, and optimized micro-structural morphology in the low-regular PClBDT-TBT:Y6-based film.
2.6 Miscibility, blend packing, and morphology
To make a thorough inquiry into the miscibility between polymeric donors and Y6, the water and ethylene glycol (EG) droplet contact angle (CA) analyses were applied to estimate the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ), as exhibited in Fig. 5. The detailed information relevant to contact angles (θ), surface tension (γ) and χ is shown in Table S8 (ESI†). Just to make it clear, the relevant γ values were gained in accordance with iterated calculation (Section 1.5, ESI†). According to the reported references, χdonor–acceptor was estimated from the empirical formula: .79 If the difference of γ between donor and acceptor is smaller, the χ will be lower and the miscibility will be improved. Obviously, the χ value was gradually down-shifted from 0.1177 K for PClBDT-BT film to 0.0838 K for PClBDT-TBT and then to 0.0818 K for PClBDT-DTBT, indicative of low-regularity PClBDT-TBT featuring middling miscibility, which could properly regulate the phase separation of the blend films, advance the charge transfer, and hence enhance the corresponding device performance.79

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis was implemented to further probe into the impact of the octylthienyl π bridge on the intermolecular interaction degree, crystallinity, and orientation in the blend film. 2D scattering images and relevant line-cut profiles are elucidated in Fig. 6(a)–(f), respectively. The related data are also summarized in Table S9 (ESI†). As is known, π–π stacking along the direction of out-of-plane (OOP) is conducive to the highly efficient charge transfer in OSCs.2,78 As seen, both edge-on and face-on orientations coexisted in the PClBDT-BT:Y6-based film due to the (010) peak of 1.78 Å−1 in the OOP direction and the (100) peak of 0.27 Å−1, with the π–π stacking distance (dπ) calculated via the equation (d = 2π/q) of 3.52 Å and the lamellar stacking distance (dL) of 23.36 Å. The crystal coherence lengths (CCL) of (010) and (100) peaks were determined from the Scherrer equation (, in which K is Scherrer constant of approximately 0.9, FWHF is full width at half maximum for scattering peak) which was associated with the size of the local crystalline ordering were 29.5 and 125.7 Å, respectively.80 In contrast, blend films of PClBDT-TBT:Y6 and PClBDT-DTBT:Y6 exhibited an obvious (010) peak along the OOP direction and a clear (100) peak along the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting that there existed the predominant face-on orientation. This change of molecular orientation was consistent with the enhanced and more balanced charge mobility and thus contributed to markedly improved JSC and FF. Furthermore, the PClBDT-TBT:Y6-based blend film exhibited a stronger (010) peak of 1.83 Å−1 in the OOP direction and the (100) peak of 0.29 Å−1 in the IP direction with the shorter dπ of 3.43 Å and dL of 21.74 Å than those of PClBDT-DTBT-based film (dπ of 3.57 Å and dL of 23.53 Å). Also, the corresponding CCL values of (010) and (100) peaks both increased from 20.4 Å and 102.8 Å in PClBDT-DTBT to 28.1 and 109.4 Å in low regular PClBDT-TBT. These closer π–π stacking, enhanced crystallinity, and desired molecular orientation, could verify the observed moderate aggregation in TD-Abs and improve charge mobility and thus acquire 7.45%-ascended FF in the PClBDT-TBT:Y6-based film.

To gain insight into correlating the blend morphology with PV performance, tapping-model atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied. AFM images of the blend films under the corresponding optimized fabrication conditions are exhibited in Fig. 7. We can see that the roughness values for root-mean-square (RMS) of PClBDT-BT:Y6-, PClBDT-TBT:Y6- and PClBDT-DTBT:Y6-based blend films were found to be 2.076 nm, 1.307 nm, and 1.236 nm, respectively. This moderate RMS in PClBDT-TBT:Y6-based film agreed with the observation in TD-Abs, miscibility variation on CA measurement, and the tendency of stacking and crystallinity from GIWAXS analyses. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was applied to examine the in-depth morphology of the photoactive layers. Furthermore, the oversized aggregation was observed in the PClBDT-BT-based film, nano-scaled interpenetrating network, and part fibrous-like microstructure in PClBDT-TBT- and PClBDT-DTBT-based films were observed, as shown in Fig. 7(g)–(i). This improved phase separation and optimized superficial morphology could promote exciton dissociation, suppress recombination, and improve charge transfer ability, resulting in improved JSC, FF, and elevated PCE in the PClBDT-TBT-based device.81

The schematic diagram of the film morphology of these CPs featuring different octylthienyl π bridges was elucidated, as shown in Fig. 8, with the aim to more clearly illustrate the topographic variation. The displayed favorable molecular orientation, suitable aggregation, and ample miscibility in low-regularity PClBDT-TBT-based film could guarantee the high JSC, improved FF, and thereby victorious PCE.

2.7 Photophysical properties
To further discern the origin of low regularity PClBDT-TBT:Y6 system acquiring champion PV performance, the photo-carrier kinetic processes of pure and blend film were investigated using femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy with a 400 nm pump light, as shown in Fig. 9 and 10. To eliminate the disturbance of thickness, the thickness for all films was controlled to 110 nm. In principle, the TA spectra were mainly classified into two features: ground state bleaching (GSB) peak with a negative ΔA signal and excited state absorption (ESA) peak with a positive signal.82 Pure PClBDT-BT film exhibited the GSB signal ranging from 520 to 680 nm, corresponding to the electron transition from the ground state to the excited state excited by pump light, which was identical to the above-mentioned steady-state absorption (Fig. 1(b)) and ESA signal spanning from 690 to 890 nm with photoinduced absorption (PA) in the range of 900–1000 nm induced by singlet exciton. Meanwhile, PClBDT-TBT and PClBDT-DTBT films exhibited similar GSB signals (520–700 nm and 520–715 nm) and ESA signals (705–930 nm and 720–900 nm) with PA signals (940–1000 nm). To reveal the difference in ultrafast dynamics among these pure films, the decay times fitted by the tri-exponential decay function based on GSB peaks were obtained and shown in Fig. 9(g)–(i). It was seen that three decay times τ1, τ2, and τ3, were 0.37, 6.11, and 129.41 ps, respectively, for PClBDT-BT at 655 nm, 0.43, 6.18, and 167.00 ps, respectively, for PClBDT-TBT at 665 nm, and 0.41, 4.39 and 140.85 ps for PClBDT-DTBT at 675 nm, respectively. These observed approaching decay time data demonstrated that the three BT-based CPs experienced a similar physical process after being excited.83

Furthermore, TA spectra of the corresponding blend films were also investigated and elucidated in Fig. 10. As for blend films, the GSB signal of PClBDT-BT:Y6 was found to be placed in the range of 530–700 nm and 730–890 nm, and the ESA signal was over 900 nm. The newly emerged peak at 843 nm was attributed to the signal of the introducing the electron acceptor Y6, suggesting there existed efficient electron transfer processing.84 Whilst, GSB peaks 540–715 and 750–900 nm for PClBDT-TBT:Y6, 530–750 and 750–900 nm for PClBDT-DTBT:Y6 were found. The corresponding decay time values of τ1, τ2, and τ3 were successively calculated to be 0.45, 4.07, and 166.75 ps for PClBDT-BT:Y6 at 665 nm, 0.56, 11.38, and 426.60 ps for PClBDT-TBT:Y6 at 665 nm, and 0.55, 7.81 and 181.68 ps for PClBDT-DTBT:Y6, respectively. Evidently, the order of decay time is PClBDT-TBT:Y6 > PClBDT-DTBT:Y6 > PClBDT-BT:Y6, the prolonged charge time can ensure the efficient exciton diffusion and afford efficient exciton dissociation, which can account for the observed improvement in the FF and PCE of PClBDT-TBT-based device.85,86
3. Conclusions
In summary, three MBG D–π–A type BT-based polymeric donors, PClBDT-BT, PClBDT-TBT, and PClBDT-DTBT were synthesized by adjusting the number of octylthienyl π bridges in order to investigate how the π bridge affects the molecular intrinsic characteristic, physical properties, and the ultimate photovoltaic performance when pairing with Y6. It can be found that the regular model (ClBDT-TBT-1)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-2)3 had larger molecular polarity and reduced exciton binding energy, but the irregular model (ClBDT-TBT-3)3 and (ClBDT-TBT-4)3 possessed decreased molecular dipole moment and maximized exciton binding energy. Low-regularity PClBDT-TBT not only effectively depressed strong aggregation and altered the molecular orientation from mixed-fashion of PClBDT-BT-based film to face-on, but also regulated the molecular crystallinity to improve the charge mobility. Furthermore, fs-TA absorption spectra demonstrated that the low regularity PClBDT-TBT:Y6 blend had a prolonged exciton diffusion time that suppressed recombination and ameliorated charge transfer. As a result, low regularity PClBDT-TBT:Y6-based device afforded a VOC of 0.81 V, JSC of 23.72 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.63%, and thus champion PCE of up to 13.04%. 135% Increased PCE relative to PClBDT-BT mainly benefited from remarkably increased JSC and FF even sacrificing VOC, proofed by desired predominant face-on orientation and higher and balanced charge mobility. In comparison with PClBDT-DTBT, 17% enhanced PCE was mostly attributed to collectively improved VOC and FF, evidenced by the descended EHOMO level and slightly enhanced crystallinity. Therefore, our work demonstrated that skillfully regulating the π bridge in D–π–A type CPs can effectively tune the molecular aggregation and photophysical process, and further promote photovoltaic performance.
