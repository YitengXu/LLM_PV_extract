    , Accepted 17th December 2013First published on 18th December 2013AbstractPolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) coating has been spin-coated onto aligned carbon nanotube–silicon (CNT–Si) solar cells and the efficiency increased from 7.1% to 11.5%, and was further increased to 13.1% when doped with nitric acid (HNO3) under air mass (AM 1.5) conditions. The antireflection of PMMA coating and the decreased resistance at the CNT–Si interface during PMMA drying process together contributed to the performance improvement.
Over the past several decades, Schottky junction solar cells have been extensively studied due to their simple fabrication procedure and high efficiency.1–3 However, oxidation of the metal electrode and costly high vacuum deposition method have become major issues for Schottky junction cell application. As alternatives to a metal electrode, carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene with tuneable transparency, high conductivity and good chemical stability have been developed recently.4–6 Wei et al. first reported the CNT–Si solar cell with an efficiency of 1.3%.7 Jia et al. further increased the cell efficiency to 7.4% by using double-walled CNT.8 So far, major efforts have been devoted to modify CNT films with higher conductivity and better junction contacts for cell performance improvement. For example, Jia et al. obtained an efficiency of 13.8% using dilute nitric acid infiltration.9 Jung et al. achieved 11% efficiency through combination of single-walled carbon nanotube and HAuCl4 doping.10,11 However, only minor efforts have been made on CNT–Si solar cells to understand the effect of light trapping on device performance,12 even though the Si surface has a high reflectance of 36%.13 Recently, nanostructures such as pyramid,14 nanocone,15 nanowire16 and random texture17 have been widely developed for Si based solar cells, presenting a prominent light trapping effect and obvious performance improvement. Moreover, deposition of uniform thin films on Si solar cell surface such as TiO2,18 Si3N419 and Ta2O520 also can facilitate light trapping through destructive interference. Very recently, Shi et al. reported a record efficiency of 15% for the CNT–Si solar cells via a TiO2 antireflection film,21 implying a great potential for light trapping on the CNT–Si solar cells. The above mentioned antireflection nanostructure and thin film deposition are effective for light trapping. However, photolithography and high vacuum method hinder their applications in a simple and low-cost process.
Spin-coating has been widely used as a simple and low-cost method in different fields to form uniform thin films. Herein, we present that spin-coating of a PMMA layer onto the aligned CNT–Si solar cells could improve the performance from 7.1% to 11.5% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, and further increased to 13.1% when doped with HNO3. The aligned CNT structure was formed by drawing a transparent CNT film from a double-walled spinnable CNT array.22 Compared to pristine CNT–Si solar cells, the optimized PMMA coating showed about 40% increase in short-current density, and exhibited an obvious light trapping effect. In addition, decreased resistance at the CNT–Si interface during the PMMA drying process also accounted for the performance improvement.
Commercially available n-type, 4-inch diameter, 400 μm thick Si wafers with 300 nm thick oxide and a bulk resistivity of 0.05–0.2 Ω cm were used for the device fabrication. Rectangle windows (1 × 0.13 cm2) were made onto the Si substrates by etching off the exposed SiO2 before device fabrication (Fig. 1a). Then, a double-walled spinnable CNT array (about 1.5 cm in width) was drawn into a transparent CNT film (Fig. 1b). The CNT–Si solar cells were fabricated by directly transferring the CNT film onto the n-type Si substrate. The film transfer was readily achieved by placing the Si substrate under the CNT film. After that, ethanol vapour was applied onto the CNT film to enhance the contacts between CNTs and Si substrates. At the front, a micrometre-thick silver (Ag) paste was applied around the rectangle windows to enclose a nearly square window as the device area, and back contact was made by applying liquid-state gallium–indium eutectic (E-GaIn) onto the back side of Si substrates. Different PMMA solutions were spin-coated onto the device surface at 6000–7000 rpm for 30 s, forming an antireflection layer with a thickness of 80–240 nm. Finally, the device was doped with HNO3 vapour 15–20 s before testing.

The optical image in Fig. 1c shows the CNT–Si solar cell without PMMA coating shows a bright colour, while it presents a deep blue colour with PMMA coating. The atomic force microscopy image (AFM) image reveals the average thickness of CNT film is 50 nm with a roughness of 13.1 nm (Fig. S1†), and the film is very thin with a transparency of nearly 90% in the visible wavelength range (Fig. S2†). The colour variation with and without PMMA coating obviously shows the light trapping effect induced by PMMA coating. Fig. 1d and e show the detailed characterization of the CNT–Si solar cells by an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) with and without PMMA coating, respectively. The detailed SEM (Fig. 1d) study reveals that the CNTs attached onto the Si surface were loosely packed and aligned in different sized CNT bundles along the drawing direction, with different spacing distances within each other. Moreover, a “cross bundle” can also be distinguished, indicating the loosely packed CNT film structure. When coated with PMMA layer, small CNT bundles are encapsulated while large ones can still be distinguished (Fig. 1e).
The quality of the pristine CNT array was surveyed by using Raman spectral analysis (Fig. 2a). The G/D intensity ratio of 3.5 reveals the moderate quality of the pristine CNT. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows the CNTs are double-walled with an average diameter of 4.7 nm (Fig. 2b). According to theory calculations and experimental data, as the double-walled CNT diameter exceeds 4 nm, it is liable to collapse under external force.23 To optimize the antireflection effect, different concentrations of PMMA solutions were used to roughly control the PMMA film thickness (Fig. 2c), and the corresponding thicknesses fitted from ellipsometer data are shown in Table S1.† As PMMA thickness increases, the wavelength of lowest reflectance increases correspondingly (Fig. 2c). Considering a Si solar cell has maximum spectral response in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm, then 2.5 wt% was chosen as the optimized PMMA concentration. Fig. 2d shows the surface AFM image of CNT–Si solar cell fabricated with optimized PMMA concentration, inserted is the three dimensional (3D) surface image, the 6.32 nm roughness of the PMMA–CNT surface is too small compared to the wavelength of visible light (400–900 nm), thus we assume the PMMA–CNT surface can be treated as a planar antireflection surface.

Fig. 3a shows the effect of optimized PMMA coating on the performance of the CNT–Si solar cells tested under 100 mW cm−2 condition, the corresponding characterization data are listed in Table 1. Without PMMA coating, the original CNT–Si solar cell shows a Jsc of 24.3 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.56 V, a fill factor (FF) of 52.5%, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.1%. Compared to literature work, the relatively low FF could be ascribed to the moderate quality of pristine CNT array.21 In contrast, the cell performance was improved remarkably when coated with PMMA, which mainly originated from the 40% increase of the Jsc. The Jsc, Voc, and FF of PMMA–CNT–Si cells were increased to 35.6 mA cm−2, 0.6 V and 53.7%, respectively, resulting in a PCE of 11.5%. The obvious increase of Jsc by PMMA coating reveals the effective role in light reflection reduction on the Si surface. As the CNT conductivity is very sensitive to absorbed gas molecules,24 the cells were intentionally doped with nitric acid vapour (HNO3) to reduce resistance,25 the FF was further increased to 61.5%, resulting in a PCE of 13.1%, confirming the HNO3 treatment could largely reduce the sheet resistance and increase the FF.25

To elucidate the role of PMMA coating in performance improvement, ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy (UV-Vis-NIR), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and dark J–V characterization were conducted on the CNT–Si solar cells. UV-Vis-NIR (Fig. 3b) shows the bare Si surface reflects more than 30% incident light. In contrast, when coated with PMMA, the reflectance can be largely reduced to less than 10% in the wavelength range of 600–1000 nm, even to 5% at 710 nm, indicating an obvious antireflection effect. The EQE analysis confirms the antireflection effect (Fig. 3c). The uncoated CNT–Si solar cell shows a flat EQE of 60% in the wavelength range of 400–900 nm, corresponding to the wavelength absorption range of Si (1.12 eV), implying that the Si substrate is responsible for photon absorption and carrier generation. When the cell was spin-coated with a PMMA layer, the EQE was increased to more than 80% in the wavelength range of 500–800 nm, nearly 90% at about 710 nm, which is consistent with the UV-Vis-NIR data in Fig. 3b. Moreover, after intentionally doping with HNO3, almost no differences within the EQE and Jsc data could be observed, which again confirmed the HNO3 doping only changed the resistance of CNTs and increased the FF.25 As the roughness of the PMMA–CNT layer (Fig. 2d) is too small to scatter incident light (400–900 nm), the antireflection effect should come from the destructive interference, which would satisfy the expression dPMMA = λ/4nPMMA, where λ is the wavelength of incident light, dPMMA is the thickness of PMMA layer, and nPMMA(1.49) is the refractive index of PMMA coating; the destructive interference is illustrated in Fig. 3d. Due to the existing CNT film, spin-coating of 2.5 wt% PMMA solution formed a thicker (126 nm, 112 nm without CNT film) PMMA film (Fig. S3†). Given an incident light wavelength of 710 nm (where maximum antireflection occurs), the optimized thickness is 120 nm, which is consistent with the actual thickness 126 nm, which proved the planar assumption is correct within the small roughness of the PMMA–CNT film surface.
Since our process involves chemical doping, the stability should be evaluated during storage. The efficiency could only last several hours before a decrease of FF (Fig. S4†). In the future, a more stable doping agent, such as I2, should be selected.26 Table S2† shows the average efficiency of our PMMA–CNT–Si solar cell is 12% with a variation of 0.78.
When the double-walled CNT film is transferred onto the Si substrate, the CNT film is porous and loose, and tends to suffer a “shrink force” upon the spin-coating of PMMA solution. Particularly, when the double-walled CNT diameter is larger than 4 nm, the CNTs are liable to be collapsed or flattened under a small external pressure.23 The possible flattening and shrinking effect may lead to radial strain on the CNTs, and therefore modifies the CNT–Si interface resistance due to effective contact area variation. Actually, the FF of the same device was slightly increased after being coated by PMMA coating (Fig. 3a and Table 1), and the increase would not originate from the bulk CNTs because PMMA has no doping effect and no conductivity, Fig. S5† ruled out the effect of PMMA coating on the CNT film, where no conductivity variation appears before and after PMMA coating. To further understand the PMMA coating role on CNT–Si interface, dark J–V measurements on the CNT–Si cells were conducted without HNO3 treatment. The series resistance (Rs) was extracted from Fig. 4a, which mainly consists of contact resistance between CNTs and Si, bulk resistance of the CNTs and bulk resistance of Si, where the bulk resistivity would not change under this specific condition. It is found the Rs decreased from 17.2 Ω to 15.4 Ω after PMMA coating within the same device. Here, we deduced that the decreased resistivity more likely arose from the contact improvement between CNTs and Si. During PMMA coating and solvent evaporation, the “shrink force” might press the CNTs in the film, thus the CNTs would suffer radial strain, resulting in a larger contact area between CNTs and Si, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. This assumption was confirmed by the performance characterization shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1; the pristine CNT–Si solar cell shows a FF (relates to the series resistance of the cell) of 52.5%, and then increased to 53.7% after PMMA coating within the same device. Based on the antireflection and dark J–V analysis, we proposed in our specific large diameter double-walled CNT–Si solar cells, both the antireflection of PMMA and decreased resistance of CNT–Si interface together contributed to the performance improvement.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that surface engineering on aligned CNT–Si solar cell is a simple and promising strategy for the enhancement of cell performance. It is revealed that the surface coating of PMMA layer shows an obvious antireflection effect, leading to the increase of Jsc, Voc and PCE. In addition, it is proved that the performance improvement mainly comes from the antireflection of PMMA coating and partly from the decreased interface resistance between CNTs and Si.
