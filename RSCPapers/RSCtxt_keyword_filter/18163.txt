    , Accepted 4th March 2019First published on 5th March 2019AbstractBendable nickel oxide (NiOx) was first fabricated via polydopamine (PDA) modification and applied as an interfacial layer in flexible perovskite solar cells. PDA cross-linked NiOx could release mechanical stress to eliminate the inherent brittleness of inorganic crystals, leading to a flexible device exhibit over 70% retention of efficiency after 1000 bending cycles.
The development of emerging electronic products such as wearable electronic devices and portable chargers has triggered tremendous demands for flexible photovoltaic cells.1 Since the application of organic halide perovskite materials to solar cells, significant breakthroughs have been made due to their incomparable high absorption coefficient, excellent carrier mobility, and low temperature solution preparation.2 The greatest challenge in industrializing large-area flexible and wearable perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is that each electronic component must possess the properties of flexural endurance and long-term stability, with the guarantee of high device efficiency. Besides the development of flexible and conductive transparent electrodes,3 most strategies have focused on the preparation of perovskite layers with excellent optoelectronic4 and mechanical properties,5 as well as large-area manufacturing techniques.6 The most reported flexible PVSCs and modules are fabricated with the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole-transport layer (HTL). However, the acidity and hygroscopicity are insurmountable gaps in achieving high-performance PVSCs with long-term stability.7
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is a particularly attractive option for HTL due to its unique advantages, such as wide bandgap, low-temperature preparation and excellent chemical stability.8 Nevertheless, the relatively weak charge mobility leads to more hole accumulation and hole/electron recombination near the interface.9 Higher conductivity and more favorable band arrangement can be achieved by p-type doping with metal ions or strong electron-acceptor molecules,10 thereby improving hole extraction. Additionally, the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs is limited by the fill factor (FF) and the short-current density (Jsc), which is attributed to the fact that NiOx has surface defects caused by interstitial nickel and adsorbed oxygen, and the interfacial contact with perovskite is relatively poor.11 Many strategies, such as using diethanolamine (DEA)12 and phosphonic acid and its partial derivatives, have been developed to effectively passivate the surface defects of NiOx and improve its interfacial contact with perovskite. Unfortunately, the inherent brittleness of inorganic NiOx has not received much attention as a crucial bottleneck in the manufacture of fully flexible perovskite optoelectronic devices.
In this study, we report a novel bendable NiOx layer, which can eliminate the inherent brittleness attributed to the formation of polydopamine (PDA) cross-linked NiOx network via the strong intermolecular interactions.13 Moreover, PDA modified NiOx (referred to as NiOx:PDA) displays optimized interfacial contact and balanced charge mobility, which can reduce the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination loss. As a result, the inverted perovskite devices based on NiOx:PDA exhibit superior photovoltaic performance (PCE of 18.35%) with negligible hysteresis compared to that of the reference device. Particularly, the cross-linked network endows NiOx:PDA with flexural endurance by releasing mechanical stress, and thus the corresponding champion flexible PVSC devices can maintain more than 70% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles.

Fig. 1a shows the formation of the NiOx:PDA bendable interfacial layer in PVSCs, and the schematic of bendability is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The fabrication route consists of three main stages. Namely, (I) adding dopamine hydrochloride to NiOx nanoparticle (NPs) solution to improve dispersibility (Fig. S1a, ESI†), (II) naturally allowing self-polymerized PDA bind to NiOx NPs (showing increased particle size in Fig. S1b, ESI†) via intermolecular interactions (Fig. 1c), and (III) forming a PDA-interpenetrated and cross-linked network via the spin-coating and annealing process to sustain mechanical bending. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images as shown in Fig. 1d and crack statistics (Fig. S2, ESI†) demonstrate that there are almost no cracks in the NiOx:PDA film after bending 500 times, whereas the NiOx film shows obvious cracks and is partially peeled off. Similar morphologies can be observed from atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S3, ESI†). Additionally, the corresponding Young's modulus value (Fig. S4, ESI†) obtained from the AFM peak-force model reduces from 1048 MPa to 377 MPa after PDA modification, which is comparable to the flexible ITO/PET electrode (355 MPa). The excellent bendability of NiOx:PDA can be attributed to the existence of strong intermolecular interactions (N–Ni coordination bond and H⋯O hydrogen bond) between the PDA additive and NiOx NPs, which can be confirmed by subsequent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. 1e and f). Besides the distinct shifts toward the higher electron binding energy direction in the Ni3+ state characteristic peaks (NiOOH at ∼855 eV and Ni2O3 at ∼854 eV) and the Ni2+ state NiO peak (∼853 eV), a new characteristic peak appears at ∼856 eV, which can be considered as electron transfer under the Ni–N interaction.14 The detail XPS peak fitting data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). In addition, the NiOx:PDA film exhibits a uniform conductive distribution (Fig. S5, ESI†) and a high transmission of approximately 90% over the spectral range from 400 to 800 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). The extremely high transparency of the bottom interfacial layer effectively minimizes the loss of light from the photovoltaic device to obtain a higher photocurrent.

Another commendable interaction of the –OH groups with Pb2+ shown in Fig. 1c has been previously reported and exploited to regulate the crystallization of perovskite.12 The AFM (Fig. 2a) and top-view SEM (Fig. 2b) images have been analysed to further investigate the effect of interfacial modification in NiOx:PDA on perovskite nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. Compared to pristine perovskite, a compact morphology with reduced pinholes can be obtained when perovskites are crystallized on the NiOx:PDA layer. Moreover, the average grain size (Fig. 2c) of perovskite increases from 273 nm to 375 nm, which can effectively reduce grain boundaries and charge recombination.15 In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at 14.1° (110) and 28.4° (220) are not shifted but increased in intensity, meaning that the PDA modification regulates the perovskite crystallization without changing the crystal phase (Fig. 2d). A significant increase in the characteristic absorption intensity near the visible region of 400–600 nm reflects enhanced crystallinity and reduced reflection (Fig. 2e). These results also benefit from the more hydrophilic surface of the NiOx:PDA layer composed of multi-domain crystals with a higher root-mean-square roughness (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†), which can provide more nucleation sites for the growth of the dense perovskite film with large grain size, and increase the exciton transport channels.16

The interfacial effects of different HTLs on the dynamics of charge recombination were investigated by quenched steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra, respectively. It has been reported that the electron trap site formed by the under-coordinated Pb atoms generated from halide vacancies in perovskite crystals can be effectively passivated by electron-rich molecules.17 The intensity of the emission peak of the perovskite on NiOx:PDA is weakened and the peak position is blue-shifted, indicating both reduced defect density and efficiently separated excitons by PDA modification (Fig. 3a). Additionally, Fig. 3b–d compares the TRPL decay characteristics by calculating the corresponding PL lifetime with a bi-exponential fit. The fast decay lifetime (τ1) reflects the injection efficiency of charge from perovskite to the adjacent charge extraction layer, whereas the slow decay lifetime (τ2) is related to the exciton radiation attenuation.18 Combining the fitting parameters (Table S2, ESI†) with the TRPL decay trend, decreases in both the τ1 value and the weight fraction of τ2 demonstrate that the perovskite grown on NiOx:PDA exhibits a more remarkable exciton transfer performance. In addition, the hole extraction behaviour is also affected by the alignment of energy levels for the interfacial layer and perovskite. The NiOx:PDA films display lower valence band (VB) values calculated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Fig. 3e, f, Fig. S9 and Table S3, ESI†), which is due to the existing N–Ni coordination bond and the N atoms acting as electron donors.12 The more favourable energy level alignment between NiOx:PDA and perovskite facilitates hole extraction, which is beneficial for obtaining higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PVSCs.

The photovoltaic performances of the reference and optimized PVSC devices have been investigated, as shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1. The best device performance is achieved using NiOx:PDA with an optimum PDA doping concentration of 0.4 wt%, which is adopted in the following discussion. The maximum PCE is 18.35% (18.25%), with a Voc of 1.05 V (1.05 V), Jsc of 22.43 mA cm−2 (22.32 mA cm−2) and FF of 78.1% (78.0%) measured in the reverse (forward) scan, suggesting negligible current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis. Moreover, it is obvious that the improvements in the device photovoltaic performance are mainly manifested in Voc and FF, which is attributed to the high quality perovskite film, appropriate energy level and favourable interfacial contact. Meanwhile, the integrated current densities obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. S10, ESI†) are close to the Jsc values obtained from J–V curves. As presented in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the reverse current density of the PDA-incorporated device is reduced by about 0.8 orders of magnitude. The increase in the shunt resistance facilitates more photocurrent to flow effectively through the PVSCs instead of converting into a leakage current. More importantly, these unpackaged PVSCs based on NiOx:PDA exhibit better stability over 400 h, maintaining more than 90% of the original PCE (Fig. S12, ESI†). We further investigate the hole mobility and trap state density of the devices by means of the space charge limited current (SCLC) model using the Mott Gurney equation J = (9/8)εε0μ(V2/d3)19 (Fig. 4b), where ε (=32) is the relative dielectric constant of CH3NH3PbI3 and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Compared to the calculated hole mobility of the unmodified NiOx, NiOx:PDA exhibits a much higher value (Fig. S13 and Table S4, ESI†), which is more balanced with the electron mobility reported previously,20 thus effectively reducing exciton recombination caused by hole accumulation. Furthermore, the trap density of the NiOx:PDA based device calculated from the equation VTFL = entL2/(2εε0)19 is lower, where VTFL represents the trap-filled limited voltage. In general, non-radiative trapping assisted recombination is considered to be the major recombination pathway in some reverse PVSCs, and the slope α(β) deviation from 1 (1 KT/q) reflects the probability of occurrence of such recombination.21 Notably, the trap-assisted charge recombination in the NiOx:PDA based device is effectively suppressed (Fig. 4c and d). These results are attributed to the formation of uniform and high quality perovskite films with high coverage and large grain sizes.

To certify the practicability and performance of flexible PVSCs with the bendable NiOx:PDA layer, the single HTL was first fabricated on the PET substrate and mechanically bent 500 times in advance. The transmittance of the unmodified NiOx film is reduced by about 10% after bending, while NiOx:PDA remains at the same level as before (Fig. S14, ESI†). There is absence of obvious deterioration in the absorption intensity (Fig. 5a) and crystallinity (Fig. S15, ESI†) for the perovskite layer on the pre-treated NiOx:PDA, whereas a significant decrease is present in the control sample. Importantly, the excellent exciton transfer capacity in NiOx:PDA did not degrade after bending (Fig. 5b). The inset in Fig. 5c displays a photograph of the flexible PVSCs containing the NiOx:PDA bendable layer and the corresponding champion J–V curve is shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The PVSCs exhibit a significant flexural endurance at a larger curvature radius (R ≥ 5 mm, Fig. 5c). We further verify the effect of 1000 consecutive bending cycles on three types of PVSCs (Fig. 5d). An obvious decrease in PCE of the reference devices after 50 bending cycles can be observed, due to the fragile perovskite and NiOx crystals and the stress accumulation at the interface of perovskite/NiOx. Notably, NiOx:PDA based devices can maintain 65% of the initial PCE after bending 500 times due to the excellent flexural endurance. Additionally, the flexible PVSCs have been further optimized by our previously reported method of introducing polyurethane (PU) into the perovskite layer,5 which exhibits over 70% retention of efficiency after 1000 bending cycles. This demonstrates the integration of bendable inorganic HTL and perovskite, thus opening up a new avenue for the realization of stable wearable electronic devices (Table S7, ESI†).

(c) Normalized PCE of flexible PVSCs measured after bending with different curvature radii. (d) Normalized PCE as a function of bending cycles. 
In summary, an elastomeric PDA cross-linked NiOx crystal network has been introduced to release mechanical stress, thus overcoming the inherent brittleness of the inorganic interfacial layer. The inverted perovskite devices based on NiOx:PDA exhibit superior photovoltaic performance with negligible hysteresis compared to that of the reference devices. Particularly, the champion flexible PVSC devices can maintain more than 70% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles, due to the integration of the bendable inorganic HTL and the perovskite layer.
