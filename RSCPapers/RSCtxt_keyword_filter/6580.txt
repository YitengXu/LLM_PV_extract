    , Accepted 19th February 2020First published on 25th February 2020AbstractWell-controlled band engineering of a blue phosphorus/C2N van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction is investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The heterojunction has a natural type-II band alignment with a direct band gap value of 1.514 eV, which gives the enormous potential for solar cell applications. When the heterojunction is under solar illumination, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs can separate out on the disparate monolayers effectively. It induces the formation of spatially indirect excitons. Furthermore, it is found that the band gap of this heterojunction exhibits approximately linear variation with respect to the perpendicular external electric field. Very interestingly, a band alignment change from type-II to type-I occurs at an applied electric field of −0.2 V Å−1. This characteristic provides an attractive possibility to obtain novel multifunctional devices.
1. Introduction
A multitude of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and indium selenide (InSe) have been attracting widespread interest, attributed to their exceptional physical properties in nanodevices.1–5 However, an individual 2D material system cannot be sufficient to meet the demands for actual applications. For example, the absence of a band gap in graphene remains an obstacle for its optoelectronic use.6 Fortunately, a fascinating field has recently emerged that assembles two or more disparate 2D materials vertically through the vdW force so as to gain a vdW heterojunction,7 which is likely to break through the constraints of the single-layer materials and be useful for solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).8–10 To date, there have been extensive experimental and theoretical efforts to research vdW heterojunctions, including MoS2/WS2, graphene/BN, black phosphorene/MoS2, Sb/InSe and so forth.11–16 In particular, the tunable graphene/BN bilayer band gap under an external electric field realizes the application of graphene in semiconductor devices.13 What is noteworthy is that the formation of the vdW heterojunction does not merely integrate the advantages of the constituent components, but also gives rise to unexpected novel properties and phenomena. Therefore, searching for new 2D materials to develop high-performance optoelectronic devices is of considerable significance.
Recently, a class of materials that have attracted tremendous attention are the graphitic carbon nitrides like C3N4, C6N6 and C2N, which are earth-abundant and environmentally friendly semiconductors with moderate direct band gap values.17–20 The C2N sheet stands out amongst these by virtue of its low-cost fabrication, high water permeability,21 and more prominent visible light absorption capacity than C3N4.22 A high on/off ratio of 107 in the field-effect transistor (FET) device based on C2N has been achieved.19 It is reported that 2D C2N can be potentially applied in spintronic and electronic devices after adsorbing TM elements or placing it on top of α-Fe2O3(0001).23,24 Moreover, creation of C2N/semiconductor heterojunctions, such as C2N/MoSe2,25 C2N/MoS2,26 C2N/CdS and C2N/GaTe,27–30 has demonstrated a great potential for enhancing the photovoltaic or photocatalytic performance of C2N because of the efficient separation of the electron–hole pairs. Of particular note is that C2N and Sb monolayers can combine to form a stable type-II vdW heterojunction with an excellent solar power conversion efficiency as high as 22.86%.31
Another representative kind of semiconductor, an allotrope of atomic-layered black phosphorus, called blue phosphorus (BlueP), has achieved large-scale single layer epitaxial growth on a Au(111) substrate in experiments by Zhang et al.32 The BlueP monolayer is composed of two atomic layers of P atoms in a buckled graphene-like structure. In addition, high stability and a wide band gap as well as fast carrier mobility (μe ∼ 466, μh ∼ 1711 cm2 V−1 s−1) at room temperature suggest that monolayer BlueP is highly promising for applications in electronics and optoelectronics.33,34 Inspired by the distinguishing features of C2N and BlueP, a composite structure based on them is expected to achieve more desirable properties to maximize their respective advantages in the fields of optoelectronic and electronic devices. Nevertheless, there remains little previous work on the exploration of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction.
In this paper, for the first time, a comprehensive insight is gained into the electronic properties of the novel BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction. The results suggest that a pristine heterojunction exhibits type-II energy band alignment with the lowest energy electrons contributed by the C2N layer and the BlueP layer dominating the lowest energy holes, which facilitates efficient spatial separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Then, the unprecedented band alignment control and the carrier localization in the heterojunction are regulated remarkably via applying an external electric field, enabling both C2N and BlueP to participate as the electron acceptor or donor. It is believed that the obtained results can provide valuable guidance for the synthesis of BlueP/C2N heterojunctions and for their applications in the multifunctional optoelectronic device field.
2. Computational methods
All geometric optimization and energy calculations were accomplished using an ultrasoft pseudopotential within the framework of first-principles calculations based on DFT, as implemented in the CASTEP code.35 The exchange–correlation interaction was described by means of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.36 A cutoff energy of 450 eV was set for a plane wave expansion and a grid of 7 × 7 × 1 k-points was sampled using the Monkhorst–Pack method in the Brillouin Zone (BZ). In the geometric optimization, the self-consistent convergence accuracy was chosen as 1 × 10−5 eV per atom. Meanwhile, the maximal force converged to the tolerance of 0.03 eV Å−1 between atoms. The DFT-D method with Grimme vdW correction was employed to take the long range vdW interaction into consideration.37 In order to confirm that the DFT-D method was sufficient to introduce the vdW interactions, the Tkatchenko–Scheffler DFT-TS method was performed for comparison.38 Additionally, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional was used to calculate the electronic structure of the heterojunction.39 The valence electrons for the corresponding atoms were treated as follows: 2s22p2 for C, 2s22p3 for N and 3s23p3 for P. Finally, we selected 18 Å as a vacuum thickness along the Z-direction to avoid periodic interaction.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometrical structure and stability of the heterojunction
Generally speaking, only when the lattice mismatch is less than 5% can a stable heterojunction form favorably.40 Based on the lowest total energy, for the freestanding C2N monolayer and the isolated BlueP monolayer, the optimized lattice constants are 8.32 Å and 3.25 Å, respectively. The results are in accordance with the previously reported values.20,41 For the purpose of matching the two monolayers perfectly as much as possible, a  supercell of BlueP (contains 14 P atoms) and a unit cell of C2N (contains 12 C and 10 N atoms) are selected to construct the BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction. In this way, the lattice constant of the heterojunction would come to a = 8.47 Å with the lattice mismatch of about 3.4%, which affirms the possibility of the experimental realization of this heterojunction. The top and side views of the atomic structure are presented in Fig. 1(a). After geometric optimization, the obtained equilibrium interlayer distances between the C2N and BlueP monolayers in the heterojunction are 3.43 Å and 3.48 Å, respectively, calculated by DFT-D and DFT-TS methods. Such a vertical distance is greater than the sum of the covalent radii of the P and C/N atoms. This is an evidence of the physical mechanism for the bonding between the two layers. Moreover, the equilibrium distance has the same order of magnitude as those of the typical crystals dominated by the weak vdW interactions, such as BlueP/graphene,42 C2N/CdS,27 and BlueP/C3N systems.43 It suggests that the weak vdW effect performs an indispensable role in the interlayer interaction of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction.

To characterize the relative stability of the BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction quantitatively, the interfacial binding energy (Eb) is estimated as: Eb = EBlueP/C2N − (EC2N + EBlueP)(1)where EBlueP/C2N, EC2N and EBlueP are the total energies of the heterojunction, the C2N monolayer and the BlueP monolayer, respectively. The binding energies of the relaxed BlueP/C2N heterojunction are calculated to be −0.32 eV at an interlayer distance of 3.43 Å using DFT-D, and −0.27 eV at 3.48 Å interlayer distance via DFT-TS. A more negative Eb value denotes better stability. It is concluded that the DFT-D method seems to yield a little bit smaller interlayer distance and binding energy than the DFT-TS method does. Interestingly, Fig. 1(b) reveals that the corresponding binding energy variation with interlayer distance under DFT-TS level exhibits an extremely similar trend to that DFT-D level, implying that both of them yield an excellent prediction of the relationship between the interlayer distance and binding energy. Considering that the conclusions drawn via different vdW correction methods are basically the same, only the DFT-D method is performed in the rest of this work, and an equilibrium heterojunction with the 3.43 Å interlayer distance is regarded as the research target due it being the lowest Eb.
3.2. Electronic properties of the heterojunction
To gain an in-depth understanding of the electronic structure of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction, the band structures of the single-layer C2N and single-layer BlueP and the heterojunction are calculated and shown in Fig. 2. One can find that the C2N monolayer has a direct band gap of 1.631 eV, where the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) are both situated at the same high-symmetric point Γ in the BZ, which agrees with previous works.26,44 As for BlueP monolayer in the  supercell, it can be seen that both the VBM and CBM lie along the Γ–K line, closer to the K point. Thus, a direct band gap semiconductor characteristic with the value of 1.913 eV is observed in the BlueP monolayer, which is in agreement with ref. 43. It should be mentioned that an indirect band gap of the BlueP monolayer can be found in both the unit cell and 2 × 2 sized supercell.45,46 To further support the accuracy of our computational methods, the relevant proofs are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), consistent with preceding reported results. The reason is that the electronic structure characteristics of 2D material depend on the size and lattice of the supercell geometry. A similar dependence also occurs in the C3N monolayer.43 However, the BlueP monolayer has a similar band gap with diverse cell sizes, which hardly affects the conclusion that primarily concentrates on the modified band gap values. After constructing the BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction, the electronic structures of BlueP and C2N are well preserved upon binding. Nevertheless, compared with those of the isolated BlueP and C2N monolayers, there are significant changes for the VBM and CBM in the heterojunction as a result of the vdW interlayer coupling. It is of interest that both the CBM and VBM reside at the Γ point in the band structure of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction, displaying a direct band gap of 1.514 eV. It is this direct band gap within the visible frequency that will benefit the optical absorption and make the electron excitation from the VBM to CBM in BlueP/C2N heterojunction easy without the participation of phonons, which is different from the indirect band gap in the InSe/C2N heterojunction.47

For the sake of further identifying the electronic properties of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction, the total density of states (TDOS) and corresponding partial density of states (PDOS) between −1 eV and 3 eV are calculated, as depicted in Fig. 3(a). Regarding the BlueP monolayer, the states of peak that make the most enormous contribution near the Fermi level are the 3p orbitals in the P atom. As for the C2N monolayer, the states in the CBM are predominantly composed of C-2p and N-2p orbitals, while N-2p orbitals overwhelmingly dominate the VBM. The VBM of C2N is lower than that of BlueP whereas the CBM of BlueP is higher than that of C2N. It suggests that the excited electrons and holes are confined in disparate monolayers and induces the formation of spatially indirect excitons.48 At this point, the new CBM and VBM of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction primarily originated from the C2N layer and BlueP layer, respectively. Consequently, it is convenient to preferentially directly migrate the electrons in the 3p orbitals of BlueP into the C-2p states of C2N. As discussed above, there is a typical type-II staggered gap band alignment structure at the BlueP/C2N interface, which is conducive to the separation of the photogenerated carriers in real space. Hong et al. reported the experimental observation of ultrafast charge transfer in photo-excited type-II MoS2/WS2 heterojunctions using both photoluminescence mapping and femtosecond (fs) pump–probe spectroscopy.11 The result showed that the holes transfer from the MoS2 layer to the WS2 layer occurs within 50 fs. Such ultrafast charge transfer in type-II vdW heterojunctions can enable novel 2D devices for optoelectronics and light harvesting.

The yellow (negative value) and green areas (positive value) respectively represent the charge depletion and accumulation, and the isosurface value is 0.0025 e Å−3. The dashed lines represent the positions of C2N and BlueP. 
The above results were obtained using the standard PBE functional; to verify the availability, here the screened hybrid functional of the HSE06 method is also adopted to obtain the electronic structure of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction. Fig. S2 (ESI†) illustrates the calculated band structure, DOS and band alignment. By comparing these results, it is concluded that the results calculated by HSE06 are substantially identical to the trend of the PBE results, except that the band gap is increased by 492 meV (see ESI† for details). Although the HSE06 functional is reported to reproduce the electronic band gap accurately for most material systems, this method is still not employed for the succeeding calculations about the BlueP/C2N heterojunction, which is due to a consideration of the substantial computational cost. On the other hand, the DFT-D correction used in our system is also enough to predict the correct trend and to demonstrate the physical mechanisms properly. Therefore, more insights into the BlueP/C2N heterojunction are investigated based on the GGA-PBE functional.
The formation of the heterojunction can influence the electronic properties of the C2N and BlueP layers as a result of the charge redistribution at the interface. To introduce this, the interfacial coupling effect on the charge distribution is explored via the charge density difference along the Z-direction, which is defined as: (2)where ,  and  are the charge densities normal to the plane of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction, C2N and BlueP monolayers, respectively. Visibly, charge redistribution takes place in the BlueP/C2N system by the formation of electron-rich and hole-rich regions, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). It is well acknowledged that the redistribution behaviors of interface charge include charge depletion (yellow isosurface) and charge accumulation (green isosurface), and can result in electron polarization and interface dipole formation.49 Beyond that, the surface charge repulsion effect is directly evidenced by the depletion of charge, which easily generates surface orbital rehybridization.49 So, our result intuitively suggests that electrons move from the C2N monolayer to the BlueP monolayer in the interfacial region. As a consequence, electrons gather close to the BlueP layer while they deplete at the C2N area. This can trigger the emergence of a built-in electric field (Eint) with a direction pointing from C2N to BlueP, which further causes the drift of electrons and holes in opposite directions, and ultimately achieves a balance with the diffusion force. A similar charge redistribution phenomenon occurs at the Sb/InSe interface as well.15
Band alignment plays a key role in semiconductor device design. Meanwhile, the work function of a material is a crucial physical parameter usually taken as an essential reference for band alignment, which contributes to better understand the origin of charge transfer. The work function is expressed using the equation: Φ = EVAC − EF(3)where EVAC represents the electrostatic potential of the vacuum level and EF is the Fermi level. As presented in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the work functions are 5.95 eV and 5.56 eV for the BlueP and C2N monolayers, respectively, which are in line with reported results.43,50 The difference in work function predicts that the electrons in C2N will spontaneously flow into the BlueP monolayer once the two layers come into contact with each other. Accordingly, the C2N layer is positively charged while the BlueP layer is negatively charged across the interfacial region. The result accords well with charge density difference analysis. Moreover, Fig. 4(c) shows the work function is 5.82 eV for the heterojunction, which is higher than that of C2N and lower than that of BlueP, so that the Fermi levels of the two monolayers are equal after interface equilibrium. In addition, the band edge positions of individual BlueP and C2N layers as well as BlueP/C2N heterojunction are presented in Fig. 4(d). The band alignment calculated based on the work function also shows the formation of an intrinsic type-II heterojunction, in accordance with the DOS result. When exposed to light with a specific wavelength, both BlueP and C2N absorb photon energy. The photoexcited electrons in the valence band jump to the corresponding conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band.

(d) A schematic diagram of the band configuration before and after contact of BlueP and C2N, displaying the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. The green solid line and red dashed line respectively represent the vacuum level EVAC and the Fermi level EF. 
The charge transfer near the junction region may follow the double transfer mechanism or Z-scheme mode.51,52 Due to the presence of the Eint near the interface from C2N to BlueP, and there is a noticeable difference between the VBM of BlueP and CBM of C2N; the Z-scheme transfer mode may not exist. At that time, under irradiation, the presence of the band offset leads to the photogenerated electrons produced in the CBM of BlueP injecting into the CBM of C2N. On the contrary, the photogenerated holes are constantly driven from the VBM of C2N to that of BlueP layer. Simultaneously, the Eint acts in the opposite (same) direction to the migration of photogenerated electrons (holes), thereby suppressing the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Subsequently, combining the dual effects of Eint and band alignment, photoinduced electrons and holes can be separated into disparate materials to form charge transfer excitons (indirect excitons), and extend their lifetimes. Also note that the band gap of 1.514 eV of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction falls into the optimum range of 1.2–1.6 eV for a high-quality excitonic solar cell device,53 so the heterojunction can effectively absorb sunlight and spatially separate bound photogenerated carriers, which is expected to have an enormous potential for application in the next generation of thin-film solar cells. Moreover, to estimate the band edge charge transport properties of the heterojunction, the effective masses of electrons (me*) and holes (mh*) for C2N and BlueP monolayers as well as the BlueP/C2N heterojunction are calculated and discussed in the ESI.†
3.3. Electronic properties modulated via the external electric field
Applying a perpendicular electric field is one of the efficient strategies to modulate the electronic structure of 2D materials. It allows significant control of band alignment and the Schottky barrier height for vdW heterojunctions.8,54,55 Herein, it is necessary to explore the electronic properties of the BlueP/C2N system using external electric field (E-field) effects. The E-field is applied ranging from −0.8 V Å−1 to 0.8 V Å−1 with steps of 0.1 V Å−1, where the positive direction is directed from the bottom C2N monolayer to the top BlueP monolayer. The band gap evolution of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction under the influence of the applied E-field is plotted in Fig. 5(a), and the black dashed line represents the gap value without external E-field intervention. It is found that these band gap values present asymmetric variation in response to the two opposite directions of the external E-field, which may be the consequence of the interaction between the Eint and external E-field.
 Fig. 5  (a) The band gap as a function of the E-field in the BlueP/C2N heterojunction. (b–e) Band alignment of the BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction under different E-fields. 
In detail, when an external negative E-field opposite to the direction of Eint is applied, the total E-field is reduced, inducing the band gap to increase stably at first until reaching the maximum value of 1.619 eV which appears at an E-field of −0.3 V Å−1. However, when the external negative E-field intensity reaches a particular value, the Eint effect can be cancelled out completely. Thereafter, if the E-field becomes stronger in the negative direction, the band gap decreases drastically and eventually turns out to be zero at −0.8 V Å−1, leading to the mutation from a semiconductor to a metal in the heterojunction. In contrast, in the presence of a positive E-field, the total E-field can be enhanced since the direction of the external E-field is the same as Eint. In such a situation, the band gap declines monotonically with E-field numerical increases. Once the E-field is greater than 0.6 V Å−1, an intriguing semiconductor–metal transition can be triggered in the BlueP/C2N heterojunction. This band gap regulation prediction indicates that the application of an external E-field can offer valid dynamic control of the electronic properties in the heterojunction, which makes it a promising candidate in the fields of optoelectronic detectors, and FET and MEMS devices.
The reason for the band gap variation can also be graphically explained by the band alignment of diverse external E-field strengths, as illustrated in Fig. 5(b–e). It is noted that the original Fermi energy of the heterojunction is no longer at the same level in the non-equilibrium state, meanwhile, BlueP and C2N have their own different Fermi levels, namely quasi-Fermi levels. EF-C2N (EF-BlueP) means the quasi-Fermi level of the C2N (BlueP) monolayer in this system. The conduction band offset of the pristine heterojunction without an E-field is denoted by VD. V = Efieldd represents an external electric potential, which can lead to the divergence of the quasi-Fermi level. And the equilibrium interlayer distance d is a constant. When a negative E-field is exerted, the band gap varies as the following function: Eg = Eg(C2N) − e(VD − V) = Eg(C2N) − eVD + eEfield × d(4)In the case of a negative E-field between −0.2 V Å−1 to −0.3 V Å−1, one can see that the CBM (VBM) of C2N is lower (higher) than that of BlueP, the change from type-II to type-I heterojunction occurs, demonstrating that the excited electrons and holes are both confined in the C2N layer which results in the formation of direct excitons. Thus, the maximum band gap can be obtained as:Eg = Eg(C2N) ≈ 1.62 eVUnder circumstances of the E-field strength exceeding −0.3 V Å−1, in the heterojunction both the CBM and VBM of C2N are higher than those of BlueP, triggering the transformation from type-I to type-II band alignment. Then the band gap linearly decreases as:Eg = Eg(C2N) − e(Efield − 0.3)dHowever, with a positive E-field rising, the heterojunction keeps a characteristic type-II band alignment and its band gap maintains a monotonously declining trend. The smooth reduction of the band gap is attributed to the upward EF-BlueP for the BlueP layer and the downward EF-C2N for the C2N layer, as shown in Fig. 5(e), which promotes the transfer of electrons from BlueP to C2N, and the holes moving from C2N to BlueP. More importantly, a more remarkable photogenerated charge separation and collection can be encouraged under the larger band offset across the heterojunction.
Moreover, the external E-field will affect the charge transfer between the BlueP and C2N layers. The averaged charge density difference of the heterojunction at various external E-field strengths is determined as: (5)where ,  are respectively the charge densities of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction at a (x, y, z) point with and without an E-field. Correspondingly, positive values represent charge accumulation while negative values suggest charge depletion at the position. Fig. 6 plots the averaged charge density difference of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction along the Z-direction. On the whole, regardless of the orientation of the E-field, the number of transferring electrons depends on the strength of the exerted E-field. What makes a difference is that the electrons tend to transfer from the C2N layer to the BlueP layer and holes tend to migrate from the BlueP layer to the C2N layer under the circumstance of a reverse E-field, and a forward E-field leads to the opposite direction of negative and positive charge transfer. It is worth noting that when a stronger E-field is exerted, the heterojunction abruptly becomes a metal due to dielectric breakdown and charge tunneling. Similar behavior can also be observed in Sb/InSe and arsenene/C3N heterojunctions.15,56
 Fig. 6  Averaged difference electron density of the BlueP/C2N heterojunction along the vertical direction. 
Furthermore, there is a great necessity to discuss the nature and significance of the transition between type-II and type-I band alignment. The DOS and orbital diagrams of the heterojunction at several vital E-field strengths are illustrated in Fig. 7. If the external E-field adds to 0.2 V Å−1, the VBM and CBM of heterojunction are respectively provided by BlueP and C2N, as seen in Fig. 7(d), which is expressed as a conventional type-II band alignment. The result coincides with that in the pristine equilibrium heterojunction, where the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is localized around the C2N layer whereas the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized mainly around the P atoms. Such a type of band alignment is a prominent method for enhancing electron–hole separation and reducing their recombination time, applicable for light harvesting and detection. In sharp contrast, when the negative E-field reaches −0.2 V Å−1, it is found from Fig. 7(b) that the CBM and VBM of the BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction locate within the C2N layer and manifest a natural type-I band alignment. Also, both the LUMO and HOMO are localized around the C2N layer, which again identifies the type-I feature. Subsequently, the photogenerated electrons and holes of BlueP can be spontaneously transferred to the C2N monolayer, and further ultra-fast recombination of carrier occurs due to the enhanced light–matter interaction in the heterojunction, which is energetically favorable towards LED, semiconductor laser and solar concentrator applications.57 For instance, it has been demonstrated that ReS2 and MoS2 monolayers form a type-I vdW heterojunction. By selectively exciting photocarriers into different layers, it takes about 1 ps for carriers injected in MoS2 transfer to ReS2, while no charge transfer is observed when carriers are injected in ReS2, which provides a new way to utilize 2D materials for light emission applications.58 Thus, the E-field of −0.2 V Å−1 is critical for the band alignment type transformation. Nevertheless, with increasing the negative E-field strength to −0.4 V Å−1, Fig. 7(a) reveals that the C2N layer and the BlueP layer completely occupy the HOMO and the LUMO of the heterojunction, respectively, resulting in a distinct type-II band alignment. As a consequence, a band alignment change from type-II to type-I or type-I to type-II occurs via the negative E-field, and the distinguishing spatially distinct distribution of the lowest energy electrons and holes could be triggered. Since few investigations on type-I C2N-based heterojunctions are reported, our results will greatly enrich the research fields on C2N material and extend its applications to optoelectronic fields.

What is more, it may be difficult to apply a large external positive or negative E-field in experiments. Here, in our work, the intensity of the applied E-field is uniformly rising and declining along the axial direction, along with a uniform distribution among the two components in the system. Although the applied E-field seems extremely large, an electric field of such magnitude is ubiquitous in the atomistic dimension. Hence, our calculated results reveal that the band gap, charge distribution and band alignment of the BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction are dependent on electrostatic gating, providing practical information for its application in multifunctional high-performance nanoscale optoelectronic devices.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have researched the structural stability and electronic properties of a BlueP/C2N vdW heterojunction by performing DFT calculations. The negative binding energy provides robust evidence for the stability of the heterojunction. A unique type-II band alignment with a direct band gap of 1.514 eV is achieved at the BlueP/C2N interface, which ensures the photogenerated electrons automatically move from BlueP to C2N and vice versa for holes. The interfacial Eint further suppresses energy-wasted recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, the band gap of this heterojunction shows a rich behavior through application of a perpendicular external E-field. Fascinatingly, band alignment conversion from type-II to type-I and then to type-II occurs under the influence of a negative E-field, inducing different spatial distributions of the lowest energy carriers. Meanwhile, an increasing number of charges transfer with the increased intensity of the E-field. Our work can bring forward a new perspective for multifunctional devices based on the BlueP/C2N heterojunction with well-controlled E-field strengths.
