    , Accepted 21st April 2018First published on 24th April 2018AbstractAs a pump for extracting carriers from the absorber to the cathode, hole transporting materials (HTMs) play indispensable roles in promoting the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this context, we present two simple HTMs using 2,2′-(1,2-phenylene) bisthiophene or naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene as a π-bridge to link two electron-donor units (4′,4′′-dimethoxytriphenylamine): PBT and NDT. Their frontier molecular orbital energies match well with those of perovskites as is consistent with the DFT calculation results. The PCE measured under mimetic solar illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) increases from 13.6% (PBT) to 18.8% (NDT), which surpass that of the spiro-OMeTAD (18.1%) reference. The modified annulated core in NDT makes it perform better in photovoltaic conversion than PBT. The reason for this is discussed from aspects of hole mobility, charge collection probability (Pc) and recombination kinetics.
Introduction
Based on advantages such as intense light-absorption, narrow exciton binding energy, high charge-carrier mobility, long diffusion lengths, low-cost fabrication and the skyrocketing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted broad attention.1 Historic breakthroughs have been made since the first demonstration on a solid-state PSC in 2012 by Park's group2 with long-term stability and a PCE of 9.7%, and a prominent PCE of 15.0% was demonstrated by Grätzel's group3 in 2013. The best-performing device configuration for PSCs comprises an active perovskite layer sandwiched between an electron transporting material (ETM) and a hole transporting material (HTM), and this is also commonly used in the fabrication procedure of PSCs.4 In addition to intrinsic opto-electronic properties of the perovskite layer, as a pump for extracting carriers from the absorber to the cathode, HTMs play an essential role in promoting the PCEs of PSCs to quickly increase from 3.8 to a certified 22.1%.1a,5
With well-matched frontier molecular orbital energies, sufficient hole mobility, simplicity and convenience in film-fabrication, and good solubility, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene which is abbreviated as spiro-OMeTAD stands out from the crowd, becoming a kind of commercial and the most popular HTM for efficient PSCs.6 For example, Snaith and co-workers7 showed a maximum PCE of 15.4% in 2013, based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx deposited as thin layers with spiro-OMeTAD as the hole conductor, and a PCE as high as 19.3% was reported by Yang and his co-workers8 in 2014. However, complicated synthesis, difficult purification, and environmental instability seriously limit the commercial applications of spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs.9 In such situations, developing low-cost and effective HTMs for PSCs is challenging and has far-reaching significance.10 Recently, lots of simple triphenylamine-based HTMs with a typical donor–π–donor structure employing π-linkers such as thiophene,11 carbazole,12 triazatruxene,13 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene14 and so on have been developed for PSCs. It has been predicted by theoretical calculations that HTMs with planar cores performed better with regard to the PCEs of PSCs than HTMs with no planar cores.15 More than one thiophene derivative16 has been reported to possess higher hole mobility than spiro-OMeTAD, making them promising competitors and alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD.
In the present work, we introduce two simple HTMs using 2,2′-(1,2-phenylene)bisthiophene or naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene as a π-bridge to link two electron-donor units (4′,4′′-dimethoxytriphenylamine) which are denoted as PBT and NDT as shown in Fig. 1. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), hole mobility and opto-electronic properties including PCE, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), photoluminescence (PL) in PSCs, charge collection probability (Pc) and recombination kinetics were found to be intensely related to the different π-bridges between the donor groups. With the annulated core of naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene, NDT tends to stack through strong π–π and O–π interactions and leads to excellent hole mobility and performance in PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Thiophene–triphenylamine based derivatives, PBT and NDT were synthesized through straightforward Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings17 with high yields (for PBT, 68%; NDT, 79%) by binding suitable donor groups (4′,4′′-dimethoxytriphenylamine) to a 2,2′-(1,2-phenylene)bisthiophene or a naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene core (Scheme 1), which can be obtained through a simple synthetic route starting from commercial products, and the synthesis details are in the ESI.† The PBT central core (3, dibrominated derivative) was prepared by Stille cross coupling18 between commercially available 1,2-dibromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzene and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene (Ying kou you xuan Trade Co., Ltd), followed by bromination employing N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). The subsequent dichlorodicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ)/acid-mediated oxidative cyclization19 of compound 3 gives rise to the formation of a π-extended NDT central core under mild synthetic conditions. All the above steps have ideal yields, and the intermediate products can be obtained by sample recrystallization without further purification. The overall yields from compound 1 to PBT and NDT are 55% and 59%, respectively, and the estimated cost is 98.1 and 78.8 $ g−1 for PBT and NDT, respectively, which are much lower than that of the purchased spiro-OMeTAD (≈271.4 $ g−1). The molecular structure of the two new HTMs were confirmed by 1H and 13C (400 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and high resolution mass spectra (HRMS).

X-ray crystallography
More importantly, the single crystal X-ray structure of NDT showing an obvious annulated core has been determined (Fig. 1). Slow volatilization of a CH2Cl2 solution helped us obtain the single crystal of NDT. Crystallographic data for NDT (CCDC 1814908)†: C56N2O6S2, space group P(2), triclinic, a = 11.237(2), b = 12.606(3), c = 19.298(4) Å, α = 90.32°, β = 95.79°, γ = 109.07°, U = 2568.5 (10) Å.
Thermomechanical analysis
In the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data (Fig. 2a) shown, NDT exhibits an excellent thermal stability and starts decomposing at temperatures (Td) at 435 °C, while the Td for PBT is 332 °C. When PBT presents a melting temperature (Tm) of 175 °C (Fig. 2b), the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of NDT reveals a crystalline behavior with a Tm of 213 °C and there is no obvious cooling crystallization temperature (Tcr) in the cooling process (Fig. S1a†).

Experimental and calculated energy levels of HTMs matching with the perovskite
Determination of the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of organic molecules by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is a common and more reliable method.20 As shown in Fig. 2c, the valance band (VB) spectra of PBT and NDT were measured with a monochromatic He I light source (21.2 eV) and a VG Scienta R4000 analyzer. The valence band energies (EVB) corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of PBT and NDT are estimated to be −5.23 and −5.32 eV below the vacuum level, respectively (Table 1), which are coincidentally located between the HOMO of the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, −5.43 eV) and the valence-band maximum of the Au electrode (−5.10 eV), indicating that they have appropriate energy levels to extract the holes from the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) to the Au electrode like pumps. The π-conjugation effect of annulated core in NDT leads to the decrease in EHOMO which is 0.09 eV lower than PBT.21

According to the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 2d (Table 1), films of PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD on ITO substrates show their maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at 367 nm, 386 nm and 384 nm, respectively. We can attribute the bathochromic response in the spectrum to the enhancement of the conjugation in NDT by the annulated core.22 The emission maximum of PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD is located at 482 nm, 502 nm and 421 nm, respectively. The corresponding transition energies which are also called energy gaps (Eg) are estimated to be 2.76, 2.79 and 2.97 eV for PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD respectively, with their absorption edges located at 450, 445 and 417 nm, respectively. Therefore, based on the experimental EHOMO and Eg, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PBT and NDT are calculated to be −2.47 and −2.53 eV (Fig. 2f), which meet the requirement that HTMs' LUMO should be higher than the conduction band edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV). We listed all the experimental and calculated values in Table 1.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to evaluate the HOMOs and LUMOs of the two new HTMs in the theory aspect. As shown in Fig. 2e, the orbital density in the HOMOs of PBT (−4.69 eV) and NDT (−4.72 eV) is delocalized in the whole molecule, whereas the orbital density of the LUMOs of PBT (−1.39 eV) and NDT (−1.42 eV) is mainly localized on the bridge groups. The similar donor–π–donor structure of PBT and NDT leads to their similar orbital density, which agrees with the similarity of photophysical and electrochemical properties.
Photovoltaic conversion
Devices with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au as shown in Fig. 3d were fabricated to investigate the performance of PSCs employing PBT and NDT as the HTM which was measured under 1 sun irradiation, while devices with spiro-OMeTAD were fabricated as the reference. Fig. 3a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (reverse: from 1.2 to −0.2 V) of the PSCs prepared with PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are listed in Table 2. It can be observed that the NDT based device has the best performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 18.7%, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 23.47 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 74%, which are all slightly higher than those of the reference (spiro-OMeTAD with a PCE of 18.1%), indicating that NDT can act as a promising HTM for PSCs. PBT based PSCs show a PCE of 13.6% under the same conditions. The statistical data of the PSCs based on 30 uniform devices with each HTM are shown in Fig. 3c, and the average PCE values of the PSCs employing PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs are 11.03%, 16.25%, and 16.13%, respectively. The average values of JSC, FF, and VOC in Fig. 3c are also listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. S2,†J–V curves of the devices were measured in different voltage scan directions (forward and reverse) with a 20 mV s−1 scan rate. Although they all have a relatively large hysteresis, the hysteresis of the devices based on NDT is the smallest among these three kinds of PSCs, indicating least trap states in NDT-based devices.1d,23 It can be seen that the open-circuit voltages of devices based on different HTMs are quite similar while the performance of the devices employing NDT as the HTM improved remarkably due to the increased JSC and FF.

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the solar cells which are fabricated with PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD are also compared with each other in Fig. 3b. The integrated photocurrent densities of PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD were shown to be 22.66, 21.34 and 16.77 mA cm−2, respectively, which are well consistent with the measured photocurrent density (Table 2). In a broad spectral range from 400 to 750 nm, the IPCE of NDT and spiro-OMeTAD based devices exceeds 75%, and reach a maximum of 85% (600 nm). Conversely, the device employing PBT as the HTM showed a rather poor IPCE (65%). Thus, the enhancement in the JSC and FF of NDT can be attributed to the better optical absorption.24
Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL)
To further explore the advantage of the modified annulated core in NDT on carrier transfer at the perovskite/NDT interface, we measured the continuous wave (CW) photoluminescence (PL, Fig. 3e) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL, Fig. 3f) with the device structure ITO/perovskite/HTM. It is noted that the bilayer of perovskite/NDT shows an estimated dramatic quenching value of 90% while the quenching values of the perovskite/HTM bilayer film are estimated to be 80% and 65% for spiro-OMeTAD and PBT. The comparison of the TRPL decay at 770 nm between the bilayers and the bare perovskite deposited on glass is shown in Fig. 3f. The estimated PL decay time τe values are 15.3 ns for the pure perovskite, 6.1 ns for perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, 12.2 ns for perovskite/PBT and 4.5 ns for perovskite/NDT. The PL and TRPL results demonstrate that the modified annulated core of NDT is beneficial to hole transfer which may promote the PCE of PSCs directly.
Hole mobility analysis
The hole-transport ability of PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique (Fig. 4a) with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au, and the hole mobility was calculated using the Mott–Gurney law.1d,25 For PBT, NDT and spiro-OMeTAD, the thicknesses are 190, 210 and 230 nm. respectively, which are measured using the step profiler. The hole mobility values of different HTMs are summarized in Table 2, and the NDT film exhibits a hole mobility of 4.9 × 10–3 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is much higher than PBT's 9.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 while spiro-OMeTAD exhibits a hole mobility of 4.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The higher hole mobility of NDT can be attributed to its intrinsic crystal structures and layer-by-layer stacking geometry.26 From two adjacent crystal cells of NDT, two π–π stacking with distances of 3.34 Å between two NDT molecules in one cell and two O–π interactions with a distance of 3.56 Å between two close cells are measured (Fig. 3b). This indicates that the annulated core is beneficial to NDT's intermolecular interactions leading to a higher hole mobility, and predicts that NDT could be a kind of effective HTM for high-efficiency PSCs with matching frontier molecular orbital energy.
Charge collection probability (Pc) and recombination kinetics
The higher hole mobility of NDT alone actually can't give an absolute explanation for the better photovoltaic conversion ability than PBT. Thus, under illumination at 100 mW cm−2, we examined charge collection probability (Pc) versus internal voltage (Vint)24 of devices (Fig. 4c) based on NDT and PBT where Pc = Jph/Jph,sat(1) Vint = Vbi − Vapplied(2)in which the photocurrent density Jph = JL − JD (JL and JD are the current density under illumination and in the dark), the built-in potential (Vbi) is the voltage when JL = JD, and the Vapplied is the applied voltage.27 The saturated photocurrent (Jph,sat) is the Jph value when Jph saturates at high Vint (2 V).5aVbi for NDT and PBT based devices is 1.18 and 1.20 V, respectively. The values with no obvious difference in Vbi can be attributed to the similarity in HOMO levels of two HTMs. As shown in Fig. 4c, the better charge extraction of NDT can be judged because the NDT's Pc is 97.5% which is higher than PBT's 93.2% under short-circuit conditions.
Study of the recombination kinetics in HTMs of devices based on different HTMs by measuring JSC and VOC with respect to gradually varied light intensities (from 100 to 1 mW cm−2) on a log–log scale can give us another viewpoint to compare charge extraction or transfer ability of NDT and PBT.28 The dependence of JSC on illumination intensity (I) follows the power law which is generally expressed as JSC ∝ Iα(3)where α = 1 for both PBT and NDT based PSCs, as shown in Fig. 4d, indicating that, under short-circuit conditions, almost all holes are swept out before recombination.5a,27a
As all carriers would recombine in the PSCs under open-circuit conditions, charge recombination near open-circuit conditions is usually researched to reveal the recombination mechanism.27a,29 For the function of VOCversus light intensity on a log–log scale, the slopes for PBT and NDT based PSCs (Fig. 4e) are 1.9 and 1.6 kT/e (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and e is the elementary charge), respectively. The slope values are higher than kT/e, implying that the VOC is highly dependent on light intensity and the recombination includes not only a bimolecular recombination mode but also a monomolecular mode which is defined as Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) through a trap state.30 The slope is much greater than that of NDT-based PSCs, indicating that the monomolecular recombination mode is dominant for PBT-based PSCs at open circuit. This result also demonstrates that less trap states exist in the interface of NDT and the perovskite film which is related to the higher VOC and smaller hysteresis in NDT-based PSCs.5a
Conclusions
We demonstrated two new hole transporting materials in donor–π–donor constitution, PBT and NDT, using 2,2′-(1,2-phenylene)bisthiophene or naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene as a π-bridge to link two electron-rich triphenylamine units (4′,4′′-dimethoxytriphenylamine). They have frontier molecular orbital energies similar to those of the perovskite layer which conforms to the DFT calculation results well. The annulated core of NDT makes it perform better in terms of thermal properties, hole mobility and photovoltaic conversion in PSCs than PBT. The PCE which was measured under simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) increases from 13.6% (PBT) to a marvelous 18.8% (NDT), a value which is superior to the 18.1% of spiro-OMeTAD. Charge collection probability (Pc) of PBT and NDT, and their recombination kinetics by measuring JSC and VOC at various light intensities were also compared to demonstrate that the optimization of π-bridges in HTMs is beneficial to the performance of PSCs by improving charge extraction and hole-transport within the device.
