    , Accepted 5th March 2021First published on 6th March 2021AbstractDue to the excellent electrical and optical properties, few-layered β-indium selenide (InSe) nanosheets are successfully introduced into the active layer of polymer solar cells (PSCs) as the third component for the first time. The addition of few-layered β-InSe nanosheets optimizes the absorption, crystallinity and vertical component distribution of the active layer. Compared with the binary devices, the ternary devices exhibit optimized bulk morphology and reduced charge recombination. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs based on the PM6 : Y6 system is obviously improved from 15.02% to 16.56% due to the increasing short-circuit current and fill factor. The mechanism accounting for the morphological change in the ternary active layer is investigated in depth. Moreover, the efficacy of β-InSe in long-term stability and other active layer systems of PSCs is confirmed. Therefore, this work demonstrates that few-layered β-InSe has bright prospects in photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
In recent years, a tremendous advance in polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved due to the progress of molecular design, interface engineering, device architecture and the modification of bulk and interfacial morphology.1–6 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have exceeded 17% for both single-junction and tandem devices.7–9 However, the narrow absorption window of organic semiconductors results in insufficient absorption coverage and hinders the further development of device performance.10 Although tandem devices can solve this problem, its cumbersome fabrication process impedes its wide applicability.11 In order to broaden the optical absorption spectrum while maintaining the simplicity of the device process, ternary PSCs have emerged.9 It is remarkable that the blend of (2,2′-((2Z,2Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,50]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) (Y6) and its derivatives boosts the PCE of ternary PSCs. Significant PCEs of 17.4% and nearly 18% were achieved in ternary PSCs by employing Y6 and its derivatives as a blend acceptor and taking their advantages together.9,12 Moreover, a variety of materials, such as small molecules and polymers, have been added to PSCs as the third component to enhance the device performance.13–15 Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with exotic electrical and optical properties, flexibility and thickness-dependent band gap, are also strong competitors for the third component of active layers.16
2D materials, including graphene, black phosphorus (BP), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), etc., have shown great potential in the field of optoelectronics devices, such as solar cells, LEDs, and photodetectors.17–19 Recently, β-InSe (indium selenide), with a 2D layered structure, has attracted wide attention due to its excellent properties. Its layers, composed of four covalently bonded monoatomic sheets (Se–In–In–Se), are packed closely via van der Waals interactions.20 InSe has three crystal phases donated as ε, β and γ phases.21 Few-layered ε-InSe exhibits an indirect band gap, while few-layered γ-InSe and few-layered β-InSe have a direct band structure.21,22 Therefore, ε-InSe is not suitable for addition to the active layer. Notably, few-layered γ-InSe and β-InSe have a similar band gap value and mobility.23 However, the intrinsic instability of γ-InSe hinders its practical application either in electronics or optoelectronics.20,21 Thus, β-InSe is chosen in this work. Compared with other common 2D materials, InSe has unique advantages in the third component of active layers. InSe has small electron effective mass and ultrahigh mobility. Its mobility reaches 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which is higher than that of many reported 2D materials, such as BPs and TMDs.20,24 Furthermore, β-InSe has an excellent extinction coefficient and thickness-dependent band gap, which evolves from 2.11 eV for the monolayer β-InSe to 1.26 eV for the bulk β-InSe.24,25 The band gap of the few-layered β-InSe nanosheet (6–7 layers) is about 1.4 eV, which approaches the ideal value (1.34 eV) for solar energy conversion, as seen from the Shockley–Queisser analysis.20,26,27 Although the mobility of graphene and BP is also high, the former has no band gap, and the latter exhibits worse environmental stability than InSe and a band gap of 1.73 eV for the monolayer and 1.15 eV for the bilayer, which are relatively far from 1.34 eV.20,28 Interestingly, there is a crossover of an indirect-to-direct band gap when the β-InSe thickness is larger than 6 layers.26 These properties indicate that the few-layered β-InSe is an excellent candidate for the third component of active layers. To be compatible with the roll-to-roll process, liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) is used to obtain the few-layered β-InSe nanosheets. It is reported that the commonly used solvents to exfoliate 2D materials, such as dimethylformamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, have a high boiling point and low vapor pressure. They easily remain on the surfaces of the exfoliated nanosheets to form an insulating organic layer, which is harmful to the electrical properties of the exfoliated materials.26 Thus, isopropanol (IPA) with a low boiling point is chosen to exfoliate bulk β-InSe.
The morphology of active layers is a crucial factor that affects the performance and long-term stability of PSCs.29–31 However, the understanding of ternary morphology is nascent, especially the effect of 2D materials on the morphology of active layers.11 The influence mechanism of 2D materials on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is complicated. Even for the same material, the nanosheets with different thicknesses and lateral sizes will have different effects on the BHJ morphology. Huang et al. reported that Bi2OS2 could facilitate the crystallization and phase separation of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T): 3,9-bis(2-methylene(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno-[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) blend films. Also, a favourable vertical morphology of the active layer induced by Bi2OS2 was observed.32 Yang et al. reported that black phosphorus (BP), with a diameter of 60–100 nm and an average thickness of ∼3 nm, promoted the phase separation in the PTB7-Th : PC71BM blend and resulted in a more ordered mesostructure.35 Kim et al. reported that graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, with the thickness of ∼1 nm and different lateral dimensions, induced the formation of aggregated morphology in PTB7 : PC71BM blend films and an over-aggregated morphology was observed after inducing large-sized GO.34 Therefore, it is critical to study in depth and rationally control the morphology of ternary active layers with 2D materials. Notably, previous reports mainly focused on the effect of 2D materials on the horizontal BHJ morphology, and only limited research explored their influence on the vertical morphology.32–40 Thus, the effect of few-layered β-InSe nanosheets on the morphology of the active layer, including horizontal and vertical morphology, will be deeply investigated in this study.
In this work, few-layered β-InSe nanosheets, which are obtained by LPE in IPA, are introduced into PBDB-T:ITIC blend films. Compared with the binary devices, β-InSe-processed devices show a higher short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) due to the enhanced absorption and more desired morphology of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe films. The mechanism of the morphological evolution is then explored in depth. β-InSe nanosheets as the nucleation centers facilitate the crystallization and phase separation of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe films by heterogeneous nucleation. Besides, β-InSe nanosheets with a low surface energy incline to gather on the ternary active layer/air surface, and attract more PBDB-T to crystallize around it, which may be due to the strong interaction between them, resulting in the enrichment of PBDB-T on the surface. Then, the favorable vertical component distribution reduces the limitation of the PBDB-T fibrous network to the crystallization of ITIC and further strengthens the crystallinity of ITIC. Notably, the poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PM6):Y6:β-InSe-based devices are fabricated, and a champion PCE of 16.56% is obtained. Moreover, long-term stability of the ternary devices is improved because of the more stable BHJ morphology enabled by the PBDB-T fibrous network.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
The bulk β-InSe (>99.95%) was bought from Nanjing MKNANO Tech. Co., Ltd. Chlorobenzene (CB), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), chloroform (CF) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PBDB-T and ITIC were supplied by Luminescent Technology, Inc. Y6 and PM6 were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. All purchased materials were used as received.
2.2. Exfoliation of the bulk β-InSe
LPE method was used to exfoliate the bulk β-InSe. Briefly, 30 mg of the bulk β-InSe was pulverized in an agate mortar and then added to IPA with the concentration of 3 mg ml−1. The hybrid solution was ultrasonicated (CLISON-M1, Dongguan Hongshun Automation Equipment Co., Ltd) for 6 hours, keeping the bath temperature below 25 °C. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to exclude thick β-InSe nanosheets (in a TGL-16C centrifuge, Shanghai Anting Scientific Instrument Factory). Then the supernatant was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min and the precipitate was dried and redispersed in CB and CF, respectively.
2.3. Fabrication of the devices
The device structure of PSCs with an inverted configuration was composed of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The ITO glasses were cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, IPA and ethanol sequentially in an ultrasonic bath and then dried in an oven. The cleaned ITO substrates were then treated by a 14-minute oxygen plasma. Next, ZnO sol–gel solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrates and then annealed at 200 °C for 60 min to obtain an electron transport layer with a thickness of ∼30 nm. PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1 by weight, 20 mg ml−1 in total) was dispersed in CB with different amounts of β-InSe nanosheets and an additive of DIO (0.5%, v/v). The resulted PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe solution was spin-cast at 2500 rpm for 60 s on the ZnO film. The thicknesses of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe films were about 100 nm. For the PM6:Y6 system, PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 by wt, 16 mg ml−1 in total) was dissolved in CF solution containing different amounts of β-InSe nanosheets with a solvent additive of CN (99.5:0.5 by volume). Then, the PM6:Y6:β-InSe films (∼150 nm) were obtained by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. At a vacuum level of 2 × 10−6 mbar, a hole transport layer MoO3 (10 nm) and 100 nm Ag were thermally evaporated, respectively, under a shadow mask onto the active layers. The active area of all the devices was 0.15 cm2. A single aperture mask was used to define the total active area of 0.11 cm2.
2.4. Characterization and measurements
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, GeminiSEM 500) was performed to observe the layered structure of the bulk β-InSe. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum was recorded using a Bruker Advance diffractometer. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of β-InSe nanosheets and PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe films were obtained using a JEOL-2100F electron microscope. Raman spectra were recorded using the Renishaw InVia Raman microscope, excited by a 532 nm laser. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD analytical system. Absorption spectra were measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (HP 8453). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve was recorded on a CHI630E electrochemical workstation with glassy carbon, Ag/AgCl and platinum electrode as working electrode, reference electrode and auxiliary electrode, respectively. The electrolyte used was 0.1 M TBAP/CH3CN. A small amount of the β-InSe solution was dropcast on the glassy carbon electrode and then dried for the following CV measurements. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a SPEX 1681 automated spectrofluorometer. The thicknesses of β-InSe nanosheets and the morphology of the active layers were determined using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (SPM, Bruker MultiMode 8). Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured by Xenocs with a mode of Xeuss 2.0. The scattered X-rays were detected by a Pilatus3R 1M detector. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using an LCP system. J–V curves were obtained under an AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Keithley 2400 source meter). A SRF50 system was used to record the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra.
3. Results and discussion
XRD measurements are used to identify the crystal structure of the bulk β-InSe and the XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1a. These diffraction peaks correspond to the JCPDS card of β-InSe (34-1431), confirming the high purity of the bulk sample. The layered structure of the bulk β-InSe is observed from the SEM images (Fig. S1†). Based on the report by Petroni et al., LPE method is used to exfoliate the bulk β-InSe in IPA.41 The resulted nanosheets are characterized by Raman spectroscopy, XPS, AFM and TEM. The Raman spectra of the bulk β-InSe and the β-InSe nanosheets are shown in Fig. 1b. Three Raman modes of  (115 cm−1), E′(Γ13)-TO&E′′(Γ33) (176 cm−1) and  (225 cm−1) are observed in the bulk β-InSe. For β-InSe nanosheets, two additional peaks of A′′2(Γ11)-LO (201 cm−1) and E′(Γ13)-LO (209 cm−1) appear, which indicates that the bulk β-InSe is exfoliated successfully.24 The XPS spectra of In 3d and Se 3d for the exfoliated nanosheets are displayed in Fig. 1c and d. Four peaks located at 53.8, 54.6, 444.5 and 452.1 eV correspond to Se 3d5/2, Se 3d3/2, In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2, respectively.42 Compared with the bulk β-InSe (Fig. S2†), the broadening in the width (FWHM) of In 3d and Se 3d peaks are less than 0.2 eV, suggesting that only a small amount of oxides and defects are introduced during the exfoliation process.26 As seen in the AFM image (Fig. 1e), the β-InSe nanosheets show a typical lateral dimension of ∼110 nm and thicknesses in the range of 5.2 nm to 6.3 nm. It is reported that the thickness of the monolayer β-InSe is ∼0.9 nm, thus the resulted nanosheets are few-layered (6–7 layers).26 As depicted in Fig. 1f, an exfoliated β-InSe nanosheet shows a horizontal size, which is similar to that observed in the AFM image (Fig. 1e). The AFM and TEM images show the β-InSe nanosheets with a lateral dimension of 100–150 nm. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the β-InSe nanosheet is shown in Fig. S3.† The SAED image indicates that the crystalline structure of the β-InSe nanosheets do not change during LPE.26 All the measurements indicate that high-quality few-layered β-InSe nanosheets are successfully obtained.

The monolayer crystal structure of β-InSe and the chemical structure of PBDB-T and ITIC are shown in Fig. 2a. To investigate the energy level alignment of the used materials in the active layer, the energy levels of the β-InSe nanosheets are studied by CV (Fig. S4†). Based on the equations: EHOMO = 4.71 + Eox (eV) and ELUMO = 4.71 + Eed (eV), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the nanosheets are 5.29 eV and 3.93 eV, respectively. Because the unobvious reduction peak at ∼−0.6 V is attributed to the intrinsic property of the glassy carbon electrode, the Eed is −0.78 V instead of −0.6 V.43 Calculated by the above data, the band gap of the few-layered β-InSe is 1.36 eV, which is consistent with a previous report.26 As depicted in Fig. 2b, the HOMO level of the few-layered β-InSe is close to that of PBDB-T (5.33 eV), and its LUMO level is similar to the LUMO level of ITIC (3.92 eV), which suggests that holes and electrons may transfer from ITIC and PBDB-T to β-InSe, respectively. To explore the charge transfer between β-InSe and PBDB-T or ITIC, PL measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 2c, neat PBDB-T shows a strong PL peak located at ∼680 nm, and a significant reduced PL intensity is observed after the addition of the few-layered β-InSe. Besides, the PSCs with PBDB-T:β-InSe (0, 0.05 wt%, 0.1 wt% and 0.3 wt%) as active layers are fabricated and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S5a.† The Jsc values of PBDB-T:β-InSe-based PSCs increase monotonically with the increase of the β-InSe content. However, the PL intensities of neat ITIC and ITIC:β-InSe are almost the same (Fig. S5b†). These results demonstrate that charge transfer occurs between β-InSe and PBDB-T and the charge transfer between β-InSe and ITIC can be negligible (Fig. 2b).44–46 Thus, the β-InSe nanosheets can transport charge carriers selectively to reduce charge recombination.

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of these three components are shown in Fig. 2d. The β-InSe film shows strong absorption in the short-wavelength region, which is complementary with the absorption of PBDB-T and ITIC. The absorption spectra of PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe films with different concentrations of β-InSe nanosheets are shown in Fig. 2e. The thicknesses of all the measured films are nearly 100 nm. As the doping concentration increases, the absorbance in the short-wavelength region increases monotonously, which is attributed to the absorption of the few-layered β-InSe. It is reported that the peaks at 635 nm and 700 nm correspond to the ordered aggregation of PBDB-T and the crystallized ITIC, respectively.47 Compared with the PBDB-T:ITIC binary film, the characteristic peaks of PBDB-T and ITIC in the ternary films with enhanced intensities demonstrate the increased crystallinity of PBDB-T and ITIC. The above conclusion can be further verified by Fig. S6.† As seen in Fig. S6a and S6b,† β-InSe nanosheets strengthen the absorption intensities of the characteristic peaks of PBDB-T and ITIC, respectively.
To evaluate the effect of the few-layered β-InSe as the third component on device performance, PSCs with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe/MoO3/Ag are fabricated. The schematic illustration and energy levels of the fabricated devices are shown in Fig. 2b. Fig. 3a shows the performances of PSCs with different concentrations of β-InSe nanosheets and the detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. The binary device presents a PCE of 10.12%, with a Jsc of 16.53 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.90 V and a FF of 68.03%. As the additive ratio of β-InSe increases, the photovoltaic parameters of the devices first increase monotonically, and then decrease at the highest concentration (0.5 wt%). The optimal device (0.3 wt%) shows a PCE of 11.59%, with a similar Voc of 0.91 V and increased Jsc (16.53 mA cm−2) and FF (71.29%). Because the Voc in PSCs mainly depends on the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor, the similar Voc may be attributed to the similarity of the HOMO (−5.29 eV) and LUMO levels (−3.93 eV) of the few-layered β-InSe to the HOMO level (−5.33 eV) of PBDB-T and the LUMO level (−3.92 eV) of ITIC, respectively. The corresponding J–V characterization without light illumination is displayed in Fig. 3b. Compared with the binary device, the devices with the few-layered β-InSe show reduced leakage current, increased rectification ratio and thus better diode characteristics, which contribute to the enhanced Jsc and FF. The enhanced Jsc can be further confirmed by the EQE spectra (Fig. 3c). The ternary devices show higher EQE values in a wide wavelength region compared with the reference device. The calculated Jsc by integrating the EQE curves are in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V characterization (Table 1).

To explore the universality of β-InSe as the third component in PSCs, few-layered β-InSe nanosheets are added to the PM6:Y6 system. PM6:Y6:β-InSe-based PSCs with different β-InSe concentrations are fabricated. As shown in Table S1,† the optimal doping concentration in the PM6:Y6 system is also 0.3 wt%. The J–V curves of the devices based on PM6:Y6:β-InSe (0 and 0.3 wt%) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 3d and Table 1, respectively. Compared with the PM6:Y6-based device (15.02%), the β-InSe-processed device shows a significant PCE (16.56%) mainly due to the enhanced Jsc (from 24.71 mA cm−2 to 25.96 mA cm−2) and FF (from 73.35% to 76.53%). Similarly, the Voc of both devices are almost the same. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectra (Fig. 3e) are 23.86 mA cm−2 for the PM6:Y6-based devices and 25.03 mA cm−2 for the PM6:Y6:β-InSe-based (0.3 wt%) devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with the Jsc values from the J–V curves. Therefore, few-layered β-InSe nanosheets can also be successfully applied in other material systems.
The morphology of active layers, including the horizontal and vertical morphology, plays a vital role in device performance. Firstly, the horizontal morphological change of the active layer induced by the few-layered β-InSe is explored. As shown in Fig. 4a, the pristine PBDB-T:ITIC film shows poor phase separation and does not form an efficiently connected network for charge transportation.47 With the increasing additive ratio of β-InSe (Fig. 4b–e), the PBDB-T fibers (bright region) become thicker and thicker, indicating the increasing crystallinity of PBDB-T. The PBDB-T fibers form a high-quality continuous network to facilitate the hole transportation in the films. As reported, the enhanced crystallinity of the active layer will drive the phase separation, thus PBDB-T with increasing crystallinity strengthens the degree of phase separation.48,49 The optimal device (0.3 wt%) with proper phase separation achieves a good balance between a large interface for exciton dissociation and continuous conductive paths, and thus exhibits enhanced Jsc and FF. However, severe phase separation is detected in the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.5 wt%) films with excessive crystallinity of PBDB-T, which reduces the interfacial area for exciton dissociation. Therefore, the device performance degrade. Moreover, the increasing root-mean-square roughness (RMS) from 3.03 nm for the PBDB-T:ITIC film to 4.15 nm for the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.3 wt%) film is attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of PBDB-T and the introduction of β-InSe nanosheets. The moderately enhanced RMS in the ternary films (0.3 wt%) enlarges the contact area between the active layers and the transport layers, which may facilitate the charge transportation. A leap in the RMS from 4.15 nm (0.3 wt%) to 5.32 nm (0.5 wt%) is also observed. The ternary film (0.5 wt%) with the largest RMS will introduce more charge recombination centers and lead to severe charge recombination.36 To further observe the phase separation in the active layers, TEM images are obtained. As shown in Fig. 4f, the PBDB-T:ITIC film shows an unobvious phase separation with dim phase boundaries. The increasing degree of phase separation in the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe ternary films can be observed in Fig. 4g–j. The optimal and the unreasonable phase separation are obtained in the films with 0.3 wt% and 0.5 wt% β-InSe, respectively, which are consistent with the results of AFM images.

To further study the crystalline order of the active layers, GIWAXS measurements are performed. The 2D GIWAXS patterns of PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0, 0.3 wt% and 0.5 wt%) and the corresponding out-of-plane (qz) and in-plane (qr) line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 5a–d. For the neat PBDB-T:ITIC film, the (100) lamellar stacking peaks of PBDB-T at 0.30 Å−1 both in in-plane and out-of plane profiles and the π–π stacking peak of PBDB-T at qz = 1.66 Å−1 are observed.50 However, only unobvious diffraction signals of ITIC in the in-plane profile are detected, which are consistent with the earlier reports which indicated that the crystallization of ITIC will be restricted by PBDB-T.47,51 After the addition of β-InSe, the π–π peaks of PBDB-T show enhanced intensity and shift to a larger q, demonstrating a tighter π–π stacking and more preferential face-on orientation of PBDB-T. To further analyze the crystalline packing in the active layers, crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) are calculated (Table S2†).45,46 The CCLs of the π–π stacking peaks of PBDB-T increase from 2.27 nm (0%) to 2.39 nm (0.3 wt%) to 2.56 nm (0.5 wt%), which confirms the enhanced face-on orientation of PBDB-T in the ternary films. Besides, the CCL of the in-plane (100) peak of PBDB-T in the PBDB-T:ITIC film is 8.89 nm, while the peaks in the ternary film (0.3 wt%) and the ternary film (0.5 wt%) show larger CCLs of 10.26 nm and 12.38 nm, respectively. The sharper lamellar peak of PBDB-T and the emergence of an in-plane lamellar peak of ITIC at qr = 0.42 Å−1 suggest that β-InSe nanosheets enhance the lamellar stacking of PBDB-T and ITIC.52 The more preferred face-on orientation of PBDB-T and the enhanced stacking of both PBDB-T and ITIC facilitate the charge transportation in the PSCs (0.3 wt%).52 While the excessive accumulation of PBDB-T and ITIC in the devices (0.5 wt%) will degrade the device performance. The results of GIWAXS are in accordance with the conclusion obtained from AFM that the few-layered β-InSe facilitates the crystallization and aggregation of PBDB-T.

Apart from the horizontal nanoscale morphology, the vertical morphology of the active layer also strongly influences the device performance. In order to investigate the effect of β-InSe nanosheets on the vertical composition distribution of the active layer, water contact angles (WCAs) of neat PBDB-T, neat ITIC, PBDB-T:ITIC and PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.3 wt%) are measured. The variation of WCAs of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0 and 0.3 wt%) films can intuitively reflect the alteration of the distribution of PBDB-T and ITIC because of the different surface free energies between them.53 If the WCA of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe film is close to that of the single-component (PBDB-T or ITIC) film, the content of this component on the film surface will be higher. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the WCAs of neat PBDB-T and ITIC are 108.31° and 98.33°, respectively. Notably, the WCA increases from 100.9° (Fig. 6c) for PBDB-T:ITIC to 103.44° (Fig. 6d) for PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.3 wt%), indicating the enrichment of PBDB-T molecules on the surface of the ternary film due to the β-InSe addition. For PSCs with an inverted configuration, the donor-rich surface of the active layer can suppress charge recombination, facilitate hole collection and thus enhance Jsc and FF.

XPS is also conducted to detect the surface compositions of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0 and 0.3 wt%) films. Because only ITIC has nitrogen and PBDB-T does not, the S 2p/N 1s ratio is used to estimate the degree of PBDB-T enrichment on the surfaces of PBDB-T:ITIC films.49 As seen in Fig. S7a, b and Table S3,† a higher S/N ratio (10.61) for the ternary film (0.3 wt%) is obtained compared to that (5.74) for the PBDB-T:ITIC film. The enhanced S/N ratio further confirms that PBDB-T enriches on the surface of the ternary film.
Based on the above observation and discussion, we propose a mechanism accounting for the effect of few-layered β-InSe on the morphology of the ternary active layer (Fig. 7a and b). Previous reports have shown that solid additive and 2D materials can facilitate the crystallization of the components in active layers by heterogeneous nucleation.36,40 Thus, β-InSe nanosheets with a large surface area can act as the nucleation center to induce crystallization of PBDB-T and ITIC (Fig. 7b). Moderate amount of the few-layered β-InSe (0.3 wt%) facilitates the crystallinity of PBDB-T and ITIC reasonably and the optimal phase separation is obtained. However, an excess of β-InSe nanosheets (0.5 wt%) leads to over-aggregation of the donor and acceptor. The severe phase separation of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.5 wt%) film breaks the balance between the large interface area for exciton dissociation and the continuous conductive paths, so the device performance degrades. Moreover, the cause of the optimized vertical composition distribution induced by β-InSe nanosheets is investigated. Firstly, the surface energy of the few-layered β-InSe is calculated by the Owens method.4 The images of the contact angles on β-InSe films are shown in Fig. S8† and the parameters are listed in Table S4.† The water and oil contact angles on β-InSe films are 79.72° and 46.58°, respectively, and the surface energy is 37.28 mN m−1. The surface energy of the few-layered β-InSe (37.28 mN m−1) is lower than that of PBDB-T (42.59 mN m−1) and much lower than that of ITIC (47.37 mN m−1).54 As reported, ZnO has higher surface energy than PBDB-T and ITIC.4 Thus, ITIC tends to aggregate on the surface of ZnO due to their closer surface energy, while both β-InSe and PBDB-T with lower surface energy are inclined to gather on the active layer/air surface.4 In the aforementioned PL measurements (Fig. 2c and Fig. S5†), a conclusion is obtained that charge transfer exists between β-InSe and PBDB-T and is weak or even absent between β-InSe and ITIC. This phenomenon may be attributed to the stronger interaction between β-InSe and PBDB-T than that between β-InSe and ITIC. The interaction between 2D materials, such as BP, GO and graphdiyne, and the components of active layers is also reported by other groups.34,38,40 Therefore, the β-InSe nanosheets which incline to gather on the surface of the active layer will attract more PBDB-T molecules and facilitate the crystallization of PBDB-T, leading to the enrichment of PBDB-T on the surface of the active layer (Fig. 7b). Due to the asymmetry of the molecular structure of PBDB-T and ITIC, the crystalline network of PBDB-T will hinder the molecular diffusion and crystallization of ITIC (Fig. 5a).47 However, the desired vertical composition distribution in the ternary films induced by β-InSe nanosheets leads to a purer phase of ITIC, reduces the limitation of PBDB-T to the crystallization of ITIC and further facilitates the crystallization of ITIC (Fig. 7b).55 In conclusion, there are two main effects of β-InSe nanosheets on the morphology of the ternary film. Firstly, β-InSe promotes the crystallization and crystallinity-induced phase separation of the active layer. Secondly, the formation of a more desired vertical phase distribution in the ternary film, which may be due to the strong interaction between β-InSe and PBDB-T, further facilitates the crystallization of ITIC.

To gain more insight into the effect of few-layered β-InSe on the enhanced device performance, exciton dissociation dynamics, charge carrier mobility and charge recombination kinetics are investigated. Firstly, TRPL spectroscopy is performed to measure the exciton lifetime (τexc). Fig. 8a exhibits the TRPL curves of PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe films (0 and 0.3 wt%). The PL decay data are fitted by double exponential function.56 Compared with the calculated τexc of PBDB-T:ITIC (0.64 ns), the shorter τexc (0.50 ns) of PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.3 wt%) indicates more efficient exciton dissociation in the ternary films, which may be because the β-InSe nanosheets with a large surface area provide an additional PBDB-T/β-InSe interface for exciton dissociation.57 As mentioned (Fig. 2c), there is a charge transfer between PBDB-T and β-InSe nanosheets, which can support the above discussion to a certain extent.

The relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) is determined (Fig. 8b) to explore the variation of charge generation and dissociation in ternary PSCs. According to the previous reports, the saturated photogenerated current density (Jsat), Jph under maximum output power condition (Jmax), maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), charge collection efficiency (Pcoll = Jmax/Jsat) and exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss = Jsc/Jsat) are calculated and listed in Table S5.†58,59 The Gmax values for different devices are 1.184 × 1028 (0%), 1.198 × 1028 (0.05 wt%), 1.208 × 1028 (0.1 wt%), 1.219 × 1028 (0.3 wt%) and 1.205 × 1028 (0.5 wt%), respectively. The enhanced Gmax of the ternary devices is attributed to the enhanced absorption of the PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe films. Compared with the Pcoll of the binary devices (74.95%), enhanced Pcoll values are observed in the ternary devices. The highest Pcoll (82.01%) of the devices (0.3 wt%) suggests that the optimized BHJ morphology facilitates the charge collection.59 The Pdiss increases from 87.28% for the devices with PBDB-T:ITIC to 91.49% for the devices with PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.3 wt%), which is consistent with the results of TRPL measurements. The enhanced charge generation rate, charge collection efficiency and exciton dissociation probability contribute to the higher Jsc and FF of the ternary devices.58
The space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method is used to measure the charge carrier mobility in PSCs (Fig. 8c and d). The hole-only devices and electron-only devices, with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe/Ca/Al, respectively, are fabricated. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) are listed in Table S6.† The addition of β-InSe increases the μh and μe and makes the mobility more balanced compared with the binary devices (μh = 3.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe/μh = 0.61). On the one hand, β-InSe nanosheets with high mobility improves the charge carrier mobility in the active layer. On the other hand, the enhanced crystallinity and molecular stacking of PBDB-T and ITIC contribute to the enhanced charge carrier mobility. The optimal morphology is obtained in the device with 0.3 wt% β-InSe nanosheets with the most balanced μe/μh (0.81), and the highest μh (5.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (4.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) that can facilitate charge transportation and reduce the accumulation of space charge, while the device (0.5 wt%) with over-aggregated PBDB-T and severe phase separation exhibits reduced charge carrier mobility.36
The charge recombination kinetics of the devices with and without β-InSe is further explored by determining the variations of Jsc and Voc at different light intensities (P). The relationship between Jsc and P follows a power-law dependence: Jsc ∝ Pα, where α is an exponential factor. The closer α is to 1, the less the bimolecular recombination in the devices under short-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. S9a,† the values of α are 0.964, 0.971, 0.979, 0.984 and 0.975 for the devices with different β-InSe additive ratios of 0, 0.05 wt%, 0.1 wt%, 0.3 wt% and 0.5 wt%, respectively. The larger values for the ternary devices indicate reduced bimolecular recombination in these devices due to the higher and well-balanced charge carrier mobility. Besides, the donor-rich surface of the ternary films can also reduce charge recombination at the interface of the anode and the active layer. Under open-circuit conditions, all the photogenerated charge will recombine, and the slope of Voc–P curve is an important parameter to investigate the recombination mechanism.60 The slope is close to 1 kT/q, indicating that bimolecular recombination is the dominant recombination mechanism in these devices. In contrast, trap-assisted recombination becomes dominant when the slope value approaches 2 kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. As can be seen in Fig. S9b,† the device with PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0.3 wt%) shows a slope of 1.12 kT/q, which is lower than that of the reference devices (1.26 kT/q). The lower slope demonstrates the reduced trap-assisted recombination due to the addition of β-InSe nanosheets.
The long-term stability of PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe-based PSCs is also explored. The PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe-based (0 and 0.3 wt%) devices are stored in a N2-filled glove box. As shown in Fig. 9a–d, the binary device shows 20% degradation in PCE after 138 days with a largely decreased FF and a slightly reduced Jsc. After the addition of the few-layered β-InSe, the ternary device (0.3 wt%) displays superior stability and maintained 89% PCE after the same time. After aging, the Voc in both reference and ternary devices is nearly unchanged. The morphological evolution in the active layer is one of the two reasons for the intrinsic degradation of PSCs.61 The optimal BHJ morphology corresponding to the best device performance is usually not the thermodynamically steady condition at equilibrium. So the optimal morphology will gradually degrade to the equilibrium condition.61 More interestingly, many groups recently proposed that the evolution of BHJ morphology is the root cause of the burn-in loss in PSCs.62–64 Therefore, the morphology of PBDB-T:ITIC:β-InSe (0 and 0.3 wt%) films after storing for 138 days is detected. As seen in Fig. S10a–d,† PBDB-T distributes randomly in the PBDB-T:ITIC films, while the obvious PBDB-T fibrous network still exists in the ternary films. The reduction in the PCE, with decreased Jsc and FF and a nearly unchanged Voc, is largely due to the morphological degradation of the active layer.29 Compared to the binary films, the stable PBDB-T fibrous network in the ternary films stabilizes the BHJ morphology, thereby reducing burn-in loss and improving device stablility.55

4. Conclusion
In summary, few-layered β-InSe nanosheets are introduced into PBDB-T:ITIC blend films as the morphological modifier. The optimized crystallinity and morphology in the ternary BHJ contribute to enhanced light harvesting, efficient exciton dissociation, high mobility and reduced charge recombination. Therefore, the optimal ternary devices exhibited an increase in the PCE (11.59%), with enhanced Jsc (16.53 mA cm−2) and FF (71.29%), compared with the reference devices (10.12%). Based on the results of multiple characterization methods, a mechanism about the morphological change is proposed. The inhomogeneity of β-InSe results in improved crystallinity and prominent phase separation in the ternary active layer. In addition, β-InSe nanosheets, which incline to aggregate on the surface of the active layer, result in the enrichment of PBDB-T around them, which may be due to the strong interaction between PBDB-T and β-InSe. This desired vertical component distribution reduces the limitation of PBDB-T to ITIC crystallization. Also, the long-term stability of the modified device is improved due to the fibrous PBDB-T network. Moreover, the β-InSe nanosheets are applied into the PM6:Y6 systems and a significant PCE of 16.56% is achieved. Therefore, it is worthwhile and necessary to further explore the application of various nanosheets in the active layer.
