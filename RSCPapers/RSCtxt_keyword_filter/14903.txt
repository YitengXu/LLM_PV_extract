    , Accepted 3rd April 2017First published on 4th April 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with mixed organic cations and/or halides have attracted increasing attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties, which are tailorable for different applications. To obtain a deeper understanding of materials properties, single crystals are regarded as the best platform among various building blocks for fundamental study. Here, we synthesized a series of perovskite single crystals with mixed organic cations (APbI3, A = CH3NH3+, MA+; or CH(NH2)2+, FA+) along the compositional space, and conducted a systematic investigation to correlate the carrier behavior with the organic cations. The single crystals were synthesized via inverse temperature crystallization assisted by hydroiodic acid, where the quality of the crystals could be judiciously controlled by the thermodynamic process. It is found that the substitution of 15% MA+ in FAPbI3 single crystals stabilizes the phase with the best charge transport characteristics. Both photodetector and J–V measurements suggested that FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 single crystal exhibits suppressed ion migration compared with the counterpart FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 single crystal. These results represent an important step to highlight the role of organic cations in hybrid perovskite materials, which will further benefit fundamental understanding of materials and device optimization.
Introduction
Due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been widely studied in applications such as solar cells,1,2 photodetectors,3,4 and lasing devices.5 Recently they have attracted even more interest among the research community with regard to ion migration6 and degradation in hybrid perovskites,7,8 which are believed to affect their practical use in optoelectronics. To further understand these materials, high-quality single crystals appear to be the ideal model to be exploited, in terms of their structural, chemical, and especially optoelectronic properties that determine device performance. In particular, it is of great interest to study the ABX3 single crystals with appropriate ion substitution on the A and/or X site, whose counterparts as polycrystalline films (e.g. MAPbI3) have delivered the most promising device performance in solar cells.2,9,10
APbI3 materials (A = CH3NH3+, MA+; or CH(NH2)2+, FA+) feature optimal bandgap, high absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime and diffusion length, which are suitable for photovoltaic application. With respect to single crystals, early work has been focused on the prototype materials of MAPbI3, which have been successfully synthesized via various approaches, such as the temperature-lowering method11 in HI solution, the antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization12,13 and the inverse temperature crystallization14,15 methods. Thanks to the high-quality MAPbI3 single crystals, the understanding of the dynamic behavior of MA+,16 thermal conductivity,17 charge generation dynamics,18 and other optoelectronic properties has been achieved.12,14,19 Subsequently, the synthesis of FAPbI3 single crystals and the fundamental materials understanding were further exploited. The Bakr group20,21 synthesized both FAPbI3 and FAPbBr3 single crystals via the inverse temperature crystallization method, and studied the corresponding carrier dynamics. Meanwhile, the Yang group22 synthesized FAPbI3 single crystals through a modified inverse temperature crystallization method, and investigated the photoconductivity and photo-response in the corresponding photodetector. Apart from carrier behavior, the phase stability of APbI3 single crystals is also crucial for practical use. Particularly, FAPbI3 single crystals are intrinsically unstable at room temperature. It was found that a phase change from the black perovskite phase to the yellow non-perovskite phase occurred spontaneously in ∼7 days, which arose from the crystal bulk. However, attempts to study the relationship between stable phase and optoelectronic properties of mixed organic cation perovskite single crystals have been rarely documented.23 There is still lacking a systematic study of the most efficient mixed perovskite to ensure excellent charge transport in hybrid perovskites with intrinsically stable phase, particularly FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 in terms of structural, chemical and optoelectronic properties. Moreover, it is essential to reveal the relationship between the A cation substitution ratio and the resultant materials properties in quantitative analysis, like phase stability, carrier behavior, grain boundary properties, as well as ion migration. These findings are believed to be able to help guide the future materials design for mixed perovskites.
In the work reported in this paper, we developed a novel hydroiodic acid (HI)-assisted inverse temperature crystallization method to synthesize a series of single crystals of FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0–0.2, 0.8–1). A variety of characterization techniques were subsequently employed to study the structural and optoelectronic properties of the resultant single crystals with varied cation substitution, including powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction (PXRD and SCXRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). The mobility of representative single crystals was further confirmed by space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements, and the balanced electron–hole mobility was confirmed for APbI3 (A = MA+ or FA+). For single crystals over the entire compositional space of interest, FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 single crystals exhibited the best carrier mobility in each series. Moreover, relieved ion migration in FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 was observed. Accordingly, FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 single crystal-based photodetectors have been fabricated, and the corresponding photoconductivity and photoresponse are discussed. This work demonstrates an excellent platform to study hybrid perovskite single crystals with mixed organic cations, ranging from synthesis and phase property to carrier behavior.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of APbI3 single crystals with mixed cation
In a typical synthesis, given amounts of MAI and/or FAI and PbI2 were dissolved in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), with the addition of an appropriate amount of HI. A series of APbI3 single crystals were subsequently obtained by elevating the solution temperature. The pioneering work on the inverse temperature crystallization method was conducted by the Bakr group.14 The corresponding mechanism for perovskite single crystal growth simply follows a thermodynamic pattern, where ABX3 complex exhibits higher binding energy than the ABX3 precipitate and is thus favored for crystallization. In our experiment, the modified growth process for single crystals is shown in Fig. 1A. Different from the previously reported work, here HI was introduced to the precursor solution to change the chemical environment of the precursor solution where octahedral PbI2 existed.24 It is well known that HI interacts with undissolved PbI2 in the form of polyiodide as follows:25,26 PbI2 + xI− → PbI2+xx− (x = 1, 2). The edge-sharing PbI6 octahedral framework was interrupted13,27 and then the H+, MA+, FA+ and GBL molecules inserted between the PbI2+xx− layer to form APbX3–GBL complex. Upon heating, the ABX3–GBL complex dissociated to form perovskite nuclei followed by the growth of single crystals with remaining ABX3–GBL complex as reservoir.28 During this crystallization process, the amount of HI for the synthesis of APbI3 should be carefully controlled. This is because the addition of I− in the precursor could affect the concentration of the ABX3–GBL complex and ABX3, which results in the fluctuation of crystal nucleus density and consequently the crystal growth kinetics at a certain temperature. With an appropriate amount of I− in the precursor solution, single crystals with a wide range of composition could be readily obtained from the high-temperature solution (90 °C to 100 °C). When an excess amount of HI was added, it initiated the formation of a large amount of nuclei by the introduction of xA+–PbI2+xx−–GBL complexes, leading to final single crystals with small sizes.

Based on the above HI-assisted inverse temperature crystallization method, we successfully obtained FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 single crystals with ten compositions: x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1. All crystals are of millimeter size, as shown in Fig. 1B. SCXRD measurements were performed on three selected compositions, namely FAPbI3 (Fig. S1†), FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 (Fig. 2E), and FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 (Fig. 2F). At the same time, the crystal data and structure refinement for FAPbI3, FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 and FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 are listed in Table S1.† This confirms the single-crystal nature of our samples, further indicating the effectiveness of the present method compared with other developed methods.14,22,29 Particularly, the modified HI-assisted growth method, inherited from the concept in polycrystalline film formation,24 may provide an approach to increase carrier mobility in the resultant single crystals, which will be discussed in the following paragraph.

Single crystals were ground into powder to characterize their crystalline phase by PXRD, as shown in Fig. 2A to D. All samples possess pure perovskite phase, except for the FAPbI3 crystal by exhibiting an additional diffraction peak of PbI2 at 12.8°,13 which resulted from the high hygroscopicity of FA cation.30Fig. 2A depicts the XRD patterns of FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0–0.2), where the diffraction peaks at 13.9° and 28.1° can be assigned to the (001) and (002) peaks of cubic FAPbI3, respectively.22 The (001) peak represented in Fig. 2B shifted to higher diffraction angle along with the increase of the MA cation ratio in the precursor solution, which was due to the reduction of lattice parameters in the crystals upon the partial substitution of FA+ by MA+. In contrast, Fig. 2C and D present the XRD patterns for FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.8–1) samples. Interestingly, FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.9–1) are assigned to the tetragonal phase, and FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.85) are assigned to the cubic phase, which are consistent with the literature.21,23 The presence of cubic perovskite phase for the FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.85) crystals implies that certain substitution of MA+ by FA+ could stabilize the cubic phase at room temperature. We further studied the long-term phase stability of FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 single crystals, where the products were stored in a N2-filled glovebox for 2 months. At low MA+ ratio, the fresh black single crystals of FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0, 0.05) turned yellow, indicating the phase transformation from perovskite phase to non-perovskite phase. At high MA ratio, however, FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) retained its perovskite phase. It was reported that the higher dipole moment of MA cation is able to form stronger hydrogen bonds with the inorganic framework as compared to FA cation, which increases the Madelung energy to stabilize the phase.31 Therefore we concluded that 10–20% and 80–85% molar ratio of MA+ in FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 precursor solution could improve the cubic perovskite phase stability of the corresponding single crystals at room temperature.
To further investigate the ratio of MA+/FA+ cations in the FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 single crystals, 1H NMR study of single crystals was conducted by dissolving the obtained crystals in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) solvent (Fig. S2†). The 1H NMR spectra of FAPbI3 single crystal and MAPbI3 single crystal are shown in Fig. S2A and B† as reference. Fig. S2C and D† show that the ratio of the CH group to the CH3 group was 9:1 and 1:9 for FA0.9MA0.1PbI3 and FA0.1MA0.9PbI3 single crystals, respectively, which was consistent to the ratio of FAI to MAI in the precursor solution within the margin of error. Based on the NMR characterization, we confirmed that the ratio of FA+ to MA+ in the precursor solution represented the real ratio in the final perovskite single crystals.
To investigate the transport property of perovskite single crystals, we estimated the carrier lifetime of fresh perovskite single crystals by using TRPL measurements. All the PL spectra of perovskite single crystals could be fitted by biexponential decays (Fig. 3) and the corresponding lifetimes are summarized in Table 1, including the fast and slow components. Generally, the slow component represents bimolecular recombination from direct band-to-band electron–hole recombination,12 and the fast component arises from surface recombination.12,21 Therefore, the slow component of the carrier lifetime was further used to characterize the bulk property of the obtained single crystals. It was found that the carrier lifetime of FAPbI3 single crystal (839.31 ns) was dramatically longer than that of MAPbI3 (145.65 ns) single crystal. However, all the FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.8–0.9) single crystals showed longer carrier lifetime than that of the FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.1–0.2) ones, indicating the exceptional FA+ doping effect in the MAPbI3 system. Interestingly, the carrier lifetime of FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.8–0.95) single crystals was significantly increased compared with the counterpart MAPbI3 single crystal, which confirmed the effective FA+ cation doping in the MAPbI3 crystal with respect to the carrier behavior. It is well recognized that semiconductor materials with a higher degree of electronic disorder could contribute to shorter photoluminescence lifetime, resulting in lower solar cell efficiency.32 Taking into account both the characteristics of carrier behavior and phase stability, we selected FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 to further investigate the fundamental charge transport property. The PL emission spectrum and absorption spectrum of FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 are displayed in Fig. S3.† The PL emission peaks for FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 are centered at 827 nm and 807 nm respectively, without phase segregation. The cut-off absorption wavelength is 872 nm and 851 nm, respectively, suggesting a bandgap of 1.42 eV and 1.46 eV for FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.15MA0.85PbI3. And we have noticed that solar cells based on mixed cation perovskites with these compositions exhibited most useful power conversion efficiency recently, which is worthy of investigation.10

The carrier mobility of the perovskite single crystals was obtained according to the SCLC theory.15,29,33 Current–voltage (I–V) curves of hole-/electron-only devices in the dark were measured in air (Fig. 4A–E). Indium (In)/perovskite single crystal/In devices were measured for electron-only devices, and Au/perovskite single crystal/Au for hole-only devices. Each I–V curve of the perovskite devices showed three distinctive stages. At low bias voltage, carriers from the perovskite materials contribute the current, which leads to a linear relationship of I–V indicative of the ohmic region. When the bias voltage increases, the current increases in a different pattern, where the injected carriers start to fill the traps and reach the trap-filled limit (TFL). When the bias voltage further increases, the current shows a linear relationship with the square of the voltage (I ∝ V2). We thus obtain mobility from the Mott–Gurney law: , where ε, ε0 and L are the relative dielectric constant, the vacuum permittivity and the thickness of perovskite single crystal, respectively. We adopted ε of 46.9 for FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 single crystal22 and 32 for FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 single crystal.29 The estimated hole mobility and electron mobility were 5.31 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 10.19 cm2 V−1 s−1 for FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 single crystal, respectively. While for FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 perovskite single crystal, the hole mobility and electron mobility were 0.60 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.77 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Both FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 and FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 single crystals possess balanced hole and electron mobility, respectively, which is in good agreement with reported results.34,35 Of note, the carrier mobility of FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 was higher than that of FA0.15MA0.85PbI3, suggesting their different effective mass due to the organic cation ratio difference. This is also in line with another report that FAPbI3 had higher mobility than MAPbI3.36 Interestingly, the hole mobility of FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 grown without HI was 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4E), smaller than that of its counterpart grown with HI. This indicates that the HI addition helps to improve the quality of as-prepared single crystals, which possibly resulted from the change in the crystal growth kinetics due to improved solubility of precursor solution. In addition, we measured the hole mobility of FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 in a vacuum (Fig. 4F). The measured hole mobility was calculated to be 17.12 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was significantly larger than that in air (0.60 cm2 V−1 s−1). We speculated that the atmosphere could interact with the perovskite materials and subsequently affect the formation of surface defects of the materials.

The ion migration of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites would affect their stability and the stable power output of the corresponding solar cells. The dark J–V measurement is often employed to probe the ion migration contribution from the intrinsic defects in perovskite crystals.37 Here, we measured the dark current hysteresis of Au/perovskite/Au planar devices with different storage times. The fresh FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 device showed more severe I–V hysteresis than the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device (Fig. 5A). FA+ is reported to possess larger ion movement barrier than MA+ in APbI3 crystals, and the substitution of MA+ by FA+ can effectively prohibit the cation migration and thus lead to relieved hysteresis.38 Interestingly, when both devices were stored in air with 70% humidity for 24 h, the severity of current hysteresis was increased in the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device, while that of FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 was small (Fig. 5B). Given that both single crystals had stable crystalline phase, we speculated that the more hygroscopic nature of FA cation made the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 material more susceptible to moisture. The change of hysteresis behavior in the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device occurred within a short storage time of 24 h, which indicates that the carrier behavior of perovskite materials is closely related to the environment, e.g. oxygen, humidity. Therefore, it suggests that the exploration of APbI3 compositions is crucial to ultimately find perovskite materials with less environmental dependence of carrier behavior.

The photoresponse of perovskite single crystals (Fig. 6A) was further investigated under different illumination intensities varying from 0 to 91.2 mW cm−2. The photoelectric characteristic of FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 photodetector (Fig. 6B) was different from that of FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 (Fig. 6C). The dependence of photocurrent on the illumination intensity under a bias voltage of 1 V is compared in Fig. 6D. Both photodetectors delivered larger current under stronger illumination, because more carriers were excited with more incident photons. But they followed different dependence relationships. We fitted the dependence with power law Iph ∝ Pα, where α is correlated with the response of photocurrent to the light intensity. Generally, a different α value represents a different recombination process within a semiconductor.39 For the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 photodetector (α = 0.48), a square-root relationship of current dependence on light intensity indicated that carrier loss was dominated by bimolecular recombination.40 While for the FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 photodetector (α = 0.91), current had a nearly linear dependence on light intensity resulting from monomolecular recombination.41 We further studied the response of both photodetectors at a bias voltage of 2 V under the different incident illumination wavelengths from 300 nm to 1000 nm (Fig. S4A†). The FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 device had nearly the same responsivity in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm, while the responsivity of the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device increased with increasing wavelength in this range. This is likely due to the influence of surface traps with respect to the responsivity toward incident light with different wavelength. It was reported that photons with short wavelength had a shallow penetration depth, which generates carriers near the surface to be affected by the surface traps and thus the photocurrent collection efficiency at short wavelength. With an increase of photon wavelength, the carriers generated far away from surface are less affected. It is inferred that FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 exhibits fewer surface traps and consequently invariant responsivity with respect to different input wavelength. The responsivity of FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm clearly indicates the impact of surface defects that could be induced during the measurement possibly due to the hygroscopic nature of FA cation. Finally, we compared the photoresponse of both devices to white light (91.2 mW cm−2) under 0.05 Hz on/off frequency (Fig. S4B†). The FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device had lower dark current and larger photocurrent than the FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 device, indicating its improved optoelectronic property. The rise time for the FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 device was shorter than that for FA0.15MA0.85PbI3, which is in accordance to the hysteresis loops measurement (Fig. 5).

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically synthesized FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0−0.2, x = 0.8−1) single crystals by the HI-assisted inverse temperature crystallization process. With a combination of NMR, XRD, PL and SCLC measurements, the structural and optoelectronic properties of single crystals were thoroughly investigated. The mixed organic cations help to improve the cubic phase stability, e.g. FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.1–0.2, x = 0.8–0.85). The carrier lifetime of FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 (x = 0.8–0.95) was significantly improved compared with MAPbI3, and FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 single crystal exhibited higher electron/hole mobilities than FA0.15MA0.85PbI3. It was also observed that the single crystal grown with HI had larger mobility than that grown without HI, and the measured mobility was dependent on the environment. Additionally, FA0.85MA0.15PbI3 single crystal presented less dark current hysteresis than FA0.15MA0.85PbI3 single crystal, which was reversed when stored in a high humidity condition. This study provides an insight into the significance of mixed FA and MA cations in terms of phase stability, carrier transport and ion migration behavior of perovskite. Future effort will be focused on the doping effect that could further advance the structural property and optoelectronic property, which will benefit solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
