    , Accepted 24th June 2019First published on 28th June 2019AbstractResearch on the efficient synthesis and application of nanostructured perovskite oxides is attracting intensive attention nowadays. Herein, a silver (Ag) nanoparticle decorated A-site deficient perovskite is prepared using a facile exsolution method and used as a cathode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Ag nanoparticle modified (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3−δ composite (e-LSAM) prepared by the exsolution method displays exceptional activity for the electrocatalytic triiodide (I3−) reduction reaction (IRR) in DSSCs, which is much superior to that of the Ag/perovskite hybrids synthesized by physical mixing and impregnation methods due to the strong interfacial interaction and small Ag particle size. DSSC with this newly developed heteroelectrocatalyst shows a high photovoltaic efficiency of 12.4%, surpassing that of the expensive platinum (Pt)-based control cell (9.93%) with an enhancement factor of 25%, which is among the highest performances of Pt-free cathodes reported to date. Moreover, this new composite cathode shows a much superior IRR durability to Pt, indicating its great potential for replacing Pt. This study paves the way for the rational design of active and durable perovskite electrocatalysts for various energy conversion and storage systems.
Introduction
Electrocatalysis plays a vital role in various energy conversion and storage devices such as photoelectrochemical cells, water electrolyzers and metal–air batteries.1–3 Thus, the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts is critical to facilitate the development of the above electrocatalysis-based applications.4–6 The electrocatalytic reduction of triiodide (I3−) to iodide (I−) acts as the basis in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which are typically composed of a dye-sensitized photoanode, an I3−/I−-based electrolyte, and a cathode (also called the counter electrode, CE).7–9 Notably, reduction of I3− to I− (IRR) is governed by the properties of the cathode.9,10 In DSSCs, platinum (Pt) is the most widely investigated CE due to its superior electrocatalytic activity and conductivity.11 However, its scarcity, high price, and poor durability in the I3−/I−-based electrolyte greatly limit the widespread application of DSSCs.12 Thus, the development of inexpensive alternatives with high activity and robust durability is extremely essential. The most promising candidates for this substitution include metal oxides, carbon-based materials, conductive polymers and metal sulfides/selenides.13–18
Among the various Pt-free electrocatalysts, perovskite oxides with an ABO3 formula have attracted intensive attention for many electrocatalysis-based applications including fuel cells, batteries, sensors, water splitting and photoelectrochemical cells due to their unique structure and fascinating properties.19–22 More specifically, Shao-Horn et al. demonstrated that a Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) perovskite displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, which even outperforms noble-metal-based IrO2.23 Our group has also demonstrated perovskite oxides as high-performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, showing activity comparable to that of the Pt benchmark.24,25 Recently, Cao et al. and our group reported the use of perovskite oxides as cathodes in DSSCs and achieved comparable or even higher IRR activity relative to Pt.14,22,26 However, perovskite oxides as cathodes always suffer from poor intrinsic activity, low surface area, and inferior conductivity. Due to the structural, compositional, and chemical flexibility of perovskite oxides, the conductivity can be enhanced by selective and functional doping at the A-site and B-site.27,28 The problem of low surface area can be addressed by the construction of nanostructured perovskite oxides such as nanoparticles (NPs) and nanofibers (NFs).29,30
Silver (Ag) nanoparticle catalysts, a substitute for Pt/C, are considered as a good electrocatalyst with a more affordable price for the CO2 reduction reaction at room temperature.31 Ag has also been used as a cathode in DSSCs, having a superior performance to Au due to the enhanced light absorption capability and increased electrical conductivity.32 However, Ag still displays a much inferior electrocatalytic performance to Pt.33 In addition, Ag can be added to perovskite oxides as a promoter to improve the intrinsic activity of perovskite oxides.34,35
To obtain better electrocatalytic performance, it is reasonable to develop new catalyst configurations which couple the advantages of different electrocatalysts. Based on the above analysis, the combination of Ag NPs and perovskite scaffolds may be a useful strategy to solve the problems associated with the use of perovskite oxides as cathodes in DSSCs such as poor intrinsic activity, limited active sites, and low conductivity. Furthermore, the surface modification of perovskites offers possibilities to produce synergistically active sites for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, we develop a high-performance composite electrocatalyst for the IRR in DSSCs by a facile exsolution route. Ag is first doped into the A-site lattice of the parent perovskite  during the synthesis process. Metallic Ag is then exsolved under reducing conditions from the perovskite scaffold, forming NPs firmly attached on the surface of the remaining A-site deficient perovskite (A1−xBO3−δ). The e-LSAM composite, which is derived from the (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Ag0.05MnO3−δ (LSAM) perovskite precursor, represents a new synergistic composite electrocatalyst for the IRR in DSSCs. The preparation of the e-LSAM hybrid by exsolution is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a.

A strong interfacial interaction between reduced A-site deficient (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3−δ (r-LSM-A) and exsolved Ag NPs (20–30 nm) is observed in the e-LSAM composite, which efficiently enhances the IRR activity. Due to the strong interfacial interaction and small Ag particle size, e-LSAM exhibited a superior IRR activity to the physical mixtures of micro Ag/r-LSM-A and nano Ag/r-LSM-A as well as the Ag/r-LSM-A hybrid prepared by the impregnation method (IMP). The e-LSAM heterostructured electrocatalyst showed a much superior IRR activity to reduced La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (r-LSM) and r-LSM-A due to the enriched active sites (Ag NPs and oxygen vacancies) for the IRR. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.4% was obtained for a DSSC with an e-LSAM-based cathode and a C101 dye under simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G), which is much superior to that of Pt (9.93%) with a PCE enhancement factor of 25%. Furthermore, the e-LSAM electrocatalyst showed an excellent electrochemical stability for the IRR. This work may provide a new way for the design of earth-abundant, active and stable nanostructured perovskite-based electrocatalysts for the IRR in DSSCs, which can be easily extended to other electrocatalysis-based applications.
Experimental
Materials preparation
LSM, LSM-A, LSAM, (La0.8Ca0.2)0.95Ag0.05MnO3−δ (LCAM) and (La0.8Ca0.2)0.95MnO3−δ (LCM) powders were prepared via an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)–citric acid complexing sol–gel route.36 The as-obtained black solid precursors were then calcined at 800 °C for 5 h in air to acquire the desired perovskite structure. r-LSM, r-LSM-A, e-LSAM, e-LCAM and r-LCM were obtained by reducing LSM, LSM-A, LSAM, LCAM and LCM in 10 vol% H2–Ar at 320 °C for 1 h, respectively. Commercial microsized Ag and nanosized Ag powders were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, which were physically mixed with the r-LSM-A perovskite to produce micro Ag/r-LSM-A and nano Ag/r-LSM-A composites, respectively. The Ag/r-LSM-A (IMP) composite was prepared by an impregnation process. An appropriate amount of silver nitrate solution was impregnated into the LSM-A powder under stirring with a subsequent aging process (5 h, room temperature). After drying, the mixture was calcined at 450 °C in air for 2 h and then reduced in 10 vol% H2–Ar at 320 °C for 1 h to obtain the Ag/r-LSM-A (IMP) composite. In all the silver metal-containing catalysts, the Ag amount was kept at ∼2.3 wt%. The porous TiO2 microspheres were synthesized by an acetic acid-based solvothermal process, and were used as the photoanodes in DSSCs.37 The physical properties of the TiO2 microspheres are shown in Fig. S1† and mixed phases of anatase TiO2 and TiO2(B) were found in TiO2 microspheres with a diameter of 2–3 μm and a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of ∼150 m2 g−1.
DSSC assembly and photovoltaic measurement
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (8 Ω per square, 2.2 mm thick) substrate was pre-washed with acetone, deionized water and ethanol by ultrasonication. The perovskite electrocatalysts were mixed with the as-received conductive multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a weight ratio of 50:50 by ultrasonication. For the preparation of cathode films, the cathode material was mixed with 5 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in ethanol by ultrasonication and the suspension was sprayed on the FTO substrate. The fabrication of N719 dye-based DSSCs has been reported in our previous work.26 For the C101 dye-based DSSC, the photoanode layer was immersed into a C101 dye solution and then washed with acetonitrile and dried in air.38 Commercial Pt nanoparticle-coated FTO was applied as the benchmark for the testing of perovskite-based cathodes and the Pt cathode was activated at 400 °C for 30 min in air prior to the solar cell tests. The I3−/I−-based electrolyte composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in an acetonitrile/valeronitrile mixture (85:15, vol%) was injected into the space between the electrodes through the capillary effect.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were examined on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired by a Zeiss 55VP instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images were acquired by a FEI Tecnai G2T20 electron microscope and a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN field emission TEM with an EDX spectroscopy, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD system. BET specific surface area of TiO2 microspheres was obtained on a Micromeritics TriStar II instrument. The room-temperature electrical conductivities of various perovskite oxides were measured in air using the four-probe direct current (DC) technique. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) stability test was conducted at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in a three-electrode system with an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation.26 Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were obtained using symmetrical cells by a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) with frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 100 kHz. An acetonitrile/valeronitrile-based electrolyte mentioned above was used in the symmetrical cells. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs were obtained by an OAI source meter (Model 230-1A) and an OAI's Trisol solar simulator (300 W Xe Arc Lamp) providing sunlight with AM 1.5 G spectral distribution (100 mW cm−2). The effective area of DSSC was 0.090 cm2, which was well controlled by a square mask. The thicknesses of nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and the TiO2 microsphere layer were around 8 and 30 μm, respectively, as shown in Fig. S2.†
Results and discussion
We first investigated the exsolution behavior of Ag NPs from the LSAM perovskite under a reducing atmosphere. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of LSAM and e-LSAM samples. Phase-pure LSAM displayed a rhombohedral perovskite structure with a space group of 3h. For e-LSAM, metallic Ag peaks were also found apart from the LSM perovskite phase, demonstrating the successful exsolution of Ag from the LSAM perovskite lattice. In addition, XPS was used to investigate the surface valence states of the Ag element. As shown in Fig. 1c, the Ag 3d peak of e-LSAM showed an obvious positive shift compared with that of LSAM, further confirming the reduction of cationic Ag to metallic Ag by exsolution. The nano/microstructure of LSAM and e-LSAM was investigated by SEM as depicted in Fig. 1d–f. The surface of LSAM was smooth without any NPs (Fig. 1d) while some NPs with a diameter of ∼20 nm were found on the surface of e-LSAM (Fig. 1e and f).
TEM, high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF), STEM and EDX were employed to obtain more information about the nano/microstructure and composition of e-LSAM (Fig. 2). It was shown that some Ag NPs (∼20–30 nm) were exsolved and attached on the surface of the r-LSM-A scaffold. As shown in Fig. 2c, uniform distributions of La, Sr and Mn elements but a different agglomerated Ag distribution were observed. These results suggest that metallic Ag NPs (∼20–30 nm) were formed on the surface of r-LSM-A by exsolution. Based on the particle–substrate interface for exsolved Ag NPs as shown in Fig. 2b, we found that Ag NPs were socketed into the perovskite substrate, indicative of a strong interfacial interaction between Ag NPs and the substrate introduced by the exsolution process.

The IRR activities of r-LSM, r-LSM-A and e-LSAM are studied from J–V curves in DSSCs as depicted in Fig. 3a. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of DSSC are summarized in Table S1.† The device based on the e-LSAM cathode produces a Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.713, and a PCE of 8.16%, which is much higher than those of r-LSM and r-LSM-A (5.04% and 5.97%, respectively). It should be noted that the PCE of the DSSC with the e-LSAM cathode reached 92.7% of that of Pt, which is superior to those of r-LSM and r-LSM-A (59.1% and 68.0%) and other pure perovskite oxide cathodes (14.9% for LaNiO3, 45.1% for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3−δ, 75.0% for La0.65Sr0.35MnO3, 77.6% for SrRuO3/SrTiO3 and 6.65% for Bi4Ti3O12).22,26,39–41

The superior IRR activity of e-LSAM to r-LSM and r-LSM-A was further confirmed from the Tafel polarization curves of dummy cells with a configuration of CE/electrolyte/CE. These three perovskites showed the same phase structures and similar microstructures (Fig. S3 and S4†) except for the Ag phase and Ag NPs in e-LSAM, suggesting a reliable investigation of the effect of Ag exsolution on the IRR activity. The extrapolated intercept of the cathodic region denotes the exchange current density (J0) as shown in Fig. 3b and Table S2.† A large J0 guarantees a low charge transfer resistance and a high catalytic activity.42,43 For the three perovskite-based CEs, the J0 decreased in the order e-LSAM > r-LSM-A > r-LSM and the Rct-Tafel values were 1.25, 1.02 and 0.73 Ω cm2 for r-LSM, r-LSM-A and e-LSAM, respectively. Furthermore, the joint point of the Tafel curve with the y-axis indicates the limited current density (Jlim), which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient (D) of I3− in the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3b and Table S2,† it was found that the Jlim followed the sequence e-LSAM (3.08 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) > r-LSM-A (2.34 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) > r-LSM (2.07 × 10−5 cm2 s−1). Thus, e-LSAM possessed the highest triiodine diffusion capability among the three tested perovskite CEs. Furthermore, e-LSAM displayed comparable Rct-Tafel and D values to Pt (0.64 Ω cm2 and 3.36 × 10−5 cm2 s−1), indicating the superior IRR activity of e-LSAM. Note that the D value of the Pt benchmark was similar to that reported in the literature,44,45 suggesting a reliable comparison of the diffusion coefficients of various cathodes in this study.
EIS was further used to investigate the interfacial resistances in a symmetrical cell configuration at 0 V and the Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 3c. A low charge transfer resistance (Rct-EIS) value suggests rapid charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface.46 Based on the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 3c, the calculated Rct-EIS values of r-LSM, r-LSM-A, e-LSAM and Pt cathodes were 1.80, 1.48, 0.98 and 0.88 Ω cm2, respectively, which are consistent with the tendency of Rct-Tafel values. The lower Rct values of e-LSAM than those of r-LSM and r-LSM-A were beneficial for charge collection and the reduction in the charge loss at the cathode/electrolyte interface.
The e-LSAM composite derived from the LSAM perovskite displays high IRR activity, which stimulates us to investigate the origins of this beneficial effect. Based on the literature, low metal valence states and oxygen vacancies in metal oxides play crucial roles in catalyzing the IRR.26,47,48 Therefore, the oxidation states of Mn ions in r-LSM, r-LSM-A and e-LSAM were investigated by XPS and the Mn 2p XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3d. As can be seen, Mn ions existed as a mixture of Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+. Based on the fitting results, the average Mn valence states of r-LSM, r-LSM-A and e-LSAM were 3.19, 3.24 and 3.13, respectively. Thus, the oxygen vacancy concentrations on the surface of r-LSM, r-LSM-A and e-LSAM were calculated to be 0.01, 0.05 and 0.11, respectively. In addition, the electrical conductivity of perovskite oxides also plays a critical role in the electrocatalytic activity.49 The average room-temperature conductivities of r-LSM, r-LSM-A and e-LSAM were found to be 72, 58 and 98 S cm−1, respectively. It is well accepted that a higher oxygen vacancy concentration is often accompanied by a lower electrical conductivity due to the blocking effect on electron hopping.50,51 As a result, r-LSM-A with more oxygen vacancy displayed a lower electrical conductivity than LSM-A. It is interesting that e-LSAM with the highest oxygen vacancy concentration also showed the largest electrical conductivity, which can be assigned to the presence of Ag NPs with a plasmonic effect52 and the strong interaction between Ag and the substrate for enhancing the charge transfer capability (conductivity). These results suggest that the much superior IRR activity of e-LSAM is attributed to the high oxygen vacancy concentration, Ag NPs, enhanced charge transfer capability and strong interaction between Ag NPs and the perovskite substrate.
The IRR activity of the cathode in DSSCs is indicated by the PCE and FF, which are important parameters to describe the IRR process. The FF was reported to be very relevant to the conductivity of the cathode and a higher conductivity generally leads to a larger FF value.53–55 In our previous work, we developed two perovskite oxide-based cathodes with the same phase structure and similar oxygen vacancy concentration but different electrical conductivities for DSSCs namely SrCo0.95P0.05O3−δ (SCP) and SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3−δ (SCN).56 Due to the much larger electrical conductivity of SCP than SCN (274 vs. 27.5 S cm−1), the DSSC with the SCP cathode showed a much higher FF than that with the SCN cathode (0.587 vs. 0.102). In this study, the DSSC with the e-LSAM cathode displayed a higher FF value than that with r-LSM and r-LSM-A as shown in Fig. 3a and Table S1,† which can also be assigned to the higher electrical conductivity of e-LSAM (98 S cm−1) than r-LSM and r-LSM-A (72 and 58 S cm−1). In addition to the electrical conductivity, the number of active sites of perovskite oxides also plays a critical role in the FF value of DSSCs.26 A DSSC with the LaNiO3/carbon black cathode prepared by ball milling with a higher number of active sites (oxygen vacancies) showed a larger FF value than those with the LaNiO3/carbon black cathode prepared by ultrasonication (0.671 vs. 0.623).26 The above results suggest that the higher FF value of the DSSC with the e-LSAM cathode than those with r-LSM and r-LSM-A can be attributed to the higher number of active sites (oxygen vacancies) and higher electrical conductivity of e-LSAM.
For comparison, micro Ag/r-LSM-A and nano Ag/r-LSM-A electrocatalysts prepared by a physical mixing method as well as the Ag/r-LSM-A hybrid prepared by the impregnation method were also investigated. The XRD patterns of micro Ag/r-LSM-A, nano Ag/r-LSM-A and Ag/r-LSM-A (IMP) electrocatalysts (with the same content of Ag as e-LSAM) are shown in Fig. S5.† SEM images of commercial micro Ag, nano Ag and three Ag/r-LSM-A composites are shown in Fig. S6.† As shown in Fig. 4a and Table S3,† the DSSC with e-LSAM CE showed a higher PCE than those with micro Ag/r-LSM-A, nano Ag/r-LSM-A and Ag/r-LSM-A (IMP) as CEs, suggesting the better IRR activity of e-LSAM due to the enhanced charge transfer and triiodine diffusion capability (Fig. 4b and Table S4†). These results suggest that the Ag nanostructure/particle size and strong interfacial interactions in e-LSAM play a key role in enhancing the IRR activity. The impregnation of Ag in r-LSM-A and the physical mixing of r-LSM-A and Ag led to weaker interactions between the components and a lower electro-activity was obtained.57

To further enhance the IRR activity, MWCNTs were added to the e-LSAM electrocatalyst. For comparison, pristine LSAM was also studied in the same way. A DSSC with a e-LSAM/MWCNTs CE yielded a much larger PCE of 10.7% compared with that with LSAM/MWCNTs (8.41%) as shown in Fig. 5a and Table S5,† suggesting the significant role of exsolved Ag NPs in the IRR even with the addition of highly conductive MWCNTs. Furthermore, the PCE of the DSSC with the e-LSAM/MWCNTs CE outperformed that with Pt with a performance enhancement factor of 22%, indicating an exceptional IRR activity of e-LSAM/MWCNTs. To study the IRR kinetics of LSAM/MWCNTs, e-LSAM/MWCNTs and Pt CEs in DSSCs, triiodine diffusion coefficients and charge transfer resistances were investigated from Tafel curves and EIS spectra as shown in Fig. 5b, c and Table S6.† As can be seen, the D value of e-LSAM/MWCNTs was 4.05 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, which was 27% and 20% higher than those of LSAM/MWCNTs and Pt, respectively. Based on the Tafel curves in Fig. 5b, the J0 values of LSAM/MWCNTs, e-LSAM/MWCNTs and Pt CEs were 19.5, 25.1 and 19.9 mA cm−2 and their Rct-Tafel values were calculated to be 0.65, 0.51 and 0.64 Ω cm,2 respectively. EIS was further used to investigate the interfacial resistances in a symmetrical cell configuration at 0 V and the Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5c. Based on the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 5c, the calculated Rct-EIS values of LSAM/MWCNTs, e-LSAM/MWCNTs and Pt cathodes were 0.96, 0.65 and 0.88 Ω cm2, respectively, which is consistent with the tendency of Rct-Tafel values. The relatively low Rct values of e-LSAM/MWCNTs were advantageous for charge collection and the reduction in the charge loss at the CE/electrolyte interface. The above results suggest that the superior IRR activity of e-LSAM/MWCNTs to Pt and LSAM/MWCNTs is assigned to the better triiodine diffusion and charge transfer capability.

(e) The comparison of performance with typical active Pt-free cathodes for I3−/I−-based DSSCs. 
It is interesting to note that as shown in Fig. 5a and Table S5,† the DSSC with the e-LSAM cathode showed a higher FF than that with the LSAM cathode even when the cathode was incorporated with a sufficient amount of highly conductive MWCNTs (50 wt%), which can be attributed to the intrinsic conductivity of e-LSAM (98 S cm−1), superior to that of LSAM (83 S cm−1). This suggests that the internal conduction pathway in the perovskite oxide with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity is critical for the achievement of high IRR activity, even with the addition of a sufficient amount of highly conductive MWCNTs to exclude the effect of external conduction pathways on the DSSC performance. The higher FF achieved by e-LSAM/MWCNTs than LSAM/MWCNTs in this study is consistent with the reported results in our previous work, in which the DSSC with the SCP/MWCNTs cathode displayed a larger FF value than that with SCN/MWCNTs (0.764 vs. 0.735) due to the higher electrical conductivity of SCP by providing the internal conduction pathways.56
The enhancement in the PCE of DSSCs was also observed for another Ru(II)-based dye (C101), which is one of the most efficient dyes in DSSCs.58,59 The performance of DSSCs with the C101 dye using Pt and e-LSAM/MWCNTs as the cathodes is shown in Fig. 5d and Table S7.† The DSSC with the e-LSAM/MWCNTs cathode demonstrated a superior PCE to Pt with an enhancement factor of 25%. The PCE of the C101 dye-based control device in this study was 9.93%, which is ≈90% of the PCE (11%) of the C101 dye-based DSSC reported by Gao et al.58 Thus, the PCE enhancement of the C101-based DSSC with the e-LSAM/MWCNTs CE was reliable. The performance of the e-LSAM/MWCNTs CE for I3−/I−-based DSSCs is further compared with recently reported Pt-free cathodes as shown in Fig. 5e.42,43,60–72 The e-LSAM/MWCNTs CE showed a higher PCE and PCE enhancement factor than most of the reported Pt-free CEs.
The IRR durability of cathodes is another essential factor for the practical application of DSSCs. The electrochemical stability of e-LSAM/MWCNTs and Pt CEs was studied by continuous CV cycles. In the CV curves, the smaller potential separation (Epp) between the oxidation and reduction peaks typically signifies the higher IRR activity of the CE.73–75 In addition, a higher IRR activity also corresponds to a larger cathodic peak current density (Jcp). The Jcp of a cathode directly correlates with the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode.73,74 Thus, the Jcp should be the main factor rather than the Epp in CV curves to investigate the electrochemical stability of e-LSAM/MWCNTs and Pt CEs. As displayed in Fig. 6a, b and S7,† the Pt CE showed poor IRR stability with an obviously reduced Jcp value (from −0.78 to −0.67 mA cm−2) after 35 CV cycles while e-LSAM/MWCNTs exhibited an almost unchanged Jcp value for 200 CV cycles, suggesting superior IRR durability of e-LSAM/MWCNTs in the I3−/I−-based electrolyte. The structural and microstructural stability of the CE also plays a critical role in the IRR durability. As shown in Fig. S8,† the e-LSAM composite showed an almost unchanged phase structure (Ag and r-LSM-A phase) and microstructure (Ag NPs with an average diameter of ∼20 nm exsolved on the surface) after the IRR test.

The Ag exsolution strategy is further demonstrated to be applicable to other perovskite oxides, for example, LCAM. As shown in Fig. S9,† Ag NPs were formed on the surface of e-LCAM while the surface of LCAM was smooth without any NPs, suggesting that Ag NPs were successfully exsolved from the LCAM perovskite, which was also confirmed by the XRD results of e-LCAM and LCAM (Fig. S10†). When used as a cathode in DSSCs, e-LCAM showed a higher IRR activity than r-LCM in terms of the PCE, triiodine diffusion and charge transfer capability (Fig. S11, Table S8 and S9†).
Conclusions
In summary, we studied the electrocatalytic activities of e-LSAM nanocomposites fabricated by a facile exsolution method in DSSC systems. e-LSAM showed a higher electrocatalytic activity for the IRR in DSSCs compared to r-LSM and r-LSM-A due to the increased surface active sites (silver NPs and oxygen vacancies), enhanced charge transfer capability and improved triiodine diffusion capability. In addition, the e-LSAM electrocatalyst outperformed the physical mixtures of micro Ag/r-LSM-A and nano Ag/r-LSM-A as well as the Ag/r-LSM-A hybrid prepared by the impregnation method owing to the strong interfacial interaction and small Ag particle size. Furthermore, the e-LSAM composite displayed a robust electrochemical durability for the IRR. The DSSC with the e-LSAM/MWCNTs cathode showed a PCE of 12.4%, which is superior to that of the Pt-based control device (9.93%) and is among the highest PCE values of Pt-free cathodes reported so far. This work may open a new avenue for combining surface exsolved nanoparticles with bulk perovskite oxides as high-performance catalysts for various energy applications.
