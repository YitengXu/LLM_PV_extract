    , Accepted 23rd November 2019First published on 12th December 2019AbstractSince the year 2014, when scientists first obtained black phosphorus using a sticky tape to peel the layers off, it has attracted tremendous interest as a novel two-dimensional material. After it was successfully produced, its outstanding optical properties have been unveiled. Various applications based on these properties have been reported. This study mainly reviews the unique optical properties and potential applications of black phosphorus. The optical performances of black phosphorus mainly include linear optical properties and nonlinear optical properties. Some examples include the anisotropic optical response, saturable absorption effect and Kerr effect. The researchers found that the nonlinear saturable absorption coefficients of black phosphorus are better than that of MoS2 and WS2 from the visible region to the near-infrared region. Compared with graphene, black phosphorus has a better nonlinear saturable absorption performance. After passivation or surface modification, black phosphorus is stable when exposed to oxygen and water. Herein, black phosphorus has the potential to be used in detector/sensors, solar energy harvesting, photocatalysts, optical saturable absorbers in ultrafast lasers, all optical switches, optical modulation, nanomedicine and some others in the near future.
1. Introduction
Phosphorene is a novel two-dimensional material that can be viewed as a single layer of black phosphorus, which is the most stable allotrope of phosphorus and ranks 11th in the abundance of elements in the earth. In 1914, Bridgman reported the conversion of white phosphorus to black phosphorus at a moderate temperature of 200 °C and a high pressure of 1.2 GPa.1 The experimental conditions were harsh, and it was difficult to produce the black phosphorus on a large scale. In 2014, two groups, one led by Peide Ye of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and the other by Yuanbo Zhang of Fudan University in Shanghai and Xianhui Chen of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, reported that they had stripped black phosphorus to two or three atomic layers.2,3 Then, black phosphorus has the potential to be used in nanoelectronics. However, neither team isolated a single layer of phosphorene. From then on, black phosphorus has acquired a great deal of attention in scientific studies.
Due to its natural band gap, black phosphorus might be useful for making thin and flexible electronics. In addition to that, phosphorene can be switched between insulating and conducting states, and it is still flat enough to confine the electrons so that charge can flow quickly.2 Moreover, the band gap of black phosphorus has a layer dependency from ∼2.0 eV for the monolayer, ∼1.3 eV for the double layers and ∼0.8 eV for the triple layers, and down to 0.3 eV for the bulk state.4–8 This property makes black phosphorus have a broadband optical response from the visible to mid-infrared region. In addition to the above properties, black phosphorus has other properties such as a mobility as high as 10000 cm2 V−1 s−1,6,9 over 105 on/off ratio,9,10 large surface-to-volume ratios11 and large optical absorption coefficients,12 which enable it to be applied in optoelectronic devices, photodetectors,13–27 sensors,28–31 cancer therapy,32–36 solar cells,37–40 batteries and supercapacitors.41–43
In recent years, the nonlinear optical property of black phosphorus and its potential applications have raised a great deal of attention. In addition, the research work is still at the preliminary stage. This paper mainly introduced nonlinear saturable absorption effect and optical Kerr effect of black phosphorus. Comparisons between black phosphorus, graphene and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were demonstrated. The mechanism of black phosphorus’ saturable absorption was described. It was indicated that black phosphorus will be applied in saturable absorbers of ultrafast lasers,44–68 all optical switches,69–71 optical modulators and other devices.72–77
In this study, we give a brief review on the recent progresses of linear and nonlinear properties of black phosphorus and its applications. This paper is organized as follows: in section 1, we will give a brief introduction and background on black phosphorus. In section 2, we will introduce the optical properties of black phosphorus. The linear and nonlinear optical properties will be elucidated in detail. In section 3, some applications based on black phosphorus will be described, including detectors and sensors, solar cells, photocatalysts, in addition to the generation, switcher and wavelength converters, optic/electro-optical modulation and nanomedicine. In section 4, we will summarize the topics and give our perspective.
2. Optical properties of black phosphorus
The band gap of black phosphorus is the most important parameter that determines the optical absorption of 2D materials. The band structure will characterize the optical properties of 2D materials, especially those capable of interacting with light. The optical properties were determined from the visible to mid-IR range for black phosphorus via theoretical calculation and experimentally, as described in the following sections.
2.1 Linear optical properties
Unlike graphene and TMDs, black phosphorus is formed by a puckered honeycomb lattice that results in a strong anisotropic electronic mobility and anisotropic optical response.78–87 The layered structure permits the employment of mechanical exfoliation to extract the thin black phosphorus from the bulk crystal. The most attractive property of black phosphorus is its layer-dependent direct band gap. The band gap occurs from ∼2.0 eV for the monolayer, ∼1.3 eV for the double layers and ∼0.8 eV for the triple layers, down to 0.3 eV for the bulk state as aforementioned. Fig. 2 shows the crystal structure and electronic structures for the bulk black phosphorus.88 The band structure of the black phosphorus was verified by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in the lower half part of Fig. 1b, which agrees with the screened hybrid functional calculations.

The unique band structure and puckered honeycomb lattice will result in the thickness and polarization-dependent linear optical responses. Fig. 3 exhibits the linear absorption and reflection spectra for the few-layered black phosphorus.4,89 On the basis of the threshold values of the absorption spectra, it shows a clear layer dependence in Fig. 3(b). From the monolayer to the bulk state, the decrease in the cut-off light energy indicates that the band gap is inversely correlated with the thickness of black phosphorus. The tunable band gap of black phosphorus covering the ultraviolet to mid-infrared region is the key element to fabricating broadband optical devices. The absorption along the x-axis (armchair) and y-axis (zigzag) in Fig. 3(c) and (d) shows strong anisotropy from the monolayer to the penta-layer and the bulk state. The optical response clearly shows polarization dependence, consequently.51,84,86,90–92 The absorption along the armchair is larger than that along the zigzag direction. The optical response properties provide an intuitive confirmation on the anisotropy, which originated in its unique layered puckered honeycomb lattice and electronic structure. The strong anisotropic optical response of the black phosphorus might benefit the polarization detection. The Raman scattering of black phosphorus is similar with absorption and reflection: thickness-dependent and angular-dependent, which are induced by the band structure, electron and photon interaction in the black phosphorus.92 The quantum dots with different sizes exhibit a broadband photoluminescence for photoacoustic imaging and probe with high sensitivity.32,93,94

2.2 Nonlinear optical properties
Many scientists and researchers have done valuable research on black phosphorus to unveil its outstanding properties. In addition to its excellent electrical,88,95,96 mechanical97–100 and thermal properties,101–106 black phosphorus has fascinating optical properties. The nonlinear optical property of the two-dimensional materials has been studied in recent years. Most of the works were done through experiments. They found that graphene, TMDs and black phosphorus exhibit a unique nonlinear optical performance.
Since the laser was invented, nonlinear optics developed rapidly. Scientists and researchers have already found that the nonlinear optical performances of black phosphorus consist of the saturable absorption effect and optical Kerr effect. There are several ways to investigate the nonlinear optical property of a certain material. Among them, the Z scan method is easier, more practical and widely used. The schematic of the Z scan method shown in Fig. 4(a) can measure the nonlinear absorption coefficient and refraction index of a certain material at different wavelengths.107–110 Hence, many researchers adopted this method to achieve the nonlinear absorption coefficients of two-dimensional materials.47,52,107,111–129

According to the nonlinear susceptibility theory, the polarization P in the medium could be written as: P = ε0χ(1)E + ε0χ(2)EE + ε0χ(3)EEE + …(1)where ε0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum, χ(n) is the n-order susceptibility tensor, and E is the electric field. The second-order term connects to the second harmonic generation (SHG), sum frequency (SF) difference frequency (DF) and optical parametric amplification (OPA). Meanwhile, the third-order term in eqn (1) is connected to the third harmonic generation (THG), Kerr effect, saturation absorption (SA), and two-photon absorption (TPA). In the following subsection, we will bring out the SA effect and Kerr effect of black phosphorus.

2.2.1 Saturable absorption effect. 
Saturable absorption is a property of a material where the absorption of light decreases when the light intensity increases. The nonlinear absorption coefficient of black phosphorus obeys the following equation: (2)where α(I) is the nonlinear absorption coefficient, α0 is the linear absorption coefficient, I is the depleted light intensity, and Is is the saturable light intensity.
When I = Is, .
The transmittance can be expressed as the following formula: (3)where αs and αns are the saturable and nonsaturable absorptions, respectively. Is is the saturable intensity, defined as the optical intensity when the optical absorbance is reduced to half of its unbleached value. The diagram of the saturable absorption coefficient is shown in Fig. 4(b).
The relationship between the intensity, propagation depth and nonlinear absorption coefficient follows the equation: (4)where L is the propagation depth.
The mechanism of black phosphorus’ saturable absorption could be explained by the single photon absorption model and two-stage energy-band model. Fig. 5 shows the schematic of the excitation processes on the linear and nonlinear light absorptions.113 Under the incident light with photon energy E higher than the band gap of black phosphorus, the electrons in the valence band (VB) could be excited into the conduction band (CB), as shown in Fig. 5(a). Then, the photo-excited hot electrons thermalize to establish a hot Fermi–Dirac distribution. This processing will block the new inter-band excitation around the VB with an energy of κBTe, as shown in Fig. 5(b). When the incident light is strong enough, the photo-excited electrons possibly cause the states that are nearly half of the photon energy to be filled, which will block further absorption, as shown in Fig. 5(c).

In 2015, Hanlon et al. first proposed that high-quality and few-layered black phosphorus nanosheets could be produced on a large scale by liquid phase exfoliation in the solvent N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP).130 In addition to that, they reported the broadband ultrafast nonlinear optical effect of black phosphorus for the first time. They found that the transmittance increased with light intensity, which agrees with eqn (3). Moreover, black phosphorus has a better saturable absorption effect than graphene. Those results indicated that black phosphorus is potentially useful in a range of applications from saturable absorbers, optical switches to mode-locking and Q-switching devices.
After the nonlinear saturable absorption effect was found, S. Zhang et al. discovered that black phosphorus’ saturable absorption performance depends on its size.120 They used the liquid phase exfoliation method to prepare three black phosphorus dispersions with three different sizes. Then, they compared the saturable absorption performance of these three samples at two wavelengths: one at 515 nm in the visible region lies beyond the band gap of the monolayer black phosphorus, and the other at 1030 nm in the near-infrared region lies between the band gap of the monolayer and the bulk state. The results indicated that, as the sizes of the black phosphorus nanosheets became smaller, the saturable absorption coefficients decreased (Fig. 6). They set up a slow saturable absorber model to get the ground-state absorption coefficient and excited-state absorption coefficient of the black phosphorus nanosheets. In comparison with graphene and MoS2, black phosphorus’ large ground-state transition probability and weak loss of excited-state absorption result in a better saturable absorption performance.

Z. Guo et al. described a basic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) liquid exfoliation method to produce phosphorene with excellent stability and controllable size.131 The ultrafast nonlinear absorption of phosphorene dispersions was investigated by the Z-scan technique. The peak wavelength of the femtosecond laser is 800 nm, and the pulse width is 100 fs. The saturable intensity is 774.4 GW cm−2, and the modulation depth is 14.2%. Furthermore, S. Lu et al. unveiled black phosphorus nanosheets’ broadband nonlinear saturable absorption properties in 400 nm, 800 nm, 1563 nm and 1930 nm.113 The measurement results indicated that black phosphorus could be a promising saturable absorber with broadband operation in Q-switcher, mode-locker.
When the size of black phosphorus decreased to a few nanometers, the quantum effect will dominate the nonlinear optical properties. Y. Xu et al. adopted the solvothermal approach to produce black phosphorus quantum dots with an average size of 2.1 ± 0.9 nm successfully, and unveiled its nonlinear optical properties as shown in Fig. 6(c)–(f).118 It was first found that the nonlinear saturable absorption performance of the black phosphorus quantum dots was better than that of the black phosphorus nanosheets. The modulation depth is 36%, and the saturable intensity is 3.3 GW cm−2. Then, the quantum dots were use as a saturable absorber in the passively mode-locked fiber ultrafast laser generation.
In 2018, S. Tang et al. studied the saturable absorption property of black phosphorus under three different pulse durations (100 fs, 1 ps, 10 ps).107 They used the liquid phase exfoliation method to obtain three different layers of black phosphorus. Then, they set up an open aperture Z-scan system, including a femtosecond laser as the light source. The results showed that the nonlinear absorption coefficient, the imaginary part of the third order nonlinear optical susceptibility and the figure of merit are proportional to the pulse duration. On the other hand, the saturable intensity is the opposite to the pulse duration. Y. W. Wang studied ultraviolet saturable absorption and ultrafast carrier dynamics in ultrasmall black phosphorus quantum dots.121 The negative nonlinear optical absorption coefficient is – (1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−3 cm GW−1 and the saturable intensity is 6.6 ± 1.3 GW cm−2. This implied its future application in UV photonic devices. J. Xu investigated the third order nonlinear optical property of black phosphorus in solution by the Z-scan technique.132 The results showed that black phosphorus exhibited a broadband nonlinear saturable absorption from the visible region at 532 nm to the near-infrared region at 1064 nm. Then, they made comparisons between black phosphorus, graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides.
From the previous research work, it can be concluded that the sizes, layer numbers and pulse duration are key factors to the nonlinear absorption performance of black phosphorus that allow us to prepare black phosphorus with specific properties. Table 1 summarized the nonlinear optical parameters of black phosphorus with different sizes, thicknesses excited by various wavelengths and pulse durations. The broadband saturable absorption properties of black phosphorus make it a promising and novel nonlinear optical material in Q-switching, mode-locker and other applications.

2.2.2 Kerr effect. 
In addition to the saturable absorption effect, it was found that black phosphorus exhibited the optical Kerr effect, which changes the susceptibility in response to an applied electric field. The optical Kerr effect is namely the real part of the refractive index of black phosphorus proportional to the square of the optical electric field connected to the real part of the third order susceptibility χ(3). The optical Kerr effect could lead to the self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM), and self-focusing/defocusing. The real parts of the nonlinear refractive index of black phosphorus were measured by the Z scan as aforementioned. The third order nonlinear refractive index of black phosphorus was first measured by X. Zheng et al., which is ∼(6.8 ± 0.2)×10−13 m2 W−1 obtained by the Z-scan measurement technique under an 800 nm femtosecond pulsed laser excitation.115
J. Zhang et al. measured the nonlinear refractive index of black phosphorus nanoflake suspensions from 350 nm–1160 nm with a spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM).133 The third order nonlinear refractive index is estimated to be ∼10−5 cm2 W−1 and the third nonlinear susceptibility is estimated to be ∼10−8 esu at broadband wavelengths. The outstanding nonlinear optical properties enable black phosphorus to play a role as a promising candidate in nonlinear optical materials for further research and applications.

3. Applications
Owing to its unique band gap, electronic structure and electric properties, black phosphorus was widely employed as a kind of high performance electro-optic material. Detectors and sensors based on black phosphorus have been reported since the 2D black phosphorus emerges from ultraviolet to terahertz with a fast response and high responsivity.18,21–23,28,134–155 Due to its ultrafast nonlinear optical property, black phosphorus is a broadband optical device for ultrafast lasers. The saturable absorber is a key component of fiber lasers. The key parameters for a saturable absorber are its wavelength range, its dynamic response, its saturation intensity and fluence. In this section, we will introduce the applications of black phosphorus based on its optical properties.
3.1 Detectors and sensors
As detectors and sensors based on black phosphorus comply with similar principles, we arranged them in a subsection. Owing to its layer-dependent band gap, black phosphorus presents a wideband optical response covering the ultraviolet, visible, infrared and terahertz regions, which enables black phosphorus to play a role as a promising candidate in materials for detecting and sensing.18,21–23,28,134–158
The black phosphorus-based FET is one of the least reliable schemes to achieve detectors. Y. Xu et al. fabricated a FET based on the Se-doped black phosphorus detector, which possesses excellent electronic properties with an on/off current ratio of 105 and hole mobility of 561 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, the responsivity and external quantum efficiency of this detector were as high as 15.33 AW−1 and 2993% when the Se dope was induced, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b).146

Planar 2D materials are compatible with metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes, which make silicon photonics a promising technology for on-chip devices. Up to now, a variety of on-chip device-based 2D materials like graphene, TMDs and black phosphorus have been demonstrated.17,159–162 N. Youngblood et al. demonstrated a silicon waveguide integrated black phosphorus photodetector with a responsivity of up to 657 mA W−1 with 100 nm black phosphorus and a response bandwidth exceeding 3 GHz, as shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d).25 As the band gap is nonzero, this detector exhibits a very low dark current, which is 220 nA at optimal operation conditions, making it more favorable than those that are based on graphene. Detectors based on black phosphorus can outperform graphene photodetectors and are more realistic for practical use. The layer-dependent direct band gap can be tailored for wideband operation. Moreover, the anisotropic band structure and optical response make it possible to demonstrate polarization-sensitive detectors and optimize the performance.
Beyond the photodetectors, various kinds of black phosphorus-based high performance sensors (such as gas sensors, biosensors, humidity and others) have been reported.28,147–150,152,154,155,163–175 Our previous review has provided a brief summary on the application of black phosphorus sensors.176 Moreover, those sensors are perhaps out of the scope of this review in which we have focused on the optical properties and its application. Hence, we will not introduce this part in detail.
The large surface-to-volume ratios originating from the puckered honeycomb lattice structure and its sensitivity to surrounding conditions make black phosphorus adequate for sensing. Compared with graphene TMDs and other 2D materials, the use of black phosphorus for sensing has several advantages: larger surface-to volume ratios, more sensitive and superior molecular adsorption energy than that of others due to its unique and excellent electric properties, and a layer-dependent band gap.11,177 A. Abbas demonstrated a nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor based on field-effect transistors with a few layers of black phosphorus.28 This sensor exhibited high sensitivity for the detection of NO2 down to 5 ppb and good reversibility. C. Mayorga-Martinez reported a highly sensitive and selective methanol vapor sensor based on the interdigitated gold electrode deposited with a few layers of black phosphorus.164 The lower limit of detection was down to 28 ppm with long-term stability and reproducibility. J. Zhou reported a microRNA biosensor with rapid detection and high sensitivity based on the black phosphorus nanosheets.178 This demonstrated that the biosensor exhibits a linear response to the microRNAs from 10 nM to 1000 nM due to the good performance of the black phosphorus nanosheets employed as the fluorescence quenching material. The black phosphorus-based sensors show high sensitivity, various active sites for selective molecular adsorption, and its reusability and stability might pave the way for industrial applications, safety devices and health sensing.
3.2 Solar cells
Photovoltaic systems have attracted great research interest due to the sunlight as a kind of clean, abundant and environmentally friendly energy source.179–190 Two dimensional materials have emerged as important functional materials due to their unique electric and optical properties to achieve high energy conversion efficiency and low cost for solar cells.40,182,184,191–194 Black phosphorus is a promising material for solar cells due to its layer-dependent direct band gap from 0.3 eV to 2.0 eV, ambipolar operation and natural p-type semiconducting properties, which are not available for the remains of 2D materials. For instance, graphene is gapless while few layers TMDs have broader indirect band gap. Since the emergence of 2D black phosphorus, black phosphorus-based solar cells have been reported.37,40,66,191–208 M. Buscema verified the photovoltaic effect in few-layered black phosphorus PN junctions in an experiment that showed a strong photocurrent under illumination.40 Since then, in order to achieve high power conversion and wide wavelength response in solar cells, black phosphorus was employed as the selective materials, electrodes and PN junctions established by heterojunction which generates and separates the carriers.
Y. Yang reported a high power conversion efficient, quasi-solid-state, bifacial n-type dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) with a black phosphorus quantum dot-based photocathode acting as the light absorber and charge transfer layer.37 The schematic of this proposed solar cell is shown in Fig. 8(a). The synthesized black phosphorus quantum dots are integrated with a polyaniline film to build the photocathode, which exhibits NIR light absorption and complementary absorption by the photoanode, leading to a remarkable enhancement in the electron transport and recombination. The power conversion efficiency of the proposed solar cell is 6.85% and the short-circuit current is 24.31 mA cm−2, which are 20% higher than the ones without black phosphorus quantum dots as shown in Fig. 8(b). Furthermore, the use of black phosphorus as the selective material, electron transport layer and photoanode in different kinds of solar cells has been investigated.37,66,193,194,197,199,200,206

M. Buscema verified the photovoltaic effect in few-layered black phosphorus PN junctions in an experiment.40 However, the black phosphorus employed in the solar cells did not generate the photocarriers and separate them, as shown in the follow-up research. L. Bai fabricated the black phosphorus/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (BP/PCBM) heterojunction-based solar cells.207 The PCBM as the growth template was doped with black phosphorus to form the hexagon-layered stacking planar-heterojunction, while the bulk-heterojunction was formed by self-assembling the black phosphorus-doped PCBM nanowires and hexagon knitted sheets as shown in Fig. 8(c). The BP/PCBM heterojunction was employed as the active layer for photocurrent production. The black phosphorus is helpful for charge transportation upon photocurrent generation due to the energy level matching. These two types of hybrid heterojunction-based solar cells show broad absorption bands and high thermal stability. The power conversion efficiency could achieve 6.40 ± 0.23% and 7.96 ± 0.23% for planar and bulk heterojunction-based solar cells, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8(d).
Black phosphorus is promising for use in active materials, selective materials, electron transport materials and electrodes for solar cells fabrication due to its outstanding properties. Black phosphorus may play an important role in solar cell research to achieve high power conversion efficiency and low cost in the future.
3.3 Photocatalyst
Black phosphorus is not only a promising energy harvesting material, but it also is a photocatalytic material for utilizing the broad wavelength of solar light. Semiconductor photocatalysts, which are usually composed of semiconductor materials and cocatalysts, are an attractive and challenging topic for splitting water and vapor removal. According to the absorbing sunlight, semiconductors, like TMDs and black phosphorus, could generate an electron–hole pair, which helps to accelerate the rate of photoreaction. The generated electron–hole pairs without recombination then reduce and oxidize the matter (for instance, water). Graphene and TMDs in bulk and 2D form have been used for photocatalysis for a long time,209–216 while the layered black phosphorus emerges as the photocatalyst attracting strong attention over the past few years owing to its excellent electronic and optical properties as described above.39,217–235 The band gap of the black phosphorus and the interface play an important role in the photocatalytic process.234 The layer-tunable band gap of black phosphorus from 0.3 eV for the bulk state to 2.0 eV for the monolayer indicates that it has a broadband absorption spectrum from the UV to NIR region, which helps to improve the photocatalytic efficiency. In addition, the black phosphorus based compound photocatalyst could be achieved in an environmentally friendly way with no toxic materials released and low cost due to the metal-free induction.
The reported black phosphorus based photocatalysts are focused on the water splitting reaction that generates hydrogen (H2) and reactive oxygen species with high efficiency. The H2 generated from water is an ideal clean energy source, while the reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, are attractive in physical, chemical and biological applications. M. Zhu et al. reported the photocatalyst for H2 evolution by the black phosphorus-graphitic carbon nitride (BP/gCN) in the presence of methanol.227 They traced the photocarriers generated in pure black phosphorus, pure gCN and BP/gCN from the band gap excitation, and fast recombination was found in pure black phosphorus and pure gCN. The compound exhibited highly efficient metal-free photocatalysis for H2 evolution that the H2 output rate reached about 427 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation and 101 μmol g−1 h−1 for >780 nm irradiation. Similarly, Q. Zhang et al. reported BP/gCN heterojunction photocatalysis for H2 production with a rate of 384.17 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of water.228 The Z-scheme composite is considered a desirable photocatalyst because of its efficient separation of electron–hole pairs and enhanced redox ability. The Lu group and Majima group each reported on the Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting reaction on a black phosphorus based heterojunction.232,233 H. Wang et al. reported on the singlet oxygen generation by the ultrathin black phosphorus nanosheet photocatalysis under the visible light with a high quantum yield of approximately 0.91.231 Moreover, the generated singlet oxygen was induced to the photodynamic therapy. The nanosheets exhibited notable cell/tumor growth inhibition with a small amount and short light irradiation in the in vitro and in vivo studies. Yun Zheng et al. reported on the black phosphorus and polymeric carbon nitride (BP/pCN) heterojunction photocatalysis for molecular oxygen generation under visible light.218 In general, the process of photocatalysis induced by black phosphorus and its compound could be summed up in the following steps. First, the incident light generates the electron–hole pairs, while the photocatalyst enters an excited state. Then, the electron–hole pairs are transferred to the interfaces of the solid and the liquid without recombination. Finally, the electron–hole pairs at the interfaces reduce and oxidize the absorbed substances if it is favorable from a thermodynamic viewpoint. An example is the prepared black phosphorus nanoflake with a 0.76 eV–0.45 eV band gap that forms a composite with CN to form a type I heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 9(a). The CN absorbed the light to excite the electron from the VB to the CB when λ > 420 nm. Noting the relative position and relative magnitude of the energy band between CN and black phosphorus, the proper energy band structures are suitable for the transfer of charge carriers for H2 and ROS evolution. The excited electrons and holes are then accepted by the adjacent black phosphorus, suppressing the recombination in the CN. Then, the electron generates the H2 due to the P–N coordinate bond acting as the electron trap sites. The holes are quenched by the methanol quickly, as shown in Fig. 9(a), or are immediately captured by the hole-sacrificial agent triethanolamine (TEOA) to generate its oxide, or transferred to the VB of black phosphorus by reacting with TEOA, as shown in Fig. 9(c). While for long wavelength light with lower energy, such as the NIR region, the electron–hole pairs are only generated in black phosphorus due to its narrow band gap. However, due to the fast recombination in black phosphorus, the H2 will be generated in the PN defects where the trapped excited electrons in black phosphorus help to gain the yield. Simultaneously, the holes left behind in the VB of black phosphorus are scavenged to generate ROS based on the cocatalysts, while the mechanism of ROS generation are with H2, as shown in Fig. 9(b). The electrons are excited to CB and leave holes in the VB in CN, or other cocatalysts under irradiation with higher energy than the band gap. The electrons and holes are then transferred to black phosphorus. The O2 then absorbs the electrons to form ˙O2−, which can oxidize RhB. Meanwhile, the holes in VB can oxidize RhB simultaneously.

In general, the black phosphorus based photocatalytic has several advantages: (1) it can harvest the broad wavelength light, especially the sunlight, which is clean, sustained and abundant. (2) It has high performance comparable to that of inorganic/organic semiconductor photocatalysts. (3) It is cheap due to it being metal-free, environmentally friendly and easy to obtain. All told, black phosphorus is a promising photocatalyst material for H2 and ROS evolution, and may be further researched in the photocatalytic degradation of pollution, water-splitting and photocatalytic disinfection.
3.4 Nanomedicine
Black phosphorus nanosheets and quantum dots have been applied for theranostic nanomedicine, including photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), drug delivery and release system (DDRS).32,33,36,236–251 Many outstanding reviews from our group and other teams have given out a brief summary on the application of nanomedicine based on black phosphorus.252–254 Moreover, those applications may be out of the scope of this review in which we focused on the optical properties and its application accordingly. For these reasons, we will not introduce this part in detail.
Black phosphorus opened up huge possibilities for diagnosis and therapy due to its thickness and size-dependent properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability and negligible toxicity. The large extinction coefficient, wide absorption spectral coverage from the visible to NIR region, and the high photo-thermal conversion efficiency of black phosphorus (as noted above) make it a potential phototherapy platform. Meanwhile, the puckered layer structures and large surface-to-volume ratios of black phosphorus provide a platform to carry drugs for DDRS, fluorescent elements for PAI and gene therapy.
Phototherapy including PTT and PDT could generate thermal or ROS to kill the cancer cells upon irradiation with a specific wavelength light. Sun et al. employed the BPQDs as the PTT agents show excellent NIR photothermal performance with a large extinction coefficient of 14.8 Lg−1 cm−1 at 808 nm, a photothermal conversion efficiency of 28.4%, as shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b).251 Shao et al. reported the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) loaded with BPQDs, which is processed by an emulsion method to produce biodegradable BPQDs/PLGA nanospheres. The in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the BPQDs/PLGA nanospheres have inappreciable toxicity and good biocompatibility, and possess excellent PTT efficiency and tumor targeting ability, as evidenced by the highly efficient tumor ablation under near infrared (NIR) laser illumination.32 Guo et al. reported that the BPQDs have excellent PDT effect under light irradiation that can effectively generate ROS to kill cancer cells (see Fig. 10(c)).33 However, PTT and PDT have several defects; for instance, the high temperature may damage nearby normal cells in PTT and the low quantum yield in ROS generation in PDT. To overcome these shortcomings, a synergistic PTT, PDT and chemotherapy technique emerges. Yang et al. studied a novel nanocomposite developed by the assembly of iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles and Au nanoparticles on black phosphorus sheets (BPs@Au@Fe3O4) for tumor inhibition, owing to a synergistic PTT and PDT irradiated by a low power NIR laser, as shown in Fig. 10(d).236 Meanwhile, BPs@Au@Fe3O4 can anticipatorily suppress tumor growth by visualized synergistic therapy with the help of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The large surface-to-volume ratios of black phosphorus provide a platform to carry drugs. Chen et al. reported the black phosphorus nanosheet-based drug delivery system for the synergistic PTT, PDT and chemotherapy.238 They found that black phosphorus nanosheets could load higher amounts of doxorubicin (DOX) on the surface (950% in weight) than the reported 2D material system. Moreover, this system not only possesses the improved drug loading efficiency, and pH-/photoresponsive drug release, but also shows the ability of PTT and PDT for the tumor.

3.5 Optic/electro-optical modulation
In addition to saturable absorbers, the saturable absorption effect of two-dimensional materials is also used to make an all-optical modulator. Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, the researchers first produced an all-optical modulator based on black phosphorus. Previous studies have shown that the conductivity and thermal conductivity of black phosphorus have thickness dependence, and it also can be modulated by a bias voltage like graphene.255–259 The optical modulators based on black phosphorus fall into three categories: electric-optical modulator, which is based on the electro-absorption effect; all-optical modulator, which is due to the nonlinear effect; and the thermo-optical modulator based on the thermo-optical effect. The 2D materials were employed as SA or nonlinear refraction index materials as discussed in section 3.4. The index including the real part and imaginary part changed by the laser or laser-induced heat would provide a road lead to modulation. However, all-optical modulators based on black phosphorus usually manipulated by a laser with high power or intensity that could modulate the index of black phosphorus to achieve a phase change will trigger high energy consumption.
C. Lin et al. proposed a waveguide based electro-optic modulator in the mid-infrared regime first as shown in Fig. 11(a)–(c).76 Like graphene waveguide modulators, the absorption properties for black phosphorus at different bias voltages could be modulated owing to electro-absorption.260–263 Compared with graphene, black phosphorus modulators have a higher performance when the thickness reaches the tens of nanometers, which make it possible to demonstrate the performance of the electro-optical modulators for communication in the future. Y. Wang et al. reported a Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) thermo-optical modulator.72 They set up a fiber MZI with one path covered with black phosphorus as shown in Fig. 11(d). The evanescent field increases when the control light power increases that will lead to higher temperature with the absorption of the cover black phosphorus. The optical phase of one path of MZI could be modulated by the strong thermo-optical effect of black phosphorus. The conversion efficiency of this proposed modulator could achieve up to 0.029π mW−1.

(a)–(c) were reproduced with permission from ref. 76. (d) The modulator setup. (e) ASCII codes measured at the control light port and output ports. (d) and (e) were reproduced with permission from ref. 72. 
The all-optical modulators with high performance are easy to fabricate due to the excellent nonlinear optical properties of black phosphorus. However, the low speed of the thermo-optical modulator restricted its application as the low speed of heat transport owing to the pump light working as the heater instead of nonlinear index regulation. Electro-optical modulators based on 2D materials, like graphene and black phosphorus, originated the index modulation due to the bias voltage. Due to the limits of the silicon waveguide fabrication process, 2D materials are mainly covered on the surface of the waveguide, which interacts with the evanescent field with low efficiency that reduces the extinction ratio. These shortcomings need to be resolved to meet the demand of high-speed communication in the future.
3.6 Pulse generation
Previous studies have shown that black phosphorus has the potential to be used in saturable absorbers. Over the last few years, black phosphorus as a new saturable absorber for Q-switching and mode-locking laser operations have been reported.45,47,48,54–57,62,63,264–280 Black phosphorus has been employed as saturable absorbers to modulate the cavity absorption to generate high peak power, and the large energy pulse has several advantages. First, black phosphorus works well in the broadband from the ultraviolet to terahertz region as its tunable direct band gap. Compared with the commercial semiconductor saturable absorber mirror, saturable absorbers with two-dimensional materials are cheaper and easier to fabricate. The saturable absorption intensity is larger than graphene, making it favorable in Q-switching, while graphene is more attractive for mode-locking.
H. Zhang's group reported that black phosphorus, graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, topological insulators and those quantum dots can be used as saturable absorbers in pulse generation.48,50,52–54,123,266,278,281–291 They proposed the idea to choose different thicknesses or sizes of quantum dots to fit in different wavelengths of lasers. For instance, the black phosphorus coated fiber laser, as shown in Fig. 12, could achieve an 18.55% modulation depth and 1074 MW cm−2 saturation intensity and 94.3 nJ pulse energy with 195 mW pump power for passive Q-switching and 946 fs pulse duration for passive mode-locking operation.50 H. Mu et al. fabricated black phosphorus in a saturable absorber. They used solution based mechanical exfoliation to get two-dimensional black phosphorus layers.54 Then, they fabricated black phosphorus polymer composites to the fiber laser's saturable absorbers. This method can locate the position of the black phosphorus nanosheets accurately. The black phosphorus shows very fast carrier dynamics. In addition, this black phosphorus saturable absorber can be applied in passive Q switching to the ultrafast laser. Y. Ren et al. reported on a passively Q-switched fiber laser with black phosphorus as the saturable absorber.292 The experimental results indicated that the fiber laser is effective and reliable for generating high-energy pulses at 2 μm. R. Zhang realized the black phosphorus based Q-switching pulse generation in the visible (639 nm), near-infrared (1.06 μm) and mid-infrared (2.1 μm)74 regions.

From previous research work, it can be concluded that sizes, thickness and pulse duration are key factors to the nonlinear absorption performance of black phosphorus, which is investigated for laser generation in the visible region and infrared region. However, the long-term application in high power operation, which might damage the black phosphorus, needs to be solved in the future. The large saturable absorption intensity and ultrafast photocarrier dynamics of black phosphorus make it a promising absorber in Q-switching and mode-locking for pulse generation.
3.7 Switchers and wavelength converters
The ability of the refractive index of black phosphorus to be affected by high power lasers is also known as an optical Kerr effect. This phenomenon makes it possible to realize the all-optical switcher for all-optical network components, as discussed before. J. Zheng et al. demonstrated a BP-coated microfiber as an optical Kerr switcher and a four-wave-mixing-based wavelength converter.70 The basic operation principle of the Kerr switcher and experimental setup is shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b). When the pump light turns on, the probe light polarization rotation will evolve and is deliberately controlled by the intensity of the pump light due to the cross-phase modulation achieving as high as 26 dB extinction ratio and over 18 nm operation range, as shown in Fig. 13(c) and (d). The four-wave mixing (FWM) based wavelength conversion occurs under RF frequencies from 100 MHz to 10 GHz with a maximum conversion efficiency achieved at −59.15 dB. K. Wang et al. demonstrated the optical Kerr switcher by the BPQDs-coated microfiber with a 20 dB extinction ratio.293 The conversion efficiency of this proposed FWM based wavelength converter is about 40 dB in the RF frequency.

(c) and (d) Output spectra with pump light on/off. This figure was reproduced with permission from ref. 70. 
As discussed in section 2, the sizes, layer numbers and pulse duration are key factors to the nonlinear performance of black phosphorus, which allows us to prepare black phosphorus with specific properties. Compared with BPQDs, the black phosphorus based switcher and converters have better performance. Conversely, for the optical switcher and wavelength conversion, black phosphorus is not sensitive to these parameters due to the very thick BP/BPQD-coated microfiber. For all of that, black phosphorus still is a promising all-optical processing material to develop high performance photonic devices.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, scientists and researchers have already found the outstanding properties of black phosphorus. Its thickness and size dependent optical and electric properties enable it to achieve the specific demand for applications. The tunable direct band gap and optical responses makes it more favorable than the bandgap-less graphene and TMDs. Black phosphorus may bridge the band gap between graphene and TMDs. From this point of view, they are complementary rather than competitive. Its broadband anisotropic optical response originating in its unique layered puckered honeycomb lattice and electronic structure provide favorable circumstances for applications. The outstanding nonlinear optical properties of black phosphorus may open up the door to the pulse generation and all-optical devices. The broadband saturable absorption properties make it a promising and novel nonlinear optical material in Q-switching, mode-locker, among other applications. The relatively large χ(3) could lead to SPM, XPM, and FWM, which have an enormous application range.
The application studies of black phosphorus in optoelectronics were reported. The black phosphorus based sensor and detectors could achieve high responsivity for wideband operation. Black phosphorus can also be used in many other fields, including solar cells, as photocatalyst for water splitting and optical modulation. Moreover, black phosphorus is a rising star of the nanomedicine platform for cancer therapy and diagnosis.
Its tunable optical properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, metal-free status and low toxicity opened up huge possibilities for diagnosis and therapy in comparison with TMDs. The large extinction coefficient, wide absorption spectral coverage from the visible to NIR region, and the high photo-thermal conversion efficiency of black phosphorus (as noted above) make it a potential phototherapy platform. Meanwhile, the larger surface-to-volume ratios of black phosphorus, in comparison with graphene and TMDs, provide a remarkable platform to build a drug delivery system. The excellent nonlinear optical properties of black phosphorus made it a novel saturable absorber used in ultrafast lasers. The saturable absorption intensity is larger than graphene, making it favorable in Q-switching, while graphene is more attractive for mode-locking. The distinguished optical Kerr effect of black phosphorus plays a role in its use as a promising candidate in nonlinear optical materials for all optical communication and applications.
However, the application research on black phosphorus still has many unexplored ideas. It is a promising candidate in a variety of optical applications, and needs to be further studied in the near future. The applications based on black phosphorus with good stability, low cost, environment friendly and good performance may be the future research direction.
