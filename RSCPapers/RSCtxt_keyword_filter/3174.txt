    , Accepted 6th June 2019First published on 10th June 2019AbstractThe excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost preparation processes of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have made them one of the promising photovoltaic candidates. However, the trap states and charge recombination produced a bad effect on the performance of PVSCs. In this work, a PCBM:ITIC mixture was incorporated onto the perovskite films as two electron acceptors via an anti-solvent approach with the formation of a mixture interlayer on the perovskite. Lewis acid/base defects were passivated by the PCBM:ITIC mixture, leading to a lower trap density, and charge mobility was enhanced due to the PCBM:ITIC mixture interlayer. As a consequence, the PCE of the PVSCs with PCBM:ITIC treatment was increased from 14.00% to 16.99%. In addition, the environmental stability of the PVSCs with PCBM:ITIC treatment improved with only 15% degradation after 40 days (60% relative humidity, room temperature).
Introduction
Halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted intense attention in the past few years due to their excellent properties, such as high absorption coefficients,1,2 long excitation diffusion lengths3,4 and tunable band gaps.5–7 To date, tremendous efforts from multiple research groups have been devoted to developing PVSCs and the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs has been increased to 24.2%.8 Additionally, the PVSCs fabricated at low-cost show potential for industrialization, and the architectures of PVSCs could be basically divided into normal and inverted structures.9–11 Compared with mesoporous TiO2-based normal structured PVSCs fabricated at high temperature, the inverted planar PVSCs attracted more attention due to their simple fabrication at low temperature, high stability and small hysteresis.12–14 However, the inverted planar PVSCs show a lower PCE than the normal structured PVSCs according to the literature.15 Thus, many strategies have been reported to further improve the performance of inverted planar PVSCs.16–18
In the inverted planar structure PVSCs, fullerenes were (such as PCBM) exclusively used as electron transport layers (ETLs) on top of the perovskite. Besides the super charge transfer function, the outstanding passivation effect of fullerenes on the surface and grain boundary of perovskite layers contributes to the high performance of PVSCs.14,19,20 As is known, the defects act as the trap states to increase the carrier recombination and enable additional ion migration in the perovskite film, which produced a bad effect on the performance of PVSCs.21 Therefore, fullerenes and their derivatives have also been employed commonly as additives to decrease the defects in the perovskite films.22 Han et al. deposited PCBM through an anti-solvent step to form the perovskite–fullerene heterojunction structure effectively, improving the photoelectron collection and decreasing the recombination loss.23 And some other fullerene derivatives such as C70-DPM-OE and C60-DPM-OE24 have been reported, too.
Moreover, non-fullerene acceptor materials have also been introduced into the inverted planar structure PVSCs as ETLs25–27 or additives28–30 recently, such as IDIC,28 INIC29 and ITIC-TH,30 which can reduce the trap density with Lewis base functional groups in the molecule.21 And some non-fullerene molecules with optically induced dipoles further influenced the interfacial charge accumulation, leading to enhanced charge transport and reduced charge recombination.21
As mentioned above, PCBM or ITIC has been employed as an ETL14,19,20,25–27 in PVSCs. Besides, a PCBM and ITIC mixture as an ETL has been reported.26,27 Doojin Vak et al. used the PCBM and ITIC mixture as an ETL in PVSCs for simple comparison with no thorough study.26 Bin Hu et al. doped ITIC into PCBM by spin coating on top of MAPbI3−xClx as an ETL, and they focused on the interface between the ETL and perovskite, achieving a highest PCE of 14.52%.27 No research about the effect of the PCBM and ITIC mixture on the inner perovskite by introducing the mixture into perovskite via an anti-solvent process has been reported, as of yet.
Herein, PCBM and ITIC molecules were introduced in the perovskite layer as two electron acceptors by an anti-solvent step. It was expected that both the Lewis acid and base defects could be passivated by PCBM and ITIC. Meanwhile, a thin mixture interlayer may form on the top of the perovskite film with the incorporation of the PCBM:ITIC mixture, which acts as an electron-acceptor layer and facilitates charge collection and transport.31 Interfacial charge accumulation could be reduced due to the optically induced dipoles of ITIC.16,27 Thus, the charge mobility and trap density of perovskite with PCBM:ITIC mixture treatment will be studied. Furthermore, the stability of the PVSCs will be investigated as well as the PCE of the PVSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the fabrication process of the perovskite films. The PCBM:ITIC mixture was dissolved in chlorobenzene to obtain a dripping solution, which was introduced into the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) film via an anti-solvent method. The chemical structures of PCBM and ITIC are shown in Fig. 1b.

To study the effect of the PCBM:ITIC mixture on the photovoltaic performance, the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/nickel oxide (NiOx)/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag was used (Fig. 2a). MAPbI3 was used in this work and the detailed processes are described in the Experimental section. Here, PCBM treated perovskite and ITIC treated perovskite were also prepared for comparison, respectively. The corresponding energy level diagram of PVSCs is shown in Fig. 2b. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the pristine and small molecule treated perovskite films. According to the literature,32 Table S1 (ESI†) shows the highest occupied molecule orbital (HOMO) energy level and the lowest unoccupied molecule orbital (LUMO) energy level of the pristine and treated perovskite films. Compared to the pristine perovskite, the perovskite treated with the PCBM:ITIC mixture shows a better energy alignment with an adjacent contact layer, which could facilitate charge transportation. The J–V characteristics of the pristine and treated perovskite devices are shown in Fig. 2c and the corresponding data are shown in Table 1. The pristine PVSCs achieved an average PCE of 13.56 ± 0.44%. In contrast, the device based on the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite possessed a higher average PCE of 16.65 ± 0.34%. The increased short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) partly contributed to the faster charge transportation and collection on the mixture interlayer. Meanwhile, the defect passivation effect of PCBM:ITIC on the perovskite may be another reason for the increased FF, which will be discussed later. The weight ratio of PCBM and ITIC was also investigated (Table S2, ESI†), and the optimized ratio was 6:4. Fig. 2d shows the current density versus time (measured at a bias voltage near the maximum power point) and the stabilized power output, respectively. All the devices delivered stable current density over the whole time of the experiment. Meanwhile, Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, and the integrated current density of all the devices shows the same trend as the JSC. Fig. S2b (ESI†) shows the J–V curves at both forward and reverse scans of all devices and the devices based on the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite showed a negligible hysteresis behavior.

Fig. 3 shows the top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films fabricated with the structure of ITO/NiOx/perovskite. The surface of the treated perovskite films showed different morphologies and the perovskite grain was substantially invisible when compared with the pristine perovskite film. Small molecules aggregate easily33 and aggregates were formed on top of the PCBM and ITIC treated perovskite films (Fig. 3c and d). However, no aggregates were observed in the SEM image of the PCBM:ITIC treated perovskite (Fig. 3b). According to the literature, the molecule stacking of ITIC could be damaged by PCBM, which lead to a smooth surface of the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite.33 This phenomenon was further observed in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (Fig. S3a–d, ESI†). The root mean square roughness (RMS) of all the treated films decreased compared to that of the pristine perovskite films. Simultaneously, a smoother surface and invisible perovskite grain for the treated perovskite film indicated that some small molecules existed on top of the perovskite films, which could act as a thin interlayer. Meanwhile, it was obvious that the grain size was significantly increased after the molecule treatment, as shown in Fig. 3e–h, which was attributed to the thin interlayer formed during the anti-solvent process.31 A larger grain with less grain boundary contains less defects, which could reduce charge recombination. To a certain extent, the optimization of film formation could improve the stability.34 The contact angle measurement was further performed on all films (Fig. S3e–h, ESI†). The contact angles of pristine, PCBM:ITIC, PCBM, and ITIC treated perovskite films were 74.1°, 95.7°, 94.2° and 98.8°, respectively. The increased contact angle of the treated films proved that a more hydrophobic surface was formed, which leads to more stable perovskite films that can resist moisture. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns and the PbI2 signal (red circle) in the pristine perovskite film was more obvious compared to the small molecule treated perovskite films. The absorption spectra were basically unchanged for all perovskite films (Fig. S5, ESI†).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for investigating the existence of ITIC in the treated perovskite films. Fig. 4 shows the S 2p and Pb 4f XPS spectra. For the S 2p XPS spectra of pure ITIC, two peaks were observed at 164.3 eV (S 2p3/2) and 165.4 eV (S 2p1/2), while no S 2p peaks were found in the pristine perovskite. For ITIC treated perovskite and the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite films, the position of the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks shifts toward a lower binding energy, indicating the existence of ITIC in the perovskite layer and the interaction between the sulfide of ITIC and the Pb ions of perovskite.30,35 Besides, the cross-sectional SEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement was carried out for the representative sample ITO/NiOx/PCBM:ITIC treated perovskite. The I and Pb elements from perovskite, and the S element from ITIC were tracked. And the results showed that S distributes throughout the perovskite layer (Fig. S6, ESI†). Because PCBM could damage the molecule stacking of ITIC,33 PCBM:ITIC distributed in the perovskite uniformly, which promoted the combination of Pb ions and sulfide. Thus, the S peaks of the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite film shifted significantly toward a lower binding energy compared to that of ITIC treated perovskite. Compared to the pristine perovskite, the Pb 4f XPS spectra for all treated perovskite films shifted toward a higher binding energy since the under-coordinated Pb was passivated effectively by Lewis base carbonyl (CO) and cyano (CN).36,37 It also contributed to the increase of FF. In the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of pure ITIC (Fig. S7, ESI†), the symmetric stretching vibrations of CO bonds and CN bonds located at 1697 cm−1 and 2212 cm−1, respectively. In contrast, two peaks shifted for perovskite after being treated by ITIC and the PCBM:ITIC mixture, which further demonstrated interaction between ITIC and perovskite.38 The I 3d XPS spectra showed no obvious difference for all the perovskite films (Fig. S8, ESI†).

(c) Steady-state PL and (d) TRPL spectra of the pristine and treated perovskite films under photoexcitation at 400 nm with the samples fabricated on glass. 
Photoluminescence (PL) characterization was employed to unravel the effect of PCBM and ITIC on the perovskite. As shown in Fig. 4c, the PL intensity of all the treated perovskite films decreased a lot compared to the pristine perovskite, indicating the formation of the electron-accepting layer by small molecule treatment to ensure high electron-collection efficiency in the devices.32 Meanwhile, the PL peak for all treated films shifted toward the short wavelength compared with that of the pristine perovskite film, which demonstrated that PCBM:ITIC passivated the surface traps.14 Time-resolved PL (Tr-PL) measurements were also used to investigate the charge extraction from perovskite (Fig. 4d). As expected, the decay lifetimes of treated perovskite films decreased, supporting the claim that the introduction of the electron-accepting layer by small molecule treatment could facilitate the charge extraction from perovskite.

J
SC and VOC of all devices under different illumination intensities were measured. Fig. 5a shows the power law dependence (JSC ∝ Iα) of short circuit current density, where the α value is the slope of the plot.39 Here, the slope (α) is 0.94, 0.99, 0.96 and 0.98 for the devices based on the pristine, PCBM:ITIC mixture, PCBM and ITIC treated perovskite, respectively. The slightly increased α value for treated PVSCs suggested that bimolecular recombination in the devices was reduced.39Fig. 5b shows the plot of ΔVOCversus light intensity with a slope obtained from kT/q39 (where k is the Boltzmann constant, Tc is the cell temperature, and q is the elementary charge), which reflects the trap-assisted recombination.39 The device based on pristine perovskite films shows the highest slope of 2.02kT/q. However, the devices based on the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite delivered a minimum slope value of 1.65kT/q, proving the lowest energy loss caused by trap-assisted recombination.39 This is in good agreement with the results from the PL measurement.

(e) Trap density of the pristine and treated perovskite films. (f) Electron and hole mobility of the pristine and treated perovskite films. 
In order to study the charge mobility and trap state density in perovskite films, the J–V characteristics were measured in the dark for all films by employing electron-only and hole-only devices. Here, the onset voltage (trap-filled limited voltage VTFL) for the representative PCBM:ITIC mixture treated film is shown in Fig. 5c and d, while the device structures are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). A space-charge limited current (SCLC) model was used to study the charge mobility of the perovskite device through the Mott–Gurney law:40  
Using this formula, three regions could be delimited according to different values of the exponent n (J ∝ Vn relation, Fig. 5c). The trap state density was calculated using the following formula:  Here, L is the thickness of the film, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and εr is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite.22 As shown in Fig. 5e, the trap density of the treated devices decreased, compared to the pristine device. This result proved that the small molecule treatment passivated the defects in the perovskite layer, which is consistent with the results obtained above. The electron mobility and hole mobility of all the devices are listed in Fig. 5f. The PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite device held the highest mobility, implying more effective electron (or hole) transport in the treated perovskite films with fewer traps. This is likely to be one reason for the better device performance.
Furthermore, the stability of perovskite layers with or without small molecule treatment was investigated and all the samples were stored in an ambient environment (25 °C, 50% ±10 humidity). The color of the pristine perovskite film faded from brown to yellow after 30 days, but the color of the treated films remained almost unchanged (Fig. S10a, ESI†). As discussed for the contact angle measurement, a more hydrophobic surface formed after the small molecule treatment, which makes a contribution to the moisture stability of the perovskite films. Meanwhile, the stability of the corresponding devices was also studied and the normalized degradation of PCE versus time is shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†). After being stored in nitrogen at 25 °C for 60 days, the unencapsulated device based on the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite maintained 85% of the original PCE value, exhibiting superior stability than other PVSCs. The better stability could be attributed to the higher quality of the perovskite films with small molecule treatment.32
Experimental
Materials and solution preparation
Nickel oxide (NiOx) nanoparticles were prepared according to the literature,41 and then they were dispersed in deionized water with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1. A perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 922 mg of lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9985%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 318 mg of methylamine iodide (MAI, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a mixed solvent of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich) and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) (9:1 v/v ratio). PC61BM (20 mg mL−1, American Dye Source Inc.) was dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). Bathocuproine (BCP, 96.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1.
Solar cell fabrication
The structure of the PVSC device is ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag. First of all, detergent, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol were separately used for cleaning the ITO-coated glass substrates, followed by a 5 min plasma treatment. NiOx nanoparticles were spin coated on ITO at 2000 rpm for 30 s in air and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min. Then, the NiOx-deposited ITO was transferred into the nitrogen glove box. The perovskite film was prepared by depositing the perovskite precursor solution on the NiOx layer at 4000 rpm for 25 s. The CB solution (0.15 mL, with/without PCBM:ITIC (Solarmer Materials Inc.)) was dropped on the film as an anti-solvent at 10 s after the process starts. The well-crystallized perovskite films were obtained after thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The PCBM solution was deposited acting as an electron transport layer. Then, the BCP solution was spin-coated with a program of 4500 rpm for 1 min. Finally, the Ag anode (90 nm thick) was deposited on the prepared substrate by evaporation. The active area is 0.04 cm2. All devices were un-encapsulated and measured in nitrogen at room temperature.
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of perovskite solar cells were analyzed using a Keithley 2400 and a solar simulator (Abet Solar Simulator Sun 2000) with standard 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2) under nitrogen conditions. The EQE was measured by QE-R systems (Enli Tech.). AFM images were characterized using a MultiMode 8-HR (Bruker). SEM images were obtained by using a SU8020 scanning electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 8 kV. The GIXRD (D8A25 Discover) measurements were performed using a Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray diffractometer. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded by using a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU). The PL spectra were recorded using a FLS920 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd). TRPL spectra were measured by using a FLS920 spectrometer (Edinburgh). XPS maps were measured using a Thermo-VG scientific ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IRPrestige-21 spectrometer. The water contact angle measurement was performed by using a Krüss DSA100s drop shape analyzer.
Conclusions
In summary, a PCBM:ITIC mixture was introduced as two electron acceptors into perovskite by an anti-solvent method with a mixture interlayer formed on top of the perovskite successfully. The PCBM:ITIC mixture interlayer acted as an electron acceptor with a better energy alignment and an adjacent contact layer, facilitating electron extraction and transportation. Meanwhile, the PCBM:ITIC mixture passivated the Lewis acid/base defects of the perovskite and increased the charge mobility with a lower trap density. Thus, the PCE of the PVSCs was considerably increased from 14.00% to 16.99%. Besides, the stability of the PVSCs was improved because of a more hydrophobic surface forming on the PCBM:ITIC mixture treated perovskite film.
