    , Accepted 29th May 2016First published on 1st June 2016AbstractTwo novel donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type polymers based on indacenodithiophene (IDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) with thiophene (PIDT-t-TPD) or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (PIDT-tt-TPD) as π-bridges were designed and synthesized. The π-conjugated backbone length in the repeating unit of the polymer chain was varied by different π-bridges. Both polymers exhibit planar molecular structures, similar broad optical band gaps (Eoptg) and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. However, PIDT-tt-TPD with the more extended π-conjugated backbone shows higher hole mobility and better miscibility with (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PIDT-tt-TPD:PC71BM show the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.23% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.22 mA cm−2. Considering the limited absorption of PIDT-tt-TPD (400–650 nm), the Jsc value is very impressive. In contrast, PIDT-t-TPD: PC71BM only shows a PCE of 2.47% with a low Jsc of 5.52 mA cm−2. The lower Jsc value of PIDT-t-TPD is consistent with its limited external quantum efficiency (EQE) response (lower than 40%). The present results demonstrate that extending the length of a π-conjugated backbone by an appropriate π-bridge in the D–A polymer improves the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
Introduction
Donor–acceptor (D–A) based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) with fullerene acceptors have shown enormous potential for practical applications due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility, solution processing techniques as well as the inspiring power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 11% for single junctions in recent years.1–7 Compared to Si based inorganic solar cells, the relatively low PCE of PSCs is mainly due to the narrow absorption band and the low carrier mobility of conjugated polymers.8 The π-conjugated system of a polymer, which consists of fused ring aromatic moieties, is crucial for the delocalization of electrons and charge transportation.9–12 Theoretically, broad absorption and high charge carrier mobility can be prospected in polymers with the extended π-conjugated system,13 which are essential for a high short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, film morphology and absorption coefficient play vital roles for the value of Jsc as well.14,15 Besides, the extended conjugated system usually lowers the band gap through up-shift of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and down-shift of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level,16 which might result in a decreased open circuit voltage (Voc) or failure of exciton separation at D–A interfaces.17
Polymers based on the indacenodithiophene (IDT) donor have attracted much research interest because of their superior photovoltaic performance.18–26 The covalently forced structure in the IDT-backboned polymers with structural planarization and enlarged effective conjunction length could facilitate electron delocalization and enhance charge carrier mobility. Currently, studies involving further extended π-conjugated systems of IDT have shown that the π-conjugated backbone length in the repeating unit of the polymer chain plays an important role in affecting the performance of PSCs.15,22,27–33 Replacing the outward thiophene moiety of IDT with the extended thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) unit or inserting π-bridges such as thiophene or TT between the IDT donor and acceptor units has been proven to be effective strategies to extend the π-conjugated system of IDT backboned polymers. Through rational material design and device optimization, Alex and his coworkers reported a more extended IDT-indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT)-based donor–acceptor copolymer (PIDTT-DFBT), which presented a high PCE of 8.5% blended with (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methylester (PC71BM) by adopting a microcavity configuration.30 These studies illustrate that the extension of the effective π-conjugated system is a promising approach towards the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of fused-ring polymers. Nevertheless, proper attention needs to be paid to the solubility problems caused by extended fusion, which would cause negative impacts on coating and film morphology.28 The peripheral 4-hexylbenzyl groups in IDT units could tailor the intermolecular π–π interaction and improve the solubility to a certain extent.34 Besides, the alky-substituted units as π-bridges were usually introduced in between the donor and acceptor units to improve the solubility and molecular weight of the resulting polymers.35–38 Unfortunately, the alky side chains inevitably increase the dihedral angle between the neighboring aryls due to steric hindrance, which could inhibit polymer backbone planarity and disrupt the π-conjugated system.39 Therefore, further rational design and detailed investigation of the length on the π-conjugated backbone would be necessary to obtain desirable organic photovoltaic materials.
Recently, Christos and his co-workers reported that addition of the thiophene π-linker between D and A units exhibited a more extended repeat unit length in the polymer compared to the step increment conjugation length of the multifused donor building block.40 Their research illustrated that although the polymer with the extended fused structure showed broader absorption, the polymer with the thiophene π-linker showed better miscibility with fullerene derivatives and enhanced charge carrier mobility, which finally resulting the superior photovoltaic performance. In this regard, we designed and synthesized two D–π–A type copolymers based on the IDT donor unit and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) acceptor unit bridged by thiophene or TT, as shown in Schemes 1 and 2. The π-conjugated backbone length in the repeating unit of the polymer chain was controlled by the insertion of different π-bridges. TPD was chosen as an acceptor unit due to its compact, symmetric, and planar structure which could facilitate electron delocalization.41–48 The polymer based on TPD has shown good performance in PSCs with the highest PCE of over 8%.45 Meanwhile, polymers based on IDT and TPD units are less developed.16,19,49 To ensure the planarity as well as solubility, there was no alky-substituent appended to π-linker moieties,50,51 and a long 2-octyldodecyl chain was attached to the N position of TPD instead. The preliminary results show that both of the polymers have a planar molecular structure, but PIDT-tt-TPD with the more extended π-conjugated backbone shows higher hole mobility and better miscibility with PC71BM. Further investigation on photovoltaic performances indicates that devices based on PIDT-t-TPD or PIDT-tt-TPD present high Voc because of their low-lying HOMO energy level. As a result, the optimal PSC device based on PIDT-tt-TPD:PC71BM shows a high PCE of 5.23% with a high Jsc of 11.22 mA cm−2. Considering the limited absorption of PIDT-tt-TPD (400–650 nm), the Jsc value is very impressive. In contrast, PIDT-t-TPD:PC71BM only shows a PCE of 2.47% with a low Jsc of 5.52 mA cm−2. The lower Jsc value of PIDT-t-TPD is consistent with its limited EQE response (lower than 40%). Our results demonstrate that extending the length of the π-conjugated backbone by an appropriate π-bridge in D–A polymers could improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Both polymers depicted in Scheme 2 were synthesized by the Stille-coupling reaction between IDT-di-Tin and 1,3-bis(5-bromo-thiophene-2-yl)-5-(2-octyldodecyl)-4H-thino[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)dione (monomer T-TPD) or 1,3-bis(5-bromo-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-yl)-5-(2-octyldodecyl)-4H-thino[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)dione (monomer TT-TPD) using toluene as a solvent and a catalyst system of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3). The monomer IDT-di-Tin was purchased from a commercial source, monomers T-TPD and TT-TPD were synthesized using the reported methods,39,41 and the detailed synthetic routes are described in Scheme 1. The structures of monomers and polymers were confirmed using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†) and elemental analysis. After purification by precipitation from methanol and Soxhlet extraction, high yields of 72% and 78% were obtained for PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD, respectively. The resulting polymers can be readily dissolved in chlorinated solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB) and dichlorobenzene (DCB). But PIDT-tt-TPD has poor solubility in chloroform (CHCl3), which could be ascribed to the rigid TT unit as a π-bridge.28 Both polymers show high molecular weights, the number average molecular weight (Mn) of PIDT-t-TPD estimated by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method is 64.4 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.23, while PIDT-tt-TPD has a Mn of 71.0 kDa with a PDI of 1.27. Thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by thermal gravity analysis (TGA) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. The TGA plots (Fig. S4, ESI†) reveal that the onset temperatures with 5% weight-loss (Td) of PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD are 412 and 434 °C, respectively. The crystalline properties of pure polymers and polymer:PC71BM blend films were studied using an X-ray diffractometer (Fig. S5, ESI†). There are no peaks observed for polymers, indicating their amorphous nature.15,16,34
Optical properties
The optical properties of the two polymers were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectra in DCB solution at different temperatures and as the solid thin film state, which are shown in Fig. 1. Table 1 summarizes the optical data. Both the polymers in films exhibit broad overlapped absorption peaks.19,49 The longer wavelength absorbance is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between D and A segments, and the shorter wavelength absorbance at around 550 nm is attributed to the localized π–π* transition.19 The maximum extinction coefficients of PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD in solid films (shown in Fig. S7, ESI†) are 0.93 × 10−5 cm−1 and 1.05 × 10−5 cm−1, respectively. The higher extinction coefficient of PIDT-tt-TPD is beneficial for the light-harvesting in PSC devices. Notably, PIDT-tt-TPD shows stronger ICT peaks than PIDT-t-TPD in the room temperature solution. When the temperature of the solution was increased, the intensity of the ICT peak was declined and blue-shifted gradually. The ICT peak of PIDT-tt-TPD is still stronger even at 95 °C, but the ICT peak of PIDT-t-TPD is disappeared at around 75 °C. These phenomena demonstrated that the conjugation length will decrease upon heating because of greater twisting or decreased coplanarity of the polymer backbone,52 and PIDT-tt-TPD might retain its conjugation length to a certain extent or planar molecular structures, which is attributed to the rigidness of the TT-bridge compared to thiophene.33 Similar results can also be found in the absorption spectra of diluted solutions (Fig. S6, ESI†). The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD were calculated to be 1.91 eV and 1.90 eV, respectively, from the absorption edges of solid films.

Electrochemical properties
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the two polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in thin films. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the onsets of oxidation potential (Eox) and reduction potential (Ered) of PIDT-t-TPD were observed at +1.00 and −1.15 V. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energies calculated from the empirical formula EHOMO = −e (Eox + 4.80 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)) and ELUMO = −e (Ered + 4.80 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+))35 are −5.41 and −3.26 eV. The redox potential (E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)) of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) internal reference is 0.39 V vs. saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). To use the analogy, PIDT-tt-TPD presents an Eox of 0.95 V and an Ered of −1.19 V, corresponding to the HOMO and LUMO levels at −5.36 and −3.22 eV. Relevant data as well as the calculated electrochemical band gap (Eecg) are listed in Table 1. These deep HOMO locations are beneficial for obtaining high Voc in PSC devices, since Voc is mainly proportional to the offset of the HOMO of polymers and the LUMO of the fullerene derivatives.17 For better comparison, the electronic energy level diagram is described in Fig. 2(b). The LUMO gaps between the polymers and PC71BM are 0.74 eV and 0.78 eV for PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD. The sufficient energy offsets could guarantee the charge separation at donor/acceptor interfaces.

Theoretical calculations
To better understand the electronic structure, in particular, the molecular geometries of the polymers with different conjugated π-bridges between D and A units, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in the gas phase. To reduce the calculation cost, all alky side chains were replaced with methyl, and only one repeat D–A unit was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3, the simulation dihedral angles between the donor, π-bridge and acceptor are 9.64/0.24/0.19° and 10.78/0.16/0.47° for PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD, respectively. These relative small angles indicate that PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD have planar backbone structures. The stimulation HOMO electron density of both polymers is well delocalized along the donor and acceptor units, while the LUMO electron density is more localized at the acceptor and π-bridges. Moreover, PIDT-tt-TPD shows the more extended delocalization of electron density. This indicates that the energy levels and π-conjugated length can be controlled by different π-bridges.

Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance, the PSCs were fabricated on the 15 × 15 mm ITO glass substrates with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al configuration. Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices with the addition of varying proportions of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2.

The optimal weight ratio of PIDT-t-TPD (or PIDT-tt-TPD) and PC71BM was found to be 1:1.5. At this blend ratio, the PIDT-tt-TPD-based solar cells exhibit the best PCEs of 5.23%, with a Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 11.22 mA cm−2, and FF of 50.93% processing with 3% (v/v) DIO. Considering the limited absorption of PIDT-tt-TPD (400–650 nm), the Jsc value is very impressive.53 While the addition of DIO led to a reduction in the efficiency for the PIDT-t-TPD-based solar cells, the best PCE of 2.47% with a low Jsc of 5.52 mA cm−2 was achieved without any additives. It is worth noting that the average Voc value of PIDT-t-TPD (0.89 V) is lower than that of PIDT-tt-TPD (0.92 V), although PIDT-t-TPD has a deeper HOMO level. According to the previous studies, except for the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, the Voc can be affected by morphology, saturation dark current density, recombination dynamics, shunt resistance etc.52,54,55 We found a further decrease of Voc values when more addictives were added, which may result in severe aggregation.54,56 The inferior PCE of PIDT-t-TPD is mainly due to its low Jsc, which could be affected by absorption properties, morphology of the blending layer and charge carrier mobility.57–59 The notable difference can also be found in external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (shown in Fig. 5). It can be seen that both devices exhibit broad responses over the range of 310–650 nm. But the PIDT-tt-TPD based device showed a more intense photo-response, which could enhance the current density and explain the high value of Jsc. The integrated Jsc from EQE curves are 5.38 and 10.85 mA cm−2 for PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD devices, respectively, which matched well with the Jsc obtained from J–V curves.

Hole mobility
The hole mobility of the blend films obtained under optimal conditions was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S8, ESI†). The measured hole mobilities of blend films for PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD were 1.78 × 10−4 and 4.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher mobility of PIDT-tt-TPD indicated that the extension of the effective conjugation length by the TT π-bridge improves charge transport.
Morphology
Besides the hole mobility, the morphological quality of the films also contributes to the different device performances. The morphology of the best performance polymer:PC71BM blends was tested using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6). The obtained root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values from the AFM height images are 5.00 and 0.74 nm for the blend films of PIDT-t-TPD (Fig. 6(a)) and PIDT-tt-TPD (Fig. 6(b)) with PC71BM, respectively. The smoother surface of the PIDT-tt-TPD blend indicates suitable miscibility between the TT π-bridged polymers and PC71BM, which would help to decrease both contact resistance and leakage current, and thereby lead to a higher Jsc than PIDT-t-TPD.56 Serious phase separation of PIDT-t-TPD: PC71BM blend films can be observed from the AFM phase (Fig. 6(c)) and TEM image (Fig. 6(e)). The large phase domains on a scale of around 100 nm would diminish exciton migration at the interface of the donor/acceptor, which is unfavourable for the exciton separation. However, the homogeneous nanoscale phase separation within a few nanometers was observed at PIDT-tt-TPD:PC71BM blend film from the AFM phase (Fig. 6(d)) and TEM image (Fig. 6(f)), which is favorable for efficient exciton dissociation and leads to a higher Jsc and FF.15,25 With the influence of higher extinction coefficient, higher hole mobility and desirable film morphology, the PIDT-tt-TPD based PSC device showed a significantly higher Jsc than that of PIDT-t-TPD.

Experimental
Materials
Monomers T-TPD and TT-TPD were synthesized according to the reported procedures.39,41 Monomer IDT-di-Tin was purchased from SunaTech Inc. The corresponding 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†) and data of T-TPD, TT-TPD and IDT-di-Tin are shown in the ESI.† All of the commercially available reagents and compounds were used directly unless otherwise noted. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried over sodium, and distilled before use under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Synthesis procedure of polymers
To a 25 mL round-bottom flask, the monomer IDT-di-Tin (0.2 mmol, 246 mg), T-TPD (0.2 mmol, 151 mg), Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mg) and P(tol)3 (5 mg) were added. The mixture was degassed and purged with argon three times (15 minutes every time). Then 6 mL of toluene was added. The solution was heated to reflux and stirred for 20 h under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was precipitated in methanol (150 mL). The precipitate was collected by filtration and extracted by Soxhlet extraction with methanol and hexane to remove oligomers and catalysts. The residue was dissolved in DCB under heating and then transferred to a chromatographic column containing a short path of silica (80–100 mesh). The column was flushed with DCB. After removal of most solvents, the polymer was precipitated from methanol again and dried under vacuum.

PIDT-tt-TPD was synthesized using the same procedure as PIDT-t-TPD. TT-TPD (0.2 mmol, 867 mg) was used instead.

(%) for C102H117NO2S7: C 75.86%, H 7.25%, found: C 75.35%, H 7.12%.
Device fabrication and measurement
Conventional photovoltaic devices were fabricated on ITO glass (15 mm × 15 mm) as the anode and a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM blend (∼110 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in ultrapure water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. The substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 6 min, then spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 4000 rpm, and annealed in an oven for 20 min at 160 °C. The polymer and PC71BM were dissolved in deoxygenated anhydrous DCB in different weight ratios and the total concentration of the polymer/PC71BM blending solution was 25 mg mL−1. The solutions were stirred overnight in a nitrogen filled glove box. The DIO additives were added to the blend solution before spin-coating. An active layer consisting of the blend of the polymer and PC71BM was then spin coated on PEDOT:PSS. Under the vacuum of ∼2 × 10−4 Pa, Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited successively on the top of active layer as cathode. The cathode area defines the active area of the devices, which is 0.1 cm2. The photovoltaic performance was characterized under illumination with an AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2420. External quantum efficiencies of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized two D–π–A type polymers (PIDT-t-TPD and PIDT-tt-TPD) based IDT and TPD units with different π-bridges of thiophene or TT. The π-conjugated backbone length in the repeating unit of the polymer chain was varied by different π-bridges. Both polymers showed planar molecular structures without any alky-substituent attached to π-linker moieties. However, with the more extended TT π-bridge, PIDT-tt-TPD showed higher extinction coefficient, hole mobility and better miscibility with PC71BM. As a result, both polymers exhibit distinct photovoltaic properties. The PSC device based on PIDT-tt-TPD:PC71BM showed a higher EQE response and favorable film morphology with nanoscale phase separation compared to the PIDT-t-TPD based device. The optimized blend of PIDT-tt-TPD showed a high PCE of 5.23% with a Jsc of 11.22 mA cm−2 while the PIDT-t-TPD based device only showed a PCE of 2.47% with a low Jsc of 5.52 mA cm−2. This work indicates that extending the length of the π-conjugated backbone of the IDT-TPD based polymer by the TT π-bridge could enhance the PCE of PSCs. It also provides a strategy to further improve the photovoltaic properties of semiconductor polymers by controlling the D–A length in the polymer backbone using different π-bridges.
