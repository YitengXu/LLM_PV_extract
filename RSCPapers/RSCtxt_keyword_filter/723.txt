By using crosslinked PCBM as an interlayer and (HC(NH2)2)0.66(CH3NH3)0.34PbI2.85Br0.15 as the active layer, we achieve small area devices and modules with a maximum steady-state power conversion efficiency of 18.1% and 14.9%, respectively.
By virtue of their rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) and potential for low-cost mass production, organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising candidate to challenge the photovoltaic market in the near future.1 To date, the highest certified PCE of perovskite solar cells has reached 22.1%, which is close to that of their commercialized thin film counterparts such as CdTe-based solar cells.2
Apart from the quality of the perovskite active layer, the stability and efficiency of PSCs depend also on the interlayers between the electrodes and the active layer.3,4 At the cathode side, high temperature (>450 °C) annealed TiO2 electron transport layers (ETLs) are commonly used in state-of-the-art PSCs.5–7 However, such a high annealing temperature hinders the use of low-cost plastic substrates, and thus limits their potential for roll-to-roll production. Therefore, low temperature (<150 °C) processed n-type metal oxides like TiO2,8 ZnO,4,9 SnO2,10 and Zn2SnO4 (ref. 11) have been widely explored in order to replace high temperature annealed TiO2.
In addition to n-type metal oxide interlayers, fullerenes such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and C60 have proven to be excellent interlayers to improve the performance of PSCs.4,12–15 Such fullerene layers are usually incorporated into the so-called P–i–N structured perovskite solar cells, where the device fabrication starts with the deposition of a hole transport layer on the substrates. The incorporation of fullerenes into N–i–P structures, where the device fabrication starts with the deposition of an ETL on substrates, is limited by the lack of orthogonal solvent systems for device processing.13 For example, PCBM can be dissolved and washed away from the substrate with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), a common solvent for perovskite precursors. To address this problem, fullerene derivatives with robust resistance against DMF have been synthesized, and applied to N–i–P structured perovskite solar cells to improve their electron extraction capability.16–18 In this work, we introduce another approach to increase the solvent resistance of fullerenes by crosslinking commercial PCBM with 1,6-diazidohexane (DAZH).
DAZH can be synthesized in one step from readily available starting materials and has a good shelf life.19 Recently, McCulloch et al. showed that a thin film of PCBM can be crosslinked with DAZH to form higher molecular weight fullerene derivatives and oligomers.19 Initiated by a UV light curing process, highly reactive nitrenes are formed from DAZH, which will react with neighboring PCBM molecules through C–H insertion. Though it is difficult to determine the exact insertion site, Fig. 1a illustrates an example of a crosslinking reaction as well as the potential reaction sites on PCBM molecules. The increased solvent resistance of the crosslinked PCBM layer relative to a neat PCBM layer can be demonstrated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. As is shown in Fig. 1b, the PCBM film without DAZH is completely removed after washing with DMF, with no detectable absorption from PCBM. In the case of the crosslinked PCBM film with 15 wt% DAZH, there is still notable PCBM absorption observed, though the absorbance is 6 times lower. The thickness of the pristine PCBM film was measured to be 30 nm using a Dektak system. Assuming that the absorption coefficient of PCBM is not affected by adding DAZH, we can calculate the thickness of the remaining crosslinked PCBM layer to be about 5 nm according to the Lambert–Beer law.
 Fig. 1  (a) The photo-crosslinking mechanism and the possible reaction locations; (b) the UV-Vis spectra of the as-deposited PCBM films with and without DAZH, as well as the corresponding UV-Vis spectra after DMF washing. The DMF washing step was carried out after the UV curing process. The PCBM layers were deposited on ITO coated glass substrates. 
To investigate the effect of the crosslinked PCBM interlayer on the performance of PSCs, devices with a structure of ITO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3/doped Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated. Fig. 2a compares the typical current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of devices without an ETL, with pristine PCBM and with crosslinked PCBM from the reverse sweeps. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these three types of devices are shown in Fig. S1.† The detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The devices without an ETL and with pristine PCBM give similar PCEs of 12.1% and 11.9% from J–V sweeps, respectively. This is consistent with the above UV-Vis results that indicate the removal of the pristine PCBM interlayer by DMF during the processing of the perovskite layer. However, for the device with crosslinked PCBM as the ETL, the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) are significantly improved, resulting in a superior PCE of 14.9%. Furthermore, the parasitic absorption from the thin 5 nm crosslinked PCBM film is low, and thus the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is not affected.

It is worth noting that hysteresis was observed for all these devices, though devices with the crosslinked PCBM interlayer show less hysteresis under the same measurement conditions (Fig. S2†). In order to overcome the errors introduced by the hysteresis and to have a more accurate assessment on the device performance, the steady-state PCEs under constant voltage bias and continuous illumination were measured (Fig. 2b). The bias voltages were chosen to be the maximum power point voltages from the reverse J–V sweeps for each device. The devices without an ETL and with pristine PCBM show much lower steady-state PCEs compared to the PCE values obtained from the J–V sweeps. This is similar to the results of previously reported PSCs lacking selective charge transport layers.20 The device with crosslinked PCBM, however, gives a steady-state PCE of 14.5% after 5 min of operation, which is very close to the value measured from the reverse J–V sweeps.
The aforementioned experiments indicate that the crosslinked PCBM interlayer survives the perovskite layer processing, and effectively improves the device performance. Nevertheless, with a HOMO level of −6.0 eV,3 the hole blocking ability of PCBM is relatively poor. This can increase the chance of carrier recombination at the ITO/ETL interface and limit the further improvement of the device performance. Therefore, in order to increase the carrier selectivity of the contact, an additional hole blocking layer was deposited between ITO and the crosslinked PCBM layer. Two types of hole blocking layers were chosen, i.e. TiO2 and polyethyleneimine (PEIE), to assess the versatility of this approach. TiO2 has a much deeper HOMO (−8.0 eV) compared to PCBM, while PEIE will create interfacial dipoles that block holes.3
Devices using TiO2, TiO2/crosslinked PCBM, PEIE, and PEIE/crosslinked PCBM as ETLs were fabricated, while the active layer (CH3NH3PbI3) and the hole transport layer (doped Spiro-OMeTAD) were kept the same. Fig. 2c shows the typical J–V curves of these devices from reverse sweeps, and their EQE curves are presented in Fig. S1b.† The detailed photovoltaic parameters are also summarized in Table 1. Compared to those of the devices with only crosslinked PCBM as the ETL, the Voc of the devices with the double ETLs is dramatically increased, which is consistent with our assumption that the additional hole blocking layer can reduce the interface recombination at the cathode. As a result, much higher PCEs of 17.1% and 16.5% can be achieved for these double ETL devices compared to the ones with crosslinked PCBM only. In addition, for both double ETL cases, the steady-state PCEs under constant bias are almost the same as the PCE values obtained from the reverse J–V sweeps (Fig. 2d). Moreover, perovskite solar cells with a double ETL significantly outperform those with only a TiO2 or PEIE single ETL. The device with a single PEIE ETL barely works and shows a PCE of only 1.3%, while the device with a single TiO2 ETL has a much lower steady-state PCE (12.9%) compared to the PCE measured from the J–V sweeps (15.8%). This again demonstrates the effectiveness and versatility of the crosslinked PCBM interlayer in improving the performance of PSCs. Devices with pristine PCBM coated TiO2 and PEIE ETLs were also fabricated. However, no significant improvement in performance was observed. The steady-state PCEs of the devices with TiO2/PCBM and PEIE/PCBM are 13.3% and 0.9%, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S1†).
It has been reported previously that the morphology of the perovskite layer shows a strong correlation with that of the underlying layer.8,21,22 In order to gain more insight into how the crosslinked PCBM interlayer improves the device performance, we investigated the morphologies of the CH3NH3PbI3 layers deposited on different ETLs by studying the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. From the XRD patterns (Fig. 3a), we find an identical perovskite crystal structure with similar peak intensities independent of the underlying ETL, indicating that the crystallinity of the perovskite films is barely affected by the ETLs. From the top-view SEM images (Fig. S4†), all the samples show a pinhole-free morphology. Small changes in the grain size can be observed between the samples deposited on different ETLs, with the appearance of some large grains for the sample deposited on TiO2 without crosslinked PCBM. However, since the change of the grain size is not significant, the effect of different grain sizes on the device performance can be very limited. These observations indicate that the enhanced performance of the devices involving crosslinked PCBM may not be related to bulk morphological reasons, but it can be attributed to the better electron extraction from the perovskite layer to the crosslinked PCBM layer.
 Fig. 3  (a) The XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on different ETLs; (b) steady-state PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 films on different ETLs; (c) time resolved PL measurements of the CH3NH3PbI3 films on different ETLs, taken at an emission wavelength of 770 nm; (d) a comparison of the work function of different ETLs measured using KPFM, with the work function of ITO taken to be 4.7 eV. 
To give further evidence to this, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching (Fig. 3b) and time-resolved PL decay measurements (Fig. 3c) were carried out for the CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on the different ETLs. This technique has been employed by different research groups to evaluate the carrier extraction from the active layer to the charge transport layer.18,21,23–25 A higher PL quenching can be achieved when a crosslinked PCBM layer is under the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, compared to the other cases. Correspondingly, the PL lifetime is also shorter when CH3NH3PbI3 is interfaced with crosslinked PCBM, TiO2/crosslinked PCBM, or PEIE/crosslinked PCBM. Considering the same quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 bulk films, as indicated by XRD and SEM, the PL results are in line with our assumption that electron extraction from the perovskite to the crosslinked PCBM layer is more efficient. In addition, although identical PL quenching and PL lifetime are measured for CH3NH3PbI3 on TiO2 and PEIE, the device using only PEIE as the ETL performs much worse than that using only TiO2. This is probably because the PL quenching in the PEIE case is mainly related to surface recombination rather than to charge transfer, which is indicated by the low Voc and extremely low Jsc.
We further measured the work function of the different ETLs on ITO substrates using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The surface potential mapping images show that the surface potential is homogenous over the areas measured for each ETL (Fig. S5†). Although the absolute work function values from KPFM measurements may not be accurate, the relative work function comparison between the different layers is still valid. Here, we took the work function of ITO to be 4.7 eV as reported in the literature,3,26 and then correlated the average work functions of the other ETLs from the KPFM measurements (averaged over the scanned areas) to the known value for ITO (Fig. 3d). As expected, all ETLs with crosslinked PCBM show similar work functions. A crosslinked PCBM layer on TiO2 upshifts the work function of TiO2 by about 0.2 eV. The lower work function of TiO2/crosslinked PCBM may partially account for the improved Voc of the corresponding devices. Interestingly, even though PEIE shows the lowest work function, the device based on PEIE performs poorly. In contrast, the device based on PEIE/crosslinked PCBM shows a much better performance, though the crosslinked PCBM downshifts the work function of PEIE by about 0.1 eV. As also indicated by the PL results, such an improved device performance may be related to the reduced surface recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface, due to the passivation effects of crosslinked PCBM.18 Combining all the results from the different characterizations, we believe that the effects of crosslinked PCBM on the performance of perovskite solar cells are threefold: (1) increased electron extraction, (2) improved energy level alignment and (3) decreased surface recombination.
Recently, mixed perovskites such as (HC(NH2)2)1−x(CH3NH3)xPbI3−yBry have been used to obtain more efficient photovoltaic cells compared to CH3NH3PbI3.5–7,27,28 Here, we screened the compatibility of these material systems with our new double ETLs, using devices with a structure of ITO/TiO2/crosslinked PCBM/(HC(NH2)2)1−x(CH3NH3)xPbI3−yBry/doped Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Although it is difficult to determine the exact composition of our mixed perovskite layer, we calculated the composition from the ratio of the used precursors to be (HC(NH2)2)0.66(CH3NH3)0.34PbI2.85Br0.15, which is close to the optimal one reported by Hagfeldt et al.27 The top-view (Fig. S6†) and the cross-sectional (Fig. 4a, inset) SEM images show that smooth and pinhole-free films of this mixed perovskite material can be achieved, with a thickness of around 450 nm. Compared to those of CH3NH3PbI3, the XRD peaks of (HC(NH2)2)0.66(CH3NH3)0.34PbI2.85Br0.15 are slightly shifted to smaller diffraction angles, indicating the increase of the lattice parameters due to the incorporation of HC(NH2)2+ (Fig. S7†).28

The J–V curves of our best device based on the above-mentioned mixed perovskite are presented in Fig. 4a. Measured with reverse sweeps, it gives a PCE of 18.4% under 98.6 mW cm−2 irradiance, with a Jsc of 21.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.05 V, and a FF of 79.1%. Due to the hysteresis, an inferior PCE of 16.4% is obtained with forward sweeps, with a Jsc of 21.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.03 V, and a FF of 72.2%. The Jsc calculated from the EQE curve plotted in Fig. 4b is equal to 21.1 mA cm−2, which is comparable to the value obtained from the J–V sweeps. Despite the device hysteresis, the steady-state PCE under constant bias and continuous illumination is close to the value measured with the reverse J–V sweeps, showing a PCE of 18.1% after 5 min of operation (Fig. 4c). Moreover, a histogram of 96 devices with different substrates is given in Fig. 4d, indicating a narrow PCE distribution and good reproducibility of these devices. Such a homogeneity in the device performance also enables us to fabricate large area perovskite solar modules with a high aperture PCE, using the same layer stack. The perovskite solar module has the same design as that shown in our previous work, with an aperture area of 4 cm2 (Fig. S8†).29 As is shown in Fig. S9a,† our module gives a Voc of 4.05 V, a short circuit current of 20 mA and a FF of 74%, resulting in a maximum power output of 59.9 mW with a 4 cm2 aperture area. Since the irradiance is 100 mW cm−2, the aperture PCE of our module is equal to 14.9%. Moreover, an identical steady-state PCE of 14.9% is shown in Fig. S9b.†
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that crosslinked PCBM layers are resistant against solvents like DMF, and can be used as an efficient electron extraction interlayer to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. Due to their relatively poor hole blocking ability, an additional hole blocking layer such as TiO2 or PEIE is required under the crosslinked PCBM, in order to get the optimal device performance. With a mixed perovskite material, (HC(NH2)2)0.66(CH3NH3)0.34PbI2.85Br0.15, we are able to achieve small area perovskite solar cells with a maximum PCE of 18.4%, as well as 4 cm2 perovskite solar modules with a maximum aperture PCE of 14.9%. Our approach of using crosslinked charge transport layers opens a new direction to overcome the solvent incompatibility during device processing and also to design novel charge transport materials.
Experimental section
Materials
The glass substrates with patterned ITO electrodes were obtained from Colorado Concept Coatings. PbI2 powder was purchased from TCI Chemicals. CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br, and CH(NH2)2I were obtained from Dyesol. PCBM and DAZH were received from Nano-C and Imperial College London, respectively. The synthesis of DAZH was reported in ref. 19. Spiro-OMeTAD was bought from Lumtec. Anhydrous solvents, i.e. DMF, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), isopropanol, and chlorobenzene, were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
Preparation of the ETLs
The pristine crosslinked PCBM layer was prepared by spin coating a 10 mg mL−1 PCBM solution in chlorobenzene onto an ITO substrate at 2000 rpm. For the crosslinked PCBM layer, 10 mg mL−1 PCBM in chlorobenzene with the addition of 15 wt% DAZH was spin coated onto an ITO substrate at 2000 rpm. Then, it was illuminated with UV light (254 nm) for 15 min for photo-crosslinking. The TiO2 layer was evaporated at a rate of 1 Å s−1 onto ITO substrates by reactive electron beam evaporation. To maintain the stoichiometry of the film, a partial O2 pressure of 1.7 × 10−4 Torr during the deposition was introduced. To get the PEIE layer, a 0.1 wt% PEIE solution in 2-methoxy ethanol was spin coated onto ITO at 3000 rpm, followed by a 10 min thermal annealing step at 100 °C.
Preparation of the perovskite layers
A two-step inter-diffusion method was applied to fabricate the perovskite layers. For CH3NH3PbI3, a 461 mg mL−1 PbI2 solution in DMF with a small portion of DMSO as an additive (PbI2:DMSO = 1:1, molar ratio) was first spin coated onto the substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then, a 50 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I solution in isopropanol was spin coated onto the PbI2 layer at 3000 rpm for another 30 s. Afterwards, the substrate was annealed at 100 °C for 15 min in order to form the perovskite crystal structure. To make the (HC(NH2)2)0.66(CH3NH3)0.34PbI2.85Br0.15 films, the same procedure as that for CH3NH3PbI3 was followed, except for the use of a mixed CH(NH2)2I, CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Br solution instead of pure CH3NH3I in isopropanol. The molar ratio of CH(NH2)2I, CH3NH3I and CH3NH3Br was maintained at 0.66:0.19:0.15.
Device fabrication
The ITO coated glass was cleaned with ultrasonic baths of detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol each for 10 minutes. Then, different ETLs were deposited according to the methods mentioned above. On the ETLs, CH3NH3PbI3 or (HC(NH2)2)0.66(CH3NH3)0.34PbI2.85Br0.15 films were fabricated. The perovskite films were made in an N2 filled glovebox. After that, an 80 mg mL−1 Spiro-OMeTAD solution doped with 17.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 28.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine was spin-coated onto the perovskite films. The perovskite films coated with Spiro-OMeTAD were then exposed to air overnight for Spiro-OMeTAD oxygen doping. The small area devices were completed by depositing an 80 nm Au layer onto the Spiro-OMeTAD through shadow masks, defining an active area of 0.13 cm2. The perovskite solar modules were fabricated using the same method described in our previous work.29
Characterization
The UV-Vis measurement was carried out on a SHIMADZU UV-1601PC spectrophotometer. The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images were obtained from an FEI Nova 200 scanning electron microscope. The X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro Materials Research Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The PL measurement was done using a Hamamatsu Near Infrared Compact Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer C12132. The wavelength of the incident light radiation was 532 nm. KPFM scans were obtained with a Bruker Multimode 8, mounted with a Pt/Ir coated tip with a nominal spring constant between 1 and 5 nm. Surface potential was detected during an interleave scan at a height of 115 nm over the samples' surface. The photovoltaic characteristics of the devices were measured under a nitrogen atmosphere using a Keithley 2602A Source-Measure Unit and an Abet solar simulator with simulated AM1.5G illumination. The light irradiance was calibrated with a KG5 bandpass filter equipped with an ISE Fraunhofer certified Si photodiode. The devices were measured from forward to reverse bias, or from reverse bias to forward bias, with a scan speed of 1 V s−1. The EQE was measured with a photospectrometer setup (Bentham PVE300) by illuminating the solar cell with modulated monochromatic light (Xe and quartz halogen lamps). It was carried out with a chopping frequency of 377 Hz but without light bias. The spectral resolution was 5 nm. The steady-state PCEs over illumination time were recorded by loading the devices at the maximum power point identified from the reverse J–V scan.
