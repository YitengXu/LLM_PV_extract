    , Accepted 28th November 2012First published on 29th November 2012AbstractThe single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires are of considerable interest for use as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) since they can provide direct pathways for efficient charge transport and collection. The alkali hydrothermal route has been studied extensively to achieve these nanostructures, but is limited by a relatively complex procedure, requiring at least three steps including hydrothermal growth, ion exchange, and calcinations. In this study, a facile one-step ammonia hydrothermal approach was developed for the first time to grow single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires in the absence of exotic reagents or templates. The growth parameters such as growth time, reaction temperature, and ammonia concentration have been investigated in detail to achieve the morphology control. A growth mechanism controlled by a dissolution–recrystallization process has been proposed for formation of anatase TiO2 nanowires. An overall power conversion efficiency of 7.10% has been achieved by using these anatase TiO2 nanowires under simulated air mass 1.5 global sunlight, is significantly higher than that derived from P25 nanoparticles (5.57%). The electrical impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that the great improvement in the photovoltaic performance of DSCs based on TiO2 nanowires is mainly attributed to an effective retardation of the charge recombination and consequently enhanced electron lifetime.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), as a promising candidate for next generation solar cells, have attracted much attention in recent years because of their low production cost, facile fabrication process and respectable power conversion efficiency.1 Although the highest efficiency of 12.3% for DSC has already been achieved,2 researchers are still seeking innovative ways to further enhance the performance and durability of the devices by using alternative sensitizers,2,3 redox electrolytes,2,4 counter electrodes5 and nanostructured photoanode materials.6 As is well known, TiO2 nanomaterials with well-controlled shapes, sizes, crystalline phase, and structures play a critical role in determining the performance of DSCs.7 The remarkable breakthrough in DSCs was reached by the introduction of a mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle layer to provide a large internal surface area for anchoring sufficient dye molecules.8 However, the nanoparticle films are not thought to be ideal in structure with regard to electron transport. Recent studies indicate that electron transport is a limiting factor in the performance of nanoparticle based DSCs since photogenerated electrons may undertake a random walk through the mesoporous nanoparticle film and experience a million trapping and detrapping events in the contact region between nanoparticles.6,9
Single crystal TiO2 nanowires and nanorods have been of particular interest because their nonwoven fabric morphology can suppress the aggregation and grain growth at high calcination temperature, and therefore provide direct pathways for efficient charge transport and collection, which are distinct from those of TiO2 nanostructures in the form of nanoparticles, polycrystalline nanowires and nanotubes.10–12 The hydrothermal synthesis appears to be the most effective method for growing one-dimensional single crystal TiO2 nanostructures.13 For example, the hydrochloric acid assisted hydrothermal method has been intensively investigated in an effort to produce single crystal rutile TiO2 nanowires and nanorods.14–16 The role of hydrochloric acid in the nanowire formation is to avoid fast hydrolysis of the titanium precursor and supply chloride ions. In very recent work, we reported on a new non-hydrochloric acid assisted process that forms single crystal rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays via a synergistic interaction of self-supplied chloride ions from titanium precursor and octanoic acid.17 The above reported DSCs made from single crystal rutile TiO2 nanowires showed an energy conversion efficiency of 3–5% and did not achieve the anticipated results.
It is generally recognized that anatase is the preferred crystal structure for efficient functioning of the DSCs since ruthenium-based sensitizer is easily adsorbed on the exposed anatase (101) surface for anchoring many more dye molecules, and charge separation and transportation in the anatase layer are much more favorable than those in the rutile photoanodes.1,18,19 However, it is very challenging to achieve anatase nanowire structures because anatase TiO2 adopts a distorted and saw-tooth-like octahedron edge-sharing packing arrangement, whereas the octahedron corner-sharing motif of the thermodynamically more stable rutile phase is more accommodating to axial growth.20,21 Considerable efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of the single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires by using the alkaline hydrothermal method.13 However, during the past decade, the conventional routes for the growth of such structures rely on the participation of high concentration NaOH or KOH, and it is a relatively complex procedure requiring at least three steps: (1) an alkali hydrothermal process to grow sodium titanate nanowires from reaction of titanium foil or TiO2 powder with NaOH or KOH solution; (2) an ion-exchange reaction to convert sodium titanate nanowires to protonated bititanate nanowires; (3) a calcination procedure to transform the protonated bititanate nanowires to single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires22–26 or TiO2-B nanowires.27 Therefore, it is highly desirable but challenging to develop new fabrication techniques for fabricating single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires through a one-step hydrothermal route. It is generally believed that anatase TiO2 formation is favored in basic solution due to the presence of excessive hydroxyl ions.28,29 We therefore expected that single crystal anatase nanowires could also be formed by replacement of the concentrated NaOH or KOH with ammonia under the appropriate reaction conditions.
Here, we report a facile and efficient one-step ammonia hydrothermal route to prepare single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires in the absence of exotic reagents or templates. The resulting single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires grow along [010] direction with specifically exposed (101) facet. By applying TiO2 nanowires in DSCs, an overall energy conversion efficiency up to 7.10% has been achieved, demonstrating their potential application in highly efficient DSCs.
Experimental
Synthesis of TiO2 nanowire samples
All chemical reagents are of analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 1 mL titanium tetrachloride was added to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL) containing 60 mL of 25% (w/w) ammonia solution under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. Afterwards, the sealed autoclave was heated at 180 °C for 48 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The resulting precipitates were collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times. Finally, they were dried under vacuum at 60 °C for further use. Effects of reaction time, temperature, as well as ammonia concentration on the morphologies of products were also investigated.
Photoanode preparation and DSC assembly
To prepare the screen-printable TiO2 paste, 6 g of TiO2 nanowires was mixed with 1 mL of acetic acid, 25 g of terpinol (anhydrous, #86480, Fluka), 3 g of ethyl cellulose powder (30–50 mPa s, #46080, Fluka) and 50 mL of ethanol. Subsequently, they were ground mechanically in a planetary ball mill using zirconia grinding media at 600 rpm for 12 h. Finally, the obtained slurry was concentrated by rotary-evaporation to remove ethanol and water. As a comparison, the screen-printable paste made from P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa AG) was also prepared according to the same procedure.
A layer of TiO2 paste was coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass (8 Ω per square, 2.2 mm thick, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd.) by the screen-printing procedure, and then dried at 125 °C for 6 min. The coating and drying procedures were repeated until a desired thickness of TiO2 film was obtained. The FTO substrates coated with TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After that, they were immersed in a 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride aqueous solution at 70 °C for 1 h, then rinsed with deionized water and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, they were immersed in 1:1 volume ratio of ethanol and acetonitrile solution containing 5 × 10−4 M ruthenium bipyridyl dye (N719 dye, Solaronix) and kept at 80 °C for 6 h. The Pt precursor, a solution of 5 × 10−3 M hexachloroplatinic acid in isopropanol, was deposited onto FTO glass by the spin coating process. Then, the platinized electrodes were obtained by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid at 380 °C for 20 min. The photoanodes and counter electrodes were assembled and sealed as sandwiched DSCs using a surlyn spacer (50 μm thick, DuPont). The electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v) was finally introduced into the DSCs by a vacuum filling method. The active area of the cells is 0.196 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was observed by high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL). The crystal structure of the samples was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were performed with a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM2010) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCALAB-250) was measured with monochromatized Al Kα radiation in the energy range of 0–1103 eV at room temperature. The film thickness was characterized by the 3D optical profiling system (Wyko NT1100). The pore characteristics and surface area were analyzed by a nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus (ASAP 2020M, Micromeritics). The measurement of dye loading on the TiO2 films was carried out by desorbing the absorbed dye in 0.1 M NaOH solution and then determined spectrometrically from a calibration curve of the dye absorption at λ = 502 nm using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-4100).24 The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves were measured by a source meter (Keithley 2400) under an illumination of a solar simulator (Newport's Oriel 91192) under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2 was determined by a standard silicon solar cell, 25 °C). Electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760C, CH Instruments) with a 5 mV AC signal over the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz under 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
Results and discussion
Characteristics of nanowires

Fig. 1a shows TEM image of the as-prepared nanowire sample. The diameter of typical nanowire sample is 20 nm. The corresponded SAED reveals that the TiO2 nanowire has a single crystal anatase structure (Fig. 1b). The density functional theory calculations have shown that the anatase (101) surface is the lowest energy surface and frequently exposed surface.30 HRTEM shows that the distance between the adjacent lattice fringes is 0.355 nm (Fig. 1c and S1†), which can be assigned to the interplane distance of the anatase TiO2 (101) planes. The [101] axis is perpendicular to the nanowire side wall, and the nanowire grows along the [010] direction, consistent with the SAED result. The ball-and-stick models of the corresponded TiO2 nanowire show that it has a saw-tooth-like morphology with five-fold coordinated Ti (Ti5c) and two-fold coordinated surface O (O2c) atoms arranged in rows along the [010] direction (Fig. 1d and e). From the XRD pattern (Fig. 1f), the nanowires can be further confirmed as anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS no. 71-1166, SG, I41/amd; a = b = 0.3784 nm and c = 0.9515 nm). Furthermore, the strong and sharp diffraction peaks indicate the good crystallinity of as-prepared nanowires.

The panoramic morphologies of the samples are shown in Fig. 2a, indicating that large-scale, monodisperse and uniform nanowires were obtained. As shown by the high magnification FESEM image in Fig. 2b, TiO2 nanowires were randomly oriented with diameters of 18–25 nm, and lengths in the range of 450 nm to 500 nm.

The XPS patterns of the above TiO2 nanowire sample were also measured (Fig. S2, ESI†). O element with peak located at 529.75 eV (O1s) was observed. Furthermore, the two feature peaks of Ti2p states situated at 458.5 eV (Ti2p3/2) and 464.2 eV (Ti2p1/2) were also detected. The separation of 5.7 eV between the doublet peaks (2p3/2 and 2p1/2) is characteristic of titanium in the IV oxidation state, as in titania.31
Effects of ammonia concentration
Keeping the total volume of the growth solution constant while increasing the volume of ammonia solution with respect to the volume of deionized water would favor the formation of nanowires. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of products after hydrothermal treatment of 1 mL of titanium tetrachloride in 60 mL of 0% w/w, 12.5% w/w, and 18.75% w/w ammonia solutions at 180 °C for 48 h. When 1 mL titanium tetrachloride was added into 60 mL deionized water (0% w/w ammonia), no nanowires were formed after hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 3a and b). When a 12.5% w/w aqueous ammonia solution was used, relatively short nanowires were formed (Fig. 3c and d). On further increasing the ammonia concentration to 18.75% w/w, the resultant nanowires became longer (Fig. 3e and f). With an increase of the ammonia concentration to 25% w/w, the length of nanowires was further increased, and the obtained nanowires were monodispersed and well shaped (Fig. 2a and b). The ammonia concentration effect reflects that the nanowire growth kinetics is possibly governed by the hydroxyl group, which was related to the ammonia concentration.

Effects of reaction temperature

Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the nanowires after hydrothermal treatment of 1 mL of titanium tetrachloride in 60 mL of ammonia solution (25% w/w) for 48 h at temperatures varying from 120 °C to 230 °C. At lower temperature (such as 120 °C) nanowires are not produced, but a mixture of microspheres and irregular shaped structures are produced (Fig. 4a and b). When increasing the temperature to 150 °C, some nanowires accompanied by many nanodots emerged (Fig. 4c and d). When the temperature was further increased to 180 °C, large-scale, monodispersed, well shaped, and high aspect ratio nanowires were obtained (Fig. 2a and b). If the reaction temperature was further extended to over 230 °C, the diameters of the nanowires became larger whereas the lengths of the nanowires remained unchanged (Fig. 4e and f).

Impacts of reaction time
The time-dependent experiments were performed to reveal the formation process of nanowire structures, as shown in Fig. 5. The morphology of products collected at an early stage exhibited a microspherical shape with a rough surface and a diameter of 1–2 μm after 1 h of reaction (Fig. 5a). Prolonging the growth time to 6 h, the structure of the microspheres was destroyed, and many microsphere fragments appeared (Fig. 5b). As the reaction proceeded to 9 h, many irregularly shaped particles formed (Fig. 5c), and their sizes were obviously smaller than that of the initial microspheres. With an increase of reaction time up to 24 h, agglomerate nanowires accompanied by nanodots began to form (Fig. 5d and e). Monodispersed, well shaped nanowires were obtained after 48 h of growth (Fig. 2a and b). When the growth time was further extended to over 72 h, the diameter of the nanowires became larger while the length of the nanowires remained essentially unchanged (Fig. 5f). Time dependent XRD measurements show that the structure of the products is transformed from the amorphous state to an anatase crystalline state with the increase of reaction time (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Discussion on the formation mechanism
It can be seen from the above controlled experiments that the reaction time, ammonia concentration and hydrothermal temperature are the key parameters in determining the evolution of morphology. Based on the time dependent experiments, we propose a possible growth mechanism involving dissolution–recrystallization process for the formation of nanowires.32 Initially, a titanium precursor was dissolved in ammonia solution, resulting in the formation of a lot of nuclei (Scheme 1a), which quickly aggregated into primary amorphous spherical structures (Scheme 1b). The further formation of crystallized self-assembly nanowires may follow dissolution–recrystallization of primary particle aggregates (Scheme 1c–e). Finally, the fully well developed nanowires were formed through the Ostward ripening process,33 and accompanying nanodots disappeared (Scheme 1f). During this process, the hydrothermal treatment leads to dehydroxylation of Ti(OH)4 into crystallized TiO2. The high concentration of ammonia in solution produce the excessive hydroxyl ions, which would be localized at the neighboring sites of the TiO6 octahedrons, and result in anisotropic growth of crystal nucleus in [010] direction. In such a way the disordered precursor structure will crystallize into the anatase nanowires due to the dissolution and recrystallization process. The reaction processes in this system could be illustrated by eqn (1) and (2).29 Ti4+ + 4NH4OH → Ti(OH)4↓ + 4NH4Cl(1) Ti(OH)4 → TiO2(Anatase) + 2H2O(2)

Effect of calcinations
It is important for nanomaterials to maintain their morphologies and crystal structures after the high temperature calcination while they are applied in DSCs. It could be seen that the morphologies and crystal structure of the nanowires remained unchanged after being sintered at 500 °C for 1 h (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Performance of DSCs
The photovoltaic performance characteristics of DSCs made from TiO2 nanowires were measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) sunlight. For comparison, the DSCs consisting of commercial P25 TiO2 nanoparticles were also investigated. The photovoltaic parameters of DSCs made from TiO2 nanowires and P25 nanoparticles with different thicknesses are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 6 shows the typical photocurrent density versus voltage curves of DSCs made from TiO2 nanowires and P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. The best performance of DSCs based on TiO2 nanowire was achieved by using a 21.8 μm thick film. The photovoltaic parameters showed a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.89 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 770 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, yielding an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.10%. In contrast, the photovoltaic parameters of DSC using a 22.1 μm thick P25 nanoparticle film showed a JSC of 13.43 mA cm−2, a VOC of 709 mV, and a FF of 0.58 to give a η of 5.57%. The results show that a remarkable enhancement of 27.5% in the conversion efficiency was achieved for DSC based on TiO2 nanowires than that derived from P25 nanoparticles. The key observation here is that the higher efficiencies of DSCs made from TiO2 nanowires are attributed to larger open-circuit voltages and fill factors instead of short-circuit current density, as compared to those made of P25 nanoparticles with similar film thickness.

 Fig. 6  Current density–voltage curves of DSCs prepared from TiO2 nanowires and P25 nanoparticles, respectively. 
To obtain better insight into the factors contributing to efficiency, the specific surface area and dye adsorption capacity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of TiO2 nanowires and P25 nanoparticles were measured. The isotherms of a nanowire sample display a type IV curve with a H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification (Fig. S5a, ESI†), indicating the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm).34 The specific surface area of nanowires, as calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, is up to 54.34 m2 g−1, which is very close to that of the P25 nanoparticles (54.71 m2 g−1). The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution derived from the isotherm exhibits a narrow pore size distribution centered at 2.3 nm for nanowire sample (see inset of Fig. S5a, ESI†). However, P25 powder shows a wide pore size distribution centered at 22.7 nm (the inset of Fig. S5b, ESI†). Therefore, it is not easy for nanowires to absorb dye molecules due to higher diffusion resistance through smaller voids of the inter-nanowires although it has the same BET surface area as P25 particles. As a result, the amount of absorbed dye for the nanowires is lower than that of the nanoparticles at the same film thickness (Table 1). For DSCs, the amount of dye loading on the TiO2 electrode affects its current density, therefore, the short-circuit current density of DSCs based on nanowire is slightly lower than that of DSCs based on P25 nanoparticles with similar film thickness, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1.

Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist plots and Bode phase of DSCs at the applied bias of VOC under one sun light illumination and a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 105 Hz. Fig. 7a shows results from electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra. Two well-defined semicircles, representing the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the Pt/electrolyte interface and electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, were observed in the high-frequency region (>1 kHz) and in the frequency region of 100 to 1 Hz, respectively.35 Furthermore, the characteristics of diffusion of the I−/I3− redox electrolytes electron are elucidated in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 0.1 Hz.36 An equivalent circuit (see inset of Fig. 7a) was used to fit the Nyquist plots to estimate the electron transport parameters such as sheet resistance (RS), charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R1) and charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (R2). As shown in Table 2, two DSCs show similar values of RS and R1 due to the use of the same electrolyte and counter electrodes. However, the charge transfer resistance R2 (7.20 Ω) of DSCs based on nanowire is obviously smaller than that of DSCs based on P25 nanoparticles (22.08 Ω), hence denoting the more superior charge transport characteristics in single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowire photoanode. These results can also be further confirmed by the corresponding Bode phase of DSCs in Fig. 7b. It has been reported that the peak frequency of the range between 1 Hz and 103 Hz is inversely proportional to the electron lifetime.36 The lifetime of electrons in the TiO2 films can be estimated from the following formula:35,37 (3)

The larger value of τ suggests that electrons have a longer lifetime and faster diffusion rate in nanowire films, enabling the DSCs to achieve a higher overall power conversion efficiency. As shown in Table 2, the lifetime of the electrons in the nanowire film (7.50 ms) is 43.6% longer than that in the P25 nanoparticle film (4.23 ms), and the τ value in the P25 film is consistent with the previously reported reference.35 This result can be explained by the fact that the nanowires gained a well-crystallized and high-quantity single crystal structure with less diffusive hindrance.
Under illumination, VOC can be expressed as:38 (4)where n0 is the concentration of accessible electronic states in the conduction band of TiO2. k1 and k2 are the kinetic constants of back reaction of injected electrons with triiodide and recombination of these electrons with oxidized dye, respectively.
A significant increase in the electron lifetime reveals the effective retardation of the charge recombination reaction between photo-injected electrons with I3− or the oxidized dye molecules during the electron transport through the nanowire film, leading to an increase of the open-circuit photovoltage, fill factor and thus efficiency of DSCs based on nanowire, as compared to DSCs based on P25 nanoparticles.
So far, anatase TiO2 nanostructures with a high aspect ratio such as hierarchical TiO2 structures containing nanowires and nanobelts,39 ellipsoidal TiO2 nanoparticles,40 and TiO2 nanorods41 have been synthesized by three-step alkaline hydrothermal procedure, heat-treatment of peroxotitanate complex aqueous solution, and surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method, respectively. Remarkable photoconversion efficiencies of 5.53%, 6.9%, and 7.06/7.29% have been achieved by the above reported DSCs made of hierarchical TiO2 structures, ellipsoidal TiO2 nanoparticles, and TiO2 nanorods (one layer/double layer), respectively. We noted that higher efficiencies of such long-shaped nanostructure electrodes ascribed their success to the rapid electron transport instead of BET surface area, as compared with P25 nanoparticle electrodes. The small surface area is due to the large diameter of long-shaped nanostructures. For example, the reported diameters of nanowires in hierarchical TiO2 structures, ellipsoidal TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 nanorods, and nanowires in our studies are in the order of 50–100 nm, 30–40 nm, 20–30 nm, and 18–25 nm, respectively. Therefore, the performance of such DSCs based on one dimensional structures are expected to be further improved by decreasing the diameter of long-shaped structures to a small size.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile one-step ammonia hydrothermal route to grow single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires in the absence of exotic reagents or templates. The growth parameters such as the growth time, hydrothermal reaction temperature, and ammonia concentration have been selectively chosen to synthesize single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires. Due to the well-crystallized and high-quantity single crystal structure, the single crystal TiO2 nanowires can enhance electron lifetime, thereby increasing the power conversion efficiency compared to P25 nanoparticles. An overall energy conversion efficiency of 7.10% was achieved by using nanowires as a photoanode in DSCs, showing a 27.50% improvement which is higher than that derived from P25 nanoparticles of similar film thickness (5.57%). We believe that the single crystal TiO2 anatase nanowires are also expected to provide substantial opportunities for other applications such as photocatalysis, luminescent sensors, and photoelectrical devices.
