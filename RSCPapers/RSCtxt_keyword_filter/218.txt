1. Introduction
Hybrid halide perovskites, as a new class of solar absorber materials, have recently demonstrated excellent performances in optoelectronic fields.1–5 However, studies on their synthesis and basic properties have long been reported.6–10 Since the discovery that halide perovskite materials can be used as solar absorbers, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has been increased from 3.8% (ref. 11) to 22.1% (ref. 12) in the past six years. The high performance of halide perovskite solar cells has been attributed to their low non-radiative recombination, wide optical absorption range, high carrier mobility and low trap density. Apart from the rapid progress of perovskite thin film solar cells, considerable research interest has also been focused on bulk and low-dimensionally specific morphological single crystals for the study of their applications and intrinsic properties such as photoluminescence, ferroelectricity, thermoelectricity and photo-response.
In this highlight, we will provide guidance for the frontier research fields focused on perovskite single crystals, concentrating mainly on their crystal structure and crystal growth. We will begin with a historical investigation of hybrid perovskite materials, followed by the introduction of crystal structure and different methods for the crystal growth of hybrid perovskites. Finally, we will summarize the highlight with perspectives and an outlook on the progress of single crystal perovskite materials.
The synthesis and crystal growth of organo-metal halide perovskites were first reported by Weber about 40 years ago.13,14 Crystalline organo-metal halide perovskite thin films with outstanding optoelectronic performances were first fabricated with a one step technique by Mitzi and co-workers.15–19 The first report using MAPbX3 (X = Br, I) as light absorbers in solar cells with a PCE efficiency of 3.8% was reported by Miyasaka et al.11 in 2009. Later, organometal halide perovskite thin films formed via a one or two-step technique were developed. The metal halides were first deposited onto a fabricated glass or quartz wafer using vacuum deposition or the spin-coating method; the wafer was then dipped into an organic ammonium iodide solution for a short time at room temperature.20 With further advancement of organometal halide perovskites, solution processing methods have played an important role in preparation and crystal growth.21,22 In 2013, the synthesis and properties of the MAPbI3 series of polycrystalline perovskite materials were first reported by Kanatzidis’ group25 and Baikie’s group,26 followed by the centimetre-scale single crystal successfully obtained by our group.27 And thereafter, the crystal growths of MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) and their analogues were performed using different methods by some research groups.28–36,41–44
2. Crystal structure
Organic–inorganic perovskite materials exhibit peculiar varieties of elemental composition, crystal structure and performance. Organic–inorganic perovskites include the three-dimensional (3-D) network of BX6, with an octahedral structure, where a disordered A cation fits into the enclosed octahedral void as shown in Fig. 1a. The crystal structure stability of ABX3 perovskites can be confirmed with the tolerance factor (t). The tolerance factor (t) was calculated using eqn (1), where rA, rB and rX represent the corresponding ionic radii. In the organic–inorganic ABX3 crystal structure, the A-sites usually represented the organic groups, for example, CH3NH3+ or NH2CHNH2+, etc. The cation B is typically Pb2+ or Sn2+, while the anion X is a halide ion (Cl−, Br− or I−). Furthermore, the cation B is easily connected with anion X to form the {BX6} octahedral ionic group. (1)

From Table 1, we can conclude that the ideal cubic perovskite crystal structure is formed when the tolerance factor (t) value is from 0.9 to 1.0. However, with the t value range of 0.7 to 0.9 attributed to structures with smaller A or larger B, the tetragonal, orthorhombic or rhombohedral crystal structures are easily formed. When the t value is larger than 1.0, induced by a larger A, there exist various layered crystal structures. The related parameters of hybrid perovskites with Pb and Sn elements are listed in Fig. 1b. Generally speaking, there are t values from 0.7 to 1.0 for halide perovskites (X = Cl, Br, I). The effect of the tolerance factor (t) on the crystal structure provides guidance for investigating some novel and peculiar properties of halide perovskite materials.

3. Crystal growth
3.1 Temperature-lowering method
The temperature-lowering method is suitable for the crystal growth of these materials; the solubility of the organo-halide perovskites in the corresponding acid halide solvents is moderate at room temperature but changes considerably with temperature. High quality large single crystals can be obtained by dipping the preferred seed into the solvent, and crystal growth will take place on the seed by lowering the temperature accurately. The decrease in the solution temperature induces saturation of the solute, and the saturated aqueous perovskite precursor HX (X = Cl, Br, I) solution containing an inorganic metal salt and an organic halide salt forms halide perovskite crystals slowly and centimetre size crystals, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and 3, can be obtained. Moreover, according to the different fixed position of the seed crystals, bottom seeded solution growth (BSSG) and top seeded solution growth (TSSG) methods have often been used. The advantages of the above methods are that the crystal growths are both easily controlled and kept stable, in which case high quality large size single crystals can be obtained.

3.1.1 Bottom seeded solution growth (BSSG) method. 
Centimetre-scale MAPbI3 bulk single crystals were first grown with the bottom seeded solution growth (BSSG) method by our group.27 Seed crystals were obtained by spontaneous crystallization. The crystal growth conditions were optimized through accurate control of the temperature and the selection of a high quality seed crystal. The seeded crystal was fixed to the middle of the designed tray as shown in Fig. 2a. In the crystal growth process, the tray with the seed crystal was rotated by the electric motor, and the saturated solution was slowly cooled down from 65 °C to 40 °C. The MAPbI3 single crystal with dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm × 8 mm exhibited the two natural facets {100} and {112}. And thereafter, Lian et al.28 also utilized a seed crystal fixed to a platinum wire to obtain bulk single crystals with the size of 12 mm × 12 mm × 7 mm via the same method after lowering the temperature of the growth solution from 100 °C to 57 °C, as shown in Fig. 2b.


3.1.2 Top seeded solution growth (TSSG) method. 
However, bulk MAPbI3 single crystals were gained using the top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method by Dong et al.29 The schematic illustration of crystal growth is depicted in Fig. 3a. In the growth of the crystal, the seed crystal was fixed to a silicon substrate in the top of the solution. Bulk MAPbI3 single crystals with the size of 10 mm (length) and 3.3 mm (height), as shown in Fig. 3b, were gained via the dissolution of small seed crystals in the bottom due to the temperature discrepancy between the bottom and top of the solution that induced super-saturation.
Recently, bulk high quality hybrid tin iodide perovskite single crystals have been grown via the top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method by our group for the first time.30Fig. 4a depicts the schematic illustrations of the TSSG growth of bulk ASnI3 (A = CH3NH3 or CH(NH2)2) single crystals, compared with our BSSG method for the MAPbI3 single crystal. Bulk CH3NH3SnI3 and CH(NH2)2SnI3 single crystals were grown using the TSSG method from 60 °C or 65 °C, respectively, to room temperature based on their solubility curves as shown in Fig. 4b.

In conclusion, the temperature-lowering method is simple, convenient and applicable for the growth of high quality large size single crystal perovskites such as MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). However, it is not suitable for low solubility materials at high temperatures.

3.2 Inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) methods
Compared with the temperature-lowering method, the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method is suitable for those materials whose solubility in particular solvents is high at room temperature but decreases with increasing temperature. The Bakr group,31–34 Liu group35 and Yang group36 investigated the solubility of hybrid lead halide perovskites in γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). Interesting phenomena of the crystallization of hybrid lead halide perovskites with the increase of solution temperature were observed. This process was described as inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) as shown in Fig. 5a. By employing the ITC method, millimeter-sized MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) single crystals were obtained via the different organic solvents as shown in Fig. 5b and c. As shown in Fig. 5c, the solubility of MAPbCl3 in the DMF–DMSO (volume ratio = 1:1) mixed solution was lower with the increase of solution temperature. Similarly, millimetre-size FAPbX3 (X = Br, I) single crystals were gained using the same ITC method.

However, in the ITC method, organic solvents such as DMF and DMSO, were usually connected with lead(II) halides or tin(II) halides to form intermediate adducts as reported by Kanatzidis et al.37,38 and Yao et al.39 The real hybrid perovskite single crystals were obtained by annealing to remove the organic solvent, as shown in Fig. 6a. For example, the detailed transformations of the MAPbI3 perovskite with CH3NH3I and PbI2 in DMF, in which the CH3NH3PbI3·DMF adduct phase is formed, are depicted in Fig. 6b. As shown in Fig. 6c, the crystal structure of CH3NH3PbI3·DMF implied a relationship between the 2D layers of neat PbI2 and the 1D PbI3 fragments, exhibiting a strong DMF–CH3NH3 interaction. Fig. 6e depicts the formation process of MAPbI3 in DMSO. However, in the DMSO solvent, although the (CH3NH3)2Pb3I8·2DMSO phase was formed via the DMSO–PbI2 interaction, the MAPbI3 single crystal was gained by removing the DMSO solvent, as shown in Fig. 6d.

3.3 Anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) and layered solution growth methods
The anti-solvent vapor diffusion method is used to grow the materials that are highly soluble in a good solvent but have poor solubility in other solvents. By the anti-solvent vapour-assisted crystallization method, millimetre-scale MAPbX3 single crystals were obtained by the Bakr group.41Fig. 7a shows the schematic illustration of the synthesis, in which the proper anti-solvent dichloromethane (DCM) was slowly diffused into the solution containing MAX and PbX2 (X = Br, I) dissolved in DMF or GBA, resulting in the growth of millimetre-scale MAPbBr3 crystals as shown in Fig. 7b.

(b) Photograph, UV-vis and emission spectra of the MAPbBr3 single crystals obtained within one week. Reprinted from ref. 41 with permission. Copyright 2015, Science. (c) Schematic illustration of the layered solution growth method of (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbCl4 plate single crystals. Reprinted from ref. 42 with permission. Copyright 1999, Elsevier. 
However, the layered solution growth method is suitable due to the different solubility of the crystallizing material in these two layers of different solvents. (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbCl4 plate single crystals grown by the layered solution method, similar to the AVC method, were reported by Mitzi et al.42Fig. 7c demonstrates that the precursor PbCl2 in H2O/HCl solution (7.5 ml, 1.19 g ml−1) was first placed into a tube and methanol (15 ml, 0.79 g ml−1) was added dropwise. And then, on top of the column, a stoichiometric amount of C6H5C2H4NH2 solution (0.25 ml) was slowly dropped with a syringe. The (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbCl4 plate single crystals (dimensions > 4 mm) were grown after several weeks. High quality small single crystals were easily obtained using these methods.
The anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization and layered solution growth methods for preparing hybrid halide perovskites are highly efficient and applicable. But it is difficult to obtain large-size single crystals, which inhibits optoelectronic applications. Therefore, developing more efficient and controllable methods for fabricating high quality perovskite single crystals of MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) is urgent.
3.4 Slow evaporation method
As we know, the slow evaporation method is the simple and traditional method for obtaining single crystals in solution growth processes, and most organic crystals used for single crystal structure analysis are also grown by this method. Xiong et al. have investigated the crystal growth, crystal structures and properties of hybrid perovskite analogue (benzylammonium)2PbX4 (X = Cl, Br) materials.43Fig. 8a displays the schematic illustration of crystal growth at a specific temperature. (Benzylammonium)2PbCl4 single crystals were synthesised via the stoichiometric mixture of benzylammonium chloride and PbCl2 in a concentrated HCl aqueous solution. However, bulk crystals with the dimensions of 5 × 10 × 2 mm3 were obtained via the slow evaporation of the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution at 90 °C. (Benzylammonium)2PbCl4 plate single crystals are elongated along the [001] direction, the largest facet of which is the [100] facet, which was verified by the XRD pattern. The simulated morphology of (benzylammonium)2PbCl4 was also consistent with the experimental results of the single crystal shown in Fig. 8b. Although it is highly efficient and applicable, sometimes this method is hard to accurately control, which limits its application.

3.5 Droplet-pinned crystallization (DPC) method
Micro-scale MAPbI3 single crystalline arrays formed using the droplet-pinned crystallization (DPC) method have been reported by Ye et al.44Fig. 9 demonstrates that a MAPbI3 precursor solution was first dropped on ITO glass modified with PEDOT:PSS, on which a smaller piece of wafer was placed. With the evaporation of solvent, the MAPbI3 was dispersed along the receding direction of the droplet. On annealing, rectangular CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal arrays were formed within minutes. This method is suitable for the growth of micro-scale single crystals with a conventional and efficient preparation process, which also provided the possibility to grow single crystalline thin films.

A MAPbI3 solution is first dropped onto PEDOT:PSS-modified ITO glass with a smaller piece of wafer to pin the droplet. As the solvent evaporates, precursors crystallize along the receding direction of the droplet. After the annealing process, rectangular CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal arrays form.

3.6 Combined solution process and vapor-phase conversion method
2D MAPbI3 perovskite nanosheets were prepared via a two-step process by Liu et al.45 as shown in Fig. 10a. The method involved spin casting with a saturated PbI2 aqueous solution onto a SiO2 substrate, followed by heating the SiO2 substrate to form 2D PbI2 nanosheets at an elevated temperature, subsequently, the 2D MAPbI3 perovskite nanosheets were formed via the filling of the void of the PbI6 octahedral structure with MAI molecules. The AFM topography images and thickness of the 2D MAPbI3 perovskite nanosheets with different layer numbers are demonstrated in Fig. 10b. The surface topography of the 2D MAPbI3 nanosheets became relatively rough compared to that of the PbI2 nanosheets, due to the adsorption of MAI molecules on the surfaces, which indicated a surface roughness of 0.2–1.0 nm. The sheets exhibited perovskite thicknesses of 1.3, 2.5, 5.0, and 13 nm, corresponding to 1, 2, 4, and 10 unit cells, respectively. This approach may be easily controlled to provide guidance towards a MAPbI3 single crystalline thin film.

3.7 Bridgman growth method
The melt crystal growth methods, especially the Bridgman growth method, are most frequently used for growing large crystals inside sealed ampoules.46,47 Considering the high vapour pressure and chemical instability of organic compounds around their melting temperatures, the melt growth approach may be explored only for organic–inorganic compounds with a definite melting point. In the process shown in Fig. 11a, the quartz ampoule was filled with all of the raw reactants, and was then sealed under vacuum, and moved down through the temperature gradient. At a definite temperature, spontaneous nucleation was induced at the tip of the ampoule, and the crystallization front propagates through the molten material. The Bridgman growths of CsSnI3 polycrystalline ingots and CsPbBr3 single crystals were prepared by the Kanatzidis group.48,49 Bulk CsSnI3 polycrystalline ingots are depicted in Fig. 11b. The thermoelectric power measurements of CsSnI3 exhibited positive Seebeck coefficients within the entire temperature range with almost a linear dependence on temperature, indicating a p-type semiconductor (Fig. 11c). This behaviour makes CsSnI3 a promising candidate for thermoelectric application. In order to characterize the fundamental photoconductivity properties of CsPbBr3 materials, high quality CsPbBr3 single crystals were also grown via the same method as shown in Fig. 11d. The optical absorption of CsPbBr3 was important as a detector material. The absorption spectra of a polished CsPbBr3 single crystal in transmission mode indicated that the band gap of CsPbBr3 was 2.25 eV at room temperature. Besides, the CsPbBr3 single crystal exhibited a green photoluminescence (PL) emission at 46 K.

Therefore, the Bridgman growth method can obtain large crystals, only limited by the size of the ampoules used for crystallization, but the surfaces between the crystal and the ampoule can induce stress, cracks, or small grain boundaries on the crystals. This method should pave the way for hybrid perovskite materials with a definite melting point, such as MASnX3 (X = Cl, Br and I).50
The Bridgman growth technique can be easily implemented and its interface curvature can also be readily adjusted by changing the temperatures of the crucible at the top and bottom. However, the grown crystal is in contact with the crucible wall, which easily causes mechanical stresses and increases the impurity level and defect density, and further inhibits the application of these crystals.51
3.8 Floating-zone (FZ) method
The floating-zone method was applied to growing crystals with congruent or incongruent melting. But different from the Bridgman growth method, the floating-zone method (Fig. 12) was equipped with a series of short heating sources with elliptical mirrors. Moreover, the shape of the interface is dependent on the position of the M-L system, which avoided contact with the ellipsoidal mirrors shown in Fig. 12. Growing a feed rod in both the no tilt and the tilted conditions at the different M-L positions was also attempted. In the narrow molten zones, impurities were melted and purer grown single crystals accumulated outside the molten zone. This is very crucial in maintaining a relatively stable molten zone. A contact interface between the feed rod and the grown crystal, and the heat distribution in the molten zone lead to the instability of the molten zone during the crystal growth, although the molten zone may be expertly operated.52,53 The floating-zone method is usually used for the formation of inorganic single crystal materials,53 and the purification of some organic materials, such as anthracene, naphthalene and their derivatives.47,54

The floating-zone technique was possessed with the advantages of no crucible, no pollution and rapid growth, which exhibited the superiority in some single crystals difficult to grow by Czochralski method.55 However, disordered growth striations and colour inhomogeneity existed in the grown crystals. Until now, there have been no reports about the synthesis and crystal growth of hybrid perovskite materials using this method. Therefore, the floating-zone method may provide the new way for the crystal growth of some hybrid perovskite materials.
4. Conclusions and outlook
Single crystals are very important for the evaluation of the intrinsic properties of hybrid halide perovskites. Different methods have been adopted for the growth of hybrid perovskite crystals in either liquid state reactions or solid state reactions.
However, few studies have focused on investigating the crystal quality of hybrid perovskite materials. The interdependence between the purity, defect and trap density, and grain boundaries in these hybrid perovskite materials is not so clear and these factors affect their charge transport and optoelectronic properties. For example, the mobility of MAPbI3 measured in polycrystalline thin films may be lower than the mobility calculated theoretically. The MAPbI3 undergoes a structural phase transition between the single-crystal growth temperature and room temperature, where the mobility measurements are conducted. However, the intrinsic mobility of MAPbI3 is still unknown and current mobility measurements, such as time of flight (TOF), space charge limited current (SCLC) and Hall-effect measurements are limited and struggle to clarify the problems caused by defects and impurities. Besides, many problems exist relating to the intrinsic properties of the hybrid perovskite materials, such as the carrier diffusion length, ferroelectric hysteresis, and so on. Therefore, studies on the crystal growth and defects of these materials should attract more attention in order to deepen the understanding of the intrinsic properties and device physics of these materials. High quality single crystals will not only pave the way to understand the intrinsic properties of these perovskite materials, but devices based on single crystals with different dimensions will also be an attractive research area.
