    , Accepted 26th April 2013First published on 26th April 2013AbstractWe demonstrate the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to create unique thin (12–36 nm) and conformal TiO2 interlayers on indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, for use as electron collection contacts in inverted bulk heterojunction P3HT/PC61BM organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Optimized CVD formation of these oxide films is inherently scalable to large areas, and may be a viable non-contact alternative to electron-selective interlayer formation. Oxide-based electron-selective interlayers, such as TiO2, need to be thin, conformal and sufficiently electronically conducting films without sacrificing electron harvesting selectivity. Using volatile titanium-tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) precursors in a flowing N2 gas stream, the CVD process provides nanometer control of film thickness to produce 12–36 nm thickness device-quality films. The best performing CVD films, processed at substrate temperatures of ca. 210 °C, characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were found to be amorphous but stoichiometric TiO2. Solution electrochemistries (voltammetry) of probe molecules were shown to be easily accessible indicators of film porosity and are predictive for electron harvesting selectivity (and hole-blocking) in an inverted configuration OPV platform. Small molecules whose redox potentials placed them energetically above the conduction band edge energy (ECB) were reduced/oxidized at nearly the same rates as for bare ITO. Probe molecules whose redox potentials place them energetically within the band gap region, below ECB, show almost complete blocking of their oxidation/reduction processes, for optimized conformal (and nonporous) TiO2 films. In addition, background oxidation current densities for solution probe molecules correlate inversely with the shunt resistance (RP) measured in OPVs. OPVs with the configuration: ITO/CVD-TiO2/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag, using TiO2 films of 12, 24 and 36 nm, were evaluated for short-circuit photocurrent (JSC), open-circuit photopotential (VOC), and fill-factor (FF), versus bare ITO. OPVs using amorphous, conformal 24 nm TiO2 interlayers showed the highest fill factors, lowest RS, highest RP and power conversion efficiencies of ca. 3.7%.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OPVs), especially those with inverted configurations, continue to advance in efficiency and lifetime, and are envisioned for applications requiring low-cost, area-scalable and easily processed energy conversion platforms.1–12 Normal bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs typically use a conducting polymer hole-collection interlayer over a transparent conductive oxide such as indium-tin oxide (ITO), followed by the active layer, an electron-collection interlayer and a reactive metal top contact (e.g. Al). Both the conducting polymer hole-collection interlayer and the top metal contact have been shown to contribute to problems in device stability.13–15 Inverted OPV configurations require an easily processed electron-selective interlayer (ETL) over the transparent contact, which is often more stable in contact with OPV active layers, and provides for the use of a less reactive metal top contact (e.g. Ag).2,4–7
Metal oxides such as ZnO and TiO2 are typically used as electron-selective interlayers (ETL) since their conduction band energies are positioned to harvest electrons from many of the electron acceptor components of the OPV, such as fullerenes and perylenebisimides, while the valence band energies of these oxides, if stoichiometric and free of mid-gap states, are large enough to prevent hole-harvesting and limit surface recombination at the contact.16–22 The development of even more efficient and stable OPVs would be facilitated by the availability of ETLs that are conformal, with nanometer scale control over film thickness in the range 10–200 nm, and good overall electrical conductivities, without the need for excessive doping, which may increase the concentration of surface states and recombination centers.4,7,16,18–20,23–26
ZnO is one of the most widely used electron selective interlayers, and is easily processed as thin films using spin-casting and annealing of sol–gel precursors, various forms of sputter deposition, and atomic layer deposition.6,27–31 ZnO thin films typically show high electron mobilities and good electrical conductivity,32,33 and have enabled a wide range of “inverted” OPV configurations.4,6,27 The rich defect chemistry of ZnO, which is essential to impart conductivity, may provide for multiple “mid-gap” states that promote unwanted surface recombination at the contact.32 ZnO is also easily hydrolyzed, and intrusion of water vapor into the OPV over its lifespan is problematic.5,6,27,32,34 Some of these same issues may also arise in the use of thin ZnO films as interlayers, or “window layers” in other inorganic thin film photovoltaic technologies.16,34,35
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) films are more hydrolytically stable, possess conduction and valence band edge energies (ECB and EVB) comparable to ZnO,16 and have electron mobilities high enough to act as adequate electron-collecting thin film interlayers and photoelectrochemical platforms.7,16 Because its electron mobilities are lower than for ZnO, thinner TiO2 films may be required, while retaining a pinhole-free, conformal film morphology, and an absence of defects which lead to recombination.
To produce OPV-relevant titanium oxide thin films via solution processing routes, alkoxides or halides are typically mixed with an alcohol to form a colloidal solution, with organic/acid modifiers occasionally added to allow the preferential growth of certain nanostructures.36–39 Films are typically formed by spin-casting, dip-coating, or spray pyrolysis, accompanied by ambient hydrolysis to form a TiOx film and annealing in air to evaporate the remaining solvent, driving the oxide toward stoichiometry and to improve film crystallinity.40 TiO2 films are also amenable to deposition via sputtering which also provides for tailoring of composition and electrical properties.21,22,41,42 As discussed further below, regardless of deposition approach, control of thickness in these oxide films is critical.43,44
The fabrication of metal oxide films via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a mature technology.45,46 CVD can create uniform thickness oxide films with high chemical purity and, if deposited at optimum rates and temperatures, these films can be conformal with an electrode substrate,47 which is important to prevent the formation of pinholes and resistive grain boundaries.48 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has also been used with success to create TiO2 interlayer films for OPVs.49–51 Both ALD and CVD approaches ultimately provide for precise control of doping and laminate formation in oxide interlayers.52
We present here a straightforward CVD approach to TiO2 film formation on research-scale ITO substrates using TTIP in a flowing N2 stream as the oxide precursor, to produce extremely conformal 12–36 nm oxide films with good electrical properties in OPV platforms. We have also explored the addition of low fluence 254 nm UV exposure of the flowing stream just prior to oxide formation on a heated ITO substrate (UV-CVD – as shown schematically in Fig. S1 – ESI†). CVD processes with or without the UV activation process produced amorphous films at substrate temperatures of 20 °C, 70 °C, 140 °C, 210 °C, and crystalline anatase films at 240 °C or higher. OPV-relevant CVD Films formed at 210 °C exhibit the best film uniformity, providing for excellent control of thickness and morphology. The composition, structure and energetics (band edge energies) of TiO2 films ranging from 12 to 36 nm were characterized in detail, and we found the best performing films to be amorphous, stoichiometric and with slightly altered residual carbon content and valence band features for films grown with UV-activation of the gas stream. Electrochemical studies using various probe molecules showed that optimized TiO2 interlayers can support reduction of molecules whose formal potentials place them energetically above the conduction band edge, while those redox processes occurring at potentials which place them in the band gap region, are effectively blocked. These TiO2 interlayer films were evaluated as ETLs in inverted BHJ-OPV (P3HT:PC61BM) devices, and shown to provide OPV performance rivalling previous sol–gel derived ZnO and TiO2 interlayers. To our knowledge this report is the first example of the use of CVD TiO2 as an electron-selective interlayer in OPVs, however thin TiO2 films have seen significant use in photoelectrochemical energy conversion platforms, sometimes in combination with another electron-selective oxide layer.48,53,54
2 Experimental
2.1 CVD TiO2 deposition
The CVD system is shown schematically in ESI, Fig. S1,† consisting of a reservoir for the TTIP solution, a bubbling tower and gas introduction system which permitted control over TTIP flow rate, followed by a tube furnace to control gas temperature and a substrate stage with independent temperature control. Titanium-tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) used as the TiO2 film precursor was loaded into the glass reservoir in a N2 filled glovebox. The substrates (ITO, Au, quartz) were treated with 10.5 watts O2 plasma at ca. 400 mtorr for 10 minutes (Harrick plasma, Model PDC-32G) before each deposition. After mounting the substrate and the sealed precursor reservoir, the CVD system was immediately pumped down to ca. 700 mtorr. For each deposition, the furnace temperature was set to 180 °C (to prevent TTIP condensation), and substrate temperature to 20 °C, 70 °C, 140 °C, 210 °C, or 240 °C. Two 4 watt UV lamps (Philips, Model TUV/4W/T5/2P/G4T5) were positioned outside the quartz tube just downstream from the tube furnace to illuminate the vapor feed stream, 5 cm away from the substrate. The N2 carrier gas flow rate was set at 0.67 sccm using a mass flow control (Dakota Instruments, Model 6AGC1AL4-01NC). After deposition, the TiO2 samples were cooled down to ca. 80 °C in vacuum and were then transferred into a N2 filled glovebox prior to characterization and/or OPV device preparation.
2.2 Film characterization
The images of CVD TiO2 grown on ITO, and cross-sections of ITO/CVD TiO2/P3HT:PC61BM were obtained with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM – Hitachi, Model 4800). Cross-sectioned samples were coated with a few nm of sputtered Pt to prevent charging during the analysis.
The topography and current mapping images were carried out by conducting tip atomic force microscopy (C-AFM – Agilent 5500, contact mode) using boron-doped diamond tips (Nanoworld, NW-CDT-FMR) with an applied bias of 0.2 V (bare ITO), and 1.2 V (CVD TiO2/ITO), where samples were grounded and the tip potential varied. As discussed further below, the absolute value of the current observed in these TiO2/ITO samples was occasionally shifted positively in the region from −2 to 2 volts in single point J–V measurements, and we normalized the baseline currents in order to compare electrical activity from one sample to another.
Cyclic voltammetry of probe molecules in acetonitrile was carried out with an EG&G Model 283 potentiostat, using a three port electrochemical cell with platinum counter electrode, Ag/AgNO3 nonaqueous reference electrode, and CVD TiO2/ITO or bare ITO working electrodes. Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) dichloride, Ru(bipy)3Cl2 (99.95%, Aldrich), and bis-biphenyl-triarylamine, TPD (99%, Aldrich), our two primary probe molecules, were recrystallized before use. Ferrocene (Fc) (>98%, Fluka) was used without purification. For each probe molecule 0.1 mM solutions were prepared in degassed anhydrous acetonitrile (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (98%, Aldrich) supporting electrolyte. The scan rate was 0.1 V s−1 with voltage sweep range 0 V → 1.5 V → 0 V → −2.3 V → 0 V for Ru(bipy)3Cl2; −0.4 V → 0.6 V → −0.4 V for Fc; −0.2 V → 1.2 V → −0.2 V for TPD.
XPS/UPS measurements of CVD TiO2 films were conducted in a Kratos Axis-Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα excitation at 1486.6 eV (XPS) and He(I) excitation at 21.2 eV (UPS). For XPS, the relative atomic composition of each element was determined by the component area divided by the total area and by each element sensitivity factor, i.e. 2.001 for Ti, 0.78 for O, and 0.278 for C. For the UPS measurement a −10.00 V bias was applied to the sample to enhance the collection of low kinetic energy electrons.55–57 For UPS studies it was apparent that the TiO2/ITO film reached electronic equilibrium with the spectrometer, for XPS studies we found the peak position for adventitious, reduced carbon, to be at ca. 285.1 eV, suggesting that no appreciable charging was present in these thin films.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of each thin film was obtained on a Philips X'PERT MPD diffractometer using a Cu Kα (0.154 nm) light source. The diffractometer was set at 0.02° with counting time of 10 seconds per point, with the diffraction angle range (2θ) scanned between 20 and 100°. TiO2 anatase nanopowder (<25 nm, 99.7%, Aldrich) was used as a standard for comparison.
Transmittance and reflectance optical measurements (200–1000 nm) were carried out using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Cary, Model 5000) using 36 nm CVD TiO2 films on quartz. The spectrometer was set at 1 nm interval with 100 ms integration time.
2.3 Device fabrication
ITO substrates (ca. 15 Ω sq−1, Colorado Concept Coating, LLC) were cleaned with micro-fiber cloth using Triton-X 100 detergent, and sonicated in Triton-X 100 detergent, nanopure water, and pure ethanol, sequentially. Cleaned ITO substrates were kept in pure ethanol for storage. ITO substrates were dried under a N2 stream before use.
Bulk heterojunction OPVs were created on either bare ITO or CVD TiO2/ITO substrates, in a N2 filled glovebox, a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution composed of 1:1 wt% P3HT:PC61BM (obtained from Rieke Metals and Nano-C, respectively, 50 mg ml−1 total) was stirred at 60 °C for at least 3 hours before being used. This blend solution was spun on CVD TiO2/ITO or bare ITO at 600 rpm for 1 minute at room temperature and then the deposited samples were kept in a covered Petri dish for slow drying overnight. The blend layer was then transferred on a hot plate to anneal the layer at 110 °C for 12 minutes. 20 nm MoO3 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) interlayer and 100 nm Ag (99.99%, Kurt J. Lesker) top contacts were deposited sequentially via thermal evaporation at ca. 5 × 10−7, and 10−6 torr, respectively. A shadow mask was used during Ag deposition to confine the cell area (0.019 cm2). Six cells were used in each device platform to compare the OPV performances of CVD TiO2 interlayers of 12, 24, 36 nm film thicknesses and the average J–V curves are reported here.
2.4 Device characterization
OPV characterization used equipment and protocols previously described from this group.58 The dark and light J–V measurements were carried out using a source meter (Keithley, model 2400) and in-house software (National Instruments Labview 8.2) in a N2 filled glovebox (Mbraun Labmaster). The scan voltage was swept from −2 V to 2 V with 10 mV steps. A 300 W Xe arc lamp (Newport) was used as a light source, light was passed through a neutral density filter (Thorlabs), an AM 1.5 filter (Melles Griot), and a 40° output angle optical diffuser (Newport), subsequently before illuminating OPV devices. The illuminating light intensity at the device plane was calibrated by a flat response thermopile (Newport) and a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport – Model 818-SL with OD3 Attenuator) to achieve 100 mW cm−2.
3 Results and discussions
3.1 Film structure, composition and morphology
We first demonstrate the uniformity of device-relevant CVD-TiO2 films. Fig. 1 shows a FE-SEM cross-section of a ITO/CVD-TiO2/P3HT:PC61BM. We focus here on 24 nm TiO2 films, grown with UV-activation of the TTIP/N2 flow stream, which showed the best OPV performance (see below). The 24 nm TiO2 interlayer is conformal, uniform and continuous throughout the device, typical for our CVD TiO2 interlayers in this thickness range. This uniformity was not limited to specific areas but extended across all regions explored.
 Fig. 1  Cross-sectional FE-SEM of P3HT:PC61BM/CVD TiO2/ITO interface. The conformal 24 nm TiO2 layer is clearly seen between the OPV active layer and the ITO substrate, and this degree of uniformity was observed for all regions explored, over multiple device platforms. Yellow dashed lines have been added as a visual guide. 
X-ray diffraction data, coupled with electron microscopy and OPV performance (below) showed an interesting competition between substrate temperature and deposition rate and film quality and device performance. Films deposited at 210 °C were amorphous, conformal and stoichiometric and produced the best OPV performance (see below). We found films deposited at 20 °C tended to be less uniform (only physisorption of material observed). For films deposited at 70 °C and 140 °C the deposition rates were much lower than seen for higher temperatures (210 °C, 240 °C). Films deposited at ca. 240 °C were crystalline anatase (Fig. 2(a)) but also tended to be less uniform. TiO2 films deposited at 20 °C, 70 °C, 140 °C, and 210 °C showed no clear diffraction peaks, indicating that these films have crystalline features smaller than the coherence length requirement for a clear X-ray diffraction Bragg peak, i.e. are effectively amorphous. The peak width of the major Bragg peaks were used to estimate the coherence length for the diffraction peaks in the anatase films grown at 240 °C (ca. 21 nm), using the Scherrer relationship.59 For OPV studies we therefore focused on films deposited at 210 °C for further characterization.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD diffraction for a CVD TiO2 film, created with a substrate temperature of 240 °C on Au and an anatase TiO2 powder standard. Top view FE-SEM images of (b) bare ITO and (c) 12 nm CVD TiO2/ITO deposited at 210 °C the sub-grain structure for the ITO substrate is clearly seen in both images. Comparable images were obtainable with up to 36 nm TiO2 films (not shown). 

Fig. 2(b) and (c) show representative FE-SEM top view images of bare ITO and ITO coated with a CVD TiO2 thin film (12 nm) created at a substrate temperature of 210 °C. For bare ITO the sub-grain structure is sharp and clearly defined. After TiO2 deposition, the sub-grain structure is still clear, suggesting that these TiO2 films are conformal. Similar images were obtained for all 210 °C TiO2 films up to the highest thicknesses explored (36 nm).
Ti 2p, O 1s, and C 1s XPS data are shown in ESI, Fig. S2,† and the relative atomic ratios are summarized in Table S1† for TiO2 films grown at 210 °C with and without UV illumination (UV-on and UV-off respectively). The O/Ti ratios, Ti 2p3/2 and lattice O 1s binding energies differences (O 1s − Ti 2p3/2 = 71.5 eV) are consistent with the formation of stoichiometric TiO2.60 For thin films created at lower substrate temperature (i.e. 140 °C), or in the absence of UV-activation of the CVD vapor, we found stoichiometric TiO2 to be formed, but with a slightly higher carbon content entrapped within the oxide film. UV activation during deposition led to slightly lower C/Ti ratios versus films grown without UV-activation of the vapor phase components. We conclude that in both cases some of the observable carbon arises from sol–gel precursors trapped in the oxide film, not removed by the annealing occurring during growth, and some of the observable carbon likely arises from products of the UV activation process. Unless specifically mentioned we used the UV-activation process for subsequent experiments.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and conducting tip-AFM were used to compare topographic structure in these films, and the heterogeneity of their electrical properties. Fig. 3(a) and (c) show AFM and C-AFM data for an ITO electrode coated with 24 nm of CVD deposited TiO2 film. AFM and C-AFM data of a bare ITO electrode control are shown in ESI, Fig. S3,† for comparison. In Fig. 3(a), the ITO sub-grain structure is still clearly resolved, even with the TiO2 film grown over the surface. The rms surface roughness for the ITO substrates is ca. 2.3 nm, and this surface roughness is essentially unchanged when coated with 24 nm CVD TiO2 films. For TiO2 and ZnO films deposited by dip coating or spin casting from sol–gel solutions, we and others have found it difficult to resolve the underlying transparent conductive layer features suggesting that those films are not as conformal, and not as smooth, as those shown here.21,36

Fig. 3(a) shows an AFM contact mode height image and Fig. 3(c) shows the C-AFM current map in the same area while Fig. 3(b) and (d) show the histogram distribution of height and current respectively, both measured at the boron-doped diamond AFM tip. In Fig. S3(b),† a bias of 0.2 V (tip–sample) is required to obtain such maps on bare ITO, upon addition of the CVD TiO2 film, this bias had to be raised to 1.2 V or higher to achieve reasonable current densities. The distribution of electrically active sites is broad and asymmetric, and ca. 20% of the sampled sites carry current densities of ca. 0.3 A cm−2 (assuming a 125 nm diameter spherical patch for the tip to collect current) whereas the median current density is ca. 0.1 A cm−2. Similar distributions of current on bare and activated ITO substrates have been seen before,35,61 and we have recently published extensive current–voltage maps for ITO electrodes in various stages of activation and modification.62 It is not clear whether the distribution obtained here is reflective of the number of conductive pathways established in the TiO2 film, or whether the film is electrically uniform and the observed distribution of electrical activity is simply reflective of the distribution of electroactivity in the underlying ITO substrate. Similar current distributions were observed for 12 and 36 nm films with the same area distribution of electroactivity.
These combined imaging studies suggest that nucleation-limited layered growth is occurring, especially at the TiO2/ITO interface, during the first phases of CVD growth. In CVD growth the interaction between vapor precursors and substrate dictates the growth mode of the film.63 Layered growth, island growth, or the mixture of the two modes is observed depending upon rate of deposition, substrate temperature and strength of interaction of the precursor with the surface.63 It is known that TTIP is activated and/or decomposed to radical products in the vapor phase with UV illumination,64–66 which appears to strengthen the initial interaction with the ITO substrate, providing important nucleation sites for further deposition. A conformal, dense, and pinhole-free TiO2 film is thus obtained at the optimal deposition temperature 210 °C, with only slight differences in deposition rate with or without UV activation. At 210 °C substrate temperature we achieve instantaneous decomposition of TTIP and conformal oxide growth.64,67 In our CVD approach, at the given carrier gas flow rate, oxide growth is apparently in a kinetically controlled growth regime, not in a precursor diffusion limited regime.
3.2 Characterization of frontier orbital energies using photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-visible absorbance

Fig. 4 shows the UPS data for CVD TiO2 films, with and without UV activation during oxide growth, on ITO substrates. High kinetic energy ionization features arise from lattice O 2p orbitals (ca. 4 eV below the Fermi level (EF)).68 In addition, the –OH 1π, and 3σ orbitals produce photoemission features at 7.6, 10.8 eV below EF.69 Surface adsorbates, e.g. H2O, CO and defect states can also influence the valence band spectrum from such an oxide.69–71 Ionization potentials (EVB) were obtained by taking the difference between the high kinetic energy (HKE) edge and the low kinetic energy (LKE) edge and subtracting that difference from the source energy (21.2 eV): EVB = 7.4 eV = 21.2 eV − (HKE − LKE). Both types of TiO2 film showed comparable EVB. Work functions for each film were estimated by computing: 21.2 − (EF − LKE), where EF is the assumed Fermi energy for the TiO2 film, which is the same as for a gold standard film, in electronic equilibrium with the photoemission spectrometer. For all TiO2 films we observed φ = ca. 3.8 eV, whether UV-activation was used or not. To further examine the difference between UPS data obtained for TiO2 films grown with and without UV activation we subtracted the UPS data for TiO2 films grown with UV activation from data taken for those without UV activation (Fig. 4e). In these difference spectra, there is evidence for increased lattice O 2p features, and the loss of surface –OH and adsorbate features consistent with the formation of an oxide layer with less adventitious impurities, especially the loss of unreacted sol–gel precursor and reaction products.69
 Fig. 4  UPS spectra of TiO2 films (a and c) with and (b and d) without UV illumination during the deposition. (a) and (b) are the low kinetics energy (LKE) edge, and (c) and (d) are the high kinetics energy (HKE) edge features of both samples. (e) is the normalized intensity change at the HKE edge, derived from (c) subtracting (d). The spectra were normalized with respect to the highest secondary electron cascade intensity in each sample. (f) A proposed CVD TiO2 energy level diagram was shown based on UPS results and on the optical band gap energy determined in Fig. S4.† Top Ag and bottom oxygen plasma treated ITO (OP-ITO) contact Fermi levels and the energy levels of the active layer components of P3HT:PC61BM OPVs and MoO3 interlayer were taken from ref. 16 and the band edge estimates therein. 
The optical band gap of our CVD TiO2 films was estimated from transmittance data for these thin films deposited on quartz, using Tauc plots to estimate the bandgap energy,40 as shown in Fig. S4.† (The optical transmission spectra of CVD TiO2 films deposited on ITO electrodes is also shown in Fig. S5†). The band gap energy was found to be 3.7 eV which provides an upper limit estimate for the band edge energy of this material relative to the underlying ITO and upper P3HT:PC61BM blends, as shown in Fig. 4(f). In this same figure we also show estimates of the band edge energies for the active layer components of the P3HT/PC61BM OPV, the ITO contact after oxygen plasma activation, and the MoO3 hole-extraction interlayer used between the OPV active layer and the Ag top contact.16,72 These optical gaps are ca. 0.2 to 0.3 eV higher than have been reported for other TiO2 interlayer films.6,7,16
3.3 Electrochemical characterization of charge carrier selectivity of CVD TiO2 films
We evaluated the ability of these CVD TiO2 films to selectively pass electrons (through states in the conduction band), and to reject hole carriers, using electrochemical reactions (voltammetry) of solution probe molecules (Fig. 5). As was shown by early work of Bard and coworkers, metal oxide semiconductor electrodes can reduce/oxidize a probe molecule, such as Ru(bipy)32+, provided that the reduction potential for the solution probe lies negative (electrochemical scale) of the conduction band edge.73,74 As shown in Fig. 5(a), the three successive one-electron reduction reactions for Ru(bipy)32+, on TiO2/ITO electrodes (12, 24 and 36 nm of TiO2), occur at nearly the same potentials as seen for bare ITO, with somewhat reduced current densities, but with comparable rates of electron transfer as revealed by peak potential separation.75 In Fig. 5(b), on bare ITO, we clearly see the one-electron oxidation process for Ru(bipy)32+, with current densities significantly diminished on 12 nm TiO2/ITO electrode, and at or below detection limits for 24 and 36 nm TiO2 films. It was also of interest to examine the background currents in this same potential window (Fig. 5(c)) showing that currents associated with non-Faradaic events (capacitive currents) are also diminished with increasing TiO2 film thickness, indicating smaller exposed ITO area to the electrolyte solution.76 Interestingly, we found these capacitive currents showed an inverse trend with the shunt resistances (RP) of the OPV devices (see Table 1). 36 nm TiO2 film has the lowest capacitive current, but highest shunt resistance in the device current–voltage data. As discussed further below, a correlation between leakage current in OPV device and the quantity of pinhole in CVD TiO2 films can be made. Finally, in Fig. 5(d) we compare the voltammetry of two additional probe molecules, ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) and the hole-transport molecule bis-biphenyl-triarylamine, TPD, which show reversible one-electron and two-electron oxidation/reduction voltammetric events, respectively, on bare ITO, both of which are electrochemically completely blocked on our TiO2/ITO electrodes.

These electrochemical data suggest that these thin TiO2 films are minimally doped, with low densities of defects and trap states in the band gap region.77 We expect that electron-harvesting will be efficient for molecules with electron affinities low enough to place their transport LUMO levels at or above the conduction band edge of the oxide, as is expected for both C60 and PC61BM.7,16 The lack of electrochemical activity for oxidation of the probe molecules, over a wide potential range, suggest that holes generated in an OPV active layer will not be efficiently harvested, and that these interlayers are in effect “hole-blocking,” an important criterion for their use in inverted configuration OPVs.7,16
3.4 Inverted configuration OPV device performance using ITO/TiO2 electron-harvesting contacts
We evaluated CVD TiO2 interlayers of 12, 24, and 36 nm thickness in terms of inverted OPV J–V characteristics.28,29,31,78 MoO3 films were deposited from vacuum on all devices to create an ohmic contact for hole collection with the top Ag electrode.72,79,80Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the dark and light J–V curves for ITO/CVD TiO2/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag bulk heterojunction OPVs. Table 1 summarizes the device characteristics for a series of typical devices. Using bare ITO for electron collection the OPVs showed J–V behavior indicative of a non-selective electron collecting contact, with poor dark rectification, enhanced surface recombination under illumination and poor overall performance.7,16,27,81 Devices with CVD TiO2 interlayer showed that recombination processes are significantly suppressed, especially near the maximum power point, Pmax. The J–V responses using the CVD TiO2 films, regardless of the thickness showed higher FF, VOC, JSC and overall OPV performance compared to bare ITO. OPVs using 24 nm CVD TiO2 films, deposited at a substrate temperature of 210 °C showed the best overall performance, with an average JSC = 11.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.58 volts, FF = 0.58, to yield a PCE of 3.7%.
 Fig. 6  Dark (a) and illumination (b) J–V responses for ITO/CVD TiO2/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag bulk heterojunction OPVs. 
We found for CVD TiO2 film thickness of 12, 24, 36 nm, the shunt resistance increases with increasing film thickness (see Table 1).
Along with the trend that 36 nm TiO2 films show lower capacitive currents versus 12 and 24 nm films in the electrochemical studies (see Fig. 5(c)), we infer that the number of pinholes in the CVD TiO2 film dictates the leakage current arising across the OPV device. The 36 nm film suppresses the leakage current more effectively, and shows a smaller capacitive current, leading to higher shunt resistance in the OPV.
Using ZnO or TiO2 interlayers in OPVs can be accompanied by complications in the initial J–V response before extended exposure to UV light, where the rectification, FF, VOC and even JSC can be greatly improved by up to one hour of simulated AM 1.5 illumination prior to measuring the final OPV J–V.2,81,82 These changes have been ascribed to decreases in work function of the oxide interlayer, due to desorption of oxygen and other adventitious contaminants, from oxide surfaces,15 and/or changes in oxide composition which improve efficiency of electron harvesting.
Our device responses were also dependent upon light soaking of the device prior to interrogation, however, the illuminated J–V responses (Fig. 6) ceased changing after only ca. 5 minutes light soaking. Larger changes were observed in the dark J–V behavior (Fig. 7) before and after just 5 minutes of light soaking. For CVD TiO2 films, we observed very poor dark rectification (1:1) prior to light soaking and good rectification (ca. 1000× at ±1 V) and significantly lowered RS after only 5 minutes exposure to the AM 1.5 light source. We hypothesize that light soaking is responsible for changes in composition and trap density near the oxide/organic and/or ITO/oxide interfaces as well as electrical properties in bulk oxide material. Related studies focused on the surface compositional changes undergone by these oxide films during light exposure are underway and will be communicated elsewhere.

4 Conclusion
We have demonstrated a simple approach to the formation of high quality, conformal, electron-selective TiO2 interlayer films, using CVD, providing a scalable approach to the growth of interlayer films for inverted configuration organic solar cells. These first studies focused on the deposition of TiO2 films on ITO/glass substrates, a process which is enhanced by the addition of UV-activation of the volatile precursor, which appears to lower the near-surface concentration of adventitious carbon. It is interesting to note that in a narrow window of deposition rates, substrate temperature and UV exposure, we achieve a mainly amorphous film structure, which is much more uniform than films created to date by spin-casting of sol–gel ZnO or TiO2 precursors. Interestingly the optimum film thickness for these CVD grown TiO2 films (ca. 24 nm) is in the range found optimum for individual TiO2 nanoparticles collected in electron-collection electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells.54,83–86 The stoichiometric nature of our CVD films suggests a low concentration of the defects which have been indicated as recombination centers in nanoporous TiO2.83,85 We recognize, however, that our optimum deposition temperature is above the temperatures desired for film growth on plastic (e.g. PET) substrates.5,11,12,87 Oxide growth may be achievable at lower temperatures and higher deposition rates using higher fluence light sources in the process stream.64,88 Work in progress focuses on understanding changes to electrical properties by intentional introduction of dopants, which will also control the recombination processes and impact both dark and illuminated OPV responses. The CVD approach, and related atomic layer deposition of metal oxides, may provide a convenient pathway to add other refractive oxide components to the TiO2 layer, and enables the inclusion of dopants that can increase conductivity without enhancing surface recombination.

(f) A proposed CVD TiO2 energy level diagram was shown based on UPS results and on the optical band gap energy determined in Fig. S4.† Top Ag and bottom oxygen plasma treated ITO (OP-ITO) contact Fermi levels and the energy levels of the active layer components of P3HT:PC61BM OPVs and MoO3 interlayer were taken from ref. 16 and the band edge estimates therein.
