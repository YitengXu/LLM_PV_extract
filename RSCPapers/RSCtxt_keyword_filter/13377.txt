    , Accepted 21st March 2015First published on 24th March 2015AbstractA small-molecule amino-functionalized organoplatinum(II) complex Pt–N has been developed. The unique properties of Pt–N, including a well-defined chemical structure, an excellent solubility in environmentally friendly polar solvents and good electron extraction to high work-function metals, make it a promising candidate for cathode interfacial modification of solution processed multilayer polymer solar cells (PSCs). The resultant PSCs with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/interlayer/Al device configuration exhibited significantly improved efficiencies from 3.62% for an unmodified device to 8.89% by using a Pt–N cathode interlayer, benefiting from the dramatic enhancement in the open circuit voltage (0.53 V for bare Al PSCs to 0.75 V for Pt–N/Al PSCs), the fill factor (43.58% for bare Al PSC to 72.49% for Pt–N/Al PSC), and a slight increase in short-circuit current density. These results indicate that Pt–N is a new promising candidate as the cathode interlayer for highly efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in flexible, light-weight, and large-area devices through low-cost solution processing.1–6 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have rapidly increased and already reached up to 9–12% by the combined efforts from various aspects including the development of novel narrow-band gap conjugated polymers7–10 and new fullerene/non-fullerene based acceptor materials,11,12 the usage of new device processing methods,13,14 the invention of innovative device structures,15–17 the incorporation of effective interlayers,18–21 and so on.
The conventional structure, consisting of a photoactive layer between the ITO anode and the metal cathode, has been widely used to fabricate PSCs. When a bare air-stable metal was used as the cathode, the resultant PSCs usually tend to exhibit inferior performance because the high work-function (WF) of the air-stable cathodes hinders Ohmic contact with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the widely used fullerene derivative acceptors, resulting in the reduced open-circuit voltage (Voc).18–21 Low WF cathodes (such as Ba and Ca) can be used in PSCs to facilitate Ohmic contact and achieve high efficiencies at the expense of sensitivity toward moisture and oxygen.22 To circumvent these problems, it is desirable to use high WF and air-stable metals (such as Al, Ag, or Au) as the cathode because of their better environmental stability and the simplicity of their device fabrication. To achieve high performance PSCs, an efficient strategy for reducing the WF of the air-stable metals and improving the electron collection properties is required.20,23 This goal can be realized through the insertion of an interlayer between the cathode and the photoactive layer.18–21 Several classes of interlayer materials have proven effective in improving the electron extraction properties of the PSCs, including metal salts (such as LiF,24 Cs2CO3,25 CsF,26etc.), n-type metal oxide semiconductors (such as ZnO,27 TiOx,28etc.) and so on.
Alternatively, water-/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs) have attracted great attention for PSCs, largely due to their orthogonal solvent processability, and effective cathode modification properties.29–35 WSCP interlayers can simultaneously enhance the short-circuit current density (Jsc), Voc, and fill factor (FF), and thus improve the PCEs of the resultant PSCs.36 Amino-functionalized conjugated polymers (AFCPs), a typical kind of WSCP, have been extensively investigated as the interlayer materials for high performance PSCs. Besides the cathode modification properties,29,30,37–40 the AFCP interlayer can also reduce transport loss for efficient electron collection through the n-doping of fullerene derivatives at the electrode/BHJ interface, leading to a highly conductive electron transporting channel and reducing the interfacial resistance in PSCs.41–43 Combined with these advantages, single junction PSCs based on the AFCP cathode interlayer reached PCEs of more than 9.0%.18,43–45
Recently, metal-based molecules have attracted much attention due to their intriguing spectroscopic, and luminescence and electrical properties,46,47 as well as their propensity to exhibit metal–metal (M–M) interactions which provide additional means to manipulate structural ordering and electronic coupling in the organometallic compounds.48–51 By tuning the molecular structures, M–M interactions and introducing new functionalities in metal-based molecules, several groups have successfully constructed highly ordered supramolecular organometallic nanostructures (such as nanosheets, nanowires, nanobelts, nanorods, etc.),48,49 liquid crystals,51 and organometallic gels51 induced by M–M interactions. Moreover, field-effect transistors of the highly ordered organometallic nanostructures exhibited comparably high electron and hole mobilities.48,49 These kinds of metal-based molecules will open up new opportunities for efficient cathode interface materials.
Herein, we aim to improve the PSC performance through introducing a rationally designed amino-functionalized metal-based molecule interlayer with excellent cathode modification properties. The new metal-based molecule studied in this work as the cathode interlayer for PSCs is a platinum-containing derivative of the amino-functionalized molecule, Pt–N (see Scheme 1 for chemical structure). Platinum was introduced due its strong intermolecular noncovalent Pt⋯Pt supramolecular interactions which would increase the π–π stacking of the Pt–N thin film.48–50 Pt–N is designed with several important properties required for an efficient interlayer: firstly, Pt–N possesses orthogonal solvent processability, organic glass, and good film formation properties which are critical for constructing multilayer devices via all-solution processes. Secondly, the amino groups in Pt–N not only reduce the cathode WF through the formation of interfacial dipoles at the cathode interface,40 but also can n-dope the fullerene derivatives at the electrode/BHJ interface, leading to a highly conductive electron transporting channel, rendering it highly efficient in electron extraction.41–43 Thirdly, the large band gap in Pt–N may better confine the excitons in the active layer and minimize the quenching of the excitons at the cathode interface.23,52 With these desired properties, the PSCs incorporated with a Pt–N cathode interlayer exhibited a substantially improved PCE from 3.62% for an unmodified device to 8.89% under optimized conditions with a blend of [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-uorothithieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7) as the photoactive layer (see Scheme 1 for chemical structures and device configurations).53 Our results showed that Pt–N is a very promising cathode interfacial material for PSCs.

2-Bromo-9,9-bis(3′-bromopropyl)fluorene (2)54 and [2,6-bis(2-pyridyl)phenyl-C,N,N′]chloroplatinum(II) (Pt–Cl)55 were prepared according to the reported procedures. All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich, Acros, and Alfa Aesar) and used without further purification unless stated otherwise. All the solvents used were further purified prior to use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker AV-300. Chemical shifts were expressed in parts per million (ppm), and splitting patterns are designated as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). Coupling constants J are reported in Hertz (Hz). Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded in the negative ion mode with a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) using a Bruker-autoflex III smartbeam. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument (Elementar Co.). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a NETZSCH TG 209 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a N2 flow rate of 20 mL min−1. Differential scan calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a Netzsch DSC 204 under N2 flow at heating and cooling rates of 20 °C min−1. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. PL spectra were recorded on an Instaspec IV CCD spectrophotometer (Oriel Co.). The tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained by using a Nano-Scope NS3A system (Digital Instrument) to observe the surface morphologies of the cathode interlayer and the photo-active layer.

2.2 Device fabrication and characterization
Electron donor material PTB7 and electron acceptor PC71BM were purchased from 1-material and Aldrich, respectively. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P AI4083) was obtained from H.C. Starck Clevios. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN, see Scheme 1 for the chemical structure) was prepared according to the reported procedures.56 All materials were used as received. The regular device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/interlayer/Al. Firstly PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) was spin-coated atop a cleaned ITO and annealed in air at 140 °C for 10 min. Secondly, the PTB7:PC71BM active blend layer, with a nominal thickness of ∼80 nm (with a variation of ∼20 nm over the entire film), was prepared by spin-coating a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume) solution (concentration, 25 mg mL−1) at 1000 r.p.m. for 2 min. The newly developed cathode interfacial material Pt–N was dissolved in methanol and its solution (concentration, 0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated atop the photoactive layer. A 100 nm Al layer was subsequently evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (∼2 × 8 mm−2) and form a top cathode. All device fabrication processes are carried out in a N2-filled glovebox (Braun GmbH). For comparison, control devices with PFN/Al, and the bare Al cathode were also fabricated under the same conditions.
Solar cell performance was measured using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI, XES-40S1). The power of the sun simulation was calibrated before testing using a standard silicon solar cell, giving a value of 100 mW cm−2 in the test. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under a N2 atmosphere in the glove box by using a Keithley 2400 under illumination and in the dark. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured on a Hypermonolight System (Bunkoh-Keiki SM-250).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The chemical structure and the synthetic route of Pt–N are provided in Scheme 2. Compound 5, which is a key intermediate to provide terminal arylnes for the following Sonogashira reaction to Pt–N, was synthesized by a four-step procedure. Nucleophilic substitution from 2-bromofluorene (1) and excess 1,3-dibromopropane in the presence of 50 wt% NaOH/H2O yields compound 2. Coupling of 2 and trimethylsilylacetylene under typical Sonogashira conditions afforded compound 3. The trimethylsilyl groups of compound 3 were subsequently removed in a KOH–THF–MeOH solution to yield compound 4. The amination reaction of compound 4 with diethylamine in N,N-dimethylformamide under reflux conditions resulted in compound 5 with a high yield of 85%. Another key intermediate Pt–Cl was synthesized according to the previous report.54 Treatment of 9 with K2PtCl4 in HOAc under reflux conditions for 3 days afforded the cycloplatinated complex Pt–Cl. The target compound Pt–N derived from compound 5 and Pt–Cl were prepared through the Sonogashira reaction (terminal arylnes, CuI/i-Pr2NH/CH2Cl2), and the product was purified by column chromatography. The product was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS (see Fig. S1–S3, ESI†), and elemental analyses. The incorporation of the ligand into the platinum(II) center renders the product Pt–N more soluble in common organic solvents (such as THF, toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, etc.), especially relative to the precursor complex Pt–Cl, which is only soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide. Moreover, the pendent amino groups greatly enhance the solubility of Pt–N in high polarity solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide, and 20 mg of Pt–N can be readily dissolved in 1 mL of methanol at room temperature to give a clear solution. Hence, Pt–N would be a suitable candidate as the cathode interfacial material for fabricating multilayer PSCs via orthogonal solvent processing.

Reagents and conditions: (a) 1,3-dibromopropane, 50 wt% NaOH/H2O, tetrabutylammonium bromide, Ar, room temperature, 5 h; (b) (Ph3P)2PdCl2, CuI, trimethylsilylacetylene, toluene, diisopropylamine, Ar, 70 °C, 6 h; (c) KOH, THF, MeOH, H2O, Ar, room temperature, 1 h; (d) diethylamine, N,N-dimethylformamide, reflux, 12 h, Ar; (e) THF, n-butyl lithium, −78 °C, Ar, 2 h; and then tri-n-butyl tin chloride was added, room temperature, overnight; (f) (Ph3P)2PdCl2, N,N-dimethylformamide, Ar, 90 °C, 12 h; and (g) K2PtCl4, HOAc, Ar, reflux, 3 days; (h) CuI/i-Pr2NH/CH2Cl2, Ar, room temperature, 24 h. 
The thermal properties of the resultant material Pt–N were investigated by TGA and DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 1. The 5%-weight loss temperature (Td) was 327 °C, indicating the excellent thermal stability of Pt–N to resist the degradation of the material at the operating temperatures of the resultant solar cells. The DSC study results reveal a distinct glass transition at 73.3 °C during the second heating run, as expected for an organic glass. The amorphous structure of the compound Pt–N was further supported by X-ray diffraction analysis which confirmed the absence of any diffraction peak in the 1 to 40 angle range on a powder sample of Pt–N (see Fig. S4, ESI†).

3.2 Photophysical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible absorption and PL spectra of Pt–N in solution and as a thin film. As shown in Fig. 2a, at λ < 360 nm, Pt–N displays vibronically structured absorption bands with extinction coefficients >5.0 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1,55 which are within the range of ε values previously determined for the (π–π*) transitions of fluorene and (N∧C∧N) ligands. The broad, low-energy bands with λmax in the 360–480 nm region and ε < 1.6 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 are comparable with the low-energy singlet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (1MLCT) transitions of the organoplatinum(II) complex Pt–N.57 Both absorption and PL spectra of Pt–N are similar in dimethyl sulfoxide, dichloromethane, and methanol with the absorption maximum at around 328–335 nm. The Pt–N exhibited a red-shift of approximately 10 nm for the maximum absorption in the film when compared to the solution data. This phenomenon may be caused by increased organoplatinum(II) complex chain aggregation and metal–metal interactions in the solid state.48,49 The Pt–N film showed a larger band gap of 2.66 eV than those of PTB7 and PC71BM, and can confine the excitons in the active layer when used as the interlayer in PSCs.23,51 The PL spectra of Pt–N in methanol, dichloromethane, and dimethyl sulfoxide solutions peaked at 518–522 nm as a result of the mixture of triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer and triplet intraligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3ILCT) excited states. A film sample of Pt–N at room temperature showed a bathochromic shift of approximately 100 nm for the lowest-energy emission band when compared with solution data and exhibited structureless emissions at the λmax of 674 nm (Fig. 2b), which can be assigned to triplet metal–metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MMLCT) excited states associated with Pt⋯Pt interactions.48,49

3.3 Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the interfacial modification effect of Pt–N on the PSCs, a PTB7:PC71BM blend was used as the photoactive layer with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/interlayer/Al device configuration. The chemical structure of the donor polymer (PTB7) and the acceptor (PC71BM), and the device configuration are provided in Scheme 1. A 5 nm layer of Pt–N was spin-coated atop the photoactive layer from its methanol solution to create a cathode interlayer. For comparison, control devices using a typical cathode interface material PFN with a thickness of 5 nm were also fabricated under the same conditions. In addition, a control device without any interlayer was also fabricated. To rule out the possible influence caused by solvents, the devices whose active layers were rinsed with methanol before thermal evaporation of the Al electrode were also fabricated and tested.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the PSCs measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are presented in Fig. 3a, and their corresponding Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE values as determined from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. The best PSC with a bare Al cathode exhibited a PCE of 3.62%, with a Jsc of 15.65 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.53 V, and an FF of 43.58%. After inserting a thin layer of a typical cathode interface material PFN with an optimized thickness of 5 nm, the PCE reached 8.20%. Interestingly, the PSC using a 5 nm thin layer of the Pt–N cathode interlayer exhibited an even higher performance. The Pt–N/Al cathode device offered a higher PCE of 8.89%, with a Jsc of 16.36 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V, and an FF of 72.39%, which is one of the highest PCEs for conventional single junction PTB7 based PSCs.58 Notably, Voc, Jsc and FF of the Pt–N/Al device were simultaneously enhanced relative to the bare Al cathode device, which led to significantly improved device performance. Moreover, it is clear that the solvent effects are less pronounced than those of PFN and Pt–N. The statistical data (average values and standard deviations) of photovoltaic performances calculated from eight repeating devices for each kind of PSC are also listed in Table S1 (ESI†).

When amino-functionalized polymers/molecules are spin-coated atop cathodes (such as ITO), it reduces their WF through the surface dipole interaction between the pendant amino groups and the cathodes.18,29,40,43 The reduced WF of cathodes increased the built-in potential of the PSCs, which brought about an improved Voc.36 Similarly, the significantly improved Voc of PSCs with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN or Pt–N/Al device configuration as compared to that of the PSCs without any cathode interlayer with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/Al device configuration was also credited by the reduced WF of Al cathodes thanks to the surface dipole interaction between Pt–N (PFN) and the Al cathode.56 The decreased WF of the Al cathode by Pt–N (PFN) interlayers can also offer better energy level alignment with the LUMO level of PC71BM and thereby facilitate the electron transport and collection, which in turn leads to the enhancement in FFs.
To gain an in-depth understanding of the improvement of the device performance after inserting the Pt–N interlayer, the J–V characteristics (see Fig. 3b) of the PSCs both with and without interlayers were measured under dark. Clearly, the PFN/Al device and the Pt–N/Al device exhibited similar J–V characteristics under dark conditions. In the region from −2 to 0 V, the reverse currents of the PSCs using PFN and Pt–N as cathode interlayers were significantly suppressed compared to those of the bare Al electrode devices. We attribute the high FFs to the improved charge selectivity at the cathode interface, as indicated by the significantly reduced dark current under reversed bias in the J–V plot of the corresponding devices. This result indicates that the PFN and Pt–N interlayers possess good hole-blocking properties and prevent hole current leakage through the cathode interface at reversed bias. In addition, the amino groups in the PFN side chain were recently found to be a hole-trapping center that can act as an effective hole-blocking layer, and can optimize the rectification ratio and thus increase the FFs of the devices.41–43 Moreover, the PFN and Pt–N interlayer based PSCs exhibited higher injection currents compared to that of the bare Al electrode device under forward bias, which is indicative of increased electron injection from the Al electrode and is consistent with the decreased series resistance (Rs) (15.7, 5.5, and 4.5 Ω cm2 for bare Al, PFN/Al, and Pt–N/Al devices, respectively) (see Table 1). The remarkable electron injection ability of these amino-functionalized interlayers was attributed to the formation of interface dipoles due to the interaction between the metal cathode and the pendent amino groups.56 The improved diode characteristics of the Pt–N device compared to that of the control bare Al electrode device suggested that Pt–N is efficient in blocking holes and collecting electrons, and therefore contributed to the improved photovoltaic performance.
Besides the significant improvement in Voc and FF, a slight increase of Jsc from 15.65 mA cm−2 for bare Al based PSCs to 16.36 mA cm−2 (by an additional increase of 5%) was observed through the incorporation of the Pt–N interlayer. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices illuminated by monochromatic light are provided in Fig. 4. The shape of the EQE curve of the PFN/Al and Pt–N/Al devices was almost identical to that of the bare Al device across the entire wavelength range. Moreover, the Pt–N/Al and PFN/Al devices exhibited a slight increase in values. The Jsc of all the PSC devices matched well with the values obtained by the integration of the corresponding EQE spectra (see Table S1, ESI†).

AFM was carried out to further investigate the influence of the Pt–N interfacial layer on the device performance. The resulting topography images are provided in Fig. 5. The surface of the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ film is smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.99 nm (Fig. 5a). The surface of the PTB7:PC71BM film treated using methanol did not cause an observable change in morphology and the roughness of the film, and the RMS roughness of the resultant BHJ was 1.88 nm (Fig. 5b). No obvious reconstruction of the surface of PTB7:PC71BM blends after solvent (methanol) treatment is indicated. When an ultrathin PFN film was spin-coated on PTB7:PC71BM blends, the surface becomes smooth and homogeneous with a RMS roughness of 1.70 nm (Fig. 5c), indicating that PFN has good film forming properties on PTB7:PC71BM blends. However, the small molecule Pt–N-treated surface of the PTB7:PC71BM blend showed a much rougher morphology with a RMS roughness of 2.30 nm as shown in Fig. 5d. Notably, there are some visible islands distributed over the surface. The formation mechanism of the islands may be the self-aggregation of Pt–N itself.48,49 This is probably due to its metal–metal (Pt⋯Pt) supramolecular interaction,48,49 high polarity, and adverse wettability of the Pt–N methanol solution on the hydrophobic active layer. Different surface roughnesses implied that the interfacial adhesion between the Al cathode and the PTB7:PC71BM layer is different. To some extent, the larger surface roughness is found between the active layer and the cathode, and the higher interfacial area is formed between the active layer and the cathode. Consequently, a better charge transport is expected from good interfacial adhesion between the Al cathode and the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ layer, and so the resultant PSCs exhibited an improved FF and Jsc. The AFM result verified the great potential of Pt–N as a cathode interlayer in PSCs.59,60

4. Conclusions
To summarize, an amino-functionalized organoplatinum(II) complex called Pt–N with pendent amino groups was developed and utilized as an efficient Al cathode interlayer for improving the electron transport and collection properties in high performance PSCs. This newly developed small molecule Pt–N offers the properties necessary for an efficient interface material including a well-defined chemical structure, orthogonal solvent processability, good film formation, low optical absorption, excellent electron selectivity, and good hole-blocking ability. By using Pt–N as the cathode interlayer underneath the Al cathode, the PCE of the PSCs can be increased from the initial 3.62% for bare Al PSCs to 8.89%, benefiting from the dramatic enhancement in Voc, FF and a slight improvement in Jsc. These results indicate that amino-functionalized organoplatinum(II) complexes would be a promising family of interfacial materials for highly efficient PSCs.
