    , Accepted 6th March 2020First published on 6th March 2020AbstractAs one of the most promising alternatives for future energy systems, the rechargeable Zn–air battery (ZAB) has attracted extensive attention due to its extraordinarily high theoretical specific energy density. However, several obstacles restrict its practical application. One challenge is the sluggish kinetics of oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) in the discharging and charging processes of ZABs. In addition, when using unifunctional ORR or OER electrocatalysts as air electrodes, like noble metal catalysts (Pt/C or Ru/IrO2), there are the disadvantages of high cost and poor stability. Therefore, rational design of non-noble metal bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability is essential for the development of ZABs. In this review, we discuss the latest developments of non-noble metal bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts for ZABs. Firstly, the related reaction mechanisms of ORR and OER are introduced. Then, the latest developments of bifunctional ORR/OER materials for ZABs are discussed in detail from three aspects: (i) MOF-based catalysts, including pristine MOFs and their derivatives; (ii) metal-free-based carbon catalysts, including heteroatom-doped carbon and defective carbon; (iii) metal-based catalysts, including metal–nitrogen–carbon materials (such as metals/alloys, single-atom) and metal compound materials. Finally, some challenges and outlooks for the optimal design of bifunctional air electrodes for rechargeable ZABs with high activity and ultra-long lifetime are put forward.Shuangshuang RenShuangshuang Ren received her BS degree from Shangqiu Normal University, China, in 2015 and her MS degree from Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, China, in 2018.

1. Introduction
Recently, with the growth of energy and environmental crises, great efforts have been devoted to develop alternative novel energy storage and conversion technologies.1 So far, the Li-ion battery (LIB) is currently the most successful energy storage technology since its first report in 1990.2–4 Unfortunately, its shortcomings have limited its further development and large-scale applications,5,6 such as rare lithium resources, low specific energy density (200–250 W h kg−1),7,8 and safety concerns. To avoid these problems, alternative inexpensive and electrically rechargeable battery technologies are attracting more and more attention.
The metal–air battery is among the alternative cost-effective battery technologies with high theoretical energy density, low cost, and environmental friendliness, and which is composed of an air cathode and a metal anode (e.g., Li, Na, K, Mg, Al, Zn, Fe), generating electricity through the redox reaction between oxygen and the metal anode. A comparison of different metal–air batteries is shown in Table 1. Among them, Li–air and Zn–air batteries have received the most extensive attention. Currently, Li–air batteries show ultra-high theoretical energy density of 5200 W h kg−1 and operating voltage of 2.96 V,9–11 but some shortcomings, such as the explosive reactivity of lithium with water or air and rare lithium resource, largely limit their large-scale practical application. The Zn–air battery (ZAB) is a very promising battery system due to its outstanding advantages. For example, the theoretical energy density of ZABs is 1086 W h kg−1, which is about 5 times higher than that of LIBs due to free oxygen supply from the atmosphere. In addition, the appropriate operating voltage (∼1.65 V) of ZABs is just practical, and it is not too high to induce the decomposition of water in electrolyte. Moreover, due to abundant Zn resources and the free supply of oxygen for the air cathode, ZABs can be potentially manufactured at a lower cost of <10$ per kW per h than of LIBs (400–800$ per kW per h).12 Overall, ZABs have been considered as promising for future energy application.

The first ZAB was originally designed by Maiche in 1878, and the first commercial product appeared in 1932. Recently, rechargeable ZABs have emerged and undergone rapid development by the introduction of new bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the air cathode during discharging/charging process.13–15 Nevertheless, rechargeable ZABs are still in their infancy and confronted with many challenges. On the one hand, the efficiency and power density of rechargeable ZABs are seriously restricted by the sluggish kinetics for the ORR and OER. Due to the high overpotential on the air cathode, the round-trip energy efficiency of rechargeable ZABs is usually less than 55–65%.16 On the other hand, the long-term cycle performance of ZABs is currently less than a quarter of that of commercial LIBs, which further limits their practical application.17 Based on the above considerations, developing high-efficiency and well-tolerated catalysts as bifunctional ORR/OER air electrodes is of great importance for rechargeable ZABs. Generally, the ideal catalysts should meet the following basic requirements:
(i) Activity
The activity of catalysts is closely related to each intrinsic catalytic active site and the number of active sites. Firstly, heteroatom doping (N, O, S, B, P, and metal atoms) and defect control (vacancy and edge) will generate charge redistribution and change the electronic structure, thereby reducing the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing species on them and improving the intrinsic catalytic activity. Secondly, control of the porous structure (such as micropores, mesopores, macropores) can also increase the exposed number/density of active sites. The macropores can provide more mass transfer pathways, while the meso-/micropores can provide larger specific surface areas to increase the accessibility of reactants to the active centers.
(ii) Conductivity
High conductivity is the key to electron transport in all electrochemical processes. For instance, π-conjugated conductive ligands and unbound electrons dissociated from sp2 carbon structure can ensure the rapid charge transport in redox reactions, thus enhancing electrocatalytic activity.
(iii) Stability
The ideal catalyst must possess excellent chemical and structural stability in the harsh acid/alkali environment. Due to the increase of particle size, the agglomeration of particles, and the change of oxidation state on the surface of the electrocatalyst during the long-term operation of a battery, the catalyst will gradually age and partially inactivate, which will lead to the decay of the battery performance. Therefore, the durability of catalysts is an important factor affecting the commercialization of batteries.
(iv) Selectivity
The ideal electrocatalysts should have high selectivity towards specific processes. For instance, molecular oxygen (O2) can be electrochemically reduced to water (H2O) by 4e−, or transformed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by 2e−. In order to maximize the energy conversion efficiency, the former is preferred in the fuel cell reaction, while the latter is a green synthesis method of H2O2. Thus, the selectivity of catalysts can effectively regulate the reaction pathway and products of ORR.
(v) Low cost and environmentally friendly
Noble metal (e.g., Pt, Ag, Ru, Ir, etc.) electrocatalysts possess high catalytic activity, but the shortcomings of high cost, low stability, and resource scarcity seriously restrict their practical application. Metal–organic framework (MOF)-based catalysts, metal-free-based carbon catalysts or transition metal-based catalysts will be the focus of future electrocatalyst design due to intrinsic catalytic activity and low cost. Thus, the design and preparation of electrocatalysts should follow the principles of low cost, low energy consumption and no pollution.
In this review, we will systematically summarize the research progress of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts in recent years and highlight their applications in rechargeable ZABs. Firstly, the configuration of rechargeable ZABs and the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the air cathode are briefly introduced. Secondly, as shown in Fig. 1, the recently reported bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts are classified as: (i) MOF-based catalysts, including pristine MOFs and their derivatives; (ii) metal-free-based carbon catalysts, including heteroatom-doped carbon and defective carbon; (iii) metal-based catalysts, including metal–nitrogen–carbon materials (such as single-atom, metals/alloys) and metal compound materials. Finally, the existing challenges and outlooks for the development of high-efficiency bifunctional oxygen catalysts for ZABs are discussed. This review will provide timely information of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts and underline the importance of catalyst compositions and architectures, which will be helpful to guide researchers to design and manufacture high-performance rechargeable ZABs.

2. Battery configuration and working mechanism
2.1 Battery configuration

2.1.1 Composition of ZABs. 
As shown in Fig. 2, a ZAB is comprised of a metal Zn anode, an air cathode, a membrane separator, and an electrolyte.18
 Fig. 2  Schematic battery configurations and illustration of electrode reactions during discharging process (left) and charging process (right). Reproduced with permission.18 Copyright 2018, Wiley. 
(a) Anode: Zn electrode. 
The Zn anode that determines the capacity of the battery is commonly in the form of pure Zn powder or Zn plate.19–21 Zn has a characteristic set of advantages, including low toxicity, abundance, electrochemical reversibility, constant discharge voltage, and high energy density, so it is the most stable and non-corrosive electropositive metal in aqueous and alkaline media.22 In general, the surface morphology of Zn is very important for obtaining a high reaction rate in an alkaline electrolyte. In order to improve battery performance under high currents, smaller particles, such as fibers23 and dendrites,24 are preferred in ZABs.
(b) Cathode: air electrode. 
The air cathode is usually composed of a catalyst layer and a gas-diffusion layer consisting of active carbon and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).25 As a wetting agent, superhydrophobic PTFE can not only allow air to pass through the gas-diffusion layer, but also prevent aqueous electrolyte leaking from the air cathode. In general, a high rate of oxygen reduction usually occurs close to the three-phase interface (catalyst, electrolyte, and oxygen).
(c) Separator. 
The separator that prevents physical contact between the anode and cathode should meet the basic requirements of high stability, high resistance, low electrical conductivity and high ionic conductivity.26–29 Separators used in ZABs are based on porous polymeric films composed of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyetherimide, or polyacrylic acid,30–34 which can enable rapid OH− transfer during discharging/charging processes. However, the pores of the separator are sometimes large, allowing Zn(OH)42− anions to pass, resulting in the reduction of the battery capacity and cycling efficiency.35,36 Polysulfonium membrane is also an effective alternative material for ZAB separators to effectively prevent Zn ions permeating from anode to cathode.32,37
(d) Electrolyte. 
As the medium of ion migration during the discharging/charging process, the conductivity of the electrolyte is an important factor affecting the ohmic resistance of batteries. Zn reacts violently in acid solution, and anode corrosion is serious. Therefore, an alkaline electrolyte is often used instead of an acid electrolyte in most cases.38 6 M KOH aqueous solution is most usually used in primary ZAB electrolyte with an ionic conductivity of 620 mS cm−1. In some studies of rechargeable ZABs, ZnCl2 or Zn(Ac)2 with a low concentration (e.g., 0.2 M) is added to the 6 M KOH electrolyte to promote the reversible translation of Zn anode.39
Recent studies have shown that ionic liquids (ILs) can be used as electrolytes in ZABs because of their low volatility, no water leakage, intrinsic ionic conductivity, non-flammability, high electrochemical stability, and high thermal stability40 during the charging/discharging process.41,42 Kar et al. comprehensively analyzed ILs related to energy applications.43 Most ILs can wet PTFE and fill the electrode holes, despite their being usually too adherent to submerge the air electrode completely. However, the electrocatalytic activities of aprotic electrolytes are still inferior to that of KOH electrolyte due to their lower ion conductivity.44 In addition, the leakage of electrolyte is also a big problem that affects the safety and lifetime of batteries. In order to reduce water loss, gel electrolytes are a feasible solution due to their good safety and ionic conductivity. For instance, Mohamad et al. proved that KOH solution mixed with gel could be used as a new alkaline electrolyte for solid-state ZABs.45


2.1.2 Product form of ZABs. 
Rechargeable ZABs have several types of configurations, such as planar (liquid, solid), flexible (wearable, coaxial cable) and coin-type. As shown in Fig. 3a, the configuration of conventional planar rechargeable ZABs is easy to assemble, so it is the most widely used configuration in research.46 In addition, gel electrolytes can also be applied in planar rechargeable ZABs instead of liquid electrolytes due to their advantages of low reaction activity, low density, ease of film formation and good elasticity. As shown in Fig. 3b, a gel polymer electrolyte battery47 can be made into various shapes with the advantages of pressure resistance, impact resistance, low production cost and easy processing and utilization.

Compared with the traditional rigid ZABs, flexible ZABs possess the characteristics of high safety, good fast charging performance, high energy density and low cost in theory, and can be further designed into different shapes, such as wearable48,49 (Fig. 3c and d) or coaxial cable50 (Fig. 3e) ZABs, which can make electronic products more beautiful and more in line with the form of the human structure, so having a broad market demand. However, large-scale rechargeable ZABs often are of the coin type (Fig. 3f)51 that is light and small, so it is mostly used in everyday life. Although their configurations are different, the electrochemical working mechanisms of most rechargeable ZABs are similar.

2.2 Working mechanism
As shown in Fig. 2, the overall working mechanism of a ZAB can be described by the following eqn (1)–(10): Zn + 4OH− = Zn(OH)42− + 2e−(1) Zn(OH)42− = ZnO + H2O + 2OH−(2) Zn + 2OH− = ZnO + H2O + 2e− (E0 = −1.25 V vs. SHE)(3)
Cathode: O2 + 2H2O + 4e− = 4OH− (E0 = 0.4 V vs. SHE)(4)
Overall reaction: 2Zn + O2 = 2ZnO (Eeq = 1.65 V vs. SHE)(5)
Recharge:
Anode: ZnO + H2O + 2OH− = Zn(OH)42−(6) Zn(OH)42− + 2e− = Zn + 4OH−(7) ZnO + H2O + 2e− = Zn + 2OH− (E0 = 1.25 V vs. SHE)(8)
Cathode: 4OH− = O2 + 2H2O + 4e− (E0 = − 0.4 V vs. SHE)(9)
Overall reaction: 2ZnO = 2Zn + O2 (Eeq = −1.65 V vs. SHE)(10)
According to the reaction mechanism, Eeq = E0 (cathode) − E0 (anode), the theoretical working voltage of ZABs is 1.65 V. In practice, the working voltage is generally less than 1.2 V, so as to obtain a considerable discharge current density, which is mainly caused by high overpotential of the air electrode during the discharge process (ORR). The reverse reaction (OER) usually requires a charging potential of about 2 V or above. Such a large charging and discharging voltage gap results in a low round-trip energy efficiency (55–65%) of rechargeable ZABs. Therefore, the main role of the electrocatalysts of the air electrode is to reduce the overpotential during the OER and ORR processes, thereby improving energy efficiency.
3. Oxygen reaction mechanism of air cathode
Compared with primary ZABs involving only the ORR discharging process, rechargeable ZABs require bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts as air cathodes in discharging/charging processes to accelerate the sluggish reaction rates and improve the round-trip efficiency. Since aqueous ZABs usually operate with alkaline electrolytes, herein, we only briefly introduce possible ORR and OER mechanisms in alkaline conditions.
3.1 Oxygen reduction reaction
Traditionally, according to different types of oxygen adsorption modes (e.g., bidentate O2 adsorption mode and end-on O2 adsorption mode) on the catalyst surface, it is believed that two types of ORR mechanisms may exist: direct four-electron pathway and peroxide two-electron pathway. In four-electron reduction based on a bidentate O2 adsorption mode, two O atoms are coordinated with the catalyst, and the oxygen is directly reduced to OH−, as shown in eqn (11): O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) + 4e− = 4OH− (aq) (E0 = 0.40 V vs. SHE)(11)
In two-electron reduction based on an end-on O2 adsorption mode, only one O atom is coordinated with the catalyst to form H2O2, and the intermediate H2O2 is further reduced to form OH−, as follows: O2 (g) + H2O (l) + 2e− = HO2− (aq) + OH− (aq) (E0 = −0.07 V vs. SHE)(12) HO2− (aq) + H2O (l) + 2e− = 3OH− (aq) (E0 = 0.87 V vs. SHE)(13)
Overall, the two-electron pathway in the ORR process can form corrosive HO2− species, which will reduce the efficiency and cycle stability of ZABs. Thus the four-electron pathway with its high energy efficiency is preferable, the reactions being as follows: * + O2 (g) + H2O (l) + e− = HOO* + OH− (aq)(14) HOO* + e− = O* + OH− (aq)(15) O* + H2O (l) + e− = HO* + OH− (aq)(16) HO* + e− = OH− (aq) + *(17) Overall: O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) + 4e− = 4OH− (aq)(18)
Generally, the generation of multiple oxygen-containing intermediates, including HOO*, O*, and HO* (* represents the surface active site), determines the electrocatalytic properties. According to Sabatier's principle, when the bonding of oxygen species on the surface of a catalyst is neither too strong nor too weak, the catalytic activity is expected to be optimum.
3.2 Oxygen evolution reaction
As the reverse reaction of the ORR pathway, the OER in alkaline solutions is also a complex electrochemical reaction, including four discrete electron transfer steps, in which a series of oxygen adsorbates are produced, including HO*, O*, and HOO*, as in the following eqn (19)–(23): * + OH− (aq) = HO* + e−(19) HO* + OH− (aq) = O* + H2O (l) + e−(20) O* + OH− (aq) = HOO* + e−(21) HOO* + OH− (aq) = * + O2 (g) + H2O (l) + e−(22) Overall: 4OH− (aq) = O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) + 4e−(23)
Similar to the ORR, the OER kinetics are mainly controlled by the binding strength of oxygen adsorbates on the surface of active sites. According to Sabatier's principle, too weak an oxygen binding strength makes the oxidation of HO* a rate-determining step, while too strong an oxygen binding strength makes the formation of HOO* a rate-limiting step.
As shown in eqn (19)–(22), the Gibbs free energy change in each elementary step can be given by eqn (24)–(27): ΔG1 = ΔGHO*(24) ΔG2 = ΔGO* − ΔGHO*(25) ΔG3 = ΔGHOO* − ΔGO*(26) ΔG4 = ΔGO2 − ΔGHOO*(27)
Based on the relationship between the adsorption energies of oxygen adsorbates and their catalytic activities, theoretical volcano plots have been used to predict the activity and selectivity of catalysts for ORR or OER.52,53 The best unifunctional ORR or OER catalysts are still the noble metal catalysts Pt and Ru/IrO2, respectively (Fig. 4a and b). However, in order to achieve bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic activity in one material, one must rely on the interdependence of the adsorption energies towards adsorbed oxygen species. Rossmeisl and co-workers graphically described the effect of the relationship between GHOO* and GHO* on ORR and OER volcanic plots.54 The best achievable potentials for OER (green pyramid) and ORR (blue pyramid) are plotted as functions of ΔG1 and ΔG3 (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the constraint between *OH and *OOH is represented by the red plane, and the ORR and OER volcano plots are obtained by the intersections of two pyramids and the red plane in Fig. 4d. Therefore, in order to achieve bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity in one material, one important target is to make the vertices of two volcanos closer by reasonably and effectively adjusting the electrocatalyst.

(c and d) Schematic illustration of how the scaling relationship affects the ORR and OER volcano plots. Reproduced with permission.54 Copyright 2016, Elsevier. 
In practice, in order to evaluate the bifunctional catalytic activity, the potential difference (ΔE) between the potential reaching a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (E10) for OER and the half-wave potential (E1/2) for ORR is calculated. Note that the current density at 3 mA cm−2 (E−3) is sometimes used as the evaluation standard for ORR, instead of E1/2.55 In general, the smaller the potential gap (ΔE), the better the bifunctional performance. In addition, in order to evaluate the properties of ZABs, typical assessment standards should focus on the key performance indicators, including open-circuit potential (OCP), peak power density, specific capacity, round-trip energy efficiency, charge and discharge voltage gap (Egap), and cycling durability. In view of this, we hope to design and manufacture high-efficiency and well-tolerated bifunctional catalysts as air electrodes to further accelerate the commercialization of ZABs.
4. Bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts
To date, most unifunctional ORR or OER electrocatalysts have been developed with high catalytic performance, such as Pt- or Ru/IrO2-based noble metal catalysts.52,53 Despite that two unifunctional catalysts can be combined to achieve bifunctional catalysis, this combination increases the commercial cost and complexity of the preparation process. Thus a bifunctional non-noble metal ORR/OER electrocatalyst for the air electrode is regarded as the best choice and inevitably determines the performance of a rechargeable ZAB. Herein, we will systematically summarize recently developed bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts as air cathode for rechargeable ZABs from three aspects: (i) MOF-based catalysts, including MOFs and their derivatives; (ii) metal-free-based carbon catalysts, including heteroatom-doped carbon and defective carbon; (iii) metal-based catalysts, including metal–nitrogen–carbon materials (such as single-atom, metals/alloys) and metal compound materials.
4.1 MOF-based catalysts
MOFs,56–66 composed of metal ions or clusters coordinated with organic ligands, especially zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs),67–71 have exhibited huge potential in catalysis due to their highly ordered crystalline structures, adjustable pore size, ultra-high specific surface areas and structural designability.
Compared with commercial non-porous noble metal catalysts, the MOF-based catalysts mostly possess the following unique advantages: (i) easy doping of highly dispersed heteroatoms (e.g., metal atoms, N, O, S, and P) can tailor the local electronic structure of catalysts, which can effectively reduce the adsorption energy of intermediate species, thereby improving the catalytic performance; (ii) the controllable size, morphology and structure of pristine MOFs are helpful for improving the catalytic performance; (iii) conductive ligands may endow MOFs with good electrical conductivity to achieve rapid electron transfer; (iv) the supermolecular feature of MOFs may provide good electrochemical stability and durability in electrocatalysis. Therefore, in order to achieve highly efficient MOF-based catalysts, it is vital to develop MOFs containing appropriate metal ions, organic ligands, architectures, and accessible voids. Herein, the design and synthesis strategy of MOF-based bifunctional oxygen catalysts will be generally divided into two types: pristine MOFs and their derivatives. In addition, the bifunctional properties of several recently reported MOF-based oxygen electrocatalysts are shown in Table 2.

4.1.1 Pristine MOFs. 
As a new class of MOF material,72 two-dimensional (2D) conductive MOFs73,74 have attracted considerable attention due to their inherent structural porosity, chemical stability and high conductivity. To date, most 2D conductive MOFs have been constructed from the coordination between metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+etc.) and benzene- or triphenylene-derived ligands with imine (–NH2), phenol (–OH), or thiophenol (–SH) functional groups. Based on in-plane π-conjugation, these 2D MOFs exhibit excellent electrical conductivity.
2,3,6,7,10,11-Hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) as a classic conductive ligand has been applied to the synthesis of a new 2D conductive MOF, Ni3(HITP)2, by Dincă and co-workers, as shown in Fig. 5a.75 In the MOF structure, the Ni coordinated by four amino groups is a conjugate coplanar structure, and the ligand has a large π bond, which could ensure electron transport and high conductivity. As a well-defined and highly ordered ORR electrocatalyst, 2D Ni3(HITP)2 exhibited high ORR activity and excellent electrical conductivity (σ = 40 S cm−1) without further treatment or modification (Fig. 5b).76 Subsequently, their group further revealed the real active site of O2 reduction with Ni3(HITP)2 by experimental and computational data.77 The kinetic and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data showed that the binding and activation of O2 in Ni3(HITP)2 did not occur on metal Ni, but on the ligand. As shown in Fig. 5c, density functional theory (DFT) calculations further identified that the most likely active site for catalysis was the β-C relative to the imine group. This is the first time that conductive MOFs with excellent electrical conductivity have successfully and effectively electrocatalyzed ORR, exhibiting potential applications for ZABs.

Zhang et al. also developed a new class of 2D fewer-layer π-conjugated conductive [Co3(HHTP)2]n LB nanosheets via the Langmuir–Blodgett and layer-by-layer (LB-LbL) nanofilm growth method (Fig. 5d).78 This is the first time that 2D conductive MOF nanosheets were successfully applied in OER with ultrahigh mass activity (64.63 A mg−1, 1.7 V vs. RHE) and good durability (30000 s), exhibiting promising application in the field of rechargeable ZABs.
Previous studies on conductive MOFs only focused on unifunctional ORR or OER. Recently, researchers have been devoted to the study of the bifunctional properties of conductive MOFs. For instance, Peng et al. synthesized a series of conductive MOFs of M3HITP2 with various Ni/Co ratios using HITP as the ligand.79 Compared with Ni3HITP2, the non-preferred coordination of HITP ligands with Co2+, poor crystallinity and π–π stacking of Co3HITP2 indicated a distorted quadrilateral structure with lack of coplanarity due to the unpaired electron of 3dz2, which had been confirmed by experimental results. As a result, Co3HITP2 demonstrated significant catalytic activities in both ORR (E1/2 = 0.80 V) (Fig. 5e) and OER (E10 = 1.6 V), indicating that the unpaired 3d electrons of the metal center can effectively promote ORR activity. Rechargeable ZABs using Co3HITP2 as an air cathode demonstrated excellent energy efficiency and long-term stability (over 80 h) (Fig. 5f). This is the first time that conductive MOFs with significant bifunctional ORR/OER activity, excellent conductivity, and good stability were used to fabricate rechargeable ZABs, which paves the way for the direct utilization of conductive MOFs without pyrolysis in the field of green energy.
In addition to the HITP series of conductive MOFs, Lee et al. also fabricated a novel 3D dual-linked hexaiminobenzene MOF (Mn/Fe-HIB-MOF) through isolated reactions of hexaiminobenzene ligands with ammonia solutions of Mn(II) and Fe(II) salts in air atmosphere (Fig. 5g), followed by a thermal process.80 The resultant Mn/Fe-HIB-MOF possessed quintet-shelled hollow spheres, a large surface area of 2298 m2 g−1, and effective M(II)–N4 moieties, exhibiting superior bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (ΔE = 0.627 V) with a positive E1/2 of 0.883 V for ORR and a low E10 of 1.61 V for OER (Fig. 5h). Significantly, the Mn/Fe-HIB-MOF cathode showed a record-breaking cycle lifetime of over 1000 h (6000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2) and 600 h (3600 cycles at 25 mA cm−2) for liquid and all-solid-state ZABs, respectively (Fig. 5i). These promising results indicated these novel hexaiminobenzene MOFs with excellent bifunctional ORR/OER activity, good conductivity, and significant stability possess great potential in the industrial application of rechargeable ZABs.
Ultrathinning MOFs into 2D nanosheets with coordinated unsaturated metal sites is another effective strategy to obtain high-performance MOF-based electrocatalysts. For instance, Tang et al. synthesized NiCo bimetal MOF nanosheets (NiCo-UMOFNs) with a mixed solution of Ni2+, Co2+ and terephthalic acid (BDC).81 As electrocatalysts for OER, the NiCo-UMOFNs exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity with a low E10 of 1.48 V and long-term cycle stability (at least 200 h). DFT calculations indicated that the unsaturated metal sites were the main active centers for OER, and the electron coupling effect of Ni and Co further improved the OER activity. Thus, ultrathinning MOFs strategy is effective for preparation of high-efficiency OER electrocatalysts at the atomic level.
Furthermore, 2D MOF nanosheets modified with other MOF nanoparticles have also been considered as an effective strategy for the design of oxygen catalysts. For instance, Dou et al. synthesized a hybrid 2D dual MOF (denoted as Ni-MOF@Fe-MOF) for the first time by depositing inert Fe-MOF nanoparticles on active Ni-MOF nanosheets (Fig. 6a).82 Benefiting from the morphology of 2D nanosheets and the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe species, the catalytic performance of the hybrid 2D MOF was substantially improved. The optimal Ni-MOF@Fe-MOF with a Ni/Fe atom ratio of 3.5/1 possessed the lowest E10 of 1.495 V, which was lowered by 100 mV after hybridization (Fig. 6b). Similar performance enhancement had been also successfully confirmed in the NiCo-MOF nanosheets. In addition, it is found that the hybrid MOFs were in situ transformed into metal oxide nanoparticles during the OER process as real active centers. These findings provide new insights of excellent OER performance for the design of pristine MOFs in electrocatalysis.

For the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets, the conventional synthesis method of ultrasonic separation (top-down) and solvothermal (bottom-up) is very complex, time-consuming, and difficult to translate to mass production. Thus, it is very important to seek a simple and effective method to synthesize 2D MOF nanosheets. For instance, Zhu et al. reported a surfactant-free 2D oxide sacrifice approach (2dOSA) to prepare ultrathin FeCo MOF-74 nanosheets (denoted as FeCo-MNS) by using ultrathin iron-cobalt oxide nanosheets (FeCo-ONS, 1.2 nm) as self-sacrificial templates, as shown in Fig. 6c.83 The as-prepared FeCo-MNS possessed a thickness of 2.6 nm and coordinated unsaturated metal sites, exhibiting an excellent OER activity with a low E10 of 1.528 V (Fig. 6d). It is believed that this idea will provide a facile way to synthesize large-scale 2D MOF nanosheets with excellent OER activity for wide applications in catalysis.
The combination of 2D MOF and conductive material is also an effective way to improve the electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic performance. For instance, Huang et al. in situ hybridized a novel MXene-MOF composite (denoted as Ti3C2Tx-CoBDC) via an interdiffusion reaction strategy (Fig. 6e).84 The 2D CoBDC layer could provide high pore structure and large specific surface area, and the hydrophilic and conductive Ti3C2Tx nanosheets could enable charge and ion transfer rapidly across the interface of Ti3C2Tx-CoBDC and promote the electrolyte to enter the catalytic active surfaces of CoBDC. As shown in Fig. 6e, the hybrid material exhibited excellent OER catalytic performance (E10 = 1.64 V). More importantly, rechargeable ZABs with the hybrid nanosheets as an air cathode exhibited excellent cycle stability with no obvious potential loss after 25 cycles (for 15000 s) of charging/discharging (Fig. 6f). More importantly, a Ti3C2Tx-CoBDC-based ZAB could successfully power a light-emitting diode (Fig. 6g). Considering the versatility of composition of conductive materials, this work will provide a reference for preparing a series of MOF electrocatalysts with ideal OER catalytic activity and excellent conductivity by combining different conductive materials.
Despite some conductive MOFs having been successfully proven as emerging electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, the expensive conductive ligands and complex synthesis conditions restrict their practical applications in the field of catalysis. Besides, some pristine 2D MOF nanosheets exhibited excellent OER activities; however, their ORR performance needs to be further explored. Moreover, the structural stability and electrical conductivity of conductive MOFs need to be further improved. Therefore, the above disadvantages limit the further application of pristine MOFs in ZABs. Currently, it is more effective to develop MOFs as self-sacrificial templates to construct porous carbon encapsulated metal/metal compound electrocatalysts for ZABs.


4.1.2 MOF derivatives. 
Recently, the use of MOF-derived porous metal/metal compound carbon-based materials has been considered as a facile and effective strategy to prepare bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts (such as metal–nitrogen–carbon materials and carbon-based metal compounds)85–90 due to their excellent catalytic activity, electrical conductivity and cycle stability.
(a) Metal–nitrogen–carbon materials. 
Metal–nitrogen-doped carbon materials (M–N–C, M = Fe, Co, Ni etc.) composed of M–Nx species embedded in carbon matrix have been widely reported due to their excellent ORR catalytic activity.91–95 This is because DFT calculations have revealed that the M–N4 sites could be as active as Pt during the ORR for O2 adsorption and OO bond breaking.96–98 It was further found that MOF-derived M–N–C materials composed of carbonized ligands with abundant N and transition metal sites not only possessed outstanding ORR activity, but also exhibited excellent OER property, and thus have attracted considerable attention in catalysis.99–105 This section mostly summarizes the design and application of a series of MOF-derived M–N–C materials, including single atoms, transition metals, and metal alloys.
Single atoms. 
Reducing the size of metal particles to the atomic scale and embedding them into ligand-derived porous carbon matrix is critical to achieve abundant active sites. Due to the fine dispersion and high atom utilization efficiency, MOF-derived single-atom M–N–C catalysts usually exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward ORR and OER.
In recent studies, MOF-derived N-doped carbon matrix has been selected as the carbon support for Co single atoms to develop active Co–N4 sites for oxygen catalysis. For instance, Huang et al. reported a salt-template method for the preparation of highly densely populated and monodisperse Co single atoms on an N-doped 2D carbon nanosheet (denoted as SCoNC) by direct pyrolysis of KCl particles wrapped with ZIF-67 (Fig. 7a).106 Benefiting from the unique structure and highly dispersed single Co–N species in carbon matrix, the resultant SCoNC showed high-efficiency bifunctional catalytic activity with a positive E1/2 of 0.91 V for ORR (Fig. 7b) and a low E10 of 1.54 V for OER. The ZABs based on the SCoNC catalyst also exhibited a high peak power density of 194 mW cm−2 (Fig. 7c) and high energy density of 945 W h kgZn−1. In addition, Guo et al. also successfully synthesized a bifunctional single-atom catalyst (denoted as Co SA@NCF/CNF) composed of Co single atoms embedded into N-doped porous carbon flakes using ZIFs and electrospun nanofibers as precursors through a general impregnation-carbonization-acidification route.107 Due to the unique hierarchically porous structure and rich single-atom active sites, the Co SA@NCF/CNF exhibited superior bifunctional catalytic activity with a low ΔE of 0.75 V (Fig. 7d). A wearable ZAB device based on Co SA@NCF/CNF demonstrated excellent stability under deformation (Fig. 7e) and a satisfactory battery capacity of 530.17 mA h gZn−1 (Fig. 7f). Thus, ZIF-67 can be reduced in situ during pyrolysis to form atomically dispersed Co–Nx sites with excellent bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic performance, good conductivity, and excellent stability.

In addition to Co–N–C material, single-atom Fe–N–C catalyst is also a representative bifunctional electrocatalyst, in which Fe–Nx species have been considered to be main active components of oxygen catalytic reaction in alkaline media. For instance, Ma et al. synthesized a bifunctional catalyst (denoted as FeNx-embedded PNC) with single-site active Fe–Nx species embedded into highly graphitic 2D porous N-doped carbon (PNC) by pyrolysis of a mixture of PPy-coated graphene and ZIF-8/Fe-Bipy (Fig. 7g).108 Due to the evaporation of Zn in ZIF-8 at high temperature, a large number of pores can be produced in the resulting N-doped carbon material. Moreover, benefiting from the combination of 2D porous PNC with high specific surface area, excellent conductivity, and abundant single-site active Fe–Nx species, the resultant FeNx-embedded PNC exhibited superior bifunctional catalytic activity with a positive E1/2 of 0.86 V for ORR and a low E10 of 1.62 V for OER. Furthermore, when assembled into a solid-state rechargeable ZAB, it showed excellent battery performance with a low voltage gap of 0.78 V. In addition, it could reach up to 54% compression strain and be bent up to 90° without obvious voltage degradation (Fig. 7h). Thus, ZIF-8 is one of the most effective candidate templates in the formation of hierarchical porous carbon matrix supporting metal single atoms to develop active M–N4 sites with high catalytic activity for oxygen catalysis.
Transition metals. 
Among a large number of MOF-derived M–N–C materials, Co–N–C materials, Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon matrix, usually exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity toward ORR and OER. For example, Zhang et al. rationally designed and reported a novel Co@N–C bifunctional catalyst (C-MOF-C2-T) by pyrolysis of a pair of enantiotopic chiral 3D MOFs, as shown in Fig. 8a.18 The C-MOF-C2-900 possessed a unique hierarchical rod-like structure, which was composed of Co nanoparticles uniformly embedded in N-doped carbon rings. Due to its unique structure and multiple active sites containing metallic Co, CoNx, CoOx and N species, the resultant C-MOF-C2-900 exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward both ORR (E1/2 = 0.817 V) and OER (E10 = 1.58 V). When assembled into a ZAB, it also exhibited excellent battery performance with a low potential gap of 0.53 V and cycling stability without obvious degeneration after 120 h (360 cycles) (Fig. 8b). Such a slight change makes it not only superior to commercial materials, but also one of the most stable materials in ZABs.

Besides, researchers are also devoted to the design of other types of MOF precursors to construct Co–N–C material as a bifunctional catalyst. For instance, Wu et al. synthesized N-doped-carbon/cobalt-nanoparticles/N-doped-carbon (denoted as NdC-CoNPs-NdC) multi-layer sandwich nanohybrids via pyrolysis of a new Co-MOF with 3D molecular structure (Fig. 8c).109 Benefiting from the synergistic effect of monodispersed Co nanoparticles with high activity/stability and porous N-self-doped carbon skeleton with high conductivity, the as-obtained NdC-CoNPs-NdC nanohybrids exhibited excellent bifunctional catalytic activity with a small ΔE of 0.83 V. When assembled into an on-chip all-solid-state rechargeable ZAB (OAR-ZAB) with an interdigital carbon cloth coated with NdC-CoNPs-NdC as air cathode and Zn foil as anode, as well as polyacrylamide–copolyacrylic/6 M KOH alkaline gel as solid-state electrolyte, the OAR-ZAB exhibited a good cycling stability of up to 150 cycles/50 h and a high specific capacity of as much as 771 mA h g−1. Such design of a multi-layer sandwich nanostructure endows transition metal/N-doped carbon nanohybrids with high bifunctional catalytic activity and stability for ZABs.
ZIF is often used as a sacrificial template to synthesize Co–N–C materials due to the regular dodecahedral morphology and simple synthesis method. For instance, Mu et al. prepared an advanced Co–Nx/C nanorod array (Co–Nx/C NRA) by two-step pyrolysis of 3D ZIF nanocrystals (Fig. 8d).110 Due to the synergistic effect of the rich Co–N coupling centers, the unique nanorod structure, and high specific surface area, the resultant Co–Nx/C NRA catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic activity with a low ΔE of 0.65 V (Fig. 8e). Remarkably, when assembled into a ZAB, it further displayed high energy density of 853.12 W h kgZn−1 and excellent cycle stability for up to 80 h without any significant decay at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2. Such low ΔE and high energy density endow the Co–N–C material with great prospects for practical application in rechargeable ZABs.
In addition to 3D ZIF, 2D ZIF nanosheets can also be utilized as sacrificial templates to construct Co–N–C materials. For instance, Guan et al. synthesized CoN-PHCNTs by pyrolysis of a novel 2D dual-metal (Zn/Co) ZIF (2D ZIF-PHS).111 The resultant Co–N-PHCNTs exhibited a unique morphology of positive-hexagon-shaped nanosheets covered with carbon nanotubes embedded with cobalt nanoparticles, displaying abundant effective electrochemical active surface areas. Benefiting from the above advantages, the Co–N-PHCNTs catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic properties with a positive E1/2 of 0.89 V for ORR and a low E10 of 1.62 V for OER. When assembled into a ZAB, it showed excellent cycling stability with no significant decay after cycling for 673 h at 5 mA cm−2. This ingenious design of 2D ZIF nanosheets by a surfactant-assisted method opens up a new direction for the preparation of 2D MOF materials.
Transition metal alloys. 
Use of MOF-derived metal alloys embedded into hierarchically porous graphitic carbon layers is also an effective strategy to acquire high-efficiency and well-durable bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts due to the synergism between the bimetallic components.
The design of a bimetallic MOF precursor is often an effective strategy for the construction of carbon-encapsulated metal alloy nanomaterials. For instance, Zhu et al. reported unique carbon-encapsulated NiFe alloy nanocrystals (denoted as NiFe@NCx) by pyrolysis of FeNi-MIL and melamine.112 Benefiting from the high metal loading, high dispersion of the encapsulated metal nanoparticles, and the coupling effect of the FeNi alloy with the graphite carbon layer (Fig. 9a), the NiFe@NCx catalyst exhibited excellent OER and ORR properties (ΔE = 0.69 V) with a positive E1/2 of 0.86 V for ORR (Fig. 9b). Rechargeable ZABs based on the NiFe@NCx catalyst also exhibited excellent battery performance with a small voltage gap of 0.78 V at 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9c). Such design of bimetallic MOFs can synergistically improve the bifunctional catalytic activity of metal alloy active sites, and the strong coupling effect of metal alloy with the carbon layer can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are also promising MOF precursors for the construction of carbon-encapsulated metal alloy nanomaterials. For instance, Mai et al. reported a new bifunctional electrocatalyst of NiFe alloys embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as NiFe/N-CNT) by pyrolysis of a mixture of NiFe-PBA and N-CNT.113 The experimental and computational results indicated that the as-prepared NiFe/N-CNT can remarkably enhance the OH− adsorption in OER and oxygen adsorption in ORR, which endowed the NiFe/N-CNT catalyst with excellent ORR/OER activity and high selectivity. When assembled into a liquid rechargeable ZAB, it displayed remarkable ultra-high peak power density of 300.7 mW cm−2 and a notably narrow voltage gap of 0.75 V, which is superior to the ZAB based on Pt/C + IrO2. Such effective combination of bimetallic PBA with N-CNT can dramatically improve the bifunctional catalytic activity, conductivity and selectivity of MOF-derived metal alloy catalysts.
The addition of bimetallic salts in MOF precursors is also a promising strategy to fabricate carbon-encapsulated metal alloy materials. For instance, Lu et al. reported a promising catalyst (denoted as FeNi/N-CPCF), which is composed of FeNi alloy embedded in N-doped CNTs-tangled hierarchically porous carbon fiber by pyrolysis of Fe2+/Ni2+ salts and ZIF-8-derived PAN electrospun fibers.114 Due to the hierarchically porous carbon fibers grafted on the ZIF-8-derived N-doped bamboo-like CNTs, and the strong synergetic effect between FeNi alloys (Fig. 9d), the resultant FeNi/N-CPCF-950 demonstrated excellent bifunctional performance with a low ΔE of 0.69 V (Fig. 9e). Moreover, when assembled into a liquid rechargeable ZAB (Fig. 9f), such bifunctional catalyst endowed the ZAB with a high specific capacity of 751 mA h g−1, a small voltage gap of 0.764 V, and an outstanding cycle stability (960 cycles for 640 h) without obvious voltage decay at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9g). Herein, ZIF-8 can be used as pore-forming agent to construct the porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix, which is conducive to charge transfer in the oxygen catalytic reaction.
(b) Carbon-based metal compounds. 
Transition metal compounds represent a kind of potential alternative to noble metal catalysts due to their low cost, high catalytic activity, and environmental friendliness. MOF-derived transition metal compounds (such as transition metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, and metal phosphides) embedded in porous carbon matrix have also attracted wide attention due to the significantly enhanced catalytic performance and durability caused by a synergistic effect between the metal compounds and porous carbon materials.115–119
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, etc.) derived from MOFs have attracted wide attention as promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs. Firstly, the variable valences and rich structures of TMOs endow them with rich redox electrochemical properties. Secondly, the abundant organic ligands in MOFs enable the uniform dispersion of TMOs in porous carbon matrix during the controlled carbonization process, which can effectively enhance electrical conductivity and stability of catalysts.
Among cobalt oxide materials, Co-based MOFs derived from Co3O4 are deemed to be promising candidates for bifunctional electrode materials owing to their high electrocatalytic activity. For instance, Guan et al. synthesized a novel bifunctional catalyst (denoted as N-Co3O4/CC) composed of hollow Co3O4 nanospheres embedded in N-doped carbon nanowall arrays on carbon cloth by pyrolysis of Co-MOF (Fig. 10a).120 Carbon onion coating restrained the Kirkendall effect to facilitate the transformation of the Co nanoparticles into hollow Co3O4 nanospheres with fine-grained polycrystalline oxide structure, enhancing the bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic properties with a high E1/2 of 0.87 V for ORR (Fig. 10b). When assembled into a solid-state ZAB, it presented high OCP of 1.44 V and high specific capacity of 387.2 mA h g−1, outperforming Pt- and Ir-based devices. In addition, Jiang et al. also synthesized a hybrid (denoted as Co/Co3O4@PGS) comprised of metal Co and spinel Co3O4 nanoparticles embedded into porous graphitized carbon shells through ionic exchange reaction and redox reaction between Co2+ and 2D Zn MOF nanosheets.121 The hybrid catalyst possessed three different phases, i.e., metal, spinel oxide, and carbon, which were interconnected in the whole nanostructure. By constructing a triphase structure of atom trapping defect interfaces and porous graphitized carbon shell, charge transfer and utilization of active sites of the catalysts were significantly facilitated. Therefore, the Co/Co3O4@PGS catalyst exhibited significantly improved bifunctional catalytic activity with a low ΔE of 0.69 V (Fig. 10c). When integrating the hybrid catalyst into the air electrode of rechargeable ZABs, it showed exceptionally high cycle stability without voltage decay over 800 h at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10d). Such unique interface engineering strategy will endow MOF-derived metal oxides with significantly improved bifunctional catalytic activity, excellent conductivity, and high cycle stability.

In addition to Co-MOF, other metal-based MOFs (such as those based on Mn) have also been selected to design carbon encapsulated metal oxide materials as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts. For instance, Lou et al. prepared a bimetal–organic framework (Co/Mn-MIL-100) via a hydrothermal method for the first time.122 Due to the very large difference of reduction potential of cobalt and nickel, the Co/Mn-MIL-100-derived MnO/Co/PGC polyhedrons composed of MnO/Co and porous graphitic carbon possessed abundant MnO/Co heterointerfaces, rather than the conventional bimetal oxides (Fig. 10e). Owing to the formation of desired components and heterostructures, the resultant MnO/Co/PGC exhibited superior bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity with a small ΔE of 0.82 V and long-term durability (over 20000 s). Importantly, homemade ZABs with MnO/Co/PGC as air cathode exhibited excellent battery performance, including a high peak power density of 172 mW cm−2, a specific capacity of 872 mA h g−1 (Fig. 10f), and excellent cycling stability without obvious voltage decay (350 cycles for 116 h) (Fig. 10g), outperforming commercial Pt/C + RuO2-based ZAB. This work highlights the synergism of heterointerfaces in electrocatalysis of oxygen, thus providing a promising way for advanced Zn–air cathode catalysts.
Besides transition metal oxides, other metal compounds, such as metal chalcogenides and metal phosphides, derived from MOFs also exhibit remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity toward ORR and OER, and have emerged as attractive catalyst candidates for ZABs due to their rich catalytic active sites, high electrical conductivity, and good stability.
Transition metal chalcogenides are often formed by the interaction between a metal (such as Fe, Co, Ni) and chalcogen atoms (such as S, Se), forming a unique crystal structure, which is conducive to electron transfer and oxygen adsorption in the oxygen catalytic reaction. Recent studies have demonstrated that MOFs can be considered as promising precursors to synthesize porous carbon-based metal sulfide bifunctional catalysts. For instance, Wang et al. synthesized trimetallic CoNiFe sulfide mesoporous nanospheres (denoted as CoNiFe-S MNs) with uniform morphology by using a trimetallic MOF as precursor and a subsequent thioacetamide anion exchange method (Fig. 11a).123 Due to the synergistic effect of trimetallic ions, the CoNiFe-S MNs exhibited a low E10 of 1.429 V for OER and a low ΔE of 0.71 V between E10 and E1/2. A rechargeable ZAB based on CoNiFe-S MNs also exhibited a remarkable cycle stability (a low voltage gap of 0.76 V at 2 mA cm−2) (Fig. 11b) and high power density of 140 mW cm−2. This method can pave the way for the design of other MOF-derived metal sulfides with improved catalytic activity.

Besides sulfurization, selenization can also be applied to convert these MOF precursors into metal selenide embedded in carbon matrix. For instance, Cao et al. demonstrated in situ coupling of Co0.85Se nanocrystals with N-doped carbon (denoted as Co0.85-Se@NC) by direct selenization of ZIF-67 polyhedron (Fig. 11c).124 Due to the synergism of the coupling between Co0.85Se nanocrystals, N-doped carbon, and the Co–N–C structure, the obtained Co0.85Se@NC catalyst exhibited excellent bifunctional catalytic performance with a small E10 of 1.46 V for OER and a positive E1/2 of 0.814 V for ORR (Fig. 11d). Furthermore, the obtained ZABs with Co0.85Se@NC as air cathode exhibited a high peak power density of 268 mW cm−2 (Fig. 11e), a low voltage gap of 0.80 V and a long cycle life of over 180 cycles. All in all, the work will provide a facile and feasible strategy for the selenization of MOF materials with markedly improved catalytic activity and long-time cycle stability.
Transition metal phosphides coupled with conductive carbon matrix can be acquired using MOFs as templates through phosphorization processes. For instance, Manthiram et al. prepared 1D hybrid catalysts (denoted as CoP@mNSP-C) composed of ultra-small cobalt phosphide nanoparticles embedded into N-, S-, and P-doped carbon supports by combining the MOF-derived conversion approach with an in situ crosslinking method (Fig. 11f).125 In the in situ synthesis process, the 1D cobalt precursor reacted with 2-methylimidazole to form ultra-small ZIF-67 nanocrystals, and the introduced triethylamine was crosslinked with poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS). Due to the high content of CoP in CoP@mNSP-C and very small nanoparticle size, the 1D hybrid catalyst exhibited remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity with a positive E1/2 of 0.90 V (Fig. 11g) for ORR and a low E10 of 1.64 V for OER. Furthermore, the rechargeable ZABs based on CoP@mNSP-C demonstrated a low potential gap of 0.86 V and excellent cyclic stability with negligible voltage change after 100 cycles over 80 h (Fig. 11h). This new method will offer an index for the design of metal phosphide catalysts with remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity and excellent cyclic stability.
To sum up, appropriate metal ions and organic ligands may coordinate with each other to construct crystalline porous MOFs with ordered crystalline porous structures, abundant accessible atomically dispersed metal active sites, and high surface area. Although these merits endow pristine MOFs with high catalytic activity, selectivity and rapid mass transfer, their structural instability in harsh acid/alkali environment and low electric conductivity and the use of high-cost conductive ligands largely limit their practical application in ZABs. To overcome this, controlled chemical/thermal treatment of MOFs has been adopted to prepare porous metal-doped carbon materials with tunable nanostructures and chemical compositions. Those MOF-derived materials combine the advantageous features of MOFs (e.g. porosity/high surface area) and metal-doped carbon (e.g. abundant active metal sites/desirable electrical conductivity), along with high catalytic activity, perfect selectivity, good conductivity, and excellent structural stability. Thus, MOF derivatives provide great opportunities as electrode catalysts for electrochemical energy applications in ZABs. However, high-cost MOF precursors and harsh synthesis conditions restrict the wide application of MOF derivatives in industrial production. In view of this, in order to develop the role of MOF-based materials as promising catalysts for ZABs in industry, it is important to develop more “stable” and “low-cost” MOFs in the future.

4.2 Metal-free-based carbon material
Metal-free-based carbon catalysts with high conductivity and large specific surface area, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), carbon black (CB), graphene oxide (GO) etc., have been proven to be able to facilitate electron transfer and mass diffusion in catalytic processes, displaying significant potential in the field of electrocatalysis.126–128 In order to achieve high catalytic activity, heteroatoms or defects are usually introduced into metal-free-based carbon catalysts to regulate the partial electronic structure and change the charge density distribution of contiguous carbon atoms, thereby increasing catalytic activity. The bifunctional properties of several recently reported metal-free-based oxygen electrocatalysts are shown in Table 3.

4.2.1 Heteroatom-doped carbon materials. 
Heteroatom-doped carbon materials have been developed as high-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for various reactions.129 This is because the introduced heteroatoms (e.g., N, S, O, B, P) can effectively adjust the charge/spin redistribution in sp2 conjugated carbon matrix, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic activity.130–135 Herein, heteroatom-doped carbon materials are mainly divided into three categories: mono-atom doping, dual doping, and multi-doping.
(a) Mono-atom doping. 
Carbon materials doped with a single atom type (N, P, S, or B atoms) have been proven to be potential high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts by generating plentiful active sites in the carbon skeleton and reducing the reaction energy barrier.136–140
N-doped carbon nanomaterials have been generally exploited as metal-free-based bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts. Most methods for foaming porous carbon electrodes from biomass are highly energy ineffective as they require the decomposition of the biomass and its successive reestablishment into powder-like carbon. Therefore, Loh et al. fabricated high-efficiency N-doped hierarchical carbon plates (denoted as N/E-HPC) from natural timber by an enzyme treatment and successive pyrolysis with NH4Cl (Fig. 12a).141 The carbon plate structure was mechanically strong and could support a weight over 650 times its own weight without damage to its pore construction (Fig. 12b). It also exhibited notable electrical conductivity in the perpendicular direction (Fig. 12c). At the best treatment temperature of 900 °C, both pyridinic N sites and graphitic N sites were introduced into the carbon framework with a high density, which endowed the catalyst with excellent ORR and OER performances. A reversible ZAB based on the catalyst also exhibited high peak power density of 192.7 mW cm−2, specific capacity of 801 mA h g−1, and remarkable cycle stability for 110 h (Fig. 12d–f) without any evident performance attenuation. What is more, N/E-HPC-900 could be used immediately as an air cathode in ZABs (Fig. 12g). Hence, the direct conversion of raw wood into nanostructured catalysts is beneficial due to the ease of operation and the high cost-effectiveness of the process as well because the raw hierarchic structure can be easily utilized. Such ORR and OER performances of N/E-HPC-900 are comparable to those of commercial catalysts. Moreover, the N/E-HPC-900-based ZAB has good charging and discharging performance (gap of 0.77 V) and excellent stability.

Electrostatic spinning technology has played a very important role in the construction of one-dimensional nanostructured materials. For instance, Yao et al. developed a straightforward way for the synthesis of porous carbon nanofiber films (denoted as NCNFs) with large specific surface area by pyrolysis of polyimide fiber films (Fig. 12h).142 As shown in Fig. 12i, NCNF-1000 was highly flexible. Moreover, rechargeable liquid ZABs based on NCNF as air cathode also exhibited a small charge–discharge voltage gap of 0.73 V and outstanding stability (500 cycles for 83 h) (Fig. 12j). More importantly, flexible rechargeable ZABs (Fig. 12k) with NCNF also showed a notable mechanical and cyclic stability. These flexible ZABs could be integrated as power supplies into wearable photoelectric devices.
N-doped carbon nanomaterials induced n-type carrier properties and exhibited hypersensitive electronic properties to the air; thus their catalytic mechanism is still controversial. The study of B-doped carbon nanomaterials has been more straightforward than that of N-doped ones due to the low doping concentration. Therefore, the design of B-doped carbon nanomaterials has been deemed as a valid tactic to enhance electrocatalytic activity.46,143–146 For instance, Choi et al. synthesized neoteric carbon-based composites made up of B-doped graphene quantum dots fastened to a graphene hydrogel (denoted as GH-BGQD) by adopting a hydrothermal route.147 The as-prepared GH-BGQD composites exhibited remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for ORR (E1/2 = 0.87 V) and OER (E10 = 1.6 V). The excellent bifunctional performance of GH-BGQD was due to the highly effective active sites of the BGQDs and the 3D construction of GH, which provided an easy approach to catalytic sites as well as high-speed charge and mass transport. A solid-state battery with GH-BGQD2 as air electrode showed an exceptional flexibility and cycling stability (over 15 h at 10 mA cm−2) even when bent at different angles. The introduction of B atoms can enhance the charge carriers due to their lower electronegativity than carbon, and can also promote an efficient chemisorption with the oxygen atoms.
(b) Dual doping. 
Dual doping in a carbon skeleton with two types of heteroatoms can produce a synergistic effect to facilitate catalytic activity, so it is regarded as an increasingly fashionable method to optimize electrocatalytic activity. Various doping foams, especially N connected with other heteroatoms like N–S,148–150 N–B,151 and N–P,152,153 are generally reported. For instance, Dai et al. developed a low-cost approach for synthesis of 3D carbon foams with N and P (denoted as NPMCs) via pyrolysis of polyaniline aerogels.154 The ORR and OER activities of NPMC-1000 are comparable to those of Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. A rechargeable ZAB using NPMC as air electrode also showed notable stability (600 cycles at 2 mA cm−2). Apparently, the N and P dual doping produced a synergistic effect to enhance the catalytic activity for both OER and ORR.
However, until now, the performance of N,O dual-doped carbon nanomaterials for ORR and OER has not been commonly reported. A viable route was developed for the synthesis of N,O dual-doped graphene boxes (denoted NOGB) using polymer-coated Prussian blue as precursor (Fig. 13a and b).155 In addition, introducing oxygen to N-doped graphene could accelerate the formation of carbon positive charge active sites for dramatically promoting the activity in OER. Above all, a rechargeable ZAB based on NOGB-800 displayed a small potential gap of 0.72 V and excellent cycle stability of more than 30 h (Fig. 13c and d). More attractively, two series-connected ZABs could light up three light-emitting diodes (working voltage: 3.0 V) (Fig. 13e), displaying the huge potential for practical application.

In order to promote viability and energy efficiency, some researchers hope to devise metal-free-based catalysts with self-templates. To that end, N,P dual-doped carbon spheres as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts were prepared via an in situ polymerization, followed by carbonization (Fig. 13f).156 Theoretical calculations (Fig. 13g and h) indicated that the exceptional bifunctional activity could be due to the formation of highly porous structure in the carbon spheres with N,P dual doping at edges. Both the ORR and OER performances of NPCS-900 are close to those of commercial catalysts. What is more, ZABs were assembled with NPCS catalysts, which showed outstanding battery performance (Fig. 13i) and cyclic stability (55 h at 2 mA cm−2). This work uncovered the impact of heteroatom doping locations on the catalytic activity for the first time. Therefore, reasonable doping of other heteroatoms (B, S, O, and P) into N-doped carbon materials is an efficient method for optimizing their electronic characters to further improve the catalytic activity.
(c) Multi-doping. 
The single- and dual-doped carbon materials reported in the past always displayed a single ORR or OER catalytic activity, while ternary-doped carbon materials as bifunctional catalysts were not commonly reported.157 For instance, Ma et al. synthesized ternary (N, F and P)-doped carbon materials (denoted as NFPC) by a conventional electrospinning and thermal annealing method (Fig. 14a).158 Due to its good electrical conductivity, high specific surface area with a macroporous construction, and the synergism of doped heteroatoms (N, F and P), the as-prepared NFPC showed considerable bifunctional ORR/OER activity. When assembled into a ZAB, NFPC exhibited a maximal open circuit voltage (1.60 V) for the primary battery (Fig. 14c), showing high potential gap of 0.8 V and poor stability (22 h at 10 mA cm−2). Thus, it was once again proved that the activity of the catalyst was not the only factor determining the performance of ZABs.

Recently, diverse heteroatom-doped carbon materials have been developed using specific tools and toxic precursors. Here, N-, P-, S-doped carbon nanospheres (denoted as NPSCSs) were synthesized through a combination of polymer derivative, template-etching and secondary pyrolysis, which possessed numerous advantages of hollow/mesoporous structure, abundant defects and highly specific surface area.159 The fabrication mechanism of PZS is shown in Fig. 14d. 4,4′-Sulfonyldiphenol (BPS) and cyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) were in situ aggregated on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with the addition of triethylamine. The ORR performance of NPSCSs is close to that of Pt/C, but their OER performance is poor. As shown in Fig. 14e and f, NPSCS-based rechargeable ZABs displayed a high open circuit voltage (1.579 V), a high potential gap of 1.453 V and decent cycling stability (45 h).
Besides N,F,S tri-doped carbon material, Ma et al. synthesized N,F,B tri-doped carbon fibers as oxygen electrocatalysts (Fig. 14g).160 Heteroatom doping improved the electronic structure of the carbon fibers and led to further active sites. The ORR and OER performance of the TD-CFs is worse than that of commercial Pt/C and RuO2. What is more, when assembled into a primary or rechargeable ZAB, the TD-CF catalyst showed inferior battery performance with a higher voltage gap than Pt/C-RuO2 (Fig. 14h) and poor stability (13 h). Moreover, it is difficult to synchronously achieve multi-heteroatom doping since particular atom doping requires special equipment or methods.


4.2.2 Defects in carbon materials. 
In carbon materials like graphene, the sp2 carbon atoms are arrayed in a hexagonal lattice. However, defects induced by heteroatom doping cannot be avoided in practice. Different constructions of the carbon atoms in the defects can change the spin or charge distribution of the sp2 carbon plane. Hence, the effective adjustment of defects in carbon materials is a valid way to adjust electrocatalytic properties.161,162 For instance, Li et al. proposed a unique gas-foaming method for the manufacture of nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as NCN-1000-5) via pyrolysis and introduced abundant defects and plentiful micropores into the NCNs.163 DFT calculations (Fig. 15a) indicated that the carbon atoms situated at the armchair edge acted as more active sites for the ORR and OER. The ORR performance of NCN-1000-5 is comparable to that of Pt/C, and its OER performance is close to that of RuO2. Due to the very good activity, a rechargeable ZAB (Fig. 15b) using NCN-1000-5 as the cathode catalyst displayed a low voltage gap of 0.77 V and exceptional durability (1000 cycles for 330 h at 10 mA cm−2). The activity and stability of the NCN-1000-5-based ZABs are some of the best for reported non-metallic catalysts. This work puts forward an original and general approach to synthesize progressive carbon materials with abundant defects.

For practical ZABs, the active electrocatalysts are always required to be loaded onto a conductive matrix to promote mass and charge transport. But this process requires one to employ extra binding annexing agents, which is not only intricate, but also leads to high internal resistance. In order to solve this problem, Huang et al. successfully developed a defect-enriched carbon nanomaterial (denoted as DN-CP@G) with novel core–shell architecture by in situ stripping of graphene, followed by high-temperature treatment.164 The graphene shell had abundant defect sites, which primarily contributed to produce more high-efficiency active sites for catalytic reactions (Fig. 15c). Thus, the material not only showed an excellent bifunctional performance, but also possessed long-term cycle stability (250 cycles at 5 mA cm−2) in practical ZABs (Fig. 15d). In view of this, in order to achieve the best catalytic activity, it is highly advisable to generate plenty of defect sites.
Furthermore, increasing the number of oxygen-enriched vacancies could also accelerate the ORR process. For instance, Yan et al. designedly introduced oxygen vacancies into carbon material (denoted as O-NGM-800), and the resultant material possessed excellent oxygen reaction activity (Fig. 15e).165 In addition, for the first time, in situ XRD test was performed to give an immediate survey of the oxygen reaction catalyzed via vacancy-oxidized material during ZAB operation. The ORR performance of O-NGM-800 is similar to that of Pt/C, but the OER performance is poor. The significant change of the peak testified to oxygen vacancies in the catalyst promoting the adsorption of intermediates, thereby promoting the oxygen reaction. Rechargeable ZABs with the O-NGM-800 catalyst as air cathode exhibited high power density (186.3 mW cm−2) (Fig. 15f) and stable cyclic performance (500 cycles for 80 h at 25 mA cm−2), and reversibility was confirmed via in situ Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 15g).
Therefore, a lot of researches have shown that metal-free carbon materials usually have excellent ORR activity, conductivity, selectivity, environmental friendliness and low cost, but their bifunctional ORR/OER activity is relatively poor mainly because of inferior OER catalytic activity. The improvement of bifunctional ORR and OER activity of carbon materials is not only due to the doping of heteroatoms, but also to the influence of defects. In metal-free-based carbon materials, it is difficult to prepare catalysts with only one specific type of active center. In most cases, there are abundant active sites in one catalyst with high activity. Therefore, in order to obtain better bifunctional activity, it is necessary to adopt a reasonable design method to prepare bifunctional metal-free carbon catalysts with abundant and high-efficiency active centers. Moreover, another critical issue is carbon corrosion during charging that results in a gradual performance decay mainly because of the lack of stable metal active sites. Since catalyst activity and stability are the key factors to determine ZAB performance, how to improve the “activity” and “stability” of metal-free carbon catalysts simultaneously is still an important challenge in the future.

4.3 Metal-based catalysts
A variety of 3d transition metal (Ni, Co, Fe) and carbon-rich source (melamine, glucose, urea, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.)-derived metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts have been reported as alternative candidates to noble metal catalysts due to variable valences, excellent catalytic activity, good stability, low cost, abundant resources and environmental friendliness.166–168 Metal-based materials are mainly introduced from two aspects: metal–nitrogen–carbon materials and metal compounds. The bifunctional properties of several recently reported metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts are shown in Table 4.

4.3.1 Metal–nitrogen–carbon materials. 
Metal–nitrogen-doped carbon materials (M–N–C) composed of M–Nx moieties, especially Fe/Co–Nx–C moieties, embedded in carbon matrix have attracted much attention due to their low cost and high intrinsic catalytic activity. The coordination between metal and nitrogen in carbon matrix can effectively regulate the local electronic structure, thereby reducing the adsorption energy of intermediate species, thus leading to a superior bifunctional ORR/OER activity.169,170
Single-atom M–N–C materials with their atomically distributed metal active sites and high atom utilization efficiency usually exhibit remarkable catalytic performances in oxygen catalytic reactions. For instance, Xie et al. reported a single-atom catalyst of Fe–Nx species on N and S co-decorated hierarchical carbon layers (denoted as S,N-Fe/N/C-CNT) obtained by pyrolysis of CNTs, 2,2-bipyridine and Fe salt precursor under N2 atmosphere, followed by acid leaching (Fig. 16a).171 Benefiting from the abundant atomically dispersed Fe–Nx sites, 3D conductive networks to accelerate electron transfer, and unique hierarchical structure to increase the exposure of active sites, the as-prepared S,N-Fe/N/C-CNT showed superior ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity with a low ΔE value of 0.75 V. When assembled into a rechargeable ZAB with S,N-Fe/N/C-CNT as air cathode, it exhibited excellent cycle stability with no obvious voltage change after 100 cycles (Fig. 16b). Thus, designing an atomic dispersion of catalytic active sites is a promising method to synthesize high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts.

Besides single-atom Fe–N–C catalysts, Cao et al. reported a single-atom Co–N–C catalyst (denoted as CoN4/NG) with atomically dispersed CoN4 moieties on a nitrogen-doped graphitic nanosheet obtained by a surfactant-assisted approach.172 The EXAFS curve and corresponding Fourier transform of CoN4/NG exhibited a similar peak at about 1.6 Å to that of a Co phthalocyanine sample, suggesting the possibility of Co–N4 sites. Thus, the CoN4/NG catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a low ΔE of 0.74 V, which is better than that of most reported bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, a CoN4/NG-based liquid ZAB displayed a superior battery performance with a large peak power density of 115 mW cm−2, low voltage gap of only 0.84 V and good durability of over 100 h at 10 mA cm−2. This work not only provides a general surfactant-assistant method to in situ synthesize single-atom catalysts, but also opens up a new avenue for application in wearable ZABs.
Besides single metal–Nx active sites, bimetal–Nx active sites also exhibit excellent ORR/OER catalytic performance due to the synergism of bimetallic single-atom components. For instance, Thomas et al. synthesized a bimetallic meso-/micro-FeCo–Nx–CN using active metal salts and SiO2 nanoparticles as templates (Fig. 16c).173 The resultant meso-/micro-FeCo–Nx–CN possessed a unique 2D morphology, highly dispersed metal atoms, and hierarchical meso-/microporous structure (Fig. 16d–f), showing high and reversible ORR/OER catalytic activity with ΔE of only 0.78 V (Fig. 16g). Additionally, when assembled into a rechargeable ZAB, it showed a high peak power density of 150 mW cm−2 and a good cycling stability of over 40 h at 10 mA cm−2. Thus, this work opens up a new way for the preparation of 2D meso-/microporous carbon architectures and scale-up production in rechargeable ZABs.
Compared to single atoms, metal alloys embedded into carbon matrix also exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity owing to the intrinsic polarity between two different metals, which can significantly promote catalytic reactions.174–178 For instance, Yang et al. demonstrated the concept of an apical dominance mechanism, which aimed to improve the catalytic activity of NCNT by encapsulating CoNi alloy nanoparticles in the NCNT apex on Ni foam (denoted as CoNi@NCNT/NF) (Fig. 16h).179 As shown in Fig. 16i, the resultant CoNi@NCNT/NF exhibited an excellent ORR/OER catalytic performance with ΔE of only 0.78 V compared to single NCNT, which can be attributed to the apically dominant CoNi NPs embedded into the tip of NCNT arrays. A ZAB using CoNi@NCNT/NF catalyst as an air electrode exhibited excellent battery performance with a peak power density of 127 mW cm−2, a high energy density of 845 W h kgZn−1, and excellent durability of over 90 h (Fig. 16j). The apical dominance design is applied to the preparation of NCNT arrays, which will pave the way for the rational design of advanced bifunctional electrodes in renewable energy systems.
Besides CoNi alloy embedded in carbon matrix, Cao et al. for the first time successfully synthesized FeNi alloy embedded into N-doped porous carbon layers (denoted as FeNi-NC) by using abundantly available and low-cost peanut shells as carbon source and small amounts of iron and nickel salts as metal source.180 Results indicated that the as-prepared FeNi-NC catalyst exhibited excellent bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity with a small ΔE value of 0.81 V. When assembled into a ZAB with FeNi-NC catalyst as air cathode, it showed long-term cycle stability with no obvious potential changes after 23 h. Thus, this work provides a facile method to transform waste peanut shells into valuable non-noble M–N–C materials as high-efficiency bifunctional oxygen catalysts for rechargeable ZABs.


4.3.2 Metal compound materials. 
As promising non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER, low-cost transition metal (e.g., Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, and Cu) compound materials including metal oxides, chalcogenides, sulfides, phosphides, and hydroxides have attracted wide attention of researchers. The developments of transition metal compound electrocatalysts are summarized in detail as follows.
(a) Metal oxides. 
Transition metal oxides, including single metal oxides (Mn, Co, Ni, etc.),181–185 spinel oxides186–191 and perovskite oxides,192,193 have been considered as attractive candidates for bifunctional oxygen catalysts because of their various oxidation states, structural diversity, and low cost.
Single metal oxides. 
Manganese oxides (MnOx) have been considered as attractive candidates for both ORR and OER due to rich oxidation states and crystal phases, low toxicity, and low cost. Among them, manganese dioxide (MnO2) is the most frequently studied class of manganese oxides, and its bifunctional activity largely depends on the crystal phases. For instance, Meng et al. discovered that the catalytic activity of MnO2 catalysts for both OER and ORR was highly dependent on the crystal structure (α-, β-, δ-MnO2, and amorphous MnO2), and their ORR and OER activities both follow the order of α-MnO2 > amorphous-MnO2 > β-MnO2 > δ-MnO2 (Fig. 17a).194

Cobalt oxides (CoOx) are also investigated as promising candidates for ZABs in view of their variable valence and high catalytic activity. For instance, Xie et al. synthesized 1 nm ultrathin cobalt oxide (CoOx) layers on a metallic Co/N-doped graphene substrate (Co/N-RGO) by pyrolysis of a mixture of Co2+, 1,10-phenanthroline, and graphene oxide.195 Studies demonstrated that coupling the 1 nm CoOx layers with a highly conductive Co/N-RGO substrate could effectively accelerate electron transfer and provide rich active sites, thus improving the conductivity and catalytic activity (Fig. 17b). The as-obtained catalyst could achieve superior bifunctional activity with a positive E1/2 of 0.896 V for ORR (Fig. 17c) and a low E10 of 1.6 V. A flexible ZAB using Co/N-RGO catalyst as air cathode demonstrated an ultra-high specific power of 300 W gcat−1 (Fig. 17d). Thus, this work offers a new design strategy for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts in portable energy conversion systems.
Doping a second metal in a single metal oxide is also an effective strategy to increase intrinsic activity of oxygen catalysts. For instance, Gao et al. reported porous Co-doped NiO nanoflowers (denoted as Co-NiO NFs) with a regular 2D hexagonal framework and abundant nanopores in the nanosheets obtained by a simple solvothermal method.196 As shown in Fig. 17e and f, compared with pristine NiO with a band gap of 3.1 eV, the DOS diagram of Co-NiO revealed a metal-like nature with a larger electron occupied state at the Fermi level, corroborating that Co doping could effectively increase the conductivity and the intrinsic activity of pristine NiO NFs. Thus, the as-prepared Co-NiO NFs demonstrated outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward both ORR and OER with a low ΔE of 0.74 V, superior to that of the pristine NiO electrocatalyst (Fig. 17g). Notably, liquid ZABs with Co-NiO NFs electrode exhibited a satisfactory specific capacity of 830 mA h g−1 and excellent cycle stability of over 110 h (Fig. 17h).
Spinel oxides. 
Spinel oxides with a formula of AxB3−xO4 have attracted extensive attention for the ORR and OER, because the presence of multiple valence states of the same cation can provide donor–acceptor chemisorption sites to reversibly adsorb oxygen, which is conducive to the bifunctional behavior of electrodes towards the OER and ORR.197,198 In the spinel structure, there are two kinds of metal sites, such as tetrahedral sites and octahedral sites, as illustrated in Fig. 18a.199 Based on theoretical prediction, the volcano plots of the ORR and OER activity are shown in Fig. 18b and c.199 In addition, according to the composition of spinel oxide catalysts, single (A3O4) and binary (AxB3−xO4) types of catalysts are discussed in the following sections.

A3O4-type spinel metal oxides, such as Co3O4, with structure of Co2+Co23+O4, in which Co2+ and Co3+ ions occupy tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, have been considered as potential bifunctional oxygen catalysts owing to the advantages of low cost, multiple valence states, and considerable stability. For instance, Ma et al. synthesized a series of surface-controllable Co3O4 nanocrystals, including nanocube (NC), nanotruncated octahedron (NTO), and nanopolyhedron (NP), which were anchored on N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) by a facile hydrothermal method.200 The as-prepared Co3O4 NC, NTO, and NP nanostructures were mainly enclosed by (001), (001) + (111), and (112) crystal planes, which exposed different surface atomic configurations, including Co2+ and Co3+ active sites. Electrochemical and theoretical calculation results indicated exposed Co3+ active sites in octahedral interstices (Co3+Oh) on (112) facet (Fig. 18d), and the strong coupling interaction between Co3O4 and N-rGO in Co3O4-NP/N-rGO was conducive to the adsorption–desorption and activation of oxygen species, thus promoting the electrocatalytic activity in ORR and OER (Fig. 18e). Simultaneously, ZABs based on Co3O4-NP/N-rGO also exhibited large peak power density (118 mW cm−2), low voltage gap (0.76 V), and ultra-long-term stability (150 cycles for 16 h) (Fig. 18f). This work paves the way to obtain highly active electrocatalysts by regulating the surface atomic configuration and catalytic active sites for practical green energy devices.
AxB3−xO4-type binary metal oxides (such as CuCo2O4, NiFe2O4, NiCo2O4, MnCo2O4, etc.) coupled with N-doped carbon material have been widely employed in ORR and OER as well as in ZABs.201–203 For instance, Jiang et al. synthesized spinel NixCo(3−x)O4 anchored on aminated carbon nanotubes (denoted as NixCo(3−x)O4/NH2-CNTs) through a cation exchange reaction.204 Specifically, the Co3O4/NH2-CNTs was first obtained and then transformed into NixCo(3−x)O4/NH2-CNTs via a solvothermal reaction in the presence of nickel ions (Fig. 18g). Thus, the electrocatalytic activities of spinel bimetallic oxides can be improved by the strong electronic coupling with carbon nanomaterials. By comparing the catalytic properties of NixCo(3−x)O4/NH2 carbon nanotubes with Co3O4/NH2 carbon nanotubes, it can be concluded that the bimetallic structure played an important role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activity. In view of this, NixCo(3−x)O4/NH2-CNTs exhibited notable bifunctional catalytic activity for the OER and ORR with a low ΔE of 0.764 V between E10 and E−3 (Fig. 18h). Most interestingly, ZABs with NixCo(3−x)O4/NH2-CNTs as air cathode could deliver a higher peak power density of 168 mW cm−2 than a ZAB with Pt-RuO2/C (Fig. 18i).
Perovskite oxides. 
Perovskite oxides have a formula of ABO3, which contain BO6 octahedra with A+ cations inserted in the framework. The larger A-site cation is usually a rare earth or alkali metal, which is the reason for the thermal resistance of a catalyst, and the smaller B-site cation is usually a transition metal, which mainly contributes to the ORR/OER activity.205,206 The molecular-orbital approach reveals that the ORR and OER activity of perovskite oxides is decided by the σ*-orbital (eg) occupation and covalency of B-site metal–oxygen.207 A moderate eg-filling (∼1) in perovskite oxides produces higher ORR/OER activity, as compared to other perovskite oxides with either too much or too little eg-filling.208
Coupling perovskite oxides with N-doped carbon materials is also an effective strategy for designing promising bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts. For instance, Chen et al. proposed a unique core-corona bifunctional catalyst (denoted as CCBC) that consisted of highly OER-active LiNiO3 as the core anchored on highly ORR-active N-doped carbon nanotubes.209 LaNiO3, among the top OER catalysis materials in perovskite oxide materials, not only participated in the formation of OER active core (Fig. 19a), but also served as a support material for the synthesis of NCNTs by simple chemical vapor deposition. In addition, after degradation testing (FDT), CCBC-2 still retained excellent stability, exhibiting 3 and 13 times higher current density for ORR and OER than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 19b and c). The coupling effect arising from the core-corona structure provides the key to bifunctional OER/ORR activity of the catalyst.

In addition, besides the design of LiNiO3 coupled with N-CNT, Kim et al. fabricated a new catalyst (denoted as P-3G) composed of a cation-ordered perovskite (PrBa0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (PBSCF) and 3D porous N-doped graphene (3DNG).210 On the one hand, DFT calculations suggested that the enhanced activity of 3DNG in ORR is mainly due to the electron transfer to the π* orbital of O2 assisted by PBSCF (Fig. 19d). On the other hand, electron transfer from 3DNG to PBSCF enhanced the covalency between metal and lattice oxygen, thereby improving the catalytic activity of PBSCF in OER (Fig. 19d). The ORR activity of P-3G (E1/2 = 0.82 V) was far superior to that of P-HF or 3DNG and near to that of Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.85 V) (Fig. 19e). ZABs with P-3G electrodes exhibited a low operating voltage gap of 0.63 V after 110 cycles due to the superior catalytic activity and good stability (Fig. 19f).
Furthermore, the catalytic activity can also be improved by adjusting the phase structure of perovskite oxides. For instance, Cho et al. synthesized a series of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF5582)-based materials with high activity as advanced bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts and studied the effect of heat treatment of BSCF5582 in oxygen at 950 °C as a function of annealing time on its catalytic performance.211 It was found that oxygenation proceeded upon the heat treatment in oxygen, which improved the crystallinity of the whole cubic perovskite structure, and simultaneously the spinel phase of nanoscale-thick surface layer between amorphous layer (ca. 30 nm) and cubic perovskite particle was removed (Fig. 19g), which contributed to significantly improving the catalytic activity of the BSCF5582-based catalyst (Fig. 19h). Furthermore, a ZAB with O2-5582-48 h as air cathode exhibited a small-value difference (Fig. 19i), which indicated that it would be a promising candidate for a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a ZAB. Such strategy of controlling structure and surface chemistry by monitoring defect chemistry through heat treatment is expected to play a role in the application of electrocatalysts.
(b) Other metal compounds. 
Besides metal oxides, other transition metal compounds have also been studied as bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts, such as metal chalcogenides,212–214 phosphides,215–217 hydroxides,218,219etc.
Metal chalcogenides. 
Transition metal chalcogenides have attracted great attention due to the enhanced electrocatalytic properties, particularly Earth-rich 3d metal (Co, Ni, Mn, etc.) chalcogenides.220–222 As promising and stable electrocatalysts for OER and ORR, transition metal chalcogenides have seen remarkable progress. For instance, Chen et al. developed a “ship in a bottle” design of fine CoS2 nanoparticles embedded in defective carbon pores (denoted as CoS2/SKJ) via thermal sulfurization (Fig. 20a).223 Benefiting from the synergism between the constructed 3D porous conductive architecture, the defect-rich interfaces (S-doped pores), and high-efficiency catalytic active sites (C–S–C bonding and CoS2), the as-prepared CoS2/SKJ catalyst exhibited superior bifunctional catalytic activity with a ΔE of 0.74 V and excellent stable cyclability of over 340 h at 25 mA cm−2 (Fig. 20b). Such universal “ship in a bottle” design will offer an instructive model for nanomaterial engineering to construct bifunctional catalysts with high catalytic activity in green energy fields. In addition, Wang et al. reported a novel bifunctional catalyst of Co9S8/CNT by utilizing an advanced atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique for coating a uniform ultrathin active Co9S8 layer on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold.224 Due to the large surface area of the CNT scaffold and the advantages of ALD for film coating, the as-prepared Co9S8/CNT catalyst displayed excellent catalytic activity, with a fairly high E1/2 of 0.82 V for ORR and a low E10 of 1.59 V for OER. Rechargeable ZABs with Co9S8/CNT as air cathode exhibited long-term cyclability of over 576 cycles for 96 h. Thus, the combination of Co-based sulfides with conductive carbon materials could significantly improve catalyst activity and durability.

Ternary thiospinels (AB2S4) have attracted increasing attention recently as bifunctional oxygen catalysts. Within the ternary thiospinels, two metal cations (A2+ and B3+) occupy the octahedral and tetrahedral positions of a close-packed S-anion lattice, respectively.225,226 For instance, Yu et al. designed a new bifunctional hybrid catalyst of urchin-like NiCo2S4 microspheres embedded in S-doped graphene nanosheets (denoted as S-GNS/NiCo2S4) by a sulfurization process.227 Due to the change of the spin density between carbon atom and adjacent heteroatom caused by the S doping, the resultant S-GNS/NiCo2S4 exhibited excellent bifunctional catalytic activity with a low ΔE of only 0.69 V (Fig. 20c). Additionally, rechargeable ZABs based on S-GNS/NiCo2S4 also showed a maximum power density of 216.3 mW cm−2 (Fig. 20d) and excellent stability without obvious decay after 100 h. Such design of urchin-like structure and S doping could drastically enhance the surface exposure of active sites, generating abundant mass and charge transport pathways, along with an increase of conductivity and cycling stability.
Metal phosphides. 
Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are also considered as promising candidates for noble metal catalysts due to their excellent electrocatalytic properties. TMPs exhibit significant OER activity in alkaline media.228,229 In addition, by integrating TMPs with N-doped carbon material, TMPs/carbon-based electrocatalysts also exhibit high ORR activity.230,231 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop TMPs/carbon-based bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts as air cathodes in rechargeable ZABs. For instance, Song et al. reported defective carbon-CoP nanoparticle hybrids (denoted as CoP-DC) as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts obtained through a simple phosphorization reaction using a Co2+-containing polymer hydrogel (Fig. 20e).232 By combining experiments and theoretical DFT calculations, it was found that the interface charge redistribution occurred at the interface between CoP and defective carbon, while the holes gathered on the surface of CoP due to the strong interface coupling, which subsequently contributed to enhanced ORR activity for the DC and enhanced OER activity for the CoP. Notably, as shown in Fig. 20f, a low bifunctional oxygen electrode activity (ΔE = 0.76 V) of CoP-DC was obtained, indicating the key role of interfacial charge redistribution. This work systematically reveals the promoting factor of hybrids from the point of view of interfacial charge redistribution.
Besides cobalt phosphide, Shen et al. facilely prepared large-sized Fe2P/N-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (denoted as CNS-900).233 DFT calculations indicated that the adsorption energies of ORR intermediates on Fe–N could be boosted by coupling with Fe–P. Due to the co-existence of Fe–N active sites, Fe–P active sites, high N content, and the nanosheet structure, the as-prepared CNS-900 exhibited a superior ORR/OER performance with a low ΔE value of 0.79 V. Further to this, when assembled into a ZAB with CNS-900 as an air cathode, it exhibited good round-trip efficiency of 49% and excellent cycling stability (375 cycles for 125 h). Such P,N co-doped carbon matrix endowed the metal phosphide with abundant catalytic sites and a stable nanostructure, thereby improving the remarkable electrocatalytic performance and excellent cycling stability.
Metal hydroxides. 
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), [M1−x2+Mx3+(OH)2][An−]x/n·zH2O, have been considered as effective OER catalytic materials owing to the good intrinsic catalytic activity.234,235 However, the poor ORR performance of LDH-based electrocatalysts limits their application as bifunctional catalysts in rechargeable ZABs.
To ensure LDH-based electrocatalysts maintain better ORR performance with a first-class OER performance, some research has been devoted to the integration of LDH with N-doped carbon materials, which can provide a promising way to further improve electrocatalytic performances.236 For instance, Chen et al. reported the growth of NiFe LDH nanodots (ca. 3 nm) with high loading (47 wt%) on N-doped 3D graphene-like macro-/mesoporous carbon (denoted as nNiFe LDH/3D MPC).237 Studies demonstrated the defect-rich mesopores on the 3D-MPC wall provided abundant adsorption sites for the instant nucleation of precursor cations, and as a size-restricted reactor, it played a key role in the high-load and size-limited growth of NiFe LDH. The results showed that the particle size of NiFe LDH can be adjusted by changing the number of carbon defects, and more defects could lead to a smaller particle size. Due to the intimate interface coupling of NiFe LDH with N-doped carbon, the nNiFe LDH/3D MPC catalyst resulted in an excellent bifunctional ORR/OER activity with a small ΔE of 0.71 V (Fig. 20g). More importantly, as shown in Fig. 20h, when assembled into two ZABs in a series connection with nNiFe LDH/3D MPC as air cathode, a group of LED indicators (≈3 V) could be successfully powered, indicating promising application and feasibility.
Besides binary NiFe LDH, Duan et al. also prepared an array-like colloid composite of NiCoIIIFe-LDH/N-GO by an in situ growth route, which consists of ternary NiCoFe LDH (denoted as NiCoIIIFe-LDH) with Co3+ grafted on N-doped graphene oxide (N-GO).238 By exposing more Ni and Fe active sites and introducing high-valence Co3+, the as-prepared NiCoIIIFe-LDH/N-GO exhibited excellent bifunctional catalytic performance with a low ΔE of 0.769 V toward OER and ORR. Thus, this work once again proves that the coupling of LDH with N-doped carbon materials can significantly enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward ORR and OER, which opens a new way for the design of bifunctional catalysts and the commercialization of ZABs.
Based on the above discussion, although metal-based catalysts (such as M–N–C, metal oxides, chalcogenides and phosphates, and LDHs) possess the advantages of abundant metal active sites, low-cost raw materials and environmental friendliness, their poor electrical conductivity and serious aggregation of nanoparticles seriously limit their catalytic activity. Therefore, in order to promote the role of metal-based materials as promising catalysts for ZABs, it is important to more efficiently utilize catalytic sites in the future. Thus, it is believed that metal-based catalysts have great potential to replace precious metals in rechargeable ZABs.

5. Conclusions and outlook
In conclusion, this review highlights recent research progress in the development of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts as air cathodes for ZABs. The pros and cons (in terms of activity, stability, conductivity, selectivity, low cost and environmental friendliness) of the introduced pristine MOFs, MOF-derived catalysts, metal-free carbon catalysts, precious metal catalysts, and non-precious metal catalysts for ZABs are summarized in Fig. 21. The main goal of the research highlighted is the design of bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with high activity, high selectivity, good conductivity, low cost and durability to replace noble metal catalysts for rechargeable ZAB applications to utilize energy in an economic and effective way. In this review, three types of non-noble metal bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts are introduced, namely MOF-based catalysts, metal-free-based carbon catalysts, and metal-based catalysts. In view of that, these three types of non-noble metal bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts have their own advantages and disadvantages.
 Fig. 21  The pros and cons (in terms of activity, stability, conductivity, selectivity, low cost and environmental friendliness) of the introduced catalysts for ZABs (the more external the better; the more internal the poorer). 
As for MOF-based catalysts, they include pristine MOFs and their derivatives. Firstly, the construction of 2D π-conjugated conductive MOFs with faster electron transfer and ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets with coordinated unsaturated metal sites opens up a promising way for the direct utilization of pristine MOFs as pyrolysis-free catalysts. Secondly, compared with the traditional non-porous noble metal catalysts, MOF-derived 3D hierarchical porous carbon matrix possesses good conductivity to enable rapid electron and mass transfer, and atomically dispersed metal active sites in MOFs can lead to the homogeneous dispersion of single atoms, metals, or metal compounds in porous carbon matrix. Therefore, MOFs and their derivatives with numerous advantages of large specific surface areas, porosity, easy doping of heteroatoms, generous metal active sites, and controllable size/morphology/composition will be most promising candidates for precious metal catalysts in ORR and OER. Although MOF-based catalysts have the above advantages, the most pristine MOFs are limited by the disadvantages of high cost, complex synthesis conditions, low conductivity, and structural instability. Thus, the key of development of MOF-based catalysts should be committed to the design and construct of “stable” and “low-cost” MOF precursors.
In terms of metal-free-based carbon catalysts, they include heteroatom-doped carbon and defective carbon. Heteroatom doping (N, O, S, B, or P) and defect control (vacancy and edge) within the structure can effectively improve the catalytic activity by regulating the electronic structure. In addition, the hierarchical pores and large specific surface area of carbon-based materials can increase the exposure of active centers, and promote the diffusion of oxygen and reactants. Due to their high conductivity, the metal-free-based carbon materials could provide more charge transport channels during electrocatalytic oxygen reactions. Significantly, heteroatom doping can greatly boost the ORR activity leading to a favorable formation of OH−via the four-electron pathway, in particular, for various N-doped carbon materials. However, the dissatisfactory bifunctional ORR/OER property of carbon nanomaterials may restrict their practical application in ZABs, because the unavoidable carbon corrosion under the high oxidation potentials of the OER may cause catalyst agglomeration. Besides, carbon nanomaterials can also be easily fabricated into various nanostructures, and thus are generally considered ideal conductive supports for metals, metal oxides, and other metal compounds for efficient oxygen catalysis.
As for metal-based catalysts, they include metal–nitrogen–carbon materials and metal-based compounds, which are considered as effective candidates as alternatives to noble metal catalysts due to low cost, easy preparation, wide availability, and multiple valence states. Generally, their catalytic activity can be regulated by changing their morphology, structure, crystal phase, and valence state. However, the poor electrical conductivity and aggregation of nanoparticles seriously limit further practical application as bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts in ZABs. To overcome that, the effective combination of metal active species and low-cost carbon nanomaterials (e.g., CNT and graphene) has been proven to be a promising strategy to achieve the resultant hybrids with high electrocatalytic activity, rapid electron transfer rate, high selectivity and satisfactory stability. Moreover, in order to improve the utilization of active sites without agglomeration of nanoparticles, such strategies as core–shell design, space confinement and hierarchical structures can be adopted to uniformly load metal catalytic active sites on functionalized carbon supports with strong coupling synergetic effect, which may effectively solve the problems of low electrical conductivity and agglomeration of nanoparticles.
To sum up, practical high-efficiency catalysts should combine the advantages of MOF-based catalysts, metal-free carbon materials, and metal-based catalysts. However, the practical application of bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts in ZABs is heavily hampered by their disadvantages. Thus, we hope the following outlook will be helpful to the future design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs:
(i) Activity of electrocatalysts
Most of the catalysts have the disadvantages of low and unifunctional catalytic activity. To improve the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, the following strategies can be adopted: (a) Morphology engineering: the engineering of 3D architectures (e.g. hollow structure, core–shell structure etc.) is the key to increasing mass transfer efficiency, because it not only exposes rich and easily accessed metal active sites, but also leads to more 3D channels for electron transfer. (b) Heteroatom doping and vacancy engineering: heteroatom doping (N, O, S, B, P and metal atoms) and defect control (vacancy and edge) within a carbon structure can effectively enhance the catalytic activity by modifying the local electronic structure. (c) Single-atom engineering: maximizing the atom-utilization efficiency by designing single-atom catalysts on conductive carbon matrix, thus further improving the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts. d. Hybridization engineering strategies: the coupling of metal/metal compounds with conductive carbon nanomaterials (e.g., N-doped CNTs, graphene, and conductive carbon black) has been widely introduced to improve electrical conductivity, thereby increasing the electrocatalytic activity. Due to the synergistic effects between the two components, hybrid catalysts often exhibit higher catalytic activity and improved durability compared to the components used alone.
(ii) Durability of electrocatalysts
Another challenge for catalysts is to enhance the electrochemical durability and lifetime. Generally, under high oxidation potential during the charging process, the corrosion of catalysts is unavoidable, which will result in reduced performance and low stability. To solve this problem, the direct growth of highly active catalysts on highly corrosion-resistant conductive substrates (e.g., highly graphitized carbon materials, carbon cloth, nickel foam, etc.) can be considered as an efficient strategy to inhibit the cycle corrosion effect of high-efficiency air electrodes.
(iii) Large-scale production of electrocatalysts
The large-scale production of low-cost and high-efficiency catalyst is of great significance for practical applications or industrial production. However, the high cost of ligands, rigorous synthesis process, and the few synthetic methods have severely impeded the development process from basic research to commercialization. Thus, new synthetic methods, such as electrospinning, spray drying, and template sacrifice methods, are needed to achieve precise control and mass production of electrocatalysts.
(iv) In situ characterization
Further identification of the nature of the active sites is of great significance for the design of efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, due to the lack of abundant theoretical prediction and in situ characterizations, the mechanism of ORR and OER based on bifunctional electrocatalysts is still not very clear. Therefore, it is crucial that the development of in situ characterization techniques can provide real-time insights to monitor the complex reaction processes of oxygen catalysis. In addition, in combination with theoretical modelling and DFT computations, such characterization can help to reveal the reactivity of oxygen catalysts at the atomic level, guiding the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts.
(v) Solid-state ZABs
In the near future, the development of portable/flexible ZABs which can be applied to wearable cell phones, human-like electronic skins and intelligent bracelets represents a very promising direction. However, the traditional designs of ZABs are flat, rigid and stack designs with aqueous alkaline electrolytes, which do not meet the requirements of portable/flexible applications. Therefore, in future research, the main challenge is how to fabricate solid-state or quasi-solid-state polymer-based electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and good mechanical strength.
Overall, the development of high-efficiency and durable bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts as air cathodes is an important and challenging topic in the field of energy storage and conversion. We hope this review will offer some useful enlightenment for the design and construction of air electrodes for ZABs in the future. No doubt the rapid development of high-efficiency and low-cost bifunctional oxygen catalysts will greatly accelerate the commercialization of rechargeable ZABs.
