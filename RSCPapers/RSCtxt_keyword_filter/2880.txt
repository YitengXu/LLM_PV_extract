N,N′-Bis((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine based four-coordinated d10 transition metal complexes (named ML, M = Zn, Cd, Hg) were synthesized and employed as co-sensitizers and co-adsorbents in combination with a ruthenium complex N719 in dye sensitized solar cells. After co-sensitization, not only the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency is enhanced but also the dark current is reduced. A short circuit current density of 14.46 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.74 V and a fill factor of 0.62 corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.65% under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation were achieved when ZnL was used as a co-sensitizer, which are much higher than that for DSSCs only sensitized by N719 (5.22%) under the same conditions. The improvement in efficiency is attributed to the fact that N,N′-bis((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine coordinated complexes overcome the deficiency of N719 absorption in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum, prevent its aggregation, offset competitive visible light absorption of I3− and reduce charge recombination due to formation of an effective cover layer of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. As a result, the synthesized complexes are promising candidates as co-adsorbents and co-sensitizers for highly efficient DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Since O'Regan and Grätzel first reported dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991, DSSCs have drawn the attention of many researchers due to their ability to convert sunlight to electricity at moderate efficiencies with low cost fabrication techniques compared with conventional silicon solar cells.1–3 However, much improvement in efficiency is desired for these devices before they could take the place of the Si based solar cells. Recently, several strategies have been utilized to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, among which co-sensitization is an effective approach to enhance the device performance through a combination of two or more dyes sensitized on the same semiconductor film together, extending the light-harvesting spectrum so as to increase the photocurrents of the devices. For example, the record high performance (12.3%) of co-sensitized DSSCs was reported by Grätzel et al. using a metal-containing porphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8) and an organic dye (Y123) together with a Co(II/III)-based redox electrolyte.4 Nazeeruddin et al. employed different NIR dyes (TT1 and SQ1) as the co-sensitizers of JK2,5,6 and an efficiency of over 7% was achieved. Chen and Dehghani co-sensitized porphyrin dyes with others respectively, resulting in an enhanced efficiency which was higher than individual dye sensitized solar cells.7,8 Co-sensitization of TiO2 films with black dyes and organic dyes (D131 or Y1) significantly enhanced the photocurrent and the device performance attained η = 11.0–11.1%.9–12 Ruthenium dyes such as N719 co-sensitized with organic dyes also showed an enhanced device performance compared to single N719 sensitized solar cells.13–15 And co-sensitization of two metal-free organic sensitizers has also resulted in a higher efficiency than single DSSCs.16–18 Most of these studies mainly concentrated on the selection of sensitizer combinations aiming at maximizing spectral compensation, which is an effective approach to enhance the light-harvesting properties of DSSCs. However, the competitive light absorption of triiodide,19,20 aggregation of dyes21–23 and recombination of charge24 are also the main factors affecting the performance of DSSCs.25 Therefore, synthesis of a co-sensitizer or co-adsorbent, which could not only compensate the absorption spectra but also overcome the competitive light absorption by I−/I3−, avoid dye aggregation and reduce charge recombination, is meaningful to enhance the performance of DSSCs by co-sensitization.
In the previous work of our group, metal–organic complexes including d10 transition metal complexes were introduced into the DSSC system as co-sensitizers.26–28 It has been found that d10 transition metal complexes with pyridine-type ligands lead to a significant increase in overall conversion efficiency of DSSCs by co-sensitization with N719. In this work, in order to overcome the competitive light absorption by I−/I3− in the DSSC system sensitized by N719, another pyridine-containing ligand N,N′-bis((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine is selected to synthesize a series of new d10 transition metal complexes (ML, M = Zn, Cd, Hg) as co-sensitizers of N719, respectively. All of these co-sensitized devices exhibited enhancements of the photovoltaic performance both in Jsc and Voc. The prepared complexes can be used as co-sensitizers and co-adsorbents to absorb light in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum, overcome the competitive light absorption by I−/I3−, avoid dye aggregation and reduce charge recombination. These synthesized Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) d10 transition metal complexes do help in improving the device performance.
2. Experimental section
2.1. The synthesis of ZnL, CdL and HgL
All reagents were commercially available and used with further purification. The N,N′-bis((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine based d10 transition metal complex of ZnL was synthesized according to the following method: 6-methoxypyridine-2-carbaldehyde (40 mmol, 3.80 mL) was added to a mixture of 1,4-phenylenediimine (20 mmol, 2.16 g) and ethanol (70 mL). The mixture was heated and refluxed for 6 h, then cooled down and the yellow powder of N,N′-bis((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine was filtered out, washed with ether and recrystallized with hexane. Then the obtained yellow needle like crystal sample (0.1 mmol, 0.0358 g) was dissolved in 25 mL of CH2Cl2 and a solution of zinc chloride (0.2 mmol, 0.0272 g of ZnCl2 in 10 mL of methanol) was added at room temperature and then heated and refluxed for 6 h. After cooling and removal of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in acetonitrile (30 mL), refluxed for another 3 h at 85 °C, then filtered into a beaker flask, volatilized for about 6 h, and a desired rhombus crystal was obtained.

The synthesis procedure of CdL and HgL was the same as that for ZnL except that ZnCl2 was replaced by CdCl2 (0.2 mmol, 0.0456 g) and HgCl2 (0.2 mmol, 0.0544 g), respectively. The synthesis of complexes ZnL, CdL and HgL is summarized in Scheme 1.

2.2. Assembly of DSSCs
The FTO conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, sheet resistance 15 Ω per square, transmission 90% in the visible) was purchased from NSG, Japan, and cleaned by a standard procedure. N719 [cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium] was purchased from Solaronix Company, Switzerland. Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using the following procedure. The TiO2 paste was cast onto the FTO substrate by the screen-printing method, followed by drying at 100 °C for 5 min and this process was repeated six times, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 15 min in air to obtain a transparent TiO2 photoelectrode with the thickness of ca. 10 μm. The co-sensitized electrodes were prepared by immersing the obtained mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode in 0.3 mM ZnL, CdL or HgL solution in absolute ethanol for 2 h and washing with ethanol and drying with a blower, then further immersing the electrodes in a 0.3 mM N719 solution in absolute ethanol for 12 h, and then washing with ethanol and drying with a blower again. The single N719 sensitized electrodes were prepared by only immersing the TiO2 photoelectrode in a 0.3 mM N719 solution in absolute ethanol for 14 h. The electrolyte used in this work was 0.5 M LiI + 0.05 M I2 + 0.1 M tert-butyl pyridine in a 1:1 (volume ratio) of acetonitrile–propylene carbonate. The platinum counter electrode was prepared by depositing H2PtCl6 paste onto the FTO glass substrates and then sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The cells were assembled by sandwiching the electrolyte between the dye sensitized photoanode and the counter electrode and the assembly was held together using mini-binder clips.
2.3. Instrumentation and measurements
UV-visible absorption spectra in ethanol solution were recorded on a model SPECORD S600 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Jena, Germany), and absorption spectra of TiO2 films were recorded on a model UV-2250 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Fluorescence properties of the synthesized complexes were obtained using an FLS920 spectrometer (Edinburgh) equipped with a peltier-cooled R928 photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu). A Xe900 450 W xenon arc lamp was used as the exciting light source. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660d, Chenhua, Shanghai) using a three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode in saturated KCl solution. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, Fluka, electrochemical grade) in ethanol as the solvent. Photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) curves were recorded on the Keithley model 2400 digital source meter using a mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm−2. The irradiance of AM 1.5 global sunlight from a filtered 500 W xenon lamp light source was set at 100 mW cm−2 and was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell (No. NIMMS1123, calibrated at the National Institute of Metrology, P. R. China). Based on the I–V curve, the fill factor (FF) is defined as: FF = (Jmax × Vmax)/(Jsc × Voc), where Jmax and Vmax are the photocurrent density and photovoltage for the maximum power output; Jsc and Voc are the short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit photovoltage, respectively. The overall energy conversion efficiency η is defined as: η = (FF × Jsc × Voc)/Pin where Pin is the power of the incident light. The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on an EQE/IPCE spectral response system (Newport). The surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS) instrument was assembled by Jilin University, in which monochromatic light was obtained by passing light from a 500 W xenon lamp through a double-prism monochromator (SBP300, China), and the signals were collected by a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using the CHI660D Electrochemical Analyzer (Chenhua, China), and the measurements were taken over a frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation or in the dark by applying a forward bias of −0.75 V. 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer using Si(CH3)4 as an internal standard at room temperature. Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained using KBr pellets on a Nicolet Avatar-360 Infrared spectrometer in the 4000–100 cm−1 region. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 element analyzer. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for ML were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID IP diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å), operating at 293 ± 2 K. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares based on F2 using the SHELXTL 5.1 software package (Sheldrick G M. SHELXTL NT Crystal Structure Analysis Package [CP] version 5.10; Bruker AXS, Analytical X-ray System: Madison, WI, 1999). The hydrogen atoms residing on the carbon atoms were located geometrically. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and structures of ZnL, CdL and HgL
The synthetic routes and molecular structures of ZnL, CdL and HgL are depicted in Scheme 1. All of the three complexes were obtained in good yields (ca. 75–78%) as air stable yellowish solids. And all the complexes were characterized by 1H NMR, UV-vis, and IR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. Molecular structures of ZnL and HgL were further determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, but a suitable single crystal of CdL was not obtained.

The X-ray structural analysis of the single-crystals reveals that ZnL and HgL are isostructural. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis also reveals that the complexes of ZnL and HgL crystallize in the triclinic system, P space group. The complex of ML (M = Zn, Hg) has 20 non-hydrogen atoms in the asymmetric unit, which contain one M2+ cation, one ligand (N-((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine, half-hydrolyzed from N,N′-bis((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine) and one acetonitrile molecule with all in general positions (Fig. 1). The center metal M2+ is four-coordinated: one pyridine N atom, one imino N atom and two chlorine atoms, and displays a slightly distorted tetrahedron arrangement (Fig. 1). For ZnL, the bond angles of N–Zn–N and Cl–Zn–Cl are 81.39(15)° and 113.43(6)°, respectively; the dihedral angle of the benzene ring and the pyridine ring is 5.77°, which is almost coplanar due to coordination with Zn2+; the Zn–N bond has an average bond length of 2.074 Å and the imino CN bond has typical double-bond characteristics, with a bond length of 1.287(6) Å. For HgL, the bond angles of N–Hg–N and Cl–Hg–Cl are 73.00(30)° and 111.06(12)°, respectively; the dihedral angle is 4.11°; the average Hg–N bond length is 2.323 Å and the imino CN bond with a bond length of 1.265(12) Å also has typical double-bond characteristics.

A 3-D supramolecular structure of HgL is obtained by π–π stacking interactions (π–π stacking interactions of 3.5 Å) and hydrogen bonding interactions (see Fig. 2). As for ZnL, it is similar to HgL.

3.2. Optical properties of ZnL, CdL and HgL
The absorption spectra of the prepared complexes and N719 in ethanol solutions are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 4. In the UV-vis spectra, the complexes of ZnL, CdL and HgL exhibit two major prominent bands. The first one at ca. 280–325 nm is attributed to localized aromatic π–π* transitions, and the other one at ca. 325–700 nm, 325–675 nm and 325–525 nm for ZnL, CdL and HgL, respectively, is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption. Compared with the absorption spectra of N719, apparently, the absorption spectra of ZnL, CdL and HgL could compensate for that of N719 in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum.

The molar extinction coefficients in the visible region are 32571 M−1 cm−1 for ZnL, 29860 M−1 cm−1 for CdL and 28353 M−1 cm−1 for HgL. All of these are much higher than that of the ruthenium complex N719.29 A higher molar extinction coefficient around 365–367 nm indicates that the ZnL, CdL, and HgL possess a higher light harvesting ability in this wavelength region compared with N719 and I3− (25000 M−1 cm−1).30 Hence it can be predicted that the photon lost due to the light absorption by I3− will be suppressed by the use of ZnL, CdL or HgL as a co-sensitizer and co-adsorbent due to the competition between ZnL, CdL or HgL and I3− to absorb light.
The absorption spectra of ZnL/N719, CdL/N719 and HgL/N719 co-sensitized TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, the absorption of N719 on TiO2 films in the visible light region is remarkably broadened and its peak at 475 nm in ethanol solutions is red-shifted to 555 nm. This could be ascribed to the aggregation31 or electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface.32 The interaction between the carboxyl group and the surface Ti4+ ions may lead to increased delocalization of the π* orbital of the conjugated framework. The energy of the π* level is decreased by this delocalization, resulting in the red shift of the absorption spectra.
 Fig. 4  UV-visible absorption spectra of ZnL, CdL, HgL and N719 on TiO2 films. 
In comparison with the absorption of N719 on the TiO2 film, the absorption peaks for ZnL/N719, CdL/N719 and HgL/N719 on the TiO2 film are blue-shifted by 23, 43 and 62 nm, respectively, displaying the bands at 532, 512 and 493 nm. This indicated that when ZnL, CdL or HgL is used as a co-sensitizer and co-adsorbent, the aggregation of N719 is alleviated and the new interactions between dye–dye and dye–TiO2 are introduced, leading to a blue-shift in the absorption of N719 on the TiO2 film. Furthermore, the absorption on the co-sensitized film is enhanced remarkably when ZnL, CdL or HgL was introduced, especially in the region of 320–550 nm. This is consistent with the result that the absorption spectra of ZnL, CdL and HgL could compensate for that of N719 in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum based on the spectra shown in Fig. 3.
The emission spectra of ZnL, CdL and HgL are illustrated in Fig. 5. All of them exhibit strong luminescence in the region of wavelengths 350–750 nm, and it is worth noting that all of the emission spectra of ZnL, CdL and HgL overlap with the excitation spectra of N719 inordinately. This indicates that N719 could synchronously accept the energy from the incident light and the excited ML, which will broaden the spectral response of N719 in the region of 350–750 nm.

3.3. Electrochemical properties of ZnL, CdL and HgL
Energy-level matching is crucial in selecting the sensitizer. In order to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ZnL, CdL and HgL, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode cell on an electrochemical workstation. The experimental data for electrochemical properties of ML are summarized in Table 4. As estimated from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra, the excitation transition energy values (E0–0) of ZnL, CdL and HgL are 2.90, 2.89 and 2.92 eV, respectively. Consequently, the HOMO values of ZnL, CdL and HgL are calculated based on their first redox potentials as −5.09, −5.01 and −5.06 eV, respectively, and the LUMO levels of ZnL, CdL and HgL calculated from EHOMO + E0–0, are −2.19, −2.12 and −2.14 eV, respectively.33 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ZnL, CdL and HgL are shown in Scheme 2. It shows that the energy levels of ZnL, CdL and HgL are appropriate for the DSSC system containing TiO2. The LUMO levels lay above the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.40 eV vs. vacuum), indicating efficient electron injection, and the HOMO energy levels lay below that of the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum) which is further improved negatively by about 0.3 V by adding additives such as 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) to the I−/I3− redox electrolyte,34 providing sufficient driving force for dye regeneration.35

3.4. Photovoltage properties of DSSCs
ZnL, CdL and HgL were employed as co-sensitizers and co-adsorbents to fabricate ML/N719 photoanodes. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSC devices based on N719, ZnL/N719, CdL/N719 and HgL/N719 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding cells performances are summarized in Table 5. Upon co-sensitization, the performances of cells are all improved. The values of Jsc, Voc and η are improved in the order of ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719, respectively. The ZnL/N719 device yields a Jsc of 14.46 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.74 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.62 and a η of 6.65%. All the parameters are significantly higher than that of the device only sensitized by N719.

The IPCE spectra were collected in order to interpret the enhancement of Jsc (Fig. 7). The DSSCs containing only the N719 dye show a broad IPCE spectrum from 300–750 nm but a decrease in the wavelength range of 340–450 nm, which is due to the competitive light absorption between I3− and N719. When ML is used as a co-sensitizer and co-adsorbent, this decrease is restored in the order of ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719, which is attributed to the fact that the ML complexes are attached to the TiO2 surface effectively and contributed to the electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2. This means that the co-sensitization of N719 and ML has a significant synergy and compensatory effect on light harvesting and electron collection in TiO2. Based on the IPCE and the absorption spectra, the cell's higher Jsc in the case of co-sensitization is ascribed to better light harvesting in the low wavelength region, where the absorption of N719 is compensated and the competitive light absorption of I3− is overcome.

To further investigate the enhanced performance of DSSCs, the surface photovoltages of DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes were investigated, which is a well-established contactless technique for surface state distribution.36,37 The curves in Fig. 8 indicate that co-sensitization could result in stronger photovoltage signals between 300 and 750 nm, especially in the region of 300–450 nm. The photovoltage signals increased in the order of ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719, which indicates that the separation efficiency of electrons and holes correlates strongly with ZnL, CdL and HgL, and the enhancement of the photovoltage signals in the region of 300–450 nm is attributed to the overcoming of the competitive light absorption of I3− and compensation of N719 absorption; besides, the enhancement of the photovoltage signals in the region of 300–700 nm may also be attributed to the reduction of N719 aggregation and the interaction of ML and N719, which further support the results from IPCE.

The dark current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs based on the ML/N719 and N719 dyes are shown in Fig. 9, which indicates the recombination of injected electrons with I3−. It shows that the dark current is lower for the co-sensitized system compared with that of single N719 sensitized DSSCs, which is in the order of ZnL/N719 < CdL/N719 < HgL/N719. This could be explained as follows: as shown in absorption spectra, co-sensitization of N719 with ML on the TiO2 film produces a blue shift, indicating that the N719 molecules orientate themselves in a more parallel conformation, leaving space for the ML co-sensitizer. The interaction with each other forms a dense packing of dyes on the TiO2 electrode or an insulating layer composed of ML and N719, which could effectively suppress charge recombination and thereby enhance Voc. It is noted that the Voc value is in the opposite order with the dark current, that is ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719 > N719. When ML was used as a co-sensitizer and co-adsorbent, the Jsc and Voc were all enhanced, both of which lead to the improvement of η. The improved Jsc and Voc with the unpronounced difference in FF make it obtain higher η, which is on the same order as Jsc and Voc.

When the crystal structures of the complexes are taken into account, it is found that the enhancement of the co-sensitized DSSC performance compared with that of single N719 sensitized DSSCs may be due to the key structural feature of the complex. In the complex, the center metal chelates with two N electron donors of the ligand and form a five membered ring which is adjacent to the pyridine ring. The five membered ring, pyridine ring and benzene ring are almost coplanar; thereby the rigidity to the molecular structure is increased. The good co-planarity and rigidity mean easier electron transfer and are favorable for electrochemical properties. Furthermore, the complexes ML extend as supermolecules through hydrogen bonding and π–π interactions, which make the electron-donating ability of ML better when they are used in DSSCs as a co-sensitizer. All of these structural features of ML result in obtaining higher performance of co-sensitized cells than that of cells sensitized by single N719. Meanwhile, it is noted that the DSSC performance is gradually enhanced in the order of HgL < CdL < ZnL. To some extent, this difference observed in the DSSC performance likely has its origin including the metal ion in the unit cell and the steric proximity of ligand L. For HgL, the larger atom radius of Hg likely increases the Hg–N average bond length, which is 2.323 Å (the average Zn–N bond length is 2.074 Å), and the narrow angle formed by the chelating L in HgL, N1–Hg–N2, is 73.00°, which is significantly smaller than that in ZnL (the bond angle of N1–Zn–N2 is 81.39°). In this case, the distance between M to electron donating group N is increased. Also, it is worthwhile to note that the distance between the benzene ring and a five membered ring including M is increased, from ZnL to HgL, namely, the bond length C8–N2 is 1.41 Å in HgL, which is longer than the corresponding value in ZnL (the bond length C8–N2 is 1.40 Å in ZnL). This is probably caused by the steric hindrance. Apparently, the increased distance is not good for electron transfer. Therefore, the performance of the co-sensitized cell is in the order of ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719.
3.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies of DSSCs
EIS is a powerful technique for the analysis of interfacial electronic and ionic transport processes in an electrochemical device.38,39 It is a steady state method to measure the current response based on application of an ac voltage at different frequencies. Herein, we utilized EIS to analyze charge carrier dynamics in the interfacial regions of solid–liquid layers. The Nyquist plots of EIS for DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes measured under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation and in the dark by applying a forward bias of −0.75 V are illustrated in Fig. 10. Only two semicircles were observed for DSSCs in our experiments, which is different from what is reported in the literature that three semicircles should be observed in the frequency range of 0.1 to 10 kHz in the Nyquist plots. This can be explained as the conventional diffusion resistance of the redox couple is greatly overlapped by the charge transfer resistance due to the short diffusion length of I− ions available with the thin spacer and the low viscosity of the solvents used in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 10  Nyquist plots of EIS for DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes measured under standard AM 1.5 G solar irradiation (a) or in the dark (b) at forward bias −0.75 V. 
Under light illumination, EIS was utilized to analyze the charge transport resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface for its significance in the efficiency of DSSCs.40–42 As shown in Fig. 10a, the two semicircles located in high and middle frequency regions (left to right) are attributed to the electrochemical reaction at the Pt/electrolyte interface and the charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.43–45 The radius of the large semicircle located in middle frequency regions in the Nyquist plots decreases after co-sensitization with ML, and the values are in the order of ZnL/N719 < CdL/N719 < HgL/N719 < N719, which indicates a decrease of the electron transfer impedance (Rct) and an increase of charge transfer rate at this interface after co-sensitization.
Under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 10b, the two semicircles located in high, middle and low frequency regions (left to right) of Nyquist plots are attributed to the redox reaction at the Pt counter electrode and the electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.43–46 Therefore the larger semicircle observed in the middle frequency region represents the resistance of the charge transfer from the TiO2 to the electrolyte (back recombination resistance Rrec). The radius of this semicircle increases after co-sensitization with ML, indicating an increase of Rrec. A large Rrec means a small charge recombination rate and vice versa. The radius of the semicircle observed in the middle frequency range lies in the order of ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719 > N719, indicating the sequence of Rrec at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The increased value of Rrec for DSSCs implies the retardation of the charge recombination between injected electrons and I−3 ions in the electrolyte, with a consequent increase of Voc. This appears to be consistent with the larger Voc value sequence.
Also, a suggested impedance model by Bisquert is used to fit curves in the middle frequency region of Nyquist plots using the Z-view software.38Rct and Rrec at the TiO2 surface were deduced by this method and are listed in Table 6. The values of Rct are in the order of ZnL/N719 < CdL/N719 < HgL/N719 < N719 and those of Rrec are in the order of ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719 > N719. These again confirm the analysis above that after co-sensitization with ML, the charge transfer rate increased and the charge recombination rate decreased, both of which are favorable for enhancing the performance of DSSCs.

According to the EIS analysis, the charge recombination resistance is larger and the charge transport resistance is smaller for the DSSCs based on ML/N719 than that for the DSSCs based on N719, indicating that co-sensitization has effectively modified the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and increased the Jsc and the Voc. In the co-sensitized system, a better dye coverage helps to passivate the TiO2 surface or form an insulating molecular layer composed of ML and N719 molecules and thus reduces the recombination due to electron back-transfer between TiO2 and I3−, which ultimately increases the Voc compared with those of individual sensitized devices.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the newly synthesized d10 coordinate complexes based on the N,N′-bis((6-methoxylpyridin-2-yl)methylene)-p-phenylenediimine ligand have a significant effect on the performance of DSSCs when they were used as co-sensitizers and co-adsorbents; it could improve both Jsc and Voc. The co-sensitized devices exhibit an enhanced performance in the order of ZnL/N719 > CdL/N719 > HgL/N719, and all of them are higher than that of single N719 sensitized solar cells. The ZnL/N719 co-sensitized device yields the best overall efficiency of 6.65%, which is greater than that of the device containing only N719 (5.22%). Jsc is enhanced because of the combined light harvesting of N719 and the synthesized complex with complementary absorption spectra, reduction of dye aggregation, offsetting of the competitive light absorption of I−/I3− and favorable energy alignments, while Voc is enhanced because of the retarded charge recombination due to a better dye coverage on the TiO2 surface or formation of an insulating molecular layer composed of ML and N719 molecules which suppress the recombination of the injected electrons with I3− ions.
Moreover, these devices are made without scattering layers, TiCl4 treatment, or antireflecting coatings, but with less internal area than fully optimized TiO2 electrodes and the performance is competitive with solar cells made from the single ruthenium complex N719, reaching up to 6.65% under similar conditions. The high efficiency and simple fabrication suggests very bright application prospects for this method in large-scale production of DSSCs.
