    , Accepted 15th June 2015First published on 3rd July 2015AbstractA lead-free low bandgap organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, formamidinium tin iodide, is utilized as a light absorbing layer in photovoltaics. This material has a bandgap of 1.41 eV which allows light harvesting from the near infrared region, making high photocurrents achievable. A power conversion efficiency of 2.10% was accomplished upon incorporating SnF2.
The power conversion efficiency of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells has increased dramatically from 6.5% in 2011 to 19.3% in 2014, which makes them potentially competitive with currently available thin film and polycrystalline silicon devices.1–7 Organometal trihalide perovskite absorbers are solution processable, highly crystalline at low temperature, and exhibit ideal solar cell material characteristics,8 such as high optical absorption,1 long-range charge transport, low trap densities and efficient charge collection at the contacts.9–11 Although the efficiency of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have shown rapid improvement within the last year, issues related to toxicity and stability remain major bottlenecks for commercialization. Toxicity has been tackled by the development of a mixed divalent metal perovskite (CH3NH3SnxPb1−xI3)12,13 into pure tin analogues such as CH3NH3SnI3 and CsSnI3, which have shown promising light harvesting capabilities.14–16 However, the issue of temperature stability seems to be linked to the organic cation utilized in perovskites. CH3NH3PbI3 has been reported to undergo a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic phase at 56 °C17 – a temperature which would be achieved under practical operating conditions for a solar cell. Substituting the CH3NH3+ ion with HC(NH2)2+ yields HC(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite which is a semiconductor with an attractive bandgap (1.48 eV) and impressive efficiency (∼15%). Compared to CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+ possesses higher temperature stability as has been highlighted in the black polymorph of HC(NH2)2PbI3.18 The higher stability of the HC(NH2)2+ analogue could arise due to a more rigid perovskite structure from the enhanced hydrogen bonding between HC(NH2)2+ cations and the inorganic matrix.19 Very importantly, this halide does not undergo any phase transitions up to a temperature of 150 °C, indicating that this perovskite would be a much more stable alternative than the commonly explored CH3NH3PbI3.18,20–22
Herein, we report the utilization of a lead-free perovskite material with a low Eg, formamidinium tin iodide (HC(NH2)2SnI3 – FASnI3), as a light absorber in solar cell applications. FASnI3 was synthesized by reacting stoichiometric amounts of formamidinium iodide (FAI) and SnI2 (see ESI†). Fig. 1(a) shows the Tauc plot of our FASnI3 showing an energy band gap of 1.41 eV. The Eg of FASnI3 is smaller than those of conventional perovskite light absorbers CH3NH3PbI3 (1.5 eV) and FAPbI3 (1.47 eV).2,20 The absorption onset is thus red-shifted from 800 nm in CH3NH3PbI3 to 880 nm in FASnI3. This extended absorption window would permit a maximum photocurrent density of approximately 30 mA cm−2 for FASnI3.23,24 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of pure FASnI3 deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 layer is depicted in Fig. 1(b). According to these XRD data, FASnI3 has an orthorhombic (Amm2) crystal structure with the unit cell dimensions of a = 6.3096(15), b = 8.9298(21) and c = 9.0622(35).

Unlike the analogous lead compound FAPbI3 possessing two polymorphs (black and yellow) in which the presence of the non-perovskite yellow polymorph restricts the photovoltaic performance of the device,20,25,26 the XRD peaks of the samples prepared by annealing our tin perovskite film at three different temperatures (100 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C) indicate that only a single phase exists in FASnI3 over this temperature range (see Fig. S1†). This is further confirmed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in which no phase transition was observed during the heating and cooling cycles (Fig. S2(a)†). Therefore, FASnI3 perovskite films for device testing were only annealed at 100 °C to avoid any potential degradation occurring during device fabrication. The FASnI3 powder for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was obtained by drop-casting FASnI3 solution onto a glass substrate and drying the resulting deposit on a hot plate (Fig. S2(b)†). Due to the use of the high boiling point solvent, the first weight loss at around 150 °C is attributed to the trapped solvent inside the sample powder. The second weight loss at around 250 °C was taken to indicate the initial decomposition of FASnI3; this value matches a previously reported decomposition temperature for this material.25 The sample exhibits another weight loss at around 350 °C when the sample becomes fully decomposed. To fully understand the exact decomposition mechanism of this material, further analysis needs to be conducted.
In our previous studies,16 the introduction of SnF2 into perovskite CsSnI3 was found to reduce the background carrier density, leading to a dramatic improvement in the photovoltaic performance. Similarly, we also investigated the effects of adding SnF2 to FASnI3. As shown in Fig. 1(b), addition of 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol% or 40 mol% of SnF2 into FASnI3 does not give rise to any new peaks in the respective XRD patterns and the lattice parameters are consistent for all samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data for FASnI3 and FASnI3:20%SnF2 are depicted in Fig. 1(c). The presence of fluoride is clearly detectable in the FASnI3:20%SnF2 sample, but not in the pure FASnI3 sample. The XPS data also revealed the presence of only Sn2+ in the sample and no Sn4+ signal is observed. Thus, all tin perovskite samples are in the unoxidised Sn2+ state, which should enhance their performance in devices. An important observation made was that the colour of the FASnI3 solution changed (from yellow to orange) when left overnight. The addition of SnF2 (10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol% or 40 mol%) to the FASnI3 solution increased the stability, as the colour of the mixed solutions remained yellow even if they were kept overnight (or even longer). XPS analysis was performed for the pure FASnI3 and FASnI3 with 20% SnF2 films deposited from solutions stored overnight (see Fig. S3†). It clearly indicates that the addition of SnF2 delays the oxidation of Sn2+ while a significant Sn4+ signal was found in pure FASnI3.
Top view SEM images were taken to ascertain the changes in the surface morphology of the perovskite films on mesoporous TiO2 upon adding SnF2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), pure FASnI3 exhibits very poor coverage over TiO2. A lot of exposed TiO2 surface can be clearly seen, which could lead to poor device performance due to recombination at the hole transport layer–TiO2 interface. Upon adding 10 mol% of SnF2, the coverage of this perovskite material on mesoporous TiO2 is significantly improved, while addition of 20 mol% of SnF2 produces the best coverage over the mesoporous TiO2 layer with no bare TiO2 surface visible (see ESI Fig. S4(d)†). However, when the SnF2 concentration is increased to 30 mol% or 40 mol%, nanoplatelet-like structures (Fig. 2(c)) are observed on the perovskite surface. It can be seen that there is a bare TiO2 surface underlying this nanoplatelet structure (Fig. S4(e)†) which would again reduce the performance of the resulting photovoltaic devices.

FASnI3 was tested as the light absorber in photovoltaic devices with the following configuration: FTO/TiO2 blocking layer/mesoporous TiO2/FASnI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 2(d)). The pure FASnI3 does not perform well in photovoltaic devices, yielding efficiencies of less than 0.02% with low photocurrent density and photovoltage.16 In contrast, the addition of 10 mol% and 20 mol% of SnF2 into FASnI3 leads to a drastic increase in photocurrent density from 2.14 mA cm−2 to 9.25 mA cm−2 and 12.4 mA cm—2, respectively. Further increase in the SnF2 concentration did not produce higher power conversion efficiencies, but instead when the concentration of SnF2 was increased to 30% and 40%, the power conversion efficiency dropped, primarily due to the decrease in the photocurrent density. This can be rationalized as arising from the optimum perovskite film formation occurring with 20 mol% added SnF2 where a more homogenous and continuous film is obtained as compared to that obtained by adding higher amounts of SnF2. Varying the concentration of SnF2 has shown a great impact in all photovoltaic parameters. As shown in Fig. S5,† the optimum performance was obtained with a concentration of SnF2 of 20 mol%, yielding average values of 12.4 mA cm−2 for Jsc, 262 mV for Voc, 0.44 for FF and 1.41% for overall PCE.
These device configurations were analysed by studying the band energies of the pure and mixed perovskite layers as determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The UPS spectra of pure FASnI3 and FASnI3 with 20% SnF2 addition are given in Fig. 3(a). In the pure FASnI3 sample, two onsets of binding energy are observed at 0.26 eV and 1.5 eV, corresponding to the binding energy values of, respectively, 4.72 eV and 5.96 eV with respect to the vacuum level. The lower binding energy is possibly due to an interfacial state which could trap holes or electrons with a detrimental effect to the efficiency of the devices using pure FASnI3. Upon adding 20 mol% of SnF2 into the perovskite film, the interfacial state is suppressed and only one binding energy is observed at 5.92 eV with respect to the vacuum level. The valence band maximum (VBM) of FASnI3 was not significantly affected by the addition of SnF2, while the interfacial state was suppressed, leading to better photovoltaic performance. The schematic energy diagram of the FASnI3 based device is shown in Fig. 3(b). The conduction band of FASnI3 is calculated to be 4.55 eV by subtracting its optical band gap of 1.41 eV from the valence band energy estimated from UPS. Remarkably, our results seem to indicate that the conduction band level of FASnI3 lies below that of TiO2 (conduction band at 4.0 eV, see Fig. S6†), making charge injection unfavorable. The lower conduction band of FASnI3 points to the possibility of the band bending at the interface between the TiO2 and the perovskite which facilitates electron injection during photoexcitation. However, detailed photophysical studies will be needed to further elucidate matters.

It is well-known that the dependence of J–V characteristics on light intensity (I) can provide useful information on the order of the recombination loss and distinguish the dominant carrier loss mechanism in the device.27–29Fig. 4(c) shows the relationship between the Voc and light intensity. The slope of the plot of Voc against light intensity is found to be 0.051 which is equal to 1.97kBT/q (close to 2kBT/q), indicating that the trap assisted recombination process is dominant. This result is similar to that seen in CsSnI3 solar cells.16 Photocurrent density vs. light intensity measurements yielded a non-linear relationship (J ∝ I0.8). Generally, the non-linear relationship of Jsc with light intensity indicates space-charge limited effects due to unbalanced hole and electron mobility. However, in our case, the non-linearity found in FASnI3 might be due to the existence of energy barriers at the TiO2–FASnI3 interface which prevents efficient electron injection.

The key factor behind the high efficiencies noted in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells has been the long balanced carrier collection length and high absorption coefficient, both of which promote high efficiencies.9 However, a previous report had noted that the diffusion lengths within FAPbI3 are lower than those of MAPbI3 with electron diffusion lengths being much shorter than hole diffusion lengths.21 Additionally, diffusion lengths in tin perovskites have been revealed to be much shorter than those of the corresponding lead perovskite.15 These considerations indicate that the FASnI3 would benefit from being infiltrated within the electron transporting mesoporous TiO2 layer. The formation of photogenerated electrons close to the perovskite–mesoporous TiO2 interface becomes crucial in order to minimise the amount of recombination and therefore improve electron extraction. Since the FASnI3 perovskite solution can easily penetrate into the mesoporous TiO2, the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer can be increased in order to avoid the formation of a capping layer of the perovskite film. The cross-sectional SEM images of the devices fabricated using different thicknesses of mesoporous TiO2 (350 nm, 450 nm and 500 nm thickness) are illustrated in Fig. S7.† The capping layer of FASnI3 on top of mesoporous TiO2 is reduced as the thickness of the TiO2 film is increased. On a 350 nm TiO2 film, the capping layer was found to be approximately 620 nm thick which became reduced to a thickness of about 350 nm on a 450 nm TiO2 film. Although the thickness of mesoporous TiO2 was increased by 100 nm, the excellent pore filling of the FASnI3 solution ensures complete coverage of the TiO2. From Fig. 4 it can be seen that the overall efficiency is improved from 1.71% to 1.93% by changing the TiO2 thickness from 350 nm to 450 nm, which is mainly due to the improvement in photocurrent density. As the capping layer of FASnI3 is reduced, recombination occurring in the bulk capping layer is reduced while charge injection into and collection by TiO2 is also improved. When the TiO2 thickness was further increased to 500 nm, no obvious capping layer can be observed in the cross-sectional SEM image, indicating that all the perovskite solution had infiltrated into the mesoporous layer during fabrication and that the perovskite has formed solely inside the mesoporous layer upon heating the substrate. The highest power conversion efficiency was attained using a 500 nm TiO2 film with a Jsc of 24.45 mA cm−2, a Voc of 238 mV and a fill factor of 0.36, yielding an overall PCE of 2.10%. The photovoltaic parameters of devices using these three TiO2 thicknesses are shown in Fig. S8.† The plot of incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of FASnI3 with 20 mol% SnF2 indicates photocurrent generation from ∼900 nm (Fig. S9†). We have also investigated the effect of scanning directions in this Sn-based perovskite solar cell; no hysteresis is observed when the I–V curves are measured in forward (Jsc → Voc) and reverse (Voc → Jsc) directions, see Fig. S10 in the ESI.†
To summarize, formamidinium lead iodide (FASnI3) has been demonstrated to be an alternative lead-free material for solid-state organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells. Its low Eg of 1.41 eV, which is close to the optimum band gap for single-junction solar cells, ensures that it has a large absorption window capable of harvesting photons almost up to 900 nm. The excellent pore filling of this tin-based perovskite allows the utilization of a thicker mesoporous TiO2 film which generally leads to higher light harvesting capability and subsequently reduces the possibility of charge recombination which might originate from the probable short charge diffusion length in the material. Further device optimization, e.g. by surface passivation or modifying deposition techniques, will be investigated in order to improve the overall power conversion efficiency, particularly its low photovoltage and fill factor.
