    , Accepted 14th April 2022First published on 9th May 2022AbstractNickel–zinc iron oxide (NZF) was introduced into a polyaniline (PANI) matrix by an in situ chemical oxidation polymerization approach. The surface composition and chemical states were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which revealed an Fe 2p spectrum with the two peak positions of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 at 711.00 and 724.48 eV, respectively. Deconvolution of the Fe 2p3/2 peak revealed two components with binding energies of 713.98 and 718.16 eV, corresponding to the presence of Fe cations in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Additionally, the Rietveld refinement of NZF showed a cubic system with the Fd3m space group. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis showed that the NZF material strongly interacts with polyaniline, while the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern perfectly matched with the XRD data. Lognormal distribution was used to determine the particle size, which was found to be in the range of 1–100 nm. A flexible photodetector device utilizing the NZF–PANI nanohybrid was fabricated on an environmentally friendly, biodegradable cellulose paper substrate and the device exhibited excellent performance, i.e., a responsivity of 0.069 A W−1 and detectivity of 7.258 × 1010 Jones at a very low voltage of 0.1 V. The non-stretched device showed a responsivity of 24.980 A W−1 at 5 V, whereas at 2 cm−1 bending curvature, the device showed a responsivity of 20.175 A W−1, which was much higher than the responsivity of a commercial photodetector (<0.5 A W−1).Anshika SinghMs Anshika Singh was born in Sitapur, Uttar Pradesh, India and graduated from the Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University, Kanpur, India.

1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid materials (OIHMs) have received a lot of attention due to their superior performance in photodetectors, lasers, and photovoltaics, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials (OIHPMs) are presently gaining a lot of interest in the scientific and industrial communities.1–7 Recently, it has been reported that a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22% was achieved with solid thin film based solar cells made with an OIHPM, suggesting that OIHPMs could be promising materials for commercial optoelectronics.1–4,10 It is widely known that a high-quality photodetector device must not only function effectively but must also be inexpensive, stable, and environmentally benign.2–4,6–8 The development of earth-abundant materials for optoelectronics and photovoltaics have the potential to improve both the sustainability and scalability of devices.1–4 Therefore, developing low-cost, biodegradable, environment-friendly organic–inorganic hybrid materials is very necessary. Photodetectors, which convert incident light into electric signals, are used in a variety of applications, including optical communication, pollution monitoring, sensors, and water treatment.5,6 Flexible light detector applications across a wide range of areas including stretchy, implantable, small, wearable and printed electronics as well as optoelectronics have gained a great deal of interest in recent years. Photodetectors generally need to operate with an external power supply; however, recently there has been an immense demand for self-powered devices, such as in optics, flammable detection and environment monitoring.7–12 Self-powered photodetectors that benefit from energy-saving technology and that can function anywhere, even in the absence of electricity, are highly desired. Owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, organic–inorganic hybrid materials have proven to be promising candidates for photodetectors due to their high absorption coefficients, suitable band gap and broad absorption range.13,14 These merits enable the use of hybrid materials to construct photodetectors with high responsivity and fast response speed as well as broad-spectrum absorption, ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible solar light spectrum.5,15–18
Such hybrid materials containing organic and inorganic components are considered potential platforms for diverse areas and are known as functional materials.19–21 Functional materials are substances with one or more features that can, in a controlled way, be significantly changed by external stimuli (temperature, electric/magnetic field, etc.); therefore, they are applied in a wide variety of technological devices such as memory, display and telecommunication devices.19–23 Currently, organic conductive polymers such as polyaniline,19,20,24 polypyrrole,21,22 polyacetylene,23,25 polythiophene, and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)26,27 are preferred for fabricating flexible devices and have been gaining huge attention due to their unique properties, such as low-cost, easy processing and eco-friendliness.22,23 An important class of hybrid materials is those in which the organic fractions are composed of conducting polymers such as polyaniline and polypyrrole.22,23,25–30 Because of its potential uses in photovoltaics, memory devices, gas sensors, and as a crucial component of plastic electronics, polyaniline (PANI) has attracted a lot of interest as a futuristic material.28,29 Polyaniline exhibits many alluring properties, such as a wide bandgap (2.5 eV), short response time and excellent merits under room-temperature operation.30 NZF–conducting polymer based hybrids have been synthesized by various techniques, and the experimental procedure applied fundamentally controls the properties of the resulting material. Variables such as the size and shape of the NZF nanostructures, the degree of dispersion, and the kinds of interaction and interface between the organic and inorganic phases, among others, have a direct influence on properties such as conductivity, piezoresistivity, and photocurrent.31
Previously reported results of graphene quantum dots in a polyaniline matrix,23 ZnO nanorods assisted with polyaniline,26 2D self-healable polyaniline–polypyrrole nanoflakes,27 and in-situ conformal coatings of polyaniline on GaN microwires28 showed that different experimental routes can be successful in producing organic–inorganic hybrids of polyaniline. Iron, with its low elemental cost, high earth-abundance, and environmentally benign character, has broadened the scope for material development and is a suitable material for constructing next-generation technology.1–4 When earth-abundant ferrites are incorporated into the polyaniline matrix, they provide many virtues to the final nanohybrid material, such as high mechanical strength and long-term stability, since they function as building blocks. Organic and inorganic semiconductors have very different compositions and structures, which results in major differences in their mechanical, electrical, and optical capabilities. Metal oxides and metal chalcogenides have been extensively explored for sensing, photoconductors, and photoconductive light switches, although iron oxides are the least investigated nanomaterials for photodetector applications.32–34 Iron oxide and its composites combined with the conducting polymer polyaniline can be used in many different applications, such as electromagnetic shielding,35 supercapacitors,36 energy storage36 and optoelectronics.22,23,26–29 In photodetectors, a change in electrical resistance occurs under exposure to light. For example, the combination of the n-type semiconducting NZF material with the p-type polyaniline has been reported to improve the hybrid photocurrent due to the occurrence of exciton dissociation at the interface.37,38 A citric acid-assisted sol–gel method was used to make NZF in this study because it can produce high-purity nanomaterials with small crystallite sizes. Later, the produced material was employed in the aniline monomer polymerization process. NZF–PANI nanohybrids were processed by the in-situ polymerization method and were used to fabricate a metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetector device on a flexible substrate, which was further used to perform photoresponse studies and revealed a highest photoresponsivity of 24.980 A W−1 at 5 V.26,39–42
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
Nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O; 99.9%), zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2 6H2O; 99.9%), ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3 9H2O; 99.9%) and aniline (C6H5NH2; 99.9%) were purchased from Merck-India and used as received without any further purification. Citric acid, ammonia, p-toluene sulphonic acid (p-TSA) and ammonium peroxy-di-sulfate (APS) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar. Double-distilled (DI) water was purchased from Merck and was used to prepare all the aqueous solutions throughout the experimental procedures.
2.2. The synthesis of the NZF material
NZF was prepared by a citric acid-assisted sol–gel method because it results in small crystallite size and high purity of the samples. Citric acid is used as the chelating agent that reacts with metal ions to form a stable, water-soluble complex. NZF was prepared by mixing 1 M iron nitrate nonahydrate in 50 ml DI water, 0.2 M nickel nitrate hexahydrate in 50 ml DI water and 0.8 M zinc nitrate hexahydrate in 50 ml DI water separately by mechanical stirring for 1 hour each. After the formation of homogenous solutions, all three solutions were mixed and stirred for three hours. All the precursors were mixed in an aqueous solution with a 1:1 molar ratio of metal ions (Ni(II) + Zn(II) + Fe(III)) to citric acid. The pH of the solution was raised to 7 using ammonia solution, and the mixture was placed on a hot plate at 200 °C with stirring until a xerogel was formed, which then self-generated NZF loose powder. The gel, on the other hand, produced a rapid flameless auto-combustion reaction with the release of a significant amount of gases, which began in the hottest zones of the beaker and spread like a volcanic eruption from the bottom to the top. The reaction took 20–30 seconds to complete, yielding a dark grey voluminous product with a branched tree-like structure. In this case, the thermal treatment caused a gradual reaction that resulted in a reddish-brown powder being collected in about 10 minutes. Then, the sample was calcined at 873 K for 2 hours in a programmable electric furnace, after which the samples were crushed using a mortar and pestle. A schematic diagram for the synthesis of the nickel–zinc iron oxide is presented in Fig. 1a. The chemical reaction that was followed in the synthetic process is written below44: 0.2Ni(NO3)2·6H2O + 0.8Zn(NO3)2·6H2O + 2Fe(NO3)3·9H2O + 3C6H8O7 → Ni0.2Zn0.8Fe2O4 + CO2 + H2O + N2(1)

2.3. The synthesis of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid material
To synthesize the NZF–PANI hybrid material, we used the in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization approach, as shown in Fig. 1b. 0.1 M p-TSA in 50 ml DI water was mechanically stirred for 30 minutes, which acted as a dopant, and this solution was then divided into two separate beakers. The as-prepared NZF and 5 ml aniline monomer were mixed in one solution and APS in the other one, with continuous stirring for 45 minutes. Next, 1 M ammonium peroxy-di-sulfate was added dropwise to the solution while maintaining its temperature at 0–5 °C, after which it was mechanically stirred for three more hours and left to stand for a day to polymerize properly with the NZF material. After 24 hours, the precipitate was filtered out by centrifugation and washed with DI water till all the impurities and unreacted monomer were removed from the nanohybrid material. Then, the precipitate was dried at room temperature for 72 hours and stored for further utilization. The characterization details and fabrication of the photodetector device are explained in the ESI.†
The possible reaction mechanism of the NZF–PANI nanohybrids prepared by the in-situ chemical oxidation approach is outlined in Fig. 1c. In the p-TSA medium, pure NZF is positively charged, so the anions of p-TSA get adsorbed on the surface of pure NZF.43 Due to electrostatic interaction between the anions and cations, the aniline monomers are transformed into anilinium cations.43 The NZF material is already dissolved in the p-TSA solution; thus, on adding APS, the anilinium cations start to polymerize from the NZF material surface.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural, surface morphological and compositional analyses
The structural analysis of the NZF, PANI, and NZF–PANI nanohybrids was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the as-prepared material, as shown in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of NZF shows characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 17.92° (111), 29.55° (220), 35.10° (311), 42.57° (400), 52.90° (422) and 62.01° (440) with their (hkl) planes confirming their spinel structure and cubic phase with the Fd3m space group.44 All the parameters of pure NZF were determined by XRD, as presented in Table S1.† No other impurity phases were observed in the XRD patterns. All the reflections are in good agreement with the respective Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file no. 08-0234. The Rietveld refinement for the pure NZF material is given in Fig. S1† and the crystal structure of NZF is shown in Fig. S2.† Pure PANI exhibits a sharp peak at a 2θ value of 25.52° (200), while the other characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 15.13° (020) and 20.87° (011) confirm the formation of amorphous polyaniline.45–47 The integrated peaks of both the NZF and PANI phases can be seen in the XRD pattern of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid material. The crystallite size (D) of the material is estimated by the Debye–Scherrer equation,44,87 as given in eqn (1): (1)where D is the crystallite size in nanometers, λ is the wavelength of the incident radiation of Cu Kα (0.15406 nm), β is the FWHM and θ is the Bragg's angle. Surface morphological and elemental analyses were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), as shown in Fig. S3.† Due to the presence of polyaniline in the NZF–PANI nanohybrids, the SEM micrographs reveal irregular spherical particles that are highly interconnected with one another, as well as all of the key elements Ni, Zn, Fe, and C, as corroborated by the EDS spectrum in Fig. S3c.†

Micrographs of the NZF–PANI nanohybrids taken by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 50 nm show typical spherical particles (Fig. 3a), whereas the image at 20 nm demonstrates substantial contact between the inorganic and organic materials (Fig. 3b). As seen in the TEM micrographs, the interfacial layers between NZF and PANI form strong hydrogen bonds with each other. Interplanar spacings were also calculated from the HRTEM image using the ImageJ software, and were found to be 0.78 Å and 1.93 Å, corresponding to the (422) and (311) planes, as shown in Fig. 3c. Lognormal distribution was used to determine the particle size through HRTEM; which was found to be in the range of 1–100 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3c. The SAED pattern confirms that the (hkl) planes are precisely matched with the XRD data of the NZF material of the nanohybrids, as shown in Fig. 3d.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the surface composition and chemical states of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid material, verifying the presence of all the elements, and deconvolution of the core spectra of the elements were done using the Gaussian fitting approach. XPS survey of the NZF–PANI nanohybrids revealed the presence of all the different elements Ni 2p, Zn 2p, Fe 2p, O 1s, C 1s, N 1s and S 2p of the NZF–PANI nanohybrids, as indexed in Fig. 4a. The core spectra of the elements were deconvoluted using the Gaussian fitting method. Fig. 4b displays the Ni 2p core spectrum split into two states: one Ni 2p3/2 at a binding energy of 856.58 eV and the second Ni 2p1/2 at a binding energy of 874.93 eV.48,49 The satellite features reveal the 2+ oxidation state of nickel.48Fig. 4c shows the Zn 2p spectrum with two peaks at binding energies of 1022.48 and 1045.57 eV for Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively.50,51

Fig. 5d presents the Fe 2p spectrum with two peak positions of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 at 711.00 and 724.48 eV, respectively.48–50 Deconvolution of the Fe 2p3/2 peak gave two components with binding energies of 713.98 and 718.16 eV, corresponding to the presence of Fe cations in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites.48,50 The oxidation state of Fe was 3+ due to the satellite features of Fe 2p.48,50Fig. 4e represents the XPS spectrum of O 1s with binding energies of 531.5, 532.16 and 533.3 eV for M–O (Fe–O, Ni–O, Zn–O), CO, and C–O, respectively.48,50Fig. 4f reveals the XPS spectrum of C 1s deconvoluted into three peaks located at 284.70 eV for C–C/CC, 285.62 eV for C–O/C–N, and 288.80 eV for CO.52–55 The sp2 (CC) peak of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid was noticeably more intense, which could be due to the polyaniline expanded-conjugation network. The deconvolution of the N 1s core-level spectrum yielded two large peaks at 399.10 and 401.60 eV, which represent the imine and amine groups, respectively.55 As shown in Fig. 4g, there are strong peaks for –N, –N+, and N–H with binding energies of 399.86, 401.28, and 401.98 eV, respectively.52,55 The presence of sulfur is also seen due to the APS and p-TSA used in the polymerization of PANI.52,56 The peak positions of sulfur with binding energies of 168–169 eV for the sulfate group and 170.02 eV for thiosulphates are shown in Fig. 4h.52,56 All of the elements contained in the sample have their binding energies and atomic weight percentages shown in Fig. S4.†

3.2. Optical properties
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out from 400 to 4000 cm−1 and was used to determine the functional groups in the chemical structure of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid material, as shown in Fig. 5a. The absorption maxima peaks at 3428, 3385, and 3329 cm−1 correspond to the vibrations of the N–H bond.35,57,58 Distinctive peaks corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the C–H bond can be found at 3298, 3281, 3158 and 3097 cm−1. The presence of alkyl substituents in the nanohybrids was confirmed by the C–H bond peaks at 2919 and 2867 cm−1. The absorption maxima in the range of 1620 and 1596 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration in the conjugated system. The presence of quinone diimine moieties in the polyaniline chain is consistent with these absorption bands.5,35,59–63 The intense narrow absorption maxima in the samples at 1509 cm−1 correlate to the benzene ring's pulsation vibrations. The NN bonds are represented by the peak at 1461 cm−1. The peaks at 1349 and 1377 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the C–N bonds.35 The peaks at 1262 and 1197 cm−1 are caused by vibrations of the –NH+ groups created by the protonation of the PANI molecular chain. This shows the degree of electron delocalization as well as the material's electrical conductivity.55
Furthermore, the presence of a benzene ring is compatible with the bands corresponding to the out-of-plane deformation vibrations of C–H bonds in the range of 800–700 cm−1.55 The region below 1000 cm−1 represents the vibrations between the ions present in the crystal lattices and the spinel structure of NZF, giving two prominent metal–oxygen (M–O) absorption bands.27 The absorption band at 523 cm−1 represents the M–O stretching vibration in the tetrahedral site, while that at 455 cm−1 shows the M–O stretching vibration in the octahedral site of the NZF material.27,44 Thus, the FTIR spectrum of NZF–PANI nanohybrid material reveals the formation of the hybrids of two components NZF and polyaniline. The FTIR spectrum of pure NZF exhibited M–O stretching in NZF, as presented in Fig. S5.† As a result of the IR spectroscopy data, we could conclude that the architectures of polyaniline were similar to those of emeraldine.
The Raman spectrum of NZF–PANI presents the interaction between NZF and the polymer polyaniline, as shown in Fig. 5b; the bands prove that the material has been formed completely by the in-situ polymerization method.61,64 Main characteristic peaks at 576.71 cm−1 due to out-of-plane C–N–C torsion, 1165.78 cm−1 due to in-plane C–H bending and 1343.34 cm−1 due to in-plane ring deformation are observed. Distinct peaks at 1372.93 cm−1 due to C–N+ stretching, 1460.51 cm−1 due to –CN stretching of the quinoid ring and 1590.41 cm−1 due to C–C stretching of the benzenoid ring are also observed. These assignments prove the interface interaction between pure NZF and polyaniline, suggesting the formation of the nanohybrid material.61,64
To understand the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was used. The photoluminescence map shows a peak at 453.59 nm arising due to the π–π* transitions occurring in the benzenoid units of the polymer chain, as shown in Fig. 5c.65,66 A strong intensity peak corresponds to the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers whose life is short, whereas a larger separation of the photogenerated charge carriers (electrons and holes) due to a longer lifetime leads to diminished intensity of the peak.65,66
UV–vis spectroscopy of the NZF–PANI hybrid material was carried out in the range of 195-1100 nm in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), as represented in Fig. 5d. The UV–visible spectrum revealed that the NZF–PANI nanohybrid shows absorbance at 322 nm, attributed to the π–π electron transition in the benzenoid moiety, and at 624 nm, corresponding to the n–π* electron transition in the quinoid moiety. A graph of hν vs. (αhν)2 was plotted to obtain the optical bandgap (Eg) of the material. The bandgap of a material is estimated using eqn (2). αhν = A(hν − Eg)n(2)where ν is the frequency of transition, A is a constant and n = 0.5 (for direct bandgap). The straight-line portion of the plot was extrapolated to the x-axis, which gives a bandgap of 1.61 eV for NZF–PANI, as presented in Fig. S6.† The UV–visible spectrum for pure NZF was obtained as well as the corresponding Tauc plot, as shown in the inset of Fig. S7.† The optical bandgap for pure NZF was calculated using eqn (2) and was found to be 2.90 eV.
3.3. Photoresponse studies
To perform photoresponse experiments, NZF–PANI was used to construct a metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetector device. When the photodetector device is exposed to the atmosphere, oxygen molecules from the atmosphere are adsorbed on the materials surface by removing electrons from the conduction band, producing O2− ions, i.e., O2 + e− → O2− (adsorption), and the potential barriers formed between the NZF–PANI nanohybrid and the adsorbed oxygen molecules under dark conditions are shown in Fig. 6.67,68
 Fig. 6  Formation of multiple junctions between NZF and polyaniline under dark and light conditions corresponding to a change in the depletion width. 
When light photons interact with the nanohybrid material, it creates bound electron–hole pairs [hν → e− + h+].68,69 Under light illumination, a few electrons gain enough energy to pass the potential barrier and transition from the valence band to the conduction band. These photogenerated holes combine with O2− ions and convert them into O2 molecules. When solar light with an intensity of 50 μW cm−2 is incident on the surface of the device, these adsorbed oxygen molecules desorb from the surface, i.e., [h+(hν) + O2− → O2(desorption)], as shown under light conditions in Fig. 6.68 These oxygen molecules finally get desorbed from the surface of the nanohybrid material; consequently, the total conductivity rises, and the photocurrent levels rise as well. The remaining uncoupled electron travels into the conduction band, causing the depletion width to shrink.44,70
When the incident illumination was off, the photocurrent sharply decreased to its initial stage.71 Hence, the stability of the fabricated device was confirmed by various on/off cycles;72 the rise and decay time of the device could also be measured from these on/off cycles. The increased electrical conductivity was due to the production of more photogenerated electron and hole pairs, which resulted in a faster rise time. The delayed decay period was due to two factors: first, the oxygen adsorption process of trap electrons under dark condition, and second, the photogenerated holes are captured during oxygen photodesorption.73 The device shows a range of variation of photocurrent when the applied potential drift varies from 1–5 V, as shown in Fig. 7a. It was observed that the device could be operated at a very low applied potential drift, i.e., less than 1 V. Hence, the photodetector device also responds very well at drifting biases of 0.5 and 0.1 V, as shown in Fig. 7b and c, respectively. Thus, this metal–nanohybrid–metal device could be seen as a nearly self-powered device, suggesting that devices based on these types of materials could be fruitful for further research in the domain of organic photodetectors.

Current–voltage (I–V) curves of the metal–semiconductor–metal contact under thermionic emission condition were studied using the Richardson–Dushman equation given as follows: J = A*T2e−qϕ/kT(eqV/kT − 1)(3)where A* is the effective Richardson constant, T is the absolute temperature, Js = A*T2e−qϕ/kT is the saturation current density and the applied voltage V is positive for forward bias and negative for reverse bias. The current–voltage (I–V) curve show the ohmic nature of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid photodetector device, as presented in Fig. 7d, i.e., ohmic contacts are formed between the nanomaterial and electrodes.74 The I–V characteristic curve for pure NZF also shows an ohmic nature, as shown in Fig. S8.†
There are certain figures of merit that can define the significance of a photodetector device. Such parameters are the responsivity, detectivity, linear dynamic range (LDR), and noise equivalent power (NEP). The most important parameter is the responsivity, which is defined as the ratio of the generated photocurrent per unit area (S) and per unit incident optical power (P) (neglecting dark current) determined in the linear region of the response, as given in eqn (4): (4)
The calculated responsivity of the photodetector device was found to be 24.980 A W−1 at a 5 V applied potential difference, while at a 0.1 V potential difference, the observed responsivity was found to be 0.069 A W−1. However, a responsivity of 24.980 A W−1 is impossible unless some other mechanism is in action inside the device. Possible reasons for such high values can be multiple electron–hole pairs being generated for each incident photon as well as photocarrier multiplication occurring under the applied potential drift, which may be responsible for the high responsivity of the fabricated photodetector device.75

I–V curves under dark and light condition at different temperatures were also studied, as represented in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. The non-linear rise in current may be explained by the conduction mechanism of doped processes at higher voltages in the range of 7–10 V. However, conducting polymers have a different conduction mechanism than intrinsic semiconductors.76 The negative or positive charges introduced to the polymer chain during doping do not immediately begin to fill the stiff conduction or valence bands in this case. In the nanohybrid material, there was random charge (polaron) trapping.77 High interaction between the electrons and phonons induces lattice distortions around the doped charge under the influence of an external electric field, resulting in strong charge (polaron) trapping, with their confined motion serving as an effective electric dipole. Under the influence of temperature, the photocurrent increases, signifying that there are more charge carriers present under increasing temperature, which contribute to the conduction process. On increasing the temperature from room temperature to 50 °C, a significant rise in the responsivity from 24.980 to 52.098 A W−1 was observed. The thermally activated carriers can be ascribed to the increase in current as the temperature rises. Imperfections in the polymer matrix arise at high temperatures owing to the dislocation of ions in the lattice, and these defects are constantly present.78 As the temperature rises, the free charge carriers associated with metal ions, as well as the thermal vibrations in the nanohybrid material helps to boost the device current. For example, as the temperature increased from room temperature to 150 °C, the responsivity of the photodetector device increased from 24.980 to 91.173 A W−1, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8b.

(c) Dark I–V characteristics under different %RH. (d) Photo I–V characteristics under different %RH and a fixed illumination intensity of 50 μW cm−2. 
Furthermore, the I–V characteristics under dark and light conditions with variation in % RH were also studied and are presented in Fig. 8c and d, respectively. The conductivity of polyaniline or its nanohybrid increases in the presence of water vapor due to the proton effect, according to the literature.79 Ionized water molecules dissociate into protons (H+) and hydroxyl ions (OH−). As a result, water molecules absorbed into the polyaniline matrix serve as a source of protons, which may either enhance the polyaniline doping level or transmit charge across the network of absorbed water molecules.80 As the level of humidity rises, an unexpected behaviour of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid occurs. From 10% RH to 20% RH, the responsivity of the photodetector device rises from 18.123 A W−1 to 23.197 A W−1, whereas from 20% RH to 40% RH, the responsivity only rises to 24.980 A W−1, and at the highest humidity level of 80% RH, the responsivity of the device was found to be 41.320 A W−1.
The second important parameter of a photodetector device is its detectivity, which is defined as the reciprocal of the noise equivalent power.40 A higher detectivity means that the photodetector can detect very weak slight signals, which can be explained using eqn (5). (5)
The fabricated photodetector device shows a very high detectivity of 3.735 × 1012 Jones at a drifting bias of 5 V, and this detectivity decreases to 7.258 × 1010 Jones at an applied drift of 0.1 V. The responsivity and detectivity of the fabricated device were plotted with the applied potential difference, as presented in Fig. 9a.

The linear dynamic range (LDR) is defined as the linear range of the responsivity of a photodetector device with respect to illumination intesity and is given in eqn (6), while the noise equivalent power (NEP) of a device is defined as the lowest power that can be detected by the photodetector device and is presented in eqn (7): (6) (7)
The LDR of the fabricated device was found to be 19.945 dB and the NEP was found to be 2.237 × 10−7 W at a 5 V potential difference. The LDR and NEP values for the nanohybrid photodetector device were plotted with the varying drift bias, as shown in Fig. 9b. The rise and decay time evaluated by the exponential fitting of these time-dependent response curves according to eqn (8) and (9) were found to be 0.9 and 0.8 seconds, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9c. The fast rise and decay time constants are due to the fast carrier generation and recombination in the photodetector device. I(t) = Idark(e−t/τr)(8) I(t) = Idark(1 − e−t/τd)(9)
The stability of the device was also observed at 0.1 V, and it showed excellent stability for up to 600 seconds, as presented in Fig. 9d. Qualitative parameters such as the responsivity, LDR, detectivity and NEP of our photodetector device at the applied drift are shown in Table 1.

Transparent conductive oxide based photodetector devices are not suitable for this type of flexible application because their brittleness limits the mechanical bendability of the devices. A schematic arrangement of the photoresponse measurements is depicted in Fig. 10a, and the device was also tested at different bending curvatures to evaluate the flexibility of the device. The transient photoresponse of the device at different bending curvatures is presented in Fig. 10b, and their corresponding responsivity is presented in Fig. 10c. The responsivity of the photodetector device for the highest bending curvature at 2 cm−1 was observed as 20.170 A W−1, whereas the responsivities for 1 and 0.5 cm−1 were observed to be 15.790 and 9.890 A W−1, respectively. The non-stretched device showed a responsivity of 24.980 A W−1, whereas at 2 cm−1 bending curvature, the device showed a responsivity of 20.170 A W−1, which was much higher than the responsivity of a commercial photodetector (<0.5 A W−1). The NZF–PANI nanohybrid based device showed excellent parameters as compared to those of previously reported devices, as shown in Table 2.

This work




The mechanism of the photocurrent response of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid under the illumination of solar light with an intensity of 50 μW cm−2 is presented in Fig. 10d. The photons of light generate a large number of electron–hole pairs at the surface of NZF under the illumination of solar light. Consequently, such excited electron–hole pairs are smoothly separated via the built-in potential, resulting in the photogenerated holes in the NZF valence band drifting in the same direction as the built-in electric field in the junction and then jumping to the HOMO of PANI through the junction. At the same time, an exciting rectifying behaviour of the I–V curve was recorded in the photoresponse under illumination.
4. Conclusion
We have successfully demonstrated the synthesis of a NZF–PANI nanohybrid in two steps: in the first step, NZF is prepared by a chemical method, and in the second step, NZF is used during the polymerization of aniline. The as-prepared NZF–PANI nanohybrid based solar photodetector exhibits a short rise/decay time of 0.9/0.8 seconds, high responsivity of 0.069 A W−1, high detectivity of 3.735 × 1012, LDR of 6.920 dB and NEP of 1.641 × 10−6 at 0.1 V. More importantly, the flexibility of the device was checked at different curvatures, and the device maintained a high responsivity at different bending curvatures. In terms of their mechanical qualities, organic semiconductors are often soft due to the weak van der Waals contacts between discrete molecules, as opposed to hard and robust inorganic semiconductors. Nanohybrids are more absorptive than inorganic semiconductors in terms of their optical characteristics. The excellent performance and potential of the NZF–PANI nanohybrid based photodetector device can be attributed to: (a) the use of a low-cost and earth-abundant material based photodetector, suitable for future technologies, exhibiting high responsivity and high detectivity; (b) its environmentally benign and biodegradable nature, which may be popular in upcoming generations since it reduces pollution; and (c) its very short rise/decay time and exceptional stability of 600 seconds at 0.1 V.
