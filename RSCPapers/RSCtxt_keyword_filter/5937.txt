    , Accepted 25th November 2020First published on 25th November 2020AbstractRecently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have made a very impressive progress in the research field. However, less attention has been paid to the intrinsic chemical and photochemical stability of NFAs, although they are correlated greatly with the resulting device stability. Herein, we describe a new molecular design strategy to enhance the intrinsic chemical and photochemical stability of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type NFAs by introducing ring-locked carbon–carbon double bonds between D–A conjugation, attributed to increased steric hindrance of nucleophilic attack and the formation of intramolecular C–H⋯O interactions. Based on this strategy, two types of NFAs were successfully prepared, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine-based IDT-CR and IDTT-CR and thiobarbituric acid-based IDT-CT and IDTT-CT. When blended with a wide-bandgap polymer donor (P3HT), the IDTT-CR-based solar cells can exhibit a PCE of 2.86%. Moreover, a much enhanced PCE of 6.13% was realized by adopting a low-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th to pair with IDTT-CT. The fabricated PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT-based OSCs showed very encouraging photostability, the PCE of which could retain >80% of the initial values after 200 h one sun irradiation in air without a UV filter. Such photostability performance has greatly outperformed those from conventional NFAs like ITIC, IT-4F, and IT-M, suggesting the effectiveness of our ring-locking design strategy. Moreover, PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT-based OSCs could retain ∼70% of its initial PCE after heating at 85 °C for 100 h. Furthermore, we reported an inferior device stability for P3HT:IDTT-CR based OSCs, which is primarily attributed to the evolution of BHJ film morphology under light illumination.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable research interest in the past two decades due to their significant advantages such as low cost, short energy payback time, light weight, flexibility and semitransparency.1–9 Recently, the development of novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) has successfully broken the long-term domination of fullerene-based acceptors in OSCs,10 and has excitingly enabled the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to exceed by 17%.11–17 Although the PCEs of NFA-based OSCs have potentially met the requirements of commercialization, the corresponding device stability still confronts a great challenge.18–21
As per the literature, the mainstream design strategy to develop efficient small molecule NFAs such as ITIC, O-IDTBR,22 6TBA,23 and Y6,24 is based on the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure, in which a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) can be generated to ensure a strong and broad light absorption to effectively harvest solar energy. Furthermore, such type of NFAs possess excellent synthetic flexibility to tune their optical/electronic properties as required for rational integration of different types of donor and acceptor units. In general, most A–D–A-type NFAs are synthesized by a typical Knoevenagel condensation between the aldehyde groups in the D units such as indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) derivatives and the active methylene groups in the A units such as 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN), rhodanine (RD), and thiobarbituric acid (TBA).6 In this manner, the resulting NFAs inevitably contain very electrophilic carbon–carbon double bonds due to the strong push–pull effect, which should be easily attacked by the nucleophiles or photooxidized under light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 1a. This thus would lead to insufficient chemical and photochemical stability of NFAs and would significantly deteriorate the final device stability.

Typically, the fabrication of OSCs involves the use of a variety of well-known interface materials containing reactive species such as the acidic PEDOT and nucleophilic PEIE. For example, Zhou et al. recently demonstrated ITIC derivatives can readily react with the amine species in the PEIE via a typical nucleophilic addition reaction (i.e. Michael addition), leading to extremely poor performance of the resulting device.25 In addition to PEIE, inorganic charge transporting materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO) contain a large amount of amine species such as ethanolamine (EA), which are adopted to stabilize the nanoparticles in solutions; however, EA has been shown to react with ITIC derivatives.26 Furthermore, it is reported that OH− anion behaving as a nucleophile could destroy the CC bond in ITIC.27 Consequently, it is essential to improve the chemical stability of NFAs in the presence of nucleophilic reagent from the molecular design strategical view, which, however, has not received much attention in the literature.
OSCs face photostability challenges caused by the photodegradation of active layers. In particular, the active electrophilic double bonds in A–D–A-type NFAs are chemically more vulnerable than the stable aromatic units under illumination.28,29 Significant research efforts have recently been devoted to study the photochemical stability of NFAs. For example, ZnO is well known as an efficient photocatalyst, which can lead to the degradation of organic dyes under light illumination.30 When the surface defects of ZnO adsorb oxygen and water molecules under UV illumination, ITIC and IT-4F is expected to decompose at the active layer/ZnO interface.28,31 Kim et al. recently investigated the degradation process of structurally similar NFAs, planar O-IDTBR and nonplanar O-IDFBR, and reported that the planar configuration can be more resistant to the photodegradation.32 Li et al. reported that NFAs can possess better anti-photooxidation ability due to deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels (LUMOs) than the electron affinity of oxygen.33 Moreover, Brabec et al. revealed that the photostability of ITIC derivatives is strongly dependent on the end groups and side chains of NFAs,34 and further showed that ITIC-2F- and ITIC-Th-based OSCs can potentially be used as a device with lifetime approaching 10 years under irradiation by white light without any UV light despite affording lower PCEs than those reported elsewhere.35–37 Nonetheless, new design strategies toward intrinsically photostable NFAs are still not known.
Herein, based on conventional A–D–A type NFAs, IDT-R, IDTT-R, IDT-T,38 and IDTT-T,39,40 we have synthesized a series of novel NFAs, IDT-CR, IDTT-CR, IDT-CT and IDTT-CT (Fig. 1b) using a cyclohexene π-conjugated bridge linked with electron-withdrawing end-groups. Indacenodithiophene (IDT) and IDTT are used as the electron-donating cores, while 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN) and TBA as the electron-withdrawing end-groups. Accordingly, the resulting NFAs exhibited significantly improved chemical stability against nucleophilic reagents and photochemical stability in comparison to the control NFAs without ring-locked bridge, thereby making the fabricated OSCs more stable in comparison to the other high-performance conventional NFAs like ITIC.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
The synthetic route of ring-locked NFAs is shown in Scheme 1, and the synthetic details are provided in the ESI.† First, 3-bromocyclohex-2-enone (1) was synthesized from cyclohexene-1,3-dione as previously reported.41 Then, a typical base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation was carried out, which, however, did not afford the desired cyclohexene-locked acceptors, BrCR and ClCT (Scheme 1). After carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, we found a TiCl4-promoted condensation can successfully yield the products by coordinating with the ketone species to promote the condensation as mentioned in the literature report.42 Strangely, for the reaction between 1 and TBA dye, the bromine substitution on the resulting product was replaced by a chlorine atom, the structure of which was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectral analysis (HRMS, ESI†) and signal-crystal structure (Fig. 3b). This, thus, suggests an unusual halogen exchange reaction, to which we still have no rational explanation at this stage. Furthermore, note that the attempt of synthesizing the INCN-based acceptors unfortunately failed. Finally, the desired ring-locked NFAs, i.e. IDT-CR, IDTT-CR, IDT-CT, and IDTT-CT, were successfully synthesized via a typical Stille coupling in high yields of >80% using the IDT-tin and IDTT-tin to react with the BrCR and ClCT acceptors, respectively. However, control NFAs without any ring-locked bridges were prepared for comparison based on the piperidine-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation reaction as shown in the ESI.† All new NFAs had good solubility, and their structures were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, and the detailed data are provided in the Experimental section (ESI).†

Interestingly, BrCR is found to have two different configurations, E-BrCR and Z-BrCR, due to the rotation of RCN end-group that can make the formation of two types of noncovalent C–H⋯O interactions with the neighboring vinylic groups (E-configuration) and methylene groups (Z-configuration) in the cyclohexene-locked bridge, respectively (Scheme 1). Such interactions enable the corresponding NMR signals to downshift as shown in Fig. 2. For example, the signal of vinylic protons downshift from 6.6 ppm in the Z-configuration to 8.3 ppm in the E-configuration. Thus, based on the integration data, the molar ratio between E- and Z-configurations was reported to be 0.64:0.36, the same ratio is observed in its subsequent products, i.e. IDT-CR and IDTT-CR (Fig. 2). Furthermore, pure E-BrCR and Z-BrCR isomers were successfully separated and their structures were confirmed by the NMR spectra as shown in Fig. S24–S27.† We then attempted to use them to synthesize IDTT-CR acceptors with single conformation, which, however, failed possibly due to the dynamic change of the noncovalent interactions under the reaction conditions (Fig. S37 and S38†). Nevertheless, note that due to the symmetric structure of TBA end-group, its resulting products, i.e. ClCT, IDT-CT and IDTT-CT, all did not have any isomers, while the 1H NMR spectra (ESI†) strongly indicated the existence of the noncovalent C–H⋯O interactions.

Single crystal X-ray crystallography
Single crystals of BrCR and ClCT were successfully obtained by slow evaporation of the co-solvent system to refine their ground-state geometric structures based on the X-ray crystallography. For BrCR, it is unfortunate that only Z-configuration crystal could be obtained and its structure (orthorhombic, Pnma space group, Table S1,† CCDC 2014380) is shown in Fig. 3a. It can be easily seen that there is a C–H⋯O bonding that exist between the carbonyl group in the RCN unit and the methylene group (C6) in the cyclohexene bridge, with a distance of 2.29 Å and a C6–H⋯O angle of 123°. Furthermore, a weak C2–H⋯S bonding can be also observed with a distance of 2.27 Å and an angle of 108°. The crystal structure (triclinic, P space group, Table S2,† CCDC 2014381) of ClCT is presented in Fig. 3b, wherein the two carbonyl groups in the TBA unit form two types of C–H⋯O bonding with the connecting cyclohexene-based bridge, with a distance of 2.13 Å and 2.29 Å, respectively, and an angle of 125° and 107°, respectively. These noncovalent interactions could act as the conformational locks to planarize and rigidify the π-conjugated molecular backbones of resulting NFAs, which has well shown to improve charge carrier transport.43 More importantly, based on these results combined with the above 1H NMR results, the chemical reactivities of resulting NFAs were expected to decrease while improving their chemical/photochemical stabilities, attributed to the removal of hydrogen atoms attached onto the electrophilic double bonds in the D–A conjugation that can increase the steric hindrance of nucleophilic attack and the formation of intramolecular interactions, which will be discussed later.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the seven NFAs in chloroform solution (10−5 M) and as-thin films are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. In solution, the absorption bands of the ring-locked NFAs were found not only to show a red-shift of about 20 nm but also an increased band-broadening (∼120 nm vs. ∼80 nm for full width at half maxima, FWHM) when compared with the corresponding control NFAs without ring-locked bridge. This could be attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the ring-locked NFAs due to the enlarged conjugation length and planarized molecular backbone. Moreover, by changing the central core from IDT to IDTT or the end-groups from RCN to TBA, the absorption maxima (λmaxs) of all the resulting NFAs show a clear red-shift with increased molar extinction coefficients (εmaxs), and IDTT-CT thus exhibits the largest λmax of 641 nm with a εmax of 1.34 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Nevertheless, introduction of ring-locked bridge into the NFAs leads to decreased εmaxs, possibly due to the decrease in effective chromophore concentration.

Compared to their solution spectra, the film absorption spectra of NFAs without ring-locked bridge all exhibit a red-shift of ∼10 nm, but, with an increased short-wavelength shoulder peak, somewhat indicating that the occurrence of intermolecular interactions between the films. Nevertheless, the ring-locked NFAs show a negligible red-shift in thin film phase as compared to the solution one. The optical bandgaps (Eg,opts) of IDT-R, IDTT-R, and IDTT-T were estimated from the film absorption edge as 1.96 eV, 1.84 eV, and 1.82 eV, respectively, while those of IDT-CR, IDTT-CR, IDT-CT, and IDTT-CT films as 1.78 eV, 1.74 eV, 1.63 eV and 1.63 eV, respectively. The decreased bandgap for the ring-locked NFAs suggest a potential improvement in light-harvesting when used for OSCs.
The electrochemical (EC) properties of these NFAs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S1†). As shown, both IDT-R and IDTT-R exhibit irreversible oxidation and reduction processes, while all others exhibit a quasi-reversible oxidation process. Then, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels were calculated according to the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −(Eox/red,onest + 4.8) eV, which could be effectively changed by tuning the central cores, the π-bridge, and the end-groups, as listed in Table 1. Overall, the HOMO energy levels ranged from −5.25 eV to −5.44 eV, and the LUMO energy levels ranged from −3.38 eV to −3.67 eV. Because of enhanced electron-donating ability, the use of IDTT as the central core is expected to lead to an increased HOMO energy level compared to those from IDT, while the use of TBA as end-groups would decrease the LUMO energy levels compared to those from RCN because of enhanced electron-withdrawing ability. Their electrochemical energy bandgaps (Eg,ecs, Table 1) were calculated according to the equation Eg,ec = ELUMO − EHOMO, which were consistent with the above Eg,opts. The EC characterization of NFAs was carried out by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) to compare their CV data as shown in Fig. S1c and Table S3.† Based on these results, we can conclude that the introduction of ring-locked bridge is likely to elevate the HOMO/LUMO energy levels.
Chemical stability against nucleophilic reagent
As discussed in the introduction, the A–D–A-type NFAs synthesized by a typical Knoevenagel condensation generally contain very electrophilic carbon–carbon double bonds that are easily attacked by the nucleophiles such as amine derivatives in the many interface materials used for OSCs. Fig. 5a and S2a† illustrate a typical Michael addition that undergoes between ITIC and EA, and the afforded products were confirmed by HRMS (Fig. S2b†). Initially, EA attacks the β-carbon of ITIC and destroys the conjugated structure (Fig. 5a). Then, the terminal acceptor moieties are lost (Fig. S2a†). Fig. 5b shows the absorption spectra before and after the addition EA (10−3 M) into the ITIC solution, a clear intensity decrease can be ascertained for the ICT-induced absorption band due to the interruption of D–A conjugation. Similarly, the addition of EA into IDTT-T solution induces a substantial absorption change (Fig. 5c). Nonetheless, the corresponding ring-locked NFAs excitingly show a much enhanced chemical stability against EA as we expected initially. As shown in Fig. 5d, only a 12% decrease in absorption intensity was induced after the addition of EA into IDTT-CT, and after maintaining the mixture for 40 min, the intensity still maintained 45% of its initial value. In addition, RCN-based NFAs show an enhanced intrinsic chemical stability against EA, even without ring-locked bridge. We attribute this to the decreased electron-withdrawing ability of RCN-based end-groups that makes the double bond less electrophilic than that in the INCN and TBA-based NFAs. However, when the EA concentration is increased from 10−3 M to 0.15 M while simultaneously extending the reaction time, there is still a significant difference observed for RCN-based NFAs; for IDT-R and IDTT-R (Fig. S3f† and 5e), the ICT-induced absorption band showed a decrease of ∼25% after 1.5 h, and almost disappeared after 19 h, while for IDT-CR and IDTT-CR, over 85% still remained after 19 h (Fig. S3g† and 5f).

The concentration of NFAs is controlled at 10−5 M, while that of EA is 10−3 M (b–d) and 0.15 M (e and f), respectively. 
Photostability
Photodegradation is one of the long-standing challenges for organic photovoltaic materials. We therefore tested the photostability of NFAs in THF solutions under continuous one sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2) by monitoring the change in their absorption. As displayed in Fig. 6a, after 10 min illumination, the UV-Vis absorption intensity of ITIC reduced by >50%. To identify whether UV light has a more pronounced effect, the absorption change of ITIC under light with UV filter (transmission spectrum shown in Fig. S4†) was monitored. However, a negligible change in enhancing the photostability was observed as shown in Fig. 6b, indicating UV-light irradiation is not the major reason for photodegradation of ITIC-type NFAs. Encouragingly, both ring-locked IDTT-CR and IDTT-CT (Fig. 6d and f) demonstrated better photostability compared to their analogues without ring-locked bridges (Fig. 6c and e) and ITIC. As shown, after 10 min irradiation, IDTT-T photodegraded almost completely, while the absorption intensity of IDTT-CT still remained at 90% of its initial value. These results, thus, strongly illustrate that the ring-locking strategy can significantly enhance the intrinsic photostability of NFAs.

Photovoltaic performance and film morphology
Single-junction inverted OSCs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer donor:NFAs/MoO3/Ag were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performance of these ring-locked NFAs; the device fabrication details are provided in the ESI.† For comparison, the devices of IDT-R, IDTT-R and IDTT-T were fabricated using the same conditions. Two well-known polymer donors, P3HT and PTB7-Th (Fig. 7a), were used in this study. The energy level alignment of polymer donors and NFAs is shown in Fig. 7b, it can be easily seen that all NFAs seem to have compatible energy levels with a P3HT donor. Moreover, the LUMO levels of RCN-based NFAs are not compatible to that of PTB7-Th, which are detrimental to exciton separation. We also employed another widely-used polymer donor, i.e. PBDB-T, to blend with these ring-locked acceptors; however, the resulting performance was even worse than that from PTB7-Th (Table S4†).

Fig. 7c displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion devices of RCN-based NFAs with P3HT as the polymer donor, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2. To date, rhodanine-based NFAs have shown a particular compatibility with P3HT donor with an impressive PCE of 7% realized for binary OSCs.6 However, all the device performances were not very satisfactory compared to the state-of-the-art P3HT-based OSCs reported to date, possibly attributed to their unfavorable absorption properties (Fig. S5†) that can lead to very low short-circuit currents (JSCs). Overall, the P3HT:IDTT-CR based devices showed the highest PCE of 2.86% among them with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.85 V, a JSC of 5.99 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 56%. Nonetheless, we could not claim that our proposed ring-locked strategy could improve the device efficiency because IDT-CR-based devices exhibited an even lower PCE (0.99%) than that of IDT-R-based ones (1.57%). TBA-based NFAs, IDT-CT and IDTT-CT, were also used to blend with the P3HT donor. However, the fabricated devices performed even worse than RCN-based ones, although the TBA-based NFAs exhibited a red-shifted absorption and decreased LUMO levels. Fortunately, when using PTB7-Th as the polymer donor for the TBA-based NFAs, the resulting device efficiencies were significantly improved, which could be attributed to their enhanced compatibility, and the IDT-CT and IDTT-CT-based devices produced PCEs of 4.62% and 6.13%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7d and Table 2. As shown, ring-locked IDTT-CT delivered a decreased device performance compared to the IDTT-T analogue with the best PCE of 8.72%. However, IDTT-CT-based devices exhibited much more enhanced device stability as discussed later. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. S6†) of P3HT:IDTT-CR and PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT-based devices were measured under the AM 1.5G solar spectrum (100 mW cm−2). For the P3HT:IDTT-CR-based device, the JSC calculated by the integration of the EQE spectrum was 4.80 mA cm−2, which did not agree well with the experimental JSC. The device deterioration is the main reason to cause this and will be discussed later. The calculated JSC (12.17 mA cm−2) for PTB7-Th/IDTT-CT-based device was similar to that measured by J–V measurements (5.3% mismatch).

To verify whether the enhanced chemical/photochemical stabilities of our designed ring-locked NFAs would help to improve the device stability, we first studied the device performance variations of P3HT:IDTT-CR, PTB7-Th:IDTT-T and PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT blends under simulated AM 1.5G solar spectrum irradiation in the glove box with dry nitrogen atmosphere, and the corresponding degradation curves at different photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 8a–c. The P3HT:IDTT-CR-based devices displayed dramatic burn-in degradation in the first 5 h, although IDTT-CR had a higher chemical/photochemical stability than IDTT-CT. After continuous irradiation for 200 h, the PCE of P3HT:IDTT-CR blend exhibited a serious decrease up to ∼50% while only 14% was observed for that of PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT blend. Encouragingly, the photostability of PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT device was much better than that of PTB7-Th:IDTT-T device, which stayed at 57% of initial PCE under similar test conditions. This result, thus, directly confirmed the advantages of our ring-locked strategy in enhancing the intrinsic stabilities of NFAs.
 Fig. 8  The device performance variation under continuous irradiation: (a) P3HT:IDTT-CR device, (b) PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT and (c) PTB7-Th:IDTT-T device in a glovebox with dry nitrogen atmosphere under one sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2); PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT devices in air under one sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2) (d) with UV filter and (e) without UV filter; (f) PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT devices at 85 °C in a glovebox with dry nitrogen atmosphere. 
Beyond that, the photostability of PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT devices in air under one sun irradiation with or without UV filter was evaluated further (Fig. 8d and e), both of which can encouragingly show a comparative stability as treated in dry nitrogen atmosphere and can retain >80% of the original PCEs. These results, therefore, strongly suggest the negative effects of oxygen and UV light in degrading the device performance can be alleviated effectively by taking advantage of our proposed ring-locked strategy, combining with that the device performance of traditional state-of-the-art NFAs such as ITIC, IT-4F, and IT-M experienced a more severe decay under similar test conditions, and <40% of their original PCEs were retained just after 100 h under one sun exposure in dry nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S7†). Because the device stability of OSCs is affected by heat, we further checked the thermostability of PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT based devices heated at 85 °C in dry nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 8f, ∼70% of initial PCE could be retained after heating for 100 h.
As discussed above, IDTT-CR exhibits a better chemical and photochemical stability than that of IDTT-CT; however, the P3HT:IDTT-CR devices conversely showed worse device stabilities. To reveal the reason for the distinct device stability between P3HT:IDTT-CR and PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT, we characterized the evolution of blend film morphologies after light irradiation via AFM. As displayed in Fig. 9, the P3HT:IDTT-CR blend film showed huge change in terms of surface roughness as determined from the root mean square roughness (Rq) from 4.27 nm to 8.10 nm after 24 h light irradiation; however, a negligible change is observed for the PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT blend film. Consequently, the morphology change could be responsible in significantly decreasing performance for the P3HT:IDTT-CR blend. The above results further indicate the light-induced performance degradation of OSCs is a complicated process, which is related not only to the intrinsic photochemical stability of materials but also the physical film morphology.

Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized four ring-locked NFAs, IDT-CR, IDTT-CR, IDT-CT and IDTT-CT by adopting cyclohexene as a π-conjugated bridge. Compared with the control NFAs without a ring-locked bridge, the ring-locked NFAs demonstrated significantly enhanced chemical stability against nucleophilic reagents such as primary amine derivatives as well as improved photochemical stability against strong light irradiation, attributed the removal of β-hydrogen atoms in the electrophilic double bonds that can increase the steric hindrance of nucleophilic attack and the formation of intramolecular C–H⋯O interactions to stabilize the γ-hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, the introduction of cyclohexene-based bridge could slightly amplify the conjugation of acceptors, leading to red-shifted UV-Vis absorption spectra with decreased optical bandgaps. When blended with a wide-bandgap polymer donor (P3HT), the IDTT-CR-based solar cells exhibited a PCE of 2.86%. Adopting a low-bandgap polymer PTB7-Th to blend with IDTT-CT, the optimized devices showed a PCE of 6.13%. Although the PCEs are not as high as those of state-of-the-art NFA-based OSCs, these two blends demonstrated a much enhanced device stability. In particular, the PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT-based OSCs can retain over 80% of its initial PCE in air after one sun irradiation without UV filter for 200 h, and ∼70% after heating at 85 °C for 100 h. These results thus strongly suggest the use of ring-locked π-conjugated bridge as an effective strategy for improving the NFAs chemical/photochemical stability and provide a good molecular insight for designing stable NFAs. Moreover, the relatively inferior device stability for P3HT:IDTT-CR-based devices highlights the importance of maintaining stable morphology on the device stability.
