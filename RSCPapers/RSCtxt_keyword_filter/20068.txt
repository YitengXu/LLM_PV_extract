Organometal halide perovskites exhibit great promise for lightweight, low-cost and high efficiency solar cells due to their tunable optical band gaps, strong light absorption and especially excellent carrier transport properties.1–4 Long, balanced electron and hole diffusion lengths greater than 100 nm and 175 μm were demonstrated in polycrystalline and single-crystalline CH3NH3PbI3, respectively.5,6 Ideally, growth of single-crystalline perovskites with a completely removed grain boundary and defects would enable the perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) to approach the Shockley–Queisser maxima power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼30%.7–11 To approach this goal, much attention has been paid to achieve high quality perovskite films, including solvent engineering,12 interfacial engineering,13–16 compositional engineering,17,18 systematic study of the crystallization kinetics19 and the film processing method.20 Recently, large-sized perovskite single crystals were obtained using facile solution methods and have been applied to photo detectors21 and lasers22 which may expand broad applications of high-quality single-crystalline perovskites.23–27 However, these single-crystalline perovskites with a large size are difficult to be used for solar cells mostly due to the challenge of crystal engineering to accommodate the device architecture. For example, direct growth of single-crystalline perovskite thin films on a hole-transporting layer or electron-transporting layer is very challenging and seldom reported.28 Herein, in this work, single-crystalline perovskite arrays grown directly on PEDOT:PSS layers were obtained by the droplet-pinned crystallization (DPC) method that was previously developed to grow aligned single crystals.29,30 An inverted solar cell with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/single-crystalline perovskite arrays/PCBM/ZnO/Al was also demonstrated.
Single-crystalline perovskite arrays were grown by the DPC method shown in (Fig. 1). A layer of PEDOT:PSS was first spin-coated onto a cleaned ITO substrate. Then 20 μL freshly prepared CH3NH3PbI3 solution (PbI2:CH3NH3I = 1:1) was dropped onto the substrate (1.5 × 1.5 cm2), and a piece of silicon wafer (0.2 × 1 cm2, pinner) was placed on the substrate to pin the solution droplet. The substrate in a Petri dish (35 × 10 mm) was placed on a hotplate. Crystal arrays formed after the solvent evaporated on the hotplate at 80 °C within 15 min and they were, subsequently, annealed at 100 °C for 3 min.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the growth process of CH3NH3PbI3 arrays. A CH3NH3PbI3 solution is first dropped on a PEDOT:PSS-modified ITO glass with a smaller piece of wafer to pin the droplet. As the solvent evaporates, precursors crystallize along the receding direction of the droplet. After the annealing process, rectangular CH3NH3PbI3 arrays form. 

Fig. 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals grown by the DPC method on an ITO glass substrate coated with a PEDOT:PSS layer from various concentrations of the CH3NH3PbI3 solution. The CH3NH3PbI3 crystals are expressed as a ribbon-like morphology with a width of tens of micrometers. With the increase of concentration, the thickness of the perovskite ribbons increases from about 300 nm to about 3 μm (Fig. 2b, d, f, h and j) and the surface coverage of the crystals gradually increases (Fig. 2a, c, e, g and i). As we continued to increase the concentration to 300 mg mL−1, dendritic crystals instead of ribbons were obtained (Fig. S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 2  SEM top view (a, c, e, g and i) and section view (b, d, f, h and j) of CH3NH3PbI3 arrays grown from various concentrations: (a) and (b) 10 mg mL−1, (c) and (d) 50 mg mL−1, (e) and (f) 100 mg mL−1, (g) and (h) 150 mg mL−1, and (i) and (j) 200 mg mL−1. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the crystals (Fig. 3a) show a set of diffraction peaks that can be assigned to the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 crystal structure. The CH3NH3PbI3 ribbons grown from 10 mg mL−1 solution were used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 3b inset) of the ribbon shows a single set diffraction spots that are indexed to the tetragonal crystal structure with zone axes of [110] or [001], indicative of single-crystallinity.22 Accordingly, the high-resolution TEM image directly shows the regular two dimensional lattice fringes (Fig. 3c). As supporting evidence for the single-crystallinity, the rotated crystals extinguish simultaneously as single crystals between crossed polarizers (Fig. 3d). Based on the data of the SEM images, the XRD pattern, the SAED pattern, and the polarized optical images, we conclude that single-crystalline lead halide perovskite arrays have been obtained.

We then applied the single-crystalline perovskite arrays to make solar cells in an inverted structure (Fig. 4a). We selected the crystals grown from a concentration of 200 mg mL−1 because of the relatively high surface coverage of the crystals. The best device yields a short circuit current density (JSC) of 8.7 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.52 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.38, and a PCE of 1.73% (Fig. 4b), when measured by sweeping from forward bias (1.2 V) to reverse bias (−0.1 V). Negligible J–V hysteresis is observed for this device from forward bias (1.2 V) to reverse bias (−0.1 V) and from reverse bias (−0.1 V) to forward bias (1.2 V) (Fig. S2†). Fig. 4c shows the histogram of the PCE values from 20 devices. The performance we achieved is relatively low compared to that of typically used polycrystalline perovskite thin films. The low performance was attributed mainly to two reasons. First, the incomplete coverage of the perovskite arrays on the PEDOT:PSS layer leads to direct contact between PCBM and PEDOT:PSS, which will cause large leakage current and subsequently the reduced open circuit voltage (VOC).31,32 Furthermore, the incomplete coverage will cause the transmission of light from the regions without perovskite crystals. The consequent decrease in the absorption suppresses the charge generation, which is seen in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum with relatively low EQE values (Fig. 4d). As supporting evidence, the devices with lower surface coverage of the perovskite crystals prepared from a CH3NH3PbI3 solution with a lower concentration exhibit even worse performance (Table 1). Second, another possible explanation for the low photovoltaic performance lies in the defects on the crystal surface. The defects will cause severe surface recombination and a reduced carrier diffusion length, leading to low VOC and JSC.22,30,31

In summary, single-crystalline perovskite arrays on PEDOT:PSS layers have been prepared by the DPC method. An inverted solar cell with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/single-crystalline perovskite arrays/PCBM/ZnO/Al was also demonstrated. Future work will be focused on crystal engineering to increase the grain size and surface coverage of the perovskite arrays as well as passivation of the surface defects.
