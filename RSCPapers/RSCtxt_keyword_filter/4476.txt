Our results showed that by introducing 17 mol% thiol functionality in the polymer, the Jsc and Voc can be increased by twofold in polymer:CdSe quantum dot (QD) HSCs.
An interpenetrating nanostructured network of organic electron-rich polymers (p-type) and electron-deficient inorganic nanoparticles (n-type) constitutes a hybrid system which possesses combined properties of both material classes.1–4 Organic polymers with solution processability and good opto-electronic properties combined with inorganic semiconducting nanocrystals with tunable band gaps are a viable candidate for next generation solar cells. Since the first hybrid solar cell (HSC) demonstrated by Alivisatos et al. using regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) as the electron-rich (p-type) semiconductor and CdSe nanorods as the electron-deficient (n-type) semiconductor,3,5 different HSCs have been fabricated employing polythiophenes,6–14 phenylenevinylene polymers,15–17 and low band gap polymers.18,19 Among many semiconductor n-type nanocrystals, CdSe,2,3,8,9,16,20,21 CdTe,22,23 ZnO,24 PbS,18 CdS25 and alloyed nanocrystals have been investigated in applications of hybrid solar cells yielding a maximum efficiency of 5.5% reported by Ma et al. for poly(2,6-(N-(1-octylnonyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)) blended with PbSxSe1−x quantum dots.19 The poor efficiencies of hybrid solar cells compared to those of their fullerene counterparts are most likely due to the poor nanostructured interfaces which hinder the exciton diffusion leading to charge recombination pathways.6,9,26 Achieving a bi-continuous network with well-defined interfaces is expected to improve charge extraction and transport.25
Therefore, attention is needed to explore new strategies to control the phase separation in order to improve interfacial interactions between inorganic nanocrystals and polymers. One of the key factors governing favorable three-dimensional interpenetrating networks is the blending morphology. A number of methods have been utilized to obtain favorable organic–inorganic interfaces including modifications of the polymer architecture,6 adaptation of nanocrystal surfaces via ligand exchange reactions, and in situ polymer–nanocrystal formations.7,10
Out of the aforementioned techniques, nanocrystal ligand exchange reactions and introduction of functional groups as polymer end groups have proven to be effective. Surface ligands employed in nanocrystal syntheses serve as a platform for surface passivation to generate monodisperse nanocrystals with very few surface defects. Although these ligands improve blending morphologies with polymers due to enhanced solubility in common processing solvents, they diminish photovoltaic performances by impeding charge transfer processes due to their insulating nature. Therefore, by exchanging native ligands with ligands capable of electron transfer, HSC performances can be improved. To control phase separation, Fréchet et al. demonstrated that the end functionalization of a polymer with an amine group could lead to larger interfacial areas for exciton charge separation.6 A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.6% was achieved with CdSe nanorods at a 40% nanocrystal loading capacity blended with end functionalized P3HT. Later, Stefan et al. demonstrated a maximum efficiency of 0.90% and 0.60% for HSCs derived from H/allyl- and H/propylthiol terminated rr-P3HT blended with CdSe quantum dots, respectively.8
Moreover, PCE enhancements are achieved in HSCs by virtue of delicate ligand engineering involving thiols, amines and carboxylic acid groups. Krüger et al. showed through a simple hexanoic acid treatment that PCEs could increase to 2.0% for a P3HT:CdSe QD HSC.27 The role of thiols in ligand exchange reactions was later established with the use of tert-butylthiols,28 monothiols29 and dithiols30 with varying chain lengths. Out of the many thiols used, ethanedithiol (EDT) was found to be an interesting small molecule for post-deposition ligand exchange reactions using which Xue and co-workers demonstrated an efficiency increase from 1.4% to 2.6% for P3HT:CdSe nanorod based HSCs and from 3.3% to 4.7% for PCPDTBT:CdSe nanorod based HSCs upon post-deposition EDT ligand exchange reactions.31 With the drastic differences observed using the EDT molecule, inclusion of thiols onto the side chains would be highly interesting with the intention of grafting more nanoparticles to the polymer backbone.
Here, we report two novel polythiophene block copolymers and compare their opto-electronic properties with those of H/Br rr-P3HT and allyl end capped rr-P3HT. To obtain comparable opto-electronic properties the tested H/Br P3HT, allyl-P3HT and the polythiophene copolymers have similar molecular weights.
A facile synthetic method to generate side chain functionalized thiophene block copolymers from 3-alkenyl substituted thiophene monomers which are amenable to post-polymerization chemical modification using Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization is discussed in this paper. To gain insight into the variations in the performances with our previous results,8 CdSe QDs were employed as the preferred inorganic nanocrystals. To generate block copolymers, 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (M1) and 2,5-dibromo-3-pentenylthiophene (M2) were synthesized (Scheme 1) and served as monomers for the synthesis of block copolymers.32 Monomer M2 was synthesized with the intention of generating poly(3-pentenylthiophene) which is ideal to demonstrate the effects of functional groups. The poly(3-pentenylthiophene) homopolymer was obtained with a low molecular weight (1775 g mol−1, PDI = 1.54), which is not found to be useful in photovoltaic devices. However, to prove the influence of side chain functionalization on HSCs, the M2 monomer was used with living rr-P3HT to build block copolymers. Synthesis of M2 was carried out by using 3-bromothiophene and 5-bromo-1-pentene via a Kumada cross-coupling reaction to generate 3-pentenylthiophene. To generate the dibromo derivative, two reactions were employed: first, lithiation with n-BuLi and bromination with CBr4 and second, lithiation with LDA and bromination with CBr4.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of 2,5-dibromo-3-pentenylthiophene (M2). 
A living P3HT block with an average molecular weight of 8000 g mol−1 was prepared from M1 by GRIM polymerization followed by the sequential addition of monomer M2 (Scheme 2). Due to the living nature of the Ni catalyst, the resulting monomer 2-bromo-3-pentenyl-5-thienyl magnesium chloride was injected to grow the second block. Even though the molar feed ratio of the monomers was 5:2 (M1:M2), only a 17 mol% incorporation of the second block was seen from 1H NMR analysis. We speculate that the interaction between the π electrons of the alkenyl substituent and the Ni(0) in the catalytic cycle of the GRIM polymerization limits the incorporation of the poly(3-pentenylthiophene). The same reason may be attributed to the low molecular weight obtained for poly(3-pentenylthiophene). The synthesized block copolymer (P3) was subjected to post-polymerization reactions through a hydroboration/oxidation reaction followed by a Mitsunobu reaction to generate acetylthiol on the side chains. The subsequent reduction with LiAlH4 generated the thiol containing polymer (P4). H/Br terminated P3HT (P1) and allyl/Br terminated P3HT (P2) with similar molecular weights (DPn = 60, Mn = 10000 g mol−1) were synthesized to allow for a meaningful comparison with P3 and P4 (see Table 1). Allyl/Br terminated P3HT (P2) was selected as a reference since it gave the highest efficiency in our previously published report.8

To investigate the optical and electronic properties of the four polymers, UV-Vis and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were performed. UV-Vis spectra were recorded in both solution and films with CHCl3 as the solvent. For CV studies, Ag/AgCl and platinum electrodes were used as reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively, while a thin polymer film deposited on a platinum electrode was the working electrode. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in anhydrous acetonitrile was used as the electrolyte. All the CV experiments were carried out at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under argon. Based on both spectra (see ESI Fig. S8 and S10†), introduction of the functional groups in the side chain doesn't affect the optical or electronic properties, which is highly desirable for this study.
The synthesis of nearly monodisperse CdSe QDs was carried out using a hot injection method performed at 250 °C. The average particle size of the QDs was around 4.0 nm, estimated by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. S9a†) and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. S9c†). Insulating ligands (oleic acid in this case) attached to the as-synthesized QDs were replaced from the nanocrystal surface by pyridine molecules. The effective decrease in the inter-particle distance of the nanoparticles as seen from the TEM images (Fig. S9c and d†) confirms the removal of the long fatty acid chains and introduction of the smaller pyridine molecules. The TEM images were obtained by drop casting toluene solutions containing QDs onto 200 mesh carbon coated copper grids. To further confirm the removal of oleic acid ligands, FT-IR spectra were recorded before and after the ligand exchange (Fig. S9b†). After the ligand replacement, the optical properties of the QDs were found to be preserved by UV-Vis analysis (Fig. S9a†).
We studied the photovoltaic performances of the blends of block copolymers P3 and P4 and compared them with those of H/Br terminated P3HT (P1) and H/allyl-terminated P3HT (P2) (shown in Table 2). The optimum weight ratios of polymer to CdSe QDs (1:5 wt%) were selected based on the photoluminescence (PL) quenching of the polymers with CdSe QDs (Fig. S11†) which was carried out in blend solutions. P4 showed a PL quenching effect which had a normalized intensity below 0.2 when the weight ratio was 1:5. This outcome may be attributed to the better charge transfer between the polymer and QDs when thiols are present in the polymer backbone.

Photovoltaic parameters were observed for the four polymer blends. Solution processed hybrid solar cell devices were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:CdSe QD/Al. The photoactive layer was treated with 0.01 M solution of EDT in acetonitrile to improve the photovoltaic performances via a post-deposition ligand exchange reaction (see the ESI† for the detailed fabrication procedure). Among the four polymers, polymer P4 outperforms the rest with a Jsc and a Voc almost two times greater than those of P1; the four polymers exhibited a Jsc from 2.01 mA cm−2 to 3.67 mA cm−2 and a Voc from 0.44 V to 0.70 V (Table 2). With the introduction of olefin groups at the end of the polymer chain (P2) and side chain (P3), average device parameters increase slightly; Jsc from 2.17 mA cm−2 to 2.30 mA cm−2 (Table 2). In order to investigate the effects of functionality and its position on the device performance, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured. The EQE was significantly improved with a maximum value of 47% in the region of 500 nm for polymer P4, while P1 showed a maximum below 30% in the same region (Fig. 1). The calculated Jsc values obtained by integration of the EQE curves are 2.65, 2.75, 3.00 and 4.19 mA cm−2 respectively for P1 through P4, which show a 14–30% spectral mismatch compared with the values obtained from the J–V curves.
 Fig. 1  (a) J–V curves and (b) EQE curves of the polymer:CdSe QD HSCs. 
The morphology of the active layer was investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM) (Fig. 2A) and TEM (Fig. 2B). The root-mean square (RMS) roughness of the polymer:QD blends is 9.24 nm, 5.28 nm, 4.50 nm and 2.28 nm respectively. With the addition of the thiol groups (only 17 mol%) to the side chain of P1, a drastic decrease in the RMS is observed. By comparing the TEM images of the blend films, the P2 blend shows better phase separation and minimal QD aggregation compared to P1. For TEM images, the active layer was deposited on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO glass and dropped into a Petri dish containing DI water. The floating films were placed on a 200 mesh carbon coated copper grid and imaged from a Tecnai G2 Spirit TEM instrument operated at 120 keV. With side chain functionalization on P3 and P4 an obvious nanoscale phase separation with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network can be clearly observed, which contributes to a higher exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiency. Therefore, the significantly improved Jsc observed is a function of the introduced functional group and its position in the polymer.

Conclusions
In summary, the ability to achieve a bi-continuous interpenetrating network on HSCs via effective functionalization of the solubilizing side chains of polythiophenes is demonstrated. When thiol functionality is introduced, the PCE is nearly doubled due mostly to the observed increase in the Jsc. It is noteworthy that these increments were obtained with only a few thiol groups on a polymer having a medium molecular weight. We believe that our findings would realize higher PCEs for HSCs based on high molecular weight donor–acceptor polymers with multi-armed nanoparticles having larger Bohr exciton radii. With the diversity of monomer and polymer designs together with device optimizations further improvements would be expected.
