Broader context
In the process of developing efficient photovoltaic technologies with low cost to solve the increasingly serious energy shortage and associated environmental issues, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated from low-cost and eco-friendly materials with properties of flexibility, lightweight and applicability under both indoor and outdoor conditions have shown great potential and provided vast imagination space of applications like being integrated into buildings, automobile devices and portable electronic devices. But the efficiencies of DSSCs are still unsatisfactory for practical applications and have been stagnated for some time. To overcome the present difficulties, development of more efficient sensitizers is essential. In this respect, porphyrins with properties of outstanding light-harvesting capability and facile structure modification have shown profound potential. In this review article, we provide a summary of the progress in porphyrin dyes applied in DSSCs and highlight the effective molecular strategies for developing efficient porphyrin dyes as well as the intermolecular approaches for optimizing device performance. Meanwhile, porphyrin based organic solar cells are also briefly described.

1. Introduction
Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels have been widely used to make the world go around smoothly, such as driving our vehicles, lighting up our cities, running our air conditioners and powering our factories. But the increasing industrialization and rapid economic development have led to consumption of fossil fuels ever more rapidly to meet the increasing energy demands. According to the World Energy Outlook 2018 released by the International Energy Agency (IEA), world energy demand will increase by over 25% between 2017 and 2040.1 According to this trend, it's just a matter of time before the fossil fuel resources are depleted. Moreover, over-consumption of fossil fuels results in serious environmental pollution and global warming. To combat the climate change, the Paris Agreement was signed in December 2015 within the United Nations Framework Conversion on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aiming at keeping global warming to well below 2 °C.2 To address these issues, the exploitation of clean and renewable energy resources is an essential strategy for sustainable development.
In comparison to wind, tidal, geothermal and other renewable energy resources, solar energy is one of the most ideal alternative energy resources, exhibiting vast application prospect. Sunlight striking the earth's surface provides 3.8 million EJ energy a year, which means that collecting the total solar energy in one hour would satisfy human energy demand in 1 year.3,4 In addition to its abundance, solar energy has the advantages of being safe, inexhaustible, easily available, and more importantly, environment-friendly. A number of techniques have been developed to utilize solar energy, such as solar energy water heaters widely used in our daily lives, and photocatalytic water splitting, which converts the solar energy into storable chemical energy like hydrogen.5–7 As one of the most important ways of utilizing solar energy, photovoltaic (PV) techniques can efficiently harvest sunlight and convert it into electrical energy with zero carbon emission, offering a rational and practical solution to the increasingly serious environmental problems.8–11 In current PV market, silicon-based solar cells occupy the dominant position because of the relatively mature technology, and a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 26% with a designated area of 180.4 cm2 reported in 2017.12,13 However, the silicon solar cells are based on high-quality and extremely pure silicon obtained through complicated processing with large energy consumption and serious environmental pollution.
These problems motivate scientists to develop more promising third generation photovoltaics, among which dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have drawn significant attention since the pioneering reports about 30 years ago,14,15 due to their ease of fabrication, cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, good stability, and relatively high efficiencies under both outdoor and indoor light conditions. Through efforts over the past three decades, the efficiencies of DSSCs have been improved from 7.12% in 199114 to 14.3% (uncertified) in 2015,16 and the certified efficiency has recently reached 12.3%,17 approaching the threshold of 15% suggested for commercialization. In addition to these achievements based on cells with the active areas smaller than 0.5 cm2, progress in large area DSSCs has been made to achieve certified efficiencies of 11.9%, 10.7%, and 8.8% for 1.005 cm2 cells, 26.55 cm2 minimodules and 398.8 cm2 sub-modules, respectively.18
The main components of a DSSC include a dye-sensitized mesoporous photoanode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte sandwiched between the two electrodes. As an essential component for light-harvesting and electron-generation, sensitizers are the engine of DSSCs and their advancements play dominant roles in the progress of DSSCs. The first efficient sensitizers are ruthenium complexes reported by O’ Regan and Grätzel in 1991,14 and efficiencies higher than 11% have been achieved for ruthenium based dyes.19–22 However, the limited abundance of noble metal ruthenium and the related environmental issues are the main problems for practical applications. To seek ideal sensitizers for practical applications of DSSCs, scientists have turned their attention to the more promising ruthenium-free sensitizers such as metal-free organic sensitizers and porphyrin sensitizers, since they exhibit strong light-harvesting ability and can be obtained with facile synthesis and low cost. In the past decades, a number of efficient metal-free organic sensitizers with efficiencies exceeding 12% have been reported.16,23–33 The characteristically wide absorption profiles in the visible light region (ca. 350–600 nm) for metal-free organic sensitizers endow them with sufficient visible light harvesting ability, but the poor absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region remains a main obstacle for further improving the efficiencies.
In contrast, porphyrin, an aromatic macrocycle with an 18-π electron framework, exhibited an intense Soret band (or B band) in the 400–450 nm range and moderate Q bands (550–600 nm) with molar absorption coefficients (ε) higher than most ruthenium-based and metal-free organic sensitizers.34,35 The wide absorption range covering the visible to NIR region endows porphyrin-based sensitizers with outstanding panchromatic light harvesting ability. In addition, the porphyrin molecule contains four pyrrolic subunits interconnected at the α-positions via meso-methine groups, providing four meso- and eight β-positions at the periphery for facile modification. Hence, the photophysical, electronic and photovoltaic properties of porphyrin sensitizers can be readily fine-tuned. Furthermore, their appropriate molecular orbital levels allow efficient electron injection and dye regeneration processes. These intrinsic advantages have made porphyrins promising for constructing high efficiency sensitizers. Indeed, since the pioneering work by Grätzel and Kay, who utilized chlorophyll derivatives and porphyrins as DSSC sensitizers to achieve an efficiency of 2.6%,36 significant progress has been achieved. In particular, an unprecedented PCE of ∼13% for a push–pull porphyrin sensitizer SM315 using a cobalt-based electrolyte was attained by Grätzel and co-workers in 2014 through judicious molecular engineering.37 On the other hand, the traditional iodine electrolyte based DSSCs suffer from the disadvantage of large loss-in-potential. However, the I−/I3− redox couple can provide fast dye regeneration and slow charge recombination, and has superior diffusion capability through the mesoporous TiO2 film,38 and thus many groups have endeavored to develop efficient DSSCs based on the iodine electrolyte. For example, Xie and co-workers reported a systematic cosensitization approach for synergistically improving the open circuit photovoltage (VOC) and short-current photocurrent (JSC), and thus achieved a record PCE of 11.5% at that time for non-ruthenium DSSCs based on the iodine electrolyte.39
The record PCE of ∼13% achieved for the porphyrin dye sensitized solar cells still suffers from a large voltage loss and insufficient NIR region light harvesting, indicating that there is still sufficient space for substantial improvement of DSSC performance through judicious sensitizer design and device optimization. In addition, the stability of DSSC devices requires further improvement and the synthetic complexity of porphyrin dyes needs to be decreased in order to meet the requirements for commercialization. In recent years, some excellent reviews have been published on DSSCs from various points of view.35,40–55 Herein, we will focus on briefly summarizing porphyrin sensitizer structure optimization and cosensitization strategies for developing high performance porphyrin based DSSCs to provide further insight into the theoretical and practical approaches for further developing efficient DSSCs, especially in terms of functional dye molecular structures.
1.1. Device structure and operational mechanism for DSS Cs
Before summarizing the dye structures, the operational mechanism of DSSCs will be briefly described. As shown in Fig. 1, a typical DSSC device is based on a sandwich structure, consisting of five main components: (I) a transparent glass substrate coated with conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO); (II) a thin film of mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor sintered on the glass substrate; (III) sensitizers chemically adsorbed on the semiconductor for light-harvesting; (IV) a redox electrolyte for regeneration of oxidized sensitizers; and (V) a counter electrode (typically platinum FTO glass) for reduction of the oxidized redox electrolyte.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the structure and operational mechanism of a typical DSSC. 
The operational mechanism of a DSSC device can be briefly illustrated by a schematic diagram as shown in Fig. 1. Its photoelectric conversion processes start with light harvesting by the sensitizers anchored on the TiO2 film, by which the sensitizers are excited from the ground state (D) to the excited state (D*) (1). The photogenerated electrons are then rapidly injected into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (2). After diffusion through the mesoporous TiO2 film to the FTO substrate, the electrons will further transfer to the platinized counter electrode through an external circuit (3). Catalyzed by Pt, the oxidized redox agent in the electrolyte is then reduced to the reductive agent (4). The resulting oxidized sensitizer (D+) is finally regenerated by the reductive agent in the electrolyte to accomplish the cycle (5).
The most important parameter to characterize the performance of a DSSC device is power conversion efficiency (PCE or η), defined as the ratio of maximum output power (Pout) to the incident light power, which is derived from the following equation: (1)Under the standard conditions (AM 1.5G), Pin is 100 mW cm−2. Fill factor (FF) is the ratio of Pout to the product of JSC and VOC. VOC corresponds to the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor (EF,n) and the redox level of the electrolyte (Eredox): VOC = Ef,n − Eredox(2)JSC is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) measured under the short circuit condition, which is expressed as follows: (3)where e is the elementary charge, I0(λ) is the incident photon flux and IPCE(λ) is the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency, defined as the conversion ratio of the incident photoflux to photocurrent density.
Ideally, the theoretical maximum PCE of a single junction solar cell is ∼30% with absorption extended to ca. 1100 nm.56 However, different from the traditional p–n junction solar cells, sufficient driving forces for electron injection (ΔEinj, the energy difference between the LUMO level of the sensitizer and the conduction band of TiO2) and dye regeneration (ΔEreg, the energy difference between the HOMO level of the sensitizer and the potential of the redox mediator) are necessary for enabling the operation of a DSSC device. It was estimated that a minimum ΔEinj of 200 mV is required for efficient electron injection, and regeneration of the oxidized sensitizer with a traditional I−/I3− electrolyte requires a ΔEreg of ∼500 mV.57 These requirements result in at least 700 mV of loss-in-potential, which in turn defines the minimum bandgap and the related light absorption onset wavelength of the sensitizer. When the overpotential (ΔEinj + ΔEreg) is 700 mV, a realistic maximum efficiency of ∼14% is estimated to be achievable with an IPCE of 90% over the majority photoactive range of 350–850 nm and a fill factor of 0.73.56 The large loss-in-potential for dye regeneration is the main factor responsible for the bottleneck of DSSC efficiencies. However, unlike the I−/I3− electrolyte which requires over 300 mV overpotential for the multi-step conversion from I− to I3− during dye regeneration,58 other one-electron transfer redox shuttles, such as cobalt and copper-based electrolytes, have been demonstrated to work well with a much lower ΔEreg (100–200 mV). If the loss-in-potential is reduced to 0.4 V while sufficient ΔEreg and ΔEinj are maintained, a maximum efficiency beyond 20% is theoretically attainable with an absorption onset wavelength of 940 nm.56
In addition to achieving a high VOC by reducing the loss-in-potential, it is also an essential prerequisite to develop sensitizers with a small optical band gap to harvest a broad wavelength range of sunlight that is essential for achieving a high JSC. When the absorption onset is 700 nm, the theoretical maximum photocurrent is 20.6 mA cm−2. By extending the onset wavelength to 800 nm, a theoretical maximum photocurrent of 27.4 mA cm−2 can be obtained, and a photocurrent of up to 34.7 mA cm−2 can be achieved if it is further extended to 920 nm.55 These expected high JSC values are based on the supposed 100% IPCE values within the whole photoactive region (eqn (3)). Practically, IPCE(λ) is related to the efficiency of light harvesting (LHE(λ)), electron injection (ηinj), dye regeneration (ηreg) and charge collection (ηcc), as revealed by the following equation: IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × ηinj × ηreg × ηcc(4)LHE(λ) is dependent on the molar extinction coefficient of the sensitizer as well as the loading amounts of the sensitizers adsorbed on the TiO2 film. When the sensitizer is photo-excited, the excited state may undergo various radiative and non-radiative decay pathways, which may compete with the electron injection process. In this respect, the ubiquitous dye aggregation, especially for the large-sized aromatic porphyrin sensitizers, greatly enhances the non-radiative decay pathway and thus lowers electron injection efficiency by accelerating intermolecular energy transfer and preventing dyes from functionally anchoring onto the TiO2 surface.52 After injection, recombination between the electrons in the TiO2 film and oxidized dyes or redox mediator in the electrolyte are two main unfavorable electronic loss mechanisms that may drastically decrease the charge collection efficiency and corresponding JSC values. Furthermore, charge recombination also causes a decrease in VOC because of its relation with EF,n as shown in the following equation: (5)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T refers to the temperature, nc is the free electron density and Nc is the density of effective states in TiO2. Obviously, upward-shifting of the TiO2 conduction band energy level (ECB), like surface passivation, is favorable for enhancing VOC,55 but charge recombination will reduce the free electron density in the TiO2 film and thus decrease VOC. Hence, charge recombination should be effectively suppressed in order to improve both JSC and VOC.
1.2. General strategies for developing highly efficient DSSCs based on porphyrin dyes
In order to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on porphyrin sensitizers, comprehensive research studies have been carried out, which can be mainly categorized into two directions, i.e., molecular engineering for developing high performance sensitizers and optimization of device fabrication.
For the first aspect, the vast majority of research studies have focused on extending the absorption spectra to harvest sunlight over a larger wavelength range, especially in the NIR region, by decreasing the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Meanwhile, dye aggregation and charge recombination may be suppressed through introducing bulky steric groups. In addition, cosensitization and coadsorption are two effective auxiliary approaches to compensate for the inherent absorption defect of porphyrins around 500 nm and suppress the porphyrin dye aggregation on TiO2 films, respectively.
Construction of a high performance DSSC is a complicated process requiring not only excellent sensitizers but also good coordination and cooperation of other components like the TiO2 semiconductor, electrolyte, and counter electrode. In addition, a number of parameters for dye adsorption, including immersion solvents, dye solution concentrations, sensitization time and adsorption sequence of cosensitizers, greatly influence the amounts and geometry of sensitizers adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface as well as the photovoltaic performance. Adsorption solvents, the pH and temperature will influence the dye solubility. To achieve high efficiency, good solubility is essential for ensuring sufficient dye uptake and preventing the undesired dye packing on the TiO2 substrate. With the increase of adsorption time and dye loading amounts, the light-harvesting ability will be improved, leading to improved photocurrents and efficiencies, but further prolonged adsorption time may aggravate dye aggregation, resulting in aggravated non-radiative decay of the excited dyes and deteriorated cell performance. For cosensitization systems, the concentrations, adsorption time and concentrations of the individual dyes have a great impact on the ratio and distribution of the dyes on the TiO2 surface, which will influence the light-harvesting ability of DSSCs in different wavelength regions, and thus modulate the efficiencies. Hence, these parameters need to be carefully controlled and optimized during the adsorption process in order to fabricate highly efficient devices.41,52
2. Molecular engineering for extending the absorption spectra
To achieve high JSC values, excellent light-harvesting ability over a broad region of the solar spectrum is required for the sensitizers. Generally, a simple porphyrin features an absorption region up to ca. 650 nm, but with poor light harvesting ability around 500 nm and beyond 650 nm. To compensate for the absorption valley around 500 nm, a cosensitization method is usually employed (refer to Section 5.2 for more details). To extend the absorption of a porphyrin dye to the NIR region, it is necessary to decrease the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Practically, incorporation of π-extended chromophores, fusion of the porphyrin macrocycle with cyclic aromatics, and employment of hydroporphyrins are the three most commonly used approaches for extending the absorption bands of porphyrin sensitizers. They will be briefly described in the following subsections.
2.1. Incorporation of π-extended chromophores
Incorporation of π-extended chromophores into porphyrins can decrease the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, resulting in extended absorption. Various π-extended chromophores can be used, and ethynyl units can be used to link them to porphyrin macrocycles. The research studies in this area will be summarized in this section.

Incorporation of acenes. 
Various acene units have been widely utilized for extending the conjugation systems of porphyrin dyes. In 2009, a series of porphyrin dyes PE1–PE4 (Fig. 2) with various lengths of linear phenylethynyl (PE) units between the porphyrin macrocycle and the anchoring group were studied by Lin and Diau et al.59 With the increased numbers of PE units, only a slight red-shift of absorption was observed (λQ: 616 to 619 nm) despite the dramatically varied π-conjugation lengths. The corresponding PCEs were decreased from 2.5% for PE1 to 0.25% for PE4, which is considered to be relevant to the back-electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized porphyrin or the electrolyte, rather than electron injection. In the next study, they incorporated additional acene-type chromophores (from benzene to pentacene) between the porphyrin and the anchoring group of PE1 with the purpose of further extending the absorption ranges (Fig. 2).60 Compared to PE1, dyes LAC1–LAC5 exhibit broadened and red-shifted absorption spectra (Fig. 3b). With the conjugation extended from benzene to pentacene, the Q bands are gradually red-shifted from 629 nm (LAC1) to 751 nm (LAC5). The red-shift extent of the LACn dyes is much more obvious than that of the previous PEn series dyes. Remarkably, the Soret band of LAC3 and Q bands of LAC5 are enormously broadened due to the matched absorption wavelengths between the absorption bands of the primary chromophore (PE1, Soret and Q bands, respectively) and those of the acene chromophores (Fig. 3a). As a result, anthracene-incorporated dye LAC3 gave the highest PCE of 5.4% in the series of dyes. Although LAC5 exhibits absorption beyond 800 nm, negligible IPCE and JSC values have been obtained due to its low electron injection efficiency.

On the other hand, Lin, Diau and coworkers further coupled various aromatic substituents at the meso-position opposite to the anchoring group of PE1 to afford a series of LDn dyes (Fig. 2).61,62 The absorption spectra are red-shifted in the order LD1 (656 nm) < LD21 (660 nm) < LD2 (661 nm) < LD3p (662 nm) < LD22 (663 nm) < LD23 (664 nm) < LD3a (671 nm) < LD4 (672 nm). Remarkably, a dramatically improved efficiency of 8.1% was achieved for LD22. Benefiting from the broadest and most red-shifted absorption profiles with the IPCE spectra exceeding 800 nm, the pyrene-modified porphyrin dye LD4 afforded an impressive efficiency of 10.1%, outperforming the ruthenium dye N719 (η = 9.3%) under the same conditions.
Based on the push–pull porphyrin sensitizer YD11 which exhibits promoted electron injection, various acene-type chromophores have also been incorporated. In 2009, Diau, Yeh et al. replaced the phenyl group in the acceptor unit of a push–pull porphyrin YD11 with naphthalene and anthracene to afford π-extended porphyrins YD12 and YD13, respectively (Fig. 2).63 With extension of the conjugation framework, both Soret and Q bands were red-shifted and broadened. The DSSCs based on YD11 and YD12 gave comparable efficiencies of 6.8% and 6.9%, respectively, while an extremely low efficiency of 1.9% was obtained for YD13. Femtosecond fluorescence decay experiments revealed that, compared with YD11 and YD12, dye YD13 possesses a similar decay rate when sensitized on TiO2 films but it decays more rapidly when sensitized on Al2O3 films, which indicates that rapid intermolecular relaxation or rapid intramolecular energy relaxation, instead of the interfacial electron transfer rate, is responsible for the low injection yield of YD13. Subsequent time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) and photovoltaic behavior measurements of YD11–YD13 upon coadsorption with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) demonstrated that much more serious dye aggregation observed for YD13 may be induced by the anthracene unit, and hence more rapid intermolecular energy transfer may be the main reason for the poor device performance of YD13. Hence, it is essential to suppress dye aggregation when attempting to extend the conjugation and absorption.
Based on the effective strategies in designing LAC3, LD4 and multiple alkoxy chain-wrapped porphyrin sensitizer LD1464 (η = 10.2%), Lin, Wu et al. designed and synthesized a series of novel sensitizers LWP1–LWP4 (Fig. 2).65 In comparison with LD14 and LD4, dyes LWP1–LWP4 show significantly broadened Soret bands, and the Q bands are obviously red shifted from 667–672 nm to 690–699 nm, which can be attributed to the extended π-conjugation induced by the additional ethynylanthracenyl group. Although LWP1 and LWP2 (or LWP3 and LWP4) display similar absorption profiles, pyrenyl donor-based sensitizers LWP2 and LWP4 afforded much lower PCEs (ca. 6.8%) than those of the 4-dimethylaminophenyl donor-based sensitizers LWP1 and LWP3 (ca. 9.6%) due to lower electron injection efficiencies and aggravated dye aggregation. Remarkably, the IPCE response of LWP1 extends beyond 800 nm while without sacrificing the device performance with a high efficiency of 9.7% still obtained.


Incorporation of aromatic heterocycles. 
In addition to the acene family, chromophores, aromatic heterocyclic substituents, such as thiophene and thiophene derivatives, have also been extensively utilized as π-spacers to extend the π-conjugation. In 2013, based on the reference porphyrin sensitizer LD14, Wang et al. studied the effects of phenyl, thiophene and 2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine (EDOT) units as π-linkers (LW1–LW4) as well as the effect of different anchoring groups (Fig. 4).66 In contrast to the benzoic acid group in LD14, LW1 contains a cyanoacetic acid unit as the anchoring group, and thus its absorption spectrum exhibits an 8 nm red shift. Replacements of the phenyl spacer in the acceptor of LW1 with thiophene or EDOT further red-shifts the Q band by 18 and 17 nm for LW2 and LW3, respectively. However, replacing the phenyl spacer in LD14 with thiophene alone in LW4 merely red-shifts the Q band by 4 nm (Fig. 5). These results indicate that combination of thiophene with cyanoacetic acid is effective for extending the absorption spectra. All three dyes LW1–LW3 exhibit broader IPCE spectra than that of LW4 with the onset wavelength beyond 800 nm, but lower efficiencies of 7.1–7.6% were obtained for LW1–LW3 as compared with LW4, which may be ascribed to the faster interfacial charge recombination rate induced by the tilting cyanoacetic anchoring group. Finally, LW4 exhibits the best photovoltaic performance among these dyes with an efficiency of 9.5%, indicating a more efficient electron injection process by using the carboxylic anchor relative to the cyanoacetic anchor. Next, they further introduced a series of thiophene–thiophene, thiophene–phenyl and phenyl–phenyl units as π-spacers in the acceptor part.67–69 The Q band absorption maxima are red-shifted in the order LW7 (670 nm) < LW5 (674 nm) < LW6 (678 nm) < LW8 (684 nm) < LW9 (698 nm), and LW5 afforded the highest efficiency of 7.8%, comparable to the value of 7.93% achieved for the reference dye LD14 under the same test conditions (Fig. 4). In addition, similar thiophene containing π-bridges have also been studied for dyes with different donor groups.70–80

Compared with the incorporation of electron-rich thiophene and its derivatives as π-spacers in the acceptor part, introduction of strongly electron-deficient heterocyclic units like the well-known benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit, as the extra acceptor to construct the D–A–π–A type of dyes,81,82 is a more effective approach to extend the spectral response and hence enhance the photovoltaic performance, which has been systematically investigated in recent years. The strong electron-deficient character of BTD significantly lowers the LUMO levels of porphyrin dyes and causes strong perturbation to their electronic behavior, leading to dramatically broadened and red-shifted Soret and Q bands of porphyrins. In addition, such an additional acceptor not only acts as a simple π-extending spacer but also facilitates electron transfer from the donor to the anchoring group. Upon replacing the thiophene spacer in LW5 with a BTD unit, the resulting dye LW2479 (Fig. 4) shows a dramatic red-shift of the Q band from 674 nm to 689 nm (Fig. 5), leading to a higher efficiency of 9.2%.
The most successful example of BTD-functionalized sensitizer is SM315 (Fig. 6), reported by Grätzel et al. in 2014.37 In combination with a bulky donor, BTD functionalized porphyrin sensitizer SM315 exhibits much stronger panchromatic light harvesting capability compared to SM371 (Fig. 6) with dramatically broadened Soret and Q bands as well as red-shifted Q band (646 nm and 668 nm for SM371 and SM315, respectively). Most importantly, although the BTD-functionalized anchor accelerates electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and results in a slight VOC decrease from 0.96 V for SM371 to 0.91 V for SM315, the dramatically improved JSC from 15.9 to 18.1 mA cm−2 well overcompensates for the loss in VOC, leading to an impressive PCE of 13% using a cobalt-based electrolyte without resorting to a cosensitizer. In addition, 80–90% of the initial efficiency remained after 500 h continuous light soaking under one sun intensity indicates the good photostability of SM315-based devices using the cobalt electrolyte. In 2016, Lin, Wang et al. further combined the effective BTD group with an ethynyl–anthracenyl unit to produce three novel dyes LWP12–LWP14 with varied electron-donating groups (Fig. 6).83 Benefiting from the more conjugated frameworks, all three dyes exhibit broad absorption with Q bands located at about 700 nm and broad IPCE responses with onset wavelengths beyond 820 nm, especially 850 nm for LWP12. As a result, LWP14 afforded a high efficiency of 10.3%, but LWP12 and LWP13 only afforded low efficiencies of 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively, due to the fast charge recombination processes. Because of the excellent performance, the BTD unit was employed in designing a tremendous number of efficient porphyrin sensitizers like LG6,74LG18,73SGT-020,84SGT-021,84WW-9,85JA4,86XW11,39XW17,87 and XW32.88
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures of representative porphyrin dyes incorporating electron-deficient aromatic heterocycles. 
It should be noted that the phenyl spacer between BTD and the carboxylic group plays a key role in retarding back-electron transfer. As representative examples, GY21 and GY50 (Fig. 6) have very similar structures and almost the same IPCE bandwidths, but GY50 has an additional phenyl group.89 As a result, GY21 exhibits a much lower IPCE plateau (Fig. 7a), which can be ascribed to its much lower charge collection efficiency, as evidenced by transient photocurrent decay experiments. On the other hand, compared with GY50, the 100-time shorter electron lifetime (in the case of a cobalt-based electrolyte) and lower chemical capacitance for GY21 indicate faster charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and positive-shifting of ECB, which result in the decreased VOC. As a result of simultaneous VOC and JSC decrease, an efficiency of 2.52% was obtained for GY21, remarkably lower than the value of 12.75% achieved for GY50. In 2015, Palomares et al. further illustrated the importance of an appropriate spacer between BTD and the anchoring group, such as a thiophene (LCVC02, η = 10.41%) instead of a furan (LCVC03, η = 2.55%) unit (Fig. 6).70 In 2019, on the basis of the benchmark dye SGT-021, a pyridothiadiazole unit (SGT-023) was introduced as a more electron-deficient group by Kim et al to replace the BTD unit, and an additional ethynyl bridge was inserted between BTD and the benzoic acid group to extend the electronic skeleton to afford SGT-025.90 Compared with SGT-021, dyes SGT-023 and SGT-025 exhibit broadened and red-shifted (by 16 and 12 nm, respectively) Q bands, leading to extended IPCE responses beyond 850 nm (Fig. 6 and 7b). However, aggravated dye aggregation resulting from extended π-conjugation leads to an efficiency decrease from 12.6% (SGT-021) to 11.0% (SGT-025), and the efficiency for SGT-023 was further decreased to 5.6% due to the serious charge recombination caused by the largely tilted adsorption mode on the TiO2 surface. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and FT-IR spectra indicate the interaction between the nitrogen atom in the pyridyl unit of SGT-023 and the acidic sites on the TiO2 surface, leading to the tilted adsorption of the dye.

In addition to BTD, weaker electron-withdrawing groups, such as benzotriazole, triazolopyridine and quinoxaline, have also been investigated as the auxiliary acceptors in recent years.91–94 Some progress has been achieved in this respect, but further exploration is still needed for achieving better photovoltaic performance.


Further incorporation of porphyrinic units. 
Porphyrinic units also have been extensively incorporated as π-extended chromophores to construct conjugated porphyrin dimers and trimers with narrowed HOMO–LUMO gaps and improved light-harvesting capacities. The linking mode between porphyrin monomers has an important influence on the absorption behavior. In 2009, Officer et al. first reported two dimeric porphyrin sensitizers P10 and P18 (Fig. 8) with two porphyrin monomers linked through a phenylethylene unit.95 Both P10 and P18 exhibit absorption spectra similar to that superposed by their corresponding monomers with negligible red-shifts observed, indicating negligible interaction between the two porphyrin units in the ground state. Similarly, Xie et al. synthesized a trimeric porphyrin sensitizer T (Fig. 8) by linking three monomeric porphyrin units to the 1,3,5-positions of a central phenyl platform. The absorption wavelength of T is similar to that of the monomers.96 These results indicate that such a type of linkage for porphyrin arrays has little effect on spectral extension.
 Fig. 8  Chemical structures of representative dimeric and trimeric porphyrin dyes linked through a phenyl unit. 
However, meso–meso directly linked porphyrin dimers exhibit a broadened and split Soret band as well as intensity-enhanced Q bands due to the strong excitonic coupling between the porphyrin units and reduced symmetry of the porphyrin dimers, respectively (Fig. 9a). In addition, the elongation of π-conjugation will also contribute to red-shifted absorption. Segawa et al. utilized meso–meso directly linked porphyrin dimers as DSSC sensitizers in 2008.97 All three dimeric dyes FbP1-FbP2a, ZnP1-FbP2a and ZnP1-ZnP2a (Fig. 10) exhibit broadened and split Soret band in the 400–500 nm region, and intensity-enhanced and red-shifted Q bands compared to the corresponding porphyrin monomers. Among the three dimers, the highest efficiency of 3.4% was achieved for ZnP1-FbP2a. In 2009, Kim et al. synthesized a meso–meso linked dimer PEG-2b-bd-Zn2 (Fig. 10) by introducing two poly(ethylene glycol) groups to one of the meso-positions and two 2,4-pentadienoic acid groups at the pyrrolic β positions at the opposite side of the dimer.100 An efficiency of 4.2% was finally obtained for the DSSCs based on PEG-2b-bd-Zn2. The efficiency of the meso–meso directly linked porphyrin dimer was further improved to 5.3% by using JY07 (Fig. 10), and the superior cell performance compared with the corresponding monomeric porphyrin dye was rationalized by the suppressed dye aggregation and charge recombination resulting from the orthogonal structural conformation, as well as the broadened absorption.101 On this basis, a further optimized porphyrin dimer m-ZnPD (Fig. 10) has been recently studied by Imahori et al, affording the best efficiency of 7.9% for meso–meso directly linked dimeric porphyrin sensitizers ever reported.98 In addition, the presence of two carboxylic acid groups in JY07 and m-ZnPD enhanced their binding abilities on the TiO2 surface in comparison with their mono-anchored analogues, resulting in improved photostability. As revealed by the binding ability tests, 63% of YD2-o-C8 was desorbed from TiO2 after immersing in acetic acid for 8 h, while only 22% of m-ZnPD was desorbed under the same conditions.98

Although meso–meso directly linked porphyrins exhibit enhanced absorption between the Soret and Q bands, the light-harvesting abilities in the NIR region is still rather limited. To address this problem, ethynyl-linked porphyrin oligomers have been developed as another class of porphyrin arrays that not only broaden the Soret band, but also extend the absorption onset wavelength into the NIR region. In 2010, Yeh and Diau et al. synthesized an ethynyl linked porphyrin dimer YDD0 and a meso–meso directly linked porphyrin dimer YDD1 (Fig. 10). Both of them show split Soret bands due to strong excitonic coupling whereas YDD0 exhibits red-shifted and broadened Q bands extended beyond 800 nm.102 However, an efficiency of 4.1% was obtained for YDD0, which is lower than 5.2% achieved for YDD1. This result may be ascribed to the more serious aggregation induced by the nearly coplanar geometry of YDD0. In 2011, Segawa et al. reported a carbazole donor-based dimeric porphyrin sensitizer DTBC (Fig. 10), achieving an efficiency of 5.2%.103 They further investigated the influence of the electron-donating ability of the donor on photovoltaic performance, affording a decreasing efficiency sequence of DTBC (5.21%) > BTBPA (4.83%) > DTBP (4.57%) > BMPA (3.94%) (Fig. 10).104 Later, Diau et al. synthesized similar ethynyl-linked porphyrin dimer YDD6 (Fig. 10) with the porphyrin macrocycles enveloped with pentyloxyl chains, which exhibits broad absorption reaching 800 nm, but a relatively low efficiency of 4.7% was obtained.105 Enveloped with dodecyloxy chains, an analogous porphyrin dimer LDD1 (Fig. 10) possessing a dimethylaminophenylethynyl donor instead of the diphenylamino donor in YDD6 (Fig. 10) exhibits light-harvesting ability up to 850 nm and an enhanced efficiency of 8.8%.106 A panchromatic DSSC with an efficiency of 10.4% was also achieved through co-sensitization of LDD1 with the monomeric porphyrin dye LD14. Based on LDD1, Imahori et al. introduced two additional diarylamino donors to enhance the push–pull effect and thus enhance the light-harvesting ability.99 As expected, the resulting novel dimeric porphyrin ZnPTD (Fig. 10) exhibits a red-shift of 23 nm for the Q bands relative to that of LDD1 (Fig. 9), extending the IPCE response beyond 850 nm. But a lower efficiency of 6.2% was obtained for ZnPTD, compared with the value of 8.2% achieved for LDD1, which was ascribed to the unfavorable anchoring geometry.
Ethynyl-linked porphyrin dimers are also promising candidates for fabricating solid-state DSSCs (ssDSCs). In 2018, cosensitization of a dimeric porphyrin dye DIPDAB2 (Fig. 10) with organic dyes using CuI as the P-type semiconductor, secured ssDSCs with a high efficiency of 10.1% (VOC = 0.65 V, JSC = 22.0 mA cm−2, FF = 0.71).107 Ethynyl-linked trimeric porphyrins like Zn-ZnA-Zn (Fig. 10) also have been studied,108,109 but no further progress has been reported in this respect due to the synthetic difficulty and poor photovoltaic performance.

2.2. Fusion of porphyrin macrocycles with aromatic rings
Another strategy for extending the absorption spectrum is fusion of porphyrin cores with other aromatic rings, such as naphthalene,110,111 quinoxaline,112–115 benzene,116 perylene,117,118 anthracene,119 imidazole,120,121 porphyrin,102 and thiophene.122 In this respect, the first example was reported by Imahori et al. in 2007.110 Thus, a π-extended unsymmetrical porphyrin fused-Zn-1 (Fig. 11) was synthesized by fusing a porphyrin macrocycle with a naphthalene unit. Compared with the non-fused counterpart Zn-1 (Fig. 11), the absorption of fused-Zn-1 is broadened, and the Soret and Q bands are dramatically red-shifted by 60 nm and 131 nm, respectively. As a result, an improved efficiency of 4.1% was obtained for fused-ZnP, obviously higher than the value of 2.8% obtained for Zn-1. Although fusing the anchoring phenyl group with the porphyrin core (fused-ZnP, Fig. 11) and fusing a naphthalene ring with porphyrin core at the side opposite to the anchoring group (fused-Zn-2, Fig. 11) resulted in lower efficiencies of 0.3% and 1.1%, respectively, their light-harvesting abilities in both visible and NIR regions are remarkable, especially for fused-ZnP, whose absorption edge extends over 800 nm.111,116 Imahori and coworkers further synthesized ZnQMA (Fig. 11) by fusing a carboxyquinoxaline moiety with porphyrin, affording an improved efficiency of 6.3%,112 which is higher than those of π-extended ZnBQA (η = 5.1%, Fig. 11) and fusion position-changed ZnQCA (η = 0.8%, Fig. 11).114 After fusing an additional quinoxaline unit to ZnQMA, the bisquinoxaline-fused porphyrin ZnPBQ (Fig. 11) exhibits split and broadened Soret bands as well as red shifted Q bands (Δλ = 40 nm), compared to that of ZnQMA, but no improvement is achieved as far as photovoltaic efficiency is concerned (η = 4.7%).115 These results also demonstrate the importance of unsymmetrical π-elongation for developing efficient porphyrin sensitizers.
 Fig. 11  Chemical structures of representative fused porphyrin dyes. 
Considering that push–pull structures are favorable for improving the light-harvesting properties, Imahori and coworkers further synthesized dye ZnPQI (Fig. 11) with a triarylamino donor linked through an imidazole group fused opposite to the carboxyquinoxalino anchoring group, and its efficiency was slightly improved to 6.8%, compared with ZnQMA (6.3%).120 Inspired by these results, other fused porphyrin sensitizers have also been reported. In 2010, Yeh and Diau et al. designed and synthesized doubly and triply fused porphyrin dimers YDD3 and YDD2 (Fig. 11), whose absorption onsets are dramatically extended beyond 1000 and even 1200 nm, but almost no efficiency could be achieved due to their low LUMOs unfavorable for electron-injection.102 Wu, Wang et al. reported two novel perylene anhydride fused porphyrin dyes WW1 and WW2 (Fig. 11), all of which exhibit broad absorptions covering the entire visible and a part of the NIR region with the IPCE onset extended beyond 900 and 1000 nm, respectively.117 Due to the combined reasons of low LUMO levels and strong aggregating tendencies, moderate efficiencies of 1.26% and 1.36% were achieved for WW1 and WW2, respectively. In 2014, they further reported dye WW-4 (Fig. 11) with an N-annulated perylene fused to the porphyrin core.118 With effective π-extension, the absorption onset of WW-4 extends beyond 900 nm, but nearly no photocurrent response was observed due to the low-lying LUMO energy level. Similar results were observed for the anthracene-fused porphyrin P3 (Fig. 11), which exhibits an absorption onset of ∼1000 nm but shows almost no photocurrent generation.119
Although these reported fused-porphyrin dyes all exhibit outstanding light-harvesting abilities with red-shifted absorption to the NIR region as well as broadened Soret and Q bands, rather low efficiencies have been achieved for them and none of them exhibits a high efficiency exceeding 7.0%. The insufficient anti-aggregation effect that leads to deteriorated electron injection efficiency is the first reason responsible for the poor photovoltaic performance, which can thus be further improved by adopting enveloping or double-strapping porphyrin structures that have been demonstrated to be effective for protecting porphyrins from dye aggregation and retarding charge recombination.123,124 The second reason is their mismatched HOMO–LUMO levels caused by over-extended π-conjugation that results in insufficient driving force for electron injection or dye regeneration. For sensitizers WW-1, WW-2, WW-4, YDD2 and YDD3, their LUMO levels are close to or even lower than the conduction band of TiO2. Hence, the tradeoff effect between π-extension for a wide spectral response and driving forces for electron injection/dye regeneration should be well optimized for achieving high conversion efficiencies.
Bearing these in mind, further progress has recently been made by Imahori et al., who synthesized and examined a series of novel monomeric porphyrin sensitizers AfZnP, DfZnP and DfZnP-iPr (Fig. 12) with a small aromatic thiophene ring fused to porphyrin at the acceptor or donor side through a bridging methylene unit.122 Additionally, bulky substituents for effective suppression of dye aggregation and charge recombination have been introduced: four long alkoxyl chains enveloping the porphyrin core, two butyl chains substituted at the bridging methylene-carbon atom and alkoxyl or alkyl groups in the donor moieties. For the porphyrins fused at the donor side, not only was the absorption red-shifted, but their molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the Soret and Q bands were also increased to twice as high as those for the benchmark dye GY50 (Fig. 13). Meanwhile, there is no mismatch problem of HOMO and LUMO levels, which results in a high efficiency of 7.3% for DfZnP using the iodine electrolyte. However, a smaller red-shift (29 nm) for the Q bands of AfZnP than those of DfZnP and DfZnP-iPr (ca. 41 nm) indicates that the fusion at the acceptor side is less effective than that at the donor side for improving light-harvesting capacity, and AfZnP also shows a strong aggregation tendency and fast charge recombination process, responsible for its relatively low efficiency of 5.5%. The efficiency of DfZnP was further improved to 8.8% when a cobalt-based electrolyte was employed. Further molecular optimization on DfZnP produced DfZnP-iPr, in which the 4-hexyloxyphenyl unit introduced into DfZnP has been replaced by a bulkier 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl group. With enhanced blocking effects, a high efficiency exceeding 10.0% was achieved for DfZnP-iPr. Remarkably, cosensitization with LEG4 further enhanced the efficiency to 10.7%, a record for fused porphyrin sensitizers. Although DfZnP-iPr possesses a broad IPCE response with the onset beyond 800 nm, a far lower photocurrent of 17.0 mA cm−2 than the maximum theoretical value of 27.4 mA cm−2 (refer to Section 1.1 for detailed discussion) was obtained. Therefore, small aromatic ring fused porphyrins might be perfect candidates for fabricating high performance DSSCs with efficiencies exceeding 13% if the photocurrent loss could be effectively decreased by further exploration, such as donor modulation for reinforced suppression of dye aggregation and charge recombination, and further optimization of device fabrication for better operation conditions.

2.3. Utilization of hydroporphyrins
Porphyrin is a fully unsaturated π-system containing four pyrrolic units. Dihydroporphyrin (chlorin) contains one saturated β,β′-bond, and tetrahydroporphyrin (bacteriochlorin) contains two saturated β,β′-bonds in two opposite pyrrole rings (Fig. 14). They are both known as hydroporphyrins.125 With the increase of the saturation degree of the π-systems, the Q bands are red shifted from the green-red region for porphyrin to the red region for chlorin and then to the NIR region for bacteriochlorin, along with the increase of absorption intensity.126,127 In addition, partially saturated hydroporphyrins usually exhibit a weaker tendency for aggregation due to the relatively nonplanar structures. Bearing these particularly attractive advantages, hydroporphyrins have been pursued for designing efficient sensitizers.
 Fig. 14  The structural frameworks of porphyrin, chlorin, and bacteriochlorin. 
Historically, the first porphyrinoid DSSC was based on a naturally occurring chlorin, chlorophyllin, with an efficiency of 2.6% reported by Grätzel et al. in 1993.36 In the succeeding decades many chlorin and bacteriochlorin based sensitizers have been reported.125,128–135 Among them, a chlorophyll derivative Chlorin-3 (Fig. 15) afforded the highest efficiency of 8.0% with an IPCE onset wavelength of up to 820 nm.133 However, hydroporphyrins reported in DSSCs are mainly derived from chlorophyllins with anchoring groups linked in a nonconjugated manner at the β position due to the limitation of the synthetic methodology for facile preparation of stable and suitable sensitizers, especially for meso-substitution, which leads to the mediocre development of hydroporphyrins compared with extensive use of porphyrins in DSSCs. In 2007, Holten et al. synthesized a chlorin ZnC-EI and a bacteriochlorin FbB-EI, both meso-substituted with an anchoring ethynylisophthalic acid group (Fig. 15), but it is difficult to further modify the meso-substitutions of those hydroporphyrins.126 More recently, Lin et al. reported three meso-diphenylbacteriochlorins: a donor and acceptor-free LS-00, an ethynyl benzoic acid attached and donor-free LS-01, and a push–pull type LS-11 bearing both an electron-donor and an electron-acceptor at the meso-positions (Fig. 15), providing an efficient synthetic method for facile modification at the meso-positions of air-stable bacteriochlorins for the first time.125 All these novel bacteriochlorins display three intense absorption bands in the near-UV, visible and NIR regions, quite different from that of the reference porphyrin dye H2PE1, and their Q bands are largely red-shifted with the trend of H2PE1 (661 nm) < LS-00 (718 nm) < LS-01 (745 nm) < LS-11 (769 nm) (Fig. 16a). The DSSCs based on LS-11 demonstrate a further intensified and red-shifted IPCE response compared to those of the donor-free dye LS-01 and the porphyrin dye H2PE1, with an IPCE onset exceeding 850 nm (Fig. 16b), which is consistent with the increasing JSC values of 5.26 (H2PE1), 12.58 (LS-01) and 16.13 (LS-11) mA cm−2, respectively. Consistently, LS-11 achieves an encouraging efficiency of 5.4%, higher than those of LS-01 (4.7%) and H2PE1 (2.1%) (Fig. 15). These results might be important stepping stones for realizing the profound potentials of hydroporphyrin type sensitizers to achieve even higher efficiencies in the near future (Table 1).

3. Molecular engineering for suppressing dye-aggregation and charge recombination
In a DSSC device, the cations/anions in the electrolyte may penetrate the dye monolayer to approach the TiO2 surface and thus quench the injected electrons. In addition, because of the large conjugation frameworks of porphyrin dyes, they have a strong tendency for aggregation through π⋯π stacking between the dye molecules, leading to the quenching of the photo-excited dyes and the clumping of dyes on the TiO2 surface to leave vacancies facilitating interfacial charge recombination.52 Hence, efficient strategies for suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination are considered to be particularly important. For this purpose, porphyrin dyes may be optimized by protecting the porphyrin macrocycle, donor, and acceptor moieties, which will be described respectively in this section.
3.1. Suppression through protecting the porphyrin macrocycle
In an attempt to address the porphyrin dye aggregation issue, various strategies have been developed (Fig. 17). In this respect, bulky 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups were introduced at the porphyrin meso-positions to induce large steric hindrance around the macrocycle by Imahori et al. in 2007, achieving an efficiency of 3.1% with a VOC of 670 mV (Zn5S, Fig. 18).137tert-Butyl group is another steric substituent that has been used to suppress dye aggregation and improve dye solubility in the early stage of designing porphyrin dyes.138–141 In 2009, Yeh and Diau et al. reported a series of porphyrin sensitizers with 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl groups substituted at the meso-positions, and the best cell performance was attained by diarylamino-substituted porphyrin YD1 (η = 6.0%, Fig. 18).142 But the most widely used and effective approach for suppression of aggregation is enveloping the porphyrin macrocycle with long alkoxyl chains introduced to the ortho-positions of meso-phenyl substituents. Such a concept was first proposed and realized in 2010 by Hupp et al., who introduced (2,6-bis(dodecyloxy)phenyl moieties at two opposite meso-positions of the porphyrin macrocycle, and thus LH3 (Fig. 18) exhibits the best efficiency of 1.6% in this series. Later, a higher efficiency of 5.5% (slightly lower than that for N719) was reported in the same year for sensitizer ZnPDCA (Fig. 18).143,144
 Fig. 17  Strategies for suppressing the porphyrin macrocycle from aggregation. 
 Fig. 18  Chemical structures of representative porphyrin dyes with the macrocycle protected by different substituents. 
On this basis, Diau, Lin et al. further combined this approach with the widely used push–pull structure to design and synthesize a porphyrin dye LD14 (Fig. 18), and obtained an excellent efficiency of 10.2%, higher than the corresponding value of 9.3% obtained for benchmark dye LD13 (Fig. 18) based on a 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl substituted porphyrin structure.64 Since then, the superiority of this approach has been increasingly evidenced. In late 2011, Diau, Yeh, Zakeeruddin, Grätzel et al. judiciously tailored an efficient dye YD2 by enveloping porphyrin with four octyloxy chains to produce the renowned dye YD2-o-C8 (Fig. 18).145VOC and JSC were respectively improved from 825 mV and 14.9 mA cm−2 for YD2 to 965 mV and 17.3 mA cm−2 for YD2-o-C8. Thus, the efficiency has been dramatically enhanced from 8.4% (YD2) to the milestone efficiency of 11.9% (YD2-o-C8) at that time using a cobalt-based electrolyte.145 The electron lifetime for YD2-o-C8 was found to be 2–10 times longer than that observed for YD2 while their chemical capacitances exhibited little difference (Fig. 19), indicating that the octyloxy chains in YD2-o-C8 is more effective than the tert-butyl substituents in YD2 for preventing the tris(bipyridyl)CoIII in the electrolyte from approaching the TiO2 surface to induce charge recombination with the injected-electron. On this basis, they further reported a series of well-designed LD dyes and systematically investigated the contribution of long alkoxyl chains to the improved device performance,64,123 and summarized the following advantages: the chains have good blocking effects to insulate Co3+ cations in the electrolyte from charge recombination with injected electrons in the TiO2 electrode and can negatively shift the CB of TiO2, resulting in enhanced VOC. In addition, they may elevate the LUMO levels of the dyes and provide great steric hindrance around the porphyrin core, and thus facilitate electron injection and effectively suppress dye aggregation, resulting in improved efficiencies with simultaneously enhanced VOC and JSC.

In this respect, Xie and coworkers designed and synthesized a series of porphyrin dyes enveloped with linear or branched chains and investigated the effects of chain types on the photovoltaic performance of the dyes.146 The branched chains (XW19) show no better effect than the linear ones (XW18) for BTD-free dyes, but they exhibit advantages for the dyes suffering from more severe dye aggregation (containing a BTD unit), with a higher efficiency of 7.5% achieved for XW21 than that of 6.5% obtained for XW20 (Fig. 18).
To suppress porphyrin dye aggregation, a more efficient approach might be doubly strapping porphyrin with alkoxyl/alkyl circle chains. As early as 1991, Maruyama et al. synthesized a porphyrin doubly strapped with 1,10-dioxydecamethylene chains to protect the porphyrin ring from metalation.147 In 2006, Osuka and co-workers reported a similar doubly strapped porphyrin for porphyrin arrays, demonstrating that the double straps work well in suppressing intermolecular π⋯π stacking interactions and enhancing the chemical stability.148 Meanwhile, they demonstrated that phosphorescent dopants based on such a double strapping strategy can achieve higher external quantum efficiencies (QE) in OLEDs due to the suppressed non-radiative decay related to less conjugative interactions.149 Bearing such outstanding anti-aggregation abilities, doubly strapped porphyrins hence seem to be promising building blocks for developing efficient porphyrin sensitizers. Furthermore, similar to the effect of the double straps for protecting porphyrin ring from metalation, they also may prevent the attachment of I3− in the electrolyte to the positively charged Zn-ion at the porphyrin center, and hence suppress charge recombination of I3− through approaching the TiO2 surface.150 However, exploration of such an effective strategy for developing porphyrin sensitizers has not attracted enough attention, which might be related to the synthetic difficulty. Recently, Xie and coworkers prepared a doubly strapped porphyrin by a convenient method with the circle ring formed through ethylene metathesis reactions, and used it to construct push–pull structured porphyrin sensitizers XW40 and XW41 (Fig. 18).124 Compared with the benchmark dye XW10 enveloped with dodecyloxy chains, XW40 displays not only better suppression of dye aggregation but also an increased dye loading amount, which can be ascribed to its more compact configuration. Consequently, compared with XW10 (η = 8.6%), an improved efficiency of 9.3% was gained for XW40, with synergistically enhanced VOC and JSC of 730 mV and 18.67 mA cm−2, respectively. Although further introduction of a BTD unit as the auxiliary acceptor to extend spectral response unfavorably leads to degraded device performance due to the aggravated dye aggregation, the efficiency of XW41 (η = 8.2%) is still higher than that of 7.8% for its counterpart (XW11). These results indicate that the double strapping approach is indeed promising for developing high-performance porphyrin dyes for fabricating efficient DSSCs.
3.2. Suppression by judicious modification on the donor moiety
Up to now, many different types of electron-rich groups like arylamine,37,151 carbazole,152,153 phenothiazine,39,154 indoline,88,155N-annulated perylene,85,118 ullazine,156 triazatruxene,157,158 and triphenylimidazole73 (Fig. 20) have been exploited as the electron donor of porphyrin sensitizers to “push” the electrons towards the TiO2 film, favoring the electron injection process. In addition, the introduction of a donor also “pushes” the absorption to the NIR region. For applications in constructing highly efficient sensitizers, some basic principles are required for the electron donor. For example, the donating ability should not be too strong to retain adequate driving force for efficient regeneration of the oxidized dyes, and appropriate linking mode between the donor and porphyrin macrocycle is essential for achieving effective electronic coupling between them. In this respect, amino derivatives and ethynylene-linkages have been demonstrated to be effective.42 In addition to the requirements mentioned above, capabilities of suppressing aggregation and charge recombination should also be imparted to the donors. One of the key and effective methods is to tailor the donor with steric substituents like alkyl/alkoxyl/glycol chains,86,159–161 which help the formation of a compact sensitizer layer to impede the cations/anions in the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface followed by charge recombination with the injected electrons. Thus, a lot of research studies have focused on the structural optimization of donors, and significant progress made for several typical donors will be described in this section.

Diarylamine based donors. 
With the ability of direct connection to the porphyrin ring through the electron-rich nitrogen atom, diarylamine based donors exhibit strong electronic communication with the porphyrin π-system and fast regeneration kinetics with the redox couple, and thus they have been investigated as one of the most efficient classes of donors for synthesizing porphyrin sensitizers. In 2009, Yeh and co-workers reported the first example of a diarylamine donor based porphyrin dye YD1 using the bis((4-tert-butyl)phenyl)amino group as the donor, achieving an efficiency of 6.0%, higher than that of 2.4% for YD0 (Fig. 21).142 On this basis, they prepared a series of porphyrin dyes YD2–YD5 (Fig. 21) bearing hexyl, methoxyl, pentoxyl and bis((4-tert-butyl)phenyl)amino substituents on the diphenylamino donor, with the purpose of examining the effects of substituents on the DSSC efficiencies.162 Among these substituents, the hexyl chains in YD2 affords an improved efficiency of 6.6% in comparison with that of 6.0% for tert-butyl groups (YD1), showing the advantages of long alkyl chains. As a consequence of optimizing device fabrication, the efficiency of YD2 was remarkably enhanced to 11.0%, a record for porphyrin based DSSCs at that time.163
 Fig. 21  Chemical structures of representative diarylamino donor based porphyrin dyes. 
On the other hand, bulky donors may be developed by incorporating additional aromatic groups as well as long alkoxyl/alkyl chains to promote the formation of a compact dye monolayer on the TiO2 film and enhance the steric hindrance for inhibiting Co3+ cations in the electrolyte from approaching the TiO2 surface. This approach has been demonstrated to be effective for suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination to obtain high VOC in the field of organic sensitizers.164–166 Based on such a strategy, Grätzel et al. functionalized the porphyrin core with a bulky 2,4-dialkoxyphenyl-modified diphenylamino donor using 4-ethynyl benzoic acid as the anchoring group, achieving a high efficiency of 12.0% (SM371, Fig. 21), which was further improved to 13.0% (SM315, Fig. 21) by incorporating a BTD unit to extend the absorption spectra.37


Triarylamine based donors. 
Triarylamine and its derivatives are the most studied donor units in organic sensitizers so far, endowing a number of organic dyes with high efficiencies.167–170 Porphyrins incorporating a triarylamine based donor have also been reported. For instance, Yeh and Diau et al. reported the first triphenylamine donor-based porphyrin dye YD7 (Fig. 22) with an efficiency of 4.4%.142,162 In 2015, Xie et al. reported a series of triarylamine donor-based porphyrin dyes XW14–XW17 (Fig. 22) that well demonstrated the importance of protecting the donor group.87 Porphyrin dye XW14 contains a triphenylamine moiety with two hexyloxy chains introduced into the phenyl unit adjacent to the porphyrin ring, and it exhibited an efficiency of 8.6%, which was improved stepwise to 8.7% for XW15 and 9.1% for XW16 after functionalizing the triphenylamine donor with additional methoxy and hexyloxy chains. Based on the optimized triphenylamine donor, a BTD unit was further introduced as the auxiliary acceptor to furnish XW17, which achieved higher efficiencies of 9.5% for individual dyes and 10.9% for cosensitization.87

In 2018, Kim et al. modified the triphenylamino donor with two hexyloxy chains to afford porphyrin dye SGT-052 (Fig. 22) and achieved an efficiency of 8.0%.171 In comparison with SGT-052, the device performances for the corresponding bulky donor-containing dye SGT-053 (Fig. 22)171 were slightly lowered, but could be improved by replacing the phenylene unit in the donor part with extended auxiliary π-spacers thieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene or hexylated thieno-[3,2-b]indole. The resulting dyes SGT-030 and SGT-031 both exhibited significantly improved JSC (15.58–15.82 mA cm−2) and VOC (858 mV) values compared with the those obtained for SGT-053 (13.59 mA cm−2 and 759 mV) under the same conditions.172 As a result, efficiencies of 9.87% and 9.94% were achieved for SGT-030 and SGT-031, respectively, obviously higher than those of ca. 8.0% obtained for SGT-052 and SGT-053. On this basis, a high efficiency of 10.89% was achieved for SGT-031 through cosensitization.


Phenothiazine based donor. 
Phenothiazine is a nitrogen and sulfur hybridized heteroanthracene, exhibiting strong electron donating character. Its butterfly-like configuration endows it with inherent outstanding anti-aggregation ability. These excellent properties thus make phenothiazine and its derivatives promising donor candidates for developing efficient porphyrin sensitizers. In recent years, many reports have been focused on the structural optimization of the phenothiazine moiety to excavate its profound potential as an electron donor for porphyrin dyes. In 2015, Ju and Zheng et al. employed a phenothiazine donor attached with a long alkyl chain to construct porphyrin dye JA1 (Fig. 23), achieving an efficiency of 5.7%.173 In continuation of the JA-series, spirobifluorene was introduced into the phenothiazine donor to enhance its anti-charge recombination ability.86 As a result, the DSSCs based on JA3 (Fig. 23) exhibit a remarkably enhanced VOC of 800 mV, with an improved efficiency of 6.3%. Additionally, the introduction of a BTD unit in JA4 (Fig. 23) was observed to further enhance the efficiency to 7.0%.
 Fig. 23  Chemical structures of representative porphyrin dyes containing a substituted phenothiazine donor. 
The efficiencies of the JA-series dyes are moderate although they exhibit good anti-charge recombination abilities, which may be ascribed to their inferior direct linking between the phenothiazine donor and the porphyrin ring. Similarly, porphyrin dye XW9 also contains a phenothiazine donor directly linked to the porphyrin macrocycle, and it exhibits an efficiency of 8.2%, while XW10, with an ethynylene unit inserted between phenothiazine and porphyrin macrocycle, exhibits a higher efficiency of 8.6% (Fig. 23).39 On this basis, structural optimization on the phenothiazine donor was systematically investigated to enhance the steric hindrance and hence improve the photovoltaic performance. Replacement of the hexyl chain attached at the N atom of phenothiazine with bulkier 2,6-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl and 4-hexyloxyphenyl units results in suppressed dye aggregation and charge recombination, and higher efficiencies of 9.1% and 9.5% were realized for the corresponding porphyrin dyes XW36 and XW38 (Fig. 23), respectively.129
Inspired by the successful results and to further excavate the profound potential of phenothiazine-based donors, Xie et al. then designed and synthesized a series of novel doubly strapped porphyrin dyes XW48–XW51 (Fig. 23) with the substituents on the phenothiazine donor systematically optimized with the purpose of further suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination.154 Gradually improved VOC values of 730, 753, 755, 761, and 781 mV, as well as enhanced efficiencies of 9.3%, 9.5%, 9.7%, 10.1% and 11.1%, were achieved for individual dyes XW40, XW49, XW48, XW50 and XW51, respectively, using the iodine electrolyte (Fig. 24). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses demonstrated that the charge recombination between I3− in the electrolyte and the injected electrons in TiO2 can be effectively suppressed after introducing additional alkoxyl chains in the donor moiety, and the bulky donor in XW51 with evenly distributed alkoxyl chains is more favorable than the wrapped ones in XW49 and XW50.

In addition to introducing alkoxyl/alkyl chains for suppressing charge recombination and dye aggregation, modification of the donor with glycol chains has recently been demonstrated to be effective for constructing efficient porphyrin sensitizers. It was reported by Lin et al. in the study of organic sensitizers that trapping of Li+ ions with glycol chains can block I3− from approaching the TiO2 surface employing the electrostatic interactions between the dye-Li+ chelate and I3− ions, resulting in reduced charge recombination.174,175 Based on this background, two triethylene glycol chains were introduced into the phenothiazine donor of the control dye XW39 to afford XW42 (Fig. 23), and the influence of chain lengths has been investigated by shortening the substituents to diethylene (XW43) and ethylene glycol (XW44) chains (Fig. 23).159 Because of the stronger Li+ trapping abilities for the longer chains, higher VOC values of ca. 750 mV have been achieved for XW42 and XW43, as compared with those of ca. 740 mV for XW39 and XW44, and the highest JSC value was obtained for XW43 due to its appropriate substituent lengths for simultaneously achieving high dye loading amounts and efficient suppression of dye aggregation and charge recombination. As a result, XW43 exhibits the highest efficiency of 10.32% among these dyes.

3.3. Suppression by modifying the acceptor unit
In comparison with the systematic modification on the donor unit, introducing bulky substituents into the acceptor unit for suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination has received less attention. In fact, the substituent on the acceptor is also a crucial factor for modulating the photovoltaic performance. In 2009, Tan et al. introduced a hexyl substituent into the thiophene moiety of porphyrin dye PZn-T to afford PZn-hT (Fig. 25).76 Compared with PZn-T (Fig. 25), DSSCs based on PZn-hT exhibit an improved JSC, resulting in a higher efficiency of 5.12% than that of 4.25% obtained for PZn-T. This enhancement was ascribed to the fact that the hexyl chain can effectively suppress dye aggregation and prevent charge recombination of the Co3+ cations in the electrolyte with electrons injected in TiO2, leading to higher electron collection efficiency. A similar strategy has been employed by Xie et al. for improving the efficiency of the 2-diphenylaminothiophene donor-based porphyrin sensitizer YQ3 (Fig. 25).77 A hexyl group was attached to the thienyl ring of the acceptor of YQ3, and the resulting dye YQ4-based (Fig. 25) DSSC exhibits a higher efficiency of 5.0% relative to 4.4% obtained for YQ3. In 2016, Imahori et al. attached two butoxy (ZnPBAT-o-C8C4) or octyloxy (ZnPBAT-o-C8C8) chains at the 2,6-positions of the carboxyphenyl anchoring group of porphyrin dye ZnPBAT-o-C8 (Fig. 25), but inferior photovoltaic performance was obtained.176 They revealed that the additional alkoxyl chains will result in decreased dye loading amounts. Hence, lower efficiencies of 7.3% and 7.0% were obtained for ZnPBAT-o-C8C4 and ZnPBAT-o-C8C8, respectively, compared with that of 9.1% achieved for ZnPBAT-o-C8. Based on these results, they proposed that substitution positions of alkoxy chains should be rationally designed to improve the photovoltaic performance.
 Fig. 25  Chemical structures of representative porphyrin dyes with the acceptor unit functionalized with various substituents. 
To systematically investigate the influence of the types and positions of chains attached to the acceptor, Xie et al. designed and synthesized a series of novel porphyrin dyes XW26–XW28 (Fig. 25) bearing alkoxy or alkyl chains on the auxiliary BTD acceptor.177 The chains neighboring the benzoic acid unit in XW26 and XW27 seriously distorted the acceptor structures, with large dihedral angles of 57.2° and 44.0°, resulting in low efficiencies of 5.2% and 6.4% for XW26 and XW27, respectively. This phenomenon was further evidenced by the results based on porphyrin sensitizers XW33–XW35 (Fig. 25), with the efficiencies gradually decreased from 8.4% to 6.6% and 3.6% when methyl groups were introduced stepwise into the 2,6-positions of the carboxyphenyl anchoring group.94 On the other hand, when a single alkyl chain was introduced into the BTD unit at the position neighboring the ethynylene moiety, no obvious aggravation of distortion was observed for XW28. As a result, a higher VOC of 711 mV and an improved efficiency of 9.12% were obtained for XW28, compared with the benchmark dye XW11. Along this line, a high efficiency of 10.2% was achieved for porphyrin sensitizer XW46 which bears a multiple chain-wrapped phenothiazine donor and a single chain substituted BTD unit, and the efficiency was further improved to 10.4% for XW47 due to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induced by a fluorine atom attached at the carboxyphenyl moiety (Fig. 25).178
4. Molecular engineering on anchoring groups
The anchoring group plays a pivotal role in grafting the dye onto the TiO2 surface, whose physical and chemical characters are essential for electron injection, adsorption geometry, long-term stability, and hence photovoltaic performance of the dye.179,180 To date, the most frequently used anchoring groups for porphyrin sensitizers are carboxyl groups. Through a coordination mechanism, the carboxyl group can strongly adsorb onto the TiO2 surface in a bidentate mode, providing good electron communication between the dye and TiO2 semiconductor.181,182 In addition, because of its excellent electron-withdrawing capability, the carboxyl group also can function as an electron acceptor that promotes intramolecular charge transfer and can thus facilitate electron injection. A majority of remarkable porphyrin sensitizers, such as SM315 and XW11, were assembled with a carboxyl anchoring group conjugated with a phenyl ring. However, considering the dissociation tendency for the carboxyl group under the exposure of trace quantities of water, there is still a high demand for developing novel anchoring groups for realizing long-term device durability. In recent years, many research studies on optimizing the anchoring groups have been reported,183–189 and some valuable studies are highlighted here to provide further insight into promising design strategies for further developing porphyrin dyes.
In 2011, on the basis of porphyrin dye ZnPH, Imahori et al. introduced four electron-deficient fluorine atoms into the carboxyphenyl anchoring group to afford sensitizer ZnPF with a more electron-withdrawing anchoring group,190 which exhibits a broadened Soret band and red-shifted Q bands resulting from the enhanced ICT effects (Fig. 26). The ZnPF-based DSSCs exhibit a moderate efficiency of 4.6%, which is lower than that of 6.9% achieved for ZnPH. A tilted adsorption geometry of ZnPF on TiO2 was inferred as a result of interactions of TiO2 with both the carboxylic group and fluorine atoms, leading to insufficient surface coverage, faster charge recombination, and hence lower JSC and efficiency (Fig. 27). Similar results were also reported in 2013 by D’Souza et al. They investigated the effect of carboxyl group orientation on the photovoltaic performance.191 It was found that the carboxyl anchoring group at the ortho position of the meso-phenyl unit leads to almost flat orientation of the porphyrin framework on the TiO2 surface, resulting in faster charge recombination for 1o-Zn, compared with the corresponding para and meta derivatives, 1p-Zn and 1m-Zn (Fig. 26), which was revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy data. As a result, an efficiency of 0.4% was obtained for 1o-Zn, dramatically lower than those of 3.1% and 4.2% achieved for 1p-Zn and 1m-Zn, respectively. These results as well as many other studies revealed an important molecular design requirement that the position of the anchoring group should be carefully considered for high packing density and effective suppression of charge recombination.66,173,186,189,192

Cyanoacrylic anchoring groups are widely used in organic sensitizers, but usually show moderate performance in porphyrin sensitizers. To get insight into the effect of cyanoacrylic and carboxylic acid groups on the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin sensitizers, a series of dyes XW5–XW8 (Fig. 26) were designed and synthesized.193 Compared with the efficiency of 7.1% achieved for XW1 which contains a carboxyl anchoring group, a lower efficiency of 5.8% was obtained for XW7 functioned with a cyanoacrylic anchoring group, despite its slightly enhanced light-harvesting ability. The inferior cell performance for XW7 was interpreted by its aggravated dye aggregation, and the floppy structural and free rotation feature of the cyanoacrylic group, which might lead to the tilted adsorption on the TiO2 surface, hence faster charge recombination as discussed above. Dye XW8 was further designed and synthesized on the basis of XW1, with an additional cyano group introduced into the ortho-position of the carboxyl group. As a result, a higher efficiency of 7.6% was achieved for XW8 due to the enhanced ICT effect.
Recently, Imahori et al. reported the syntheses of YD2-o-C8 analogues, YD2-o-C8T, YD2-o-C8HA and ZnPSi2 (Fig. 26), incorporating robust tropolone, hydroxamic acid and triethoxysilyl anchoring groups, respectively.194–196 Among these dyes, YD2-o-C8T shows the best light-harvesting capability with the absorption onset wavelength reaching 700 nm and the IPCE onset reaching 800 nm, due to the strong electron-withdrawing character of the tropolone unit. DSSCs based on the sensitizers containing the novel anchoring groups show significantly improved long-term durability due to the superior binding stabilities. For instance, YD2-o-C8 was almost quantitatively dissociated from TiO2 while over 95% of YD2-o-C8T was retained after 8h treatments under either acidic (AcOH) or alkaline (NaOH) conditions (Fig. 28), corroborating the more robust binding ability of the tropolone group than the conventional carboxylic acid group. Consistently, superior long-term stability was observed for the YD2-o-C8T-based device than that of YD2-o-C8. After 500 h of continuous one sun illumination at 25 °C, their efficiencies were decreased by 13% and 33% respectively. Despite the superior stability, the efficiency of 7.7% obtained for YD2-o-C8T is inferior to that of 8.8% for YD2-o-C8 under the same iodine electrolyte conditions. Hence, further improvement of the efficiency is desired to make the tropolone anchoring group more competitive.

Similarly, Yeh et al. reported that introduction of a 2-carboxylpyridine anchoring group into porphyrin dye MH1 (Fig. 26) improved the long-term stability of the cells while sustaining photovoltaic performance comparable to that of YD2-o-C8T.197
5. Intermolecular engineering strategies
As shown above, the facile structural modification characters of porphyrins provide infinite possibilities for tailoring their physical and chemical properties to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, but some inherent disadvantages, such as the intrinsic absorption defects around 550 nm and the adsorption vacancies between porphyrin dyes are relatively difficult to solve through molecular engineering on the structures of porphyrin dyes.41,198 Herein, we will briefly describe two intermolecular engineering strategies conducted in the cell fabrication process for improving the photovoltaic performance, and the recently reported novel concerted companion, a new class of dyes featuring panchromatic absorption by covalently linking two complementary dye units. The related progress, challenges and limitations will be introduced and discussed.
5.1. Coadsorption
Some bulky organic compounds, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (Fig. 29), are frequently added as coadsorbents into the dye bath solution for coadsorption with porphyrin sensitizers in the cell fabrication process. These additives could fill the adsorption vacancies between porphyrin dyes, make the dye monolayer on the TiO2 films more compact to impede the cations/anions in the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface followed by recombination with the injected electrons. On the other hand, their steric hindrance may suppress porphyrin molecules from intermolecular aggregation, decreasing the non-irradiative deactivation pathway of the excited porphyrin dyes. Moreover, addition of the coadsorbents usually negative-shifts the quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 semiconductor. Therefore, coadsorption is an effective strategy for simultaneously improving the VOC, JSC and FF of DSSCs in some cases.35,199–202
 Fig. 29  Molecular structures of DCA and CDCA. 
In 2009, Yeh, Diau et al. studied the influence of CDCA concentrations on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs sensitized with porphyrin dye YD1 (Fig. 21).142 They found that the dye aggregation was impeded upon coadsorption with CDCA, resulting in the improvement of both VOC and JSC values and hence higher efficiencies. At the dye/CDCA concentration ratios of both 1:1 and 1:2, the best efficiency of 6.0% was achieved, higher than that of 5.4% in the absence of CDCA. However, further increasing the CDCA concentration leads to deteriorated cell performance due to the displacement of YD1 by CDCA. In 2016, Mathew et al. reported an ullazine donor-based porphyrin dye SM63 (Fig. 30).156 Initially, a solution of SM63 (0.2 mM) and CDCA (0.2 mM) in a mixture of THF and EtOH (volume ratio of 1:4) was used for coadsorption. The best efficiency of 5.3% (VOC = 0.66 mV, JSC = 10.9 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.73) was achieved under the optimized sensitizing time of 30 min, and deteriorated cell performance was observed with further prolonged sensitizing time, indicative of aggravated aggregation. In the next step, the CDCA concentration was increased to tenfold (2 mM). As a result, slightly longer sensitization time of 1 hour afforded an enhanced efficiency of 5.9% (VOC = 0.71 mV, JSC = 12.6 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.67), with both VOC and JSC values improved. And the efficiency was further improved to 7.4%, the best result in this research, after changing the sensitizing solvent to toluene/EtOH (1:1).
 Fig. 30  Molecular structure of porphyrin dye SM63. 
A significant effect of CDCA was also evidenced in the study of XW26–XW28 (Fig. 25) series dyes by Xie et al., in which simultaneous improvements of VOC and JSC values were observed for all three dyes through addition of 0.2 mM CDCA in the dye bath for coadsorption with porphyrin sensitizers, resulting in the improvement of efficiencies from 5.2%, 6.4% and 9.1% to 5.6%, 7.2% and 10.1% for XW26, XW27 and XW28, respectively.177 Furthermore, the decreased chemical capacitance (Cμ) and elongated electron times (τ) are consistent with their VOC variation after coadsorption with CDCA. In addition to the reports discussed above, CDCA has been employed as the coadsorbent for many other porphyrin-based DSSCs to elevate the photovoltaic performance.99 For example, in the case of the record efficiency of 13.0% for porphyrin based DSSCs so far, two folds excess of CDCA was also added into the SM371 solution in THF/ethanol (1:4).37
In spite of the successful examples, CDCA is a colorless molecule, and it adsorbs competitively with the porphyrin dyes but produces no photocurrents. Therefore, in some cases, negative effects were observed. In the study conducted by Yeh, Diau et al., three porphyrin dyes YD0–YD2 (Fig. 21) were coadsorbed with CDCA at three different molar ratios (Fig. 31).139 As a result, the CDCA has similar effects in the improvements of photovoltaic performance for both YD0 and YD1. However, the presence of CDCA slightly decreased the efficiency of YD2 from 5.7% to 5.4%. To get insight into the deep-rooted reasons, femtosecond fluorescence decay curves were recorded to analyze the dynamics of the electron injection process, revealing that the presence of CDCA has less effect on suppressing aggregation-induced energy transfer for YD2 than YD0 and YD1. On the other hand, the aggregation on the TiO2 surface can increase the rate of interfacial electron injection, and such rates for all three dyes were decreased when CDCA was added. As a result of the balance between the two factors, the yields of electron injection were increased for YD0 and YD1, but decreased for YD2 upon addition of CDCA. Hence, the contrary results were observed.

As mentioned above, the presence of CDCA can suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination, but on the other hand, it also unfavorably decreases the loading amounts of porphyrin dyes on the TiO2 surface. Hence, the coadsorption condition, such as the concentration and adsorption time, should be well optimized to achieve a suitable adsorption amount and state in practical applications. On the other hand, for porphyrin dyes exhibiting intrinsic superior anti-aggregation and recombination abilities, such a coadsorption strategy may not be a suitable option.
5.2. Cosensitization
Partial coverage of the whole solar spectrum wavelength range realized for the absorption spectra of porphyrins remains an essential limitation for porphyrin sensitizers. To realize a panchromatic response, on the basis of the aforementioned molecular engineering approach for optimizing the porphyrin structures, an intermolecular engineering approach of cosensitizing porphyrin dyes with cosensitizers featuring different absorption profiles has been demonstrated to be effective for filling up the absorption defects of porphyrin dyes so as to improve the JSC values. Meanwhile, the cosensitization approach can suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination as coadsorption does, and thus enhance the photovoltaic performance.

5.2.1 General consideration. 
Cosensitization is a complicated process, and a set of fabrication conditions require careful consideration and practical optimization in order to obtain successful results.41 The first and foremost step is scrutiny of cosensitizers. After continuous investigations, various classes of dyes have been employed as cosensitizers in porphyrin based DSSCs, such as ruthenium sensitizers,152 metal free organic sensitizers,145 and even porphyrin sensitizers with different absorption characters.106 Among them, metal free organic sensitizers are the most extensively used. Generally, small-sized cosensitizers exhibiting broad absorption bands below 500 nm are favorable for compensating for the narrow Soret band of porphyrin sensitizers, and fitting into the adsorption vacancies between porphyrin dyes to produce densely packed dye monolayers on the TiO2 surface, while large-sized cosensitizers featuring more complementary absorption to those of porphyrin dyes can effectively improve overall absorption. After selecting a suitable cosensitizer, it is also important to select a cocktail or sequential adsorption procedures. For the cocktail approach, the TiO2 film is immersed into a cocktail-like solution of porphyrin and cosensitizer to adsorb them simultaneously. The sequential approach involves two sequential sensitizing steps: adsorbing the TiO2 surface with one sensitizer followed by immersing into another dye solution where the previously adsorbed dye may be partly desorbed, accompanied by the adsorption of the second dye. Porphyrin dyes, owing to their large molecular sizes, are usually used in the first step, while cosensitizers with smaller sizes or stronger anchoring capabilities are more capable to fit into the adsorption vacancies and adsorb competitively with the pre-adsorbed dyes. On the other hand, cosensitization solvents also play crucial roles in the cosensitizing process and should be carefully selected. In practice, molecular ratios of different sensitizers in the cocktail solution and the sensitization time for each dye in the sequential approach require systematical optimization to achieve the best cosensitization effects.
There are three absorption deficient regions for porphyrin dyes: below the Soret band (blue region), between the Soret and Q bands (green region) and beyond Q bands (NIR region). According to the different absorption ranges of the cosensitizers, they can be divided into three categories, which will be described in the following subsections.


5.2.2 Cosensitizers with two complementary absorption bands in the blue and green regions. 
Up to now, the vast majority studies on cosensitization have focused on compensating for the absorption defect in the green region of porphyrin dyes. To this end, a variety of organic sensitizers with absorption maxima in the 500–550 nm range have been developed as efficient cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes, such as D205,203Y123,204WS-5,205XS3,206 and SGT-121207 (Fig. 32).
 Fig. 32  Molecular structures of representative organic cosensitizers. 
In 2010, Grätzel, Diau et al. revealed that organic dye D205 showing a broad spectral response around 530 nm is effective for compensating for the IPCE valley of porphyrin dye YD2 (Fig. 21) in the 480–630 nm range.163 After cosensitizing YD2 with D205 by the sequential approach, a panchromatic light response feature was realized for the cosensitized device, resulting in a 20% enhancement in JSC and an increase in efficiency from ca. 5.7% for the individual dyes (D205 and YD2) to 6.9%. Similarly, by cosensitization with organic dye Y123 in a cocktail approach, the IPCE valley around 550 nm for porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 was filled up, and the power conversion efficiency was improved from 11.9% for individual YD2-o-C8 to a record efficiency of 12.3% at that time, with the JSC increased from 17.3 to 17.7 mA cm−2 (Fig. 33).145 The decrease in VOC is consistent with the commonly observed phenomenon that the VOC for a cosensitization system of a porphyrin and an organic sensitizer usually lies between those of the individual dye-based devices, which limits further improvement of the device performance.

In 2012, Diau, Lin et al. reported another sequential cosensitization system of a donor free porphyrin dye LD12 with an organic dye CD5 featuring a spiral configuration (Fig. 34).208 As expected, the JSC was enhanced from 14.97 (LD12) and 11.12 (CD5) to 16.74 mA cm−2 upon cosensitization due to compensation of the IPCE valley for LD12 around 500 nm by the broad absorption peak of CD5 in this region. Interestingly, the VOC of the cosensitized cell was remarkably increased from 711 (LD12) and 689 (CD5) to 736 mV (LD12 + CD5), which was interpreted by the intensity-modulated photovoltage spectra (IMVS). Upon cosensitization, the adverse effect of the slight positive-shift of the TiO2 potential is overwhelmed by the retarded charge recombination. Such a significant retardation for the cosensitized device was ascribed to the densification of the dye monolayers on the surface of TiO2, as a result of effective combination of LD12 and CD5. Consequently, an obviously higher efficiency of 9.0% was achieved for the cosensitization system of LD12 + CD5 relative to those of 7.5% and 5.7% obtained for the individual LD12 and CD5 dyes, respectively.
 Fig. 34  Molecular structures of representative porphyrin dyes and their cosensitizers featuring complementary absorption. 
The cosensitization approach was also applied to the π-extended porphyrin dye LD31 (Fig. 31) featuring light-harvesting ability beyond 800 nm by Diau, Lin et al.209 Better photovoltaic performance was also achieved for the LD31 + AN-4 (Fig. 31) cosensitization system (η = 10.24%, VOC = 704 mV, JSC = 20.27 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.718), compared with the individual dye based DSSCs (LD31: η = 9.95%, VOC = 699 mV, JSC = 20.02 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.711; AN-4: η = 4.44%, VOC = 692 mV, JSC = 8.85 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.726).
Xie et al. developed several organic sensitizers with complementary absorption spectra as efficient cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes. In 2014, the organic sensitizer C1 demonstrating a high VOC (780 mV) and a broad absorption peak around 500 nm was employed as the cosensitizer for porphyrin dyes XW1–XW4 (Fig. 34).153 As expected, the low IPCE values around 500 nm were improved for all four porphyrin dyes upon cosensitization. As a result of synergistically improved VOC and JSC, higher efficiencies of 8.96%–10.45% were obtained for the cosensitized cells of XW1–XW4 + C1 relative to the corresponding individual dye-based cells. With the purpose of simultaneously enhancing light harvesting abilities in both blue and green regions, a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based organic dye XS3 (Fig. 34) was developed and employed as the cosensitizer to dramatically improve the efficiencies from 7.32% (XW3) and 7.94% (XW4) to 10.45% and 10.75% for the cosensitized cells of XS3 + XW3 and XS3 + XW4, respectively.206 Since XS3 exhibits two distinct broad absorption peaks in both 350–450 and 450-600 nm wavelength ranges, the IPCE valleys of XW3 and XW4 in these two regions have been fully filled up, consistent with the remarkable increase of JSC upon cosensitization. Cosensitizer XS3 was also used to effectively improve the efficiency of porphyrin dye XW8 (Fig. 27) from 7.59% to 9.31%.193
Bearing in mind that the characters of high VOC and high efficiency of the cosensitizer may be more favorable for cosensitization, an indoline donor-based organic sensitizer WS-5210 (VOC = 791 mV, η = 8.38%) was hence utilized to further improve the device performances of porphyrin dyes XW9–XW11.39 Upon cosensitization, high VOC values of 770–760 mV were achieved for XW9–XW11 + WS5, and likewise, their JSC values were improved with the maximum IPCE values reaching ca. 90%. Among these cosensitized devices, XW11 + WS5 afforded the best photovoltaic performance, with a record efficiency of 11.5% for iodine electrolyte-based nonruthenium DSSCs at that time, well above those of 7.8% for individual XW11-based cells and 10.6% for the cosensitized cells of XW11 + C1. In addition to the high efficiency, the cosensitized devices of XW11 + WS5 also exhibited high stability, retaining 86% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h of long-term light soaking. In addition, a series of π-extended organic dyes XC1–XC5 were synthesized as efficient cosensitizers.211 Through systematical optimization on the molecular structures, XC5 (Fig. 34) exhibited the best effects on improving the photovoltaic performance of the cosensitization systems, and a remarkable efficiency of 10.5% was achieved for XW28 + XC5.


5.2.3 Small-sized cosensitizers with a broad absorption band covering the blue to green region. 
Small-sized organic dyes have also been demonstrated to work well with porphyrin dyes in cosensitization. Benefiting from the advantage of their small molecular size and hence weak steric hindrance, such cosensitizers can be easily post-adsorbed into the interstitial vacant sites left by porphyrins on the TiO2 surface, which can densify the dye monolayer for suppressing charge recombination. In addition, their broad absorption peak around 450 nm is effective for compensating for both sides of the narrow Soret band of the porphyrin dyes.
In 2013, Chen et al. investigated the effect of a simple organic dye PTC6 as the cosensitizer for porphyrin sensitizer ZnP (Fig. 35 and 36).212 The individual dyes ZnP and PTC6 exhibit efficiencies of 7.4% and 8.2%, respectively. However, post-treatment of the ZnP-anchored electrode with a PTC6 solution for 1 h afforded an efficiency of 9.0%, which was further improved to 9.8%, 10.0% and finally the highest value of 10.1% when prolonging the cosensitization time to 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. Dye loading measurements revealed that the post-adsorption of PTC6 led to only tiny alterations on the dye loading amount of ZnP, indicating the possible spatial distribution that PTC6 was inserted into the interstitial sites of ZnP. In addition, the significant IPCE enhancement in the 500–630 nm and 350–450 nm region was consistent with the remarkable increase of the JSC value upon cosensitization, and the charge recombination resistance for cosensitized devices was increased as the cosensitization time was prolonged. These results indicate that small sized PTC6 can be used as an effective cosensitizer by filling the vacant adsorption sites between porphyrin molecules to retard charge recombination and enhance light harvesting capacities.

Recently, the profound potential of this strategy was deeply excavated by Xie and coworkers. Through coadsorption with CDCA and then cosensitization with PTC6, the efficiencies of porphyrin dyes XW33, XW34 and XW35 (Fig. 25) were dramatically improved from 8.4%, 6.61% and 3.62% to 9.32%, 8.49%, and 7.34%, respectively.94 Such an approach was also applied for further improving the relatively high efficiencies of 9.1%–10.0% obtained for the individual porphyrin dyes XW36, XW38 and XW39 (Fig. 23) to beyond 11.0%, among which the highest efficiency of 11.7% was achieved for XW36 + CDCA + PTC6 under the optimized conditions.160 In 2019, a high efficiency of 12.1% was achieved for iodine electrolyte-based DSSCs for the XW43 + CDCA + PTC6 system by employing the same approach (Fig. 37).159,213 In addition to PT-C6, other small-sized organic dyes, such as HC-A1,214,215HC-A3,84 and HC-A484 (Fig. 35), have also been reported to be effective cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes.

5.2.4 Cosensitizers for extending the light response towards the NIR region. 
Limited by the trade-off effect between the absorption wavelength range and photovoltaic performance, porphyrins with absorption further extended to the NIR region usually afford poor efficiencies. A promising solution might be application of the NIR-absorbing porphyrin dyes into a cosensitizing system to achieve efficient solar cells featuring extended panchromatic absorption spectra towards the NIR region. In 2012, Diau and Yeh et al. synthesized a porphyrin dimer YDD6 showing an extremely long IPCE onset wavelength reaching 950 nm to compensate for the absorption defect of porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 beyond 700 nm through the cosensitization approach.105 The efficiencies obtained for individual dyes YD2-o-C8, YDD6, and CD4 are 8.8%, 4.6% and 5.8%, respectively (Fig. 38b). However, when sensitizing the TiO2 electrode in the cocktail solution containing these three dyes, a high efficiency of 10.4% was achieved with the judiciously optimized YD2-o-C8/CD4/YDD6 molar ratio of 20/5/1. As evidenced in the IPCE spectrum (Fig. 38c), in addition to the high IPCE responses in the 400–700 nm region with efficiencies of 75–80%, moderate values of 40–45% in the 700–800 nm region and observable efficiencies in the 800–850 nm region where YD2-o-C8 lacks absorption were also attained, consistent with the JSC enhancement from 16.60 (YD2-o-C8) to 19.28 mA cm−2 upon cosensitization. Similarly, cosensitization of a porphyrin dye LD14 (Fig. 2) with an NIR-absorbing porphyrin dimer LDD1 (Fig. 10) also afforded an improved efficiency of 10.4% relative to the individual dyes LD14 (9.2%) and LDD1 (8.8%), with the onset wavelength of the panchromatic IPCE spectrum beyond 900 nm.106

In 2014, Lin, Diau et al. investigated the cosensitization systems of porphyrin dyes LD14, H2LD14 (free-base analogue of LD14) and an organic dye AN-3 (Fig. 39), with the aim of achieving panchromatic, NIR light responsive and high efficiency DSSCs.216 For the LD14 + H2LD14 cosensitization system, a broader light response in the NIR region and partly compensated spectral valley around 540 nm were achieved for LD14 in the IPCE spectrum, which was contributed by the split and red-shifted Q bands of H2LD14, but a lower JSC was obtained due to the decreased IPCE plateau (Fig. 39). Additionally, due to the low LUMO level of H2LD14, the VOC (698 mV) of the LD14 + H2LD14 cell is also lower than that of LD14. Decreased values of both VOC and JSC result in a lower efficiency of 8.31% for LD14 + H2LD14 than that of 9.25% for LD14. However, the efficiency of the three-dye cosensitization system (LD14 + H2LD14 + AN-3) was significantly enhanced to 9.72%, with VOC = 716 mV, JSC = 18.76 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.72. Compared with the two-dye cosensitization system, enhancements of both VOC and JSC for the three-dye cosensitization device are consistent with the negatively shifted band edge of TiO2 and the panchromatic IPCE spectra, respectively. These results provide a promising strategy for developing efficient panchromatic DSSCs with a NIR-response by cosensitizing porphyrins with NIR-absorbing dyes.

5.3. Concerted companion dyes
Although great successes have been achieved by cosensitization, the optimization on the cosensitization parameters is rather time-consuming, and the ratio and distribution of different dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film are difficult to control, which remain obstacles for further development of this strategy. To address these issues, Xie et al. recently developed a series of concerted companion dyes (CC dyes), a new class of dyes featuring panchromatic absorption, by covalently linking two complementary dye units.33 Initially, they synthesized a new organic dye Z2 as a cosensitizer for their recently reported efficient porphyrin dye XW51 (Fig. 23). Although the broad and intense absorption bands of Z2 in the blue and green regions perfectly complement the absorption defects of XW51, the cosensitization of Z2 with XW51 afforded unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance even after tedious optimization on the cosensitization parameters. As a result, the best efficiency was obtained to be 10.5%, lower than that of 11.1% achieved for the individual XW51 dye. Then, XW51 and Z2 were covalently linked to afford a series of CC dyes XW60–XW63 (Fig. 40a) with various lengths of bridging groups. They all exhibited panchromatic absorption over a large wavelength region of 300–700 nm (Fig. 40b). Among them, XW61–XW63 showed comparable high efficiencies of 11.6–11.7% while XW60 afforded a much lower efficiency of 8.8% because of the insufficient bridge length. Notably, an impressive efficiency of 12.4% was achieved for XW61 by using CDCA as the coadsorbent under the indoline electrolyte conditions. In addition, the CC dyes exhibited superior binding ability and long-term stability. Under acidic or alkaline conditions, ca. 80% of XW51 and Z2 were desorbed from TiO2 films within 20 min, while more than 60% of XW61 was still retained after a longer immersion period of 2 h. Accordingly, XW61-based devices showed enhanced stability with 93% of initial efficiency retained after 500 h of continuous light soaking, obviously higher than those below 87% observed for XW51 and Z2. On the other hand, the CC dyes seem to be much more complicated, but actually only the acceptor units of the dibromides (A1–A4, Fig. 40a) require extra synthetic steps comparing with XW51 and Z2. In addition, once the dibromides have been designed and synthesized, they can be used for synthesizing a variety of CC dyes. These results provide a promising approach for developing efficient, stable, and easily fabricated DSSCs (Table 2).

6. Stability and scalability issues concerning practical applications
In the earlier sections, we have described the strategies for improving the power conversion efficiencies, which are of high concern for the community at the present stage because a threshold value of 15% has been suggested for practical applications. Actually, aside from high efficiencies, long-term stability and scalability are two other critical requirements for industrial acceptance.
6.1. Long-term stability
The stability of DSSCs is a vital parameter for practical application. DSSCs have been demonstrated to be more stable than perovskite solar cells and some other third-generation solar cells.218–220 Device stability up to 8300 h at 2.5 sun has been reported, indicating the possibility of 10-year lifetime for DSSCs operating under outdoor conditions.221–223 But for commercial applications, they need to work like silicon-based solar cells that usually warrant 25 year durability.
The insufficient stability of the DSSC devices mostly comes from dye degradation and desorption, electrolyte leakage and changes, solvent evaporation, corrosion and dissolution of the cathode materials. On the other hand, some external factors, such as UV light, water, oxygen and thermal stress, also can accelerate the degradation of the devices.220
To further improve the long-term stability of DSSCs, various strategies and techniques have been developed. A UV filter is effective for alleviating the photochemical stress caused by UV illumination. Reliable sealing techniques are highly desirable to avoid electrolyte leakage, solvent evaporation, the invasion of water and air, and the separation of two substrates. Obviously, the commonly used hotmelt foils, such as Bynel 4702 or Surlyn 1702 (Dupont), are not robust enough. Mendes et al. developed a laser-assisted glass frit sealing technique. The DSSC device (0.196 cm2 active area) sealed by Surlyn 1702 suffered from 34% loss of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of aging in the climatic chamber, while the corresponding loss can be reduced to 2.3% for the glass sealed devices. They further applied this technique to produce a large DSSC panel of 1638 cm,2 which retained 86% of the initial efficiency after outdoor working for 47 days under an average illumination level of ca. 6 kW h m−2. To circumvent the stability issues caused by the liquid electrolytes, the developments of solid-state DSSCs are considered as a promising solution. Recent research studies on solid-state DSSCs have achieved considerable progress and efficiencies beyond 10% have been reported.107,224,225 But at the present stage, their efficiencies are still inferior to liquid electrolyte-based ones and hence further research studies in this respect are desired. On the other hand, the stability of dyes is also crucial. As the sunlight absorbers, the dyes are required to be stable enough to sustain around 108 redox cycle turnovers to realize 20 year operation of the DSSCs.226 However, dye degradation and desorption would occur under some conditions, such as UV light illumination, water contamination, OH− substitution and high temperature.227–231 Therefore, decreasing these unfavorable factors is one aspect of the matter, and the other is enhancing the intrinsic stability of the dyes, including chemical and adsorption stability. Usually, porphyrin dyes are stable enough over a long period of time, but the effects of the chemical structures on their photochemical stability still require further studies. As for the adsorption stability, the majority of efficient porphyrin dyes are anchored to the TiO2 surface through carboxyl groups, whose binding ability is considered to be moderate. Therefore, some novel approaches have been developed to achieve stronger adsorption. In this respect, a series of more robust anchoring groups have been developed to achieve superior TiO2 binding ability and long-term stability, such as tropolone (YD2-o-C8T, Fig. 26),194 hydroxamic acid195 (YD2-o-C8HA, Fig. 26), triethoxysilyl anchoring groups (ZnPSi2, Fig. 26), and 2-carboxylpyridine (MH1, Fig. 26). On the other hand, dual anchoring groups are also effective in guaranteeing more robust adsorption on the TiO2 surface and better device stability than the corresponding mono-anchor cases, which has been evidenced by a number of dual anchored dyes like the meso–meso directly linked porphyrin dimer m-ZnPD (Fig. 10), and the concerted companion dye XW61 (Fig. 40).33,232–235
6.2. Scalability
For commercial applications in DSSCs, the ability to produce porphyrin dyes on industrial scales should be carefully evaluated. Herein, the scalability of some representative porphyrin dyes is evaluated on the basis of the number of synthetic steps (NSS), number of column chromatography for purification (NCC), and overall yields (OY).236,237 Taking the commercially available compounds as the starting points, Table 3 lists the key starting materials, NSS, NCC, and OY for each dye. A common synthetic route for a porphyrin dye is connecting the donor, porphyrin and acceptor units via coupling reactions followed by hydrolysis. Hence, the corresponding values for constructing each units and their connection are listed. The synthetic complexity data indicate that porphyrin dyes SM315, SGT-021 and XW51 have similar NSS (11–15), NCC (10–15) and OY (∼0.5%), while YD2-o-C8 shows the lowest NSS (8) and NCC (6), and the highest OY (4.6%) among these dyes. The relatively high NSS and low OY of porphyrin dyes mainly originate from the tedious and low yield (8.3–9.1%) synthesis of the porphyrin unit, which highlights the importance of optimizing the synthetic route for the porphyrin units or developing commercially available porphyrin intermediates to improve the OY and reduce the NSS. In addition, with the increase of structural complexity, the NSS and NCC are further increased and the OY is decreased, which adversely offsets the improved efficiency. Hence, compared with SM315, YD2-o-C8 is more suitable for commercialization considering its much smaller NSS and NCC and higher OY, although YD2-o-C8 exhibits a slightly lower efficiency of 11.9% than that of 13.0% achieved for SM315. Hence, apart from developing highly efficient porphyrin dyes for DSSCs, decreasing the synthetic complexity is also essential for practical DSSC applications.

7. Porphyrin derivatives in organic solar cells
In addition to DSSCs, porphyrins and their derivatives with the inherent advantages of superior light-harvesting capability, structural versatility, good thermal stability and appropriate redox potentials are also promising materials in constructing organic solar cells (OSCs).238 To some extent, the design principles and strategies of dyes for DSSCs and active materials for OSCs are similar. Hence, some recently reported outstanding examples of OSCs are highlighted here.
OSC is another new generation solar cell that possesses the advantages of flexibility, large-area fabrication, light weight and low-cost, which have been developed rapidly in recent years. A typical OSC device consists of an anode, a cathode and an active layer containing donor and acceptor materials blended to form a bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which is sandwiched between the two electrodes. For fabricating high performance OSCs, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of donor and acceptor materials. As a class of excellent dyes in DSSCs, porphyrin derivatives may have enormous potentials in OSCs because of the similar material design concepts for DSSCs and OSCs. Indeed, many porphyrin-based active materials have been developed with excellent performance in OSCs.238
Due to the inherent electron-rich nature of the porphyrin core, porphyrin derivatives are commonly used as donor materials. In the development of porphyrin-based polymeric donor materials, Hsu et al. made a big breakthrough in 2014. They developed a copolymerization strategy to incorporate porphyrin units into a D–A polymer and synthesized a 2D conjugated copolymer PPor-2 (Fig. 41), by which a superior efficiency of 8.6% was achieved.239 In addition, porphyrin-based small molecule donor materials have also been developed rapidly in recent years.240,241 Impressively, Peng et al. synthesized and investigated a series of acceptor-donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type donor materials by using porphyrin as the donor unit and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor,242–244 and thus the optimized donor material DPPEZnP-TBO (Fig. 41) realized a high efficiency of 9.06% with a high JSC value of 19.58 cm−2 due to its broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) response (300–900 nm).242 Furthermore, by using DPPEZnP-TBO as the rear subcell donor material, Chen et al. fabricated efficient tandem OSCs with a high efficiency of 12.5%.245 As depicted in Section 2.1, meso–meso linkage of two porphyrin units through an ethynyl unit can effectively extend the absorption to the NIR region. This strategy is also effective for designing OSC materials. In 2017, Zhu et al. reported the first example of A–π–D–π–A type dimeric porphyrin-based small molecule donor CS-DP (Fig. 41) with light absorption dramatically extended to 1100 nm in the film.246 Consistently, the CS-DP-based OSCs showed an EQE extended to the deep NIR region with an onset wavelength of 950 nm, affording an efficiency of 8.29%. Recently, ternary blend OSCs have shown promise to achieve notable efficiencies.247,248 As reported by Peng et al. in 2016,249 by using 680 nm absorbing polymer PTB7 (Fig. 41) as the host donor, NIR absorbing porphyrin-based small molecule DPPEZnP-TEH (Fig. 41) as the second donor and PC71BM as the acceptor, the optimized ternary OSCs showed a record efficiency of 11.03% for ternary OSCs at that time. In 2019, Zhu et al. synthesized a DPP-ethynylene-bridged dimeric porphyrin donor DPP-2TTPb (Fig. 41). The DPP-2TTP:PC71BM based binary device showed an efficiency of 9.30% while the DPP-2TTP:DR3TBDTTF (20 wt.%):PC71BM based ternary device achieved a higher efficiency of 11.15% due to the enhanced absorption in the range of 550–700 nm and improved film morphology upon adding the second donor DR3TBDTTF.250

On the other hand, porphyrin derivatives are also applicable for developing acceptor materials. In 2017, Li et al. linked four perylene bisimide (PBI) moieties at the four meso-positions of a porphyrin ring through ethynyl groups to afford the acceptor PBI-Por (Fig. 41) that realized an efficiency of 7.4%, a remarkable value for porphyrin-based acceptor materials.251
In addition to the high efficiencies, porphyrin-based OSCs also show great potential for indoor application. In 2019, Zhu et al. used the two ethylrhodanine end cap-linked porphyrin monomer P1 (Fig. 41) as the donor material to fabricate binary OSC devices for ambient light harvesting.252 Under 300 lux illumination, the optimized P1:PC71BM based device shows a high efficiency of 19.2%.
8. Conclusion and future outlook
In summary, porphyrin is a versatile platform for developing high-performance sensitizers, and remarkable progress has been achieved in the past three decades as a result of the tremendous research efforts, especially on the judicious optimization of the molecular structures (Fig. 42). Attachment of electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties at the two opposite meso-positions of the porphyrin macrocycle has been historically demonstrated to be effective in promoting charge separation and electron-injection processes, which has been recognized as an infrastructure of high-efficiency porphyrin sensitizers. Absorption spectra of porphyrin dyes can be extended to the NIR region by incorporating additional chromophores, such as acene groups, aromatic heterocycles as well as porphyrin units. In addition, fused porphyrins and hydroporphyrins are two other types of porphyrin derivatives that show excellent absorption profiles, whose profound potentials have been increasingly exploited in recent years. Meanwhile, it should be noted that extension of π-conjugation will usually lead to aggravated dye aggregation and charge recombination, and decrease driving forces for electron-injection and dye-regeneration. Hence, this trade-off effect should be taken into consideration in the process of designing sensitizers. On the other hand, effective novel approaches have been emerging unceasingly for protecting porphyrins against the detrimental dye aggregation and preventing the I3− or Co3+ cations in the electrolyte from approaching the TiO2 surface to quench the injected-electrons. Protection of the porphyrin macrocycle has been evolving from the first generation of bulky tert-butyl groups to the second generation of long alkoxyl chains and to the recently developed double straps. Tailoring the donor moiety with steric substituents, such as alkyl/alkoxyl/glycol chains and spirobifluorene units, is vital for suppressing charge recombination, with the multiple alkyl chain-based bulky donors usually exhibiting excellent performance of dyes with different types of donors. On the other hand, functionalizing the acceptor unit with steric substituents is also helpful for suppressing dye aggregation, but the attaching position is crucial and hence should be carefully selected. Investigations on the anchoring group provide new solutions in terms of improving both efficiency and durability. Furthermore, intermolecular engineering like coadsorption and cosensitization is a powerful supplementary mean to fill up the absorption deficiencies of porphyrin dyes in various wavelength ranges, and thus several different types of cosensitizers have been designed and used to construct efficient DSSCs with panchromatic absorption. In addition, the recently reported concerted companion dyes provide a promising approach for constructing panchromatic and efficient dyes with the advantages of easy device fabrication, simple optimization, and excellent photostability.
 Fig. 42  The schematic illustration for effective molecular engineering strategies. 
Given the encouraging progress achieved thus far, further research studies on some underexplored issues deserve more attention in order to achieve high efficiency DSSCs in the future. It has been estimated that increasing the efficiencies of cobalt electrolyte-based DSSCs to 19% is possible by extending the light-response to 920 nm, matching the energy levels better and inhibiting electron-loss processes.253 Although efficiencies beyond 12% have been reported for a number of porphyrin dyes, almost all of them exhibit a poor light-response beyond 800 nm. Sensitizers featuring light-responses beyond 800 nm remain relatively unexplored, whose performance might be further improved through intra- and inter-molecular engineering, such as tailoring them with bulky donors, strapping them with circle chains, and optimizing the cosensitization conditions. Besides, development of novel efficient and convenient cosensitization approaches is essential to maximize the potential of this strategy. In this respect, the recently reported concerted companion dyes present a promising solution for developing efficient panchromatic DSSCs in a feasible, convenient and effective manner. In summary, more research efforts should be focused on the following points: (1) further exploration of novel and efficient NIR-response sensitizers; (2) exploration of more efficient strategies to suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination; (3) probing into the effects of dye structures on the electron-injection and dye-regeneration efficiencies in depth to provide more valuable theoretical guidance for rational molecular design; (4) developing anchoring groups with stronger binding ability for improving durability to meet the requirements of practical application without obviously lowering the photovoltaic performance; (5) developing more efficient cosensitization approaches or concerted companion dyes to simplify the complicated, tedious and unruly cosensitizing processes; (6) decreasing synthetic complexity of the dyes to improve the scalability; and (7) paying more attention to large area devices and solar modules for practical applications.
Although great challenges have been encountered in the avenue of developing highly efficient DSSCs, the advantages of nondependence on environmentally hazardous materials and noble metals, ease of fabrication, relatively long-term durability and applicability under both outdoor and indoor conditions still make DSSCs a possible solution for cost-effective and efficient photovoltaic technologies. In addition, the DSSC devices are also light-weight, flexible, and semitransparent, which make them attractive for constructing integrated photovoltaics. On the other hand, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a strong competitor with efficiencies greatly improved from 3.8% to 25.2% within the past decade.17,254 In this area, porphyrins have also been used in PSCs as hole transporting materials and additives for perovskite crystal control to achieve efficiencies of ca. 20%.255–259 Despite the high efficiencies of PSCs, poor stability related to the sensitivity to moisture and the presence of the toxic lead metal need to be fully addressed before real commercialization.218 In terms of stability and toxicity, DSSCs are more competitive, and more research efforts are desirable with the purpose of surpassing the efficiency bottleneck, thus promoting the development of DSSCs for practical applications. In addition, employment of porphyrin units in constructing efficient DSSCs and organic solar cells shares some common strategies, and thus research studies in these two directions will be mutually promoted in developing efficient solar cells for practical applications.

Broader context
In the process of developing efficient photovoltaic technologies with low cost to solve the increasingly serious energy shortage and associated environmental issues, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated from low-cost and eco-friendly materials with properties of flexibility, lightweight and applicability under both indoor and outdoor conditions have shown great potential and provided vast imagination space of applications like being integrated into buildings, automobile devices and portable electronic devices. But the efficiencies of DSSCs are still unsatisfactory for practical applications and have been stagnated for some time. To overcome the present difficulties, development of more efficient sensitizers is essential. In this respect, porphyrins with properties of outstanding light-harvesting capability and facile structure modification have shown profound potential. In this review article, we provide a summary of the progress in porphyrin dyes applied in DSSCs and highlight the effective molecular strategies for developing efficient porphyrin dyes as well as the intermolecular approaches for optimizing device performance. Meanwhile, porphyrin based organic solar cells are also briefly described.
