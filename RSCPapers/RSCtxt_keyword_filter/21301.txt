High catalytic activity of the two nitride CEs for the reduction of triiodide were proved by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel-polarization measurements. The DSCs based on Mo2N and W2N CEs achieved power conversion efficiencies of 6.38 and 5.81%, reaching 91 and 83% of the photovoltaic performance of the DSC using a Pt CE, respectively. This research paves a promising way to develop new CE catalysts and reduce the cost of DSCs.
1. Introduction
In pursuit of resolving increasing energy problems, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have stood out among various photovoltaic devices and have attracted significant attention since 1991.1–4 The counter electrode (CE) is a crucial component of a DSC, in which triiodide is reduced to iodide by electrons flowing through the external circuit. In general, Pt deposited on various substrates have been used as CEs in DSCs, which exhibit a high catalytic activity for reducing triiodide.5,6 However, limited reserves and high prices restrict the application of Pt in DSCs. To reduce the cost of DSCs, several alternatives have been proposed to replace the expensive Pt, two examples being carbon materials7–11 and conductive polymers.12–14 In addition, inorganic compounds (e.g., CoS, TiN) showing decent catalytic activity have been introduced in DSCs as CE catalysts.15–17
In 1973, Levy and Boudart first noted that WC demonstrated Pt-like catalytic behavior as a consequence of its unique electronic structure.18–22 Since then, this catalytic behavior has been found in many early transition metal carbides and nitrides. Besides WC, other transition metal carbides, such as molybdenum, vanadium, chromium, titanium, niobium and tantalum carbide, have also been applied in the hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and unsaturated alkenes.23–25 Since 2003, we have carried out systematic studies on CEs, including the optimization of Pt CEs.5,6 Recently, we synthesized three novel catalysts, Mo2C, WC and WO2, used in rigid glass-type DSCs as CEs, and they showed great catalytic performances.26,27 However, when these CEs on flexible polyethylene naphthalate films coated with tin-doped indium oxide (ITO/PEN) film were used in DSCs, we could not achieve an ideal conversion efficiency due to the poor bonding strength between the CE catalysts and the ITO/PEN substrate. To date, the common catalyst for flexible CEs remains expensive Pt. To resolve this issue, in this work, CE catalysts were extended from carbides to nitrides. Concretely, molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) and tungsten nitride (W2N) films on flexible Ti sheets were prepared using the sputtering method. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the Tafel-polarization technique were adopted to characterize the catalytic activity of the as-prepared Mo2N and W2N. An ideal photovoltaic performance was obtained for DSCs using the two nitride CEs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Mo2N and W2N electrode on flexible Ti sheet
A flexible Ti sheet (200 μm) was used as the substrate due to its excellent electrical conductivity, plasticity and resistance to the corrosive electrolyte. A multi-function magnetron sputtering deposition system (JGP-450) and radio frequency power (RF-500, Shenyang Zky Technology Development Co., Ltd.) were used to prepare the Mo2N and W2N. High purity Mo and W (99.99%, diameter of 60 mm) were used as targets. The sputter gas was Ar (99.999%) and the reactive gas was N2 (99.995%). The basic vacuum was below 3.50 × 10−4 Pa. The substrate temperature was set to 25 °C. During each experiment, the target was pre-sputtered at 120 W under the Ar atmosphere for 30 min (total sputter pressure of 2.0 Pa). Afterwards, the reactive gas, N2, was pumped in and then the total pressure was controlled to reach 4 Pa. Mo2N and W2N films on Ti sheets were thus obtained (the sputter time was 30 min). Without pumping in N2, Mo and W films on Ti sheets were obtained instead. The Pt CE was prepared according to our previous study.5,28
2.2 
          Cell fabrication
The DSC was fabricated with a photoanode (a TiO2 film sensitized by N719, Solaronix, Switzerland), a CE, and an electrolyte containing 0.06 M LiI, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile. The symmetrical cell was assembled using two identical CEs sandwiching the electrolyte, which was the same as the one used to fabricate the DSCs. The DSCs were used for the photocurrent–voltage test with an effective area of 0.2 cm2. Symmetrical cells with an effective area of 0.25 cm2 were used in the Tafel-polarization test and EIS experiments.
2.3 Measurements
Surface morphologies of the Mo2N and W2N films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Hitachi S-4800). XRD experiments were carried out with an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2400, Rigaku). The sheet resistance was obtained by a four-point probe resistivity measurement system (RTS-9, Probes. Tech.). CV was carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution that contained 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a BAS 100B/W electrochemical analyzer. Pt worked as the CE and Ag/Ag+ worked as the reference electrode. The photocurrent–voltage performance of the DSCs was studied under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (I = 100 mW cm−2, Solar Light Co., Inc., USA) with a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). EIS experiments were characterized by symmetrical cells using a computer-controlled potentiostat (Zenium Zahner, Germany) in darkness. The measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz with the ac amplitude set to 10 mV. Tafel-polarization curves were measured with an electrochemical workstation system (LK-9805, Tian Jin Lanli, Inc.). The scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          XRD characterization of the as-prepared Mo2N and W2N
In Fig. 1, the solid line shows that the diffraction peaks at 38.28, 42.90, 62.88, 76.02 and 80.02° are assigned to the crystal planes [111], [200], [220], [311] and [222] for γ-Mo2N, respectively (025-1366 PDF2 database). In the case of W2N (dashed line), the diffraction peaks at 38.40, 43.16, 62.28 and 76.13° are assigned to the crystal planes [111], [200], [220] and [311], respectively (025-1257 PDF2 database). The remaining diffraction peaks are assigned to the crystal planes [100], [002], [101], [102], [103], [201] and [004] of the Ti sheet. The XRD results demonstrate that Mo2N and W2N films on Ti sheets have been prepared successfully.

3.2 Morphologies of the (a) Mo2N and (b) W2N films
To characterize the morphologies of the as-prepared Mo2N and W2N films, SEM was carried out. Fig. 2a and 2b show the surface morphologies of the sputtered Mo2N and W2N films. The nitride films are accumulated with nanoparticles that endow the nitrides with a high catalytic activity. The thickness of the Mo2N film is approximately 650 nm and that of the W2N is 500 nm, according to SEM images of the nitrides’ cross-section (Fig. 2c and 2d). As shown in Table 1, the sheet resistance of the pure Mo film is 0.4 Ω □−1. For Mo2N, the sheet resistance is 6.9 Ω □−1, indicating that the nitrogen atoms diffuse into the Mo lattice. In the process of Mo2N formation, electron transfer occurred between N and Mo atoms, which can change the electronic structure of the parent metal and provide the Mo2N with the peculiar characteristics of a noble metal.18–22 The sheet resistance of W and W2N are 0.5 and 8.1 Ω □−1, respectively. Mo and W nitrides were synthesized successfully and expected to function as effectively as Mo and W carbides as CE catalysts in DSC systems.

3.3 
          Cyclic voltammetry of the Mo2N and W2N electrodes for the triiodide/iodide redox couple

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a powerful tool to determine the catalytic activity of catalysts. Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms of Pt, Mo2N and W2N electrodes for the triiodide/iodide redox couple. As for the Pt electrode, two typical pairs of redox peaks were observed. The cathodic peak at 0.58 V can be assigned to the reaction of eqn (1), while the peak at −0.06 V can be assigned to the reaction of eqn (2). In the case of Mo2N and W2N, a cathodic peak at a relatively negative potential (0.54 V), according to the reaction of eqn (1), is observed. The current density for the Mo2N and W2N electrodes is larger than that of the Pt electrode. On the other hand, the cathodic peak referring to the reaction of eqn (2) is absent, and is replaced by a downward slope in the range from −0.1 to −0.3 V. The non-observed redox pairs may be covered by a background current, similar to previous results.17,29 The CV results indicate that the Mo2N and W2N electrodes can effectively catalyze the reduction of triiodide to iodide. 3I2 + 2e− ⇄ 2I−3(1) I−3 + 2e− ⇄ 3I−(2)
3.4 Photovoltaic performance of the DSCs using Mo2N and W2N CEs

Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSCs using Mo, W, Mo2N and W2N CEs. According to Table 1, when Mo and W are used as CEs, the DSCs give poor power conversion efficiencies (η) of 0.30 and 0.19%, respectively. In contrast, when using Mo2N CE, a higher η value of 6.38% is obtained. Changing from Mo CE to Mo2N CE improves the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 2.59 to 14.09 mA cm−2, reflecting that Mo2N is more effective than Mo at catalysing the reduction of triiodide to iodide. On the other hand, DSC using the W2N CE reaches a high η value of 5.81%. When Mo2N and W2N were used as CEs, the Jsc, open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and η value of the DSCs all improved significantly compared with those of the DSCs using Mo and W CEs. The η value of the DSCs using Mo2N and W2N CEs reached 91 and 83% of the photovoltaic performance of the DSC with a Pt CE (7.01%), respectively. The photovoltaic results indicate that the Mo and W nitrides show themselves to have a Pt-like catalytic behavior.

In addition, we observed that Voc of the device based on a W2N CE was higher than that of the device based on a Mo2N CE, and that Voc had a close relationship with the charge transport resistance (Rt), according to eqn (3). (3)where R0 is equal for all DSCs, EF is the Fermi level of the TiO2 anode, EC is the bottom of the conduction band of the TiO2 anode, EF,redox is the Fermi level of the electrolyte, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, V is the bias voltage, e− is the elementary charge and A is a constant.30,31
In order to investigate the higher Voc of the DSC using W2N CE (compared with that of the DSC using Mo2N CE), EIS measurements with two DSCs using Mo2N and W2N as CEs were carried out. Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of the DSCs. In Fig. 5b, the equivalent circuit comprises a series resistance (Rs), a charge transfer resistance and the corresponding capacitance of the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface (Rct, Cμ), a charge transfer resistance and the corresponding capacitance of the CE/electrolyte interface (RCE, CCE), the diffusion impedance of the redox couple (Zw), and Rt, which is employed to describe the resistance to electron transport through the TiO2 nanocrystalline film. After fitting the Nyquist plots of the two DSCs, one using a Mo2N CE and the other a W2N CE (Mo2N DSC, W2N DSC), the values of Rt are 157 Ω for the Mo2N DSC and 361 Ω for the W2N DSC. In contrast to the Mo2N DSC, the electrons in the W2N DSC suffer from a relatively larger resistance when they cross the TiO2 film. This causes a high electron density to remain in the conductive band of the TiO2; subsequently, the Fermi level rises. Based on eqn (3), we can deduce that the Ec value of the TiO2 anode for the Mo2N DSC is lower than that of the W2N DSC, assuming the same applied voltage for both. This confirms that in the W2N DSC, the Fermi level of the TiO2 is higher than that in the Mo2N DSC, leading to a higher Voc in the W2N DSC.

The dashed line box represents the comprehensive circuit of the photoanode. Rt (= rtL, where L is the thickness of the TiO2 film) is the electron transport resistance of the TiO2 film, Rct (= rct/L) is the charge transfer resistance of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and Cμ (= cμL) is the corresponding interface capacitance. RCE refers to the charge transfer resistance in the CE/electrolyte interface; CCE is the corresponding capacitance. Zw is the Warburg diffusion impedance of the redox couple. 
3.5 Characterization of the catalytic activity of the two nitrides by EIS and Tafel-polarization measurements
To prove the catalytic activity of the as-prepared Mo2N and W2N CEs, EIS was carried out with symmetrical cells fabricated by two identical electrodes.15 In Fig. 6a, for the Nyquist plots of the Pt symmetrical cell, Rs is determined by the impedance at high frequency where the phase is zero. The semicircle at the middle frequency is assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding capacitance (Cμ) of the Pt/electrolyte interface. The other semicircle at low frequency refers to the Nernst diffusion impedance of the redox couple in the electrolyte.32 The Rs values of the Mo2N and W2N electrodes are 1.1 and 1.8 Ω, respectively, which are both much lower than the Rs value of the Pt electrode (14.7 Ω). This could be attributed to either the high electrical conductivity of the Ti substrate or to the good bonding strength between the Mo2N or W2N film, and the Ti substrate, which in turn promotes the collection of electrons from the external circuit. This is consistent with a previous report on TiN electrodes.16 Moreover, the Rct value of the Pt, Mo2N and W2N electrodes are 6.3, 7.9 and 8.4 Ω, respectively, demonstrating that Mo2N and W2N electrodes can catalyze the reduction of triiodide to iodide as effectively as Pt. As for the Mo2N and W2N electrodes, the large Cμ values (Mo2N, 13.6 μF; W2N, 10.5 μF; Pt, 3.4 μF) indicate that Mo2N and W2N electrodes possess a large surface area, which promotes their high catalytic activity. In addition, a large Warburg diffusion resistance (Zw) is observed, owing to the mesoporous structure and to the thicker layer of the Mo2N and W2N electrodes (thicker relative to the thin layer of the Pt electrode). This indicates a lower diffusion velocity of the redox couple in the electrolyte. One can conclude that it is the Zw of the redox couple in the electrolyte that dominates the overall impedance in nitride-based devices rather than the Rct in the electrocatalytic process. This is the major reason for the relatively lower photovoltaic parameters of DSCs using nitrides CEs in contrast to those of DSCs using Pt.
 Fig. 6  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Tafel curves of symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes. The inset in (a) is the equivalent circuit diagram. 
In addition, to confirm the electrochemical catalytic activity of the two nitride electrodes, Tafel-polarization measurements were also carried out in a symmetrical cell in accordance with a previous report.27Fig. 6b shows the logarithmic current density (log J) as a function of the voltage (U). The slopes of the cathodic and anodic branches for the Mo2N and W2N electrodes are comparable to that of the Pt electrode, demonstrating a higher exchange current density (J0) on the surface of the nitride electrodes. This indicates that Mo2N and W2N can catalyze the reduction of triiodide as effectively as Pt, which is in good agreement with the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs based on the three CEs. Meanwhile, according to eqn (4), J0 varies inversely with Rct. For the EIS results, the change tendency of J0 on the Mo2N, W2N and Pt electrodes surface is generally in accordance with those obtained in the Tafel curve plots. (4)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide to iodide and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.
Furthermore, at a low sweep rate, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) depends on the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The Jlim values of the nitride electrodes are lower than that of the Pt electrode, which induces a relatively lower diffusion coefficient, as shown in eqn (5).15 This Tafel-polarization experiment is consistent with the EIS results. (5)where D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the space thickness, C is the concentration of triiodide, and F and n have their usual meanings.
4. Conclusions
In summary, two nitride (Mo2N and W2N) films on flexible Ti sheets were prepared by the sputtering method. They both showed an excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of triiodide to iodide. The DSCs using Mo2N and W2N as CEs yielded high efficiencies of 6.38 and 5.81%, respectively, that reached 91 and 83% of the performance of the DSC using a Pt CE. The developed flexible CEs may solve the problem of the poor thermal stability, high cost and low efficiency of flexible DSCs. Therefore, the results prove that these Mo2N and W2N catalysts are potential substitutes for expensive Pt. It is considered that this research will make the industrialization of DSCs more likely.
