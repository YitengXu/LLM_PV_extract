    , Accepted 2nd January 2018First published on 2nd January 2018AbstractBismuth ferrite BiFeO3 (BFO) is an important ferroelectric material for thin-film optoelectronic sensing and potential photovoltaic applications. Its relatively large band gap, however, limits the conversion efficiency of BFO absorber-based PV devices. In this study, based on density functional theory calculations we demonstrate that with well-designed Fe-site elemental substitution, tetragonal BFO can exhibit a much lower fundamental band gap than that of conventional rhombohedral BFO without forming in-gap electronic states and unravelling the underlying mechanisms. Cation atomic size, electronegativity, and crystallographic symmetry are evidenced as critical parameters to tailor the metal 3d–oxygen 2p orbital interactions and thus intrinsically modify the electronic structure, particularly, the shape and character of the valence and conduction band edges. With the reduced band gap, improved mobility, and uncompromised ferroelectric and magnetic ground states, the present results provide a new strategy of designing high symmetry BFO for efficient optoelectronic applications.
Developments in thin-film photovoltaic (PV) cells for solar energy conversion have played a major role in clean and renewable energy generation.1–3 Recent developments suggest the possible use of new mechanisms other than the standard charge separation based on p–n or p–i–n geometries. One such direction is the use of polarization induced charge separation at polar/nonpolar interfaces4–6 and intrinsic ferroelectric (FE) polarization within FE materials.3,7–9 Electric fields in ferroelectric materials can be extremely high, limited in principle only by the breakdown fields of the materials, and exemplified for example by the production of X-rays and high energy charge particles from polarization changes.10 Moreover, the fundamental point of interest lies in the fact that FE materials under typical light illumination have been shown to exhibit a short-circuit PV current parallel to the direction of the FE polarization axis and open-circuit photovoltages that are much larger than the band gap of the material. This is not possible for traditional photovoltaic semiconductors as they rely on in-gap electronic transitions between valence and conduction bands that necessarily limit the photovoltage.11–15 Among all the possible FE oxides, bismuth ferrite BiFeO3 (BFO) is of particular interest, partially owing to its superior built-in remnant polarization, high ferroelectric Curie temperature (TC ∼ 1103 K) and antiferromagnetic Néel temperature (TN ∼ 643 K).16 Since the seminal report of an unexpected giant PV effect in thin-film epitaxial BFO,2,17 this material has been extensively studied for PV applications.1,18–22 However, just like other oxide-based photovoltaic materials, a common problem exists as the power conversion efficiency of BFO absorber-based PV devices is limited by its relatively large band gap, which has been reported to be ∼2.7 eV for the rhombohedral phase.23–28 Consequently, photons with wavelengths of λ > 464 nm, which accounts for more than 80% of the solar spectrum, cannot be effectively absorbed. This means that the quantum efficiency will inevitably be much lower than the ideal Shockley–Queisser limit.1 Similarly, in developing sensing applications sensitivity to lower energy photons is desirable. It is therefore of significant importance to lower the band gap of the oxide without affecting its electronic and other unique functional properties to obtain solar energy conversion devices with a higher power conversion efficiency.
Currently, efforts have been devoted to narrow the band gap of oxides by employing various approaches such as chemical substitution,8,29,30 epitaxial strain,31,32 cation ordering,1,33,34 nanostructure design,35 He implantation,36 phase control,37 and orbital engineering.38,39 Dong et al. have studied the influence of uniaxial compressive stress and substrate on the band structure of BFO.19,21 Chakrabartty et al. have engineered the PV properties of multiferroic BiFeO3/BiCrO3 heterostructures by varying the thickness and number of respective bilayers.18 Nechache et al. have tuned the band gap of double perovskite multiferroic oxides by engineering the cationic ordering of Bi2FeCrO6.1 In general the large local electric fields associated with the polarization can provide a particular sensitivity of the band gap to the structure in Bi-containing oxides.40 Moreover, a great number of investigations of the optical properties of BFO have been carried out by substituting chemical elements at the Bi-site and/or Fe-site.41–45 However, most of these studies are mainly based on the rhombohedral phase, which crystallographically yields a higher energy position for the conduction band edge (thus a larger intrinsic gap) due to the antibonding B–O orbital interactions in the A point of the Brillouin zone in the ABO3 perovskite band structure.46 Therefore, a focus on a phase with a different symmetry (other than the bulk rhombohedral phase) might be a new strategy to explore the possibility of further lowering the fundamental band gap of this material. In the epitaxial BFO thin films, there are several other possible phases, i.e., monoclinic, triclinic, orthorhombic and tetragonal structures,47 among which the highly symmetric tetragonal phase (space group: P4mm) shows a large c/a ratio (up to 1.3)21 and a giant FE polarization in the region of 150 μC cm−2,48 thus rendering the tetragonal BFO a good candidate for efficient band gap reduction via the desired approaches and understanding of the underlying physical mechanism. In this study, using density functional theory plus Hubbard U correction (DFT+U), we show that the intrinsic band gap of tetragonal BFO can be effectively tuned by the designed substitution of the transition metal (TM) for the Fe-site without forming electronic in-gap states, and the underlying mechanisms involving both electrostatics and symmetry-related orbital impact are clarified in detail. The presented results will provide, from the crystal and electronic structure point of view, a straightforward picture and strategy for designing low band gap ferrophotovoltaics with enhanced optoelectronic performance for oxide optoelectronic applications.
Our calculations are performed with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) using the projector augmented wave method.49 We use the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange correlation functional.50 Spin polarized calculations are carried out for 2 × 2 × 2 supercells with a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point sampling in reciprocal space and a cutoff energy of 500 eV for the plane wave basis set. It has been reported that the tetragonal BFO has G-type AFM (G-AFM) and C-type AFM (C-AFM) spin configurations,51 both of which are taken into account in this study (see Fig. 1(a) and (b)). Three transition metal substituents are considered, i.e., Cr, Mn and Co, and the BiFe1−xTMxO3 (x = 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875 and 1.0; TM = Cr, Mn and Co) compositions are modeled by substituting TM atoms for Fe atoms in the supercell. The structural models for mixed phases are built by employing the special quasi-random structure approach.52–54 The schematic view of the considered structures for the BiFe1−xTMxO3 mixed phases is illustrated in Fig. 2. The on-site Coulomb repulsion between localized 3d electrons is taken into account via the DFT+U method of Dudarev et al.,55 and the effective U (Ueff) value of 4 eV, which is the commonly used value that has been reported to give reasonable results for BFO,51 is used for the Cr, Mn, Fe and Co 3d orbitals.

For the G-type AFM BFO, the optimized lattice constant a is 3.754 Å and the c/a ratio is 1.299, which are comparable to the experimental values (a = 3.78 Å and c/a = 1.237)56 and other calculated values (a = 3.67 Å and c/a = 1.264;57a = 3.769 Å and c/a = 1.31258) We also find that the energy difference between G-AFM and C-AFM BFO is very small, i.e., 6.7 meV per Fe atom, which agrees well with the results reported by Dong et al.47 The band gaps of G-AFM and C-AFM BFO are calculated to be 1.61 and 1.71 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the experimental measurements for tetragonal BFO films, which show an absorption onset at 2.25 eV and a direct gap of 3.1 eV.59 Our result is larger than the theoretical value obtained in local density approximation calculations of 0.29 eV,57 as may be expected. It is well known that the band gap of materials is generally underestimated by DFT; however, the trends predicted by this technique can still provide important information regarding how to systemically engineer the band gap of BFO through chemical substitution. Based on G-AFM and C-AFM BFO, TM elements are substituted for the Fe-site with different concentrations. Considering that the ground state for the substitution end member BiMnO3 is ferromagnetic (FM),60 the FM ordering for BiFe1−xTMxO3 is also considered in this work. The energy difference between the AFM and FM ordering for BiFe1−xTMxO3 is presented in Fig. 3. It is shown that the AFM ordering for Co substitution is energetically more stable than the FM ordering, while the situations for Cr and Mn substitution are a little different. In the case of Cr substitution, the AFM ordering is preferable in most cases except BiFe0.25Cr0.75O3 and BiFe0.125Cr0.875O3, for which the total energies are comparable to the FM state. As for Mn substitution, the AFM ordering is favorable as the Mn content increases from 0 to 62.5%, and the FM ordering is preferred for BiFe0.25Mn0.75O3, BiFe0.125Mn0.875O3 and BiMnO3. Hence, in the subsequent calculations, the FM ordering is considered for BiFe1−xMnxO3 (x = 0.75, 0.875 and 1.0) and the AFM ordering is considered in all other cases.

The variation of band gap for BiFe1−xTMxO3 with TM concentration is presented in Fig. 4. It is shown that substituting Co for Fe has relatively smaller influences on the band gap of BFO, and the maximum band gap narrowing of 0.14 eV is obtained for G-type BiFe0.625Co0.375O3 and BiFe0.375Co0.625O3. Band gap reduction induced by Co substitution has also been observed in the rhombohedral BiFeO3 thin film experimentally, for which Xue et al. found that 12% substitution of Co for Fe decreases the band gap by 0.26 eV44 and Peng et al. demonstrated that the optical band gap is decreased by 0.13 eV for 10% substitution.42 In the case of the Cr and Mn cations, the situations are much different and the band gap of BFO is reduced significantly. As Cr substitutes for the Fe-site in G-type BFO, the minimum and maximum band gap reduction are 0.34 and 0.74 eV, corresponding to BiFe0.75Cr0.25O3 and BiFe0.125Cr0.875O3, respectively, i.e., the band gap of BFO is decreased by about 21–45%. In the case of Cr substitution for the Fe-site in C-type BFO, the band gap decreases with the increasing Cr concentration and the complete substitution of Cr for Fe has the lowest band gap, for which the band gap narrowing varies from 27.9% to 60.5%. As for the Mn substitution, when the substituent content increases from 12.5% to 50%, the band gap reduction is comparable to the cases of Cr substitution; however, a remarkable reduction is found for BiFe0.375Mn0.625O3, for which the band gaps of 0.72 eV for the G-type and 0.48 eV for the C-type indicate that the band gap of BFO is decreased by 55.2% and 72%, respectively. For 75%, 87.5% and 100% substitution, the ground state is nearly metallic. Experimentally, Yan et al. also found that the band gap of Mn-substituted BiFeO3 decreases with the increasing Mn content and the Mn substituent can improve the optical properties of the BFO thin film significantly.45 Comparing the results of the BFO substituted with different TMs, we find that Cr, Mn and Co substituents have different influences on the band structure of tetragonal BFO, which may result from the differences in their electronic configuration, atomic radius and the orbital interaction between the substituent and its neighbors.

To understand the origin of the observed substituent concentration dependence in the band gap behavior for different TM cations, the first thing that needs to be checked is the lattice structure, which can influence the electronic structure significantly. We plot the variation of the supercell volume of BiFe1−xTMxO3 with the concentration of TM substituents in Fig. 5(a). It is noticeable that the substitution of Co for Fe in BFO causes slight changes in the volume, whereas Mn and Cr substitution result in much larger volume contractions. Han et al. have studied the substitution-driven structural changes in Mn-substituted BiFeO3 and found that the 10% substitution of Mn for Fe also causes volume contraction.61 Among the three substituents, the volume shrinkage caused by Cr substitution is especially remarkable, for which the volume is contracted by ∼9% upon complete substitution. These results are unexpected, since the atomic radii of Cr3+ (0.615 Å) and Mn3+ (0.58 Å) are relatively larger than that of Fe3+ (0.55 Å) and volume expansion is likely to be induced. We further analyze the structural properties of the optimized configurations and find that the change in volume is associated with the distortion and tilting of the fundamental TMO6 octahedral building-blocks. Atomic structure analysis indicates that Cr and Mn substitution induces more remarkable changes in ∠O–Fe–O and ∠O–TM–O bond angles than Co substitution, as shown in insets of Fig. 5(b). In bulk phases, perovskite BiTMO3 generally exhibits tilting of TMO6 octahedrons due to the low Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t < 1). This is a consequence of the small atomic radius of the A-site Bi3+ in 12 coordination geometry.62 With the decreasing size of the central metal cation, this tilting effect will be decreased due to the resulting increase of the tolerance factor, thus less octahedral tilting will be expected. For example, the tilting in BiCrO3 and BiMnO3 was found to be less than that of BiFeO3 and BiCoO3,63–65 which also agrees with our calculated results in Fig. 5(b). We also note that the tilting distortions and ferroelectric Bi off-centering both reduce the Bi–O nearest neighbor distances, and therefore compete with each other. Due to a similar ionic radius, when Co substitutes for Fe, the ∠O–Fe–O bond angles are thus only slightly affected and the ∠O–Co–O bond angles are comparable to the ∠O–Fe–O bond angles. On the other hand, Cr substitution has a stronger influence on the bonding properties than Co and Mn, due to the larger mismatch in atomic size between Cr and Fe. This induces a larger lattice strain in Cr-substituted BFO. This observation is consistent with our previous investigation66 that the suppression of the octahedral tilting and distortion decrease the octahedral and unit cell volume, as reflected in Fig. 5(a) and (b). These results indicate that TM substitution may lead to electronic redistribution, complex interatomic interactions and particular electronic structures. Furthermore, we verify that the spin ordering of the Fe and substituents has small effects on the volume, and the G-type and C-type BiFe1−xTMxO3 has a very similar volume for a certain substituent at each concentration.

As also reflected in the atomic models in Fig. 5(b), substitution induced volume and structural changes are expected to impact the cation shift of the central B-site atoms, thus influencing the dipole moment and ferroelectric polarization. For pristine unsubstituted tetragonal BFO, the central Fe3+ cation displacement is calculated to be δ = 0.71 Å, much larger than those of classic displacive ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 (δ = 0.11 Å) due to the supertetragonality and the strong driving force provided by the lone pair driven tetragonal Bi off-centering. Incorporation of the larger size Cr cation suppresses the distortion of the octahedral and results in a slightly reduced cation displacement (δ = 0.64 Å for Cr), while Mn and Co substitution lead to enhanced cation displacement (δ = 0.719 Å for Mn and δ = 0.703 Å for Co) due to the even higher tetragonality for matrix BiMnO3 and BiCoO3. The remnant ferroelectric polarization of strain-free epitaxial tetragonal BFO is reported to be 58 μC cm−2.67 Based on the composition and cation shift, the ferroelectric polarization values for Cr-, Mn-, and Co-substituted Bi(Fe0.375TM0.625)O3 are estimated to be 52.3, 58.7, and 57.4 μC cm−2, respectively. As summarized in Fig. 5(b), these polarization values correspond to changes of −9.8%, +1.27%, and −0.98% relative to the intrinsic BFO. This confirms that these elemental substitutions in tetragonal BFO do not significantly deteriorate the ferroelectricity, and thus the built-in polarization will not be compromised. The reason is that the large polarization is a consequence of the Bi driven super-tetragonality and the response of the trivalent transition element to this rather than the specific chemistry of the B-site ion.

Fig. 6(a–d) illustrate the electronic band structure for BiFeO3 and BiFe0.375TM0.625O3 (TM = Cr, Mn and Co). The calculations show that the tetragonal BiFeO3 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap, which is consistent with the experimental result.68 Comparing the electronic structure of BiFeO3 and BiFe0.375TM0.625O3, we find that the band structure of BiFeO3 is modified greatly by TM substitution. We here demonstrate an interesting result that the three studied cations represent three typical strategies for modification of the band structure of pristine BiFeO3. For the case of Cr, due to its relative higher energy of the 3d atomic orbitals (than that of Fe 3d), the energy level of the valence band maxima (VBM) is expected to be raised. Generally, in the valence band the bonding between the orbitals of oxygen and metal forms stable covalent chemical bonds with significant orbital hybridization between cation and anions (see ESI,† Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 6(b), the top of the valence band is indeed occupied by half-filled Cr 3d t2g orbitals, with a certain level of hybridization with O 2p orbitals. As a result, the bands of Fe 3d t2g are pushed down by 0.7 eV compared with pristine BFO due to the higher intrinsic energy position for Cr 3d atomic orbitals than that for Fe 3d atomic orbitals. This unique behavior has been observed in several other Cr-related matrix or substituted electronic systems.25,27 It should be noted that due to the orbital hybridization, this Cr-related state (with a 0.5 eV broad band dispersion) in the VBM is not separated as a single in-gap defect state but is partially overlapped with the mainstream O 2p dominated valence band, which thus can be considered as an intrinsic modification of the VBM. Together with the downward shift of the conduction band minimum (CBM) by 0.6 eV, a reduction of the band gap by ∼0.65 eV is obtained. In the case of Co substitution, the VBM levels are not affected much, however, the electronic states in the unoccupied bands show a significant modification, as presented in Fig. 6(d). The Co-derived bands show obvious localization, and appear at the bottom of the conduction band, thus pushing up the original Fe 3d eg driven CBM with a great suppression at the Γ point. This localized in-gap Co-band is also contributed by the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals with both nonbonding and antibonding characters (see ESI,† Fig. S1 and S2), and it can be considered as a shallow donor, since it is separated from the conduction band. As Mn substitutes for the Fe-site, the induced in-gap states show a higher dispersion (than that of the Co-case), thus modifying both the VBM and CBM and leading to a large gap reduction. Even considering that they are almost isolated within the middle of the gap, they have great potential to act as both deep and shallow traps for electrons.

The blue curves highlight the energy bands that are contributed by the intended dopants hybridized with the oxygen 2p orbitals. 
It is noted that from pristine BFO to Cr- and Mn-BFO that the change of the band structure mainly lies in the chemical substitution modified valence band, which typically consists of hybridized metal 3d t2g and oxygen 2p orbitals [ESI,† Fig. S1 and S2]. While the line shape of the conduction band is not significantly changed, there is an obvious downward shift of the CBM upon substitution, which is not expected from the pure electrostatics point of view. In the band structure of perovskite oxide, the Γ point reflects the nonbonding B–O interaction while the A point reflects the antibonding character. The contrast of orbital characters between the Γ and A points determines the CB width and the resulting band gap. As the central cation goes from Fe to Cr and Mn, the electronegativity (χ) decreases gradually (χFe = 1.83, χCr = 1.66, χMn = 1.55). This results in more ionic features and suppresses the covalency of the B–O bond, together with the suppression of both BO6 tilting and orbital distortion. It is expected that the antibonding character of the B–O bond will be suppressed, thus pushing the CBM to a lower energy position.46 For Mn substitution, the downward shift of the CBM, together with the upward shift of VBM, drives the fundamental band gap of Mn-substituted BFO into a smaller value, as observed. While for Co substitution, due to its larger electronegativity (χCo = 1.88), the electrostatic effects push the hybridized Co 3d–O 2p orbitals further up and induce significant modification in the conduction band, as reflected in Fig. 6(d). In addition to the substituting electrostatic effect, the fine structure change in the lattice will also contribute to the band gap reduction, as explained in the following discussion. Thus while the specific substitution is not key to the ferroelectric properties of the supertetragonal phase, it does strongly impact the electronic structure.
Further detailed electronic structure analysis indicates that in addition to the intrinsic electrostatic substitution induced modification of top of the valence band, the conduction band structure particularly the CBM edge also clearly exhibits changes, as shown in Fig. 6(e). As compared with pristine BFO, both the Cr- and Mn-substituted BFO samples demonstrate narrowed bands with a larger curvature. The CBM is composed of hybridized empty metal 3d eg with O 2p orbitals [ESI,† Fig. S1 and S2]. Increasing the band dispersion at the bottom of the CBM amounts to reducing the transport mass, which implies better mobility. This effect is more significant with the Cr-substituted sample (see green line in Fig. 6(e)). The increase of the carrier mobility in this case is not induced by the electrostatic effect as for the reduction of the band gap, and this modification of electronic structure reflects the change of the lattice structure. In fact, the key factor in this case is the octahedral tilting and distortion. Since BiCrO3 has less distortion with a larger metal–O–metal bond angle (than BiFeO3), substituting Cr in BFO helps to suppress the tiling and distortion of TMO6 octahedra, leading to suppression of the volume expansion and resulting in a better orbital overlap between the metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals with stronger hybridization. This orbital hybridization will contribute to both the reduced band gap (downward shift of the CBM) and enhanced mobility, as predicted by our calculations. The direct correlation between mobility and octahedral tilting is not easy to quantify and thus has rarely been reported. Recently, there is some experimental evidence in the context of hybrid organohalide perovskite solar cells, confirming that the suppression of the octahedral tilting by controlled cation substitution leads to ∼33% and ∼40% increase of mobility for both electrons and holes, respectively.39,69,70 It is also the case that the d band widths, W, in perovskites often decrease with tilting as has been discussed in the context of modulating the U/W ratio in the correlated electron physics, e.g. in ruthenates.71,72 In addition, these studies also verify that increase of the octahedral tilting leads to an increased band gap for organo-halide, which is also consistent with what we observed in inorganic perovskites. In consideration of the recently demonstrated correlation of magnetism with octahedral tilting,66,73 the present results further demonstrate the possibility of tuning the optical and electronic properties by the controlled distortion and tilting of perovskites.
To gain more direct insight into the influences of TM substitution on the optical absorption of BiFeO3, we further calculate the dielectric function of the BiFeO3 and BiFe0.5TM0.5O3 (TM = Cr, Mn and Co). The optical absorption coefficient α(ω) is obtained by , where ω is the angular frequency of the photon, and ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. Fig. 7 summarizes the optical absorption coefficient as a function of photon energy for the BiFeO3 and BiFe0.5TM0.5O3 (TM = Cr and Mn). A comparison of the calculated and experimental α(ω) for the tetragonal BiFeO3 is presented in the inset. It is shown that our computed α(ω) is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.23 As expected, when the TM substituents are introduced at the Fe-site, the optical absorption edge decreases, indicating that photons with lower energy can now be absorbed by BFO. In particular, when the photon energy is located within 1.2–2.5 eV, the α(ω) is strengthened by TM substitution, i.e., more significant absorption will occur in TM-substituted BFO. These observed red-shifts of absorption edges push the existing lower-bound limit of the BFO band gap towards the infrared regime, suggesting that well designed tetragonal BFO may offer excellent optoelectronic performance. In connection with the change of the energy position and shape of the VBM and CBM, substitution with Cr in the Fe-site seems to be able to intrinsically modify the electronic structure to improve visible light absorption without forming in-gap electronic defect states to compromise the subsequent dynamic and transport of the photoexcited carriers, which are desired for efficient device applications.

The practical application of BiFeO3 for thin-film photovoltaic cells in solar energy conversion requires lowering the band gap without influencing its other physical properties, such as ferroelectricity and multiferrocity. We have demonstrated that ferroelectric polarization is not significantly suppressed by TM substituting (Fig. 5(b)). In order to investigate the impact of transition metal substitution on the magnetic properties of BiFeO3, we calculate the average atomic magnetic moments for Fe and TM (TM = Cr, Mn and Co) and the total magnetic moment for BiFe1−xTMxO3. The results are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). For 12.5%, 37.5%, 62.5% and 87.5% substitution, in which the number of TM substituents is odd, the substituted systems are ferri-magnetic. The atomic magnetic moments for Fe in the considered three systems are comparable to each other. The Cr and Co show very similar atomic magnetic moments, which are much smaller than those for the high spin Mn3+ in BFO. The net magnetic moments for BiFe1−xCrxO3 are shown to be much larger than those of BiFe1−xCoxO3. For the 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% substitution, in which the number of TM substituents is even, it is interesting to find that the systems are all as antiferromagnetic as BiFeO3. Considering that these substitutions all reduce the band gap of BiFeO3 to different degrees, it is suggested that the band gap of super-tetragonal BiFeO3 can be lowered without strongly affecting its magnetic and ferroelectric properties by effective control of the substituent concentration.
In conclusion, we focus on multiferroic BFO with tetragonal symmetry and study the structural, electronic and optical properties of BiFe1−xTMxO3 (TM = Cr, Mn and Co) by DFT+U calculations. Through band structure and absorption analysis we demonstrate that with controlled substitution the tetragonal BFO can exhibit a much lower fundamental band gap than conventional rhombohedral BFO. It is found that parameters such as the cation atomic size, electronegativity, and crystallographic symmetry are critical to tailor the TM 3d–O 2p orbital interactions and thus modify the electronic structure, particularly, the shape, character, and energy positions of the VBM and CBM. For Cr and Mn substituents with a smaller electronegativity, increasing of the bond iconicity suppresses the antibonding characters of the B–O bonds, which lowers the energy position and decreases the width of the conduction band, leading to a reduced fundamental band gap and improved mobility. On the other hand, substituting the Co cation which has a larger electronegativity results in a significant modification of the character of the CBM (primarily Co-3d eg driven) with a less reduced band gap. The present results will provide, from the crystal and electronic structural point of view, a clear picture for designing low band gap ferrophotovoltaics with enhanced visible light absorption for oxide photovoltaic and other applications.
