    , Accepted 27th January 2020First published on 27th January 2020AbstractThe ternary strategy exhibits great potential in optimizing the photon harvesting and phase separation of active layers. In this work, non-fullerene MF1 was selected as the third component to prepare efficient ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) by finely optimizing the MF1 content in the acceptors. The optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.31% is achieved in the ternary OSCs with 20 wt% MF1 content in the acceptors and 100 nm active layer thickness, also exhibiting a relatively high fill factor (FF) of 78.05%. The relatively high FF indicates efficient charge transport and collection in the optimized ternary OSCs, which should be beneficial to achieve efficient thick-film OSCs. It is highlighted that a PCE of 14.57% is achieved in the optimized ternary OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers compatible with the roll-to-roll (R2R) large-scale printing process. To date, high performance thick-film ternary non-fullerene OSCs have seldom been reported. This work indicates that the thick-film ternary strategy has great potential in achieving efficient large-scale OSCs.

Broader context
Developing efficient OSCs with relatively thick active layers compatible with the roll-to-roll large area printing process is an inevitable requirement for the commercialization of this field. At present, the performance of thick-film OSCs is far behind that of thin-film OSCs due to the increased charge recombination probability in thick films. There remains a significant need to further improve the performance of thick-film OSCs to meet the requirements of practical applications. In this work, a ternary strategy was employed to fabricate efficient thick-film OSCs by using one polymer donor and two well-compatible non-fullerene acceptors. The optimized ternary OSCs with 300 nm active layers exhibit a PCE of 14.57% and a FF of 71.62%, which are among the highest values of OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers. To date, high performance thick-film ternary non-fullerene OSCs have seldom been reported. This work indicates that the thick-film ternary strategy has great potential in achieving efficient large-scale OSCs.

Introduction
Over the last few years, organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved rapid development based on rational design of new active layer materials, interface modification, and device engineering, leading to over 16% power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–4 These achievements herald a bright future for commercial applications of OSCs. Developing efficient OSCs with relatively thick active layers compatible with the roll-to-roll (R2R) large area printing process may be an inevitable requirement for the commercialization of this field.5–7 Up to now, most of the reported efficient OSCs were achieved with an active layer thickness of about 100 nm.8–11 Such thin films can be easily prepared by a spin-coating method to achieve efficient OSCs with high fill factor (FF), and are hardly prepared by R2R technology with high printing rates to form uniform and large area films for the potential application of OSCs.12,13 OSCs with thick active layers are preferred for sufficient photon harvesting and matching with the R2R fabrication technology. The recombination of photogenerated charge will be enhanced along with the increase of active layer thickness due to the relatively low charge mobility of organic semiconducting materials, leading to the inferior FF and PCE of thick-film OSCs.14,15 The optimized phase separation of thick active layers plays a vital role in determining the performance of thick-film OSCs with relatively high FF. It is commonly reported that the third component can be used as a morphology regulator to improve the performance of ternary OSCs; meanwhile, the photon harvesting of ternary active layers can be well optimized by adjusting the third component content.16–18 The ternary strategy may have an effect on the performance improvement of thick-film OSCs. Here, the recent developments of thick-film binary and ternary OSCs are summarized in Table 1.19–27 Thick-film ternary OSCs have exhibited some advantages in achieving high performance compared with binary OSCs, indicating that thick-film ternary OSCs might be the most promising candidates for meeting the commercial requirement of OSCs. Though several efficient thick-film ternary OSCs have been reported by different research groups, there are few reports on efficient thick-film ternary OSCs with non-fullerene materials as acceptors. It is worthwhile to highlight that thin-film non-fullerene ternary OSCs have achieved rapid development with FF over 75% and PCE over 16% by employing two non-fullerene materials as acceptors.28,29 The relatively high FFs indicate efficient charge transport channels in the ternary non-fullerene active layers, which should have great potential in achieving efficient thick-film OSCs by simultaneously optimizing phase separation and photon harvesting with two well-compatible non-fullerene materials.

This work




In this work, polymer donor (D) PBDB-T-2Cl, non-fullerene acceptor (A) BP-4F and MF1 were selected to prepare binary and ternary OSCs. The chemical structures of the used materials are shown in Fig. 1a. The normalized absorption spectra of the materials are exhibited in Fig. 1b, and the absorption peak of MF1 locates in between those of PBDB-T-2Cl and BP-4F, which should be beneficial to improve the photon harvesting of the ternary active layers by optimizing MF1 content in the acceptors. As shown in Fig. 1c, a series of OSCs were prepared with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al; the only difference is the MF1 content in the acceptors. The content of the third component MF1 was finely adjusted to optimize the photon harvesting and phase separation of the ternary active layers for achieving efficient ternary OSCs. The optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% MF1 in the acceptors exhibit a PCE of 15.31%, resulting from the synchronously enhanced JSC of 22.02 mA cm−2, FF of 78.05% and VOC of 0.891 V in comparison with those of BP-4F-based binary OSCs. It is worthwhile to highlight that the optimized binary OSCs also exhibit rather high FFs of 76.46% and 78.61% for BP-4F and MF1 as acceptors, respectively. The relatively high FFs indicate the efficient charge transport in the active layers, which may provide great potential to prepare thick-film OSCs with more sufficient photon harvesting. The optimized ternary OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers exhibit a PCE of 14.57% along with a JSC of 23.06 mA cm−2, a FF of 71.62% and a VOC of 0.882 V, which should be among the highest PCEs of thick-film OSCs with an active layer thickness of about 300 nm.

Results and discussion
A series of binary and ternary OSCs were fabricated with active layer thickness of about 100 nm, MF1 was selected as the third component to improve the performance of OSCs with the constant weight ratio of 1:1.2 (D:A). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of binary and ternary OSCs were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light with intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 2a. According to the J–V curves, the key parameters of all OSCs are summarized in Table 2. The BP-4F-based binary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 14.62%, resulting from a JSC of 21.73 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.880 V and a FF of 76.46%. The MF1-based binary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 12.47%, with a JSC of 17.18 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.923 V and a FF of 78.61%. The photovoltaic parameters of two binary OSCs exhibit apparent complementary characteristics. The JSC of BP-4F-based binary OSCs is much larger than those of MF1-based binary OSCs; the FF and VOC of MF1-based binary OSCs are much larger than those of BP-4F-based binary OSCs. A PCE of 15.31% is obtained in the optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% MF1 in the acceptors, resulting from the synchronously enhanced JSC of 22.02 mA cm−2, FF of 78.05% and VOC of 0.891 V in comparison with those of the BP-4F-based binary OSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all the OSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. The calculated JSCs of the OSCs can be achieved by integrating the corresponding EQE spectra, and are slightly less than the measured values due to the decay of the cell without any encapsulation during EQE measurement in air conditions. The EQE values in the spectral range from 500 nm to 750 nm are gradually increased along with MF1 content up to 20 wt% and then almost kept constant by incorporating more MF1. In contrast, the EQE values in the spectral range from 300 nm to 500 nm and 750 nm to 900 nm are almost kept constant when the MF1 content is less than 20 wt% in the acceptors, and then decreased along with the increase of MF1 content. The well-balanced photon harvesting of ternary OSCs can be achieved in the ternary active layers with 20 wt% MF1 content in the acceptors. The JSCs of ternary OSCs are slightly increased with 20 wt% MF1 in the acceptors and then decreased along with more MF1 content in the acceptors. The enhanced JSC of ternary OSCs may be mainly attributed to the optimized photon harvesting and phase separation degree by incorporating appropriate MF1. The well-optimized phase separation of ternary active layers can be confirmed from the gradually increased FFs of ternary OSCs along with the increased MF1 content in the acceptors. The JSCs of ternary OSCs are markedly decreased for more MF1 incorporation, largely resulting from the weakened photon harvesting in the spectral range from 750 nm to 900 nm, which can be well explained from the EQE spectrum of PBDB-T-2Cl:MF1-based binary OSCs. The VOCs of ternary OSCs are monotonously increased along with an MF1 content increase, which is a common characteristic of ternary OSCs with an alloy-like model.30–32 For OSCs with the same device structure, the VOCs of the OSCs should be mainly determined by the energy offsets between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor.33,34 The HOMO level for hole transport should be kept constant in all OSCs with PBDB-T-2Cl as the donor. The LUMO levels of the mixed acceptors should be varied depending on the MF1 content. The varied VOCs of ternary OSCs should be attributed to the varied LUMO levels of the mixed acceptor-dependence on MF1 content. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of neat and BP-4F:MF1 blend films with different MF1 content were measured to investigate the LUMO levels of the mixed acceptors, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The energy levels of BP-4F:MF1 blend films can be obtained according to the CV curves, as shown in Fig. 2c. The LUMO levels of BP-4F:MF1 blend films are monotonously upward-shifted along with the increase of MF1 content, which can well explain the gradually increased VOC of ternary OSCs. Meanwhile, the HOMO levels of the blend films show a downward-shifted trend, also indicating the formation of BP-4F:MF1 alloyed state. It is reported that good compatibility should be a prerequisite to form the alloyed state with well-mixed electronic states of two materials. To evaluate the compatibility of the used materials, the contact angles of neat PBDB-T-2Cl, BP-4F, and MF1 films were measured based on water and ethylene glycol (EG), as shown in Fig. 2d. According to the contact angles of neat films, the surface energy (γ) of PBDB-T-2Cl, BP-4F, and MF1 films can be estimated to be 27.8, 30.2, and 30.3 mN m−1, respectively. The similar surface energy of BP-4F and MF1 suggests their good compatibility. According to the surface energy of neat films, the interfacial energy between two different materials in the blend films can be evaluated using the following equation:35,36  Here, γAB is the interfacial energy between material A and B; γA and γB are the surface energy of the pure materials; superscript d and p represent the dispersion and polar components calculated by using the contact angles, respectively. The calculated interfacial energy between BP-4F and MF1 is 0.02 mN m−1, while the interfacial energy values between PBDB-T-2Cl and BP-4F, and between PBDB-T-2Cl and MF1 are 0.29 mN m−1, 0.42 mN m−1, respectively. The good compatibility of BP-4F and MF1 can be solidly confirmed from the rather small interfacial energy, which well supports the formation of an alloyed state between BP-4F and MF1.

To further investigate the intermolecular dynamic process between BP-4F and MF1, the absorption spectrum of BP-4F and photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of MF1 are exhibited in Fig. 3a. The apparent spectral overlap can be obviously observed, indicating the potential energy transfer from MF1 to BP-4F according to the Förster theory.37,38 The PL spectra of neat MF1 and BP-4F, as well as BP-4F:MF1 blend films were measured under 650 nm light excitation, as exhibited in Fig. 3b. It is apparent that PL emission at 765 nm of MF1 is completely quenched in blend films. Meanwhile, PL emission at 835 nm originating from BP-4F is markedly increased in blend films with the increase of MF1 content, further indicating the more efficient energy transfer from MF1 to BP-4F. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the neat and blend films were studied to further confirm the energy transfer from MF1 to BP-4F, as exhibited in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The lifetime of 835 nm emission is about 657 ps and 293 ps for neat BP-4F and MF1 films, respectively. The 835 nm emission lifetimes in blend films exhibit a monotonously and slightly increased trend along with the increase of MF1 content, even up to 957 ps in the blend film with 50 wt% MF1 content in the acceptors. The prolonged lifetime of 835 nm emission further indicates the existence of energy transfer from MF1 to BP-4F.39 The energy transfer from MF1 to BP-4F may provide an additional channel for improving the exciton utilization efficiency to achieve the performance improvement of ternary OSCs. A series of specific devices were prepared with BP-4F:MF1 as the active layers to investigate the exciton dynamic process between BP-4F and MF1. The J–V values of specific devices were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as displayed in Fig. 3c. The rather low JSCs of specific devices should be mainly attributed to the limited exciton dissociation efficiency and absent hole transport channels in the active layers without donor. The JSCs of specific devices with BP-4F:MF1 as active layers are larger than that of specific devices with BP-4F as the active layers, and lower than that of specific devices with MF1 as the active layers, suggesting the negligible exciton dissociation at BP-4F/MF1 interfaces.40,41 The schematic diagram of the exciton and charge dynamic process in ternary OSCs is exhibited in Fig. 3d. The light indicates the energy transfer from MF1 to BP-4F and the alloy-like state between BP-4F and MF1 will be formed for efficient electron transport in ternary active layers, which can well support the slightly increased FFs of ternary OSCs along with MF1 content in the acceptors.

The optimized ternary OSCs with 100 nm active layer thickness exhibit a rather high FF of 78.05%, resulting from the efficient charge transport in the ternary active layers. The efficient charge transport provides great potential in achieving efficient OSCs with thick active layers.42,43 A series of OSCs were prepared with the active layer thickness varying from 100 nm to 380 nm, and the detailed J–V curves of the OSCs with different active layer thicknesses were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The J–V curves of the optimized binary and ternary OSCs with 300 nm active layers are presented in Fig. 4a. The JSCs of the OSCs are gradually increased along with active layer thickness up to 300 nm, resulting from the sufficient photon harvesting and efficient charge collection.44,45 The JSCs of the OSCs will drop off when the active layer thickness is larger than 300 nm, which is mainly attributed to the increased photogenerated charge loss in thick active layers. The FFs of all OSCs are monotonously decreased along with the increase of active layer thickness due to the increase of recombination probability of charge carriers during charge transport in thick active layers.46 The VOCs of all OSCs are slightly decreased along with active layer thickness increase, which is due to the increased series resistance (RS) and severe nongeminate recombination.23 The key parameters of binary and ternary OSCs with different active layer thicknesses are summarized in Table 3. The BP-4F and MF1-based binary OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers exhibit a PCE of 13.29% and 12.14%, respectively. A 14.57% PCE is achieved in the optimized ternary OSCs with 300 nm active layers, originating from a JSC of 23.06 mA cm−2, a FF of 71.62% and a VOC of 0.882 V, which should be among the highest values for OSCs with active layers over 300 nm. The ternary strategy should be an efficient method to improve the performance of OSCs with thick active layers. The EQE spectra of OSCs with different active layer thicknesses were measured and are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The EQE spectra of the typical OSCs with 300 nm active layers are presented in Fig. 4b. The EQE values of ternary OSCs with 300 nm active layers are slightly increased in the spectral range from 350 nm to 810 nm in comparison to those of binary OSCs, suggesting that the charge transport and collection in the thick-film ternary OSCs can be optimized by incorporating 20 wt% MF1 in the acceptors.

To investigate the charge recombination behavior in the thick-film OSCs, J–V curves of typical OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers were measured under different light intensity (Plight) and are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The JSC dependence on Plight is described in Fig. 4c, which can be expressed as JSC ∝ Pαlight. The bimolecular recombination should be negligible when the α value is close to 1.47,48 The α values are 0.953, 0.961, and 0.972 for the BP-4F-based binary OSCs, the optimized ternary OSCs, and the MF1-based binary OSCs, respectively. The incorporation of MF1 can slightly suppress bimolecular recombination in the thick-film ternary OSCs. The relationship between VOC and Plight is shown in Fig. 4d, which can be expressed as VOC ∝ n(κT/q)lnPlight, where K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The trap-assisted recombination becomes dominant when n is closer to 2.49,50 The n value is 1.154 for the optimized ternary OSCs and is slightly smaller than that of 1.216 for the BP-4F-based binary OSCs, indicating that trap-assisted recombination can be slightly restrained in the thick-film ternary OSCs. The simultaneously weakened bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in the thick-film ternary OSCs indicates that the charge transport and collection can be improved by incorporating 20 wt% of MF1 in the acceptors.
To gain more insight into the effect of MF1 content on performance improvement of thick-film OSCs, photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of typical OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light with intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5a. The Jph is defined as the difference between light current density (JL) and dark current density (JD). The Veff is defined as V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage corresponding to Jph = 0, and V is the applied voltage. Assuming that all excitons are dissociated into free charges and then swept out at large Veff conditions, the Jph is defined as the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat).51,52 The Jsat of the ternary OSCs is 24.04 mA cm−2, which is slightly higher than 23.75 mA cm−2 of BP-4F-based binary OSCs and 18.71 mA cm−2 of MF1-based binary OSCs, indicating that the photogenerated exciton density should be increased in the optimized ternary active layers. The exciton dissociation or charge collection efficiency (ηdiss or ηcoll) can be evaluated by using  or , where  and  represent the Jph under the short circuit condition and maximum power output condition, respectively.53,54 The Jphs and the ratios of the typical OSCs under different conditions are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The ηdiss for the typical thick-film OSCs are 94.40%, 95.93%, and 96.68%, respectively. The ηdiss of the optimized ternary OSCs is slightly larger than that of the BP-4F-based binary OSCs, which should be due to the optimized phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation. The ηcoll is 85.15% for the optimized ternary OSCs and is larger than that of 82.48% for the BP-4F-based binary OSCs, which can account for the higher FF and PCE. The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to investigate the effect of MF1 content on charge mobility in thick-film OSCs.55,56 The ln(Jd3/V2) − (V/d)0.5 curves of hole-only and electron-only devices are depicted in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the calculated hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Both the μh and μe in the blend films show an increased trend along with MF1 content increase, as shown in Fig. 5b. The slightly enhanced μh in ternary blend films should be mainly due to the optimized molecular arrangement of PBDB-T-2Cl by incorporating MF1 in the acceptors. The μes in ternary blend films can be markedly enhanced along with the increase of MF1 content, which should be mainly attributed to the relatively high μe in PBDB-T-2Cl:MF1 blend films. The μh and μe of the optimized ternary OSCs were improved to 1.03 × 10-4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.17 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Meanwhile, electron and hole charge transport become more balanced (μh/μe = 1.98) in the optimized ternary OSCs compared with that (μh/μe = 2.91) of BP-4F-based binary OSCs, which can well explain the enhanced FF of 71.62% for the optimized ternary OSCs.

Two dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was carried out to investigate the effect of MF1 incorporation on molecular packing in the 300 nm thick blend films. The in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) profiles extracted from the 2D GIWAXS patterns are shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6a, the neat PBDB-T-2Cl films exhibit a strong (100) diffraction peak at 0.35 Å−1 and (010) diffraction peak at 1.79 Å−1 in the OOP direction. Meanwhile, the relatively weak (100) diffraction peak at 0.31 Å−1 and (010) diffraction peak at 1.78 Å−1 in the IP direction can also be observed in neat PBDB-T-2Cl films, indicating the co-existence of face-on and edge-on molecular orientation (called 3D texture structure) of PBDB-T-2Cl in neat films.57,58 The neat BP-4F films exhibit an almost indiscernible (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction, indicating the relatively random molecular arrangement of BP-4F in neat films. A strong (100) diffraction peak at 0.40 Å−1 in the IP direction and an obvious (010) diffraction peak at 1.81 Å−1 in the OOP direction can be observed from the neat MF1 films, suggesting the preferred face-on orientation of MF1. Fig. 6b shows that all blend films exhibit obvious (100) diffraction peaks at 0.32 Å−1 and 0.37 Å−1 in the IP and OOP directions, respectively. Meanwhile, a strong (010) diffraction peak at 1.81 Å−1 in the OOP direction can also be observed in all the blend films, indicating that 3D textured structures should be formed in all the blend films. It should be highlighted that another (100) diffraction peak at 0.42 Å−1 in the IP direction originating from MF1 can be clearly discernible in the PBDB-T-2Cl:MF1 blend films, as confirmed from the profiles of neat MF1 films, indicating that the face-on orientation of MF1 molecules in PBDB-T-2Cl:MF1 blend films can be well kept. In addition, the apparent (200) diffraction peaks at 0.63 and 0.69 Å−1 can be observed in both the IP and OOP directions, respectively, suggesting that a highly ordered molecular arrangement should be formed in PBDB-T-2Cl:MF1 blend films. Compared with PBDB-T-2Cl:BP-4F binary blend films, the (100) diffraction peaks in the IP and OOP directions and the (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction of the ternary blend films are slightly increased along with the increased MF1 content. Meanwhile, the appearance of new (100) diffraction peaks in the IP direction and (200) diffraction peaks in the IP and OOP directions also exhibits a slightly increased trend along with the increased MF1 content, indicating more ordered molecular packing in the ternary blend films by incorporating MF1 in the acceptors. The more ordered molecular arrangement should be beneficial to charge transport in the ternary active layers, which can well explain the enhanced FF and charge mobility in the optimized ternary OSCs.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further investigate the effect of MF1 content on the morphology of blend films with 300 nm thickness, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The bright and dark regions in the TEM images represent donor-rich and acceptor-rich domains with different electron densities, respectively.59,60 A featureless morphology with weak phase separation was observed in PBDB-T-2Cl:BP-4F blend films, resulting in the increased charge carrier recombination and relatively low FF. Obvious phase separation should be formed in the PBDB-T-2Cl:MF1 blend films due to the well-differentiated dark and light regions in the corresponding TEM images, which can be explained as due to the relatively large interfacial energy between PBDB-T-2Cl and MF1 mentioned above. According to the TEM image of ternary blend films, clearer phase separation features in the optimized ternary blend films were observed relative to the BP-4F-based binary blend films. In the previous works, elemental mapping through energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM)61 and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)62 were employed to investigate the morphological characteristics of the blend films. To further investigate the phase separation degree of binary and ternary blend layers, EDS was carried out with a scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray detector (OXFord). EDS elemental mapping was applied onto the binary and ternary blend films by monitoring the featured elements of the donor and acceptors, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). In the EDS elemental mapping images, red dots correspond to the distribution of PBDB-T-2Cl by monitoring chlorine (Cl) element, and green dots correspond to the distribution of BP-4F and MF1 by monitoring nitrogen (N) element. The donor/acceptor phase separation degree of ternary blend films becomes more apparent along with the increase of MF1 content in the acceptors, which is very similar to those observed from TEM images of binary and ternary blend films. The slightly evolving phase separation degree in ternary blend films should be beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport in the optimized ternary OSCs, resulting in the relatively high FF in comparison with that of the BP-4F-based binary OSCs. The third component MF1 can be considered as a morphology regulator to optimize the phase separation of the ternary active layer for achieving efficient ternary OSCs.
Conclusions
A series of ternary OSCs were prepared using PBDB-T-2Cl as a donor and two non-fullerene materials, BP-4F and MF1, as acceptors. The BP-4F and MF1 tend to form an alloyed acceptor for efficient electron transport in the ternary active layers. The alloyed state of the two acceptors should be conducive to Förster energy transfer from MF1 to BP-4F, providing an additional channel for improving the exciton utilization efficiency. A PCE of 15.31% is obtained in the optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% MF1 in the acceptors and the active layer thickness of 100 nm, also exhibiting a relatively high FF of 78.05%. Based on the well-optimized binary and ternary OSCs, the active layer thickness was gradually increased to 380 nm to enhance photon harvesting and meet the demand of large-scale production. The BP-4F-and MF1-based binary OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers exhibit PCEs of 13.29% and 12.14%, respectively. The ternary OSCs with 300 nm active layers exhibit a PCE of 14.57% and a FF of 71.62%, which should be among the highest values of OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers. The performance enhancement of the thick-film ternary OSCs should be mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting, optimized morphology for exciton dissociation and charge transport in ternary active layers. This work indicates that a ternary strategy should be a promising way to achieve efficient thick-film OSCs.

Broader context
Developing efficient OSCs with relatively thick active layers compatible with the roll-to-roll large area printing process is an inevitable requirement for the commercialization of this field. At present, the performance of thick-film OSCs is far behind that of thin-film OSCs due to the increased charge recombination probability in thick films. There remains a significant need to further improve the performance of thick-film OSCs to meet the requirements of practical applications. In this work, a ternary strategy was employed to fabricate efficient thick-film OSCs by using one polymer donor and two well-compatible non-fullerene acceptors. The optimized ternary OSCs with 300 nm active layers exhibit a PCE of 14.57% and a FF of 71.62%, which are among the highest values of OSCs with 300 nm thick active layers. To date, high performance thick-film ternary non-fullerene OSCs have seldom been reported. This work indicates that the thick-film ternary strategy has great potential in achieving efficient large-scale OSCs.
