    , Accepted 19th December 2012First published on 21st January 2013AbstractBroadband transparent electrodes, Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x, are successfully designed to enhance light absorption and carrier transport properties in organic solar cells (OSCs) as an alternative to ITO/PEDOT:PSS. Employing the optical constant matching layer, zero reflection conditions could be achieved over a broad range of wavelengths. Moreover, the non-stoichiometric WO3−x could induce a large density of gap states near the Fermi level via quick thermal deposition, acting as the transport path of carriers. Significantly improved current densities were achieved, increasing the power conversion efficiency from 2.1% to 2.9%, values which are comparable to conventionally fabricated devices on ITO/PEDOT:PSS.
Introduction
For several decades, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been the most widely used transparent electrode in organic electronics. Its sheet resistance is below 10 ohm sq−1 with the transmission of 90% when it was deposited at a high temperature (∼300 °C) onto glass. However, ITO is incompatible with processing on flexible plastic substrates because the resistance increases up to 40–200 ohm sq−1 with the same transmission as the deposition temperature decreases below 300 °C.1 Such a problem could not be simply solved by increasing the ITO thickness since the thicker film yields lower transmission characteristics. The low transparency (<85%) in the blue region (<500 nm)2 in commercial ITO on glass, whose thickness is 170 nm, represents another drawback for application in electronic devices because most of the photon harvesting to get a high power conversion efficiency of solar cells based on tandem3 or visibly transparent structures4 occurs in the range of wavelengths from UV to NIR in the solar spectrum. In terms of brittleness under repeated bending5,6 and market price, ITO must not be a candidate for the optimum electrode for flexible organic electronics. Therefore, alternative materials to ITO showing broadband transparency and flexibility are required for application in organic electronics.
Several kinds of flexible electrodes such as carbon-based materials (carbon nanotubes and graphene), metallic nano-structures (nanowires, grids and meshes) and conducting polymers have been reported, although they suffer from low optical transmittance over all wavelengths and/or poor conductivity. Carbon based nano-structures have low conductivity (carbon nanotubes: 100–1000 ohm sq−1, graphene: 100–10000 ohm sq−1) and lack uniformity in large areas.7–10 In the case of metallic nanowires, they show high transmittance (>80%) and relatively low sheet resistance (10–100 ohm sq−1), but poor thermal stability due to severe disconnection and rough surface morphology causing poor efficiency.11–14 Thin films of thermally evaporable metals such as Al, Ag and Au have been also used as semitransparent electrodes with excellent electrical conductivity and flexibility.15 However, such single metal films show low transmittance (<50%) due to high reflectivity at the interface of metal with conducting polymer. Dielectric/metal multilayers have been sought for enhancing the transmittance of these metal films. Dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD), WO3/Ag/WO3 and BCP/Ag/MoO3, were successfully employed as transparent electrodes in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)16 and organic solar cells (OSCs),17 respectively. Replacing the top metal cathode with a DMD structure can improve PCE to over 26%. MoO3/Ag/MoO3 (ref. 18) has also been reported for large-area applications and ZnS/Cu/WO3 (ref. 19) can achieve a low cost, about 1/100 that of indium. However, in spite of their competitive price and suitability for large-scale applications, DMD structures have shown high peak transmission at a specific wavelength (T = 93.5% at λ = 510 nm), but still suffer from reduced transmission (T < 80%) on average over the visible band (λ = 400–700 nm).
Here, we suggest the design rules for a broadband transparent DMD electrode with both excellent flexibility and electrical conductivity. A thin film of WO3−x with a high refractive index (n = 1.99) and a high work function (6.3 eV) was employed as an inner dielectric (Di) layer. It could enhance the Ag's transmittance and fulfill the carrier transportation through the gap states in the vicinity of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (>5.1 eV) of P3HT. Using the Ta2O5 of n = 2.19 as an outer dielectric (Do) layer, zero reflectance was achieved at the broad band (400–700 nm). As a result, an optimized structure of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x shows an optical transmission of ∼90%, a sheet resistance of ∼11.1 ohm sq−1 and a conversion efficiency of 2.9%, values which are equivalent to conventional ITO/PEDOT:PSS devices. In addition, Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x showed better performance in terms of flexibility and stability than ITO/PEDOT:PSS.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic diagram of the cross-sectional view of the DoMDi electrode which we designed. The design goal was to find both matching layers of dielectric films on the substrate side (Do) and the photoactive layer one (Di) to achieve the highest transparency over the entire solar spectrum. In the simulation, the average transparency in the visible range (400–700 nm) was defined as “apparent transparency” because it is as much as 42.9% of the entire solar spectrum (280–4000 nm). The admittance graphical technique20,21 based on the change of admittance on the complex plane with increasing optical thickness was employed to maximize the apparent transparency. In a substrate/DoMDi/air system, each locus is connected at interfaces between the different layers as traced out clockwise. Therefore, the admittance of the last layer (Di) should end at the air (1,0) to satisfy zero reflectance for high transmittance. Fig. 1(b) shows the admittance diagram of dielectric and metal films. In classical optics, the admittance for a dielectric layer, Ta2O5 or WO3−x, is a circular locus centered on (nd2 + nsub2/2nsub, 0) with a radius of |nd2 − nsub2/2nsub|. Starting from (nsub, 0) with a clockwise spiral with increasing film thickness, the plot crosses the real axis at (nd2/nsub) for every quarter-wavelength.22 Therefore, zero reflection in dielectric layers could be obtained when the locus of admittance forms a series of circular arcs or circles. However, for metals such as Ag or other absorbing layers, the end point of admittance becomes far from the air (1,0) with increasing thickness, reducing transmittance, due to the imaginary part of the refractive index (n = nreal + inimaginary). Embedding a Ag layer between the Ta2O5 and WO3−x could reduce the disparity with the admittance of air (1,0) and zero reflection could be obtained as shown in Fig. 1(c). As a result, an optimized structure of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x could provide advantages of high transparency and low sheet resistance. In addition, a number of gap-states of WO3−x, marked with dashed lines, could be controlled via the thermal deposition rate within the WO3−x layer (Fig. 1(d)). The gap states act as the media of carrier transport, leading to the increase of photo-induced current of the solar cell.

In the DoMDi structure, the metal layer plays a vital role in increasing conductance. Thick metal layers can improve conductivity, but absorb visible light and decrease transmittance. Therefore metal thickness must be optimized to find a balance between these two effects. Thin films of metals such as Al, Cu, Ag and Au are semitransparent in the visible region. Ag was chosen here due to it having the lowest refractive index (nAg = 0.05 − i2.09) and absorption. Its thickness was optimized by the measured sheet resistance (RS) with respect to thickness on the dielectrics (Fig. S1†). At 5 nm of Ag, RS was relatively high (5100 ohm sq−1) due to its island growth. However, RS sharply decreased with increasing thickness, 11.08 ohm sq−1 at TAg = 10 nm, comparable with 170 nm thick ITO (∼10 ohm sq−1). Based on these experimental results, the 10 nm thick Ag film was considered to be optimal. Although the Ag thin film is able to act as an alternative transparent anode to ITO, it suffers from low charge extraction efficiency from organic materials due to its small work function. In this regard, proposing transition metal oxides such as WO3, V2O5 and NiO for the inner dielectric layer is attractive due to their good charge transport properties, environmental stability and visible light transparency.25,26 To investigate the optical effects of the inner dielectric layer, apparent transmittance of the Ag/Di structure was simulated under the condition of extinction coefficient of the inner dielectric (Di) being equal to zero (k = 0) in Fig. 2(a). The apparent transmittance determined by the product of transmittance and the solar spectrum ratio in the 400–700 nm range was plotted as a function of the refractive index (n = 1.5 to 3.0) of Di. As the refractive index increased, the apparent transmittance gradually increased and leveled off at 2.0. These results indicate that a transmittance of 80% could be obtained in a Ag/Di structure when the refractive index is higher than 2.0 (n > 2.0) and the extinction coefficient becomes zero (k ∼ 0). Fig. 2(b) compares the simulated (lines) and measured transmittances (symbols) of inner dielectric materials (WO3, V2O5 and NiO) on Ag to verify the simulation results. Each dielectric's optimal thickness for high transmittance in the visible range was calculated by the characteristic matrix theory. The 10 nm thick Ag film showed low transmittance (<50%) due to its reflective property. Bi-layered Ag/WO3 showed increased transmittance (77.8%) due to the WO3 having a higher refractive index (n = 1.99) or a lower extinction coefficient (k = 0.024) than V2O5 (n = 2.24, k = 0.047) or NiO (n = 1.8, k = 0.01), where the refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) are measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (not shown here). WO3 was selected as the inner dielectric material because of its high transparency. The simulated 2-dimensional (2-D) contour plot of Ag/WO3's apparent transmittance (λ = 400–700 nm) with respect to each layer's thickness shows that for the 10 nm thick Ag, the maximum apparent transmittance (∼76.8%) was obtained at a WO3 thickness of 40 nm (Fig. 2(c)). Thus, the optimal thickness of WO3 was found to be 40 nm. Its maximum transparency ∼80% is still too low to be useful as an alternative to ITO. Further increases in transparency are expected to be achieved by employing an outer dielectric, matching with the zero reflection condition of admittance.

(b) Simulated (lines) and measured (symbols) transmittances of Ag/Di (WO3, V2O5 and NiO). (c) Simulated contour plots of Ag/WO3's average transmittance (400–700 nm) as a function of thickness. 
Regarding the optical design of the outer dielectric layer, the Do/Ag/WO3 structure's transmittance reflected in the solar spectrum ratio was calculated by changing the refractive index (n = 1.5 to 3.0) of the outer dielectric (Do) under a fixed extinction coefficient (k = 0) (Fig. 3(a)). Each optimal thickness of the outer dielectric (Do (n = x)) for the highest transmittance in the visible range (400–700 nm) was determined from the 2-D plots shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 3(a) clearly shows the transmittance spectra significantly broadened as the refractive index (n) increased up to 2.1 over the entire wavelength range. A further increase in the outer dielectric's refractive index resulted in the decrease of the transmittance. Change of the apparent transmittance with n is plotted in Fig. S3.† The simulated admittance averaged over the visible range is closest to the air (1,0) at n = 2.1 and k = 0, leading to enhanced transmittance (>90%) over a broad range of wavelengths. Consequently, the best properties could be obtained from outer dielectrics with a refractive index of n = 2.1 and a low extinction coefficient (k ∼ 0). Among the possible dielectric materials, Ta2O5 (n = 2.19, k = 0.0001) is considered to be the best for the outer dielectric layer, where both the refractive index (n) and the extinction coefficient (k) are measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (not shown here). The use of a 35 nm thick Ta2O5 layer enhanced the transmittance of Ag/WO3 by up to 90% (Fig. 3(b)). Fig. 3(c) shows the simulated transmittance spectrum of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3 as a function of wavelength, which is in good agreement with the experimentally measured one. For reference, experimental data of ITO were also plotted. At wavelengths below 500 nm, the Ta2O5/Ag/WO3 film showed better transmittance than the ITO structure. Its average transmittance over the wavelength range of 400–700 nm was 89.7%, close to 91.9% in the ITO film. Fig. 3(d) indicates the solar spectrum of AM 1.5G and the calculated absorption spectrum obtained by multiplying the solar spectrum by the transmittance of the anode corresponding to ITO, Ta2O5/Ag/WO3 and Ag. Note that the absorption of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3 was greater than that of ITO in the 380–500 nm range.

The extraction of holes from the active layer to the electrode could be enhanced by the production of gap states near the surface of WO3. A high density of oxygen vacancies in the non-stoichiometric film could induce gap-states, acting as paths for the transport of carriers through the dielectric layer. Since the melting point of WO3 is as high as 1474 °C, non-stoichiometric decomposition of WO3 occurs at least higher than 1474 °C, leading to the deposition of WO3−x to form oxygen vacancies during the evaporation. Therefore, the stoichiometry of WO3 can be controlled via the thermal evaporation rate by adjusting the temperature of the WO3 source. Fig. 4(a) shows the UPS valence-band spectra of WO3 deposited with respect to the deposition rate. At a slow rate of 0.5 Å s−1, the valence band edge is at 3.0 ± 0.1 eV, indicating oxygen 2p states in the valence band, in good agreement with the literature for WO3 films.27 As the deposition rate increased up to 3.0 Å s−1, a newly formed density of occupied gap states appeared at ∼0.8 and 2.5 eV below the Fermi level, originating from W 5d metallic states and unbounded oxygen atoms, respectively.28 This provided evidence that the non-stoichiometric WO3−x resulted in the creation of gap states near the conduction band edge, and therefore hole extraction could easily occur via electron injection from the conduction band of WO3−x to the polymer's HOMO.29 The non-stoichiometric WO3−x's chemical composition was assessed by synchrotron photoemission spectroscopy analysis, which measured W 4f and O 1s core level spectra at the surface of non-stoichiometric WO3−x deposited at 0.5 and 3.0 Å s−1 (see Fig. S4†). These results also imply that the WO3−x film deposited at 3.0 Å s−1 was non-stoichiometric with a greater presence of reduced W5+ phase and a higher density of oxygen vacancies.28 Similar trends were observed in the quantitative analysis of the normalized atomic ratio of oxygen to tungsten. The relative O/W ratio of the 3.0 Å s−1 sample was 91.6% that of the 0.5 Å s−1 sample, indicating the formation of an O-deficient layer near the surface via the generation of O vacancies in the more quickly deposited WO3−x. Meanwhile, the WO3−x work function decreases as oxygen vacancy concentration increases due to density of occupied states being close to the Fermi level (Fig. 4(b)).30 The oxygen vacancies could enhance the electrical conductivity of WO3−x from 2.7 × 10−7 to 4.2 × 10−7 S cm−1 as the film deposition rate increased from 0.5 to 3.0 Å s−1 (Fig. 4(c)). Gap states positioning at the energy levels between the Fermi level (EF) of the anode and the HOMO level of organics could play a role in transporting electrons from the anode to the organic layer, leading to the ohmic behavior.

Fig. 5(a) shows the typical J–V characteristics of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x solar cells with WO3−x deposited at different deposition rates. As shown from these results, when the deposition rate was increased from 0.5 to 3.0, the FF slightly increased from 58.5 to 61, and the Jsc increased significantly from 5.8 to 7.4 mA cm−2. Each device's performance is summarized in Table 1. As a result, PCE remarkably improved from 2.1 to 2.9%, originating from the increase of Jsc. Such an increase in Jsc originated from the gap states, which play a role in increasing conductance. To understand the reproducibility of the results obtained, a number of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x (3.0 Å s−1) electrodes (>20) were prepared and consistent results of transmittance (∼90%) and PCE between 2.8% and 3.0% were obtained.

Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x electrodes are highly mechanically flexible and hence suitable for roll-to-roll processing. The effects of repeated bending and flexing to 1 cm radius on the sheet resistances of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x and ITO on the PET film were measured (Fig. 5(c)). The sheet resistance of the ITO film increased greatly to about 270 ohms sq−1 after 1000 cycles of bending and flexing due to significant crack propagation (inset figure). The Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x electrode maintained its initial sheet resistance after repeated bending and showed no crack lines, demonstrating its compatibility with flexible substrates for organic solar cells. Consequently, Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x electrodes are potential suitable substitutes for ITO as flexible and broadband transparent bottom electrodes for organic solar cells. Regarding the devices' stability in air, PCE in ITO/PEDOT:PSS rapidly degraded, by 80% within 9 days. However, a little degradation in Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x was found, as shown in Fig. 5(d). Similar results were found in the solar cell with ITO/WO3−x (see Fig. S5†). The rapid degradation in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS was due to the highly acidic (pH ∼ 1) properties of PEDOT:PSS, causing diffusion of In and Sn atoms into the active layer during the thermal annealing.31–33 The PEDOT:PSS is hygroscopic, which captures water vapor and allows it to penetrate into the active layer.31 On the other hand, WO3−x plays an important role in preventing a chemical reaction between the ITO and the active layer because of blocking charge transport. As a result, WO3−x plays a beneficial role in increasing the device stability.
From the design optimization, Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x based solar cells with comparable performance to that of ITO/PEDOT:PSS were achieved. Although the work shown here looks somewhat different in the typical records of P3HT:PCBM with ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrodes, efficiencies are still in the 3–4% range during the last two years.18,34–36 Moreover, the efficiency of the solar cell with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode in this manuscript was in good agreement with the previous publication.37
Conclusion
In summary, a broadband transparent electrode with flexibility was systematically designed as an alternative to ITO based on Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x multilayers. The inner dielectric, WO3−x with a high work function (6.3 eV), could enhance hole extraction by the formation of gap states via quick thermal deposition. Employing Ta2O5 (n = 2.19, k = 0.0001) as an outer dielectric, zero reflection conditions could be achieved over a broad range of wavelengths. The optimized Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x multilayer showed comparable sheet resistance (∼11.08 ohm sq−1) to that of ITO (∼10 ohm sq−1) and good broadband transparency (Tavg ∼ 90%) in the visible range. Organic solar cells employing the broadband Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x electrode showed a comparable power conversion efficiency of 2.9% and enhanced stability and flexibility, thus demonstrating great potential for the substitution of ITO electrodes.
Experimental
Device fabrication
A glass substrate was cleaned with acetone, iso-propyl alcohol and deionized water. It was then loaded into a radio frequency sputtering chamber. The Ta2O5 (35 nm) as an outer dielectric layer was deposited from a Ta2O5 target (99.99%, 2 inch diameter) with an r.f. power of 150 W in an argon atmosphere. The chamber pressure was maintained at 4 × 10−3 torr during deposition and the substrate temperature was held at room temperature. After deposition, the substrate was transferred into the thermal evaporation chamber. The Ag (10 nm)/WO3 anode was deposited with various deposition rates (0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 Å s−1) to optimize the optical transmittance and electrical properties from the WO3 and Ag pellets (99.99%, 10 mm and 3 mm diameters) at a base pressure in the order of 10−7 torr. The reference ITO film (170 nm thick, ∼10 ohm sq−1) on glass was used as the substrate. After UV-O treatment for 15 min with a power of 30 mW cm−2, PEDOT:PSS (Bayton P, H. C. Stark GmbH) was spin-coated and dried at 200 °C for 10 min. Regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, purchased from Rieke Metals and used as received) was first dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) to make a 20 mg ml−1 solution, followed by blending with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Nano-C, used as received) in a 1:1 weight ratio. The blend was stirred for ∼14 h in a glove box before being spin-coated (700 rpm, 30 s) on top of the Ta2O5/Ag/WO3 and ITO/PEDOT:PSS layers. The active layer thickness was measured as ∼200 nm by a surface profiler. The devices were annealed on a hot plate in a glove box at 130 °C for 10 min. LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) bilayer cathodes were deposited via thermal evaporation under a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 torr.
Measurement
The optical constants of Ta2O5, Ag and WO3 were measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry (J. A. Woollam Co., Inc M-44). Commercial software (The Essential Macleod, Thin Film Center, Inc.) based on what is known as the characteristic matrix method was employed for optical analysis involving Ag-based films. The transmittance of dielectric/metal/dielectric samples was measured using a UV-visible spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750S). The J–V curves were measured under ambient air conditions with glass encapsulation using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination from an Oriel 150 W solar simulator. The light intensity was determined using a mono-silicon detector calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Structure of an OSC using a DoMDi electrode and photograph of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x on a PET substrate. (b) Admittance diagrams of the dielectric and metal. Y indicates the material's admittance. (c) Admittance diagram of the Ta2O5(Do)/Ag/WO3−x(Di) multilayer. If the admittance of DoMDi ends at Yair, zero reflection is satisfied. (d) Schematic energy level diagram of P3HT:PCBM blend films on Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x. The band positions of P3HT:PCBM are taken from ref. 23 and 24.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Apparent transmittance of Ag/Di as a function of the refractive index (from 1.5 to 3.0, k = 0) of inner dielectrics. Apparent transmittance is the average transmittance multiplied by the solar spectrum ratio from a wavelength of 400 nm to 700 nm. (b) Simulated (lines) and measured (symbols) transmittances of Ag/Di (WO3, V2O5 and NiO). (c) Simulated contour plots of Ag/WO3's average transmittance (400–700 nm) as a function of thickness.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Transmittance multiplied by the solar spectrum ratio of Do/Ag/WO3 as a function of the refractive index (from 1.5 to 3.0, k = 0) of outer dielectrics. (b) Simulated contour plots of average transmittance (400–700 nm) for Ta2O5/Ag/WO3 as a function of their thickness. (c) Simulated (dots) and measured (lines) transmittances of ITO and Ta2O5/Ag/WO3. (d) Spectrally weighted absorption of the AM 1.5G reference spectrum, corresponding to ITO, Ta2O5/Ag/WO3 and Ag electrodes.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Valence band spectra and (b) secondary cut-off spectra of WO3−x films formed at different deposition rates. (c) Electrical characteristics of the ITO/WO3−x/Al device. (d) Energy-level schematic of O-deficient WO3−x, with the Fermi level (EF), O 2p band, W 5d band, and gap states indicated.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the ITO and Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x devices with various deposition rates of WO3−x (0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 Å s−1). (b) PCE (solid black squares) and Jsc (open red circles) properties of the OSCs. PCE increased from 2.1% to 2.9% with increasing deposition rate. (c) Sheet resistances of Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x and ITO films on PET after repeated bending. SEM images (insets) of ITO and Ta2O5/Ag/WO3−x films after bending. (d) Changes in devices' PCE during exposure to air.
