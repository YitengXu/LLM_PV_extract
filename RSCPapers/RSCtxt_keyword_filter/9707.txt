    , Accepted 2nd August 2011First published on 6th September 2011AbstractThe ability to produce low-cost, hierarchically-structured and nanopatterned inorganic materials could potentially revolutionize the way we fabricate photovoltaic, energy storage, and optoelectronic devices. In nature, many organisms carry out the hierarchical assembly of metal oxide materials through cellular and biochemical processes that replicate periodic micro- and nanoscale features by a bottom-up approach at ambient conditions. For example, single-celled algae called diatoms produce a nanostructured amorphous silica skeleton called a frustule. The insertion of other metal oxide materials such as titanium or germanium dioxide into the nanostructure of the diatom frustule could potentially be utilized to fabricate new dye-sensitized solar cells, nanostructured battery electrodes, and electroluminescent display devices. The exploitation of diatom nanobiotechnology for the development of novel device concepts in these areas is overviewed.

Broader context
There is enormous interest in bio-inspired approaches for the synthesis of photonic, semiconductor and metal oxide nanomaterials for device applications, as they offer the opportunity for self assembly into hierarchical structures. Diatoms, a class of single-celled algae, have been touted as the paradigm for the bio-inspired synthesis of nanostructured materials because they produce a hierarchically structured silica skeleton, called a frustule, with periodic micro- and nanoscale features from soluble silicon by a bottom-up, self-assembly process at ambient conditions. However, even though the unique photonic properties of diatom frustules and the ease with which diatom frustule chemistry can be manipulated have already been demonstrated, there is a lack of progress in the field of diatom-based device fabrication. To stimulate advances in this forward-looking field, this paper examines the potential application of diatom nanobiotechnology in solar cells, battery anodes and display devices. Specifically, a working dye sensitized solar cell and an electroluminescent display incorporating diatom frustules will be presented. The possibility of diatom nanobiotechnology to be used in the fabrication of nanostructured battery electrodes and future prospects in the field will also be discussed.

Introduction
Diminishing energy supplies and increasing environmental concerns require that humankind develop new alternative energy technologies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and to develop new generations of electronic devices that will be produced in environmentally friendly ways.1,2 Ideally, a method to efficiently and economically harvest solar energy, a free, abundant, and carbon-neutral energy source, will be optimized for the production of electricity while circumventing the use of toxic substrates or energy intensive fabrication methods. Additionally, the development of green, bottom-up fabrication techniques for the fabrication of lightweight, high performance batteries and energy storage devices has the potential to shift the transportation paradigm away from exclusively petrol fueled vehicles. Biogenic, bio-enabled and bio-inspired hierarchical materials based on the nanoscale biomineralization capabilities of marine diatoms may hold the key to create the materials from which these devices, like dye-sensitized solar cells, secondary lithium ion batteries and electroluminescent display devices will be made.3–13
Hierarchically structured materials based on the structure or chemistry of diatom biosilica can be produced by metabolic, bioclastic or biomimetic means and possess physical, optical, or electronic properties applicable to energy and electroluminescent device development. This paper describes the potential of diatom nanobiotechnology in the development of novel dye sensitized solar cells, battery anodes and electroluminescent display devices. A new type of diatom-enhanced dye sensitized solar cell and a diatom-based electroluminescent display device are also presented.
Diatoms
Diatoms are a group of single-celled photosynthetic algae of the class Bacillariophyceae that make skeletal shells of hydrated amorphous silica,14 called frustules, that possess hierarchical micro- and nanoscale features made by a bottom-up approach at ambient temperatures and pressures (Fig. 1). Diatoms take up water soluble silicic acid from the environment which is then precipitated into amorphous silica within an intracellular “nanobioreactor” called the silicon deposition vesicle (SDV), which forms the frustule.15 There have been several reviews of silicon metabolism in diatoms,16 and diatom frustule formation.14,17–19

The SDV contains specialized proteins called silaffins as well as long chain poly-amines (LCPAs),20,21 which catalyze the hydrolysis reaction between Si(OH)4 hydroxyl groups which links the monomers to form solid amorphous silica by the creation of siloxane (Si–O–Si) bonds,22 as depicted in Fig. 2. The silicon oxide is formed into nanospheres embedded with silaffin proteins and LCPAs23 by an aqueous-organic phase separation reaction.22,24 The nano-sized amorphous silica building blocks are used to construct the patterned micro- and nano-structures that become new diatom frustules.20,25,26 The chemistry of silica precipitation by silaffin proteins and silaffin protein analogues and mimickers can be exploited to fabricate nanostructured metal oxide materials in vitro at near neutral pH and ambient temperatures and pressures. Excellent reviews on the biomimetic formation of metal oxides are available.4,27,28

(b) Silaffins and poly-amines catalyze the transformation of soluble silica into the insoluble silica pattern of the frustule. As silica is formed the silaffin droplets become confined and catalyze the intrapore nanostructures. 
The frustule morphology of each species of diatom is unique and often highly intricate. An exhaustive review of diatom frustule anatomy is authored by Round et al.14 Briefly, centric diatoms possess radial symmetry while pennate diatoms are generally elongated with bilateral symmetry. The diatom frustule is composed of two valves in the same manner as the two halves of a Petri dish. The inner and outer valves are the hypotheca and epitheca, respectively. The hypotheca and epitheca can be comprised of a single layer of silica or a double layer of silica with a void-like chamber, called the loculae, in between which forms a “double-hulled” frustule. A band of silica, called the girdle band, wraps around the equator of the diatom and holds the epivalve and hypovalve together. Pennate diatoms have a strip of thickened silica, called the principal rib or sternum, which spans the length of the frustule along the central axis. A silica slit or fold, called a raphae, often spans the length of the principal rib. Costae are smaller silica ribs which emanate perpendicularly from the principal rib toward the girdle band. The spaces between the costae are filled with silica except where there are areolae, which are the pore spaces found between the costae. The areola may be a simple void or may be occluded with silica nanostructures called cribrum. In certain species, primarily in species which have a loculae, the cribrum are covered with an even finer nano-netting of silica called the cribellum.
The diatom frustule is believed to be multifunctional. For example, the mechanical strength of the frustule resists shear stress and deters predation from zooplankton.29–32 Also, the silica barrier between the cytoplasm and the exterior environment prevents the penetration of viruses.33 The nanopores act as a particle sorter, determining which particles reach the cell membrane and its receptors.34 Chemically, controlled dissolution of the frustule biosilica can control the pH near the cell membrane, which enables the diatom to uptake CO2 from carbonic acid by the action of carbonic anhydrase.35 Also, the micro-scale periodic structure of the frustule, which is often itself imbedded with nanoscale features,36 possess interesting light-interaction properties which the diatom exploits to enhance photosynthesis. The frustule filters out harmful UV radiation37,38 and blue light which causes oxidative stress to the photosynthetic apparatus.39,40 The frustule can also act as a lens which focuses light into a focal plane within the cytoplasm,38,41,42 which could explain the migration of chloroplasts within the cytoplasm under varying light conditions.43,44 These unique optical properties of diatom frustules are exploited to enhance material-photon interactions in light harvesting devices.42,45,46
The frustule structure is passed indefinitely from parent to progeny, and barring substrate limitation diatoms grow exponentially with time. The fabrication of hierarchically structured frustules is therefore highly scalable, and amenable to production at the industrial scale.
Current device applications
There are currently no commercially available diatom nanobiotechnology based devices, but several functioning diatom-based apparatus have been reported in the literature and other devices have been envisioned in patents and patent applications. Currently, diatom-based devices have been used for the detection of antibodies,47NO,48 H2,49pyridine, xylene, acetone, ethanol, and NO2 gasses,50 as a wave guide,45 and an electroluminescent display.51 An additional application, dye-sensitized solar cells, will be introduced in this manuscript. A multitude of potential devices for power applications have been envisioned in the patent literature. It was proposed that diatom frustules could be used to cast nanoporous metal screens which would then be used as a gas selector for a fuel-cell mixing chamber.52 A patent application by Dickerson et al. (2007)53 seeks to patent fabrication methods of micro-to-nanoscale devices, including devices which are diatom-based and can be used in energy production. Two patents by Sandhange54,55 cover the reactive conversion of biologically-derived microtemplates, which have already been proven to function as gas sensors and may also have application in energy-producing devices. A final patent by Sandhage and Bao56 covers the fabrication of nanoscale to micro-scale structures; including structures which are diatom-based, which they propose can be used as diodes or P–N junctions in silicon-based solar cells or as high surface area battery electrodes in lithium batteries. The potential of diatom-based structures in lithium batteries will be discussed in greater detail in this manuscript because of the high level of interest in biomimetic battery anode fabrication. Other potential applications of diatom nanobiotechnology were proposed by Gordon3, who envisions that diatom-based devices will be used in drug delivery, microfluidics and computing. While this manuscript does not cover advances in natural light harvesting,57 the conversion of algal photosynthesis to fuels,58 the algal production of energy within biomimetic materials,50,59,60 or photolysis from bio-inspired systems,61 excellent reviews on these topics are available.
Diatom dye-sensitized solar cell applications

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) introduced by O'Regan and Grätzel62 in 1991 have significant potential as inexpensive photovoltaic devices. A traditional DSSC and an improved DSSC exploiting the light-scattering properties of a diatom frustule-TiO2 composite material are presented in Fig. 3. The most typical DSSC configuration has a ruthenium based dye bound to a photoanode comprised of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. To produce current, a dye molecule absorbs a photon and in the photoexcited state injects an electron into the conduction band of the semiconducting TiO2, creating an electron-hole pair. The electron diffuses through the anatase titania layer to a transparent conductive glass front electrode and then performs work when passed through a load. An electron from the electrolyte replenishes the hole. Excellent reviews on DSSCs,63,64 bio-based solar cells65 and TiO2 nanomaterials66 are available.
 Fig. 3  (a) Traditional DSSC, (b) DSSC with enhanced photonic capture resulting from the incorporation of a reflective diatom titanium oxide composite layer. 
Improving the performance of a DSSC has primarily been limited to optimizing three photo-related components: the structuring of the titania in the photoanode, the photosensitizing dye, and the electrolyte. However, the incorporation of diatom frustules or frustule-metal oxide composites onto the photoanode has the potential to enhance DSSC efficiency by a different mechanism, specifically, by acting as an integrated reflector or even a photonic crystal.39,45,46 Different diatom pore arrays give rise to distinct photonic crystal modes,44 therefore diatom frustule morphology or frustule post-modifications could be tailored for the enhanced capture of selected wavelengths of light. For instance, when an inverse opal TiO2 was deposited onto a common nanocrystalline titanium oxide DSSC electrode an increase in photocurrent was observed.67 It was observed that photonic capture at wavelengths two times the void diameter ±120 nm was enhanced, and incorporation of multiple inverse opal layers of differing void diameters was found to be effective at harnessing a broader spectrum of illumination. Titanium doped frustules, which possess regular arrays of nanostructured silica similar to inverse opals, often with pore lattice constants on the order of one-half of the absorption wavelength of DSSC dyes, could potentially increase efficiency when incorporated into photoanodes. Device efficiency could therefore be improved independently of the other properties of the DSSC.
The incorporation of light scattering materials into photoanodes can enhance the efficiency of a DSSC.68–70 Diatom biosilica has a refractive index of 1.4346 while porous anatase titania thin films have refractive indexes ranging from 1.7 to 2.571 giving diatom-TiO2 layers high dielectric contrast and light scattering within the pore array. The light-scattering properties of native diatom frustules have recently been characterized and it is hypothesized that even native frustules may be incorporated into light capturing device technologies.40,72 Previous studies have also determined that diatom frustules act as light focusing microlenses41,42 which could potentially direct light onto the dye. As a result of enhanced photonic capture, less dye or a thinner photoanode layer may be used, resulting in reduced fabrication costs. In addition, thinning the photoanode layer decreases the electron diffusion distance between the dye and conductive glass electrode, reducing electron – electrolyte recombination and increasing efficiency.73 Therefore, the development of photonic crystal enhanced DSSCs is of great interest and worthy of continued scientific inquiry, as is the use of diatom-based materials in silicon based photovoltaics, which have already been proposed in the patent literature.56
Diatom frustule-TiO2 composites present an ideal addition to dye sensitized solar cells because frustules possess structural characteristics which enhance photon capture, their transparency does not block the penetration of photons, and the semiconducting nature of titania facilitates the flow of electrons. Current work in DSSCs by Rorrer's lab group at Oregon State University has focused on preparing diatom-TiO2 composite materials for incorporation into the DSSC photoanode. In one study,74 the pennate marine diatom Pinnularia sp. (Fig. 1) was used as the platform for the biological fabrication of a diatom silica-titania composite material, where the living diatom was used to metabolically insert nanostructured TiO2 into the periodic structure of the diatom silica.74 The bioprocess approach for the formation of silica-titania frustule composites is a parallel, bottom-up, self-assembly process conducted at ambient temperatures and pressures in a benign seawater environment. The level of biogenic titania observed in the frustule-titania composite was 4.9 g of TiO2/100 g SiO2. However, the titania was enriched within the frustule pores and nanoscale pore features, because the rate of SiO2 deposition was greater than for TiO2.75 The titania within the pores could be converted to crystalline anatase or rutile TiO2 with thermal annealing. The enrichment within the pores creates a two-dimensional spatial organization of nanostructured titania, which may give rise to unique optoelectronic and light-trapping activity,76 useful in the photoanode of a solar cell.
To date, the biogenic frustule-titania composite has not possessed enough semiconducting titania to be differentiated from native silica-only frustules when tested in the photoanode of a DSSC. However, other methods to produce titanium containing frustule replicas have been developed such as reacting diatom silica with TiF4(g)77,78 to produce TiO2 and SiF4(g) or by evaporating Ti metal onto frustules and removing the silica with HF to leave behind a titanium diatom replica shell. The recent discovery that diatom inspired peptides can be modified to precipitate titania, but not silica79 opens the possibility of genetically modifying diatoms to build their frustules based on metal oxides apart from silica, such as titanium, germanium or even gallium.80
The Rorrer lab group has also used diatom frustules as templates for the biomimetic deposition of nanostructured titania.81 The organic matter was removed from live diatoms by treatment with hydrogen peroxide, yielding clean diatom biosilica (frustules). The frustules were then incubated in phosphate buffered saline at pH 8 with the poly-cationic peptide poly-L-lysine (PLL), which is known to precipitate the soluble titanium precursor, TiBALDH, to insoluble titania.82,83 The poly-L-lysine adsorbed to the diatom silica and when exposed to TiBALDH, the result was titania nanoparticles bound to the frustule surface. When the process was repeated, adsorbing PLL to the newly deposited titania and exposing to TiBALDH, more titania was deposited.49,81 Therefore, the concentration of titania in the composite could be tuned to the desired level for any given application. Amorphous titania nanoparticles (10–50 nm diameter) completely packed the frustule pores and the titanium loading on the frustules was found to be as high as 1.13 ± 0.04 g TiO2/g SiO2 after two successive PLL-TiBALDH depositions.
The diatom-TiO2 composite material was then used in a DSSC to enhance the efficiency. The finished device and SEM images of the TiO2 and diatom-TiO2 base layers of the DSSC are pictured in Fig. 4. The TiO2 nanoparticles for the base layer of the DSSC photoanode were prepared by the addition of 3.0 mL acetic acid and 10.0 mL of ethanol to 2.0 g anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (<25 nm, 99.7%, Aldrich) followed by mixing and sonication for 30 min. One drop of the TiO2 paste was placed into a 50 μm deep pool (1.5 cm × 2 cm) which was prepared by placing paste tapes on fluorine doped SnO2 transparent conducting (FTO) glass substrates (Tec 8, sheet resistance 9 Ω/square, Pilkington). The film was made smooth and uniform by the rolling action of a glass rod. The sample was allowed to dry at room temperature before annealing at 350 °C for one hour. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 film was coated with 200 μL of a 20% v/v solution of Titanium (IV) butoxide (97%, Aldrich) in hexane and allowed to air dry at ambient temperature. The film was annealed again at 400 °C for one hour. Analysis by SEM verified the base film had a thickness of approximately 20 μm which corresponds to a mass coverage of 2.5 mg cm−2 of TiO2.

Frustule biosilca was prepared from Pinnularia sp. batch cultured from 500 mL flasks under 30 μE m−2s−1 illumination on a 14:10 light:dark cycle until a stationary phase was reached (approximately 30 days). The mature diatoms were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min and washed 3x with distilled water. The cells were divided into 5 mL pellets. Each pellet was treated with 40 mL of 150:1 H2O2 (30%): HCl (12.2 M) at 80 °C for 24 h which removed the organic material from the frustules. The treated frustules were pelleted (600 × g, 10 min) and rinsed with distilled water (3x) and again with MeOH (3x) and stored in MeOH. TiO2 was deposited on the diatom frustules by the procedure previously described81 and a final mass ratio of 1.13 ± 0.04 g TiO2/g SiO2 was obtained as verified by ICP-AES analysis. The diatom TiO2 composite material was stored in MeOH with a slurry density of 1 mg mL−1.
The diatom frustule layer was added to the TiO2 base layer from a height of 1 mm by the drop wise addition of the diatom-TiO2 slurry from a P200 pipette tip. The slurry was added until 62 μg cm−2 of composite was added to the photoanode, which corresponded to 33 and 29 μg cm−2 of TiO2 and SiO2, respectively. Both the control (no diatom layer) and diatom enhanced solar cells were then annealed at 400 °C for one hour followed by immersion in 0.5 mM N719 dye (RuL2(NCS)2]: 2 TBA, L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid TBA = tetra-n-butylammonium, Dyesol) ethanol solution for 24 h. The photoanodes were then washed once with ethanol and assembled with a Pt-coated FTO glass counter electrode, using parafilm (127 μm thickness) as a spacer. The redox electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.1 M 1-aminopyridinium iodide (97%, Aldrich), 0.1 M KI and 0.05 M I2 in acetonitrile. The electrolyte was loaded into the device by capillary action.
The current–voltage curves comparing DSSCs which had photoanode layers consisting of only TiO2 nanoparticles (control TiO2, n = 9 devices) and DSSCs which had frustule-TiO2 composite material on top of the photoanodes (diatom-TiO2, n = 9 devices) are compared in Fig. 5a. The power vs. voltage curves for the devices which had the median (5th highest) maximum power outputs are presented in Fig. 5b. The current–voltage curves were measured by a source meter (Model 2400, Keithley) when an area of 0.12 cm2 was illuminated under simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight (150 W Model 96000, Oriel). The control photoanode and photoanode plus diatom-TiO2 composite had short-circuit currents (ISC) of 7.3 ± 2.4 and 22.6 ± mA/cm2 and fill factors (FF) of 0.58 ± 0.05 and 0.48 ± 0.07, respectively. The control devices had open-circuit voltages (VOC) of 0.64 ± 0.03 V, but the photoanodes with a diatom-TiO2 layer were slightly lower, with 0.60 ± 0.01 V. A DSSC with a photoanode comprised of only diatom-TiO2 composite material without an anatase TiO2 layer failed to produce current.

All photoanodes had a base layer of 2.5 mg TiO2 mg anatase nanoparticles/cm2. (B) The power-voltage curves for the devices with the median (5th highest) maximum power output. 
The photoanodes which contained the diatom-frustule TiO2 nanocomposite in addition to the TiO2 nanoparticle base layer showed an efficiency of 6.67 ± 1.40% while the photoanode made from only TiO2 nanoparticles had an efficiency of 2.95 ± 1.10%. Recently, it was shown by Ito et al. (2008)70 that the efficiency of a DSSC can be improved by adding a topcoat of light-scattering microcrystalline TiO2 onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode. Also, Park et al. (2010)84 observed an increased DSSC efficiency when the base layer was prepared from nanocrystalline TiO2 conjugated with 5% glass powder. The increased efficiency is believed to be a result of internal light scattering caused by the glass powder. The improved performance in the frustule-TiO2 nanocomposite may therefore be a result of improved light scattering or reflection within the DSSC. The improved performance is unlikely to be a result of increasing the total amount of titania in the photoanode because the mass coverage of TiO2 in the frustule-TiO2 composite is only 33 μg TiO2 cm−2 compared to 2.5 mg TiO2 cm−2 in the nanocrystalline layer. Also, the thickness of the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer in our device was 20 μm, well beyond the optimal of 12–14 μm,70 so any increase in thickness was unlikely to increase efficiency. The DSSC devices described by Ito et al. had efficiencies of greater than 10%. Therefore, in future work it is planned to fabricate DSSCs according to the procedure of Ito et al. and to add the diatom frustule-TiO2 nanocomposite on top of the photoanode by the method previously described. The performance of the Ito et al. device modified by the addition of diatom-TiO2 material may help elucidate the mechanism by which the diatom-based material improves efficiency.
It is believed that the presence of the frustule-TiO2 composite layer may have a detrimental, albeit negligible, effect on the dye regeneration process. It was observed by light microscopy that the dye absorbs directly onto the frustule SiO2 as well as the TiO2. However, the conduction band of SiO2 is too high to accept an injected charge. Therefore, any excited dye molecules bound to the silica will convert the photons to thermal energy rather than create electric current. Likewise, the dye molecules also bind to islands of TiO2 nanospheres which could possibly be electrically isolated within the pores of the silica frustule. This will also create thermal energy or lead to an accumulation of negative potential in the isolated TiO2 which could hinder charge injection. The amount of exposed SiO2 and electrically isolated TiO2 account for a small amount of the photoanode surface area and mass, respectively, so these effects are believed to be minimal.
Electroluminescent display devices
An electroluminescent device utilizing frustules with biologically inserted germanium oxide (1.6 ± 0.1 wt % Ge) as the luminescent source has been developed51 and is presented schematically in Fig. 6. To construct the electroluminescent display device the Si–Ge oxide composite frustules were spin coated onto an Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate and then coated with 400 nm HfSiO4 and 100 nm layers of Al by atomic layer deposition. The electroluminescent (EL) and photoluminescent (PL) spectra of the devices containing frustules with GeO2 and control frustules with no GeO2 are presented with permission from Advanced Materials51 in Fig. 7a,b. While native biosilica is known to possess blue PL85–88 the diatom-GeO2 devices possessed bothPL and EL. When a voltage was applied to the device, the frustules that contained metabolically inserted germanium oxide emitted two bands of emission, the first between 300 and 500 nm, and the second between 640 and 780 nm. When a voltage was applied to frustules containing no germanium oxides, no EL was observed. Both types of frustule material displayed consistent PL with emission peaks at 460 nm when excited at 337 nm. However, the frustules containing GeO2 displayed a higher PL, likely because Ge–O defects in amorphous silica also possess PL89–91 which would superimpose on the PL of the biosilica. The Ge-doped biosilica had markedly different EL and PL spectra, so it is evident that the two emissions arose from different mechanisms.
 Fig. 6  Schematics of electroluminescent (EL) device structures. (a) when a current is applied photons are created in the dopant luminescent centers of a phosphor and photons from a broad spectrum of wavelengths are emitted. (b) In the diatom EL device photons were created in the Ge-luminescent centers of the Ge-frustule composite. Only wavelengths permitted in the periodic nanostructure of the frustule were emitted and recorded by the CCD detector. 
 Fig. 7  Comparison of a) electroluminescence and b) photoluminescence spectra for diatom frustules that contained no Ge and 1.6 wt % Ge. 
The insertion of germanium oxides into the biosilica caused a change in the pore structure while the overall shape of the frustule was maintained.75 When the GeO2-modified frustules were modeled as photonic crystals the expected optical modes of the frustule pore lattice were consistent with the emission bands from the device.92,93 It was hypothesized that the EL was generated by germanium induced luminescent centers, and the wavelengths emitted were a function of the lattice constant. Therefore the EL spectrum was a function of structural and elemental composition.
In addition to metabolically adding germanium to the frustules, the diatom pore lattice constants can be changed by the metabolic insertion of nickel,94 or atomic layer,95 layer by layer,96 chemical bath97,98 or ultrasonic deposition99 to the frustule surface, or possibly even genetic manipulation.12,100,101 It may therefore be possible to develop diatom frustules with tuned elemental and pore lattice constant to give any desired optoelectronic properties. These efforts represent the first steps towards utilizing components fabricated through cell culture in electronic devices. While more study is needed, the development of green micro- and nano-electronic components could potentially lead to more environmentally friendly display devices.
High surface area battery materials
Battery cells based on lithium ion insertion are the most widely used secondary battery cells due to their high capacity, and fast charge/discharge rates compared to conventional nickel-cadmium and nickel metal hydride cells.102 Reviews of lithium ion secondary cells are available in the literature.103,104 However, energy density, energy capacity, electrode durability and charge/discharge rates must be further improved for future generations of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), portable electronic devices, electric hybrid vehicles, and high discharge batteries used for various applications. To achieve the desired battery characteristics, electrode materials with the ability to intercalate a greater number of lithium ions at faster rates and over more charge cycles will be required. Two materials which show promise as electrode materials are nanocrystalline silicon metal and several polymorphs of TiO2. There have been several reviews of silicon- and titania-based electrode materials105–107 and three dimensional nanostructured battery architectures.108 However, these electrode materials have several drawbacks, including structural breakdown in the case of Si, and poor diffusion and conductivity for TiO2. Conversion of the material into nanostructures greatly enhances performance by decreasing crystal strain and increasing the surface area available for ion transport.73,109 Both Si and TiO2 based nanostructured materials have been synthesized through bio-inspired pathways without costly equipment, which infers the great potential of diatom nanobiotechnology towards the commercialization of these materials.

        Silicon metal is of great interest in lithium ion secondary cells because it has the highest known theoretical charge capacity, 4200 mAh g−1,110 compared to 372 mAh g−1 for the commonly used graphite anodes.111Silicon-based anodes have found only limited use because of rapid capacity fade caused by large volume changes of up to 400% during Li insertion and release, which causes strain-related crumbling of the anode material. Crumbling causes discontinuities in the material which inhibits the ability of the anode to carry charge to the charge collector. While micron-sized silicon structures suffer from expansion and contraction related material degradation,105 it has been demonstrated that nanostructured Si materials have a greater ability to accommodate Li insertion and removal without structural break-down.112–114 However, native nanostructured diatom silica does not possess the physical properties required of a battery electrode, but potentially could be transformed to possess the desired properties. Indeed, such a material has been proposed in the patent literature.56
High temperature gas displacement reactions can be used to convert diatom frustules into highly porous silicon.48,54,55 A lithium ion secondary battery based on this type of highly porous diatom-based anode material is presented in Fig. 8. The diatom frustule maintains native morphology throughout the gas displacement reaction while transforming into silicon metal with a surface area of >500 m2 g−1, higher than the measured surface area of 158 m2 g−1 in chemically prepared porous silicon nanoparticles currently used in experimental lithium secondary cell anodes.115 Greater than 30% of the pore volume in the biogenically derived silicon material was found in pores with diameters less than 2 nm, which gave the silicon an open crystal structure highly amenable to the intercalation of lithium ions. This “atomically porous” expanded crystal structure would also decrease the atomic bond strain seen in solid crystal Si during lithium intercalation.

An alternative method to create artificial silica-based diatom structures utilised block copolymers to create an inverse carbon replica of a frustule which was then filled with silica precursors and calcined to create a positive silica replica.116 This method produced a frustule-like silica structure with a surface area of >400 m2 g−1. This material could undergo the previously mentioned gas displacement reaction48 to become even higher surface area silicon, further reducing the effects of intercalation induced strain.
It has also been demonstrated that reducing the length scale and feature size of the electrode material increases charge/discharge kinetics.117 The frustule-like silicon material is continuous, so charge transport does not rely on physical contact between nanoparticles. Increased charge transport kinetics reduces the need for conductive carbon fillers, which is undesirable because it increases the battery mass and decreases the specific charge density (C g−1). The gas displacement reactions could also be performed on biomimetically precipitated metal oxide nanoparticles, which may further enhance surface area and intercalation kinetics, but at the expense of requiring particle-to-particle dependent charge transport. In order to prepare a microscale electrode device from silicon nanomaterials the structures could be patterned,118 stamped by soft lithography119 or individual frustules could even be isolated as micro-anodes for use as MEMS microbatteries.53–56
Ordered diatom layers can even be grown as a self-ordered film120 followed by removal of the organic material by thermal baking121 or reactive surface treatments as presented in Fig. 9. For example, the Rorrer lab group cultivated diatoms on conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) glass and removed the organic material by oxygen plasma (Fig. 9). This is the first report of oxygen plasma cleaned diatoms on a transparent, conductive surface. Given that the ideal anode material will have high capacity, structural durability and fast ion insertion kinetics, a nanostructured silicon metal with a high level of nanometer-scale pores is highly desired. Progress is being made toward the goal of employing these materials in energy storage applications and it is hoped that continued scientific discussion and insights in this field will eventually lead to the existence of such devices.

        Titanium-based battery materials
Nanostructured titanium oxide polymorphs, such as rutile, anatase, and TiO2(B), are inexpensive anode materials that have an increased ability to store energy when nanostructured. Additionally, these materials experience small volume changes (<4%) during intercalation and de-intercalation of Li+ ions which minimizes structural degradation and imparts a long lifespan to the anode.66,122–124 Using partially crystalline titania, similar to the titania produced biomimetically, has also been shown to improve cycling stability.125
The primary drawback of titanium oxides are their slow lithium ion insertion kinetics caused by unidirectional diffusion within the TiO2 crystal structure, which can be overcome by biomimetic means as presented in Fig. 10. In rutile TiO2 the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions in the ab crystal plane and along the larger “channels” within the c-direction of the crystal structure are 10−15 cm2s−1 and 10−6 cm2s−1, respectively.126 Computational studies of lithium ion transport in titanates127,128 confirm anisotropic diffusion behavior. Therefore, designing a titanium oxide nanomaterial to have porosity in the ab plane will provide lithium ions access to the fast diffusing c-direction channels, greatly increasing the effective diffusivity.
Porosity in the ab crystal plane can be introduced biomimetically. During the biomimetic conversion of soluble titanium to inorganic titania, the catalyst peptides are entrapped within the nanoparticles.23,83,129 Upon thermal annealing the poly-L-lysine or peptide-based catalysts are volatilized, leaving behind an atomic-level pore network within the particle, including the ab crystal-plane. This will greatly increase lithium ion access to the fast diffusing c crystal-plane and greatly increase the intercalation rates. The nanoporous biomimetic titania can be converted to anatase, rutlile or TiO2(B) according to annealing conditions74,81 making it suitable as a highly porous battery electrode. While the deliberate introduction of atomic level pores in TiO2-based battery materials have not yet been realized, the potential of diatom nanobiotechnology in this field is undeniable.122

(c) biomimetic titania particle calcined to crystalline titania, the organic catalyst has been volatilized, leaving nanopores. (d) lithium ions rapidly intercalating into the particle nanopores and diffusing into the crystalline structure. 
The charge/discharge rates of the battery cell could be further improved by using diatom or diatom inspired peptide catalysts to biomimetically facilitate the formation of three dimensional battery materials similar in structure to those proposed by previous studies108 and presented in Fig. 11. First, a polyelectrolyte barrier layer could be deposited onto a nanostructured cathode, followed by adsorption of a biomimetic catalyst. An anode material could be mineralized by the catalyst on the surface of the barrier layer. The high surface area between nanostructured solid phases and the close proximity of the anode to cathode would facilitate fast ion transport between anode and cathode yielding the ability to rapidly charge and discharge. It is hoped that a greater awareness of diatom bionanotechnology will inspire research from diverse lab groups towards the development of these materials.

(b) deposition of a polyelectrolyte multilayer onto the cathode. (c) adsorption of a diatom inspired biomimetic catalyst. (d) exposure to a soluble titanium precursor and the precipitation of a nanostructured titania anode onto the polyelectrolyte. 
Bio-based nano-ordering of battery materials
The specific internal surface area of a battery cell or device can be further increased by controlling the spatial arrangement of the nanostructured electrode materials through self-assembly. Increasing internal surface area increases the available area for ion intercalation and de-intercalation which increases charge/discharge rates. Currently, “top-down” methods used to create high surface area patterns, such as lithography, laser ablation and ionization are energy intensive and require expensive equipment, making their use environmentally unfriendly and cost-prohibitive.130 Therefore, the use of bio-based methods of nano-ordering and nano-structuring has great potential in this field.
An alternate method to produce structured, hierarchical structures could be to prepare a planar, synthetic reactor space, similar to the silicon deposition vesicle, where catalysis of soluble substrates to metal oxides would occur. The application a biomimetic nanoreactor could potentially be used to create nanopatterned composite materials or 3-D battery architectures, and is presented in Fig. 12. If the conditions within the SDV could be replicated and extended to device-sized length scales, the biomineralization of hierarchical micro- and nano-structures could be directly fabricated into high surface area silicon or titania oxide battery electrodes, or DSSCs. In previous studies, low-energy, environmentally friendly biological and biologically inspired catalysts such as viruses,130–133proteins,134 bio-inspired peptides,82,83,129 liposomes,135 or dendrimers136 have been used to catalyze soluble species to nanosized inorganic materials. These catalysts have even been combined with bio-inspired templates such as vesicles,137–139 synthetic planar membranes,140 and polyelectrolyte multi-layers141–145 in an attempt to self-assemble the catalysts to greater control structure formation. While able to form nanosized features, the ability of synthetic biomineralization techniques to produce highly structured device scale films has been limited because they lack the control over the precursor delivery or template ordering found in silicon deposition vesicles.

(g) Polyelectrolytes are layered over the titania particles and catalytic virus particles are organized on top. (h) The virus particles precipitate a nanostructured cathode material, such as CoO2 (i) A new template is layered over the top of the cathode and the titania precipitating catalyst is adsorbed. (j) after exposure to soluble Ti-precursors a new titania layer is formed, forming the basis for a 3-D battery architecture. 
To this end, catalysts such as diatom-inspired peptides could be templated or functionalized to substrates and precursors such as the soluble silica precursor tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) or soluble titanium precursor titanium(IV) bis(ammonium lactate)dihydroxide (TiBALDH) could be delivered to the reactor space in a controlled manner by engineering membrane pores,146 by passive diffusion through a diblock copolymer,147,148carbon nanofiber membranes,149,150 or membrane bound proteins,151 resulting in high surface area silica or titania nanostructures. Additionally, catalyst deposition and formation of inorganic nanostructures can be repeated on top of existing nanostructured layers49,81,152,153 potentially producing even more complex or multi-component 3-dimensional nanoarchitectures. A simplified method has linked catalyzing poly-peptides directly to functionalized surfaces for the production of nanostructured silica based thin films.154–156 For silicon-based nanoarchitectures, the silicon structures can be converted to nanoporous silicon, as previously described.48 The creation of synthetic SDVs or biomimetic nanoreactors is an exciting and challenging problem which will likely require the collaboration of groups from many fields of expertise. It is hoped that this challenge will be met because the development of these fabrication methods would have a positive impact in a broad range of fields.
Outlook
A lot of potential exists for the modification of the diatom genome for the development of novel metal oxide nanostructured materials.12 There exist 2 × 105 species of diatoms157 each having a different frustule morphology genetically determined by the species specific silica catalyzing proteins contained within the silica deposition vesicle.100 Diatom genomes have been extensively studied with some species, such as Thalassiosira pseudonana, being completely sequenced. As peptide sequences and functional groups that alter frustule morphology are deciphered, genetic manipulation of the genes controlling the species specific polyamines can be altered. This will enable the frustule pore shape, size, spacing, and intrapore nanostructures to be tailored for specific applications. This could lead to the direct development of device-ready materials without the need for further frustule modification.
The future of fabricating diatom-inspired hierarchical materials may also be to transfer the formation of the structures from inside the living organism to a platform where the nanopore arrays can be extended to scales exceeding the physical dimensions of the original organism. Given recent advances in biomimetics and cell culture fabrication of hierarchical nanostructed metal oxides, biological methods may be developed to produce 3-D photonic devices such as germanium and silicon inverse woodpiles,158,159 which could enhance the efficiency of solar cells.
In addition to optimizing diatom inspired metal oxides for elemental content and structure, the frustule surfaces could be functionalized with organic molecules47 to yield a variety of electronic, display, or sensing properties. While many of the methods to fabricate hierarchical, nanostructured metal oxide composites based on diatom nanotechnology have been researched, many areas of research are left to be investigated and methods to apply these technologies toward useful devices has only recently commenced. It is hoped that continued conversation regarding the potential applications of diatom bionanobiotechnology will lead to not only the realization of the devices which have already been proposed, but that new investigators will enter the field and offer ideas towards applications that have not yet been envisioned.

Broader context
There is enormous interest in bio-inspired approaches for the synthesis of photonic, semiconductor and metal oxide nanomaterials for device applications, as they offer the opportunity for self assembly into hierarchical structures. Diatoms, a class of single-celled algae, have been touted as the paradigm for the bio-inspired synthesis of nanostructured materials because they produce a hierarchically structured silica skeleton, called a frustule, with periodic micro- and nanoscale features from soluble silicon by a bottom-up, self-assembly process at ambient conditions. However, even though the unique photonic properties of diatom frustules and the ease with which diatom frustule chemistry can be manipulated have already been demonstrated, there is a lack of progress in the field of diatom-based device fabrication. To stimulate advances in this forward-looking field, this paper examines the potential application of diatom nanobiotechnology in solar cells, battery anodes and display devices. Specifically, a working dye sensitized solar cell and an electroluminescent display incorporating diatom frustules will be presented. The possibility of diatom nanobiotechnology to be used in the fabrication of nanostructured battery electrodes and future prospects in the field will also be discussed.
