    , Accepted 6th October 2019First published on 7th October 2019AbstractHerein, we present the direct aqueous synthesis of manganese (Mn) doped CuInSe2 (Mn-CISe) quantum dots (QDs) under microwave irradiation to improve the photochemical properties of solar cells. As a result of Mn doping, the narrower bandgap energy of Mn-CISe leads to higher visible light absorption. The Mn-CISe QDs are therefore used as photosensitizers in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), exhibiting enhanced performance which is dependent on Mn concentration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to construct an Mn-CISe sensitized-TiO2 photoanode to boost the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs. The incorporation of Mn into CISe increases short-circuit current, which is ascribed to the effective injection of the excited electrons from QDs into TiO2 and the consequent higher electron lifetime, likely through a newly formed Mn midgap in the CISe band structure. Compared to the undoped QDs, Mn-CISe QDSSCs show a shorter electron transport time (τt) and a longer electron recombination time (τr) which are studied by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy, respectively. In fact, a combination of higher light-harvesting efficiency, slower charge recombination, and a longer electron lifetime gives rise to a maximum photovoltaic performance of 6.28%.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot (QD) materials are of considerable interest for solar cells due to their astonishing optoelectronic properties such as facilely tunable bandgap energy by controlling the particle size, high extinction coefficients, long excited-state lifetimes, generation of multiple excitons, and large intrinsic dipole moments and their easy fabrication process.1,2 Among different classes of QDs, synthesis and applications of IV–VI,3–6 II–VI,7–10 and III–V11 QDs have been widely studied.12,13 However, growing concern over potential health and environmental hazards due to the intrinsic toxicity of Pb, Hg, and Cd seriously restricts their applications. Recently, I–III–VI ternary QDs comprised of CuInX2 (X = S, Se, and Te)14–16 and AgInX2 (X = S, Se, and Te)17–19 have attracted substantial attention as eco-friendly and low toxic alternatives for replacing traditional Cd, Pb, and Hg based materials. The I–III–VI ternary QDs have been the focus of recent studies as they contain benign elements and show excellent electrical and optical properties.20
The Cu containing members of CuInS2 (CIS) and CuInSe2 (CISe) QDs show unique properties of a high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) and a comparatively narrow bandgap.21 These features make them prospective candidates for various technological applications such as solar energy conversion materials, photocatalysts, lasers, light-emitting diodes, and biological labels.20 Particularly, the CISe QDs compared to the CIS QDs are considered as more promising materials with a larger exciton Bohr radius (10.6 nm) and a narrower bandgap (1.04 vs. 1.5 eV), which can extend the light-absorption range to the near-infrared (NIR) region. Li et al. reported an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 6.79% by alloying CISe with other wider bandgap materials.21 Du et al. reported high quality ∼4 nm Zn–Cu–In–Se alloyed QDs with an efficiency of 11.6%.22 Furthermore, Zhong et al. achieved a champion PCE of up to 12.75% by sequential deposition of the synthesized Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) and CdSe quantum dots,23 enhancing the PCE (12.57%) of pristine Cu-deficient ZCISe QDs.24
Doping transition metal ions into QDs would lead to new materials showing fascinating electronic and photophysical properties. In fact, the dopant creates electronic states in the mid-gap region of the QDs and thus changes the charge separation and recombination process.25,26 In general, the doping process can be attained using either single doping12,13,27,28 or double doping29–32 for an extensive variety of applications such as light-emitting devices, optoelectronics, biological labeling, and solar energy harvesting.31,32 A variety of transition metal dopants have already been employed to boost the PCE of QDSSCs. For instance, Nguyen et al. reported an improvement in efficiency up to 4.22% by doping Cu2+ into CdSe QDs.33 Recently, Chang et al. have synthesized In2S3/CIS QDs with the Mn dopant, which showed an enhanced efficiency of up to 8.0%.2 A PCE of 4.72% was achieved by using Hg-doped PbS QDs,34 while maximum PCEs of 1.25% and 3.16% were attained by doping Ag13 and Co35 into CdS QDs. Among these transition metals, Mn is the most common dopant in QDs due to its ability to modify the electronic and photophysical properties of QDs. Theoretically, it can form an intermediate band between QDs and TiO2 and facilitate the generation, collection, and injection of the excited electrons from QDs into the TiO2 film.36
Recently, the green synthesis of QDs has gained attention due to its widespread benefit across many facets of sustainability, including using less harmful materials or more energy-efficient manufacturing processes. For example, replacing commonly used organic solvents in the synthesis of QDs with an aqueous phase improves the sustainability of the products through an eco-friendly, economically viable, and straightforward approach. In the present work, we prepared Mn-doped CISe (Mn-CISe) QDs using a facile microwave-assisted method in an aqueous phase. Compared with pristine QDs, the Mn-CISe QDs show a noticeable enhancement of the overall PCE. The mechanism has also been discussed in detail to explain the improvement of the PCE of Mn-CISe sensitized QDSSCs. The effect of Mn incorporation is studied in terms of changes in the energy bandgap (Eg) structure, electron lifetime, electron transport and recombination lifetime and their correlation with the photovoltaic parameters of QDSSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Copper(II) nitrate hemipentahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, ≥98+%), manganese acetate anhydrous (Mn(Ac)2, 98+%), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3, 99%), selenium oxide (SeO2, 99.4%) and thioglycolic acid (TGA) (C2H4O2S, 97+%) were bought from Alfa-Aesar. Indium(III) nitrate dihydrate (In(NO3)3·2H2O, 99.99%), citric acid tri-sodium (SC) (C6H5O7Na3, ≥98%), glutathione (GSH) (C10H17N3O6S, ≥98%), copper sulfate pentahydrate (Cu(SO4)·5H2O, ≥98%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, ≥98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, 98+%, Acros Organics), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O, 99.8%, Baker Analyzed®), and urea ((H2N)2CO, 99%, Showa Chemicals) were also used. All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade.
2.2. Preparation of a mesoporous TiO2 film
In the present work, Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) glass substrates were used for the fabrication of the electrodes. First, the FTO glass substrate was cleaned ultrasonically with soap water, followed by washing with deionized water, isopropanol, and acetone. A mesoporous TiO2 film was prepared with TiO2 paste containing two absorbing and three scattering layers. The film was screen-printed on the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by sintering in a muffle furnace (DF20, SJ High Technology Company, Taiwan) at 500 °C for 30 min.
2.3. Preparation of CISe and Mn-CISe QDs
Firstly, 0.001 mol SeO2 and 0.002 mol NaBH4 were dissolved in an aqueous solution and reacted for 15 min under a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain the Se precursor. CISe and Mn-CISe QDs were prepared according to the following procedure. For the typical synthesis of CISe QDs, Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.01 mmol), GSH (0.04 mmol), SC (0.14 mmol), and In(NO3)3·2H2O (0.06 mmol) were mixed in 15 mL of deionized (DI) water. The reaction proceeded under microwave heating (190 °C) for 10 min. In the case of Mn-CISe QDs, the same procedure was followed except for the addition of Mn (2, 4, 8, and 10 μmol) before Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (0.01 mmol). The QDs were precipitated with isopropanol followed by centrifugation, before dispersing them in TGA and DI water for further use. The purification of CISe and Mn-CISe QDs was similar to our previously reported procedure.2
2.4. Photoanode sensitization
10 mg of CISe or Mn-CISe QDs was dissolved in 5 ml of DI water containing TGA as a co-adsorbent. The prepared TiO2 films were then put into the QD solution for 24 h, followed by washing with MeOH and drying by using nitrogen flow. The QD deposited TiO2 film electrode was passivated with the ZnS layer by the SILAR method. Firstly, the QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(Ac)2·2H2O in 50 mL of MeOH for 1 min and rinsed with MeOH. The cell was then immersed in 50 mL of a methanol/water (70:30 vol%) solution of Na2S.9H2O (0.1 M) for 1 min and washed with methanol. A total of four cycles of ZnS deposition onto the photoanode by the SILAR method were used for effective surface passivation.
2.5. Device fabrication
Firstly, a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method was used to prepare the Cu2S counter electrode (CE). In brief, the cleaned FTO glass substrate was immersed in an aqueous solution of (H2N)2CO (0.01 mol), (Na2S2O3) (0.01 mol), and Cu(SO4)·5H2O (0.002 mol) and held for 2 h in an oven (65 °C). Afterward, the deposited film was rinsed with DI water and ethanol consecutively prior to drying under N2 flow, followed by sintering at 130 °C. To assemble QDSSC devices, TiO2/CISe or TiO2/Mn-CISe photoanodes and the Cu2S CE were sandwiched using a 60 μm-thick Surlyn spacer. Then, a polysulfide electrolyte containing 1.8 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in DI water was injected before measurement. The active area of the solar cell was defined using a metal mask with an area of 0.16 cm2.
2.6. Characterization
Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a UV-Visible spectrometer (JASCO V-630) and a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope working at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Elemental composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Horiba model JY2000-2). The photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells were evaluated using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2. Intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) was performed using a diode laser with a wavelength of 457 nm at different light densities (from 30 to 150 W m−2) with modulation control. Electron transport times (τt) were estimated based on eqn (1): τt = 1/(2πfIMPS)(1)where fIMPS indicates the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS imaginary component.
Similarly, electron recombination lifetimes (τr) were calculated from eqn (2): τr = 1/(2πfIMVS)(2)where fIMVS is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded under the illumination of a 300 W xenon lamp and a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130, Newport, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with an impedance analyzer (Zennium, Germany) at a forward bias of −0.6 V, applying a 10 mV AC sinusoidal signal over a frequency of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
The Mn-CISe QDs were synthesized by incorporation of different Mn concentrations (0, 2, 4, 8, and 10 μmol) into CISe QDs and the samples are named according to concentrations as CM0, CM2, CM4, CM8, and CM10, respectively. In this strategy, water-soluble colloidal Mn-CISe QDs were prepared through a one-pot microwave route in the presence of SC and GSH. Fig. 1a shows a low-resolution TEM image of Mn-doped QDs (CM8) with an average particle size of ∼5 nm. The HR-TEM image of the QDs in Fig. 1b shows high crystallinity and the lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.33 nm which is associated with the (112) plane of tetragonal CISe QDs. The EDS of CM8 QDs indicated the existence of Mn, Cu, In, and Se, as shown in Fig. 1c. XRD results of the CM8 QDs are shown in Fig. 1d; the peaks at 26.58°, 44.23°, and 52.39° are attributed to the lattice planes of (112), (220), and (312), respectively, and correspond to the tetragonal phase of CuInSe2 (JCPDS no. 40-1487). The structural properties of pristine (CM0) QDs were also studied, which showed no significant differences in their morphology and crystal structure from those of the CM8 sample, as revealed in Fig. S1.† The EDS of CM0 QDs indicated the presence of Cu, In, and Se, as displayed in Fig. S1c.† The chemical composition of the samples was determined quantitatively by ICP-AES as shown in Table S1.† ICP data show that the concentration of cations is quite close to the intended stoichiometry.

The absorption spectra of CM0, CM2, CM4, CM8, and CM10 QDs are displayed in Fig. 2a. The Mn-doped QDs showed a broader absorption range and enhanced optical absorption in the visible region in comparison with the pristine QDs (CM0). The PL emission of CM0, CM2, CM4, CM8, and CM10 QDs at an excitation wavelength of 467 nm is shown in Fig. 2b. It is evident that while the emission peaks showed no significant changes, emission intensity was decreased, which could be due to non-radiative recombination processes promoted by increasing Mn doping.37 Favorably, the absorption spectra of photoanodes sensitized with QDs showed a similar trend. The digital images and absorption spectra of the CM0, CM2, CM4, CM8, and CM10 QD sensitized-TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. S2.†

The band gaps of QDs were calculated by fitting absorption spectra using the direct allowed transition form of the Wood and Tauc equation.38 The obtained bandgaps of CM0 and CM8 QDs are 1.81 and 1.53 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. S3.† The slight shift in the optical band gap upon doping Mn into CISe QDs might be explained by the formation of a midgap by the Mn dopant.26,39,40 It is suggested that the absorption enhancement due to changes in the band structure could increase the light-harvesting efficiency of QDSSCs.26
Mn-Doped QD-sensitized photoanodes with the configuration of TiO2/Mn-QD/ZnS were prepared, and the corresponding cell devices were constructed using Cu2S counter electrodes and polysulfide electrolytes. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices are displayed in Fig. 3a and the relevant J–V parameters, i.e., short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and overall PCE, obtained using CM0, CM2, CM4, CM8, and CM10 QDs are summarized in Table 1. The cells with pristine (CM0) QDs showed the best efficiency of 4.83%. For the case of Mn-CISe samples, the device performance improved upon increasing the dopant concentration, and the best photovoltaic performance was obtained for the photoanode synthesized using CM8 QDs. Interestingly, CM8 QDs enhanced the PCE (6.28%) by nearly 30% with the highest value of JSC (18.11 mA cm−2). PCEs for CM2, CM4, and CM10 sensitized cells were 5.66%, 6.16%, and 5.60%, respectively. The average PCE was calculated for five independent experiments. Fig. S4† shows the standard deviation of all photovoltaic parameters. Evidently, as the Mn concentration exceeded 8 μmol, the PCE of CM10 dropped to 5.60%, which was similar to CM2. A plausible explanation might be a lower light absorption of CM10 compared to other Mn-doped samples as can be seen from Fig. 2a.

As shown in Fig. 3b, a similar trend can be seen in photon harvesting and conversion efficiency.41 For example, the IPCE value of the CM8 QDSSC is 71% at 525 nm, which is significantly higher than that of the pristine (CM0) QDSSC device (54% at 515 nm). These observations are in agreement with the J–V curve in Fig. 3a. The schematic diagram in Fig. 4 shows the mechanism of electron injection from Mn-CISe QDs into TiO2 upon the formation of the mid-band gap.36 Photons are captured by QDs under illumination, yielding electron–hole pairs that are rapidly separated into electrons and holes at the interface between TiO2 and QDs. Possibly, the electrons are injected into the TiO2 film through the Mn intermediate band, and the holes are transferred to the redox couple of the polysulfide electrolyte. Thus, Mn-doped QDs improved the efficiency of light-harvesting by enhancing and extending the visible light absorption region as well as boosting charge collection and transfer, which together resulted in an improved JSC. The elevation in JSC is also reflected in the overall PCE of the studied Mn-doped samples. Based on these results, one may conclude that the doping strategy has a crucial impact on the inhibition of charge recombination. As a result, Mn doping extended light absorption by altering the bandgap and facilitated rapid electron injection and charge separation. In other words, the significant increment of JSC is attributed to the enhanced charge generation, injection, or collection leading to an unprecedented PCE of 6.28% by using the Mn-CISe QD sensitized photoanode.
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the mechanism of electron injection from Mn-CuInSe2 QDs into TiO2. 
The effect of Mn on the electronic structure of CISe QDs was further studied by UPS measurements. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, valence band (VB) energies of −4.32 eV and −5.05 eV were obtained for CM0 and CM8, respectively. Using these VB energies and the calculated Eg values from absorption spectra in Fig. 2, the conduction band (CB) energies of CM0 and CM8 QDs were determined. Fig. 5c depicts the schematic energy level diagrams of TiO2, CM0, and CM8 QDs. Compared to the CM0 sample, the CM8 sample showed a decrease in both the CB and Eg. Possibly, the intermediate gap formed after doping altered the CB which led to a higher electron injection rate with consequent improvement of QDSSC performance. In general, a narrow bandgap sensitizer with a higher CB edge than TiO2 improves the injection of photogenerated electrons from QDs into the TiO2 medium which is considered a prerequisite for the enhancement of the PCE of QDSSCs.42–44 Furthermore, QDs with lower Eg can absorb lower energy photons in the solar spectrum.21 Accordingly, the CM8 sample with an Eg of 1.53 eV can harvest more solar energy than the pristine QDs with an Eg of 1.81 eV. In other words, the advantage of Mn doping is twofold: extended and higher light absorption as well as effective electron injection from excited states to the CB of TiO2.

These effects were further explored and verified through EIS, IMPS, and IMVS spectroscopic methods. Firstly, the electron lifetime was studied by EIS to gain an understanding of the role of the newly formed Mn midgap region in the CISe band structure in the injection of the excited electrons and suppression of charge recombination. The Nyquist plot of CM0, CM2, CM4, CM8, and CM10 QDs is shown in Fig. 6a. Table 2 provides fitting results using the equivalent circuit model in Fig. 6b. The parameters of the model are sheet resistance (RS), which is the resistance of the substrate and all the resistances outside of the cell, the interfacial resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte (Rct1), and the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface (Rct2). Besides, constant phase elements (CPEs) are attributed to Rct1 and Rct2.45,46 As for Rs and Rct1, there is no significant difference between each sample, as similar FTO glass substrates, electrolytes, and CEs were utilized for all devices (Table 2). It can be seen that the Rct2 values of the CM8 (2321 Ω), CM2 (1326 Ω), CM4 (1415), and CM10 (694.4) QDSSCs are higher than that of the pristine (CM0) (428 Ω) sample. The increment in the Rct2 value is an indication of easier electron transfer from QDs to TiO2 through a newly formed Mn midgap region in the CISe band structure.

The electron lifetime (τn) was determined from the EIS results in Fig. 6a using the equation τn = Rct2 × CPE2 and the corresponding τn values of QDSSCs are listed in Table 2. The calculated τn obtained from the EIS results exhibits a relatively high value for the cells with the Mn dopant than that of the pristine QDs. The τn values are in the order of CM0 (758.99 ms) < CM10 (1213.12 ms) < CM2 (1870.98 ms) < CM4 (1874.87 ms) < CM8 (1889.29 ms). The increment in the electron lifetime can be associated with the effective injection of the excited electrons from QDs into TiO2 and suppression of charge recombination as a result of the incorporation of the Mn dopant into CISe QDs. As a consequence, achieving a longer τn with Mn-doped QDs, in turn, enables the cells to attain higher photovoltaic performance.
Furthermore, IMPS and IMVS were used to measure τt and τr based on eqn (1) and (2), respectively. Fig. 6c and d show τt and τr estimated as a function of light density for photoanodes with increasing Mn dopant concentration, which reveals a decrease in both the τt and τr of the cells at higher light densities. As presented in Fig. 6c and d, at the same light density, the Mn-CISe QDSSCs show smaller τt and larger τr values compared to pristine (CM0) QDSSCs. These results suggest that the Mn-doped QDSSCs allow a shorter τt and a longer τr, which in turn boost the photovoltaic performance of Mn-CISe QDSSCs.
4. Conclusion
Mn-CISe QDs were synthesized by direct aqueous synthesis under microwave irradiation in an attempt to increase light-harvesting efficiency through the engineering of the QD band structure. Accordingly, the optimized Mn-CISe sensitized photoanode with a JSC of 18.11 mA cm−2 improved the PCE by 30%. The enhancement mechanism was then investigated through spectroscopic methods. It is inferred that the incorporation of Mn into CISe not only contributes to higher light absorption but also leads to a higher injection rate of excited electrons from QDs to TiO2 and suppression of charge recombination. This study exemplifies the incorporation of a dopant into host QDs to obtain alternative photoanodes for QDSSCs with improved device performance.
