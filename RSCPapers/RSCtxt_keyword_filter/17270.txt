    , Accepted 3rd September 2018First published on 4th September 2018AbstractHighly efficient and stable semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite photovoltaic cells are realized by using an ITO/MoOx bilayer conductive oxide as the anode electrode with a cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (CT) based hole-transport material (HTM), which allows bifacial illumination from both sides of the electrodes. The wide bandgap MoOx thin film is not only to be an electron blocking layer, but also to be a passivation layer which can withstand the excessive energy bombardment during the magnetron sputtering process for the deposition of a high-quality ITO thin film. Atomic-force microscopy images, transmittance spectra and water-droplet contact angle images show that the interfacial contact between MoOx and hole transport layer (HTL) strongly influences the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) values for the bifacial perovskite solar cells (0.16 cm2) and modules (11.7 cm2) are 16.38% and 14.96%, respectively. In addition, the PCE of the ITO/MoOx/CT-HTM based perovskite solar module decreases slowly toward a stable value (∼11%) for more than 700 h under wet environment conditions (70 ± 5 RH%).
Introduction
Regular-type tri-halide organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (Au/spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/TiO2/FTO/glass) have reached the desired power conversion efficiency of over 20% (ref. 1–4) for commercial applications. The excellent photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells relies on superior optoelectronic characteristics, such as moderate refractive index, large light absorption coefficient, small exciton binding energy, high carrier mobility and long carrier diffusion length.5–10 In recent years, the thermal stabilities of organic–inorganic perovskite materials have been improved by doping inorganic cations (Rb and/or Cs)11–13 while retaining the PCE. Li-Doped spiro-OMeTAD materials have been widely used as an efficient hole-transport layer (HTL) in regular-type perovskite based solar cells. However, spiro-OMeTAD materials can be degraded due to the diffused I− and CH3NH3+ ions, which prevents the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD, thereby decreasing the electrical properties of spiro-OMeTAD materials.14 A lot of organic hole-transport materials (HTMs) have been developed to be an alternative HTL in order to improve the device stabilities.15–18 It can be found that Au has to be used as the top electrode for realizing excellent and stable photovoltaic performance. To reduce the fabrication cost, Ag is also widely used as the top electrode in perovskite solar cells. However, the fabrication conditions of Ag electrodes can strongly influence the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).19 In general, the Ag electrode has to be thermally deposited on top of an organic electron-transport layer (ETL) or an organic HTL in order to avoid the formation of the Ag/perovksite interface. However, high-quality transparent metal oxide electrodes (ITO and Al-doped ZnO) have to be fabricated by using sputtering methods. It can be predicted that the excessive energy bombardment during the sputtering process for the deposition of a transparent top electrode must damage the ETL or HTL, which results in the formation of recombination centers embedded in the ETL or HTL. In this study, the main goal is to realize highly efficient and stable semi-transparent perovskite solar cells and modules by using an ITO/MoOx/HTL trilayer as the top electrode. In addition, the roles and collocation of the MoOx interlayer were investigated by using atomic-force microscopy images, transmittance spectra and water-droplet contact angle images.
Experiments
A 30 nm thick TiO2 compact layer was deposited on top of the FTO/glass substrate by spraying a solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% of Ti(acac)2OiPr2 in isopropanol) at 450 °C. A 200 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 thin film, which has an average particle size of 20 nm, was printed on top of the compact-TiO2/FTO/glass substrate using a home-made paste and heated to 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box (<1% RH). The perovskite precursor, which consists of PbI2 (1.65 M) and CH3NH3I (1.65 M) in DMSO and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (5/5, v/v), was spin-coated on top of the meso-TiO2/compact-TiO2/FTO/glass substrate with a washing-enhanced nucleation (WEN) process.20–24 Spiro-OMeTAD or CT based organic molecule was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) (50 mg mL−1), and 17.5 μL of a solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Li-TFSI, 520 mg) in acetonitrile (1 mL) and 28.5 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were added to the HTM/CB solution. Then, the solutions were stirred and heated to 80 °C for 20 min. The HTM/CB solution was spin-coated on top of the perovskite/meso-TiO2/compact-TiO2/FTO/glass substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The synthesis, optical properties and electrochemical properties of the CT based HTM are listed in the ESI (Fig. S1–S4†). A MoOx thin film was deposited on top of the HTL/perovskite/meso-TiO2/compact-TiO2/FTO/glass substrate by using the thermal evaporation method. Finally, a transparent 350 nm thick ITO film was deposited as the top electrode by using the radio-frequency magnetron sputtering method. For comparison, a 100 nm thick Ag film was also deposited by the thermal evaporation method as the top electrode. The active areas of cells and modules (five cells in series on the 5 cm × 5 cm substrate) were fixed at 0.16 cm2 and 11.7 cm2, respectively. The schematic of the perovskite solar module is shown in the ESI (Fig. S5†).
An AM 1.5G solar simulator (Yamashita Denso Corporation, YSS-50A, class AAA) was used as the irradiation light source for the current density–voltage (J–V) measurements. An illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was calibrated before testing. The J–V characteristics of the cell under illumination of AM 1.5G simulated sunlight were obtained by applying the external potential bias to the cell and measuring the photocurrent output with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). An incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrometer (EQE-R-3011, ENLI Technology Co. Ltd, Taiwan) calibrated with a single-crystalline silicon reference cell was used for IPCE measurements.
The surface morphologies of the samples were determined by using a tapping-mode atomic-force microscope (Nano-Scope NS3A system, Digital Instrument). The transmittance spectra of the samples were recorded by using a broadband spectrometer (U-4100, Hitachi). The surface wetting properties of the samples were measured by using a contact angle imaging system (JJA-100-S, Jia Yu Apparatus Co. Ltd, Taiwan).
Results and discussion
HTM plays an important role in long-term stability and device performance.25 Various HTMs have been used as an alternative HTL for realizing highly efficient and stable regular-type perovskite solar cells.16 Herein we incorporate an electron-rich CT unit as the core in conjunction with hexoxyl substituted triphenylamine end-caps to construct a novel HTM (Fig. S1†). In order to avoid the formation of AgI at the Ag/perovskite interface, a thermally evaporated MoOx thin film is used as the interlayer between Ag and CT based HTL. The averaged photovoltaic performance from 8 solar cells is listed in Table 1. The JSC (FF) increases from 19.26 mA cm−2 (67.5%) to 21.50 mA cm−2 (74.1%) with an increase in the thickness of the MoOx thin film from 0 nm to 15 nm, which can be explained as due to the increased coverage of MoOx thin films on the HTL. When the thickness of MoOx thin films increases from 15 nm to 20 nm, the FF moderately decreases from 74.1% to 69.8%, which results in a decrease in the PCE from 16.54% to 15.76%. Therefore, the optimal thickness of the MoOx thin film as an interlayer in the regular-type perovskite solar cells is 15 nm. It is noted that the valence band minimum of thermally evaporated MoOx thin films26 is close to the highest occupied molecular orbital of the CT-based HTL (see Fig. S4†). Therefore, the use of a MoOx interlayer does not significantly influence the VOC of perovskite solar cells (see Table 1).

A 15 nm thick MoOx interlayer is sufficient to avoid the formation of the Ag/HTL interface, which results in a highly averaged PCE of 16.85%. During device characterization, the PCE of the perovskite solar cells with a 15 nm thick MoOx interlayer can retain the initial photovoltaic performance for several hours without encapsulation. It means that the MoOx thin film can effectively resist the diffusion of Ag into the HTL during electrical measurements. It also suggests that the MoOx interlayer can resist the excessive energy bombardment during the deposition of the top electrode. To realize semi-transparent perovskite solar cells, an ITO thin film is used as the top electrode. Fig. 1 presents the J–V curves of the perovskite solar cells fabricated with different top electrodes (Ag or ITO) under illumination from the FTO side and ITO side. The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells with different HTLs and top electrodes is listed in Table 2. An excellent PCE of 18.10% can be achieved when Ag and spiro-OMeTAD are used as the top electrode and HTL, respectively. It means that the high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin film can be fabricated on top of the meso-TiO2 thin film by using the one-step spin-coating method with a WEN process. The PCE decreases from 18.10% to 15.84% when spiro-OMeTAD is replaced with CT as the HTL, which is mainly due to the reduction in the VOC (FF) from 1.074 V (73.9%) to 0.980 (73.1%). The reductions in the VOC and FF mean that the hole mobility and filming property of the spiro-OMeTAD film are better than those of the CT film. However, the use of a 15 nm thick MoOx interlayer decreases (increases) the PCE when spiro-OMeTAD (CT) is used as the HTL, which is related to the contact at the MoOx/HTL interface. When the ITO/MoOx bilayer is used as the top electrode, the PCE of the CT based perovskite solar cells is higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD based perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the ITO/MoOx/CT trilayer is an appropriate candidate for the extraction of holes in the bifacial regular-type perovskite solar cells. A high PCE of 16.38% can be realized in the CT based bifacial perovskite solar cells when illuminated from the FTO side. And, the PCE of the bifacial perovskite solar cells decreases from 16.38% (15.54%) to 14.72% (13.84%) when illuminated from the ITO side, which can be explained as due to the partial incident light (wavelength of 400 to 500 nm) being absorbed by the hole transport layer. This was confirmed from the transmittance spectra (Fig. 6) and IPCE data (Fig. S7†).

To demonstrate that the bifacial perovskite photovoltaic device has the potential in commercial applications, the perovskite module with five cells in a series configuration is fabricated on a 5 cm × 5 cm FTO glass substrate, as shown in Fig. 2. The module with the ITO electrode has a semi-transparent appearance, but that with the Ag electrode is opaque. Fig. 3 presents the J–V curves of the CT based perovskite solar modules with different top electrodes. The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar modules with different top electrodes is listed in Table 3. The PCE of the CT based perovskite photovoltaic device slightly decreases from 17.25% to 16.43% when the active area increases from 0.16 cm2 to 11.7 cm2, which indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3, CT and MoOx thin films can be uniformly fabricated on a large-scale substrate. Moreover, the PCE of the bifacial perovskite photovoltaic device under 1 sun illumination from the FTO side (ITO side) is moderately reduced from 16.38% (14.72%) to 14.96% (13.61%) when the active area increases from 0.16 cm2 to 11.7 cm2, which is probably related to the uniformity of the preparation of each layer in this solar module.

To evaluate the device stabilities, the CT based perovskite solar modules were illuminated under a wet environment (26 ± 2 °C, 70 ± 5 RH%) for more than 700 hours. Before the long-term stability test, the experiment of maximum power point tracking (Fig. S8†) was performed. The maximum PCE of the ITO/MoOx/CT based perovskite solar module is 15.15%, which confirms the high-efficiency photovoltaic device. Fig. 4 presents the time-dependent photovoltaic performance. When the Ag/MoOx bilayer is used as the top electrode, the PCE decreases gradually toward zero within 250 hours. The decaying curve (black dotted line) exhibits two decay rates which can be explained as due to the diffusion time of Ag into the HTL and reaction with CH3NH3PbI3. It means that the MoOx interlayer cannot effectively block the diffusion of Ag into the HTL. Before the diffused Ag reaches the HTL/perovskite interface (exposure time <150 h), the FF is inversely proportional to the recombination centers (Ag nanoparticles) embedded in the HTL.19 When the exposure time is larger than 150 hours, the accumulated Ag nanoparticles at the HTL/perovskite interface can generate AgI and simultaneously trap the electrons and holes,27 and the contact line between the electrodes becomes yellow, which forms the AgI lines (as shown in Fig. S6†), thereby strongly degrading the photovoltaic performance. When the ITO/MoOx bilayer is used as the top electrode, the photovoltaic performance decreases slowly toward a stable PCE of ∼11%. The decaying curve (red dotted line) exhibits a slow decay rate, which can be explained as due to the formation of the surface passivation (PbI2) at the perovskite grain boundaries.28 It also means that the MoOx interlayer can effectively avoid the formation of recombination centers (ITO nanoparticles) in the HTL and the MoOx/ITO bilayer structure can effectively minimize the moisture-induced degradation on the photovoltaic performance.
 Fig. 4  Time-dependent photovoltaic performance of the CT based perovskite solar modules under a wet environment (26 °C ± 2 °C, 70 ± 5 RH%). 
The 15 nm thick MoOx interlayer can effectively passivate the CT during the deposition of the Ag thin film or ITO thin film, thereby increasing the photovoltaic performance. However, the use of a 15 nm thick MoOx interlayer degrades the PCE of the spiro-OMeTAD based perovskite solar cells from 18.10% to 16.58%. The AFM images, transmittance spectra, and water-droplet contact angle images were used in order to understand the contacts at the MoOx/CT and MoOx/spiro-OMETAD interfaces. Fig. 5 presents the AFM images of the CT/perovskite/FTO/glass, MoOx/CT/perovskite/FTO/glass, spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/FTO/glass, and MoOx/spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/FTO/glass samples. The surface roughness of the MoOx/CT/perovskite/FTO/glass sample is smaller than that of the CT/perovskite/FTO/glass sample, which means that the 15 nm thick MoOx can effectively fill the nanometer-scale grooves of the CT thin film. However, the use of a 15 nm thick MoOx interlayer does not reduce the surface roughness of the spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/FTO/glass sample, which means that the surface of the spiro-OMeTAD thin film is not completely covered by the MoOx thin film. Fig. 6 presents the transmittance spectra of the spiro-OMeTAD/FTO/glass, spiro-OMeTAD/MoOx/FTO/glass, CT/FTO/glass, and MoOx/CT/ITO/glass samples. The amplitude of the interference ripples in the transmittance spectrum (black line) is reduced by covering the spiro-OMeTAD/FTO/glass sample with a 15 nm thick MoOx thin film. The reduction in the ripple's amplitude is not related to the light absorption from the capping layer because MoOx is a wide bandgap material. Therefore, it can be attributed to the increase in the refractive index of the roughened surface from 1.63 (spiro-OMeTAD) to 2.11 (MoOx) which scatters the incident light and thereby results in a lower amplitude of the interference ripples (red line in Fig. 6). It means that the contact at the MoOx/spiro-OMeTAD interface is not smooth. However, it is surprising that the capping layer does not influence the transmittance spectrum of the CT/FTO/glass sample, which indicates the formation of a smooth contact at the MoOx/CT interface. In order to explore the interfacial contact between MoOx and HTL (spiro-OMeTAD or CT), the surface wetting properties of the MoOx, spiro-OMeTAD, and CT thin films were examined as shown in Fig. 7. The spiro-OMeTAD (CT) thin film exhibits a partial wetting (moderate wetting) behavior, which reflects the intrinsic nature of the corresponding molecular structures. The MoOx thin film exhibits a moderate wetting behavior which indicates a low oxygen defect density.29 Therefore, the formation of a dense and smooth contact at the MoOx/CT interface is due to the similar surface properties, which can minimize the formation of recombination centers (Ag nanoparticles or ITO nanoparticles) embedded in the CT thin film. In addition, the contact situation at the MoOx/HTL interface can be evaluated by using the AFM images in combination with the transmittance spectra and water-droplet contact angle images.

Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated highly efficient bifacial perovskite solar cells and modules with a stable ITO/MoOx/CT trilayer anode electrode. The use of a 15 nm thick MoOx interlayer can effectively resist the excessive energy bombardment during the deposition of the sputtered ITO thin film, which originates from the smooth contact at the MoOx/CT interface. The ITO/MoOx/CT based perovskite solar modules exhibited a stable photovoltaic performance under a wet environment, which indicates that the hydrophobic ITO/MoOx/CT trilayer can effectively minimize the moisture and oxygen induced degradation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin film.
