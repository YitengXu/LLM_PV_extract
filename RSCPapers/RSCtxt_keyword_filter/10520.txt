    , Accepted 30th May 2017First published on 31st May 2017AbstractIn this study, we investigated the photovoltaic properties of newly synthesized low bandgap conjugated polymers, poly(4-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-8-(5-(2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)) (P1) and poly(4-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-8-(5-(2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)-4-yl)selenophen-2-yl)-2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)) (P2). P1 is a thiophene-based conjugated polymer (TCP), and P2 is a selenophene-based conjugated polymer (SCP). These two different conjugated low bandgap polymers were characterized by NMR and gel permeation chromatography. The physical properties of the polymers were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and conductivity. Moreover, we also investigated the optical, electrochemical and morphological properties of both polymers by UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Later, we studied the photovoltaic properties of both low bandgap polymers blended with PC61BM in different ratios with different thicknesses. In addition, post thermal annealing at different temperatures for both polymers was investigated, and the results show that P2 (SCP) exhibited stronger molecular orientation properties as compared to P1 (TCP).
Introduction
Organic polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated polymers show promising potential to act as clean energy sources. PSCs are a very good source of renewable energy, owing to their fabrication methodology that decreases the cost of preparation.1–3 In addition to this, they have a high degree of mechanical flexibility, which is advantageous for foldable and rollable substrates.4,5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been much improved in recent years by the development of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices. BHJ devices consist of an acceptor (n-type) (fullerene derivative or other acceptor material) blended with a low bandgap conjugated polymer as the donor (p-type) and have been developed for most efficient PSCs.6–9 To increase the efficiency of BHJ devices, n- and p-type materials play an important role. To harvest a broader spectrum of solar radiation for solar cells, low bandgap polymers play a significant role. Low bandgap polymers based on conjugated polymers decrease the bandgap due to the inclusion of alternating donor and acceptor units, helping in intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).9–17 Therefore, many conjugated polymers have been developed to date to increase the efficiency of PSCs.12,13
Conjugated polymers with thiophene as the donor moiety have been mostly used to study photovoltaic properties.18,19 However, other polymers based on chalogenophene show strong potential for optoelectronic applications.13 The physical properties of the conjugated polymer based on selenophene (CPS) indicate that CPS has numerous advantages over the conjugated polymer based on thiophene (CPT), such as having a narrower optical bandgap than CPT and also showing stronger intermolecular interactions than CPT.20–25 Consequently, it is predictable from the above mentioned properties that CPS exhibits higher crystallinity and broader photon absorption than CPT. Hence, CPS shows more promising potential as a conjugated polymer for photovoltaic applications than CPT. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to compare the photovoltaic abilities of conjugated polymers based on selenophene and thiophene moieties. Towards this goal, two conjugated polymers based on selenophene and thiophene were synthesized and characterized by NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The physical properties of the polymers were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and conductivity. Moreover, we also investigated the optical, electrochemical and morphological properties of both polymers by UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Later, the photovoltaic properties of both low bandgap polymers blended with PC61BM in different ratios of different thicknesses with or without thermal annealing were also investigated.
Experimental
General
All the reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources such as Sigma-Aldrich and TCI. The chemicals were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. All the solvents were freshly distilled prior to use. Anhydrous THF was obtained by distillation from sodium/benzophenone prior to use. (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (1), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (2), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene (3), and 4,8-dibromo-2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole) (4) were synthesized by reported methods,26–29 as shown in Fig. 1.

For the synthesis of P1, a mixture of 1 (500 mg, 0.553 mmol), 4 (226 mg, 0.553 mmol), 3 (760 mg, 1.105 mmol), tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) (13 mg, 0.044 mmol), and tris(dibenzylidene acetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) (10 mg, 0.011 mmol) in anhydrous chlorobenzene (20 mL) was charged in a 100 mL round bottom flask. Then the reaction mixture was heated at 150 °C for 3 days. Later, compound 3 (34 mg, 0.083 mmol) was added and stirred at 150 °C for 1 h. To that reaction mixture, 4-bromobenzotrifluoride (25 mg, 0.111 mmol) was added and heated under stirring at 150 °C for 1 h for end-capping. Next, the mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL), and the precipitate was collected in a Soxhelt thimble filter. The precipitate was then extracted with methanol, ethanol, acetone, n-hexane, and THF. The THF solution was concentrated before precipitating in methanol.

Device fabrication and characterization
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a layered structure of the ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag configuration. The ITO coated glass substrate was cleaned by stepwise sonication in acetone and isopropanol for 30 min each. After complete drying, the ITO coated glass substrate was treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. ZnO sol was synthesized according to previous work,30 spin-casted at 4000 rpm onto ITO glass and annealed at 200 °C for 10 min in an ambient atmosphere. After that, the polymer (P1 or P2) blended with PC61BM was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) at different ratios. The resulting solution was spin-coated on the top of the ZnO layer with or without heating at different rpm (600 to 1500) for 30 s. MoO3 (10 nm thickness) was thermally evaporated under vacuum (5.4 × 10−8 Torr) on the top of the active layer before Ag. The Ag layer of 100 nm was thermally deposited on the MoO3 layer. The photovoltaic performance was measured inside the glove box. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the device was obtained using a computer-controlled Keithley 4200 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by an Oriel solar simulator (Oriel 91160A). The measurements were repeated three times to eliminate experimental error.
Measurements
All the reactions were carried out under nitrogen using solvents and reagents as commercially supplied unless otherwise stated. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a JEOL Co. (400 MHz) spectrometer, using the residual solvent resonance of CDCl3, and the values are given in ppm. Polystyrene standards in tetrahydrofuran solution were utilized for GPC. A UV-vis S-3100 spectrophotometer with wavelength resolution, wavelength accuracy, and wavelength reproducibility of 0.95 nm, ±0.5 nm, and ±0.02 nm, respectively, and a Bomem MB Series MB100 FTIR spectrometer were used. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a CHI650D electrochemical workstation in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6)/acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 with a Pt disk, a Pt plate, and a Fc/Fc+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TGA-50 thermogravimetric analyzer (Shimadzu Co.). TA/TGA was recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. A typical TGA sample was 5–10 mg taken in an aluminum pan.
Results and discussion
Synthesis, characterization and physical properties
The monomers required for the polymers [(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene, and 4,8-dibromo-2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)] were synthesized as per reported methods.26–29 To synthesize the poly(4-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-8-(5-(2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)) [P1] polymer via the Stille coupling polycondensation, the monomers [(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane)], 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene and 4,8-dibromo-2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole) were added in anhydrous chlorobenzene in the presence of tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) and tris(dibenzylidene acetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) for the desired product. A similar method was used for the synthesis of the poly(4-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-8-(5-(2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)-4-yl)selenophen-2-yl)-2,6-didodecylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis(thiazole)) [P2] polymer by replacing 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene, as shown in Fig. 1. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P1 and P2 were 15710 and 26220, with polydispersity indexes (PDI) Đ of 1.24 and 1.28, respectively, as determined by GPC. TGA analysis indicated a mass loss of ∼37% up to 500 °C for both polymers (P1 and P2). However, no significant mass loss was observed up to 400 °C for both polymers. Fig. 2a and b show that the mass loss for polymer P1 was 37.290%, whereas for polymer P2, the mass loss was 37.454%, indicating that both polymers are very stable up to 400 °C and did not show any significant mass loss. In addition to this, the conductivity of both polymers with I2 doping was investigated, as listed in Table 1. The conductivities of polymer P1 (thiophene moiety) and P2 (selenophene moiety) were 0.368 and 0.315 S cm−1, respectively, at room temperature. Here, the difference in the conductivity was also very small between both polymers. Hence, the conductivity and mass loss do not depend on the thiophene and selenophene moieties, or in other words, both conjugated polymers consisting of thiophene and selenophene moieties did not have any significant effect on the conductivity and thermal stability. The optical, electrochemical and morphological properties of both polymers (P1 and P2) were also investigated.

Optical, electrochemical and morphological properties
To understand the optical parameters of both polymers (P1 and P2), UV-vis spectra were recorded, as shown in Fig. 2c, indicating that the absorption maxima (λmax) of both polymers are the same at 320 nm, but the absorption onsets (λonset) of both polymers are different. The λonset of P1 and P2 was 583 and 642 nm, respectively. Therefore, the optical bandgap is 2.1 and 1.9 eV for P1 and P2, respectively. Fig. 2c shows that the P2 polymer was red shifted with increasing intensity as compared to the P1 polymer, indicating that the P2 polymer has a greater ability to harvest the available photons from solar energy. The study of the UV-vis spectra also reflects that the change in the substitution of sulfur in thiophene with selenium is an effective method to extend the absorption range to longer wavelengths, and this study also supported previous work.13
Later, we investigated the electrochemical properties of both polymers by CV, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Table 1. CV shows that the HOMO for polymers P1 and P2 was −4.7 and −4.8 eV, respectively, and the LUMO for P1 and P2 was −3.3 and −3.4 eV, respectively. Therefore, the bandgap for P1 and P2 was 1.44 and 1.34 eV, respectively. This reveals that the selenophene-based conjugated polymer P2 has a lower bandgap as compared to the thiophene-based conjugated polymer P1, because the selenophene-based polymer backbone is more planar than the thiophene-based polymer.13 Therefore, polymer P2 shows better efficiency for PSCs than polymer P1. For better understanding, the roles of both conjugated polymers P1 and P2 and their photovoltaic properties were investigated. Later, the AFM results revealed that the average roughness for the P1 and P2 polymers was 2.3 nm and 2.1 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. This shows that the average roughness was not significantly different between both polymers.

Photovoltaic properties
The CV results of both polymers (P1 and P2) showed deep HOMO and LUMO energy levels that can achieve the high open circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs. The devices containing ITO/ZnO/P1:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag were tested at different ratios of P1:PC61BM and also at different spin coating speeds, as shown in Table S1 and Fig. S4 (ESI†), indicating that the active layer (P1:PC61BM) blended in a ratio of 1:1 is coated at room temperature at different spin speeds such as 600 rpm and 1000 rpm with a polymer cell efficiency (PCE) of 0.71% and 0.61%, respectively. At the blended ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 at 600 rpm spin speed, the PCEs were 0.37% and 0.77%, respectively. However, with the same blended ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 at 1000 rpm spin speed, the PCEs were 0.44% and 0.91%, respectively. Hence, the 1:3 blended ratio of P1:PC61BM with a spin speed of 1000 rpm exhibited a higher PCE than at other blended ratios (Table S1 and Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, the pre-annealing conditions were investigated at a higher solution temperature (80 °C); therefore, the PCEs of P1:PC61BM at different blended ratios and solution temperatures (RT and 80 °C) at 600 rpm spin speed were compared, as listed in Table 2 and Fig. 4a. Table 2 shows the change in PCEs with a change in temperature. The increase in PCEs at 80 °C as compared to those at room temperature was observed for all the blended ratios of P1:PC61BM, because the hot solution coatings enhanced the material’s solubility so that donor aggregation decreased in the active layer, which can cause charge trapping and/or recombination. The suppressed charge trapping and recombination resulted in increasing Jsc, FF, and Voc, thereby increasing the PCE. We also checked post thermal annealing at different temperatures (60, 85, and 100 °C) for the 1:3 blended ratio, as shown in Fig. 4b and Table 3. We observed that the thermal annealing of a fixed donor:acceptor ratio decreased the Jsc, FF, and Voc values, thus decreasing the PCE. Moreover, as the temperature increases, the PCE of PSCs decreases more at a constant blending ratio and constant spin speed of coating.

Later, the PSC device (ITO/ZnO/P2:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag) using polymer P2 at different blending ratios of P2:PC61BM and different coating spin speeds, as shown in Table S2 and Fig. S4 (ESI†), indicated that the active layer (P2:PC61BM) blended in ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 coated at room temperature with different spin speeds such as 700, 1000, 1500, and 2000 rpm gave quite a big variation in the PCE. At the blended ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 at 700 rpm spin speed, the PCEs were 0.38%, 0.28%, and 0.79%, respectively. However, at the same blended ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 at 1000 rpm spin speed, the PCEs were 0.30%, 0.43%, and 1.00%, respectively. At a spin speed of 1500 rpm with the blended ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, P2:PC61BM had PCEs of 0.40%, 0.46%, and 1.07%, respectively. Similarly, at 2000 rpm speed, the PCEs were 0.45%, 0.70%, and 1.12% for the 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 blended ratios, respectively. We also studied the pre-annealing at 80 °C and 700 rpm for all the blended ratios, but no significant difference in the PCE was observed as compared to the RT studies (data not shown). In addition, post thermal annealing was performed at a 1:3 blending ratio at 60, 80, and 100 °C for 5 min, indicating that the PCEs were 0.95%, 0.78%, and 0.68%, respectively, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 5a. This shows that the decrease in the Jsc, FF, and Voc values after thermal annealing for 5 min at different temperatures decreased the PCE. However, when we compared post thermal annealing at 85 °C with different blended ratios such as 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 at 1500 rpm spin speed, we observed that only for the blended ratio 1:1, the FF and Jsc values enhanced the PCE, as shown in Fig. 5b. Moreover, to understand the action of the changed PCE values at 85 °C, the absorption of the blended films, as displayed in Fig. 6, shows that the λmax of the donor shifted to 565 nm from 550 nm, and a strong peak at 610 nm appeared for the blended 1:1 film, but not for other blended films. Fig. 6b shows the visual display before and after heating at 85 °C.

Conclusions
This study shows that the selenophene-based conjugated polymer shows a higher PCE than the thiophene-based conjugated polymer. In addition, the PCE strongly depends on the blended ratios of donor:acceptor, spin speed, and the temperature of the coating solution, whereas in some cases, post thermal annealing can increase the PCE because of enhanced donor ability. The post thermal annealing results revealed the strong molecular orientation properties of the selenophene-based conjugated polymer as compared to the thiophene-based conjugated polymer.
