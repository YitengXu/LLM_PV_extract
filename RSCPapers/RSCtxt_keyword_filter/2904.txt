    , Accepted 30th April 2021First published on 30th April 2021AbstractDespite the toxicity of cadmium, CdS has been used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in highly efficient Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells for a long time. In this work, a bilayer structure ETL, denoted as Zn(O,S)/CdS, has been prepared as a substitute for pure CdS in S-rich Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. This achieves two important goals related to the current use of CdS-based Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaics, namely, due to high transmittance and a significant reduction of CdS usage, an increase of the short circuit current density in the short-wavelength range (by about 1.5 mA cm−2) and a decrease of the usage of CdS (by about 75%). Interestingly, the fabricated FTO/Zn(O,S)/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/Spiro/Au device achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency of 9.62% and shows high stability without the light-soaking (LS) effect and hysteresis. To date, this conversion efficiency value represents the highest efficiency of all Sb-based solar cells with Cd-free or reduced-Cd ETLs based on either substrate or superstrate device configurations.
1. Introduction
As emerging thin-film photovoltaic materials, antimony chalcogenides (Sb2(SxSe1−x)3, 0 < x < 1) are considered as promising candidates for chalcogenide-based solar cells due to their excellent features including a suitable bandgap (1.1–1.7 eV), high absorption coefficient, nontoxicity, earth-abundance, and simple preparation process.1–5 It is impressive that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell have reached over 10% within only six years' research.6 The evolution of its development is similar to that of kesterite Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells and falls into three branches,1 pure Sb2S3 (PCEmax = 7.5%),7 pure Sb2Se3 (PCEmax = 9.2%),8 and mixed-anion Sb2(S,Se)3 alloys (PCEmax = 10.5%).9 Likewise, whereas various approaches are introduced to fabricate these active absorption layers, the close-space-sublimation (CSS)8 method and the hydrothermal3,6 method stand out. Interestingly, in the typical structure of high-efficiency (over 9%) Sb-based solar cells,6,8,9 a pure CdS thin film, which is not compatible with the green environmental demands today, has, unfortunately, often been selected as the electron transport layer (ETL) or buffer layer for a long time, and seemingly is irreplaceable by other materials. Moreover, the CdS layer has a relatively small bandgap of about 2.4 eV and absorbs light with a wavelength shorter than 520 nm, limiting the short circuit current density (JSC) of a solar cell.10 Thus, searching for an appropriate material and deposition method to replace CdS or to drastically reduce the usage of cadmium remains crucial for the future development of Sb2(S,Se)3 technology.
As a newcomer in thin-film solar cells, the progress of Sb-based photovoltaic technology still requires more effort. Luckily, the experience of previous researchers working on other thin film solar cells has given information that merits attention. One method to circumvent the problems faced by use of a CdS layer is to replace it partly or completely by non-toxic, wide bandgap semiconductor materials, such as Zn(O,S) thin films,10,11 which possess advantages of a large and tunable bandgap (2.6–3.8 eV), high transparency, low toxicity, and an earth-abundant source of the elements. For example, to avoid the toxic CdS buffer layer in Cu(In,Ga) (CIGS) thin-film solar cells, active research on replacing it by Zn(O,S) has been made.10,11 Strikingly, based on the Zn(O,S) buffer layer, a record conversion efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGSSe) thin-film solar cells has currently reached 23.35%,11 which is a great inspiration to all researchers in this field. Analogously, in the past six years, many attempts have been made for the Sb-based solar devices to partly or completely replace CdS ETL. All the relevant research substituting CdS with various materials for use in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). In these attempts, the first type is a single ETL structure that uses TiO2,12 SnO2,13 Al2O3,14 In2S3,15 ZnO,16 or CdxZn1−xS17 as alternative ETLs. The second category is a bilayer ETL structure such as ZnO/ZnMgO,18 TiO2/CdS,19 CdS/SnO2 or SnO2/CdS,3 and ZnO/CdS.20 Unfortunately, in all these attempts, the device conversion efficiency remains less than 8%.
In this work, the CdS was replaced with a bilayer Zn(O,S)/CdS for use in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, and this addressed the environmental concerns and the photocurrent loss resulting from short wavelength light absorption by reducing the usage of CdS. The Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL is produced by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a bilayer Zn(O,S) (∼30 nm)21/CdS followed by a CdCl2 post-deposition treatment (PDT). Except where otherwise stated, all the tests of the ETLs were carried out after the CdCl2 PDT in this work. The thickness of the CdS was optimized by adjusting the deposition time and the optimal time is only 4 min, which is a quarter of the deposition time for a pure CdS ETL.6 In other words, about 75% of the CdS of a pure CdS ETL are not required. Being harmless, stable, and easy to fabricate, Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL forms proper band alignment with Sb2(S,Se)3 and further shows a higher optical transmittance than pure CdS, allowing more photons to propagate in the active absorber layer, and therefore it is a highly preferable candidate as an alternative ETL for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. Moreover, it can also promote the quality of the absorber layer during the subsequently growing process. Impressively, compared to the CdS-based devices, the as-produced FTO/Zn(O,S)/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (FTO: fluorine-doped tin oxide) solar cell device has achieved a high PCE of 9.62% with an increase of short circuit current density of about 1.5 mA cm−2 and a negligible open circuit voltage loss. Moreover, it shows a high stability in ambient air with no LS effect and no I–V hysteresis. The results reported here further strengthen the great potential of Sb-based devices as emergent photovoltaics.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Preparation of CdS, Zn(O,S)/CdS, and Zn(O,S) ETLs
The CdS layer, was deposited by the CBD method directly onto chemically cleaned FTO/glass substrates. The detailed parameters are given in Table S2 (ESI†). The deposition process was carried out at 65 °C for 0–18 min in a solution of 200 ml of deionized water, 0.3 mmol of CdSO4, 16 mmol of CH4N2S, and 0.38 mol of NH3·H2O. For the Zn(O,S) layer, as shown in Table S3 and Fig. S1 (ESI),† it was deposited by the CBD method onto chemically cleaned FTO/glass substrates at 85 °C for 15 min to form a layer of ∼30 nm thick. In this process, a solution of 200 ml of deionized water, 2.5 mmol of ZnSO4, 1.3 mmol of C6H5Na3O7·2H2O, 1.5 mmol of C2H5NS, and 0.27 mmol of NH3·H2O was used. For the Zn(O,S)/CdS layer, a series of CdS layers with different thickness controlled by deposition time were deposited on the previously deposited 15 min Zn(O,S) layer (CBD method). All the parameters of the CdS deposition were the same as described previously except for the deposition time. After the CBD deposition of the previous layers of the precursors, CdS, Zn(O,S), or Zn(O,S)/CdS, a PDT was carried out by spin-coating 20 mg ml−1 CdCl2·2.5H2O methanol solution followed by annealing at 300–425 °C for 15 min in the open air. As a critically important step, the CdCl2-PDT process could improve not only the grain size and film quality of Sb2(S,Se)3, but also the heterojunction quality and has a significant effect on the device performance. Note that all tests in this work were carried out on films treated by the CdCl2 PDT process.
2.2. Preparation of Sb2(S,Se)3 on ETLs and completed solar cell devices
The Sb2(S,Se)3 films were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In this process, KSbC4H4O7·0.5H2O, Na2S2O3·5H2O and CH4N2Se were used as a source for Sb, S and Se, respectively. The KSbC4H4O7·0.5H2O (4 mmol) and Na2S2O3·5H2O (16 mmol) were first mixed and then stirred in 200 ml of deionized water and then 0.8 mmol of CH4N2Se was added with continuous stirring until the solution became clear. This solution was then poured into an autoclave with a Teflon tank that contained either CdS, or Zn(O,S)/CdS, or Zn(O,S) coated FTO substrates. The autoclave was subsequently placed in a dry cabinet and heated at 140 °C for 90–170 min to allow the growth of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films. The as-grown Sb2(S,Se)3 films were further annealed at 300–375 °C for 10–15 min in a nitrogen atmosphere to improve their quality. Finally, the typical structure of a Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell device, glass/FTO/ETLs/Sb2(S,Se)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 1b, was completed by spin-coating a spiro-OMeTAD layer (HTL, hole transport layer), followed by thermal annealing, and thermal evaporation of an Au electrode. The active area of the device was 0.0735 cm2 as defined by a mask.

2.3. Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with illumination from a solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-X100R) with a source meter (Keithley Instruments, 2400). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a quantum efficiency (QE) measurement system (Enlitech, QE-R666). The surface and interface morphology of CdS, Zn(O,S)/CdS, Zn(O,S), and Sb2(S,Se)3 were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, Sirion 200). Grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) was also carried out (Rigaku, SmartLab 3 kW. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also conducted (ThermoFisher, ESCALAB 250Xi). The energy band positions of CdS, Zn(O,S)/CdS, Zn(O,S), and Sb2(S,Se)3 were determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (ThermoFisher, ESCALAB 250Xi) with a bias of −5 V. The optical properties of CdS, Zn(O,S)/CdS, and Zn(O,S) were detected using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 5000). Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (excitation wavelength at 325 nm) was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-4600).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Photovoltaic performance

Fig. 1a and b illustrate the typical structure of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells and show the substitution of Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL for a CdS ETL. Because an alternative ETL was used, the parameters which affect the device performance were carefully optimized. These included CdS thickness (see Fig. S2, ESI†), Sb2(S,Se)3 deposition time (see Fig. S3, ESI†), and the annealing temperature of the CdCl2 treatment (see Fig. S4, ESI†) and the Sb2(S,Se)3 layer (see Fig. S5, ESI†). For comparison, results from devices made with CdS ETL and Zn(O,S) ETL using the same fabrication process are included in Fig. 1c–f. The statistics of conversion efficiency for a total of more than 300 devices are shown in Fig. 1c, and it is interesting and encouraging to see that the performance of the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based devices show comparable and even better performance than that of the pure CdS ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. In addition, although the performance of Zn(O,S) ETL-based devices was quite low, the maximum efficiency had still reached more than 4%. Moreover, the performance of the best devices are shown in Fig. 1d and Table 1 exhibit a PCE of ∼9.01% for CdS ETL, ∼9.62% for Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL, and ∼4.20% for Zn(O,S) ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. A comparison of all the results from related research on Cd-free or Cd-reduced ETLs in Sb-based solar cells is summarized in Table S1,† to date, the results of this research represent the highest conversion efficiency among all the Sb-based solar cells where Cd was replaced by other elements, either in substrate or superstrate device configurations.

By a careful comparison of the parameters between the two best devices fabricated with Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL and CdS ETL, it was found that the best Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based device shows a much higher JSC and the best CdS ETL-based device possessed a slightly higher FF. Moreover, the VOC was almost the same for devices with either ETL. In the case of Zn(O,S) ETL-based devices, the critical factors limiting their performance were primarily the VOC and the FF. To demonstrate the role of the Zn(O,S) layer in the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL (as shown in Fig. S6, ESI†), devices based on a CdS layer with only 4 min deposition time were also fabricated and show a PCE of about 2%, much lower than that of the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based devices. These results revealed that the high performance of Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based devices was not a result of the 4 min CdS deposition alone but the combined Zn(O,S)/CdS layers.
To further explore the differences of the three types of ETLs, EQE measurements were made and the results are displayed in Fig. 1e. As expected, there was an obvious increase of QE at wavelengths below 500 nm when Zn(O,S) was introduced as part of the ETL due to its smaller absorption than that of CdS. Despite the integrated current density of the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based device being the highest, which was in good agreement with the J–V curves, there was a notable reduction of short circuit current density in the range from 500 to 800 nm. For the Zn(O,S) ETL-based device, such behavior was even stronger, showing an even higher EQE value in the short-wavelength range but a much lower EQE value in the long-wavelength range, and this eventually lead to the lowest integrated current density of the three devices. The previous results implied that the quality of Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL was critically associated with the quantity of both Zn(O,S) and CdS in addition to their quality. To obtain high EQEs in the short wavelength range, it is preferable to have more Zn(O,S), and to obtain high EQEs in the long wavelength range, more CdS is beneficial. The reduction of EQE in the long wavelength range cannot be from the absorption of Zn(O,S) and therefore must come from the interface effect or ETL layer quality where carrier recombination plays the dominant role.

Fig. 1f shows the evolution of EQE spectra of devices with different quantities or thickness of CdS in the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETLs. The corresponding efficiency (%) and JSC (mA cm−2) of these devices are plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Firstly, it can be seen from the performance results, that as the deposition time of CdS increased from 2 min to 18 min, the device performance improved at first and then gradually deteriorated. The sample with Zn(O,S)-15 min/CdS-4 min shows the highest short circuit current density as well as the best conversion efficiency. Secondly, as the deposition time of CdS increased from 2 min to 18 min, the EQE results displayed a progressive decrease of spectral response in the wavelength range of 300 to 500 nm and a non-monotonic behavior in the wavelength range of 500 to 800 nm, with the EQE value increasing first and decreasing later. Consequently, as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), the JSC increased first and decreased later after the CdS layer reached an optimal thickness (or deposition time). This dependence was a result of competition between the optical transmittance of these ETLs and the quality of the ETL/absorber junction, which is discussed in the following sections.
3.2 Electrical characteristics
To gain further insight into the charge transport and recombination process, as shown in Fig. 2a–c and S7 (ESI†), the dark J–V behaviors and light intensity (I) dependence of VOC and JSC were investigated. Generally, the J0 (dark saturation current density) can be determined by the intercept at zero voltage of the linear regression from the semi-logarithmic J–V plot in the region close to the diode turn-on voltage. Moreover, the bandgap dependence of J0 can be described as J0 ∝ exp(−Eg/nkT), where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature, which showed that J0 depended on Eg and n. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), for a Zn(O,S)/CdS-based device, J0 and n were estimated to be 4.84 × 10−6 mA cm−2 and 1.77, respectively. Similarly, the J0 and n of the CdS-based device were 2.07 × 10−6 mA cm−2 and 1.74, the J0 and n of the Zn(O,S)-based device were 7.42 × 10−3 mA cm−2 and 3.13, respectively. Such high J0 and n values of the Zn(O,S)-based device indicated a high leakage current density and a strong carrier recombination outside the depletion region, which limited the VOC, FF, and therefore PCE of the Zn(O,S)-based device. To further evaluate the charge extraction/recombination processes in these solar cells, light-intensity-dependent J–V measurements were performed and the resulting plots are shown in Fig. 2b and c. The VOC increased linearly with the logarithm of light intensity, which indicated that trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination played the dominant role in these devices.9,22 The values of the ideality factor were almost equal for Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL (1.321) and CdS ETL (1.381)-based devices, but significantly larger for the Zn(O,S) ETL-based device, implying that there was a higher recombination loss for the latter device. The lowest VOC and FF for Zn(O,S) ETL when compared with the other two types of ETLs, shown in Fig. 1d and Table 1, were also consistent with the conclusion of its increased recombination loss. In addition, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity I followed a power-law behavior: (JSC ∝ Iα).23 Due to space charge effects, the α value was less than 1.24 In this work, all three ETL-based devices showed reasonable α values that were similar to those found in other reports.9,25 The highest α value of the three devices tested, was obtained for the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based device which suggested it had the least charge recombination and best charge collection. Finally, to evaluate and validate the reliability of the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, their electrical characteristics were measured and the scan direction-dependent J–V curves (Fig. 2d–f) and LS effect (Fig. S8, ESI†) of the CdS ETL, Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL, and Zn(O,S) ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 devices were obtained. All of these devices were produced without any encapsulation and stored in an ambient environment. Firstly, the J–V curves of the Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells based on CdS and Zn(O,S)/CdS ETLs measured under forward and reverse voltage scans exhibited a negligible degree of hysteresis, indicating that the Zn(O,S)/CdS thin film was a very good candidate as an ETLs for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. In contrast, obvious hysteresis was found for the Zn(O,S) ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell, which might be attributed to inefficient charge transport through the Zn(O,S) ETLs because of a high energy barrier originating from a relatively high conduction band offset (CBO) between pure ZnS and Sb2(S,Se)3, which was similar to what happened between ZnS and CIGS in CIGS solar cells.26,27 In the Zn(O,S)-based CIGS solar cells, there was often an LS effect which showed an obvious improvement of device performance, especially the FF (%) as shown in Fig. S8d (ESI†), as the exposure time increased at the beginning stage of the illumination.21 Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. S8a–c (ESI†), none of the Sb2(S,Se)3 devices showed a much more obvious LS effect after 30 min of light exposure, suggesting that the CdCl2 treatment process may have modified the deep level defects and the trapping of photo-generated carriers to saturate the defect states became unnecessary.

(d–f) The scan-direction-dependence of the J–V curves of solar cell devices with different ETLs. (g) The stabilities of representative CdS, Zn(O,S)/CdS, and Zn(O,S) ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 devices without any encapsulation. 
The stability of a solar cell is also an important issue for applications. Even stored only in a dry cabinet at 20% relative humidity without encapsulation, as shown in Fig. 2g, after about 600 h of storage at room temperature, the performance of both the Zn(O,S)/CdS and CdS-based solar cells deteriorates, with remnant PCEs of 96.4% and 90.6% observed for Zn(O,S)/CdS and CdS-based devices, respectively. Interestingly, and surprisingly, the stability of the Zn(O,S)/CdS-based device was better than that of the CdS-based device. Unexpectedly, the Zn(O,S)-based device takes a long time to stabilize. Such an abnormity may be induced by the improper matching of the band structures between pure ZnS and Sb2(S,Se)3, at which a high energy barrier originating from a relatively high CBO might exist. Such a high CBO caused not only an unusual stability but also the obvious hysteresis mentioned previously for the Zn(O,S) ETL-based devices. It is anticipated that the good stability of Zn(O,S)/CdS-based Sb2(S,Se)3 devices in ambient air is advantageous for its commercialization in the future.
3.3 Analysis of basic physical properties
To understand the mechanism of device performance evolution better, the structural and optical properties of these ETLs and their corresponding absorber layers were studied. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to take images of the surface morphologies of these ETLs. Interestingly, these ETLs revealed quite different surface morphologies from each other. Whereas the CdS ETL consisted of many crystalline particles of different sizes, the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL showed a relatively smooth surface with uniform spherical particles, and the particles in the Zn(O,S) ETL were the smallest of the three ETLs. Because the morphology and the surface chemistry of a film would influence and even dictate the subsequent grown layers, the surface (Fig. 3d–f) and the cross-sectional (Fig. S9, ESI†) morphologies of the Sb2(S,Se)3 layers deposited on the ETLs also demonstrated some differences. The grain size of Sb2(S,Se)3 on Zn(O,S) ETL was the smallest, whereas grain size on Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL was the largest. Further, as shown in Fig. 3e, the grain size of Sb2(S,Se)3 on Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL had a tendency to aggregate and grow, which was a positive property for planar thin-film solar cells with a good performance.9 Despite the difference in surface morphologies, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the Sb2(S,Se)3 thicknesses of all the samples were about the same, ∼300 nm, which indicated that the growth dynamics were independent of the ETL properties.

In Fig. 4a, d–i and S10 (ESI†), the GIXRD spectra of different ETLs and their corresponding Sb2(S,Se)3 layers are shown. Here the grazing angle used for ETLs is 0.5° and for the Sb2(S,Se)3 layers it is 1°, corresponding to a penetration depth of about 100 nm for ETLs and about 200–300 nm for Sb2(S,Se)3 layers. Upon examination, all the ETLs showed different features as was expected. After the CdCl2 post-treatment, Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL and Zn(O,S) ETL showed a preferred orientation of a (002) CdS peak but no ZnS peaks, whereas CdS ETL exhibited a hexagonal crystalline structure that corresponded to standard PDF# 41-1049. Moreover, after depositing the Sb2(S,Se)3 layer, as displayed in Fig. S10 (ESI†), by comparing the positions of peak (020) and (120) with the standard PDF cards, it was concluded that the absorber layer deposited on these ETLs was a S-rich phase. The observed negligible peak shift of the Sb2(S,Se)3 layers suggested that their compositions were independent of their ETL properties. However, as shown in in Fig. S10 (ESI†) and 4e–j there was a correlation between the peak characteristics and the type of ETL. Firstly, due to the interaction of the S–Se, the Sb2Se3 (120) (denoted by Se (120)) and Sb2S3 (120) (denoted by S (120)) satellite peaks were carefully analyzed. Comparing the three types of ETL, the Sb2(S,Se)3 on the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL showed the highest peak intensity as well as the smallest full width at half maximum (FWHM) both for Se(120) and S(120), which indicated that the corresponding absorber layer had the best crystallinity. This was in good agreement with the SEM images and was possibly due to the slightly higher optimal annealing temperature used (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Secondly, the peaks (101/130/310) located from 23° to 26° also showed different features. The Sb2(S,Se)3 on the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL showed the highest proportion of the (101) peak in this range, which may be induced by the preferred (002) orientation of the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL (see Fig. 4a) and this was beneficial to the carrier transport as well as the final solar devices.

The transmittance of the ETL is another important factor in the superstrate device configuration. In Fig. 4b and S11 (ESI†), the transmittance spectra of the CdS, Zn(O,S)/CdS, and Zn(O,S) ETLs deposited on an FTO substrate and pure Zn(O,S) and CdS layers without CdCl2-PDT are displayed and compared. In the entire wavelength range of interest, the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL exhibited comparable transmittance with the Zn(O,S) ETL, and was much higher than that of CdS ETL, a result consistent with the observation of EQE as well as the short circuit current density. With closer inspection, two absorption edges were found to exist, located at around 380 nm and 520 nm for the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL, which suggested the coexistence of the Zn(O,S) and CdS phases. Further information was also obtained from the PL spectra shown in Fig. 4c. Two obvious PL peaks located at 380 nm and 520 nm again revealed that the structure of Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL was a mixed phase rather than single-phase like Zn1−xCdxS (0 < x < 1). In addition, there was a small peak at 468 nm in the PL spectra for all the samples due to oxidization28 that came from the same post-treatment processes by CdCl2 at high temperatures in air. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the Zn and Cd elements were detected directly by XPS at a few nanometers' depth close to the surface (within the penetration length), which implied an intermixing of Cd and Zn that contributed to the complexity of the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL surface. At this point, it was concluded that the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL was a bilayer structure with a complex surface composition that may contain Zn(O,S), CdS, Zn1−xCdxS (0 < x < 1), and oxides.
As discussed previously and illustrated in Fig. 5a, the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL introduced in this work is a complex mixture. Thus, it was necessary to determine the device parameters from the energy level perspective. The band edge positions of Sb2(S,Se)3 and various ETLs were measured by UPS, and detailed results are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Due to the existence of oxides of the Zn, and Cd elements, the calculated valence band edges of Zn(O,S)/CdS and Zn(O,S) ETLs were much lower than that of CdS ETL and reached 7.30 eV. As a result, the conduction band edge was at 3.83 eV for CdS ETL, 3.94 eV for Zn(O,S) ETL, and 3.86 eV for Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL, respectively. The similar conduction band edge position contributed to the comparable performance between Zn(O,S)/CdS ETLs and CdS ETLs-based solar cells. Nevertheless, there should also be other reasons for the low FF in the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, for example, the high energy barrier comes from a relatively high CBO between the ZnS phase and the Sb2(S,Se)3.

4. Conclusions
In summary, it has been demonstrated that Zn(O,S)/CdS thin film can serve as an alternative ETL for S-rich Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. Compared to a CdS ETL, the use of the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL meant that two important issues relating to current Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaics could be addressed, including an improvement of the short circuit current density in the short wavelength region and the reduction of Cd usage. To a certain degree, the Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL can also promote the quality of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films. Encouragingly, the most efficient Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based device that was fabricated has a PCE of 9.62% measured under AM 1.5G standard conditions. With a number of additional desirable features, such as long-term stability, no LS effect, and no hysteresis, the highly efficient Zn(O,S)/CdS ETL-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar devices are advantageous for future industrialization and applications.
