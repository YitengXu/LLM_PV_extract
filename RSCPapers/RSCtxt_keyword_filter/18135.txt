    , Accepted 21st September 2020First published on 24th September 2020AbstractDonor–acceptor–π–acceptor (D–A–π–A) organic dyes are promising candidates for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and photocatalytic H2 evolution due to their high range of visible-light response and strong light-capturing capabilities. However, the low charge transfer rate and severe charge recombination at the interface still limit their photovoltaic performance and photocatalytic activities. In this work, three indeno[1,2-b]thiophene-based sensitizers (SD1, SD2 and SD3) with a 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (QT) auxiliary acceptor and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT)-benzene/thiophene/furan different π-bridge moieties have been synthesized and applied in DSCs and photocatalytic H2 production to investigate the effect of the π-bridge moiety on the photovoltaic performance and photocatalytic activities. Optical/electrochemical data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations clearly showed that the introduction of a benzene π-bridge in SD1 resulted in a large torsional angle between CPDT and benzene, and then inhibited dye aggregation and charge recombination. Therefore SD1-based DSCs exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.96% under one sun illumination. In addition, among the three sensitizers, the SD2 containing thiophene π-bridge unit exhibited the best hydrophilicity and planarity with a torsional angle <1°, which greatly improved the charge transfer process at the solution/dye/TiO2 interface and dye regeneration. Thus, a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 23.5 mmol g−1 h−1 was obtained over the SD2@Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst.
Introduction
In the development of clean solar energy to tackle the increasing worldwide energy demand and the global climate change, clean electricity generation by using solar cells and photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production from water splitting are regarded as two promising strategies for efficient and cost effective technologies to utilize solar energy.1–3 Among the various semiconductor materials reported in these areas, titanium dioxide (TiO2) emerged as one of the most promising photoanodes and photocatalytic materials owing to its cost-saving nature, nontoxicity, efficient charge transport and chemical and thermal stability.4,5 However, TiO2 is a white crystalline solid which can only be excited by UV light due to its wide band gap energy (Eg = ∼3.2 eV). This inherent lack of visible light absorption of TiO2 restricts complete utilization of the entire solar spectrum, leading to a low energy conversion efficiency.6–8
Dye-sensitization of TiO2 is a typical and effective method to overcome this drawback through extending light harvesting, which is common in photocatalytic H2 production and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).9–12 The sensitizer plays a vital role in light-harvesting and energy conversion. Among various sensitizers, metal-free organic dyes are under intense investigations due to the low-cost, facile structural modification, and high range of visible-light response.13,14 In particular, donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) organic dyes with effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) processes can promote photo-induced charge separation, resulting in excellent photon-to-electron conversion.15,16 For example, Kang's group reported moderately hydrophilic triphenylamine-based dyes DEO1 and DEO2 that showed gratifying H2-generation efficiencies at a low dye adsorption.17,18 Son's group reported phenothiazine-based dyes P1–P5 that sensitized TiO2 for H2 production, exhibiting a much higher activity than those of N719 and EY.19 However, D–π–A organic dyes merely respond in the long-wavelength (>600 nm) region of the solar spectrum,20,21 which restricts further improvement of the photovoltaic efficiency. A common strategy to extend the spectral response is by incorporating electron-withdrawing units as an auxiliary acceptor to harvest more photons from solar radiation.22–25 This D–A–π–A strategy can not only further accelerate the ICT process to extend the absorption response but also enhance the photoelectrochemical properties of dyes.26,27 Therefore, further optimization of the molecular structure design based on the D–A–π–A strategy can result in more efficient sensitizers.
It is well known that an indeno[1,2-b]thiophene functionalized triphenylamine (ITTPA) donor is a powerful electron donating group, which can broaden the absorption wavelength range as well as enhance charge transfer.28,29 2,3-Diphenylquinoxaline (QT) works as a stronger electron-withdrawing group due to its high electron affinity originating from two symmetric unsaturated nitrogen atoms.30–32 The introduction of QT as an auxiliary acceptor can improve the distribution of donor electrons, red-shift the absorption spectra, tune the energy levels and improve the photostability,33–35 In our previous work, a blue-colored ITTPA-based S5 bearing a QT auxiliary acceptor was used to sensitize TiO2 (S5@Pt/TiO2), which can broaden the absorption spectra to the near-infrared-light region, exhibiting an excellent H2 evolution rate of 21.5 mmol g−1 h−1.36 This result indicated that metal-free organic dyes with D–A–π–A configuration have enormous potential for photocatalytic H2 production.
In addition, the π-bridge selection can not only tune the photoelectric properties of dyes but also affect the kinetic and energetic characteristics of the solvent/dye/TiO2 interface in the process of electron regeneration and injection, thereby determining the overall energy conversion efficiency.37 Herein, in order to broaden the absorption spectrum and improve the charge transfer of S5@Pt/TiO2, we report three new ITTPA-based D–A–π–A sensitizers bearing a QT auxiliary acceptor, a cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT)-benzene/thiophene/furan π-bridge and a cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group, labelled as SD1, SD2 and SD3 (Scheme 1), to investigate the significant effect of the π-bridge moiety on the photovoltaic performance and photocatalytic H2 evolution. The results showed that the stronger light capturing ability and the higher IPCE response of benzene π-bridge-based SD1 led to a better power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.96% compared to thiophene/furan π-bridge moiety bearing SD2 and SD3 in DSCs. Thiophene π-bridge moiety bearing SD2 was more conducive to electron injection and dye regeneration at the interface between the water and the dye/TiO2, in which SD2@Pt/TiO2 exhibited a champion H2 evolution rate of 23.5 mmol g−1 h−1 in the dye-sensitized TiO2 system.

Fabrication of solar cells
The preparation of the dye-sensitized photoanodes and the fabrication of DSCs in this experiment were carried out according to a reported procedure.38 Briefly, TiO2 film photoanodes (about 8 μm of TiO2 layer) were placed in 5 mM CDCA bath in CH3CH2OH for 30 min in advance, and then placed into 0.3 mM dye bath in CH2Cl2 for 2 h. Moreover, a cobalt electrolyte (Co(bpy)32+/3+ in acetonitrile) was adopted in fabrication of the cells.
Material preparation of dye@Pt/TiO2
The preparation process of dye@Pt/TiO2 is the same as that in our previous photocatalytic work.36 Taking SD1@Pt/TiO2 as an example, 300 mg P25 powder was added into a mixture of 400 mL deionized water and methanol (3:1 by volume), and ultrasonication was performed for 20 min to ensure that no obvious particles were present in the solution. Then 1.6 mL of H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution was added dropwise to the above opalescent suspension under illumination of a 300 W xenon lamp for 4 hours, during which the Pt atoms were gradually deposited on the surface of TiO2 through photochemical reduction with methanol as a reducing agent. After centrifugation, the solids were repeatedly washed with ethanol and deionized water to remove excess ions and TiO2 loaded with 1 wt% Pt (named Pt/TiO2) was obtained. The Pt/TiO2 composite (100 mg) was then fully dispersed in 5 mL of anhydrous ethanol by ultrasonication, and uniformly mixed with 5 mL of SD1 THF solution (10−4 M). The resulting suspension was continuously stirred rapidly for 12 hours in the dark and then centrifuged. The obtained solids must be washed multiple times with deionized water to prevent the organic solvents from being wrapped in the composites. SD1@Pt/TiO2 was obtained after drying under vacuum at 55 °C for 8 h.
Characterization
In order to characterize the optical, electrochemical, and photo-electrochemical properties of the dyes, dye-sensitized photoanodes and dye@Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance absorption (DRS) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement, cyclic voltammetry (CV), photocurrent–voltage (J−V) photovoltaic measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. For detailed test conditions and instruments, see the ESI.†
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
Photocatalytic H2 evolution was tested in a gas-closed circulation system with a top-illuminated window (CEL-SPH2N). A 300 W Xe-lamp jointing with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 400 nm) was used to offer visible light irradiation. The generated H2 gas was detected with an on-line gas chromatograph (GC 2060) equipped with a TCD detector. In a typical experiment, 20 mg photocatalyst and 5 g ascorbic acid (AA) were dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water by ultrasonication, where AA is used as a sacrificial agent to consume the photo-generated holes and regenerate dye. In order to remove the dissolved gas in the reaction mixture before light irradiation, this gas-closed circulation system was vacuumed through an oil pump for 30 min. In addition, each sample was tested three times to ensure the accuracy of the experimental data.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes of SD1, SD2 and SD3 are depicted in Scheme 2. Briefly, the key intermediate 5-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-8-bromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (1) was synthesized via Stille cross-coupling of 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and (4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophen-2-yl)tributylstannane. Then, the unsubstituted bromine atom in compound 1 can be used to introduce the donor by another Stille cross-coupling with compound 2 to generate the key compound 3, which was reacted with 1 equiv. of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to form a monobromo substituent 4 for further reaction. Afterwards, unique aldehyde precursors 5a, 5b and 5c can be synthesized via Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of the monobromo substituent 4 with (4-formylphenyl)boronic acid, (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid, and (5-formylfuran-2-yl)boronic acid, respectively. Eventually, the target dyes SD1, SD2 and SD3 were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of the unique aldehyde precursors with cyanoacrylic acid.

Optical properties and DFT simulation
The UV-vis absorption spectra can intuitively manifest the characteristics and differences of the optical properties of the dyes SD1, SD2 and SD3, such as the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) and molar extinction coefficients (ε) as shown in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the dyes SD1, SD2 and SD3 have three obvious absorption bands at 330–360, 380–400 and 500–620 nm in THF solution, respectively. The absorption band at 330–360 nm was attributed to a typical aromatic π–π* transition of triphenylamine, and the weaker shoulder peak at 380–400 nm was ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the ITTPA bulky donor and the QT auxiliary acceptor.39 Meanwhile, a stronger ICT between the ITTPA bulky donor and the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group formed an absorption band at 500–620 nm. The origin of these absorption bands can also be verified by DFT calculations and time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations. Taking the 500–620 nm absorption band as an example, the electron density of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals was primarily delocalized at the ITTPA donor and the cyanoacrylic acid moieties, respectively, according to the DFT-derived molecular orbital distributions (Table 2). And the TD-DFT calculated energies showed that this absorption band mainly originated from the HOMO to the LUMO (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, an ICT absorption band can be effectively formed, which agreed qualitatively well with the experimental results. Similarly, the 330–360 and 380–400 nm absorption bands mainly originated from the HOMO−1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO+1 (Table 2 and Table S1, ESI†), respectively.

In addition, the three sensitizers showed high molar extinction coefficients of 64000 M−1 cm−1. And the absorption maxima of SD3 exhibited a slight red-shift of 8 nm and 5 nm compared with those of SD1 and SD2, which was mainly due to the diminishing electron donating strength in the order of furan > thiophene > benzene.20 Although the dye SD1 had the smallest maximum absorption wavelength of 578 nm, its absorption intensity improved significantly at 400–500 nm. This is more obvious after the dye was adsorbed on the TiO2 film (Fig. 1b), and the absorption intensity of SD1 increased by nearly 45% in the absorption trough. Such stronger absorption profiles were favorable for capturing more photons, which was an indispensable part in the efficiency formulas of DSCs or photocatalytic hydrogen evolution systems. Furthermore, all the SD dyes displayed slightly blue-shifted absorption on the TiO2 films relative to those in THF solutions mainly originating from the deprotonation of the cyanoacrylic acid group.40
Electrochemical data
The CV curves of SD1, SD2 and SD3 in THF solution (Fig. 1c) were measured to calculate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the SD dyes, which are indispensable for estimating the thermodynamic probability of electron injection and dye regeneration. The calculated energy levels, the CB of TiO2 and the cobalt electrolyte energy levels are clearly shown in Fig. 1d, and the related data are also listed in Table 1. The HOMO levels were calculated to be 0.68–0.72 V for the sensitizers, more positive than the redox potentials of 0.56 V and 0.14 V for Co(bpy)32+/3+ and ascorbic acid,41 respectively, indicating sufficient driving force for dye regeneration. The optical energy gap (E0–0) values of SD1, SD2 and SD3, calculated by the intersection wavelength (λint) of the normalized emission and absorption spectra of the dyes (Fig. S1, ESI†), were 1.89, 1.88 and 1.87 eV, respectively. The corresponding LUMO levels were estimated to be −1.17, −1.20 and −1.16 V versus NHE (ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0), respectively, more negative than the CB of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE), meaning that the excited dyes SD1, SD2 and SD3 had sufficient driving forces for injecting electrons into TiO2. As shown by the molecular orbital distributions in Table 2, the HOMOs of the three SD dyes are mainly delocalized on the triphenylamine and indeno[1,2-b]thiophene moieties and the LUMOs are mainly delocalized on the auxiliary acceptor QT, the π-bridge moieties and the anchoring group. Such a directional electronic distribution is ideal for intramolecular charge transfer and electron injection into TiO2 from the anchoring sites.42
Photovoltaic performance of DSCs with the cobalt electrolyte
The photovoltaic performances of DSCs based on SD1, SD2 and SD3 under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) are compiled in Table 3, and their corresponding J–V curves and IPCE spectra are displayed in Fig. 2. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices with the SD1, SD2 and SD3 dyes decreased in the order of SD1 (16.6 mA cm−2, 754 mV), SD3 (14.9 mA cm−2, 729 mV), and SD2 (14.5 mA cm−2, 728 mV), which indicated that the type of π-bridge had a significant effect on electron injection and electron recombination. And the effect of electron recombination will be further investigated below. The devices based on SD1 led to a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.96%, which was superior than those of the devices based on the dyes SD2 (7.25%) and SD3 (7.63%), mainly because the SD1-based devices had the optimal absorption spectrum and the highest driving force for dye regeneration. The SD2-based devices achieved the lowest PCE of 7.25% because the HOMO level of SD2 was the closest to Co(bpy)32+/3+, which may hinder dye regeneration and lead to low Jsc values.34 As a result, the devices based on SD1 with the benzene π-bridge moiety achieved the best PCE of 8.96%, which clearly reflected that the DSC characteristics can be effectively improved by adjusting the π-bridge moiety.

The differences in Jsc were examined further from the IPCE spectra of the DSCs based on SD1, SD2 and SD3 in cobalt electrolytes. All devices exhibited broad absorption from 300 nm to 800 nm, with maximum IPCE peaks of 87% for SD1, 70% for SD2 and 77% for SD3, which was consistent with the absorption spectra of the dyes on the TiO2 film. The SD1-based devices showed a higher IPCE response (IPCE >80% from 400 to 630 nm) in the visible range, which explained its high Jsc values of 16.6 mA cm−2. In addition, although the IPCE onset of the SD2-based devices was red shifted by 20–30 nm compared with those of SD1 and SD3, the SD2-based devices exhibited a rather low IPCE plateau. This result led to a low Jsc value for SD2, which was in accordance with SD2's smallest driving force of dye regeneration (Fig. 5d). Hence, it may be inferred that the benzene π-bridge moiety in the dyes is a good choice to greatly improve the light harvesting ability and the current density.
We also obtained the charge resistance (Rct), chemical capacitance (Cchem) and electron lifetimes (τ) of all the DSCs by EIS to further understand the Voc variation. It was clear that the Rct plots of SD1 were similar to those of SD2, laying above those of SD3 (Fig. 3a), indicating less charge recombination of DSCs based on SD1 and SD2.23 The Cchem was closely related to the electron quasi-Fermi level (Ef) in TiO2 and that of the devices followed the order SD1 ≈ SD3 > SD2, indicating that the adsorbed dyes negatively shifted the Ef of TiO2.43 As expected, the SD1-based DSCs have the largest Rct and Cchem, and a clearer trend of charge recombination can be seen from the electron lifetimes (τ = Rct × Cchem), as shown in Fig. 3b. At a fixed voltage bias, the τ values lie in a decreasing order of SD1 > SD2 ≈ SD3, rationalizing the Voc changes in the same trend. Considering that the only structural difference between those dyes was the π-bridge moiety, this huge distinction in the capability of preventing charge recombination may be caused by the size of the dihedral angle between the CPDT moiety and the π-bridge moiety. As shown in the DFT calculations (Fig. S2, ESI†), the CPDT and π-bridge moieties in SD1 are more severely twisted by 12.64° compared with those in SD2 (0.001°) and SD3 (5.41°), which is beneficial to inhibit dye aggregation and charge recombination, thereby increasing the Voc of SD1.44
 Fig. 3  (a) Plots of Rct, Cchem and (b) τ against the IR drop potential of SD1-, SD2-, and SD3-based DSCs extracted from the EIS measurement with the cobalt electrolyte. 
Above all, through rational adjustment of the π-bridge moiety in the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene-based dyes, the light-capturing capability, dye regeneration, and electron lifetime in DSCs have been well optimized. The devices based on SD1 with the benzene π-bridge moiety achieved an impressive PCE of 8.96%, which is much higher than those of the devices based on SD2/SD3 with the thiophene/furan π-bridge moiety, respectively. However, can this optimization strategy for the π-bridge moiety in DSCs also work in a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system? Herein, the corresponding SD1@Pt/TiO2, SD2@Pt/TiO2 and SD3@Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared to investigate the effect of this strategy on the performance in H2 production.
Optical properties of dye@Pt/TiO2
All the dye sensitized TiO2 samples prepared by the impregnation method showed similar bluish green color, which was significantly different from the gray Pt/TiO2. In order to verify that the dyes had successfully sensitized TiO2, the FTIR and DRS spectra of SD1@Pt/TiO2, SD2@Pt/TiO2 and SD3@Pt/TiO2 were recorded as shown in Fig. 4, including that of the control sample of Pt/TiO2. As shown in Fig. 4a, the strong absorption peak at around 3420 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of –OH and the sharp peaks at around 2940 cm−1 belonged to the stretching vibration of C–H in aromatic hydrocarbon and alkane.45 And the peaks at 1650 cm−1 and 1045 cm−1 were attributed to the CO stretching vibration and the triphenylamine C–N stretching vibration, respectively, indicating that the dye adsorbed on Pt/TiO2 successfully.36 Moreover, the low intensity of the characteristic peaks from the dyes was consistent with the lower dye load (around 1 wt%). And these small amounts of dye molecules were sufficient to strengthen the absorption properties of bare Pt/TiO2 at 400–700 nm with a significant wide and high absorption peak (Fig. 4b). It was worth noting that the trend of the absorption maxima of the photocatalysts was in accordance with that of the corresponding dyes in THF solution, following the order SD3@Pt/TiO2 > SD2@Pt/TiO2 > SD1@Pt/TiO2. However, a significantly broader and higher absorption was observed for SD2@Pt/TiO2, which was remarkable since the light-capturing capability of the dye SD2 was the weakest in previous tests, suggesting that the compound SD2@Pt/TiO2 can capture more photons for photocatalytic H2 evolution.46

Photocatalytic H2 production and stability
The H2 evolution reaction (HER) activity of all the samples was evaluated under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm) with AA as the sacrificial agent. And the corresponding H2 evolution rates of Pt/TiO2, SD1@Pt/TiO2, SD2@Pt/TiO2 and SD3@Pt/TiO2 under irradiation for 5 h are shown in Fig. 4a. A decent average H2 evolution rate of 23.5 mmol g−1 h−1 was realized for SD2@Pt/TiO2, which was 13.0 times larger than that for Pt/TiO2 (1.8 mmol g−1 h−1). Compared with SD2@Pt/TiO2, both SD1@Pt/TiO2 and SD3@Pt/TiO2 exhibited lower photocatalytic activity of 14.1 and 18.2 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively. This was in good agreement with the intensity of the absorption peak under the DRS spectrum. In order to further explore the impact of the absorption spectrum on the photocatalytic activity, apparent quantum yields (AQYs) were investigated under multitudinous monochromatic light irradiation by band-pass filters (λ = 435, 450, 500, 550, 630, and 700 nm). The wavelength-dependent AQY values coincided with the DRS curves (Fig. 5b and Fig. S3, ESI†), suggesting that the H2 evolution is dominantly driven by light.46 As expected, SD1@Pt/TiO2 and SD3@Pt/TiO2 showed lower AQY values than SD2@Pt/TiO2, which achieved a high AQY value of 6.06% at 630 nm. Additionally, the detailed calculation process and values of the AQY are displayed in Table S2 (ESI†).

(b) Comparison of the AQY values and the DRS spectra of SD2@Pt/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 under optimal photocatalytic conditions. (c) Photostability for H2 production of SD1@Pt/TiO2, SD2@Pt/TiO2 and SD3@Pt/TiO2. (d) DRS spectra of the recovered samples after three cycles. 
Moreover, the long-periodic photostability as a paramount catalytic performance index was studied via three consecutive cycles with 5 h for each run. No significant activity decay can be observed on SD2@Pt/TiO2 after 15 h of continuous light soaking (Fig. 5c). In contrast, only 68% of photocatalytic activity could be retained in SD3@Pt/TiO2, implying that the SD2-based catalyst showed better stability in withstanding the harsh photocatalytic conditions. This result was further verified by the DRS spectra of the samples after continuous operation (Fig. 5d). The absorption intensity of SD2@Pt/TiO2 showed no significant changes, while that of SD1@Pt/TiO2 decreased by 30%. The above tests clearly illustrated that the thiophene π-bridge moiety can effectively improve the stability of the dyes in the photocatalysts in an aqueous reaction system.
To further understand the behavior of these photocatalysts, spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical studies were performed. Steady-state PL is a commonly used and effective method to survey the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.47 As shown in Fig. 6a, a higher emission intensity of SD1 and SD3 can be observed due to the stronger recombination of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs, while SD2 exhibited the lowest fluorescence intensity, indicating that the introduction of the thiophene π-bridge moiety could greatly facilitate the transfer of photo-electrons. It should be noted that remarkable PL quenching of all dyes was observed after adding Pt/TiO2, suggesting that the formation of an interface between TiO2 and the dye can increase the charge separation efficiency and inhibit the recombination of the electron–holes pairs efficiently.45 The interfacial photoinduced charge transfer kinetics process between SD1 (SD2 and SD3) and TiO2 was further verified by TRFS. As displayed in Fig. 6b, the average fluorescence lifetimes (τ) of SD1, SD2, SD3 and dye-Pt/TiO2 were characterized, and the relative data are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The τ values are 1.74, 1.44, and 1.57 ns for SD1, SD2, and SD3, respectively, while those of SD1–Pt/TiO2, SD2–Pt/TiO2 and SD3–Pt/TiO2 decreased significantly to 1.43, 0.85, and 1.02 ns, respectively. Generally, a shorter decay lifetime from dyes to TiO2 means faster electron transfer and slower charge recombination.48 Combined with the dihedral angle discussed above, the lowest τ of SD2–Pt/TiO2 could be associated with the better molecular planarity of SD2, which can effectively accelerate electron transfer and reduce charge recombination, thereby promoting the photocatalytic H2 evolution.

In order to investigate the charge-transfer properties of the samples deeply, EIS was performed. Unlike the EIS experiment on the DSC devices above, these photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in an aqueous solution rather than an acetonitrile solution to simulate the real conditions of photocatalytic H2 production. The SD2/TiO2 membrane electrode exhibited the smallest semicircle in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 6c), indicating a lower photocarrier transfer resistance and faster charge transfer in SD2@Pt/TiO2 compared to that in the other two photocatalysts. Furthermore, SD1/TiO2 had the largest semicircle which was in good agreement with the observed HER. These results were so wondrous since the SD1-based devices perform better than the SD2-based devices in DSCs, suggesting that the optimization effect of adjusting the π-bridge moiety varies greatly in different systems. These phenomena were also supported by the I–t curves with several on/off cycles. SD2/TiO2 exhibited a higher stable photocurrent density of about 18.1 μA cm−2 compared to SD1/TiO2 and SD3/TiO2 (Fig. 6d), confirming that an efficient separation of electron–hole pairs occurred in SD2@Pt/TiO2 in an aqueous environment.
Moreover, it is important to consider the effect of the local environment on dye regeneration, since the hydrophilic structure can enhance charge transfer between the dye and the sacrificial reagent.49 Therefore, the water contact angle measurement was used to further verify the effect of different π-bridge moieties on the hydrophilicity of the dyes. As shown in Fig. 7, SD2@Pt/TiO2 exhibited a smaller water contact angle of 32.79° compared to SD1@Pt/TiO2 (38.65°) and SD3@Pt/TiO2 (36.68°), indicating better hydrophilicity caused by the thiophene π-bridge moiety, which is in good agreement with the photocatalytic performance.

The proposed mechanism of the dye-sensitized photocatalytic H2 production systems is shown in Fig. 8. Excited by visible light, the dye SD2 injected excited electrons into the CB of TiO2 and then could be regenerated by accepting the electrons from the sacrificial reagent (AA). At the same time, the excited electrons were further captured by the Pt nanoparticles to produce H2 with water molecules. It was worth noting that electron injection and dye regeneration, as the core of this catalytic cycle, were successfully optimized by the π-bridge moiety in this work. The better hydrophilicity of SD2@Pt/TiO2 improved the dye regeneration, and the more negative LUMO level (−1.20 V vs. NHE) and better molecular planarity of SD2 optimized the electron injection, thus contributing to a remarkable H2 evolution rate of SD2@Pt/TiO2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, through rational molecular structure modifications, three new indeno[1,2-b]thiophene-based organic sensitizers with cyclopentadithiophene-benzene/thiophene/furan different π-bridge moieties, SD1, SD2 and SD3, were designed and investigated for applications in DSCs and dye-sensitized TiO2 photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible-light irradiation. The SD1-based DSCs with cobalt electrolytes achieved an impressive PCE of 8.96% under standard AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight, which was higher than those of SD2 and SD3, respectively. The markedly improved PCE of the SD1-based DSCs originates from the higher Jsc value, less charge recombination led by a large torsional angle and high driving force for dye regeneration. On the other hand, the composite of SD2@Pt/TiO2 afforded the highest H2 evolution rate of 23.5 mmol g−1 h−1 in an AA aqueous environment due to the efficient separation of electron–hole pairs, better planarity and faster electron transfer, while SD1@Pt/TiO2 exhibited the lowest photocatalytic activity of 14.1 mmol g−1 h−1. Although DSCs and dye-sensitized photocatalytic H2 production systems possess similar electron-transfer steps, the effects of the π-bridge moiety on these two systems showed opposite results, which might be caused by the effect of the local environment on dye regeneration. In particular, in photocatalytic H2 production systems, SD2@Pt/TiO2 with better hydrophilicity can enhance charge transfer between SD2 and the sacrificial reagent in an aqueous environment to achieve excellent H2 evolution activity. Overall, these results show that more efficient DSCs and photocatalysts with higher H2 evolution rates can be obtained through rational molecular structure modifications of the π-bridge moiety, providing a new insight into the design of D–A–π–A organic dyes to sensitize TiO2 for highly efficient and stable photocatalytic reactions.
