    , Accepted 13th March 2021First published on 15th March 2021AbstractThe active layer morphology with a domain size of 10–20 nm and large interfacial area plays a significant role in governing the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semitransparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs). However, the unbalanced aggregation rate of a polymer donor and a near infrared non-fullerene acceptor led to a large phase separation domain. In order to inhibit the intense aggregation of a non-fullerene acceptor, a third component which increases the nucleation and growth barrier of the non-fullerene acceptor can be added to balance aggregation leading to a suitable domain size of donors and acceptors. In order to verify our idea, PTB7-Th and non-fullerene acceptor IEICO-4F were selected as a model system. IEICO-4F tends to form strong aggregation due to its planar conformation. In order to suppress the intense aggregation, an amorphous molecule NCBDT-4Cl which has good miscibility with IEICO-4F is added to increase the nucleation barrier of IEICO-4F because NCBDT-4Cl can be dispersed evenly in the IEICO-4F phase. In situ UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded to monitor the nucleation and growth process of IEICO-4F during the drying process. The results show that the growth time of IEICO-4F is reduced to 45 s from 122 s by incorporating 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl, resulting in reduced aggregation of IEICO-4F. The small IEICO-4F aggregates disperse in the PTB7-Th matrix and form refined bicontinuous pathways. The optimized ternary ST-PSCs achieve a PCE of 10.31% with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 20.6%.
1. Introduction
In recent years, semitransparent polymer solar cells have been regarded as a feasible energy technology owing to their future applications in greenhouse, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), and automobile glass.1–3 The performance of ST-PSCs is evaluated by the PCE as well as the transparency. Highly efficient ST-PSCs need bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture.4–7 The ideal morphology is a small domain size of about 10–20 nm and large interfacial area to guarantee efficient exciton diffusion and splitting prior to geminate recombination. Besides, a suitable degree of crystallinity with high domain purity is required for charge transport. Furthermore, the formation of bicontinuous pathways is the key to charge collection.
The development of near-infrared (NIR) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) provides a new opportunity to fabricate efficient ST-PSCs with high AVT.8–11 However, the low bandgap NFAs tend to form intense aggregation and excessive phase separation due to their planar conformation,12–14 resulting in the deterioration of performance. It has been proved that increasing molecular steric hindrance by side-chain engineering or an appropriate twisted conformation is an effective approach to hinder the over-aggregation and optimize the phase separation.15–18 Besides, some physical methods are alternatives to solve the problem, among which the ternary strategy shows a notable advantage owing to the more easily controlled morphology and improved morphology stability.19–24 For example, the combination of two NFAs with good compatibility,20,24–28 such as IDIC:ID4F,21 COi8DFIC:BDTThIT-4F,27 IT-2Cl:IT-4Cl,28 and so on, can form an alloy structure. Then the aggregation behavior can be regulated efficiently by finely controlling the weight composition.26–28 Additionally, introducing an intermolecular interaction, such as a hydrogen-bond,23 by the third component can increase the π–π stacking distance and disturb the intense molecular arrangement of the non-fullerene acceptor. Moreover, the morphology can be locked by the enhanced intermolecular interaction, which endows the ternary PSCs with improved stability.23,24,29–31
However, the obtained phase separation information from the static dried films in the ternary blend is limited. The mechanism of the crystallization kinetics during film solidification is still lacking. Understanding the film-formation kinetics can provide guidelines to further optimize the phase separation and fabricate efficient ST-PSCs.32–34 So far, most of the kinetics studies focused on the fullerene-based system.35–40 Compared with the fullerene-based PSCs, the crystallization kinetics of NFA-based PSCs is more complicated due to the different chemical structure and molecular packing41–43 of NFAs. However, few researchers pay attention to the film-formation kinetics of NFA-based PSCs. Therefore, extensive research studies are in demand to obtain an in-depth understanding of morphology development of NFA-based PSCs during film formation.
In this work, we chose PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F8,23 as a model system. The NIR low bandgap IEICO-4F shows a tendency to form intense aggregation due to its planar conformation, especially blends with amorphous PTB7-Th. NCBDT-4Cl44 is selected elaborately as a mediator to manipulate the crystallization process of IEICO-4F. As a result, the growth time of IEICO-4F is reduced to 45 s from 122 s by incorporating 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl, leading to reduced crystallinity of IEICO-4F. The resulting bicontinuous network promotes exciton splitting and achieves balanced charge transport. The PCE of the optimized ternary opaque devices is enhanced from 11.09% to 12.37% with an improved short-circuit current (Jsc) of 25.49 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.2%. A series of ST-PSCs were fabricated with different Ag thickness. The optimized ternary ST-PSCs achieve a PCE of 10.31% with an AVT of 20.6% in the range of 370–740 nm. This work demonstrates that the construction of a bicontinuous network by controlling the film-formation kinetics enables the performance of ST-PSCs to be optimized.
2. Results and discussion
The crystallization kinetics plays a crucial role in determining the morphology of the active layers.45–51 Herein, the influence of NCBDT-4Cl on the crystallization kinetics of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend system is systematically investigated. The results show that the long crystallization process provides sufficient time for IEICO-4F to grow, resulting in the formation of excessive phase separation. The incorporation of NCBDT-4Cl hinders the diffusion and deposition of IEICO-4F due to the good miscibility of the two acceptors, which shortens the growth time of IEICO-4F. The resulting small crystallites of IEICO-4F disperse in PTB7-Th matrix and they form a refined bicontinuous network. The optimized ternary PSCs promote exciton splitting and achieve balanced charge transport. The optimized ternary ST-PSCs achieve a PCE of 10.31% with an AVT of 20.6%.
PCE and AVT of the ST-PSCs
The chemical structures of PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F, and NCBDT-4Cl are exhibited in Fig. 1a. IEICO-4F exhibits a highly planar conformation due to its rigid backbone. The energy diagram of these materials is displayed in Fig. 1b.8,44 The energy levels are aligned well to promote exciton splitting. The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F, and NCBDT-4Cl films are displayed in Fig. 1c. The absorption peak of PTB7-Th appears at 706 nm with a shoulder at 641 nm. For low bandgap IEICO-4F, its absorption peak appears at 854 nm, lying in the NIR region, which is beneficial to improve the AVT. With regard to NCBDT-4Cl, the absorption peak appears at 784 nm. Thus, the absorption region of these materials is well complementary. The absorption spectra of blend films with varied NCBDT-4Cl content are exhibited in Fig. 1d. The combination of the absorption of these materials covers from 600 nm to 1000 nm, from which efficient photon harvesting is expected.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the opaque devices with varied NCBDT-4Cl content are presented in Fig. 2a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table 1. The ternary opaque devices with 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl in acceptors achieve a champion PCE of 12.37% with the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V, Jsc of 25.49 mA cm−2, and impressive FF of 70.2%. A refined network is expected in the optimized ternary PSCs because the good miscibility of the two acceptors can disturb the intense molecular packing of IEICO-4F. In IEICO-4F-based binary PSCs, IEICO-4F tends to form intense aggregation due to its highly planar conformation. The formed large pure domains with high crystallinity are detrimental to exciton splitting, which is responsible for the reduced Jsc of 24.48 mA cm−2 with moderate PCE of 11.09%. For NCBDT-4Cl-based binary opaque devices, the narrow absorption region results in the lowest Jsc of 21.35 mA cm−2 and PCE of 9.91%.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of devices with varied NCBDT-4Cl content are exhibited in Fig. 2b. We can observe the EQE response is improved by incorporating NCBDT-4Cl in the range of 300–700 nm, which accounts for the enhanced Jsc of the ternary devices when NCBDT-4Cl content is less than 20 wt%. However, further increasing the content of NCBDT-4Cl significantly reduces the EQE response in the NIR region. The narrow EQE spectra limit the photon harvesting and exciton generation. The calculated integrated Jsc of the IEICO-4F-based binary, NCBDT-4Cl-based binary, and optimized ternary devices are 23.61 mA cm−2, 20.42 mA cm−2, and 24.55 mA cm−2, respectively. The calculated Jsc shows small variations of less than 5% with that obtained from the J–V results.
The J–V curves and transmission spectra of the binary and optimized ternary ST-PSCs with the anode of Au (1 nm)/Ag (15 nm) are shown in Fig. 3a and b. Compared with IEICO-4F-based binary ST-PSCs, the PCE of the optimized ternary ST-PSCs with 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl in acceptors increases to 10.31% from 9.44%, while the AVT is almost unchanged. Fig. 3c shows the color coordinates (x, y) of ST-PSCs in the CIE xy (1931) chromaticity diagram. The color coordinates of IEICO-4F-based binary, NCBDT-4Cl-based binary, and the optimized ternary ST-PSCs are (0.25, 0.28), (0.24, 0.27), and (0.24, 0.28), respectively. The detailed performance parameters are provided in Table 2. From Table 2, we can conclude that the Jsc of the optimized ternary ST-PSCs increases from 18.86 mA cm−2 to 21.50 mA cm−2, whereas the AVT decreases from 27.7% to 20.6% when the thickness of Ag increases from 10 nm to 15 nm. The increased reflectivity of the thicker semitransparent electrode increases the photon harvesting, resulting in higher Jsc.

The optimized ternary PSCs promote exciton dissociation, charge transport and reduce monomolecular recombination
To verify the charge transfer between the components, the photoluminescence spectra were recorded (Fig. 4a). As displayed in Fig. 4a, PTB7-Th displays a broad emission with the peak at 764 nm. The photoluminescence of PTB7-Th is nearly completely quenched in the IEICO-4F-based binary blend film and the optimized ternary blend film. The emission peaks of IEICO-4F and NCBDT-4Cl are at 927 nm and 849 nm, respectively. Notably, 26% photoluminescence of IEICO-4F is observed in the IEICO-4F-based binary blend film. While only 17% photoluminescence of IEICO-4F is detected in the optimized ternary blend film. The deeper quenching of IEICO-4F suggests the charge transfer is more efficient and sufficient interface area between donor and acceptors forms for exciton splitting in the ternary blend with 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl incorporation, which explains the enhanced Jsc.
 Fig. 4  (a) Photoluminescence spectra of the pristine PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F, and NCBDT-4Cl films and the binary and optimized ternary blend films; (b) characteristics of the Jphversus Veff; (c) measurement of Jscversus Plight; (d) measurement of Vocversus Plight. 
The photon harvesting and exciton splitting efficiency are evaluated through the characteristics of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4b). Here, Jph and Veff are defined as Jph = JL − JD and Veff = V0 − Va, respectively. JL and JD represent the current density of PSCs under illuminated state and in the dark, respectively. V0 represents the voltage when Jph is 0 and Va represents the applied voltage. The optimized ternary devices reach the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) at 27.18 mA cm−2. However, the Jsat values of the IEICO-4F-based and NCBDT-4Cl-based binary devices are 26.35 and 22.48 mA cm−2, respectively. This confirms that a higher exciton generation rate occurs in the optimized ternary devices, which is in accordance with the improved Jsc. Furthermore, the overall exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency of PSCs can be assessed by the Jph/Jsat value. Compared with the Jph/Jsat value of 92.9% in the IEICO-4F-based binary devices under the short-circuit and maximal power output conditions, the optimized ternary devices show the Jph/Jsat value of 93.8%. This suggests that the introduction of NCBDT-4Cl improves charge splitting and extraction.
The free charge carriers suffer from nongeminate recombination during transport. The nongeminate recombination is divided into monomolecular (trap-assisted) or bimolecular mechanisms. The recombination mechanism was investigated by the measurement of Jsc and Vocversus light intensity (Plight), respectively (Fig. 4c and d). The Jsc and Plight have the relationship of Jsc ∝ Pαlight.52,53 The figure-of-merit (α) value close to 1, indicative of the recombination, is dominated by a monomolecular mechanism at short-circuit. The Voc and Plight have the relationship of Voc ∝ (nkBT/q) ln(Plight), where kB, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively.54,55 The n values close to 1 and 2 reflect the bimolecular and monomolecular mechanism dominated at open-circuit, respectively. The optimized ternary devices show the α and n values of 0.96 and 1.28, respectively, lower than the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F binary devices of 0.97 and 1.52. The results reflect that compared with the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F binary devices, the monomolecular recombination is reduced by incorporating 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl. For the PTB7-Th:NCBDT-4Cl binary devices, the α and n values are 0.93 and 1.07, respectively, suggesting the system suffers from severe bimolecular recombination.
The hole and electron transport also have a profound influence on determining the performance of PSCs. The hole (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the PSCs are provided in Table S1 (ESI†). The μh and μe of the IEICO-4F-based binary PSCs are 4.66 × 10−4 and 2.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The optimized ternary PSCs shows the more balanced μh and μe of 5.11 × 10−4 and 4.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the μh/μe ratio of 1.22, which accounts for the improvement of FF in the optimized ternary PSCs.
A refined bicontinuous network governs device performance
Herein, the non-fullerene acceptor NCBDT-4Cl was selected elaborately to suppress the intense aggregation of IEICO-4F due to the good miscibility with IEICO-4F. The WCAs of pristine PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F, NCBDT-4Cl films, and the IEICO-4F:NCBDT-4Cl blend film are 102.8°, 94.3°, 92.8°, and 93.6°, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). The surface energy values calculated by Young's equation56 are γPTB7-Th = 20.6 mN m−1, γIEICO-4F = 25.8 mN m−1, γNCBDT-4Cl = 26.8 mN m−1, and γIEICO-4F:NCBDT-4Cl = 26.3 mN m−1. The comparable surface energy values of the two acceptors indicate that NCBDT-4Cl has good compatibility with IEICO-4F and they achieve a nanoscale mixing. Interfacial energy is also an important parameter to evaluate the compatibility of different materials.57–59 The interfacial energy values of the materials are γPTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ≈ 0.435 mN m−1, γPTB7-Th:NCBDT-4Cl ≈ 0.614 mN m−1, and γIEICO-4F:NCBDT-4Cl ≈ 0.016 mN m−1, respectively. The low interfacial energy value of NCBDT-4Cl and IEICO-4F means that they form an inseparable phase due to good compatibility. Thus, the strong aggregation of IEICO-4F can be greatly inhibited by incorporating NCBDT-4Cl.
The encouraging performance persuades us to study the microstructure of the active layers. TEM was employed to study the phase separation (Fig. 5a–c). As presented in Fig. 5a, large dark and bright regions appear in the IEICO-4F-based binary blend film, indicative of donor-rich or acceptor-rich domains. The large regions disappear in the optimized ternary blend film. This suggests the intense aggregation of IEICO-4F is inhibited by incorporating NCBDT-4Cl. Moreover, the domains distribute evenly in the blend film, indicating good connectivity of the donor and acceptors. The bicontinuous pathways are beneficial to charge transport, which agrees with the enhanced FF. However, the morphology of the NCBDT-4Cl-based binary blend film becomes uniform and no obvious phase separation can be resolved, which increases the possibility of nongeminate recombination. The AFM was used to analyze the surface morphology of the blend films (Fig. 5d–f). The IEICO-4F-based binary blend film shows a high roughness of 2.63 nm due to the self-aggregation tendency of IEICO-4F. It decreases to 1.18 nm in the optimized ternary blend film, suggesting that NCBDT-4Cl suppresses the over-aggregation of IEICO-4F. The NCBDT-4Cl-based binary blend film displays a smooth surface and the roughness is 0.80 nm. The result is consistent with that obtained from TEM images.
 Fig. 5  TEM images and AFM surface morphology images of the (a and d) IEICO-4F-based binary, (b and e) the optimized ternary, and (c and f) NCBDT-4Cl-based binary blend films. 
The GIXD was employed to study the structure details of the blend films. As displayed in Fig. 6, the structure order of PTB7-Th is weak. A (010) peak at 16.4 nm−1 is found in the out-of-plane direction and a (100) peak at 2.9 nm−1 is found in the in-plane direction, meaning that the π–π stacking distance is 3.8 Å. IEICO-4F exhibits strong crystallinity with a (100) peak at 3.1 nm−1 in the in-plane direction, meanwhile two out-of-plane peaks at 3.5 nm−1 and 18.3 nm−1 with reduced π–π stacking distance of 3.4 Å. NCBDT-4Cl exhibits a broad in-plane peak at 3.2 nm−1 and a weak out-of-plane peak at 16.5 nm−1. The pristine PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F, and NCBDT-4Cl films all prefer a face-on orientation. From Fig. 6e, we observe that the IEICO-4F-based binary blend film displays strong IEICO-4F molecular order, which is evidenced by the strong in-plane diffraction peak at 3.4 nm−1 and the out-of-plane peak at 18.4 nm−1. This indicates the π–π stacking of IEICO-4F is perpendicular to the substrate in the blend film, which facilitates the efficient charge transport toward electrodes. The optimized ternary blend film with 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl in acceptors shows reduced molecular packing order, where the in-plane (100) peak intensity and the out-of-plane (010) peak intensity is moderately reduced. Thus, the introduction of NCBDT-4Cl hinders the crystallization of IEICO-4F, which prevents the formation of excessive phase separation. The NCBDT-4Cl-based binary blend film shows much weaker crystallinity, the amorphous nature of the materials results in poor device performance.

DSC measurements were utilized to confirm the influence of NCBDT-4Cl on the crystallinity of the blend system. DSC thermograms of the blend systems with varied NCBDT-4Cl content are exhibited in Fig. 7. We notice a melting point of 223 °C in the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend system, which is identified as the melting point of IEICO-4F, as PTB7-Th is less crystalline and it shows no signal in the DSC thermogram. Meanwhile an exothermic transition is observed at 162 °C, probably due to the cold crystallization of IEICO-4F upon heating. The melting point decreases to 221 °C and the exothermic transition decreases to 160 °C by incorporating 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl. The melting enthalpies of IEICO-4F are calculated and labeled in Fig. 7b. Compared with the IEICO-4F-based binary blend, the melting enthalpy of the optimized ternary blend is reduced to 2.65 J g−1 from 3.66 J g−1. The result indicates the crystallinity of IEICO-4F is reduced by incorporating NCBDT-4Cl.

NCBDT-4Cl increases the nucleation and growth barrier of IEICO-4F
For further investigating the mechanism of the formation of the refined bicontinuous network, in situ UV-vis absorption spectra were employed to monitor the film-forming kinetics of blend films with varied NCBDT-4Cl content (Fig. 8a–f). Interestingly, the absorption spectra of copolymer PTB7-Th show no spectra shift from solution to solid film (Fig. S6, ESI†). This is attributed to the planarity and rigidity of the PTB7-Th backbone. The result indicates the chains of PTB7-Th do not lose their conjugation length and have already formed a folded structure even in solution.60,61
 Fig. 8  (a–f) In situ absorption spectra of blend films with NCBDT-4Cl content varied from 0 to 70 wt% during the film-formation process. (g–l) The absorption peak intensity of IEICO-4F as a function of time with the NCBDT-4Cl content varied from 0 to 70 wt%. 
According to the spectra, the time scale evolution of IEICO-4F peak intensity is identified to understand its crystallization kinetics. As presented in Fig. 8g, the absorption peak at 913 nm represents the interchain aggregation of IEICO-4F. The film-forming process consists of three stages. During stage I (0–408 s), the molecular chains of IEICO-4F remain well solvated and the peak intensity of IEICO-4F absorbance shows no obvious variation. In stage II (408–530 s), IEICO-4F reaches the solubility limit during solvent evaporation, followed by the precipitation of IEICO-4F, as evidenced by the sharp increasing of the absorption intensity. In this stage, the interchain interaction of IEICO-4F enhances, resulting in more efficient electron delocalization. The delocalized electrons interact with each other, which enables IEICO-4F to form π–π stacking. During stage III, the solvent content is low. The movement of IEICO-4F chains is confined during the slow solvent evaporation, resulting in local crystal growth of IEICO-4F. The peak intensity of IEICO-4F evolves slowly and reaches the maximum. The crystallization process of IEICO-4F finishes once full solidification of the film occurs.
The film-forming process of the blend film with 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl incorporation also includes three stages (Fig. 8i). The evolution of IEICO-4F absorption intensity in stage I and stage III are similar to that of IEICO-4F-based binary blend films. However, the crystallization process of IEICO-4F in stage II shows a big difference. The crystal growth time of IEICO-4F-based binary blend film is 122 s. IEICO-4F chains have sufficient time to diffuse to the nucleus, which favors the growth of IEICO-4F. The long crystallization process of IEICO-4F provides a driving force for excessive phase separation, leading to inefficient exciton dissociation. As for the ternary blend, the third component NCBDT-4Cl has good miscibility with IEICO-4F. Thus, it disperses evenly in the IEICO-4F phase, which inhibits the nucleation of IEICO-4F. In stage II (385–430 s), the diffusion of IEICO-4F is suppressed due to the nanoscale mixing of the two acceptors. The crystal growth time of IEICO-4F is reduced to 45 s in the blend film with 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl incorporation. The shortened crystallization process suppresses the strong π–π stacking of IEICO-4F. The formed small crystallites disperse in the PTB7-Th matrix and rationalize the formation of a refined bicontinuous network.
We also investigated the influence of varied NCBDT-4Cl content on the film-formation kinetics of IEICO-4F. As displayed in Fig. 8g–l, the growth time of IEICO-4F is shortened from 122 s to 45 s when the content of NCBDT-4Cl is increased to 20 wt%. However, further increasing the content of NCBDT-4Cl increases the crystallization process of IEICO-4F, as signaled by the slow and long evolution of IEICO-4F absorption intensity. This is because IEICO-4F disperses in the NCBDT-4Cl phase with increasing NCBDT-4Cl content. Then it is difficult for IEICO-4F to aggregate and form a crystal nucleus. As a result, the blend films with higher NCBDT-4Cl content are less crystalline.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we chose non-fullerene acceptor NCBDT-4Cl as a mediator to manipulate the crystallization kinetics of a PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend system. In the host system, the long crystallization process of IEICO-4F provides sufficient time for growth, resulting in the formation of large pure domains and excessive phase separation. The incorporation of NCBDT-4Cl hinders the diffusion of IEICO-4F due to their good miscibility. The growth time of IEICO-4F is shortened to 45 s from 122 s by incorporating 20 wt% NCBDT-4Cl. As a result, the crystallinity of IEICO-4F is reduced and achieves balance with PTB7-Th. The resulting bicontinuous network promotes exciton splitting and achieves balanced charge transport. The PCE of the optimized ternary opaque devices are enhanced from 11.09% to 12.37% with improved Jsc of 25.49 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.2%. The optimized ternary ST-PSCs achieve a PCE of 10.31% with an AVT of 20.6%. This work thus allows to obatin an in-depth understanding of the crystallization kinetics in ternary blends, which provides guidelines to further optimize the morphology and boost the performance of ST-PSCs.
4. Experimental section
Materials
The copolymer donor PTB7-Th was purchased from 1-Materials Inc. The Mn of PTB7-Th is 84k and the polydispersity index (PDI) is 2.3. The non-fullerene acceptors IEICO-4F and NCBDT-4Cl were purchased from Solarmer Material Inc. Chlorobenzene (CB) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The materials were used as received.
Device fabrication
Polymer solar cells were prepared using an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:NCBDT-4Cl/MoO3/Ag. The zinc oxide (ZnO) solution was prepared by the sol–gel method,62 spin-coated on ITO substrates at 5000 rounds per minute (RPM) for 60 s and annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in the atmosphere. The PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend and PTB7-Th:NCBDT-4Cl blend with 1:1.5 weight ratio were dissolved in chlorobenzene to prepare 20 mg mL−1 solutions, respectively. Then the solutions were blended with the proportions of 1:0, 0.9:0.1, 0.8:0.2, 0.7:0.3, 0.5:0.5, 0.3:0.7, and 0:1. The additive CN (the ratio of CN and CB is 2:98 by volume) was added into the blend solutions. Then the solution was spin-coated at 1700 rpm for 40 s. A thin MoO3 layer (10 nm) and a Ag layer (100 nm) were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation. For ST-PSCs, the Ag electrode was substituted by Au (1 nm)/Ag. The Ag thickness was 10 nm, 13 nm or 15 nm.
Characterization
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption measurement and transmission measurement were done with a Lambda 750 spectrum (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA). In situ absorption measurement was also performed with the instrument. The photoluminescence spectroscopy was tested with a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were conducted with a JEOL JEM-1011 with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was tested using a SPA-300HV instrument (Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan) in the tapping mode. The information on surface morphology was analyzed by Gwyddion software. The GIXD experiments were performed at the BL14B1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) (λ = 1.24 Å). The water contact angle (WCAs) measurements were done using a goniometer (KRUSS GmbH Germany DO3021 Mk1). The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) thermograms were collected with the Q2000 TA Instruments.
Charge mobility measurement
Electron-only or hole-only devices were prepared with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layers/PFN-Br/Ag or ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag, respectively. The charge mobility was extracted using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method63,64 according to the equation:  where J represents the current density, εr and ε0 represent the relative permittivity and the free space permittivity, respectively, μ represents the zero-filed mobility, V represents the effective voltage (V = Vapplied − Vbi − Vseries), d represents the thickness, and γ represents the field-activation factor.
