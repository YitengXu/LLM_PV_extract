    , Accepted 14th June 2016First published on 14th June 2016AbstractTwo conjugated acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor (A–π–D–π–A) small molecules with a zinc porphyrin donor core and 3-ethylrhodanine terminal acceptors connected at the meso positions by ethynylene groups and linked by one or two thienylenevinylene units denoted by 1a and 1b were synthesized and their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells fabricated with 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM processed with THF exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 2.75% (Jsc = 7.96 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.36) and 3.18% (Jsc = 8.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.90 V and FF = 0.40), respectively. Moreover, organic solar cells based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM processed with pyridine/THF solution displayed PCEs of 5.27% (Jsc = 10.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.54) and 5.78% (Jsc = 11.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.58), respectively. However, most important is the observation that the PCE was further increased to 7.24% for devices based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM active layers processed with pyridine/THF solution by employing CuSCN as a selective contact electrode instead of the most common hole transport material, namely, PEDOT:PSS.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSC) are a topic of current scientific interest as a complementary photovoltaic technology to current silicon solar cells owing to their solution processability, potential low cost of fabrication, light weight and high transparency.1 At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed organic solar cells based on a single BHJ active layer using a low-band-gap conjugated polymer has exceeded 10% (ref. 2) and is expected to be higher than 11% for a tandem configuration3 and, more recently, about 13.2% (ref. 4) for triple-junction organic solar cells using evaporated organic thin films. In recent years, small molecules, which are defined as organic molecules with a low molecular weight, have attracted much attention owing to their well-defined molecular structure, easier purification, and less batch-to-batch variation in comparison with polymers5 and the PCE has been increased significantly to 10%, which is comparable to those of polymer counterparts.6
Porphyrins, which are synthetic analogues of natural chlorophylls, are of special interest, because they are known to be a natural choice as light-harvesting antenna systems that are involved in energy and electron transfer processes.7 Porphyrins exhibit large molar extinction coefficients8 and tuneable electrochemical and photophysical properties via the modification of the central metal and/or the introduction of suitable substituents at peripheral positions on the macrocycle.9 As an example, porphyrin dyes have been successfully used as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells and achieved a PCE of more than 13%.10 In fact, in recent years, there has been a great focus of interest on the field of solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells using porphyrin derivatives as donors, which resulted in PCEs from 2 to 8%.11 In organic solar cells the limitation on thickness, which is imposed to achieve good carrier extraction, requires the use of molecules with outstanding light absorption. Thus, it is clear that porphyrins are a clear target for OSC.
We have previously demonstrated that molecules with an A–π–D–π–A structure, where A is an electron-acceptor unit, π is a conjugated moiety and D is an electron-donor unit, and electron-withdrawing terminal groups are a general design for molecules that enable efficient solar cells. Such molecules often exhibit: (i) high mobility with a planar structure and efficient π–π interactions, (ii) a low band gap resulting from intramolecular charge transfer and (iii) good film quality owing to a long conjugated backbone with dispersed alkyl chains similar to polymers.
Here, we report the synthesis of two new conjugated A–π–D–π–A porphyrin small molecules, along with their photophysical and electrochemical properties. These molecules consist of the same thienyl-substituted zinc porphyrin core as a donor linked by ethynylene groups to one (1a) or two (1b) units of thienylenevinylene and capped by 3-ethylrhodanine groups as acceptor units (the chemical structure is shown in Scheme 1). The ethynylene groups induce molecular planarity as well as extending the π-system; moreover, the use of hexyl chains enhances their solubility.
 Scheme 1  Structures of 1a and 1b. 
During preparation of this manuscript, a porphyrin-based small molecule with a similar structure to 1a, but lacking hexyl chains in the thiophene bridge,12 has been described with a power conversion efficiency of up to 4.97% after processing using pyridine followed by thermal annealing. We want to remark that different alkyl chains induce remarkable differences in solid-state properties that are crucial for exciton diffusion and charge transport and consequently for photovoltaic performance.13
These two porphyrin molecules were used as donors along with PC71BM as an acceptor component for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells and displayed overall PCEs of 2.75% and 3.18% for 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM, respectively, processed with THF solution. When the active layer of the device was processed with pyridine/THF solution, the photovoltaic characteristics were significantly improved, resulting in PCEs of 5.27% and 5.78% for 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM, respectively. The increase in the PCE was ascribed to an increase in hole mobility, resulting in higher values of charge transport and charge collection rates owing to the optimized crystallinity and nanoscale morphology of the active layer induced by the solvent additive.
Although PEDOT:PSS is widely used as a hole transport layer (HTL) in most organic BHJ solar cells based on small molecules and polymers, owing to the mismatch of its work function with the HOMO energy level of the donor component in the active layer it forms a barrier to hole extraction and is also not a good electron-blocking layer and has a tendency to trap electrons, leading to a change in device performance over time.14 Moreover, the hygroscopic, acidic and protonated nature of PSS in PEDOT:PSS influences the device stability. Copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) has been used as an HTL, as reported earlier for organic solar cells15 and hybrid perovskite solar cells.16 CuSCN is an inorganic molecular semiconductor, which is highly soluble in diethyl sulphide and diisopropyl sulphide and can be readily processed to yield a thin film with high transparency across the solar spectrum; also, its hole mobility can be increased to 0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 after mild thermal treatment (∼100 °C) and it is compatible with a variety of organic D–A materials. In addition to desirable optical transparency, CuSCN possesses a deep valence band edge at ∼5.30–5.35 eV, which can help extract holes from the active layer, as well as maximizing the Voc. Moreover, CuSCN can be deposited from solution using appropriate solvents and concentrations at room temperature. Inspired by the work reported in the literature, we used CuSCN as an HTL to increase the PCE and achieved overall PCEs of around 6.59% and 7.24% for devices based on active layers of 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM processed with pyridine/THF solutions.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic approach to the porphyrin-based molecules 1a and 1b is depicted in Scheme 2, starting from the Vilsmeier formylation of 2-hexylthiophene (yield: 94%) and followed by the reaction of aldehyde 217 with pyrrole via a modification of Lindsey's TFA acid-catalyzed condensation to afford 2,2′-((5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)methylene)bis(1H-pyrrole) 3 in 77.5% yield.18 Next, under an Ar atmosphere, 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propynal was added to a solution of 3 in CHCl3 and BF3·O(C2H5)2 was added to form a porphyrinogen, which was oxidized with DDQ; after one hour, Et3N was added, affording 5,15-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-10,20-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)porphyrin 4 in 7.3% yield. Porphyrin 4 was treated with zinc acetate in CHCl3 at room temperature overnight and [5,15-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-10,20-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)porphyrinato]zinc (5) was obtained in quantitative yield.19 Double deprotection of the terminal triple bonds was performed by treatment of 6 with TBAF, then the product was extracted with CHCl3 and used in the following step without further purification.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic route to 1a and 1b. 
Aldehydes 8a and 8b were obtained by double copper-free Sonogashira coupling of deprotected 6 with aldehydes 7a and 7b.20 In the presence of Et3N and using Pd2(dba)3 and triphenylarsine as a catalyst, compounds 8a and 8b were obtained in 60% yield (in both cases) after purification by column chromatography. Finally, the target compounds 1a and 1b were obtained in 95% and 34% yield, respectively, by double condensation of 8a and 8b with 3-ethylrhodanine and piperidine as a base (for details, see the Experimental section). All the new compounds were fully characterized by FT-IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of 1a and 1b confirmed the molecular structures, showing molecular ions at 1597.27 and 2148.16 amu, respectively (see ESI†). The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) suggest that 1a and 1b have high stability, with decomposition temperatures (Td) of above 360 °C under a N2 atmosphere (see ESI, Fig. S18†).
Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized optical absorption spectra of 1a and 1b in THF solution, as well as their thin films, are shown in Fig. 1a and b and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Compound 1a exhibits a Soret band at 510 nm (lgε = 5.21) and a broad band at 716 nm (lgε = 4.95), which is assigned to a charge transfer transition from the porphyrin core to the 3-ethylrhodanine fragment (Fig. 1a). On the other hand, 1b displays two new bands at 493 nm (lgε = 5.17) and 548 nm (lgε = 5.19), which are assigned to the π–π* transition of the conjugated oligomer, the Soret band at 510 nm (lgε = 5.15) and the charge transfer band at 722 nm (lgε = 5.20) (Fig. 1b).

In thin film, the absorption maxima of both porphyrins appeared red-shifted and broader relative to those in solution. The red shift was more pronounced for 1a, which is attributed to the extended backbone of 1b resulting in stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interactions than in 1a. Such an ordered packing of small molecules favours the achievement of high charge mobility.21 The optical band gaps, which were estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra in thin films, are 1.48 and 1.44 eV for 1a and 1b, respectively. The presence of 3-ethylrhodanine in these molecules effectively decreases the band gaps and extends their absorption into the NIR region.22 The fluorescence spectra of both porphyrins showed similar emission bands at 748 nm and 750 nm, respectively. The transition energy, i.e., the energy between the lowest vibrational ground state and the lowest vibrational excited state (E0–0), which was estimated from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra (see ESI Fig. S21†), is 1.71 eV (724 nm) and 1.66 eV (744 nm) for 1a and 1b, respectively. The lower value of E0–0 for 1b is attributed to the increased conjugation owing to the additional thienylenevinylene unit.
The HOMO and LUMO levels of these porphyrins were determined by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S22†) and Osteryoung square-wave voltammetry (OSWV) (Fig. S23†) and are summarized in Table 1. Owing to the more extended conjugation, the HOMO energy of 1b (−5.30 eV) is higher than that of 1a (−5.42 eV), both being compatible with the LUMO of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (−4.00 eV). In comparison with PC71BM used as an acceptor in devices, the energy difference between the HOMO levels of porphyrin compounds 1a and 1b and the LUMO level of PC71BM is 1.42 eV for 1a and 1.30 eV for 1b, values which in principle allow high open-circuit voltages. The ELUMO values were estimated from the reduction potential in a similar way and are −3.62 eV and −3.56 eV for 1a and 1b, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps of 1a and 1b are 1.80 eV and 1.74 eV, respectively, and the trend is consistent with the optical band gaps and E0–0 values. The deeper HOMO energy levels of these materials are favourable for achieving a high Voc in the corresponding BHJ OSCs. Moreover, the LUMO energy levels are higher than that of PC71BM (−4.0 eV) for efficient exciton dissociation, which indicates their suitability for use as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor in BHJ OSCs. Because the porphyrin core is a weak donor and 3-ethylrhodanine is a strong acceptor, the weak donor–strong acceptor configuration that is formed can provide favourable HOMO and LUMO energy levels, as well as a suitable energy band gap, which is beneficial for the efficient photovoltaic performance of BHJ OSCs.23
Theoretical calculations
The theoretical geometry and HOMO–LUMO properties of 1a and 1b were measured by DFT at the B3LYP 6-31G*(d, p) level of theory in the gas phase using Gaussian 03W. The most stable geometries of 1a and 1b are shown in Fig. 2. The thienylenevinylene fragments are almost coplanar with the plane formed by the porphyrin ring and the triple bonds, with a dihedral angle of 2.84° for 1a and 5.29° for 1b. This planarity enables an extension of the conjugation between the porphyrin and rhodanine fragments. The hexylthiophene rings are linked to the porphyrin cage with a dihedral angle of 69.5°.
 Fig. 2  Geometric structures of 1a and 1b. 
The theoretical distributions of the orbital coefficients of the HOMO and LUMO states (Fig. 3) show that there exists an overlap between the HOMO and LUMO in both molecules, which favors HOMO–LUMO electronic transitions. The charge density of the HOMO of 1a and 1b is delocalized over the porphyrin and thienylenevinylene fragments. The theoretical size of the HOMO–LUMO gap agrees with the experimentally obtained values and is 1.87 eV and 1.74 eV, respectively, for 1a and 1b.

Photovoltaic properties
Solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated employing these porphyrins as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor with a conventional device structure of ITO/HTM/donor:PC71BM with different weight ratios/Al. The active layer was spin-cast from the appropriate solution. The current–voltage characteristics under illumination (AM1.5 100 mW cm−2) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra of devices processed from a 1:2 weight ratio of 1a or 1b and PC71BM blended film are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2.

Devices based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM processed without a pyridine additive exhibited PCEs of 2.75% (Jsc = 7.96 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.36) and 3.18% (Jsc = 8.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.90 V and FF = 0.40), respectively. Both devices displayed a reasonably high value of Voc owing to their deeper HOMO energy levels. The higher value of Voc for the device based on 1a compared with 1b is attributed to the HOMO level of 1a being relatively deeper than that of 1b, because the Voc of a BHJ OSC is directly related to the energy difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor employed in the BHJ active layer. The higher value of the PCE for 1b compared with 1a is mainly attributed to the higher values of Jsc and FF. As shown in Fig. 4b, the IPCE spectra of the OSCs based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM displayed a broad response extending from 350 nm to 850 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectral properties of thin films of 1a and 1b. Moreover, the device based on 1b exhibited a slightly wider response and a higher value of IPCE, which is consistent with its absorption spectra. The LUMO offset between 1b and PC71BM is larger than that between 1a and PC71BM, which indicates that the driving force for the latter being stronger than for the former may also be the reason for the higher Jsc of the solar cell based on 1b.
Both 1a and 1b have the same chemical structure except for the thienylenevinylene conjugation length. In order to obtain information about the influence of the conjugation length of the π-linker on the charge transport properties, the hole mobility (μh) in the active layer was measured via the J–V characteristics in the dark using a hole-only device, i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, and fitting the curves with a space-charge-limited current model. Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of hole-only devices using 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM active layers. The hole mobility estimated from Fig. 5 and fitted with the SCLC model is 7.32 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.23 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1a and 1b, respectively. The hole mobility is determined by the intramolecular backbone, intermolecular packing and π–π stacking. Because both porphyrins have the same molecular structure except for the conjugation length of the π-linker, the difference in the hole mobility may be due to intermolecular π–π stacking. The two thienylenevinylene units in 1b may lead to strong intermolecular π–π stacking, resulting in higher mobility than in 1a. In comparison with 1a, 1b displayed stronger intermolecular interaction, as evidenced by the red shift in its absorption in both solution and thin film, which contributed to its charge transport ability.24 Stronger π–π stacking can increase the hole mobility owing to better molecular packing.25 These parameters are responsible for the higher Jsc and FF, resulting in a higher overall PCE for OSCs based on 1b compared with 1a.

The overall PCEs of BHJ OSCs based on these porphyrins processed with THF are smaller than those reported in the literature for small molecules as donors. Although the Voc values of these devices are reasonably high, the lower PCEs are mainly due to the low values of both Jsc and FF. These parameters are directly related to the light-harvesting efficiency of the active layer and the resulting charge generation, as well as charge transport within the active layer and collection to the respective electrodes, and these processes depend upon the morphology of the active layer and charge mobilities. A well-defined morphology and phase separation between the donor and acceptor components in the active layer within the range of exciton diffusion lengths (∼15–20 nm) are necessary for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.26 As reported in the literature, the morphology of the active layer can be controlled by appropriate treatment of the active layer, i.e., thermal annealing,27 solvent annealing28 and solvent additives,29 for both polymer and small-molecule solar cells. The solvent additive method has recently been adopted to improve the performance of organic solar cells based on porphyrins as donors. In order to increase the PCE of our devices, we employed a solvent additive treatment method using a small amount of pyridine as a solvent additive, as it is known to be more effective than other solvent additives in the case of porphyrin-based solar cells.30 We varied the concentration of pyridine in the THF host solvent from 0.5 v% to 3.5 v% and found that 3 v% gives the best result. The J–V characteristics under illumination and the IPCE spectra of devices processed with a pyridine solvent additive are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The PCE values of the devices with solvent additives were significantly increased from 2.75% to 5.27% (Jsc = 10.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.54) and from 3.18% to 5.78% (Jsc = 11.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.58) for 1a and 1b, respectively. The increase in Jsc is consistent with the IPCE spectra of the devices processed with the solvent additive, i.e., the IPCE values are higher throughout the whole wavelength region. The calculated values of Jsc from the IPCE spectra were about 10.48 mA cm−2 and 11.43 mA cm−2 for devices based on 1a and 1b, respectively, which are in good agreement, within experimental error, with the values observed from the J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination.
The PCE of BHJ organic solar cells, as well as the Jsc, is directly related to the light-harvesting efficiency of the active layer; therefore, in order to obtain information about the influence of a pyridine additive on the change in the light-harvesting efficiency of the devices, we recorded the UV-visible absorption spectra of the active layers with and without a pyridine additive, which are shown in Fig. 6 for 1b:PC71BM (1:2) thin films only. Similar results were observed for 1a:PC71BM (1:2) thin films. Compared with the film cast from THF, the film cast from pyridine/THF displays a wide absorption and high absorption coefficient, particularly for the absorption bands corresponding to porphyrin, which is related to the enhanced π–π stacking. Therefore, we believe that the light-harvesting efficiency was improved with the pyridine additive, which may be one of the reasons for the increase in Jsc.

The crystallinity of the active layer plays an important role in charge transport and collection, thereby affecting the overall PCE of an organic bulk heterojunction. The XRD patterns of pristine 1a and 1b are displayed in Fig. 7a and show significant (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7.26° and 7.32°, respectively, resulting in d-spacings of 1.52 nm and 1.48 nm for 1a and 1b, respectively. To obtain information about the change in the crystallinity of thin films with a porphyrin:PC71BM active layer on the addition of pyridine solvent to CB prior to spin-casting, we recorded the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of thin films spin-cast from THF and pyridine/THF solutions. Blends of 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM cast from THF display similar diffraction peaks with low intensity (as shown in Fig. 7b for 1b:PC71BM), which suggests effective mixing of PC71BM and porphyrin. However, this diffraction peak becomes more intense for the corresponding blend cast from pyridine/THF solvent, whereas the width at half maximum height is decreased. These results show that the blended film cast from THF solvent has low crystallinity, whereas in the case of the blended film cast from pyridine/THF solvent the crystallinity and π-conjugation of porphyrin in the blended film increased. This is probably due to the difference in boiling point between THF and pyridine, which makes the film dry slowly, assisting the formation of a better self-ordered structure of the blend. The increase in crystallinity leads to an enhancement in the light-harvesting properties of the active layer and higher hole mobility in the blended thin film, leading to increases in Jsc and FF.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the change in the surface morphology of the active layer induced by the pyridine solvent additive. AFM scans were carried out for blended films spin-coated onto an ITO-coated substrate using the same fabrication conditions for device fabrication. Fig. 8 shows AFM images of 1b:PC71BM cast with and without solvent additives and the corresponding root mean square (rms) roughnesses are 0.98 nm and 1.82 nm for the films cast from THF and pyridine/THF solutions, respectively. The blend cast from THF appears relatively flat with poor phase separation, which is not favorable for charge transfer from porphyrin to PC71BM and thus limits the PCE of the resulting device. However, the film spin-coated from pyridine/THF displayed more aggregated domains and phase-separated domains with a larger rms surface roughness. The aggregated domains may originate from enhanced intermolecular interactions of porphyrin during film formation.31 Greater surface roughness is expected to increase internal light scattering and enhance the absorption of light.32 The blended film with a larger domain size suggests good phase separation and well-connected domains, which allow efficient charge generation and charge transfer within the active layer.

The charge carrier mobility in the BHJ active layer is crucial for the overall PCE of an organic solar cell, because the extraction of photogenerated charge carriers by the electrodes depends on competition with carrier sweep-out, which is limited by the mobility of the charge carriers and their loss by recombination.33 In order to obtain information about the influence of the pyridine additive on the charge carrier mobilities, we measured the hole mobilities using the J–V characteristics of hole-only devices (Fig. 4). By fitting the experimental results with the SCLC model (solid lines), the hole mobilities were found to be 3.14 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.35 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM, respectively, processed with the pyridine additive. In a similar manner, we also estimated the electron mobilities for the blends processed with and without the pyridine additive, which were found to be in the range of 2.36–2.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The increase in the hole mobility and the fact that the electron mobility is almost the same with solvent additive treatment result in more balanced charge transport in the devices compared with that in the counterpart devices processed without the additive and increase the FF and Jsc values, leading to a higher PCE value.
We further investigated the influence of the pyridine additive on the photogeneration of charge carriers in organic solar cells based on 1a and 1b donors by investigating the variation in the photocurrent (Jph) with the effective voltage (Veff). The value of Jph is estimated as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively.34 The value of Veff is determined as Veff = Vo − V, where Vo is the voltage at which the value of Jph is zero.35 Therefore, the value of Veff corresponds to the strength of the electric field within the device for extracting charge carriers. The variation in the value of Jph with that of Veff is shown in Fig. 9. A log–log plot of Jphversus Veff exhibits two distinct regions, i.e., a linear and a saturation region. As observed in Fig. 9, devices based on an active layer processed without the pyridine additive displayed no clear saturation in Jph with an increase in Veff, which indicates that the internal electric field is not sufficient for charge extraction and the saturation region is field-dependent. However, devices processed with the pyridine additive exhibited a clear saturation region in curves of Jph–Veff, which indicates field-independent saturation leading to efficient charge extraction and collection. Therefore, at full saturation we assume that all the excitons generated after the absorption of photons in the active layer are dissociated into free electrons and holes and subsequently collected by the respective electrodes. We estimated the maximum generation rate of free charge carriers (Gmax) using Jphsat = qGmaxL, where Jphsat is the photocurrent density at the full saturation point in Fig. 9, q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The estimated values of Gmax for devices based on 1a:PC71BM (THF cast), 1b:PC71BM (THF cast), 1a:PC71BM (pyridine/THF cast) and 1b:PC71BM (pyridine/THF cast) are 1.50 × 1028 m3 s−1, 1.64 × 1028 m3 s−1, 2.13 × 1028 m3 s−1 and 2.34 × 1028 m3 s−1, respectively. The trends observed in Gmax with different devices are consistent with the increase in Jsc as well as the UV-visible absorption coefficient, which indicates the more efficient generation of excitons and their dissociation in the active layer processed with the pyridine solvent additive. The probability of charge collection (Pc) of the present solar cells was estimated accordingly by Pc = Jsc/Jphsat and found to be 0.62, 0.64, 0.74 and 0.78 for 1a:PC71BM (THF cast), 1b:PC71BM (THF cast), 1a:PC71BM (pyridine/THF cast) and 1b:PC71BM (pyridine/THF cast), respectively. The greater value of Pc for the devices processed with the pyridine additive compared with that without the pyridine additive is attributed to better phase separation in the active layer, increased hole mobility and improved balance in charge transport.

We measured the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) from the slopes of the J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination around Voc and Jsc, respectively, and these are summarized in Table 2. In an organic BHJ solar cell, Rs is composed of the bulk resistance of the active layer, which depends upon the charge transport ability within the active layer and the morphology of the active layer. It can be seen from Table 2 that the Rs values of the devices processed from pyridine/THF are significantly lower than those of the devices processed with THF, which can be attributed to their better morphology and balanced charge transport.36 The increase in Rsh is related to a decrease in leakage current and depends on the intermolecular interaction (or electronic coupling) between the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer.
We have investigated CuSCN as an HTL in an attempt to increase the PCE of our devices. Because both 1a and 1b possess HOMO energy levels between −5.42 and −5.30 eV, there is an energy mismatch with the HOMO energy level of PEDOT:PSS (−5.0 to 5.1 eV), which forms a barrier to hole extraction; therefore, there is the possibility to increase the PCE of our present devices. As the active layer, we used film cast from pyridine/CB for investigation. The device fabrication is similar to that described in the Experimental section except for the HTL. The J–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 10. Devices based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM exhibited PCEs of 6.59% (Jsc = 10.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.99 V and FF = 0.62) and 7.24% (Jsc = 11.67 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.94 V and FF = 0.66), respectively, which are higher than that of a PEDOT:PSS HTL. The Jsc values are almost similar to that of a PEDOT:PSS HTL, because both PEDOT:PSS and CuSCN have similar transparency in the visible and NIR regions of the solar spectrum. On replacing PEDOT:PSS with CuSCN, the FF increased from 0.54 to 0.62 and from 0.58 to 0.66 for devices based on 1a and 1b, respectively, which may be related to the better formation of ohmic contact between the active layer and CuSCN, owing to the work function of CuSCN being deeper than that of PEDOT:PSS. The increase in Voc with respect to PEDOT:PSS could be explained by a better alignment between the HOMO level of the porphyrin donor and the valence band edge of CuSCN (−5.35 eV) at the active layer/HTL interface, which acts as a good electron-blocking layer.

J–V characteristics of devices using CuSCN as a hole transport layer for active layers processed with pyridine/THF solutions. 
The HTL used in an organic BHJ solar cell should have the ability to limit the passage of dark-injected minority carriers in reverse bias from the anode to the cathode through the active layer. To obtain information about this, we measured the dark J–V characteristics of devices based on a 1b:PC71BM active layer (Fig. 11). It can be seen from this figure that the current density at 0.47 V in reverse bias for PEDOT:PSS and CuSCN HTLs is 0.0012 mA cm−2 and 0.00016 mA cm−2, respectively, and the rectification ratio is higher for CuSCN compared with PEDOT:PSS, which indicates that CuSCN suppresses the injection of minority charge carriers into the active layer, thus reducing the recombination process. Moreover, by fitting the experimental J–V characteristics in the dark with the Mott–Gurney relationship, we estimated that the value of Vbi for CuSCN is 0.098 V higher than that for PEDOT:PSS. The shunt resistance was also higher for CuSCN compared with PEDOT:PSS. The above features have a synergetic effect on the ability to collect holes and eventually increase the Voc, FF and PCE.

We also estimated the Pc values for these devices using the variation in Jph with Veff (Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 12, the value of Jph tends to become saturated at lower values of Veff compared with the counterpart devices based on PEDOT:PSS. The values of Pc for the devices based on 1a and 1b are about 0.85 and 0.88, respectively. These values are higher than those for devices based on PEDOT:PSS, which indicates that by employing CuSCN better ohmic contact is formed and holes are extracted more efficiently, leading to a suppression of charge recombination and an increase in FF. As Veff corresponds to the internal voltage for extracting the charge carriers, with CuSCN a low internal voltage is needed to sweep out the charge carriers.

Moreover, the values of Rs and Rsh decreased and increased, respectively, for the CuSCN HTL relative to the values for PEDOT:PSS, which was also indicative of reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction.
Conclusions
In this study, we report the synthesis and optical and electrochemical properties of two new conjugated acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor (A–π–D–π–A) small molecules with a zinc porphyrin donor core and 3-ethylrhodanine terminal acceptors connected at the meso positions by ethynylene groups and linked by one (1a) or two (1b) thienylenevinylene units. The optical and electrochemical properties of these two porphyrins suggest that blended films of these compounds with PC71BM can effectively harvest photons from the visible to the NIR region of the solar spectrum and transfer electrons from the porphyrins to PC71BM, resulting in a photovoltaic response. BHJ solar cells based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM processed from THF displayed PCEs of 2.75% and 3.18%, respectively. In order to increase the PCE further, we spin-cast the active layers from pyridine/CB solvent and found that the overall PCE was significantly increased to 5.27% and 5.78% for devices based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM, respectively, as a result of higher values of Jsc and FF, which are related to the generation of excitons and their separation into free charge carriers and the mobility and charge transport, which are found to be improved by the morphology/crystallinity of the active layer induced by a pyridine solvent additive. Moreover, the PCE was increased further to 6.59% and 7.24% for active layers based on 1a:PC71BM and 1b:PC71BM processed with pyridine/THF solution by employing a CuSCN HTL. The increase in the PCE is due to the suppression of the injection of minority carriers (electrons) from the anode and an increase in Vbi relative to devices based on PEDOT:PSS. Moreover, the low internal electric field is sufficient to sweep out the charge carriers and reduce recombination.

Device fabrication and characterization
The BHJ organic solar cells were fabricated using the device architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1a or 1b:PC71BM with different weight ratios/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO)-patterned substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in aqueous detergent, deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, and acetone sequentially and finally dried under ambient conditions. The anode consisted of glass substrates percolated with ITO, modified by spin-coating with a PEDOT:PSS layer (40 nm) as a hole transport layer and heated for 10 min at 100 °C. Mixtures of 1a or 1b with PC71BM (total concentration of 12 mg mL−1) with weight ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:2.5 in THF were prepared and then spin-cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer and dried overnight in an ambient atmosphere. For the blend of 1a or 1b:PC71BM processed with 3% v/v pyridine in a THF solvent mixture, only the mixture with a 1:2 weight ratio was used. The approximate thickness of the active layers was 90 nm. Finally, the aluminum (Al) top electrode was thermally deposited on the active layer in a vacuum of 10−5 Torr through a shadow mask area of 0.20 cm2. All devices were fabricated and tested in an ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. The hole-only and electron-only devices with architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer/Al were also fabricated in a similar way in order to measure the hole and electron mobility, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark and under simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to provide stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the devices through the light source and a monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short-circuit conditions.
For devices based on a CuSCN HTL, a thin film of the CuSCN (30 nm) layer was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 60 seconds using diisopropyl sulphide as the solvent and annealed at 110 °C for 20 minutes, and then the active layer was deposited as described above.
