    , Accepted 28th January 2014First published on 28th January 2014AbstractThe direct generation of electrical energy from sunlight and a biomass solution with use of a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell (PEBFC) was investigated. The PEBFC was constructed from dendrimer-encapsulated CdSe nanoparticles-sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2/CdSe-DENs) as the photoanode, along with dendrimer-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (Pt-DENs) as the cathode and the proton exchange membrane (PEM). The morphology of the TiO2/CdSe-DENs and Pt-DENs on carbon paper was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the effects of the TiO2/CdSe-DENs deposited on the carbon paper and the glucose concentration in the electrolyte on the photoelectrochemical responses were studied through photoelectrochemical measurements. Based on the optimal conditions, an open circuit voltage of 0.5 V and a maximum power density of 40 μW cm−2 could be obtained under light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) from the CdSe-DENs sensitized PEBFCs, indicating that the CdSe-DENs are efficient photosensitizers for PEBFCs.
1. Introduction
The rapid consumption of global nonrenewable energy resources has caused great attention to be paid towards various devices of energy conversion in both academic and industrial research. Among the devices, a new type of photoelectrochemical biofuel cell (PEBFC) has been extensively reported, which can convert light and chemical energy into electrical energy by combining a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with an enzyme-catalyzed biofuel cell (BFC).1 This new cell uses the same dye-sensitized photoanode and cathode, but the electrolyte is different from that of the DSSC.1–3 For the DSSC, the applicable sensitizer of the photoanode is a key factor which greatly influences its performance. So far, apart from porphyrin-based and ruthenium polypyridyl-based sensitizers, inorganic semiconducting materials have been one of the most promising sensitizers for solar cells.4–8 Inorganic semiconductors are robust, have tunable effective band gaps and are easy to process, hence, they are ideal candidates for the optimization of a solar cell to achieve maximum efficiency.
Recently, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), such as CdSe with its tunable band edge, provide new opportunities for harvesting light energy in the visible region of the solar spectrum.9–11 Especially, efficient charge separation could be achieved in a semiconductor particulate system involving two semiconductor particles with different energy levels.7,9,12 For instance, the mixed semiconductor system of CdS–TiO2 has been proved to achieve an improved charge separation and increase the selectivity and efficiency of the reduction of the adsorbed substrate.9,12–14 Tremendous efforts have been made to study the photoelectrochemical properties of coupled semiconductor systems and a few efforts have been done to explore the photoelectrochemical properties of the coupled semiconductor system of CdSe–TiO2; however, as far as we know, almost no previous studies have applied CdSe–TiO2 in a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell for electricity generation. In addition, most of the CdSe–TiO2 hybrid semiconductors are usually prepared by depositing CdSe on TiO2 through electrochemical deposition or chemical vapor deposition methods, which seem to be a little sophisticated.15–18
In this work, we synthesized a dendrimer-encapsulated CdSe nanoparticles (CdSe-DENs) sensitized TiO2 hybrid semiconductor (TiO2/CdSe-DENs) via a mild, green and simple two-step procedure in the liquid phase using poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as a space-confined template for the first time. Meanwhile, we investigated the photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2/CdSe-DENs and studied the effects of TiO2/CdSe-DENs deposition on carbon paper and the glucose concentration in electrolyte on the photoelectrochemical response. Moreover, we have applied the TiO2/CdSe-DENs in a PEBFC as the photoanode for electricity generation.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Fourth-generation poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with amine terminal groups (G4-NH2) and dendrimer-encapsulated platinum nanoparticles (Pt-DENS) were synthesized according to the literature.19–21 CdNO3, Se powder, glucose oxidase (GOx) and glucose were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Nafion membrane was obtained from DuPont and was used as the proton exchange membrane in this work, which is referred to as Nafion. TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained from Degussa (P-25 TiO2). Toray carbon paper with a thickness of 110 μm was purchased from Toray Industries Inc. (Japan). All chemicals in the experiment were of analytical grade. Doubly distilled and deionized water were used throughout the experiment. Phosphate buffer was used for enzyme immobilization and electrochemical measurements.
2.2 Preparation of TiO2/CdSe-DENs nanocomposites
TiO2 nanoparticles were treated with the silane coupling agent KH-570. CdSe-DENs were prepared by a green and simple two-step procedure, which is similar to that reported previously.22,23 Firstly, the G4-dendrimer (PAMAM) was mixed with an aqueous CdNO3 solution and stirred for 36 h under a nitrogen atmosphere until the complexation was complete, then an aqueous TiO2 solution was added to the PAMAM–Cd2+ solution with continuous stirring for more than 30 min. The Michael addition reaction was employed to linked the PAMAM–NH2 to the acrylic group on the TiO2 surface. Secondly, KBH4 and Se were dissolved in deionized water and stirred for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere until dissolution was complete. Then, the obtained selenium solution was added to the mixture with continuous stirring for more than 1 h, followed by dialysis with a dialysis membrane (using a MW CO 12000–14000 Dalton dialysis tube from Medicell International) for 4 h against doubly distilled water at room temperature to obtain the TiO2–CdSe-DENs solution.
2.3 Membrane electrode assembly fabrication
As illustrated in Fig. 1, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was made in a style similar to that reported by Kamat and Seger.24 Toray carbon paper (4.5 cm × 4.5 cm) was used to anchor the photo-catalyst nanoparticles on the anode and Pt-DENs on the cathode. The suspension of TiO2/CdSe-DENs was stirred for at least 30 min before the mixture was used for preparing the catalyst films. Electrodes with desired TiO2/CdSe-DENs loadings were prepared by drop-casting the solution onto 110 μm Toray carbon paper electrodes. Nafion membranes were preconditioned in accordance with the previously established procedure.19 The Nafion membrane was boiled in 3% hydrogen peroxide and then in alternating baths of boiling water and 1 M H2SO4. The anode carbon paper and cathode carbon paper were positioned on the opposite sides of the pretreated Nafion membrane and hot-pressed at 0.5 MPa and 140 °C for 3 min to obtain the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).

2.4 Photoelectrochemical biofuel cells

Fig. 2 shows (A) the schematic diagram and (B) the laboratory-scale quantum dot-sensitized enzyme-based PEBFC. As shown in Fig. 2, the pressed MEA was then inserted into two graphite plates, which give a ledge to attach alligator clips for making the electrical contacts. The cathode faced a side with four holes while the anode side faced an open chamber with a quartz window. Two plexiglass baffles were used to sandwich the two graphite blocks. On the anode side of the plexiglass baffle a hole was cut out of the middle which allowed a 12.25 cm2 exposure of the photo-catalyst surface to the light, while on the cathode side there were four holes for exposure to air. Four screws were tightened to hold the biofuel cell reactor together. A 150 W high-pressure xenon lamp with a cut-off glass filter transmitting at λ > 400 nm (placed 10 cm away from the PEBFC) was used as the light source. The illumination intensity was about 50 mW cm−2. On the anode side the nitrogen-purged solution containing different concentrations of glucose was pushed into the cell compartment through the top of the graphite plate.

2.5 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Half-cell experiments were carried out in a three-arm electrochemical cell using a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation, purchased from Shanghai Chen Hua Instrument Inc. (China). For the three-electrode experiments, a KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode were used in all cases. The three-electrode electrochemical measurements were performed in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 0.1 M, and pH 6.8) at room temperature. A 150 W high-pressure xenon lamp with a cut-off glass filter transmitting λ > 400 nm was used as the light source. The intensity of the illumination near the surface of the electrode was about 50 mW cm−2. The voltage and current outputs generated by the biofuel cells were measured by using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter made by Keithley Instruments Inc. (USA). The photoactive area of the proton exchange membrane-based reactor was 12.25 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optical properties of the CdSe-DENs

Fig. 3 shows the absorption and emission spectra of the CdSe-DENs in water. The particles exhibit transitions in the visible range with a sharp band edge absorption at 500 nm (∼2.48 eV). The CdSe-DENs also exhibit a band edge emission at 620 nm (∼2.00 eV), showing a very large Stokes shift. From the HRTEM image shown in Fig. 4, the obtained particle diameter is about 5 nm. The TiO2 particles employed in our studies are large band gap semiconductors, which absorb UV light with an onset at 370 nm (∼3.35 eV). They have diameters between 30 and 40 nm. The large corresponding surface area enables many smaller CdSe-DENs to be linked to TiO2 particles, facilitating interparticle electron transfer. The lower-lying conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) as compared to CdSe (≤−1.0 V vs. NHE) minimizes charge recombination and also rectifies any charge transport.25

3.2 Operation principle of the photo-electrolysis enzymatic biofuel cells
In photoelectrochemical enzymatic biofuel cells designed on the basis of a QDs-sensitized reactor (Fig. 5), the substrate is oxidized at the light-irradiated TiO2/CdSe-DENs photo-catalyst, and the electrons generated at the photoanode travel through an external circuit to a Pt-DENs cathode. A quartz window enables the direct excitation of the photo-catalyst in the anode compartment. Light irradiation of the anode compartment improved the overall performance of the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell as glucose was oxidized by both the photo-catalyst and GOx. Holes are scavenged by glucose, ultimately decomposing into gluconolactone and protons. The protons are transported through the Nafion membrane and reduced at the cathode to form water (eqn (1) and (2)). The membrane and electrodes are assembled in the same manner as in a fuel cell with a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), separating the two graphite plates. Since the two electrodes are in close proximity, the electrolyte resistance is expected to be minimal. (1) O2 + 4e− + 4H+ → 2H2O(2)

3.3 Characterization of electrode surface
The TiO2/CdSe-DENs photo-catalyst and Pt-DENs electrocatalyst were deposited separately on Toray carbon paper and then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Toray carbon consists of carbon macro-fibers of 5–7 μm in diameter. The network of these fibers serves a dual-purpose: (i) to serve as a scaffold to anchor catalyst particles and (ii) to collect and transport electrons to and from the electrode surface. Fig. 6 shows the network of carbon macro-fibers supporting the electrocatalyst Pt-DENs (A) and photo-catalyst TiO2/CdSe-DENs (B), respectively. Since the Pt-DENs have a relatively low loading (0.3 mg cm−2 Pt) compared to the TiO2/CdSe-DENS loading (3.5 mg cm−2), we observed different particle densities between the photo-anode and cathode electrodes. Note that the low Pt content in the cathode corresponds to the typical loading employed in a fuel cell.24 A fairly uniform dispersion of nanoparticles was attained on the electrode surface, providing a large surface area to facilitate heterogeneous electron transfer processes. The uniform dispersion also maximizes the mass transfer of reactants and products to and from the catalyst surface.

3.3 Photo-electrochemical behavior of the TiO2/CdSe-DENs photoelectrodes
The carbon paper coated with TiO2/CdSe-DENs was characterized in a half-cell reaction. Based on the principle of sensitizing large band gaps with smaller band gap semiconductors, we employed CdSe-DENs as the sensitizers to extend the photoresponse of TiO2 into the visible region. Excitation of TiO2/CdSe-DENs with light (λ > 400 nm) causes electron–hole separation. While a fraction of these charges undergo recombination, the rest can induce a redox reaction at the surface. In the present experiment, photo-generated holes are cleaned by glucose while the electrons are collected by carbon fibers and transported to the cathode through an external circuit (Fig. 5). In addition, the current doubling effect of glucose has an added advantage as the gluconolactone formed during the oxidation process can also donate electrons to the anode (eqn (3)–(6)). CdSe + hν → CdSe(e + h)(3) CdSe(e) + TiO2 → TiO2(e)(4) (5) O2 + 4e− + 4H+ → 2H2O(6)

Fig. 7 shows the short-circuit photocurrent response (after subtraction of the dark current) of the electrode prepared with 3.0 mg cm−2 TiO2/CdSe-DENs and pure TiO2 loaded on Toray carbon paper at 0.3 M glucose in 0.1 M PBS. Upon visible light illumination (λ > 400 nm), the TiO2/CdSe-DENs photoelectrode shows a prompt rise in photocurrent (ca. 125 mA cm−2), but TiO2 shows no photocurrent.

3.4 Photoelectrochemical biofuel cell polarization curves
An enzyme-based PEBFC constructed with TiO2/CdSe-DENs (3.0 mg cm−2) loaded on Toray carbon paper (110 μm thick) as an anode and Pt-DENs (0.3 mg cm−2) particles dispersed on Toray carbon paper as a cathode was applied to evaluate the power characteristics. The Nafion membrane separated the two electrode compartments. The solution in the anode and cathode compartments was flown through external pumps. A variable resistor was introduced in the circuit so that the current–voltage features at different loadings could be recorded. Fig. 8 shows the polarization and power density curves of the CdSe-DENs sensitized enzyme-based biofuel cells at different glucose concentrations in the anode compartment. The glucose concentration was varied (0.1 M, Fig. 8A; 0.2 M, Fig. 8B and 0.3 M, Fig. 8C) only in the anode compartment. The short circuit photocurrent and open circuit voltage of the CdSe-DENs sensitized enzyme-based PEBFC under visible-light irradiation was measured at different glucose concentrations in the anode compartment. As can be seen from the dependence of the maximum photocurrent on the glucose concentrations in Fig. 8, the polarization curves approach a maximum (40 μW cm−2) around 0.3 M glucose. Apparently, the maximum power density and current density decreased for lower concentrations of glucose. Therefore, the electrochemical response of the TiO2/CdSe-DENs electrode was closely related to glucose oxidation. In addition, the TiO2/CdSe-DENs PEBFC without GOx also shows a lower polarization curve around 0.3 M glucose. The lower open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current demonstrated that GOx can promote an electrochemical response. In addition, we found the optimized electrochemical performance under a GOx concentration of ca. 0.5 U mL−1 in this system. Both the prepared TiO2/CdSe-DENs photoanode and PEBFC exhibit stable performances and excellent repeatability. The power density and current density exhibited no obvious decrease in the same concentration of glucose after 24 h. The short-circuit current in this work is higher and more stable than previously published.2

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel polymer membrane electrode assembly (MEA) consisting of a TiO2/CdSe-DENs photoanode, a Pt-DENS cathode, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) was constructed to realize a CdSe-DENs sensitized enzyme-based PEBFC. In such a cell, there is a short distance between the two electrodes, which minimizes the electrolyte resistance and any current loss associated with it. The cell exhibited good performance (40 μW cm−2) while operated under physiological condition, which may be ascribed to the enhancement of the electron transfer rate between the redox center in the enzyme and the electrode surfaces. The strategy presented here demonstrates the successful construction of an enzyme-based photoelectrochemical biofuel cell with quantum dots as the photo-catalysts. In addition, the novel TiO2–CdSe-DENs hybrid system could also by extended to applications in other biochemical fields.
