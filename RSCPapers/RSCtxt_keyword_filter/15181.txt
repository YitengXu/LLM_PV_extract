    , Accepted 15th August 2022First published on 16th August 2022AbstractA new series of cyclopentadithiophene (CDT)-based quinoidal semiconductors—CDTSQ-8 (1), CDTSQ-10 (2), CDTSQ-12 (3), and CDTSQ-14 (4)—with various dithioalkylated-methylidenyl side chains were designed and synthesized as n-type organic small molecules for solution-processable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The physical, electrochemical, and electrical properties of these new compounds were thoroughly investigated. Further, single-crystal structures of CDTSQ-10, CDTSQ-12, and CDTSQ-14 were obtained. Optimized geometries obtained from single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed the planarity of the central core. The smaller dihedral angle between dithioalkyl methylene and the CDT core (4.8°), a planar molecular structure, short main-core stacking distance (3.43 Å), short intramolecular (S⋯H), and intermolecular (S⋯N, N⋯H, and N⋯N) distances of the CDTSQ-12 molecule suggest good conditions for the extended π-orbital interaction of the corresponding molecule, resulting in better device performance. The favorable molecular packing and low-lying LUMO energy level (−4.10 eV) suggest that CDTSQs could be electron-transporting semiconductors. Thin-film morphological analysis by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering revealed that all CDTSQ molecules are stacked on the substrate in an edge-on fashion. OFETs based on solution-sheared CDTSQ-12 exhibited the highest electron mobility of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 with good ambient stability. The electron mobility of solution-processable CDTSQ is 14 times larger than that of a previously reported dilakylated-CDT-based CDTRQ (0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1, vacuum-processed) quinoidal derivative. These results demonstrate that side-chain engineering can improve the device performance of solution-sheared CDTSQ organic semiconductors.
Introduction
Design and synthesis of solution-processable π-conjugated organic semiconductors (OSCs) for various optoelectronic devices is one of the most active research fields and has attracted considerable attention for application in memory devices, smart cards, radio-frequency identification tags, transparent circuits, electronic papers, flexible displays, and sensors.1–12 The design rule of these OSCs comprises a planar conjugated building block with suitable solubilizing alkyl side chains. The intermolecular/intramolecular interactions, molecular packing, and device performances can be significantly affected by the modifications of these alkyl side chains.13–15 From a molecular design standpoint, the development of donor–acceptor (D–A)-type OSCs with a conjugated backbone has greatly advanced OFET technology,16 resulting in several high-performance p-type (hole-transporting)13,17–21 and n-type (electron-transporting) OSC families.22–30 Despite considerable progress, the performance of n-type semiconductors continues to lag behind that of p-type semiconductors because of the critical requirements for lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and environmental trapping of electrons.31–35 Hence, developing high-performance and ambiently stable n-type OSCs for OFETs is highly desirable.28,36–40 In addition, aromatic frameworks with conjugated cores functionalized with electron-withdrawing substituents are suitable building blocks for electron transport.41–43 Among different OSC structural variations, dicyanomethylene (DCN)-substituted quinoidal oligothiophenes are excellent n-type semiconductors because of their high electron affinity originating from the quinoidal structure terminated by two strongly electron-withdrawing groups, affording low-lying LUMO energy levels.44–46 The presence of a π-conjugated quinoidal core is known to strongly modulate the electronic structure.22,47 The most prominent examples include electron-poor building blocks such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),48 naphthalene diimide (NDI),49–51 perylene carboxy diimide (PDI),52 and other oligo/fused thiophene-based53 cores optionally functionalized with electron-withdrawing functionalities such as perfluorophenyls,54 cyanos,55 and alkyl cyanoacetates.56
A fused-ring cyclopentadithiophene (CDT) derivative has attracted significant attention in the designing of small molecules and donor–acceptor polymers. This is due to its efficient electron-donating nature, facile synthesis from commercially available reagents, and simple side-chain manipulation for solubility.57–59 For instance, Langa and coworkers reported a CDT-based A–D–A-type organic solar cell FG4 (Fig. S1, ESI†) that exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.43%.60 Further, Bo and coworkers reported a CDT-based conjugated organic solar cell NOC6F-1 (Fig. S1, ESI†) exhibiting a superior PCE of 10.62%.61 Yang and coworkers reported an organic solar cell such as 2EH-CPDT(FBTTh2)2 (Fig. S1, ESI†) with the highest PCE of 3.2%.62 On the polymer front, Bao and coworkers synthesized a BDTup-CPDT (Fig. S1, ESI†) polymer and demonstrated OFETs with a hole mobility of 0.044 cm2 V−1 s−1.63 Mullen and coworkers reported a CDT-BTz polymer58 (Fig. S1, ESI†), which exhibited a field-effect mobility of 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Watson and coworkers reported a donor–acceptor copolymer semiconductor P7 (Fig. S1, ESI†) based on an NDI acceptor with a CDT unit and used in n-channel OFETs, which exhibited an electron mobility of 0.006 cm2 V−1 s−1.50 Furthermore, Wu and coworkers reported a dye-sensitized solar cell CPD164 (Fig. S1, ESI†) comprising a CDT unit with N-annulated perylene exhibiting a PCE of 7.8%. In addition, Sun and coworkers reported hole-transporting materials LYC-1 and LYC-265 (Fig. S1, ESI†) based on 4,4′-dimethoxy triphenylamine-substituted CDT and utilized in perovskite solar cells exhibiting a PCE of 19.07% and 17.60%, respectively.
Moreover, side chains significantly influence solution processability, intermolecular packing, and resulting film morphology. The solubilizing side chains attached to the conjugated backbone often disrupt the intermolecular ordering; thus, careful attention should be paid while designing them. The sp2-hybridized side chains can be used to judiciously achieve material solubility with extended molecular planarity and crystalline packing interactions.66 For example, a CC double bond containing side chains was introduced at the 4-position of CDT to yield dithioalkylated-methylidenyl-CDT, permitting the alkyl chains to adopt a coplanar conformation and facilitate the small molecular backbone forming a close packing in the solid state to enhance charge carrier transportation.67 Therefore, several research groups have developed dithioalkylated-methylidenyl-CDT-based small molecules and polymers. For instance, Woo and coworkers reported a dithioalkylated-methylidenyl-CDT-based semicrystalline p-type thermoelectric (TE) conjugated polymers PCPDTSBT68 and PCPDTSBT-A69 with the best power factor (PF) of 7.73 μW m−1 K−2 and 40.4 μW m−1 K−2 respectively (Fig. S2a, ESI†). Next, Woo and coworkers reported 4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b]-dithiophene (IDT)-based acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type OFETs such as IDSIC-4F66 (Fig. S2b, ESI†) exhibits good hole and electron mobilities of 0.092 and 0.897 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, similar IDT-based (A–D–A-type) OFETs such as SEHIC67 (Fig. S2b, ESI†) reported by Noh and coworkers exhibited hole and electron mobilities of 0.148 and 0.023 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S2b, ESI†). In addition, Zhang and coworkers synthesized a donor–acceptor copolymer PAFDTBT70 (Fig. S2c, ESI†) with a PCE of 6.2%. Furthermore, McCulloch and coworkers reported polymer C10PAF71 (Fig. S2c, ESI†) with an enhanced field-effect mobility of 0.002 cm2 V−1 s−1.
To date, different classes of conjugated materials exhibiting n-channel and ambipolar semiconducting properties72,73 have been reported in the literature. In particular, fused planar aromatic structures are also known to enhance π–π stacking and hence induce high molecular ordering, which may lead to improved OFET performance with a simultaneous increase in charge transport properties.74 Thus, several groups have addressed aromatic systems in a dicyanomethylene-substituted quinoidal structure affording organic n-channel semiconductors with electron mobilities.15,26 For instance, Kunugi and coworkers reported a solution-deposited film of oligothiophene, DCMT,75 (Fig. S3, ESI†) with a high electron mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1. Recently, our group has fabricated solution-processable n-type organic semiconductors such as TSBTQ27 (Fig. S3, ESI†) and DTTQ,44 (Fig. S3, ESI†) exhibiting electron mobilities of 0.45 and 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Moreover, Li and coworkers synthesized CDT-2T(CN)4, (Fig. S3, ESI†) a n-type organic semiconductor that shows an electron mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1.76 Similarly, Wurthner and coworkers reported a vacuum-processed CDT-based n-type organic semiconductor; CPTQ-Oc,77 (Fig. S3, ESI†) (named CDTRQ in this paper) which showed an electron mobility of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. Marder and coworkers reported the synthesis, characterization, and charge transport properties of DSP (Fig. S3, ESI†) derivatives with an electron mobility of 0.00087 cm2 V−1 s−1 in spin-cast layers.78 Furthermore, Marks and coworkers were the pioneers of oligothiophenes end-capped with the fluoroalkyl/perfluorophenyl group as n-type semiconductors. They fabricated a DFHCO-4T-based (Fig. S4, ESI†) OFET device and optimized it to achieve an excellent electron mobility of up to 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1. Later, the same research group explored fused oliogothiophenes end-capped with perfluorophenyl as n-type materials for OFETs and achieved an electron mobility up to 0.3–0.43 cm2 V−1 s−153,79,80 (Fig. S4, ESI†).
In this study, we incorporated various dithioalkylated-methylidenyl side chains on the 4-position of the CDT unit. A dithioalkylated-methylidenyl-CDT unit has a sp2-hybridized carbon atom at 4-position of CDT unit. Compared with dialkylated CDT,77 the dithioalkylated methylidenyl-CDT backbone exhibits improved planarity and thus enhanced π–π stacking and S⋯S intermolecular interactions (see Fig. 1 for schematic illustration).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of incorporating dithioalkylated methylidenyl side chain at the 4-position of CDT unit to improve the backbone planarity. 
Inspired by these findings, we synthesized dithioalkylated methylidenyl-CDT central core-based quinoidal semiconductors, namely, CDTSQ-8 (1), CDTSQ-10 (2), CDTSQ-12 (3), and CDTSQ-14 (4). Dithioalkylated methylidenyl side chains containing CDTSQs show excellent solubility in common organic solvents, which is beneficial for solution processability. To the best of our knowledge, dithioalkylated methylidenyl-CDT-based quinoidal semiconductors have never been reported. Furthermore, the physical, electrochemical, and electrical properties of CDTSQs (1–4) were thoroughly investigated. Single-crystal structures of CDTSQ-10 (2), CDTSQ-12 (3), and CDTSQ-14 (4) were obtained to gain further insight into their molecular packing pattern and charge transport properties. Incidentally, crystal structures of dithioalkylated methylidenyl-CDT central backbone or corresponding organic semiconductors have never been reported. Next, semiconductor film deposition optimization was realized by semiconductor processing using solution-shearing methods versus conventional spin-coating. Thus, OFET performance and thin-film morphology were investigated as a function of processing methods demonstrating the superiority of shearing in enhancing molecular order and carrier mobility. In particular, among quinoidal series, CDTSQ-12 exhibits the highest OFET electron mobility of 0.14 cm−2 V−1 s−1, which is comparatively higher than that of dialkylated-CDT-unit-based organic semiconductors such as CDT-2T(CN)4 and CPTQ-Oc.76,77 The electron mobility of solution-processable CDTSQ is 14 times larger than that of a previously reported dilakylated-CDT-based CDTRQ (0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1, vacuum-processed) quinoidal derivative.77 These results demonstrate that side-chain engineering can improve the device performance of solution-sheared CDTSQ organic semiconductors.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route to quinoids 1–4 is shown in Scheme 1, where the starting molecule CDT (5) was synthesized following procedures from the literature.81 First, compound 5 was deprotonated with t-BuOK and then treated with CS2 for the in situ generation of the ketene dithiolate anion, which underwent alkylation with alkyl bromides (C8H17Br, C10H21Br, C12H25Br, and C14H29Br) to afford the corresponding dialkylated thioacetals 6a–d in excellent yields (84–95%). Upon further treatment of 6a–d with n-bromosuccinimide, the dibrominated compounds 7a–d were obtained in excellent yields (85–91%). Finally, via Takahashi coupling of compounds 7a–d with malononitrile in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst, followed by oxidation using a saturated solution of bromine in water, quinoids CDTSQ 1–4 were obtained in good yields (51–60%) (Scheme 1). Further, dialkylated-CDT-based quinoidal derivative CDTRQ was synthesized using a procedure reported previously.77

Physical characterization
Thermal analyses of the new organic semiconductors CDTSQs (1–4) were performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; Fig. S5, ESI†) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Fig. S6, ESI†); the corresponding thermal data are summarized in Table 1. The TGA measurements reveal that all four CDTSQs (1–4) exhibit high thermal stability with ∼5% weight loss starting in the temperature range of 305 °C–309 °C and at 317 °C for CDTRQ (Fig. S7, ESI†). The DSC scans reveal that all compounds CDTSQs (1–4) have high melting points with sharp endotherms between 220 °C and 238 °C. Upon increasing the lengths of the side chain in CDTSQs, the melting temperature decreases because chain motion at high temperatures reduces core–core intermolecular interactions. Thus, CDTSQ-12 (3) shows a sharp melting at 226 °C and a sharp crystallization peak at 205 °C, indicative of the highly ordered crystalline structures. Furthermore, a comparison of the effect of dialkylated and dithioalkylated-methylidenyl side chains in the CDTRQ and CDTSQ semiconductors, respectively, indicates that the melting temperature significantly decreases for CDTRQ (142 °C)77 compared with that of CDTSQ (238 °C). This implies that CDTSQs exhibiting better thermal behaviour due to the presence of dithioalkylated-methylidenyl side chains. The optical properties of 1–4 were measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy in diluted o-dichlorobenzene solution. As shown in Fig. 2, the solution absorption spectra of CDTSQs (1–4) are identical to two main absorption bands, indicating that the variation of the thioalkyl side-chain length does not lead to fundamental changes in the intrinsic electronic structure of the π-conjugated CDTS backbone. By contrast, CDTRQ molecules, which do not have dithioalkylated-methylidenylide chains exhibiting a slight blue shift around 531 nm (Fig. S8, ESI†). In the CDTSQs, the peak at 350–450 nm originated from the π–π* transition through the conjugated backbone, while the peak at 450–580 nm for CDTSQs was attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating CDT core and the electron-withdrawing cyano end groups.66,68 The absorption edges of CDTSQs in the film state are around 690 nm, corresponding to the estimated optical bandgaps of 1.82, 1.81, 1.77, and 1.81 eV for CDTSQ-8, CDTSQ-10, CDTSQ-12, and CDTSQ-14, respectively.

The absorption shoulder (∼620 nm) can be found from the diluted solution to the thin films, indicating a strong π–π packing. It can be clearly seen that the most intensified absorption shoulder of CDTSQ-12 is due to the better film formation from its increased solubility. By contrast, further increase in thioalkyl length for CDTSQ-14 results in a decrease in the shoulder intensity, possibly due to an over-length side chain. The side-chain configuration is hypothesized to discernibly alter the aggregation state of CDTSQs. Molecular energy levels of CDTSQs (1–4) examined using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The DPV data show that all the CDTSQ quinoidal molecules possess similar oxidation and reduction potentials.

Thus, thioalkyl substituents of the conjugated backbones have no significant effect on the electrochemical properties of the CDTSQs. In general, a nonthiolakylated CDTRQ molecule exhibits low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and high LUMO, which leads to the larger energy gap and thus inferiority to OFETs (Fig. S9, ESI† and Table 1). Consequently, the derived HOMO and LUMO of 1–4 and CDTRQ are located around −6.08, −6.10, −6.10, −6.09, and −6.18 eV and −4.08, −4.11, −4.11, −4.07, and −4.08 eV respectively, according to the equation HOMO/LUMO = −(4.2 + Eox/Ered), assuming an internal standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) oxidation at −4.8 eV. The low-lying LUMO energy level of these CDTSQs should lead to facile electron injection in OFETs and demonstrate the potential ambient stability of these n-type CDTS quinoids. To gain further insight into the effect of side-chain engineering on the electronic structure and molecular geometry of CDTSQs (1–4), density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of the Gaussian 09W program. All the calculated compounds showed similar electron density distribution for HOMO and LUMO along the entire quinoidal backbone. This electron density distribution demonstrated a significant delocalization of the quinoidal structure. From the DFT calculations, all the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −6.29 and −3.95 eV, respectively, consistent with the DPV experimental results (Fig. 4). The optimized geometries obtained from DFT calculations (Fig. S10, ESI†) suggest that the CDTSQ-conjugated cores are highly planar, which would promote an efficient delocalization of the π-electrons and facilitate π–π overlap and intermolecular interactions; therefore, it could be beneficial for charge transport.

Single-crystal structure
Single crystals of CDTSQ-10 (2), CDTSQ-12 (3), and CDTSQ-14 (4) were grown via slow solvent evaporation using DCM/hexane solvent mixture to gain further insight into their molecular packing pattern and charge transport properties. Their molecular structure and the complete crystal data derived from X-ray crystallographic analyses are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S11, S12 (ESI†). Both CDTSQ-10 (2) and CDTSQ-12 (3) crystallize in the monoclinic space group of P (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†), whereas CDTSQ-14 recrystallizes in the triclinic space group of P (Table S3, ESI†). Shorter distances between S(alkyl)⋯H(thiophene), 2.70 Å for CDSTQ-10 (2), 2.70 and 2.71 Å for CDSTQ-12 (3), and 2.76 and 2.73 Å for CDSTQ-14, showed the existence of an intramolecular nonbonded interaction between sulfur and hydrogen atoms. Those distances are lesser than the sum of the van der Waals radii of S and H atoms (3.0 Å). The dihedral angles between dithioalkyl methylene and the central core were 5.3°, 4.8°, and 4.9° for CDSTQ-10, CDSTQ-12, and CDSTQ-14 molecules, respectively. The shorter dihedral angles were 2.8 and 4.2° for molecule 2, 2.6 and 4.3° for molecule 3, and 2.3 and 4.4° for molecule 4 between the end-capping unit and central core (CDT), indicating good planarity of these CDTSQs for efficient charge transfer (Fig. 5a and Fig. S11a, S12a, ESI†). The molecular lengths were 12.26, 12.32, and 12.33 Å for CDSTQ-10, CDSTQ-12, and CDSTQ-14, respectively. The front and side views of CDTSQ molecules with π–π interplanar distances of 3.43 Å exhibited brick-type π–π stacking arrangement (Fig. 5b, c and Fig. S11b, c, S12b, c, ESI†). Further, the shortest intermolecular S (fused core)⋯N distances of 2.98–3.02 Å, S (thioalkyl)⋯N distance of 3.26 Å, and N⋯H interaction of 2.69 Å–2.73 Å between CDTSQ layered molecules increase the order of π–π molecular stacking (Fig. 5d and Fig. S11d, S12d, ESI†). The molecular packing arrangement of CDTSQ molecules with a brick-type stacking distance of 3.43 Å exhibited an N⋯N intermolecular distance of 3.02–3.05 Å and slipping angles of 34.6°–39.5° and 94.5°–95.3° along the long and short molecular axes, respectively (Fig. 5e–g and Fig. S11e–g, S12e–g, ESI†). In summary, the smaller dihedral angles between dithioalkyl methylene and the CDT core (4.8°–5.3°), planar molecular structure, short main-core stacking distance (3.43 Å), and short intramolecular (S⋯H) and intermolecular (S⋯N, N⋯H, and N⋯N) distances of CDSTQ molecules suggest good conditions for the extended π-orbital interaction of the corresponding molecules, resulting in better OFET device performance.

(b and c) Front-view and side-view of CDTSQ molecules with π–π interplanar distances of 3.43 Å exhibiting brick type π–π stacking arrangement. The molecular length is 12.32 Å for CDSTQ-12 (3). (d) Shortest intermolecular S (fused core)⋯N distances of 2.98, 3.02 Å, S (thioalkyl)⋯N distance of 3.26 Å and N⋯H interaction of 2.73 Å between CDTSQ layered molecules increases the order of π–π molecular stacking. (e–g) Molecular packing arrangement of CDTSQ molecules with a brick type stacking distance of 3.43 Å and exhibits the N⋯N intermolecular distance of 3.04 Å and slipping angles of 39.4° and 94.5° along the long and short molecular axes respectively. 
Charge transport properties
To study the influence of different lengths of the alkylthio side chain on the electrical properties of CDTSQs, the top contact/bottom gate (TC/BG) device architectures of OFETs were fabricated with the solution-sheared or spin-coated organic semiconductor layer to evaluate their charge transport characteristics and compare the performance of these two thin-film-processing techniques. The solution-shearing technique, which was successfully used in our previous work,14 involves placing an organic semiconductor solution between the upper shearing plate and a bottom heated substrate, forming a confined meniscus and then displacing the plate at a constant speed. The details of device fabrication and measurement are described in the experimental section. Fig. 6a illustrates transfer curves of solution-sheared OFETs, in which the drain voltage (Vd) is fixed at 100 V. The cut-off characteristics are clearly observed for all four samples.

All CDTSQ-based devices exhibit a positive gate bias-modulated charge transport, indicating an apparent n-type semiconducting channel. This may be attributed to their relatively deep LUMOs. Fig. 6b and Fig. S14, S15, ESI† present the output characteristics of CDTSQ-based OFETs. The OFETs display clear current pinch-off and saturation behavior, implying that the gate voltage (Vg) can fully control the active channel drain current (Id). Table 2 summarizes the mobility (μ), threshold voltage (Vth), and current ON/OFF current ratio (ION/IOFF) of the four CDTSQ-based OFETs. The values of μ and Vth are extracted from the intercept at Vg and the slope of the plot of the square root of Idvs. Vg, respectively. Different batches and cells in the same batch of characterized OFETs allow calculation of the statistical behavior of the device's electrical properties, using 10 data values for each. Among these four different alkylthio side-chain lengths of CDTSQ devices, CDTSQ-12 exhibited the best performance, which displayed maximum and average electron mobilities of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μmax) and 0.09 ± 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μavg), respectively, with ION/IOFF of 103–105. OFETs with solution-sheared CDTSQ-8, CDTSQ-10, and CDTSQ-14 had a μmax/μavg of 0.025/0.016 ± 0.005, 0.09/0.07 ± 0.01, and 0.025/0.021 ± 0.004 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These results show that when the lengths of the alkylthio side chain increase, the electron mobility also improves under the condition that the number of carbon atoms in the side chain is not more than 12. Apparently, when the lengths of the alkylthio side chain increased to that of the tetradecylthio unit, the mobility of the devices suddenly dropped, which did not follow the abovementioned tendency. The comprehensive reason will be discussed in thin-film morphology and microstructural analysis. However, the threshold voltage (Vth) of solution-sheared OTFTs was very high (9–30 V), which may have resulted from a thicker film. Because of the TC/BG device architectures, the injected charges need to penetrate a very large depletion region before they reach the channel, which causes extra resistance between the source/drain electrodes and the semiconductor layer.

A comparison of solution-sheared OTFTs with spin-coated OTFTs revealed that the electron mobilities of solution-shearing-based devices were much higher than those of spin-coating-based devices, which can be seen in Fig. S13 and Table S4 (ESI†). This phenomenon could be attributed to two main reasons: first, the solution-shearing method provides a unidirectional shearing force that endows an organic semiconductor layer with highly aligned crystals, which favors charge carrier transport in the channel. Second, because of the low viscosity of the small-molecule solution, most of the solution would be spun off from the substrate, thus making the thin-film formability inferior, which causes more defects in devices and potentially reduces the crystallinity.
Morphological analysis

Fig. 7a–d display the polarized optical microscopy (POM) images of the four solution-sheared CDTSQ crystalline films. It can be visually observed that all the samples possess an aligned long-plate-like crystal texture covering the substrate surface and parallel with the shearing direction, which is the typical feature of the solution-sheared films with optimization between the shearing rate and solvent evaporation.80 However, the POM image of CDTSQ-8 shows many cross-shaped precipitates inside the crystals, which is probably due to the early nucleation during the shearing process that leads to the irregular and disordered crystal structure, resulting from the lower solubility of the shortest alkylthio side-chain lengths in CDTSQ-8. When the alkylthio side-chain lengths increase, this effect could be alleviated, as observed in the cases of CDTSQ-12 and CDTSQ-14, which may give rise to a high degree of crystallinity and crystallographic alignment of the large-sized crystals. Fig. S16a–d (ESI†) show the spin-coated CDTSQ films to compare the difference between these two processing techniques. The crystals of the spin-coated CDTSQ films are tattered on the entire film, and there are no continuous crystal domains to facilitate charge transport. Further, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to study the morphologies of the crystalline films. Fig. 7e–h exhibit the topographic images of the solution-sheared CDTSQ thin films, and their root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) are reported. The crystals of all the CDTSQ samples are plate-like and parallel with the direction of the solution shearing, but the Rrms varies. An increased Rrms is known to be related to a larger crystal domain. The Rrms values were 2.3, 4.3, 6.6, and 4.8 nm for the samples of CDTSQ-8, CDTSQ-10, CDTSQ-12, and CDTSQ-14, respectively. The larger Rrms and fewer grain boundaries of CDTSQ-12 imply a larger crystal domain that can lead to better charge transport. This result coincides with the semiconducting electrical property. The AFM images of the spin-coated CDTSQ films can be seen in Fig. S16e–h, (ESI†) which shows that the spin-coated films contain tiny disordered crystals. Consequently, the spin-coated devices exhibited very poorer electrical behavior.

Microstructural analysis
GIWAXS analysis was conducted to understand the effect of different alkylthio side-chain lengths on the molecular packing and crystallinity of CDTSQs. The diffractogram and corresponding packing parameters of solution-sheared CDTSQ-8, CDTSQ-10, CDTSQ-12, and CDTSQ-14 can be found in Fig. 8 and Table S5 (ESI†). The GIWAXS patterns show intense Bragg spots for these solution-sheared films. All CDTSQs demonstrate the apparent (00l) lamellar spotty reflection in the out-of-plane direction (qz), indicating a typical edge-on molecular orientation, which may facilitate charge transport in the OFET channel. The order of diffraction appearing in the patterns is found to be affected by the side-chain length. As the alkylthio side-chain length increases, the higher-order diffraction spots can be seen until 12 carbons. CDTSQ-12 reaches the highest diffraction order (l = 3), probably resulting from the longer side chain that causes the higher solubility and thus prevents the disordered nucleation sites during the shearing process. However, the CDTSQ-14 sample does not follow this trend. A possible reason could be that the overlength side chain disturbs the lamellar molecule packing. The lamellar spacing calculated from the primary peaks of CDTSQs is listed in Table S5 (ESI†). As expected, the lamellar spacing increases with side-chain length, from 24.15 to 33.74 Å as the side-chain length increases from 8 to 14 carbons. In addition, judging from the intensity of the (10l) signals, considered as the π–π intermolecular interaction, the intensity of the (10l) signals follows a similar trend with the diffraction order of (00l) peak. When the side-chain length increases from 8 to 12 carbons, the (10l) signals become more distinct. CDTSQ-12 has the shortest π–π stacking distance of 3.43 Å, which benefits charge transport in OFETs. However, for CDTSQ-14, the intensity of the (10l) signal sharply weakens and the π–π stacking distance increases compared with CDTSQ-12. Again, this indicates that the 12-carbon side chain is optimal for the CDTSQ small-molecule semiconductors.

Further, using the GIWAXS patterns and single-crystal data, the molecular packing in the thin-film state was proposed. A comparison of the length of the c-axis from single-crystal data and lamellar distance from GIWAXS indicates that the CDTSQ molecules may align with the c-axis, as shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†). Furthermore, the crystal long axis (b-axis) aligns parallel to the shearing direction where the crystallographic ac-plane is perpendicular to the substrate surface. To acquire more detailed structure information, the 1D profiles of the (00l) lamellar diffractions in the out-of-plane direction are compared in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the crystal coherence length (Lc) of the four samples, summarized in Table S5, (ESI†) demonstrate the same tendency of grain size as that from the AFM images. CDTSQ-12 has the sharpest and narrowest diffraction peak among the four samples, suggesting the highest crystallinity and largest crystal grain size. Semiconducting channels with larger crystals can alleviate the charge transport hindrance from the grain boundaries. Thus, CDTSQ-12 shows the highest charge mobility in the OFET measurements. The diffraction patterns of the spin-coated films are shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†). In contrast to the patterns of the solution-sheared films, all the spin-coated CDTSQs exhibit lower diffraction orders and weaker diffraction from π–π intermolecular interaction. This result may be due to the nondirectional film-forming process, the inferior thin-film formability, and the relatively disordered nucleation sites during spin coating, resulting in lower crystallinity.
Device stability test
The long-term environmental stability of four CDTSQ samples was estimated by measuring the device mobility every seven days when it was stored in the ambient environment (relative humidity 45–50% and room temperature of 25 °C). As shown in Fig. 9a, the mobility of all CDTSQ OFETs does not decline for 28 days, which can be ascribed to the introduction of the strong electron-withdrawing cyano end-capping groups. After attaching four cyano groups to the quinoidal CDTS core, their LUMO energy levels decreased to −3.95 eV, which may increase the tolerance of H2O/O2. Moreover, to evaluate the device's operational stability, electrical sweeps with Vg ranging from −20 to 100 V with a fixed Vd = 100 V were repeated for 100 cycles. As seen in Fig. 9b and Fig. S20, (ESI†) the transfer characteristics of the four OFETs do not change markedly. This good reliability can be due to the surface passivation between the organic semiconductor and dielectric layers. The surface trap problems can be alleviated through self-assembled monolayer (SAM) passivation. Consequently, the devices can retain their electrical performance after 100 operation cycles.

Conclusion
In conclusion, new series of dithioalkylated-methylidenyl CDT-based quinoidal semiconductors—CDTSQs (1–4)—were designed and synthesized as solution-processable n-type organic small molecules for OFETs. Furthermore, single-crystal structures of CDTSQ-10, CDTSQ-12, and CDTSQ-14 were obtained. The physical, electrochemical, as well as electrical properties of these new compounds were thoroughly investigated. CDTSQ with long side chains was found to improve solubility for efficient thin-film processing using the solution-shearing method, molecular packing, and charge transport characteristics, which favorably impact electron transport. The abovementioned observations are validated by analyzing optical absorption, microscopic images, and GIWAXS measurements. Among the CDTSQ derivatives, solution-sheared CDTSQ-12 possesses the highest mobility of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as good ambient and electrical stability, thus making it a promising new solution-processable and air-stable organic semiconductor for OFET applications.

Device fabrication and measurement
This study used a heavily n-doped silicon wafer with 300 nm thermally grown SiO2 dielectric as the substrate for OFETs. The substrates were sonicated with acetone and isopropanol each for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the substrates were dried with nitrogen and exposed under UV ozone plasma for 5 minutes. The dielectric surface was treated with (2-phenylethyl)trichlorosilane (PETS) to form the SAM for further passivation. The organic semiconductor layer was deposited onto the PETS-treated dielectric layer using the solution shearing method with 3 mg mL−1CDTSQs dissolved in chlorobenzene or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The shearing speed ranged from 20 to 80 μm s−1, and deposition temperature ranged from 90 °C to 110 °C under shearing. After deposition, the samples were thermally annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour under vacuum. Finally, silver source/drain electrodes that matched LUMO energy levels of CDTSQs samples were deposited with shadow masks at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1. A thermal evaporator controlled the chamber pressure at 10−6 torr. The channel will be perpendicular to the shearing direction and the channel length (L) and width (W) are 25 and 1500 μm, respectively. The OFETs electrical performance was measured inside the nitrogen-filled glove box by Keithley 4200-SCS with a probe station at room temperature and in the dark. The mobility (μ) was obtained from the following equation: (1)where C is the capacitance per unit area of the dielectric layer.
