    , Accepted 12th February 2015First published on 13th February 2015AbstractFour new donor–acceptor copolymers were synthesized by using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran as donors and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene was used as the acceptor building block. A systematic study was performed to determine the influence of the combinations of different heteroatoms in the donor–acceptor copolymer. In bulk heterojunction solar cells, the polymer with all furan building blocks in the electron donating units, poly[(4,8-bis(5-dodecyl-2-furanyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2-yl)-alt-(2-ethyl-1-(3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-1-hexanone)] (P4) (Mn = 66.7 kDa), achieved the highest power conversion efficiency of 5.23%.
Introduction
Furan and thiophene heterocycles are widely used as building blocks for semiconducting polymers.1 Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)2,3 for example, has been extensively used in organic photovoltaics and field-effect transistors.4 The P3HT electron donating polymer gave up to 5% power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) acceptor.5–7 Being triggered by the promising performance of P3HT in organic photovoltaics (OPV), diblock copolymers4,8 and polymer–nanoparticle hybrids9,10 were further investigated. The relationship between the performance of solar cells and the molecular orbital energy levels of both polymer and PC61BM are now well established.11,12 However, the band gap around 2 eV for P3HT limits the sunlight absorption and the conversion of the photons with longer wavelength in the photovoltaic applications.13,14 To broaden the intrinsic absorption and adjust the HOMO/LUMO levels of the p-type semiconducting polymers, donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymers were designed, synthesized, and used as donor polymers in BHJ.15–17
The polymers containing benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) electron donating unit in the backbone have shown promising performance in BHJ solar cells.18,19 In BDT monomers, alkyl or alkoxyl side chains can be directly attached on the benzene core to improve the solubility of the synthesized polymers.20,21 The commercially available polymer PTB7 with 2-ethylhexyl side chains gave a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.4% with PC71BM acceptor.22,23 The effect of the different alkyl and alkoxy substituents was studied in terms of the active layer film morphologies and device PCEs.20 The electron withdrawing carboxylate substituent was recently attached on BDT and its D–A copolymers gave PCE of ∼3% with Voc of 0.51 V.24 The sp2 hybridized carbons were also attached on the BDT to generate monomers with π-conjugation perpendicular to the polymer backbones. Benzene, thiophene, selenophene, and furan were employed as substituents on BDT.25–28 The BDT building block was further tuned and optimized by attaching larger aromatic substituents such as thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,29 3,3′,5-trimethyl-2,2′-bithiophene,30,31 phenylethynyl,32–35 and 2,2′-(5-ethylhexyl)-thienylenevinylenethiophene.36 PCEs ranging from 1 to 8% were measured for these polymers.
Incorporation of furan, especially in 2-D conjugated structures, is relatively less developed.37 Furan is an abundant product from renewable resources. The vegetable waste in agriculture and food industry can be converted to furfural (furan-2-carboxaldehyde),1 while metal catalyzed decarbonylation reactions further convert furfural to furan in large scale.38 By replacing the sulfur atoms with oxygen, the synthesis of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) was straight forward.39 Moreover, the replacement of sulfur with oxygen atoms could introduce some advantages to the photovoltaic performances of the D–A copolymers with BDF.1 Furan building blocks with smaller atomic size of oxygen generate less steric hindrance to the neighboring units as compared to thiophene.40,41 As a result, BDF polymers are expected to show smaller π–π stacking distance with more planar backbones and increased conjugation length. The relatively high electronegativity of oxygen in furan could influence the energy levels of the orbitals involved in the extended π-conjugated structures differently than sulfur. This allows for the BDF polymers to adjust the HOMO, LUMO, and band gap to further improve the optoelectronic properties. In addition, π-conjugated compounds containing furan building blocks showed improved solubility in organic solvents.40,42 The PCEs of BDF polymers were initially below 1%.43 In our previous work, BDF homopolymers were synthesized and studied and a phenylethynyl substituted BDF homopolymer gave PCEs of ∼1.2%.39
More recently, BDF D–A copolymers were reported. BDF with 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains were the most studied. PCEs achieved with these polymers ranged between 4.4 and 5.2% in 2012.44,45 Recently, 2-ethylhexyloxy substituted BDF was copolymerized with thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione acceptors and achieved PCEs above 7%.46 Thiophene and furan were used to extend the π-conjugation of the side chains instead of the ethylhexyloxy. BDF polymers with thiophene side chains offered PCEs above 6%,47,48 while BDF polymers with furan side chains gave a PCE of 2.6%.37
In this paper, we report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of four BDF/BDT D–A copolymers containing both furan and thiophene substituents. The studies were focused on the effects of furan building blocks in both BDF/BDT cores and side chains. Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene was used as the electron accepting units based on its wide study and its good performance in BDT/BDF D–A copolymers.49,50 All four D–A copolymers were synthesized and characterized under comparable conditions.
Results and discussion
Materials design and synthesis
Four electron donating monomers with different combination of furan and thiophene building blocks were designed and synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. In our design, dodecyl side chains were attached to generate soluble polymers. Extended π-conjugation was obtained by adding furan or thiophene substituents on the BDF and BDT cores. The different chemical shifts of the aromatic protons and carbons of BDT (M1 and M2) and BDF (M3 and M4) monomers (Fig. 1 and S14†) are due to different π electron densities by the incorporation of different heteroatoms. Different π electron distributions in monomers indicate tuneable electronic properties in the resulting D–A copolymers. The coupling constants of protons Ha and Hb in BDT (5.67 Hz for M1 and 5.75 Hz for M2) are larger than those of BDF (2.28 Hz for M3 and 2.25 Hz for M4). In the electron accepting units of the D–A copolymers, the branched acyl side chains enhanced both solubility and the stability of the materials.

Bis(trimethyltin) functionalized BDT and BDF monomers were synthesized in comparable conditions. Four different polymers P1 (BDT-Th), P2 (BDT-F), P3 (BDF-Th), and P4 (BDF-F) were synthesized by Stille-coupling polymerization with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) catalyst. Molecular weights of the polymers were estimated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with THF eluent and polystyrene calibration. The SEC data are shown in Table 1.

BDF copolymers had higher molecular weights with Mn = 51 kDa for polymer P3 and Mn = 67 kDa for polymer P4. By contrast, the BDT copolymers gave lower molecular weight (Table 1 and SI†). This noticeable difference between molecular weights of BDF and BDT copolymers can be explained by the enhanced solubility brought by furan building blocks in the polymer backbones.40,42 Stille coupling is a step growth polymerization and gave relatively broad polydispersity indexes (PDI).
The thermal stability of the synthesized D–A polymers was determined by TGA (Fig. 2). The BDT and BDF D–A copolymers showed ∼5% weight loss around 400 °C. The copolymers containing furan had slightly lower decomposition temperature than the copolymer with only thiophene moieties. Amorphous nature of the copolymers was indirectly confirmed by the DSC curves (Fig. S15†) by lack of endothermic peaks. The synthesized D–A copolymers were soluble in chlorobenzene and chloroform solvents.

UV-Vis
The optical absorption spectra of the synthesized D–A copolymers were measured both on spin-coated thin film on glass substrates and in chloroform solution (Fig. 3). The copolymers displayed two absorption maxima at ∼330 nm and ∼700 nm (Table 2). The absorption maxima at ∼330 nm are obvious longer than isolated furan (208 nm) or thiophene (215 nm and 231 nm).51 This can be explained by π–π* transition of the 2-D extend π-conjugation on BDF/BDT center. The absorption band in the visible region at ∼700 nm is due to the intramolecular charge-transfer transition in the D–A regions.52 The BDT polymers, P1 and P2, displayed a slight red shift in the thin film absorption spectra as compared to the chloroform solutions. This indicated the π–π stacking among the polymer backbones in the solid states.

For the P3 and P4, the shoulders around 680 nm extended to the blue and displayed stronger intensities in the film absorption spectra, while the peaks at 730 nm did not change. As a result, BDF copolymers displayed broader absorption with shorter wavelength in thin film than in solution. This phenomenon is first observed among BDF D–A copolymers. A similar UV-Vis behavior can be observed in BDT D–A copolymer published by Ge's group.48 However, the reason is not clear. The absence of strong red shifts in absorption of these four copolymers was attributed to the rigid rod conformation in both solution and solid state.
By direct measurements of UV-Vis absorption spectra of spin-coated polymer thin films on glass substrates, the attenuation coefficients (extinction coefficients), were obtained and reported (Table 2) instead of absorption coefficient in solutions.52 In this way, the scattering and luminescence in the solid state were counted.53 The attenuation coefficients, α, were calculated by the eqn (1), where A is absorbance, T is transmittance, z is film thickness. In order to minimize the influences of film thickness, average of 10 measurements were used (Table S1 and Fig. S16†). A = −lnT = αz(1)
At the highest absorption wavelength, the values were all above 6 × 104 cm−1 for the four D–A copolymers.
The absorption onset values of the D–A copolymers did not have obvious shift from the UV-Vis measurements of solutions to the thin films. Copolymer P4 with all furan in the electron donating moiety showed the smallest Eg(opt) of 1.50 eV. Copolymer P1 with all thiophene had highest Eg(opt) of 1.56 eV. The incorporation of furan in donor units (P2–P4) lowered the band gap by 0.04–0.06 eV compared to P1 with all thiophene.
CV
The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers were estimated by CV (Fig. 4 and Table 2). For calibration, the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was measured under the same conditions and located at 0.09 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (Fig. S17†).54 The value of −4.8 eV is used as absolute energy level of our electrochemical system at 0.0 V.55 This value is also consistent with Huo et al.'s published data with similar CV conditions and polymer structures.49,50 The onset values of oxidation (φox) and reduction (φre) potentials were used to calculate the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers by using the following eqn (2) and (3):56 EHOMO (eV) = −e(φox,Ag/Ag+ + 4.8 − E1/2,Fc/Fc+)(2) ELUMO (eV) = −e(φre,Ag/Ag+ + 4.8 − E1/2,Fc/Fc+)(3)

The HOMO energy levels of the synthesized D–A copolymers had close values. BDT copolymer P1 had HOMO value of −5.15 eV. The BDF copolymer P3 and P4 showed HOMO levels at −5.18 eV and −5.12 eV. Copolymer P2 showed a slightly higher HOMO at −5.07 eV. For the LUMO levels, the benzodithiophene copolymers P1 and P2 were ∼0.2 eV higher than the benzodifuran copolymers P3 and P4. This suggested that the furan building blocks in the polymer backbones lowered the LUMO energy level of the materials. The extended π-conjugation generated by the furan or thiophene side chains, however, offered limited changes on the HOMO and LUMO levels of the copolymers. The copolymers with a benzodifuran core (P3 and P4) had ∼0.2 eV smaller electrochemical band gaps then the copolymers with a benzodithiophene core (P1 and P2). The difference between optical band gap and electrochemical band gap of each copolymer is lower than 0.3 eV. This difference was shown smaller in P3 or P4 than P1 or P2. The difference is due to the exciton binding energy.13 Smaller variation between optical and electrochemical band gap in P3 or P4 implied lower binding energy of excitons in BDF copolymers than in BDT copolymers.
Photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) was also used to estimate HOMO levels by measuring ionization energy of the polymers (Fig. 5).57 The synthesized D–A copolymers had very close ionization energy around 5 eV.

XRD
Thin film XRD measurements were performed on the pure polymers to investigate the influence of furan and thiophene building blocks.
Relatively broad peaks with low intensity indicated that the D–A copolymers are amorphous in the solid state (Fig. 6). The D–A copolymers displayed peaks at ∼3 degrees and 24 degrees, which could be attributed to lamellar packing and π–π stacking, respectively (Table 3).58 With the incorporation of furan to the electron donating building block, the intensity of the π–π stacking peaks increased in intensity from P1 to P4. Copolymer P4 with all furan building blocks in the electron donating units had the smallest π–π stacking distance of 3.57 Å. By contrast, copolymer P1 with all thiophene building blocks had the largest π–π stacking distance of 3.74 Å. The XRD confirmed that smaller sized oxygen atoms can result in smaller π–π stacking distances in the solid state.

Torsional angles
Torsional angles for BDT/BDF cores with furan or thiophene substituents were calculated at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory in the gas phase (Table 4). Only aromatic moieties were considered to simplify the calculation. Simulated ball-and-stick models are shown in Fig. 7 with both frontal and lateral views. The biggest torsional angle of 57.26° occurred with the BDT-thiophene. The combination of all thiophene building blocks generated very strong spatial hindrance between the core and substituents. This is mainly due to the larger atomic size of sulfur. Torsional angles decreased in both BDT-furan and BDF-thiophene (b and c in Table 4). The smaller oxygen atoms reduced the intramolecular steric hindrance. In BDF-furan, with all oxygen as the heteroatoms, the torsional angle is further reduced to only 0.1°. This small torsional angle confirms a good planar π-conjugation in BDF-furan structure and also explains the smallest d-spacing of π–π stacking in P4 measured in XRD.

OPV devices and EQE
In order to keep the film thickness approximately 100 nm for the polymers with different molecular weights, different concentrations of the polymer/PC71BM solutions were prepared in chlorobenzene with small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The speed of the spin coater was kept at 1000 rpm with acceleration of 1740 rpm s−1. Because the similarity of the polymer structures, P4 was used to optimized the device fabrications (Fig. 8). The conditions which gave highest PCE were applied for the other polymers (Fig. 9). The ratio of polymer P4 and PC71BM was the first optimized parameter (Table 5). P4 and PC71BM with different weight to weight (w/w) ratios were dissolved in CB and DIO with 97/3 volume by volume (v/v). All the active layer blends were spin coated from hot solutions at 110 °C onto the hot substrates. As the data listed in the Table 5, the ratio of 1:1.5 offered the highest PCE.

The Voc slightly increased with increasing the amount of PC71BM, but Jsc decreased markedly at ratios higher than 1:2. The amount of DIO as the additive was then varied with fixed polymer/PC71BM ratio at 1:1.5. The Jsc decreased 10 times without DIO additive and was proved to be very sensitive to the amount of DIO. The results confirmed that the 3% v/v of DIO in CB gave the best device performance. With consistent 3% DIO and 1:1.5 ratio of P4/PC71BM, fabrication conditions of OPV devices were optimized. Because of the high boiling point of CB, the active layers contained considerable amount of solvent, which is insulating. Thus, the devices were kept in the high vacuum chamber below 10−6 torr overnight to remove the residual solvent. In this way, the PCE were further increased by more than 15%. It has been reported that methanol treated surfaces of polymer/PC71BM blend could increase the PCE up to 30%.59,60 However, we observed a decrease of both Jsc and FF with the methanol surface treatment (Fig. 8). The FF values were very sensitive and decreased dramatically for methanol treatment longer than one minute. Methanol treated active layers did not improve Jsc either. As a result, the best performances of P4 was measured for the devices with polymer/PC71BM ratio of 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene with 3% v/v DIO additive under vacuum for 20 hours which gave a PCE of 5.23% (Table 6).

For P1, P2, and P3, the same conditions as P4 were used for the device fabrication (Fig. 9). As shown in Table 6, copolymer P3 gave a PCE at 3.3%, which was lower than P4. Copolymers P1 and P2 displayed similar PCEs ∼2.6%. Both Jsc and FF increased by switching from BDT copolymers to BDF copolymers. Copolymer P4 reached a high Jsc of 12.37 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.65. The other benzodifuran copolymer P3 had Jsc of 8.05 mA cm−2, which is still higher than the Jsc of benzodithiophene copolymers P1 and P2. Voc of the synthesized D–A copolymers changed in a small range of 0.1 V. This matched well with the close HOMO values of all copolymers.61 Copolymer P1 which had all thiophene building blocks gave a Voc of 0.73 V. This value was the highest among all the synthesized D–A copolymers. Copolymer P4 with all furan building blocks in the electron donating moieties had Voc of 0.65 V. Copolymers P2 and P3 gave Voc of ∼0.68 V. Overall, the BDF copolymers performed better than the BDT copolymers.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were directly performed on the OPV devices. The high EQE of P4 in the wavelength range of 300 nm to 900 nm explained its high Jsc in the OPV devices (Fig. 10). Copolymers P1, P2, and P3 showed lower EQE with lower Jsc. Copolymer P4 also showed the broadest EQE curve, which matched with its smallest Eg(opt) from the UV-Vis absorption spectrum. The EQE peaks around 475 nm indicated that the PC71BM absorbed more photons in that range than the copolymers. The Jsc values estimated from EQE measurements were slightly larger than those of the OPV measurements (Table S2†). Based on the device area of 10 mm2, the Jsc values reported in this work are within the discrepancy threshold and reliable.62

TMAFM
The surface morphology of the active layer in BHJ devices were investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM) and are shown in Fig. 11 and S18.†

The copolymer/PC71BM active layer blend films of the synthesized D–A copolymers showed similar phase separation textures but with different sizes of the domains. From the phase images, the granular morphologies can be observed in the films made by P2, while the films made by P1 and P3 had less obvious granular features. The height images of P1, P2 and P3 showed intense irregular height changes which indicate phase separation in large domains. Film surface of the blend with P4 showed very small height and phase changes.
For P1, P2 and P3, RMS values were above 4 nm. Copolymer P2 gave a relatively rough active layer film with RMS of 6.88 nm. Copolymers P1 and P3 gave smoother active layer films with RMS of 4.07 nm and 3.99 nm, respectively. The RMS of P4 was ∼1.73 nm and suggested the best phase separation in the BHJ films. These results indicated that the films with smaller roughness gave better performances in the OPV devices, which is consistent with our previous finding.30,31,33,58
SCLC
The synthesized D–A copolymers were tested in the Schottky diode as pure polymers and polymer/PC71BM blends with the space charge limited current model (Table 7, Fig. 12 and ESI†).63 Among the pure copolymers, P3 gave the highest charge carrier mobility of 5.22 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Copolymer P4 had a charge carrier mobility of 4.61 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was larger than the BDT copolymers P1 and P2. In the polymer/PC71BM blends, the charge carrier mobilities were higher than those of pure polymers and showed the same trend as Jsc values determined from the OPV devices. P4/PC71BM blend showed the highest mobility of 4.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. BDF polymers showed consistently larger charge carrier mobilities than the BDT polymers (Table 7).

Conclusions
Four BDF/BDT electron donating monomers were synthesized with different combinations of furan and thiophene building blocks. The furan and thiophene substituents offered perpendicular π-conjugation to the polymer backbones. Stille coupling polymerization was used to generate four D–A copolymers P1, P2, P3, and P4. Enhanced solubility brought by furan building blocks in polymer backbones leads to higher molecular weights of BDF copolymer P3 and P4 (51 and 67 kDa) than the BDT copolymers P1 and P2 (23 and 34 kDa). P1 with only thiophene building blocks showed the decomposition temperature at 417 °C. The other polymers incorporated with furan had lower thermal stability at around 400 °C. All the synthesized D–A copolymers showed comparable HOMO energy level from both of the CV and PESA measurements. BDF copolymers had lower LUMO levels than the BDT polymer. This resulted in smaller band gaps for BDF polymers. In the measurements of BHJ solar cells, P1 had the highest Voc of 0.73 V, while P4 with all furan electron donating units had the smallest Voc of 0.65 V. Copolymer P4 had the highest Jsc of 12.38 mA cm−2. The charge mobilities of both pure polymer and polymer/PC71BM blend were measured in Schottky diode with SCLC model. Copolymer P4 had the highest mobility of 4.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This result matched with the best Jsc that P4 achieved in the OPV devices. A cooperative action of all the characteristics of P4, which contains all furan building blocks in donor, ultimately yields the best PCE of 5.23% among the four copolymers. High film quality was achieved by the high molecular weight of P4. At the same time, the small torsional angle of BDF-furan gathered by theoretical calculation and d-spacing distance of P4 measured by XRD are among the main contributions to the good polymer/PCBM interaction and high solar cell efficiency. This result was also supported by the TMAFM study of the active layer film morphology. Overall, incorporation of furan in both cores (P3 + P4versusP1 + P2) and in substituents (P2versusP1, P4versusP3), displayed higher PCE values compared to thiophene derivatives. This systematic study enriches the variety of the BDF family and is helpful to understand BDF building block better.
