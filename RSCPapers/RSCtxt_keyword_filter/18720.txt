    , Accepted 17th April 2015First published on 17th April 2015AbstractA solid-state environmentally friendly Ag2S quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) is demonstrated. The photovoltaic device is fabricated by applying ZnO@Ag2S core–shell nanowire arrays (NWAs) as light absorbers and electron conductors, and poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) as a solid-state hole conductor. Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) were directly grown on the ZnO nanowires by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method to obtain the core–shell nanostructure. The number of SILAR cycles for QD formation and the length of the core–shell NWs significantly affect the photocurrent. The device with a core–shell NWAs photoanode shows a power conversion efficiency increase by 32% compared with the device based on a typical nanoparticle-based photoanode with Ag2S QDs. The enhanced performance is attributed to enhanced collection of the photogenerated electrons utilizing the ZnO nanowire as an efficient pathway for transporting the photogenerated electrons from the QD to the contact.
Introduction
Demand for new, efficient and sustainable sources of energy has been a driving force for the immense development of photovoltaic devices in the past decades.1 Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as promising light harvesting materials for photovoltaic application,2 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of 8.5% has been reported for a quantum dot based solar cell.3 QDs can also be used as sensitizers on transparent nanoparticles for QD sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).4 Compared with organic dye sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), QDs may possess better stability, higher optical absorption coefficients, lower costs and tunable bandgap energy (Eg) by controlling the size, shape and composition.2b,5 Furthermore, under high energy photon excitation, QDs are able to produce multiple electron–hole pairs per absorbed photon,6 which could boost the theoretical power conversion efficiency by up to 44%, overcoming the Shockley–Queisser limitation (33%).6a So far, a variety of QDs, such as PbSe,7 PbS,8 PbTe,9 CdSe,10 CdS,11 Sb2S3,12 InAs,13 and Ag2S,14 have been investigated for QDSSCs. Among the above QDs, the Ag2S QD shows negligible toxicity and has a Eg of ∼1.1 eV that is near equal to the optimal Eg of ∼1.13 eV for a photovoltaic device, making it a promising building block for efficient photovoltaic device construction.15 Meanwhile, the Ag2S QD is considered to be a convenient model system for confining multiple exciton generation investigations because of its tunable Eg in the near infrared region.14 The photoanode of QDSSCs can be constructed via deposition of presynthesized QDs or by direct growth of QDs using chemical bath deposition (CBD) or the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) approach.
TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles are commonly used in mesoporous electrodes for hosting QDs and providing efficient electron collection and transportation.16 TiO2 mesoporous photoanodes are most applied in DSSCs, and a η of ∼6.7% was obtained in QDSSCs based on a TiO2 photoanode.4c As an electron acceptor and transporter, however, ZnO is attracting increased attention in the past few years due to its superior properties to TiO2 in some aspects. ZnO shows a similar conduction band edge (−4.36 eV vs. −4.41 eV of TiO2) but a higher electron mobility (130–200 cm2 V−1 S−1vs. 0.1–4 cm2 V−1 S−1 of TiO2), which is favorable for efficient electron transportation with less recombination and still enables the possibility for a large open circuit voltage (Voc).16a Meanwhile, ZnO nanostructures can be synthesized in a variety of morphologies due to its easy crystallization and anisotropic growth, and the conductivity can also be tuned by replacing Zn with Al, Ga, or Sn elements.17 In addition to its electronic and optoelectronic properties, recent studies on QD–ZnO nanostructures reported that multiple electrons in QDs can efficiently inject into ZnO, inhibiting the unwanted Auger recombination in QDs.18 Several QDs and organic dyes have been decorated on one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanowires (NWs) for photovoltaic devices with a liquid electrolyte.19 However, liquid-state photovoltaic devices suffer from electrolyte leakage and long-term stability.20 Solid-state photovoltaic devices may be easier to assemble than the devices with a liquid electrolyte and may also be more stable. Ardalan et al. reported a solid-state CdS QDSSC based on a TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) based photoanode, and an efficiency of 0.44% was obtained.21 Lee et al. demonstrated an efficiency of 1.33% for solid-state QDSSCs by using co-sensitization of PbS QD and zinc carboxyphthalocyanine dye (TT1).22
Here, we demonstrate the design and fabrication of a completely solid-state QDSSC based on environmentally-friendly two-dimensional (2D) ZnO@Ag2S core–shell nanowire arrays (NWAs) as light absorbers and electron transporters, in combination with poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) as a solid-state hole conductor. ZnO NWAs with different NW lengths were synthesized and Ag2S QDs were directly grown on the ZnO NWA employing the SILAR approach resulting in the formation of core–shell NWAs. Electron recombination time and transport time in NWA and NP photoanodes are compared and the effect of NW length on photogenerated electron collection is investigated. Interestingly, the number of SILAR cycles for QD formation and NW length significantly affect the photogenerated current. Though the core–shell NWAs device exhibited excellent electron transportation, the device with longer NWs needed a relatively long time for transporting the photogenerated electrons compared to the device with shorter NWs. An optimal length of the NW resulting in the highest performance could therefore be determined. The device with NWAs exhibited better performance than a typical NP-based device because of better collection of the photogenerated electrons in the NWA-based device. The direct pathway along 1D NWs would diminish the possibility of charge recombination during electron percolation in the photoanode by replacing conventionally used TiO2 or ZnO NP networks with ordered ZnO NWAs. The results suggest that environmentally-friendly ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs are promising materials for constructing solid-state photovoltaic devices or other optoelectronic devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstly completely solid-state QDSSC with core–shell NWAs to enhance the photogenerated electron collection.
Results and discussion
Solid-state photovoltaic device based on core–shell nanostructures
NWs were grown on ZnO NP seeds decorated on an F-SnO2 conductive glass (FTO) substrate (Fig. 1a). The NP seeds layer was prepared according to a previously reported procedure.23 NWs were grown on seeds by immersing the seeded substrate into an aqueous solution for 6 h forming 2D NWAs (Fig. 1b). After completion of the reaction, NWs with a length of ∼800 nm were obtained. As to increase the NW length, the NWAs were re-immersed into a fresh aqueous solution for growing for another 6 h. The ZnO NWAs were named as ZnO6, ZnO12, ZnO18, and ZnO24 after grown for 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h, respectively, and the NW length increased ∼800 nm after extending the growing time to 6 h. The Ag2S QDs were directly deposited on the ZnO NW substrate by employing the SILAR approach to produce so-called core–shell NWAs (Fig. 1c).14b,24 Briefly, the NW substrate was dipped into a AgNO3 ethanol solution and a Na2S methanol solution, separately, and thereafter washed with ethanol at room temperature. The two step dipped procedures formed one SILAR cycle. As to increase the amount of QDs loading on NWs, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 SILAR cycles were repeated, which are termed as Ag2S2, Ag2S4, Ag2S6, Ag2S8, and Ag2S10, respectively. It is notable that the Eg of QDs is affected by the QD size that the larger QD has narrower Eg.4b,21 The conducting polymer P3HT was used as the hole transporter, and the P3HT was deposited by spin coating a P3HT chlorobenzene solution on the top of the core–shell NWAs. Finally, a top Au electrode with a thickness of ∼80 nm was deposited by thermal evaporation on the P3HT layer forming the complete device (Fig. 1d).

Characterization of the core–shell NWAs

Fig. 2 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ZnO NWAs and ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs. The ZnO NP seed layer with a thickness of ∼100 nm was firstly prepared on a FTO substrate (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1, ESI†). The size of the seeds is 10–15 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†), which is critical for the growth of NWs, as described above. The seed layer worked not only for the growth of NWs, but also blocked the direct contact between the hole transporter P3HT with the FTO substrate diminishing the electron recombination at this interface. After 6 h growth, the length of the NWs was ∼800 nm, and a length of 3.2 μm was obtained after 24 h growth (Fig. 2b). It should be noted that the NW length not only depends on growth hours, but also depends on solution concentration, temperature, and growth area per solution volume.25 At high solution concentration and temperature, the NW length can reach several micrometers for only 6 h growth,17,26 but the other parallel reactions may also exist in the solution affecting the efficiency of the growth. As to obtain uniform NWAs, the sample loading of the seeded substrate in solution was ∼5 cm2 per 25 ml growth solution, and at low solution concentration and temperature (see Experimental section). The NWs slowly grew on the seeds, and the growth almost finished after 6 h as the Zn precursor was almost consumed. Fig. 2c and d show the top view SEM images of ZnO NWAs after 24 h growth, which indicates that the NWAs were uniformly formed on the FTO substrate. The diameter of the NWs was 40–80 nm, and the array density was 12–15 billion wires per square centimetre that is somewhat lower than previously published results of 35 billion wires per square centimetre,25 which may be due to different approaches applied for the preparation of seeds. The obtained ZnO NWAs were semitransparent, as shown in the inset picture in Fig. 2c. After the Ag2S QDs were deposited on the ZnO NWs, the NWs surface became rough, which suggests that ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs were formed (Fig. 2e). Comparing ZnO NWAs with ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs, they show similar morphology that indicates that the ZnO NWAs retained their original morphology during Ag2S QDs growth on the ZnO NWs. However, the core–shell NWAs turned black from semitransparent ZnO NWAs, which is expected from the light absorption of the Ag2S QDs (inset in Fig. 2e).

(e) Low magnification and (f) high magnification of top view of ZnO@Ag2S NWAs. Inset in (d) and (e) are photographs of ZnO NWAs, and ZnO@Ag2S NWAs, respectively. 
As to obtain the finer details of the ZnO and ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the samples, which is illustrated in Fig. 3. The diameter of the ZnO NW is around 40–80 nm (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, taken from the area indicated in Fig. 3a, from which we can see that the ZnO NW is single-crystalline with growth direction in the (002) plane. This claim is well supported by the electron diffraction pattern (inset in Fig. 3b). After the Ag2S QDs were deposited on the surface of the ZnO NW, the ZnO NW surface became rough and the QD islands formed on the ZnO NW surface (Fig. 3b and c). However, with increased number of SILAR cycles, more QDs were deposited on the ZnO NW surface and the surface became smoother. Fig. 3e clearly shows that the ZnO NW was all covered with QDs resulting in ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWs after 8 SILAR cycles for QD formation. The surface of the core–shell NWs is relative rough than the ZnO NW but smoother than the surface nanostructure of the NWs with less SILAR cycles for QD formation (Fig. 3c and d). Fig. 3f shows the HRTEM image of the core–shell NWs taken from the area indicated in Fig. 3e. In the figure the layer of QDs (ellipses) is indicated, which suggests that the QD layer has a thickness of 5–10 nm.

The light harvesting properties of the core–shell NWAs with various SILAR cycles for QD formation were investigated using light absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 4a shows the light absorption spectra of ZnO NWAs and ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs. In comparison with the ZnO NWAs, significantly increased light absorption in the visible-near infrared region of 350–1000 nm was observed. Furthermore, the light absorption of core–shell NWAs is improving with more SILAR cycles for QD formation. With more SILAR cycles, more Ag2S QDs were grown on ZnO NWs as a result of enrichment of the diameter and density of QDs. Moreover, the ZnO NWs or core–shell NWs were not vertical to the FTO substrates, as shown in Fig. 2d and f, which increases the light scattering and pathway of the incident light travelling in the NWA film (Fig. S3, ESI†).27 The Eg of QDs is affected by the dimension of QDs and bigger QDs exhibit narrower Eg and possibly a lower conduction band level, which may reduce the electron injection from the QD into the electron acceptor.28 The Eg decreased from 1.41 eV to 1.27 as the SILAR cycles increased from 4 cycles to 10 cycles.14b When the Ag2S QDs have a Eg of ∼1.23 eV, the QD size is around 6–12 nm.14a The Ag2S QDs deposited after 8 SILAR cycles have a Eg of ∼1.31 eV, corresponding to a size of 5–7 nm (Fig. 3f). Robel et al. found that when the size of PbS QDs was larger than 4.8 nm, the electron injection was not expected because of narrowed Eg.4b Therefore, although SILAR technology is a good approach to directly deposit QDs on substrates for photovoltaic or other optoelectronic device construction, it should be balanced between controlling the Eg of QDs and the amount of QDs loaded on the substrate.

Structure characterization of the ZnO NWAs and core–shell NWAs on FTO substrates was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 4b shows XRD patterns of the FTO substrate, ZnO NWAs, and ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs, respectively. The FTO substrate showed a tetragonal crystal structure of SnO2 (ICDD-PDF No. 00-046-1088). After ZnO NWs were grown on the FTO substrate, the diffraction peaks of SnO2 decreased and new peaks appeared at diffraction angle 2θ of 32°, 34.5°, 36.3°, and 63° that corresponds to the (100), (002), (101), and (103) planes of the hexagonal crystal structure of ZnO (ICDD-PDF No. 00-036-1451). In addition to the diffraction peaks pertaining to the FTO substrate and ZnO, the other peaks in the XRD pattern are attributed to the acanthite crystal of Ag2S (ICDD-PDF No. 00-014-0072) after loading of QDs on ZnO NWs to obtain the core–shell NWAs. The diffraction peaks at 26.5°, 29°, 37.8°, and 43.5° correspond to the (012), (111), (−103), and (031) planes of the acanthite crystal of Ag2S, respectively. We also found that the diffraction peak intensity ncreased with more SILAR cycles for QD formation, which also indicated that more QDs were deposited on the ZnO NWs. The diffraction peak intensity of ZnO shows a little decrease after depositing Ag2S QDs because the ZnO NWs were covered with Ag2S.
Performance of solid-state photovoltaic devices

Fig. 5a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the solid-state devices based on the core–shell NWA photoanodes with various SILAR cycles for QD formation. The J–V characterization was performed under AM 1.5G of 100 mW cm−2 illumination provided by a solar simulator, and the J–V characteristic results are summarized in Table 1. Comparing the devices with different SILAR cycles, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was observed to increase as the SILAR cycles increased from 2 to 8 cycles. With more SILAR cycles for QD formation, more surface area of ZnO NWs was coated with QDs, which may result in reduced recombination of photogenerated electrons from ZnO to the hole transporter (P3HT). A similar effect was also observed by other researchers for liquid-state QDSSCs,29 and this phenomenon is generally obtained in DSSCs with increased dye coverage, due to the decrease of the TiO2–electrolyte contact surface area, resulting in higher Voc.30 Moreover, with the number of SILAR cycles increased from 2 to 8 cycles, the short circuit current (Jsc) increases, which is a result of more QDs loaded on ZnO NWs increasing the light absorption and thereby increasing the number of photogenerated charges. The device with 8 SILAR cycles for QD formation exhibited a Jsc of 2.021 mA cm−2 and a η of 0.363%. The low FF may result from the high recombination and high series resistance in the solid state solar cells.31

However, if even more SILAR cycles were repeated, such as 10 cycles, both Jsc and η decreased, which is possibly due to that the electron injection efficiency may decrease with narrowed Eg of QDs, which was found for other QD sensitized devices as discussed above.28b,31 Wu et al. obtained a Jsc of 13.7 mA cm−2 for Ag2S QDSSCs with a liquid electrolyte, and a η of 0.49% was observed.19d Hwang et al. obtained a Jsc of 11.3 mA cm−2 and a η of 1.2% for Ag2S QDSSCs with a liquid electrolyte, and furthermore the Jsc was up to 27.6 mA cm−2 and the η of 2.4% after co-sensitized with Ag2S and CdS QDs.19a These results suggest that the low toxic Ag2S QDs are promising materials for fabrication of high efficiency photovoltaic devices. However, the liquid-state device may suffer from the stability and electrolyte leakage, which may not appear in a completely solid-state device.
We also compared with the performance of Ag2S QDSSCs based on TiO2 NPs-based photoanodes (named as NP@Ag2S8) and the J–V curve is also plotted in Fig. 5a and the results are summarized in Table 1 to compare with the core–shell NWA devices. The photocurrent density is lower than for the core–shell NWAs device even though they have the same number of SILAR cycles for QD formation. The lower photocurrent for the device with the TiO2 NPs-based photoanode may be attributed to that the ZnO has higher charge mobility than TiO2, and that the NW may work as a direct pathway for photogenerated electrons from the QD to the electrode contact, and this suggestion is further investigated by electron transport measurements below. Moreover the lifetime of the photogenerated charges is important for the collection of charges at the electrodes before recombination, and the electron lifetime is therefore also compared for the different devices below. In addition, an organic hole conducting polymer with high molecular weight, such as P3HT, may not completely fill all the pores in the mesoporous TiO2 NPs film from the top surface to bottom (Fig. 6a). The structure of the NWA may be more advantageous for better infiltration of the hole conducting polymer (Fig. 6b), also leading to better charge collection.

The reason for solid-state QDSSCs exhibiting lower performance than liquid-state QDSSCs can be explained by considering a combination of several effects. Firstly, the solid-state device has a much thinner photoanode film. The photoanode thickness affects the amount of QDs loaded on the photoanode and the photoanode thickness of the liquid-state device could reach more than 10 μm.17,30 The solid-state device has only an around 2 μm thick photoanode due to that the organic hole conductor with high molecular weight is difficult to infiltrate in a thicker photoanode. Secondly, the liquid electrolyte has better conductivity, which can also be adjusted by controlling the electrolyte composition and concentration. The photogenerated hole can be efficiently scavenged by the sulfide/polysulfide redox couple in the liquid-state device.32 Thirdly, the surface engineering between organic hole transporters and inorganic semiconductor QDs significantly affects the hole transfer from the QD to the hole transport material. The self-assembled monolayer with a short molecular chain, such as phosphoric acid head group, on the QD can increase the interaction between the QD and the organic hole transport material for enhanced performance.28a The interaction between the QD and the hole transport material also affects the recombination of the photogenerated charges, and the recombination in solid state devices is generally quicker compared to their liquid electrolyte analogs, also limiting the thickness of the solid state device.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the solid-state QDSSC with the core–shell NWAs as the photoanode is shown in Fig. 5b. The light absorption was also re-plotted for comparison. The IPCE spectrum shows a broad peak over the range of 330–800 nm and lower IPCE in the range of 800–1100 nm, which is in agreement with the light absorption spectrum plotted in the same figure. The solar cell without QDs that only contains NWA and P3HT was also fabricated for comparison, and the IPCE spectrum indicates that there was some contribution to the photocurrent from P3HT between 410 and 650 nm, but it is still very low (Fig. S4, ESI†). Compared with widely studied CdS, and CdSe QD-sensitized photoanodes with absorption wavelength ranging from 400 to 550 nm, and to ∼600 nm, respectively,28b the ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs photoanode here exhibits a wider absorptive range. Hwang et al. also found the IPCE spectrum of liquid-state Ag2S QDSSCs covering a wavelength range of 400–1100 nm.19a These results suggest that the core–shell NWAs are promising light harvesting candidates to harvest sunlight from the visible to near infrared range.
Effect of NW length on electron collection
Below, the electron lifetime (τe, also called recombination time of the photogenerated charges) and transport time (τtr) were compared for the devices with NWA and NP photoanodes, respectively. Measuring the photovoltage decay after a decrease in the light intensity offers information about the recombination processes in the device. The photovoltage decay is often described in terms of electron lifetime at a given light intensity and a longer electron lifetime indicates slower recombination of the photogenerated charges in the device. In the measurement Voc of the device is monitored as a function of time when the light source is modulated with a small perturbation on top of a steady white light intensity. The electron lifetime is calculated from the decay of the Voc transient using the following equation:1a (1)Fig. 7a shows the electron lifetime dependency on Voc for the devices with NWAs, and NPs photoanodes, respectively. Different Voc were obtained under different light intensity illumination. Comparing the NWA and NP based devices, the device with the NWA photoanode shows a slightly longer τe, which suggests that slower recombination was observed in this device. Compared with solid-state DSSCs with a τe of ∼10−3 s,20 the solid-state QDSSC shows longer τe which suggests that the solid-state QDSSC exhibits slower recombination. The photocurrent response time was determined under short-circuit conditions obtained under different light intensity illumination. The measured photocurrent response time is usually much shorter than τe and therefore the measured photocurrent response time is related to the transport time of electrons (τtr) in the photoanode.1aFig. 7b shows the measured photocurrent response in NWA and NP photoanodes, respectively. As expected, the NWAs photoanode exhibited shorter τtr which suggests that the NWA photoanode shows better electron transportation compared to the NP based device.33 Better electron transportation within the NWA photoanode may be a combination of high crystallinity of the ZnO NW and possibly an internal electric field that can assist carrier collection by separating the injected electron from the surrounding medium, such as an electrolyte or an organic hole conductor, and sweep them toward the collector electrode. Law et al. reported that the ZnO NW with a length of 4 nm can hold a carrier concentration of 1018 cm−3,25 enabling the ZnO NW to support the sort of radial electric field (depletion layer) that is impossible in TiO2 or ZnO NPs with fewer carriers. The axial field along each NW may therefore affect the transportation of electrons in these solar cells.

Inset in (b) is τtr as a function of NW length at 1 sun of illumination. (c) J–V curves of the core–shell NWAs device with different NW lengths. (d) Device efficiency as a function of NW length. 
Previous publications reported that the NW has higher electron diffusion and collection efficiency,34 but the NW length may also affect the device performance. As to optimize the device performance, the electron transport time in the NWA photoanode with a NW length of 0.8–3.2 μm was compared (Fig. S5, ESI†). The τtr was affected by the NW length and the device based on longer NW needed relatively long time to transport the photogenerated electrons to the collector electrode (inset Fig. 7b), which is in good agreement with our previously published results on ZnO NW based solar cells.35

J–V characteristic curves of the devices with different NW lengths are present in Fig. 7c and the corresponding characteristic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Theoretically, NWA based devices with longer NWs offered more surface area for QD deposition, which should result in higher Jsc and η. However, the device with longest NWs did not show better performance, as monitored in Fig. 7c and Fig. S6 (ESI†), which is due to longer τtr measured for the longest NW photoanodes. The longer transport time increases the possibility for recombination of the photogenerated charges before reaching the contacts (inset, Fig. 7b). Therefore longer NWs also lead to increased electron–hole recombination, decreasing the electron collection efficiency. From the above results, the device with a NW length of 1.6 μm showed the best performance (Fig. 7d and Table 2). For solid-state perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells, the device with a NW length of 1 μm exhibited the best performance resulting due to similar reasons.35

Carrier transportation in the photovoltaic devices
As to better understand the carrier transportation in the NWA devices, a schematic energy level and carrier transportation diagram is shown in Fig. 8. After the incident photon is captured by the QD, a photogenerated electron–hole pair is produced and firstly confined within the QD. The photoexcited electron can be injected into the ZnO NW or may also transfer to the neighboring QD. The morphology and defects of the electron acceptor ZnO NW may affect the capability of light harvesting and electron injection.16c,19d For example the electron injection driving force (ΔG) is influenced by morphology-dependent dielectric properties of the metal oxide electron acceptor through Coulombic interaction.36 ΔG shows a difference of 100 meV between the ZnO NW and ZnO NP photoanodes, which suggests that the morphology of the electron acceptor can significantly tune the driving force of charge injection. Zheng et al. reported that the ZnO NW had relatively high injection rates than the ZnO NP acceptor due to additional band edge states in the ZnO NW.37 Meanwhile, a more pronounced degree of surface disorder in NWs also affects the electron injection and collection. As a natural consequence of solution phase growth at low temperature, the hydrothermally grown NW has a large number of defects including surface hydroxyl groups and excessive Zn(OH)2, which induced the hydrolysis process during NW growth. These surface defects will also affect light harvesting and induce electron surface trapping, or electron relaxation, and quick electron–hole recombination may therefore also coexist with efficient electron injection into the ZnO NWs. The photogenerated electron injection rate is usually ultrafast, and the bottleneck for carrier transport in the device is electron transport in the photoanode.1a For example the electron injection time from the CdSe QD into the ZnO NW is around the picosecond time scale, which is much faster than the electron transport within the NW.37 Therefore, enhancing the electron transportation in the photoanode may be an important approach to enhance the device performance as shown in this study.
 Fig. 8  Schematic energy level and carrier transport diagram in the NWAs device. The energy levels were taken from ref. 14a and 19a. 
Although more Ag2S QDs were deposited on ZnO NWs with more SILAR cycles, the decreased Eg leads to lower ΔG, which may result in lower electron injection efficiency. The lowest ΔG for efficient electron transfer from QDs to ZnO NWs is not clear. Žídek et al. demonstrated electron injected from CdSe QDs into ZnO NWs via an intermediated charge transfer state, and the transfer time was in the range of 40–200 ps for the QD with a size of 2.5–3.1 nm.18b Electron transfer from QDs into ZnO with high electron mobility and permittivity is interesting and also of significant importance for the utilization of multiple excitons of QDs to fabricate high efficiency photovoltaic devices. Although these investigations are out of the scope of this paper, the electron transfer between Ag2S and the ZnO NW will be investigated in our future research.
After the electron is injected into the ZnO NW from the Ag2S QD, the electron may be transported through the conduction band of ZnO (dashed arrow in Fig. 8). For a typically NP-based photoanode, it is assumed that most of the electrons are trapped in states distributed over a range of energies. Electron transport in the photoanode is suggested to occur by thermal detrapping, followed by rapid movement through the conduction band until the next trapping event occurs.38 Multiple trapping/detrapping does not seem to occur in the ZnO NW, which may be attributed to the high crystallinity and good electron mobility.39
Although the solid-state QDSSC with ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs as the photoanode showed more than 2 mA cm−2 photocurrent density, the efficiency is relatively low compared with that of other solid-state QDSSCs.12,22 The Voc is lower than the theoretical value, which may be due to recombination of charges or unfavourable interface electronic or molecular structure between the different materials. Moreover, the ZnO NW shows a relatively less surface area for QD loading compared with the NP mesoporous photoanode, which decreases the light harvesting efficiency. However, this study shows the possibility for increased performance of devices based on a NW approach, and for example branched NWs provide more surfaces for dye molecular anchoring,17 which may also be applied to increase the amount of QDs on the photoanode still retaining the advantageous electron transport properties of the NWs.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated an environmentally friendly solid-state QDSSC using ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs as the photoanode in combination with the conducting polymer P3HT. High conductivity ZnO NWAs were grown on FTO substrates, and Ag2S QDs were successfully deposited on the ZnO NWs forming core–shell nanostructures. The number of SILAR cycles and NW length significantly affected the device performance. The best performance was obtained with 8 SILAR cycles for QD formation and a NW length of ∼1.6 μm. Compared with a device with a TiO2 NP photoanode, the performance of the NWA device was higher. The enhanced performance resulted from enhanced collection of photogenerated electrons suggesting that the ZnO NW works as a direct pathway transporting the photogenerated electrons from the QDs to the collector electrode. The results therefore suggest that ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs may be a promising material for photovoltaic or other optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals except the TiO2 paste were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any other purification. TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 30 NRT) was purchased from Dyesol Company. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass TEC15 was purchased from Pilkington.
Preparation of ZnO NWAs
ZnO NW arrays were synthesized using a hydrothermal growth method modified from ref. 19b and 26. The ZnO nanoparticle seed layer was prepared by doctoral blading of a zinc nitrate ethanol solution (0.1 M) on a FTO glass substrate and subsequent annealing on a hotplate at 350 °C for 20 min under an air atmosphere to yield a layer of ZnO nano seeds. The seeded FTO substrate was immersed into a solution of zinc nitrate (12 mM), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, 12 mM) and polyethylenimine (PEI, branched, 4 mM) and placed in an oven at a temperature of 90 °C for 6 h. Then the sample was washed with deionized water and ethanol. As to obtain different NW lengths, the sample was again placed into a fresh solution for another round of 6 h growth. The growth time was 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h, separately, providing ZnO NWAs with various NW lengths. After growth, the sample was then rinsed with deionized water and ethanol and again annealed at 350 °C for 30 min to remove any residual organics and increase crystallinity. The TiO2 NPs photoanode was prepared by spin coating a TiO2 paste on a FTO substrate, and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min according to our previous report.20
Preparation of ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWAs
The SILAR method was employed to grow Ag2S QDs on the ZnO NWAs substrate according to ref. 24. Briefly, the ZnO NWA substrate was immersed into 0.1 M AgNO3 ethanol solution for 3 min, and then rinsed with ethanol to remove the excess precursor. Then, the ZnO NWA substrate was immersed into 0.1 M Na2S methanol solution for another 3 min and rinsed with methanol. The above procedures formed one SILAR cycle. Such a SILAR cycle was repeated from 2 to10 times. The sample became darker as the number of SILAR cycles increased. After completing the SILAR cycles, the sample was thoroughly washed with ethanol to remove excess precursor, and dried with N2.
Assembly of the solid-state solar cell
The ZnO@Ag2S core–shell NWA photoanode was immersed in 1 mM decylphosphonic acid (DPA) ethanol solution for 40 min at room temperature and thereafter washed with acetonitrile and dried with N2. The P3HT chlorobenzene solution (20 mg ml−1) was spin-coated onto the top surface of the core–shell NWA photoanode with 2500 rpm for 30 s. Then the sample was placed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 20 min under a N2 atmosphere. Finally, a Au counter electrode with a thickness of ∼80 nm was deposited on the P3HT layer using a thermal evaporator (LEICA EM MED020) in a vacuum of 3 × 10−5 Torr, forming the completely solid-state device.
Materials characterization
Light absorption spectra were measured using an Ocean Optics HR2000 spectrometer with a Micropack DH-2000-BAL light source, and the FTO glass substrate was used as the reference. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a diffractometer D5000 (SIEMENS) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154059 nm) for diffraction angle 2θ in the range of 10–70°. SEM images were collected using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss LEO1550) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. TEM and HRTEM images were obtained by using a transmission electron microscope (JSM, 2100) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples for TEM measurements were prepared by scraping the ZnO NWs and the core–shell NWs from FTO glass and dispersed in ethanol under ultrasonic dispersion. The corresponding solution was dropped onto a carbon film supported by a copper grid, followed by slow evaporation of the solvent under ambient conditions.
Photovoltaic characterization
The J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley model 2400 source measurement unit. A Newport solar simulator (model 91160) was used to provide a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 illumination (1 sun) that was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). A black mask with an aperture of 0.5 cm × 0.4 cm was used in order to avoid significant additional contribution from light impinging on the device outside the active area. IPCE measurement was performed according to our previous report.40 IPCE spectra were recorded using a computer-controlled setup consisting of a xenon lamp (Spectral Products ASBXE 175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110), and a potentiostat (EG&G PAR 273), calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) prior to measurement. Electron lifetime and transport time measurement were performed according to a previously reported method.1a,20,40 Briefly, a white LED lamp (Luxeon Star 1 W) was used as the light source for the measurement. Both voltage and current traces were recorded with a 16 bit resolution digital acquisition board in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research System SR570) and a custom-made system using electromagnetic switches. Before measurement, the light intensity was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). Electron lifetime and transport time were determined by monitoring photocurrent and photovoltage transients at different light intensities upon applying a small square wave modulation to the base light intensity. The square wave modulation of less than 10% at 1 Hz was employed for measurement. The photocurrent and photovoltage responses were fitted using first-order kinetics to obtain the time constants.
