    , Accepted 8th September 2021First published on 9th September 2021AbstractBy introducing two amino groups in the central core of well-recognized small molecule acceptor F8IC for triggering a further intramolecular cyclization, a fully fused molecule DFA4 was realized. It exhibits typical n-type semiconductive character in devices of both organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Moreover, the thermal stability of DFA4 was drastically enhanced compared with F8IC, suggesting its strong potential in fabricating organic electronics with longer lifetime.
Organic semiconductors, with rationally designed chemical structures and photo-electronic functionalities, have been intensively investigated to fabricate various optoelectronic devices including organic photovoltaics (OPVs),1–4 chemical/biological sensors,5–7 organic field effect transistors (OFETs),8–10 and so on. The n-type organic semiconductors, which conduct electrons and possess a low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), have been developed on the basis of electron-deficient π-conjugated units. However, due to the scarcity of molecular engineering in terms of charge-carrier mobility and environmental stability, the development of n-type organic semiconductors lags behind that of p-type ones.11–13 To further improve the performance and stability of such n-type organic electronic devices, the exploration of new building blocks for making novel materials is pivotal.
In recent years, n-type organic semiconductors have re-gained their popularity due to the increase of fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Featuring a fused electron-rich central cyclic core and electron-deficient flanks, these newly developed n-type organic semiconductors brought a skyrocketing improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and have therefore garnered enormous attention.14–22 Not only playing an important role in OPVs, FREAs also demonstrate their great potentiality in photodetectors,23 perovskite solar cells (PSCs),24 solution processable OFETs,25etc. Unfortunately, although FREAs exhibit superior performance, it has been revealed that their intrinsic stability is not satisfactory.
Currently, most high-performance FREAs are end-capped by 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (INCN) derived terminal groups (Fig. 1).26–28 The exocyclic double bonds formed by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction that connect the electron-rich core and INCN derived terminal groups can be readily decomposed by basic/acidic chemicals or ZnO-catalyzed photochemical reactions, which usually leads to burn-in with rapidly declined device parameters (e.g. fill factor or open-circuit voltage of OPVs).29,30 To improve the stability of INCN based NFAs and the lifetime of the corresponding devices, many attempts have been made to decrease the acid/base induced photo-degradation of NFAs from the perspective of interfacial engineering.31–35 However, as designing highly stable NFA molecules is a more direct and effective solution, very limited cases have been reported so far.36–38
 Fig. 1  Chemical structure of F8IC and the derived molecule DFA4. 
In this contribution, we present a new kind of n-type organic semiconductor, namely DFA4, derived from classic FREA F8IC (Fig. 1).39 To tackle the instability problem of two exocyclic double bonds, our design strategy is firstly introducing two amino groups to the central electron-rich fused ring core and secondly triggering an intramolecular cyclization to form a fully-fused molecule backbone. By modifying such a F8IC molecule, a tetradecacyclic molecule DFA4 was obtained. Compared with F8IC, DFA4 has a broadened bandgap and also exhibits typical n-type semiconductive character in devices of both OPVs and OFETs.
The synthetic procedure of DFA4 is depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The brominated carbaldehyde of fused tris(thienothiophene) (TTT) (2) was prepared by base-promoted halogen migration of dibrominated reactant 1, followed by quenching with DMF with successful formation of aldehyde functionality. Then, the final product DFA4 was synthesized via a one-pot reaction with three continuous steps: firstly, bromine atoms were replaced with azide groups via a nucleophilic reaction; secondly, a Staudinger reduction was performed to convert the azide groups into amino ones; finally, difluorinated INCN (IN2F) was attached to the TTT core via Knoevenagel condensation/amino-ketone condensation reaction to yield DFA4. Due to the instability of the organic azide and the amino-aldehyde of TTT, we chose to use these two kinds of intermediates without purification rather than isolate them. The high-purity DFA4 was characterized by 1H, 13C and 19F NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (see the ESI†). It can be found that the yield of the 3-step continuous reaction is extremely low (<10%). This might be attributed to the high reactivity of non-isolated intermediates, especially the amino-aldehyde. We are still optimizing the synthetic routes towards DFA4 in the hopes of greatly increasing the total yield.
In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. 2d) shows that DFA4 exhibits extraordinary thermal stability and decomposes (5% loss) only above 426 °C (vs. 351 °C for F8IC).

The photophysical properties of DFA4 were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2a, the diluted chloroform solution of DFA4 shows an unusual light harvesting profile containing triple absorption bands that locate at ca. 285, 481, and 704 nm, respectively, and cover the range from the UV region to ca. 803 nm (taking “normalized absorbance weaker than 0.1” as the threshold). While for its thin film, the main absorption band not only notably red-shifted from ca. 704 to 756 nm, but also was significantly extended, giving the corresponding optical bandgap of DFA4 around 1.40 eV (vs. 1.27 eV for F8IC). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the molecular orbital energy levels of DFA4. The film of DFA4 on a glassy-carbon electrode was characterized in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 2b, the oxidation/reduction potential of DFA4 determined by CV was 1.08 and −0.60 V, respectively, indicating that the corresponding energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO was −5.56 and −3.88 eV, respectively.
Compared with the reference FREA F8IC, it can be seen that although containing a more extended π-backbone, DFA4 has a higher LUMO level and deeper HOMO level, resulting in a much broadened optical bandgap (Fig. S5 and Table S3, ESI†). To better understand how this fully fused structure of DFA4 effects its photo-physical and electrochemical properties, theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) to further investigate the structure on the molecular level.40 As Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows, two features of the spectrum of DFA4 that differed from F8IC are well captured by the simulation: the blue shift of the absorption maximum above 600 nm and the elevated molar absorption coefficient at around ca. 500 and 350 nm. To find the origin of these two features, the excited states information with oscillator strength greater than 0.2 was presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The absorption maximum for both DFA4 and F8IC corresponds to the first singlet state (S1) which is mainly the HOMO–LUMO transition. The calculated HOMO–LUMO levels and distribution are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Apparently, DFA4 has a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap and a more localized HOMO–LUMO distribution than F8IC does. This could be explained in terms of the aromatic bridge (fused 6-member ring) between the electron-donating core (D) and IN2F groups (A). The unique fused ring bridge could weaken the DHOMO–AHOMO and DLUMO–ALUMO interaction, but enhance the DHOMO–ALUMO one, which leads to localized orbitals and an increased gap. Moreover, the fused ring bridge is also responsible for the large oscillator strength of the S3 and S14 state of DFA4. The hole–electron distribution of these excited states is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The S3 state, which corresponds to the absorption band around 500 nm, is a charge transfer (CT) state partially through the nitrogen path (pyridine ring) of the fused ring, which does not exist in F8IC. The S14 state, which leads to the enhanced absorption around 350 nm, is a locally excited (LE) state of the acceptor, its enhanced oscillator strength may be attributed to its localized LUMO distribution.
To inspect the optoelectronic performance of this new material, OFETs and OPVs were fabricated and characterized, respectively. Bottom-gate bottom-contact OFETs were fabricated to investigate the charge carrier transport of DFA4, which exhibits electron transport in an inert atmosphere. DFA4 shows maximum hole and electron mobility of 1.5 × 10−3 and 8.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In the positive drain mode for a source-drain voltage (Vd) of 60 V (Fig. 3a), the crossover point for gate voltage Vg was located at 30 V. This indicates a change from hole-domain to electron-domain operation. Above this gate voltage, the transistor showed typical electron transport due to sufficient electron accumulation. In the negative regime (Vd = −60 V), the holes dominated the conducting channel from approximately Vg = −30 V, which represents almost the symmetrical crossover point with the channel in the positive drain mode.

As for the OPV devices of DFA4, PM7 was finally adopted based on screening most compatible polymer donors (P3HT, PTB7-Th, PBDB-T, etc.). For the PM7:DFA4 combination, devices with conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Ag were fabricated (with an active area of 0.1 cm2). The current density–voltage (J–V) curve and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the optimized devices are depicted in Fig. 4. In the champion device, a PCE of 7.73% was realized along with a VOC up to 0.87 V, a JSC of 13.30 mA cm−2, and an FF of 66.70%. The optimization process can be found in the ESI† (Section 8, Tables S5–S9).

The charge separation in the OSC devices was investigated by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. S9a, ESI†).41 The exciton dissociation probability calculated from Jph/Jsat under short circuiting of PM7:DFA4 based OSCs, is 0.906, indicating that an efficient exciton dissociation occurred in devices. The bimolecular recombiantion features of the optimized devices were also examined qualitatively by probing the incident light intensity dependency of the J–V characteristics (Fig. S9b and c, ESI†).42,43 It is noted that the α values of 0.977 were fitted for the devices of PM7:DFA4, and this value suggested that the devices underwent moderate bimolecular recombination; on the other hand, the device of PM7:DFA4 shows an n value of 1.31 which is directly correlated to the trap assisted recombination. So it can be seen that the trap assisted recombination is the major recombination channel in devices of PM7:DFA4.44–46 The carrier mobility was fitted from the dark J–V curves using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. As Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows, the hole- (μh) and electron-mobilities (μe) of the PM7:DFA4 blend are 2.9 × 10−4 and 3.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The imbalanced μh/μe value (9.7) of the PM7:DFA4 based device might be attributed to the relatively poor miscibility of PM7 and DFA4 (Fig. S6 and Table S4, ESI†), consequently leading to inferior JSC.
For a further in-depth characteristic investigation on the active layer, we performed 2D X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on the spin-coated films to investigate the molecular packing of sole PM7/DFA4 and blend components. As shown in Fig. 5a, DFA4 neat film exhibits typical face-on π–π stacking with a narrow angular distribution. To quantify the stacking property, line cutting profiles were collected in Fig. S13 (ESI†). In neat films, compared with its semi-fused counterpart F8IC, DFA4 stacks with a closer π–π interplanar spacing (3.54 Å vs. 3.59 Å) and generates a larger crystalline coherence length (CCL) of 34.02 Å than 26.45 Å of F8IC. However, in blend films, the stacking properties are completely different. For the PM7:DFA4 blend, the interplanar spacing has increased to 3.56 Å and CCL has decreased to 18.67 Å; both parameters are inferior to its PM7:F8IC counterpart (3.50 Å of π–π spacing and 30.87 of CCL). Such a crystallization behaviour can be attributed to the poor miscibility of PM7 and DFA4.47

In summary, a new n-type organic semiconductor with a fully fused tetradecacyclic π-backbone that is derived from classic FREA F8IC was designed and successfully synthesized. The OFETs based on DFA4 reached mobilities of 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and 8.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons. After being employed in OPVs with polymer donor PM7, a PCE of 7.73% with VOC of 0.87 V and JSC of 13.30 mA cm−2 was achieved. This research paves a brand new pathway in the molecular design of novel electron acceptors with dramatically improved thermal stability. More work on the device optimization and molecular modification of DFA4 is ongoing.
