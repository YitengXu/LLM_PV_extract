    , Accepted 16th May 2019First published on 22nd May 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskites show great promise in optoelectronic applications such as light-emitting diodes and solar energy conversion. However, the poor stability and toxicity of lead halide perovskites severely limit their large-scale applications. Here we show a high-throughput design of lead-free hybrid halide semiconductors with robust materials stability and desired material properties beyond perovskites. On the basis of 24 prototype structures that include perovskite and non-perovskite structures and several typical organic cations, a comprehensive quantum materials repository that contains 4507 hypothetical hybrid compounds was built using large-scale first-principles calculations. After a high-throughput screening of this repository, we have rapidly identified 23 candidates for light-emitting diodes and 13 candidates for solar energy conversion. Our work demonstrates a new avenue to design novel organic–inorganic functional materials by exploring a great variety of prototype structures.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites are promising for the next-generation solar cells and light-emitting applications because of their exceptional optoelectronic properties and low-temperature solution processability. However, this class of materials are facing two major challenges including intrinsic poor stability and the presence of toxic lead for their practical applications. To overcome these challenges, great efforts are being devoted to the development of tin-based perovskites and double perovskites, as well as new approaches to protect devices like using encapsulation. In this work, instead of focusing on perovskites, we present a powerful approach to search for novel lead-free hybrid halide semiconductors beyond perovskites from a large variety of prototype structures using high-throughput computations and data-mining techniques. 23 candidates for light-emitting diodes and 13 candidates for solar cells were rapidly identified. All these candidates show appropriate electronic properties and robust stability from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This work demonstrates a new pathway for the large-scale design of novel organic–inorganic optoelectronic materials at a high speed by exploring a large variety of prototype structures. It is important to highlight that this approach is transformative to the discovery of other types of functional materials.

1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites with a prototypical formula of MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) are one emerging class of semiconductor materials with promising optoelectronic applications including solar energy conversion and light-emitting diodes.1,2 This is mainly attributed to their excellent materials properties such as tunable band gaps,3 high charge carrier mobility,4 defect tolerance,5 and low-temperature solution processability.6 In spite of their promising optoelectronic applications, particularly for solar energy conversion, the hybrid lead halide perovskites are facing two major challenges including poor stability and presence of toxic lead, which limits their large-scale applications.7,8 To overcome these challenges, one solution is to search for novel hybrid materials with potentially superior properties beyond or like those of lead-based hybrid halide perovskites.
Some prior experimental and computational efforts both have been made to explore alternatives to lead halide perovskites. There are two major classes of candidates that are being extensively studied. One class of candidates are Ge- and Sn-based halide perovskites with various organic cations, but these materials usually have even lower stability than lead halide perovskites.9 To enhance stability of Sn-based perovskites, some experimental approaches such as the fabrication of low-dimensional structures10 and the encapsulation of device11 have been proposed. In addition to Ge and Sn, Si mixed with other cations such as Ca/Si and Zn/Si with different ratios were also tried.12 The other class of candidates are called double perovskites with a chemical formula A2BB′X6 (A = Cs or organic cations; X = Cl, Br, or I), which can be regarded as derivatives of single perovskite MAPbX3 but with Pb replaced by two different metal cations (B = B+; B′ = B3+).13–19 Early experimental demonstration of double perovskites for optoelectronics include Cs-based inorganic double perovskites with Ag–Bi composition13–15 and the MA-based hybrid double perovskite with K–Bi composition.16 Nevertheless, most double perovskites that are predicted to have good electronic properties often suffer from instability issues such as phase separation or redox decomposition, e.g., Cs2InBiCl6 and Cs2InSbCl6,20 while double perovskites that can be synthesized usually show large indirect band gaps.13–16 Despite this, extensive research efforts are being made to search for novel double perovskites with desired electronic properties and high stability, such as using high-throughput materials design approach,17–19 towards lead-free perovskite optoelectronics.21–23
Notably, these prior efforts primarily focused on the single perovskite structure with a stoichiometry of 1:1:3 or on the double perovskite with a stoichiometry of 2:1:1:6. Besides perovskite structures, there exist in principles other organic–inorganic hybrid ternary metal halide compounds with appropriate metal elements and the stoichiometry of component elements that are more stable and even show better optoelectronic properties than the typical perovskite structures.24 As a proof of concept, Sb-based hybrid ternary compound, (MA)3Sb2ClxI9−x, has been prepared, and the solar cell based on this material reached a power conversion efficiency over 2%;25 the ternary silver bismuth iodides showed tunable optoelectronic properties upon sulfide modification for photovoltaics.26 Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore non-perovskite ternary structures for searching for alternatives to lead halide perovskites.
In this work, we have carried out a high-throughput computational design of novel lead-free organic–inorganic ternary halide semiconductors for optoelectronic applications using large-scale first-principles electronic structure calculations and have successfully identified 13 candidates for photovoltaic applications and 23 candidates for light-emitting applications. The chemical formulas of selected candidates include A2BX4, A3B2X9, and A2BX6, in which A = MA, FA, or AD, and X = Cl, Br, or I. All these candidates have robust materials stability, appropriate band gaps, effective masses, and exciton binding energies for the optoelectronic applications.
2 Methods
The high-throughput first-principles calculations were performed using the automatic framework AFLOW27 based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).28 The projector augmented wave potentials, and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the exchange–correlation functional as parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) are used in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.29 To properly describe the long-range dispersion interactions between the organic molecules in the hybrid materials, two types of van der Waals (vdW) functionals including DFT-D330 and optB86b31 were carefully assessed for the prototype compound MASnBr3, along with the standard PBE functional. As shown in Table S1 of ESI,† our test calculations suggest that both vdW functionals give more accurate equilibrium lattice parameters than the PBE functional while the DFT-D3 method shows a better match with the experimental value than the optB86b and thus is used in our calculations. Structures are fully relaxed with a convergence tolerance of 0.01 meV per atom. k-Points grid with a separation of 0.05 Å−1 is automatically set for relaxation of different structures. Accurate charge densities and density of states are obtained in static calculations with a denser grid with a separation of 0.04 Å−1. Other computational settings such as cutoff energy are managed by the AFLOW code that also generates appropriate entries for the structural relaxation, static calculations, and the electronic band structure calculations sequentially and automatically.27 The hybrid DFT calculations within Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) formalism with 25% Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange are employed to predict accurate band gaps for the candidate compounds.32,33 The parameter of 25% HF mixing constant is derived from perturbation theory,32,33 which can generally yield close band gaps to the experiment and is appropriate for a large number and variety of hypothetical compounds.17,18
3 Results
3.1 Building repository
As the first step, we built a quantum materials repository that contains hybrid halide perovskites and perovskite derivatives. To do this, we began by identifying all possible prototype structures based on existing ternary metal halide compounds with a formula of CsxByXz from the online quantum materials databases AFLOWLIB34 and Materials Project.35 The reason for selecting Cs-contained compounds is as follows. The Cs cation has a large ionic radius that is comparable with that of the organic cations such as MA, and thus it can be readily substituted by organic cations to form organic–inorganic hybrid compounds. Note that one chemical formula may correspond to different crystal structures, and only the most stable one was selected as a prototype structure. As shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† a total number of 24 unique prototype structures were identified. Their complete structural information is listed in Table 1, including space group, ICSD number, and Pearson symbol. The unique Pearson symbol is used to denote these prototype structures. For example, the structure generated from the compound CsSnBr3 with a space group of Pmm and an ICSD number of 4071 (identified as CsSnBr3_ICSD_4071 in AFLOWLIB) is denoted using its Pearson symbol of cP5. The prototype structures cP5 and tI20 (tP10) are the cubic and tetragonal perovskites, respectively, and the others are perovskite derivatives. Note that two prototypes, CsCrI3_ICSD_23383 and CsPbI3_ICSD_161480, share the same Pearson symbol of oP20, and to distinguish them, we denote the former with oP20, and the later with oP20′.

After identifying the structure prototypes, we next generate hypothetical compounds by placing various elements in the AxByXz formula. At A site, we put relatively small organic cations, including MA (CH3NH3), FA (CH(NH2)2), AD ((CH2)2NH2),36 DMA (NH2(CH3)2), and EA (C2H5NH3). At B site, we select elements with different valence states according to the different stoichiometry of AxByXz. As shown in Table 1, there are three structure prototypes for B+, 16 prototypes for B2+, two prototypes for B3+, and three prototypes for B4+. B+-Based prototypes have two different stoichiometries (A:B:X = 1:1:2 and 1:2:3); B2+-based prototypes have four different stoichiometries (A:B:X = 1:1:3, 2:1:4, 2:3:8, and 1:2:5); B3+-based prototypes only have one stoichiometry (A:B:X = 3:2:9); and B4+-based prototypes also only have one stoichiometry (A:B:X = 2:1:6). A total number of 65 possible B-site elements with common valence states from +1 to +4 were placed in the corresponding prototypes. The X site is occupied by I, Br, or Cl ions. With the three sites combined in the 24 prototypes, a total number of 4507 hypothetical compounds were generated. The electronic structure of all the compounds is computed in a high-throughput fashion.
3.2 Screening process
In terms of optoelectronic applications like solar cells and light emitters, there are several common descriptors often used for high-throughput screening of target materials. These descriptors include band gap, charge carrier effective masses, and decomposition enthalpy. Our detailed criteria for each descriptor are discussed as below:
(i) Band gap (Eg). We obtained band gaps using DFT calculations with two different types of functionals: one is calculated with the standard GGA functional (EGGAg), and the other is calculated with the hybrid functionals (EHSEg).32 This is because the GGA functional often underestimate band gaps, thus EGGAg can only serve as a rough reference for screening; while EHSEg is much closer to the experimental value, as shown from previous calculations on halide perovskites,17,18,37 and thus it can be used to select promising compounds more accurately. For compounds that contain heavy elements with atomic number ≥72, we also incorporated spin–orbit coupling (SOC) to get more accurate Eg.38 Note that requirements for Eg are different in solar-cell and light-emitter applications. For solar cells, the light-absorbing materials can have either direct or indirect band gaps. The optimal band gap energy should be in the range from 0.8 to 2.2 eV. This range is selected according to the relationship between Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit and band gap energy.39 For light emitters, the energy of photons emitted by a light-emitting material is approximately equal to the band gap energy of the material (Ephoton = Eg + kBT/2, kBT is thermal energy). Therefore, for visible-light emission excluding short-wavelength violet light, we selected materials with EHSEg in the range from 1.65 to 3.0 eV. Note that this range partially overlap with the range required for solar cell materials. The overlap demands discrimination in exciton binding energy of the materials with Eg in 1.65–2.2 eV to decide their proper applications, which will be discussed in (vii). In terms of band gap type, direct band gaps are required for a high photon-emission efficiency.2 This is because a direct band gap greatly promotes radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs, which results in more photons emitted. In contrast, for an indirect-band gap material, radiative recombination is much less likely because phonons are required in the process.40,41 Therefore, indirect transition is detrimental to light-emitting materials. As the opposite process to the carrier-recombination and photon-emission in light-emitting materials, the light-absorption and electron-excitation process in solar-cell materials is also adversely affected by indirect transition with the same mechanism. However, the poor absorption and excitation can be compensated by increasing the thickness of absorbing layer made of indirect-band gap material, as long as the material has a long minority carrier diffusion length to guarantee carrier separation and collection across the solar cell device.41–43 For example, silicon (indirect band gap) absorbers are made much thicker than GaAs (direct band gap) absorbers to absorb more light, and long minority diffusion length of Si ensures photogenerated carriers to cross the device before recombination.
(ii) Electron and hole effective masses (me* and mh*). Small and balanced carrier effective masses are required for both solar cells and light emitters. This is because the photovoltaic and electroluminescence processes both require efficient carrier transport, which is beneficial for charge separation in solar cells and charge recombination in light emitters.44me* and mh* are calculated by fitting band structures near the band edges according to the equations: , and . That is, me* is derived from the curvature of the bottom conduction bands near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and mh* is derived from the curvature of the top valence bands near the valence band maximum (VBM). Note that the CBM (VBM) involves two reciprocal paths in the high-throughput electronic structure calculations, and only the smaller value of me* (mh*) is used as the materials descriptor for the anisotropic materials. This is because such values can best represent the charge transport potential that can be utilized in experiments.10 Meanwhile, to provide more detailed information on the effective masses near the band edges, we also listed effective masses along the major directions for the anisotropic candidates in Table S2 of the ESI.† In addition, to obtain more accurate me* and mh* for compounds containing heavy elements (atomic number ≥72), the spin–orbit coupling was included in our electronic structure calculations. In this work, a common upper limit of 1.5m0 was used as the screening criterion (me* ≤ 1.5m0, mh* ≤ 1.5m0),19 in which m0 refers to the free electron rest mass.
(iii) Formation enthalpy difference (ΔHdifff). As shown in Table 1, one stoichiometry may correspond to several different prototype structures. This means that there might exist several competing phases for the same composition in the same stoichiometry. For example, the well-known MAPbI3 corresponds to 10 hypothetical compounds as competing phases of each other. To select compounds that can be synthesized in experiments, we define ΔHdifff as the calculated formation enthalpy difference between each compound and its most energetically favorable competing phase of the same composition and stoichiometry. This is because different stoichiometries can usually be achieved by using precursors of different molar ratios when synthesizing compounds.45–48 For example, both MACdBr3 and MA2CdBr4 have been synthesized via an appropriate control of stoichiometry.49 All compounds with ΔHdifff ≤ 0.015 eV per atom were selected as synthesizable compounds. This criterion comes from the MAPbI3 example. For MAPbI3, the tetragonal perovskite (tI20) phase is often synthesized in experiments,1,50 while our calculations show that oP20′ is the structure with the lowest energy instead of tI20. tI20 for MAPbI3 has a ΔHf higher than the most stable oP20′ by ΔHdifff = 0.015 eV per atom. This indicates that compounds with such a small ΔHdifff can be experimentally synthesized.
(iv) Decomposition enthalpy (ΔHd). To ensure stability of selected compounds with respect to decomposition, ΔHd should be positive for all possible decomposition pathways. In this work, we calculated phase separation of compounds into binary products (AxByXz → AX + BXn), as well as redox decomposition pathways. The pathway with the lowest ΔHd for each compound is used to determine its stability. We set the criterion as ΔHd > 0.03 eV per f.u. to ensure relatively high stability of selected compounds.
(v) Compounds with toxic B-site elements (As, Cd, Hg, Tl, and Pb) were removed. In addition, because the compositions of our selected perovskite compounds (B = Ge/Sn/Au/Ag/Cu) have all been discovered in prior studies, we excluded all perovskites in the final list.
(vi) Structural integrity at room temperature. To evaluate room-temperature structural stability of candidate materials, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations were carried out at 300 K within the van der Waals correction using DFT-D3 method.30 The entire molecular dynamics simulation lasted 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs using the Nosé–Hoover method. The supercells of 2 × 2 × 1 unit cell for the tI14, tI18, hP14, and hP28 structures and the conventional unit cell for cF36 structure were used. As shown in Fig. 2 for two representative compounds (MA)3In2I9 and (MA)2ZrI6, the calculated total energies as a function of time during the 5 ps simulation time are oscillating within a rather narrow energy range and the selected geometrical structures at 2, 3, and 4 ps all exhibit an ordered crystalline phase, indicating their structural integrity at room temperature.55 Otherwise, the candidate materials are not stable at room temperature and will be excluded from the final list. The calculated time-dependent total energies for all the final candidate materials are shown in the Fig. S2–S6 (ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the high-throughput screening process. A total number of 4507 compounds (AxByXz, A = MA/FA/AD/EA/DMA, X = I/Br/Cl) were generated from 65 kinds of B-site elements in 24 different crystal structures. Compounds with direct band gaps in the visible spectrum range are kept for light-emitting materials, and compounds with band gaps in 0.8–2.2 eV are kept for solar-cell materials. Compounds with effective masses greater than 1.5m0 are excluded. Compounds with a formation enthalpy higher than its most energetically favorable competing phase by a value greater than 0.015 eV per atom are excluded. Compounds containing toxic B-site elements are also excluded. Compounds that cannot maintain structural integrity at room temperature are excluded. The selected candidates are all stable with respect to decomposition by at least 0.03 eV per formula unit. Compounds with exciton binding energy greater than 130 meV are excluded for solar-cell materials. 23 candidates for light-emitting materials and 13 candidates for solar-cell materials were selected.

(vii) Exciton binding energy (EB). EB is the energy required to separate electron–hole pairs (excitons) into free carriers. It is critical to the electron–hole separation and recombination processes in solar cells and light emitters, respectively. A small EB is beneficial for separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in solar cells, but detrimental to charge recombination in light emitters; while a large EB inhibits separation but promotes recombination. Therefore, EB discriminates photovoltaic and electroluminescence applications for our final candidates. In this study, we use the hydrogen-like Wannier–Mott model to calculate EB as an effective Rydberg:9 (1)
It is dependent on effective mass  and screening effect on Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes (represented by relative dielectric constant, εr). The high-frequency limit of dielectric constant (ε∞), which is solely contributed by electronic polarization, is adopted as εr, and it is obtained by finite-electric field and Berry-phase calculations. The calculated exciton binding energy of some compounds are anisotropic depending on their crystal structures. We take averaged value of exciton binding energies along three directions as the descriptor . Our calculations for tetragonal MAPbI3 (tI20) with spin–orbit-coupling interactions yield an EB about 72 meV, which is comparable to the experimental value (50 meV).56 In this work, we set the criterion at EB ≤ 130 meV for solar-cell materials to include more promising candidates. Such relatively small EB values are less than twice of the calculated EB for the MAPbI3 (tI20) and are beneficial for easy dissociation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs before they recombine. For light-emitting materials, we use intrinsic EB of our candidates as a reference instead of a selection criterion. This is because light-emitting materials like perovskites are usually prepared in nanocrystals to enlarge EB,2 and materials with intrinsic small EB can also be utilized in actual applications.
The above screening process is summarized in Fig. 1. The screening gives us 23 final candidates for light emitters (Table 2) and 13 final candidates for solar cells (Table 3). Among these final candidates, 7 compounds are suitable for both applications.

Besides the seven materials descriptors discussed above, some other materials parameters such as defect tolerance and light absorption are also closely related to the optoelectronic properties. An ideal defect tolerance should have following property: intrinsic defects with low formation energies do not induce deep gap states, while those creating deep gap states have high formation energies.9,57–59 Such defect tolerance prevents the undesired recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes. A complete defect property study requires considerations of all the possible defects, such as various types of anionic and cationic vacancies, anti-sites defects, interstitial defects, and even charged defects in each candidate, which is beyond the scope of this high-throughput screening study. Moreover, our screening process already limits the final candidates to a very small and specific structural and compositional space out of the comprehensive materials repository of over 4500 compounds, and some predicted materials (including their inorganic analogues) have been demonstrated in recent experiments for optoelectronic applications (see Tables 2 and 3), indicating a robust credibility of our high-throughput screening approach. As for the light absorption property, as discussed in previous studies, it is largely dependent on the bonding characteristic, band-gap type and values, and band dispersion,17,60 which have been partially addressed in the screening process and will be discussed later with the electronic structures for the final candidates.
4 Discussion
4.1 Composition and structure
In this section, we discuss crystal structure and composition of the selected compounds. Tables 2 and 3 show all the final candidates for light-emitting and photovoltaic materials, respectively. The final candidates based on different organic A cations take the same structures and contain similar B and X elements. Note that EA- and DMA-based compounds are not included in the final lists, because they show relatively low decomposition enthalpy compared to their MA/FA/AD analogues according to our calculations. All the final candidates adopt five out of the 24 prototype structures, with their Pearson symbols being tI14, hP14, hP28, tI18, and cF36, see their structural illustrations in Fig. 3a–d and Fig. S1 of ESI.† The B sites in the five structures correspond to ions of different valence states from +2 to +4, and they greatly determine the compositions of the final candidates. Below we discuss the selected compounds in the order of their B-site valence states.
 Fig. 3  Representative candidates and their prototype structures: (a) (MA)2GeI4 in tI14, a tetragonal structure consisting of layers of corner-sharing BIIX6 octahedra, (b) (MA)3In2I9 in hP14, a hexagonal structure consisting of corrugated layers of corner-sharing BIIIX6 octahedra, (c) (FA)3Sb2I9 in hP28, a hexagonal structure consisting of dimers of face-sharing BIIIX6 octahedra, and (d) (MA)2ZrI6 in tI18, a tetragonal structure consisting of isolated BIVX6 octahedra. Their calculated electronic band structures are shown in (a′–d′) and atomic orbital projected density of states with HSE06 correction are shown in (a′′–d′′). 
The B2+ candidates all take the tI14 structure (Fig. 3a) with a chemical formula of A2BX4. tI14 consists of corner-sharing octahedra in a two-dimensional (2D) arrangement. B-Site elements of selected tI14 compounds include Ge and Sn. Note that Sn2+ or Ge2+ oxidation states are metastable and are prone to be oxidized to +4, which could raise concerns about their oxidation stability. However, recent experimental10 and computational37 studies both indicate that the 2D hybrid perovskites based on Sn2+ or Ge2+ show enhanced materials stability compared to the 3D perovskites because of their low-dimensional structural feature, and this structural feature effectively prevents the oxidation of Sn2+ during the film fabrication.10 Interestingly, unlike traditional perovskites, crystal structure of screened tI14 compounds resemble that of the 2D hybrid perovskites, implying a robust stability of these candidate materials. Moreover, even for traditional perovskites containing Sn2+ or Ge2+, some experimental techniques are actively proposed to improve their stability and to prevent the oxidation, such as using encapsulation of devices,11 and the solar cells based on MASnI3 perovskites have been demonstrated with an efficiency around 6%.61,62 In addition, it is worth mentioning that some other tI14 compounds have been synthesized and proposed for solar cells in prior experiments, including (MA)2CuX463 and (MA)2PdCl(Br)4.46,47 Our calculations show that these compounds have large mh*, and we excluded them according to the mh* ≤ 1.5m0 criterion. Our calculation results of large mh* are also in good agreement with the reduced charge mobility and very low device efficiency observed in the above experimental studies. Notably, Zn and Mg-based tI14 compounds show excellent optoelectronic properties in our calculations, but they were excluded due to large ΔHdifff.12
The B3+ candidates take two different crystal structures, hP14 and hP28, both with the formula of A3B2X9 (Fig. 3b and c, respectively). Their difference lies in microscopic structure units. hP14 consists of corner-sharing octahedra in 2D corrugated layers, while hP28 consists of face-sharing octahedra in zero-dimensional (0D) dimers. As competing phases of each other, hP14 and hP28 for the same composition usually have pretty close total energies. To decide which structure stays in the final list, we first followed our criterion for selecting stable competing phases (ΔHdifff ≤ 0.015 eV per atom), and then kept the one with more suitable electronic properties for light-emitter or solar-cell applications. hP14 is usually more favorable due to higher electronic dimensionality,64 but hP28 gives more appropriate properties for some compositions according to our calculations. For example, hP28 (MA)3Sc2I9 yields a direct band gap of proper energy, while hP14 yields an indirect band gap out of the optimal range. In fact, halogen substitution has been demonstrated to lead to phase transition between hP14 and hP28 for A3B2X9 compounds.25 The B3+ elements of the selected compounds contain Ga, In, Sb, and Bi. Interestingly, some compounds in hP28 (Cs3Bi2I9, (MA)3Bi2I9, and (MA)3Sb2I9) and hP14 (Cs3Sb2I9 and Rb3Sb2I9) have been fabricated for photovoltaic applications in prior experiments.24 Accordingly, this class of materials, particularly the new compounds discovered in this work, hold great promise with intrinsic high stability and non-toxicity for the optoelectronic applications.
The B4+ candidates adopt two very similar structures, tetragonal tI18 and cubic cF36 (Fig. 3d and Fig. S1p (ESI†), respectively). These two structures have the same formula of A2BX6 and can convert to each other through phase transition.65 They both consist of 0D isolated BX6 octahedra. According to our screening, promising B-site elements in these structures include Zr, Hf, Sn, and Te. Cs2SnI6 and Cs2TeI6 (cF36) have been incorporated in solar cell devices.54 These compounds were demonstrated to have high air and moisture stability, proper band gaps, and good electron conductivity. Interestingly, it is noted that Cs2PdBr6 (cF36) has also been synthesized and shows promising properties and high stability;48 its hybrid analogue (MA)2PdBr6 (cF36) was not selected in our list because of a large mh* of 1.98m0.
4.2 Electronic structures
In this section, we discuss electronic band structures and atomic orbital projected density of states (PDOS) of representative candidates to reveal electronic properties of all selected compounds. This is because compounds of each prototype structure have common attributes in electronic structures. We selected (MA)2GeI4, (MA)3In2I9, (FA)3Sb2I9, and (MA)2ZrI6 to represent selected compounds of the prototype structures tI14, hP14, hP28, and tI18, respectively. Note that example of cF36 compounds is not shown here because cF36 is very similar to tI18. Fig. 3a′–d′ and 3a′′–d′′ show the band structures and PDOS of the four representative candidates. The calculated band gaps and effective masses for all final candidates are listed in Tables 2 and 3.
(MA)2GeI4, representing the tI14 candidates with B2+ cations, shows a direct band gap of 1.66 eV at S point (Fig. 3a′). Bands near the CBM and VBM are very dispersive, yielding small me* and mh* of both 0.11m0. Its PDOS shows that conduction band (CB) is mainly contributed by Ge 4p orbitals while valence band (VB) is mostly derived from I 5p and Ge 4s orbitals (Fig. 3a′′).
(MA)3In2I9, as an example of the hP14 candidates, shows a direct band gap of 2.18 eV at Γ point (Fig. 3b′). Near the band edges, it has a me* of 0.40m0, and a mh* of 0.61m0. Its VB is derived from In 4d and I 5p orbitals, and the CB is derived from In 5s and I 5p orbitals (Fig. 3b′′). (FA)3Sb2I9, as an example of hP28 candidates, shows a direct band gap of 2.54 eV at M point (Fig. 3c′). The me* and mh* were calculated to be 0.39m0 and 0.68m0, respectively. Its VB consists of Sb 5s and I 5p orbitals, and the CB consists of Sb 5p and I 5p orbitals (Fig. 3c′′). These two candidates both contain B3+ cations but adopt different prototype structures. To discuss dependence of electronic structures on crystal structures, we compare the two candidates’ valence bands on two parts of the hexagonal k-path. On the Γ–A k-path, both the hP14 and hP28 candidates show non-dispersive valence bands and large mh*. Γ–A corresponds to [001] direction for the hexagonal lattice in real space, and large calculated mh* on Γ–A indicates poor hole transport along [001]. This agrees well with poor octahedral connectivity along [001] in the hP14 and hP28 structures (Fig. 3b and c). On the M–K k-path, valence bands of the hP14 candidate is more dispersive than those of hP28 candidate. This is because M–K corresponds to real-space direction in (001) plane, and the 2D connectivity in hP14 is more beneficial for hole transport than the 0D connectivity in hP28. Notably, compounds in both of these structures have rather indistinct VBMs, making the band gap types ambiguous. For light-emitting applications, the band gaps become more distinctly direct due to quantum confinement when the compounds are synthesized as nanocrystals.66,67
(MA)2ZrI6, representing the tI18 candidates with B4+ cations, shows a distinct direct band gap of 2.60 eV at Γ point, with very dispersive bands near the band edges (Fig. 3d′). Its PDOS shows that both VB and CB are mainly contributed by Zr 4d and I 5p orbitals (Fig. 3d′′). As mentioned, B4+-based compounds in the tI18 and cF36 structures consist of isolated octahedra, and their B–X bonds are not well connected in a 3D manner. However, the BX6 octahedra are in close proximity to each other, making it possible for tI18 and cF36 compounds to possess appropriate band gaps and effective masses for the optoelectronic applications.24 Interestingly, the previously synthesized Cs2SnI6 (cF36) shows large mh*, which is not suitable for photovoltaics.54 Our screening results of novel tI18 and cF36 compounds show more suitable properties, especially small and balanced carrier effective masses, and hold great promise for applications in light emitters and solar cells.
5 Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a high-throughput approach to the discovery of hybrid halide compounds beyond perovskites for optoelectronic applications. The discovery process has screened a comprehensive quantum materials repository containing 4507 hybrid compounds using a series of electronic and energetic descriptors including difference of formation enthalpy, decomposition enthalpy, band gap, charge carrier effective mass, and exciton binding energy to select promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. A total number of 23 candidates for light-emitting diodes and 13 candidates for solar energy conversion were selected. These candidates adopt five prototype structures, including tetragonal structure consisting of layers of corner sharing BIIX6 (tI14), hexagonal structure consisting of corrugated layers of corner-sharing BIIIX6 (hP14), hexagonal structure consisting of dimers of face-sharing BIIIX6 (hP28), tetragonal structure consisting of isolated BIVX6 (tI18), and cubic structure consisting of isolated BIVX6 (cF36). The tI14 candidates contain BII = Ge, Sn; the hP14 and hP28 candidates contain BIII = Ga, In, Sb, Bi; and the tI18 and cF36 candidates contain BIV = Zr, Te, Sn, and Hf. It is important to note that this approach is transformative to the discovery of other types of functional materials.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites are promising for the next-generation solar cells and light-emitting applications because of their exceptional optoelectronic properties and low-temperature solution processability. However, this class of materials are facing two major challenges including intrinsic poor stability and the presence of toxic lead for their practical applications. To overcome these challenges, great efforts are being devoted to the development of tin-based perovskites and double perovskites, as well as new approaches to protect devices like using encapsulation. In this work, instead of focusing on perovskites, we present a powerful approach to search for novel lead-free hybrid halide semiconductors beyond perovskites from a large variety of prototype structures using high-throughput computations and data-mining techniques. 23 candidates for light-emitting diodes and 13 candidates for solar cells were rapidly identified. All these candidates show appropriate electronic properties and robust stability from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This work demonstrates a new pathway for the large-scale design of novel organic–inorganic optoelectronic materials at a high speed by exploring a large variety of prototype structures. It is important to highlight that this approach is transformative to the discovery of other types of functional materials.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the high-throughput screening process. A total number of 4507 compounds (AxByXz, A = MA/FA/AD/EA/DMA, X = I/Br/Cl) were generated from 65 kinds of B-site elements in 24 different crystal structures. Compounds with direct band gaps in the visible spectrum range are kept for light-emitting materials, and compounds with band gaps in 0.8–2.2 eV are kept for solar-cell materials. Compounds with effective masses greater than 1.5m0 are excluded. Compounds with a formation enthalpy higher than its most energetically favorable competing phase by a value greater than 0.015 eV per atom are excluded. Compounds containing toxic B-site elements are also excluded. Compounds that cannot maintain structural integrity at room temperature are excluded. The selected candidates are all stable with respect to decomposition by at least 0.03 eV per formula unit. Compounds with exciton binding energy greater than 130 meV are excluded for solar-cell materials. 23 candidates for light-emitting materials and 13 candidates for solar-cell materials were selected.
