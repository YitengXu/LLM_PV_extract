    , Accepted 18th January 2022First published on 18th January 2022AbstractThe hydrovoltaic effect, which is a voltage generated at the interface of water with polarizable materials, is an exciting new frontier for environmentally friendly electrical power generation. Recently reported hydrovoltaic devices utilize different nanomaterial substrates, most of which suffer from low power output (especially under normal environmental conditions). Herein, we report a high strength, highly flexible, lightweight, thermally and chemically stable, surface functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (FMWCNT), supported on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The resultant devices made from this material provide a myriad of benefits including high power generation (210 μW g−1) even under high humidity, making it less prone to damage or environmental degradation during long-term exposure. Achieving high power output from stable devices is of utmost importance in taking hydrovoltaics from an interesting phenomenon measured in the lab to a real competitor in the renewable energy market.
Introduction
Heads of state from around the globe have convened again this year at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) with the expressed goal of making aggressive plans for combatting global warming.1 At the forefront of this conversation is green energy technologies, making changes to infrastructure that reduce carbon emissions. Currently, 80% of the world's power is supplied from fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal. The use of these limited resources continues to contribute to climate change and the devastating effects that come with it.2 Renewable energy technologies such as wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy supply have grown from 8.7 percent to 11.2 percent from 2009 to 2019, and their market share is rapidly increasing.3–6 The global renewable energy capacity reached 440 TW h in total by the end of 2019, with hydropower accounting for more than 100 TW h. However, conventional hydropower energy systems cannot meet increased energy demands and have negative consequences of installation of large dams.7 In order to continue curbing reliance on fossil fuels and meet increasing energy demands, development of new renewable energy technologies are needed.
A phenomenon called the “hydrovoltaic effect” (HV), holds the potential to generate energy from water without the need for complex mechanical systems or flooding of valuable land.8 Hydrovoltaic devices are capable of generating a streaming potential and current that can be extracted as power when water moves over a surface, i.e. via capillary action or evaporation.9 When water molecules contact the polarizable surface of nanomaterials, they are effectively solvated. Within the nanomaterial, opposing charges to that of the induced dipole are attracted and transferred through the nanochannels parallel to the flow of water and propelled by the movement of water over the material surface. The resulting motion of net charge leads to a potential, referred to as a streaming potential, and the flow of charges that result is referred to as a streaming current. Power generation (current times voltage) is made continuous by evaporation from the surface of the nanomaterial. The net result is the continuous conversion of kinetic energy generated by the motion of water and attracted ions into electrical energy. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 1 with a representative device as well as the constant streaming potential measured for a single device.

Water's interaction with nanomaterials can be used for electricity generation in different ways, including as a droplet (rain), humidity, flowing (like in rivers), waving over a fixed substrate in larger waterbodies, or evaporation (dew), to name a few examples.10–15 Evaporation is especially compelling to meet new energy demands since the driving force is ambient thermal energy that leads to evaporation and electricity production. In the context of global warming this process actually reduces warming by converting thermal energy into useable electricity.
Despite the exciting promise of this newly discovered phenomena, there are limitations associated with HV materials investigated to date. For instance, humidity-based devices require a particular humidity level, droplet-based materials require a continuous flow of water, and evaporation-based materials require an open condition with relatively low humidity to maximize the HV effect. Each technology is typically highly variable with respect to varying weather conditions.10–16 Furthermore, when compared to competing technologies such as solar cells, all of the HV devices produce significantly lower power output when compared per unit area or per mass of active substrate.17,18 It is therefore imperative to engineer materials that can overcome these challenges to unlock the full potential of this emerging HV technology.
In this work, we investigate higher strength, lightweight, thermally and chemically stable, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for their performance in hydrovoltaic devices.19 The unique properties of MWCNT are highlighted as they aid in the development of high-performance, flexible, and stable HV cells. Furthermore, MWCNTs have an electrically conductive mesoporous structure, which leads to good device activity by facilitating faster charge transfer from the bottom to the top of the device.20 We discovered a broader range of applications for MWCNTs in previous published articles, such as inks for printed electronics, filters for bacterial removal and inactivation, batteries, and so on, but it remains unexplored in hydrovoltaics.21–23 Interestingly, functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs) formed via acid treatment of commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CMWCNTs) generate more power per unit mass than previously reported articles and improve processing and device stability.8,12–15,24
Result and discussion
The initial device prepared with CMWCNTs had a non-uniform layer of the CMWCNTs (Fig. S1(a)†). To improve the uniformity of this layer, CMWCNTs were treated with H2SO4 and HNO3 so as to incorporate different functional groups and improve water solubility. As expected, the device prepared with functionalized carbon nanotubes had uniform film formation (Fig. S1(b)†) and was also flexible (Fig. S2†). The functionalization was confirmed through XPS, which revealed an increase in the atomic percentage of oxygen from 0.84% (CMWCNTs) to 11% (FMWCNTs), a 13-fold increase (Fig. S3(a) and (b)†). The C 1s and O 1s spectra of FMWCNT followed the same pattern, with an increase in the atomic percentage of C–O, CO, O–CO, C–OH, and C–O–C when compared to CMWCNTs (Fig. S4(a)–(d)† and 2(a)). The Raman spectrum of a carbon nanotube has two peaks, one at 1601 cm−1 (G-peak) and one at 1314 cm−1 (D-peak).25 The G vibration mode represents the in-plane stretching motion of C sp2-type bonds, whereas the D peak indicates the presence of disorder due to defects induced at sp2 hybridized carbon as a result of functionalization. FMWCNT Raman spectra showed an increase in D/G band intensity (D/G = 2.0) compared to CMWCNT (D/G = 1.6) (Fig. 2(b)), confirming the increase in disorder in the structure from the acid functionalization at the walls and ends of the carbon nanotubes. The disorder in the structure was also confirmed by FESEM and TEM analysis, which revealed a more rough and porous structure after acid functionalization (Fig. 2(c)–(f)). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, nitrogen adsorption isotherm measurements) surface area measurements support the incorporation of functional groups in CMWCNTs, resulting in more porous and water stable FMWCNTs with a specific surface area of 87.16 ± 0.27 m2 g−1 (Fig. S5†).

The device prepared with 2 mg of FMWCNTs was placed inside a 100 mL beaker with water covering 0.5 cm of the bottom of the device at 26.1 °C and 10% RH (Fig. S6†). FMWCNTs have a zeta potential of −52.8 mV (Fig. S7†), confirming their negative surface charge. Acid treatment of CMWCNTs breaks C–C bonds, as confirmed by XPS measurements, and forms new CO, C–OH, C–O, O–CO, and C–O–C bonds. There are two major effects of this change in functionality, in addition to (1) making a better suspension and therefore better films for FMWCNT, (2) the material obtained after acid treatment and film formation is more hydrophilic and porous; facilitating the interaction with water. The stronger hydrophilic nature of the acid treated material contributes to increased rates of capillary flow and more negatively polarized surfaces in water, as confirmed by zeta potential study. When this negative surface was immersed in water, it attracted hydronium ions from water molecule solvation and formed an electrical double layer (EDL) at the solid–liquid interface. The attracted hydronium ions, along with water molecules were carried to the top of the device, through the pores and conductive paths of FMWCNTs by capillary action and evaporation (Fig. 1(b)). The relative accumulation of positive charges at the top of the device compared to the bottom produced a potential difference between them, and the flow of the hydronium ions produced a streaming current. The OCP between the working and counter electrodes was measured for 3600 s, starting at 0.378 V and rising to a stable value of 0.385 V (Fig. 1(c)), and the Isc measured from LSV was −6.8 μA (Fig. S8†). Continuous OCP was measured for 48 h, which showed no significant decrease in their performance (Fig. S9(a)†). The OCP was also measured using graphite electrodes, which showed only a 20 mV difference from the copper electrodes (Fig. S9(b)†). Both preceding studies confirm that the power generated by the FMWCNTs device is primarily due to capillary and evaporation phenomena.
The conversion of kinetic energy from the flow of water molecules and attracted ions into electrical power is the principle underlying the generation of electrical energy from HV devices. As a result, at higher humidity levels, slower evaporation rates reduce this flow, resulting in low power generation.8,11–16 However, the porous structure formed by deformation (Fig. 2(c)), as well as the electrical conductivity of FMWCNTs, allow water and ions to flow even at higher humidity levels. The OCP of the FMWCNTs device measured up to 89% RH retained 86% of its original efficiency (Fig. 3(a)), a small, albeit expected, decrease due to lower water flow at high humidity levels. Previously reported HV devices were generally measured between 20 °C and 30 °C, while the lower temperature range is still unexplored. So, the FMWCNTs device was measured at −14 °C inside the freezer (Fig. S10†), which surprisingly showed an OCP of 0.36 V for 60000 s, suggesting that power could be generated from sublimated water vapours (Fig. 3(b)). The studies mentioned above confirm that this device can function in different weather conditions.
 Fig. 3  OCP measurement of FMWCNTs device (a) at different relative humidity levels at 24 °C, (b) inside the freezer at ∼−14 °C, (c) at different NaCl concentrations starting from 0 M to 5 M, the measured OCPs from 0 M to 0.01 M NaCl is enlarged in the inset, (d) terminal voltages and currents measured across different load resistances (10 Ω to 22 MΩ) connected with FMWCNTs device, the maximum power obtained at their intersection. 
In general, higher salt concentrations increase the screening effect from readily available counter charges, which reduces the surface potential of the nanomaterial over shorter distances and attracts fewer charges to the solid surface, resulting in lower HV performance.8,12,13,15 In this case, the electrical conductivity of FMWCNTs can facilitate charge transfer, potentially reducing the screening effect. The FMWCNTs device's OCP demonstrated significant performance at NaCl concentrations as high as 5 M (Fig. 3(c)). The OCP increased as salt concentration increased, reaching a maximum of 0.415 V with 0.01 M NaCl and decreasing with 0.1 M or higher NaCl concentrations, reaching 0.3 V with 5.0 M NaCl. The possible reasoning is that at low salt concentrations, the device may significantly reduce the screening effect and collect more charges, but at higher concentrations, enhanced surface screening by counter ions may dominate over conductivity and reduce performance. In addition, because copper electrodes oxidize in NaCl, graphite paste was used to make electrodes (working and counter) for this study.
To estimate the device's maximum power output, different load resistances ranging from 10 Ω to 22 MΩ were connected in the circuit. At various resistance values, the terminal voltage and output current were measured. As the load resistance increased, the terminal voltage increased from 0 V to 0.370 V, while the output current decreased from −6.47 μA to approximately 0 A. When the load resistance was around 60 kΩ, the maximum output power of 0.42 μW was achieved, which is equivalent to power densities of 93.33 μW cm−3 and 210 μW g−1 (Fig. 3(d)). This power output was quite high as compared to previous reported devices.8,12–15
The film obtained by drop-casting 2 mg of FMWCNTs on PET sheet has a thickness of 10 μm, as measured with a micrometer. To fabricate thicker cells, a greater amount of FMWCNTs was drop-cast on PET sheet. On a 3 cm × 1.5 cm PET sheet, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg of FMWCNTs were loaded. The power output was calculated by multiplying the obtained OCP and Isc values for different loadings (Fig. S11(a)†). The power output for 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg are 1.31 ± 0.06 μW mg−1, 2.33 ± 0.04 μW mg−1, 4.60 ± 0.19 μW mg−1, 2.70 ± 0.25 μW mg−1, and 2.10 ± 0.31 μW mg−1, respectively. The power density reaches a maximum of 4.60 ± 0.19 μW mg−1 at 6 mg. To better understand the reasoning behind this, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to measure resistance of the charge transfer process (RCT) in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The RCT values for 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, and 10 mg obtained from fitting the Randell's circuit with the Nyquist plot are 15.8 ± 1.9 kΩ, 5.8 ± 0.62 kΩ, 2.2 ± 0.08 kΩ, 2.4 ± 0.02 kΩ, and 3.1 ± 0.05 kΩ, respectively (Fig. S11(b)†). RCT values have an inverse relationship with power output because higher resistance to the charge transfer process inhibits the flow of charge carriers, lowering HV activity.26,27 The resistance decreases up to 6 mg and then increases, indicating faster charge transfer kinetics at 6 mg for the 3 cm × 1.5 cm size. With loading masses above 6 mg the film loses its stability in water, confirming optimal film formation at 6 mg for 3 cm × 1.5 cm. Higher loading may necessitate a larger PET sheet size to provide better film formation with lower charge transfer resistance and good HV performance. The power output can be easily scaled up by connecting devices in series or parallel configurations.28 For example, four devices were connected in series, yielding an OCP of 1.55 V at 22.4 °C and 16% RH (Fig. 4(a)).
 Fig. 4  (a) OCP measurement of 4-series connected FMWCNTs devices, (b) OCP measurement of uncharged capacitor (black line) and charged capacitor (red line) via 3-series connected FMWCNTs devices (blue line). 
Energy storage and transportation (e.g. hydrogen energy storage), presents many practical challenges like the need for enormous pressure to compress hydrogen gas and large volumes that are cumbersome for transportation.29 Electrical energy storage on the other hand is readily achieved in capacitors and batteries. To illustrate the utility of these hydrovoltaic devices a capacitor was connected and charged by FMWCNTs. The three series-connected devices made of FMWCNTs produced an OCP of 1.05 V, which was successfully stored inside the capacitor (Fig. 4(b)). Due to the device's significant activity at lower temperatures, it was also tested in the snow, yielding an average OCP of 0.350 V (Fig. S12†). Variations in this value were caused by differences in wind speed, which resulted in a different rate of evaporation causing different flow rates of water molecules.
The FMWCNT reported herein deliver 210 μW g−1, significantly higher on a per gram basis than any known devices reported to date (see Table S1† for a list of some other reported device performances).12–15,30 By comparison, graphene oxide have demonstrated some of the highest hydrovoltaic power outputs of 27 mW cm−3, (moisture gradient applied to device) and have a very high density such this actually converts to only 0.0023 μW g−1.30 Furthermore, the graphene hydrovoltaics function under very specific working conditions that are challenging to achieve in real world (weather) situations. The FMWCNTs devices were optimized herein for maximum power and are shown to be scalable by combining devices both in series and in parallel. To achieve even higher power production per unit area or volume of the device FMWCNTs can be used in combination with porous supports; an active area of future work. FMWCNTs show a great deal of potential for taking hydrovoltaics from an interesting phenomenon to a technology capable of producing green power on a large scale and in real weather conditions.
Conclusion
This work demonstrates that CMWCNTs can be functionalized in a single step to produce FMWCNTs, which can generate energy from water evaporation. The functionalization not only improves film formation but also promotes the formation of porous structures, which aids in the flow of water and attracted ions. FMWCNT's HV performance with a power output of 210 μW g−1 is the highest reported to date, due to its electrically conductive and porous structure. The power generated by FMWCNTs was easily scaled up by connecting a series of devices, the energy of which was easily stored or can be used to power other electronic devices. FMWCNT's flexibility and ability to perform in different weather conditions can support a high amount of power supply per unit of occupied space in extremely dry and cold places. The fact that FMWCNT are easily processed, highly durable, flexible, lightweight, thermally and chemically stable, and deliver high power relative to other HV devices shows that this material has real promise as a green energy technology to help tackle climate change, especially if implemented by governments into city planning and major infrastructure to replace reliance on fossil fuels.
Materials and methods
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes with >90% carbon basis, D × L 110–170 nm × 5–9 μm, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Sulfuric acid (95%) and nitric acid (95%) were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Ethanol (95%), used as a solvent, was purchased from Commercial Alcohol Inc. Copper paper electrodes were purchased from Dongguan Kaidi Adhesive Technology Co. Ltd and graphite electrodes were purchased from American Elements Inc. Milli-Q water was used for all hydrovoltaic measurements. The micrometer used for substrate thickness measurements was purchased from BESTOOL-KANON.
Synthesis of functionalized-MWCNT
The CMWCNTs were functionalized using a previously reported technique to improve their stability in water and develop a negative surface potential.22 1.5 g of CMWCNTs were sonicated in a total volume of 60 mL of H2SO4 and HNO3 (H2SO4:HNO3 ratio was 3:1). After sonication, the solution was refluxed for 180 minutes at 90 °C. To neutralize the pH of the obtained product, it was washed several times with water. Finally, the sample was dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. Following drying, the sample was ground in a mortar and pestle to obtain the fine powder of FMWCNTs.
Hydrovoltaic device fabrication
First, 2 mg of FMWCNTs were mixed with 250 μL of ethanol as a solvent and sonicated for 10 min at room temperature. After sonication, the sample was drop-cast on a 3 cm × 1.5 cm polyethylene terephthalate sheet (PET) and dried at room temperature for 6 h.
After drying, copper paper electrodes were placed at the bottom and top of the PET sheet to act as counter and working electrodes. Copper wires were connected to these electrodes to measure the output from the device. The same technique was used to make the device from CMWCNTs.
Hydrovoltaic measurements
All hydrovoltaic measurements were carried out using a Metrohm potentiostat. Copper paper was used as a counter and working electrode, and Milli-Q water was used as a solvent. First, the open circuit voltage was measured to determine the open circuit potential (OCP) from various devices. Further, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was then used to measure short circuit current (Isc). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to show non-faradaic behavior of the electrodes. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was measured at OCP in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. Randel's circuit fitting was then used to obtain the charge transfer resistance (RCT) and solution resistance (Rs) values from various devices.
Materials characterization
Raman spectroscopy (AVASPEC-ULS, 2048 × 64 TEC-EVO) was used to analyze the degree of disorder after functionalization of CMWCNTs. The spectra were obtained in the 1000–1800 cm−1 range, with an integration time of 30 s and three scans were averaged. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the percentage increase of functional groups on the CMWCNTs. The XPS spectra were measured on a Kratos Axis Nova spectrometer equipped with Al Kα radiation at 1486.69 eV (150 W, 10 mA), a charge neutralizer and a delay-line detector (DLD) consisting of three multi-channel plates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded to observe the morphology change after functionalization. TEM was performed on a Thermo Scientific F200i operating at 200 kV using a single tilt holder and Cu grids with a Carbon type B film. Zeta potential (Zetasizer) measurement was performed to understand the surface charge nature of FMWCNTs. To determine the specific surface area of the FMWCNTs, BET (Micrometrics ASAP 2010) was used. The Metrohm Autolab was used for all hydrovoltaic (HV) activity measurements.
