    , Accepted 23rd August 2017First published on 24th August 2017AbstractHollow Co2P nanoflowers (Co2P HNFs) were successfully prepared via a one-step, template-free method. Microstructure analysis reveals that Co2P HNFs are assembled from nanorods and possess abundant mesopores and an amorphous carbon shell. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical measurements demonstrate the high electrical conductivity of Co2P. Benefiting from the unique nanostructures, when employed as an electrode material for supercapacitors, Co2P HNFs exhibit a high specific capacitance, an outstanding rate capability, and an ultralong cycling stability. Furthermore, the constructed Co2P HNF//AC ASC exhibits a high energy density of 30.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 850 W kg−1, along with a superior cycling performance (108.0% specific capacitance retained after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1). These impressive results make Co2P HNFs a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
1. Introduction
To fulfil the ever-increasing environmental and societal demand for energy storage, various strategies have been developed such as lithium (ion, sulfur, and air) batteries, solar energy technology, and fuel cells.1–5 Among them, supercapacitors play a crucial role on account of their high power density, reliable safety, and long lifetime.6–8 The main limitation of supercapacitors is their low energy density, which seriously impedes their widespread application.9–11 Based on their fundamental energy storage mechanisms, supercapacitors are usually classified into two categories: electrode double layer capacitors (EDLCs), which store energy by accumulating the surface charges of the electrode materials, and pseudocapacitors, which deliver energy through reversible faradaic redox reactions.7,12 Pseudocapacitors possess much higher energy density than EDLCs.6,7 Therefore, exploiting high performance pseudocapacitive materials is a feasible strategy to obtain high performance supercapacitors.
High performance pseudocapacitive materials should possess four features: multiple oxidation states, a large specific surface area, good electronic conductivity, and a robust structure.13 Cobalt phosphides, which have been extensively studied in many fields (e.g., as electro-catalysts in water splitting, as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries, and as catalysts in hydrodesulfurization reactions), exhibit metalloid properties and superior electronic conductivity.14–21 Since both cobalt phosphates and nickel phosphides have delivered high specific capacitance for supercapacitors in previous demonstrations,11,22,23 cobalt phosphides can be reasonably believed to produce rich redox reactions in alkaline solution. Moreover, considering the relationship between cobalt oxides and nickel oxides,24,25 cobalt phosphides should have a higher theoretical capacity than nickel phosphides. So cobalt phosphides are a promising alternative material for supercapacitors. Also, constructing nanostructured cobalt phosphides is an effective way of realizing their specific capacitance by engineering a larger specific surface area. So far, cobalt phosphides with diverse structures, such as nanoparticles,14,26–28 nanowires,20,29 nanorods,15,30–32 nanoflowers,30,33 urchin-like microspheres,34 and grass-like superstructures,35 have been synthesized. However, unlike cobalt hydroxide, oxide, or sulfide, there is scanty research about the use of cobalt phosphides as the electrode materials for supercapacitors. Therefore, it is significant and meaningful to develop the application of cobalt phosphides for supercapacitors.
Compared with zero, one, or two-dimensional nanostructures, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures should possess a larger specific surface area and more effectively prevent particle aggregation; therefore, they are preferable for energy storage.9,30,36,37 Currently, there are two main techniques for synthesizing nanostructured transition metal phosphides, namely the solution-phase reaction and the gas–solid reaction.38,39 However, the process for synthesizing 3D transition-metal phosphides using the gas–solid method is too tedious and usually requires prepared precursors.22,34,40 In addition, the nanostructure directly determines the cycling performance of electrode materials; thus, a robust structure is important for energy storage fields. The structure obtained from the gas–solid reaction may suffer from performance decay.22 Therefore, a simple solution–phase reaction must be developed to directly construct 3D transition-metal phosphides with a robust structure.
In this work, we report the synthesis of Co2P with a robust, hollow nanoflower structure using a simple, one-step thermal decomposition method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that the hollow Co2P nanoflowers (Co2P HNFs) are composed of nanorods. When employed as the electrode material for supercapacitors, Co2P HNFs deliver a high specific capacitance of 412.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Co2P HNFs also show an ultrahigh cycling stability, with 124.7% of the initial specific capacitance retained after 10000 charge–discharge cycles. Furthermore, a Co2P HNF//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) has been successfully fabricated, and shows superior specific capacitance, rate capacity, and cycling lifespan. These results suggest that Co2P HNFs have the potential to serve as an alternative electrode material for supercapacitors.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials preparation
Cobalt(III) acetylacetonate (Co(acac)3, chemical purity), triphenylphosphine (TPP, 99.0%), oleylamine (OAm, 98.0%), toluene (99.5%), and acetone (99.5%) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagents Company. Active carbon was purchased from Nanjing JCNANO Technology Co., Ltd. All reagents were of chemical grade and were used without further purification.
The hollow Co2P nanoflowers (Co2P HNFs) were synthesized in a one-step process by thermal decomposition of Co(acac)3 in a solution containing OAm and toluene, using TPP as the phosphorus source. First, 0.5 g Co(acac)3 was dissolved in a three-neck flask containing a solution of 10 mL OAm and 5 mL toluene, before being heated to 100 °C and subjected to magnetic stirring and nitrogen bubbling for 0.5 h. Subsequently, 1.0 g TPP was added into the homogeneous solution, which continued to be under magnetic stirring and nitrogen bubbling for an additional 0.5 h. Then, the mixed solution was rapidly heated up to 280 °C, which was maintained for 2 h. Finally, the obtained black solution was naturally cooled to room temperature; acetone was added to dilute the solution. The products were collected by centrifugation and washed several times with acetone.41
2.2. Materials characterization
The crystal structure, morphology, elemental composition, and chemical valence state of the Co2P HNFs were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert Pro MPD system, Cu Kα, λ = 0.154 nm), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB MK II, Al Kα photon source, C 1s 284.8 eV), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI, S4800) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, a FEI Titan G2 80–300 STEM equipped with X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS)). The specimen for the TEM study was prepared by dispersing a drop of toluene solution containing the as-synthesized product onto a porous carbon film supported by a copper grid, which was then dried in a vacuum drying oven.42 The specific surface areas of the products were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements at 77 K (Micrometrics, ASAP 2020).
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
For the preparation of the working electrodes, the prepared active material was mixed with carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at a mass ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solution. The mixture was coated on a clean nickel-foam current collector (area ∼1 cm2) and dried overnight at 80 °C in a vacuum oven. This dried electrode was pressed using a hydraulic press at a pressure of 10 MPa. The electrochemical tests were carried out in both three-electrode and two-electrode configurations using a 6 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. In the three-electrode electrochemical cell, a Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.41 The loading mass of the active material in the working electrode was about 2.45 mg cm−2. In the two-electrode electrochemical system, an ASC was constructed by using Co2P HNFs as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode. Electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also carried out using this apparatus over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at open-circuit voltage with an AC amplitude of 5 mV.42
The specific capacitance (C, F g−1), energy density (E, W h kg−1) and power density (P, W kg−1) were calculated from the charge–discharge curves based on the following equations:43,44 C = IΔt/ΔV(1) E = CΔV2/7.2(2) P = 3600E/Δt(3)where I (A g−1) is the current density, Δt (s) is the discharge time, and ΔV (V) is the applied potential window. For the asymmetric supercapacitor, the current density I is defined as the total mass of the active materials on both the positive and negative electrodes.
3. Results and discussion
Co2P hollow nanoflowers (Co2P HNFs) were synthesized through a simple one-step process by the thermal decomposition of cobalt acetylacetonate in a solution containing oleylamine and toluene with triphenylphosphine as a phosphorus source. The low-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1a shows that the prepared samples were uniform in size and shape. Detailed morphological information can be obtained from the high-magnification SEM image of two representative nanoparticles in Fig. 1b. The nanoparticles had a spherical morphology with many protuberances and a diameter of about 110 nm. Besides, a thin carbon shell can also be observed on the surface.

The XRD results revealed the as-prepared product to be orthorhombic Co2P, as shown in Fig. 1c. Four discernible peaks at 40.4°, 43.5°, 52.0°, and 55.6° are ascribed to the (112)/(210), (211), (020) and (302) planes of Co2P (JCPDF no. 89-3030), respectively. Fig. 1e presents a crystal structure model of the Co2P crystal structure. In orthorhombic Co2P, the Co atoms have two occupied sites, which are tetrahedral and pyramidal geometries surrounded by four P and five P atoms, respectively. Each P atom is shared by three Co atoms, forming a tricapped trigonal prismatic configuration.45–47 The complicated structure of Co2P endows it with abundant physicochemical properties.14,15,20,30,31,35,48 Moreover, the calculated densities of states of Co2P show the Fermi level within the conduction band (Fig. S1†). The result demonstrates the metallic feature of Co2P, which benefits Co2P as an electrode material for energy storage.40,44
The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results of the Co2P HNFs are shown in Fig. 1d. The atomic ratio of Co/P was found to be 1.7, within the experimental error of the stoichiometric ratio of Co2P, further confirming the formation of Co2P phase. Oxygen was detected, originating from the oxide layer that commonly forms on the surface of cobalt phosphide.17,28,31 The carbon signal came from the carbon film and the formed carbon shell on the surface of the nanoparticles, while the copper signal was from the copper network.
TEM revealed the microstructure of the prepared sample. A typical TEM image of the prepared Co2P sample in Fig. 2a shows a flower-shaped structure with a hollow core, made up of nanorods with good monodispersity. A TEM image of an individual Co2P HNF in Fig. 2b more clearly reveals its nanostructure. The diameter of the nanostructure was found to be about 110 nm, consistent with the SEM results. The hollow flower structure and uniformity of Co2P HNFs were further confirmed by HAADF STEM (Fig. 2c). Fig. 2d displays the selected area electron diffraction patterns of Co2P HNFs. The several diffraction rings observed in Fig. 2d correspond to the (112)/(210), (211), (020) and (302) planes of Co2P, coinciding with the XRD data. A HRTEM image of Co2P HNFs in Fig. 2e clearly reveals its good crystallinity and lattice fringes. The lattice fringes with interplane distances of 0.221 and 0.174 nm correspond to the (112) and (020) planes of Co2P, respectively. Fig. 2f shows the STEM image of Co2P HNFs and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images of cobalt, phosphorus, and oxygen for the Co2P HNF. In accordance with the EDS results (Fig. 1d) and the XPS spectra (Fig. 3), both cobalt and phosphorus were uniformly distributed throughout each HNF, and oxygen was detected on the surface of the Co2P HNF.

The multiple species on the surface of Co2P determined its abundant electrochemical performance. To confirm the surface elemental composition and electronic states of the Co2P HNF, XPS experiments were conducted. Cobalt, phosphorus, and oxygen were detected, and an overlapping peak resolving strategy was employed to analyze in depth the valence state of the elements, as shown in Fig. 3. For the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p, two species of Co can be clearly recognized in Fig. 3a. The fitting peaks at 777.9 and 792.8 eV are ascribed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies of the reduced Co species in Co2P.14,15,27 The peaks at 781.3 (2p3/2) and 797.2 (2p1/2) eV, which are accompanied by two shake-up satellite peaks at 785.6 and 802.5 eV, correspond to the oxidized Co species, which originate from the cobalt phosphate that formed on the surface of Co2P.17,18Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution P 2p spectrum, which was deconvoluted to three fitting peaks. The doublets at 192.2 and 130.2 eV indicate the phosphidation of cobalt as it formed Co2P, while the peak at 133.4 eV is attributed to the phosphate and P–C bonding.14,18,27,40 The clear peak at 285.5 eV in the C 1s spectrum confirms the P–C bonding (Fig. S2†).14 The spectrum of O 1s was also fitted to two peaks at 531.2 and 532.5 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen and the chemisorbed oxygen species, respectively.17,21,49

Fig. 3d displays the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the as-prepared Co2P HNF. The specific surface area was found to be 19.37 m2 g−1 by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size distribution plot shown in the inset of Fig. 3d reveals that Co2P HNFs possess abundant mesopores, which substantially facilitate contact between the electrolyte and the active sites.
The electrochemical performance of Co2P HNFs as a positive electrode material for supercapacitors was estimated in a 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Fig. 4a shows the typical CV curves of Co2P HNFs at different scan rates ranging from 5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1. The CV curves of Co2P HNFs possess distinct redox peaks, unlike the rectangular CV curves of conventional EDLCs, highlighting the faradaic pseudocapacitive characteristics of a Co2P HNF electrode.50 Also, the anodic and cathodic peaks continuously shifted toward higher and lower potentials, respectively, with the current density peaks augmented by the increasing scan rates. The faradaic pseudocapacitive property of an electrode derives from the reversible redox of metal ions at the surface of the active material. Based on previous studies of cobalt phosphide and phosphate, the complicated faradaic reversible redox reactions of Co2P HNFs were caused by the surface formation of different Co-based species, including the cobalt phosphate (denoted Co2+xPyOz) detected by XPS and EDX, and the cobalt hydroxide that originated from the oxidation of Co2P in a KOH electrolyte at low voltage.11,20,30,51,52 A possible reaction mechanism is proposed based on the CV curve measured at 5 mV s−1 containing one small oxidation peak and four pairs of redox peaks (Fig. S3†). The single one comes from the oxidation of Co2P (Coδ+) into Co(OH)2 (eqn (4)).20,44 The two pairs of redox peaks at 0.10/0.07 V and 0.50/0.46 V can be assigned to the reversible transformation process of Co(OH)2 ↔ CoOOH (eqn (5)) and CoOOH ↔ CoO2 (eqn (6)), respectively,44 whereas the two couples of redox peaks at 0.35/0.27 V and 0.38/0.31 V can be assigned to the reversible conversion of Co2+xPyOz ↔ Co3+xPyOz(OH)x (eqn (7)) and Co3+xPyOz(OH)x ↔ Co4+xPyOz(OH)2x (eqn (8)), respectively.11,43,51,53 Coδ+ + 2OH− → Co(OH)2 + (2 − δ)e−(4) Co(OH)2 + OH− ↔ CoOOH + H2O + e−(5) CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO2 + H2O + e−(6) Co2+xPyOz + xOH− ↔ Co3+xPyOz(OH)x + xe−(7) Co3+xPyOz + xOH− ↔ Co4+xPyOz(OH)2x + xe−(8)

Fig. 4b shows the CP curves of the Co2P HNF electrode measured at current densities ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. The distinct plateaus in the potential further indicate the pseudocapacitive performance of the Co2P HNF electrode, and the number of plateaus also corresponds well with the number of redox peaks.50 Meanwhile, the high symmetry of the CP curves reveals the excellent reversibility of the faradaic redox processes.54,55 Based on the discharging curves, the specific capacitances of Co2P HNFs were calculated to be 412.7, 370.4, 321.1, 284.9, 276.5, and 266.9 F g−1 at the current densities of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 4c). Co2P HNFs exhibited an excellent rate capacitive property. Moreover, the specific capacitance of Co2P HNFs was higher than those of some reported cobalt–phosphorus-based materials, such as Co2P nanorods (284 F g−1 at 1 A g−1),30 Co2P2O7 nanosheets (286 F g−1 at 1 A g−1),53 Co3(PO4)2 nanoflakes (188 F g−1 at 3 A g−1),51 Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6 microarchitecture (321 F g−1 at 1.25 A g−1),55 NH4CoPO4·H2O microflowers (369.4 F g−1 at 0.625 A g−1),56 Co2P2O7 hierarchical architecture (367 F g−1 at 0.625 A g−1),57 and flower-like Co3(PO4)2·8H2O (350 F g−1 at 1 A g−1).50Fig. 4d shows a plot of the voltage drop of the Co2P HNF electrode versus current density and the corresponding linear fitting function. The small absolute value of the slope indicates the low internal resistance of the Co2P HNF electrode.
Cycling stability is a significant parameter to evaluate the performance of energy storage materials. Fig. 3e shows the repeated charging–discharging process of the Co2P HNF electrode at a constant high current density of 5 A g−1. The Co2P HNF electrode displayed impressive cycling stability and coulombic efficiency. During the first 4000 cycles, the specific capacitance continuously increased from 285.9 F g−1 to 360.9 F g−1. More importantly, the specific capacitance remained at 356.6 F g−1 even after the subsequent 6000 cycles. This means that the Co2P HNF electrode retained 124.7% of the initial specific capacitance after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1.
The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was also determined to explore the electrical conductivity of the Co2P HNF electrode over a frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz under open-circuit conditions as shown in Fig. 4f. The diameter of the semicircle in the high frequency region, which is a decisive parameter for an electrode material, represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct); the intercept on the real Z axis in the high-frequency region is the internal resistance (Rs).37,41 The values of Rct and Rs were about 0.17 Ω and 0.64 Ω, respectively. The steep slope of the straight line in the low frequency region suggests a good capacitive behavior and a low electrolyte diffusion impedance.54,56,58 Therefore, the Co2P HNF electrode exhibited fast charging and ion transfer behavior. The high performance of the as-prepared Co2P HNFs can be attributed to the unique robust hollow structure, multiple oxidation states and high conductivity. Moreover, when used as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Co2P HNFs also exhibited moderate electrocatalytic performance (Fig. S4†).
To further evaluate the Co2P HNF electrode for use in supercapacitors in a practical application, an ASC was fabricated using Co2P HNFs as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode (Co2P HNF//AC).23 The electrochemical performance of the AC electrode was also tested in a 6 M KOH aqueous solution (Fig. S5†). Based on the discharge curves, the specific capacitance of the AC electrode was calculated to be 246.3, 235.3, 225.4, 218.8, 213.8, 209.6 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 A g−1. Thus, AC is an excellent negative electrode material for supercapacitors.
For the optimal performance, the two electrodes should satisfy the charge balance relationship q+ = q−.11,30 The optimal loading mass ratio between Co2P HNF and AC electrodes is m+/m− = (C− × ΔV−)/(C+ × ΔV+) = (246.3 × 1)/(412.7 × 0.75) = 0.8. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of the Co2P HNF electrode and the AC electrode at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, which indicates that the potential window of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC could be enlarged to 1.6 V. Because the large potential window is significant to improve the energy density of ASC, a series of CV curves of the Co2P HNFs//AC ASC with different potential windows at 20 mV s−1 is presented in Fig. 5b, to determine the optimal operating potential of the ASC.59 Remarkably, the operating potential of the ASC could be enlarged up to 1.7 V without clear polarization curves. To further ascertain the potential window, the CP curves of the ASC under potential windows from 0.8 to 1.7 V at 1 A g−1 were measured.59 As expected, no clear polarization appeared when the potential window increased to 1.7 V, consistent with the results in Fig. 5b. The specific capacitance of the ASC increased from 44.8 to 75.8 F g−1 when the potential window increased from 0.8 to 1.7 V (Fig. 5d). As the potential window increased from 0.8 to 1.7 V, the energy density of the ASC also increased dramatically from 4.0 to 30.4 W h kg−1. So an operation potential window of 1.7 V is deserved to study the electrochemical performance of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC.

(c) CP curves of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC measured at different potential windows at a current density of 1 A g−1. (d) Specific capacitance of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC measured at different potential windows at a current density of 1 A g−1. 

Fig. 6a shows the CV curves of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC at different scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1 within the potential window of 0–1.7 V in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The distorted, rectangular CV curves found at all of the scan rates indicate that both the pseudocapacitance from Co2P HNFs and the electric double-layer capacitance from AC contributed to the total capacitance of the ASC.23 The absence of clear shifts in the CV curve peaks indicates the excellent rate capability of the ASC. Fig. 6b shows the typical CP curves of the ASC measured at different current densities from 1 to 10 A g−1. Based on the discharge curves, the specific capacitance of the ASC was calculated to be 75.9, 70.9, 66.0, 61.8, 58.8, and 56.9 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 6c). A capacitance of 75.0% was maintained even at a high current density of 10 A g−1, demonstrating the excellent rate capability of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC. Fig. 6d presents the cycling performance of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC measured at a current density of 5 A g−1. Within the initial 4000 cycles, the specific capacitance of the ASC slightly increased from 62.1 to 66.4 F g−1, and remained at 67.1 F g−1 even after completing the subsequent 6000 cycles. This means that the Co2P HNF//AC ASC delivered 108.0% of its initial specific capacitance after 10000 continuous cycles. The coulombic efficiency of the ASC remained at about 99% throughout all 10000 cycles. These results reveal the outstanding cycling performance of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC.

To evaluate the energy storage ability of the Co2P HNF//AC ASC, Ragone plots based on the galvanostatic discharge curves are displayed in Fig. 7. The energy density of the prepared ASC reached 30.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 850 W kg−1, and maintained 22.8 W h kg−1 at a higher power density of 8500 W kg−1. Thus, the Co2P HNF//AC ASC outperformed many previously reported ASCs (Fig. 7), such as Co2P nanoflowers//AC (24 W h kg−1 at 300 W kg−1),30 amorphous Ni-P//AC (29.2 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1),23 NiCo2O4//AC (14.7 W h kg−1 at 175 W kg−1),36 NiCo2O4 hollow submicrospheres//AC (27.2 W h kg−1 at 375 W kg−1),60 NiCoO2/Ni foam//rGO (25.7 W h kg−1 at 1500 W kg−1).61 The Co2P HNF//AC is also comparable with some recently reported high-performance transition metal phosphide-based or phosphate-based ASCs.44,62–65 The high energy storage of the Co2P HNFs//AC ASC benefited from the large cell voltage of 1.7 V and the high specific capacitance. These results reinforce the promise of Co2P HNFs as an alternative material for supercapacitors.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a simple, one-step method to synthesize robust Co2P HNFs. Structural characterization studies disclosed that the Co2P HNFs are composed of nanorods and possessed abundant mesopores. Applied as an electrode material for supercapacitors, Co2P HNFs delivered a high specific capacitance of 412.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, superior capacity retention at high current densities, and an ultrahigh cycling stability. Additionally, the fabricated Co2P HNF//AC ASC possessed a long cycling lifespan, and exhibited a high energy density of 30.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 850 W kg−1. More importantly, the energy density output was 22.8 W h kg−1 even at a high power density of 8500 W kg−1. These results attest to the great potential of the Co2P HNF material for use in electrochemical energy storage fields.
