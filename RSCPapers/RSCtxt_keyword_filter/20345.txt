    , Accepted 10th June 2016First published on 10th June 2016AbstractWe perform density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemical calculations for the pentacene–PbSe hybrid interface at both molecular and crystal levels. At the interface, the parallel orientation of pentacene on the PbSe surface is found to be the most favorable, analogous to a pentacene–gold interface. The molecule-surface distance and the value of charge transfer from one pentacene molecule to the PbSe surface are estimated at around 4.15 Å and 0.12 e− respectively. We found that, standard-LDA/GGA-PBE/hybrid/meta-GGA xc-functionals incorrectly determine the band gaps of both pentacene and PbSe and leads to a failed prediction of the energy alignment in this system. So, we use a relativistic G0W0 functional and accurately model the electronic properties of pentacene and PbSe in both bulk material and near the interface. An energy shift of 0.23 eV, due to the difference in work function at the interface was supplemented after a detailed analysis of the electrostatic potential. The highest occupied molecular orbital level of pentacene is 0.01 eV above PbSe while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of pentacene lies 1.70 eV above PbSe, allowing both electrons and holes to transfer along the donor–acceptor junction. Our results provide additional insights into the electronic structure properties of the pentacene–PbSe heterojunction and establish it as a promising and efficient candidate for photovoltaic applications.
1 Introduction
In this century, the scarcity of efficient power sources and the pollution to the environment created by fossil fuels have gradually become major global problems.1 Researchers are seeking cleaner forms of energy as alternatives to fossil fuels. Among all of the renewable energy sources, solar cells have attracted the most attention lately because of their ability to harvest energy directly from the sun and convert it into electricity.2 Solar energy can be considered as an infinite source of a clean, sustainable and renewable energy with no ill side-effects on humanity. A typical photovoltaic cell consists of an acceptor semiconducting layer and a donor semiconducting layer, sandwiched with each other and thus referred to as a donor–acceptor (D–A) junction. There have been several efficient solar cells proposed. For example, fully inorganic nanocrystalline solar cells are widely used for their long term stability and high efficiency. In particular, CdS/CdTe thin film with a power conversion efficiency of 15.8%,3,4 or Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 with a power conversion efficiency of 9.0%.5 However, most of the commercial solar cells made from inorganic semiconductors (ISCs) contain rare earth elements like In, Cd and Te. Higher costs and the restrictions on the availability of these elements limit the widespread usage of inorganic solar cells.6–8 Over the past years, organic photovoltaics (OPV) have become the main focus of research due to their physical flexibility and cheaper/easier processing compared to inorganic photovoltaics. They are generally processed at lower temperatures which reduces the energy consumption during the manufacturing process. P3HT:PCBM (poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) are some of the most successful materials discovered in the field of organic electronics, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) resulting from their use reaching over 10%.9,10 However, the instability of OPV devices is the major obstacle preventing them from succeeding in commercial applications. For example, due to oxygen induced degradation, the short circuit current in P3HT:PCBM reduces by 70%.11 Moreover at high temperatures, PCBM diffuses into P3HT, leading to the formation of extended PCBM crystals and thus reducing device quality.12
Recently, hybrid solar cells have attracted considerable attentions as emerging photovoltaic technologies made up of both organic and inorganic semiconductor materials. They combine advantages of both inorganic and organic solar cells; such as, lower costs, mechanical flexibility and environmental stability. Additionally, hybrid cells are able to utilize the high mobility of the inorganic phase to surpass the low charge transport mobility limitation in the organic phase for high solar power conversion devices.13 High electron and hole mobilities, controllable nanomorphology, and a well-structured interface are necessary for the design of efficient hybrid solar cells.14 Recently a pentacene–PbSe hybrid solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of up to 4.7% has been reported.15 It is well-known that pentacene (Pc) is one of the best organic semiconductors (OSCs) that exhibits a high hole mobility of 3 cm2 V−1 cm−1 in thin film organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).16 Pc carrier mobility surpasses amorphous silicon used in commercial electronic devices. In an ultrapure crystal where 6,13-pentacenequinone has been removed, Pc can exhibit a hole mobility of 35 cm2 V−1 cm−1, one of the highest values among all other OSCs, with excellent charge transfer properties.17 Moreover, Pc has a considerably smaller band gap (∼2.2 eV) compared to other OSCs (large band gaps of ∼2.0–5.0 eV),18 allowing electrons in the material to be more easily excited when absorbing visible light.19,20 Thus, Pc is a potential candidate for a donor in a D–A junction. On the other hand, PbSe as an inorganic semiconductor (ISC) has high potential to be an acceptor due to its large carrier mobility, good photo- and chemical stability as well as its tunable band gaps.14 Using nano-crystalline PbSe of various sizes can improve the performance of the acceptor because they can absorb a broader range of frequencies.15 The investigation of the Pc–PbSe interface will give a clear picture about the energy levels at the interface and the mechanism of generation and splitting of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this article, various DFT methods including GGA-PBE,21 LDA,22 mBJ,23 hybrid functional (HSE),24 and GW approximation will be compared together to search for the most effective method to construct the energy-band diagram of Pc–PbSe systems, both inside the bulk and near the interface where energy level alignment plays an important role. Unfortunately, the computational cost for the GW or HSE calculations are very high because of the complexity of the methods as well as the shear size of the system. As a consequence, the electronic structure calculation of PbSe–Pc interface is absent in the literature. A better understanding of the mechanism described here and the electronic properties behind the carrier transfer will help us to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices.
2 Computational methods
(a) For DFT bulk calculations
We used Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) that employs the projector augmented wave (PAW) technique25 and for the exchange functional, we used localized density approximation (LDA),22 generalized gradient approximation by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)21 and multiple types of hybrid functionals (HSE).24 In particular, we utilized HSE06, with a screening parameter of μ = 0.2 Å−1 for the HSE hybrid xc-functional that includes AEXX = 25% exact-exchange. In addition, HSE03 (μ = 0.3 Å−1, AEXX = 25%), B3LYP (μ = 0 Å−1, AEXX = 20%), PBE0 (μ = 0 Å−1, AEXX = 25%) and pure Hartree–Fock (μ = 0 Å−1, AEXX = 100%) type calculations were performed. We also employed modified Becke–Johnson (mBJ) type of meta-GGA functional in combination with LDA and GGA-PBE.23 The quasi-particle (QP) G0W0 calculation involves the single-shot correlation to the DFT eigenvalues by means of the self-energy (=iGW), where G is the Green's function and W is the screening,26 which are obtained from the dielectric function based on K–S (Kohn–Sham) wavefunctions.27 This is generally calculated using the linear response theory under a random phase approximation (RPA) including the local field effects.28 One can further improve the QP approximation by using a self-consistent GW (sc-GW) technique29,30 that includes the information on how the screening affects the vacuum energy and the QP wavefunction. However, it has been reported that the sc-GW method overestimates the band gap since it neglects the lattice polarization contribution to the screening of the electron–electron interaction.30,31 Hence, we only used the G0W0 method, as it produces comparatively accurate band gaps and electronic structures because of “a partial cancellation of errors: the underestimation of the band gap opening is compensated by the neglect of the band gap shrinkage due to the lattice polarization”.31
The lattice parameters for bulk-PbSe were collected from the experimental data32 (a = 6.128 Å, space group = 225/Fmm). Starting with these values, we independently relaxed the lattice parameters and the atomic positions for both LDA and GGA functionals with force and energy convergence criteria of 0.001 eV Å−1 and 10−6 eV respectively. A plane-wave energy cutoff of 450 eV for the expansion of the K–S orbitals and an electronic temperature of kBT ≈ 0.2 eV was used with all energies extrapolated to T = 0 K. After optimization, we obtained the equilibrium lattice parameters: a = 6.0382 Å (LDA) & 6.2046 Å (GGA). The cubic nano-crystals were created using the same optimized lattice parameters (GGA) and placed in a sufficiently big unit cell (a = 24 Å) in order to avoid mutual interactions. On the other hand, Pc crystal structure was taken from the Cambridge crystallographic database sample 50783 (a = 6.239 Å, b = 7.636 Å, c = 14.330 Å, Z = 2 and α = 76.98°, β = 88.14°, γ = 84.42°).33 Since, the standard DFT mechanism neglects the van der Waal's intermolecular forces, we utilized the van der Waal's formulation implemented in VASP by J. Klime et al.34 and originally proposed by Dion et al.,35 in order to optimize the Pc structure. After performing full relaxation, we obtained the final structure (a = 6.419 Å, b = 8.013 Å, c = 14.761 Å and α = 75.57°, β = 87.59°, γ = 84.86°) and used it for the next calculations. For bulk-PbSe and bulk-Pc we chose a Γ-centered k-point mesh of 8 × 8 × 8 and 6 × 6 × 3. For all the DOS plots, we used the tetrahedron method with Blöchl correction for accurately determination of the band gaps.
(b) For the calculation of charge transfer and adsorption energy
We constructed the interface between the PbSe-surface and monolayer (ML) Pc. The PbSe(001) surface was chosen for modeling the Pc/PbSe interface since it is comparatively more stable than the PbSe(011) and PbSe(111) surfaces with small surface rumbling and relaxation.36,37 PbSe(011) and(111) surfaces have more than one saturated bond and the dangling bonds introduce surface states at the middle of the band gap. However, the PbSe(001) band gap is not affected by the dangling bond and also does not introduce the surface sates at the band gap. Thus, the PbSe(001) surface has the ability to be self-passivated. In order to save computational time, the use of pseudo-hydrogen to passivate the surface of PbSe is not necessary.36,38 The suitable orientation of Pc on the PbSe surface was calculated using Gaussian package with B3PW91/GEN hybrid xc functional that incorporates a combination of Becke3(B3) exchange functional and Perdew–Wang (PW91). The quasi-relativistic pseudopotential LANL2DZ (Los Alamos National Laboratory) was used for Se and heavy atoms like Pb using the 6d 10f-component Cartesian basis sets to describe the 1s to 4f core electrons.39 Standard basis set 6-31G(d,p) was used for C and H.
(c) For obtaining the level alignment
A thick PbSe slab was created (a = 18.115 Å, b = 6.038 Å, c = 16.000 Å and α = β = γ = 90°) with ≥12 Å vacuum separation between two slabs (along z direction) for VASP calculation incorporating the periodic boundary conditions. Frozen core charges were represented with pseudopotentials of the Vanderbilt form40 utilizing the PAW framework.25 All-electron PAW data set was used for H and for C; 1s electrons were kept frozen. For Pb and Se, states below 5d and 4s respectively, were kept frozen. A Γ-centered k-point mesh of 3 × 6 × 3 was used. For the G0W0 calculation, the energy cut-off for the response function was chosen as 100 eV, which is sufficient to give the QP shift in most of the cases within an accuracy of 0.01–0.02 eV. A mesh of 60 frequency grid points were included. The electronic density and wave functions were calculated with a higher number of unoccupied bands: nunocc = 150 unit per cell.
3 Results and discussion
In the experiments presented in the literature,15,41 5 nm Pc is evaporated on a 0.1 mm thick ITO-coated glass substrate under vacuum. Then nano-crystalline PbSe films were deposited and spin coated in a layer by layer method (Fig. 1). The nano-crystals consist of various sizes in order to capture different wavelengths of the solar spectrum.
 Fig. 1  The schematic diagram shows the pentacene and PbSe nano-crystal deposited on ITO + glass substrate. Infra-red radiation from solar spectra is absorbed in a PbSe layer and the high energy orange-yellow part of the spectrum is absorbed in pentacene. The diagram below shows that after the photon absorption, electrons and holes are transferred from pentacene to PbSe and from PbSe to pentacene respectively. 
In order to understand the charge transfer properties and optical activity of the system, a detailed study of the electronic structure is needed. Using DFT calculations, an accurate description of the ground state of the electronic levels is provided, which is useful to describe this hybrid photovoltaic. Because of the complexity of the system, standard LDA or GGA formalism is insufficient to produce an accurate description of electronic structures. More computationally demanding methods like HSE and GW methods produce better electronic properties, but are feasible for smaller systems. Hence, we divide the system into three parts. As shown in Fig. 1, the left section is pristine Pc lattice, the central part is the interface region and the section on the right is bulk PbSe. We also model the PbSe nano-crystals for calculating the dependency of the electronic structures on their sizes.
3.1 Bulk and monolayer pentacene
Pc molecules adopt a herringbone arrangement in the bulk material crystal structure. These organic molecules are bonded with each other by van der Waals (vdW) forces. So for optimizing the atomic positions within the unit cell, the vdW force should be taken into account. Thus, we use vdW-DFT method to relax the Pc crystal structure. Based on the optimized crystal structure, various methods are used to compare the band gap of bulk Pc. We compute the Pc electronic structure using LDA and GGA-PBE xc potential and obtain a band gap of 0.75 eV and 0.70 eV respectively, while keeping most of the DOS features intact. In contrast, the experimental band gap of this structure is 2.20 eV,42 which proves standard DFT underestimates the band gap of semiconductors.29 It is well known that meta-GGA functionals like modified Becke–Johnson (mBJ) produces realistic band gaps for semiconductors.23 However, when we use the non self-consistent mBJ functional as implemented in VASP, the calculation diverges. The reason is that the organic molecules have a large intermolecular distance, where the electron density and the kinetic energy density approach zero and the functional becomes unstable. A hybrid functional is a good compromise between the GGA-PBE and Hartree–Fock potential. We use several hybrid functionals in order to obtain a reasonable band gap for the Pc lattice. The results are presented in Fig. 2. Although changing various hybrid functional improves the band gap, it is still underestimated compared to the experiments. The obtained values of the band gap are 1.15 eV for HSE03, 1.25 eV for HSE06, 1.65 eV for B3LYP and 1.90 eV for PBE0. However, pure Hartree–Fock type calculation provides a highly overestimated band gap of around 3.7 eV. Hence, we perform the G0W0 method that produces the most accurate band gap of 2.25 eV (Fig. 3) and illustrates a significant improvement over standard DFT.

3.2 Bulk and nano-crystalline PbSe
Bulk PbSe is a narrow gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.27 eV.43 For photovoltaic applications, PbSe crystals were miniaturized to quantum dot sizes and used as acceptors. Experimentally, the quantum dot sensitized solar cell is most efficient when the band gap of the PbSe nano-crystal is within 0.7–0.9 eV.41 A proper estimation of band gap is required for bulk PbSe in order to select the appropriate functional.
In Fig. 4 and 5 we compare the DOS of bulk PbSe without and with spin–orbit (so) coupling effect respectively. Since Pb is a heavy element from the 6p-series, inclusion of spin–orbit coupling is necessary to improve the description of electronic structures. We compared the band gap using our full arsenal of techniques including, standard LDA/GGA, mBJ, HSE and GW methods. The calculated values of band gap from Fig. 4 and 5 are: 0.14 eV (LDA), 0.41 eV (GGA-PBE), 0.70 eV (mBJ-LDA), 0.99 eV (mBJ-GGA), 0.70 eV (HSE03), 1.53 eV (PBE0), 0.43 eV (G0W0), 0.19 eV (mBJ-LDA + so), 0.03 eV (mBJ-GGA + so) and 0.24 eV (G0W0 + so). So, it is clear from these values that LDA underestimates band gap whereas GGA-PBE overestimates it, similar to previous calculations.44 Also the HSE and mBJ methods overestimate it. The most appropriate value of the band gap is obtained with G0W0 including spin–orbit interaction.

The dielectric constant for the bulk PbSe (Fig. 6) is consistent with the previous experimental observations.45 Including plenty of empty bands produces a reasonable description of electronic excitation and frequency dependent dielectric spectra both under standard GGA exchange functional as well as RPA. The imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε2) features the peaks which are more clearly visible without considering RPA. For example, the first peak at E1 represents the band gap at which the first electronic excitation occurs and the reflectivity peak (E3) has the highest magnitude.

3.3 Interfacial interaction between pentacene and PbSe
Pc is a π-conjugated molecule in which electrons have been delocalized throughout the structure giving the system a good conductivity. We performed DFT/B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) calculation for single molecular Pc in the gas phase using the Gaussian package.
Pc exhibits a small calculated band gap (compared to other OSCs) of 2.19 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental band gap of about 2.20 eV.42 Since a semiconductor will only absorb the energy of a photon equal to or greater than its band gap, a small band gap in Pc (2.2 eV) compared to other large band gap OSCs (2.0–5.0 eV)18 allows electrons to be excited from HOMO to LUMO levels more easily. Moreover, the HOMO level of Pc in a gas phase is estimated at −4.69 eV below the vacuum level and the calculated ionization energy is about 6.13 eV. Experiments have confirmed that a HOMO level of a p-type material needs to lie more than 5.2 eV below the vacuum level to be stable.46 A high HOMO level will allow electrons to be removed from the HOMO more easily enabling the material to function as an electron donating material and hole transport medium.

3.3.1 Orientation of pentacene on PbSe and charge trasfer. 
Next, we examine the orientation of Pc on the PbSe surface and the relevant charge transport properties near the Pc–PbSe interface by inserting one single Pc molecule on top of the PbSe surface, constructed as shown in Fig. 7. From now on, we take a primary unit of PbSe (a = b = c = 3.102 Å) as a starting point, and constantly repeat it along a, b and c axes. Fig. 7 shows a slab of a 7 × 7 × 1 supercell. The distance between the center of mass in Pc and the PbSe slab is approximately 5.974 Å. A single point calculation is performed on the whole system using the B3PW91/GEN functional. The basis set of lighter C and H atoms is set as 6-31G(d,p) while heavier atoms like Pb and Se are treated with the basis set of polarized LANL2DZ ECP. LANL basis sets are known to perform faster calculations without any loss of accuracy, and are mainly used for transition metals.47 In order to estimate the adsorption energy (Eads), the energy of the PbSe slab (EPbSe), energy of Pc (EPc) and the energy of the interface (EPc+PbSe) are calculated independently using the same functional. The adsorption energy (Eads) is defined as follows: Eads = EPc+PbSe − EPc − EPbSe(1)
 Fig. 7  The side view (A) and the front view (B) of the molecular packing structure of pentacene–PbSe at a different angle. The atoms are represented as: red (Se), orange (Pb), white (H) and black (C). 
The Pc molecule is rotated with an angle θ, while fixing the center of mass of the molecule (Fig. 7). The physisorption of Pc on PbSe is considered and the adsorption energy is estimated. The charge transfer is obtained by summing up the total Mulliken charge on each atom in Pc and PbSe slab.
Our calculation shows that the lowest adsorption energy is obtained at 0°, which indicates the parallel structure to be the most stable packing where the whole molecule of Pc is projected on the surface of PbSe (Fig. 8). After summing up the Mulliken charge over the atoms in the Pc fragment and PbSe surface separately, we observed a total charge transfer of approximately 0.097 electrons (e−) from a Pc molecule to the PbSe surface. This means that the Pc molecule, as a donor, has transferred electrons to PbSe which has a role of an acceptor. This feature clearly illustrates the D–A junction characteristics at the Pc and PbSe interface. Interestingly, the least favorable packing is observed when the Pc molecule is aligned perpendicularly to the PbSe surface (θ = 90°) and the charge transfer reaches its lowest value (around 0.020 e− per Pc). The highest charge transfer from Pc to PbSe is about 0.135 e− at the angle of 45–50°, however it is energetically not stable. The parallel arrangement suggests that the PbSe surface is attracted by the π-electron density of carbon atoms in the aromatic rings of the Pc molecules.
 Fig. 8  The calculated total adsorption energy (top) and Mulliken charge transfer (bottom) between pentacene and PbSe as a function of the angle (θ). 
This result is similar to the case of Pc–Au interaction, where Pc is held parallel on top of the Au surface.48
Since, Pc favors the parallel stacking on the PbSe surface, our next goal is to predict the distance from Pc to PbSe by monitoring the adsorption energy. We fix the tilting angle between the two systems (θ in Fig. 7) at 0° and examine the evolution of the calculated adsorption energy and charge transfer as a function of the intermolecular distance of Pc and PbSe surface (dsurf). We find that the most stable distance from Pc to the PbSe surface is ∼4.15 Å with an adsorption energy of ∼−1.21 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 9A). The charge transfer from Pc to PbSe at 4.15 Å is ≈0.123 e−. By varying the range of surface distances, we observe the charge transfer from Pc to Pbse is between 0 and 0.35 e− (Fig. 9B). When the distance is more than 6 Å, no charge transfer was observed.
 Fig. 9  The calculated total adsorption energy (top) and charge transfer (bottom) between pentacene and PbSe as a function of the surface distance (dsurf). 
Now setting the parallel alignment of Pc on top of the PbSe surface at a distance of 4.15 Å, we consider the charge transfer as a function of the expansion of the PbSe surface along the a and b axes (Fig. 10A). As we observe, the charge transfer starts to converge when the area of PbSe = 220 Å2 (5 × 5 × 1) and remain stable for area of ≥430 Å2 (7 × 7 × 1). The electron transfer from Pc to PbSe converges at ≈0.12 e−. Therefore, beyond 220 Å2, the charge transfer is practically independent to the expansion of the PbSe surface. Next, we consider the expansion of the PbSe surface along the c-axis while fixing the area at 430 Å2 (7 × 7 × 1 slab). We increase the layers of PbSe and at the first layer, the charge transfer begins to converge and levels off above 2 layers of PbSe (Fig. 10B). We finally conclude that the average charge transfer from Pc to PbSe is about 0.12 e− at a distance of 4.15 Å from a 2-layers thick PbSe surface (calculated by B3PW91 functional). We note that a partial Mulliken charge calculation has been performed by summing all the charge over the atoms in the Pc fragment and the PbSe slab separately. As a result, there is a charge transfer from Pc to PbSe. A positive charge of 0.12 e− was obtained on Pc while a negative charge of −0.12 e− was obtained on the PbSe surface after an interfacial contact. As a result of charge transfer, a dipole moment has been formed between Pc and PbSe. For example, a dipole moment value of 1.61 D was obtained on the (7 × 7 × 1) slab. The direction of the dipole moment is along the c* axis. Thus, the interaction of Pc and PbSe is not based on chemical bonding, but a weak vdW force that holds the Pc molecule to the surface. This might be the reason why the parallel structure is the most stable one since the π-electrons on the conjugated molecule are projected on the surface of PbSe.

To justify our Gaussian calculations, we calculate the adsorption energy at the interface using vdW-DF/revPBE in which the vdW force is taken into account. The interface structure is shown in Fig. 11. The result shows the smallest adsorption energy is at 4.04 Å from Pc to the PbSe surface which agrees well with the distance of 4.15 Å using the Gaussian estimation.

3.3.2 Electrostatic potential and the level alignment. 
Experimentally it is difficult to deduct the band gap and energy bands of organic–inorganic hybrid photovoltaics because of the large difference in transport and optical gaps in organic molecules.49,50
In several cases the alignment of vacuum levels cannot take place because of the existence of inter-facial dipole or the inter-facial bonding effects which, give rise to a vacuum level shift of ΔW. The vacuum level is defined as the asymptotic value of the electrostatic potential far away from the surface. The difference between the vacuum energy level and the HOMO level is defined as the work function (W).
The planer average of the electrostatic potential [Epot(c)] can be obtained by solving the Poisson's equations.51 In order to obtain the vacuum energy level close to the Pc and PbSe side, we add 1.2 nm vacuum along the c-direction of the unit cell. As shown in Fig. 12, we obtain the electrostatic potential along the c direction. Without a Pc layer on top, the work function of the PbSe surface is W1 = 4.27 eV and in addition of the Pc molecule changes the work function to W2 = 4.04 eV. Hence the vacuum level shifts or the difference in work function ΔW = 0.23 eV is needed to adjust the energy levels of the heterojunction.

The red dotted line represents the electrostatic potential for the PbSe surface and the blue solid line represents the same parameter when a pentacene molecule is placed on top. W1 and W2 are the work function from the PbSe surface and pentacene respectively. Zero corresponds to the Fermi level. The inset shows the difference in work function between two semiconductors. 


3.3.3 Density of states and the band diagram. 
The electronic structure and the density of states for the interface between Pc and PbSe are obtained using the GGA-PBE potential. In Fig. 13, it is shown that the PbSe DOS features remain almost the same compared to the bulk DOS. The top of the valence band coincides with EF. On the other hand, Pc DOS experiences a bigger change. The HOMO for Pc shifts 0.24 eV below EF. A bandgap value of 0.58 eV is lower than that which was observed in the experiments.42 Also, the LUMO of Pc lies below the PbSe conduction bands, which prohibits the electron transfer from the donor to acceptor. So we decided to perform the more accurate G0W0 calculation for the interface with the same unit cell shown in Fig. 12; the result is drawn in Fig. 13. Since a fully self-consistent GW method is computationally very challenging in this substantially big unit cell with 108 atoms, we used standard perturbative quasiparticle approximation (G0W0) to obtain the electronic structure.52,53 Recent developments verify that G0W0 is well capable of improving the band gaps of sp-electron systems like Pc.29 The result shows that the Pc band gap is almost unaffected by the adsorption. Compared to the bulk Pc with a band gap of 2.25 eV, in Fig. 13 the band gap for Pc is found to be 2.11 eV. However, the DOS shifts towards lower energy for the interfacial Pc (Fig. 13) molecule compared to the bulk DOS (Fig. 3). This is the result of charge transfer between the interfacial Pc and the PbSe surface. Since the HOMO of Pc lies lower in energy compared to the PbSe surface, it works as a blocking layer for the holes to transfer back into PbSe. However, far from the junction the charge transfer decreases (illustrated in Section 3.3.1), and the bands bend.54 Thus the Pc and PbSe energy levels will behave like bulk levels. As a result, Pc bands bend upward and PbSe bands bend downward, allowing the hole and electron transfer between them. Instead the photogenerated holes transfer in the bulk-like Pc layer. A very small number of surface-states55 appear because of the sudden termination or the bond-breaking near the surface. However after relaxation, those states disappear. The G0W0 DOS have comparatively less details than the GGA-PBE DOS because of the smaller k-point sampling mesh used for G0W0. As we discussed earlier, the quasiparticle approximation under the G0W0 method (without spin–orbit) increases the band gap for PbSe. So a modified band gap of 1.15 eV is obtained from Fig. 13 which is slightly exaggerated similar to the bulk PbSe. However this value is ideal for transferring the photoelectrons from the Pc conduction bands.

Since the G0W0 method provides a reliable electronic structure and band gap as discussed in the previous sections, we construct the band diagram based on that method for accuracy and consistency. Fig. 14 shows the band diagram after vacuum level alignment. Photo-electrons from the visible (yellow-orange) and infra-red range of the solar spectrum are absorbed by the Pc and PbSe quantum dots. For simplicity, the bulk value of the PbSe band gap is used. The excited electrons from Pc are transferred to the PbSe section, where electrons from both Pc and PbSe are transported towards anode, opposite to the photocurrent. The conduction band offset at the PbSe–Pc interface provides an energy barrier that prevents photogenerated electrons (Fig. 14) from flowing along the same direction as the current. Whereas the valence band offset provides an additional driving force for the flow of photogenerated holes from PbSe to the Pc layer. The interfacial band bending generates an additional minor contribution to the improvement of photocurrent. The band bending at the interface implies the creation of a depletion zone adjacent to this junction, which effectively broadens the overall depletion width in the PbSe/Pc light-absorbing layer. This is a similar effect to that reported previously in graded doping devices, where concentration through the ligand exchange expands the depletion zone.57,58 This extension can marginally (≤5%) boost the photocurrent.58 In the context of this work, the energy alignment of Pc–PbSe (Fig. 14) has been performed in the ground state. In reality, it is worth to mention that when a photon is absorbed by conjugated organic molecules to create a singlet exciton with energy E(Sn) and the lowest lying triplet state has energy E(T1) [for, E(T1) < E(Sn)/2], the energy E(Sn) undergoes fission and splits into two triplet pairs. The lowest singlet of pentacene has an experimental energy of E(S1) [(=1.83 eV) and the experimental lowest lying triplet state of Pc E(S1) (=0.86 eV), shown in Fig. 14] is energetically favorable.56 Thus, the singlet exciton is expected to occur following absorption of a photon, and forms two coupled triplet excitons. The triplet excitons then diffuse into the heterojunction and form two triplet charge transfer states and the electrons are transferred to the inorganic acceptors. Thus, during singlet fission, other states with lower energy levels [E(T1) < E(S1)/2] representative of two triplet charge transfer states might appear instead of the S1 state (LUMO level in Fig. 14) at the interfacial energy alignment, resulting in a two-fold gain in efficiency as is described in the case of Pc–C60.59 A similar energy alignment is shown in rubrene–C60 heterojunction.60 However, the process and the effect of exciton-generation by the absorption of photons are challenges in DFT calculations and thus, should be fully investigated in future. In the framework of this article, only the ground state energy alignment using various DFT and G0W0 methods are covered.

The red and the violet dotted lines represent the edges of the visible range of the spectra. The irradiation is maximum for the photon energy range between 2–3 eV. Schematic band diagram (bottom) aligned with the vacuum energy level, represents the energy levels obtained in the G0W0 calculation. The donor (Pc) and acceptor (PbSe) absorb the orange–yellow and infrared radiation respectively. HOMO of Pc is 0.23 eV below the Fermi level. The top of the valence band in PbSe perfectly aligns with the Fermi level. The photo-generated holes transfer from PbSe to Pc. Similarly an e− transport through the depletion zone is feasible due to the 1.70 eV energy difference in LUMO levels between the two sides. The red dotted line represents triplet state, as mentioned in ref. 56. 
For photovoltaic applications, nano-crystalline PbSe with various sizes/shapes are employed for absorbing a wide spectral range in infrared bands.41,61 This is because the band gap of nano crystals are highly dependent on their sizes. In order to understand how size influences the electronic structure, we examine their band gap (using GGA-PBE) as a function of their size (Fig. 15a). For the smallest nano crystal, band gap is 1.41 eV, which is much higher than the value in bulk PbSe. With increasing size, the quantum confinement effect and the Brus equation62 reduce the band gap and approach the bulk value with a sufficiently big cluster. We also perform similar calculation for the Pc–PbSe nano crystal interface (Fig. 15b) and calculated the band gap from partial DOS. The band gap of Pc remains constant at around ∼0.9 eV whereas it decreases for PbSe as shown in Fig. 15a. Similar calculation for the nano crystalline PbSe–Pc interface with the G0W0 method is computationally very challenging at this moment. However, the Pc band gap remains constant with increasing nano crystal size under GGA, we expect a similar trend with the G0W0 method also, and the band gap of Pc stays fixed at ∼2.11 eV. We stress that although cubic nano clusters are investigated in this work, the conclusion should remain same for other shapes of nano-clusters (sphere or cylinder).

4 Concluding remarks
In this article, we have discussed the structure and electronic properties of the Pc–PbSe interface for photovoltaic applications. Because of the efficient absorption of the solar spectrum by both Pc at high frequency and PbSe nano crystals at the low frequency infrared region, the power conversion efficiency of the device increases. In addition to this, high charge transport mobility in Pc, and the effective charge separation also raise the photocurrent. We study the bulk pentacene and PbSe in order to accurately determine the electronic structure and optical response. PbSe nano clusters absorb various wavelengths of the solar spectrum,15 which is demonstrated by means of a bandgap-dependence on the size of the PbSe clusters. We show that the G0W0 method brings significant improvement over LDA or GGA xc functionals that underestimate the band gap of the system. We determine the stable orientation of Pc near the PbSe surface and find the parallel orientation of Pc on top of the PbSe surface to be the most favorable structure. The optimum distance between Pc and PbSe is about 4.15 Å. The charge transfer from Pc to PbSe reaches a stable value of 0.12 e− beyond a 5 × 5 × 1 PbSe slab, independent of the expansion of the PbSe surface area and also the number of PbSe layers.
By means of analyzing the electrostatic potential and the difference in work function, we perform energy level alignment near the PbSe–Pc interface. Since the Pc–PbSe bilayer absorbs 44% more light than PbSe itself,41 it is essential to obtain the accurate electronic structure near the junction which is obviously not possible by standard DFT with the GGA-PBE functional as described earlier. The G0W0 calculation for the interface is performed in order to correctly represent the band diagram for the interface. We have discovered that a significant difference in LUMO level (1.7 eV) of Pc–PbSe allows electrons to transport from donor to acceptor. On the other hand, the small difference in HOMO level (0.04 eV) creates a small energy barrier that allows holes to transport back from acceptor to donor. Specifically, we have shown that the PbSe nano crystal bandgap is significantly dependent on their size whereas the Pc bandgap remains fairly constant. The advantage of PbSe nano crystals is their ability to tune the bandgaps with modulation of their size. This makes them desirable for photovoltaic applications as the energy levels of HOMO and LUMO can be aligned optimally.
We note that there are a few concerns over the toxicity of lead in the environment, which dissolves in the water and creates “free” Pb++ ions that are highly toxic. However, PbSe is a non-metallic substance and not soluble in water.63 The exposure pathway is usually via direct contact to lead. So the material should be enclosed and covered in a protective material before industrial utilization. It is worth noting that these materials should be recycled after disposal as electronic waste.64 A study conducted in Australia in 2004 showcased that despite the use of cadmium or lead as a main component for photovoltaic devices, coal combustion is still the main contributor to environmental and health risks. Moreover, the emissions from photovoltaic devices remain 32 times below those emitted by fossil fuels.65 Looking into the future, we hope there will be some major changes in the organic–inorganic semiconductors based photovoltaics, both in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. A detailed theoretical understanding and the band gap engineering will improve the future solar cell efficiency beyond 5% with organic materials. The synthesis of variable size, low band gap inorganic nano crystals can increase light absorption and carrier mobility. On top of this, proper selection of the shell materials, like ZnO for nano crystal capping, due to their exceptional resistance to oxidation degradation will help to improve photovoltaic devices.61
