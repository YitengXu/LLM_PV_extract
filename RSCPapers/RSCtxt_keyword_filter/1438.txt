Two polymers PThTITI and PSeTITI were developed by copolymerizing TITI with thiophene (Th) or selenophene (Se). Compared with PThTITI, PSeTITI possesses a lower bandgap and higher hole mobility. PThTITI:PC71BM and PSeTITI:PC71BM solar cells gave power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.53% and 6.17%, respectively.
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on a polymer/fullerene system have attracted a great deal of interest since their showing up in the photovoltaic field in 1995.1 These devices have advantages like low cost, light weight, solution processibility and flexibility. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction polymer solar cells (PSCs) reached 10.8%,2 bringing hope for commercialization in the near future. Donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers, which consist of donor units and acceptor units, are advancing rapidly because of their excellent optical and semiconducting properties.3 The ladder-type units, in which fused aromatic or heterocyclic subunits connect linearly by sharing endocyclic CC,4 demonstrate good functions as follows: (1) alkyl side-chains can be attached onto the polymers facilely to improve solubility; (2) the extended conjugation endows polymers with a broad absorption;5 (3) the structural planarity and rigidity favour intermolecular interactions, π–π stacking, enhancing hole mobility.3a,6 Some D–A copolymers with ladder-type units were reported by Zheng,5,6b,7 McCulloch,8 Hsu,9 Jen10et al., and PCEs over 9% were obtained.11 Most of the reported ladder-type units were used as donor units, and the ladder-type acceptor units need more exploration and development. Based on our previous work,11b,12 we developed a ladder-type acceptor unit thieno[3′,2′:3,4]isoquinolino[8,7-h]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-6,13(7H,14H)-dione (TITI) by replacing benzene of TPTI with naphthalene to extend the conjugation. Two D–A copolymers PThTITI and PSeTITI were synthesized by copolymerizing TITI with thiophene (Th) or selenophene (Se). Compared with PThTITI, PSeTITI possesses a lower bandgap, better crystallinity and higher hole mobility. PSeTITI:PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 6.17%.
The synthetic routes to TITI and target copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. 2,6-Dibromonaphthalene-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (1)6b reacted with oxalyl chloride and N-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-3-amine successively to produce compound 2. 2 was transformed into TITI in 66% yield via the intramolecular coupling reaction using Pd(OAc)2 and PCy3·HBF4 as the catalysts. In the 1H NMR spectrum, two double peaks for H on naphthalene and two double peaks for H on thiophenes confirm the chemical structure of TITI (Fig. S1, ESI†). The bromination of TITI gave a monomer TITI-Br in 89% yield. PThTITI and PSeTITI were synthesized by copolymerization of TITI-Br with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene or 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene via the Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in refluxing toluene. After Soxhlet extraction using methanol, hexane and chloroform successively, PThTITI and PSeTITI were obtained in high yields of 95% and 96%, respectively. With two octyldodecyl side chains, the target copolymers PThTITI and PSeTITI show good solubility in toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PThTITI and PSeTITI are 106.4 kDa and 88.8 kDa, with polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 2.72 and 3.59, respectively. Thermogravimetric analyses of the polymers are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Td of PThTITI and PSeTITI are 398 °C and 422 °C, respectively, indicating good thermal stability for solar cell application.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to PThTITI and PSeTITI. 
UV-vis absorption spectra of PThTITI and PSeTITI are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption maxima of PThTITI and PSeTITI in solution are located at 570 and 586 nm, while in thin films the absorption maxima of PThTITI and PSeTITI are at 579 and 597 nm, respectively. PSeTITI showed a narrower optical bandgap of 1.93 eV than that of PThTITI (2.00 eV), which might result from stronger electron-donating capability of selenophene.13 It should be noted that the optical bandgaps of PThTITI and PSeTITI are larger than those of pentacyclic TPTI-based copolymers PThTPTI and PSeTPTI (1.86 and 1.77 eV),12a,12b although extending conjugation length usually reduce optical bandgaps. As far as we know, this phenomenon is first observed for acceptor units with extended conjugation. The aromatic feature of the copolymers might get stronger when extending pentacyclic TPTI to hexacyclic TITI.14

The electrochemical properties of the polymers were measured by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4† and Table 1). The oxidation onset potentials (Eonox) of PThTITI and PSeTITI are 0.77 and 0.74 V, while the reduction onset potentials (Eonred) of PThTITI and PSeTITI are −2.20 and −2.02 V, respectively. According to the empirical formulas: HOMO = −(Eonox + 4.8) eV, LUMO = −(Eonred + 4.8) eV,15 the HOMO (LUMO) energy levels of PThTITI and PSeTITI are −5.57 eV (−2.60 eV) and −5.54 eV (−2.78 eV), respectively. Deep HOMO energy levels of donors lead to high Voc in BHJ solar cells.16 A lower LUMO of PSeTITI results in a lower bandgap.

Solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two polymers. Polymer:PC71BM blends were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) with the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive. The optimization of the D/A ratio is shown in Tables S1 and S5 (ESI†). The best D/A ratios were 1:1.5 and 1:1 (w/w) for PThTITI:PC71BM and PSeTITI:PC71BM solar cells, respectively. The active layers took no solvent or thermal annealing. J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are presented in Fig. 2b. The device performance data are listed in Table 2. The best PThTITI:PC71BM cell gave a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 8.28 mA cm−2, a FF of 69.8% and a PCE of 5.53%, and the best PSeTITI:PC71BM cell gave a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 9.35 mA cm−2, a FF of 70.5% and a PCE of 6.17%. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 3. Without DIO, PC71BM tends to aggregate during the film formation process, forming large domains (Fig. 3a and c). Adding DIO, PC71BM will not form large aggregates, and fibrous nano-structures can be observed in the blend films (Fig. 3b and d), providing more interface for exciton dissociation. DIO increased Jsc remarkably.

PSeTITI solar cells showed higher EQE values at 446–656 nm (Fig. 2b). Jsc calculated from EQE spectra are 7.89 and 8.93 mA cm−2 for PThTITI and PSeTITI cells, respectively. The hole mobilities of the blend films were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6, ESI†). The hole mobilities of PThTITI:PC71BM and PSeTITI:PC71BM blend films are 4.70 × 10−4 and 6.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher photocurrent from PSeTITI cells results from the higher mobility of PSeTITI. The XRD peaks of π–π stacking are located at 2θ = 24.81° for PThTITI and 2θ = 25.19° for PSeTITI, corresponding to d-spacings of 3.58 Å and 3.53 Å, respectively (Fig. 4). A distinct peak for PThTITI is located at 2θ = 4.12° and a much stronger peak for PSeTITI is at 2θ = 4.15°, corresponding to interlayer d-spacings of 21.4 Å and 21.3 Å, respectively. The PSeTITI film showing a strong peak at 2θ = 4.15° suggests that the film possesses a better long-range order for its nano-structure than the PThTITI film, and also indicates a higher crystallinity, which provides the basis for higher hole mobility.

Conclusions
A ladder-type acceptor unit TITI was developed for D–A copolymers. Two polymers PThTITI and PSeTITI were synthesized by copolymerizing TITI with thiophene (Th) or selenophene (Se) donor units. They possess deep HOMO levels and good hole mobilities, and PThTITI:PC71BM and PSeTITI:PC71BM solar cells gave PCEs of 5.53% and 6.17%, respectively. PSeTITI has a lower bandgap, better crystallinity, higher hole mobility, leading to better photovoltaic performance. TITI unit is now being used for developing high-performance donors.
