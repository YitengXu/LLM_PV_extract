Similar to natural photosynthesis, photochemical cofactor regeneration takes place in the light-dependent reaction zone, which is then coupled with the light-independent, enzymatic synthesis in the downstream of the microchannel.
Mimicking natural photosynthesis is an attractive route to developing sustainable systems for the conversion of solar energy into renewable resources.1 During the photosynthesis in green plants, both light-dependent and independent reactions take place simultaneously in the organelle of micron-sized chloroplasts that contain light-harvesting thylakoid membranes (Scheme 1A).2 In the light-dependent reaction, photo-induced electrons regenerate a reducing power in the form of nicotinamide cofactors, NAD(P)H, which is then consumed by redox enzymatic synthesis of organic compounds during light-independent reactions (i.e., Calvin cycle).3,4 The natural photosynthesis occurs in highly sophisticated, spatially arranged micro/nano-structures that provide mechanical support to the leaf and enable efficient transport of water, minerals, and photosynthates through microtube networks such as phloem and xylem in the plant.5–7 Many efforts have been made thus far to unveil the mechanism of photosynthesis and to further mimic natural photosynthesis;8–10 however, an integrated platform that enables the immobilization of light-harvesting components and the microfluidic transport of key chemicals for light-dependent/independent reactions is not well-developed.

The microfluidic platform incorporates CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) within the separate microchannel zones. Similar to photosynthesis in green plants, light-driven nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) regeneration takes place in the light-dependent reaction zone, which is then coupled with the light-independent, enzymatic synthesis of L-glutamate in the downstream of the microchannel. 
Microfluidics has received much attention over the past decade in diverse fields, including chemical synthesis, biological sensing, medical diagnostics, energy conversion, and environmental analysis.11–13 Recent advances in microfabrication technology have not only allowed the miniaturization of a conventional energy conversion system, but also the development of novel routes to energy conversion.12 For example, a micro-fuel cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy, providing portable power for mobile electronics.14 The miniaturized system can reduce the time and cost of bulk chemical processes with improved energy density, longer operation time, and more rapid recharge turn-around cycles than those of conventional fuel cells.14 Despite the high potential of microfabrication technology for renewable energy research, it has seldom been applied to the development of an integrated platform that can mimic natural photosynthesis.
Herein, we report on the development of a microfluidic artificial photosynthetic system for in situregeneration of reducing power (i.e., NADH cofactor) and redox enzymatic synthesis of fine chemicals under visible light. We fabricated microchannels using an imprint lithography technique, followed by in situ immobilization of a light-harvesting photosensitizer and redox enzyme in different zones of microchannels (Scheme 1B, Fig. 1). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was used to make microchannels that have high optical transparency, as PDMS exhibits reliable microchemical characteristics and high stability for running heterogeneous catalytic synthesis reactions.15–17 The microfluidic platform consisted of two layers: a top fluidic layer and a bottom valve layer (Fig. S3, ESI†), with a valve channel passing beneath the fluidic channel of a dimension of 500 μm (width) × 100 μm (height) × 10 cm (length). CdSe quantum dots (QDs) were used as a light-harvesting photosensitizer because their band gaps are suitable for absorbing visible light while possessing robust photostability.18,19 We used two kinds of CdSe QDs that have a maximum emission at 565 and 655 nm, respectively. Fig. S1† shows absorption and emission spectra of both 565 and 655-QDs, which indicate their broad range of visible light absorption and narrow emission spectrum. TEM bright field images revealed that these QDs were uniform in size, approximately 4 × 4 nm for 565-QD and 15 × 5 nm for 655-QD (Fig. S2, ESI†).

(A) Fluorescence microscopic image of the light-dependent reaction zone incorporating 565- or 655-CdSe QDs. Inset figures illustrate 655-QDs immobilized in the microchannel. (B) Photographic image of the platform taken under a 365 nm UV lamp. The platform taken under 365 nm UV lamp exhibited distinct red luminescence from 655-QDs along the light-dependent reaction zone. Inset is an image of the microfluidic platform. 
To separate zones for light-dependent and light-independent reactions, QDs and redox enzymes were covalently immobilized in upstream and downstream microfluidic zones, respectively. When we increased the pressure of the valve located in the center of fluidic channel through an air-injection hole, the thin membrane between the fluidic channel and the valve was deflected separating the main flow for the two reaction zones as a barrier (Fig. S3, ESI†). When the pressure was released, the membrane was restored to its original shape and the main flow resumed. We injected 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane solution into the microchannel during the open valve state for N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activation of the internal channel surface. Then, QDs and enzymes were seeded separately by covalent bonding to the amine-treated internal surfaces of each zone during the closed valve state. Fluorescence microscopic images of the microchannel showed bright green and red luminescence for 565- and 655-QDs, respectively (Fig. 1A). In particular, the microfluidic platform taken under the 365 nm UV lamp exhibited distinct red luminescence from 655-QDs along the light-dependent reaction zone, in contrast to no luminescence in the light-independent reaction zone (Fig. 1B). The images confirm that QDs were confined only in the light-dependent reaction zone without clustering, while still maintaining their brightness and uniformity. According to the XPS narrow scan analysis (Fig. S4†), no peak was observed in the absorption spectrum of QDs on a bare microchannel surface, whereas three strong peaks appeared in the case of QDs covalently bonded to the NHS-treated microchannel surface. Peaks in the Cd region at 411.9 and 405.4 eV were assigned to Cd3d3/2 and Cd3d5/2 binding energies and the peak at 54.2 eV observed in the Se energy region was attributed to Se3d transition,20 which are in agreement with binding energy values in the literature.21
We conducted visible-light driven NADH regeneration using microfluidic platforms that contain 565- or 655-CdSe QDs. Triethanolamine (TEOA) and pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl rhodium bipyridine {M = [Cp*Rh (bpy)H2O]2+, Cp* = C5Me5, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine} were used as a sacrificial electron donor and an electron mediator, respectively. The rhodium-based organometallic compound, M, has been applied as a hydride transfer mediator for indirect regeneration of NADH because of its high selectivity for the regeneration of enzymatically active NADH cofactors.22–25 To investigate the photo-induced electron transfer relationship between M and QDs, we analyzed their interaction using fluorescence spectroscopy. According to our observation, the fluorescence of 655-CdSe gradually decreased with the increasing concentration of M from 0 to 250 μM (Fig. S5, ESI†). The fluorescence-quenching implies that photo-excited electrons of CdSe, an electron donor, were transferred to M, an electron acceptor.
Results of photochemical regeneration of NADH in QD-immobilized microfluidic channels are shown in Table 1. NADH regeneration was performed by continuous injection of a feeding solution containing NAD+, TEOA, and M into the channel under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. We varied the flow rate of the solution from 6 μl h−1 to 36 μl h−1 to control the retention time. The regeneration yield of NADH was highly affected by the retention time as well as the light irradiation. As the retention time increased, the yield of regenerated NADH also increased as a result of longer photochemical reaction. For example, the reaction yield with the 655-QDs incorporated microchannel increased up to 27% for the retention times over 20 minutes (Table 1). At higher flow rates, interactions between photo-excited QDs and reaction components should become lesser than at slower flow rates. Under the dark state, however, no regeneration of NADH from NAD+ was observed in the microchannel, regardless of the flow rate. We also found that photoregeneration yield of NADH was higher with 655-QDs compared to 565-QDs (27% vs. 15% for 1 h, Table 1). We attribute this result to the much higher extinction coefficient of 655-CdSe QDs (2.9 × 106 cm−1 M−1 at 488 nm excitation) than that of 565-CdSe QDs (2.9 × 105 cm−1 M−1). Furthermore, 565-QDs have no extinction coefficients on a visible range over 570 nm.26 While materials having high extinction coefficients are known to increase the power conversion efficiency of solar energy,27NADH photo-regeneration for artificial photosynthesis occurs under the irradiation of full spectrum visible light; thus, high extinction coefficients of photosensitizers over a wide range of wavelengths are critical for increasing photochemical reaction yield. We further examined photocatalytic stability and repeated usability of microfluidic NADH photoregeneration. We found that the reaction yield was maintained up to approximately 27% (for 655-CdSe QD-immobilized channel) and 17% (for 565-CdSe QD-immobilized channel), without significant decrease in activity for repeated photoreactions up to 5 times (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating that immobilized QDs on the inner surface of the microchannel are stable during photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, immobilized QDs within the microchannel can avoid the dispersion problems and they do not require an additional separation step after photochemical reaction, in contrast to free QDs in a bulk solution system.

In order to couple the light-dependent NADH regeneration with a light-independent synthetic reaction, we conducted a redox enzymatic reaction by immobilizing L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), an oxidoreductase that can convert α-ketoglutarate to L-glutamate only in the presence of NADH (Scheme 1). The light reaction of CdSe QDs would result in the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, and the photoregenerated NADH is then oxidized by the surface-immobilized GDH that synthesizes L-glutamate in the light-independent zone. While an enzymatic reaction did not occur in the absence of light, with the irradiation of visible light, the conversion yield of L-glutamate became 73.5% at the flow rate of 9 μl h−1 for the 655-QDs-coated microchannel. However, the yield was significantly reduced to 26.3% at the flow rate of 18 μl h−1 (Fig. 2). We attribute this decrease to an insufficient amount of photoregenerated NADH at the high flow rate in the light-dependent reaction zone as discussed above (Table 1).
 Fig. 2  Photoenzymatic synthesis of L-glutamate by GDH in the microfluidic system that incorporates 655-CdSe QDs. The NADH photoregenerated by the light reaction of CdSe QDs is oxidized by the surface-immobilized GDH that synthesizes L-glutamate in the light-independent zone. 
In summary, we demonstrated a microfluidic artificial photosynthetic platform that incorporates QDs and GDH for light-induced NADH regeneration and photoenzymatic synthesis. Similar to natural photosynthesis, photochemical regeneration of the NADH cofactor takes place in the light-dependent reaction zone, which is then coupled with the light-independent, enzymatic synthesis in the downstream of the microchannel. Both yields of NADH regeneration and L-glutamate synthesis were significantly affected by the retention time and light availability. High stability of immobilized CdSe QDs and GDH within the separate microchannel zones allowed repeated photosynthesis. Our findings provide a new strategy for developing a sustainable, integrated light-harvesting system that mimics the natural photosynthetic process.
