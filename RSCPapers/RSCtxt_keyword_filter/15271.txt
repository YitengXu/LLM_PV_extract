The co-doping of Pr and N has a significant influence on the optical properties of ZnO. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) showed that Pr and N co-doping led to a red shift of the absorption edge of ZnO into the visible-light region. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) demonstrated that the band gap of ZnO was narrowed with the dopant atoms generating impurity sub-bands. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra demonstrated that Pr and N co-doping could successfully improve the light harvesting of a DSSC. The transient photovoltage (TPV) indicated that Pr and N co-doping increased the rate of charge separation and the electron lifetime. A dye-sensitized solar cell with Pr:N:ZnO as the anode exhibited a short-circuit photocurrent density as high as 13.84 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage of 590 mV, a fill factor of 0.63, and an overall light conversion efficiency of 5.2% under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation conditions.
Introduction
The semiconductor ZnO has become increasingly attractive for its exciting and unexpected properties compared to other semiconductors. Therefore, enormous effort has been devoted to the research of ZnO semiconductor materials, leading to a wide range of promising applications in a diverse range of areas, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1–5 lasers,6 field-effect transistors,7,8 and chemical/biological sensors.9,10 DSSCs based on ZnO films have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Control over the potential properties of ZnO photoelectrodes for DSSCs, such as the structure, crystallinity, shape, surface area, and nature of the electronic states, is crucial for device optimization. One of the first significant advances in developing ZnO-based DSSCs was the use of an array of aligned ZnO nanorods.11 The array of aligned ZnO provided a direct pathway for electron transport between the point of photogeneration and the conducting substrate, thus the probability of electron and dye recombination was reduced in the electron transport process. The performance of the fast electron transport in the aligned ZnO facilitated an improvement in the DSSC performance. In 2005, M. Law and co-workers fabricated a ZnO nanowire-based DSSC using a polyethylenimine-assisted hydrothermal method and obtained an overall efficiency of 1.5%.11 The core–shell structures of the ZnO nanowire system combined with layers of TiO2,12 MgO,13 CuO,14 or Au15,16 resulted in further increases in the overall light conversion efficiency to 2.25%.12 The arrays of aligned ZnO have been prepared using various methods, including metal–organic chemical vapor deposition,17 low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis,18 atomic layer deposition,19 and thermal decomposition.20 ZnO nanowires and their derivative hierarchical nanostructures, including nanotubes,21 flower-like nanowires,22 dendritic nanowires,23 and branched nanowires,24 have been intensively investigated as alternative photoelectrodes to improve the performance of DSSCs. However, the overall efficiency of DSSCs based on ZnO nanowires is low because of the low dye adsorption on the surface of the ZnO nanowires. In order to adsorb a sufficient amount of dye on to the ZnO surface, various rough ZnO nanostructures such as nanotetrapods,25 nanoflowers,26 nanotubes,21 nanosheets,27 nanofibers,28 and nanospheres29 have been prepared as photoelectrode materials, resulting in a higher conversion efficiency of 3.3%. In addition, element doping has been found to be effective for improving the solar energy conversion efficiency. A film consisting of ZnO nanocrystallite aggregates in the presence of Li ions demonstrated a high solar energy conversion efficiency of up to 6.1%.30 Recently, the effect of light scattering has been adopted as an effective means to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs. Oxide nanocrystallite aggregates can generate effective light scattering and therefore extend the travelling distance of light in the photoelectrode film. This results in an improvement in the light harvesting efficiency of the photoelectrode and the conversion efficiency of the DSSC.31 A solar energy conversion efficiency of 5.4% was achieved when a single light scattering layer containing ZnO nanocrystallite aggregates was used to improve the efficiency of a ZnO-based DSSC.31 Y.-Z. Zheng et al. prepared a ZnO photoelectrode with double light scattering layers consisting of monodisperse ZnO aggregates as an underlayer and sub-micrometer-sized plate-like ZnO as an overlayer.32 A solar energy efficiency of 3.4% was achieved by the formation of double light scattering, which was 47% higher than that of a DSSC formed using monodisperse aggregates. To date, the solar energy conversion efficiencies of ZnO-based DSSCs are low compared to TiO2-based DSSCs. Improving the conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs is still a challenge.
Doping has been found to be an effective way to modify the properties of semiconductors, and thus holds great promise for application in various types of devices. N is considered to be an optimal doping element for ZnO, which has received considerable attention in recent years for its theoretical and practical importance.33 Recently, studies on doping with rare earth elements have received considerable interest for their possible application in optoelectronics devices.34 Lanthanide (Ln) doped TiO2 down-conversion photoelectrodes (Ln = Eu, Sm) have been used to enhance the photovoltaic efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. The UV radiation harvesting of DSSCs is improved via a down-conversion luminescence process caused by the lanthanide ions.35 Ce positively changes the conduction band minimum of TiO2 due to the unoccupied Ce 4f states in the band gap. The electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 was increased and the fill factor of the DSSC was improved by Ce doping.36 Nd, Eu, and Yb doped on to TiO2 enhanced the injection of excited electrons and decreased the recombination rate of the injected electrons, which greatly improved the performance of DSSCs.37–39 Some rare earth ion modifications can passivate the surface states of the ZnO electrode. Modification with Nd, Sm, and Gd ions notably enhanced the open-circuit photovoltage and fill factor of ZnO-based solar cells, whereas modification with La, Ce, Nd, and Sm ions led to a decreased short-circuit photocurrent.40
Considering its unique optical properties, along with its tunable emission wavelength ranging from blue to the infrared region, Pr was selected as a doping element for ZnO. So, Pr and N were chosen for the current study. In this paper, we have reported a new route to improve the conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs. Pr:N:ZnO was prepared by an annealing method under NH3 gas in a custom stainless steel autoclave. The results showed that the conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs can be improved by Pr and N co-doping. A conversion efficiency of 5.2% was achieved using this new route.
Experimental
Preparation of Pr:N:ZnO
All chemicals, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Pr(NO3)3·6H2O, ammonia and ethanol were analytical grade and used without further purification. Pr-doped ZnO was prepared using a coprecipitation method. 2.9749 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.1350 g Pr(NO3)3·6H2O were added to 200 mL deionized water and continuously stirred. After the metal nitrate dissolved, ammonia was added dropwise with vigorous stirring. A white precipitate was observed after enough ammonia had been added to adjust the pH value of the solution to 8.0. The resulting precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol, centrifuged, dried and then calcined at 320 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was Pr doped ZnO (middle product). Un-doped ZnO was similarly prepared using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and ammonia. Pr:N:ZnO was prepared using an annealing method under an atmosphere of NH3 gas in a custom stainless steel autoclave. As shown in Fig. 1, the sample was prepared in a stainless steel chamber (part 1). The NH3 gas (99% pure, part 3) flows into the chamber through a device (part 2) that absorbs any impurities in the NH3 gas. The sample was not heated until the pressure reached 1.2 MPa. The annealing temperature was maintained at 550 °C for 72 h.

Characterization
The powder samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a JDX-3530M diffractometer (JEOL, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation. The morphology of the samples was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7000F, JEOL). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a ESCALAB-250 spectrometer (Thermo, America) using an Al-Kα source and working in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 3.5 × 10−7 Pa. Doping concentrations were measured using XPS. UV-visible absorption spectra of the samples were measured at room temperature on a U-3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) with an integrating sphere (model 130-0632). The instrument used to obtain the surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS) measurements was assembled at Jilin University and monochromatic light was obtained by passing light from a 500 W xenon lamp (CHF-XQ500W, Trusttech, China) though a double-prism monochromator (SBP300, Dectech, China). Transient photovoltage (TPV) tests were carried out by excitation with a laser radiation pulse (wavelength of 355 nm and pulse width of 5 ns) from a third harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc., America). TPV signals were registered using a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix, USA).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
LiI, I2, 4-tert-butylpyridine, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, H2PtCl6 and FTO (fluorine-doped SnO2 glass) were purchased from the Aldrich Chemical Company. cis-Bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium, known as N-719, was purchased from Solaronix Company. A colloidal solution was obtained by mixing a sample and ethanol (10 wt%), then stirring for 12 h, before applying the mixture on to a conducting substrate (FTO) using a doctor blade technique. Adhesive tape was used as a frame and spacer. The film electrodes were thus prepared and dried in air, since there was no organic additive to burn. The area of the film was 0.20 cm2. The film electrodes were immersed in a 0.5 mmol L−1 ethanolic solution of complex N-719 for 8 h at room temperature. Next, the sensitized films were dried in air. A thermally platinized conducting glass (5 mmol L−1 H2PtCl6 in dry isopropanol, heated at 400 °C for 10 min) was used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 0.5 mol L−1 LiI, 0.05 mol L−1 I2, and 0.1 mol L−1 4-tert-butylpyridine in a 1:1 (volume ratio) mixture of acetonitrile–propylene carbonate. The J–V curves of the sealed cells were measured under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator. Electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out using an electrochemical work-station (chi660d, Chenhua, China) with a three-electrode system in the dark. The frequency range was 0.05 to 105 Hz, and the applied potential was generally between 0 and 0.700 V. IPCE spectra were obtained with a model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier, a model SR540 optical chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA) with a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp as the light source, and a 7ISW301 spectrometer.
Results and discussion
SEM images (see ESI†) show that the morphology of Pr:N:ZnO is uniform with micro-flowers consisting of micro-sheets connected to each other. XRD measurements were performed to study the structure of Pr:N:ZnO. We used ZnO and the middle product Pr doped ZnO (Pr:ZnO) prepared under the same conditions as a comparison. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that there are six prominent XRD peaks, corresponding to the (100), (102), (101), (102), (110), and (103) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnO, according to JCPDS file No. 80-0075. As shown in Fig. 2, a remarkably strong (101) peak was observed in the three samples, indicating that there is no significant change in the orientation of Pr:ZnO and Pr:N:ZnO. The diffraction peaks confirm that Pr:N:ZnO still possesses a hexagonal wurtzite structure, which means that doping with Pr and N does not change the structure of ZnO. The position of the diffraction peaks do not obviously shift due to the low doping concentration of Pr and N. No peaks corresponding to other impurities, such as Zn3N2, PrN or ablated nitrogen-containing compounds are detected, implying that N and Pr atoms are incorporated into the lattice of bulk ZnO.

XPS measurements were conducted to identify the composition and chemical state of Pr:N:ZnO. Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra for Zn, O, Pr and N in Pr:N:ZnO. The two strong peaks shown in Fig. 3a are centered at 1021.3 and 1044.1 eV, agreeing with the binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively. The spectrum of O 1s, shown in Fig. 3b, has a slightly asymmetrical peak, which can be divided, using Gaussian, into three components: a low binding energy peak located at 530.9 eV, a middle binding energy peak located at 531.2 eV, and a high binding energy peak located at 532.3 eV. The low binding energy peak is attributed to O2− ions at intrinsic sites.41 The middle binding energy peak is associated with O2− ions in oxygen deficient regions.42 The high binding energy peak located at 532.3 eV is usually attributed to the presence of loosely bound oxygen on the surface of ZnO, belonging to a specific species, e.g., –CO3, adsorbed O2 and H2O.43 Fig. 3c shows the XPS spectrum of Pr. The broad peak centered at 976.2 eV reveals that Pr exists in the ZnO lattice. Fig. 3d shows the spectrum of N 1s, with a peak centered at 397.7 eV.44 In addition, it should be noted that the XPS peaks for Pr and N are very weak. This may to be due to the low level of Pr and N doping at the surface of the sample.

UV-visible absorption spectra of ZnO, Pr:N:ZnO, ZnO sensitized with N719, and Pr:N:ZnO sensitized with N719 are illustrated in Fig. 4a. The absorption threshold of ZnO is 400 nm. This can be assigned to the electron transition from O 2p to Zn 3d, corresponding to a transition from the valence band to the conduction band according to the energy band structure of ZnO. An electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band caused by irradiation with ultraviolet (<400 nm) light leads to the problem that almost all of the visible light in the solar spectrum can not be absorbed. The absorption threshold of Pr:N:ZnO is red shifted toward the visible light region (from 400 nm to 900 nm) compared to that of ZnO. This suggests that the band gap of Pr:N:ZnO is narrowed because of the impurity sub-bands of Pr and N. The absorption intensity of Pr:N:ZnO increases in the 400–900 nm range compared to that of ZnO. It indicates that the visible light activity of Pr:N:ZnO is increased compared to ZnO. The optical absorption spectra of ZnO and Pr:N:ZnO with dye sensitization reflect the difference in their light harvesting capabilities. High visible light activity is good for visible light harvesting. The absorption spectrum of Pr:N:ZnO/N719 becomes broadened and exhibits a red shift when compared to that of ZnO/N719. The broadening and red shift of the absorption spectrum of Pr:N:ZnO/N719 are desirable for the light harvesting of solar energy. The IPCE can be expressed in terms of the light-harvesting efficiency, the quantum yield of charge injection from the excited dye to the semiconductor, and the collection efficiency of injected electrons at the back contact. As can be seen from the spectra in Fig. 4b, the maximum IPCE value for the ZnO DSSC is 37% at 525 nm, but the Pr:N:ZnO DSSC has a value of 60% at this wavelength. The IPCE spectrum of the Pr:N:ZnO DSSC exhibits an upward shift in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 700 nm. It shows that the Pr:N:ZnO-based DSSC has a higher light-harvesting efficiency and quantum yield of charge injection compared with that of the ZnO-based DSSC. A good photoanode will facilitate light harvesting and electron injection. Pr:N:ZnO may be a good photoanode candidate for DSSCs because it enhances light harvesting and electron injection.

Fig. 5 shows the SPS responses of ZnO and Pr:N:ZnO. The SPS peak position of ZnO is at about 380 nm, with the response threshold at 400 nm. The SPS response of ZnO can be attributed to electron transitions from the valence band to conduction band (O 2p → Zn 3d). The SPS response of Pr:N:ZnO is much stronger than that of ZnO. This indicates that photoelectrons and holes can be effectively separated in Pr:N:ZnO.45 As shown in the spectra, the response threshold of Pr:N:ZnO is red shifted. The photovoltaic response band of Pr:N:ZnO is broadened compared to ZnO. Impurity sub-bands are introduced into the ZnO by doping with Pr and N. These sub-band gap transitions lead to the broadened SPS response of Pr:N:ZnO. Hence, the optical and electronic performance of Pr:N:ZnO has changed. The SPS spectra are in good agreement with the results of the UV-visible spectra.

Transient surface photovoltage (TPV) measurements were taken to study the mechanisms of the charge injection, spatial charge separation, diffusion and recombination processes. Fig. 6a shows that there are positive TPV responses for ZnO and Pr:N:ZnO. The layer thickness of the materials is much greater than the diffusion distance of the excess electrons. Therefore, the TPV shape does not depend on the layer thickness of the materials, but on how the carriers change over time. A positive TPV response implies that the negative charges transfer towards the bottom of the material, while positive charges accumulate at the surface. The electrons and holes diffuse from the surface to the bottom due to the concentration gradient. The diffusion coefficient of the electrons is larger than that of the holes.46 The TPV response of Pr:N:ZnO is stronger than that of ZnO. The enhanced TPV response of Pr:N:ZnO indicates that the separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes is much more pronounced than in ZnO.46 Charge separation increased progressively from 10−7 s until it reached a saturation value. The TPV reaches an apex at times of 10−7 to 10−6 s for Pr:N:ZnO and 10−6 s for ZnO, which can be ascribed to the charge diffusion in the materials. The diffusion time for Pr:N:ZnO is decreased by an order of magnitude, demonstrating that the charge carriers in this material diffuse faster than in ZnO. This result implies that co-doping ZnO with Pr and N leads to an increase in the rate of charge separation and a shorter diffusion time. Moreover, Fig. 6b shows the normalized TPV spectra of Pr:N:ZnO and ZnO, in which the photovoltages are normalized to the same peak height at time zero. From these spectra, it can be observed that the decay time for the materials is on a millisecond time scale. Fig. 6b shows that the decay time of the Pr and N doped ZnO increases remarkably, meaning that electron recombination is efficiently hindered. The increased decay time favours the diffusion of electrons before they can recombine with holes.47 The electron lifetime in Pr:N:ZnO is increased compared to that in ZnO. In other words, the recombination of electrons and holes in the ZnO has been effectively suppressed and the electron lifetime in ZnO can be prolonged by doping with Pr and N.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been widely used to correlate device structure with suitable models for the study of the kinetics of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes occurring in DSSCs. Fig. 7 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of the Pr:N:ZnO and ZnO based DSSCs in the dark. In Fig. 7, experimental data are represented by symbols, while the solid lines correspond to the fit obtained with Zsimpwin software using the equivalent circuit: Rs(C1(R1O1))(R2Q2).48,49 The spectra show one large semicircle in the medium frequency region and a short straight line in the high frequency region.50,51 The large semicircle in medium frequency and a short straight line at high frequency means fast electron transport and long collection in the film.50 The large semicircle tends to expand and the diameter of the semicircle increases after doping with Pr and N. The equivalent circuit is a useful tool for understanding the output performance of solar cells and for further comprehending the electrical behavior of DSSCs. In the equivalent circuit, the symbols R and C represent the resistance and capacitance, respectively; O, which depends on the parameters Yo,1 and B, accounts for the finite-length Warburg diffusion (ZDif), and the symbol Q represents the constant phase element, CPE (the parameters of which are Yo,2 and n).48 Yo,1 and Yo,2 are the Warburg coefficients at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface and the Pt/electrolyte interface, respectively, corresponding to module 1 and 2 in the equivalent circuit. RDif = B/Yo,1, where B is a parameter. Table 1 lists the parameters obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of the composite solar cells using the equivalent circuit. The series resistance of the system (Rs), can account for the resistance of the polymer electrolyte, the resistance within the photoelectrode film and the FTO electrode, as well as the contacts. A short straight line observed at high frequency is associated with the capacitance and resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface (CPE and R2 elements).48 For the elements related to the Pt/electrolyte interface, R2 decreases from 52.08 to 21.94 Ω cm2 after Pr and N co-doping. The decrease in R2 means that there is much more I3− at the Pt electrode surface to take part in the redox reaction and, hence, increases the FF of the DSSC.48 The large semicircle at medium frequency can be attributed to the electron transfer process at the ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface (capacitance, C1; charge transfer resistance, R1).48,51 C1 increases from 9.79 × 10−5 to 72.45 × 10−5 F cm−2 and R1 increases from 29.08 to 97.21 Ω cm2 after Pr and N co-doping. The increased film capacitance means that there are more electrons at the Pr:N:ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface as the light absorption is greater for the doped DSSC. The increased value of R1 means that the recombination resistance is high at the Pr:N:ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface. The high recombination resistance indicates that the recombination of electrons at the Pr:N:ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface is restrained. This means that the loss of the electrons at the Pr:N:ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface is decreased. This is favorable for electron injection. The diffusion resistance (RDif) was calculated using the above formula. The diffusion resistance of the electrons at the Pr:N:ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface (1.35 Ω) is higher than that of the ZnO/dye/electrolyte interface (0.19 Ω) in the dark. This indicates that the dark current of the Pr:N:ZnO DSSC is lower than that of the ZnO DSSC. The high film capacitance and the recombination resistance are favorable for improving of the performance of DSSCs.52 Meanwhile, the characteristic recombination peak of the DSSC based on the Pr:N:ZnO photoanode shifts to a lower frequency (from 17.8 to 8.3 Hz). This indicates that the electron lifetime is longer in the Pr and N co-doped DSSC.53 The high film capacitance and recombination resistance, combined with the low recombination frequency result in the highest possible η.

Fig. 8 shows the current density versus voltage curves of the DSSCs based on films of ZnO and Pr:N:ZnO under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The ZnO-based DSSC shows a lower photovoltaic performance, e.g., the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc: 7.18 mA cm−2), open circuit voltage (Voc: 0.58 V), fill factor (FF: 0.58), and the overall energy conversion efficiency (η: 2.2%) are lower. In contrast to ZnO, the Pr:N:ZnO-based DSSC shows obvious improvements in all performance parameters (Jsc: 13.84 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.59 V, FF: 0.63, η: 5.2%). The overall solar conversion efficiency (η) is defined as:  where Pin is the total solar power incident on the cell, which is 100 mW cm−2 for AM 1.5. Therefore, the power efficiency can be improved by increasing Jsc, Voc, and/or FF. The Jsc increases by a tremendous 92% from 7.18 to 13.84 mA cm−2 after Pr and N doping. Doping with Pr and N improves the absorption of light, which results in better light harvesting and increased electron injection. This point has been proven using the UV-vis and IPCE spectra. EIS shows that the transfer resistance in Pr:N:ZnO/dye/electrolyte and the recombination frequency both decrease. A high recombination resistance and recombination frequency are favorable for the electron injection. This also proves that Pr and N doping can improve the performance of DSSCs. The enhanced photocurrent is associated with an increase of electrons in the conduction band, while the increased photovoltage (Voc) can be ascribed to an upward shift in the conduction band edge.52 Voc is the difference in the potential between the photoelectrode conduction band edge and the electrochemical potential of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Doping creates sub-band gap electron states, which may cause the edge of the conduction band to be positively shifted.54 Hence, when the edge of the conduction band shifts to a more negative value, Voc increases by 0.1 V. FF increases from 0.58 to 0.63. The improvement in FF is attributed to the activation of, or better contact between, the electrolyte and Pt catalyst. The overall energy conversion efficiency of the Pr:N:ZnO based DSSC is improved by the parameters mentioned above, where the increase in Jsc is biggest for these parameters. An increasing Jsc value is the major factor improving the overall solar conversion efficiency of the DSSCs. In other words, Pr and N co-doping can improve the overall solar conversion efficiency of DSSCs by improving the absorption of the light and, therefore, light harvesting can be increased.

The effect of different doping concentrations of Pr on the performance of a DSSC is shown in the Table 2. The annealing temperature, annealing time and NH3 gas pressure remain unchanged. As the doping concentration of Pr increases from 0.5 mol% to 4 mol%, the photovoltage increases with the doping concentration. This indicates that the upward shift of the conduction band edge of ZnO is increasing with the increasing Pr doping concentration. With the increase in the doping concentration of Pr, Jsc first increases and then decreases. Pr doping leads to an upward shift of the conduction band edge, thus, the injection of the electrons from the dye to the conduction band of ZnO is affected by the doping concentration. Hence, an appropriate doping concentration of both Pr and N can improve the absorption of light, light harvesting and the electron injection.

Conclusions
We prepared Pr:N:ZnO using an annealing method under an atmosphere of NH3 gas in a custom stainless steel autoclave. TPV measurements showed that Pr and N co-doping can increase the separation rate of the photoinduced electrons and holes in ZnO. Compared with ZnO, the UV-visible absorption band of Pr:N:ZnO is red-shifted and the absorption intensity is increased. The performance of the Pr:N:ZnO-based DSSC is dramatically improved compared to the ZnO-based DSSC. The UV-vis and IPCE spectra showed that the increased visible light absorption caused by doping with Pr and N, led to an enhancement of the light harvesting properties of the DSSC. This result implies that Pr and N co-doping is an effective way to improve the conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs.
