    , Accepted 18th June 2013First published on 18th June 2013AbstractThe behavior of WO3 photoanodes has been investigated in contact with a combination of four anions (Cl−, CH3SO3−, HSO4−, and ClO4−) and three solvents (water, acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate), to elucidate the role of the semiconductor surface, the electrolyte, and redox kinetics on the current density vs. potential properties of n-type WO3. In 1.0 M aqueous strong acids, although the flat-band potential (Efb) of WO3 was dominated by electrochemical intercalation of protons into WO3, the nature of the electrolyte influenced the onset potential (Eon) of the anodic photocurrent. In aprotic solvents, the electrolyte anion shifted both Efb and Eon, but did not significantly alter the overall profile of the voltammetric data. For 0.50 M tetra(n-butyl)ammonium perchlorate in propylene carbonate, the internal quantum yield exceeded unity at excitation wavelengths of 300–390 nm, indicative of current doubling. A regenerative photoelectrochemical cell based on the reversible redox couple B10Br10˙−/2− in acetonitrile, with a solution potential of ∼1.7 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode, exhibited an open-circuit photovoltage of 1.32 V under 100 mW cm−2 of simulated Air Mass 1.5 global illumination.

Broader context
Electrolytes are an indispensable constituent in (photo)electrochemistry for forming interfacial double layers and conducting currents. Nonetheless, it is generally considered that the role of electrolytes in (photo)electrochemistry is merely supporting and implicit, because the identity and concentration of electrolytes do not directly determine the electrode potentials and current densities. Results from this work suggest that when in contact with various aqueous and nonaqueous solutions and under simulated solar illumination, thin-film WO3 photoanodes oxidized primarily the electrolyte anions in spite of the dominant molarity of the solvent in the electrolyte solutions. The priority of anion oxidation has been utilized to construct nonaqueous, regenerative photoelectrochemical cells that produce large open-circuit voltages. In addition to O2(g) evolution from water, such electrolyte effects can result in undesired side reactions, and such processes should be taken into account when WO3 photoanodes are incorporated into multi-component devices for solar-driven water splitting.

I Introduction
WO3 is an interesting photoanode material for use in early-generation tandem-type light absorber systems for solar-driven water splitting. In contact with aqueous solutions, photogenerated holes in the valence band of WO3, at an electrochemical potential of ∼3.0 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), are sufficiently oxidizing to produce free or surface-attached hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) that can eventually lead to O2(g). This widely accepted reaction scheme has inspired increasing interest1–10 in WO3 photoanodes, both pristine and decorated with oxygen-evolving catalysts.
Several studies11–14 of the photoelectrochemical behavior of WO3 in aqueous electrolytes have recently suggested that an alternative process, in which oxidation of electrolyte anions, such as Cl−, HSO4−, and ClO4−, effectively competes with oxidation of water at the WO3/electrolyte interface, dominates the photoanodic behavior of n-type WO3 especially under acidic conditions. Although some of the oxidation products (Cl2 and S2O82−) have been confirmed experimentally,11–13 the importance of the oxidation of water to produce OH˙ as an energetic intermediate, relative to the oxidation of electrolyte anions, has yet to be fully elucidated.14 In aqueous media, the overwhelming molarity of water (>50 M) that hydrates and protonates the WO3 surface makes disentangling these effects difficult. In contrast, valuable information can in principle be obtained by photoelectrochemical investigations of the same series of anions in nonaqueous electrolytes. Compared with main-group semiconductors such as Si15 and GaP,16 the photoelectrochemistry of metal oxides in nonaqueous solvents is not well elaborated. Early work regarding n-type TiO217 and ZnO18 electrodes in acetonitrile solutions placed emphasis on the behavior of the conduction-band electrons in these semiconductors.
Nonaqueous electrolytes can also overcome the restriction on the available operational electrochemical potential window that is associated with operation in aqueous media. The flat-band potential (Efb) of n-type WO3, at ∼0.4 V vs. NHE,19,20 is too positive to effect the reduction of protons with no external bias applied to the system. Given the standard electrode potential for water oxidation, E0 = 1.23 V vs. NHE, WO3 photoanodes can therefore in theory generate an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of at most ∼0.8 V for water oxidation. Hence, much of the band gap energy of WO3 (Eg = 2.6 eV)21 is not used electrochemically, and a substantial bias voltage from the photocathode is required to achieve overall water splitting. In nonaqueous electrolytes, existing knowledge about Si photoelectrodes22,23 predicts that both the Efb of WO3 and the Nernstian potential of the solution are tunable beyond these limits. To maximize the Voc of regenerative photoelectrochemical cells, a nonaqueous redox system with a very positive Nernstian potential (e.g., >1.5 V vs. NHE) therefore needs to be identified.
We describe herein the nonaqueous photoelectrochemistry of WO3, and report the voltammetric, spectral response, and electrochemical impedance data obtained by using a combination of four anions (Cl−, CH3SO3−, HSO4−, and ClO4−) and three solvents (water, acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate). Furthermore, a regenerative photoelectrochemical cell has been constructed by use of a reversible redox couple, B10Br10˙−/2−, that has a very positive formal reduction potential. The resulting WO3-based solid/liquid contact produced an open-circuit photovoltage of 1.32 V. Thus, the use of aprotic solvents and reversible redox couples aids in disentangling the contributions from the semiconductor surface, the electrolyte, and redox kinetics to the photoanodic behavior of WO3, and also opens a new venue for understanding other semiconducting metal oxides as photoanode materials.
II Experimental
Chemicals
Sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O, Aldrich 223336, 99%), tungsten foil (Alfa Aesar 10417, 99.95%), 1.0 M hydrochloric acid (J. T. Baker 5620), acetonitrile (ACN, J. T. Baker 9035-10, ultra low water), propylene carbonate (PC, Aldrich 310328, anhydrous, 99.7%), tetra(n-butyl)ammonium chloride (TBACl, TCI America T0055, >98%), tetra(n-butyl)ammonium bisulfate (TBAHSO4, Aldrich 86868, ≥99%), and tetra(n-butyl)ammonium perchlorate (TBAClO4, Fluka 86893, ≥99%) were used as received. Concentrated sulfuric acid (J. T. Baker 9681, 98%), methanesulfonic acid (Aldrich 471356, ≥99.5%), and perchloric acid (Fisher A2286, 60%) were diluted to 1.0 M using deionized water (18 MΩ cm resistivity) obtained from a Barnstead Nanopure system. All other chemicals were ACS reagents or were greater than 98% purity.
Tetra(n-butyl)ammonium methanesulfonate (TBASO3CH3, Fluka 86877, ≥97%) was recrystallized from toluene. Bis(methanesulfonyl) peroxide [(CH3SO3)2] was synthesized24 electrochemically as a white solid from a neat solution of sodium methanesulfonate in methanesulfonic acid. Bis[tetra(n-butyl)ammonium] decabromo-closo-decaborate(2−) (TBA2B10Br10) was prepared in two steps25,26 using decaborane (Alfa Aesar 87892, 98%), bromine, and tetra(n-butyl)ammonium bromide, and was subsequently recrystallized from acetone/ethanol as colorless needles. TBA2B10Br10 is not hygroscopic and is readily soluble in aprotic organic solvents.
Electrochemistry
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode configuration, in which a Pt-mesh counter electrode was isolated from the electrolyte by a medium glass frit, and the reference electrode was isolated from the electrolyte by a Luggin capillary. Voltammetric data were collected at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a BAS 100B electrochemical analyzer. The reference electrode for measurements in aqueous electrolytes was a Ag/AgCl/3.0 M NaCl electrode (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.), which was taken to have a potential of E = 0.209 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Nonaqueous reference electrodes were assembled from a AgCl-coated Ag wire, a filling solution, and a glass tube that had a Vycor frit at its tip.27 The filling solution was saturated tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) in ACN, or saturated LiCl in PC.28 The formal potential of the ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple (E0′(Fc+/0)) vs. a nonaqueous reference electrode was measured by performing cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry on a polished Pt-disc working electrode in 0.1 M TBAClO4 in the corresponding solvent. Comparison with the known values29 of E0′(Fc+/0) vs. NHE in each solvent gave the potentials of these nonaqueous reference electrodes: E(Ag/AgCl/sat. TMACl, ACN) = 0.06 V vs. NHE, and E(Ag/AgCl/sat. LiCl, PC) = 0.07 V vs. NHE. All potentials measured in H2O, ACN, or PC relative to the respective reference electrode were converted to values vs. NHE and the resulting potentials are reported herein.
WO3 photoanodes
To form working electrodes, samples of SnO2:F-coated glass slides (FTO, Hartford Glass, TEC 15) and W foil were cut into pieces that were 1.0 cm in width. After immersing the slides for 30 min in a modified piranha solution (1.0 g (NH4)2S2O8 in 20 mL concentrated H2SO4), the substrates were rinsed with H2O and then with ethanol, to create a clean, hydrophilic surface that adhered well to the WO3 overlayer. A column (Sigma C4169, ∅1.5 cm × 10 cm) packed with strongly acidic ion-exchange resin (Fisher Rexyn 101 (H), 1.9 mEq. mL−1) was washed with deionized water until the pH value of the washings was ∼4. The column was then loaded with 0.566 mL (0.5 mmol) of 3% H2O2 and a solution of 0.330 g (1.00 mmol) Na2WO4·2H2O in 1.50 mL water, and was subsequently eluted with 20 mL of deionized water. The eluate was a clear, pale yellow solution of peroxytungstic acid, and was immediately consumed in the next step. Peroxide test strips (EM Quant 10081-1) indicated that the free H2O2 concentration was 10–30 ppm in this solution.
A cleaned electrode substrate (FTO glass or W foil) was electrically connected to a Cu clamp, and was immersed in the peroxytungstic acid to a depth of 1.0 cm. The cathodic electrodeposition of WO3 was performed, without stirring, at −0.29 V vs. NHE, with the passage of −0.25 C cm−2 of charge density (at a current density of ∼−0.4 mA cm−2) yielding a blue layer of reduced WO3·xH2O on the working electrode surface, as well as O2 bubbles at the Pt counter electrode. The working electrode was removed from the bath, rinsed with water, dried in air, and baked at 225 °C until the blue color had faded completely, typically requiring ∼10 min of baking time. The deposition–dehydration cycle was then repeated. After 5–6 cycles, the electrode was annealed at 500 °C in air for 1 h, yielding a pale yellow film of WO3. The mass and thickness of the electrodeposited WO3 film were determined using a Sartorius CPA225D semi-micro balance and a Dektak XT profilometer, respectively. Unsealed with epoxy, WO3/FTO electrodes were heated at 225 °C for 10 min before each new experiment. The WO3/W electrode was electrically connected to a Cu wire, and was sealed with epoxy resin (Loctite Hysol 9460) completely on one side and partially on the other side to expose ∼1.0 cm2 of WO3 but no bare W.
Photoelectrochemistry
Voltammetric current density vs. potential (J–E) data (50 mV s−1) were collected using a BAS 100B electrochemical analyzer and a solar simulator, in conjunction with a photoelectrochemical cell that has been described previously.12 Illumination was provided by an Oriel solar simulator equipped with an Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) filter. The light intensity was adjusted at the sample plane to provide the same open-circuit voltage on a secondary standard (a Solarex Si photodiode) as that produced by illumination of the photodiode with 100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5G illumination. The electrolyte produced a 1.2 cm optical path length between the optical window and the working electrode. A miniature cell was fabricated similarly from a 10 mL round bottom flask, whose single neck provided access for all of the electrodes. The error in the values of the photocurrent density (J) was estimated to be ±10%.
Spectral response measurements were performed using ultraviolet and visible light produced by a 150 W Xe arc lamp. The light was chopped at 1.0 Hz, and was passed through a monochromator that had slits 0.5 mm in width. Either the photoelectrochemical cell or a calibrated Si photodiode (OSI Optoelectronics, UV-50) was positioned in the light path, and the illuminated spot was focused to ∼1 × 1 mm2 at the front surface of the working electrode. At a fixed potential, the wavelength of the incident light was varied in 10 nm steps, and the resulting photocurrents were measured with lock-in detection using a Gamry Series G 300 potentiostat. The external quantum yield (Φext) of the photoelectrochemical cell was calculated based on the known Φext values of the calibrated Si diode. To compensate for fluctuations in the intensity of the monochromatic illumination, a small fraction of the light beam was split using a quartz plate and was continuously monitored by another Si photodiode.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS was performed in the absence of illumination on a PARSTAT 2273 potentiostat/frequency response analyzer using the PowerSUITE software. To allow for equilibration between the WO3 film and the nonaqueous electrolytes, prior to each impedance measurement five voltammetric cycles were run under illumination over the same potential range as used for collecting the impedance data. For each modulation frequency between 20 mHz and 2.0 MHz (four frequency values per decade), the reactance of a WO3/FTO electrode was measured over a potential range of 1.6 V in the aqueous electrolytes and of 2.3 V in the nonaqueous electrolytes, in parallel with the potential ranges of the corresponding voltammetric scans. The EIS dataset thus obtained was fitted using MATLAB to produce Mott–Schottky plots and additionally to extract Efb values from the resulting data.
Spectrophotometry and microscopy
The absorption spectra of electrolytes were measured in a 1 cm quartz cuvette using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The diffuse reflectance spectrum of the WO3/FTO photoanode was taken on a Cary 5000 UV-visible spectrophotometer by placing the photoanode in the center of an integrating sphere. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed on a Zeiss model 1550VP.
III Results
WO3/FTO and WO3/W photoanodes
WO3 films on FTO-coated glass or W foil were fabricated by cathodic electrodeposition from peroxytungstic acid and subsequent annealing in air. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows that these two types of WO3 films possessed similar surface morphology with crystallites ∼50 nm in size and crevices between the crystallites. The porosity of the WO3 films that were electrodeposited on FTO-coated glass was calculated to be 22%, based on the measured dimension (1.6 ± 0.1 μm × 1.0 cm2) and mass (0.90 ± 0.02 mg) of the WO3 films, in addition to the density (7.2 g cm−3) of crystalline WO3.13 During annealing, the surface of the W foil developed a thin oxide layer so the mass of the electrodeposited WO3 on W could not be directly determined by the mass gain of the W substrate. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the cyclic voltammetric data acquired from these electrodes in 1.0 M HCl(aq) under room light, referred to as “dark”. For the WO3/FTO electrode, the anodic current showed an onset at E = ∼1.6 V vs. NHE. The current density was largely uniform across the film area, as probed using a pipette that was filled with 1.0 M HCl(aq) and that contacted ∼0.01 cm2 of the WO3 surface. For the WO3/W electrode, the anodic current originated only from the edges of the W foil. After sealing the back and edges of the electrode with epoxy resin, no significant faradaic current was observed in the dark at E = 0.6–2.2 V vs. NHE.
Photoelectrochemical oxidation of anions
Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed on a WO3/FTO electrode in one of three different solvents (water, ACN, and PC) that each contained one of four anions (Cl−, CH3SO3−, HSO4−, and ClO4−). Fig. 1 displays the J–E characteristics of a WO3/FTO electrode in contact with these electrolytes, with the aqueous electrolytes containing 1.0 M acid and the nonaqueous ACN or PC electrolytes containing 0.50 M of the appropriate tetra(n-butyl)ammonium salt. The dark current densities were <0.05 mA cm−2 at E = 0.6–1.9 V vs. NHE. In contact with the aqueous acids, capacitive current densities were observed in the dark for E < 0.6 V vs. NHE. The WO3 film turned blue at E < 0.2 V vs. NHE, and fragmented and delaminated at more negative potentials. In ACN or PC, no color change of WO3 was observed at E = −0.1 V vs. NHE.
 Fig. 1  Voltammograms of a WO3/FTO photoanode in (A) water, (B) ACN, and (C) PC that contained Cl− (green), CH3SO3− (red), HSO4− (blue), or ClO4− (magenta), under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2). The electrolytes were 1.0 M acids in water and 0.50 M tetra(n-butyl)ammonium salts in ACN or PC. All panels also depict the results from control experiments with HSO4− in the dark (black). 
The onset potential of the photocurrent (Eon) was a function of the electrolyte anion, following the order Eon(Cl−) < Eon(CH3SO3−) < Eon(HSO4−) < Eon(ClO4−). The photocurrent densities rose steadily for E > Eon, and in water and ACN eventually reached a plateau value (Jph) that was insensitive to the electrolyte. In PC, however, the Jph value increased from 1.5 mA cm−2 for the TBACl electrolyte to 2.3 mA cm−2 for TBAClO4, and exhibited intermediate values for the other electrolytes. When passing a photocurrent density of Jph, the WO3 surfaces exhibited no observable gas bubbles or color change. At the Pt counter electrode, a gas, presumably H2 from the following cathode reactions, was evolved from electrolytes containing TBAHSO4 or PC:HSO4− + e−(Pt) → SO42− + ½H2↑(CH3CH2CH2CH2)4N+ + e−(Pt) → (CH3CH2CH2CH2)3N + CH3CH2CHCH2 + ½H2↑ (ref. 30)For TBACl, TBASO3CH3, or TBAClO4 in ACN, the electrolyte in the cathode chamber turned yellow, which could be due to a reductive condensation reaction involving acetonitrile. The J–E behavior of the WO3/W photoanode resembled that of the WO3/FTO photoanode, but the former produced ∼10% less photocurrent density than the latter under the same conditions.
Spectral response
The external quantum yield (Φext) of the WO3/FTO photoanode was measured at fixed electrode potentials in the plateau region of the J–E data shown in Fig. 1. For example, Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the results obtained at 1.7 V vs. NHE for 1.0 M HClO4 in water, and at 2.4 V vs. NHE for 0.50 M TBAClO4 in ACN or PC. The diffuse reflectance data for the WO3/FTO photoanode (Relectrode) and the transmittance of the electrolyte between the light source and the WO3 (Telectrolyte), both presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†), were used to convert the Φext values to internal quantum yields (Φint): Φint = Φext/Telectrolyte/(1 − Relectrode)(1)For the electrolytes in water or ACN, the values of Telectrolyte were essentially unity at wavelengths ≥300 nm. Fig. 2 shows a plot of Φintvs. wavelength for the WO3/FTO photoanode in contact with electrolytes that contained ClO4−. The spectral response displayed similar profiles for all three solvents, with Φint maximizing at 350–360 nm and approaching zero at ≥480 nm, the latter coincident with the optical band gap of WO3 at 2.6 eV.21 However, the solvent had an impact on the magnitude of Φint, which at 300–390 nm exceeded unity in PC, but was only ∼0.5 in water. Table 1 summarizes the maxima of Φint for WO3 in all solvent–electrolyte combinations investigated in this work.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows representative Bode plots of the EIS data for a polycrystalline WO3/FTO photoanode in contact with various electrolyte–solvent combinations. In the frequency range of ∼1 to 50 Hz, the measured impedance data were in the capacitive regime, and the differential capacitance (C) was extracted at each potential (E) of the WO3/FTO photoanode. Fig. 3 presents Mott–Schottky plots of C−2vs. E, and Tables S1 and S2† list the values of Efb and of the dopant density (ND), respectively, obtained by the linear fits depicted in Fig. 3. In 1.0 M aqueous strong acids, these plots (Fig. 3A) displayed little dependence on the electrolyte anion at frequencies from 0.3 Hz to at least 0.3 kHz. In contrast, the Mott–Schottky plots for WO3 in ACN (Fig. 3B) or in PC (Fig. 3C) were strongly affected by the electrolyte anion. The relative order of the Efb values with different electrolytes, from more negative to more positive, was Efb(Cl−) ≈ Efb(CH3SO3−) < Efb(HSO4−) < Efb(ClO4−) in ACN and similarly was Efb(Cl−) < Efb(CH3SO3−) < Efb(HSO4−) < Efb(ClO4−) in PC. These relationships were conserved for results obtained over a three decade range of frequencies, and were reproduced by two independent sets of measurements.

Other conditions were identical to those in Fig. 1. Values of flat-band potential (Efb) were estimated by linear extrapolation (solid lines) of the experimental data (open circles). 
Regenerative photoelectrochemistry
The B10Br10˙−/2− redox couple was produced by mixing decabromo-closo-decaborate (B10Br102−) and bis(methanesulfonyl) peroxide [(CH3SO3)2] in dry, air-saturated ACN. Fig. 4 shows the UV-visible absorption spectrum of B10Br10˙−, whose black-brown color31 appeared within minutes of the reaction, and subsequently persisted for several weeks. In contact with the B10Br10˙−/2− redox couple in ACN, the WO3/FTO photoanode generated negligible photocurrent density. No damage to the WO3 film was observable, and the J–E behavior of the WO3/FTO photoanode fully recovered when the photoanode was rinsed with acetone and tested in an electrolyte that did not contain any deliberately added B10Br10˙−/2−. In contrast, Fig. 5 shows the photoelectrochemical performance of the WO3/W photoanode in contact with 1 mM B10Br10˙−/2− and 0.50 M TBASO3CH3 in ACN, whose solution potential was determined by a Pt wire to be 1.68 V vs. NHE. In the dark, the WO3/W photoanode produced very small (<0.05 mA cm−2) anodic current densities, but exhibited significant cathodic current densities at potentials <∼0.4 V vs. NHE. Under 100 mW cm−2 of simulated AM 1.5G illumination, the cell produced a short-circuit photocurrent density, Jsc = 1.06 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage, Voc = 1.32 V, a fill factor of 0.50, and a photoelectrode energy-conversion efficiency of η = 0.71% (which included losses due to light extinction by B10Br10˙− and to solution resistances).

IV Discussion
Porous WO3 photoanodes
WO3 photoanodes have been fabricated by electrodeposition from peroxytungstic acid, and have been characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy.12,13,32 In previous preparations of peroxytungstic acid, W metal was reacted with concentrated H2O2(aq) and then the excess H2O2 was decomposed. However, in the peroxytungstic acid thus obtained, the concentration of the residual free H2O2, which has been found12 to be critical for the electrodeposition, is difficult to reproduce precisely. In this work, peroxytungstic acid was prepared within minutes by proton exchange of Na2WO4(aq) in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of H2O2, and the peroxytungstic acid was consumed promptly in the subsequent electrodeposition. This procedure provided excellent reproducibility in the resulting peroxytungstic acid, as well as in the photoelectrochemical performance of the WO3 photoanodes.
The (photo)electrochemical experiments described herein suggest that the WO3 films, prepared by electrodeposition and annealing, were porous across the entire film thickness. For the WO3/FTO photoanode, the electrolyte percolated into the WO3 film and contacted the conducting FTO substrate. Thus the WO3/FTO photoanode oxidized 1.0 M HCl(aq) in the dark at E ∼ 1.6 V vs. NHE, a potential in the band gap region of WO3. Nevertheless, the WO3/FTO photoanode produced substantial photocurrent densities in contact with 1.0 M HCl(aq), because the Cl−/Cl2 redox couple could not be rapidly regenerated by electrons in the FTO substrate. In contrast, when contacted with the electrochemically reversible B10Br10˙−/2− redox couple, the WO3/FTO photoanode produced a nearly complete loss of photocurrent, which can be explained by severe current shunting at the FTO/electrolyte interface. The minimal current shunting observed for the same electrolyte and redox couple conditions for the WO3/W electrode is consistent with expectations for the presence of a compact oxide layer on the W surfaces that prevented direct contact between the W and the Cl− or B10Br10˙− in the electrolyte.
Proton intercalation of WO3 in aqueous acids
The capacitive dark currents (Fig. S2†) and electrochromism of the WO3 photoanodes in aqueous acids are consistent with the electrochemical intercalation of protons into WO3 as per eqn (2): WO3 + xH+(aq) + xe− ↔ HxWO3 ≡ xH+(in WO3) + xe−(in WO3)(2)This reaction has a standard electrode potential of 0.29 V vs. NHE for x = 1.33 The formation of HxWO3 is consistent with the blue color observed for the cathodically charged WO3 films, and for the internal stress that accumulated within the WO3 film at large negative potentials.

Eqn (2) also provides a consistent explanation for the differential capacitance data in Fig. 3A and other data reported previously,34 which indicate that the Efb value for WO3 in contact with a variety of 1.0 M aqueous strong acids was nearly independent of the electrolyte. At E ≤ 0.4 V vs. NHE, HxWO3 with x calculated to be >0.1 is degenerately doped and thus not photoactive. For E = 0.4–1.2 V vs. NHE, the J–E data in Fig. 1A exhibited values of Eon that were a function of the anion. In aqueous strong acids, WO3 photoanodes have been shown to preferentially oxidize the acid anions relative to the oxidation of water.11–13 The anion-dependent Eon values have therefore been suggested to reflect a competition between the different rates of charge recombination and of interfacial electron transfer in each system.35 In this framework, Cl−(aq) would have the highest ratio of charge transfer relative to recombination, and therefore produces significant photocurrent densities at the most negative Eon value of all of the anions studied herein.
WO3/electrolyte interfaces in aprotic solvents
In ACN or PC, electrochromism of the WO3 film was not observed. The J–E data of Fig. 1B and C indicate that in these solvents, the differences between the onset and inflection potentials were almost constant, with a value of ∼0.7 V. Photoelectrochemical oxidation of the electrolyte anions presumably involves radical intermediates (Cl˙, CH3SO3˙, HSO4˙, and ClO4˙) that are adsorbed to the WO3 surface via a labile O–Cl or O–O bond, prior to the formation of more stable oxidation products such as Cl2(g), (CH3SO3)2, and S2O82− (the final oxidation product of ClO4− was unidentified). The surface potential of the WO3 photoanode can therefore be significantly influenced in aprotic solvents by the adsorbed radical species, in which interfacial electric dipoles with partial positive charges on the electrolyte side and partial negative charges on the WO3 side can offset a portion of the applied anodic potential. This mechanistic picture is strongly supported by the systematic shift in Efb for WO3 in contact with the various electrolytes (Fig. 3B and C), and also agrees with current knowledge of the surface modification of Si photoelectrodes.23
The presence of surface-attached radicals is also consistent with the values of Jph and Φint observed for WO3 photoanodes in contact with 0.50 M TBAClO4 in PC. Φint values exceeding unity indicate that more than one conduction-band electron was generated by an absorbed photon. Current doubling takes place when an electrode reaction involves reactive intermediates, usually free radicals, that inject majority carriers (i.e., electrons for an n-type photoanode and holes for a p-type photocathode) into the electrode, in addition to photogenerated carriers.4,36 One explanation of the data is that the radical intermediate ClO4˙ was not reducing enough to cause current doubling in water and ACN, but could oxidize an adjacent PC molecule to a PC radical: (3)A similar reaction between PC and the hydroxyl radical is known,37 and the standard reduction potential of OH˙ (2.85 V)38 is close to that of ClO4˙ (2.75 V vs. NHE);39 many other organic oxygenates have also been shown4,40 to be responsible for current doubling. The newly formed PC radical would then be able to inject an electron to the conduction band of WO3 before diffusing away from the electrode surface, leading to Φint > 1. The values of Φint shown in Table 1 for other electrolytes (0.50 M Cl−, CH3SO3−, or HSO4− in PC) are well below unity, which is consistent with the expectation that their radical forms (Cl˙, CH3SO3˙, or HSO4˙) are more subject to dimerization than to reaction with PC, thereby terminating current doubling. These results clearly demonstrate that at the WO3/electrolyte interface, discharging of the electrode anion is the predominant process, whereas oxidation of the solvent is only a secondary reaction.
Regeneration of photoanodic products
In aqueous acids, Eon is limited by proton intercalation in WO3, and the photoanodic product is ultimately O2(g). Compared with water, ACN possesses a much wider potential window, and allows for more negative values of Eon for WO3 in contact with Cl−, CH3SO3−, or HSO4− (Fig. 1A and B). The photoanodic products of the latter two anions are powerful oxidants: E0(HSO4−/S2O82−) = 2.12 V vs. NHE,38 whereas the value of E0(CH3SO3−/(CH3SO3)2) has so far been unreported but is predicted to be <2.12 V. However, these two-electron redox couples are not reduced at a reasonable overpotential on Pt surfaces. For example, the cathodic reduction of S2O82−(aq) is reported41 to occur at ∼0.6 V vs. NHE, a potential much more negative than E0(HSO4−/S2O82−).
In this work, (CH3SO3)2 was activated by decabromo-closo-decaborate (B10Br102−), a spheroid-shaped anion that is depicted in the inset of Fig. 4: (CH3SO3)2 + 2B10Br102− → 2CH3SO3− + 2B10Br10˙−(4)B10Br102− exhibits high chemical stability26 and a reversible, one-electron redox system with a formal oxidation potential of 1.78 V vs. NHE.31 The Nernst potential of the solution as probed by a Pt wire was observed to be 1.68 V vs. NHE, therefore providing an opportunity to produce large barrier heights, and correspondingly large open-circuit voltages from regenerative photoelectrochemical cells that use this redox system in contact with WO3 photoanodes.
When 1 mM B10Br10˙−/2− was introduced to 0.50 M TBASO3CH3 in ACN, the WO3/W photoanode exhibited Eoc = 0.36 V vs. NHE, corresponding to an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.32 V. This value is by far in excess of the nominal Voc that WO3 can generate in aqueous electrolytes (≤0.8 V). Thus, the B10Br10˙−/2− redox system provided an approach to convert the chemical energy that was stored in (CH3SO3)2 into a solution potential that could readily generate electrical power, at the expense of a loss in potential of 0.2–0.3 V. A drawback to the use of this redox couple is that the oxidized species, B10Br10˙−, absorbed a portion of the incoming light, and contributed to a reduction of Jph from ∼1.4 mA cm−2 in Fig. 1B to 1.06 mA cm−2 (in Fig. 5). Such optical losses can be minimized in cell configurations that utilize a thin layer of electrolyte,42 and/or deeply integrated electrolyte/electrode microstructures.43
V Conclusions
In contact with 1.0 M aqueous strong acids, at E = 0.4–1.2 V vs. NHE, charge recombination competed with anion oxidation at the WO3/electrolyte interfaces, leading to an anion-dependent onset of photoanodic current, although the flat-band potential stayed nearly constant. In aprotic solvents, both the flat-band potential and the onset potential of the photoanodic current shifted as the anion was changed, but the overall profile of the J–E data remained relatively constant. WO3 photoanodes in contact with 0.50 M TBAClO4 in PC exhibited Φint values greater than unity at 300–390 nm, owing to current doubling. When WO3 was used as a photoanode in a regenerative photoelectrochemical cell configuration, the reversible, high-potential redox system 1 mM B10Br10˙−/2− with 0.50 M TBASO3CH3 in ACN produced a solution potential of ∼1.7 V vs. NHE, and an open-circuit voltage of 1.32 V under 100 mW cm−2 of simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

Broader context
Electrolytes are an indispensable constituent in (photo)electrochemistry for forming interfacial double layers and conducting currents. Nonetheless, it is generally considered that the role of electrolytes in (photo)electrochemistry is merely supporting and implicit, because the identity and concentration of electrolytes do not directly determine the electrode potentials and current densities. Results from this work suggest that when in contact with various aqueous and nonaqueous solutions and under simulated solar illumination, thin-film WO3 photoanodes oxidized primarily the electrolyte anions in spite of the dominant molarity of the solvent in the electrolyte solutions. The priority of anion oxidation has been utilized to construct nonaqueous, regenerative photoelectrochemical cells that produce large open-circuit voltages. In addition to O2(g) evolution from water, such electrolyte effects can result in undesired side reactions, and such processes should be taken into account when WO3 photoanodes are incorporated into multi-component devices for solar-driven water splitting.
