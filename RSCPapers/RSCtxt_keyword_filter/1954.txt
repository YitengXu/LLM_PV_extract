, Accepted 16th February 2016First published on 18th February 2016AbstractThe synthesis of two porphyrins with donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) molecular architecture is described, namely Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b), which consist of a 4-tert-butyl-phenyl group as donor and either a pyridine or a bipyridine group as acceptor at opposite positions of the porphyrin macrocycle. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the two compounds, as well as theoretical DFT calculation results suggest that the two porphyrins have the potential to act as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Both dyes contain N(pyridyl) atoms able to act as anchors onto the acid sites of TiO2. A Znpor-py (3a) sensitized solar cell was found to exhibit power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.57%, while the corresponding Znpor-bpy (3b)-functionalized solar cell showed a higher PCE of 5.08%. The enhanced short circuit current Jsc and open circuit voltage Voc parameters are the main factors responsible for the improved photovoltaic performance of the latter solar cell. These are attributed to its faster charge injection into the TiO2 photoanode and its reduced charge recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which result from the stronger binding and coordination geometry of the bipyridine anchoring group on TiO2. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the two solar cells further support these assumptions, revealing a higher charge recombination resistance Rrec and a longer electron lifetime τe for the Znpor-bpy (3b) sensitized solar cell.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), since their first report in 1991,1 have attracted considerable research interest, owing to their potential use in solar-into-electrical energy conversion devices that exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCE), and low cost of fabrication.2–7 Photosensitizers are key components of DSSCs, which are responsible for absorbing photons and injecting electrons, upon their excitation, into the TiO2 conduction band at the anode electrode of the devices.8–10 Thus, the development of new efficient sensitizers has become a very attractive and challenging field of today's research. Among the most efficient DSSC sensitizers are ruthenium–polypyridyl complexes, which have allowed the fabrication of DSSCs with PCE values of 11%.11–13 However, the limited resources and the high cost of ruthenium metal substantially hinder their practical application.
Over the last decade, many efforts have been devoted to the design of new, low-cost, noble metal-free DSSC sensitizers.2,14,15 The basic design strategy for efficient dyes of this type is the synthesis of molecules with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) or “push–pull” molecular architecture, which, in some cases, resulted in PCE values of 10%.16–19 Porphyrins constitute a particular type of noble metal-free dyes considered to be a very promising class of DSSC sensitizers.20–30 This is due to their unique properties, which include efficient solar energy absorption in the visible region of electromagnetic spectrum with high molar extinction coefficients, suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, and ability to control their physicochemical properties through appropriate synthetic modification. Indeed, porphyrin based sensitizers with “push–pull” molecular architectures have resulted in DSSCs that exhibit higher than 10% PCE values,31–37 with the most efficient porphyrin dyes reaching the impressive PCE values of 12–13%.38–40
In most of these noble metal-free D–π–A sensitizers, carboxylic acids and cyanoacrylic acid have commonly been used as acceptor and anchoring groups for the attachment of the dye onto the TiO2 surface of the anode electrode. Among them, cyanoacrylic acid has been proved to be the most effective, since it red shifts and broadens the absorption spectra of the corresponding dyes resulting in enhanced electron injection efficiencies. However, the use of cyanoacrylic acid as binding unit also results in fast degradation of the dyes on the TiO2 surface, affecting the device long-term stability.41 Moreover, it can undergo trans-to-cis-photo isomerization, a process that competes with electron injection and has a harmful effect on the cell performance.42 Recently, a tropolone group has been employed for the first time as an anchoring group for dye-sensitized solar cells, enhancing the binding ability with respect to its carboxylic analogue porphyrin.43
Other electron accepting units that have been recently examined as anchoring groups in DSSC sensitizers44 include pyridine45–48 and pyridinium groups.49 The coordinate bond of the N-atom of the pyridyl group to the Lewis acid sites of TiO2 provides good electron communication between them, leading to very efficient electron injection. In 2013, Wang and coworkers first reported DSSCs sensitized by D–π–A porphyrin dyes with pyridyl anchoring groups, which resulted in PCE values of ∼4.0%.50 Furthermore, Sun and coworkers employed N-(carboxymethyl) pyridinium as electron-withdrawing anchoring group for a series of hemicyanine dyes, which showed PCE values higher than their cyanoacrylic acid counterparts (∼7.0%). Moreover, Grätzel and coworkers have employed porphyrin sensitizers bearing pyridyl anchoring groups resulting in DSSCs with PCE values of 8.5% and impressing long-term stability.51
Our research group has also reported the use of simple porphyrin sensitizers with pyridyl anchoring groups for the fabrication of DSSCs, which reached a maximum PCE value of 3.9%.52 In a more recent report, we synthesized two tetra-aryl substituted, “spider-shaped” zinc-metallated porphyrins, bearing four oligo (p-phenylenevinylene) pyridyl groups with long dodecyloxy chains on the phenyl groups, as sensitizers for the fabrication of DSSCs achieving a maximum PCE of 5.12%.53 Continuing our efforts towards this direction, we describe herein the synthesis, and optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of two simple “push–pull” porphyrins bearing pyridyl (py) and bipyridyl (bpy) acceptor-anchoring groups, namely the compounds Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b) (Scheme 1). Moreover, we compare the effect of pyridyl and bipyridyl anchoring groups on the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding DSSCs.

Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out at room temperature using an Auto Lab PGSTAT20 potentiostat and appropriate routines available in the operating software (GPES, version 4.9). Measurements were carried out in freshly distilled and deoxygenated THF, with a scan rate 100 mV s−1, with a solute concentration of 1.0 mM, in the presence of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode cell setup was used with a platinum working electrode, a saturated calomel (SCE) reference electrode, and a platinum wire as counter electrode.
Photophysical measurements
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer using 10 mm path-length cuvettes. Emission spectra were recorded on a JASCO FP-6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a red sensitive WRE-343 photomultiplier tube (wavelength range 200–850 nm). For the UV-vis spectra on TiO2 film, the TiO2 (∼12 μm) was immersed into a dye solution THF/EtOH (2:1 v/v) mixture containing chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 0.4 mM) for 12 h and then washed. Then the dye loaded TiO2 film was put on the sample assembly for thin film absorption in the UV-absorption spectrophotometer and recorded the absorption spectra at the interval of 0.5 nm. For the emission measurements on the TiO2 films, the films were placed diagonally in an appropriate holder. The excitation beam was directed 45° to the film surface and the emitted light was monitored from the front face of the sample.
Computational methods
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations57 were performed using the GAUSSIAN 03 program suite.58 Geometry optimizations in gas phase and in THF were carried out by employing Becke three parameter exchange in conjunction with Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP).59,60 For the geometry optimizations, the LANL2DZ basis set was used for Zn atoms and the 6-31G(d) basis sets for lighter atoms. The input geometries were modeled using the ChemCraft software.61 The optimized minimum-energy structures were verified as stationary points on the potential energy surface by vibrational frequency analysis calculation. Solvent effects were evaluated by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) implemented on Gaussian 03, in which the cavity is generated via overlapping spheres, previously developed by Tomasi.62,63 Computed structures and molecular orbitals were visualized and analyzed using ChemCraft software.

Electrodes of DSSCs were based on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, which were pre-cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol and then dried in ambient conditions. TiO2 working electrodes and Pt coated counter electrodes were fabricated as reported earlier.64 Dye-sensitized photoanodes were obtained by immersing the TiO2 electrode into 0.3 mM solutions of porphyrins in a THF/EtOH (2:1 v/v) mixture containing chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 0.4 mM) for 12 h. We have used CDCA to reduce the dye aggregation, as most of the porphyrin dye undergoes dye aggregation when adsorbed on to TiO2 film. The electrodes were assembled into a sealed sandwiched type cell by heating at 80 °C with a thermal adhesive film (25 μm thick Surlyn) as spacer between the electrodes. A drop of electrolyte solution containing 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M LiI, 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimdazolium iodide and 0.5 M tert-butyl-pyridine (TBP) in a CH3CN/valeronitrile (85/15 v/v) mixture, was placed space between the electrodes, through a hole predrilled in the counter electrode and then the hole was again sealed with Surlyn polymer and cover glass.
Photovoltaic measurements
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs under illumination were measured by a Keithley source meter, and a solar simulator coupled with a 150 W xenon lamp and an AM optical filter to give 100 mW cm−2 illumination at the DSSC surface. The active area of the DSSCs was 0.20 cm2. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data were obtained as a function of different wavelengths by using a xenon lamp, a monochromator, and a Keithley source meter under constant illumination intensity at each wavelength. Intensity calibration for IPCE data was performed using a standard silicon photo-diode. Current was measured in short circuit conditions. Electrochemical impedance (EI) spectra, in dark and under illumination, were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT) with a frequency response analyzer. A frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz and an alternative-current potential of 10 mV were used. A direct-current bias equivalent to the open-circuit voltage of DSSC was applied. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were analyzed using Z-View software with an appropriate equivalent circuit.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, both Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b) consist of zinc-metallated porphyrin units which are substituted at opposite 5 and 15 meso positions of the macrocyclic rings with a 4-tert-butyl-phenyl group and either a pyridyl or a bipyridyl group, while at the other two meso positions bromine atoms are present. The pyridyl-containing moieties of both porphyrins have the potential to act as anchoring groups onto the TiO2 surface of DSSC electrodes through Lewis acid–base interactions. Considering the 4-tert-butyl-phenyl group as electron donating (D) group and the pyridyl-containing moieties as electron accepting (A) groups, both porphyrins can be regarded as dyes with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) molecular architecture.
The initial step of the synthesis of Znpor-py (3a) involved the preparation of porphyrin 1a (Scheme 2). This 5,15-AB-type porphyrin was synthesized by a mixed condensation reaction of dipyrromethane with two different aldehydes,65 namely 4-tert-butyl-benzaldehyde and 4-pyridyl-aldehyde, which was acid-catalyzed by BF3·OEt2, in a CH2Cl2/MeOH mixture for 3 days, followed by addition of DDQ. Due to the fact that the pyridyl group of 4-pyridyl-aldehyde has the potential to react with BF3 and reduce its efficiency to catalyze the condensation, it is necessary to use excess BF3·OEt2 and long reaction time. The desired asymmetric product 1a was chromatographically separated and isolated from the statistical mixture of the three different porphyrins that are formed, using silica gel followed by alumina column chromatography and CH2Cl2 as eluent, in 13% yield. Subsequent reaction of 1a with excess of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O in MeOH/CH2Cl2, at 40 °C for 24 h, resulted in the preparation of zinc-metallated porphyrin 2a. Di-brominated porphyrin 3a was obtained in 61% yield, by reaction of 2a with two equivalents of NBS in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C. Compound Znpor-bpy (3b) was prepared following an analogous synthetic route as in the case of porphyrin 3a (Scheme 2). Initially, porphyrin 1b was synthesized by acid catalyzed mixed condensation reaction of dipyrromethane with 4-tert-butyl-benzaldehyde and bipyridyl-4-aldehyde. After metalation reaction with Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and bromination reaction with NBS, the final product 3b was obtained.

X-ray crystallography
Single crystals of porphyrin 2b suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained by slow evaporation of a CH2Cl2/THF solution of 2b. The compound was crystallized in the form of its THF adduct. Crystal structure and refinement parameters are given in Table 1. A drawing of the structure is shown in Fig. 1, while selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 2 (full list of bond distances and angles are provided in Table S3 in ESI†). The structure consists of a Zn-metallated porphyrin unit in which the metal atom is coordinated by four pyrrole N-atoms. The Zn–N (pyrrole) bond lengths were found to be within the range of 2.053–2.065 Å. In general, a 4-coordinate Zn metal atom located in the center of a porphyrin unit has the ability to bind Lewis bases on both sides of the molecular framework. In the present case, there is only one THF solvent molecule axially coordinated on one side, with a Zn–O1 distance of 2.190(2) Å, resulting in a 5-coordinate, square-pyramidal geometry. The THF molecule was found to exhibit a two-fold orientation disorder (Fig. S1†). In this coordination environment, the Zn metal atom appears to deviate from the mean plane of the pyrrole N-atoms by 0.22 Å, as it has typically been observed in related structures.66,67 The 4-tert-butyl-phenyl and bipyridyl groups located at opposite positions at the periphery of the porphyrin macrocycle were found to be in an almost perpendicular orientation with respect to the porphyrin framework, with dihedral angles of ∼95° and ∼110°, respectively.

Photophysical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b) in THF solutions are shown in Fig. 2 (black color). Both compounds exhibit similar absorption profiles with typical porphyrin absorption characteristics, which include a strong Soret band appearing at 400–450 nm and moderate Q-bands at 550–650 nm. These are attributed to π–π* transitions within the D–π–A conjugated macrocyclic porphyrin rings.20
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of (a) Znpor-py (3a) and (b) Znpor-bpy (3b) in THF solutions (black color) and adsorbed onto TiO2 films (red color). 
The absorption spectra of porphyrins 3a and 3b adsorbed onto TiO2 films were also recorded (Fig. 2a and b, red color). Both porphyrins show similar absorption profiles, indicating that their light harvesting efficiencies are very similar. Furthermore, the Soret and Q-absorption bands of the adsorbed dyes on TiO2 films appear broader and red-shifted, with respect to the corresponding solution spectra. The broadening of the absorption bands is attributed to the electronic coupling between the dyes and the TiO2 semiconductor.68–71 Furthermore, the absorption characteristics of the adsorbed dyes provide information for their aggregation morphology on the TiO2 electrode. H-aggregates, in which molecules are aligned parallel to each other with strong intermolecular interactions, tend to induce a non-radiative deactivation process72 and leads to blue shift of the absorption bands. In contrast, J-aggregates, in which the molecules are arranged in a head-to-tail direction, induce relatively high fluorescence efficiency with a bathochromic shift in optical absorption band. The redshift observed in the absorption bands of the two porphyrins 3a and 3b is thought to result from the formation of J-aggregates on the TiO2 surface (shown for 3a/TiO2 in Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Schematic representation of J-aggregate formation for Znpor-py (3a) when attached onto TiO2 film. 
The fluorescent emission spectra of porphyrins 3a and 3b in THF were also recorded and shown in Fig. 3. Both porphyrins exhibit two peaks of unequal intensities at 612 nm and 672 nm, respectively, upon excitation at 565 nm. We have also recorded the fluorescent emission spectra of porphyrins adsorbed onto TiO2 film as shown in Fig. 3. After the adsorption of porphyrin dye onto TiO2 film, the fluorescence bands were slightly red-shifted and broadened as compared to those of the dyes in solutions. The red-shift of the fluorescence is probably due to the interaction with the nanoparticles (anchoring effect) or with other dye molecules.

Electrochemistry
In order to study the feasibility of electron injection and dye regeneration processes in the Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b) sensitized solar cells, cyclic voltammetry measurements of the two porphyrins in THF solutions, using tetrabutyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate as supporting electrolyte, were performed. As shown in the cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 4, both porphyrins 3a and 3b exhibit one oxidation process, at Eox1/2 = +1.23 and +1.21 V vs. SCE, respectively, which corresponds to removal of an electron from the π-ring system of the zinc-porphyrin, resulting in the formation of the corresponding porphyrin radical cation, and one reduction process, at Ered1/2 = −1.11 and −1.09 V vs. SCE, respectively, which is attributed to the reduction of the porphyrin unit, forming a porphyrin radical anion.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms of Znpor-py (3a) (blue color) and Znpor-bpy (3b) (red color) in THF solutions. 
For efficient electron injection from the excited state of a sensitizer into the TiO2 conduction band of a DSSC, the LUMO energy level of the sensitizer (which corresponds to its first reduction potential) should be higher (more negative) than the TiO2 conduction band edge (−0.74 V vs. SCE). Both porphyrins 3a and 3b exhibit Ered1/2 values, which are more negative than TiO2 conduction band edge, suggesting that there is sufficient driving force for electron injection from their excited state into the TiO2 conduction band. On the other hand, in order to ensure efficient regeneration of sensitizer (after electron injection) in a DSSC, the HOMO energy level (which corresponds to its first oxidation potential) should be lower (more positive) than the redox potential of the electrolyte employed in the DSSC (0.4 V vs. SCE for I3−/I−). The oxidation potentials of both porphyrins 3a and 3b are more positive than the corresponding electrolyte redox potential, and therefore, regeneration of porphyrin dyes, after the electron injection, is thermodynamically feasible.73
DFT calculations
In order to gain insight into the molecular and electronic structures of Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b), DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(*) level of theory were performed in THF. The geometry-optimized structures of the two porphyrins are depicted in Fig. 5, while their optimized coordinates are provided in Table S7 and S8 (ESI†). Both compounds display a planar central scaffold, which is in accordance with p–π conjugated systems, with the Zn atoms being coplanar with the four pyrrole rings. The meso-substitutents, 4-tert-butyl-phenyl and either pyridyl or bipyridyl groups, are in an almost perpendicular orientation with respect to the corresponding porphyrin frameworks. In the case of both dyes 3a and 3b, the dihedral angles of 4-tert-butyl-phenyl and pyridyl group regarding the porphyrin ring were found ∼67°. The electron density distributions of the frontier and near frontier molecular orbitals of compounds 3a and 3b are shown in Fig. 6. In general, they are primarily extended over the zinc-porphyrin units and partly delocalized over the corresponding meso-substituents. For example, in case of Znpor-bpy (3b) (the porphyrin with the better photovoltaic performance), HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 are essentially porphyrin-based π molecular orbitals, which is in agreement with the Gouterman's four orbital model of porphyrins.74 Furthermore, in HOMO and HOMO−2 there are additional contributions over the 4-tert-butyl-phenyl group, while in LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 there is significant delocalization over the bipyridyl group. Similar electron density distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals were also found for Znpor-py (3a) (Fig. 6). Therefore, the calculated electron density distributions of both compounds favor intramolecular electron transfer, upon photoexcitation, from the 4-tert-butyl-phenyl donor (D) group to the pyridyl acceptor/anchoring (A) groups through the porphyrin π system (which is consistent with the D–π–A description of the two compounds), and promote electron injection, upon their binding onto TiO2.

The calculated dipole moments μ of Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b) were found to be 4.58 and 5.57 D, respectively (Table 3). The larger μ value for the latter implies an enhanced ability for directed intramolecular electron transfer and electron injection into TiO2, which is in accordance with the observed longer electron lifetime and enhanced photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solar cell (see electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photovoltaic measurements results).

FTIR spectra
To get structural information on the attachment of Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b) on the TiO2 surface of DSSCs, FTIR spectra of the two dyes in neat form and when adsorbed on TiO2 films were recorded (as shown in Fig. 7 for 3a and 3a/TiO2). The spectra of both porphyrins in pure form exhibit similar absorption characteristics, with bands for the stretching vibrations of CC and C–N at 1602 and 1452 cm−1 for 3a and 1581 and 1454 cm−1 for 3b. Upon adsorption of the porphyrins onto TiO2, a new absorption band appears at 1634 cm−1, which can be assigned to the pyridyl group coordinated to a Lewis acid site of the TiO2 surface.48,75

Photovoltaic performance
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs sensitized by Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b) are shown in Fig. 8a, while the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 4. The optimum values of the short circuit current Jsc, open circuit voltage Voc, and fill factor FF parameters were found to be 8.58 mA cm−2, 0.63 V and 0.66 for the 3a-based solar cell, and 10.52 mA cm−2, 0.69 V, and 0.70 for the 3b-based solar cell, which correspond to overall PCE values of 3.57 and 5.08%, respectively.

A principal reason for the higher PCE value of the 3b-based solar cell is its higher Jsc value, which is reflected in its higher incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) response. The IPCE spectra of the two solar cells are shown in Fig. 7b. In general, they exhibit very similar IPCE profiles (as shown in the normalized IPCE spectra of the DSSCs in the inset of Fig. 8b), but the IPCE response of the solar cell sensitized by 3b is higher than the IPCE response of the solar cell sensitized by 3a. In general, the monochromatic IPCE for a DSSC is given by the expression7,76IPCE(λ) = ηLHEηinjηccwhere ηLHE is the light harvesting efficiency (which is related to the absorption profile of the sensitizing dye and the amount of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface), ηinj is the electron injection efficiency (which is related to the electron injection rate from the excited state of the sensitizer into the TiO2 conduction band), and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency (which is related to the recombination rate of injected electrons with the oxidized dye or redox couple in the electrolyte). We have measured the dye loading onto the TiO2 film using dye desorption method and found the this is about 3.4 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 3.12 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for 3a and 3b, respectively. Considering that the dye loading is similar for both the dyes leading to similar LHE, we assume that the major factors that lead to a higher IPCE response for the 3b-based solar cell should be ηinj and ηcc. This can justified by the chemical structures of the two sensitizers, since 3b can be considered to be a molecule with a double-pyridine anchoring group, compared to the single pyridine group of 3a, which has the potential to coordinate stronger and increase the interfacial electron transfer process, and therefore leading to a higher ηinj value. Moreover, both DSSCs showed two times higher IPCE value at the Soret band than at the Q bands. This could be attributed to better overlapping between the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 orbitals of the porphyrins and the TiO2 conduction band when both dyes were excited at the of the Soret band wavelengths. As can be seen in the fluorescence spectra of porphyrin dyes adsorbed on TiO2 (Fig. 3), the fluorescence intensity was more quenched for 3b porphyrin as compared to 3a, also suggesting that the photo-induced charge transfer is more pronounced in for later, leading to higher Jsc and PCE for 3b sensitized DSSC.
The enhanced photovoltaic performance of the 3b-based solar cell is also related to its enhanced Voc parameter. In general, the Voc value of DSSC is determined by the potential difference between the quasi Fermi level of TiO2 (ECB) and the HOMO energy level of the redox couple (Eredox) in the electrolyte, as described by the following relationship.77  where k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, q is the electronic charge, NCB is the effective electron density of states at TiO2 conduction band edge, n is the concentration of injected electrons in TiO2 conduction band edge. Since the same electrolyte redox couple was used for both 3a- and 3b-based DSSCs, their different Voc values result from differences in the quasi Fermi level of TiO2 conduction band. The quasi Fermi level of TiO2 is influenced by the balance between electron injection and charge recombination, i.e. the number of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. The higher Voc value of the 3b-sensitized DSSC could be attributed to a larger number of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band, which results from a more effective interfacial electron injection caused by the bipyridine anchoring group. In addition, the higher Voc value of the solar cell sensitized by 3b is also determined by the recombination rate of the injection electrons with the redox active species of the electrolyte (I3−), as discussed in the following paragraphs.
To shed light in the relationship between the electron transfer kinetics and the corresponding photovoltaic properties of the two DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. The Nyquist and Bode plots for the two DSSCs in dark, under a forward bias of −0.64 V, are shown in Fig. 9a and b, respectively. The Nyquist plots of both solar cells show three semicircles in the frequency ranges 105–103, 103–1, and 1–10−2 Hz which corresponds to impedances at counter electrode/electrolyte interface, TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and diffusion process in electrolyte, respectively.78,79 The larger radius of the middle frequency semicircle signal of the 3b-sensitized solar cell, compared to that of the 3a-based solar cell, indicates a higher charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (63 vs. 42 Ω cm2, respectively). In other words, the 3b-based solar cell exhibits a slower charge recombination rate, which leads to a more effective charge recombination retardation between injected electron into the TiO2 conduction band and oxidized species (I3−) in the electrolyte. The characteristic middle frequency signal in the Bode phase plot of a DSSC is also related to the charge recombination rate. In particular, the reciprocal of the peak frequency maximum (fmax) of this signal is related to electron lifetime (τe) according to the relationship  
 Fig. 9  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode phase plots of electrochemical impedance spectra of DSSCs sensitized with Znpor-py (3a) (black color) and Znpor-bpy (3b) (red color) in dark at open circuit condition. 
As shown in Fig. 9b, the peak frequency for the 3b-based solar cell is lower than that for the 3a-based solar cell, which leads to a longer electron lifetime for the former cell (31 vs. 18 ms for 3b and 3a, respectively). In other words, the DSSC sensitized by 3b exhibits a slower charge recombination rate, which is consistent with the presence of the bipyridine anchoring group in the molecular structure of 3b that offers more pathways for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band, compared to the simple pyridine group in 3a.
These results are further supported by measurement of the J–V characteristics of the two DSSCs under dark conditions (Fig. 10), since the dark current is a measure of the recombination process in a DSSC. Due to the fact that the dark current of the 3b-based DSSC is found to be lower than that of the 3a-based DSSC, the former device exhibits a higher charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.
 Fig. 10  Current–voltage (J–V) curves in dark of DSSCs sensitized with Znpor-py (3a) (black color) and Znpor-bpy (3b) (red color). 
As mentioned above, the reason for the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the 3b-sensitized solar cell, compared to the 3a-based solar cell, can be associated with the molecular structures of the corresponding sensitizers. Since the two porphyrins exhibit very similar light absorption characteristics, their difference results only from the anchoring groups they use for attachment to the TiO2 photoanodes. Both compounds are bound to the acid sites of TiO2 through their N(pyridyl) atoms. It has been recently shown that N(pyridyl) containing anchoring groups provide efficient adsorption of the sensitizers onto the TiO2 surface and support an excellent electronic coupling between the levels of the excited sensitizer and those of TiO2.34,50 The presence of bipyridyl group in 3b, which offers two effectively bound pyridyl groups, in contrast to only one pyridyl group in 3a, results in more effective binding and formation of a more compact layer of 3b onto the TiO2 surface, and provides more electron transfer pathways to the TiO2 surface, leading to a faster and more efficient electron injection process (Scheme 4), which is demonstrated by its longer electron lifetime. The coordination geometries of the two dyes onto the TiO2 surface might also play a significant role. The presence of a pyridyl group in Znpor-py (3a) results in a perpendicular edge-to-face attachment of the porphyrin unit with respect to the TiO2 surface, while in case of Znpor-bpy (3b), the two pyridyl groups of the bipyridyl anchoring moiety result in a coordination geometry with a slightly tilted porphyrin unit with respect to the TiO2 surface. Considering that in both cases porphyrin units form J-aggregates upon their adsorption onto TiO2 (see Photophysical measurements), in case of the 3b-sensitized solar cell the tilted porphyrin units form a more compact hydrophobic layer at the TiO2 surface than in the 3a-based solar cell, which causes retardation of the I3− diffusion onto the TiO2 electrode and results in a more effective suppression of charge recombination (RC) between the injected electron and electrolyte redox couple (Scheme 4). Nevertheless, advanced spectroscopic techniques, in combination with computational studies, are needed in order to investigate in detail the relationship between adsorption geometry and electron transfer between the adsorbed porphyrin unit and the TiO2 surface.

Conclusions
Herein, we present the synthesis of two porphyrins with the D–π–A molecular architecture, which are functionalized with terminal pyridyl and bipyridyl acceptor groups, namely Znpor-py (3a) and Znpor-bpy (3b). The N-containing units of the two porphyrins have the potential to act as anchoring groups on the TiO2 surface, while photophysical and electrochemical measurements of the two compounds, supported by theoretical DFT calculations, revealed the presence of suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels for utilization as sensitizers in DSSCs. Photovoltaic measurements of the corresponding DSSCs showed an enhanced photovoltaic performance for the Znpor-bpy (3b)-sensitized solar cell, as a result of its higher short circuit current Jsc and open circuit voltage Voc parameters. This was attributed to the more effective binding of the bipyridine anchoring group onto the TiO2 surface and the formation of a more compact dye layer on the Znpor-bpy (3b) based solar cell photoanode, which result in higher charge injection efficiency, and more effective suppression of recombination of the injected electrons with I3− in the electrolyte. These arguments are supported by EIS measurements, which show higher charge recombination resistance Rrec, and longer electron lifetime τe for the Znpor-bpy (3b)-based solar cell.
