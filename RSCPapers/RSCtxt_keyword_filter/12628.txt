    , Accepted 30th April 2016First published on 3rd May 2016AbstractThree new N-annulated perylene (NP) substituted porphyrin dyes WW-7–WW-9 with different linking modes and accepting groups were synthesized and applied in Co(II)/(III) based dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The bay-linked porphyrins WW-7 and WW-8 exhibited moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE = 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively), while the peri-linked porphyrin dye WW-9 showed a PCE up to 9.2% which is slightly lower than that of our reference dye WW-6. Detailed physical measurements (optical and electrochemical), DFT calculations, and photovoltaic characterizations were performed to understand how the structural changes affect their light-harvesting ability, molecular orbital profile, energy level alignment, and eventually the photovoltaic performance. It turned out that the lower efficiencies of the cells based on WW-7 and WW-8 could be ascribed to the weak π-conjugation between the bay-substituted NP and phenylethynyl substituted porphyrin unit. The introduction of a benzothiadiazole acceptor at the anchoring group has induced a significant red shift of the IPCE action spectra of WW-8 and WW-9, by about 90 nm and 50 nm as compared to that of WW-7 and WW-6, respectively. However, less efficient electron injection was observed. Our studies gave some insight into the important role of electronic interactions between different components when one designs a dye for high-efficiency DSCs.
Introduction
Zinc–porphyrin based dyes have received considerable attention for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) due to their superior light-harvesting ability and easy chemical tuning of the physical properties.1 Current research of porphyrin dyes generally focuses on the functionalization of their β position2 or meso position3 to generate dyes with appropriate energy levels and strong light-harvesting properties. Recently, using a cobalt-based electrolyte, a zinc porphyrin sensitizer (YD2-o-C8) co-sensitized with an organic dye (Y123) has attained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.3%, setting a breakthrough in this area.4 Further structural modification with the introduction of a benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor at the anchoring group has dramatically improved its absorption properties, leading to a record of 13% PCE.5
In general, the design of these organic sensitizers follows the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration as strong intramolecular charge transfer properties are expected for these push–pull type structures. Among them, the donor groups are considerably important as they not only affect the absorption spectra but also adjust the energy levels of the sensitizers.6 Even a small modification of the donor group may lead to a significant change in the cell performance. Thus, it is essential to choose a suitable donor group with an appropriate balance of various factors including light harvesting ability, molecular orbital profile, energy level alignment, dye aggregation,7etc. Among the various building blocks, N-annulated perylene (NP), in which a nitrogen atom is annulated at one bay position of perylene, is an ideal electron donor due to its intrinsic electron-rich nature.8 It has quickly emerged as a superior building block for organic materials.9 Recently, our group for the first time employed NP as an electron donor in push–pull type porphyrin dyes and one of these dyes (WW-6, Fig. 1) could give higher than 10% PCE in Co(II)/(III) electrolyte based DSCs.10 Subsequently, the use of NP as a building block in DSCs has been carried out independently by Wang,11 Tian12 and our group.13 To date, most of the functionalization was done at the peri-positions of the NP unit, and very little study was conducted on the NP dyes functionalized at the bay-position (amine site).13b Considering the fact that the electron donor plays a vital role in the cell performance, we are interested in NP–porphyrin sensitizers with another linking mode, i.e., on the bay-position of NP and studying their structure–property relationships.

In this work, three new NP–porphyrin dyes WW-7–WW-9 were designed and used in DSCs. Their properties and device performances were compared to those of our previously reported dye WW-6 (Fig. 1). The molecular design is based on the following considerations: (1) NP has strong absorption in the visible range (λmaxabs = 413 nm) with a high extinction coefficient, which is beneficial for efficient light harvesting; (2) diethynyl porphyrin spacer is good for efficient π-conjugation between donor and acceptor moieties; (3) bulky 3,5-di-tert-butylbenzyl as well as o-alkoxy-substituted phenyl groups on NP and porphyrin can reduce dye aggregation and interfacial electron back-injection; (4) two different linking modes of NP units allow us to investigate their effects on device performance: namely the peri-position for WW-6 and WW-9, and the bay-position for WW-7 and WW-8; and (5) insertion of electron-deficient BT moiety at the anchoring group will enhance intramolecular charge transfer and light absorbance at longer wavelength.5,14
Results and discussion
The synthetic route towards the NP–porphyrin dyes WW-7–WW-9 is shown in Scheme 1. WW-7 and WW-8 were synthesized through a one-pot three-component reaction between bay-position functionalized NP 1,13b diethynyl porphyrin 2 and the corresponding acceptor 3/4, in 32% and 17% yield, respectively. Preparation of WW-9 using the same methodology was not feasible due to purification issues and thus stepwise Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reactions were employed. Dibrominated porphyrin 6 was reacted with ethynyl substituted NP 5,10 followed by 4-ethynyl BT functionalized benzoic acid 7 to afford WW-9 in 15% yield.

The absorption spectra of WW-7–WW-9 in THF were collected and compared with that of WW-6 (Fig. 2 and Table 1). WW-7 exhibits a strong B (or Soret) band at 454 nm (ε = 2.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and Q band at 646 nm (ε = 3.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1). In comparison, the BT functionalized dye WW-8 has similar absorption spectra as WW-7, but with its Q band red shifted by 14 nm (660 nm, ε = 6.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1). Such a trend could also be observed in the BT functionalized dye WW-9 as compared to WW-6, with its B band red shifted by 33 nm (474 nm, ε = 1.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and Q band red shifted by 14 nm (686 nm, ε = 7.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1). The red shifted absorption could be explained by the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer caused by the additional strong electron-withdrawing BT group. Moreover, a decrease of B band and an increase of Q band are observed for the BT containing dyes as compared to the non-BT containing ones (i.e., WW-9vs.WW-6, WW-8vs.WW-7). The two different linking modes of NP unit also have a strong influence on their absorption spectra. In general, the peri-NP linked dyes give more red shifted spectra as compared to the bay-NP linked dyes (i.e., WW-9vs.WW-8, WW-6vs.WW-7). This can be explained by the less conjugation of bay-linked NP with the porphyrin core of WW-7 and WW-8 (vide infra). The optical energy gaps (Eoptg) of WW-7–WW-9 were estimated from the absorption onset to be 1.85, 1.64 and 1.68 eV, respectively.

To evaluate the energetics of our synthetic dyes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in deoxygenated THF solution were performed (Fig. 3, Table 1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The potential was externally calibrated by using the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple and then was calculated versus an NHE electrode (E1/2 (Fc+/Fc) = 0.69 V vs. Ag/AgCl in our case, and 0.64 V vs. NHE). Accordingly, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of WW-7–WW-9 were estimated to be −4.98, −4.82, −4.86 eV (HOMO) and −3.12, −3.25, −3.27 eV (LUMO), respectively. As a result, their electrochemical energy gaps were determined to be 1.86, 1.57, 1.59 eV, respectively. Such values are generally in agreement with the calculated optical energy gaps.

DFT calculations were performed for WW-7–WW-9 to gain a better understanding of their molecular geometries, molecular orbitals, and optical and electronic properties. Their calculated HOMO and LUMO orbital profiles and energy levels are shown in Fig. 4, in comparison with WW-6. According to Gouterman's four-orbital model for porphyrins, the HOMOs were calculated to be an a1u and an a2u orbital, while the LUMOs were calculated to be a degenerate set of eg orbitals.15 Our porphyrin dyes are generally in agreement with this model with deviation. WW-7 shows well segregated HOMO and LUMO profiles. Its HOMO is mainly delocalized at the NP unit, while its LUMO is homogeneously distributed through the porphyrin core and the acid binding group, indicating a weak conjugation between the bay-substituted NP and phenylethynyl substituted porphyrin unit. When an additional BT unit is incorporated into the acceptor, the resulting dye WW-8 gives a substantial change in the HOMO distribution. Both HOMO and LUMO are delocalized at the central porphyrin part, leaving the bay-substituted NP non-conjugated. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO of peri-NP functionalized dye WW-9 show a disjointed character, with the HOMO distributed along the NP moiety and porphyrin core, and the LUMO delocalized through the porphyrin core and the acid binding group. Such an electron distribution map is similar to that of our previously reported porphyrin dye WW-6. Time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations also predict that WW-7–WW-9 show the longest-wavelength absorption maximum at 624.8, 704.8 and 782.1 nm, respectively (Fig. S2–S4 in the ESI†), which follows the same trend with the experimental observations.

DSCs were fabricated by using the newly synthesized dyes WW-7–WW-9 adsorbed onto a bilayer titania film16 with Co(II)/(III) as the electrolyte (see details in the ESI†). As compared to our previously reported dye WW-6 (Jsc = 17.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 840 mV, FF = 0.738 and PCE = 10.6%), the bay-NP functionalized dye WW-7 only showed a moderate PCE of 4.4% (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The Voc of WW-7 decreased to 708 mV and its Jsc value was only half of that of WW-6. The photocurrent action spectrum of WW-7 showed a maximum IPCE value of 69% at 460 nm. However, the moderate light harvesting ability has induced a large gap of the IPCE spectra from 460 nm to 670 nm, which eventually affected the overall efficiency. The BT incorporated dye WW-8 also showed a moderate power conversion efficiency of 4.8%, and both of its Voc and Jsc are similar to those of WW-7. The onset of the IPCE spectrum is red shifted to 840 nm for WW-8 as compared to 750 nm for WW-7, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum. However, its IPCE values are much lower (<41%), indicating less efficient electron injection. This is because the bay-NP unit donor is isolated and does not participate in the electron injection process of WW-8. In contrast, when the peri-NP substituted dye WW-9 was tested for photovoltaic performance, it gave a promising PCE result of 9.2%. Both of the Voc and Jsc are higher than those of the bay-NP functionalized dyes WW-7 and WW-8. However, they are still lower than those of our earlier reported dye WW-6. Although the onset of the photocurrent action spectrum of WW-9 was red shifted to 865 nm as compared to 815 nm for WW-6, the IPCE values were generally lower. One of the possible reasons for the lower efficiency of WW-9 may be attributed to its dye geometry on TiO2. WW-9 possesses a longer length than WW-6 due to the additional BT unit and it tends to tilt more intensively on TiO2. As a result, a faster charge recombination between the injected electron in TiO2 and the oxidized dye would be expected, which will eventually lead to lower IPCE, Jsc, and power conversion efficiency.17 Considering all these factors, the overall device performance of WW-9 was lower than that of WW-6.

To further understand the dye structure–device performance relationship, we conducted further physical measurements on the WW-7–WW-9 cells, with the WW-6 cell as a reference. For a short-circuit DSC device, it is recognized that the charge recombination flux is considerably reduced as the Jsc is measured at the condition of a considerable low electron density in the titania film. Therefore, the measured Jsc is roughly proportional to the photocarrier generation flux. This has motivated us to compare the dye structure-correlated Voc variation at a given Jsc. Fig. 6 shows the open-circuit photovoltage as a function of Jsc by measuring J–V curves under various light intensities. It is noted that at a given Jsc, the WW-6 cell exhibits a higher Voc than WW-9, followed by WW-8 and WW-7.
 Fig. 6  Plots of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) versus short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). 
It is widely accepted that the rise or fall of Voc for a fixed redox electrolyte in DSCs is determined by the titania electron quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n), which is intrinsically due to the change of titania conduction band edge (Ec) and a variation of titania electron density.18 Among these two factors, the titania electron density is determined by the interfacial recombination rate of titania electrons with electron accepting species in electrolytes and/or dye cations when the device is measured at a given flux of photocarrier generation. Therefore charge extraction and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurements were further carried out to understand the electronic origins of the abovementioned Voc fluctuation. As shown in Fig. 7a, the cells made with WW-6–WW-9 showed a similar extracted charge (Q) at the same potential bias Voc, suggesting a fixed conduction-band edge of titania with respect to the electrolyte Fermi-level. As Fig. 7b presents, the WW-6 cell displayed a longer charge recombination lifetime (τn) than the other three cells at a given charge Q, accounting for the aforementioned more superior photovoltage at a given Jsc for WW-6 than for WW-9, followed by that for WW-8 and WW-7. The observed higher Voc for the WW-6 cell as compared to the WW-9 cell could be ascribed to the slight rise of the HOMO of WW-9, which could diminish the dye regeneration. Moreover, WW-9 shows a lower-lying LUMO, which may make the electron injection rate into the conduction band of TiO2 slower.

Conclusions
In summary, three types of NP functionalized porphyrin dyes with different accepting groups were synthesized and tested for dye sensitized solar cells. The bay-NP functionalized porphyrin dyes WW-7 and WW-8 gave only moderate power conversion efficiency, mainly due to their insufficient π-conjugation of bay-substituted NP with the porphyrin core. In contrast, the peri-NP functionalized dye WW-9 exhibited improved π-conjugation properties and up to 9.2% efficiency could be obtained. It is worth noting that the onset of the IPCE spectra of WW-9 has further been red shifted by 50 nm as compared to that of WW-6. Further work to develop new dyes and improve the device performance is underway in our laboratories.
Experimental section
Synthesis of WW-7
A solution mixture of perylene 1 (34.2 mg, 0.05 mmol), diethynyl porphyrin 2 (65 mg, 0.05 mmol) and 4-bromobenzoic acid 3 (10.1 mg, 0.05 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) and triethylamine (4 mL) was degassed with argon for 15 min. Pd2(dba)3 (9.2 mg, 0.01 mmol) and AsPh3 (15.3 mg, 0.05 mmol) were then added and the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight under argon.

Synthesis of WW-9
A 100 mL round bottom flask was charged with dibromo porphyrin 6 (142 mg, 0.1 mmol), ethynyl substituted perypene 5 (63 mg, 0.1 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (9.2 mg, 0.01 mmol), AsPh3 (15.3 mg, 0.05 mmol) Et3N (8 mL) and THF (40 mL) under argon. The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 24 hours. After removal of the solvents, the crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, DCM:hexane = 1:5) to give a purple solid product (40 mg), which was subjected to the next step of coupling reaction directly. To this purple solid was added 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (28 mg, 0.1 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (9.2 mg, 0.01 mmol), AsPh3 (15.3 mg, 0.05 mmol), Et3N (4 mL) and THF (20 mL) under argon.
