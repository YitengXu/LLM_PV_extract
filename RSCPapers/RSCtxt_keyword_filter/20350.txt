    , Accepted 17th November 2020First published on 18th November 2020AbstractIn this work, three p-type small molecules (CL-1–3) based on tetraphenylethylene as the core and fused ring-terminated diarylamine as electron donating groups were synthesized. The design strategy for fused ring-terminated diarylamines involved the use of benzene for CL-1, naphthalene for CL-2, and pyrene for CL-3. We then investigated the effects of various electron-donating groups on their electronic properties. Among them, the CL-3 sample showed the highest Tg value (192 °C) and 5 wt% decomposition temperature (473 °C). In the presence of urea as an additive, inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing inorganic/organic (NiOx/CL series) bilayer HTLs and reference inorganic (NiOx)-only HTL were fabricated. Notably, the NiOx/CL-3-based cell exhibited the champion power conversion efficiency of 20.15%, which outperformed the NiOx-only cell (PCE = 18.66%) due to its smoother surface morphology, better interface charge transfer and matched energy-level alignment. Furthermore, this device also exhibited greater hydrophobicity and acceptable long-term stability. This work presents a new molecular design and in-depth understanding of the bilayer HTL strategy and its potential for the development of highly efficient cell performances.
1. Introduction
Organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become leading materials in the new generation of thin film photovoltaic devices due to their advantages of low fabrication cost and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–4 The PCE of the single PSC has experienced an unprecedented rise from the initial 3.8% in 2009 to a certified value of 25.2% currently.5,6 The planar PSC device is widely studied due to its simpler structure and more facile preparation process compared to the mesoporous device architecture.7–9 To date, the planar PSCs can be classified into n–i–p (conventional) and p–i–n (inverted) structures depending on the positions of the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport layer (HTL) with respect to the transparent electrode.10–12 Inverted PSCs have attracted increasing attention owing to their easy processing, less pronounced hysteresis behaviors and good long-term stability.13–15 Unfortunately, the PCEs of inverted PSCs significantly lag behind that of regularly structured devices according to pervious reports.16 Since the first p–i–n PSC was reported in 2013, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) has been commonly used as the organic HTL17,18 due to its processability at low temperature, high transparency, sufficient hole mobility and compatibility in flexible devices. Nevertheless, the acidic nature of the PEDOT:PSS layer can lead to corrosion of both the conduction film below it and the perovskite layer above it, and thus the stability of this type of cell is questionable. Furthermore, this type of device generally suffers from low open circuit voltage (Voc) values due to the energetic mismatch between the highest occupied molecule orbital (HOMO) level of PEDOT:PSS (−4.9 to −5.1 eV) and valence band of perovskite (around −5.4 eV).19 In this regard, many efforts have been devoted to exploring alternative HTMs to replace PEDOT:PSS for enhanced PCEs.12,20–24 Three classes of HTMs are utilized in inverted PSCs, the so-called inorganic HTMs, polymeric HTMs and organic-small-molecule HTMs (SM-HTMs). Among them, SM-HTMs have attracted much attention due their simple and well-defined structure, and insignificant batch-to-batch variation compared with polymers. To date, various types of SM-HTMs have been devised and investigated; however, only a few of them exhibited impressive cell performances beyond 18% in either dopant or dopant-free process.25–28 Recently, Wang and co-workers reported a novel D–A–D HTM named MPA-BTII and employed as undoped HTMs in inverted PSCs. The MPA-BTII-based device achieved a remarkable PCE of 21.17% with negligible hysteresis and superior thermal stability and long-term stability under illumination.29 Nevertheless, it is still highly desirable to explore alternative SM-HTMs to broaden the material selection for the manufacture of high-performance inverted PSCs.
Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is a well-known aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen, where the incorporated TPE entities frequently have more intense emission in the solid state than in solution. This is due to the effective suppression of direct π–π stacking interactions and restriction of intramolecular rotation, leading to non-radiative recombination. In addition, because of its highly twisted characteristics, it exhibits excellent good organosolubility even when it has none or very minimal alkyl-solubilizing groups. This material is of interest not only from the perspective of organic light-emitting diode technology, but also in bio-imaging.30–33 Currently, TPE unit was also utilized in organic solar cells (OSCs)34,35 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).36,37 Furthermore, numerous TPE-based materials have been applied in PSCs.38–42 Wu, Zhu, and co-workers functionalized a TPE core with dimethylamino, di(4-methoxyphenyl)aminophenyl and di(4-anisylamino)-9H-carbazole electron-donating substitutions for conventional PSCs. The PCEs of the cells were in the range of 13.78% to 16.74%, which were comparable and ever higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD-based cell (∼15%).38–40 In addition, a series of acceptor–TPE–acceptor SMs was also designed by the same group and used as interfacial electron transporting layers for inverted PSCs.41,42 Consequently, the devices with these interfacial layers exhibited the best PCE of 18.93%, which is superior to that of the standard device without an interlayer. Kuo et al. developed a series of conjugated covalent organic frameworks based on a building block of TPE for inverted PSCs. These materials were demonstrated to be beneficial for the crystal growth of the perovskite film, resulting in an improvement in the PCE from the pristine of 17.40% to ∼19.80%.43 Recently, Jiang et al. developed a new small molecule HTM, namely TPE-S, based on TPE as the core for inverted all-inorganic PSCs. Due to the presence of S atoms in TPE-S, a sufficient surface passivation effect and larger crystallization perovskite could be achieved. By using the specific composition of the perovskite film, the superior PCE of 21% could be achievd.44
In addition to the core, the donating groups are another important factor in enhancing the cell performance. 4,4′-Dimethoxydiphenylamine segments are the most common structures for SM-HTMs due to their high mobility, ability to form crystallized perovskite films and good organic solubility. Spiro-OMeTAD is the most typical example containing 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine segments in its structure. Thus, researchers have focused on the development of spiro-OMeTAD derivatives through different methoxy substitution positions or modified conjugation segments to fine tune their energy level, hole mobility, and thermal stability.45–47 In 2018, Jeon et al. developed a fluorene-terminated spiro-OMeTAD-like HTM (DM) for PSCs, and the DM-based devices demonstrated a high PCE of 23.2% with thermally stable characteristics.47
Thus, based on the above-mentioned considerations, in this study, three novel tetraphenylethylene-based HTMs (CL-1–3, Fig. 1) containing different π-conjugation units (benzene, naphthalene and pyrene) in diarylamine groups were synthesized and applied in inverted PSCs. The variation in the different diarylamine groups for these HTMs may lead to tunable energy levels and variations in surface property for better energy level alignment and the possibility to further manipulate the perovskite morphology. We then used these HTMs as interfacial layers between the perovskite and NiOx to passivate the interfacial defects and promote the micrometer-size perovskite growth.48 Consequently, the device configuration of ITO/NiOx/CL-3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag exhibited the best PCE of up to 20.15% with negligible hysteresis and long-term stability.

2.3 Inverted PSC device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance: 10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned ultrasonically with abstergent aqueous solution, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min, and then dried under a stream of N2. The substrates were then cleaned with air plasma for 10 min. For the single-layer HTL layer: (1) PEDOT:PSS was deposited on the ITO through spin-coating (4000 rpm, 30 s) and annealing (120 °C, 20 min); (2) CL-1–3 were deposited on top of the ITO using a 1 mg mL−1 concentration in CB at a spin rate of 3000 rpm for 20 s (ca. 10 nm); and (3) an NiOx film (ca. 20 nm) was prepared by spin-coating a solution containing the NiOx precursor [nickel(II) acetylacetonate (129 mg) dissolved in ethanol (5 mL) containing HCl (38 wt%, 50 μL)]. The NiOx-coated substrates were then baked at 320 °C for 30 min.51 For the bilayer HTL structure, these novel organic HTMs (CL-1–3) were deposited on top of NiOx using similar conditions to that for the single organic HTM mentioned above.
The MAPbI3 precursor solutions (with a 1 wt% of urea) were prepared by dissolving 1.2 M PbI2 and MAI (molar ratio, 1:1) in anhydrous DMF/DMSO (4:1) with urea as an additive. The solution was stirred at 60 °C for 2 h in an Ar-filled glove box. The perovskite precursor solutions were then spin-coated on the HTL-coated substrates with a two-step spin rate (step 1: 2000 rpm for 10 s and step 2: 4000 rpm for 20 s), and then toluene (100 μL) was applied rapidly to the substrates to induce fast crystallization. Finally, the sample was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to complete the transformation to the perovskite.52 PC61BM (20 mg mL−1 in anhydrous chlorobenzene) was deposited, followed by the deposition of BCP (2 mg mL−1 in IPA), and spin-coating was performed at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the device was completed through the evaporation of the Au contact electrodes (100 nm) at a vacuum level of 10−7 Pa through a shadow mask. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.01 cm2.
2.4 Measurements

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS, FAB) were recorded using a Bruker solariX mass spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization with time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Biosystems, Houston, TX). Absorption spectra were measured on a Dyanmica DB-20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were conducted using a BioLogic SP-150 apparatus operated at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with a conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a platinum working electrode, auxiliary electrodes and a non-aqueous Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) were recorded using a PerkinElmer DSC6000 Instruments apparatus operated at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an N2 atmosphere. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA Instruments SDT 2960 Simultaneous DTA-TGA. The samples (3–5 mg) were subjected to heating at a rate of 15 °C min−1 under a flow of N2. The theoretical calculations for the ground states of the TPE-based hole-transporting layer were carried out with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Surface images were recorded through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using a JEOL JSM 6701G microscope. The morphologies of the films were analyzed through atomic force microscopy (AFM) using a Bruker Dimension Edge microscope operated in the dynamic force mode at ambient temperature. The Si photomultiplier sensor exhibited a resonance frequency of 160 kHz and a force constant of 7.4 N m−1. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray spectroscopy (GIWAXS) was performed using a Philips PANalytical-X′PertPROMRD instrument. TRPL spectra were recorded using a time-correlated single photon counting spectrometer (WELLS-001 FX, DongWoo Optron). The contact angles of the films were measured using a First Ten Angstroms/FTA-1000B apparatus. XPS was performed using a ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 Versaprobe II spectrometer and a monochromatic Al Kα source. WFs were calculated using an incident light energy of 21.2 eV [He(i) emission]. The samples were biased at −5 V dc to drive low-energy secondary electrons into the detector. The cell performance was measured inside a glove box. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) and photocurrent–time (J–T) properties of the PSCs were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and a Peccell solar simulator under AM 1.5G illumination (1000 W m−2). EQEs were measured using an Enlitech QE-R spectral response measurement system to calibrate the current densities of the devices. The illumination intensity was calibrated using a standard Si reference cell and KG-5 filter. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of all devices were measured with an electrochemical workstation (IM 6, Zahner, Germany). The EIS measurement was performed in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz with ac amplitude 200 mV under illumination, which was calibrated to the same light intensity as AM 1.5G. The EIS curves were fitted with the Z-view software (version 3.4e) based on the electronic circuit model.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The synthetic routes for the target compounds CL-1–3 are outlined in Scheme 1. Three diarylamine intermediates (2–4) were prepared with p-anisidine, and the corresponding aromatic bromide through the Buchwald–Hartwig C–N cross-coupling reaction. Subsequently, compounds CL-1–3 were obtained through the facile reaction between 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)ethylene (1) and different arylamines (2–4) under similar C–N cross-coupling reactions, respectively. The chemical structures of CL-1–3 are shown in Fig. 1. These products were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, HRMS and elemental analysis. The results indicate the accuracy of the molecular structure. The corresponding spectra are presented in the Experimental section and ESI.†

3.2 Photo-physical and electrochemical properties
The optical absorption spectra of CL-1–3 in CH2Cl2 are displayed in Fig. 2a and the related data are collected in Table 1. In the range of 300–500 nm, compound CL-1 has three prominent adsorption bands, while the others have two prominent adsorption bands. The strong absorption band at a shorter wavelength for these three compounds is attributed to the localized π–π* transition in the TPE core and arylamines. The long wavelength absorptions at >400 nm are from the more delocalized π–π* transition with charge-transfer character. Compound CL-3 had a more red-shifted and larger molar extinction coefficient than the others due to the presence of the extended conjugation pyrene unit in its periphery.53 The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the three TPE derivatives are shown in Fig. 2b. Under an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, compounds CL-1 and CL-2 showed a blue emission in CH2Cl2 with the maximum band at around 482 and 467 nm, respectively, whereas CL-3 exhibited the maximum band at around 528 nm. The PL spectra of CL-3 exhibited red-shifted emission peaks, concomitant with the increase in conjugation length. On the other hand, CL-2 showed a shorter emission peak due to its twisted conformation (see the computation part). Furthermore, the optical bandgap (Eg) was determined from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra. The Eg values were determined to be 2.84, 2.87, and 2.61 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of the HTMs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Table 1 summarizes the relevant data and energy levels and Fig. 2c displays the corresponding cyclic voltammograms. The redox potentials of these HTMs were measured in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of CL-1–3 were estimated to be −5.40, −5.44, and −5.39 eV, respectively. The HOMO energy level of CL-3 was very close to that of the perovskite layer (−5.4 eV).54 On the other hand, the HOMO energy level of CL-2 was deeper than that of the perovskite layer, suggesting unfavorable energetics for hole transfer from the perovskite to this HTL. However, a good current density was achieved for the CL-2-based device (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, the energy level at the film state and other factors cannot be ruled out. We then calculated the LUMO energy levels of the CL-1–3 samples from their HOMOs and energy band gaps (Eg). The LUMO energy levels of CL-1, CL-2 and CL-3 were −2.56, −2.57, and −2.78 eV, respectively. Thus, all the values are higher than the LUMO energy level of the perovskite (−3.9 eV),54 suggesting suitable blocking of electrons from the perovskite to the HTLs.
3.3 Theoretical approach
The theoretical calculations for the ground states of the TPE-based hole-transporting layer were carried out with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The corresponding dihedral angles and molecular orbital are shown in Fig. 3. In addition, Table 2 shows the calculation of the lower-lying transitions of the HTMs. As expected, the TPE core for all the compounds showed smaller dihedral angles than the of spiro-OMeTAD (89.94°)55 due to the CC linkage of the TPE core. The dihedral angles of the TPE core were 46.73°, 49.71°, 49.66° and 47.36° for CL-1; 53.45°, 43.03°, 44.50° and 52.84° for CL-2; and 46.51°, 51.34°, 50.58° and 46.60° for CL-3. The electron distribution of the HOMO was mainly from the core to diarylamine. However, due to the large steric effect, especially for compounds CL-2 and CL-3, the electron density of compound CL-1 was more extend compared to that of CL-2 and CL-3. In the same observation, the LUMOs also varied due to the incorporation of different diarylamine units. Furthermore, the calculated band gap energies (Eg) ranged from 2.38 to 2.77 eV. Compound CL-3 showed the lowest Eg, which is consistent with the UV-vis data.

3.4 Thermal properties
The thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), where both testing methods were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 15 °C min−1 and 10 °C min−1, respectively. The corresponding results are illustrated in Fig. 4 and Table 1. The 5% weight loss temperature (Td) of compounds CL-1–3 under an N2 atmosphere was 420 °C, 427 °C, and 473 °C, respectively. As expected, the Td value of CL-3 is the highest among them owing to the high rigidity and bulkiness of the pyrene ring.56 In addition, they all left higher than 40% char yield at 800 °C under nitrogen. All the synthesized compounds showed comparable or better thermal stability than that of the commercial HTM, spiro-OMeTAD (Td = 417 °C), indicating their good thermal stability to meet the requirements for PSC devices.57
 Fig. 4  (a) TGA and (b) DSC curves of CL-1–3 recorded under a nitrogen atmosphere. 
The Tg values of CL-1–3 were in the range of 112–192 °C, depending on the substituted arylamines. The Tg value increases in the order of CL-1 (112 °C) > CL-2 (128 °C) > CL-3 (192 °C). The pyrene-based arylamine (CL-3) exhibited the highest Tg among the compounds because its bulkier pyrene substituents hamper the intramolecular rotations of the molecules.58 In addition, this Tg value is distinctively higher than that most of organic HTMs, including spiro-OMeTAD (124°C).57 Importantly, the higher Tg can effectively reduce the crystallization tendency, thus improving the morphological stability of the film with good long-term device stability.
3.5 Characterizations
We first fabricated p–i–n PSCs having the structure of ITO/CL-1–3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, with CL-1–3 as the HTMs. We observed that although the CL-1 HTM had a suitable energy level, its thin film layer was destroyed after spin-coating the perovskite solution. Hence, this device resulted in leakage current behavior with a quite low PCE value. On the other hand, the PSCs incorporating CL-2 and CL-3 as HTLs in the inverted configuration provided PCEs of 14.01% and 12.46%, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The CL-2-based device exhibited a slightly higher current density and FF value, resulting in an enhanced cell performance. According to previous work, an organic HTM as the interlayer between NiOx and the perovskite can tailor the energy level alignment at the p–i interface and control the growth of the perovskite.48,59,60 Therefore, an inorganic/organic (NiOx/CL-2 or CL-3) bilayer as the HTL was fabricated with the device configuration of ITO/NiOx/CL-2 or CL-3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag (see below). Therefore, we conducted the corresponding charge dissociation and charge transport processes to realize the NiOx only and bilayer HTLs-based devices. Fig. 5a displays the surface morphology of the selected HTLs (NiOx only and NiOx/CL-3) on ITO glass through tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The Ra (root-mean-square roughness) value of the spin-coated films was 3.16 and 1.99 nm for NiOx only and NiOx/CL-3, respectively. The film spin-coated with the bilayer HTL configuration showed a smaller Ra value, which indicates its smoother surface and more homogeneous nature than the control NiOx film. The smoother surface of the NiOx/CL-3 bilayer HTL is beneficial for charge transfer at the interface. Therefore, larger FF and elevated Jsc values could be achieved.61Fig. 5b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films without (NiOx only) and with the organic HTM as interlayers (NiOx/CL-2 or NiOx/CL-3). Based on this observation, the films with organic HTMs showed a slightly larger grain size compared to that of the control film (see XRD results below). In addition, the cross-section of the SEM images was around 500 nm thick for the perovskite films (Fig. 5c). They all displayed a highly crystalline perovskite layer with a single grain throughout the thickness of the film.

We also measured the UV-vis spectra, PL spectra, TRPL spectra, and XRD patterns of the perovskite films based on the NiOx only and bilayer (NiOx/CL-2/3) HTLs (Fig. 6). To evaluate the light penetration properties, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy for these perovskite thin films based on different HTLs was performed (Fig. 6a). Because the organic HTM films were only 10 nm thick, the bilayer HTL-based sample exhibited a similar absorbance in the range of 400–800 nm to that of the NiOx only-based control film. This implies that when the CL series organic HTLs are introduced, they did not affect the overall light harvesting of the perovskite. Fig. 6b shows the PL spectra of the perovskite films deposited on NiOx only, NiO/CL-2 and NiO/CL-3 HTLs. Interestingly, there was a quenching effect for the carriers by adding the CL-2 or CL-3 interlayer. In addition, NiO/CL-3 exhibited the lowest PL intensity. This significant quenching behavior can improve the interface charge transfer of the device.62 Moreover, we performed TRPL measurements on these samples to investigate the carrier lifetimes of the perovskites. The corresponding curves and fitting curves are displayed in Fig. 6c. In addition, we calculated the values of τaverage from the fractions of the fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) times63 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The τaverage for the fitted PL decay time on the NiOx-based perovskite film is about 38.7 ns, whereas the decay time of perovskite film on the bilayer NiOx/CL-2 and NiOx/CL-3 decreased to 35.6 and 34.1 ns, respectively. The reduced PL decay time of the NiOx/CL-3-based sample indicates a decrease in the carrier recombination, suggesting that this device has more sufficient hole extraction ability. The XRD spectra of the perovskite films prepared by NiOx only or NiOx/CL-2/-3 as the HTLs are shown in Fig. 6d. All the perovskite films displayed XRD diffraction peaks located at 14.1°, 28.5°, 31.9°, 40.6°, and 43.2°, which are assigned to the (110), (220), (310), (224), and (314) planes, respectively, confirming the formation of a perovskite tetragonal structure. In addition, all the films showed similar XRD patterns, which indicated complete crystallization of the perovskite films. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these peaks (110) were also measured and the results are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). According to the Debye–Scherrer equation τ = kλ/Bcosθ,64 the grain size, τ, was calculated to be 21.74, 21.77, and 21.92 nm for the NiOx only, NiOx/CL-2, and NiOx/CL-3 HTLs, respectively. Therefore, the NiOx/CL-3-based device showed the largest average crystallite size.

3.6 Photovoltaic properties
We then fabricated p–i–n PSCs to investigate the cell performance. Bilayer HTLs (NiOx/CL-2 or CL-3) were fabricated with the device configuration of ITO/NiOx/CL-2/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag and ITO/NiOx/CL-3/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, respectively (Fig. 7a). Their corresponding energy levels are also shown in Fig. 7b. In addition, a reference cell, ITO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, was also fabricated for comparison. Fig. 8a and Table 3 present the J–V curves and device performance. The standard derivation of the device performance was calculated from ten individual devices. For the reference cell (NiOx only) device, it exhibits a PCE of 17.79 ± 0.53%, with Jsc, Voc and FF of 21.23 ± 0.37 mA cm−2, 1.11 ± 0.01 V and 76.08 ± 2.03%, respectively. In comparison, we observed an increase in the PCE values of the NiOx/CL-2 (18.83 ± 0.38%) and NiOx/CL-3 (19.67 ± 0.32%)-based cells. In addition, the NiOx/CL-3-based device exhibited a champion efficiency of 20.15%. It is interesting to note that for the organic single-layer devices, the PCE of the CL-2-based device was higher than that of the CL-3-based device. On the other hand, the opposite result was observed for the corresponding bilayer HTL devices. Specifically, the NiOx/CL-3-based device exhibited a better cell performance. This indicates that CL-3 is an interface layer that can effectively improve the efficiency. The cell enhancement of the NiOx/CL-3-based device compared to the reference device is mainly because of the increase in Jsc and FF parameters, and the slight increment in Voc. The enhancement of Jsc and FF is because of the relatively larger perovskite crystal grain size, smoother morphology and better carrier extraction efficiency (from PL and TRPL, EIS measurement). In addition, for the Voc value, the NiOx/CL-3-based device exhibited a slightly improved value compared to that of the reference cell. This may be due to the more matched energy level between the HTL and perovskite film (see below UPS observation). The hysteresis of the NiOx/CL-3-based device was measured, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8a. This bilayer-based device exhibited the J–V curves and PCEs of forward at 20.15% and reverse at 18.28%, implying that this device displayed an acceptable hysteresis result.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the champion NiOx/CL-3-based and NiOx-based cells are presented in Fig. 8b. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectra match the trend observed from the J–V measurement. Although the absorbance spectra in Fig. 6a display that both films have comparable light absorption, the reflection properties between the ITO/HTL or the HTL/PSC interfaces cannot be ruled out.65 In addition, the NiOx/CL-3-based device also exhibited an improvement in film quality and interface at the HTL (Fig. 5).65,66 Consequently, the NiOx/CL-3-based device showed a slightly higher EQE in the range of 450 to 750 nm compared to the reference NiOx-based cell. Therefore, the NiOx/CL-3-based device achieved a higher current density.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is another suitable indicator of the charge transport process and internal resistance of perovskites using different HTLs.67Fig. 8c shows the corresponding Nyquist plots, fitting curves and electrical equivalent circuit diagram for the cells under AM 1.5G irradiation in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The fitting parameters are also summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). Based on the fitting results, Rs represents the series resistance of the ITO substrate. On the other hand, the semicircle in the high-frequency region is associated with the charge transport resistance (Rp). In addition, the CPE-T value is dominated by the geometric capacitance and contains components from the contact layers responding in the high-frequency domain.68 The Rp values for NiOx and NiOx/CL-3 are 467 and 265 Ω, respectively. The NiOx/CL-3-based device showed relatively lower charge-transfer resistance, indicating sufficient charge transfer within its perovskite layers than that within the reference device. This observation is consistent with the TRPL and morphology results mentioned above.
Moreover, the surface wettability of the control, single and bilayer HTLs was also determined. Table S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 7 display the surface energies of various HTLs coated onto ITO glass. The water contact angles of the single organic HTLs CL-2 and CL-3 were 73.58° and 72.90°, respectively, which were larger than that of the NiOx-based film (11.45°). In addition, the contact angles of the bilayer HTLs NiOx/CL-2 and NiOx/CL-3 were 13.37° and 20.51°, respectively. The values of γtotal for the NiOx, NiOx/CL-2 and NiOx/CL-3 films were 85.27, 83.06 and 80.92 mN m−1, respectively. When the CL series was introduced, a significant decrease in the surface energy was observed. The surface energy may have affected the perovskite morphology deposited on the top of the HTLs.69 We then expected that the greater hydrophobicity of the organic HTLs would affect the deposition and growth of the perovskite from solution, and thus its morphology. Accordingly, better device stability would be expected. Since device stability is in high demand and necessary for industrial application, we then studied the long-term stability based on NiOx/CL-3 as HTLs under argon and air storage conditions. The corresponding curves are shown in Fig. 8d. After storage for more than 20 days, the PCE of the inverted PSC based on NiOx/CL-3 as the HTLs retains 80.8% (Ar) and 70.4% (air) of its initial efficiency. In addition, the reverse and forward scan also exhibited very close PCE values, proving that this device has acceptable long-term stability. Perovskite materials are easily decomposed under sunlight, especially UV light, which increases the charge recombination.70–72 Therefore, we measured Jsc as function of time under AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination for the NiOx and NiOx/CL-3 HTMs (Fig. 8e). The photocurrent of the NiOx and NiOx/CL-3-based devices remained steady within 120 s exposure to illumination. This indicates that the addition of the CL-3 interface layer has an insignificant effect on the stability.
We also performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for the NiOx and NiOx/CL-3 films to further investigate the effect of the additional organic HTLs. The curves are displayed in Fig. 8f and g. According to the calculation,73 when adding CL-3 was added to NiOx as HTLs, the HOMO level (valence band) (5.12 eV) became deeper compared to that of pure NiOx (5.08 eV). This result demonstrates that the HOMO of the NiOx/CL-3 film is much closer to the valence band of the perovskite film. Thus, it results in better charge transfer from the perovskite film to the HTL. Consequently, the NiOx/CL-3-based device showed an increase in Voc value.59
4. Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized three HTMs (CL-1–3), containing a TPE entity as the core and various fused-ring-terminated diarylamines as the electron donating groups for inverted perovskite solar cells. Compound CL-3 exhibited a very high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 192 °C. We then fabricated inverted cells using inorganic/organic bilayer HTMs (NiOx/CL) as the HTL and compared them with the NiOx-only device. Due to the increase in Jsc and FF parameters, and the slight increment in Voc, the NiOx/CL-3-based device exhibited the champion cell performance of 20.15%, which is higher than that of the NiOx-based device (PCE = 18.66%). In addition, this device also exhibited greater hydrophobicity and acceptable long-term stability. We believe that the synthesis of various fused-ring-terminated HTMs via molecular engineering is useful for researchers and industrial applications.
