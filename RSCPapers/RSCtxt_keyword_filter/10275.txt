    , Accepted 3rd December 2020First published on 15th December 2020AbstractPorphyrin and its derivatives play important roles in natural energy conversion applications. In this work, we designed and synthesized three novel acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecules (namely Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF) with the Cu(II)-porphyrin as the central electron-donating core and fluorinated 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the electron-withdrawing end groups. These new molecules show broad absorption spectra from 300 to 900 nm with strong intramolecular charge transfer absorption spectra at around 800 nm, and an optical bandgap of about 1.4 eV. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on these new molecules as non-fullerene electron acceptors achieved power conversion efficiencies from 0.5% to 2.44%. The OSCs were characterized by several techniques, including density functional theory (DFT), space-charge limited current (SCLC), photoluminescence spectra (PL) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). These results demonstrate a systematic study of Cu(II)-porphyrin molecules, which could be used to design molecules for use in organic electronics.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as promising green energy alternatives for solar energy collection due to their unique advantages of mechanical flexibility, light weight, and short energy payback time, and low-cost roll-to-roll coating techniques.1–4 The active layer materials, consisting of donor and acceptor materials, are very important to realize high performance in OSCs. For the electron-accepting material component, fullerene and its derivatives (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM) have been widely used as electron acceptors in OSCs for a long period due to their high electron affinities, high electron transport capacities, and isotropic charge transport in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells.5–9 However, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been limited at around 11% due to limitations of their low absorption coefficients in the visible light region, high costs of synthesis and purification, strong aggregation etc.10–15 In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted extensive interest due to their promising characteristics, such as facile accessibility, better absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions, and easily tunable energy levels.16–20 In particular, small-molecule NFAs, which possess well-defined molecular structures, molecular weights, and small batch-to-batch variations, have been extensively investigated in OSCs and the PCEs of devices based on these NFAs have been improved to over 16%.21–32
Porphyrins and their derivatives are widely distributed in nature, and they play important roles in natural photosynthetic systems via absorbing photons from sunlight and storing the light energy.33 Porphyrins with eighteen delocalized π-electrons have been utilized as semiconductors in organic electronics due to their strong absorption of solar flux, good thermal stability and tunable photophysical and electro-chemical properties via substituent variation at their periphery and/or insertion of metal into the cavity.34–36 Moreover, the absorption of porphyrins, which mainly lies in both blue (strong Soret bands) and red (moderate Q bands) parts of the visible spectrum, can be easily extended into the near-infrared (NIR) region by employing donor–acceptor (D–A) design.37–43 In recent years, porphyrin and its derivatives have been widely used in the construction of donor materials in OSCs due to their advantages and obtained promising PCEs over 9%.12,40,44 However, porphyrin-based photoactive materials for use as electron acceptors remain rarely reported.
In previous work on porphyrin-based small molecule NFAs, the Li group and Jang group have successfully developed several new porphyrin-based electron acceptors with two effective electron withdrawing moieties, perylene diimide and naphthalene diimide, which were substituted onto the porphyrin unit due to their strong n-type characteristics, and promising PCEs of 5.34–8.15% were obtained.45–47 These results demonstrated that porphyrin has great potential for building novel NFAs to achieve high-performance OSCs. However, these porphyrin-based acceptors exhibited a relatively weak intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect (the Soret band is much stronger than the Q-band), indicating that the π-electron delocalization over the molecules is insufficient. In the reported literature, much work has been devoted to enhance the ICT effect of A–D–A-type small molecule acceptors by introducing powerful electron-deficient moieties, such as 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) and its derivatives, as the electron-accepting terminal groups.48–50 Thus, the ICT effect of the porphyrin-based acceptors could also be enhanced through introduction of electron-deficient moieties as the end groups. Very recently, Wang et al. reported a structure Por4IC, which consists of zinc(II) porphyrin as the core and INCN as the end group. The compound showed a strong ICT effect and is used as an optical sensitizer in photomultiplication type organic photodetectors, which demonstrated that the INCN group can effectively enhance the ICT effect of porphyrin-based molecules.51 Porphyrin derivatives with copper as the central metal atom have been successfully used as the cathode interlayer.52 However, to our knowledge, the use of Cu(II)-porphyrin-based materials as NFAs in OSCs is rarely reported. Thus, the construction of Cu(II)-porphyrin-based acceptors not only can diversify the NFA family, but is also of vital importance to develop novel NFAs for high performance OSCs.
In this context, we designed and synthesized three novel A–D–A-type NFAs, Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF, which incorporate strong electron-withdrawing moiety INCN and its derivatives as the end-groups and Cu(II)-porphyrin as the electron-donating core unit. The intramolecular push–pull effect between the central Cu(II)-porphyrin unit and the terminal acceptor unit enables broad absorption from 300 to 900 nm, strong ICT absorption spectra at around 800 nm, and an optical bandgap of about 1.4 eV. OSCs fabricated using PBDB-T as the electron-donating polymer and Por-Cu-IC or Por-Cu-ICF or Por-Cu-ICFF as the acceptor exhibited PCEs varying from 0.56% to 2.44%. Several techniques, such as space-charge limited current (SCLC), density functional theory (DFT), photoluminescence spectra (PL) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were performed to study the structure–performance relations. These results indicate that there is great potential for Cu(II)-porphyrin-based conjugated materials to be used as electron acceptors in high-performance OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
All the reactions were carried out under the protection of an argon atmosphere. All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used directly without further purification unless otherwise specified. Solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene, were dried with sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled before use. Por-Br was synthesized according to the reported literature.40,53 The molecular structures of the three NFAs and their synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthesis procedures are described as follows.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of Cu(II)-porphyrin-based NFAs. 

Compound Por-Cu-Br. 
In a dried two-necked 150 mL round bottom flask, compound Por-Br (597 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in CHCl3 (50 mL) and then a solution of Cu(OAc)2 (300 mg, 1.5 mmol) in methanol (12 mL) was added. The mixture was purged with argon for 30 min and then stirred at 80 °C for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was washed with water and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removing the solvent from the filtrate under vacuum, the crude product was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel employing dichloromethane/petroleum ether (1:1) as an eluent and then recrystallized from CHCl3/methanol to give Por-Cu-Br as a purple solid with a 95% yield.

Compound Por-Cu-CHO. 
To a 100 mL two-necked round bottom flask, Por-Cu-Br (590 mg, 0.4 mmol) and 5-ethynyl-4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (3) (500 mg, 1.2 mmol) were dissolved in THF (30 mL). The mixture was purged with argon for 0.5 h. Then Pd(PPh3)4 (66 mg) and CuI (10.9 mg) were added. After stirring for a while, triethylamine (15 mL) was added via a syringe and the reaction was stirred at 70 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, and then the residue was purified by flash chromatography with dichloromethane/petroleum ether (2:1) as an eluent and then recrystallized from CHCl3/methanol to give Por-Cu-CHO as a light green solid with a 75% yield.

Compound of Por-Cu-IC. 

Por-Cu-CHO (150 mg, 0.08 mmol), INCN (47 mg, 0.24 mmol), and chloroform (30 mL) were added to a two-necked round bottomed flask. The mixture was deoxygenated with argon for 0.5 h, pyridine (0.5 mL) was added via a syringe and then stirred at 65 °C overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed under vacuum and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using dichloromethane as an eluent. The product was further recrystallized from chloroform/methanol to afford Por-Cu-IC as a dark green solid with a 65% yield. MS (MALDI-TOF) calcd for C146H188CuN8O2S4, 2276.304; found, 2277.559.

General instruments
MS (MALDI-TOF) spectra were conducted on a Bruker Agilent1290/maxis spectrometer. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation equipped with a platinum wire counter electrode, and a platinum electrode as a working electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 against an Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode under an argon atmosphere. A 0.1 M acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte, and the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+) was used to calibrate the potential of the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode and its onset potential was measured to be 0.37 V. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated according to the onsets of oxidation (Eonsetox) and reduction (Eonsetred) potentials by the following equations: EHOMO = −e(Eonsetox − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = −e(Eonsetref − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8) eV, where Eonsetox and Eonsetred are the onsets of oxidation and reduction, respectively. Thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses were measured on a NETZSCH TG 209 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The geometrical and electronic structures of the NFAs were investigated by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. The optical absorption behaviours of NFAs were studied by the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) method. Considering the balance between accuracy and time expenditure on a supercomputer (Tianhe II of National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou), the branched side chains were replaced with isopropyl groups during the calculation. The atom force microscopy (AFM) experiments were measured on a NanoMan VS microscope with a tapping mode.
Device fabrication and characterization
All the organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag, and poly[(9,9-bis(3-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN-Br) was used as the efficient interfacial layer to facilitate electron extraction from the active layer.54 Firstly, the ITO-coated glass substrates were pre-cleaned sequentially with deionized water, ethanol, acetone, and isopropanol under sonication and each process was approximately 20 min, and then dried in an oven at 70 °C for 12 h before use. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of the above ITO glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed in air at 150 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred into a N2-protected glove box for spin-coating the active layer. The polymer PBDB-T and NFAs were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) solution (with varied blend ratios, the total concentration of the acceptor and the donor polymer is 10 mg mL−1). The blend solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1800 rpm for 60 s to form the active layer with a thickness of approximately 100 nm. Finally, PFN-Br in methanol (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the blended films as the interface layer (approximately 5 nm), and then a silver electrode (100 nm) was thermally deposited onto the interlayer PFN-Br through a shadow mask at a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar. During the test, the device with an area of 0.04 cm2 was used. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Taiwan, Enlitech SS-F5) with an irradiation light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 which was tested using a calibrated silicon solar cell (certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) before the test. The EQE spectra and PL spectra were measured on a commercial EQE measurement system (Taiwan, Enlitech, QE-R) and a FLS920 spectro-fluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments), respectively.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The detailed synthetic routes of the three NFAs, Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF, are shown in Scheme 1. Compound Por was synthesized by using dipyrromethane (2) as the starting material. The intermediate compounds Por-Br and Por-Cu-Br were obtained according to the reported literature.40 Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling is performed between Por-Cu-Br and compound (3) to produce compound Por-Cu-CHO. By treating Por-Cu-CHO with the electron-withdrawing moiety INCN or its derivatives via a Knoevenagel condensation, the target NFAs were obtained with yields from 55% to 65%. It is worth noting that the Cu(II)-porphyrin based molecules can’t be characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy due to the paramagnetic properties of Cu2+.55–57 All the above materials were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and elemental analysis (Fig. S6–S9, ESI†). All these NFAs showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene, which is beneficial for the preparation of uniform and smooth films. The thermal stability of these NFAs was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere, and they show good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td, at 5% weight loss) of 330 °C, 354 °C and 349 °C for Por-Cu-IC or Por-Cu-ICF or Por-Cu-ICFF, respectively (Fig. S1a, ESI†). As investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement from 40 to 250 °C, there are no obvious thermal transition characteristics for all the NFAs (Fig. S1b, ESI†), indicating that they are amorphous molecules.
Theoretical investigation of geometrical and electronic structures
The geometrical and electronic structures of Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF, and Por-Cu-ICFF were theoretically investigated with the density functional theory (DFT) method.51 The CAM-B3LYP functional was adopted for the optimization and frequency calculations under vacuum. The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was adopted for C, H, O, N, and S elements, while SDD basis set/pseudo potential was used for Cu element. The optimized molecular geometry of Por-Cu-ICFF is shown in the lower right corner of Fig. 1a. Similar figures for Por-Cu-IC and Por-Cu-ICF are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†). It could be found that all three NFAs are quite planar structures, which could facilitate π-electron delocalization and enhance charge mobility. Moreover, the dihedral angles (−4.2°, −3.5°, and −3.6° between the porphyrin core and thiophene for Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF, respectively) are nearly not changed along with the end group changes. The total densities of states (TDOS) of alpha and beta spin of Por-Cu-ICFF, along with the partial DOSs (PDOS) of two fragments in Por-Cu-ICFF, are shown in Fig. 1a. TDOS and PDOS of other two NFAs are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†). The definitions of the two fragments are shown with different colors (red for Frag. 1 and green for Frag. 2) in the lower right corner of each figure. It could be found from the TDOS that the contribution of Frag. 1 is lower than that of Frag. 2 at low and high energy fields. However, the contribution of Frag. 1 becomes larger than that of Frag. 2 near the HOMO for both alpha and beta spins. Moreover, the spin polarization of three NFAs is slight. Consequently, only alpha spins were considered in the following discussion. As shown in Fig. 1b, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is mainly distributed along the conjugated cores, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is well delocalized over the entire backbone. We also gave the distributions of HOMO−1, HOMO−2, LUMO+1, and LUMO+3 in Fig. 1b, which is helpful for the understanding of optical absorption behaviour of Por-Cu-ICFF. The charge density at the end group is enhanced along with the increasing numbers of F atoms on the terminal unit, which favors enhanced electron transport and intermolecular interactions.58 The introduction of the electron-withdrawing unit F atoms onto the end group not only decreases the LUMO levels, which might be beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation (when paired with suitable donor materials),59 but also maintain the planarity of the entire conjugated backbones.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2a and b display the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of these NFAs and the donor polymer in chloroform solution and as thin films. All the NFAs showed broad absorption in the range of 300–900 nm consisting of a Soret band (400–620 nm) and Q-band (620–900 nm). The much stronger oscillator strength for the Q-band of the Cu(II)-porphyrin core than that of the Soret-band can be ascribed to the efficient ICT interaction between the central porphyrin core and terminal electron-accepting units.40 The absorption peaks of Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF in solution are red-shifted (by 9 nm and 17 nm, respectively) compared to that of Por-Cu-IC due to the improved electron-deficient property of fluorinated IC groups. The absorption coefficients of Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF are 1.16 × 105 M−1 cm−1, 1.33 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 1.61 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 737 nm, 746 nm and 754 nm, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition, the absorption spectra of Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF as thin films are much red-shifted by 51 nm, 44 nm, and 50 nm, respectively, compared to those in their solution spectra, indicating the strong π–π intermolecular interactions in thin films. Based on the TDDFT calculation results, the optical absorption of Por-Cu-ICFF is dominated by the transitions HOMO → LUMO, HOMO−1 → LUMO+3, and HOMO−1 → HOMO. All these NFAs exhibit broadened and intensified Q-band absorption that is highly beneficial for NIR light harvesting. The optical bandgaps of Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF calculated according to the absorption edges of the thin films (Table S1, ESI†) are 1.44, 1.41 and 1.38 eV, respectively. The narrowed bandgap and higher absorption coefficients of Por-Cu-ICFF in films (compared to Por-Cu-IC and Por-Cu-ICF, Table S1, ESI†) are beneficial for extended photon-to-current-conversion, which can improve the short-circuit current (JSC) of devices.48

The frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the three NFAs were evaluated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the reference (Fig. 2c). As shown in Fig. 2d, the HOMO/LUMO levels of Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF are −5.64/−3.55, −5.72/−3.68 and −5.79/−3.79 eV, respectively. Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF exhibit successively down-shifted LUMO levels compared to Por-Cu-IC because of the strong electron-withdrawing capability of the F atoms. The LUMO offsets between PBDB-T and Por-Cu-IC or Por-Cu-ICF or Por-Cu-ICFF are 0.06, 0.19 and 0.3 eV, respectively. The higher LUMO offset between PBDT-T and Por-Cu-ICFF is beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation.59
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the potential applications of Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF in OSCs as electron acceptors, OSCs were fabricated in a conventional configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag. The wide bandgap polymer PBDB-T acted as the electron donor material because it exhibits absorption complementary to that of our porphyrin-based acceptors. The thickness of the photoactive layer is around 100 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The detailed optimization of the OSCs, including the effects of solvent additives and the donor/acceptor ratios, is summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).

The as-cast device based on PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICFF (1:1) exhibited a PCE of 1.79% (VOC = 0.76 V, JSC = 5.97 mA cm−2, FF = 39.27%) (Table S2, ESI†), while a slightly higher PCE of 2.44% (VOC = 0.79 V, JSC = 7.30 mA cm−2, FF = 42.37%) was achieved when 0.5% pyridine (Py) was used as additive. Under the same optimization conditions, the PCEs of the Por-Cu-ICF-based and Por-Cu-IC-based devices were reduced to 1.85% (VOC = 0.81 V, JSC = 5.03 mA cm−2, FF = 45.66%) and 0.52% (VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = 1.58 mA cm−2, FF = 39.81%), respectively, which are mainly due to the reduced JSC. The higher JSC of Por-Cu-ICFF-based devices can be ascribed to the higher absorption coefficient and better-matched absorption with PBDB-T. Compared to the Por-Cu-IC-based device, the low VOC values of the Por-Cu-ICF- and Por-Cu-ICFF-based devices can be attributed to their successively down-shifted LUMO energy levels (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the Por-Cu-ICFF-based device exhibits a relatively smaller energy loss (Eloss = Eg − eVOC) of 0.59 eV than Por-Cu-IC- and Por-Cu-ICF-based devices (0.62 and 0.60 eV, respectively), which is beneficial for achieving higher performance OSCs.60 These results indicated that the introduction of an F atom on the end-group is an efficient way to reduce the energy loss.
In order to enhance the photovoltaic performance, ternary organic solar cells were constructed by incorporating an additional component ITIC into the blend layer comprising PBDB-T and Por-Cu-ICFF. The PCEs were improved from 2.44% to 3.13% due to the complementary absorption of Por-Cu-ICFF and ITIC. The stability of the PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICFF blend devices was tested under illumination conditions in an ambient environment. From the evolution of photovoltaic performance shown in Table S4 (ESI†), we found the PCEs were reduced from 2.64% to 2.26% after 72 h continuous illumination in an ambient environment, which is indicative of the better stability of the PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICFF blend.
The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) cures of the studied devices based on PBDB-T and the three NFAs are shown in Fig. 3b. All the studied devices exhibited broad photo-response from 300 to 900 nm, and the maximum peaks for Por-Cu-IC-, Por-Cu-ICF- and Por-Cu-ICF-based systems are 7%, 19%, and 28% at 630, 560, and 790 nm, respectively. The EQE spectra are in good agreement with the absorption spectra of PBDB-T and the porphyrin-based NFAs (Fig. 2b), suggesting that both the NFAs and the polymer donor contribute to the photo-current. The EQE responses are consistent with the measured JSC values of the devices. The integrated photocurrents from EQE spectra were 1.48, 4.86 and 7.23 mA cm−2 for the PBDT-T:Por-Cu-IC, PBDT-T:Por-Cu-ICF and PBDT-T:Por-Cu-ICFF systems, respectively, which are very close to the values of 1.58, 5.03 and 7.30 mA cm−2 obtained from the J–V measurements. The enhanced EQE of the Por-Cu-ICFF-based device indicates the efficient charge transfer between PBDB-T and Por-Cu-ICFF, which is beneficial to generate a higher PCE in OSCs.59
To further understand the charge transfer between the NFAs and the polymer donor, we measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure PBDB-T and the optimized blend films, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The Por-Cu-ICFF-based blend film exhibited more pronounced PL quenching than the Por-Cu-ICF- and Por-Cu-IC-based blend films. This suggests that more effective photoinduced charge transfer occurred between PBDB-T and Por-Cu-ICFF in the blend films, which is beneficial for achieving a higher JSC in OSCs fabricated from these films. These results are in good agreement with the device data.
Charge carrier mobility
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to evaluate the charge carrier mobilities of the PBDB-T:Por-Cu-IC, PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICF and PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICFF blend films. The hole- and electron-only mobilities were investigated by using devices with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ film active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/Al/BHJ film/Ca/Al architectures, respectively. The current–voltage (J1/2–V) curves and the corresponding mobility parameters of these devices are shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3 (ESI†). Relative to the PBDB-T:Por-Cu-IC blend film (electron mobility, μe = 6.19 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; hole mobility, μh = 3.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh/μe = 60.7) and the PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICF blend film (μe = 8.34 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh = 3.29 × 10−4; μe/μh = 39.4), the PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICFF blend film possesses higher electron mobility (μe = 1.32 × 10−5) and a lower hole/electron ratio (μh = 2.85 × 10−4; μe/μh = 21.6). The more balanced hole/electron mobilities suppressed bimolecular recombination,61 which is consistent with the slightly enhanced current density for the Por-Cu-ICFF-based devices. These findings indicated that the introduction of an F atom on the end-group is an efficient way to improve the charge mobilities.

Morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to probe the morphology of the thin films of PBDB-T:Por-Cu-IC, PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICF and PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICFF, with the corresponding images shown in Fig. 5. All the films were prepared on top of PEDOT:PSS using the same fabrication methods. One can obviously note that all the films exhibited a relatively smooth surface profile with fine fibrous structures across the entire films, and the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughnesses of blend films based on PBDB-T:Por-Cu-IC, PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICF and PBDB-T:Por-Cu-ICFF are 1.97, 2.23 and 2.27 nm, respectively, implying that the introduce of an F atom on the end-group of the NFAs has trivial effects on the surface morphology of these blend films.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed three novel Cu(II)-porphyrin based small molecule NFAs, Por-Cu-IC, Por-Cu-ICF and Por-Cu-ICFF, for application in OSCs. All of the new acceptors exhibit good planarity, high absorption coefficient and broad absorptions from 300 to 900 nm with a strong ICT effect. OSCs based on these new non-fullerene acceptors and the polymer donor PBDB-T exhibited moderate photovoltaic performance, which may be due to the high steric hindrance of branched alkyl chains for intermolecular π–π interactions, low driving force, and unbalanced transport of holes and electrons. Although the PCEs are relatively low, the acquired knowledge in this study provides an effective way to develop near-infrared porphyrin-based acceptors with a strong ICT effect, and further rational molecular design on porphyrin-based electron acceptors might enable higher photovoltaic performance.
