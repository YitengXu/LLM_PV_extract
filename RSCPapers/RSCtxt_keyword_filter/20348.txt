    , Accepted 22nd May 2018First published on 24th May 2018AbstractKesterite (CZTSe) is a promising thin film photovoltaic absorber material due to its composition of more earth abundant materials compared to mature thin film photovoltaic technologies. Up to now, power conversion efficiencies are still lower and its main problem is the low open circuit voltage (Voc). Recently, a novel sintering approach using a nanometric Ge layer showed a large increase in device performance and especially in Voc. In this work, in-depth solar cell characterization as well as Raman and photoluminescence studies of devices employing different Ge doped CZTSe absorber layers is presented. The main focus is to reveal the beneficial effects of Ge doping and furthermore investigate the interaction of Ge and Na. For low Ge doping an increase in charge carrier concentration is observed, resulting in devices with a Voc of 460 mV, which corresponds to a Voc deficit (Eg/q − Voc) of 596 mV, a value comparable to current record devices. For high Ge amounts, admittance spectroscopy measurements identified the appearance of a deep defect which can explain the observed deterioration of solar cell performance. Additional Na provided during crystallization of high Ge doped devices can reduce the density of this deep defect and recover device performance. These results indicate that Na plays an important role in defect passivation and we propose a defect model based on the interaction of group IV elements and Na with Cu vacancies.
1. Introduction
Kesterites are quaternary semiconductor compounds based on Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se and/or S (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 – CZTSSe). In recent years, these materials have attracted more and more attention due to the similarity of their properties to the already more established Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) photovoltaic absorbers and a composition free of scarce elements like In and Ga. Currently the certified record efficiency of sulphur and selenium containing solid solution Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 based solar cells is 12.6% which is still much lower than the efficiencies of record CIGSe devices which recently surpassed 22%.1,2 One of the main challenges so far for kesterite solar cells is their low open circuit voltage. The Voc depends on the bandgap of the absorber and can be reduced due to recombination.3 Therefore, to compare absorbers with different bandgaps a so called Voc deficit is introduced, which is defined as Voc-def = Eg/q − Voc. Record kesterite devices hardly overcome a Voc deficit of 0.6 V, whereas record CIGSe devices show Voc deficits below 0.4 V.1,2 The reasons for this lack of Voc are currently being intensively investigated. Besides the occurrence of detrimental secondary phases different possible explanations were proposed.
Enhanced interface recombination was proposed as one reason.4–7 It could be linked to a cliff-like band alignment observed for high bandgaps, i.e. sulphur rich kesterite absorbers and the CdS buffer layer.8,9 However, for a low bandgap, i.e. selenium rich kesterite this is not the case.9–12 For sulphur pure absorbers, Voc losses due to recombination at the interface can be overcome by employing alternative buffer layers other than CdS with better band alignment.13,14 Therefore, interface recombination cannot be the main cause for the high Voc loss.
A low minority carrier lifetime was suggested as a further reason for Voc loss; however theoretical device simulation shows that low minority carrier lifetime alone does not account for all Voc loss.7,15
Furthermore, the presence of tail states was proposed as a reason for low Voc values.7,16,17 Tail states are non-zero density of states located at the bandgap edges, which reduces the optical bandgap to a so-called mobility gap. Band tails are evidenced by the fact that the maximum of the peak of the photoluminescence measurements of kesterite samples is usually noticeably red-shifted compared to the optical bandgap which can be explained by band tails, as band-tail to band-tail transitions are observed.7,11,16 Furthermore, a slow decay of the IQE signal below the bandgap which is frequently observed in kesterite devices is another indication of sub-bandgap absorption.7,18 Electrostatic potential fluctuations or bandgap fluctuations are proposed to be responsible for this non-zero density of states within the bandgap.7 The origins of electrostatic potential fluctuation are charged defects whereas bandgap fluctuations can be explained by local inhomogeneities in the absorber layer, like a non-uniform composition, ordered/disordered domains or secondary phases.7,17 Tail states can be quantified by the Urbach Energy Eu because sub-bandgap absorption can be described by .19 De Wolf et al.20 showed for different photovoltaic materials a linear relationship between Urbach energy and the Voc deficit, where the lowest Eu resulted in the lowest Voc deficit. Cu/Zn disorder in the kesterite lattice was suspected to be responsible for the tail states; however recent studies show that up to now no clear correlation between Cu/Zn ordering, tail states, and further Voc deficits has been found and the origins of the large tails are still not totally clear.11,17
Deep defects could be another reason for the reduced Voc values of kesterite solar cells. Larramona et al. showed that by careful control of the Sn content during synthesis, the formation of deep defects related to Sn vacancies/antisites could be avoided and the device performance improved.21 Wei et al. observed a deep donor defect which compensates the CZTSSe absorber and proposed that the deep defect together with a short carrier diffusion length could be responsible for high Voc deficit.22 Furthermore, trap-assisted tunnelling recombination is suggested as a possible reason for low voltage.18,23
Recently, a novel sintering approach using a nanometric Ge layer deposited onto metallic precursor stacks or nanocrystalline precursors prior to reactive annealing in a Se and Sn atmosphere showed a large increase in device performance and especially in Voc.24–26 Different to beneficial Ge alloying in kesterites reported previously,27–30 minimal quantities of Ge are observed in the final CZTSe absorber prepared using this Ge nanolayer approach.24–26
The goal of this work is to get a deeper insight into the beneficial effects of Ge doping on device performance. It is surprising that there is an optimum amount of Ge in the range of 5–15 nm that has to be added during synthesis of either metal stacks or nanocrystalline precursors to improve device performance. Higher Ge amounts added enhance grain growth significantly but are detrimental to cell performance.24,25,31 The purpose of this study is to shed light on the beneficial effects of Ge doping by defect spectroscopy as well as Raman and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Three different solar cell devices out of a series with different levels of Ge-doping are presented here in detail. The first one was synthesized without Ge addition (0 nm Ge). The second was synthesized with 10 nm Ge evaporated on top of the nanocrystalline precursor before a crystallization step, which corresponds to the range of optimal Ge doping. The third was obtained employing high Ge addition (50 nm Ge) during the crystallization step under a selenium atmosphere. Furthermore, the strong interaction of Ge and Na is demonstrated by investigating Ge and additionally Na doped absorbers.
2. Experimental details
First Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn metallic stacks deposited by DC magnetron sputtering onto Mo coated soda lime glass were selenized at a low temperature of 350 °C for 30 minutes under an Ar flow and keeping the pressure at 1.5 mbar to form a nanocrystalline precursor layer. On top of the precursors different thicknesses of Ge or NaF+Ge where thermally evaporated. Then the precursors with the different capping layers were annealed under a selenium atmosphere using a two-step profile, with a first step at 400 °C and Ar flux keeping the pressure at 1.5 mbar for 15 minutes, followed by a high temperature step at 550 °C and 1 bar for 15 minutes. A detailed description of the Ge doping process can be found in ref. 24. The solar cell devices were finished by depositing CdS buffer and an iZnO/ITO window layer as described in more detail in ref. 32. Post deposition annealing of the complete cell on a hotplate in air at a temperature below 250 °C was carried out to improve device performance.33
Solar cells were characterized measuring JV curves under illumination of a 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar spectrum from an Abet technology AAA solar simulator. Temperature dependent JV curves were recorded using a closed cycle He cryostat and an Oriel small area solar simulator calibrated to 1 sun with a Si reference cell.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed using a Bentham PVE300 system calibrated with Si and Ge photodiodes.
CV and Cf measurements at different temperatures (from 100 K to 320 K) were carried out using a liquid nitrogen cryostat from SemiMetrics Ltd and an Agilent E4980A LCR meter employing a parallel circuit model to extract the capacitance of the device.
Raman scattering (RS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using the iHR320 Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrometer coupled with CCD and InGaAs detectors. The first detector was used for RS and the second for PL spectra. A solid state laser with a 532 nm wavelength was used as the excitation source for both methods. Spectra were measured in a backscattering configuration through an Olympus metallographic objective and using the maximum laser power which ensured the absence of thermal effects on the samples. Laser power was changed by changing the current applied for the laser. Sample temperature was varied in the closed-cycle He cryostat and measured using a Si-diode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Electrical and Raman characterization
In Fig. 1 the JV curves of the three devices are shown and the device parameters are listed in Table 1. A clear improvement in Voc is observed for the 10 nm Ge device compared to the 0 nm Ge reference. For the 50 nm Ge device a decrease in Voc is observed. The bandgap was extracted from the quantum efficiency (QE) measurements by assuming collection just in the space charge region (SCR, W), and thus QE can be approximated by QE ≅ 1 − exp(−αW), where α is the absorption coefficient.34 The absorption coefficient is proportional to the bandgap of the absorber by35. Thus by plotting (ln(1 − QE))2vs. hν and linear fitting of the long wavelength (low energy part) one can obtain the bandgap as the intercept with the hν-axis (see Fig. 2(b)). The bandgap stays constant around 1.05 eV up to a Ge amount of 10 nm and increases for the 50 nm Ge case. This is expected for higher Ge incorporation into the lattice.36

Raman measurements confirm the low Ge incorporation into the CZTSe lattice for Ge amounts up to 10 nm, as is shown in Fig. 3. In the 0 nm Ge sample the position of all Raman peaks at room temperature (RT) corresponds to the ones published previously for CZTSe compounds37 and no peaks of secondary phases were found. The position of the most intense peak for the samples with 0 nm Ge and 10 nm of Ge is similar, whereas the position of this peak in the 50 nm Ge sample shifts about 1 cm−1 to higher wavenumbers. This indicates that in the last sample a Cu2ZnSnxGe1−xSe4 solid solution was formed with x ≈ 0.9,37 while in the sample with 10 nm of Ge almost no Ge was incorporated and Ge acts most possibly as a dopant. However, in the sample with 10 nm of Ge a small increase of the asymmetry of the most intense peak compared to the reference sample was observed. According to Valakh et al., this is related to an increase of disorder in the samples.38,39 With lowering the sample temperature a small blue shift of all Raman peaks was detected, which reached 2 cm−1 at 20 K. Note that the shift was independent of the Ge content which indicates that its inclusion in the lattice does not create any additional strains. The change of tensile lattice strain with temperature, which is responsible for the shift of Raman peaks, is similar for all the samples.

Since the bandgap stays constant up to 10 nm Ge while the Voc increases, the Voc deficit can be reduced to below 600 mV. The increase in Voc can therefore not be related to a bandgap increase due to Ge incorporation into the lattice36 and has to have different origins as will be discussed in the following. The efficiency follows the same trend. The highest efficiency of 8.6% is obtained for the lowest Voc deficit. In the literature, band tails were proposed as one of the main performance bottlenecks in kesterite based solar cells causing low Voc values.7,40 One can characterize band tails which are responsible for sub-bandgap absorption using the Urbach energy Eu. Below the bandgap the absorption coefficient can be approximated by  to extract Eu.19 In Fig. 5.3(c) ln(α) ∝ x/Euvs. (E − Eg) is shown for all devices with the Eu extracted by linear fitting. An Urbach energy of around 25 meV is obtained with no significant difference between the different devices. Furthermore, these band tails are responsible for a pronounced red-shift of the main peak of room temperature (RT) photoluminescence (PL) measurements compared to the optical bandgap.11,16,17 For all different Ge doped samples this red-shift is observed as can be seen in Fig. 2(b). Therefore, it can be concluded that Ge doping unfortunately does not modify band tails and reasons for efficiency improvements have to be different.
The diode parameters, like the series resistance, diode quality factor and saturation current density, extracted following procedures proposed by Sites et al. and Hegedus et al. (see ESI S1†) are summarized in Table 1.34,41 The diode quality factor for all three devices is close to 2, where for the 50 nm Ge devices it is slightly higher. This suggests that the main recombination path is recombination in the space charge region for all three samples.42 The saturation current density of the 10 nm Ge devices is the lowest, whereas that of the 50 nm Ge samples is one order of magnitude higher indicating an enhanced recombination as the origin for the lower Voc value obtained. To further investigate recombination mechanism in the devices, temperature dependent JV measurements were carried out.
In Fig. 4, temperature dependent dark JV curves of all 3 devices are shown. Remarkable is the increase in series resistance at low temperature for the 50 nm Ge devices, as can be seen by the strong downward bending of the JV curves at higher forward bias. An exponential increase in series resistance is observed, where for the 50 nm Ge device one can distinguish two regions. The observed temperature dependence indicates thermal activation of the carriers, and thus the series resistance can be described by , where Ea is the activation energy.43 In earlier studies this exponential increase in series resistance was related to an non-ohmic back contact of kesterite and the MoS(e)2/Mo interface;5 however it is more likely that bulk conductivity itself limits the series resistance.44 Gunawan et al. related the exponential increase in series resistance to carrier freeze-out due to the fact that the dominant acceptor defect is quite deep, e.g. 0.13–0.2 eV above the valence band depending on the bandgap of the absorber.44 In Fig. 4 the extracted activation energies of the series resistances are shown for all three devices. For the 10 nm device the lowest activation energy of 8 meV was found. For the 0 nm Ge devices it increases to 14 meV, and for the 50 nm Ge device two regions can be distinguished. For the first temperature range of 300–150 K an activation energy of 23 meV was found which increases to 48 meV for temperatures <130 K. Similar observations of two thermally activated processes are reported in the literature, where the first activation energy is related to grain boundaries or shallow acceptor-like defects and the second one at lower temperature to different processes like carrier localization in potential wells, radiative recombination or Mott's variable range hopping where holes occupy shallow states in the band gap and if a sufficiently high concentration of these states is present the overlapping of their wave functions could form an impurity band.43,45 Since the high temperature activation energy is the lowest for the 10 nm Ge device an reduction of the grain boundary barrier height for the optimal Ge doping range of 10 nm could be speculated because in this temperature range thermionic emission across grain boundaries is typically the dominant conduction mechanism.46 However, more detailed conductivity measurements of the thin films itself would be necessary to confirm it.

Besides dark JV–T analysis, the illuminated curves were recorded as well and device parameters extracted. In Fig. 5 the Jsc, efficiency (eff) and Voc for different temperatures are shown. From temperature dependent Voc measurements the activation energy of the main recombination path can be determined by extrapolating the Voc to 0 K.42 Comparing this value with the bandgap of the absorber could lead to a conclusion about the possible Voc limitations due to the interface, i.e. unfavourable band alignment of the absorber and buffer layer.42 For the 0 nm Ge and 10 nm Ge, values of 0.81 eV and 0.86 eV were obtained, respectively. These values are lower than the bandgap extracted from the EQE; however, since kesterite absorbers suffer from strong band tailing, the Voc at 0 K should be compared to the energy of the radiative recombination in the bulk, i.e. to the maximum of the PL spectrum.16 These values are similar to those of the RT PL peaks (see Fig. 2(b)) and thus for 0 nm Ge and 10 nm Ge devices the main recombination is bulk recombination as is commonly observed for selenium rich kesterite.43 Surprisingly the Voc at 0 K for the 50 nm Ge device is much lower, and an activation energy of 0.57 eV is obtained. This could be either related to a non-ideal diode-like behaviour like a strong temperature dependent diode factor or voltage dependent carrier collection which makes the extraction of activation energy invalid47 or a change of band alignment of the Ge containing kesterite with the CdS buffer to a cliff-like alignment.

Furthermore, a strong decrease in Jsc for the 50 nm Ge device at low temperature is observed which correlates with the strong increase of series resistance. For the 0 nm Ge device this decrease is less pronounced, and for the 10 nm Ge devices almost no decrease is observed. The efficiency behaves the same way, a strong decrease for the 50 nm and the 0 nm Ge device, whereas the efficiency of 10 nm Ge devices continuously increases until almost 100 K. Quenching of efficiency at low temperature is commonly observed in kesterite devices and related to the carrier freeze-out, i.e. strong increase of series resistance.48 Kim et al. showed that by employing a In2S3/CdS double buffer layer, the CZTSSe absorber doping level could be increased by In doping and the low temperature quenching eliminated, as well as the efficiency at room temperature improved.48 In the following, it will be shown that for the optimum Ge doping range of 10 nm also an increase in doping is observed which could explain that for the 10 nm Ge device no quenching at all is observed.
One interesting feature in the EQE measurements shown in Fig. 2 that was not commented on yet is the increased EQE signal in the long wavelength region for the 50 nm Ge device, which is in agreement with a higher Jsc obtained. Doping profiles derived from CV measurements (see Fig. 6) show an increase in charge carrier density for the 10 nm Ge sample followed by a decrease for the 50 nm Ge device. The space charge region (SCR) extracted at 0 V from the profiles shows the highest value for the 50 nm Ge case (see Table 1), which can explain the improved collection in the long wavelength region of the EQE. Assuming a change only in the absorber doping (N) one can estimate the change in Voc by .3 The increase in doping of around one order of magnitude from 1.8 × 1015 cm−3 to 1.5 × 1016 as is observed for the 0 nm Ge compared to the 10 nm Ge device would result in a Voc improvement of 55 mV, which corresponds perfectly to the observed Voc improvements. The decrease of doping density for the 50 nm Ge is surprising and might be related to a different mechanism. As already observed in previous work,24 there is high frequency dependence, for the 50 nm Ge device, of the doping profile observed. This is a strong indication of the presence of deep defects.49
 Fig. 6  Doping profiles derived from CV measurements at different frequencies. 
To further investigate defects in the three devices, admittance spectroscopy measurements were carried out as shown in Fig. 7. Two capacitance steps are present in the 50 nm Ge device, whereas for the 10 nm Ge device just one step is visible (see Fig. 7(c) and (e)). Similar Cf spectra were obtained for devices presented in previous work24 confirming the reproducibility of the process and measurements. In the Cf spectrum of the 0 nm Ge reference device also two steps are visible (see Fig. 7(a)). The defect spectra derived from admittance spectroscopy measurements using the method proposed by Walter et al.50 are shown in Fig. 7(b), (d) and (f). For all cases a shallow defect around 100 mV is observed which gets shallower for the optimal Ge doping of 10 nm. Remarkable is the appearance of a deep defect for the 0 nm Ge as well as the 50 nm Ge device with activation energies above 400 meV. The values of activation energy extracted for this set of samples agree well with the ones extracted from a different set investigated in previous work24 confirming the reproducibility of the processes. Recently Larramona et al.21 showed that by fine tuning the Sn concentration the formation of a deep defect (600 meV), probably CuSn antisites or VCu formed due to Sn loss, could be avoided and the efficiency increased over 11%.
 Fig. 7  
C–f spectra at different temperatures (a), (c), and (e) and defect spectra derived from it (b), (d), and (f). 
This is in agreement with our observations for the 10 nm Ge sample where Ge could compensate Sn loss and avoid a deep defect formation like CuSn or Vsn as already proposed in:24 VCu + CuSn + Ge → GeSn + CuCu(1)or Vsn + Ge → GeSn(2)
For high Ge content (i.e. 50 nm Ge) the formation of CuSn is less likely because the CZTSe absorbers are synthesized as Cu poor and in this case group IV element (Sn and Ge) rich. Thus the formation of SnCu or GeCu antisite donor defects seems more likely under these growth conditions: VCu + SnSn + Ge → GeSn + SnCu(3)or VCu + Ge → GeCu(4)
Ge replaces Sn and the excess Sn could lead to the formation of SnCu or GeCu antisite defects. SnCu creates a deep donor defect51,52 which acts as an electron–hole recombination centre deteriorating the solar cell performance. This would further explain the lower doping observed for high Ge (50 nm) devices due to compensation. Recently Wei et al.22 showed by admittance spectroscopy measurements and simulations that a deep n-type defect is present in a 10% CZTSSe solar cell, which could be a key limitation of the device performance and was possibly attributed to SnCu or SnZn donor defects, which is in line with our observations. For the optimum Ge doping range of 10 nm Ge added during absorber synthesis, the formation of deep defects either due to Sn loss or group IV elements antisite defects could be avoided and the highest device performance is achieved. Still the reason for increased doping, which might be responsible for the increased Voc besides the reduced recombination due to the elimination of deep defects and as also evidenced by the lowest saturation current density (see Table 1), is not totally clear. A possible interaction of Na, a well-known dopant in chalcogenide photovoltaic absorbers, and Ge could be responsible for it as will be discussed later on in more detail.
3.2. Photoluminescence measurements
To further investigate possible defects which are active in radiative processes photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out. Unfortunately due to detector limitations, possible PL bands related to midgap defects cannot be assessed. Nevertheless valuable information about recombination processes and shallow defects can be obtained from the temperature dependence of PL spectra around the bandgap. In Fig. 8, the PL spectra of three analyzed samples measured at 20 K with the highest excitation power are presented. The maximum peak position is not changed in the sample with 10 nm of Ge compared to the 0 nm Ge one, while for the sample with 50 nm of Ge a shift to higher energy is observed. This correlates with the Raman data which indicated the formation of a new phase of Cu2ZnSnxGe1−xSe4 solid solution which has a higher band gap than the pure CZTSe phase, and is also coherent with the higher band gap observed in the EQE data.36 To determine the nature of the observed PL spectra, an excitation power dependence study of PL spectra in all samples has been performed. Selected spectra of the sample with 10 nm of Ge are presented in Fig. 9(a). Analysis of these spectra showed a strong blue shift of the peak maximum with excitation power. The increase is about 18 meV per decade (see Fig. 9(b)). Additionally the analysis of the integrated PL intensity versus excitation power showed an exponential dependence in accordance with the formula IPL ∼ Iexk. The exponent k was found to be lower than 1 (see Fig. 9(c)). This indicates the defect related nature of the observed PL spectra, while the strong blue shift of the maximum is an indication of a quasi-donor–acceptor pair (QDAP) recombination as a radiative process in the analyzed samples.53 The QDAP recombination was previously found in pure CZTSe54 and CZTS55,56 compounds, as well as in their solid solutions.54 It is characterized by a strong influence of the band bending due to a fluctuating potential, to the PL band maximum position, which could be described by:53 EPL = Eg − (EA + ED) − 2Γ(5)Here Eg is the band gap energy, EA and ED are the activation energies of the acceptor and donor, respectively, involved in the irradiative process and coefficient Γ is the average potential well depth.53

The analysis of the temperature dependence of PL spectra (Fig. 10(a)) showed a red shift of the band maximum up to ∼100 K and a blue shift at higher temperatures (Fig. 10(b)). Similar dependencies were observed in the case of CZTSSe solid solutions for the QDAP emission.54,57 A strong quenching of PL intensity of about 3 orders in the analyzed temperature range 20–300 K (Fig. 10(c)) was found in the studied samples. This quenching could be described using the following equation with two activation energies:58 (6)where a1 and a2 are the rate parameters of the non-irradiative process with activation energies E1 and E2. I0 is the PL intensity at the lowest temperature and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The activation energies obtained from fitting of integrated PL intensity are almost constant in both the 0 nm and 10 nm Ge samples and increase in the case of the sample with 50 nm of Ge (see Fig. 10(c)). Note that in the framework of the QDAP recombination model the lower E1 energy is attributed to the average value of the valley depth, from which the carriers should be thermally activated for the subsequent recombination, rather than to the activation energy of some shallow defect levels.54 The obtained values of E1, i.e. the valley depth in the analyzed samples, showed only a slight change with Ge content used in agreement with the extracted Urbach energy from the EQE for all samples (see Fig. 2(c)). However, the E1 value is smaller than the tail energy for all samples, indicating that potential fluctuations are only one of the possible reasons of their formation.

The higher activation energy E2 could be attributed to a donor or an acceptor level involved in the recombination process. At temperatures higher than 250 K the radiative mechanism of the observed PL spectra was found to be changed from QDAP to the band to impurity (BI) recombination, which is proven by the constant maximum position with excitation power change at 300 K. Since the CZTSe absorber has p-type conductivity the transition acceptor-conduction band is most probable as the origin for the observed PL band near room temperature. From the band gap energy found in the EQE and the position of the PL band maximum at 300 K, the activation energy of the involved acceptor level (EA) was roughly estimated to be in the range 58–79 meV for all the samples. This range is in agreement with the energy level found by admittance spectroscopy. Some discrepancies found for 0 nm and 50 nm Ge devices could be due to uncertainties of extraction of defect energies when two capacitance steps overlap or the increasing series resistance at low temperatures.59,60 Following the logic proposed by Levcenco et al.54 an E2 of 70–118 meV is attributed to a donor defect level (ED) and a deeper acceptor level should exist in the band gap to ensure the QDAP recombination process.
In summary, from the study of defect levels present in the band gap using admittance spectroscopy and photoluminescence, we obtained two shallow levels at ∼0.1 eV (one donor and one acceptor) and one deep level at ∼0.4 eV. The latter only exists in 0 nm and 50 nm Ge samples and could be one of the reasons for their reduced efficiency compared to the 10 nm Ge device.
3.3. Interaction of Ge and Na
The reasons for the increased charge carrier density for the optimum Ge doping of 10 nm, as observed by CV profiling (see Fig. 6) is still not clear. Recently our group discovered a possible interaction of Ge and Na, a well-known dopant in kesterite based solar cells.61 As shown by Giraldo et al.61 a higher amount of Na was found in the absorber layer synthesized using the optimum range of about 10 nm Ge, whereas using higher Ge amounts during synthesis led to a decrease in Na in the absorber. The Na amount found correlates well with the doping profiles obtained, whereas it is shown in this study that a higher doping level is obtained for 10 nm Ge devices but for higher Ge amounts (>25 nm) a decrease in doping density is observed.61 In the study of Giraldo et al. NaOx crystals were found on top of the absorbers synthesized with addition of high Ge quantities, and thus an extraction of Na from the absorber towards the absorber surface was proposed due to the formation of a GeSe-liquid phase which can dissolve Na in large amounts. Furthermore, element IV (Sn and Ge)-rich growth increases the probability of GeCu and SnCu antisites and therefore hinders the incorporation of Na due to the fact that Na most likely occupies Cu vacancies (NaCu).61,62 Furthermore, absorbers synthesized on sodium-free substrates like Si/SiO2 showed that Ge assisted synthesis is only beneficial for device performance if additional Na is added by evaporation of a NaF layer.61 This fact was further confirmed by different Na-free substrates like stainless steel.63 To get more insights into the possible interaction between Na and Ge, a sample series with optimum as well as high Ge content was prepared but with additional Na added by depositing NaF on top of nanocrystalline precursors before Ge deposition. Thermally evaporated NaF on top of precursor layers has already been shown in the literature to be an effective source of additional Na during the synthesis of CZTSe absorber layers.64 Two different thicknesses of NaF (10 nm and 15 nm) were thermally evaporated onto nanocrystalline precursors followed by deposition of a 10 nm and a 25 nm Ge capping layer in the same evaporation chamber without breaking the vacuum. Then these nanocrystalline precursors with Ge and NaF+Ge capping layers were annealed under a selenium atmosphere as described in the Experimental details. In Fig. 11, box plots of the device parameters of the different samples are shown. For the optimum Ge amount of 10 nm, the addition of Na has no significant influence on device performance. However, for the sample synthesized with a large Ge amount of 25 nm, additional Na clearly improves device performance especially Voc. To probe if the additional NaF layer may change Ge incorporation into the film, the bandgap values extracted from EQE (Fig. 12(a)) measurements are compared in Fig. 12(b) for the 25 nm Ge series. No significant difference is observed, indicating that the additional Na has no influence on Ge incorporation from the point of view of possible bandgap changes.

Two different devices are investigated in more detail in the following. One employs an absorber layer that was synthesized under Ge rich conditions by adding 25 nm Ge on top of the nanocrystalline precursor prior to selenization and one was synthesized using the same amount of Ge but with 15 nm NaF evaporated on top before Ge evaporation. In Fig. 13(a), the JV curve of the best cell of the two devices is shown. A clear improvement in Voc is observed for the Ge+NaF device and the device performance could largely be improved as can be seen in Table 2.

Doping profiles extracted from CV measurements of the two devices are shown in Fig. 13(b). An increase in doping density for the Ge + Na device can be observed, as well as the frequency dependence of the doping profiles could be reduced. Admittance spectroscopy measurements were carried out as well on the devices as can be seen in Fig. 14. In the Cf spectrum of the device whose absorber was synthesized just by 25 nm Ge addition and without additional Na (Fig. 14(a)), clearly two capacitance steps can be seen as it was observed for all absorbers synthesized using large amounts of Ge (>25 nm). The defect spectra extracted from the Cf measurements show a shallower defect at around 163 meV, which for this device was found at higher activation energy compared to the devices investigated before (see Fig. 14(b) and compare to Fig. 7). Additionally, a deep defect at 325 meV was found as it was detected for all devices with absorbers that were synthesized with thick Ge capping layers (>25 nm). Here this deep defect seems less pronounced which could be explained by the fact that less Ge (25 nm instead of 50 nm) was used during synthesis, and thus fewer GeCu or SnCu antisites are probably formed. In the Cf spectrum of the 25 nm Ge + 15 nm NaF sample, the high temperature capacitance step is not obvious anymore and only a step at low temperatures is clearly observed, whose activation energy was found to be around 113 meV.

Cf spectra at different temperatures as well as the defect spectra derived from them for Ge and Ge + Na doped devices. 
The elimination of the deep defect by controlled Na addition confirms the suspected interaction between Ge and Na. As proposed by Giraldo et al. using a large amount of Ge during synthesis creates element IV (Sn and Ge)-rich growth conditions, which could lead to the release of Na out of the absorber.61 The Ge–Na dynamics for this case can be described by SnSn + NaCu + Ge → GeSn + SnCu + Na(7)or NaCu + Ge → GeCu + Na(8)
Thus, supplying large amounts of Ge during synthesis could lead to the replacement of NaCu, releasing Na of the absorber, and the formation of SnCu or GeCu antisites, which are deep donor defects as discussed earlier and deteriorate the cell performance.51,52 A sufficiently high additional supply of Na can avoid this process and therefore, no deep defects related to GeCu or SnCu and higher device performance are observed as can be described by VCu + SnSn + Ge + Na → GeSn + Snsn + NaCu(9)or VCu + Ge + Na → NaCu + Ge(10)
The observed increased doping density for the Ge+NaF device can be explained by the reduced formation of compensating donor defects and additionally by the expected higher Na amount in the absorber, which is known to increase doping of kesterite absorbers and as also observed here makes acceptor defects shallower.62,65 Therefore, for the optimum Ge doping range of around 10 nm Ge, it is reasonable to assume that the right amount of Ge added during synthesis on one hand avoids the formation of VSn or CuSn antisites which could form due to Sn loss, and furthermore moderates the Na amount inside the final absorber layer.
4. Conclusions
A detailed study investigating the beneficial effects of Ge doping on device performance has been presented. For the optimal Ge amount provided during synthesis (i.e. around 10 nm), a large increase in Voc is observed, which can be explained by an increase in doping density as well as a reduction of recombination due to the fact that the formation of deep defects is avoided as evidenced by admittance spectroscopy. For the device without Ge doping as well as for the one synthesized with the addition of a high Ge amount (50 nm), deep midgap defects have been found as a possible reason for the lower device performance and especially higher Voc deficit. These defects could potentially be assigned to VSn or CuSn antisites caused due to Sn loss, or SnCu or GeCu antisites formed due to element IV rich growth conditions. Controlled Ge addition in low quantities could avoid the formation of these defects by compensating possible Sn loss, besides the beneficial effects on grain growth due to the formation of a liquid Ge–Se phase as shown in previous work.24 Furthermore, the quenching of efficiency at low temperatures commonly reported in kesterite devices is not observed for the optimal range of Ge doping, thus the device behaviour gets more similar to that of high performance CIGS solar cells.48
PL of all three samples shows similar behavior, with a QDAP transition at low temperatures and BI transitions at RT. The activation energy of the acceptor level involved in the BI transition from 58–79 meV agrees well with the values obtained from admittance spectroscopy of the 10 nm Ge sample and is comparable for the 0 nm and 50 nm Ge samples. From fitting of the temperature dependence of the integrated PL intensity associated with the QDAP transition a donor level between 70 and 119 meV was found. The activation energy associated with the depth of the valleys, due to potential fluctuations, only changes slightly between the samples as well as band tails observed from EQE measurements suggesting no significant influence of Ge doping on these parameters.
Furthermore, a clear interaction of Ge and Na has been demonstrated. Excess Na addition to samples synthesized under Ge rich conditions could avoid the formation of deep defects formed normally under these growth conditions. In summary a careful control of group IV element content (Ge and Sn) is necessary during the growth of kesterite absorbers to avoid the formation of deep defects which are detrimental to the device performance and especially the Voc. This could be either achieved by controlled Ge doping or by additional supply of Na, which as has been demonstrated hinders the formation of detrimental deep defects.
