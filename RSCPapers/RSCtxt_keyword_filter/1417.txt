    , Accepted 28th May 2020First published on 2nd June 2020AbstractAll-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are attracting considerable attention due to their promising thermal stability, but their inferior power-conversion efficiencies (PCE) hinder their realistic application. Here, we propose an approach through surface modification based on methyl ammonium halide (MAX) for inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cells processed at a low temperature. The combined benefits of the introduced MAX modifier enable the boosting of the power conversion efficiency to 14.8% with an impressive FF of 82.2% in CsPbI2Br PSCs. Our experimental analyses coupled with optical modeling indicate that the incorporated MAX leads to an effective passivation of the surface traps originating from Pb2+ and I− ions in CsPbI2Br and simultaneously mediates the crystallization of CsPbI2Br with slightly enlarged grains and reduced numbers of structural defects and pinhole. As a result, the interfacial trap-assisted recombination is suppressed and the charge extraction is promoted. Mechanistically, we show that in the presence of MAX, the deep-level traps in the perovskites are passivated, leaving the energy of the trapping centers to become shallower. In this situation, the negative impacts of the traps on carrier transport and recombination are mitigated.
Introduction
In the last few decades, inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been making tremendous progress in the power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the champion PCE exceeding 24%.1–3 However, the poor long-term stability, partly due to the thermally unstable and intrinsically volatile nature of organic components, imposes barriers to their commercialization. Replacing the organic with an inorganic component is probably a viable solution to addressing these stability issues. Recently, all-inorganic caesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted considerable attention due to their thermochromic properties, excellent charge-carrier mobilities, and high thermal stabilities, where the stable phase can be retained even at temperatures exceeding 350 °C.4,5 Among the components of choice, CsPbBr3, first reported for an inorganic photo-absorber in PSCs, has been exploited and demonstrated to have excellent thermal and photo-stabilities and moisture resistance.6,7 State-of-the-art CsPbBr3 has shown a PCE exceeding 10%.8–11 However, its wide bandgap (2.3 eV) severely limits its absorption and the resultant photovoltaic performance.
In contrast, CsPbI3 with a more favourable bandgap of 1.73 eV is regarded as a promising all-inorganic perovskite candidate.6,12–14 To date, the power conversion efficiency in CsPbI3 solar cells has made a rapid rise, reaching 17.8%.15,16 Unfavourably, the CsPbI3 devices are often accompanied by the instability issue, where the photoactive α-phase (black phase) tends to transit to a non-perovskite phase (yellow phase) at room temperature or under trace amounts of water, causing obstacles for the device applications. Although an array of strategies including doping, passivation, using quantum dots, or reducing dimensionality have been applied to stabilize the α-phase CsPbI3, its inferior phase stability seems inevitable due to the inherent low Goldschmidt tolerance factor (0.81).
The mixed-halide, CsPbI2Br, formed by the partial replacement of the I− ion with the Br− ion, shows an increased Goldschmidt tolerance factor (0.84) and an improved phase stability, thus showing promise for increasing the stability in the all-inorganic PSCs.17,18 However, with regard to CsPbI3 perovskites, the bandgap of CsPbI2Br is ∼1.92 eV, showing a trade-off between stability and light-harvesting efficiency.19,20 In addition, the requirement of a high processing temperature and the humidity instability are the current challenges yet to be overcome. Recently, through controlling the CsPbI2Br crystal growth by a synergistic modification with gradient thermal annealing (GTA) and anti-solvent treatment, high-quality pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films were demonstrated by using a low annealing temperature (T), achieving a PCE of 16.1% and higher with impressive stability.21–23 In general, the low-T processed CsPbI2Br Pero-SCs often suffer from high voltage losses and low external quantum efficiencies (EQE). This is mainly related to the non-radiative recombination occurring in the bulk perovskite films or/and at the interfacial contacts, due to the presence of bulk/surface defects in the photo-absorber, or the mismatched band alignment.24–26 To overcome these problems, seeking facile interface approaches to realize effective trap passivation that is compatible with the desired low-T film processing is critically important for improving the photovoltaic efficiency in the CsPbI2Br based perovskite solar cells.
In this work, we introduce an interfacial modifier based on methylammonium halides (CH3NH3X, or MAX, X = Cl, Br, I) that is inserted between the CsPbI2Br photo-absorbing layer and the Spiro-OMETAD hole transporting layer (HTL).15,27,28 Compared to the non-passivated CsPbI2Br film containing a large number of defects and pinholes to function as a recombination centre for charge carriers, the incorporated MAX layer leads to the passivation of surface traps arising from Pb2+ and simultaneously mediates a control on the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to arrive at slightly enlarged grains. As such, we achieved a PCE of 14.8% with an impressive fill factor (FF) of 82.2% under the optimal conditions. We further investigated the recombination kinetics by using light intensity (Plight) dependent impedance analysis to probe the photophysical origin for the enhanced performance. The active layer modified with MABr exhibits a higher carrier density at different Plight in association with a reduced recombination order. The demonstrated strategy provides an enabler to deal with the critical obstacles in the inorganic Pero-SCs toward reduced performance gap with respect to the Shockley–Queisser limit.
Results and discussion
We chose the P–I–N structure of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/MABr/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au to fabricate our all-inorganic PSCs. The cross-sectional image of the CsPbI2Br solar cells by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the energy diagram of CsPbI2Br films alongside utilized charge transporting layers are shown in Fig. 1a and b. To enable passivation for the perovskite, MABr solutions were spin-cast directly atop the finished CsPbI2Br layers. The optimal film thickness of the MABr layers was found to be around 2 nm, which is also supported by our simulation of the photocurrent in the CsPbI2Br-MABr solar cells based on the experimentally determined values of optical reflectivity and dielectric constant of the perovskite and MAX layers (see Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI†). All the analyses discussed below are based on pristine CsPbI2Br or CsPbI2Br deposited with MABr with the optimal thickness.

First, we examined the bandgap of the active layer by using photo-absorption and the results are shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S4 (ESI†). Absorbance cut-offs at ∼650 nm were found in these CsPbI2Br films and a bandgap of 1.84 eV was determined on the untreated CsPbI2Br with a Tauc plot (Fig. S4, ESI†), in agreement with the value reported in the literature.29,30 The bandgap of CsPbI2Br treated with MABr slightly reduces to 1.81 eV. The changes in the shift of work function (WF) are observed with UPS where the WF of the MABr-treated perovskite increases to 5.75 eV, with regard to a value of 5.7 eV for the pristine sample (UPS, see Fig. S5 in the ESI†). As will be seen, the slightly narrowed bandgap with MABr treatment does negatively affect the Voc in solar cells.
Crystallinity in the perovskite layer plays a vital role in ultimate performance. To gain insight into the structural properties of CsPbI2Br perovskites, we performed XRD analysis on bare CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br-MABr. As shown in Fig. 1d, the XRD peaks at 14° and 28° arises from the diffraction signals of the (100) and (200) facets in CsPbI2Br crystals, respectively.17,31 Of note, the peak intensity slightly increases for the film deposited with MABr, indicating the enhanced crystallinity. This observation agrees with the enlarged grain sizes in the range of 870 nm, as shown by the SEM images in Fig. 1e and f. Moreover, the CsPbI2Br film is compact but still has some pinholes. In contrast, the CsPbI2Br-MABr film presents a pinhole-free feature with enlarged grain size. The increase in size of the MABr-CsPbI2Br crystal grains could be ascribed to the Br−/I− ion exchange reaction, which has been previously observed in MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 hybrid perovskite after the MABr/FABr treatment.32,33
We also examined the surface morphology of the photoactive layers by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown by the AFM topographic images in Fig. 1g and h, a homogeneous surface morphology is observed in the CsPbI2Br-MABr sample, without showing abrupt changes. It may imply a uniform coverage of the passivation layer. Beneficially, the surface roughness after the MABr treatment reduces, exhibiting an Rq of 13.7 nm relative to Rq = 17.7 nm of the pristine film. In the zoomed-in AFM height images (Fig. S6, ESI†), the edge of the crystals in the CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br-MABr films are visibly seen and a consistent trend in the reduction of Rq is observed, from 6.55 nm (without MABr) to 3.66 nm (with MABr). The increase of film smoothness is beneficial for the enlargement of shunting resistance,34,35 which, as will be discussed, can be partially responsible for the impressive fill factor in the perovskite solar cell.
Based on the characterizations above, we propose that CsPbI2Br-MABr is stabilized by both the Br− cations and the MA+ organic cations after surface passivation as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a. To further understand the impacts of MABr treatment on the molecular arrangements in our perovskites, we explored the crystal orientation in the CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br-MABr films by grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS, see results in Fig. 2b and c). These GIWAXS patterns are featured with a series of Debye–Scherrer diffraction rings, suggestive of the isotropic crystal orientation in these solid films.

(b and c) 2D patterns of grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measured on the CsPbI2Br films processed without and with post-MABr treatment. (d and e) Line-cut profile curves of GIWAXS along the in-plane (d) and out-of-plane (e) directions for the stacking of the (100) plane. Also shown are the calculated crystal correlation lengths (CCL) for the respective stacking orientations. (f) High resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of core-level Br 3d in the CsPbI2Br perovskite film. 
To assess the ordering in the stacking of the crystallographic planes, we further calculated the (100) crystal correlation length (CCL) by using the following relation, (1)where Π is the ratio of circumference to diameter, K is a constant (here a value of 0.9 is used), and Δq is the half width at half-maximum of the diffraction peak. As shown in Fig. 2d, the (100) diffraction peak at 1 Å−1 for the MABr-treated film presents an in-plane (IP) CCL of the same value (18.5 ± 0.05 nm) as that of the control film, but a larger out-of-plane (OOP) CCL (21.3 ± 0.04 nm), with regard to the value (17.7 ± 0.02 nm) of the control film (see Fig. 2e). The increased CCL along the OOP direction together with the unchanged CCL in the IP direction strongly indicates that the crystals in CsPbI2Br primarily adapt to the vertical orientation. In general, such favourable vertical stacking of the active layer can prompt carrier transport and eventual collection in solar cells.4,36
The chemical interactions of MABr with the perovskite were probed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2f shows the zoomed-in XPS spectra of core level Br 3d for the CsPbI2Br films without and with MABr (see the XPS spectra of other compositing elements in Fig. S7, ESI†). As evidence for the passivation of the under saturated I− or Pb2+ ions with MABr, we calculated the I− to Pb2+ ratios based on the XPS peak percentage (see the results in Table S1, ESI†). The I−/Pb2+ ratios were determined to be 2.23 (±0.01) and 2.08 (±0.01) for the CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br-MABr films, respectively. Apparently, without passivation, the CsPbI2Br film is featured with an iodine-rich surface while the amount of the under-saturated I− ions seems to reduce after MABr passivation, revealed by the decreased I−/Pb2+ ratio, which is close to the stoichiometric value of 2. As reported previously, under-coordinated halide ions are one of the primary origins for the charge trapping or hysteresis effect in the MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 hybrid PSCs.37–39 To this end, the capability of passivation with MABr provides an opportunity for suppressing traps in all-inorganic PSCs, which will be confirmed below.
Now we turn to examine the photovoltaic performance in the all-inorganic PSCs influenced by the MABr modification. The devices adopt a n–i–p device structure with SnO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD serving as the electron and hole transporting layers, respectively. The obtained current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics under the standard AM 1.5 G illumination is shown in Fig. 3a. Based on the optimized film thickness (L = 430 nm), we achieved the best efficiency of 14.8% with a Voc of 1.24 V, a Jsc of 15.1 mA cm−2 and an FF of 82.2% for the device passivated with MABr (see the best solar cell parameters summarized in Table 1 and the statistics of the device parameters in Table S2, ESI†). In contrast, the PCE of the device without the MABr passivation layer considerably reduces, due to significant drops in the three photovoltaic parameters. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the according solar cells is provided in Fig. 3b. The Jsc calculated from integrated EQE is 14.5 (±0.02) mA cm−2 (with MABr) and 14.1 (±0.05) mA cm−2 (without MABr), which are in good agreement with the Jsc values measured from J–V curves with deviations less than 5%. Such improvement should be largely related to the modified bulk properties in CsPbI2Br with the enhanced crystallinity and crystal orientation, as discussed above. The histogram of the photovoltaic performance is illustrated in Fig. 3c (based on more than 30 devices). On average, the PCE receives an enhancement by 14.0% afforded by the MABr modification.

Apart from the PCE, device stability is another critical property for the realistic application of PSCs. To this end, we examined the photo-stability in our CsPbI2Br solar cells. As comparatively shown in Fig. 3d, the CsPbI2Br-MABr based PSC retains 60% of its initial PCE after being stored in a N2-purged glovebox with 1000 h of continuous white light illumination. In contrast, the device without the MABr layers exhibits a poorer stability with a 12.8% degradation in the PCE under the same aging conditions. The enhanced stability with MABr can be attributed to the improved morphology with nearly pin-hole free features and the passivated halide ions such that ion motion toward grain boundaries or interfaces under illumination could be mitigated.15,40,41
To gain physical insights into the enhanced photovoltaic performance, we further investigated the carrier sweep-out and recombination processes by using transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) measurements. Fig. 3e shows the TPC decay kinetics with and without the MABr layer at short circuit conditions excited at 488 nm. Based on a mono exponential decay fitting model, we determined the charge extraction time (τext) which amounted to 75 (±0.2) ns and 102 (±0.3) ns for the CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br-MABr devices, respectively. The shortened carrier extraction indicates the promoted carrier extraction in the presence of the passivation layer, which should help overcome the competing process of charge recombination.17,19,21,42 We also examined the recombination in solar cells by the TPV measured under open-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 3f, the extracted recombination lifetime (TPV) is 51.6 (±0.04) μs without MABr and it increases to 66.9 (±0.7) μs in the cells containing the passivation layer. The longer recombination lifetime is suggestive of the suppression of interfacial recombination with the passivation layer and these observations can reconcile and fully explain the FF in our devices.
To have a quantitative assessment on the internal electric fields which provides the driving force for charge separation and transport, we resorted to the capacitance–voltage measurements of the built-in voltage (Vbi). Fig. 4a displays the capacitance–voltage (C−2–V) plots for the devices from which Vbi was obtained according to the Mott–Schottky equation.43–45 (2)where Vbi is the built-in potential, V is the applied voltage, A is the device area, NA is the carrier concentration, εr and ε0 are the relative and vacuum permittivity of perovskites (εr ∼ 25.0), respectively, and q has been defined. The Vbi of the CsPbI2Br-MABr device was estimated to be 1.17 V, which is higher than that of bare CsPbI2Br (1.08 V). This higher value of Vbi reflects the enhanced driving force for separating charges. We also observed that the measured Vbi complies with the Voc obtained from J–V curves, indicating a more efficient separation and transport of charge carrier with the enlargement of Vbi. This feature hints that photo-generated carriers can more efficiently compensate for the intrinsic defect density, which is a significant aspect of achieving a high Voc.34,35 We further assessed the density of traps (Ntrap) by dark carrier characteristics in perovskite solar cells. As shown in Fig. 4b, the linear behaviour can be correlated to the ohmic current at low bias in the presence of background charges. Upon increase of bias, the linear current transits to the trap-filling current (TLC) finger printed by the strong voltage dependence. When further increasing the bias, quadratic voltage dependence appears, commonly described by the space-charge limited current.19,46 Based on the voltage (Vtr) at which the transition from the linear transport to the trap-filling current (TLC) occurs, we determined Ntrap with the relation given by, (3)with L being the thickness of the active layers. The determined Ntrap is 7.72 × 1015 cm−3 in the device without passivation and it reduces to 4.46 × 1015 cm−3 with the MABr layer. The reduced trap density can result in a reduced Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, which helps increase the number of mobile charges upon irradiation, such that the Jsc enlarges.

To further find out the origin of the improved device performance in the CsPbI2Br-MABr device, we analysed the perovskite films by using steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4c, the PL intensity of the CsPbI2Br-MABr film is approximately 2-fold higher than that of the CsPbI2Br film, indicating a dramatically decreased non-radiative recombination.19,23,31 The results reveal that the density of the trap states decreases with the treatment using MABr, so that the non-radiative recombination channels at both the interface and the bulk film are inhibited. Fig. 4d shows the charge collection probability (Pc) in these CsPbI2Br devices. The parameter Pc was determined by normalizing the photocurrent with respect to the saturated photocurrent under large reverse bias.47–49 As can be seen, Pc retains higher values in the CsPbI2Br-MABr device (e.g. Pc, CsPbI2Br-MABr = 97.7% in the maximum power condition), especially close to the built-in voltage, meaning that the charge collection efficiency is higher in the MABr-passivated solar cells, a result of the better crystal quality and reduced charge trapping.
Also, we examined the recombination type in the operating PSCs by using light intensity (Plight)-dependent photovoltage measurements. Fig. 5a and Fig. S8 (ESI†) showed Voc and other solar cell parameters as a function of Plight. Voc generally follows the relationship Voc = nkT/qln(Plight). With a slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) equalling kBT/q, it suggests the dominance of bimolecular charge recombination, while a slope higher than kBT/q indicates defect-mediated recombination.21,50 A slope of 1.53kBT/q was identified in the CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells and it reduces to 1.23kBT/q in the MABr-modified device. The results confirm that the incorporated passivation layer of MABr effectively reduces the defect-mediated recombination in the operating solar cells.

(c) Extracted density of photocarriers as a function of light intensity in the studied devices. (d) Effective carrier lifetime versus carrier density characteristics of the CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br-MABr devices under open-circuit conditions. 
Next, we examined the charge recombination kinetics by using (Plight)-dependent impedance spectroscopy. Fig. 5b (Fig. S9 and Table S3 in the ESI†) and Fig. 5c show Nyquist plots of impedance spectroscopy performed on the PSCs under different solar irradiations measured under open-circuit conditions relying on the different light intensities alongside fittings with equivalent circuit modelling (ECM). From the fitting results, the determined Rs by ECM is 48.6 ± 4 Ω (CsPbI2Br) and 64.9 ± 3 Ω (CsPbI2Br-MABr). Based on measuring the chemical capacitance (Cm) at different Plight, we determined the density of photo-generated carriers (Nd) in the PSCs. Under open-circuit conditions with different light intensities, the measured capacitance and resistance in the intermediate frequency regime, respectively, reflected the charge/discharge and recombination processes in the solar cell, thus being referred to as the chemical capacitance (Cm) and the recombination resistance (Rrec).51,52 From the Nyquist plot, it can be seen that both the solar cells (without or with interfacial layer) exhibit a similar tendency that the decrease of Cm is in association with an increase of Rrec at lower Plight.
Consistently, these behaviours have been observed in previous studies and can be understood from the decreased charge carrier density with reduced Plight, which effectively decreases the encounter probability of photocarriers. Fig. 5c shows the extracted Nd as a function of Plight for the two solar cells. The carrier density Nd at a given Voc was calculated by integrating Cm(V) over voltage under different light intensities, according to eqn (4), (4)
As shown in Fig. 5c, the Nd of both the devices exhibits a power law dependence on Plight. Interestingly, the power seems not to be significantly affected by the presence of the MAX passivation layer. Of importance, despite the similar optical bandgap and absorbance, the device containing the MABr layer possesses higher Nd across the selected Plight, pointing to the reduction of the photocarrier loss, which is explained by the expediated charge sweep-out and suppressed SRH recombination. Based on the lifetime of photocarriers under open-circuit conditions that was estimated from the product of recombination resistance and chemical capacitance, we examined the recombination kinetics by plotting the carrier lifetime as a function of carrier density (see Fig. 5d).21,38,42 Under open-circuit conditions, τcarr is mainly dictated by the recombination strength. With this knowledge, we compared τcarr at different Plight in our PSCs. At lower carrier density regimes, the τcarr of the two devices are almost the same while at higher Nd (close to 1 sun), the τcarr in the passivated cell is longer, consistent to the greater carrier densities mentioned above. This trend is in line with the general picture of the mitigated recombination in the solar cell where the carriers become longer-lived. In contrast, the carrier lifetime in the non-passivated device decreases more sharply with the increases of Nd, which implies a stronger recombination and higher losses in the photocarrier. We also note that the recombination order (RO) in the solar cell with MABr is smaller, revealed by the slope of τcarr against Nd in a double-logarithm scale. A reduction of RO has been proposed to be related to the decreased charge trapping in solar cells.38 To this end, these observations shed light on the key role of the interfacial modification in the physical processes of our PSCs.
With the demonstrated passivation with MABr, we further investigated the impacts of electronegativity and atomic sizes of passivation molecules on the photovoltaic characteristics. For this purpose, we introduced a series of passivation layers based on MAX (X = Cl, Br and I) atop the CsPbI2Br active layer using similar processing as mentioned above. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows J–V characteristics and according EQE spectra of the different CsPbI2Br devices. The extracted solar cell parameters alongside standard deviations are plotted in Fig. 6. The enhancement of the device parameters, such as PCE and fill factor follow the same order, that is, CsPbI2Br-MABr > CsPbI2Br-MAI > CsPbI2Br-MACl > CsPbI2Br, suggestive of the different passivation capabilities with MAX molecules. On the contrary, there is no obvious trend in the increase of Voc and Jsc with these passivation molecules. Given that the devices with MABr and MAI outperform those with MACl or the ones without any passivation, it hints that the congeneric effects on the elemental passivation may play a role in obtaining the desired modification.

At last, we adopted the optical transfer matrix model demonstrated by the McGehee group53 to obtain theoretical insights into the improved efficiencies with MABr passivation based on the experimentally determined complex refractive indexes for each component in the solar cell.54–56 The essential parameters used for our simulation are provided in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), determined by a step profiler. Fig. 7a shows the simulated absorption of the active layer based on the experimentally determined complex refractive indexes of the CsPbI2Br films. The simulated curves match well with the features of absorption spectra of the active layers, which validates the applicability for the model used in the study.

(a) Fraction of light absorbed by the basic structure with different passivation materials (A: absorbed light, R: reflected light), determined by optical transfer matrix modelling based on the experimental values of refraction index. (b) Variation in light intensity versus wavelength in different solar cells containing the same CsPbI2Br layer (solid line: simulation; dashed line: experimental UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra). (c and d) Simulated electric field intensities induced by the propagation of various wavelengths of light through (c) CsPbI2Br and (d) CsPbI2Br-MABr. 
As can be seen from the compared light absorption of the actual devices and our optical simulation in Fig. 7b, consistent trends in the transmittance and reflectance are noted that the light reflectivity is reduced after passivation.57 This phenomenon is possibly related to the filling of interface defects by the Br− ions in the passivation layer, which helps reduce the light reflectivity.58
We further look at the simulated electric field intensity (EFI) generated by light traveling through the stacks without and with MAX to better understand light propagation through realistic devices. We chose 4 representative wavelengths (600, 630, 650, and 700 nm) in our simulation. Here we mainly focus on comparing the EFI of the CsPbI2Br control sample and CsPbI2Br-MABr, the latter of which has led to the champion PCE in solar cells. From the results shown in Fig. 6c, d and Fig. S11 (ESI†), we note less pronounced constructive interferences (at 650 and 670 nm) occurring in CsPbI2Br-MAX. This phenomenon can be related to the stronger absorption in the presence of the MABr layer. The enhanced absorption coupled with the reduced light reflectivity in CsPbI2Br-MAX is beneficial for reducing the optical losses, which can result in a higher Jsc in CsPbI2Br-MAX based solar cell samples, especially for the wavelength near the bandgap of the active layer. It is also interesting to note that the EFI in CsPbI2Br-MAI presents a similar distribution with that in CsPbI2Br-MABr. The result again points to the congeneric effects on surface passivation to obtain similar modifications of optical properties in the perovskite solar cells.
Conclusion
To summarize, we have demonstrated an effective post-processing approach with MABr modifier to passivate surface traps in the CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells. A higher crystallinity with reduced defect densities is realized in the presence of MABr, confirmed by using different experimental analyses. These modifications lead to the suppression of charge trapping and SRH recombination. As a result, the ultimate PCE of CsPbI2Br PSCs is boosted from 12.8% to 14.8% showing an impressive fill factor of 82.2%. Due to the higher film quality of perovskites and reduced traps, the stability of the passivated devices gains as well. The results of TPV and TPC measurements evidence that the MABr layer enhances the carrier lifetime and expedites charge extraction. Furthermore, the deep-level traps in the perovskites are passivated with MAX, leaving the energy of trapping centres to become shallower. Through the transfer matrix optical modelling, we found enhanced photon capturing in the device with the proposed passivation materials. This work provides an exciting opportunity to investigate the charge trapping and related barriers in all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells toward high efficiency and stability.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead iodide (99.9985%), lead bromide (99.999%), caesium iodide (99.999%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (anhydrous, ≥99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Isopropanol (≥99.9%) and ethanol (99.5%) were purchased from Aladdin. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (>99.0%) was purchased from TCI. SnO2 nanoparticle solution (2.5 wt% SnO2 in isopropanol) was purchased from Avantama.
Film preparation and device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrates (8 Ω sq−1, Beneq TFS 200) were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionised water, acetone, and alcohol under sonication and then dried with N2. The ITO substrates were treated under oxygen plasma for 10 min for further cleaning. SnO2 nanoparticle solution was diluted with IPA (1:1 by volume) and then spin-coated on the pre-cleared ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Afterward, the SnO2 nanoparticle-containing substrates were baked at 150 °C for 30 min to completely evaporate residual solvents. To prepare the perovskite precursor solutions, 277 mg of PbI2, 220 mg of PbBr2, and 312 mg of CsI were mixed in 1 mL of DMSO, and then heated at 60 °C until completely dissolved. The prepared precursor solutions were filtered before use. The CsPbI2Br precursor solution (80 μL) was dropped onto the SnO2 substrates and spin-coated via a two-step process with the first step coated at 500 rpm for 3 s, and the second at 2500 rpm for 30 s. The annealing process for perovskites contained two steps as follows: two hotplates were pre-set at a temperature of 42 °C and 160 °C, respectively. Straight after finishing the spin-coating, the perovskite films were placed onto the hotplate at 42 °C for about 4 min (depending on the colour of the film) to form transition films. Subsequently, the films were transferred onto the hotplate at 160 °C for 10 min to evaporate the solvents and further enhance the crystallization.
The annealed perovskite films were post-treated by spin-coating 80 μL of CH3NH3Br, CH3NH3Cl and CH3NH3I solutions (in isopropanol, ≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The optimal solution concentration of the utilized MAX (MABr, MAI, and MACl) was found to be 1 mg mL−1. Finally, the post-treated perovskite films were annealed at 120 °C for 2 min before the deposition of the hole transporting layer (HTL). To prepare the HTLs, solutions of hole transport materials, consisting of 0.1 M Spiro-OMETAD, 0.035 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSi), and 0.12 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in chlorobenzene/acetonitrile (10:1, v/v), were spin-coated on top of the annealed perovskite films at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 60 nm of Au top contact was thermal evaporated atop the HTL with an evaporation rate of 0.5 Å s−1.
Device testing and materials characterization
SEM images were captured by using a Hitachi S4800 electron microscope. Powder XRD was measured using a Rigaku D/MAX-TTRIII 3(CBO) X-ray diffractometer equipped with a push-plug gobble mirror and a monochromatic CuKα (λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation source. AFM topographic images were captured by using a Bruker multimode 8 microscope system in the tapping mode. The UV-IR spectra were obtained using a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 650/850/950 UV-vis spectrophotometer) in the 300–800 nm wavelength range. Steady-state PL excitation and emission spectra were recorded by using a HORIBA Fluorolog-III spectrofluorometer housed with a Janis cryostat with a 532 nm excitation light. GIWAXS measurements were obtained using a Xenocs Xeuss SAXS/WAXS beamline system based on an X-ray wavelength of 0.6887 Å. Transient photocurrent (TPC) and photovoltage (TPV) were measured by applying a 488 nm solid state laser (Coherent OBIS CORE 488LS) with a pulse width of ∼30 ns. The current traces were recorded by using a mixed domain oscilloscope (Tektronix MDO3032) through converting the registered voltage drop across a 2 Ω resistor load connected in series to the solar cell. TPV measurements were performed on the solar cell under open-circuit conditions with the same pulsed laser.
The current-density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of CsPbI2Br solar cells and single carrier devices were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under a nitrogen environment. CsPbI2Br solar cells were tested under irradiation by using a solar simulator calibrated with a standard Si cell and standard devices were tested in the dark. The irradiation intensity was adjusted by using an optical wheel filter and determined according to the current reading of the calibration cell. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the MABr-CsPbI2Br solar cells was measured by using a Newport external quantum measurement system (Model 66920). Impedance spectroscopy of the CsPbI2Br solar cells was performed by using a potentiostat under a nitrogen environment and the data were analysed by using the ZSimpWin program. The thickness of the different function layer was measured from the experiment using the Profilometer (Dektak XT). Different intensities of sunlight were simulated with filters of different transmittances.
