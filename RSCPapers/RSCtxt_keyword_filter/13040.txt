    , Accepted 8th April 2022First published on 8th April 2022AbstractAlthough all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) possess merits like mechanical flexibility, the photovoltaic performance is still modest due to (i) the strong intermolecular interaction of the polymer donor–polymer acceptor and thus (ii) the extremely complicated morphology control. In this concise contribution, layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition is employed to fabricate high-performing all-PSCs reaching a remarkably enhanced efficiency of 16.1% with an improved fill factor (FF) of 77.3%. The neutron reflectivity studies show that the 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) solvent additive can facilitate the polymer acceptor diffusing into the underlying polymer donor layer, especially providing useful leverage for realizing a P–i–N heterojunction. Taking advantage of the independent coating of the donor and acceptor, the LBL photoactive layers are found to show good crystallinity. Surprisingly, efficient charge separation, transportation and extraction, and suppressed charge recombination are achieved in the optimized all-PSCs. Here we note that the LBL all-PSCs outperform the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) all-PSCs, and the FF of 77.3% achieved in this work is the highest among efficient all-PSCs. This contribution paves the way for realizing optimal morphology and high-performing all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
With the rapid advancement of efficient nonfullerene acceptors and ingenious device configuration, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention and reached a milestone with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 20% (ref. 1–9) and an extrapolated life time of >20 years (ref. 10) in the past few years. As typical nonfullerene-based PSCs, “all-polymer” solar cells (all-PSCs), in which the photoactive layers are composed of electron-donating polymer donors and electron-withdrawing polymer acceptors, possess some distinct advantages such as superior thermal stability,11–14 excellent mechanical conformability,15,16 better morphological stability, and outstanding film-forming properties. Considerable efforts including efficient polymeric photovoltaic materials design, efficacious interface engineering, new device solution fabrication methodologies, and novel solar device configurations have been made to achieve all-PSCs.17 Consequently, all-PSCs presented rapidly increased photovoltaic performance and reached PCEs of over 15%,18–23 while still lagging behind the state-of-the-art PSCs made with polymer donors and small molecule acceptors.
Generally, one-step spin-coating,24 brush painting,25 dip-coating,26 blade-coating,27 and roll-to-roll printing28 of the donor and acceptor blend solutions are universal approaches for fabricating PSCs, featuring a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer. The evolution of nanoscale morphology spanning the formation of an interpenetrating network, phase separation, vertical stratification, and crystallization will definitely happen during the solvent volatilization. The BHJ nanoscale morphology, determining charge generation, transportation, extraction, and recombination, plays a key role in photovoltaic performance. The most well-known polymer physics behind vertical stratification, phase separation, and the interpenetrating network of BHJ blend films is the Flory–Huggins theory. Generally, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ thermodynamically controls the vertical stratification and phase separation in BHJ systems.29–31 Polymer donors and polymer acceptors used in all-PSCs usually have long conjugated backbones, same “donor–acceptor (D–A)” type structures, comparable high molecular weight (MW), similar linear geometry configuration, and even comparable solubility in solution-processing solvents and additives. Based on the principle of “like dissolves like”, our previous reports showed that polymer donor and polymer acceptor pairs possess a low χ and good miscibility, corresponding to the strong polymer donor–polymer acceptor interactions when compared with those of polymer donor–fullerene acceptor pairs or polymer donor–small molecule acceptor pairs.32
The lower χ of “all-polymer” systems is beneficial for achieving suppressed phase separation in BHJ films, which is advantageous for exciton dissociation and charge separation at the dispersed interface between the donor domains and acceptor domains. While as shown in Fig. 1a, (i) the lower χ may induce donor nanoscale domains and acceptor nanoscale domains with inevitable and terrible impurity, and thus definitely triggers unfavorable charge recombination; (ii) polymer donor–acceptor pairs with a lower χ usually generates a homogeneously distributed donor/acceptor blend throughout the BHJ film in the vertical direction, and thus certainly has a detrimental effect on the charge extraction or blocking at the corresponding electrodes;32 (iii) as a result of the strong polymer donor–polymer acceptor interactions, in tandem with the entanglement of macromolecular chains in “all-polymer” blend solutions, the crystallization dynamic processes of the donor or acceptor are definitely affected by each other during their solidification, yielding BHJ blend films with reduced crystallinity and causing decreased charge transportation. Generally, the decreased charge transportation and collection, and increased charge recombination in solar devices cause a limited fill-factor (FF) and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). As shown in Fig. 1b, most of the reported binary all-PSCs demonstrated FFs of less than 75%, still largely lagging behind those polymer–fullerene and polymer–small molecule based PSCs with FFs of over 80%.33–35 The limited FF is one of the main problems that results in inefficient all-PSCs with modest PCEs of ca. 15%. Taking into account that the key factor limiting the efficiency of the best performing all-PSCs is often the low FFs, producing high purity and crystalline domains, and the P–i–N heterojunction in the “all-polymer” photoactive layer is of crucial importance in achieving promising photovoltaic performance.

To optimize the nanoscale morphology and improve the FF, tailoring the device solution processing parameters is a meaningful method. Besides the lower χ, the polymer donors and acceptors possess similar solubility in organic solvents or solvent additives, and even similar glass transition temperatures and melting points. Consequently, the morphology of “all-polymer” BHJ blends is difficult to control via tuning the solution processing parameters such as solvent additives, thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing, etc. Taking one of the most successful strategies in fullerene acceptors- or small molecule acceptor-based PSCs as an example, incorporating high boiling point solvent additives in host solvent has been found to be effective in tailoring the BHJ morphology benefitting from the preferential solubility for fullerene acceptors or small molecule acceptors. But the solvent additives didn't work well in altering the BHJ morphology and enhancing the efficiency of “all-polymer” BHJ solar cells. For instance, the benchmark polymer acceptor N2200 reached a high efficiency of over 10% usually in additive-free all-PSCs.36,37 On the other hand, the “all-polymer” BHJ morphology was usually regulated through high-temperature thermal annealing,38 usage of a newly developed third component to form a ternary “all-polymer” BHJ system,20,39,40 and complicated chemical strategies like fluorination,22 side chain engineering,36,41 and molecular weight adjustment,12 which are high investment and full of risk in trial and error. Although with tremendous efforts including materials design and device engineering, the terrible FF is still the major factor that leads to relatively low PCEs. Therefore, establishing effective morphology regulating strategies is of critical importance to boosting the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs.
As an alternative to one-step coating of the donor and acceptor blend solutions, the two-step coating (also known as layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition) of the electron donors and electron acceptors sequentially has been proved to be effective in producing efficient PSCs, featuring favorable P–i–N heterojunctions.42–44 Moreover, previous reports revealed that sequential deposition performs better than one-step coating in tailoring the crystallinity of photovoltaic materials.13,45–47 As shown in Fig. 1a, the favorable P–i–N heterojunction and increased crystallinity of photovoltaic materials are necessary for efficient charge transportation across the photoactive layers and charge collection at electrodes, thus yielding improved FFs.45,48–50 Recently, reports have demonstrated improved performance in LBL all-PSCs with additives and thermal annealing,51,52 indicating the great potential of the LBL method in all-PSCs. Herein, to further demonstrate the superiority of the LBL process and broaden the application of the LBL method in PSCs, the LBL deposition method was used to tune the nanoscale morphology of the “all-polymer” photoactive layer to investigate the intrinsic mechanism of morphological evolutions. Neutron reflectometry (NR) and two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) studies demonstrated that the morphology, especially the vertical distribution and crystallinity of the “all-polymer” photoactive layer, can be finely tailored by tuning the LBL solution processing parameters such as adding the 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive in the polymer acceptor solution. As a result, the LBL all-PSCs made with the benchmark polymeric photovoltaic material PBDT-T/PJ1 reached a remarkable PCE of 16.1%, which is over 10% higher than that of the control BHJ all-PSCs with a PCE of 14.6%. Moreover, the FFs increased from 71.5% for BHJ all-PSCs to 77.3% for LBL all-PSCs. It should be noted that the FF of 77.3% is one of the highest FFs reached in efficient all-PSCs. The polymer physics such as polymer diffusion and molecular self-assembly packing behind the nanoscale morphology evolution of LBL “all-polymer” photoactive layers was also systematically studied.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Material properties

Fig. 2a provides the chemical structures of polymer donors PBDB-T and PBDT-TTz, and a polymer acceptor PJ1, with molecular weight and weight distribution shown in Table S1.† The employed schematic illustration of LBL fabrication procedures for “all-polymer” solar devices in this work is shown in Fig. 2b. The normalized thin film absorption spectra as superimposed in Fig. 2c suggest that the donor polymers (PBDB-T and PBDT-TTz) and acceptor polymer (PJ1) possess perfect complementary photon absorption across the wide wavelength of 400–950 nm, and further propose that the “all-polymer” photoactive layer can harvest the photons efficiently and produce high short-circuit current intensity (JSC) in solar devices. The energy alignment as shown in Fig. 2d indicates that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)- and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)-derived energy offsets between the donor and acceptor are larger than 0.2 eV and thus adequate to boost efficient electron/hole transfer at the donor–acceptor interface.53 Thus, the three polymers PBDB-T, PBDT-TTz, and PJ1 were used as model systems in this concise contribution.

2.2 Morphology regulating strategy design
As stated in prior reports,32,54,55 the vertical stratification, phase separation, interpenetrating network, and diffusion in “all-polymer” systems are largely dependent on the intermolecular interactions, which are usually expressed as the Flory–Huggins parameter χ. Herein, the interaction parameter χ was evaluated by measuring contact angles (θ) and the surface free energies (SFEs, γ). The relevant images of the droplet contact angles (θ) of water and hexadecane on the neat films of PBDB-T, PBDT-TTz, and PJ1 are presented in Fig. 3a, with detailed information of the employed liquids and calculated results summarized in Tables S2 and S3.† Inferred from the contact angles (θ) labelled in Fig. 3a and Owens–Wendt method (calculation details are shown in the ESI†), the SFEs (γ) of PBDB-T, PBDT-TTz, and PJ1 are 26.95, 26.24, and 27.66 mN m−1, respectively. The Flory–Huggins parameter χ was then calculated through the equation of , where K is a positive constant.56 As provided in Fig. 3b, the PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 “all-polymer” systems exhibited χ values of 4.6 × 10−3 K and 1.9 × 10−2 K, respectively. For further comparison, the SFEs of other representative materials including polymer donors, polymer acceptors, small molecule acceptors (SMA) and fullerene acceptors were calculated and are provided in Fig. 3b, and then their interaction parameters χ were evaluated and are provided in Tables S4 and S5.† As shown in Fig. S1 and Table S5,† the PBDB-T/N2200, D18/Y6 and PM6/IT-4F systems possess interaction parameters χ of 5.3 × 10−4 K, 1.1 × 10−2 K, and 4.3 × 10−2 K, respectively. Compared with the fullerene acceptor- and small molecule acceptor-based systems, the “all-polymer” systems showed a lower interaction parameter χ. As stated in the earlier section, the lower χ of “all-polymer” systems and the entanglement of macromolecular chains in “all-polymer” blend solutions, to some extent, can disturb the crystallization dynamic process by each other during their solidification and produce BHJ blend films with reduced crystallinity, impure nanoscale domains and a uniform gradient across the vertical direction. Consequently, the “all-polymer” BHJ solar cells often suffer from the issues of decreased charge transportation and increased charge recombination, which result in an undesirable FF of less than 75%,57 while the high-performing fullerene acceptor- and the small molecule acceptor-based polymer solar cells reached a FF of over 80%.34,35

Based on the aforementioned advantages of LBL deposition and the difficulty of “all-polymer” BHJ morphology control, thus in this work, the “all-polymer” photoactive layers were fabricated through layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition in which the polymer donor and the polymer acceptor underwent solution casting sequentially (see Fig. 2b). Adding solvent additives to BHJ blend solution is considered to be effective in tailoring the BHJ morphology, and it may also work well in regulating the morphology of LBL “all-polymer” solar cells and should be examined. Prior to examining the effect of the CN additive on device performance, first of all, the solubility of the three polymers PJ1, PBDB-T, and PBDT-TTz in the CN additive was tested by adding 2 mg polymers in 0.5 mL CN. As shown in Fig. S2,† CN can totally dissolve the polymers, indicating that the solubility of each polymer in CN is at least 4 mg mL−1. When casting the neat polymer acceptor solution atop the polymer donor layer, the CN additives with a high boiling point (ca. 260 °C) can assist in swelling the underlying polymer donor layer for a longer time, and consequently facilitate the polymer acceptor diffusing into the underlying polymer donor layer and formation of the P–i–N heterojunction.
Secondly, how the LBL processing with the CN additive influences the light absorption was also studied. As seen in Fig. S3,† adding the CN additive in PJ1 solution was found to show a negligible effect on the absorption spectra of the PJ1 neat film (Fig. S3a†), PBDB-T/PJ1 (Fig. S3b†) and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 (Fig. S3c†) LBL photoactive layers. Moreover, the PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL photoactive layers demonstrated similar absorption spectra and identical characteristic absorption peaks to those of the donor and acceptor in neat films. The unchanged characteristic absorption peak of PBDBT, PBDT-TTz and PJ1 in LBL films reveals that PBDBT, PBDT-TTz and PJ1 in LBL films maintain good crystallinity as that of PBDBT, PBDT-TTz and PJ1 in neat films, which is one important advantage of the LBL processed all-PSCs. We have noted that the crystallinity of the donor or acceptor in BHJ blend films is often affected by each other during the one-step coating of their blend solution.46 Based on the above analysis, we could believe that the CN additive assisted LBL deposition is beneficial for achieving more efficient all-PSCs than the one-step coating of the blend solution.
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the superiority of LBL deposition over one-step spin-coating for all-PSCs, LBL- and BHJ-based “all-polymer” solar cells with the same device configuration as that of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active_layer/PDINN/Ag were fabricated and tested. The experimental details and device optimization process, as well as the additional detailed photovoltaic performance are provided in the ESI.†Fig. 4a and b show the current–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, respectively, and the device parameters are provided in Table 1. The optimized PBDB-T:PJ1 BHJ all-PSCs fabricated from previously reported methods demonstrated a decent PCE of 14.6%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V, a FF of 71.5%, and a JSC of 22.5 mA cm−2. While the optimized PBDT-TTz:PJ1 BHJ all-PSCs presented only a modest efficiency of 7.9%, with a VOC of 0.95 V, FF of 61.8% and JSC of 13.4 mA cm−2. Turning to the optimized LBL all-PSCs, (i) PBDT-TTz/PJ1 processed with a 1 vol% CN additive reached PCE as high as 13.1%, representing a stark ca. 1.6 times efficiency improvement over the optimized BHJ devices made with the same photovoltaic materials; (ii) the champion PBDB-T/PJ1 achieved a promising PCE of 16.1%, which is significantly higher than that of the control optimized BHJ all-PSCs with a PCE of only 14.6%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 16.1% is one of the highest efficiencies for binary all-PSCs. In more detail, the optimized BHJ and LBL all-PSCs possessed a comparable VOC of ca. 0.9 V but largely distinctive FF and JSC values. As for the PBDB-T and PJ1 based “all-polymer” systems, FFs increased markedly from 71.5% for BHJ devices to 77.3% for LBL devices. Here we note that the state-of-the-art all-PSCs in previous reports commonly reached FFs of less than 75%, and a FF of 77.3% achieved in this concise study is the highest value reached in high-performing all-PSCs. Turning to another “all-polymer” system composed of PBDT-TTz and PJ1, the two critical parameters the JSC and FF showed noticeable improvement when replacing the BHJ devices with LBL devices, and the FF and JSC improved from 61% and 13.4 mA cm−2 for BHJ all-PSCs to 71.9% and 19.3 mA cm−2 for LBL all-PSCs, respectively. All in all, compared to BHJ all-PSCs, (i) the LBL all-PSCs showed significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance, representing one of the potential advantages of LBL deposition for all-PSCs; (ii) the remarkably improved FFs, to some extent, point out that the favorable nanoscale morphology occurred in LBL devices and the charge recombination has been suppressed (discussed in later sections).

Furthermore, how the CN additive impacts the photovoltaic performance of LBL all-PSCs was also evaluated by screening the content of the CN additive (0 vol%, 0.5 vol%, 1 vol%, 2 vol%, and 3 vol%). The J–V curves and EQE curves are superimposed in Fig. 5 and key parameters are summarized in Table 2. For LBL all-PSCs made with PBDB-T and PJ1, the as-cast (PJ1 without CN) device reached a moderate PCE of 13.2%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, FF of 63.4% and JSC of 24.4 mA cm−2. Incorporating a 0.5 vol% and 1 vol% CN additive in PJ1 solution, the two key parameters FF and VOC increased gradually and significantly to 77.3% and 0.90 V, respectively. Moreover, the JSC still maintained high values of 23–24 mA cm−2. Therefore, the overall efficiency increased to 16.1%, which is also higher than that of the control BHJ reference. When further incorporating more CN additive (2 vol% and 3 vol%) in PJ1 solution, the photovoltaic performance of LBL all-PSCs was found to show a slight decrease, with the JSC, FF, and PCE decreasing gradually to 20.4 mA cm−2, 75.5%, and 14.3%, respectively. The effect of the CN additive was also studied in another “all-polymer” system PBDT-TTz/PJ1 with the corresponding curves and parameters shown in Fig. S8 and Table S10.† Similar photovoltaic performance enhancements were also found in PBDT-TTz/PJ1 based LBL all-PSCs when incorporating 0.5 vol% and 1 vol% CN additive in PJ1 solution. The PCEs increased from 8.4% for the “as cast” devices to 12.7% for the devices with 0.5 vol% CN, and further increased to 13.1% for the optimized all-PSCs with 1 vol% CN, which could be attributed to the significantly and simultaneously increased FF and JSC from 54.7% to 71.9%, and 16.8 mA cm−2 to 19.3 mA cm−2, respectively. Incorporating more CN additive of 2 vol% and 3 vol% in PJ1 solution produced a negative effect on the all-PSCs and yielded a decreased PCE of only 8.6%. As concluded from the CN additive screening experiment, the CN additive was found to have a profound effect on the photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. S9,† (i) the CN additive almost brought a linear increase of VOC for the two “all-polymer” systems, which is beneficial for lowering the energy loss (Eloss = Eming − eVOC, where Eming is the bandgap of the photoactive layer58,59) from 0.57 eV to 0.47 eV and 0.51 eV to 0.47 eV for PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1, respectively; (ii) the optimized CN additive (1 vol%) produced a significantly improved FF, and the PBDB-T/PJ1 based LBL all-PSCs reached a highest FF value of 77.3%, which is the record FF in high-performing binary all-PSCs.

2.4 Morphology studies
The “all-polymer” LBL solar cells processed with different contents of the CN additive yielded significantly distinctive photovoltaic performances. To fully understand the CN additive effect on photovoltaic performance, the evaluation of nanoscale morphologies was performed. When casting the chloroform solution of the polymer acceptor PJ1 atop the PBDB-T or PBDT-TTz films, chloroform can swell the underlying polymeric films and thus PJ1 in chloroform can diffuse into the donor films. As the low boiling point solvent chloroform (Bp. 61 °C) evaporates during the spin-coating process, the high boiling point CN additive (Bp. 260 °C) will become the dominant solvent in the wet film. CN can dissolve the three polymeric materials (see Fig. S2†) and act as a plasticizer, thus prolonging the macromolecules' diffusion, crystallization, phase separation, and thus the formation of a favorable P–i–N heterojunction.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to examine the root mean square (RMS), macromolecules' diffusion and composition at the surface. The AFM height images provided in Fig. S10† suggest that all the LBL active layers of PBDB-T/PJ1 processed with different contents of CN possess a similar and small RMS of less than 2 nm. As for the PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL films, the height images of the representative samples with 0, 1 and 3 vol% CN, as shown in Fig. S11,† exhibited a higher RMS, which could be attributed to the higher interaction parameter. As shown in Fig. S12 and Table S11,† the “as cast” PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL active layers present SFEs (γ) of 27.47 and 27.62 mN m−1, respectively. While turning to the CN (1 vol%) processed LBL active layers, PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 demonstrated decreased SFEs (γ) of 26.94 and 26.83 mN m−1. The decreased SFEs (γ) which are close to the SFEs (γ) of polymer donors suggest that the CN additive can cause more polymer donors at the top surface of the LBL active layer. The surface composition was further verified by XPS analysis and calculating the weight ratios of sulfur/nitrogen (S/N) atoms. As shown in Fig. 6a and Table S21,† the “as-cast” PBDB-T/PJ1 LBL active layer has 82 wt% PJ1 at the top surface. Turning to the CN additive processed PBDB-T/PJ1 LBL active layer, the content of PJ1 at the top surface decreased from 82% for the “as-cast” active layer to 47% for the optimized active layer processed with a 1% CN additive. The decreased PJ1 content at the surface, to some extent, revealed that more PJ1 macromolecules diffuse into the underlying PBDB-T film and more donor/acceptor interfaces are formed (later discussed in NR analysis). On further increasing the CN additive content to 3 vol%, the content of PJ1 at the top surface further decreased to about 30 wt% for both systems. As for another “all-polymer” system PBDT-TTz/PJ1, the CN additive showed a similar effect on the PJ1 macromolecules’ diffusion into the PBDT-TTz layer as shown in Fig. 6b.

From the contact angle measurement and XPS results, it is concluded that the CN additive can cause the polymer donor PBDT-T or PBDT-TTz enrichment at the cathode interface. Commonly, XPS can only detect a thin surface of 6–8 nm of the film that is obviously smaller than the thickness of the active layer which is ∼100 nm. In order to overcome this restriction, neutron reflectometry (NR) was used to examine the vertical composition distribution throughout the LBL active layers. NR measurements were carried out using a multipurpose reflectometer (MR) at the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS, Dongguan, China).60 The measured neutron reflectivity curve is fitted to produce a neutron scattering length density (SLD) profile, and the information about the composition distribution of each active layer is collected in the SLD profiles. SLD indicates the summation of the scattering length and density of each atom throughout the thickness direction of the layer with respect to neutrons. According to the SLD profiles of each LBL film, the volume ratio of the acceptor or donor can be figured out. As shown in Fig. S13,† the SLDs of PBDT-TTz and PJ1 are fitted to be 1.07 × 10−6 Å−2 and 1.19 × 10−6 Å−2, respectively. The SLD for PBDB-T is 1.3 × 10−6 Å−2 taken from our previous studies.32 The fitting produced SLDs of each LBL layer as shown in the inset of Fig. 7a. A common composition structure of PBDT-TTz/PJ1 and PBDB-T/PJ1 LBL films is shown from the SLD profiles. The distance from the substrate to the air in the thickness direction is symbolized as Z. A SiO2 substrate is indicated at Z < 0. An ∼180 Å thick PEDOT:PSS buffer layer on top of SiO2 substrates with Z less than 200 Å. The small differences in the Z value among different samples are due to the different roughnesses of the PEDOT:PSS layer. A more relevant part is the active layer region of the LBL films shown at Z > 200 Å. By fitting the Kiessig fringes in the reflectivity curves, the total thickness of the active layer region of each sample is determined to be 90.5 nm, 95.4 nm, 92.6 nm and 106.5 nm for PBDB-T/PJ1 without CN, PBDB-T/PJ1 with 1 vol% CN, PBDT-TTz/PJ1without CN and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 with 1 vol% CN samples, respectively. The active region contains a bottom donor layer, a top acceptor layer and a middle mixed layer. A hierarchical structure is used as the fitting model to fit all the four samples. Due to the different interdiffusion effects in the middle mixed region, a continuously varied SLD model is used to fulfill the character of the continuously changed donor/acceptor distribution. The simulation gives the best fit using this model, yielding factors of merit (FOM) under 0.1 for all the LBL films, indicating precise film information produced by the fittings.

The individual points and solid lines have been offset for clarity. The corresponding SLD vs. thickness models for LBL films without and with CN are shown in the inset. (b) PJ1 volume ratio of PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL films as a function of the normalized thickness profiles. 
In order to identify the diffusion effect in the middle layer, the acceptor PJ1 ratio was calculated from the SLD profiles in the active layer region (Z > 200 Å). The PJ1 ratio Φa(z) as a function of the normalized Z was determined as follows:  where SLDb(z) is the SLD of the LBL film as a function of thickness, while SLDa and SLDd are the SLDs of the acceptor and donor, respectively. The normalized Z is treated by the division of the active layer thickness Z for each sample.
The acceptor PJ1 as a function of the normalized Z for the active layer is plotted in Fig. 7b. All of the four samples share a similar bottom donor region and the region from the pure donor region to the mixture region at around normalized Z < 0.3. It indicates that CN has a less regulating effect on the bottom part of the active layer. In contrast, CN shows a significant regulating effect on the mixed region and the top acceptor region at normalized Z > 0.3. Both the as prepared PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL films show high PJ1 volume ratios in the top region (the integration of the volume ratio for normalized 1.0 > Z > 0.85 and normalized 1.0 > Z > 0.9 for 0 CN and 1% CN, respectively) which are 76.9 vol% and 90.1 vol%, respectively. After adding CN to each sample, the PJ1 volume ratio is reduced to around 66.2 vol% and 55.5 vol%, respectively, in the same top region. Corresponding to the decrease of the acceptor in the top region, samples with CN show a higher acceptor ratio than those without CN in the mixed region (0.3 < normalized Z < 0.8). This indicates that CN will regulate the acceptor from the top region to the mixed region. Moreover, samples with CN show a longer mixture region (normalized Z = 0.3–0.9) than those without CN (normalized Z = 0.3–0.8), which could result in a continuous charge transport path across the overall active layer. This longer evenly distributed region of the donor and acceptor in the combination of the donor-enriched bottom layer and acceptor-enriched top layer is classed as the P–i–N heterojunction and believed to benefit the hole and electron transportation and extraction at the corresponding electrodes (discussed in the electrical properties part).
As mentioned above, one of the substantial merits of LBL solution process technology is that the overall crystallinity of both the polymer donor and polymer acceptor can be maintained during the solution process. To explore how the LBL solution process can realize high-FF all-PSCs, it is of vital importance to examine the crystallinity and polymer backbone orientation of LBL active layers by 2D GIWAXS. The 2D GIWAXS images, correlated in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) line-cut curves of neat films and LBL films are shown in Fig. S14† and 8. For the PBDB-T and PBDT-TTz neat films, strong diffraction peaks at ≈0.3 Å−1 in the IP direction are observed, suggesting significant face-on orientation in both neat films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns of PJ1 without and with CN are also recorded, and the results show that the crystallinity is not significantly changed, which is in accordance with the absorption results. As for LBL films, a fine face-on orientation was maintained as evidenced by the (100) lamellar peak at ≈0.3 Å−1 and obvious (010) π–π peak at ≈1.7 Å−1. Furthermore, the edge-on orientation trend of PBDB-T in LBL films is remarkably reduced. Barely estimated from the 2D images and the line-cut curves, not too much change could be found in the packing properties between the LBL films without and with CN. For further quantitatively analyzing the packing properties of the LBL films, the crystal size of the domains was estimated by calculating the crystal coherence length (CCL) from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) via the equation CCL = 2πk/FWHM,61 in which k is defined as 0.9. The CCL results are summarized in Table S22.† Interestingly, although more polymer acceptor molecules diffused into the polymer donor layer as the CN content increased, higher CCLs, which point to the improved crystallinity, were obtained for LBL films with 1 vol% CN compared to those of LBL films without CN. These results suggest that the CN-assisted LBL process can not only lead to favorable vertical distribution, but also improve the packing quality of the photoactive layer, which is beneficial for charge transport.

2.5 Electrical properties of LBL devices
In principle, the photovoltaic parameters of a solar device depend on several key processes spanning from the conversion of photons into excitons to the extraction of free carriers. The exciton diffusion and dissociation processes, and the charge transport and extraction are all governed by the active layer morphology including crystallinity, vertical distribution and surface properties. The aforementioned NR and GIWAXS results make clear that the CN assisted LBL deposition can produce favorable photoactive layers featuring thicker interpenetrating regions and improved crystallinity, as well as finely tuned donor/acceptor interfaces. Therefore, we turn to examine the exciton dissociation, charge transport and extraction to unearth the superiority of LBL deposition for all-PSCs.
Firstly, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching analyses were performed to directly study the exciton dynamics in PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL systems. The PL spectra of neat films of PBDB-T, PBDT-TTz, and PJ1, as well as their LBL films without and with 1% CN are shown in Fig. S15.† For characteristic emission of donor domains, when excited at 550 nm, all LBL films showed high PL quenching efficiencies of over 95%. Turning to the characteristic emission of acceptor domains that were excited at 800 nm (see Fig. S15b and d†), the PL intensities were slightly suppressed when adding a 1 vol% CN additive in PJ1 solution, and the PL quenching efficiencies reached 96% and 83% in the optimized PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBLs. The increased and higher PL quenching efficiencies do emphasize the efficient charge transfer between the donor and acceptor domains due to the formation of a P–i–N heterojunction.
Secondly, the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties were measured and quantitatively analyzed by voltage dependent charge extraction. The photocurrent density (Jph) versus internal voltage (Vint) curves and key parameters are shown in Fig. S16 and Table S23.† The definition and calculation details of the correlated Jph and Vint are provided in the ESI.† For the PBDB-T/PJ1 system, all curves demonstrate a quickly increased Jph and saturation regime after Vint > 0.3 V. As shown in Fig. 9a and Table S23,† the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) are simultaneously enhanced to 97.8% and 88.4% as the CN content increased from 0 vol% to 1 vol%. And for PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL devices with an optimized CN ratio (1%), the ηdiss and ηcoll increased significantly to large values of 95.5% and 84.0%, suggesting that efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection occurred in devices, which is in close accordance with the significantly enhanced FF from 54.7% to 71.9%.

(b) Statistics of charge mobilities measured by the SCLC method; hole-only devices: color filled chart and electron only device: patterned line filled chart. 
Thirdly, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was used to investigate the charge mobilities of the LBL films, and the corresponding J1/2–V fitting curves and calculated parameters (Fig. S17 and Table S24†) are provided in the ESI.† For direct comparison of the charge mobilities, the hole and electron mobilities are depicted as histograms in Fig. 9b. As shown in Fig. 9b, PBDB-T/PJ1 and PBDT-TTz/PJ1 based devices processed without CN exhibited rather modest hole and electron mobilities. Turning to the LBL devices processed with CN additives, the hole and electron mobilities were found to show significant increments. The hole mobility of PBDB-T/PJ1 reached a maximum value of 15.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 under the optimized condition (1 vol% CN). The electron mobility in PBDB-T/PJ1 increased gradually when increasing the CN ratio, indicating that the interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) and thus the favorable charge pathways are formed. For the PBDT-TTz/PJ1 system, the hole and electron mobilities presented a similar evolution pattern as that of the PBDB-T/PJ1 system and reached the largest values of 14.5 × 10−4 and 9.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the optimized devices (1 vol% CN), respectively. The higher hole and electron mobilities as well as the more balanced charge transport are well consistent with the highest FFs that were reached in the LBL devices (1 vol% CN).
Last but not least, charge recombination has long been considered to play a detrimental role in producing efficient all-PSCs. The JSC and VOCversus light intensity (I) characteristics were measured. JSC ∝ Iα and  were used to fit the bimolecular and trap-assisted charge recombination losses, respectively. As shown in Fig. S18a,† the exponential factor α for PBDB-T/PJ1 devices with different CN contents is in the range of 0.97–0.98 and is close to unity, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is negligible in LBL devices. A similar α value of 0.98 and negligible bimolecular recombination were also reached in the optimized PBDT-TTz/PJ1 LBL devices (Fig. S19a†). The suppressed bimolecular recombination, which can be attributed to the P–i–N heterojunction induced unobstructed carrier transportation under open circuit conditions, represents the universal superiority of LBL devices over BHJ devices. Turning to the examination of trap-assisted charge recombination, the optimized PBDB-T/PJ1 LBL devices (1 vol% CN) exhibit a parameter n of 1.1, which inclines to the trap-free condition (n = 1) and suggests that the trap-assisted recombination is negligible. As for the PBDT-TTz/PJ1 system, the parameter n decreased significantly from 1.5 for the pristine device to 1.2 for the optimized devices (1 vol% CN). Generally, the significantly decreased parameter n suggests that the trap-assisted charge recombination is suppressed considerably, arising from the good crystallinity of the LBL photoactive layer induced by the CN additive. Concluding from the device electrical property examinations, the optimized LBL devices demonstrate efficient charge separation, transportation and collection, in tandem with supressed charge recombination losses, which contribute to the highest and record FFs of 77.3% in all-polymer solar cells.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that a promising CN additive assisted layer-by-layer deposition can fabricate high performance all-polymer solar cells reaching an efficiency of over 16%. Our systematic solar cell optimizations show that the CN additive in polymer acceptor solution has beneficial effects on photovoltaic performance. The PCEs of the benchmark “all-polymer” system PBDB-T/PJ1 based LBL devices increased from 13.2% for the “as-cast” devices to 16.1% for the optimized devices (1 vol% CN), along with increasing FFs from 63.4% to 77.3%. Importantly, the LBL all-polymer solar cells are shown to outperform their BHJ device counterparts. The champion PBDB-T/PJ1 LBL devices reached a PCE of 16.1% and FF of 77.3%, while the optimized PBDB-T:PJ1 BHJ solar cells obtained a lower PCE of 14.6% and an inferior FF of 71.5%. The superiority of LBL devices over the BHJ devices was also found in another efficient “all-polymer” system PBDT-TTz/PJ1 (PCE: 13.1% for LBL devices and 7.9% for BHJ devices). The NR and GIWAXS studies make clear that: (i) the morphology of the photoactive layers can be finely regulated via simply tailoring the LBL solution processing parameters such as the CN additive in this work and (ii) the favorable P–i–N heterojunction and improved molecular packing were obtained concurrently in the optimized “all-polymer” LBL devices. As a result of the beneficial morphology of LBL photoactive layers, the LBL devices were confirmed by electrical property studies to embrace a wide range of superiorities including (i) efficient charge separation at donor/acceptor interfaces, (ii) increased charge collection at electrodes, (iii) higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities across the devices, and (iv) suppressed bimolecular and trap-assisted charge recombination losses in devices. Those superiorities contribute to a high efficiency of 16.1% and FF of 77.3%. Here we note that the FF of 77.3% is one of the highest FFs reached in efficient all-PSCs. Considering the strong intermolecular interaction of the polymer donor–polymer acceptor and thus the extremely complicated morphology control, the layer-by-layer solution processing methodology provides a meaningful means of regulating the morphology of “all-polymer” active layers and achieving high performance all-polymer solar cells.
