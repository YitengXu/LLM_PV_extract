    , Accepted 10th July 2017First published on 25th July 2017AbstractDebate remains about potentially occuring non-selective C–H activation during the direct arylation polycondensation of monomers with more than two C–H bonds. Non-selective reactions with dihalides lead to undesirable kinking, branching and cross-linking of conjugated polymer chains, and thus to severe deviations of all opto-electronic properties. Using thiophene–benzothiadiazole–thiophene (TBT) having four different C–H bonds and its popular copolymer with dibromocarbazole, PCDTBT, as an example, we demonstrate that unselective C–H activation, often referred to as “β-arylation”, does not occur under typical polycondensation reactions. However, using extreme stoichiometries, i.e. a large excess of halide, model reactions reveal that in addition to the typical α-C–H activation of TBT, γ-arylation takes place. This reaction is also seen in polymer analogous reactions of PCDTBT. If γ-arylation of PCDTBT is mimicked using Suzuki polycondensation with tribrominated TBT, the reaction yield drops significantly, the charge transfer absorption band is blued-shifted and solar cell performance of the corresponding PCBM blends is reduced drastically through both a reduction in short circuit current and fill factor. While many reports have meanwhile shown that direct arylation polymerization can be employed to make well-defined conjugated polymers, this paper demonstrates that (i) unselective arylation of thiophene-based monomers is very unlikely for stoichiometry reasons, (ii) how branching can be identified in donor–acceptor copolymers on a spectroscopic basis and (iii) how the optoelectronic properties change if branching still takes place.
Introduction
Direct arylation polycondensation (DAP) is an emerging polymerization method enabling straightforward, low-cost and versatile preparation of conjugated polymers and has therefore seen tremendous scientific activity within the past few years.1–4 The often cited major advantages of DAP compared to traditional polycondensation reactions such as Stille and Suzuki Polycondensation (SPC) are fewer reactions steps, use of non-toxic and stable substrates that do not rely on stannanes or Grignards, and consequently reduced metal contamination in the resulting material.5,6 A variety of DAP protocols have been reported and a great copolymer portfolio has been prepared via DAP.1–4,7–13 However, undesired side reactions, especially such as homocoupling reactions or unselective C–H activation are topic of ongoing debate. Once formed, such defect structures are covalently incorporated into the polymer backbone and cannot be removed afterwards. Several examples of conjugated polymers made by DAP that contain homocoupling defects are meanwhile known,2,14–19 demonstrating the major need for detailed synthetic optimizations accompanied by a profound analysis of molecular structure and backbone integrity. However, while the role of homocoupling reactions is meanwhile attracting more and more attention, the role of branching reactions arising from unselective C–H activation is much less clear. Initial studies have mentioned the possibility of unselective C–H activation as major source of defects and insoluble material.20–23 However, direct spectroscopic evidence remains rare. Mass spectrometry of products from model reactions have been used to identify triple C–H activation in C–H substrates used for polycondensation.20 Notably, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the very few systems for which the so-called β-arylation, i.e. the unselective C–H activation of thiophene at the 3-position, has been determined on an NMR spectroscopic basis.24 Also, studies involving P3HT with intentional branches demonstrated reduced performance compared to linear analogs.25 In accordance, branched P3HT made by DAP arising from unselective C–H arylation shows altered electronic properties and negatively changed photovoltaic characteristics as investigated in detail by Rudenko et al.26 Surprisingly, unselective C–H activation has not yet been reported for the most successful class of conjugated donor–acceptor polymers. It also needs to be mentioned that meanwhile several donor–acceptor copolymers have been prepared by DAP that show identical properties compared to their analogs made by classical cross coupling, implicitly indicating that thiophene-based monomers exhibit the required α-selectivity.10,17,27,28 This concerns also PCDTBT made from TBT and dibromocarbazole via DAP.28 Next to α-selectivities of thiophene-based substrates, concerns have been raised with carbazole being activated at the 2,7-positions.20,22,23 However, whether or not this is true for all substrates and DAP reaction conditions still needs to be clarified, for which detailed model and analytical studies are necessary. In this context it is noteworthy that the spectroscopic determination of a few percent of defective units remains a major challenge, especially if high-temperature NMR spectroscopy is necessary to overcome the limited solubility of conjugated polymers and obtain narrow signals, which restricts methods mostly to less time-consuming 1H NMR experiments.
Here, we use the widely employed 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TBT) building block, a central monomer unit in various high-performance copolymers, to investigate possibilities for its unselective C–H activation under typical DAP conditions. We show that by using a 1:1 stoichiometry of monomers, full selectivity of the desired α-position takes place, leading to exclusively linear chains. Interestingly, instead of frequently mentioned β-arylation we find γ-arylation (Scheme 1). However, this side reaction only occurs when a large excess of the halide monomer is used. When branched PCDTBT is intentionally made via Suzuki polycondensation (SPC) using tribrominated TBT, polymer yield is reduced drastically, UV-vis spectra strongly blue-shift and photovoltaic performance of PCDTBT:PCBM devices tremendously decreases with increasing branching density due to both reduced short circuit currents as well as decreased fill factors.

Results and discussion
Many popular C–H monomers used in DAP exhibit more than two C–H bonds.1–4 While some trends for the reactivities of different C–H bonds in one monomer are known from density functional theory calculations,14,28,29 it is not clear whether for a given structure and for a given set of reaction parameters a certain probability for unselective C–H activation remains. Clearly, the α-C–H bond of thiophene-based monomers, which are used most often, is most reactive as a result of precoordination to palladium eventually combined with other factors.29 However, electronic and steric effects arising within individual structures, induced by e.g. adjacent acceptors, fused structures or heteroatom effects, can change this situation. Spectroscopic evidence for unselective side reactions during DAP is very rare and, if at all, available from model reactions.20 Poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, is an exception for which “β-arylation” has been identified with model compounds and been shown to occur under certain conditions.24,26 Still, with many unsubstituted thienyl-substituted monomers being used, further side reactions may be possible next to “β-arylation” (Scheme 1). If present, unselective C–H activation occurs to very low extent making its spectroscopic investigation challenging. One strategy that has been proposed to entirely eliminate β-arylation is methylation of the respective protons.30 While this strategy excludes the possibility for undesired side reactions a priori, it adds complexity to chemical synthesis and also changes the electronic properties of the conjugated backbone through the introduction of torsion, with the latter of which being commonly an undesired property for application in photovoltaic cells or field-effect transistors.31
To address the general issue of analyzing unselective C–H activation, we reacted TBT with 3.5 equivalents of p-bromotoluene or 2-bromocarbazole (Cbz-Br) as a model reaction under common DAP conditions. The main product was found to be the disubstituted TBT (tol2TBT) along with a few percent of monosubstituted TBT (tolTBT), while trisubstituted TBT was not found (Scheme 1). This result already indicates that a moderate excess of halide, as might be present unintentionally in a polycondensation reaction with non-optimal stoichiometry, does not cause triple substitution of the C–H monomer. With the same argument, so-called “kinking”, i.e. unselective C–H activation prior to α-C–H activation, is similarly unlikely. However, further reacting purified tol2TBT with 3.5 eq. p-bromotoluene under the same conditions led to the formation of tol3TBT in 16% yield. Interestingly, contrary to the common opinion of β-arylation being one possible side reaction, the third tolyl substituent is attached at the γ-position. The structure of tol3TBT was confirmed by 1D and 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. SI-1 and SI-2†) as well as by mass spectrometry (Fig. SI-3†). Traces of tol4TBT were also found (Fig. SI-4†).
The analogous reaction was performed with CbzBr to mimic possible side reactions in the synthesis of PCDTBT and to generate a model compound Cbz3TBT, which helps to assign chemical shifts of branched PCDTBT. Under the same conditions as for tol3TBT, significant amounts of Cbz3TBT were found as well. Its structure could be fully confirmed by 1D and 2D 1H NMR methods (Fig. SI-5 and SI-6†). Fig. 1a and b show the 1H NMR spectra of tol3TBT and Cbz3TBT. Most significant and important is the singlet of the proton of the thiophene unit carrying three substituents. Its chemical shift proofs that the benzothiadiazole unit is not directly neighbored, which is confirmed by ROESY correlations to an ortho-proton of the residue R2 (Fig. SI-2 and SI-6†). It should be mentioned that the chemical shift of the methyl group of the tolyl residues is sensitive of the type of thiophene substitution (α- or γ-substitution). Using density functional theory, Bura et al. have investigated α-/β-selectivities of a range of monomers with P(Me)3 as ligand, but did not consider the reactivity of γ-C–H bonds.32 Considering the major importance of different aryl phosphines alone for the C–H reactivity of thiophenes,33,34 it appears that predictions on the C–H selectivity may also be influenced by the catalytic system. For what factors cause preferential γ-substitution over β-substitution of TBT, further studies need to investigate the influence of the adjacent electron accepting benzothiadiazole exerting reduced steric interactions as compared to e.g. dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole17 or naphthalene diimide.27 To obtain a complete picture, additional steric interactions by branched side chains typically present in D–A–D monomers but not in TBT could further influence C–H selectivity and hence should be considered.

Having identified γ-arylation of TBT under extreme stoichiometries, we turned to the question whether or not β- and γ-C–H bonds are more reactive in the polymer compared to the monomer, which could lead to side reactions at late stages of polycondensation, provided that a sufficiently large amount of halide is left in the reaction mixture. While such experiments are difficult to conduct on a quantitative basis, we approached this question by reacting a linear, partially phenyl-terminated PCDTBT made by SPC with 5 eq. of p-bromotoluene or Cbz-Br (Scheme 2). Partially phenylated PCDTBT was chosen intentionally as a precursor with many β- and γ-protons, but few remaining α-protons. In this way not only the possibility for a polymer analogous C–H activation reaction can be investigated but also the reactivity of a small concentration of α-C–H can be captured.
 Scheme 2  Polymer analogous reaction of partially phenyl-terminated PCDTBT with monobrominated toluene or carbazole under direct arylation conditions. 
The resulting polymers are referred to as H/Ph-PCDTBT-Ph/H, PCDTBT-γ-tol and PCDTBT-γ-Cbz, and the corresponding 1H NMR spectra are shown in Fig. 2a–c, respectively. After the polymer analogous reaction, all TBT-H end groups were replaced by either tolyl or Cbz residues. To proof whether or not γ-arylation took place, 1H chemical shifts for a possible singlet from proton 1′ were estimated based on the 1H substitution effect observed for tol3TBT and Cbz3TBT, respectively (δ(H1′) vs. δ(H1); +0.06 ppm for tol, +0.23 ppm for Cbz in C2D2Cl4 at 120 °C). Considering these effects for H1 of PCDTBT (red arrows in Fig. 2b and c) a prevalent thiophene singlet resulting from γ-tol or γ-Cbz branching cannot be seen. However, for PCDTBT-γ-tol, a new methyl signal at a chemical shift expected from the model compound tol3TBT points to γ-tol branching (see blue arrow in Fig. 2b). Keeping in mind that the corresponding thiophene singlet has only one third of the intensity of the signal of the methyl group, it is obvious that identification of the thiophene singlet is challenging. The case of PCDTBT-γ-Cbz is yet more difficult due to the absence of the methyl group. Fig. 2c might suggest that for steric reasons γ-branching is yet less intense in PCDTBT-γ-Cbz. Thus, from the detailed NMR analysis the following conclusions can be made: (i) partial phenyl-termination of the linear PCDTBT precursor material (Fig. 2a) is instrumental to distinguish between tolyl-residues at TBT chain ends and γ-tol, (ii) α-protons, i.e. the remaining α-C–H bonds of TBT end groups react quantitatively with Br-tol or Cbz-Br (Fig. 2b and c), (iii) additional C–H activation of γ-protons within the backbone is challenging to see from the aromatic region only, even using substituent chemical shifts determined from the trisubstituted model compounds, and (iv) considering the methyl region for PCDTBT-γ-tol provides evidence that unselective C–H activation in the form of γ-arylation occurs when using a large excess of halide. These results suggest the possible formation of branched γ-defect structures under DAP conditions, but if at all only if a very large excess of the halide is present. Assuming an ideal 1:1 stoichiometry which is attempted in most cases for DAP, γ-substitution can be considered to be absent.

To further corroborate these results, we employed MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry as an additional method. Fig. 3 shows the MALDI ToF mass spectra of the partially phenyl-capped PCDTBT together with the products PCDTBT-γ-tol and PCDTBT-γ-Cbz, obtained from the polymer analogous direct arylation with Br-tol and Cbz-Br, respectively. While certainly these MALDI spectra do not show the true molecular weight distribution as a result of fractionation, significant changes can be observed that are fully consistent with the results from NMR spectroscopy. H/Ph-PCDTBT-H/Ph shows signals at m/z = 2407, 2482 and 2559 which can be assigned to the trimer with H/H, H/Ph, and Ph/Ph chain termini, respectively. In the MALDI-ToF mass spectrum of PCDTBT-γ-tol the H/H, H/Ph-termini are replaced by tol/tol- (m/z = 2585) and tol/Ph-termini (m/z = 2572), as already seen by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, a new signal group is seen between m/z = 2650 and 2676, which has masses of Ph/Ph, Ph/tol and tol/tol-terminated trimers plus one tolyl group (Fig. 3a, marked with asterisks). These new signals can only be explained by considering the additional reaction of Br-tol with the conjugated backbone. With reference to the results of the model reactions (Scheme 1) and NMR spectroscopy, this additional reaction must take place at the γ-position of the thiophene unit in PCDTBT. A similar MALDI-ToF mass spectrum but with the additional mass of a Cbz instead of a tolyl substituent is found for PCDTBT-γ-Cbz (Fig. 3b). Ph/Cbz and Cbz/Cbz terminated trimers are seen at m/z = 2886 and m/z = 3213, respectively. Peaks of branched chains with an additional Cbz unit are seen at m/z = 2588, m/z = 2963 and m/z = 3290 (marked with asterisks, for the entire MALDI-ToF spectra of PCDTBT-γ-tol and PCDTBT-γ-Cbz see also Fig. SI-5†). The relative intensities of the signal groups of linear and PCDTBT-γ-tol/PCDTBT-γ-Cbz are similar, with the PCDTBT-γ-tol and PCDTBT-γ-Cbz peak series being between 10–20% intensity of the linear series.

To summarize, unselective C–H activation of backbone protons of linear PCDTBT under polymer analogous DAP conditions using a large excess of a halide can be demonstrated by a combination of 1H NMR and MALDI-ToF MS. However, by considering the very low intensities of additional 1H NMR signals of PCDTBT with trisubstituted TBT units and that Br-tol has been used in large excess, we can rule out this side reaction as a source of main chain defects under typical, stoichiometric DAP conditions.
To further investigate the effect of branched defects structures on absorption and emission features as well as on OPV device performance, we synthesized a series of PCDTBT samples with intentionally incorporated branches using SPC of tribrominated TBT. Importantly, bromination of TBT with an excess of NBS leads to tribrominated TBT (Br3TBT) with the third bromine function being in γ-position as well. Branched PCDTBT, referred to as b-PCDTBT was prepared by SPC in the presence of 4%, 10% and 20% Br3TBT in the feed ratio using Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst, for which we recently evidenced a strictly alternating, defect-free backbone sequence (Scheme 3).35 A 1:1 ratio of respective functional groups was carefully considered. A significant amount of insoluble material was obtained already for the lowest amount of Br3TBT of 4%, indication a substantial drop in solubility and suggesting crosslinking for already low contents of Br3TBT. Low yields of the CHCl3 fractions of 11, 16, and 6% with Mn,SEC molecular weights of 7.1, 3.6 and 4.3 kg mol−1 were obtained for 4, 10 and 20% Br3TBT, respectively. Quantification and correlation of the feed ratio with incorporated γ-Cbz branches was not possible. Bromine chain termini which are detrimental to device performance36 were not found, which is consistent with linear PCDTBT made by SPC.37 The absorption and emission spectra of the individual samples are shown in Fig. 4. The profiles exhibit a hypsochromic shift, a decrease in the intramolecular charge transfer (CT) band absorption intensity as well as in the optical band gap Eg,opt, likely resulting from an increased backbone torsion compared to linear PCDTBT due to additional steric stress.38 From the onset of absorption, values for Eg,opt were 1.81, 1.82, 184 and 1.93 eV for 0, 4, 10 and 20% Br3TBT, respectively. The weakening of the CT band correlates well with the feed ratio of Br3TBT. The intensity of photoluminescence of b-PCDTBT approx. triples compared to linear PCDTBT, and also shows a hypsochromic shift by ∼18 nm with no clear trend with respect to branching density. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) was found to strongly increase upon introduction of branching defects. While defect-free PCDTBT exhibits 18% PLQE in chlorobenzene solution, the b-PCDTBT samples show a PLQE around 50% (4% feed ratio: 54.5%; 10% feed ratio: 51.8%; 20% feed ratio: 48.2%).

A deteriorated OPV device performance upon incorporated branching defects is clearly seen. While the Voc stays mostly unaffected upon incorporation of a small amount of branching defect structures, the Jsc gradually decreased with increasing defect density. Additionally, device performance is degenerated due to a considerably reduced fill factor resulting in an almost halved power conversion efficiency (PCE) upon incorporation of 4% branching defects only. However, PCDTBT molecular weight is a crucial parameter for OPV performance as well.31,35,42 The Mn,SEC values the three branched samples are 7.1, 3.6 and 4.3 kg mol−1 in comparison to Mn,SEC = 8.1 kg mol−1 of the reference. Thus, we note that molecular weight of the reference is generally higher, however on comparing the similar Mn,SEC of b-PCDTBT-4 (7.1 kg mol−1) to that of the reference (8.1 kg mol−1) in combination with similar UV-vis absorption profiles, it is evident that the much decreased short circuit current and fill factor can be ascribed to the branching defect. We assume that the branching unit exerts torsion on the polymer backbone, which limits conjugation length.31,38 In line with this explanation is the strongly increased photoluminescence of b-PCDTBT-4 compared to the PCDTBT reference. Possibly, increased backbone torsion causes smaller conjugation lengths and limited transport as compared to the linear and defect-free PCDTBT.43 These results provide a clear-cut demonstration that if branching occurs during the synthesis of conjugated polymers via DAP, the optoelectronic properties strongly change and device performance can be severely deteriorated.
Conclusion
This paper has analyzed the possibility of unselective C–H activation during the synthesis of the photovoltaic absorber material PCDTBT via DAP.39 By using the monomer TBT as well as linear PCDTBT as examples, we have demonstrated selective reactivity of the TBT's α-protons under typical and meanwhile established direct arylation reaction condition. If the α-position is blocked, further C–H activation of much less reactive γ-C–H bonds is only possible if a large excess of halide is used. β-Arylation does however not occur, indicating that all C–H bonds need to be considered in donor–acceptor–donor monomers. This spectroscopic characterization of the resulting branched structural motifs is very challenging but possible using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-ToF MS. Under typical 1:1 stoichiometric conditions used for polycondensation, unselective C–H activation does not occur. Finally, we have synthesized intentionally γ-branched PCDTBT using Suzuki polycondensation and could demonstrate the effects on optical properties and photovoltaic performance. UV-vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy show the changes as expected for a branched structure with increased torsion and a reduced propensity for aggregation. OPV performance is drastically reduced due to reduced short circuit currents and fill factors. We assume that the general selectivity for α-C–H bonds in thiophene monomers is sufficient to furnish linear copolymers, but whether or not this is indeed true for all copolymers made by DAP and for the particular reaction conditions under scrutiny will remain a case-to-case study. An interesting aspect of this study is also the possibility for polymer analogous C–H activation. If backbone C–H activation is to be employed for further intentional functionalization of conjugated polymers to e.g. modulate photoluminescence, probably more selective and reactive catalysts must be used.
