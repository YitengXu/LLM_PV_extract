    , Accepted 26th November 2014First published on 28th November 2014AbstractThe facile hydrothermal synthesis of rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays on FTO substrates without the use of acids has been developed. The morphology of the nanorods can be finely tuned by changing the growth parameters, and the potential of the as-made rutile TiO2 nanorods in perovskite solar cells was evaluated, showing power conversion efficiencies up to 11.1%.
Since the first attempt in sensitized solar cells by Miyasaka in 2009 (ref. 1), organolead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention in solar cells because of their extremely low fabrication cost and fairly high power conversion efficiency in various configurations.2–11 These cells can be made using different hole transport materials (HTM)12–17 and electron transport materials (ETM)18–22 with efficiencies up to 19.3%.23 Mesoporous TiO2 is the most widely used n-type semiconductor as an ETM and scaffold layer for most dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)24 and a large portion of perovskite solar cells.1,3a,4,6a,7,9,11–15,20 However, pore filling of the active layer is always a difficult problem for the mesoporous structure.25 One dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials may solve this problem owing to their unique open porous structure. In another way, the direct channel in 1D materials may transport photogenerated electrons more efficiently and have lower recombination than the mesoscopic structure.26 TiO2 nanorods (NRs),27,28 nanocones (NCs),29 nanofibers (NFs),30 and ZnO NRs31–34 were studied in perovskite solar cells, achieving conversion efficiency approaching 12%.29
1D TiO2 nanostructures [e.g., NRs, NCs or nanotubes (NTs)] can be synthesized through a variety of methods such as metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),35 electrochemically anodizing,36 and hydrothermal/solvothermal methods.37–40 In particular, hydrothermal synthesis is a low-temperature, facile approach without the requirement of expensive devices, which is suitable for mass industrial production. For the hydrothermal synthesis of TiO2 NRs, Ti precursors are usually used in water or organic solutions under very strong acidic conditions.37–39,41,42 This strong activity of the solution, however, can cause crystal dissolution. When growth is carried out for a relative long time, the aligned TiO2 nanorods will peel off from the substrate in some cases.38 In addition, strong acids will restrict their applications, increase the equipment cost and even cause environmental damage.
We report a facile method for the hydrothermal synthesis of tightly packed rutile TiO2 NRs in very mild solutions with pH at 4.9–5.5, without the use of strong acids. The morphology of the as-made TiO2 NRs, including the diameter, length and density, can be well controlled by adjusting the synthetic parameters such as the growth time and the initial reactant concentration. The as-made TiO2 NRs were further evaluated as electron transport material in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, yielding power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 11.1%, showing promise as solar cell materials.
Microstructure characterization
The hydrothermal synthesis of rutile TiO2 NRs was based on the hydrolysis reaction of glycerol modified titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) in the Na2EDTA aqueous solution.29 Typically, the hydrothermal process was conducted at 190 °C for 3 h in an aqueous solution containing 10.0 μl ml−1 TTIP, 100 mM Na2EDTA and 2.5 vol% glycerol. The pH of the synthesis medium was 4.9–5.5, as determined by the Na2EDTA concentration. To reveal the crystal structure of as-made TiO2 NRs, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was measured, as shown in Fig. 1a. The XRD peaks at 36.02°, 54.40° and 62.74° were assigned to the (101), (211) and (002) planes, respectively, agreeing with the tetragonal rutile phase (JCPDS 65-0192). Similar to the reported results,37,38 the (002) XRD peak intensity was much higher than the others, indicating the NRs are highly oriented to the substrate along the [001] direction. Fig. 1b displays the Raman spectrum of the as-prepared TiO2 NRs with bands at 242, 442 and 609 cm−1, respectively, further confirming the rutile phase of the as-prepared TiO2 NRs.43 The TEM image in Fig. 1c is a bundle of TiO2 NRs peeled off from the FTO substrate. The NRs are 20–40 nm thick in diameter. However, high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 1d) showed that each NR was composed of ultrathin, single crystalline nanowire subunits growing along the (110) crystal plane with a preferred [001] orientation. Lattice fringes with interplanar spacings d110 = 0.33 nm and d001 = 0.28 nm are consistent with the rutile phase (inset in Fig. 1d).

Effect of the growth time
To determine the growth process of TiO2 NRs, the as-made TiO2 NRs were examined in detail by SEM, showing the evolution of the NRs with growth variations, as shown in Fig. 2. After keeping the reaction vessel at 190 °C for 1 h, the surface of the substrate was dotted with tiny TiO2 NRs, leaving a large area exposed to the outside. After one more 1 hour, the small NRs grew much larger to distinct tetragonal NRs with a diameter of ∼30 nm at a relatively low density. As the growth time was further increased to 5 h, both the diameter and density of the NRs were increased apparently and progressively, even part of the NRs was observed to stick together after a 5 h reaction. When the growth time was extended further to 12 h, the sample was found to be a complete dense film without obviously resolved pores. The cross section view of the SEM image for the typical TiO2 NR film with a 3 h growth time is shown in Fig. 2g. Vertical TiO2 NRs with a length of ∼700 nm and a diameter of ∼50 nm were closely packed on the FTO substrate, which was ideal for the use as an ETM and scaffold in the perovskite photovoltaic devices.28
 Fig. 2  SEM images of TiO2 NRs synthesized at different growth time: (a) 1 h, (b) 2 h, (c) 3 h, (d) 4 h, (e) 5 h, (f) 12 h and (g) the cross section view of (c). The growth solution contained 10.0 μl ml−1 (∼33.0 mM) TTIP, 100 mM Na2EDTA, and 2.5 vol% glycerol. 

Fig. 3a shows the relationship between the growth time and the thickness of the NR film. During the first 2 h of the reaction, the growth rate was only ∼120 nm h−1. In the following hour, the growth rate increased rapidly to ∼420 nm h−1. This may be because the NRs have become much denser after the first 2 h growth, and steric hindrance suppressed growth along the radial direction, while growth along the axial direction was preferred. With the consumption of the initial reactant, the growth rate of the NRs declined slowly with further increases in reaction time (over 4 h). The NRs with a length of ∼1.2 μm were finally obtained in 5 h.
 Fig. 3  Effect of different synthesis parameters on the thickness of TiO2 NR films: (a) growth time, (b) volume fraction of glycerol in aqueous solution, (c) concentration of TTIP and (d) concentration of Na2EDTA. The standard growth parameters of NRs were 3 h reaction time, 2.5 vol% glycerol, 10.0 μl ml−1 TTIP, and 100 mM Na2EDTA. Only one variant was changed in each case. 
Effect of glycerol
Glycerol was mixed with TTIP before adding DI water and Na2EDTA. The resulting turbid aqueous solution turned clear and transparent after heating at 70 °C and stirring for about 1 h. In the absence of glycerol or at low glycerol concentrations (below 2.5 vol%), however, the mixed solution remained turbid even after heating and stirring violently for several hours. This is possibly because the presence of glycerol can retard the hydrolysis of TTIP. As a result, at higher glycerol concentrations (5.0–10.0 vol%), the growth rate of NRs was decreased, leading to slightly smaller diameter and density of NRs after 3 h of the hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 3b and 4a–c).
 Fig. 4  SEM images of TiO2 NRs synthesized with different concentrations of the initial reactant: (a–c) 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 vol% glycerol in growth solution; (d–f) 7.5, 12.5 and 15.0 μl ml−1 TTIP; (g–i) 50, 60 and 75 mM Na2EDTA; (j–l) cross section view of (g–i). The standard growth parameters of NRs were 3 h reaction time, 2.5 vol% glycerol, 10.0 μl ml−1 TTIP, and 100 mM Na2EDTA. Only one variant was changed in each case. 
Effect of TTIP
There is no doubt that the concentration of Ti sources can have an important impact on the growth of TiO2 NRs. Both the length and diameter of the NRs increased with increasing concentration of TTIP in the synthesis solution. Fig. 3c shows an almost linear relationship between the lengths of the NRs and concentration of TTIP in a range of 7.5–15.0 μl ml−1 (24.7–49.4 mM). Moreover, the density of the NRs is affected significantly by varying the TTIP concentration (Fig. 4d–f). When 15 μl ml−1 of TTIP was used, many NRs began to stick together from the top, which is unsuitable for solar cell applications.
Effect of Na2EDTA
Na2EDTA is a widely-used reagent with very strong coordination ability to metal irons that can increase the solubility and suppress some reactions, such as the hydrolysis of TTIP. In the absence of Na2EDTA, the mixed solution remained turbid similar to the condition without glycerol mentioned above. At relatively low Na2EDTA concentrations (25 mM), although a clear and transparent solution was formed subject to heating and stirring violently for 1 h, no NRs were obtained on the FTO substrate after the hydrothermal reaction for 3 h (Fig. S1†). When the concentration of Na2EDTA was increased to 50 mM, very long TiO2 NRs (∼1.8 μm, Fig. 4g and j) were formed on the FTO substrate after 3 h of reaction. Further increases in the concentration of Na2EDTA reduced the length of the NRs, as evidenced by the negative relationship between them (Fig. 3d). Because of this, the length can be tuned easily without apparently changing the density and diameter of the NRs (Fig. 4g–l). This is probably because the EDTA could preferentially adsorb on the (110) surfaces and slow down the growth rate of NRs along this direction, similar to the role of Cl− in the growth of TiO2 NRs in highly acidic solutions.38 As such, the NR arrays can keep a rather open-porous structure for filling with an active composite layer in photovoltaic cells.
Application of TiO2 NRs to perovskite solar cells
CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells were fabricated using TiO2 NRs with different lengths (∼0.7, ∼1.1, ∼1.4 and ∼1.8 μm) as ETMs of the devices. The main configuration of the devices was FTO/compact TiO2 layer/TiO2 NRs/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au (see Fig. S2†), where CH3NH3PbI3 was coated onto TiO2 NRs by a two-step sequential deposition.4 The fabrication process is described in detail in the Experimental section of the ESI†. The XRD pattern of as-prepared TiO2 NRs/CH3NH3PbI3 sample is shown in Fig. S3† to verify the formation of tetragonal phase perovskite on the NRs film. Fig. S4† presents the absorption spectra of the FTO/TiO2 NRs and FTO/TiO2 NRs/CH3NH3PbI3 samples. After coating the perovskite, the absorption edge of the NR samples shifted to ∼800 nm. The main photovoltaic parameters with different NR film thickness are displayed in Fig. 5a–d and Table 1. Both the short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC) were strongly dependent on the thickness of the NR film. JSC of ∼18 mA cm−2 could be obtained within a range of 0.7–1.1 μm, whereas it was decreased with elongating NRs. Although thicker films have slightly stronger absorption (see Fig. S4†), the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) in Fig. 5e shows significant higher efficiency for the 0.7–1.1 μm TiO2 NRs at a wavelength of 400 to 750 nm, which covers most of the absorption range. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectrum in Fig. S5† shows that 0.7 and 1.1 μm NR based devices have an IQE as high as 94% at 500 nm, which is much better than the longer NRs based-devices across entire range. The average VOC was reduced from 0.96 V at 0.7 μm to 0.87 V at 1.8 μm, showing a nearly linear negative correlation with the NR film thickness. Moreover, the average fill factor (FF) of the 1.1 μm NR-based device has a peak value of 63.2%, which drops significantly to 47.8% for the 1.8 mm NR-formed cells. As a result, the average PCE for the 0.7 μm NR-based device is 10.2%, which slightly lower than for the 1.1 μm NR-based one (10.5%), while it decreased significantly with further increases in the TiO2 NR thickness (7.8% and 6.4% for 1.4 and 1.8 μm NRs, respectively). The best performance devices with PCE up to 11.1% (Fig. 5f) was obtained for the 0.7 μm NRs film, showing JSC of 18.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V and FF of 61.5%. The J–V hysteresis depending on the NR thickness was also studied (Fig. S6†). The 0.7 μm NR based devices have been barely affected by the scanning direction, whereas a longer NR has a significant impact, resulting in a large discrepancy between the two different scanning directions. This may be due to possible recombination of the perovskite layer in thicker films.6,7

Conclusion
Tightly packed rutile TiO2 NRs were grown on FTO substrates using an acid-free hydrothermal method in Na2EDTA aqueous solution with glycerol modified TTIP as the precursor. The dimensions of TiO2 NRs, including the length, diameter and density, can be adjusted significantly by varying the growth time and initial reactant concentration. CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells were fabricated using the as-made TiO2 NRs as an ETM, which showed that shorter nanorods tend to achieve better photovoltaic performance, and the highest efficiency of ∼11% was obtained for the 0.7 μm NR-device. This study showed that the as-made TiO2 NRs has promise as an electron transport and scaffold material in perovskite solar cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Microstructural analysis of the as-made rutile TiO2 NRs: (a) XRD pattern, (b) Raman spectrum, (c) low-magnification TEM image, and (d) high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of TiO2 nanorods. The inset is an enlarged portion of (d) with interplanar spacings marked.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of TiO2 NRs synthesized at different growth time: (a) 1 h, (b) 2 h, (c) 3 h, (d) 4 h, (e) 5 h, (f) 12 h and (g) the cross section view of (c). The growth solution contained 10.0 μl ml−1 (∼33.0 mM) TTIP, 100 mM Na2EDTA, and 2.5 vol% glycerol.	 

 	Fig. 3  Effect of different synthesis parameters on the thickness of TiO2 NR films: (a) growth time, (b) volume fraction of glycerol in aqueous solution, (c) concentration of TTIP and (d) concentration of Na2EDTA. The standard growth parameters of NRs were 3 h reaction time, 2.5 vol% glycerol, 10.0 μl ml−1 TTIP, and 100 mM Na2EDTA. Only one variant was changed in each case.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of TiO2 NRs synthesized with different concentrations of the initial reactant: (a–c) 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 vol% glycerol in growth solution; (d–f) 7.5, 12.5 and 15.0 μl ml−1 TTIP; (g–i) 50, 60 and 75 mM Na2EDTA; (j–l) cross section view of (g–i). The standard growth parameters of NRs were 3 h reaction time, 2.5 vol% glycerol, 10.0 μl ml−1 TTIP, and 100 mM Na2EDTA. Only one variant was changed in each case.	 

 	Fig. 5  Dependence of the main photovoltaic parameters on the thickness of TiO2 NR films. (a) Short-circuit current density (JSC), (b) open circuit voltage (VOC), (c) fill factor (FF), (d) power conversion efficiency (PCE), and (e) incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). (f) J–V curves for a best-performing cell measured at a simulated AM1.5G solar irradiation (solid line) and in the dark (dashed line).
