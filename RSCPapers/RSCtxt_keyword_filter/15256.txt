, Accepted 30th April 2015First published on 30th April 2015AbstractPursuit of light harvesting is a persistent objective for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here we report the synthesis of titanium dioxide/silica (TiO2/SiO2) nanocrystallite photoanodes, aiming at elevating the light harvesting for dye excitation. Due to light interference effect of the reflected light beams from TiO2/SiO2 and SiO2/electrolyte interfaces, the dye excitation and therefore the photocurrent density are markedly enhanced. The photovoltaic performances of the resultant DSSCs are optimized by utilizing three TiO2/SiO2 photoanodes from different synthetic strategies. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 8.56% is measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global sunlight in comparison with 7.06% from pristine TiO2 based DSSC. The high power conversion efficiency in combination with simple preparation demonstrates the potential for utilization of TiO2/SiO2 nanocrystallite anodes in efficient DSSCs.
1. Introduction
The depletion of fossil fuels and global warming pose a challenge against sustainable development of the world. One of the efficient solutions is to explore renewable energy resources. Solar energy accounts for 99% of energy on earth, therefore the direct conversion of solar energy into electricity has attracted widespread attention due to low environmental impact.1–3 A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), a photoelectrochemical device comprising of a dye-sensitized anode, a redox electrolyte having I−/I3− couples, and a counter electrode, has attracted growing interests because of its merits on cost-effectiveness, relatively high power conversion efficiency, easy fabrication, and environmental friendliness.4–8 Since the first DSSC prototype created by Grätzel in 1991,9 a maximum efficiency of ∼13% has been recorded under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) global sunlight.10 One of the main problems in restricting the enhancement in power conversion efficiency is the incompleted dye excitation, therefore resulting in a modest electron density on the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 anode.11 There has been much effort to enhance the dye excitation, such as building a reflecting layer12,13 and designing bifacial DSSC that can be simultaneously illuminated from both front and rear sides.14 Recently, a bifacial DSSC device has been successfully designed in our group by splitting incident light into two beams.14 The device is simultaneously irradiated from the TiO2 photoanode and a transparent polyaniline counter electrode. The incident light from the transparent polyaniline counter electrode can compensate for the light penetrated from the photoanode, leading to a significantly enhanced dye excitation and a promising power conversion efficiency of 8.35%.
In searching for other alternative strategies, here we present three hydrothermal methods for the design of TiO2/SiO2 anodes in an attempt to increase the electron density on CB of TiO2 nanocrystallites. The light intensity for dye excitation is expected to be markedly enhanced due to the interference light reflected from TiO2/SiO2 and SiO2/air (electrolyte) interfaces. The concept toward light harvesting is also significant for other solar cells, such as quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Unless noted otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The average diameter of commercial SiO2 nanoparticles is around 20 nm.
2.2. Preparation of TiO2/SiO2 nanocrystallites
The TiO2/SiO2 nanocrystallites can be prepared according to the following procedures: (1) under vigorous agitation at room temperature, 100 mL of deionized water was mixed with 10 mL of titanium tetrabutanolate. After 30 min, the mixture was pump-filtrated to obtain dehydrated filter powders. (2) Subsequently, 10 mL of acetic acid and 0.8 mL of nitric acid were added into the above filter powders dropwise in a flask. After agitation of 15 min at 80 °C, the volume of the mixture was adjusted to 170 mL by adding deionized water. The reactant was further agitated at 80 °C in a sealed atmosphere. (3) Later, the resultant colloid was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. (4) A homogeneous mixture consisting of 65 mL of the white colloid and 0.4 g of commercial P25 were prepared under ultrasonic irradiation for 30 min and (5) then transferred to another Teflon-lined autoclave, which was subsequently heated at 200 °C for 12 h. (6) After removing the supernatant liquid, the colloid was mixed with 0.8 g of poly(ethylene glycol) (Mw = 20000) and 1 mL of OP emulsifier and subsequently concentrated at 80 °C. To obtain the TiO2/SiO2 colloid, 0.0275 g of SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the above reagent after steps (2), (4), and (6). The as-synthesized samples were denoted as TiO2/SiO2-(i), TiO2/SiO2-(ii), and TiO2/SiO2-(iii), respectively.
2.3. Fabrication of photoanodes
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (sheet resistance: 12 Ω square−1) with a size of 2 × 2 cm2 were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol, and dried by N2 gas flow. The photoanodes from TiO2/SiO2 were fabricated using a screen printing technique. The size of the resultant photoanodes was controlled at 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 with an average thickness of TiO2/SiO2 layer of 10 μm. The air-dried colloids were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min. The increase of heating temperature was controlled at a speed of 2 °C min−1 till 130 °C, and then at a speed of 6 °C min−1 until 450 °C. The resultant TiO2/SiO2 films were immersed in 0.50 mM N719 ethanol solution for 24 h to obtain dye-sensitized TiO2/SiO2 photoanodes.
2.4. Assembly of DSSCs
Each DSSC was assembled by sandwiching a dye-sensitized TiO2/SiO2 photoanode, a liquid electrolyte having I−/I3− redox couples, and a Pt counter electrode. The redox electrolyte consisted of 100 mM of tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM of NaI, 100 mM of KI, 100 mM of LiI, 50 mM of I2, and 500 mM of 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in 50 mL acetonitrile. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs were recorded on an Electrochemical Workstation (CHI600E) under irradiation of a simulated solar light (Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A, USA) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell) in ambient atmosphere. A black mask with an aperture area of around 0.25 cm2 was applied on the surface of DSSCs to avoid stray light. Each DSSC device was measured at least five times to eliminate experimental error (±5%) and a suitable J–V curve was constructed.
2.5. Other characterizations
The morphologies of the resultant TiO2/SiO2 and pure TiO2 anodes were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-3500N, Hitachi, Japan) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2010, JEOL). The optical absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453) at room temperature. Fourier transformed Raman spectroscopic measurements in the ultraviolet light were performed on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman Spectrometer. High-resolution gratings were used to give a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The spectra were recorded at room temperature from 3200 to 100 cm−1 using 16 scans with an exposure time of 1 s per scan. X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the resultant nanocrystallites were recorded on an X-ray powder diffractometer (X’pert MPD Pro, Philips, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) in the 2θ range from 10 to 70° operating at 40 kV accelerating voltage and 40 mA current. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker). For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the DSSCs were scanned from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz at an ac amplitude of 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of a TiO2 nanocrystallite photoanode is crucial for use in a DSSC device.15 Here, we mainly describe the morphological difference of resultant TiO2/SiO2 and pure TiO2 prepared by the sol–hydrothermal method. As is shown in Fig. 1, no apparent deviations in morphologies are observed from SEM images, indicating that the synthetic strategy does not influence the morphology of resultant TiO2/SiO2 anodes. The BET surface areas of the samples are 46.2, 62.0, 96.7, and 73.5 m2 g−1 for pure TiO2, TiO2/SiO2-(i), TiO2/SiO2-(ii), and TiO2/SiO2-(iii), respectively. The task of a photoanode is to adsorb dyes and to transfer photogenerated electrons from the excited dye to the FTO layer along the percolating networks of TiO2. Therefore, a mesoporous structure having a high specific surface area demonstrates that it is feasible to upload more photosensitive dyes for electron generation. As a reference, the surface morphology of pristine TiO2 anode is also provided, giving no apparent difference from TiO2/SiO2-(ii). Moreover, we can not distinguish SiO2 from TiO2 nanoparticles in SEM photographs, or amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles maybe suffer from dissolution and reorganization during the rigorous hydrothermal conditions.

Fig. 2 displays the high-resolution TEM images of TiO2/SiO2 and pure TiO2 nanocrystallites. It can be seen that the crystal lattice of the pure TiO2 is homogeneous with no amorphous regions, indicating that the organics and carbonaceous materials have been removed during the calcination process. However, a great deal of lattice distortions and plenty of defects are detected in the three TiO2/SiO2 nanocrystallites. Due to the presence of SiO2 amorphous phase, we deduce that the amorphous regions refer to the SiO2 phase and the crystal phase means anatase TiO2. These results reveal that TiO2 has been successfully incorporated or partially incorporated with amorphous SiO2 by entering the lattice fringes of TiO2 by Si4+ ions.16 It has been known that the ionic radius of Si4+ (0.039 nm) is much smaller than that of Ti4+ (0.068 nm), suggesting that Si4+ ions can enter into the TiO2 crystal lattice to substitute for Ti4+, which is consistent with the morphology analysis.

In order to describe the photo-absorption behavior of the TiO2/SiO2 nanocrystallites, the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra have been recorded and are shown in Fig. 3. As a comparison, the absorption spectrum of pristine TiO2 is also conducted at the same conditions. No obvious shape alteration is observed after integration with SiO2. Pristine TiO2 exhibits an absorption band at ca. 396 nm. However, the absorption shifts towards the ultraviolet-light region. Reflectance spectra have been converted to the absorbance spectra using Kubelka–Munk equations (eqn (1) and (2)).17 
(1) 
(2)where R is the reflectance recorded for a sample and RBaSO4 is the reflectance recorder for a reference. To calculate the band-gap energy, the Kubelka–Munk function is converted to the form (F(R∞)E)1/2 and the wavelength is changed to energy units (eV). The direct band gap energy can be obtained by an extrapolation method (see Fig. 3b–e). The direct Eg values of pure TiO2, TiO2/SiO2-(i), TiO2/SiO2-(ii), and TiO2/SiO2-(iii) are 2.96, 3.00, 3.02, and 3.16 eV, respectively. Notably, TiO2 is a typical photocatalyst and has been utilized for dye removal from pollutions.18–20 When irradiated by incident light, the electrons on the valence band of TiO2 can absorb energy and jump to its conduction band, leaving holes in the TiO2 surface. Both photogenerated electrons and holes by TiO2 can participate in the degradation reactions of organic dyes. In this way, the N719 molecule, one of the organic dyes, is expected to be photodegradated by TiO2, while the wavelength of the light for dye degradation depends on the Eg of the TiO2 (Eg ≈ 1240/λ). Apparently, the as-synthesized TiO2/SiO2-(ii) has the highest Eg, which indicates the excitation of photogenerated electrons and holes requires an increased photon energy. Therefore, fewer electron–hole pairs can be produced in the TiO2/SiO2-(ii) for participating in the photodegradation of organic N719 dye molecules, leading to an enhanced dye stability by utilizing strategy (ii) for photoanode fabrication.

The XRD technique has been widely employed for the identification of the crystal phase as well as crystallite size of TiO2. The detection of diffraction peaks reveals that pristine TiO2 is featured by anatase phase (Fig. 4). No diffraction peaks of the rutile phase are detected in the XRD patterns. The crystallite size can be determined from the broadening of the corresponding XRD peaks by the Scherrer formula:21 
(3)where L is the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (CuKα = 0.15418 nm), K is usually taken as 0.89, and β is the line width at half-maximum height (FWHM). In addition, the crystal lattice distortion (Δd/d) can also be evaluated from the equation:22

 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the TiO2/SiO2 and pure TiO2 nanocrystallites. 
At the first glance, all the diffraction peaks belonging to the diffraction faces of anatase TiO2 can be detected in the TiO2/SiO2 nanocrystallites. However, the relative intensity of the diffraction peak belonging to the (101) face of anatase TiO2 phase dramatically decreases after being doped with Si4+, indicating an inhibition effect of phase transformation from amorphous to anatase TiO2. Moreover, the crystallite size of the TiO2/SiO2 has an order of decreasing and the TiO2/SiO2-(ii) has the smallest crystallite size (Table 1), suggesting that the doping of Si4+ in TiO2 can hinder the growth of crystallite size due to the segregation of dopant cations at the grain boundary.23 The crystal lattice distortion (Δd/d) is also elevated by doping Si4+ ions in comparison with that of pure TiO2, indicating that the substitution of Ti by Si can generate more defects for dye adsorption. This result is in an agreement with TEM observations.

The crystallographic structures of the TiO2/SiO2 and pure TiO2 nanocrystallites were investigated by Raman spectroscopy and shown in Fig. 5a. The whole set of spectra shows three main Raman peaks at 394, 515, and 639 cm−1 that can be ascribed to the B1g (1), A1g/B1g (2), and Eg (3) modes of anatase phase of pure TiO2, respectively. However, the mode positions have shifted in comparison with pure TiO2. It is attributed to the decrease in crystallite size (Table 1) and lack of adjacent atoms for the surface atoms. Therefore, the surface atoms are in a relaxation state and the red shift results from a surface relaxation effect.24 Although the positions have deviations, the doping of Si4+ does not influence and change the structure of TiO2.25 The conclusion is consistent with that of XRD analysis. No Raman peaks corresponding to SiO2 can be detected in the doped TiO2, indicating that Si4+ may present in the substitutional positions in the crystal lattice of TiO2. The detection of 1059 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra (Fig. 5b) is a signal of Si–O–Ti bond,26,27 indicating that there is a covalent bond between SiO2 and TiO2 instead of a simple mixture. The coverage of TiO2 by SiO2 layer along with the doping of TiO2 by SiO2 and detection of Si–O–Ti bond may be used to support the hypothesis that the amorphous SiO2 nanoparticles have been dissolved and reorganized in the hydrothermal process.

Incident light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5G) has been widely employed as a standard in evaluating DSSC performances. In our previous study,11 we found that ∼85 and ∼40 mW cm−2 of incident light remains after penetrating FTO glass and 10 μm-thickness FTO–TiO2 photoanode (Fig. 6), respectively. This indicates that the dye molecules adsorbed at the interface of TiO2/FTO are irradiated by incident light with an intensity of ∼85 mW cm−2, whereas it is ∼40 mW cm−2 for the dyes at the interface of TiO2/electrolyte. The incident light shows a gradient descent within the dye-sensitized TiO2 film because of reflection and absorption of TiO2 nanocrystallites. It is well known that the DSSC performances are highly dependent on incident light intensity.28–30 Therefore, the transmission enhancement is of great significance in improving the photovoltaic performances. Interestingly, the transmission is dramatically enhanced by synthesizing TiO2/SiO2 by route (ii), it is ∼80 mW cm−2 in light intensity across the 10 μm-thickness FTO-TiO2/SiO2 anode. To explore the potential mechanism, we think it is subject to the compensation effect of reflected light from TiO2/SiO2 and SiO2/electrolyte interfaces. The transmission enhancement is attributed to a good matching of  with nSiO2 (ESI†).11 Until now, we conclused that the dye excitation efficiency is expected to be significantly enhanced, which is contributive to the elevation of electron density on CB of TiO2 and therefore the photocurrent density of the DSSC.

Fig. 7a displays J–V curves of the DSSCs from TiO2/SiO2 and pure TiO2 photoanodes and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The DSSC device containing pure TiO2 crystallites gives a Jsc of 14.06 mA cm−2 and η of 7.06%. Both of these parameters are enhanced by employing TiO2/SiO2 anodes. The optimal photovoltaic performances result from TiO2/SiO2-(ii) based DSSC: Jsc of 18.06 mA cm−2 and η of 8.56%. Jsc is a reflection of accumulative electron density injected from the excited state of dye to CB of TiO2, whereas the low excitation efficiency and photodegradation of dye molecules on TiO2 nanocrystallites have been tremendous obstacles for current loss. Owing to the compensation effect of TiO2/SiO2 nanocrystallines and enhancement of Eg of SiO2 doped TiO2, the excitation efficiency and photostability of dye molecules can be significantly improved, giving an enhanced Jsc in their DSSC devices. From a small standard deviation (±5%), as shown in ESI Fig. S1,† we infer that the DSSCs with promising photovoltaic performances and high reproducibility can be realized using the method reported here (Table 3).

From the dark J–V curves in Fig. 7b, one can see that the DSSC from TiO2/SiO2-(ii) anode shows the smallest dark current density at the same voltage. The dark current density in DSSC device is attributed to the triiodides combination with electrons on CB of TiO2 at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.31 The smaller dark current density indicates that the reduction of triiodides on the TiO2/electrolyte interface is slower. This is another factor for the elevated Jsc for TiO2/SiO2-(ii) anode based DSSC.
Fig. 8a shows the impedance spectra for the DSSCs, giving two semicircles which are assigned to electrochemical reaction at CE (a smaller one in high frequency region) and charge transfer at the TiO2|dye|electrolyte (a larger one in low frequency region). An equivalent circuit (see the inset of Fig. 8a) is used to fit the Nyquist plots to estimate the electron transport parameters, such as sheet resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance at CE/electrolyte (Rct1), charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct2), and Nernst diffusion impedance corresponding to the diffusion resistance of I−/I3− redox species (W). CPE1 and CPE2 are constant phase elements. It is found that the Rct2 of TiO2/SiO2-(ii) anode based DSSC is the smallest in comparison with other devices. The results demonstrate that the photogenerated electrons can be rapidly transferred to CB of TiO2 and the excited dyes are easily recovered by iodide ions. Moreover, the smallest W value suggests that the I−/I3− redox couples have a high diffusion kinetics within TiO2/SiO2-(ii) anode.

Finally, the lifetimes of electrons on various anodes are determined according to eqn (4),32 where fp is second peak frequency (Fig. 8b), giving a lifetime of 124.2 μs for TiO2/SiO2-(i), 399.7 μs for TiO2/SiO2-(ii), 214.9 μs for TiO2/SiO2-(iii), and 105.1 μs for pure TiO2. The enhanced electron lifetime in TiO2/SiO2 based DSSCs can be attributed to the elevated formation of connected channels by TiO2 and enhanced electron density.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the combination of TiO2 with SiO2 is an effective strategy for enhancing dye illumination and excitation, and increasing dye photostability. Due to the light interference reflected from TiO2/SiO2 and SiO2/air (electrolyte) interfaces, more active sites for dye adsorption and high electron lifetime, the DSSC from TiO2/SiO2-(ii) nanocrystallite provides an impressive power conversion efficiency of 8.56% in comparison with that of 7.06% from a pure TiO2 anode based device. The research presented here is far from being optimized but these profound advantages along with low-cost synthesis and scalable materials show the new nanocrystallites to be strong candidates for robust DSSCs.
