    , Accepted 23rd May 2016First published on 24th May 2016AbstractWe describe the synthesis and application of a three-dimensional (3D) CdS quantum dot/ZnIn2S4 nanosheet/TiO2 nanotube array (CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2) heterostructured material architecture. TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) are used as the synthetic template, subsequently sensitized using hydrothermal and successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) techniques. The described synthesis approach offers a powerful technique in the design of 3D heterostructure systems. Under AM1.5G illumination, the 3D CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 samples generate a photocurrent of approximately 4.3 mA cm−2, with a photoconversion efficiency of 2%. Samples are tested for their ability to photocatalytically degrade target agents; it is noteworthy that after 90 min illumination 100% of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is removed.
Introduction
Photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants is a topic of ongoing scientific and commercial interest.1,2 In the past decades, a variety of semiconductor photocatalysts have been synthesized and studied, including TiO2,3 ZnO,4 BiVO4,5 AgNBO3,6 and ZnWO4.7 TiO28,9 offers several advantages over other semiconductors, including low-cost,10 non-toxicity,11 and chemical stability,12 while the nanotube architecture promotes rapid separation of the photo-generated holes and electrons.13 However, TiO2 possesses a band gap of 3.2 eV, suitable for absorbing only some 4% of the incident solar spectrum energy.14–16
Numerous investigations have sought to maintain the advantages TiO2 offers while shifting its band gap so as to utilize visible light, which accounts for some 48% of the incident solar energy;17 such efforts include, but are certainly not limited to metallic or non-metallic doping,18 and TiO2 hydrogenation or reduction.19 Coupling TiO2 with visible light semiconductors appears to offer a viable pathway for obtaining an optimal photocatalyst; heterostructures investigated include Ag2O/TiO2, NiO/TiO2, and CeO2/TiO2,20–22 with their physical structures tailored to promote charge separation.23,24 Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,25 CdSe,26 CdTe27 and PbS28 have been grafted onto TiO2 as sensitizers to enhance photocurrent response, with the QD band gap tailored by modifying its physical size.27,29 Of these binary semiconductors, CdS has attracted considerable attention for photocatalytic applications, including the synthesis and application of CdS/titanate nanotubes,30 ZnO/CdS heterostructures,31 CdS/TaON/graphene composites,32 and CdS/Bi2WO6 heterostructures.29
Ternary sulfide ZnIn2S4, as the only member of the AB2X4 family semiconductor with a layered structure, has attracted considerable attention due to its potential application in a variety of fields including catalysis,33,34 charge storage,35 photoconduction,36,37 and thermoelectricity.38 Of particular interest is ternary ZnIn2S4, a chemically stable chalcogenide semiconductor, well suited to visible light absorption.39 A variety of ZnIn2S4 hybrid semiconductor heterostructures have been explored in efforts to improve photocatalytic performance.40–42 For example, multi-walled carbon nanotubes coupled ZnIn2S4 composites have been used for hydrogen production,43 while ZnIn2S4–PVDF–poly-(MMA-co-MAA) composites have been reported to exhibit high photocatalytic activity for degradation of methyl orange.44
In an effort to achieve a high performance chemically stable visible light photocatalyst we fabricate CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructures using a facile hydrothermal method coupled with a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction process (SILAR). We find the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 composites are chemically stable and have excellent visible light photocatalytic properties.
Results and discussion
A high performance visible light photocatalyst, CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructure, was prepared using a facile hydrothermal method coupled with a SILAR technique, as shown in Fig. 1. The band gap of TiO2 (3.2 eV), ZnIn2S4 (2.6 eV) and CdS (2.4 eV) reduces progressively with the CB and VB increasing progressively forming a stepwise heterostructure so that the absorption of visible light was significantly enhanced, which was verified in the photodegradation of organic pollutants. The proposed material was first characterized.

Characterization

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of TiO2 with/without deposition of ZnIn2S4 and CdS. The TiO2 NTAs have an inner pore diameter ranging from 70 to 110 nm and wall thickness of about 15 nm (Fig. 2A). The formation mechanism of the TiO2 NTAs is well documented.45,46 As shown in Fig. 2B, the surface of the TiO2 NTAs is homogeneously covered with a 3D layer of dense ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. Fig. 2C and D displays the cross-sectional images of unmodified TiO2 NTAs and ZnIn2S4/TiO2 NTAs, respectively. The bare TiO2 NT is smooth and clean (Fig. 2C), while in the ZnIn2S4/TiO2 NTAs, the TiO2 NT is filled with ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (Fig. 2D). The tubular space limited the size of ZnIn2S4, no flower-like ZnIn2S4 was formed. The ZnIn2S4 nanosheets are distributed randomly on the surface and interstices of nanotubes, and the gap between TiO2 NTs almost disappears owing to the filling of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. Fig. 2E shows the image of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets remaining in solution after the hydrothermal reaction, which are already self-assembled into microspheres. After 5 cycles CdS absorbtion onto the ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructure, the surface of the material (Fig. 2F) becomes a little rougher than undecorated ZnIn2S4/TiO2 (Fig. 2B). As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2F, upon further increasing the amount of CdS, a rather rougher surface would be gained, and thus, small particles of CdS grow into larger crystals.

Fig. 2G and H show the EDS of the selected area in ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2, respectively. The EDS analysis of Fig. 2G shows the characteristic peaks of Zn, In and S with an approximate elemental composition of 1:2:4 (Zn/In/S), and the characteristic peaks of Ti and O with an approximate elemental composition of 1:2 (Ti/O), redundant Ti belongs to the Ti substrate, verifying the desired stoichiometry of the heterostructure ZnIn2S4/TiO2. Moreover, in Fig. 2H, we can see that the calculated molar percentages of Zn, In, S and Cd are about 8.06%, 17.74%, 38.08% and 4.31%, respectively, corresponding to the molar ratio of 1:2:4.5:0.5 (Zn/In/S/Cd), which verified the desired stoichiometry of the heterostructure CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2.
The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the electrode materials are shown in Fig. 3, which are consistent with the results previously reported.47–50 We can see that ZnIn2S4/TiO2 sample results in a red shift of the absorption peaks, suggesting that the combination of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets for TiO2 NTAs can expand the absorption range of photoelectrodes. What is more, CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 showed a further red shift. The narrow band gap of CdS QDs is responsible for the improved absorption capability of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 in the visible-light region.

Photoelectrochemical properties
Photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of the samples were investigated in an electrolyte containing 0.24 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 to examine the photoelectrochemical properties. As shown in Fig. 4, the photocurrent densities of both the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 materials are much higher than those of the pure TiO2 (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the time-dependent photocurrent responses of the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and unmodified TiO2 NTs under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 visible light. Both show a high stability, and the photocurrent decreases by 3.02% within 1 h.

The photocurrent–applied potential relationship (J–V) is shown in Fig. 5A. The corresponding light to chemical energy conversion efficiencies are shown in Fig. 5B, which are calculated as follows:51–53 η(%) = (total power output − electrical power input)/light power input × 100 = jp[E0rev − |Eapp|]/I0 × 100(1)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpE0rev is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power input and I0 is the power density of the incident light (100 mW cm−2). E0rev is the standard reversible potential which is 1.23 V per NHE, and the applied potential Eapp= Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions, under the same illumination, and in the same electrolyte. The voltage at which the photocurrent becomes zero was taken as Eaoc.

The photocurrent density of CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 increases with increasing CdS deposition cycles, from 0 to 5, and then decreases while further increasing the deposition cycles. When the applied voltage was zero, the highest photocurrent 4.29 mA cm−2 was achieved with the 5 cycles CdS deposition, which is 4 and 14 times the photocurrent density obtained on ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and bare TiO2 NTAs photoelectrodes, respectively. The lowest electron–hole recombination rate of the 5 cycles CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 can be attributed to the relatively small size of CdS nanoparticles. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2F, upon increasing the deposition sequence, the CdS nanoparticles tend to aggregate. Although the loading amount increases at high deposition sequence, the particle number does not increase consequently but the particle size increases. The aggregated CdS particle may work as the hole–electron recombination centers due to the relatively big size and surface defects,54,55 which results in a decrease in the photo-conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, the photoconversion efficiencies measured for TiO2 and ZnIn2S4/TiO2 were 0.19% at −0.59 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 5B, curve a) and 0.38% at −0.70 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 5B, curve b), respectively. Deposition of CdS QDs significantly enhances the photoconversion efficiencies, with 2.0% at 0.74 V vs. Ag/AgCl achieved on CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 with 5 cycles modification of CdS QDs, Fig. 5B (curve e).
Photocurrents increase upon increasing the applied potential up to 0 V for ZnIn2S4/TiO2 (curve b) and CdS(5)/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 (curve e) electrodes. Further increasing the applied potential, the photocurrent gets saturated, which can be attributed to the limitation of free photogenerated electrons moving within the heterostructure or complete separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes under fixed light intensity.56 As for TiO2 NTAs (curve a) electrode, the photocurrents are much lower than those obtained in ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2, and without saturation within the investigated potential range, indicating that the construction of heterostructures ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 can enhance the absorption in the visible range and increase the photoelectrical conversion efficiency.
The electron–hole recombination characteristics were further studied by photoluminescence (PL), a widely used method to study the surface structure, excited states and surface process involving electron/hole recombination.47 The recombination of electron–hole pair emits photons resulting in photoluminescence.57,58Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra (excitation wavelength 275 nm) of the TiO2 NTAs, ZnIn2S4/TiO2, and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 with different CdS amounts expressed in deposition sequences. It can be observed that the ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructures show lower PL intensity than that of the unmodified TiO2 NTAs with the lowest PL intensity observed in the 5 cycles CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2. The lower PL intensities of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructures represent the fact that the emergence of the heterostructure results in a decrease in the recombination rate of electron–hole, and consequently an increase in the photoconversion efficiency.

The open-circuit dark–light–dark photovoltage response was measured to investigate recombination kinetics; the Voc transient was monitored during relaxation from an illuminated quasi-equilibrium state to the dark equilibrium.59
Once the illumination on a photoelectrode at the open circuit is interrupted, the excess electrons are removed due to recombination, with the photovoltage decay rate directly related to the electron lifetime by the following expression: τn = [−kBT/e][dVoc/dt]−1(2)where kBT, e and dVoc/dt are the thermal energy, positive elementary charge, and open-circuit voltage transient, respectively. The appropriate use of eqn (2) assumes that the recombination is linear with a first-order dependence on electron concentration and that electron recombination occurs only with the electrolyte.60

Fig. 7A shows open-circuit dark–light–dark photovoltage responses of different photoelectrodes in an electrolyte containing 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 7B is the plot of the response time obtained by applying eqn (2) to the data in Fig. 7A. The photopotentials of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 photoelectrodes are higher than those of the pure TiO2 NTAs, indicating a greater accumulation of photogenerated electrons. The photopotential decays slowly after the photoelectrodes are returned to the dark indicating the long e–h+ lifetimes. In comparison to open circuit photovoltage decay measurement of the pure TiO2 NTAs, the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 exhibits better recombination characteristics, with the longer lifetimes indicating fewer recombination centers in the sample.

Photocatalytic activity
Photodegradation of 2,4-D and MO solutions under visible light was performed to investigate the photocatalytic activities of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 in comparison with those of the pure TiO2 NTAs. Quantification was based on the optical absorption spectra of 2,4-D and MO after visible light irradiation at different exposure times. Organic pollutants were determined following the Beer–Lambert’s law for the absorption band with the maximum at 227 nm for 2,4-D and 464 nm for MO. The absorption peak under each spectrum was used to determine the quantity of pollutants degradation of each sample. As is shown in Fig. 8A and C, after 140 min illumination, all characteristic peaks of MO disappear completely, indicating that the MO is completely degraded, while 90 min illumination degrades 2,4-D completely, a performance comparable to that of other semiconductors.61–64 As illustrated in Fig. 8B and D, under identical conditions, CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 shows a much higher activity than that of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and TiO2.

To further explore the function of TiO2 NTAs during the photodegradation, contrast experiments were run by replacing TiO2 NTAs with the pure Ti sheet as the substrate. ZnIn2S4/Ti and CdS/ZnIn2S4/Ti were synthesized using the same method under the same conditions as the preparation of ZnIn2S4/TiO2 and CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 with only replacing TiO2 NTAs with the pure Ti sheet as the substrate. Then the photodegradation of MO and 2,4-D was performed under the same conditions to study the photocatalytic activities of ZnIn2S4/Ti and CdS/ZnIn2S4/Ti in comparison with those of CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2. As shown in Fig. 8E and F, under identical conditions, both ZnIn2S4/Ti and CdS/ZnIn2S4/Ti show a lower activity than that of CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2, suggesting that TiO2 NTAs can promote electron transmission and charge separation.
Catalyst stability was evaluated by repeatedly measuring its efficiency in photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2,4-D and MO. The degradation rate of 2,4-D with 90 min illumination decreases from 100% on the first run to 95.2% on the fourth run (Fig. 9A). The degradation rate of MO with 140 min illumination is 91.7% on the first run, and 86.7% on the fourth run (Fig. 9B). One may care about the chemical stability of the materials since photodegradation occurs at the oxidative anode. For this reason, CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 was characterized using SEM and EDS after the degradation process of 2,4-D. As shown in Fig. 9C and D, the structure of the material has little change, confirming the chemical stability.

Photodegradation mechanism
Based on the previous reports50,65,66 and the results mentioned above, a tentative photocatalytic degradation mechanism is proposed and is shown in Fig. 10 with the following equations: TiO2 → TiO2(h+ + e−) ZnIn2S4 → ZnIn2S4(h+ + e−) CdS → CdS(h+ + e−)(3) TiO2(h+ + e−) + ZnIn2S4(h+ + e−) + CdS(h+ + e−) → TiO2(etotal−) + ZnIn2S4 + CdS(htotal+)(4) TiO2(etotal−) + O2 → TiO2 + ˙O2−(5) H+ + ˙O2− → ˙O2H → → 2˙OH(6) CdS(htotal+) + H2O → CdS + ˙OH + H+(7) TiO2(h+ + e−) → TiO2 ZnIn2S4(h+ + e−) → ZnIn2S4 CdS(h+ + e−) → CdS(8) ˙OH + organic pollutants → degradation products(9)
 Fig. 10  A schematic mechanism of the possible charge transfer in the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterojunction system. 
Charge carriers are produced when photons are irradiated onto the photocatalyst in the suspended solution. The band gap of TiO2 (3.2 eV), ZnIn2S4 (2.6 eV) and CdS (2.4 eV) reduces progressively with the CB and VB increasing progressively to form a stepwise heterostructure that can absorb visible light. Under irradiation, photo-generated electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of CdS, creating positive holes in the VB of CdS. Photo-excited electrons in the CB of CdS transfer to ZnIn2S4, and then migrate to TiO2. Meanwhile, holes are transported in the opposite direction at the heterojunction interface. The separated electrons and holes migrate to the surface as reducing agents and sacrificial reagents, respectively (eqn (3) and (4)). Oxygen molecules dissolved in the suspension capture the electrons in the conduction band, and the holes in the valence band are captured by H2O species adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts to produce the ˙OH radicals (eqn (5)–(7)), which subsequently degrades organic pollutants (eqn (9)).67,68 Meanwhile, CB electrons may recombine with VB holes (eqn (8)).
To gain deeper insight into the charge transfer and recombination processes in CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterojunction electrode, the analysis of the formed ˙OH radicals on the sample surface under UV-Vis irradiation was performed by a fluorescence technique using TA, which readily reacted with ˙OH radicals to produce highly fluorescent product, 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid.64,67,69–72 The intensity of the peak attributed to 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid was known to be proportional to the amount of ˙OH radicals formed. The selected concentration of TA solution was 5 × 10−4 M in a diluted NaOH aqueous solution with a concentration of 2 × 10−3 M. It has been proved that under these experimental conditions (low concentration of TA, less than 10−3 M, room temperature), the hydroxylation reaction of TA proceeds mainly by ˙OH radicals.
As shown in Fig. 11A, the PL intensity increases gradually with the increasing irradiation time with CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 as a photocatalyst, indicating ˙OH is indeed formed during this photocatalytic process. To illustrate photocatalytic properties of different photoelectrodes, the PL is recorded after irradiation of 20 min, and the results are shown in Fig. 11B. From TiO2 (curve c) to CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 (curve a), the PL intensity shows a gradual increase. The results confirm the best photocatalytic performance of CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2.

Conclusions
A novel CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructure was prepared using a mild hydrothermal method combined with a SILAR technique. The photoelectrical performances of the as prepared materials are carefully investigated; optimal samples demonstrate a solar spectrum photoconversion efficiency of approximately 2.0%. Photocatalytic performance was tested by photodegradation of organic pollutants, with excellent efficiencies obtained; a photodegradation mechanism was proposed on the basis of band alignment to elucidate the enhancement of efficiency seen in the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 material system.
Experimental section
Materials and chemicals
Titanium foil (99.8% purity and 0.25 mm thick) was purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Zinc sulfate heptahydrate(Zn2SO4·7H2O), indium(III) chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3) and thioacetamide (TAA) (99.0%) were commercially available from Aladdin (Shanghai). Methyl orange (MO) and 2,4-D were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Corporation of China. All other reagents of analytical reagent (AR) grade were obtained from commercial sources and used as received without any further purification.
All experiments, excluding those with special annotation, were conducted at room temperature. Ultrapure water was prepared using Milli-Q water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ resistivity) and used throughout the experiment.
Apparatus
The morphologies of the prepared materials were analyzed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). An energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) fitted to the field-emission scanning electron microscope was used to identify elemental composition of the product. PL spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were measured by using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 300, Varian, USA) with a 150 mm integrating sphere. UV-Vis absorbance spectra were measured by using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 60, Agilent, USA).
Fabrication of the TiO2 NTAs
Titanium ribbons were cleaned in 3% hydrofluoric acid (30 seconds), rinsed with deionized water, ultrasonic cleaned for 5 min in acetone solution and ethanol, and then dried in a nitrogen stream prior to anodization. The cleaned titanium ribbon was anodized at 20 V constant voltage for 2 h using a two-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum foil counter electrode in electrolyte containing 0.5 M NaHSO4 and 0.1 M NaF at room temperature. To induce high crystallinity, the highly ordered TiO2 NTAs were annealed at 500 °C for 3 h with heating and cooling rates of 2 °C min−1.
Preparation of ZnIn2S4 nanosheet/TiO2 NTAs heterostructures
ZnIn2S4 nanosheet/TiO2 NTAs heterostructures were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method. Briefly, 25 mM of Zn2SO4·7H2O, 50 mM of InCl3, 100 mM of TAA and 10 mL of ultrapure water were loaded into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 20 mL capacity and stirred for 30 min. The TiO2 NTAs was put on the bottom of the Teflon-liner of an autoclave. After that, the autoclave was sealed, maintained at 150 °C for 15 min, and cooled down to room temperature naturally. A layer of yellow film was deposited on the TiO2 substrate, clearly visible to the unaided eye. Once washed by ultrapure water and ethanol, the sample was dried at 60 °C for 2 h under vacuum.
Preparation of CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructures
CdS is deposited onto the ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterostructures via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process.73 Briefly, 0.5 M cadmium nitrate in ethanol was used as the cation source and 0.5 M sodium sulfide in 1:1 methanol and water as the anion source. The sample was dipped into cation source for 5 min, rinsed with ethanol, then dipped for another 5 min into anion source and again rinsed with methanol. The two-step dipping procedure is termed as one SILAR cycle and the procedure was repeated until a desired deposition of CdS nanocrystalline was achieved. Finally, the photoelectrode was dried in a nitrogen stream, and then annealed at 350 °C in a N2 atmosphere for 60 min.
Photoelectrochemical activity measurements
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd) in a standard three-electrode configuration with a CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 sample, 1.0 cm2 in area, as the working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ-500 W, Beijing Changtuo Co. Ltd), filtered to 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G as determined using a radiometer (NOVA Oriel 70260), was used as the light source. An aqueous solution containing 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.24 M Na2S served as the PEC electrolyte.
Photocatalytic activity measurements
The photocatalytic activity of the CdS/ZnIn2S4/TiO2 was evaluated by the degradation of organic pollutants including 20 mg L−1 2,4-D and MO in 20 mL 0.05 M Na2SO4, with tests carried out under constant stirring. The organic composition solution to be photo-degraded was left in the dark for 30 min prior to irradiation to achieve absorption equilibrium. Then steady-state photolysis was carried out in a 20 mL optical quartz cell. The concentration change during the degradation procedure was monitored by determining the UV-Vis adsorption of 60 μL of sample taken from the solution. After measurement, the solution was immediately added back to the reaction cell to keep the volume constant. The degree of organic compound degradation was defined as follows: Removal efficiency = (C0 − Ct)/Ct × 100% = (A0 − At)/At × 100%(10)where C0 is the initial concentration measured after stirring for 30 min in the dark, and Ct the residual concentration measured after illumination of time t. Assuming the absorbance A is linear related to the concentration in the investigated range, Ct and C0 can be represented with the corresponding At and A0.
Analysis of photodegradation mechanism
Hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) produced by the as-prepared photoelectrode under AM 1.5G illumination were detected by the PL analysis using TA as a probe molecule. The experimental steps were similar to those of the degradation procedure except that organic pollutant solution was replaced by the 5 × 10−4 M TA and 2 × 10−3 M NaOH. The change of ˙OH concentration during the degradation procedure was monitored by determining the fluorescence emission intensity with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm.
