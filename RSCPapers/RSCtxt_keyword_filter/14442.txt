    , Accepted 7th November 2013First published on 7th November 2013AbstractIn this paper, a free radical assisted strategy was introduced into the functionalization of counter electrode materials for the first time. With the assistance of a radical initiator, short-chained thiol groups can be attached on a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) surface covalently, which was confirmed to be beneficial for both controlling the particle growth of platinum (Pt) on MWCNTs and improving the electron transfer between counter electrode materials and the substrate. The obtained Pt–MWCNT composite has been applied as a counter electrode material for dye-sensitized solar cells, and the power conversion efficiency (η) was detected to be 8.62%, surpassing that of the cell with a conventional Pt counter electrode (η = 7.56%). Especially, the fill factor improved considerably from 0.57 to 0.65.
1. Introduction
Compared with the traditional silicon solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) demonstrate significant merits of low-cost, easy fabrication and relatively high power conversion efficiency (η). A typical DSC has a sandwich structure with a photoanode comprising dye-sensitized TiO2 nanocrystals, an electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE).1,2 The CE in conventional DSCs is usually made of the noble metal platinum (Pt), which is generally confirmed to be a superior CE material with good catalytic activity for I3− reduction. However, demerits of Pt such as low reserve and high price greatly restrict the large-scale application of DSCs.3 Therefore, plenty of low-cost materials have been introduced in recent years as replacements of Pt, such as carbon materials,4–9 conducting polymers,10,11 metal oxides,12 metal sulfides,13–15 metal nitrides,16,17 metal carbides,18etc. Among these substitutes, carbon materials have been considered as an ideal alternative to Pt because of their excellent electrical conductivity and relatively high catalytic activity. However, as their leading weakness, the poor bonding strength between carbon materials and the substrate limits the further improvement of carbon CE-based DSCs.19 Therefore, it is imperative to achieve superior carbon-based CE materials by optimizing their catalytic activity and adhesive strength.20 Herein, inspired by “free radical polymerization (FRP)”, a novel strategy has been applied to decorating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a trace amount of Pt for the fabrication of Pt–MWCNT composites as low-cost and high-performance CE materials. It is worth noting that short-chained molecules attached on the MWCNT surface during the fabrication process would be beneficial to improving the bonding strength between CE materials and the substrate21,22 and also controlling the particle growth of Pt, which might greatly contribute to the highly efficient DSCs.
The Pt–MWCNT composite was synthesized by a two-step method. Firstly, with the aid of 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) which is a common radical initiator, the thiol group (R–SH) on 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was converted to thiol radical (R–S˙) and further attached to the MWCNT surface covalently.22 The electroconductivity and catalytic activity of MWCNTs would not be affected because their surface would not been damaged by the introduction of short-chained ligands.23 Secondly, the treated MWCNTs were loaded with an ultra-low amount of size-controlled Pt nanoparticles. Eventually, the obtained Pt–MWCNT composite was applied as a CE material for DSCs, presenting higher power conversion efficiency (η = 8.62%) than that of the cell with a conventional Pt CE (η = 7.56%).
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the Pt–MWCNT composite
Firstly, 500 mg commercial MWCNTs (COCC, d = 8–15 nm) were dispersed in 150 ml absolute ethanol in a 250 ml round-bottom flask, then 1.061 g MPA (Alfa Aesar, 99%) and 4.924 g AIBN (Sinopharm, AR) were added in with a mole ratio of AIBN/MPA = 3, warmed up to 60–65 °C and kept stirring for a whole day. The MPA treated MWCNTs were washed and precipitated with ethanol for 3–4 times and dried at 70 °C overnight. Secondly, 150 mg as-prepared MWCNTs were dispersed in 12 ml absolute ethanol and then treated by ultrasonication for 10 min. After 1.5 ml (Pt equivalent: 2 mg ml−1) H2PtCl6·H2O (Sinopharm, AR) ethanol solution was added, 3 ml 2 mg ml−1 NaBH4 aqueous (Sinopharm, AR) was injected in immediately and the solution was stirred overnight. Also, the sample was washed and precipitated with ethanol for 3 times and dried at 70 °C overnight.
2.2 Preparation of the Pt–MWCNT coated counter electrode
The Pt–MWCNT coated CEs were prepared on an F-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO) substrate (NSG, 7 Ω per square) using a paste that was made from the above obtained Pt–MWCNT powder by blade coating. Then the formed films were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The Pt CE films were fabricated by drop casting technology and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions.
2.3 Fabrication of DSCs
The working photoanodes were prepared by the following procedure. First, each FTO substrate was dipped in 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C (TiCl4 treatment) in order to deposit a blocking layer. Then a 12 mm thick layer of 25 nm sized TiO2 particles (Degussa P25) was loaded onto the FTO by the screen printing technique with an area of about 0.25 cm2 and sintered at 125 °C. The obtained layer was then coated with a 4 mm thick scattering layer of 200 nm sized TiO2 particles (HEPTACHROMA, DHS-NanoT200) followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. After another TiCl4 treatment and cooling down to 80 °C, the TiO2 films were transferred to a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (v/v = 1/1) for 24 h to obtain dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. The photoanode and counter electrode were sealed by heating a 25 mm thick hot-melt film (Surlyn 1702, DuPont). DSCs were assembled by injecting the electrolyte into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode from a hole drilled on the CE substrate beforehand. The liquid electrolyte for cells was composed of 0.60 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate with acetonitrile as the solvent.
2.4 Measurements
The Pt–MWCNT composites were observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOLJEM-2010F, F20, 200 kV) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The chemical states of the elements in this photocatalytic system were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Kratos Axis Ultra DLD), and the binding energy of the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV was taken as an internal reference. The current–voltage tests of DSCs were performed under one sun condition using a solar light simulator (Oriel, 91160, AM 1.5 globe). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiment and Tafel polarization curves were measured with dummy cells in the dark using an electrochemical workstation (Parstat 2273, Princeton). The frequency range of EIS experiments was from 1 MHz to 100 mHz with an AC modulation signal of 10 mV and a bias DC voltage of −0.60 V. Tafel polarization measurements were carried out with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660e) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and the electrolyte was an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2. The Ag/Ag+ couple was employed as a reference electrode, and the counter electrode was a platinum foil.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Schematic diagram
The Pt–MWCNT composite was obtained by the following steps (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagrams of the synthesis of the Pt–MWCNT composite, including the radical reaction process and the loading of platinum over the carbon surface defects. 
In this procedure, with the aid of radical initiator AIBN, R–SH on MPA was converted to R–S˙ and attached to the MWCNT surface covalently. Then, the carbon surface was decorated with short-chained molecules which would be beneficial for controlling the Pt particle growth and also improving the bonding strength between CE materials and the substrate. As the Pt precursor was added in, Pt4+ ions aggregated around the short chained molecule–carbon surface joints and those joints might act as active sites for the growth of Pt nanoparticles due to the abnormal electron field there. With a sudden injection of NaBH4 aqueous solution, Pt4+ ions were reduced to Pt nanoparticles and the particle size can be controlled in an ultra-small scale because sulphur (S) could restrict Pt particle growth.20,24 And the carboxyl groups exposed outside the MWCNT surface would have an interaction with the hydroxyl groups on the FTO glass surface, which would help the electrons transfer and would be conducive to the improvement of photovoltaic performance (Fig. 2).25

3.2 Characterization of the Pt–MWCNT composite
The fibre-like morphology of MWCNTs was retained after the Pt nanoparticles were loaded, and can be observed from the typical SEM image (Fig. 3a). The elemental analysis of the Pt–MWCNT composite is detected by employing EDS (Fig. 3f), indicating the existence of the elements of Pt, C, S, O and Al in the sample. Peaks of C and Pt indicated that the composite prepared by our new strategy is mainly composed of Pt and MWCNTs. The presence of the S element means that the sulfur radical has been successfully attached to the carbon surface, while the O element might be attributed to the carboxyl groups from MPA. Furthermore, the detection of the Al element is due to the SEM sample table. It is worth noting that the content of Pt in the sample is ultra-low corresponding to the low Pt loading amount. To further investigate the Pt loading on the surface of the MWCNTs, TEM was performed. Fig. 3c shows that the Pt nanoparticles were dispersed homogeneously on the CNT surface with ultra-small particle size. The size distribution image in Fig. 3e shows that Pt nanoparticles have mainly a size around 1 nm. Fig. 3b shows the HRTEM image of Pt–MWCNTs and the lattice distance in the enlarged view (Fig. 3d) confirms that the nanoparticles are Pt0. Meanwhile, XPS measures the CNT surface composition by determining the binding energy of photoelectrons ejected when CNTs are irradiated with X-rays (Fig. 4a and b). Fig. 4a shows the deconvoluted C 1s envelopes and the following bonds were assigned: sp2 CC (284.7 eV), sp3 C–C (284.9 eV), C–O (286.1 eV), CO (287.3 eV) and π–π* (290.3 eV).26,27 The S 2p peak in Fig. 4b can be assigned to the “reduced” sulfur (–C–S–C–, 163.8 eV), which means MPA had been attached on the carbon surface successfully after being sintered.28

3.3 Photovoltaic measurement
Furthermore, the as-prepared Pt–MWCNT composites were applied as the CE of DSCs which proceeded with photovoltaic measurement. Fig. 5a compares the photovoltaic performance of DSCs with a Pt–MWCNT CE and Pt CE. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSCs were measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. From Table 1, the DSC with a Pt–MWCNT CE shows a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.7 mA cm−2, while the corresponding value of the Pt CE was 17.1 mA cm−2, which is attributed to the good electroconductivity of MWCNTs. Most important of all, with a better fill factor (FF = 0.65) due to an improved bonding strength between metal carbon composites and the FTO glass, the DSC with a Pt–MWCNT CE shows a large improvement of 14% in power-conversion efficiency compared to the bare Pt CE, which highlights the great effect of the carboxyl groups containing molecules on the carbon surface.29,30

The photovoltaic performance of the CEs strongly depends on the kinetic features of the electrochemical processes. To gain insight into the electrochemical mechanism of the great effect caused by the ultra-small Pt nanoparticles and oxygen-containing groups on the carbon surface, EIS of the symmetric configurations made by two CEs was carried out and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5b. The high-frequency (corresponding to low Z′) intercept on the real axis (Z′ axis) represents the series resistance (Rs). The left arch can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the counter electrode–electrolyte interface.
The Rs, Rct, and Cdl values are obtained by fitting the spectra in Fig. 5b with an EIS spectrum analyzer (ZSimpWin soft) and summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, the first semicircle of Pt–MWCNTs is smaller than that of Pt. From the first semicircle, it was found that both the series resistance (Rs = 4.13 Ω) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 1.50 Ω) of the Pt–MWCNT electrode are lower than the corresponding values for the Pt electrode (Rs = 7.00 Ω, Rct = 3.27 Ω). A relatively faster electron transfer rate between CE materials and FTO that resulted from a tighter bonding strength leads to a decrease in Rs of the Pt–MWCNT CE compared to the Pt CE. The Rct stands for the ease of electron exchange between the CE and the electrolyte whose value varies inversely with the I3− reduction activity of the CEs. The lower Rct value of the Pt–MWCNT CE means there is less electron loss at the electrolyte–counter electrode interface and a better catalytic activity, giving a better operation of the cell. The considerable decrease of the Rct value is profited from the ultra-small Pt nanoparticles. Furthermore, the Cdl develops at the electrode–electrolyte interface due to the accumulation of ions at the CE surface and could qualitatively represent active surface areas of the electrodes. So it is reasonable that the Cdl value of the Pt–MWCNT CE is considerably higher than that of the Pt CE because of the high specific surface area of MWCNTs. Connecting with the power conversion efficiency, it is obvious that the lower resistance is the main cause resulting in a relatively higher power conversion efficiency of the DSC with a Pt–MWCNT CE. And the improvement of bonding strength might directly decrease the internal resistance of DSCs with a Pt–MWCNT CE. The EIS results agreed well with the photovoltaic experiments.
To further examine the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the triiodide/iodide couple on the electrode surface, Tafel-polarization measurements were also carried out in a dummy cell similar to the one used in EIS measurements. Fig. 5c shows the Tafel curves of the dummy cells based on Pt–MWCNTs and Pt electrodes. Theoretically, the Tafel curve can be divided into three zones depending on the overpotential value: the polarization zone at low overpotential (|U| < 120 mV), the Tafel zone at intermediate overpotential (with a sharp slope) and the diffusion zone at high overpotential. From the Tafel zone and diffusion zone, the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) are obtained, which have a close relationship with the catalytic activity of the catalysts. In the Tafel zone, the anodic and cathodic branches of the Pt–MWCNT CE show a larger slope than the conventional Pt CE, indicating the presence of a large exchange current density (J0) on the electrode surfaces, which means that the Pt–MWCNT CE has a higher catalytic activity than the bare Pt CE. J0 can be also calculated by eqn (1), where Rct is the charge transfer resistance obtained from EIS spectra (Fig. 5b), R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is Faraday's constant. And the calculated J0 values also follow the order of Pt–MWCNTs > Pt. (1)
CV is used to characterize the catalytic activity of CE materials. The CV plot for the Pt and Pt–MWCNT electrodes with good catalytic activity shows two pairs of apparent oxidative and reductive peaks (O-1/R-1, O-2/R-2) in Fig. 5d. The left pair of redox peaks are assigned as the reaction of eqn (2), while the right pair as the reaction of eqn (3): I3− + 2e = 3I−(2) 3I2 + 2e = 2I3−(3)
The characteristics of the peaks (O-1 and R-1) are investigated to further understand the electrocatalytic process of redox mediators on various CEs because oxidized ions (triiodide) in the electrolyte diffuse to the CE and are finally reduced to iodide on the surface of the CE. As shown in Fig. 5d, the CEs based on the Pt–MWCNT nanocomposites and Pt showed very similar shapes in terms of redox peak positions. Comparing the current densities of samples, the Pt–MWCNT nanocomposites exhibited higher values than the Pt, suggesting a higher intrinsic catalytic activity for redox reaction of iodide ions. From the positive shift of the redox peaks of Pt, it can be obtained that the redox potential value of Pt is more positive than that of nanocomposites. As earlier literature described, VOC was dependent upon the difference between the potential of the dye-sensitized TiO2 film and the redox equilibrium potential of the electrolyte. In Fig. 5d, there is clearly a positive shift of redox equilibrium potential on Pt compared with Pt–MWCNTs which results in a higher VOC.31,32 The CV results support the photovoltaic performance.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile and low-cost strategy using free radicals attacked MPA for synthesis of low Pt-loading composites which would be beneficial for improving the bonding strength between carbon CE materials and the substrate, and meanwhile have a tight control of Pt nanoparticle size. The newly developed Pt–MWCNT CE material shows a better photovoltaic performance than the conventional Pt electrode, which is because of the improvement of the FF value and a better catalytic activity resulted from the ultra-small Pt nanoparticle size. Furthermore, the low weight ratio of the Pt–MWCNT composite corresponds to the objective of low-cost and this design strategy would be very promising to pave the way for the commercialization of DSCs.
