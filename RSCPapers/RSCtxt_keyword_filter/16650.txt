    , Accepted 29th July 2019First published on 13th August 2019AbstractThe ternary blend strategy has the potential to enhance spectral coverage and boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Besides the consideration of complementary absorption to broaden the solar spectral coverage with a combination of multiple photoactive materials, a third component plays a vital role in morphological evolution and photophysical processes in the blend films which dominates the final photovoltaic performance of the devices. Herein, we fabricated a kind of ternary OSC that consists of one donor polymer PBDB-TF and two non-fullerene molecular acceptors IT-4F and O6T-4F. With elaborate optimization of the IT-4F:O6T-4F ratio, the ternary OSCs achieve a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 21.60 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.746, leading to an overall PCE of 13.37%. Compared to the control OSCs based on the binary PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend, the JSC and PCE of the ternary devices are increased by 10.5% and 8.8%, respectively. A detailed study discloses that incorporation of a small amount of low-bandgap O6T-4F into the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend not only favors the optimization of the interpenetrating donor/acceptor morphology, but also improves the exciton utilization via energy transfer from IT-4F to O6T-4F and extends the spectral coverage. Moreover, such a kind of ternary OSC shows excellent independence of active layer thicknesses with PCEs up to 12% when the active layer thickness is increased to 300 nm.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising candidate for green renewable energy resources due to their unique advantages, such as being lightweight, flexible and semitransparent and can be fabricated by solution processing.1–6 The rapid development of novel donor and acceptor materials, especially the development of new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, has strongly boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs in recent years7–17 and the PCE of single-junction OSCs has exceeded 16% more recently.18 In contrast to typical fullerene acceptors, NFAs show tunable energy levels and strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions and thus allow reducing energy loss and enhancing absorption coverage in combination with suitable donor materials.19–27 In order to realize high PCE of OSCs, factors including solar light harvesting efficiency, efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection in the photoactive layer should be well optimized. Light harvesting efficiency largely relies on the intrinsic properties of donor and acceptor materials, while the exciton dissociation and charge collection are strongly dependent on the donor/acceptor blend morphology. In particular for the blends with all the components contributing to the optical absorption, efficient dissociation of excitons formed on both donors and acceptors is crucial for maximizing the photocurrent.
The ternary blend strategy has been widely used to further boost the PCE of OSCs in recent years.28–38 The ternary blend can provide more efficient absorption coverage in the solar spectrum relative to the binary blend, and also provide a simple device structure and fabrication process in comparison to tandem OSCs. In addition, such a kind of ternary OSC with thick active layers has shown superior PCE, rendering it more competitive in print manufacturing.32,39,40 The introduction of a third component may severely complicate the primary donor/acceptor interpenetrating networks, though some research studies have reported that the elaborate selection of a third donor or acceptor may further modify the ternary blend morphology to achieve an enhanced photovoltaic performance.34,38,41–48 To date, a lot of novel NFAs with tunable energy levels and different absorption regions have been synthesized, providing more choices for constructing efficient ternary OSCs. Ternary blends based on one polymer donor and two non-fullerene acceptors have been successfully reported to fabricate high-efficiency OSCs.19,31,34,37,43,49–54 The effect of a third component on the blend morphology and the photoelectric conversion process is quite different. The third component may be located at the primary donor/acceptor interfaces, be imbedded in one of the donor or acceptor phases, or form a parallel-like or alloy structure with another component due to different spatial distributions.55 However, the photophysical process during photoelectric conversion in such a kind of ternary blend has rarely been reported. Deep insight into the role of a second acceptor in photoelectric conversion may be helpful for the design of ternary OSCs.
Herein, we report a new kind of ternary OSC consisting of the polymer donor PBDB-TF and two non-fullerene acceptors IT-4F and O6T-4F. The effect of O6T-4F on the blend morphology and the photophysical process has been investigated in detail. It has been found that incorporating a small amount of low-bandgap O6T-4F into the primary PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend is helpful for further increasing the PCE of the resultant OSCs. This study shows that a small amount of O6T-4F may act as a solid additive to optimize the primary PBDB-TF/IT-4F interpenetrating morphology and improve the hole and electron transport. More importantly, the transient absorption experiment shows that the energy transfer from IT-4F to O6T-4F enables extra exciton dissociation on O6T-4F to increase charge generation. The O6T-4F itself helps extending the spectral absorption and contributes to the photocurrent due to its narrow bandgap. However, when the content of the O6T-4F component is dominant, the poor film morphology and the low ability of hole extraction from O6T-4F to PBDB-TF would result in inferior photovoltaic performance though the absorption coverage has remarkably improved. The optimized ternary OSCs exhibit an overall PCE of 13.37%, about 8.8% increase compared to binary PBDB-TF:IT-4F-based devices. Such a kind of ternary OSC exhibits excellent independence of active layer thicknesses with PCEs up to 12% when the active layer thickness is increased to 300 nm.
2. Results and discussion
The polymer PBDB-TF and the non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F were chosen as the electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively, due to their strong and complementary absorption in the visible region and appropriate blend morphology to obtain high photovoltaic performance.56 The non-fullerene acceptor O6T-4F is used as a second acceptor.9 Their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1a. The O6T-4F shows strong absorption in the near-infrared region. In addition, O6T-4F and IT-4F have similar molecular structures and electron-withdrawing moieties. The normalized absorption spectra of the three materials are shown in Fig. 1b. It can be seen that PBDB-TF, IT-4F and O6T-4F show distinct absorption peaks at about 570 nm, 730 nm and 850 nm, respectively. A wide absorption spectral coverage from 300 nm to 950 nm can be realized by combining the three materials. The changes of the absorption spectra of the binary and ternary blend films with different IT-4F/O6T-4F acceptor ratios are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The energy level diagrams of the three materials are shown in Fig. 1c. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PBDB-TF, IT-4F and O6T-4F are measured to be −3.51/−5.54 eV, −3.99/−5.57 eV and −4.00/−5.32 eV, respectively, according to the CV measurements provided in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It seems that the hole transfer from O6T-4F to PBDB-TF is difficult to occur based on their HOMO/HOMO level alignment. However, the hole transfer from O6T-4F to PBDB-TF does occur in the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F blend OSCs as described below.

All the OSCs in this study were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. The weight ratio of donor:acceptor (IT-4F + O6T-4F) was maintained at 1:1, while the content of the second acceptor O6T-4F was carefully scanned. The photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs based on the PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F blend active layers with various IT-4F/O6T-4F acceptor ratios are summarized in Table 1. The binary devices based on the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend show an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.84 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.55 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.748, leading to a PCE of 12.29%. The binary devices based on the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F blend merely show a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 16.37 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.558 and a final PCE of 7.22%. The inferior PCE of the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F OSCs is mainly due to their low JSC and FF, though the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F blend shows a wider absorption coverage than the PBDB-TF:IT-4F. When a content of 15% O6T-4F is introduced into the active layer, the JSC is significantly increased from 19.55 to 21.60 mA cm−2 and contributes to achieving the highest PCE of 13.37% for ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) devices. The addition of a content of 15% O6T-4F in PBDB-TF:IT-4F does not distinctively decrease the VOC (0.83 V vs. 0.84 V) and the FF (0.746 vs. 0.748). However, when 20% O6T-4F is added into the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend, the PCE of the resultant device is decreased to 12.17%. Both the JSC and FF are slightly decreased compared to those in the optimized PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15)-based devices. The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the corresponding photovoltaic devices are plotted in Fig. 2a. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the ternary devices with other IT-4F:O6T-4F ratios are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).

(c) Photocurrent–effective voltage curves and (d) dependence of JSC on the illuminated light intensity for the OSCs based on the PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F blend with ratios of 1:1:0, 1:0.85:0.15, and 1:0:1, respectively. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding OSCs were measured to confirm the contribution of individual components to the photocurrent and the reliability of the measured JSC values from J–V curves. As shown in Fig. 2b, the device based on the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend exhibits a high EQE profile in the 400–800 nm region with an EQE peak up to 70%. As for the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F-based device, the EQE profile covers a wide and flat region of 400–900 nm. However, its maximum EQE is merely 50%, much lower than the PBDB-TF:IT-4F-based device indicating the poor exciton dissociation and charge collection in the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F blend film. For the optimized PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) devices, not only the EQE profile in the range of 400–800 nm is slightly enhanced, but also a distinctive photoresponse from O6T-4F is observed. This indicates that a small amount of O6T-4F is beneficial for the formation of well-connected interpenetrating donor/acceptor networks and meanwhile the introduction of O6T-4F extends the absorption coverage contributing to the increased photocurrent. Although the photoelectric response from O6T-4F is increased with further increase of the O6T-4F content, the EQE profile in the 400–800 nm range is decreased, for example in the PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.8:0.2) blend based device. Such changes lead to a decrease in JSC. The FF of the corresponding devices is also lowered. The integral current density values from EQE are consistent with the JSC values measured from the J–V test for all the devices (about 5% error).
The relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was investigated to figure out the impact of O6T-4F on charge generation and collection efficiency in the blend films. Jph is defined as the difference between the illuminated current density (JL) and the dark current density (JD). Veff is the applied voltage corrected by V0 at which Jph is equal to 0. It is assumed that all the generated free charges are collected by the respective electrodes without loss when the Veff is higher than 2 V and the saturation current density (Jsat) is achieved. As shown in Fig. 2c, the calculated Jsat for the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1), PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) and PBDB-TF:O6T-4F (1:1) based OSCs are 20.06, 22.19, and 16.75 mA cm−2, respectively. The optimized PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) ternary device exhibits the highest Jsat suggesting the most efficient charge generation in this ternary blend. The charge extraction efficiency expressed as P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat can be used to describe the charge-collection ability in the blend films. Under short-circuit conditions, the P(E,T) values are calculated to be 98.3%, 98.4% and 93.6% for the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1), PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) and PBDB-TF:O6T-4F (1:1) OSCs, respectively. Both PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) and PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) OSCs show excellent charge extraction capability, implying their good charge-transporting networks in the blend films. However, the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F-based device shows a relatively poor charge extraction efficiency possibly originated from its poor blend morphology. The dependence of JSC on light intensity (JSC ∝ Pαlight) is also measured to investigate the bimolecular recombination in various devices and the results are shown in Fig. 2d. The more close to 1 the parameter α is, the more weak the bimolecular recombination is. In the case of the binary PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1)-based device, α is equal to 0.956. The value of α is increased to 0.984 for the PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F-based (1:0.85:0.15) OSCs. This result indicates that the addition of a small amount of O6T-4F may further improve the blend morphology and lower the bimolecular recombination. As for the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F-based (1:1) device, the α value is merely 0.912 indicating the existence of severe bimolecular recombination in the blend film.
The electron and hole mobilities of the binary or ternary blend films were evaluated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEIE/active layer/PFN-Br/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al. The calculated electron and hole mobilities are listed in Table 1. The electron and hole mobilities of PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend are 2.11 × 10−4 and 6.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron and hole mobilities are slightly increased to 2.56 × 10−4 and 7.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively in the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend, indicating that the introduction of a small amount of O6T-4F improves the hole- and electron-transporting networks. However, the electron and hole mobilities are decreased to 2.09 × 10−4 and 6.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, when the content of O6T-4F is over 20%. The PBDB-TF:O6T-4F based device shows the lowest charge transport ability with electron and hole mobilities of 7.3 × 10−5 and 5.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This means that the morphology is not inclined to form interpenetrating pathways when the O6T-4F content is dominant in the blend, which leads to inferior JSC and FF in the resultant devices.
The atom force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1), PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) and PBDB-TF:O6T-4F (1:1) blend films are shown in Fig. 3. It is obvious that the bi-continuous charge-transporting networks are formed in the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) and PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend films. Such a kind of morphology is favorable for efficient charge extraction leading to a high FF of the devices. However, the fiber-like phase separation is not obviously observed in the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F blend film as shown in Fig. 3c. Some isolated domains are found in the AFM image for the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F (1:1) blend film, which is inefficient to transport the generated charges and hence results in a low FF of the devices. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F (1:1) blend film is about 6.0 nm. When 15% O6T-4F is introduced, the RMS of the resultant ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend film is decreased to 2.2 nm. This may imply that the dominated PBDB-TF:IT-4F phase separation is decreased with addition of a small amount of O6T-4F. The PBDB-TF:O6T-4F (1:1) blend film also shows a small RMS of 3.8 nm. It is speculated that the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend morphology is suitable for charge transport and collection. However, the formed morphology of the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F blend is not suitable for charge transport and collection. A small amount of O6T-4F in the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend does not destroy the well-formed PBDB-TF:IT-4F charge-transporting pathways. At the same time, the introduction of O6T-4F further improves the exciton dissociation originated from the more favorable morphology and extends the absorption coverage contributing to an increased JSC.

Such a kind of morphological variance in the ternary blends may be correlated with the interaction among the materials. Thus, the absorption spectra of the binary or ternary blend films were investigated to figure out the effect of O6T-4F on the ternary blend morphology evolution. The O6T-4F absorption peak shifts with the IT-4F:O6T-4F ratio in PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F and PMMA:IT-4F:O6T-4F films are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The ratio between PBDB-TF (or insulated PMMA) and acceptors is fixed at 1:1. The detailed absorption of these blend films is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It is seen that the O6T-4F absorption peak is located at 855 nm in the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F (1:1) blend. However, it shifts abnormally to 907 nm when the O6T-4F ratio decreases to 20% in the acceptor. This phenomenon demonstrates that there is intermolecular interaction between IT-4F and O6T-4F leading to an O6T-4F absorption redshift. Meanwhile, the absorption peak (628 nm) of PBDB-TF does not show a distinct shift in all the blended films, indicating that PBDB-TF has no interaction with IT-4F or O6T-4F. In order to further exclude the effect of PBDB-TF on O6T-4F absorption, a control blend film of PMMA:IT-4F:O6T-4F with insulating PMMA to replace PBDB-TF was also prepared. Insulated PMMA has a non-conjugated structure and is almost transparent in the range of 300–1000 nm. As shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), the redshift of O6T-4F absorption does exist in PMMA:IT-4F:O6T-4F blend films. This confirms that the interaction between IT-4F and O6T-4F causes the O6T-4F absorption redshift. The absorption redshift of O6T-4F is attributed to J-type π–π stacking.57 The interaction between O6T-4F and IT-4F favors the formation of more efficient PBDB-TF/IT-4F interpenetrating networks when a small amount of O6T-4F is introduced.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the neat and blend films are measured to probe the charge transfer status. The excitation wavelengths of PBDB-TF and IT-4F are selected at 580 nm and 630 nm, respectively. The PL emission of PBDB-TF located at 700 nm is effectively quenched in PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F blends with ratios of 1:1:0, 1:0.85:0.15, and 1:0:1 as shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†). This indicates that the excitons formed on PBDB-TF can be effectively separated in all blend films due to efficient electron transfer to acceptors. However, there is still residual PL of IT-4F around 800 nm in the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend film as shown in Fig. S5b (ESI†), indicating that a small amount of excitons located on IT-4F cannot contribute to the photocurrent. When 15% O6T-4F is introduced, the PL of IT-4F in the ternary blend is quenched completely compared to the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend, which might be ascribed to the possible long-distance energy transfer from IT-4F to O6T-4F according to the overlap of the absorption of O6T-4F and the PL of IT-4F at 750–900 nm as discussed below.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was performed by using an ultrafast (100 fs) pump–probe system. Since the PL spectrum of IT-4F shows a good coverage with the absorption of O6T-4F, the possible energy transfer from IT-4F to O6T-4F is evaluated by TAS. The neat IT-4F and IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:1) blend films are pumped at 550 nm to excite IT-4F only and the corresponding TA spectra are shown in Fig. 4. There is an obvious excited state absorption (ESA) band located at 960 nm in the neat IT-4F film, which is attributed to the exciton absorption of IT-4F. When blended with 50% O6T-4F, the ESA of IT-4F at 960 nm is absent and a characteristic ESA peak of O6T-4F at 1040 nm is presented according to the TAS of the neat O6T-4F film shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The ground state bleaching (GSB) signal originated from O6T-4F at 900 nm is also observed in the IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:1) blend film. Since O6T-4F does not exhibit absorption at 550 nm, the ESA signal of O6T-4F can be attributed to the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from IT-4F to O6T-4F, which occurs within 500 fs. A similar timescale of energy transfer has been also observed by other researchers.58

The photophysical process in the binary and ternary blends was further explored via TAS technology. The pump wavelength was set at 750 nm to excite both IT-4F and O6T-4F acceptors. The TA spectra of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F blends with various ratios are shown in Fig. 5a–c. The TA spectra of pure IT-4F and O6T-4F films are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The GSB signal dominated by PBDB-TF at about 580 nm in the binary and ternary blends is clearly observed in Fig. 5a–c in agreement with the steady absorption spectra. Since PBDB-TF cannot be excited at 750 nm, its GSB signal originated from hole transfer from the acceptors. It should be noted that the GSB intensity of PBDB-TF is much weaker in the PBDB-TF:O6T-4F film as shown in Fig. 5c, implying that the hole transfer from O6T-4F to PBDB-TF is not very efficient. This phenomenon agrees well with the HOMO level alignment at PBDB-TF/O6T-4F interfaces, which is unfavorable for hole transfer from O6T-4F to PBDB-TF. The GSB kinetic traces of PBDB-TF in various blend films are shown in Fig. 5d. In the case of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend film, the GSB signal at 580 nm shows the highest intensity of 0.0032 at around 20 ps. The GSB values in binary PBDB-TF:IT-4F and PBDB-TF:O6T-4F films are 0.0025 and 0.0010, respectively. This implies more efficient hole transfer from the acceptors to the donors in the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend film. The ESA decay of the three blend films at 1350 nm is shown in Fig. 5e. It is noticed that there is an obvious rising component in the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend, which is absent both in PBDB-TF:IT-4F and PBDB-TF:O6T-4F blend films. According to the data shown in Fig. 5a–c, it is speculated that the characteristic ESA signal at 1350 nm may be mainly attributed to the charged species of O6T-4F. For the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend film, there is an early decay (<5 ps), a rise at 5–1000 ps and a subsequent decay. The early decay of the three blend films is quite similar. The rising ESA signal at 5–1000 ps may originate from exciton diffusion in the IT-4F domain and its subsequent energy transfer to O6T-4F. The excitons formed on the IT-4F domains diffuse within its lifetime and then undergo energy transfer from IT-4F to O6T-4F. The excitons on O6T-4F are subsequently dissociated into charges at the PBDB-TF/O6T-4F interfaces resulting in an obvious increase in the ESA signal (1350 nm). This also accounts for the enhancement of the IT-4F PL quenching efficiency in the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend film compared to the control PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend as shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† The proposed charge transfer and energy transfer in the PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend is shown in Fig. 5f. In the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) blend, O6T-4F not only absorbs near-infrared light, but also improves the dissociation of excitons formed on IT-4F leading to an increased photocurrent.

High-efficiency OSCs based on a thick photoactive layer are highly significant since they provide a feasibility to be commercially manufactured with printing technology. The ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F (1:0.85:0.15) OSCs with active layer thicknesses being varied from 100 nm to 300 nm were also fabricated to test the dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the active layer thicknesses. Their illuminated J–V curves and PCE changes are shown in Fig. 6. It is seen that the JSC is increased with the active layer thickness being increased up to 300 nm. However, the FF and VOC are slightly decreased when the active layer thickness is over 200 nm. In general, the PCE of the ternary OSCs shows a slow decay with the increase in the active layer thickness. The PCE is still over 12% when the active layer thickness is increased to 300 nm. The active layer thickness-independent characteristic of the ternary PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F OSCs is superior compared to that of the ternary OSCs reported.59

3. Conclusions
In summary, a kind of high-efficiency ternary organic solar cell consisting of one donor polymer PBDB-TF and two non-fullerene molecular acceptors IT-4F and O6T-4F has been fabricated. The second acceptor O6T-4F shows strong absorption in the near-infrared region and can be used to extend the spectral coverage. With elaborate optimization of the IT-4F:O6T-4F acceptor ratio, the ternary OSCs exhibit a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 21.60 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.746, leading to an overall PCE of 13.37%. The JSC and PCE are increased by 10.5% and 8.8% respectively, compared to those of the OSCs based on the binary PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend. The effect of O6T-4F on the photovoltaic enhancement has been studied in detail. It is disclosed that the incorporation of a small amount of low-bandgap O6T-4F into the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend not only favors the optimization of the interpenetrating donor/acceptor morphology, but also improves the exciton utilization via energy transfer from IT-4F to O6T-4F and extends the spectral coverage. Such a kind of ternary OSC exhibits excellent independence of active layer thicknesses with PCEs up to 12% when the thickness of the active layer is increased to 300 nm.
4. Experimental section
Materials
PBDB-TF, IT-4F and PFN-Br used in this study were bought from Solarmer Materials Inc., and O6T-4F was obtained from One-Material Inc. The solvents and additives were bought from Sigma Aldrich Co. All the materials and solvents were used without further purification.
Device fabrication
The patterned ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω □−1 were cleaned with detergent, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water in sequence. The cleaned ITO glass substrates were dried and then were subjected to UV-Ozone treatment before use. The PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrates at 3000 rpm to produce a 40 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS layer. The PBDB-TF:IT-4F:O6T-4F with various weight ratios was dissolved in chlorobenzene. The solution was stirred at 40 °C for 10 hours. 1% DIO (v/v) was added into the solution just before depositing the photoactive layer onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The active layer thickness was controlled by tuning the solution concentration and the spincoating rate. After spin-coating the photoactive layer, the samples were annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes. PFN-Br was dissolved in methanol solution at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 and a thin PFN-Br layer was deposited on the photoactive layer via spincoating at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. Finally, the Al cathode (100 nm) was thermally deposited in a vacuum chamber with a shadow mask. The effective area of the photovoltaic devices is 8 mm2.
Film and device characterization
The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were tested using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated solar light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorometer, respectively. The EQE spectra were tested using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R 3011, Enli Tech. Co.). The thicknesses of the blend films were measured using a surface profilometer. The AFM measurements were carried out using a Veeco Instruments Nanoscope in tapping mode. The TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope with a working voltage of 100 kV. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660a electrochemical workstation using ferrocene as an internal reference at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels were calculated according to the equation: ELUMO/HOMO = −(4.80 + Eredonset/Eoxonset). TAS was performed using an ultrafast (100 fs) system (HELIOS Fire spectrometer). Pump light with 10 nJ pulse−1 was used to excite samples and white light to probe the absorption changes (ΔA). All samples for the TAS experiment were prepared with the same thickness of about 90 nm. All spectra were corrected by chirp correction with processing software.
