    AbstractThis study reports the solvothermal synthesis of colloidal CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) for use as sensitizers for photoelectrochemical cells. The synthesis is conducted in an autoclave containing CuCl, InCl3, and S at a Cu/In/S ratio of 1/1/100. This high sulfur-excess environment leads to burst nucleation of CuInS2 at relatively low temperatures. For synthesis conducted at 110–150 °C for 1 h, the atomic ratio of the CuInS2 products is Cu:In:S = 1.1:1.0:2.1 and the particle size increases with the temperature from 3.5 to 4.3 nm, with a narrow size distribution within 7–11%. The as-prepared colloidal CuInS2 exhibits the quantum confinement effect in the optical absorption spectra. The photoluminescence emission of the resulting CuInS2 QDs has high energy, which may result from excited electrons falling from quantized levels to the ground states. Under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G at one sun intensity, the CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 electrodes in aqueous sulfide/sulfite electrolyte show light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiencies of 1.9% at a +0.23 V bias and 1.2% at short-circuit. These encouraging conversion efficiencies are attributed to the high energy state of the photoexcited electrons in the CuInS2 QDs.
Introduction
The preparation, characterization, and application of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has received much attention in the past two decades.1–9 The nanometre-sized scale of QDs confines electrons in a small box and quantizes the energy band possessed by bulk materials into discrete energy states.10–15 In the size regime exhibiting the quantization effect, the band gap of semiconducting materials can be tunable to a desired energy by changing the particle size.16–20 Because their unique optical and electrical properties are distinct from those of bulk materials, semiconductor QDs are useful in a variety of biological investigations,21–24 light-emitting diodes,25–27 and photovoltaic devices.28–34 Because of their high quantum yield and tunable fluorescence properties, II–VI-type semiconductor QDs such as CdSe, CdS, and PbS, are often chosen for optical and photovoltaic applications. However, the use of toxic heavy metals is becoming more difficult for many applications in some nations today. Ternary chalcopyrites, CuME2 (M = Ga, In; E = S, Se, Te) are attractive alternatives due to their relatively low toxicity and excellent performance in thin-film photovoltaic devices.35–38 Among the various CuME2 compounds, CuInS2 is promising for photovoltaic applications owing to its high absorption coefficient and direct bandgap well matched to the solar spectrum. Additionally, the hole energy barrier at grain boundaries and the random p-n junction throughout the polycrystalline configuration lead to high photovoltaic conversion efficiency in the ternary chalcopyrite thin films.39 Thus, facile synthesis of CuInS2 QDs can greatly improve the photovoltaic performance and versatile application of CuInS2.
The synthesis of thin-film CuInS2 has been extensively explored.40–43 However, relatively few studies have reported the synthesis of colloidal CuInS2 QDs. In QD synthesis, controlling defects and crystallinity is vital for luminescence and photovoltaic applications. Table 1 summarizes previous studies on the synthesis of CuInS2 nanoparticles, briefly describing previous synthesis recipes.39,44–55 The methods employed for nanoparticle production can be divided into two categories: molecular source decomposition and solution synthesis. Molecular precursor decomposition generally produces CuInS2 QDs, while solution synthesis produces nanoparticles with sizes larger than the quantization effect limit. Although the decomposition method is straightforward, it has disadvantages such as being atmosphere sensitive and requiring expensive starting materials and cumbersome precursor synthesis steps.44 As for solution synthesis, Nakamura et al. was able to synthesize CuInS2 QDs in a solvothermal system.55 However, these QDs showed poor optical properties, and the introduction of Zn could significantly enhance their optical performance. In contrast to decomposition methods, the solution method is more expandable and facile in material preparation.

The literature survey above indicates that preparing monodisperse ternary chalcopyrite QDs with good optical properties in a solution system is still a challenge. The reaction conditions given in Table 1 indicate that the solution method generally requires a long reaction time. The large particle size resulting from solution synthesis can be attributed to a failure to achieve burst nucleation and the occurrence of Ostwald ripening, which leads to the formation of larger particles.56 Therefore, accurately controlling the nucleation and the subsequent crystal growth is a key issue in preparing high-quality QDs from solution synthesis.
In addition to optical properties, the separation of photogenerated charges in QDs and their subsequent travel across the QD boundary are important issues governing the applicability of QDs in photovoltaic systems. Instead of constituting polycrystalline films, QDs can enable more efficient charge separation by serving as sensitizers for wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2. QDs have been used as sensitizers to replace molecular dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)57,58 and to activate water splitting reaction on TiO2 under visible light illumination. In addition to the capability of tuning energetics by controlling the QD size, QDs are advantageous over molecular dyes in photon energy conversion by having a larger extinction coefficient59 and inducing multiple exciton generation via the impact ionization effect.60 II–VI-type semiconductor QDs offer high quantum yields and can be prepared easily.32,61 However, II–VI-type semiconductor QDs corresponding to visible or near-infrared absorption contain Cd, Hg, or Pb. This study proposes the use of ternary chalcopyrite QDs to replace II–VI-type QDs and specifically examines the photovoltaic characteristics of the resulting CuInS2 QDs with a photoelectrochemical system.
This study presents the facile solvothermal synthesis of nearly monodisperse colloidal CuInS2 QDs with diameters smaller than 5 nm. Inorganic Cu and In salts and elemental S served as the starting materials for this synthesis. The key feature of this synthesis is to use highly excess S relative to Cu and In and conduct the reaction at a relatively low temperature. The resulting nanocrystals exhibit the quantum confinement effect in the optical absorption spectra. This study then uses CuInS2 QDs as a sensitizer to activate TiO2 nanocrystalline films for water decomposition under simulated solar illumination. The QDs were anchored to TiO2 surface via a bifunctional linker molecule. Preliminary results show that CuInS2 QDs are a promising sensitizer material for applications in photovoltaic systems.
Results and discussion
The successful synthesis of high-quality monodisperse QDs must start with a swift and short nucleation from supersaturated reactants, followed by growth without further nucleation.56 After the initial period of nucleation, the concentration of reactants decreases steadily with particle growth. Particles with sizes smaller than the critical nuclei radius, which is a decreasing function of the reactant concentration, dissolve. This leads to an undesired defocusing of size distribution; i.e., Ostwald ripening occurs. In this study, the amount of sulfur in the reacting solution was 50 times the stoichiometric ratio for CuInS2 (i.e., Cu/In/S = 1/1/100). This high excess-sulfur situation significantly enhanced the reaction of the metal chlorides (CuCl and InCl3) with sulfur, resulting in a short nucleation stage. This synthetic tactic is advantageous over the typical one-pot synthesis,56,62,63 which requires a relatively high injection temperature (usually above 250 °C) to generate burst nucleation.
This study conducted solvothermal synthesis of CuInS2 QDs at relatively low temperatures ranging from 110–170 °C. Fig. 1(a) and (b) illustrate typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the CuInS2 products, showing that QDs synthesized at 150 and 170 °C. Based on Image-Pro Plus 4.5 estimations, the particle sizes for the products synthesized at 110, 130, 150, and 170 °C were 3.5 ± 0.4, 4.1 ± 0.4, 4.3 ± 0.3, and 4.8 ± 0.9 nm (i.e., the mean size ± standard deviation), respectively. The number of particles measured for each specimen was at least 50. The size distribution (or relative standard deviation) was within 7–11% for QDs synthesized at 110–150 °C. This indicates that size-defocusing due to Ostwald ripening did not affect crystal growth at synthesis temperatures lower than 150 °C, enabling a good monodispersity in size distribution. The average particle size increased from 3.5 to 4.1 nm as the temperature increased from 110 to 130 °C, and the size increased slightly (to 4.3 nm) as the temperature increased further to 150 °C. This indicates that the metal ions were nearly exhausted at 130 °C, as a further increase in synthesis temperature did not effectively promote crystal growth. When the synthesis was conducted at 170 °C, the mean particle size increased to 4.8 nm, with the size distribution broadening to 19%. At this temperature the reaction is fast, so that the metal ions are exhausted and Ostwald ripening begins to increase the size distribution. Fig. 1(c) shows a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the CuInS2 specimen obtained from 150 °C solvothermal synthesis. The visible lattice fringe indicates that the as-prepared CuInS2 QDs are highly crystalline. The observed lattice spacing was calculated to be ca. 0.31 nm, corresponding to that of the (112) planes of CuInS2. The selected-area electron diffraction pattern of the same specimen in Fig. 1(d) can be indexed according to the documented tetragonal CuInS2 structure (JCPDS file no. 85–1575).

(d) Selected-area electron diffraction pattern of the 150 °C CuInS2 QDs. The arrows point to where the vertical white line crosses the crystal face rings. 
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the 150 °C specimen (Fig. 2) confirms the tetragonal chalcopyrite structure of CuInS2. The diffraction peaks were quite broad, which is typical of crystalline QD materials.18,64 Using the Debye–Scherrer formula for the (112) diffraction line, the crystal size of the 150 °C CuInS2 QDs was calculated to be ca. 4.1 nm, which is close to the TEM observation. The above analyses with HRTEM, electron diffraction, and XRD demonstrate that the QDs obtained from this developed solvothermal method are in the tetragonal chalcopyrite CuInS2 phase.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis shows that the atomic composition ratio of Cu, In, and S varied little for all these CuInS2 QDs, with an average composition ratio of 1.1:1.0:2.1, with a standard deviation of 0.2 for each value. This ratio indicates the presence of intrinsic defects in the QD specimens. However, considering the large surface-to-volume ratio of QDs, the atomic composition ratio observed in this present study agrees well with CuInS2 stoichiometry. In addition, previous studies generally used thiol-containing ligands to cap the surface of nanocrystals during synthesis, and an excess of sulfur was expected from chemical composition analysis.45,46,48,54 In contrast, we used OA as the capping ligand for the products, and the chemical composition determined here was somewhat more realistic than those determined with thiol-capped QDs. The intactness of the nanocrystals synthesized in this study greatly influences their photoluminescence and photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 3(a) shows the UV–visible absorption spectra of the colloidal CuInS2 QDs. The absorption onset shifted to longer wavelengths when the synthesis temperature increased. A broad shoulder appears between 550 and 650 nm with a long tail extending to longer wavelengths. A vague band-edge absorption feature appeared for the family of chalcopyrite colloidal QDs synthesized from different methods.45,47,49,65–67 Because CuInS2 is a direct transition semiconductor, the direct gap transition energy of each specimen can be determined by plotting (ahν)2 against the photon energy (hν), where a is the absorbance, h is the Plank's constant, and ν is photon frequency. Fig. 3(b) shows that gap transition energy varied from 2.1–1.8 eV (i.e. 600–680 nm) for the CuInS2 specimens, and is a decreasing function of the solvothermal synthesis temperature. The distinct blue-shift of the absorption wavelength of these CuInS2 specimens relative to that of bulk CuInS2 (ca. 826 nm) indicates that the size of the CuInS2 synthesized in this study is in the quantum confinement region. Fig. 4 shows photographs of the OA-capped CuInS2/hexane dispersions obtained at different synthesis temperatures. Due to the quantum confinement effect in the optics, the color of the QD dispersions varies: orange for 110 °C, brown for 130 and 150 °C, and black for 170 °C.

For a spherical particle that is smaller than the bulk exciton, i.e., when the quantum confinement becomes effective, the size dependence of band gap energy, E(R), can be given by the following effective-mass approximation14 (1)where R is the particle radius, Eg is the bulk band gap (1.5 eV for CuInS2), ħ is the reduced Planck constant, me and mh are the effective masses of the electron and the hole, respectively, e is the elementary charge, ε is the bulk dielectric constant, and E*Ry is the effective Rydberg energy, which is equal to e4/(2ε2ħ2(me−1 + mh−1)). Fig. 5 shows the calculated size-dependent band gaps based on eqn. (1), using the CuInS2 bulk values of ε = 11, me = 0.16m0 and mh = 1.3m0,65 where m0 is the electron mass. Fig. 5 compares the experimental (from Fig. 3(b)) and calculated band gaps and shows that the experimental data were slightly smaller and the deviation from the calculated results increased as the particle size decreased. This deviation can be ascribed to the inappropriate assumption of a parabolic energy band in the effective-mass approximation14 and the increasing effective mass with decreasing QD sizes.10 Notwithstanding, we justifies that the optical band gap of CuInS2 specimens of 3.5–4.8 nm in size is affected by the quantum confinement effect.

Fig. 6(a) shows the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the OA-capped CuInS2 QDs excited at 500 nm. All the specimens exhibited PL emission peaks at 525, 540, 580, and 750 nm, with the strongest emission at 540 nm. PL emission patterns are similar for all specimens. The PL properties of these semiconductor QDs are strongly dependent on their surface states, due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of QDs.68–70 To examine the effect of surface-capping ligands on the PL emission, other ligands, trioctylphosphine (TOP), hexanethiol (HT), and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), are used to exchange with OA. Fig. 6(b) compares the emission spectra of 170 °C CuInS2 QDs capped with different ligands, showing that the emission peak positions do not change after the capping ligand exchange. The PL intensities with different ligands have an order of TOP > OA > HT ≅ MPA, with PL quantum yields of 1.2, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.3%, respectively. Because Cu+ ion is classified as a soft Lewis acid,71 the Lewis base atoms in ligands have a binding strength for CuInS2 in the order of P > S > N. The quantum yield enhancement due to OA exchange with TOP can be ascribed to the stronger binding ability of the phosphorous atoms contained in TOP relative to that of the nitrogen atoms in OA, leading to better passivation of the surface states with TOP. Thiol is typically a stronger chelating base than amine ligands for soft acids. Contrary to the expectations, exchanging OA with thiols (MPA and HT) quenched the luminescence of CuInS2 QDs. The hole trapping capacity of thiol groups on CuInS2 QDs is a possible explanation for this PL quenching. Fig. 7 shows schematic energy level diagrams of the CuInS2 band edges and the thiol redox energy level.68,72 Because thiol has a higher redox energy level than the valence band edge of CuInS2, the trapping of photogenerated holes from the valence band of CuInS2 by the thiol groups is energetically favorable and very efficient. Transferring the hole to the thiols reduces the radiative recombination significantly, resulting in the PL quenching observed in this study. Moreover, a trend toward lower quantum yields as the size of the thiol-capped QDs decreases (not shown) indicates more favorable hole trapping on the thiol group as a result of lowering the valence band edge of the CuInS2 QDs due to the quantum confinement effect. A similar hole-trapping process was observed for CdS and CdSe QDs.68,70,73

 Fig. 7  Band edge positions of bulk CuInS2 depicted on the scale with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode reference (NHE).62,74 Hole trapping can occur on CuInS2via a surface-capping thiol, which has a standard redox potential higher than the valence band edge of CuInS2 and quenches the CuInS2 luminescence. 
Interestingly, the PL energy of the CuInS2 QDs was greater than the gap-transition energy obtained from the absorption spectra, indicating that the emission resulted from excited electrons falling from quantized discrete levels higher than the band edge to the ground states. Most previous studies found PL emission from CuInS2 nanocrystals with wavelengths longer than 600 nm.45,46,48,55 Castro et al. attributed these emission bands to intraband donor–acceptor transitions.45 Nevertheless, the strong PL emission at 540 nm observed in the present study is similar to that reported by Nairn et al. for excitation at 500 nm.49 Nairn et al. also found that the emission was irrelevant to the particle size, agreeing with the present study. Crystallinity may be one of the factors resulting in this difference in PL energy. Nairn et al. claimed that their CuInS2 nanoparticles, synthesized by photolysis, were more crystalline than those formed by thermolysis. Further studies and a more detailed investigation of the origins of the PL emissions from our CuInS2 QDs are planned.
The high photon energy of PL emission represents a significant advantage for using CuInS2 QDs as a high quality sensitizer in photovoltaic systems. This indicates that, prior to radiative recombination, the photogenerated electrons can stay at a high energy level without being trapped in defected states at lower energy levels. This above-edge emission may be associated with the high crystallinity of the CuInS2 QDs. The presence of defect states can result in relaxation of excited electrons to the defect states for intraband emission and minimize band gap emission and/or above-edge emission. Fig. 8 presents a schematic of the mechanism of electron transfer from the excited CuInS2 QD sensitizer to the wide band gap TiO2. The conduction band level of CuInS2 QDs is high enough for the injection of photogenerated electrons into the conduction band of TiO2,29,62,74 which serves as an electron transport medium. However, the efficiency of electron injection is influenced by the rate of electron relaxation to lower energy states. Structure disorder promotes the relaxation of electrons.74 The degree of relaxation is reflected by the PL energy. Fig. 8 shows that the PL emission for the thermolysis-derived CuInS2 QDs45,46,48,55 generally resulted from the recombination of the trapped electrons on the donor states and the trapped holes on the acceptor states (route 2). This type of charge relaxation to lower intraband states can tremendously reduce the probability of electron injection into TiO2 as a result of the shortage of overpotential for electron injection. On the other hand, the high PL emission energy (from route 1 in Fig. 8) of the present CuInS2 QDs indicates that photogenerated electrons can efficiently transfer to TiO2 due to the larger overpotential. Because of this unique charge transfer feature, the CuInS2 QDs synthesized in this study enable favorable photovoltaic applications in QDs-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.

CuInS2 QDs with high-energy PL exhibit fast electron injection from the excited CuInS2 QDs into the wide band gap TiO2 due to their larger overpotential compared to that for electrons trapped in the lower donor state. CB and VB represent the conduction band and valence band, respectively. 
For TiO2 sensitization, we initially expected the OA on the CuInS2 surface to be exchanged with the hydroxyl group (OH) on the TiO2 surface via a nucleophilic attack of the OH on the metal atoms in CuInS2. However, this exchange was not effective enough to coat a sufficient amount of CuInS2 QDs on the TiO2 surface. We subsequently used a bifunctional linker, MPA, with carboxylate and thiol functional groups to facilitate the binding of CuInS2 QDs to TiO2. The OH group on TiO2 can react with the carboxylate group of the linker molecules to build a strong linkage. After the TiO2 films were modified with MPA, they were immersed in OA-capped and MPA-capped CuInS2 QD suspensions, in which the QDs were dispersed in hexane and methanol, respectively. The MPA-coated TiO2 effectively bound CuInS2 QDs from the MPA-capped QD solution. The binding between QDs and TiO2 was weak in the OA-capped QD solution, probably due to steric hindrance for the long chain OA molecules in the mesoporous TiO2 films.

Fig. 9(a) presents the absorption spectra of CuInS2-sensitized P25 (a mixed phase of 70% anatase and 30% rutile) TiO2 films. The naked P25 TiO2 absorbed only UV light (wavelength <420 nm). After CuInS2 QD binding, the absorption spectra of the TiO2 films extended to the visible light region. Fig. 9(a) shows that the absorption intensity of the sensitized P25 film increased with the cycle number of 110 °C-QD binding. The absorbance increment became negligible after 3 cycles of QD binding due to saturation of the QDs on the TiO2 surface. Sensitization with 150 °C-QDs also reached saturation after 3 cycles of binding, but produced a smaller absorption intensity (Fig. 9(a)). The 150 °C-QDs were larger than the 110 °C-QDs, implying that steric hindrance may hinder the binding of 150 °C-QDs to the TiO2 film. Fig. 9(b) shows the absorption spectra of the sensitized ANATASE (a phase-pure anatase) TiO2 films. The absorption intensity was slightly smaller than that of the corresponding P25 films. A comparison with Fig. 3 shows that the absorption onset of the CuInS2 QDs was not affected after their binding to the TiO2. This indicates that the QDs retained their optical properties when bound to TiO2 through the MPA linker.

The CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 film with 3 cycles of QD binding was used as a photoanode in the proposed photovoltaic system for water reduction in sulfide/sulfite (S2−/SO32−) electrolyte under simulated solar light illumination (100 mW cm−2). The reactions for this water decomposition in S2−/SO32− electrolyte are reported elsewhere.75–77 The photoanodes are designated as the TiO2 type (either P25 or ANATASE) followed by the synthesis temperature (in °C) of the CuInS2 sensitizer. Fig. 10 shows the curves of the photocurrent density vs. bias potential for CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 under dark and illumination conditions, by starting at a voltage slightly negative to the illuminated open circuit voltage of the photoelectrodes. The negligible current density under dark reflects the high stability of the electrodes. Under illumination, the photocurrent density for the naked P25 TiO2 electrode was small due to the small contribution of UV light in the solar spectrum. The photo-response of the naked ANATASE film (not shown) was similar to that of the naked P25. On the other hand, the CuInS2-sensitized electrode exhibited a strong photo-response. The photocurrent increased with the positive potential bias, reaching saturation values of 1.92, 1.87, 1.33, and 1.20 mA cm−2 at ca. + 0.23 V bias for the ANATASE-150, ANATASE-110, P25-150, and P25-110 photoanodes, respectively. The ANATASE photoanode exhibited a higher photocurrent than that composed of P25, even though the former showed slightly weaker absorbance. This is because the phase-pure ANATASE film is more efficient than the anatase/rutile-containing P25 in transmitting electrons injected from a photoexcited sensitizer.78,79 As for the effect of CuInS2 QDs, the 110 °C and 150 °C-QDs exhibited similar photocurrent values. However, the 110 °C-QDs bound to TiO2 had evidently stronger absorbance than the 150 °C-QDs (Fig. 9). The 150 °C-QDs had a higher quantum yield for charge injection, probably due to a more intact crystal structure.
 Fig. 10  Photocurrent vs. bias voltage characteristics of cells assembled with the CuInS2-sensitized and the naked TiO2 photoanodes for water decomposition under illumination with AM 1.5 G at full sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The film thickness of the photoanodes was ca. 12 μm and an aqueous sulfide/sulfite (S2−/SO32−) electrolyte was used. 
An open circuit voltage of −0.52 V and short circuit photocurrent density of 1.0 mA cm−2 (at a zero bias voltage) were obtained for the ANATASE-150 electrode. This significant short circuit photocurrent indicates that this CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 electrode can effectively decompose water under no potential bias condition.
The conversion efficiency ηc, which represents the percentage of light energy converted to chemical energy at a given bias potential, is calculated by the following equation:80ηc(%) = [(energy converted to chemical reactions − energy supplied by external bias)/energy of incident light] × 100 = [Jp (ΔG°rev–Ebias)/J0] × 100where ΔG°rev is the Gibbs free energy per coulomb of electrons for water splitting, 1.23 V, Jp is the photocurrent density, and J0 is the intensity of the incident light, which is 100 mW cm−2 in this study. There is a tradeoff between the power output for water splitting and the external power supplied in converting the light energy. Fig. 11 shows the conversion efficiency of the ANATASE-150 and naked TiO2 electrodes based on the voltage dependence of the photocurrent density shown in Fig. 10. This tradeoff led to a maximum conversion efficiency of 1.9% for the CuInS2 sensitized electrode at an applied bias of ca. +0.23 V. The naked TiO2 only had a maximum of <0.2%. Note that a conversion efficiency of 1.2% was obtained for the sensitized electrode without any external bias. This indicates that due to a large overpotential (Fig. 8), the photogenerated electrons in the CuInS2 QDs synthesized from the present method can efficiently inject into TiO2 without any auxiliary potential bias for charge separation. The structural intactness of this QD material must be high, otherwise the generated electrons would relax to defected states of lower energy (Fig. 8). This advantage of solvothermally-synthesized CuInS2 QDs illustrates the applicability of this material as a sensitizer for solar cells, which are normally not applied with external bias. Research on using CuInS2 QDs as solar cell sensitizers is in progress, in an attempt to offer alternatives to the regulated II–VI-type semiconductors.

Conclusions
This study reports the synthesis of high-quality CuInS2 QDs. Under illumination, these QDs exhibited a high quantum yield for charge transfer into the TiO2 substrate of photoelectrochemical cells. The key to producing these QDs is to use a high excess of sulfur relative to Cu and In during synthesis. Under such a sulfur excess environment, burst nucleation of CuInS2 progresses at relatively low temperatures of 110–150 °C in 1 h, generating nearly monodisperse CuInS2 QDs with sizes smaller than 5 nm and narrow size distributions of 7–11%. The synthesized CuInS2 QDs exhibit a tetragonal chalcopyrite phase with a good chemical composition of Cu:In:S = 1.1:1.0:2.1. UV–vis absorption analysis shows that the optical band gap of these CuInS2 specimens is affected by the size-dependent quantum confinement effect. The main PL emission energy of these QDs is larger than their band gap energy, indicating that PL emission results from excited electrons falling from quantized discrete levels to the ground states not donor–acceptor transition. The intensity of the PL emissions from these QDs varies with the capping ligands, following the order of TOP > OA > HT ≅ MPA.
The interband PL emission feature of these QDs makes them useful as sensitizers for photovoltaic devices. The high energy levels of the excited electrons in CuInS2 facilitate an efficient charge injection into the TiO2 substrate of a photoelectrochemical cell. As a result, a CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 photoanode in water decomposition achieves a light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.9% under 100 mW cm−2 of solar illumination. More importantly, a conversion efficiency of 1.2% is achieved without any voltage bias assistance. This is primarily due to the large overpotential for charge injection from CuInS2 to TiO2. The sulfur-rich synthesis of CuInS2 QDs reported in this study is significant in terms of its applicability to photovoltaic devices. The synthesis route is facile and highly reproducible, and slight changes in the synthesis parameters can effectively tune the properties of the resulting QDs for various photovoltaic applications.
Experimental
Materials
Copper(I) chloride (CuCl, 99.995%), indium(III) chloride (InCl3, 99.999%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99+%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%), hexanethiol (HT, 95%), sodium sulfide (Na2S, 98+%), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (97+%) and oleylamine (OA, 70%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Sulfur (99.999%) was obtained from Acros (USA). TiO2 powder (P25, a mixed phase of 70% anatase and 30% rutile; average size 25 nm) from Degussa (Japan) was used to prepare TiO2 photoelectrodes. Polyethylene glycol (PEG; 20000 in molecular weight) and ethyl cellulose from Fluka (Germany) were used to suspend TiO2 particles in viscous solutions. Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3, 97+%) was supplied by Showa (Japan). Hexane (99.9%) and methanol (99.9%) were purchased from Tedia (USA), and ethanol (99.5%) was obtained from Merck (Germany). All the materials were used directly without further purification.
Synthesis of colloidal CuInS2 QDs
This section describes the proposed optimal synthesis recipe. CuCl (0.99 mg, 0.01 mmol) and InCl3 (2.2 mg, 0.01 mmol) were first dissolved in OA (0.198 mL) at room temperature. The resulting mixture was heated to 120 °C and maintained for 1 h with vigorous magnetic stirring to form a clear mixture. This mixture was added, with magnetic stirring, to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (200 mL in capacity) containing 30 mL of hexane. A sulfur solution (1 mmol dissolved in 1 mL OA) was then quickly injected into the above mixture. Solvothermal synthesis of CuInS2 QDs was conducted in a sealed autoclave for 1 h at fixed temperatures ranging from 110–170 °C. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the product precipitated with the addition of an ethanol–methanol (1/2, v/v) solution. The mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was decanted. The precipitate, i.e., the OA-capped QD product, was redispersed in hexane for characteristic analysis without any size-selective precipitation.
To obtain TOP-capped CuInS2 QDs, an excess amount of TOP was added to the OA-capped CuInS2/hexane suspension with sonication for 30 min. Hydrophobic HT-capped CuInS2 dispersed in solvent hexane was produced using a similar method, with minor modifications.68 An excess amount of HT was added to the OA-capped CuInS2/hexane suspension with sonication for 1 h, and then placed in a dark room for 1 day. In the exchange with MPA, dried OA-capped CuInS2 QDs were dispersed in a methanol solution of MPA (60 mM) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (70 mM), and the mixture was then sonicated for 30 min to obtain a clear dispersion containing MPA-capped CuInS2 QDs.32 The MPA-capped QDs precipitated with an ethyl acetate–hexane (12/50, v/v) solution and were redispersed in methanol.
Preparation of QD-sensitized TiO2 electrodes
Two types of TiO2 nanoparticles, P25 and ANATASE (a phase-pure anatase), were employed to construct transparent TiO2 photoelectrodes. ANATASE TiO2 powder was obtained by treating P25 powder with concentrated NaOH in an autoclave at 130 °C and subsequently treating the resulting titanate product in HNO3 (pH = 1.5) in an autoclave at 240 °C.81 To form a viscous P25 suspension, P25 was mixed with ethyl cellulose at an ethyl cellulose/TiO2 ratio of 0.5.82 The ANATASE suspension used PEG as the dispersing agent at a PEG/TiO2 ratio of 0.4. The suspensions were then spread on a conducting glass substrate (SnO2:F coated glass; Hartford Glass TEC8, USA) with an active area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. The TiO2-coated substrates were subsequently calcined at 450 °C in air for 30 min to form a nanocrystalline TiO2 film 12 μm thick. These TiO2 films were used as the substrate for QD sensitization.
MPA, with a carboxylic acid functional group, was chosen as a linker to facilitate the self-assembly of CuInS2 QDs on the TiO2 substrate. To attach the linker molecules to the TiO2 surface, the TiO2 electrodes were heated to ∼110 °C and then immersed in an acetonitrile solution of MPA (1 M) and sulfuric acid (0.1 M) for 12 h.83 The MPA-coated TiO2 films were subsequently immersed in the MPA-capped QD/methanol solution for 24 h to entrap the QD sensitizer. The QD entrapping process was conducted several times to optimize the photovoltaic performance of the electrodes.
Measurements
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Hitachi H-7500, Japan) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM; Jeol 2100F, Japan) were used to explore the microstructure of the QDs. The samples for TEM and HRTEM analysis were prepared by placing a drop of a QD/hexane solution on a carbon film-coated grid. The crystal structure of the samples was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku RINT-2000 (Japan) diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation, excited at 40 kV and 40 mA. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the QD samples was performed using a Jeol JSM-6700F (Japan) scanning electron microscopy.
The resulting colloidal QD solutions were placed in a 1 cm quartz cuvette for optical analysis. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 (Japan) spectrophotometer, while photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Hitachi F-7000 (Japan). The PL quantum yields were determined by comparing the integrated emissions of the specimen to that of rhodamine B in an ethanol solution with an excitation wavelength of 510 nm. All solutions were diluted to an absorbance ca. 0.1 at this wavelength. Photoelectrochemical reactions of the sensitized TiO2 electrodes were carried out in a two-armed cell equipped with a quartz window, using a platinum sheet as the counter electrode. An aqueous solution of Na2S (0.24 M) and Na2SO3 (0.35 M) served as the electrolyte to maintain the stability of the CuInS2 QDs. Photocurrent–potential characteristics were recorded under illumination with a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel class A, SP91160A, USA) at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) using an electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments 614B, USA). All the measurements were conducted under ambient conditions.

 	Fig. 5  A comparison of the size-dependent band gaps of CuInS2 QDs determined by absorption experiments (Fig. 3) and calculations using eqn (1).	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) PL spectra of the OA-capped CuInS2 QDs grown at different temperatures for 1 h. (b) A comparison of the PL intensities of the 170 °C CuInS2 QDs capped with different ligands.	 

 	Fig. 7  Band edge positions of bulk CuInS2 depicted on the scale with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode reference (NHE).62,74 Hole trapping can occur on CuInS2via a surface-capping thiol, which has a standard redox potential higher than the valence band edge of CuInS2 and quenches the CuInS2 luminescence.	 

 	Fig. 8  High-energy PL emission as a result excited electrons falling from a quantized level to the ground state (route 1) and low-energy emission from intraband donor–acceptor transition (route 2). CuInS2 QDs with high-energy PL exhibit fast electron injection from the excited CuInS2 QDs into the wide band gap TiO2 due to their larger overpotential compared to that for electrons trapped in the lower donor state. CB and VB represent the conduction band and valence band, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 9  UV–vis absorption of CuInS2 QDs-sensitized TiO2 films with varying cycle numbers for QD-coating: (a) P25 TiO2 and (b) ANATASE TiO2. The number in parentheses behind the QD type represents the cycle number for QD coating.	 

 	Fig. 10  Photocurrent vs. bias voltage characteristics of cells assembled with the CuInS2-sensitized and the naked TiO2 photoanodes for water decomposition under illumination with AM 1.5 G at full sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The film thickness of the photoanodes was ca. 12 μm and an aqueous sulfide/sulfite (S2−/SO32−) electrolyte was used.	 
ηc(%) = [(energy converted to chemical reactions − energy supplied by external bias)/energy of incident light] × 100 = [Jp (ΔG°rev–Ebias)/J0] × 100

 	Fig. 11  Light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of the ANATASE-150 and the naked TiO2 photoanodes obtained at varying voltage biases under illumination with AM 1.5G at full sun intensity (100 mW cm−2).
