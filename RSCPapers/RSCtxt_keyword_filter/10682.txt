ZnO NW arrays are grown on indium tin oxide substrates using chemical bath deposition. The Ag2S NPs are sequentially formed on the ZnO NWs through sonochemical synthesis. Structural characterizations indicate the slight deconstruction of surface of ZnO NWs during Ag2S NPs formation. By employing polysulfide electrolyte, short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage and therefore the efficiency of the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell are improved with increasing the initial sulfur concentration in the sulfur–polysulfide electrolyte. The Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell shows a conversion efficiency of 0.49% with a superior Jsc of ∼13.7 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Incident photon conversion efficiency measurements reveal that Ag2S NPs contribute to 33.4% and 65.2% of Jsc in the wavelength ranges of 400–700 nm and 700–1300 nm, respectively.
Introduction
Most dyes employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), such as Ru complex dyes1 and indoline dyes,2 are designed to have high extinction coefficients in the visible range but are limited to small or negligible absorption in the infrared part. As a result, sunlight distributed in the infrared range, which is more than 50% of the whole solar spectrum, is not be efficiently harvested in conventional dye-sensitized photoelectrodes. Therefore, one of the current challenges of DSSCs is achieving effective extension of light harvesting toward the near-infrared (NIR) part of the solar spectrum to increase the photocurrent.3
Semiconductor materials (e.g.CdSe, PbS, InP) with quantum-dot (QD) features which possess tunable optical band gaps by modulating their sizes and compositions are considered to be alternative sensitizers for sensitized solar cells (SSC).4 On the other hand, compared to conventional TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) DSSCs, superior electron transport properties have been demonstrated in nanowire (NW) DSSCs by using the well-aligned and single-crystalline ZnO NW array electrode.5 Although its insufficient surface area for dye adsorption has been addressed,5ZnO NW-based electrodes still attract substantial consideration for DSSC applications due to their low crystallization temperature in addition to superior electron transport and collection properties.6,7 Inorganic sensitizers can be formed on TiO2 NP films or ZnO NW arrays by in situpreparation methods including chemical bath deposition (CBD)8,9 and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction.10Ex situ prepared QD sensitizers can be incorporated onto the electrodes by linkers as well.8
Due to its bulk band gap of ∼1 eV and relatively high absorption coefficients,11 monoclinic acanthite, α-Ag2S, has been applied in photoconductors12 and photovoltaic cells.13 Moreover, α-Ag2S possesses negligible toxicity compared to other commonly used narrow band gap materials,14 making it a promising material for solar energy applications. In order to demonstrate the NIR light-harvesting capability of Ag2S, in the present work, Ag2S NPs, instead of Ag2S QDs,13 sonochemically grown on ZnO NW arrays are employed to be the photoanodes of SSCs. By employing polysulfide electrolyte, the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell shows a conversion efficiency of 0.49% with a superior short-circuit current density (Jsc) of ∼13.7 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement reveals that 65% Jsc is converted from the photons harvested in the infrared range.
Experimental
Formation of the aligned ZnO NW arrays on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates has been described in detail elsewhere.15–17 In brief, a seed layer was first formed on the ITO substrate by the dip-coating method using a 0.05 M aqueous solution of zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, ZnAc·2H2O) and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4, HMTA) at room-temperature followed by a calcination at 350 °C. Aligned ZnO NW arrays were then grown on the seeded ITO substrates by CBD in a 0.02M aqueous solution of zinc acetate and HMTA at 95 °C for 3 h. The NW arrays were annealed at 400 °C for 30 min. Sonochemical synthesis of silver sulfide NPs was subsequently conducted on the ZnO NW array/ITO substrate in the aqueous solution of 0.033 M thiourea and 1 mM AgNO3 with ultrasound irradiation (22.5 KHz) at 65 °C for 30 min. The morphologies of the deposited materials were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7000F). Compositional analysis of the silver sulfide NPs was performed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attached on SEM. Optical properties of the silver sulfide NPs/ZnO NW arrays were measured using UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO V-670). The crystal structures were investigated using XRD (Rigaku D/MAX-2000 and Rigaku D/MAX- 2500) and TEM (JOEL 2100F and FEI E.O Tecnai F20 G2 MAT S-TWIN).
For fabricating Ag2S NPs-sensitized ZnO NW solar cells, the Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW array/ITO electrode and platinized ITO counter electrodes were sandwiched together with 25-μm-thick hot-melt spacers. The liquid electrolyte solution was introduced between the photoelectrode and counter electrodes by capillary action. A polysulfide electrolyte solution composed of 0.5 M Na2S, 2.5 M S and 0.1 M KCl in a 9:1 volume ratio of methanol and water was employed for the Ag2S-sensitized ZnO NW solar cells. Photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400 SourceMeter) under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 (300 W, Model 91160A, Oriel). The exposed area was 0.07 cm2 for all cells. IPCE was measured using 500 W xenon light source (Oriel) and a monochromater (Oriel Cornerstone) equipped with Si (Model 71640, Oriel) and Ge (Model 71643, Oriel) detectors for the wavelength ranges of 185–1100 nm and 700–1800 nm, respectively.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the SEM image of aligned ZnO NWs grown on the ITO substrate by CBD. The diameters of the NWs are in the range of 30–100 nm and the lengths of the NWs are ∼3 μm. Formation of the silver sulfide NPs on the ZnO NWs are subsequently carried out in aqueous solution of thiourea and AgNO3 at 65 °C for 30 min using sonochemical synthesis. Without ultrasound irradiation, very tiny NPs were formed on the surface of the NWs at 65 °C (Fig. S1, Supplementary Information†). EDS analysis reveals that the NPs are composed of Ag and S with an Ag/S ratio of ∼1.35 (Fig. S2(a), Supplementary Information†). However, the formation of NPs on NWs is significantly enhanced when ultrasound irradiation is applied. Fig. 1(b)–(d) illustrated the SEM images of NW arrays after the sonochemical process with various ultrasound irradiation powers. For simplicity, the NPs formed on ZnO NW arrays after the sonochemical process for 30 min with ultrasound irradiation powers of 0, 4, 8, 12 W are named as 0W-30, 4W-30, 8W-30 and 12W-30, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(b)–(d), the diameter of the NPs increase with increasing ultrasound irradiation power from 4 W to 12 W. The NPs with diameters in the range of 35–60 nm and 70–95 nm are obtained in the 4W-30 and 12W-30 arrays, respectively. EDS analysis reveals that the NPs formed via the sonochemical method possess an Ag/S ratio of ∼2 (Fig. S2(b), Supplementary Information†). For comparison, sonochemical synthesis of Ag2S NPs is also performed on a ZnO film by an ultrasound irradiation power of 12 W for 30 min (Fig. S3, Supplementary Information†).

The absorption spectra of the as-prepared ZnO NW array, Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW arrays and Ag2S NPs/ZnO film on ITO substrates are shown in Fig. 2. In comparison with the as-prepared ZnO NW array, significant enhancement of the absorption in the visible-NIR range of 400–1300 nm is achieved via the sonochemical formation of Ag2S NPs on its surface. The absorption edges of the sonochemical Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW arrays are at ∼1250 nm which is comparable to that of the bulk Ag2S. Moreover, the absorption intensity of Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW arrays is enhanced with increasing ultrasound irradiation power as a result of the enrichment of the diameter and density of the Ag2S NPs. On the other hand, the visible-NIR absorptions of the 0W-30 array and Ag2S NPs/ZnO film are inferior to those of the sonochemical Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW arrays, which are ascribed to the inappropriate stoichiometry and lesser amount of Ag2S NPs, respectively.

Structural characterizations of the Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW arrays on ITO substrates were performed using XRD. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of 12W-30, 8W-30, 4W-30 and ZnO NW array on ITO substrates as well as bare ITO substrate. In addition to the diffraction peaks pertaining to the ITO substrate and the ZnO NWs, the other peaks in the XRD patterns can be indexed as the monoclinic acanthite according to ICDD-PDF No. 00-014-0072, indicating the formation of crystalline Ag2S NPs on ZnO NWs via the sonochemical process. It should be noted that the intensity of the diffraction peaks in Fig. 4 are all normalized to that of diffraction peak of ITO at 2θ = 44.45°. The intensity ratios of Ag2S(111)/ITO(2θ = 44.45°) in the XRD patterns of the Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW arrays formed by various irradiation powers are listed in Table 1. Moreover, the intensity ratios (f) of the XRD diffraction peak of ZnO(103) after and before the formation of Ag2S NPs are also summarized in Table 1. It reveals that the peak intensity of Ag2S (111) increases with increasing ultrasound irradiation power from 4 W to 12 W. The results show that the formation rate of Ag2S on the ZnO NWs can be enhanced by enlarging the ultrasound irradiation power. On the other hand, we found that the intensities of ZnO diffraction peaks decrease after the formation of Ag2S NPs. It suggests that ZnO NWs are slightly destroyed during Ag2S formation.

A typical TEM image of the NPs/ZnO NW scratched from the 12W-30 sample is shown in Fig. 4(a), which reveals the formation of NPs on the NW. Fig. 4(b) shows a HRTEM image and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the NW portion in Fig. 4(a). They reveal that the NW possesses a single-crystal structure and the growth direction is along [0001]. In comparison with the as-prepared ZnO NW,15–17 the TEM characterizations indicate that the ZnO NW sustains the single-crystalline structure but exhibits a rougher surface after the sonochemical synthesis of the NPs on it. It confirms the XRD result that the ZnO NWs are slightly destroyed after Ag2S formation. The HRTEM image and the corresponding SAED pattern of the NP denoted in Fig. 4(a) are shown in Fig. 4(c). They indicate the formation of crystalline Ag2S NP on the ZnO NW using the sonochemical process, which is consistent with the XRD results.
Formation of H˙ and OH˙ radicals by the sonolysis of water has been well studied.18 The sonochemically generated H˙ radicals are considered to act as reductants which can prompt the reduction reactions occurring in the aqueous solution.18 It has been proposed that the H˙ radicals promote the decomposition of thiourea to form S2− in the solution.19 The produced S2− ions will react with Ag+ to form Ag2S clusters in the ultrasonic solution. In the present work, the NPs with an Ag/S ratio of ∼1.5 are produced without ultrasonic irradiation whereas stoichiometric Ag2S NPs are obtained in the ultrasonic solution. It indicates that the sonochemical process facilitates the formation of stoichiometric Ag2S NPs. Sonication of the precursors in the presence of support materials provides a means of trapping the produced NPs.19 With the existence of the ZnO NW array in the solution, the generated Ag2S clusters would be consequently attached on the surface of ZnO NWs under the ultrasonic irradiation. However, we found that under the same sonochemical process, Ag2S NPs are absent on surfaces of the oxide materials other than ZnO, such as TiO2 and ITO, etc. In addition, the XRD and TEM results indicate the slight deconstruction of ZnO NWs during Ag2S NPs formation. Accordingly, other mechanisms are proposed for the formation of Ag2S NPs on ZnO NWs in the present work. It has been reported that aqueous treatment will result in the dissolution of ZnO and facilitates the formation of precipitates on the ZnO surface.20 The pH of the aqueous solution of thiourea and AgNO3 for Ag2S growth is ∼6.5. ZnO NWs dissolution will occur in the acidic solution, which may result in the preferential formation of Ag2S NPs on the surface of ZnO NWs. On the other hand, conversion of ZnO to ZnS has been demonstrated by ultrasonic-assisted substitution reaction.21In situ generated S2− ions in the ultrasonic bath can be adsorbed on the ZnO NW surface to provide initial nucleation sites for the surface formation of ZnS on the ZnO NW. The deconstruction of ZnO NWs from the surface may take place during the formation of ZnS. Moreover, the conversions of ZnS to other metal sulfides with relatively lower solubility product constants by ion exchange processes have also been investigated.22 The solubility product constant of Ag2S is significantly lower than that of ZnS,22 which facilitates the conversion of ZnS to Ag2S. We suggest that the Ag2S NPs are subsequently formed on the ZnO NWs in the ultrasonic solution in the presence of AgNO3.

Fig. 5(a) shows the photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cells with polysulfide electrolyte under the AM-1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. For comparison, the J–V curve of Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO film solar cell is illustrated in Fig. 5(a) as well. The photovoltaic properties of these cells are listed in Table 2. It shows that the Jsc of Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cells are significantly enhanced compared to that of the Ag2S-NP sensitized ZnO film solar cell, which is ascribed to the much higher surface area of the ZnO NW anode for Ag2S formation. Higher efficiencies (η) of the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cells are therefore obtained. Moreover, the Jsc of the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cells are increased with increasing the ultrasound irradiation power for Ag2S NP formation due to the enrichments of the Ag2S NPs on the ZnO NWs for light harvesting. An efficiency of 0.49% with a superior Jsc of 13.7 mA cm−2 is obtained in the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell which is fabricated using the 12W-30 photoanode. Compared to the Ru dye (N719)-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell (Fig. S4, Supplementary Information†), the Jsc is significantly enhanced in the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell. The efficiency of the Ag2S NP-sensitized cell is therefore larger than that of the N719-sensitized one, although the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the Ag2S NP-sensitized cell is rather low.

The effect of initial sulfur concentration ([S]) in the sulfur–polysulfide electrolyte on the performance of Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cells is investigated in the present work as well. Fig. 5(b) illustrates the J–V curves of the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell with various [S] and volume ratios of MeOH/H2O in the sulfur–polysulfide electrolyte. The photovoltaic properties of these cells are listed in Table 3. Jsc, Voc and therefore η of the Ag2S NP- sensitized ZnO NW solar cell are improved with increasing the initial sulfur concentration in the sulfur–polysulfide electrolyte. The maximum Voc in the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell is associated with the potential difference between the conduction band edge of ZnO and the redox potential of the sulfur–polysulfide electrolyte. The increase of Voc is consistent with the observed negative change of the redox potential of the sulfur–polysulfide electrolyte when increasing the initial sulfur concentration.23 However, a rather low Voc which limits the overall efficiency is obtained in the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell even though the initial sulfur concentration is already as high as 2.5 M.

The IPCE spectrum of the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell with the 12W-30 photoanode is shown in Fig. 6. The absorption spectrum of 12W-30 shown in Fig. 2 is replotted in Fig. 6 for comparison. The features of the IPCE spectrum is rather compatible with that of the absorption spectrum in the wavelengths ranging from 550 to 1250 nm. By integrating the IPCE data with the AM1.5G spectrum,24 we found that Ag2S NPs contribute to 33.4% and 65.2% of Jsc in the wavelength ranges of 400–700 nm and 700–1300 nm, respectively. Another 1.4% Jsc converted from the photons in the range of 300–400 nm mainly pertains to the UV absorption of ZnO NW array. Compared to the reported CdS QD-,25CdSe QD-26 and ZnS coated Ag2S QD-sensitized photoanodes10 with absorption wavelength ranging from 400 to 550 nm, to 550 nm and to 1100 nm, respectively, the Ag2S NP/ZnO NW array demonstrated in the present work has a wider absorptive wavelength range. The result indicates that the Ag2S NP/ZnO NW array is a promising phototanode harvesting sunlight from visible to NIR range.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated a promising photoanode of Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW arrays on a ITO substrate, which capably harvests sunlight from the visible to NIR range. ZnO NW arrays are grown on ITO substrates using CBD. The Ag2S NPs are sequentially formed on the ZnO NWs through sonochemical synthesis. Structural characterizations indicate that the ZnO NW sustains the single-crystalline structure but is slightly deconstructed during Ag2S NPs formation. Pronounced absorption in the visible-NIR range of 400–1300 nm is demonstrated in the Ag2S NPs/ZnO NW array. By employing polysulfide electrolyte, Jsc, Voc and therefore η of the Ag2S NP- sensitized ZnO NW solar cell are improved with increasing initial sulfur concentration in the sulfur–polysulfide electrolyte. The Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell shows a conversion efficiency of 0.49% with a superior Jsc of ∼13.7 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. However, a rather low Voc which limits the overall efficiency is obtained in the Ag2S NP-sensitized ZnO NW solar cell. IPCE measurements reveal that Ag2S NPs contribute to 33.4% and 65.2% of Jsc in the wavelength ranges of 400–700 nm and 700–1300 nm, respectively.
