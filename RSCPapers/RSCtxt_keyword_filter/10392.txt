    , Accepted 20th October 2013First published on 22nd October 2013AbstractVarious rutile TiO2 nanostructures were grown using a wet chemical deposition method within plastic, glass, stainless-steel, copper, silver, etc., containers and their application in DSSCs was envisaged for the first time. The reaction rate is different in different containers. The effect of container environment on the morphology and optical properties of rutile TiO2 was investigated and can be attributed to the presence of the respective container element in TiO2. The metals (copper, silver, iron, sodium, etc.) are confirmed (in wt%) in the final products. Due to a change in the morphology followed by absorbance, the power conversion and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies are different (higher in the copper container at 1.97% and 16%, and lower in the stainless-steel container at 0.26% and 3%, respectively). This change in performance can be attributed to a difference in the electron life time values, which are consistent with the charge transfer and series resistance values obtained from Nyquist plots.
1. Introduction
Solar energy, wherein sunlight is converted into electric power, is one of the most promising future energy resources and has several advantages over most currently used electrical power generation methods. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention as a potential alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells with the benefits of low manufacturing cost and high theoretical efficiency.1 DSSCs consist of a layer of dye-adsorbed porous TiO2 nanoparticles on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as a working electrode, a platinum (Pt) thin film counter electrode and an electrolyte, normally containing a I−/I3− redox couple,2 as an ion transport medium.
Recently, Grätzel et al. increase the record energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs to 15% under simulated air mass 1.5 global sunlight, bringing them closer to production.3 Kim et al., and Chen et al., synthesized nanoporous TiO2 spheres using a hydrothermal method.4 This spherical TiO2 has provided a novel hierarchical pore structure with a high surface area and large pore diameter resulting in a fairly good scattering effect. Many researchers have adopted low temperature synthesis methodologies such as hydrothermal or supercritical drying methods for the preparation of rutile TiO2 nanoparticles. Recently, several morphologies of rutile TiO2 have been developed including single-crystal nanowires, nanotubes, nanospheres, nanorods, nanoribbons, nanosheets, nanocorals and nanoflowers, etc.5 Due to the acidic nature of the available titanium salts, only a few reports are available on the direct synthesis of TiO2 nanostructures using a simple and cost-effective wet chemical methods.6 However, we have found no reports, wherein the same method has been applied to the synthesis in different container environments, followed by application of the TiO2 nanostructures in DSSCs. The charge recombination processes at the interfaces between the FTO electrode, TiO2 and the dyes are important for enhancing the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency.7 In conventionally constructed DSSCs, the charge recombination predominantly takes place at two possible interfaces; TiO2/dye/electrolyte and transparent conduct oxide (TCO)/electrolyte. Power generation in DSSCs is based on the photoexcitation of dye molecules and this injects photoelectrons into the conduction band of TiO2, which leads the electrons toward the external circuit.6 As a continuation of our recent work, wherein, a low temperature wet chemical method for the synthesis of rutile TiO2 was proposed,6,8 in the present work efforts have been made to confirm the morphological changes of TiO2 (if any) that occur in the presence of various deposition containers including plastic, glass, stainless-steel, copper, silver etc. It has been found that the rate of reaction is dependent on the container environment. The change in optical density because of the container environment, without and with N719 dye is also monitored. Current density–applied voltage (J–V) and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements are obtained. Charge transfer and series resistance values, obtained from Nyquist plots, are used to provide a plausible explanation for the change in J–V performance.
2. Experimental details
All chemicals used for synthesizing the TiO2 nanostructures were of analytical grade purchased from Merck and utilized without any further purification. A solution of TiCl4 was firstly diluted to a 1 M solution in 20% HCl by adding the calculated amount of standard HCl (37%), triply-distilled water and TiCl4 solution together in a beaker of 100 ml capacity. This mixture was then kept at 373 K for 30 min. At the beginning, the yellow solution turned colorless. This solution was used as a stock solution in further work. The FTO substrates, purchased from Samsung electronics and used on account of their high transparency, thermal and chemical stabilities at high temperatures, were washed with acetone in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for 30 min. In a typical process, 0.1 M thiourea was added into 50 ml of TiCl4 solution. A transparent solution with a reddish-yellow color was obtained after vigorous stirring for 30 min at room temperature. 25 ml of the resulting solution was poured into the above mentioned containers, namely, stainless-steel, glass, plastic, silver and copper containers and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 h at 328 K. Whitish Ti(OH)2 films were seen, which was removed, washed with distilled water, dried and annealed at 573 K for 1 h before final use. In addition, in order to understand the importance of the individual container metals on the growth kinetics of the TiO2 reaction, we grew TiO2 not only in a plastic container, but also in the presence of different precursors such as iron chloride, silver chloride, copper chloride, etc. Structural elucidation was carried out using X-ray diffraction spectra obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å). Morphological and optical studies were conducted using the images and spectra obtained with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4200) and UV-Vis spectrometry (Cary100 UV-Visible spectrophotometer) instruments. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis, linked to the FE-SEM unit, was used to determine the impact of the container on the product composition. All of the TiO2 nanostructured electrodes were loaded with N719 dye for 12 h and used for optical and electrochemical measurements. The electrodes exhibit different optical behaviors when loaded with N719 dye even though all were dipped for the same time, indicating that the container environment had a considerable impact on the TiO2 growth process. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded with an impedance analyzer (CompactStat.e, Ivium Technologies) in a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 1.5 MHz with 50 mV amplitude. The EIS measurements were carried out at open circuit potentials under 1 Sun AM 1.5 G light illumination. Impedance parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using Z-view software. A three electrode system was used to measure EIS, i.e., a TiO2 anode as the working electrode, a Pt cathode as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode.9 The total impedance comprises the sum of the impedances from each of the elements in the solar cell. There are contributions from the working electrode, the counter electrode and the transport material between the electrodes.10 The solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of the devices was measured by incorporating an individual cell with an active area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2, which was sealed using a spacer film (a 50 μm thick polyester film), with Iodolyte AN-50 electrolyte (Solaronix). A Pt-coated FTO electrode was used as the counter electrode, which was prepared using a drop casting method. Cell performance was measured by irradiation with 100 mW cm−2 white light (1 Sun) from a solar simulator in the presence of a water filter (450 W xenon lamp, Oriel Instruments). J–V spectra were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Studies on the morphology and structure
FE-SEM images of the TiO2 nanostructures grown from the copper (A), silver (B), plastic (C), glass (D) and, stainless-steel (E) containers are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Top-view FE-SEM images of the TiO2 nanostructures prepared in: (A) copper, (B) silver, (C) plastic, (D) glass and (E) stainless-steel containers, as well as the (F) XRD spectra of electrodes A–E. 
From the FE-SEM surface images it can be noted that, while all of the TiO2 samples were prepared using the same synthesis method under the same experimental conditions, the surface morphology was not identical, indicating the significance of the environmental conditions on the growth process of TiO2. The FE-SEM images show that the TiO2 nanostructures grown in the silver and stainless-steel containers have nearly of the same crystallite size. The crystallites prepared in the silver container were comparatively smaller in sizes than those obtained from the stainless-steel container. In latter case, a flower-like architecture was more dominant than in former case. The tilted nanocrystallites were connected to each other at their roots and then grew further vertically. A few of the crystallites were an elongated-type and separate from one another. The nanostructure obtained from the plastic container looked like a nanorice-type structure; flattened at the center and narrowed at the ends, which was entirely different to the previous two morphologies (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the TiO2 nanostructure obtained from the copper container was composed of fine regular vertical granules (as shown in Fig. 1A) with large surface area. Finally, surface of the TiO2 sample obtained from the glass container once again exhibit a nanorice-type structure. The different forms of TiO2 obtained from the silver, copper and stainless-steel containers had smaller dimensions than those obtained from the plastic and glass containers. This could be due to the involvement of the respective container material in the TiO2 growth process. The XRD spectra of TiO2 nanostructures A–E, synthesized under different environmental conditions are shown in Fig. 1F. There was no substantial shift in the diffraction peaks. No peaks belonging to any other phases such as brookite or anatase were detected, indicating that all of the electrodes exhibited high purity and a single phase i.e., rutile. The spectra obtained had the characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to the (111), (200), (012), (220), (241), (052), (400) and (431) planes of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS data file No. 16-0617) indicating that the container environment had no impact on the TiO2 crystal structure.
It was noted that the performance of the TiO2 electrode with N719 dye in the plastic container was superior with copper doping compared to silver doping, while silver doping was inferior to the pristine TiO2 electrode (see Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI† for further details). Surprisingly, there was no substantial change in surface architecture of TiO2, indicating that the intentionally doped metal salts have an influence on DSSC performance, but not like when a container was used. This could be due to a change of TiO2 morphology.6Fig. 2(d–f) show EDX spectra of the TiO2 electrodes obtained from the plastic containers with the same proportion (wt%) of copper, silver and iron salts deposited in each container. The spectra clearly confirm the presence of the elements, copper, silver and iron. The atomic and weight percentages are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†).

Fig. 3(a–e) shows EDX spectra of various elements in the TiO2 nanostructures obtained from the different deposition containers. As discussed earlier, these were used to detect the addition of container elements (if any) into the final product i.e., TiO2. At the outset, an analysis for titanium and oxygen was conducted, which scanned a selected area of all the TiO2 nanostructures. Both Ti and O elements were observed. The elements detected (in wt%) in the TiO2 samples obtained from a particular area are depicted in Table S2 (ESI†). In addition to Ti and O, other elements belonging to the container were also observed, indicating that the container material was actively involved in the oxidation process of TiCl4. This might be one of the reasons for the change in the TiO2 morphology.

3.2. Optical density analysis
The variation in optical density of the TiO2 electrodes with and without N719 dye loading are shown in Fig. 4(a and b). The TiO2 electrodes exhibit different photon absorption activities because the optical density was different for each electrode, even though all of them were synthesized under the same conditions using the same method. The optical density of the TiO2 electrode synthesized using the stainless-steel container was the lowest when compared to the other containers. This could be due to fact that the stainless-steel might have remained inactive during the TiO2 oxidation process. On the other hand, the TiO2 electrodes prepared from the copper, iron and silver containers exhibited relatively high densities (nearly same for all) compared to the stainless-steel container, indicating that the TiO2 electrode synthesized from the stainless-steel container had different reaction kinetics to the others. After N719 dye loading, the optical density of the TiO2 electrode synthesized from the stainless-steel container was not significantly changed. This could be due to a relatively more compact morphology of TiO2. An increasing trend of absorption density was observed for the TiO2 with N719 dye electrodes from glass to plastic, then silver to copper, which could be attributed to the existence of different morphologies of TiO2 obtained from different containers. The calculated amounts of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 electrodes synthesized from different containers were not the same, but increased from 4.85 × 10¬7 mol g−1 to 5.17 × 10¬7 mol g−1. The amount of dye in the TiO2 electrodes synthesized from the silver and copper containers were relatively high compared to the others, which supports the fact that all of the electrodes did not adsorb the same amount of dye, even though all of them were prepared using the same method and under similar experimental conditions.

3.3. Electrochemical measurements
The J–V and IPCE measurements of the N719 dye-loaded TiO2 electrodes are given in Fig. 5a and b. Variation in the DSCC measurements of the TiO2 electrodes signifies the importance of the deposition container environment. Despite having the same structure, the J–V and IPCE spectra are entirely different from one another.

The structural disorder of the TiO2 electrodes obtained from the copper, stainless-steel, glass, plastic and silver containers might have resulted in stacking faults, which could delay electron transportation due to the presence of several recombination centers which in fact, demonstrate relatively inferior performance. Electronic parameters estimated from these curves are tabulated in Table 1.

DSSC performance was best for the TiO2 electrode labelled A and worst for electrode E, suggesting that the copper container was not only involved in the reaction, but was also supporting the formation of a favorable structure for application in DSSCs, which was not the case for the TiO2 synthesized from the stainless-steel container. Consequently, the short circuit current density and open circuit voltage values for A to E were decreased from 5.15 mA cm−2 to 1.45 mA cm−2 and 0.66 to 0.46 V respectively. The fill factor (a function of the electrode resistance) and power conversion efficiency (the ratio of the output power to the input power × 100%) were increased from 39% to 57% and 0.26% to 1.97%, respectively. The presence of guest metal atoms in the TiO2 host not only altered the electrode morphology, but also boosted the electrochemical parameters favorably. Analogous to the J–V measurements, there was a change in the IPCE values for TiO2 electrodes A–E (as per Fig. 1f).

Fig. 5(b) shows the IPCE spectra for TiO2 electrodes A–E (as per Fig. 1(F)), wherein the IPCE value was increased from 3 to 16% as a result of the altered electrode morphology and increased amount of dye adsorbed. The IPCE spectra show a maximum efficiency in the visible region at a wavelength of ∼550 nm. Consistent with the J–V results, the IPCE value of the TiO2 electrode synthesized from the copper container was the highest, whereas that synthesized from the stainless-steel was the lowest.
3.4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electron life time measurements
The Nyquist spectra in Fig. 6a show an increasing charge transfer resistance trend from TiO2 electrode A to E, suggesting that the DSSCs performance would not be ideally the same for all of the electrodes. The spectra were fitted to an equivalent circuit (Fig. S2, ESI†) in order to obtain various electronic parameters. The charge transfer resistance of the TiO2/Pt interface (R1) for the electrode obtained from the stainless-steel container was higher compared to that of the electrodes synthesized from the remaining containers, which leads to a decay in the charge transfer rate.9 The area under the second semicircle, the resistance due to TiO2/N719 dye/electrolyte interfaces (R2) was increased from electrodes A to E from 25.78 to 101.10 Ω cm2.
 Fig. 6  (a) Nyquist plots, and (b) open-circuit voltage decay (with inset as electron life-time spectra) measurements of TiO2 electrodes. 
For the TiO2 electrode synthesized from the copper container, the resistance across the electrolyte/Pt interface (R1), represented by a first semicircle, and the R2 value were higher than those of the others. The areas under both semicircles are influenced by the nature of the porous electrode/electrolyte interface and counter electrode/electrolyte. The abbreviation, CPE, is the constant phase element of the capacitance, which represents a non-ideal frequency dependent capacitance due to the non-uniform distribution of current due to the heterogeneity of the material. Basically, DSSCs are complex systems that may involve a variety of reactions at several interfaces. The measured spectra show large area semicircles at lower frequencies and small area semicircles at higher frequencies. The electron lifetime was calculated via open-circuit voltage decay measurements taken during light OFF conditions. Fig. 6(b) shows the open-circuit voltage decay curves of TiO2 electrodes A–E with N719 dye. The voltage decay curves were different from one another indicating that all of the electrodes would have not the same electron life time (τ).11 Electron life times were 0.4840 ms, 0.3168 ms, 0.2048 ms, 0.1893 ms and 0.0549 ms for TiO2 electrodes A to E (refer to Fig. 1F), respectively. This is consistent with the J–V data (see above), again the longest electron life time was confirmed for the TiO2 electrode synthesized from the copper container, while the shortest was for the electrode prepared from the glass container, indicating the importance of the container environment on TiO2 formation and subsequent DSSCs performance. The electron with a possibility of recombination would be more in case of stainless-steel container as electron time value was least.
4. Conclusions
In summary, rutile TiO2 electrodes with different nanostructures were synthesized onto FTO substrates in plastic, glass, stainless-steel, copper and silver containers using a simple, eco-friendly and inexpensive wet chemical method and their further application in DSSCs was investigated. The effect of the deposition container environment on the morphology and the structure of TiO2 was also investigated. The rutile phase confirmed using X-ray diffraction was remained unchanged with container environment. Spherical, flower and rice-like architectures of TiO2 with different optical densities were obtained from the different containers. The optical density was increased after N719 dye loading for all of the TiO2 electrodes. The presence of the respective container metals was detected in the final products. Due to its long electron life time (0.484 ms), the TiO2 electrode synthesized from the copper container demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 1.97%, which was higher than those prepared from other containers, indicating that the container environment is critically important, in addition to the synthesis method and the morphology of TiO2. We also noticed that the intentional doping of metal salts increased DSSC performance, although an in-depth study is still required, which is under way.
