    , Accepted 25th May 2022First published on 26th May 2022AbstractThe evolution of energy storage technology that can deliver high energy density with excellent rate performance is desirable all over the world. The scientific community is putting their efforts together to solve this issue and one of the best ways is to use battery technology. The studies are not only about the battery technology, the cathode materials that reveal these properties have also been getting great attention. Polyanionic compound-based electrodes offer a new perspective for improving and achieving higher capacity and energy/power density, safety, and long-life cycle stability of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). However, in recent years, phosphate-based cathode compounds for NIBs have attracted great interest because of their improved structural diversity, stability, high ionic mobility, and better safety. This review article analyzes the recent advancements in the crystal structures of different explored Na-based phosphate compounds, their ion diffusion mechanisms, and the study of multi-electron reactions. The types of NASICONs Na-based phosphate compounds, which include orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, phosphates, and mixed phosphates, are also discussed with their drawbacks and benefits. The low electronic conductivity and moderately low-capacity performance of this class of materials are the major drawbacks to their advancement and application in NIBs. This review provides insight into the strategies to address these problems and summarizes suitable synthetic routes, dopants, and coating materials that can improve the electrochemical performance of existing phosphate-based cathode materials. The detailed analysis of crystal structures and the multi-electron reaction of phosphate-based materials are discussed. Different strategies have been discussed for enhancing their electrochemical properties, such as synthetic methodologies, compounding, and nano-structuring, which will provide insight into the important progress made in these materials and better guidance for polyanionic phosphate-based cathode materials for NIBs.Archana KanwadeArchana Kanwade received her Bachelor of Science Degree from Willingdon College under Shivaji University Kolhapur (2018) and her Master of Science Degree from Sir Parashurambhau College under Savitribai Phule Pune University (2020) with specialization in Physics.

1. Introduction: from lithium-ion to sodium-ion batteries
Today, energy production, energy storage, and global warming are among the main concerns of society. With the increase in the world's population, the energy demand is also increasing. To fulfil the energy demand of the expanding universal community, the energy market is becoming greener and shifting towards renewable energy sources. Wind, solar, tidal, biomass, geothermal, etc., are renewable energy sources that are naturally irregular and distributed with respect to the confined large-scale resources that supply the majority of the electrical energy. To utilize the above-mentioned energy sources, we require good, reliable, and cost-effective energy-storage systems.1,2
The secondary battery technology is the best way to reserve electricity on a wide scale due to its adaptability, good energy conversion ability, as well as manageable maintenance. Thus, the environmentally friendly lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with a long life span are used for the commercialization of convenient and sustainable electric devices including electric vehicles.3,4
Due to the limited resources of lithium, it is expensive to make LIBs and wide-ranging energy storage systems. The use of LIBs for wide applications has led to the prediction that lithium supplies will run out in the future since the resources are very limited in the earth's crust.7 On the other hand, there are abundant sodium resources globally. Hence, NIBs technology is a promising alternative to LIBs and has attracted considerable attention since it has an electrochemical mechanism similar to LIBs and is of low cost.8–10 Sodium is one of the most abundant elements on earth. The natural resources for sodium are 1000 times more than those of lithium. There are unlimited distributions of sodium as it is the fourth most abundant among all the elements on the earth. In the United States, about 23 billion metric tons of soda ash are present so that the sodium-containing precursors can be easily obtained, which provide mesmerizing reasons for the fabrication of NIBs on a large scale. The ion carriers in both battery technologies are different even though the battery parts and electrochemical mechanism of NIBs are almost identical to that of LIBs. The ionic radius of sodium (1.02 Å, co-ordination number 6) is greater than that of lithium (0.76 Å co-ordination number 6), which results in a change in the interphase formation, transport properties, and phase stability of the host materials during intercalation and deintercalation.11 The atomic weight of sodium (23 g mol−1) is greater than that of lithium (6.9 g mol−1) and the higher electrochemical potential means the greater tendency of the metal to lose an electron (V vs. SHE), and lithium (−3.02 V) has a larger electrochemical potential as compared to sodium (−2.71 V), which affects the energy/power density of NIBs (Table 1). Also, the capacity of a typical battery is dependent on the type and structure of the material that is used for the electrodes.12

The comparison between LIB and NIB is illustrated in Fig. 1a, which demonstrates the prime motive for developing NIBs. Another motive is that the Cu current collector of LIBs can be replaced with a cheap and lightweight Al current collector. As the Al forms an alloy with Li while not forming an alloy with Na, it is the best alternative for Cu in NIBs, which reduces the cost by 8%. The energy densities of NIBs are approximate to commercial LIBs. The first LIB commercialized by the Japanese SONY company had an energy density of 80 W h kg−1 and the energy densities of the latest LIBs have been improved to ∼150–200 W h kg−1.13 On the other hand, the first 18650 NIBs had 90 W h kg−1, while that of the pouch cells commercialized by Faradion and Novasis had ∼150 and 130 W h kg−1.14 The LIBs, particularly LiFePO4 (LFP), exhibit the general cyclability of ∼2000 and more cycles at 1C, while NIBs have the outstanding cyclability of nearly 4000 cycles at 1C rate.15 The LIBs can operate within the optimal temperature range of −20 to 55 °C while discharging and 0 to 45 °C in general.16 On the other hand, NIBs, particularly Bi//Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7@C, work in the wide temperature range of −70 to 100 °C.17 The cell temperature is due to internal exothermic reactions, which facilitate the self-heating temperature. The self-heating temperature of LIB (165 °C) is lower than that of NIB (260 °C), which means the NIBs start self-heating later, leading to superior thermal stability.18

Fig. 1b shows the components of the sodium-ion battery, which include the cathode, anode, current collectors, electrolyte, and separator. Each component contributes to the overall working of the NIBs. The two electrodes, anode and cathode have a porous nature that helps to store more charge carriers. Different categories of the cathode materials have been reported, including layered transition metal oxides,20–22 tunnel type oxide materials, sulphates, polyanion compounds,23,24 phosphates, pyrophosphates, Prussian blue analogues,25etc. For the anode, it has been reported that graphite is not suitable as it does not intercalate sodium ions properly.26 Various anode materials like hard carbons,27,28 carbon black, oxide,29etc., allow the insertion of sodium ions, which have been comprehensively synthesized and tested for NIBs. The two current collectors are used in NIBs to connect with the outer load. Generally, current collectors are made up of metal foils. Copper is used as the anode current collector in LIBs but now cost-effective aluminium foil acts as the anode current collector in NIBs. To date, layered transition metal oxides such as NaxTMO2 (0 < x ≤ 1),30 where TM means transition metal which can be Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, etc., and polyanionic compounds have attracted great attention from the scientific community. Some layered transition metal oxides exhibit high capacity but they generally work with a maximum potential of 3.5 V (Fig. 1c).31 This demerit restricts the ability to obtain the required energy density. On the other hand, polyanion compounds exhibit a wide range of potential windows with superior safety and a stable structure framework. They generally work at higher redox potentials due to the inductive effect, which depends on the changes in the molecular orbit due to the (PmO3m+1)n− polyanion group as shown in Fig. 1d. In accord with the molecular orbital principles, M–O interactions lead to the splitting of molecular orbitals, forming the bonding and antibonding orbitals. When the covalent bonding between M and O becomes stronger, the higher will be the splitting energy between bonding and antibonding orbitals. Due to this, electrons occupy the bonding orbitals. This leads to the raising of the antibonding orbital by reducing the energy difference between the vacuum (Δ) and antibonding orbitals. This results in the lowering of the redox potential but if the strong electronegative atom X comes in contact, forming M–O–X bonds, the M–O covalent bonding weakens and then Δ will increase leading to higher voltage. In polyanionic compounds, the polyanions are the prime reason for higher voltage. Owing to the above discussed properties, polyanions are supposed to be promising cathode materials in NIBs among the other categories of cathode materials as shown in Fig. 2a. For the phosphate, it is constructed with tetrahedral PO4 units having a strong covalent bond, which results in the isolation of valence electrons from polyanions.32 The special 3D framework is favourable for the de/intercalation of sodium ions. As such, the understanding of the electronic structure is a good way to develop polyanionic materials for NIBs.33 However, due to their low electric conductivity and capacity, they are hindered from practical applications.

2. Sodium-ion battery: working mechanism
A battery is an electrochemical device that consumes chemicals and converts chemical energy into direct electric current. A NIB is an energy storage system that works on the principle of electrochemical charge/discharge reactions due to the movement of sodium ions as the charge carriers. The basic battery system consists of components such as an anode, cathode, electrolyte, current collectors, and separator. The working principle of the NIB is analogous to that of the LIB. A schematic of the sodium-ion battery is shown in Fig. 3b. A sodium-ion cell is typically set up in the discharged state. The cathode is the sodium-ion source that contains transferrable sodium ions while the anode is sodium-free. For initial charging, the power source is used to induce the migration of electrons from the cathode to the anode via an external circuit. Charge neutrality is maintained by releasing sodium ions from the cathode into the electrolyte. These sodium ions reach the layers of the anode through the electrolyte as the ion-conducting channel. The electrons reach the anode from the cathode through the external circuit, and the sodium ions also reach the anode and become intercalated within the anode layers by capturing the electrons. Accordingly, oxidation and reduction reactions take place at the cathode and anode, respectively. More and more sodium ions are released from the cathode and stored in the anode via the intercalation mechanism and the battery is charged. During discharge, the power source is removed, and the load is connected across the two terminals of the cell. The migration of electrons and sodium ions is reversed, the electrons migrate from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit as they cannot pass through an electrolyte, and electricity is generated in the load. The sodium ions start moving from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte and after capturing the electrons, they become sodiated to the cathode materials. After the sodiation of all the sodium ions on the cathode materials, both the electrodes come back to their initial-stage discharged state. In this case, the oxidation and reduction reactions take place at the anode and cathode, respectively.
3. Electrochemical concepts in battery technology
For an electrode, the intrinsic properties are the faradaic capacity and voltage profiles. However, the storage capacity and open-circuit voltage are measurable quantities. Using these quantitative evaluations, the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials can be estimated. This highly depends on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of intercalation compounds. The change in Gibbs's free energy determines the voltage between reactants and products, while the amount of transferred electric charges determines the faradaic capacity. Assuming that electrode A shows the active participation in the battery performance,A + xNa ↔ NaxA
Its faradaic capacity and voltage can be determined using eqn (1) and (2), respectively. QF = nF/M(1) E = −ΔrG/nF(2)where E is voltage, QF is faradaic capacity, M is the molar weight of active material, F is the faradaic constant and ΔG is Gibbs free energy for the change of the reaction. By definition, the difference in potential between the oxidation and reduction reaction is termed the voltage. If we consider one side of the electrode reactions, such as NaFePO4 → Na+ + FePO4, reference and counter electrodes are needed, which have a constant potential during the reaction and allow a pathway for the current. The product of faradaic capacity and voltage gives the energy capacity QE, as given in eqn (3) QE = EQF = ∫EdQF(3)

Eqn (1)–(3) provide the means to calculate theoretical values. However, the practical scenario is complicated due to reasons such as polarization during the process, incomplete reactions, and sequential sub reactions. Experimentally, the capacity and voltage cannot be constant, and they may change with testing conditions. Hence, the charge and discharge mechanism must be treated individually while calculating energy by using the integral formula as mentioned in eqn (3). The conservation of the energy and charge is not achieved due to the consumption of some charge carriers, and resistance due to the side reactions leading to the dissipation of energy in the form of heat. Therefore, coulombic efficiency, which is one of the important factors for analysing the sustainability of the battery, is reduced due to severe heat generation. The traditional electrochemical method for evaluating the electrochemical performances of the electrodes and the battery generally includes cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
3.1 Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry is an electrochemical measurement that is based on the concept of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and is a technique used to record the current for the potential swept linearly with respect to time. It shows various results corresponding to the factors such as the rate of electron transfer, electrochemical reactivity of materials, etc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is closely similar to the LSV. However, CV does not stop with only a single sweep within the provided voltage range. In LSV, the applied voltage range is E1 to E2. In CV, the first E2 is reached and it reverses to E1 again. This is the ‘cyclic’ current versus the potential and it is termed ‘cyclic voltammetry’, which is represented in Fig. 4a.

(d) A typical galvanostatic discharge plot of the battery. (e) Randles circuit with the corresponding EIS. (f) Bode plot showing a linear relationship between Zre or Zim and ω−1/2. 
The scan rate (ν), which is V/t, is very important in CV analysis. With the same scan rate, the repetition of several cycles gives the results corresponding to the voltage, cyclability, and reversibility of redox reactions. With the change in scan rate, the kinetics of electrochemical oxidation–reduction reactions can be investigated. The CV curve for the battery is shown in Fig. 4b. From the CV curve, we can determine the peak voltage (Ep) as well as peak current (ip). To check the reversibility of the electrochemical system, the ratio of the peak current and difference in peak voltage (ΔEp) in the anodic and cathodic parts can be used. Since batteries give reversible faradaic capacity, voltage and current are important, which correspond to the electrode reactions and faradaic capacity, respectively, as given in eqn (4). (4)
The voltage versus capacity plot (as represented in Fig. 4c) shows the charge and discharge plateau that corresponds to the anodic and cathodic peak voltages, respectively. The scan range is between 0.1 and 10 mV s−1 in batteries. However, in practice, the equipment has a detection limit due to which the scan rate cannot be that much slower. There are three modes of current responses, which are represented by eqn (5) iF = is + iB(5)where iF is the faradaic current, is is the surface current and iB is the current in bulk. These three modes are because of the slow ionic diffusion in a solid electrode. The redox mechanism occurring in the active electrode materials produces current because of ionic diffusion and it is linearly proportional to the square root of the scan rate. So, the Nernst equation for such a case is given in eqn (6) as follows: (6)where F is the faradaic constant, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, A is an active area of the electrode, C* is the concentration of charge carriers, R is the gas constant, D is the diffusion coefficient, and  is a unitless quantity and is constant at a given voltage. In the case of a pure diffusion-controlled electrode process, the peak current (ip) and scan rate (ν1/2) determine the diffusion coefficient D. Even though real batteries do not obey the ideal Nernst system, for the sake of qualitative analysis, these equations are used. In real batteries, the peak position of the voltage shifts because of increased polarization but there is no significant shift in the peak intensity of the current. For long cycle–cycle stability, (t ≫ L2/D), eqn (7) shows the relationship between current response I and diffusion coefficient D. (7)
This equation is applicable when D remains constant during a whole period.
3.2 Galvanostatic charge–discharge
Along with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were carried out to check the capacity retention over various cycles. In a battery, during charging, the metal ions flow from the cathode through the electrolyte and separator towards the anode. This direction of flow of metal ions is reversed while discharging and ions travel from the anode to the cathode. The potential versus time (commonly known as chronopotentiometry is shown in Fig. 4d) was recorded for the electrochemical system. The C-rate is defined as the rate measurement at which the battery is fully charged or discharged, corresponding to its maximum capacity, and was analysed afterward. In the battery system, the C-rate gives information about the maximum current that a battery can safely deliver. GCD is useful for calculating the specific capacitance of the battery. Additionally, GCD provides quantitative information about the ion transport kinetics, electrochemical performance, efficiency of the battery and cycle stability. It also gives information about its dependence on the usage and the environmental factors such as the state of charge and temperature, etc.
3.3 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
AC impedance spectroscopy is termed Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). This technique is based on the phenomena of linear response theory and incorporates the impedance, which is the ratio of applied voltage and current response. It is used to study the charge transfer relation, and kinetic mechanism taking place at the electrode/electrolyte interface and determines the effect of conductivity and charge-transfer mechanism on the performance of an electrode. In a battery system, a low sinusoidal voltage over a frequency of 10 kHz to 10 mHz and the corresponding amplitude and phase shift of the output current or voltage is recorded, resulting in an impedance spectrum. EIS has two forms of plots: one is the Nyquist plot (Fig. 4e) and the other is the Bode plot (Fig. 4f). The Nyquist plot is the graph of the real part versus the imaginary part of the impedance. The equivalent electrical circuit corresponding to the Nyquist plot is known as the ‘Randles circuit’, which consists of the internal resistance Rint, double layer capacitance Cdl, charge transfer resistance Rct and Warburg impedance ZW. Warburg impedance is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency and is based on semi-infinite linear diffusion.
Warburg impedance is ignored when the frequency of an applied signal is high enough. Hence, the real and imaginary parts of impedance may be given as eqn (8) and (9), respectively, where the frequency is denoted as ω. (8) (9)

Eqn (10) corresponds to the semicircle shown in the high-frequency range. (10)

R
int corresponds to the beginning point of the graph and Rct is twice the radius of the semicircle. If the plot shows more than one semicircle, it should be considered that the equivalent circuit consists of more than one capacitor. The Nyquist plot does not provide any information about frequency even though EIS depends on frequency. However, the Bode plot gives the frequency values. From the Bode plot, the values of norm and phase impedance can be obtained and so the charge transfer resistance can be estimated.
4. Na-based cathode materials
The cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries are classified into three categories such as layered transition metal oxides,34 polyanionic compounds, organic compounds and Prussian blue analogues (Fig. 2). In comparison with LIBs, large Na ions bring distortion to the structure of the layered oxide during de/intercalation. They are generally not stable and are moisture sensitive, hence there is a need for moisture-free cathode material for NIBs.35 The presence of vacancies in PB analogues is reported to be deficient for Na+ storage. During de/intercalation, the Fe–CN–Fe bond collapses and the lattice distorts. Therefore, synthesizing a perfect PB structure with high efficiency at room temperature is still a challenge.36 Polyanionic cathode materials in LIBs have attracted significant attention due to the stable host crystal structure providing improved electrochemical properties, better safety and long-life cycling performance.37 However, Na+ has sizes ∼3 times larger than Li+. Polyanionic compounds provide a more open pathway for Na+ transport. For NIBs, the major and important challenge for developing high-energy NIBs is to develop novel cathode materials containing more than one active site and increased redox potential. The anode is considered to work with lower voltages (<2 V vs. Na), therefore, cathode materials with higher voltage and anode materials with lower voltages are required to improve the energy density and the high specific capacity of NIBs. The mass of active material is also responsible for the capacity of the battery. The networks in the polyanionic compound have available octahedral interstitials so that sodium has a 6-coordination geometry. Phosphate compounds have various crystal structures and beneficial characteristics, which include NASICONs, orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, mixed phosphates, and sulphates. Here, we discuss the V-, Fe-, Ti-, Mn- and Cr-based phosphate cathode materials including orthophosphates, pyrophosphates, NASICONs, fluorophosphates, and mixed phosphates which are represented in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Classification of phosphate-based cathode materials for NIBs. 
4.1 Vanadium-based phosphates
The vanadium based polyanionic compounds with an adaptable arrangement and oxidation states of V ions allow structural diversity. These compounds have attracted great interest because of their thermal stability, enhanced cyclic performance and high energy density.38 The various oxidation states of V(+2,+3,+4,+5) and high potential window (0–4.5 V) makes V-based polyanionic compounds suitable as cathode materials for NIBs.39

4.1.1 NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3. 
NASICONs can have various possible morphologies such as rhombohedral, monoclinic, triclinic, orthorhombic, etc. NASICON builds a flexible 3D framework with redox-active M, M′ transition metal ions, and the sharing of octahedral MO6, M′O6 corners with tetrahedral XO4 allows the intercalation of 4 Na+ per structural formula,43 making this is a promising cathode material in terms of energy density.44 The oxidation state of elements (M & M′) decides the number of accommodated Na+ sites. However, slightly distorted octahedral units lead to poor electronic conductivity, cycling life and rate performance.45,46
NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 adopts a rhombohedral structure with space group 3c (Fig. 6a). Uebou's group first reported the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) in 2002. It was concluded that NVP has poor cycling stability in the potential range of 1.60–3.40 V which corresponds to the slightly distorted octahedral VO6 in the crystal structure.47 The “lantern units” V2(PO4)3 in NASICON NVP are due to the sharing of the corners of the VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. This allows the open structure to create large void spaces through which Na+ can easily intercalate. There are two Na sites, the Na(1) site having six-fold coordination is located between two V2(PO4)3 lantern units and the Na(2) site with eight-fold coordination is situated between two PO4 tetrahedra.48 The Na(1) and Na(2) sites are preoccupied with mobile Na ions with one and three interstitial positions per unit formula, respectively. There are very few reports that explain the habitation of all four Na ions in the Na sites of NASICON NVP. It was confirmed that both Na(1) and Na(2) sites take part in the ion diffusion process during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation.49

An excellent theoretical capacity of 236 mA h g−1 was reported in which the extraction of 4 Na+ per formula unit is explained. This happens because of the potential range and V3+/V4+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples.50 The robust structure of V2(PO4)3 and fast Na+ ion transportation resulted in a high capacity of 117 mA h g−1 with long cycle life operating at a voltage of 3.4 V.51 The sodium intercalation from NVP occurs at 3.4 V and continues until the NaV2(PO4)3 composition is reached, as shown in Fig. 6b.40 Further, after charging up to 4.0 V, the +4 valence of vanadium was established by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES).52 Even after charging the cathode up to 4.6 V, the third Na+ was still inaccessible in NaV2(PO4)3 (Fig. 6c)41. From CV, the redox couples due to intercalation and deintercalation were observed at about 1.6 V and 3.4 V, respectively and from GCD, the nature of the two-phase transformation was observed (Fig. 6d and e).42 The strong covalency between (PO4)− and the possible large variation of valence electrons in the 3d orbital enabled the electronic structure of V to change from 3d2 in N3VP to 3d0 in NVP during the deintercalation of Na ions, and from 3d2 to 3d3 in N4VP during intercalation without lattice structure deterioration.53 The NVP microspheres wrapped by N-doped carbon layers (N-doped NVP@C) exhibited a capacity of 99.3 mA h g−1 at 100C and excellent cycle stability with capacity retention of 79.1% after 10000 cycles at 20C. This porous microstructure provides bicontinuous pathways and specious solid–liquid contact area.54 NVP@C microspheres consisting of interwoven carbon nanorods and nanofiber networks also provide bicontinuous charge transport pathways.55 The doping of Fe, Zn, K, etc., into NVP decreased the particle size and Na+ transformation leading to enhanced rate performance and cycle stability.56,57 Yanjun Chen et al. doped F and Fe into the NFP/C compound. F-doping helps to minimize the particle size and Na+ pathways and increases the ionic conductivity while the Fe-doping stabilizes the structural framework. This exhibited the capacity of 92.2 mA h g−1 at 120C and the capacity retained was 65.1% over 3000 cycles at 120C.58 The redox reaction can be calculated from the redox reaction as given below:

More detailed and focused research work is needed to understand the reaction mechanism for the third Na ion extraction.


4.1.2 Na3V2(PO4)2F3. 
Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF, sodium vanadium fluorophosphate) has a crystal structure in which 1 (PO4)3− is replaced with 3 F−. NVPF adopts a tetragonal phase having the space group P42/mnm.59 The NVPF 3D crystal framework is constructed of the bi-octahedra V2O8F3 alternately connected to tetrahedral PO4, which leads to better Na ion diffusion.60 Na+ occupies the triangular prismatic location (Fig. 7a), which is surrounded by two fluorine and four oxygen ions. This unique crystal structure, rich electrochemistry and excellent Na de/intercalation properties of NVPF make it a good candidate for a cathode.61 Also, the ionicity of the F–V bond is stronger than the NVP structure, which means the inductive effect of (PO4)3− can be enhanced, leading to higher working potential and enhanced energy density.62 Many studies have reported the possible Na achievable passages for primitive NVPF, which demonstrates low electrical conductivity and prohibits its electrochemical properties at high current density values.63 Coating NVPF with a conducting carbon phase is one of the ways to tackle this issue.64,65 Also, few reports have revealed that the inherent properties can be improved by doping with metallic ions.

Xu et al. synthesized hierarchical Na3V1.95Mn0.05(PO4)2F3/C hollow micro-spheres as a cathode material for NIB, which showed enhanced electrical conductivity and better ion diffusion coefficient than pristine PVDF.67 Yuqiang Pi et al. synthesized NVPF/C microspheres that showed an outstanding reversible capacity of 114.1 mA h g−1 with remarkable cycling performance (capacity retention of 71.8% at 10C over 600 cycles).68 Carbon coating enhances the electronic conductivity as well as electrode kinetics and reduces the Na+ migration path.69,70 To further enhance the electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance, NVPF was doped with Zr and N.71 The electronic conductivity increased with an increase in Zr content. It delivered the remarkable specific capacity of 110.3 mA h g−1 at 10C and capacity retention of 83.6% even after 1000 cycles at 5C.72
Another category of NVPF is Na3V2(PO4)2F3−2yO2y (0 ≤ y ≤ 1), i.e. NVPFO cathode material, which works in the potential range of 3.6–4.1 V.66,73,74 Cao's group showed that the NVPFO@porous carbon/graphene sandwich structure can provide two ways for ions to travel as well as electrons. It was revealed that graphene sheets contribute to the electronic as well as the ionic conductivity of NVPFO.75 Hu et al. demonstrated an EPR study (Fig. 7b and c) of the charge storage operation in Na3V2(PO4)2O1.6F1.4.66 This charge storage process occurs in two different ways: one is the partial V3+ converted to V4+ and the other one is V4+converted to V5+, which showed the usage of 2 electrons per formula unit of NVPFO. The imperfect conversion mechanism revealed that a mingled phase of V3+/V4+/V5+ was observed in the charged state. Ceder et al. marked the linkage observed among local and valence structures of vanadium ions.73 The F–V–F–V–F bonds of bi-octahedra in NVPF had the typical bond lengths associated with octahedral V3+ and V4+; V5+ had more asymmetry. For V2O10−2xF1+2x bi-octahedra in Na3(VO1−x)2(PO4)2F1+2x compounds, the three types of axial bond sequences (F–V–F–V–F, F–V–F–V–O and O–V–F–V–O) were expected. Therefore, it is worth studying all possible valences of vanadium ion for each configuration of bond sequence.


4.1.3 NaVPO4F and NaVOPO4. 
NaVPO4F can adopt tetragonal symmetry having the I4/mmm space group, as well as monoclinic symmetry with a C2/c space group.76 It shows one Na with a 3.7 V plateau related to the tetragonal phase and a 3.4 V plateau for the monoclinic phase due to the V3+/V4+ reaction.77 Zhao et al. synthesized NaVPO4F nanoparticles embedded in the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carbon network (Fig. 8a and b). This compound delivered 75.1 mA h g−1 at 15C with outstanding cycling capacity even after 1500 cycles. The improved reaction kinetics of the compound is represented by using the electrochemical spectra (Fig. 8c–e)78. The carbon network provides faster kinetics of NaVPO4F particles and continuous electronic conduction.79–81

Copyright 2020 RSC. 
The lodging of Na into the as-prepared NaVPO4F has not yet been achieved. There are seven explored crystallographic forms of VOPO4. All the structures have been studied and reported to be electrochemically active for LIBs.82 Three forms of the structure are known as a polymorphism for LIBs and the other three forms could be a result of the lithiation of Li2VOPO4.83
The schematic illustration of the crystal structure of NaVOPO4 is represented in Fig. 9. Shen et al. synthesized NaVOPO4/5%KB, taking Ketjen Black (KB) as conductive carbon. This strategy improved the electrochemical performance of the battery, it delivered a capacity of 140.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, and 84.8% capacity was retained even after 1000 cycles (Fig. 10). This can be ascribed to the nanostructure and specious electron transport tunnel.85 By controlling the morphology, 2-e capacity was achieved and the ε-VOPO4 system is capable of providing 2-e reactions. Further, to obtain three forms of NaVOPO4 polymorphisms, one Na+ ion should be added to each of the three VOPO4.86 The crystal structure of NaVOPO4 is represented by Fig. 8. Systematic investigations of multielectron activity on the sodiation of NaVOPO4 are worth carrying out but have not yet been reported. Recently Fang et al. synthesized NaVOPO4 with 1 symmetry by using the solvothermal method and indicated a 1-e reaction at 3.5 V with good stability retention.87

4.1.4 Pyrophosphates or mixed phosphates. 
Recently, many studies on vanadium-based pyrophosphates or mixed orthophosphates–pyrophosphates have been investigated together with Na7V3(P2O7)4 with space group C2/c88 (Fig. 11a), Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4 having space group 421/c89 (Fig. 11b), and NaVP2O7 with space group P21/c.90 Many studies have shown that Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4 and Na7V3(P2O7)4 demonstrate capacities of about 80 mA h g−1 with a working potential of ∼3.9 V and exhibit good electrochemical properties. Masquelier et al. synthesized Na7V3Al(P2O7)4PO4 and Na7V2Al2(P2O7)4PO4, and achieved V3+/V4+/V5+ in the potential window of 2.6–5.0 V (Fig. 11c–e). Also, both of them exhibited good capacity retention in the working potential window.91 The XRD results showed the structure of Na7V3Al(P2O7)4PO4. NaVP2O7 exhibited monoclinic symmetry with the P21/c space group and it achieved low reversible capacity with V4+/V3+ at 3.4 V.88 Vanadium-based phosphate compounds with different compositions and corresponding rate performance are as shown in Table 2.

The carbon coating improves the specific capacity up to 86.4 mA h g−1 at 10C with a potential range of 2.5–4.2 V. The rod-structure increases the specific surface area as well as pore size distribution and this results in remarkable electrochemical properties (Fig. 12)93. In LiVP2O7, the utilization of two Li+ ions occurs through V2+/V3+ redox couples at 4.3 V, while for the NaVP2O7, no work has been reported on the insertion of a second Na+. More investigations should be done on Na9V3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 in the future.

4.2 Iron-based phosphates
Despite the excellent properties of V-based cathode materials, there are some bottlenecks like two-phase transformation, low electronic conductivity, toxicity, and the high cost of vanadium precursors.108 Hence, recent research work has focused on reducing the V content by replacing it with other abundant elements such as Fe, Ti, Mn, Co, etc. The natural abundance, high redox potential window, low production cost, and excellent thermal structural stability have made Fe-based polyanionic phosphate compounds a promising cathode for sodium-ion batteries. Research communities are focusing on the iron-based cathode materials for NIBs due to the abundance and non-toxic nature of sodium and iron. In the polyanion, the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple plays an important role. Along with this, the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox state is rarely active in some of the phosphates.

4.2.1 NaFePO4. 
The inspiration to do work on NaFePO4 material is the commercialization of LiFePO4 and its wide usage in electric vehicles by John B. Goodenough's group. In 2012, Sun et al., via the electrochemical Li/Na exchange method, developed olivine NFP and achieved a specific capacity of 125 mA h g−1.109 At high temperatures, while synthesizing NFP, it changes its phase from olivine to maricite, and so olivine LiFePO4 as the pristine material via ion-exchange method was adopted to obtain olivine NFP (Fig. 13a). During charging and discharging, because of the large ionic radii of sodium, NPF suffers a large lattice volume change of approximately 18%, which affects the electrochemical performance.110 To address this issue, carbon coating on NFP and nanocrystallization are widely followed and achieved enhanced electrochemical performance. Loh et al. prepared NFP nanoparticles via the ion-exchange method and obtained improved electrochemical performance in a potential window of 2.0–4.0 V. Also, a reversible discharge capacity of 142 mA h g−1 with capacity retention of 70% over 6000 cycles was observed.111 Kim et al. synthesized NFP, which delivered a reversible specific capacity of 140 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with capacity retention of about 100% after 5000 cycles at 10C.112

Detailed studies of maricite NFP for sodium-ion storage have been conducted. Coating the carbon layer enhances the electric conductivity and minimizes the lattice volume expansion value of NFP. The NFP/C was synthesized and an electrode was fabricated by Shen's research group, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 142 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with capacity retention of about 100% after 5000 cycles at 10C.116 The NFP/carbon nanofiber electrode delivered a specific capacity of 108 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. The retained capacity was 94.4% even after 450 cycles.117 The combined effect of the 3D conductive framework morphology boosts the electrical conductivity of the material and helps to reduce the volume expansion value of the lattice. Bingqiu Liu et al. synthesized NFP nanoclusters composed of numerous ultrafine NFP@C subunits with the size of ∼3 nm. This compound delivered a high specific capacity of 149.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and outstanding cycling performance with 95% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 10C. Even at a low temperature ranging from −10 °C to −20 °C, it exhibited outstanding electrochemical properties. This splendid rate performance can be attributed to the ultrafine NFP@C subunits that reduce Na+/electron diffusion pathways. This 3D carbon network of ultrafine NFP@C subunits can accommodate the volume expansion of NFP during the charging–discharging process.118


4.2.2 Na2FePO4F. 
Na2FePO4F exhibit a layered orthorhombic phase with a space group of Pbcn represented by Fig. 13b. Na2FePO4F has attracted great attention due to its low cost, Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple, and the Na de/intercalation mechanism. Nazar et al. were the first to investigate NFPF in 2007 and concluded that the ion extraction/insertion was exhibited by one sodium ion. It follows the path Na2FePO4F → Na1.5FePO4F → NaFePO4F and showed a small volume expansion of 3.7%.119 Further structural evolution was carried out using ex situ solid-state NMR. This study realized that Na1 remained while Na2 was extracted in the crystal during the charging process and Na2 was fully inserted during the discharging process.120 Also, the DFT calculations showed that NFP with 1D sodium diffusion passage (0.32 eV) had larger Na+ migration barriers than that of the NFPF with the 2D sodium diffusion passage (0.29 eV), leading to the smaller volume expansion value of the NFPF lattice than NFP.121 Shao et al. synthesized NFPF/C electrode vitamin C as a carbon source, which showed a specific capacity of 117 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with capacity retention of about 85% even over 1000 cycles at 4C.122,123 Even NFPF/C and the reduced graphene oxide composite showed a good specific capacity of approximately 110 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and cycle stability of 70% after 5000 cycles at 10C.124,125 In general, due to the lower mass of NFP, a specific capacity of NFP is higher than that of the NFPF. Jiahong Xun et al. synthesized NFPF@CNT (Fig. 13c and d) via a hydrothermal route and observed improved electrochemical properties. This compound had a monodisperse 1D morphology with a specific capacity of 118 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and it showed good results even after 2500 cycles. It was concluded that the complex morphology could supply sufficient sites for sodium-ion diffusion as well as for rapid electronic transport. The improved Na+ diffusion ability and electronic conductivity were studied through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. 13e).115 The 3D polyanion framework constructed by FeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra makes the NFP crystal structure more stable than that of the Fe2O7F2 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra of the 2D polyanion structure in NFPF, which results in more cycle stability than NFPF.


4.2.3 Na3Fe2(PO4)3. 
Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is a NASICON compound that adopts the C2/c space group. This polyanion compound takes one sodium within a potential window of 1.5–3.5 V showing a specific capacity of 61 mA h g−1 and the redox couple Fe2+/Fe3+ is active, which was confirmed by using ex situ XPS.126 Also, the calculated working potential of Fe3+/Fe4+ in NASICON is ∼4.8 V.39 However, under 4.2 V, the redox couple does not contribute Fe3+/Fe4+ in Na3.5Fe1.5(PO4)3, as observed through Mössbauer spectroscopy.127 The flake-porous structure of the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 compound exhibits the specific capacity of 100.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and maintains the capacity of 60 mA h g−1 even after 1100 cycles at 5C; this was demonstrated by the galvanostatic charge–discharge curve (Fig. 14), and is attributed to the 2D porous-sheet morphology.128

4.2.4 Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7. 
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 exhibits an orthorhombic symmetry with space group Pn21a (Fig. 15a). The PO4− and P2O7− groups in this structure use the properties of both phosphate and pyrophosphate.129 This results in high stability, low cost, promising theoretical capacity (129 mA h g−1), and ease of synthesis. This polyanion compound obtained a reversible discharge capacity of 105 mA h g−1 with an average voltage profile of 3.2 V which matches the theoretical value.130,131 Under 4.5 V, the activity of the Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple in Mn-doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 resulted in enhanced capacity (Fig. 15b). Tianci Yuan et al. constructed 3D graphene-decorated Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) microspheres via a spray-drying method to enhance the electrochemical performance of Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7), which delivered a reversible capacity of 128 mA h g−1 at 0.1C between 1.7 and 4.3 V, as well as good cycle stability of 62.3% capacity retention after 6000 cycles at 10C (Fig. 15c and d).

The excellent performance of the material can be attributed to the 3D rGO scaffold, which provides reduced pathways for faster electron transportation and also the flexible matrix helps to reduce the structural stress during the charging/discharging process.133 Nanostructuring is one of the ways to improve the electrochemical properties by providing a specious pathway for the ions to be transported, and carbon coating improves the electronic conductivity of polyanion compounds. Xiangjun et al. synthesized carbon-coated Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP/C) with the spherical morphology via a template method, with a diameter of 29.3 nm (Fig. 16).

This compound delivered the first discharge capacity of about 128.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2C.134 Recently, there have been few reports where better electrochemical performance and electronic conductivity were achieved.135,136 Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2(P2O7) was synthesized with Fe-defects, exhibiting outstanding rate performance and long cycle stability.137 One study was reported recently in which they used imide salts as the electrolyte instead of the conventional NaPF6. They found that the imide-based electrolyte, compared to NaPF6, supports the successive intercalation of Na ions from the different sites of the NFPP crystal structure.138 This compound exhibits excellent cycle stability with less volume expansion and as a result, it is one of the promising candidates as a cathode material for NIBs.132


4.2.5 Na2FeP2O7. 
Na2FeP2O7 adopts a triclinic phase with space group 1 (Fig. 17a) and was obtained via a glass-ceramic process, solid-state method and solution-combustion route.139 This compound exhibits the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple having one sodium ion de/intercalation and obtained a reversible specific capacity of 88 mA h g−1.139 The excellent rate and cycle performance make it a promising cathode material for NIBs.140 Zeng et al. synthesized novel Na2FeP2O7@C/expanded graphite, which improved the electronic conductivity and cycling stability of the material. It exhibited the capacity of 91.7 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and capacity retention was 87.7% over 400 cycles. The carbon content shortens the Na+ transmission pathways, resulting in the improved electrochemical performance of Na2FeP2O7.141,142 Along with this, the doping can improve the electrochemical performance of this type of compound. The 5% doping of Mg delivered the capacity of 90 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and maintained the capacity retention of about 100% after 700 cycles. Mg doping enhances the electronic conductivity as well as the Na+ diffusion coefficient.143 However, the access of the second Na+ ion is not developed even on raising the upper cut-off potential to 4.5 V, taking into consideration the theoretical voltage, which is higher than 5 V for the second sodium ion extraction.139,144

Since Fe-containing raw materials are abundant and show interesting cycling performance, Fe-based polyanionic phosphate frameworks are suitable for long-lifespan cathode material fabrication for NIBs.

4.3 Manganese-based phosphates
The Mn containing raw materials are plentiful in the Earth's crust, low-cost, and can be adapted to a stable structure. Along with layered and tunnel oxides, Mn-based phosphate compounds have been broadly studied as cathode material for NIBs. Under 5 V, Mn2+/Mn3+, as well as Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couples might be active in polyanionic compounds.39

4.3.1 NASICON Na3MnM(PO4)3. 
NASICON Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (Fig. 17b) shows the ability for de/intercalation of sodium ions and multielectron reactions.146 It was first demonstrated by Gao et al. who studied the mechanism due to different redox couples observed in different electrolytes.148 The CV analysis showed two reversible redox peaks for each potential at about 3.6 V and 4.1 V, which corresponds to the Mn2+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+, respectively. The presence of Ti3+/Ti4+ in NMTP shows the 3-electron reaction and improves capacity. Jiapin Liu's group synthesized microsphere carbon-coated MNTP, which reduced the Na ion diffusion pathway and improved electronic conductivity. It delivers a reversible capacity of around 108.5 mA h g−1, and even over 1000 cycles, the capacity retention was 79.2% at 2C rate. The CV plot reveals that Ti3+/Ti4+, Mn2+/Mn3+, and Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couples are active throughout the process.149,150 Further, to obtain improved structure and electrochemical performance, Na4MnAl(PO4)3 was synthesized via a sol–gel route, having an 32 space group. The ex situ XRD and XPS determined the sodium ion diffusion and storage mechanism using first-principles calculations. The charge/discharge and diffusion processes in MNTP take place along the path Na(1) ↔ Na(2) ↔ Na(3). The DFT calculations suggested that Mn4+/Mn5+ corresponds to the voltage plateau of ∼4.48 V, which can be easily accessed.151


4.3.2 Na2MnPO4F. 
Na2MnPO4F shows a P21/n space group. Na2MnPO4F is constructed by two MnO4F2 octahedra structures interconnected via F corners to make Mn2F2O8 and PO4 tetrahedra bridges between these chains establishing a 3D structure with 4 Na sites as shown in Fig. 17c. The Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple readily removes the first Na+ from the Na2MnPO4F structure and has a specific capacity of approximately 120 mA h g−1.147 The Na2MnPO4F/C composite at 55 °C delivers a capacity of 178 mA h g−1 in the potential window 1.0–4.5 V.147 To improve the rate and cycling performance, work should be done on the activation of redox couples Mn2+/Mn3+ as well as Mn3+/Mn4+.


4.3.3 Na4Mn3(PO4)2P2O7. 
The mixed orthophosphate–pyrophosphate Na4Mn3(PO4)2P2O7 adopts a 3D orthorhombic structure having Pn21a.152 The 3D structure is constructed by sharing the corner/edge of octahedral MnO6 and PO4 tetrahedra, which make up bridged pseudo-layers of the P2O7 unit. It demonstrates a reversible specific capacity of 110 mA h g−1 within the potential window of 1.7 to 4.5 V at 0.05C and also excellent cycle and rate performance. Due to its life-long performance, improved energy density and low cost, Na4Mn3(PO4)2P2O7 is a good candidate for NIBs as a cathode material.132 The activation of Mn2+/Mn3+ corresponds to the de/intercalation of three Na ions, but the extraction of the fourth Na+ is still under investigation.


4.3.4 Na2MnP2O7. 
Na2MnP2O7 adopts not only α-phase (1 symmetry) (Fig. 17d) but also β-phase (P1 symmetry) polymorphism153 and is useful for NIBs as cathode materials. Na2MnP2O7 having the α-phase delivers a specific capacity of about 90 mA h g−1 with an excellent electrochemical performance at 3.8 V.154 Huangxu Li et al. synthesized graphene layer-modified Na2MnP2O7 (NMP@GL) and delivered 92.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C within a voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V and the capacity retention was 83% after 600 cycles at 2C. It improved the diffusion kinetics of ions/electrons and manganese dissolution occurred.155 Despite that, the diffusion of the second Na+ is not possible within the working potential window because for the upper voltage of around 4.5 V, the specific capacity is not higher than 90 mA h g−1.

4.4 Titanium and chromium-based phosphates

4.4.1 NASICON Na3Ti2(PO4)3. 
NASICON Na3Ti2(PO4)3 shows a rhombohedral crystal structure with 3c symmetry.156 Due to the safety and excellent cycling stability, NASICON Na3Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 18a) has attracted much attention for NIBs as a promising cathode material.157,158 Tan et al. synthesized the NTP nanofiber bundles via the hydrothermal method (Fig. 18b).159 Na3Ti2(PO4)3@rGO displays a reversible capacity of 128 mA h g−1 within 1.4–3.0 V at C/10, which corresponds to the two Na ion extractions via the Ti3+/Ti4+ reaction.157,160 To enhance the storage performance of Na, Xu et al. synthesized Gd3+-doped mesoporous NTP nanoparticles. The electrochemical performance revealed that Gd3+ introduction resulted in higher Na+ mobility, highly porous structure and larger electronic conductivity. It delivered a stable capacity even after 30000 cycles at a 5 A g−1 current rate without much degradation.161 NaxTiNb(PO4)3 and NaxFeyTi1−y(PO4)3 compounds were found where Ti3+/Ti4+ is active for the process of sodium de/intercalation at ∼2.2 V vs. Na/Na+.162

4.4.2 NASICON Na3Cr2(PO4)3. 
NASICON Na3Cr2(PO4)3 was recently synthesized by Kawai's group and it was observed that Cr3+/Cr4+ is active at 4.5 V, obtaining a reversible specific capacity of around 80 mA h g−1 (Fig. 18c).164 It is expected to have the de/intercalation of Na+ into Na3Cr2(PO4)3 even at lower voltage because of the accessibility of Cr2+/Cr3+, as well as additional Na sites.165
Recently, the electronic and structural properties of Na3Cr2(PO4)3 were investigated. Diffusion kinetics was also discussed, followed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It showed electrochemical activity within a potential window of 3.65 V to 4.7 V ascribed to the redox couple Cr3+/Cr4+. Structural investigation and the calculations revealed Rc–3c1–Rc phase transformation during the desodiation in Na3Cr2(PO4)3. Fig. 18d and g represent the top view of 3c and 3c1 showing distorted PO4 and in Fig. 18e and f, the distorted CrO6 is depicted using arrows. When 1/3 Na is removed from the NCP structure, deformation occurs in the polyhedra in the 3c1 phase. However, distortion in the 3c1 phase occurs since Cr is quite electropositive. The distortion is small for the polyhedral of 3c1 as compared to that of Rc but the symmetry of NASICON NCP remained intact.163

5. Volume expansion
The important challenge for the phosphate compounds is the volume change during the reaction mechanism because the electrode is demolished during the redox reaction. This results in the mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) introduced in the sodium ion battery leading to poor cycling life.8 This volume change is dependent on the volume of the active compound. The volume expansion is less than 10% for materials like LiCoO2 or graphite. For sodium, the larger ionic radius tends to raise this issue even more severely. The volume expansion is nearly 20% for polyanionic compounds (Fig. 19a). This affects the cyclic stability and rate performance of NIBs. As such, there is a need to develop an effective way to terminate the volume expansion in NIBs for improving the cycle life and performance. Recently, some studies have been conducted on structural designs for indulging volume expansion. Modifying strategies of nanostructuring can help to reduce the volume expansion and improve the overall electrochemical performance of NIBs. To diminish the mechanical degradation and reinforce the bonds between materials, there are various routes for nanostructuring, including nanoflowers, hollow structures, composite structures, nanoarrays, core–shell structures, etc.177 The emerging structural designs can be the key to the progress in indulging volume expansion.

6. Strategies to boost the electrochemical performance of phosphate-based compounds
Despite the exploration of new polyanionic cathode materials, the modification of materials is a promising and productive way to enhance the electrochemical properties. Polyanionic phosphate-based compounds are currently facing the major problem of low electronic conductivity, which restricts charge transport and slows the rate of ion diffusion. Hence, appropriate and systematic ways to boost the electrochemical properties are necessary. Significant efforts should be made to overcome this issue. At present, the problem mentioned above can be figured out from five factors such as coating, doping, synthetic methodologies, compounding and nanostructuring, as shown in Fig. 19b. Here, we summarize the ongoing effective modification strategies of polyanion cathode materials.
6.1 Synthetic methodologies to control and optimize the morphology
The crystal structure and the morphology of the cathode material affect the electrochemical performance of the battery. Therefore, to preserve fast ionic diffusion, stable structure, and high electronic conductivity, the modification of structures is needed. In general, different synthetic methodologies for optimizing the crystal structure are proving to be a productive strategy for reducing the sodium ion diffusion passageway and increasing the surface area for ion de/intercalation. Solid-state reactions, sol–gel processes, hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, electrospinning and spray drying routes have been reported to be valid synthetic methodologies as tabulated in Table 4. Generally, all polyanionic cathode materials can be synthesized using the solid-state route. However, the particles obtained by this method have a larger size and no special structure, leading to poor electrochemical performance. Hence, the most common synthetic technique used is the sol–gel process. The particles obtained by this method have a smaller size as compared to the solid-state reactions, thus resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance; also, it is easier to coat carbon with material directly. However, this method takes a long time which restricts its practical applications. To prepare a small quantity of material and to get the desired nanostructure the hydrothermal/solvothermal method is useful. Sometimes, it is used in combination with the solid-state reaction or other synthetic routes to synthesize special structures. Along with these synthetic methods, electrospinning and spray drying are also used to synthesize materials with special nanostructures. Yang et al. synthesized NaTi2(PO4)3 nanotubes with four different organic compounds: triethylene glycol (NTP-TEG), n-propanol (NTP-NPA), ethylene glycol (NTP-EG), and n-butyl alcohol (NTP-NBA) by the solvothermal process. All as-synthesized materials showed improved reversible capacities and rate performances as shown in Fig. 20a.178

Yubin Niu's group successfully synthesized Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2@C nanofibers via electrospinning. This composite exhibited a reversible specific capacity of about 40 mA h g−1 at 1100 mA g−1 current rate.180 These performances can be further enhanced by optimizing the solvent type, ambient humidity, voltage magnitude, and temperature rate. The rarely used combustion method for polyanionic material synthesis requires a shorter synthesis period and lower temperature; it needs to take up a certain quantity of combustion fuel.
6.2 Compounding
Coating materials are used to enhance the properties of polyanionic compounds. To synthesize composite compounds, carbon materials like graphene,182 carbon nanotubes,183 carbon cloth,184 Ni foam, and so on, are used as the composite host. Recently, most of the reported materials have been composites. The composite combination of two active materials can be the best way of compounding. Shen's group synthesized the Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7@NaFePO4@C composite with carbon cloth. This composite showed the combined effect of both the electrochemical performances of NaFePO4 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7.185
6.3 Doping
The intrinsic energy of the material is important and corresponds to its electronic conductivity, so the modulation in the energy level of the material is the key to improving its electronic conductivity. This is done in two ways: (1) doping of inactive elements and (2) doping of active elements. The doping of small quantities of inactive elements like Mg, Cu and Al151 helps to improve the properties of the as-synthesized material in terms of working potential and capacity. The Al doping at the V-site of the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 improved the electrochemical properties of the compound, such as electronic conductivity, ionic conductivity, and charge kinetics in the electrode. This electrode material exhibited better charge–discharge cycle stability than Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with a discharge capacity of 103 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. The charge resistance is lower for Al-doped compounds than the pristine NVPF resulting in the enhanced electrical conductivity and Na ion kinetics of the electrode Fig. 20b–e.179 The doping of active elements like Fe, Cu, and Mn has been reported, which improved the overall electrochemical performance of the polyanionic compounds. The Cu doping in the Na4VMn(PO4)3 compound resulted in superior electrochemical properties with a capacity of 68 mA h g−1 at 30C. Cu doping improved the electronic conductivity of the electrode material.186
6.4 Coating to build a conductive framework
The polyanions present in polyanionic compounds result in poor electronic conductivity. To solve this issue, many studies have reported that coating is the better way to boost the electronic conductivity of polyanionic materials. The coating of carbonaceous materials is commonly used as a modification strategy.187 Coating a carbon layer on the surface of Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2, with a thickness of around 6 nm, improved the electrode properties. This type of coating increased the capacity of material from 79 to 100 mA h g−1 as well as improved rate performance.188 Uniformity and thickness of the coated layer are very important so one should give full attention while coating. Most of the studies reported have been on the coating of carbon material on the compound; however, the coating work may be extended to various other coating materials like oxides and polymers.
6.5 Nanostructuring
Polyanion phosphate-based compounds possess 3D frameworks leading to better and faster ion conductivity. However, the electrochemical performance depends on the electronic conductivity, structural stability as well as ionic conductivity. The larger size of nanoparticles results in reducing the Na+ diffusion process. Hence, the design of special and reasonable structures like nanorods, hollow structures, hierarchical structures and fibres, etc. (Fig. 21) is a basic and important requirement to boost the electrochemical properties of polyanionic phosphate materials. To achieve these requirements, the above-mentioned synthetic strategies are very useful approaches.

7. Future directions to expand applications
The application areas of polyanionic phosphate cathode materials are considerably more than those discussed above. They cover aqueous batteries, full cells as well as high-temperature batteries.
7.1 Aqueous batteries
The aqueous sodium-ion battery is another application of polyanionic compounds for stationary energy systems. Aqueous batteries have some drawbacks such as low energy density and safety issues due to flammable organic electrolyte; however, they deliver a better ionic conductivity and the faster kinetics of aqueous electrolytes makes them a promising alternative for large-scale energy storage systems. Cost and safety are key factors of any battery, so the main goals in fabricating aqueous batteries are to develop new synthetic processes and find electrode materials with abundant resources and stability. However, phosphate compounds, especially mixed phosphates, show good electrochemical performance for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. The first polyanion-based aqueous battery was first fabricated by Kim's group.194 The Na2FeP2O7-based aqueous battery was fabricated using Na2SO4 electrolyte. At 5C, the polarization decreased and capacity doubled in an aqueous electrolyte. Na2FeP2O7 delivered a capacity of around 50 mA h g−1 within a potential window of −0.2 V to 0.7 V and the capacity retention was 86% over 300 cycles at 1C, which is higher than that with the organic electrolyte. Deng et al.195 synthesized Na7V4(P2O7)4(PO4)/C nanorods for an aqueous sodium-ion battery, which delivered a reversible capacity of around 51.2 mA h g−1 at 80 mA g−1. These performances further indicate that the aqueous electrolytes can promote faster ion kinetics with better stability. By choosing the suitable type and concentration of the electrolyte, the electrochemical properties of aqueous sodium-ion batteries can be enhanced further.
7.2 Full cell fabrication
On the application level, practical battery prototypes have used polyanionic compounds as the cathode material, while choosing a suitable anode material is the main challenge for fabricating a full cell. The commonly used anode materials are hard carbon, carbon black, and Fe2O3. Xu et al.196 fabricated Na3.64Fe2.18(P2O7)2 cathode-based full cells that delivered a capacity of around 86 mA h g−1 at 0.5C with capacity retention of 80% over 100 cycles. Despite the ordered graphite carbons, hard carbon having disordered structures is more suitable for entrapping the large cationic-sized Na+ during insertion. Many studies have reported the hard carbons for sodium-ion batteries with a specific capacity greater than 300 mA h g−1. In addition to these carbon-based anode materials, oxide anodes have been reported as anode materials, such as NaTi2(PO4)3,197 for sodium-ion batteries; however, these types of anode materials are weak in working potential windows. This issue is resolved by using Mn- and Fe- based polyanionic phosphate compounds due to their high stability, low cost, and environment-friendly nature. Further studies are expected in the field of full cell fabrication.
7.3 High-temperature batteries
Polyanionic compounds exhibit high thermal stability and so they are chosen as the cathode material for high-temperature batteries. With temperature, the ion diffusion of polyanionic compounds improves, which opens up further advantages for the electrode materials. Hagiwara et al. synthesized Na2FeP2O7, which delivers a capacity of about 90 mA h g−1 at 363 K at a 5 mA g−1 rate and 91% capacity is retained after 1000 cycles.144 The full cell fabricated by coupling the NVP@C-NS-FL cathode and NTP@C-NS-FL shows good electrochemical properties at high temperatures. It delivers a reversible capacity of 108 mA h g−1 at 60 °C at 1C and a power capability of 1 kW kg−1.198 These performances show that the phosphate-based cathode materials are suitable for high-temperature batteries. However, to date, very few studies are reported on the implementation of polyanionic phosphate compounds in high-temperature battery systems. As such, more studies are necessary to explore other anode materials as well as cathode materials for high-temperature batteries.
8. Conclusion and perspectives
Here, we summarized the advancement of the multielectron reactions in polyanionic phosphate-based compounds and the energy storage process of NIBs. Na-ion batteries are explored in terms of their stability and energy density due to the abundant resources of Na as compared to Li-ion battery systems. The investigation of the electrode materials having excellent electrochemical properties with high thermal and structural stability is a new challenge in the development of high-performance NIBs. The diversity in the structural frameworks for various Na-based cathode materials opens up more opportunities for new Na-intercalation compounds. Among the various categories of cathode materials, polyanionic phosphate-based compounds such as fluorophosphates, phosphates, pyrophosphates, and so forth are recommended since they deliver long cycle durability, high thermal stability, and wide potential window.
In this paper, the research and development of the 3D framework and multielectron reactions in polyanion-type compounds are reviewed, and the polyanionic frameworks with cycle stability and potential window are summarized. It was revealed that the redox couples V2+/V3+/V4+/V5+ and Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+ of phosphate framework exhibit excellent cyclic stability. However, the electrochemical performance of Fe and Ti-based materials should be enhanced further. The phosphate materials that can utilize multielectron reactions (>2e) along with excellent performance are uncommon. In addition, the redox reaction mechanism and detailed structural analysis in the phosphate-based materials are under investigation.
There is still a difference in theoretical and experimental outcomes and so detailed investigations are required to understand the reversibility as well as the accessibility of multi-electron reactions in phosphate-based compounds. The modification strategies are reviewed here to effectively enhance the electrochemical properties and electronic conductivity of the polyanionic compounds. Carbon coating, oxide coating, and element doping should also be explored for more advantages. The low cost, long cycle durability, enhanced energy density, and improved rate capability of NIBs have attracted great attention from the scientific community. Productivity and manufacturability should also be examined for the commercialization of NIBs. It will be beneficial for spacious energy storage systems like NIBs if further studies focus on the full cells based on polyanionic phosphate frameworks.
