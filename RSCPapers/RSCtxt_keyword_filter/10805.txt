, Accepted 2nd November 2016First published on 11th November 2016AbstractA microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process was successfully developed for preparing CdS buffer layers in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. Crystallized CdS films with densified microstructures were formed on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers at 55 °C. The duration of the reaction was only 4 min. Increasing the reaction temperature facilitated homogeneous precipitation and suppressed heterogeneous precipitation, thereby decreasing the thickness of CdS films, and reduced Voc, Jsc, FF, and the conversion efficiency. When CdS buffer layers were prepared at 55 °C, a conversion efficiency of 10.2% was achieved, and the corresponding values of Voc, Jsc, and FF were measured to be 0.574 V, 32.5 mA cm−2, and 55.0%, respectively. Moreover, as the reaction temperature was increased, the shunt conductance, the diode factor, and the saturated current worsened, owing to insufficient coverage of CdS films. Increasing the reaction temperature decreased the photoluminescence intensity of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films covered by the prepared CdS films. This work demonstrates that the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process for preparing CdS buffer layers significantly shortened the reaction duration, and yielded high-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells.
1. Introduction
Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is an important semiconductor material that is used in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and Cu2ZnSnS4 solar cells owing to the n-type electric properties, the suitable alignment between the conduction band and the absorber layers, and close lattice matching with the absorber layers.1–4 Various processes such as the sputtering process,5 the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method,6 and the chemical bath deposition (CBD)1,7 have been utilized to deposit CdS films on the surfaces of absorber layers. Among these methods, CBD has the advantages of low cost, a low reaction temperature, and large-scale deposition.1,3 In the conventional CBD process, the heat source is a hot water bath, and a long reaction time is required to form sufficiently thick films. Therefore, the throughput rate of solar cells is limited, and energy consumption is increased. The extended heating duration also induces different growth rates of particles, yielding a wide distribution of particle sizes.
To reduce the energy consumption during the CBD process, microwave heating is used to prepare CdS thin films.8–10 Microwave process provides rapid heating rates owing to the energy generation via dipolar rotation and the oscillation of ions in the solution.11,12 The use of microwave heating during the CBD process therefore reduces the reaction time and improves production efficiency.13 CdS films for CdTe solar cells have been prepared via the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process. However, a long reaction time of over 20 min is necessary to obtain dense films.8,14 The microwave-assisted process has previously been used to prepare CdS films for superhydrophobic layers.10,15 However, the fibrous CdS films were formed, and the reaction temperature could not be well-controlled. Moreover, microwave heating has not before been used to prepare CdS buffer layers in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells.
For improving the uniformity of the microstructure of rapidly formed CdS films, the effects of temperature on the crystalline phases and the microstructures of the prepared CdS films were investigated herein. The microwave-assisted CBD process was used to deposit CdS films as the buffer layers in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. The optical properties of the prepared films were examined to assess for the usefulness in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. The I–V properties and external quantum efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells with microwave-prepared CdS buffer layers were characterized. Diode analysis was carried out to investigate the device performance in detail. The room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of CdS films that were prepared on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films were measured.
2. Experimental
The microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition (CBD) process was applied to prepare CdS thin films. Cadmium sulfate dehydrate and thiourea were used as the source of cadmium ions and sulfur ions, respectively. Ammonia was added to be the chelating agent. The reactants mentioned above were dissolved in de-ionized water and stirred for 30 min via magnetic stirrer to form the precursor solutions. The concentrations of cadmium ions, thiourea and ammonia were set to be 0.001–0.03 M, 0.05–0.2 M and 0.5–2 M, respectively. The soda-lime glass (SLG), washed with alcohol and de-ionized water was employed as the substrates. The prepared precursor solutions and the cleaned substrates were put into a Teflon container, followed by the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process. The microwave power was controlled to be 400 W. The detailed reaction conditions were similar to those described in the previous literatures.16 The deposition temperature was controlled in the range from 55 °C to 85 °C. The reaction duration was set as short as 4 min. For the deposition of CdS films on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films, the above precursor solutions and the cleaned Cu(In,Ga)Se2 film were put into a Teflon container, followed by the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process at various temperatures ranging from 55 °C to 85 °C. The schematic view of the deposition for CdS films on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films via the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process is illustrated in Fig. 1. After the microwave heating process, the prepared films were washed and dried for further characterizations.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the deposition for CdS films via the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process. 
The crystalline phase of the prepared films was examined via the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using CuKα irradiation at 45 kV and 40 mA. The microstructures of the obtained CdS films were observed via the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The UV-vis spectrometer was employed to investigate the transmittance and the band gap of the prepared CdS films. The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the prepared CdS films on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films were measured under the excitation of a semiconductor laser (808 nm, 10 W) using an InGaAs array spectrometer (512 elements, 900–1650 nm).
The solar cells based on the ITO/i-ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2/Mo/SLG structure were fabricated to investigate the temperature effect of depositing CdS thin films on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. The sputtering-derived Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers were applied as the substrates. A 100 nm i-ZnO and a 400 nm ITO were deposited on the prepared CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films via the RF-sputtering process to act as the window layers. The prepared Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells were illuminated via a solar simulator under AM 1.5 conditions at 25 °C for investigating the photovoltaic properties. The current–voltage measurement and the external quantum efficiency were carried out with Keithley 2400.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Effects of heating temperatures on the crystalline phase and microstructures of microwave-prepared CdS films on the glass substrates
Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of CdS films that were prepared on soda-lime glass via the microwave-assisted CBD process. The duration of the reaction for all films was fixed to 4 min. When the reaction temperature was 55 °C or 65 °C, a cubic CdS phase was obtained, and the XRD pattern was consistent with ICCD card no. 89-0440. Heating at 75 °C significantly reduced the peak intensity of CdS phase. However, no diffraction peaks were observed when the reaction temperature was increased to 85 °C because CdS films that then formed on the glass substrates were insufficiently thick. This indicates the high reaction temperatures caused unfavorable formation for the deposition of CdS on the substrate, and reduced the XRD diffraction intensity of CdS films. On the other hand, the low XRD intensity may also results from the formation of amorphous CdS phase. This phenomenon will be discussed later.

Fig. 3 shows scanning electron micrographs of the prepared CdS films coated on soda-lime glass. When the reaction temperature was 55 °C (Fig. 3(a)), continuous CdS films were obtained on the soda-lime glass. Increasing the reaction temperature at 65 °C caused small holes to be formed (Fig. 3(b)). Elevating the reaction temperature at 75 °C increased the number of these small holes (Fig. 3(c)). Heating at 85 °C made the morphology of the prepared films non-continuous, and caused small particles to be randomly deposited on the soda-lime glass (Fig. 3(d)). The inset in Fig. 3 shows the cross-sectional images of the prepared CdS films on soda-lime glass. As the temperature was raised from 55 °C to 85 °C, the thickness of the films decreased from 65.8 nm to 39.5 nm, revealing that increasing the temperature of the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition reduced the thickness of the prepared films.

3.2 Effects of heating temperatures on the crystalline phase and microstructures of microwave-prepared CdS films on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 substrates
To prepare Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells, CdS films were coated on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers. The corresponding scanning electron micrographs are shown in Fig. 4. After the deposition at 55 °C, the continuous CdS films were formed on the surface of Cu(In,Ga)Se2, as shown in Fig. 4(a) Heating at 65 °C produced films with a few holes (Fig. 4(b)). Further increasing the reaction temperature to 75 °C increased the number of holes (Fig. 4(c)). Increasing the temperature to 85 °C produced many large holes (Fig. 4(d)). The inset in Fig. 4 presents cross-sectional images of CdS films that were coated on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films at different temperatures and the measured thickness. The thickness of the films decreased from 69.0 nm to 41.4 nm as the heating temperature was increased from 55 °C to 85 °C.

Inset: the cross-section images of the corresponding CdS films on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers. 
To determine the cause of the decrease in CdS film thickness with increasing temperature, the UV-vis spectra of CdS residual solutions obtained after the microwave-assisted process were analyzed. Fig. 5 shows the transmittance of the residual CdS suspension prepared at various temperatures. When the temperature was increased from 55 °C to 85 °C, the average transmittance fell greatly from 70.1% to 57.4%. The insets in Fig. 5 show the photographs of the corresponding residual solutions, which became concentrated as the reaction temperature increased, implying that the number of CdS particles in the residual solutions also increased. The above results indicate that a high reaction temperature facilitated the precipitation of CdS particles in the bulk solution.

Therefore, it can be possible that increasing the reaction temperature reduced the thickness of the prepared CdS films and the film coverage, while facilitating precipitation in the bulk solution owing to competition between nucleation in the bulk solution and that on the substrates of CdS. In chemical bath deposition, two main mechanisms of precipitation are considered to form CdS films.17 One mechanism is homogeneous nucleation, and the other is heterogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation takes place in the bulk solution, whereas heterogeneous nucleation occurs on the surface of the substrates and the reaction container. In the homogeneous nucleation of CdS films using cadmium salts, thiourea, and ammonia, the reaction mechanism is as follows.18 
NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH−
(1) 
Cd2+ + NH3 ↔ Cd(NH3)42+
(2) 
SC(NH2)2 + 2OH− → S2− + 2H2O + CH2N2
(3) 
Cd2+ + S2− → CdS(s)
(4)
In the bulk solution, cadmium ions are chelated with amino ions and sulfur ions are released after the decomposition of thiourea. Then, cadmium ions react with sulfur ions to form CdS. According to the above reaction mechanism, the decomposition of thiourea is important in the preparation CdS.
The reaction mechanism of the heterogeneous nucleation of CdS deposited on the substrates and the reaction container is as follows.18 
Cd2+ + 2OH− + site → [Cd(OH)2](ads)
(5) 
[Cd(OH)2](ads) + SC(NH2)2 → C*
(6) 
C* → CdS + CN2H2 + 2H2O + site
(7)where C* is a reaction intermediate. Initially, Cd2+ ions react with hydroxide ions at the activated sites on the surface of the substrates to form Cd(OH)2. Then, thiourea reacts with Cd(OH)2 that is adsorbed on the surface to form CdS films. Therefore, the reaction of thiourea and Cd(OH)2 on the surface is a critical step in the preparation of CdS films.
The Gibbs free energy that is required for heterogeneous nucleation is reportedly lower than that required for homogeneous nucleation owing to the low interfacial area and interfacial free energy between the droplets and the surrounding solution.19,20 On the other hand, microwave heating induces the decomposition of thiourea, releasing S2− ions to facilitate the formation of CdS films on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface. Therefore, the rate of heterogeneous nucleation exceeds that of homogeneous nucleation at low reaction temperatures. Consequently, thick and dense CdS films were formed at a reaction temperature of 55 °C.
As the reaction temperature is increased, high reaction temperatures further accelerate the decomposition of thiourea, with the release of many sulfur ions in the bulk solution.21 Increasing the concentration of sulfur ions also increases the growth rate of CdS particles in the bulk solution.22 The homogeneous reaction depletes the reactants in the solution, reducing the thickness of the formed CdS films.
3.3 Effects of heating temperatures on the optical properties of microwave-prepared CdS films
The UV-vis spectra of CdS films that were prepared via the microwave-assisted CBD process at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 6. The transmittance edge was observed in the spectra of all of the prepared films owing to the band gap of CdS. Elevating the reaction temperature increased the transmittance of the prepared CdS films by reducing the thickness, as displayed in Fig. 4. According to the transmittance results, the absorption coefficient satisfies the equation,23 
(8)where α is the absorption coefficient, d denotes the thickness of the films, and T is the transmittance of the films. The band gap of a prepared film can be obtained from the absorption coefficient according to the equation,24 
(9)where hν is the photon energy, k is a constant, and Eg denotes the band gap. The inset in Fig. 6 plots (αhν)2 versus photon energy. According to eqn (2), the band gap is obtained by setting (αhν)2 equal to zero. The band gap of the prepared CdS materials was calculated to be 2.4 eV, which is consistent with the values in the literature.25,26

3.4 Effects of heating temperatures on the photovoltaic properties of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells with the microwave-prepared CdS films
Fig. 7 plots the I–V curves of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells fabricated with CdS films prepared at various temperatures. Elevating the reaction temperature decreases Voc and Jsc. As the reaction temperature was increased from 55 °C to 85 °C, Voc was significantly decreased from 0.574 V to 0.112 V, and Jsc was declined from 32.5 mA cm−2 to 21.1 mA cm−2. The conversion efficiency can be obtained according to the following equation. 
(10)where FF is the fill factor and Pin is the incident light power. FF is defined as the ratio of the ideal maximum generated power to the real value, as follows. 
(11)where Pmax is the real maximum generated power. Table 1 presents the fill factor and conversion efficiency. The values of FF and η decreased as the reaction temperature increased. As the reaction temperature was raised from 55 °C to 85 °C, FF decreased from 55.0% to 25.5%, and the conversion efficiency was significantly decreased from 10.2% to 0.60%.

The measured current density in the illuminated solar cells satisfies the following equation.27 
(12)where J is the measured current density, J0 is the saturated current, Jsc is the short-circuit current, Rs is the series resistance, A is the diode factor, G is the shunt capacitance, V is the voltage applied across the cells, q is the electronic charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The shunt conductance is obtained from dJ/dV in the reverse bias zone to calculate J′ = J − GV. The relationship between V and J′ is obtained from eqn (12) with RsG ≪ 1. 
(13)
Differentiating V in eqn (13) with respect to J′ yields the equation, 
(14)
The values of Rs and the diode factor (A) were derived from the intercept and the slope of a plot of dV/dJ′ versus (J′ + Jsc)−1, according to eqn (14). Eqn (13) can be rewritten as follows to express the relationship between ln(J′ + Jsc) and V − RsJ′. 
(15)
The value of J0 of an illuminated solar cell can be calculated from the intercept of the plot of ln(J′ + Jsc) versus V − RsJ′, according to eqn (15).28
The diode parameters were derived from the above equations and are summarized in Fig. 8. Upon increasing the reaction temperature for the formation of CdS buffer layers from 55 °C to 85 °C, Rs decreased from 0.95 Ω cm2 to 0.45 Ω cm2. The decrease in the Rs value is attributed to the decrease in the thickness of CdS film. The G value increased from 13.1 mS cm−2 to 168.9 mS cm−2 as the reaction temperature was increased from 55 °C to 85 °C, owing to the insufficient coverage by CdS buffer layers that were prepared at high temperature, as shown in Fig. 4. The incompletely covered Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface is supposed to have been damaged by the ion bombardment during the deposition of i-ZnO window layers in the sputtering process, forming the defects.29 These defects form the shunt paths and capture the photogenerated electrons, increasing the shunt conductance of CdS films that were prepared at high reaction temperatures.

The diode factor increased from 1.73 to 6.97 as the reaction temperature was increased from 55 °C to 85 °C, as seen in Fig. 8(c). The value of A can be used to elucidate the electron–hole recombination mechanism in solar cells.30,31 When the value of A is close to one, recombination occurs mostly in the neutral region. When A is around two, the recombination occurs mainly in the depletion region. As A exceeds two, the additional recombination associated with shunt paths should be considered. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the values of A increased significantly with the reaction temperature, implying that shunt paths became responsible for most of the electron–hole recombination in the prepared solar cells. This change in the recombination mechanism is attributed to the defects that formed on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface. The J0 value was found to be significantly increased from 7.98 × 10−5 mA cm−2 to 0.218 mA cm−2 as the reaction temperature was increased from 55 °C to 85 °C, as seen in Fig. 8(d). The J0 value is considered to be related to the leakage that is associated with the electron–hole recombination in solar cells.32 As the value of A decreased, as in Fig. 8(c), the recombination that was associated with the additional shunt paths was suppressed, reducing the corresponding leakage and J0 value.
Fig. 9 presents the room-temperature PL spectra of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films that were covered with CdS films prepared at different temperatures. The peak at 1.02 eV is considered to have resulted from the free-to-bound transition that was associated with the vacancies formed in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 films.33 The peak intensity decreased significantly as the reaction temperature increased from 55 °C to 85 °C. According to the literature, the defects on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface caused surface electron–hole recombination and reduced the intensity of photoluminescence that was associated with the free-to-bound transitions.34 The formation of CdS buffer layers on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers reduced the number of defects on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface, suppressing surface electron–hole recombination and increasing the intensity of photoluminescence by free-to-bound transitions.34,35 At a reaction temperature of 55 °C, CdS films completely covered Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface, so few defects were present thereon, and the surface electron–hole recombination was minimal, favoring intense photoluminescence. Increasing the reaction temperature resulted in the formation of voids in the prepared CdS films and a partially uncovered Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface. Therefore, the uncovered parts of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface exhibited surface defects, and the intensity of photoluminescence was reduced accordingly.

Fig. 10 plots the external quantum efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells that fabricated with CdS films with excitation by light with wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 1250 nm. When the reaction temperature was 55 °C, a maximum EQE of around 80% was observed. As the reaction temperature was increased, the obtained EQE slightly decreased. With further increasing the temperature to 85 °C significantly reduced the EQE of the prepared cells to around 52%. The EQE of a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell is proportional to its Jsc value. The decrease in EQE with increasing temperature is consistent with the Jsc data in Table 1. The above results reveal that CdS buffer layers successfully covered Cu(In,Ga)Se2 surface at 55 °C, suppressing recombination that would otherwise have been caused by the shunt paths and improving the photovoltaic properties of the prepared solar cells. This work provides evidence that a conversion efficiency of over 10% can be achieved using CdS layers that are prepared via the microwave-assisted CBD process.

4. Conclusions
CdS buffer layers were successfully prepared on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber layers via the microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process. The duration of the reaction to obtain the dense CdS films was as short as 4 min. The thickness of the prepared CdS films significantly decreased as the reaction temperature was raised. As the reaction temperature was increased, the major nucleation mechanism changed from heterogeneous nucleation to homogeneous nucleation, reducing the thickness of the prepared CdS films. The photovoltaic properties became worse as the reaction temperature increased. The Voc, Jsc, and FF of CdS buffer layers that were prepared at 55 °C were measured to be 0.574 V, 32.46 mA cm−2, and 54.96%, respectively, and a conversion efficiency of 10.24% was achieved. Increasing the reaction temperature significantly worsened the shunt conductance, the diode factor, and the saturated current that was associated with the shunt paths, owing to insufficient coverage of CdS films. The microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition process was demonstrated to have potential for preparing CdS buffer layers for use in high-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells.
