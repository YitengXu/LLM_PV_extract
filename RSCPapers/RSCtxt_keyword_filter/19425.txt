    , Accepted 3rd July 2019First published on 4th July 2019AbstractNon-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) have earned widespread attention on account of their distinct advantages, such as low-cost solution processability, tunable energy levels and suitability for large-scale production. Herein, a series of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives with different sizes of side and terminal groups are developed and used as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) for conventional non-fullerene polymer solar cells. The regulation of molecular structures can change the film morphology and improve the device performance. Taking PDI-NBr without a side group as the reference, the device modified with P3P-NBr bearing m-terphenyl as the side group shows much increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 46% (7.14% versus 10.46%). Moreover, once the terminal group changes to amino N-oxide (NO), PSC based on P1P-NO with a suitable side group displays the champion PCE of 11.56% and much improved stability, providing a new method to optimize the interfacial materials for non-fullerene PSCs.
1 Introduction
Due to the advantages of low cost, flexibility, convenient fabrication and suitability for large-scale production, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in recent years.1–6 Thanks to the efforts of scientists, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 15% in single-junction binary devices and surpassing 17% in tandem devices has been achieved.7,8 Although the efficiency is constantly increasing, it still lags far behind the requirement of industrialized production. PSCs are usually made of an active layer that is a blend of a polymer donor with a fullerene or non-fullerene acceptor, sandwiched by two cathode and anode interfacial layers. Generally, the device efficiency can be improved by optimizing the photoactive layer, device structure, and fabrication process.9–12 In addition, interfacial engineering is also an effective strategy for realizing good device performance, due to some advantages of interfacial materials, including compatible ohmic contact, matched energy levels between the photoactive layer and the electrode, and improved selectivity towards electrons or holes while blocking others.13–15 In comparison with inorganic metal salts such as LiF, Cs2CO3 and CsF, water/alcohol soluble organic cathode interfacial materials display some unique properties: convenient room-temperature solution processability, adjustable energy levels and excellent stability.16 So far, many water/alcohol soluble cathode interfacial materials have been reported with much enhanced PCEs over the control devices. For example, Cao and coworkers reported an inverted polymer solar cell by using PFN as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL) with a PCE of 9.2% in 2012; Li and coworkers developed two cathode interfacial materials with perylene diimide (PDI) as the core and amino (PDI-N) or amino N-oxide (PDI-NO) as the terminal group, and an efficiency of 8.35% was achieved by the device modified with PDI-NO in 2014; Peng and coworkers synthesized a series of star-shaped CILs comprising triphenylamine and fluorene units with a PCE exceeding 10% in 2016.17–19
On the other hand, the packing status of π systems in aggregation states badly affects the related optoelectronic properties, as proved by the recent hot topics of purely organic room temperature phosphorescent luminogens and mechanoluminescence as typical examples.20–24 The same phenomena have also been reported in devices of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).25–27 In our previous work, the device performance of PSCs can be tuned by the different molecular packing of interfacial materials with similar molecular structures.28 Thus, considering the above mentioned literature reports, is it possible to deeply understand the influence of molecular packing on PSCs? Taking the commonly used PDI as an example, if the packing status of PDI in the CIL films could be adjusted through reasonable chemical modification, the corresponding PSCs might achieve better performance due to the optimized film morphology.
Prompted by the above points, and based on our systematic works of π systems bearing a “Suitable Isolation Group”,29–31 in this manuscript, we introduced the side groups of phenyl (Ph), biphenyl (BPh), m-terphenyl (DPP) and tetraphenylethene (TPE) with gradually increased sizes into the bay position of PDI-N to tune the flat structure of PDI derivatives, termed as P1P-N, P2P-N, P3P-N and P4P-N (Chart 1). Through the ionization of the PDI-N series, the PDI-NBr derivatives were synthesized with different terminal groups (Chart 1). As expected, their molecular conformation, packing status and film morphology have changed greatly as shown by theoretical calculations, SEM and XRD characterization. Subsequently, a donor material (J71) and a non-fullerene acceptor material (ITIC) as the photoactive layers were selected, together with the PDI-N and PDI-NBr series as the cathode interlayers, to fabricate conventional architecture devices. The performance of the devices rose first and then fell in the series of PDI-N or PDI-NBr CILs with the enlarged sizes of the side groups, and the trend of the PDI-NBr series was more obvious. Taking PDI-NBr as the reference, the device modified with P3P-NBr interlayer shows much improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 46% (7.14% versus 10.46%) with largely increased open circuit voltage (Voc), circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), demonstrating the importance of adjusting molecular structures and the related packing status. To further verify this point, the PDI-NO series were designed by changing the terminal groups to amino N-oxide. Through the adjustment of the side groups, P1P-NO exhibits the champion PCE of 11.56%. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency of the P1P-NO based PSC can retain 88% of the initial value after 400 h under an atmosphere of nitrogen, much more stable than that of PDI-NO (50%). Thus, the modification of molecular packing can not only improve the device efficiency, but also enhance the stability, presenting an efficient method to develop cathode interfacial materials for large-scale industrial production of non-fullerene polymer solar cells.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
Perylene diimide (PDI), which possesses a very bulky and planar molecular structure, exhibits relatively high electron affinity, high electron mobility and excellent chemical, thermal, and photochemical stability.32–34 Its derivatives have been widely researched for optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), dye lasers, and optical switches.35–38 Also, they can be used as non-fullerene acceptors and cathode interfacial materials in polymer solar cells.39–42 However, PDI tends to aggregate into excessively sized crystalline domains during the solution casting process because of the strong π–π stacking between PDI planes, which will result in poor film-formation ability and is unsuitable for high-performance photoelectric devices.43,44
Herein, it was expected that the introduction of the side groups of phenyl (Ph), biphenyl (BPh), m-terphenyl (DPP) and tetraphenylethene (TPE) with gradually increased sizes into PDI-N's bay position could change the flat structure of the PDIs and regulate the aggregation states. The molecular structures and synthetic routes of these cathode interfacial materials are shown in Chart 1, while the complete experimental details are presented in the ESI.† The compounds of the PDI-N series including PDI-N, P1P-N, P2P-N, P3P-N and P4P-N are soluble in chloroform and strongly polar solvents such as DMSO, DMF, and methanol with the assistance of acetic acid (3% in volume). Compounds from P1P-N to P4P-N were modified by a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of PDIN-2Br and corresponding boric acids or boric esters (Chart 1). Subsequently, the five neutral compounds of the PDI-N series were reacted with excess bromoethane to yield the quaternary ammonium-functionalized PDI-NBr series composed of PDI-NBr, P1P-NBr, P2P-NBr, P3P-NBr and P4P-NBr. All the compounds of the PDI-N and PDI-NBr series were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectra (HRMS) analyses. The PDI-NBr series are soluble in pure methanol solution for the polar ionic groups, making them possible to be used as the cathode interfacial layers for an orthogonal solvent process in PSCs. Moreover, the methanol treatment was proved to be an efficient method to significantly improve the Voc and FF of the solar cell devices,45 favoring the excellent photovoltaic performance. Also, they exhibited good photo-stability and thermal-stability. During continuous irradiation for 1 h, their fluorescence intensities exhibited nearly no change (Fig. S1, ESI†). In thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2, ESI†), the decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of PDI-NBr, P1P-NBr, P2P-NBr, P3P-NBr and P4P-NBr were 247.4 °C, 232.2 °C, 230.3 °C, 227.3 °C and 216.0 °C, respectively, which ensured their application in PSCs as cathode interfacial layers under possible high temperature conditions.
2.2 Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of these water/alcohol soluble conjugated small molecules (WSCSMs) in solution were measured (Fig. 1a and Fig. S3a, ESI†), while those of the film states are presented in Fig. 1b and Fig. S3b (ESI†), with the relevant data summarized in Table 1. In films, the PDI-NBr series demonstrate an absorption peak at 490, 534, 561, 563 and 631 nm respectively, which should be attributed to the characteristic π–π* transitions. With the increased sizes of the side groups, their absorption peaks exhibited significant red-shift as a result of the enlargement of the molecular conjugate length. Compared to their absorption in methanol, PDI-NBr and P1P-NBr films show a slightly blue-shifted absorption and a new shoulder peak appears at 563 or 580 nm, respectively (Fig. S5a and b, ESI†). However, the absorption of P3P-NBr and P4P-NBr films exhibits a significant red-shift with no obvious new peaks (Fig. S5d and e, ESI†). The discrepancies may be ascribed to the varied aggregation states of PDI derivatives with different molecular structures.46 Compared to the PDI-N series, the PDI-NBr series exhibit similar absorption in methanol solution, while their solid films show prominent red-shift and broader peaks, meaning lower optical bandgaps. This may be due to the anion–π interactions between the bromine anion and the electron deficient PDI core.47

The fluorescence properties of the PDI-NBr series in methanol also display big differences with enlarged sizes of the side groups (Fig. S6, ESI†). Their emission peaks exhibit obvious red-shifts with increased sizes of the side groups, and the corresponding quantum yields decreased from 60.61% to 1.92%, mainly due to the increased number of rotators and the more twisted molecular configuration by steric hindrance.48
2.3 Electrochemical properties
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of these PDI derivatives were calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. S7a and b, ESI†), and summarized in Table 1. Under the same experimental conditions, the potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was recorded to be 0.51 V with respect to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Fig. S7c, ESI†). The PDI-NBr series displayed two distinct oxidation potentials of the bromine anion at 0.69 and 1.00 V, which were consistent with literature reports49 and verified by CV measurement of tetrabutylammonium bromide under the same conditions (Fig. S7d, ESI†). The PDI-NBr series show similar LUMO values at about −3.75 eV, which are very close to that of ITIC (−3.84 eV), favoring electron transfer from the active layer to the metal cathode. Moreover, their HOMO levels are all low enough to block holes from the active layer, and increase with enlarged sizes of the side groups, mainly related to the enlargement of the conjugated system.50 The bandgaps decrease with the increased sizes of the side groups, similar to that of their optical bandgaps. In comparison with the PDI-N series, the PDI-NBr series displays a slight higher HOMO level, possibly due to the anion–π interactions of the bromine anion and the electron deficient PDI core.
2.4 Theoretical calculations
The optimized geometries of the PDI-NBr series were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) using Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G* level (Table S1, ESI†). The dihedral angles between the PDI core and the side groups were 54.1°, 53.59°, 56.65° and 60.43° for P1P-NBr–P4P-NBr, respectively, meaning that PDI derivatives become more distorted with increased sizes of the side groups. Accordingly, these stereo geometries can hinder intermolecular π–π stacking for the PDI plane effectively by steric hindrance, resulting in the varied aggregation status and film morphologies.51
2.5 Electron paramagnetic resonance study
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) that provided reliable evidence for the formation of radical anions was conducted to investigate their self-doping behaviors.52,53 The PDI-N and PDI-NBr series were tested in solid states under the same conditions (Fig. S8, ESI†). PDI-N and P3P-N show distinct EPR signals among the PDI-N series, and P1P-NBr, P2P-NBr and P3P-NBr exhibit obvious EPR signals among the PDI-NBr series with very similar g-values. These results indicate that electrons can transfer from the amine groups or bromide ions to the electron deficient PDI moieties to generate PDI radical anions, which are conducive to electron transport of the interfacial layer, thus possibly insensitive to the thicknesses of CILs.54,55
2.6 Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the performance of these new WSCSMs in non-fullerene PSCs, the conventional devices were fabricated with the configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/J71:ITIC/interlayer/Al with PDI-based cathode interfacial layers. Fig. 1c shows the related energy level diagram, while the device architectures of the conventional PSCs and the molecular structures of the active materials are demonstrated in Fig. 1d. Fig. 2a and c present the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of optimized PSCs with PDI-based interlayers, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device without the interfacial layer was fabricated as the control one. Also, the device with solvent treatment of methanol was fabricated to eliminate the influence of solvent. PSCs with the PDI-N and PDI-NBr series CILs display improved photovoltaic performance by the introduction of side groups. As shown in Fig. 2d, with the enlarged sizes of the side groups, it is clearly seen that the conversion efficiencies of the corresponding PSCs increase first and then fall slightly, and this trend is more obvious in the PDI-NBr series. Under the optimal conditions, the device modified with P3P-NBr exhibits the best photovoltaic performance: an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.941 V, a circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.47 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 67.48%, and a noticeable PCE of 10.46%, which improves the PCE by 46% (7.14% versus 10.46%) with largely increased Voc, Jsc and FF in comparison with those of PDI-NBr. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on the PDI-NBr and PDI-N series are shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S9 (ESI†), respectively, and the integration Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves match well with those measured from J–V curves with 5% error in the range of 300–800 nm.

With the aim to further understand the interfacial property of the corresponding organic devices, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) values for PDI-NBr series devices were calculated from the J–V curves under illumination (Table 2). The lowest Rs value of P3P-NBr (7.11 Ω cm2) indicated the best ohmic contact at the interfaces of active layer/P3P-NBr/Al, which was beneficial for charge transport and extraction. Also, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to examine the interface resistance (Fig. S10, ESI†). A bias voltage equal to Voc was applied to dissipate the total current and the data were fitted using the equivalent-circuit model (Table S2, ESI†).45 The surface resistances (Rsurface) of the devices modified with PDI-NBr, P1P-NBr, P2P-NBr, P3P-NBr and P4P-NBr layers were estimated to be 1220, 307.9, 290.1, 75.52 and 961.8 Ω cm2, respectively. The smallest Rsurface for the P3P-NBr device indicates the reduced charge recombination and improved charge extraction, which is consistent with the trend of the J–V curves in the dark. As shown in Fig. 3a, except for the PDI-NBr device, the J–V curves of devices modified with the PDI-NBr series are greatly suppressed, compared to the bare Al control device in the region from −2 to 0 V, and the P3P-NBr device displays the smallest reverse leakage current. It could improve charge selectivity and hole-blocking properties at the cathode interface, giving rise to relatively high FF and Jsc value.

Hole and electron mobility of the devices based on the PDI-NBr series were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.56 The structure of an electron-only device is glass/ITO/ZnO/J71:ITIC/interlayer/Al, while that for the hole-only devices it is glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J71:ITIC/interlayer/MoOx/Ag, and the related J–V curves are presented in Fig. 3b and Fig. S11a (ESI†), respectively. The electron mobility (μe), hole mobility (μh) and μe/μh values are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The electron and hole transfer in these PDI-NBr series based devices can be balanced efficiently, as proved by the improved μe/μh values, resulting in the enhanced FF values. The electron mobility of the devices with PDI-based cathode interfacial layers is significantly increased compared to that without the interlayer. The higher electron mobility can promote the transfer of electrons from the active layer to the metal electrode, and then enhance the Jsc of the device. The electron mobility histograms of PSCs based on the PDI-NBr series are displayed in Fig. S11b (ESI†). It varied much with the incorporation of different side groups in the interfacial materials, and exhibited a trend of increasing firstly and then decreasing slightly with the increased sizes of the side groups. The mobility of P3P-NBr is the highest with μe value of 3.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is in accordance with the trend of their circuit current density, and may be related to their film morphology and molecular packing.
In order to learn more about molecular stacking conformation of the interlayers, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to investigate the thin films on a silicon substrate. As shown in Fig. 3c, PDI-NBr shows three obvious diffraction peaks at about 5.4°, 7.9° and 15.1° with interlayer distances of 16.35 Å, 11.18 Å and 5.85 Å, respectively, indicating the compact π-planar packing structure. P1P-NBr and P4P-NBr have two relatively weak diffraction peaks at 4.9°, 12.08° and 18.5°, 20.34° with interlayer distances of 18.02 Å, 7.32 Å and 4.79 Å, 4.36 Å, respectively. While nearly no obvious diffraction peaks can be found in P2P-NBr and P3P-NBr curves, indicating that the related films may be in the amorphous state. To further verify this phenomenon, the XRD patterns of their powders were measured (Fig. S12, ESI†), the diffraction peaks of PDI-NBr and P4P-NBr are more obvious as powders, but the general trend remains the same, confirming that the stacking pattern has changed largely by regulating the molecular structures.26
Besides, with the aim to explore the impact of the interlayer on the Al electrode, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted. Fig. 3d presents the UPS spectra of the bare Al electrode and the PDI-NBr series modified Al electrode. The work function (WF) value of the bare Al electrode is 4.25 eV, which can be defined by the secondary electron cut-off and is in accordance with that in literature reports.57 After the deposition of the PDI-NBr series onto the Al electrodes, the WF values decrease dramatically for PDI-NBr, P1P-NBr, P2P-NBr, P3P-NBr and P4P-NBr with the work function values of 3.79, 3.7, 3.58, 3.84 and 3.6 eV, respectively. It may be due to the formation of favorable interfacial dipoles between PDI-based interlayers and the Al electrode surface, contributing to the electron transport and extraction.57,58 Also, the lower WFs of cathodes could increase the built-in potential of PSCs, which is the basic reason for the enhancement of Voc.16
Also, the water contact angle (θ) measurement is an efficient way to get more information about the interfacial changes after the modification with CILs. A contact angle of 106.2° was observed for the bare active layer, suggesting that the surface was relatively hydrophobic (Fig. 3e), and it could lead to a poor contact with the hydrophilic Al electrode. After treatment with methanol, the hydrophilicity improved a little with a contact angle of 104.7° (Fig. S25a, ESI†). However, the surfaces were significantly changed by the treatment of the PDI-NBr series, and the contact angles were reduced to 93.6°, 86.2°, 48.6°, 59.3° and 61.0°, respectively (Fig. 3f–j). Among them, the lower values of P2P-NBr and P3P-NBr indicate their more hydrophilic property. This is beneficial for the formation of strong interfacial dipoles on the electrode surface, directly decreasing the work function of the metal electrode. Also, better ohmic contacts with the active layer can be formed, which is consistent with the results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS) and the dark J–V curves, facilitating the electron transport and collection, then to the higher Jsc and FF values.
To get a deeper insight into the thin film morphology of the interlayer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted. When the film thickness is about 10 nm, there are no obvious differences in the films of the PDI-NBr series (Fig. S13a–e, ESI†). However, once the thickness increases to about 30 nm, as shown in Fig. S13f–j (ESI†), the PDI-NBr image presents obvious cracks. This should be reasonable, since the intermolecular interactions of the planar PDI core are too strong to form a high quality film. While P1P-NBr and P2P-NBr have no cracks, they present crystalline shapes in different degrees. P3P-NBr and P4P-NBr show the uniform and smooth film according to the SEM image. This can facilitate electron transport, and also slow down the diffusion of metal electrodes to the active layer, resulting in the improved device stability.59,60
The morphologies of the J71:ITIC film were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of the pristine active layer is about 1.13 nm (Fig. 4a). After treatment with methanol, the RMS roughness decreases slightly to 1.09 nm (Fig. S26a, ESI†). The surfaces become much smoother after the introduction of PDI-NBr series interlayers, resulting in better contacts between the metal electrode and the active layer. The detailed RMS values of the PDI-NBr series are 0.93, 0.78, 0.75, 0.99 and 0.95 nm, respectively (Fig. 4b–f). The RMS value of P3P-NBr is not the smallest one, however, the high electron mobility as mentioned above afforded a significant contribution, resulting in the excellent photovoltaic performance.

PDI-NO is an efficient cathode interfacial material containing perylene diimide as the core and amino N-oxide as the terminal substituent, which has been applied successfully to polymer solar cells with high conversion efficiency up to 11.77%.9,18,61 Combined with the positive effect of side groups as mentioned above, the conversion efficiency of PDI-NO treated PSCs should be further increased by introducing suitable side groups. Therefore, the PDI-NO series with different sizes of the side groups were designed and synthesized (Fig. 5a), and applied to the same conventional device with J71:ITIC as the active layer. The J–V curves of all devices and the related device parameters are shown in Fig. 5b and Table 3. The EQE curves of the devices based on the PDI-NO series were consistent with those measured from J–V curves (Fig. S19, ESI†). PSC modified with P1P-NO bearing phenyl as the side group shows the champion PCE of 11.56% with a Voc of 0.940 V, a Jsc of 17.47 mA cm−2 and an FF of 70.35%. To further investigate the possible mechanism for the improved performance by a side group, a series of measurements were conducted. In the EPR experiment, P1P-NO displays a strong EPR signal, while the signal of PDI-NO is very weak (Fig. 5c). Also, it exhibited the lowest Rs value and reverse leakage current (Table 3 and Fig. S20, ESI†). Besides, in comparison with PDI-NO, P1P-NO possesses a higher electron mobility, smaller contact angle and smoother film morphology as verified by SCLC, water contact angle, AFM and SEM measurements, which are beneficial for improving the photovoltaic performance with high Jsc and FF values. However, The performance trend of the PDI-NO series with increased sizes of the side groups is a little different from the above PDI-N and PDI-NBr ones, possibly due to the poor solubility of P2P-NO, P3P-NO and P4P-NO, as proved by the obvious particles in the SEM images (Fig. S27, ESI†). This means that something precipitated during the film-forming process, possibly resulting in the poor electron transporting ability.

With respect to the large-scale printable process, the dependence of device performance on the interlayer thicknesses was investigated by spin-coating the methanol solution of P1P-NO with different concentrations onto the active layer. The J–V curves of all devices and the related device parameters are presented in Fig. S28 and Table S8 (ESI†). The PCEs of the devices modified with P1P-NO can remain about 88% at the thickness of 19 nm, and 77% at the thickness of 42 nm. Also, the device stability is crucial to the practical application of PSCs, the long-term stability of the devices modified with PDI-NO and P1P-NO were carried out in an atmosphere of nitrogen without encapsulation (H2O < 10 ppm, O2 < 10 ppm). The curves of normalized PCEs versus time of devices with PDI-NO and P1P-NO are shown in Fig. 5d. Notably, the device modified with P1P-NO exhibits a much better stability with 88% of the initial PCE retained after 400 h, while the PCE of the PDI-NO device drops to 50%. As shown in Fig. S29 (ESI†), the much more slowly decayed FF values of P1P-NO are a major factor for the stable device performance. This is reasonable, as compared to the obvious cracks in the PDI-NO film, the P1P-NO film is uniform and smooth, which can effectively slow down the diffusion of the metal atoms of electrodes to improve the stability of the device.
3 Conclusions
In summary, we developed a series of PDI derivatives with different sizes of side and terminal groups, which were applied in non-fullerene polymer solar cells as the cathode interfacial layers. As the steric resistance of PDI derivatives increases with the enlarged sizes of the side groups, the severe intermolecular π–π stacking can be hindered largely. This can adjust the aggregation status of interfacial materials, so as to optimize the film morphology and photovoltaic performance. Among the PDI-NBr series, P3P-NBr with a mesoscale side group exhibited the optimized molecular packing with high electron mobility and improved film morphology; accordingly, the corresponding device shows the best power conversion efficiency of 10.46%, which increases by 46% (7.14% versus 10.46%) in comparison with that of PDI-NBr without a side group. Thus, the high CIL quality film could benefit further improvement of device performance. Furthermore, P1P-NO with a suitable side group exhibits the champion PCE of 11.56% among the PDI-NO series, together with the insensitivity to the film thickness and much enhanced long-term stability. This finding opens up a new avenue to improve the device performance of photovoltaic solar cells by modifying molecular packing of organic interfacial materials with the adjustable molecular configurations.
