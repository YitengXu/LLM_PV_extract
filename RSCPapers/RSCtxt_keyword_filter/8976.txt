    , Accepted 13th February 2017First published on 13th February 2017AbstractSince there are still challenges in fabricating high-quality large-area perovskite films, perovskite solar cells have limitations for industrial application. Here, we develop a material nucleation/growth competition theory to guide us to tune the nucleation and grain growth process of perovskite. Subsequently, we introduce a gas-flow-induced gas pump approach for the large-area deposition of dense, uniform and full-coverage perovskite films, and this process is simple with high manufacturing efficiency and a wide process window. This enabled us to fabricate uniform perovskite films on substrates with the largest area of up to 144 cm2. Normal planar perovskite solar cells were fabricated at pressures of 100 Pa, 500 Pa and 1500 Pa, achieving average efficiencies of 19.25 ± 0.50%, 19.17 ± 0.46% and 18.98 ± 0.51% respectively for 0.1 cm2 devices (84 devices in total) with ultrahigh reproducibility. A high fill factor of up to 80% was obtained at different pressures. A champion cell with an efficiency of 20.44% was obtained which is one of the highest efficiencies for normal planar perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, we achieved an efficiency of 17.03%, the highest efficiency for normal perovskite solar cells with the device area exceeding 1 cm2 and an average efficiency of 15.63 ± 0.80% with an area of 1.1275 cm2 (for 30 devices).
1. Introduction
Since the first demonstration of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in 2009 (ref. 1) in the research field of photovoltaics, within a short period of time, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has boosted up to 22.1%.2 The excellent performance of PSCs can be attributed to the broad-band absorption, high charge carrier mobility and long electron–hole diffusion length of organometallic halide perovskite materials (e.g., APbX3, where A = FA or MA and X = Cl, Br, or I).3,4 Photovoltaic cells based on perovskite materials will have a bright industrial application prospect due to their low-cost precursor materials, simple solution processing and ultrahigh efficiency.5
Such high-efficiency PSCs were almost always based on a small device area of about 0.1 cm2 or even smaller6–10 which caused the problem that it was hard to measure their efficiency accurately. Besides, small device area ignored series resistance such as caused by the resistance of transparent conductive oxide films and reduced non-uniformity of perovskite films, which is one of main issue when the PSCs are turned to the market in the further.11 Therefore, it is recommended to develop large-area PSCs with an active area of more than one square centimetre compared with other established photovoltaic technologies.11–13 Up to now, the uncovered area always exists in large-area perovskite films. Perovskite films prepared by the traditional one-step solution method always show a dendritic structure, leaving large areas uncovered, which will introduce both shunting paths and weak absorption ability to destroy the final photovoltaic performance. To overcome this challenge, modified one-step solution methods based on fast solvent evaporation and rapid nucleation are usually adopted to fabricate large-area perovskite layers with a uniform, continuous and compact morphology, such as the solvent–solvent extraction method14 consisting of spin-coating, bathing in diethyl ether, drying in air and finally annealing at high temperatures up to 150 °C as well as soft-cover deposition15 using a heating bed at ultrahigh temperatures up to 210 °C to achieve fast evaporation of the solvent. Recently, there appeared a new method in which the pressure of the environment is reduced to achieve fast evaporation of the solvent named the gas pump method16,17 and also termed the vacuum flash-assisted method18 which achieved a certified PCE of 19.6% with the device area exceeding one square centimetre but with a rigid requirement of a pressure of no more than 20 Pa and having a high cost and big operational difficulty. Such a low pressure was required because only at a pressure below the saturated vapour pressure of the solvent can the solvent evaporate remarkably.
Herein, we develop a material nucleation/growth competition theory to guide us to tune the nucleation and grain growth process of perovskites, and subsequently we introduce a new method, the gas-flow-induced gas pump method (GGPM), towards the large-area fabrication of highly efficient PSCs. By using the GGPM, dense, uniform and full-coverage perovskite films were facilely fabricated within 5 s with a large pressure parameter window from 100 Pa to 1500 Pa which can achieve continuous production by a fairly simple operation. Finally, we achieved a PCE of 17.04% and an average efficiency of 15.63 ± 0.80% with an area of 1.1275 cm2 (for 30 devices) for normal planar perovskite solar cells. When the device area is reduced to 0.1 cm2, a champion cell with an efficiency of 20.44% was achieved which is one of the highest efficiencies for normal planar PSCs.9,19
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–d show the fabrication procedure of the perovskite films by using the gas-flow-induced gas pump method. First the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto a TiO2/FTO substrate to obtain a wet film. Then the substrate was transferred into the sample chamber. Opening the valve, the pump system (described in more detail in the Experimental section) with a vacuum tank which maintains a certain pressure began to pump the chamber. The solvent escaped from the solution at the low pressure and was blown far away by a strong airflow through two gas tubes at the bottom of the chamber at the same time. After 5 s, closing the valve, the airflow was continuously passed into the chamber through the gas tubes and then the chamber returned to normal atmospheric pressure. The substrate was easily taken out of the chamber. Fig. 1e depicts the effect of reducing the pressure with the gas pump on the solvent evaporation. At the low pressure maintained using the gas pump system, the DMF solvent can escape from the solution easily and spread all over the chamber. Fig. 1f depicts the effect of increasing fluidity of the solvent by passing a certain amount of gas flow over the solution on the solvent evaporation. By using the strong gas flow, the solvent molecules over the solution can be easily blown away. Therefore, if we combine gas pumping and gas blowing as shown in Fig. 1g, the solvent comes out of the solution driven by low pressure, and is swept up by the strong gas flow and finally pumped away by the gas pump system. Thus the solvent evaporation rate would be further accelerated, which results in an ultra-fast nucleation rate. Besides, after estimating the final temperature of the air in the sample chamber after opening the valve and combining this with the practical situation, we concluded that the temperature loss of the initial air can hardly influence the temperature of the sample (see ESI†).

(g) The combined effect of both gas pumping and gas flowing on the solvent evaporation. 
To further understand the effect of fast nucleation on the morphology of the perovskite film based on the GGPM, the crystal nucleation and growth process of the perovskite layer should be deeply investigated. Here we use the LaMer graph, widely used to explain the nucleation and grain growth process,20–22 to describe the concentration change of the perovskite precursor solution as a function of time at a constant and isothermal evaporation rate of the DMF solvent shown in Fig. 2a. With the evaporation of the solvent, the solution concentration reaches saturation concentration (labelled CS on the graph) at a time of t1. However there are no nuclei generated because the energy barrier needs to be overcome. Once the solution reaches a critical concentration (labelled CC on the graph) at a time of t2, many nuclei are generated and then start to grow. When the solution concentration is above the CC, new nuclei are always generated and then grow. With the solvent continuously evaporating, the solution concentration continuously increases, and as a result the nucleation rate increases. However, the solute is continuously consumed because of the crystal nucleation and growth, suppressing the increase of the solution concentration and the nucleation rate. Finally, the solution concentration decreases down to CC because of the solute consumption and the nucleation rate drops down to zero at a time of t3. Finally the nucleation is effectively stopped and the crystals keep growing as long as the solution concentration is larger than CS. According to the LaMer model described here, the crystal nucleation and growth occur almost at the same time, keeping a competitive relationship in consuming the solute. As for the perovskite precursor solution, there are large sized rod-shaped colloidal particles dispersed in a real solution.23 As shown in Fig. 2b, under the slow solvent evaporation, after the nuclei are generated, those nuclei will grow rapidly because of the large sized colloidal particles dispersed in the precursor solution, leading to fast solute consumption. Then the solution concentration in the half annular region (labelled blue zone) around the crystal drops down to CC quickly but is larger than CS. In the later stage, no more nuclei are generated on the substrate but grains will continuously grow in the region. These grains grow too fast and too large based on colloidal particles, leading to localized solute accumulation on the substrate.24,25 Therefore the perovskite film contains large sized rod-shaped grains from colloid-based growth and small grains from solution-based growth23 and bares the substrate due to the reasons of the fast crystal growth rate and few nuclei generated. Under the fast solvent evaporation shown in Fig. 2c, the solution concentration is always above CC (labelled yellow zone) in spite of the solute consumption. Thus the nuclei are generated on the substrate until there is no place left and the crystal growth time reduces remarkably. Finally the uniform grain size and full-coverage perovskite film can be obtained. Thus to fabricate a uniform and full-coverage perovskite layer, the crystal growth rate should be depressed or the number of nuclei should be increased. Based on the above analysis and the LaMer model, if the fast evaporation of the solvent is adopted, the solution concentration will be continuously maintained above CC and the nucleation rate will remarkably increase and meanwhile the grain growth time will decrease which means that there will be more nuclei as well as smaller and uniform grains. Therefore, we introduced a gas-flow-induced gas pump method which can remarkably accelerate the solvent evaporation rate due to the combined effect of reducing the pressure and increasing the fluidity of the solvent.

Fig. 3a shows the photographs of the perovskite (FA0.1MA0.9PbI3) films fabricated by the GGPM at pressures of 100 Pa, 500 Pa, 1500 Pa and 3000 Pa. It can be seen that the perovskite films deposited on the TiO2/FTO substrates are reddish-brown and transparent at a pressure of not more than 1500 Pa, but become gray when the pressure reaches 3000 Pa. The SEM images of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. 3. From the top-view and cross-view images, the perovskite films are dense, ultra-flat and fully covered when the pressure was no more than 1500 Pa. Besides the grain size was more than 500 nm because of the heat treatment at 120 °C for 20 min which could further improve the crystallinity and increase the grain size.26,27 However, when the pressure reached 3000 Pa, many pinholes/voids existed in the perovskite film and bared the substrate (Fig. 3e and i). High pressures such as 3000 Pa can't provide enough power to pump the solvent away in a second at a certain amount of flow stream, such as 360 L min−1. However, when increasing the amount of flow stream such as to 500 L min−1, at a pressure of 3000 Pa, the stronger flow stream can compensate for the power deficiency caused by the higher pressure, also resulting in the fast evaporation of the solvent. More different magnifications of the surface and cross-sectional view morphologies of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Therefore this method can significantly accelerate the evaporation rate of the solvent (e.g. DMF, DMSO and so on) with much higher pressure and a wide process window from 100 to 1500 Pa, which can be further applied to fabricate mixed perovskite films containing Cs, FA, Br, Cl and so on, as a universal approach.

Surface and cross-sectional view morphologies of the perovskite films fabricated by the GGPM on the TiO2/FTO substrates at pressures of (b and f) 100 Pa, (c and g) 500 Pa, (d and h) 1500 Pa and (e and i) 3000 Pa. 
Furthermore, the perovskite films were characterized by AFM as shown in Fig. 4a. The perovskite films were without heat treatment because it would increase the roughness of the perovskite films covering up the real uniformity of the perovskite films due to grain boundary grooving. The root-mean-square of surface roughness (RMS) of the perovskite films fabricated at pressures of 100 Pa, 500 Pa and 1500 Pa with an area of 2 × 2 μm is 4.41 nm, 5.02 nm and 4.06 nm respectively (Fig. 4a–c). With a larger area of 10 × 10 μm, the RMS is 5.84 nm, 5.88 nm and 5.86 nm respectively (ESI†). Therefore the perovskite films show almost no difference and high reproducibility with different pressures. However, at a pressure of 3000 Pa, the RMS is 32.00 nm for 2 × 2 μm (Fig. 4d) and 52.30 nm for 10 × 10 μm (Fig. S3d, ESI†). Therefore accelerating the nucleation rate and decreasing the grain growth time actually increased the uniformity and eliminated the localized solute accumulation. Fig. 4e shows the absorption intensity of perovskite films by the GGPM at pressures of 100 Pa, 500 Pa, 1500 Pa and 3000 Pa on the TiO2/FTO substrates. The results indicate that the perovskite films obtained at pressures of 100 Pa, 500 Pa and 1500 Pa showed almost the same absorption intensity. However, at 3000 Pa, the perovskite film shows lower absorption intensity because of the pinholes/voids in the perovskite film.16,18 The steady-state photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films were measured in Fig. 4f on the FTO and TiO2/FTO substrates. These films on the FTO substrates show almost the same photoluminescence spectra. However, on the TiO2/FTO substrates, clear quenching of photoluminescence emission can be observed in the spectrum compared to those on the FTO substrates, which means that the charge carriers within all the perovskite layers are extracted effectively by the TiO2 blocking layer.28,29 A perovskite film with a size of 144 cm2 was fabricated by the GGPM at a pressure of 1500 Pa (Fig. 4g), the largest perovskite film ever reported,30,31 which means that the power of such simple equipment is sufficient to produce even larger perovskite films for future commercial production.

(h) Cross-sectional view SEM image of the typical normal planar perovskite solar cell using a perovskite film fabricated by the GGPM. 
Normal planar perovskite solar cells were fabricated using perovskite films obtained by the gas-flow-induced gas pump method. Fig. 4h clearly shows the cross-view SEM image of the typical planar perovskite solar cell containing an ∼60 nm TiO2 blocking layer, ∼380 nm perovskite layer, ∼120 nm spiro-OMeTAD layer and ∼100 nm gold layer. The low and high magnification cross-view SEM images of the perovskite solar cell are shown in the ESI†. Here, a gas flow of 360 L min−1 was adopted and pressures of 100 Pa, 500 Pa, 1500 Pa and 3000 Pa were respectively tried to fabricate planar perovskite solar cells with 28 devices for every condition as shown in Fig. 5a. All the devices were measured with a 0.1 cm2 mask under a simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 under ambient conditions at a temperature of 23 °C and a relative humidity of 45–60%. The values of the PV parameters short current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and PCE of all the devices are listed in the ESI†. The average PCEs of the devices for 100 Pa, 500 Pa and 1500 Pa are 19.25 ± 0.50%, 19.17 ± 0.46 and 18.98 ± 0.51, respectively. Fig. S5a (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of four devices on a 2.5 × 2.5 cm substrate, which almost show no difference. Furthermore, from the statistical graphs of the PV parameters of the devices (Fig. 5a), minute differences are observed with the increase of pressure, which means that such dense and full-coverage perovskite films can actually realize highly efficient and highly reproducible PSCs irrespective of the pressure. Remarkably, a high fill factor of 80% is achieved at the different pressures, which might be because the low pressure can maintain a good contact interface between the perovskite film and the TiO2 blocking layer. However, devices fabricated at a pressure of 3000 Pa achieve an average PCE of 10.46 ± 1.88% and a much broader distribution of the PV parameters as shown in the statistical graph (Fig. 5a), which is owed to the incomplete coverage of the perovskite film resulting in the direct contact of the hole transport layer (HTL) and the TiO2 blocking layer as shown in the cross-view SEM image of the device (ESI†), finally leading to critical recombination of the excitons and the decrease of the PCE. Finally a champion cell was obtained at a pressure of 100 Pa with a JSC of 23.43 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1091 mV, a FF of 79.97% and a PCE of 20.44%. Hysteresis of the PSCs is a common phenomenon especially for normal planar PSCs;32,33 therefore the champion cell was measured by forward scan (FS) and reverse scan (RS) at delay times of 100 m, 500 ms and 1000 ms, respectively, at each point (Fig. 5b). Besides the champion cells fabricated at pressures of 500 Pa and 1500 Pa were also measured by forward scan and reverse scan as shown in Fig. S5b and c (ESI†). The data of PV parameters for all champion cells are listed in the ESI†. The result shows that the delay time influences forward scan efficiency mainly affecting the fill factor which corresponds with that earlier reported,34,35 but can hardly influence reverse scan efficiency. The device shows little J–V hysteresis which might be because of the introduction of HC(NH2)2+ into the perovskite film36 and the large grains with fewer defects in the perovskite films. Fig. 5c shows the IPCE of the champion cell with an integrated JSC of 22.68 mA cm−2 which is a little smaller than the JSC shown in Fig. 5b. Furthermore the output of J and PCE at the maximum power point of the champion cell was measured at a bias voltage of 0.915 V. The J stabilized at 22.12 mA cm−2 and the PCE stabilized at 20.24% for about 600 s, which can be attributed to the extreme density and the high crystallinity with large grains of the perovskite films.

To further clarify the influence of the perovskite film quality on the performance of PSCs, the typical devices based on perovskite films fabricated at pressures of 1500 Pa and 3000 Pa were measured by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to reveal the underlying carrier transport behavior in PSCs. The Nyquist plots at biases of −0.8, −0.6 and −0.3 V for two kinds of devices are shown in Fig. 6a–c. The corresponding Bode phase plots are shown in Fig. S6a–c (ESI†). Three peaks in the Bode plots and three semicircles in the Nyquist plots were observed. Here the EIS data were fitted by an equivalent circuit consisting of three lumped RC circuits in series, as shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†).37,38 The one at high frequency (104 to 106 Hz) is related to the electron transfer process at the counter electrode, meaning that R1 is the charge transfer resistance.39 The second one at intermediate frequency (10 to 104 Hz) is for the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/perovskite interface37 shown as R2 in Fig. S6a (ESI†). The low frequency (0.1–10 Hz) is responsible for the dipole in perovskite.40 The fitting results of the EIS data show that the charge transfer resistance R1 of both devices at different bias voltages is almost the same (Fig. S6d, ESI†). However the charge recombination resistance R2 of the devices obtained at a pressure of 1500 Pa is much larger than that of the device obtained at a pressure of 3000 Pa (Fig. 6d), which corresponds with the aforementioned analysis that the direct contact of the HTL and the TiO2 blocking layer leads to critical recombination of the excitons. Besides, an inflection point for recombination resistance appears at a voltage of around −0.7 V, which is close to the built-in potential of the TiO2/perovskite junction (Fig. 6d).37,41

To investigate the quality of large area perovskite films, devices with an area of 20.5 × 5.5 mm were fabricated at a pressure of 1500 Pa. Fig. 7a shows the PV parameters of 30 devices based on the GGPM with an average efficiency of 15.63 ± 0.80% and the data are listed in Table S8 (ESI†). Fig. 7b shows the J–V curves of two devices on a 2.5 × 2.5 cm substrate. Both devices were measured by reverse and forward scans at a scan step of 23.7 mV and a delay time of 1000 ms with the data listed in Table S9 (ESI†). The champion cell of the large-area PSCs achieved a JSC of 22.56 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1115 mV, a FF of 67.80% and a PCE of 17.05%. Fig. 7c shows the IPCE of the champion cell with an integrated JSC of 21.86 mA cm−2 which is a little smaller than the JSC shown in Fig. 7b. Furthermore the output of J and PCE at the maximum power point of the champion cell is measured at a bias voltage of 0.844 V. The J stabilized at 19.76 mA cm−2 and the PCE stabilized at 16.68% for about 600 s, which is one of the highest efficiencies for normal planar perovskite solar cells with a size of more than one square centimeter.14,17 The series resistance obtained by using an approach reported previously42,43 for the champion cell of 1.1275 cm2 is 11.8 Ω cm2, which is much larger than 2.9 Ω cm2 for 0.1 cm2. It could be found that the efficiency of the PSCs with an area larger than 1 cm2 is much lower than that of small PSCs with an area of 0.1 cm2, which is mainly because of the decrease of the fill factor for the large-area devices due to larger series resistance (mainly because of the FTO substrates with a very large sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1).14 Interestingly, the average VOC for the large-area devices is 1.09 V larger than 1.08 V for the 0.1 cm2 devices, which was also found in a previous report.18

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, according to the LaMer model and the components of the perovskite precursor solution, we developed a material nucleation/growth competition theory and concluded that the fast grain growth rate and few nuclei generated should be responsible for the incomplete coverage of perovskite films. Therefore based on fast nucleation and reduced grain growth time, we reported a gas-flow-induced gas pump method for the large-area deposition of dense, uniform and full-coverage perovskite films. We passed a certain amount of gas flow over the solution while pumping the solvent at the same time, which remarkably accelerated the evaporation of the solvent, resulting in the fast nucleation/crystallization of the perovskite from the precursor solution. This method could facilely fabricate dense, uniform and full-coverage perovskite films at a pressure of 100–1500 Pa with a gas flow of 360 L min−1 within 5 s which offers high manufacturing efficiency and a wide process window. Based on this method, we have been able to fabricate uniform perovskite films on substrates with areas of up to 144 cm2. Normal planar perovskite solar cells were fabricated at pressures of 100 Pa, 500 Pa and 1500 Pa, achieving average efficiencies of 19.25 ± 0.50%, 19.17 ± 0.46% and 18.98 ± 0.51% for 28 devices respectively for 0.1 cm2 devices. And a high fill factor of about 80% was achieved at different pressures. A champion cell was obtained with an efficiency of 20.44% which stabilized at 20.24% for about 600 s under a simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Additionally, we achieved a PCE of 17.03% and an average efficiency of 15.63 ± 0.80% with an area of 1.1275 cm2 (for 30 devices). This new GGPM could be applied to fabricate perovskite films as a universal method from wet precursor perovskite films obtained by spin-coating, doctor blade coating, slot die coating and so on. Furthermore the high reproducibility and efficiency of the devices based on the gas-flow-induced gas pump approach would boost the large-area fabrication of PSCs and make the commercial production of the perovskite solar cells possible.

The transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glasses with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 patterned using a laser were directly purchased from Weihua Solar Company (Xiamen, China).
Fabrication of perovskite films and solar cells
FTO glass substrates were washed by ultrasonication with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min respectively. The TiO2 blocking layer of about 60 nm was spin-coated on the FTO substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s using 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) solution followed by heating at 125 °C for 10 min. After the TiO2/FTO substrate was treated at 450 °C for 30 min, a 40 wt% perovskite precursor solution containing PbI2 mixed with CH3NH3I and HC(NH2)2I in the molar ratio of 1:0.9:0.1 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin-coated on the TiO2 blocking layer at 2500 rpm for 10 s. Then, the substrate was placed in a sample chamber connected to a gas pump system. It took about 4 s to transfer the substrate into the chamber. The gas pump system was home-made, and composed of a low pressure system with a larger vacuum buffer tank connected to the sample chamber by a gas drainage pipe controlled by a valve. At the bottom, the sample chamber was connected to two symmetrical gas tubes further connected to a gas flow controller respectively, which allows a certain amount of gas to flow to the surface of the wet perovskite film. And then opening the valve connecting the specimen chamber and the low pressure system, DMF solvent evaporates rapidly. After 5 s, closing the valve, and taking out the sample, a brown, somewhat transparent, FA0.1MA0.9PbI3 film with a mirror-like surface was obtained. The whole process took about 19 s from spin-coating to taking out the substrate. The sample chamber is very small with a volume of 0.04 L and the vacuum buffer tank is 108 L. The film was annealed at 120 °C on a hot plate for 20 min, and then transferred into a glovebox containing <0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O. And then the spiro-OMeTAD solution (80 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 μL of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI) in 1 mL acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the perovskite film by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD-coated substrates were stored in an auto-drying cabinet at 20 °C with a relative humidity of 15% for at least 8 h. Finally, a 100 nm thick gold layer was deposited onto the spiro-OMeTAD layer by thermal evaporation. The perovskite films were completed in air with a temperature of 23 °C and a relative humidity of 45–60%.
Characterization
A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FSEM, TESCAN) was used to characterize the surface and fracture morphologies of the perovskite films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Innova) was used to characterize the surface roughness of the perovskite films. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra were measured using a compact steady-state spectrophotometer (Fluoromax-4, Horiba Jobin Yvon) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. A U-3010 spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorption spectra of the perovskite films. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured by using a source meter (2400, Keithley) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination with a 450 W Class AAA solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (Sol3A, Oriel). A standard Si reference cell (91150V, Oriel) was used to calibrate the exact light intensity of the solar simulator. The devices were measured by reverse (1.2 to −0.2 V) and forward (−0.2 to 1.2 V) voltage scanning at a scan step of about 23.7 mV (60 points in total) and a delay time of 1000 ms. The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a solar cell spectral response/QE/IPCE test system (QTest Station 500AD, CROWNTECH) in ac mode. The electrochemical properties of the perovskite solar cell were investigated by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, by using an electrochemical system (EIS, Zennium IM6, Zahner). A series of EIS spectra of the devices were measured at a bias voltage from −0.1 V to −1.0 V with a scan step of 0.1 V and at a frequency ranging from 3 MHz to 100 mHz with an ac amplitude of 20 mV under 10 W LED light.
