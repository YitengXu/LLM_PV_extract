, Accepted 20th March 2017First published on 24th March 2017AbstractThe development of organic semiconductors is of key importance in order to improve the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Three indenothiophene (IT)-containing small molecules (IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT) were designed and synthesized for small molecule OSCs. The thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties of the molecules were investigated. The optical bandgaps of the three small molecules are ranged from 1.80 to 2.20 eV depending on different terminal groups flanked on the IT. We study the photovoltaic performances of the three molecules by fabricating OSCs with PC71BM as an electron acceptor. Among the three molecules, ITFBF exhibited the best power conversion efficiency of 4.57% with a high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.98 V. We also briefly discuss structure–property guidelines for small molecules used for OSCs. The results demonstrate that IT-based small molecules are promising for small molecule OSCs with large VOCs.
1. Introduction
Small molecule organic solar cells (OSCs), in which the photoactive layer commonly consists of a p-type semiconducting small molecule and a n-type fullerene derivative, have made significant progress in the past decade.1–4 In comparison with polymers, semiconducting small molecules for OSCs have the advantages of well-defined structures, high purity, and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility.5–7 So far, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction small molecule OSCs has exceeded 11%.3
For small molecule OSCs, the photoactive layer plays an important role not only in the open circuit voltage (VOC), but also in the current density, both of which affect the PCE of the resulting device. Therefore, the innovations in active layer materials are attracting more and more attention. Although a large number of small molecule donors have been used for OSCs, the building blocks for efficient small molecule donors are limited to few symmetric units such as benzodithiophene, dithienosilole, indacenedithiophene, and diketopyrrolopyrrole.3,8–11 For example, dithienosilole-based (DTS) derivatives were used for small molecule OSCs as donor units, leading to PCEs in the range from 5.8% to over 9%.9 Wang et al. introduced indacenedithiophene-based (IDT) derivatives as donor units to produce a series of high performing small molecules for OSCs.10d Deng et al. reported benzodithiophene-based small molecules with PCEs over 11%.3 All the small molecules mentioned above have symmetric structures. At the same time, some examples of asymmetric small molecules were also reported for OSCs by Sharma et al.12 However, the number of asymmetric semiconducting molecules is much less than that of the symmetric counterparts due to less availability of asymmetric π-conjugated cores.4 Recently, our group first introduced asymmetric indenothiophene (IT) to construct donor–acceptor copolymers for polymer solar cells with PCEs over 9%.13 However, the indenothiophene has never been used for constructing small molecule donors for OSCs.
In this context, three asymmetric indenothiophene-cored small molecules (IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT), were designed, synthesized, characterized, and used for the fabrication of OSCs. Three different terminal groups were flanked on the IT core for constructing the target small molecules in order to study the structure–property relationships of the IT-based small molecules. The chemical structures of the target small molecules are shown in Scheme 1. Among them, the devices based on ITFBT exhibited the best PCE of 4.57% and a VOC of 0.98 V under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). IT3T and IT2FBT gave low PCEs of 0.71% and 1.92%, respectively.

Following the same procedure as that used for IT3T, IT2FBT was obtained a dark red solid (0.14 g, 54%) through a Stille coupling reaction between 4-bromo-5,6-difluoro-7-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′]bithiophenyl-5-yl)-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole (0.31 g, 0.6 mmol) and IT-Sn (0.16 g, 0.2 mmol). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): 8.35–8.23 (m, 4H), 7.73–7.70 (m, 2H), 7.56–7.52 (m, 2H), 7.27–7.25 (m, 2H), 7.20–7.17 (m, 2H), 6.79–6.75 (m, 2H), 2.85 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 4H), 2.20–2.06 (m, 4H), 1.77–1.70 (m, 2H), 1.46–1.23 (m, 14H), 1.10–0.75 (m, 24H), 0.71–0.61 (m, 12H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): 155.85, 155.83, 154.83, 150.91, 150.83, 148.75, 148.73, 148.66, 148.60, 148.24, 148.17, 146.45, 145.41, 141.36, 141.28, 141.20, 138.24, 138.20, 134.26, 132.11, 132.09, 132.02, 131.75, 131.71, 131.68, 131.66, 131.59, 131.16, 131.10, 129.97, 129.91, 129.87, 129.83, 126.13, 125.25, 125.05, 124.08, 124.04, 123.14, 120.85, 119.77, 111.21, 54.51, 43.64, 35.16, 34.26, 34.15, 31.65, 30.30, 28.88, 28.40, 27.50, 22.92, 22.66, 14.17, 14.10, 10.75. HRMS (MALDI-DHB, m/z): calcd for C71H74F4N4S8 [M]+ 1314.3615; found 1314.3610. Elemental analysis (%) calc. for C71H74F4N4S8: C, 64.80; H, 5.67; N, 4.26; found: C, 65.02; H, 5.71; N, 4.19.
2.7 Instruments
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometer operating at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) measurements were performed on an IonSpec 4.7 T spectrometer. Absorption spectra were obtained by using a spectrophotometer (Lambda 365 UV/vis). The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on a CHI 700E electrochemical workstation. OSCs were measured by a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) on an Oriel sol3A simulator (Newport) which had been precisely calibrated with a NREL-certified silicon reference cell before testing. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured on a Newport EQE measuring system. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed with the Bruker's Dimension FastScan at a tapping mode.
2.8 Electrochemistry
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were measured by using a three-electrode cell system (a Pt disk working electrode coated with thin films of small molecules, a Pt wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode). The measurements were performed in a 0.1 mol L−1 anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The energy level of the ferrocene was assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.82 eV to vacuum. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) and onset reduction potentials (Ered) vs. Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode according to the following equations:EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.82) (eV)ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.82) (eV)
2.9 Fabrication of conventional OSCs
The OSCs were fabricated with the device structure of: indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/small-molecule:PC71BM/PDIN/Al. ITO glass was cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropanol for 30 min each and then dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight. After the ITO glass substrates were subjected to ultraviolet/ozone treatment for 15 min, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVPAI 4083) which had been filtered through a 0.45 μm filter was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Then the film-loaded substrates were dried at 140 °C in air for 15 min. A mixture of small-molecule:PC71BM (1:2.2, w/w) was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and stirred overnight. Then the small-molecule:PC71BM solution was spin-cast at 1100 rpm for 60 s to form the active layer. An electron injection interlayer was prepared by spin-coating a methanol solution of PDIN (1.5 mg mL−1 containing 0.2% acetic acid) to facilitate efficient electron injection. Finally, the negative electrode was prepared by thermally depositing ∼120 nm aluminum through a shadow mask under a high vacuum of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The device areas of the OSCs were fixed at 0.06 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for the target molecules (IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT) are shown in Scheme 1 and the detailed synthetic procedures are shown in the Experimental section. The stannylized IT-Sn was prepared according to the procedures we reported previously.13a The synthesis of compound 3 started from compound 1, which was reacted with 2-bromothiophene to afford compound 2 in 59% yield. Bromination of compound 2 afforded compound 3 in 70% yield. The Stille reaction between compound 3 and IT-Sn using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst gave compound IT3T in 66% yield. Similarly, ITFBT and IT2FBT were obtained by Stille coupling reactions between IT-Sn and the two benzothiadiazole-based bromides 4, respectively. The chemical structures and the purity of all new compounds were characterized by NMR, elemental analysis and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).
3.2 Thermal properties
The thermal stability of the three small molecules was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT showed sufficiently high decomposition temperatures (Td) of 403, 405, and 398 °C, respectively (Fig. S1† and Table 1).

3.3 Optical properties
The absorption spectra of IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT in solution or in solid state are shown in Fig. 1, and the related parameters are summarized in Table 1. Due to the identical acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured backbone, ITFBT and IT2FBT exhibited analogous absorption bands both in the solution and in the thin film. For both ITFBT and IT2FBT, the shorter wavelength absorption bands originate from the π–π* transition and the longer ones are from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units. However, IT3T exhibited only the π–π* transition band in solution or in thin film, which agrees with the donor–donor configuration of its molecule backbone. In going from the solution to the thin film, the absorption bands of all the three compounds become broadened and red-shifted. However, in comparison with IT3T, both IT2FBT and ITFBT exhibited a more red-shifted absorption in going from solution to thin film indicating a possible stronger π–π interaction for latter two. The optical bandgaps of IT3T, ITFBT, and IT2FBT are 2.20, 1.81 and 1.84 eV, respectively. Among the three molecules, ITFBT possesses the smallest band gap of 1.81 eV, which is beneficial for enhanced light harvesting.

3.4 Electrochemical properties
To determine the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels of IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The HOMO energy levels for IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT were estimated to be −5.29, −5.35 and −5.46 eV, respectively. Both ITFBT and IT2FBT exhibit deeper HOMO energy levels in comparison with IT3T suggesting that the A–D–A structured backbone is favorable to down-shift the HOMO level of the resulting molecule. Compared to ITFBT, IT2FBT contains two additional electron withdrawing fluorine atoms thereby resulting in a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.46 eV. The electrochemical bandgaps of the three small molecules are also estimated and they share the order of IT3T > IT2FBT > ITFBT, which agrees with their optical bandgap trend. The electrochemical properties of these molecules suggest that molecules with A–D–A structured backbone are beneficial for OSCs with enhanced light absorption as well as large VOCs.

3.5 Photovoltaic performance
The photothose of the voltaic properties of IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT were investigated by fabricating OSCs with the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/PDIN/Al, where PDIN and PEDOT are 2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrene sulfonate, respectively. The best performance OSCs were fabricated by using solutions with a donor (D)/acceptor (A) ratio of 1:2.2 (w/w), and the solutions were spin-coated at a spinning rate of 1100 rpm. The device parameters of all three small molecule-based OSCs are summarized in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 3a. It is showed that the OSC based on ITFBT:PC71BM achieved the best performance among all the three small molecule-based devices. Without any additive, the device based on ITFBT:PC71BM exhibited a high VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 10.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.456, all of which leads to a high PCE of 4.57%. With the same A–D–A structured backbone and similar accepter units, IT2FBT-based OSC exhibited a lower PCE of 1.92% with a decreased JSC of 6.25 mA cm−2, a reduced FF of 30.5%, but a larger VOC of 1.01 V. The increased VOC is mainly attributed to the deeper HOMO energy level of IT2FBT as determined by cyclic voltammogram. However, the device based on IT3T:PC71BM showed a PCE of 0.71%, with a low JSC of 3.29 mA cm−2, a poor FF of 28.6%, and a low VOC of 0.753 V. The inferior device performance for IT3T could be related to its relatively large bandgap, high HOMO energy level, as well as low carrier mobility. It should be noted that these conventional OSCs using PEDOT:PSS as anode buffer layer are relatively unstable over time in ambient conditions (Fig. S2†). However, the shelf stability of OSCs can be greatly enhanced by adopting an inverted device structure where the PEDOT:PSS is replaced by other inorganic buffer layers.15 To assure the accuracy of the PCE measurements, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the OSCs were measured and shown in Fig. 3b. All the EQE curves cover a spectral response range from 300 to 700 nm. In this range, the average EQE values of IT2FBT- and ITFBT-based devices are much higher than those of the IT3T-based device. The calculated JSC value from EQE is 10.04 mA cm−2 for ITFBT, which is very close to that obtained from the J–V measurement (10.24 mA cm−2) within 2% mismatch. The calculated JSC values from the EQE curves of IT3T- and IT2FBT-based devices are also in agreement with the corresponding measured JSC values. In order to know the origin of the observed photovoltaic performance differences among the three molecules, we measured the hole transport properties of the blend films by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecules/MoO3/Au were fabricated. As shown in Fig. 4, ITFBT shows the highest hole mobility of 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with IT3T (7.9 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) and IT2FBT (8.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). This highest hole mobility of the ITFBT-based device explains the higher JSC and improved FF compared to the devices based on the other two molecules.

3.6 Morphology
The surface morphology of the small molecule:PC71BM blends was measured by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The topography images and corresponding phase images of the small molecule blends are shown in Fig. 5. Among the three topographic images, the ITFBT:PC71BM film has the most smooth surface, with a small average root mean square (RMS) roughness value of 0.6 nm. While the other two films based on IT3T:PC71BM and IT2FBT:PC71BM, have larger RMS roughness values of 1.04 and 1.88 nm, respectively, demonstrating the rougher surfaces than the ITFBT:PC71BM film. From the phase images, the ITFBT:PC71BM film shows clear phase seperation features with domain sizes of 10–20 nm. However, the phase seperation features are relatively unclear in the case of IT3T:PC71BM or IT2FBT:PC71BM. At the same time, apparent aggregates with a domain size of more than 100 nm were found for the IT2FBT:PC71BM film. This scale is much larger than the exciton diffusion length (<10 nm), leading to an increased recombination rate of the photo-induced excitons before reaching the interfaces. It is believed that nanoscale phase separation enables a large interface area for exciton dissociation and a continuous percolating path for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes.16 The morphology difference among the three small molecule blends explains the device performance difference for the three molecules with different ending groups.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized three novel asymmetric small molecules (IT3T, ITFBT and IT2FBT) based on the indenothiophene core. Due to the electron-withdrawing ability of fluorinated benzothiadiazole units, ITFBT and IT2FBT exhibited deeper HOMO energy levels of −5.35 and −5.46 eV with smaller optical bandgaps (1.81, 1.84 eV), respectively, than those of IT3T (−5.29 eV, 2.20 eV), thus leading to the enhanced photovoltaic performance of ITFBT and IT2FBT. The best performance device based on ITFBT delivered a PCE of 4.57% with a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 10.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.456. IT2FBT and IT3T exhibited relatively lower PCEs of 1.92% and 0.71%, respectively, which can be attributed to the unfavorable energy level, bandgap, carrier mobility or the morphology induced by the difference in their ending groups. The results suggest that the backbone configuration is an important factor determining the performance of the indenothiophene-based small molecules. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that the asymmetric indenothiophene can be an excellent donor core for small molecule semiconductors.
