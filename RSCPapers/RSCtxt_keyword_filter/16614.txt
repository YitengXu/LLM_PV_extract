    , Accepted 4th November 2016First published on 8th November 2016AbstractUnsymmetrical squaraine sensitizers with two different donor moieties, triphenylamine (NSQR) and heterotriangulene (NSQ1–3), for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been designed and synthesized. These dyes utilize the indolium moiety to control charge recombination dynamics at the TiO2-dye-electrolyte interface by connecting linear and branched alkyl functionalities. In the present study, an efficient heterotriangulene (HT) donor and a branched alkyl group at sp3-C atoms were strategically incorporated to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of zwitterionic dyes by improving photo-current density (Jsc) and open-circuit potential (Voc) of the cell. Among these four dyes, NSQ3 exhibited the highest efficiency of 6.73% with a Jsc of 18.74 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.53 V, and fill factor (ff) of 68.3%, without any co-adsorbent under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (simulated AM 1.5G sunlight). In the presence of 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid (CDCA), NSQ1, NSQ2 and NSQ3 showed an efficiency of 7.07%, 7.38% and 7.17%, respectively. Despite the low Voc, far red light harvesting efficiency, reduced dye aggregation, long lifetime (τ) of injected electrons and high quantum efficiency of NSQ1–3 played constructive roles in achieving high PCE efficiency. Deceleration of charge recombination for NSQ dye cells was further studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open-circuit photo-voltage decay (OCVD) measurements.
1. Introduction
DSSCs have been considered as a promising alternative to conventional inorganic p–n junction silicon-based solar cells for solar energy-to-electricity conversion.1,2 Since the first report by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, dye cells have received considerable attention because of their low fabrication cost and diversity in device components.3 Sensitizers used in dye cells to absorb the photons are broadly classified into two categories: (1) organometallic dyes (ruthenium–polypyridyl complexes4,5 and zinc porphyrin dyes)6 and (2) metal-free organic dyes.7,8 Particularly, to harness the long wavelength photons, near-infrared (NIR) light harvesting dyes like phthalocyanines,9,10 polymethines,11 and porphyrins12,13 have been explored and so far the best conversion efficiency was obtained for porphyrin based dye (SM315) which is 13% with a Co(II)/(III) redox couple.14
Squaraines, one of the polymethine dyes, have attracted special interest because of their intense absorption in the far-red and near-infrared (NIR) regions,15–17 and high molar absorptivity (∼105 M−1 cm−1) compared to zinc porphyrins.18 However, these zwitterionic molecules aggregate on the metal oxide surface that reduces the excited state lifetime, and leads to inefficient power conversion.19,20 There are two types of squaraine dyes known in the literature – symmetrical21,22 and unsymmetrical,23,24 and the directionality of electron injection was realized better in the latter. The device efficiencies for symmetrical and unsymmetrical dyes have reached 6.18% (VG10-C2)25 and 8.9% (DTS-CA),26 respectively. Recently, few triphenylamine (TPA) based unsymmetrical squaraine dyes have been synthesized27,28 and the highest PCE of 6.29% was achieved for JK216 dye.29 These sensitizers exhibited intense absorption bands in the NIR region30 but they tend to form either H- or J- type aggregates and reduce the excited state electron lifetime.31 Also the propeller shaped TPA lacks rigidity and poor extension of π-conjugation over the whole molecule due to the large dihedral angles between the phenyl rings and the plane of the N-bonded carbon atoms.32,33 Based on the understanding from the previous studies, a planar heterotriangulene donor system was introduced into donor–π–acceptor DSSCs to achieve fast electron injection,34 increases the electronic coupling between donor and acceptor moieties of the dye, and localizes the positive charge resulting after electron injection.32 By introducing a planar rigid moiety,35 dyes tend to assemble via π–π stacking while anchoring on TiO2 and to keep dyes separated for avoiding the aggregation-induced decay of the excited state, an indolium moiety of the unsymmetrical squaraines was functionalized with in-plane and out-of-plane alkyl functionalities.36
In this study, we report a new dye design to improve the PCE of unsymmetrical squaraine by taking advantage of a strong donor and an alkyl functionalized indolium unit (Fig. 1). In both dyes, a squaric acid unit is linked between either a HT or TPA donor and an indolium moiety having a carboxylic acid as an anchoring group. Introduction of long alkyl chains on the indolium unit is expected to increase the solubility, decrease the undesirable dye aggregation and suppress dye desorption by reducing the infiltration of the solvent to the TiO2 surface.37,38 We systematically connected alkyl groups in the N- and sp3-C atoms of the indolium unit to provide an in-plane and out-of-plane branching of hydrophobic chains, respectively.39 Current–voltage (I–V) measurements showed that HT based dyes (NSQ1–3) outperformed TPA based squaraine (NSQR) in terms of both Jsc and Voc. Although NSQ2 and NSQR show a similar molecular structure apart from the different donors, it is found that Jsc of NSQ2 significantly increased by 41.2% compared to that of NSQR because of the effective conjugation. In-plane and out-of-plane alkyl groups of NSQ3 further increased the Jsc by 30.2% and hence achieved the PCE of 6.73% without any co-adsorbent. A bulky, passivating indolium unit close to the anchoring group suppressed the charge recombination, and the Voc of NSQ3 increased by 118 mV without CDCA compared to that of NSQR, which has been verified by photo-voltage decay studies.40,41

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The molecular structure of sensitizers and their synthetic scheme are illustrated in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1, respectively. Synthesis of unsymmetrical squaraine sensitizers, NSQR and NSQ1–3, requires semi-squaraine and an indolium salt with either N- or sp3-C or both atoms functionalized with alkyl groups. To reduce the number of steps involved in the synthesis, we have chosen TPA and HT derived semi-squaric acid and suitably functionalized indolium salt as the precursors. For the indolium moiety containing sp3-C atom functionalized with alkyl groups, suitably substituted branched methyl ketone is required and we have chosen judiciously 3-octyltridecan-2-one. The branched methyl ketone was synthesized starting from oxidation of branched alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde. Further reaction with MeMgI afforded the corresponding secondary alcohol which was oxidized to give the required precursor in moderate yield and reacted with 4-caboxyphenylhydrazine to provide the intermediate (2a,2b). The corresponding indolium salts (3a–3c) were synthesized by reacting with alkyl halide in moderate yield. The semi-squaraine derivatives 4c and 5c were prepared by reaction of 4a and 5a with squaryl chloride followed by acid hydrolysis of the semi-squaryl chloride derivatives.42 A condensation reaction between semi-squaryl chloride derivatives of 4c or 5c and 5-carboxy-2,3,3-trialkyl-1-alkylindolium units (3a–3c) afforded the NSQ sensitizers. All the sensitizers have good solubility in MeCN, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and DMSO and limited solubility in MeOH. All the intermediates and final dye molecules were characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR and mass spectrometry (HRMS-ESI).

Apart from the ICT band, NSQ1–3 show π–π* transition between 400 and 500 nm with lower ε values (∼103 M−1 cm−1). After substituting the propeller triphenylamine donor with planar triphenylamine, i.e. heterotriangulene, the absorption maximum (λmax) of NSQ1–3 is red-shifted around 30 nm relative to that of NSQR, due to extended conjugation. The absorption spectra of NSQ1–3 are broadened on the TiO2 thin film due to the interaction of carboxylic acid groups with the surface titanium ions and λmax is blue shifted by 32 and 38 nm for NSQ1 and NSQ2, respectively, because of the H-type of aggregation.43 However, NSQ3 shows only an 8 nm shift towards higher energy because of the presence of out-of-plane alkyl segments on indolium sp3-C atoms, which effectively suppresses dye aggregation. It is observed that emission λmax of NSQ sensitizers is shifted to longer wavelength and a maximum stokes shift of ∼70 nm is observed for NSQ1–3 sensitizers, which is relatively small for NSQR (∼50 nm). This finding qualitatively supports the larger dipole moments in the excited state for NSQ1–3 in solution (Fig. 2a) due to additional conjugation from the HT unit.
2.3. Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out in CH3CN to understand the feasibility of electron transfer from the excited state of the sensitizers to the conduction band of the TiO2 and the regeneration of oxidized dyes by the electrolyte. Redox potentials of NSQR and NSQ1–3 were measured (Fig. 3 and Table 1), and exhibited the quasi-reversible first ground-state oxidation potential of NSQR at 0.78 and for NSQ1–3 at 0.79 (NSQ1), 0.81 (NSQ2) and 0.81 (NSQ3) V vs. NHE. Eox of NSQs was low enough to get regenerated by iodide (0.4 V vs. NHE). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the NSQR was not affected after substituting with fused triarylamine, NSQ1, as listed in Table 1. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of NSQ dyes was calculated by subtracting E0–0 from EHOMO and the values are found to be −1.08, −0.98, −0.95 and −0.96 V vs. NHE for NSQR, NSQ1, NSQ2 and NSQ3, respectively, which lie above the conduction band edge (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE)44 that allows an effective electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 as shown in Fig. 3b. NSQR and NSQ1–3 showed a band gap (Eg) in the range of 1.7–1.9 eV, which is in good accordance with the band gaps determined from the DFT studies.

2.4. Theoretical investigations
The molecular geometries of NSQ sensitizers were optimized using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level with the Gaussian 09 program45 and the isosurface plots for HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 are shown in Fig. 4 (NSQR, NSQ2) and Fig. S47.† In NSQ1–3 sensitizers, the electron density in the HOMO and HOMO−1 was more delocalized on the donor part than NSQR and also well distributed throughout squaric acid, whereas the LUMO was delocalized towards the indolium unit containing electron withdrawing carboxylic acid. This HOMO and LUMO overlap facilitates the effective charge transfer from the donor to the anchoring unit and hence shows a red-shifted λmax in the absorption spectrum. The LUMO+1 for all sensitizers was mainly located near to the anchoring group. On the other hand, in NSQR the HOMO−1 was located on the squaric acid unit, which indicates the inability of triarylamine to regenerate the dye after injection of electrons into TiO2 compared to other NSQ dyes. These overall DFT results suggest that the HOMO–LUMO or HOMO–LUMO+1 excitations can afford electron flow from the donor unit to the anchoring group.
 Fig. 4  HOMO and LUMO isosurface plots of NSQR (left) and NSQ2 (right), respectively. 
The degree of conjugation between the donor and acceptor could be influenced by the dihedral angle between benzene and nitrogen atoms of the TPA or HT donor (θ1), donor and squaric acid unit (θ2), and squaric acid and indolium unit θ3.46θ1 for NSQR is found to be more deviated than that of NSQ1–3 dyes and indicates a better co-planarity of donor–acceptor parts (Fig. 5). The θ1 value of NSQR is 47.06°, whereas for NSQ1–3 it is close to 0° (Table S1†). Bulky alkyl functionalities of the indolium unit exhibit extended conformation with θ4 of 176.6°, which helps to improve the photo-physical properties by reducing the aggregation as well as extending the conjugation. Distances between (i) sp3-C (methylene group of HT) to –O atoms of carboxylic acid, (ii) terminal carbon atoms of the sp3-branched alkyl chain and (iii) sp3-C (indoline) to –O atoms of carboxylic acid were 19.6 Å, 23.1 Å, and 6.2 Å, respectively for NSQ3 (Fig. S48†). Such structural features may lead to a better exposed HOMO for efficient dye regeneration, reduced dye aggregation and charge recombination due to extended conformation of alkyl groups, and the presence of long branched hydrophobic alkyl chains near to the surface, respectively.

2.5. Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of NSQR and NSQ1–3 DSSCs is shown in Fig. 6b and 7b. The increased Jsc value of NSQ1–3 sensitizers is reflected in the IPCE spectra, and shows broader and higher IPCE in the range of 400 to 800 nm, reaching a maximum of 73% and 69% at 420 and 635 nm, respectively, in the absence of CDCA for NSQ3. NSQ3 dye converted 50% of the photons at 750 nm, whereas NSQR shows only an 8% IPCE response at the same wavelength. NIR photons are effectively converted when the TiO2 sensitized with NSQ3 than any other dyes in the series without CDCA, with the IPCE of 30% at 780 nm, where NSQ1 and NSQ2 show below 10%. After the addition of CDCA, NSQs shows a further increase in IPCE in a higher wavelength region, and at 750 nm NSQ1, NSQ2 and NSQ3 exhibit an IPCE of 50%, 58% and 62%, respectively. But for NSQR, the IPCE response around 750 nm is 15% under the same conditions.

 Fig. 7  (a) J–V curve and (b) IPCE spectra of NSQR, and NSQ1–3 in the presence of CDCA. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs based on NSQR and NSQ1–3 were evaluated under simulated AM 1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2), and the curves are shown in Fig. 6a and 7a. In the case of NSQR, NSQ1 and NSQ2, the moderate performance is achieved without any co-absorbent, because of the aggregation of dyes in the absence of CDCA. Among the NSQs, NSQ3 sensitized cells give better performance without CDCA and achieved an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.73% with a Jsc of 18.74 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.53 V. In particular, among the four dyes the NSQ3 shows the maximum Voc of 0.54 V and 0.53 V with and without CDCA, respectively, proving the strong ability of branched and long alkyl side chains on the chromophore that prevents surface aggregation and reduces the charge recombination even without any co-adsorbent.47
Results of five cells with deviation for optimized dye/CDCA are shown in Fig. S49† and photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 2. As expected, the addition of CDCA has a positive impact on improving the Voc and Jsc values of NSQ sensitizer based DSSCs, and hence after the addition of 10 equivalents of CDCA, the NSQ2 sensitized cells show an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.4% with a Jsc of 20.57 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.53 V and ff of 0.68, while triphenylamine based NSQR sensitized cells exhibited a relatively poor performance with an overall η of 4.63% at the same amount of co-adsorbent due to lower Jsc (14.95 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.47 V) values. The NSQ1 sensitized cell achieved a Jsc value of 21.32 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.49 V, and ff of 0.68, corresponding to an η of 7.07%. The device made with NSQ3 reached a Jsc of 20.11 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.54 V, ff of 0.66 and overall conversion efficiency of 7.17% with the addition of a minimum amount of CDCA (1 equivalent), and the curves are shown in Fig. 7a. It is found that the Jsc and Voc of NSQ3 dyes decrease with further addition of CDCA due to competitive binding of CDCA over dyes. These results indicate that the addition of a large amount of CDCA is not beneficial for NSQ3 to enhance the photovoltaic performance (Table S2 in the SI†). Dye desorption results indicate the modulated adsorption of dyes on TiO2 with respect to their structure (Table 2 and Fig. S50†). Dye loading ability decreases in the order of NSQR > NSQ1 > NSQ2 ≈ NSQ3, due to a progressive increase of alkyl groups near the TiO2 surface which blocks the dye anchoring to the pentacoordinated Ti center. However, addition of 10 equivalents of CDCA abruptly changes the quantity of adsorbed dyes in the case of NSQ3 over three other dyes that leads to decreased device efficiency (Table S2†). All the dyes with a HT donor showed high Jsc with and without CDCA compared to those with a triphenylamine donor. Herein, considering the very similar configuration between NSQ1–3 and NSQR, the incorporated HT donor and branching at the chromophore paved the way to extend the light harvesting ability and reducing the charge recombination property. The distinct enhancement of Jsc and Voc of NSQ1–3 suggests that the incorporation of a fused donor unit and branched alkyl groups into the dye structure would be a meaningful approach to improve the PCE of metal-free squaraine dyes.

2.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To understand the effect of the fused donor and out-of-plane branched alkyl groups on photovoltaic performance of NSQ dye cells, EIS analysis was carried out in the dark with applied potential. Generally, Voc and Jsc of dye cells are known to be affected by the charge recombination dynamics at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte.48Voc of the dye cell is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 (EF,n) and Fermi level (EF,redox) of the redox couple (I−/I3− in this study), as expressed in eqn (1). The uncertainty of the photo-voltage originates from a shift of the TiO2 electron quasi-Fermi-level, eqn (2), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature (293 K), nc is the free electron density, and Nc is the density of accessible states in the conduction band, which may be ascribed to two major reasons: (i) a shift in the TiO2 conduction band edge (ECB), which can be inferred from the chemical capacitance (Cμ), and (ii) a fluctuation of electron density, which is related to the electron lifetime (τ) determined by the charge recombination rate.26 Thus, through Nyquist and Bode plots of EIS analysis, the corresponding charge transfer resistance (Rct), Cμ and τ are Voc = EF,redox − EF,n(1) (2)elucidated to explain the charge transfer process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.
The Nyquist plot of NSQR and NSQ1–3 dye cells is shown in Fig. 8a, the second semi-circle representing the charge transfer reaction at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface for NSQ3 was larger than that for other dyes, in the order of NSQ3 > NSQ2 > NSQ1 > NSQR. The peak frequency of the Bode plot has shifted towards the lowest value for NSQ3 as shown in Fig. 8b. In general, a long electron lifetime implies a slower electron recombination rate at the interface, which increases the free electron density and these observations point the effective passivation of the surface by hydrophobic alkyl chains near to the TiO2 surface through van der Waals interaction. Fig. 8c and d show observed Rct and τ respectively, extracted after fitting the Nyquist plot using an equivalent circuit (inset Fig. 8c). The τ value of NSQ3 is longer than that of NSQR, NSQ1 and NSQ2, which is consistent with observed improvement in Voc. Strong π–π interaction and better screening of the oxide surface showed maximum τ around 52 ms at an applied bias of −0.3 V. Under the same conditions, NSQ1 and NSQ2 showed a τ of 13.8 and 29.5 ms, respectively, indicating an increase in charge recombination rates. NSQs increased Rct and Cμ (Fig. S51†) which further supported the high Jsc and Voc values than NSQR. An increase in the rate of electron injection and reduced interfacial recombination could bring the difference in electron density in the conduction band of metal oxide.49 Overall, the successful approach towards increasing the efficiency of unsymmetrical squaraine dyes discussed here could improve further by focusing on Voc.50 The overall performance of NSQ3 shows an approach to design co-adsorbent free unsymmetrical squaraine dye cells with high efficiency.

2.7. Open-circuit voltage decay measurement
Furthermore, transient recombination kinetics of NSQs were studied after illuminating the device. The open-circuit voltage decay-time profile reflects the electron recombination kinetics after generating triiodide at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.51Eqn (3) was used to evaluate the correlation between Voc (3)decay and electron lifetime (τn), where kBT is the thermal energy and e is the positive elementary charge:
According to this equation, the electron lifetime of the devices can be extracted from the slope of the photovoltage decay curves. Voc decay traces were measured in the dark after illuminating the cell for 10 s at 1 sun intensity. Fig. 9 shows the decay profile of NSQR and NSQ1–3 dye cells; the NSQ3 dye cell shows the slowest decay (78% at 50 s) and NSQR displays the fast voltage decay (95% at 50 s). Remarkably, the minimum rate of recombination in the NSQ3 sensitized dye cell was attributed to the effective passivation of the mesoporous surface by introducing hydrophobic alkyl functionalities near to the anchoring group. The observed 120 mV difference in the Voc of NSQ3 compared to NSQR without any co-adsorbent indicates the slow recombination of injected electrons with triiodide. Results of the EIS experiment in the dark and OCVD measurement in the presence of light in turn support the deceleration of charge recombination, via a dark reaction and back electron transfer, for NSQ3 dye compared to other NSQs.

3. Conclusion
The effects of HT and TPA donor moieties and types of alkyl functionalities in unsymmetrical squaraine dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells were investigated. Heterotriangulene based NSQ1–3 sensitizers have shown significant improvement in PCE compared to NSQR; the NSQ3 sensitized device achieved an efficiency of 6.73% without a co-adsorbent, and in the presence of CDCA NSQ2 and NSQ3 exhibited 7.4% and 7.17% PCE, respectively. Higher and broader IPCE of NSQ1–3, due to extended conjugation and strong donor–acceptor coupling, shows the better NIR light harvesting efficiency of these metal-free dyes than NSQR. The EIS and OCVD studies proved that an alkyl-functionalized indolium unit attached to carboxylic acid suppresses the undesirable charge recombination and prolongs the electron lifetime, hence significantly enhancing the PCE. As a result, NSQ1–3 exhibited an efficiency of more than 70% over reference sensitizer NSQR, PCE of 4.6%. This study suggests that introducing an out-of-plane alkyl chain on the indolium group of unsymmetrical squaraine increases the Jsc and Voc, and avoids the co-adsorbent in dye cell fabrication. Hydrophobic alkyl functionalities on the squaraine chromophore near to the surface of TiO2 lead to better control over the recombination process between the electrolyte and TiO2.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials and characterization
All reagents were purchased from commercial sources. Solvents were dried and distilled immediately prior to use by standard procedures. All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Characterizations of all compounds are provided in the ESI.†1H NMR and 13C NMR were recorded in, CDCl3, MeOH-d4 or DMSO-d6 on 200 MHz NMR, 400 MHz NMR and 500 MHz NMR spectrometers. High-resolution mass spectrometric measurements were carried out using the ESI method and an ion-trap mass analyzer. Absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature in a quartz cuvette using an Analytik Jena UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a Bio-Logic potentiostat (model no. SP300). The cyclic voltammetric analysis (CV) was carried out in dry acetonitrile solvent by using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte and Fc/Fc+ as the internal reference. The experiments were performed at room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere with a three-electrode cell consisting of a platinum foil as the counter electrode, an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the working electrode.

4.3. Solar cell preparation and characterization
FTO (F-doped SnO2 glass; 6–8 Ω sq−1; Pilkington TEC 7) was cleaned with Mucasol (2% in water), deionised water, and ethanol, successively. To grow a TiO2 under layer, the substrate was immersed in freshly prepared 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and washed with deionised water before drying at 100 °C for 10 min. A paste of TiO2 nanocrystals (<20 nm, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix) was deposited by the doctor-blade technique on a TiO2 buffer layer coated FTO substrate, kept in air for 5 min and then annealed at 125 °C in air for 15 min. The films were about 6–8 μm thick. The annealed films were coated with a scattering layer TiO2 paste (WER2-O, Dyesol) and annealed at 125 °C in air for 15 min. The annealed films were sintered at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min with a heating rate of 5 °C per min in air. After reaching the furnace temperature at 50 °C, sintered films were immersed in freshly prepared 50 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. After sintering the TiCl4-treated TiO2 films at 500 °C for 30 min, they were immediately immersed in 0.1 mM NSQ dye solution in dichloromethane for 2.5 h, washed and dried at 80 °C. In the case of CDCA added experiments, different ratios of CDCA were added to 0.1 mM dye solution and the photoanode was dipped for 2.5 h. A sandwich type cell configuration was completed using platinum as the cathode, 0.5 M DMII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2 and 10 mM TBP in CH3CN was used as the electrolyte and 25 μm spacer. I–V characteristics of the cells were measured using a Keithley digital source meter (2420, Keithley, USA) controlled by a computer and a standard AM 1.5 solar simulator (PET, CT200AAA, USA). To measure the photocurrent and voltage, an external bias of AM 1.5G light was applied using a xenon lamp (450 W, USHIO INC, Philippines) and recorded. IPCE measurements were carried out with a Newport QE measurement kit by focusing a monochromatic beam of light from a 300 W Xe lamp onto the devices. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSSCs were carried out with a Bio-Logic potentiostat (model no. SP300), equipped with an FRA2 module, with different potentials applied in the dark. The frequency range explored was 1 mHz to 1 MHz with an ac perturbation of 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. The OCVD profile was measured with a Bio-Logic potentiostat (model no. SP300), equipped with an FRA2 module, and the dye cell was illuminated for 10 s at 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2) and Voc decay was recorded in the dark.
4.4. Dye desorption from the photoanode
The TiO2 coated FTO electrodes (0.22 cm2, thickness of TiO2 layer 8 + 4 μm) were dipped in 0.1 mM of NSQR, NSQ1–3 in CH2Cl2 for 6 h at room temperature, and then washed with CH2Cl2 to remove the physisorbed dyes. The electrodes were immersed in 2 M ethanolic HCl for 30 min until all the dyes completely desorbed and the amount of adsorbed dye is calculated by UV-Vis experiments.
