    , Accepted 4th February 2022First published on 7th February 2022AbstractLead (Pb) contamination and intrinsic instability of Pb-based perovskite materials greatly limit their application in a reliable and scalable manner, and the development of efficient and stable Pb-free alternatives is highly desirable. CsBi3I10 represents a promising light absorber owing to its appropriate bandgap, low material cost and solution processability; however, recent studies reveal that low-quality polycrystalline films and poor power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) significantly hinder the practical application of bismuth-based perovskites. Challenges remain in fundamentally modulating the crystallization kinetics and enhancing the photovoltaic performance. Here, we successfully develop a versatile fabrication technology, namely a gas quenching assisted antisolvent method (GQAS), to fine control crystallization and engineer film microstructures, which enables a compact, pinhole free and uniform thin film. Besides, the introduction of a multifunctional molecular additive 1,3-bis[3,5-bis-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]thiourea (FS) in CsBi3I10 can further induce efficient defect passivation, high film hydrophobicity and remarkable water stability. Significantly, the synergistic effects from GQAS and FS greatly improve the film microstructures and charge collection efficiency, yielding one order of magnitude higher PCEs (>1%) in CsBi3I10 thin film solar cells, which represents one of the highest reported efficiencies for CsBi3I10. This work provides new insights into the crystallization mechanism, and the developed strategies are generally applicable towards efficient and stable Pb-free PSCs.
Introduction
Lead (Pb) halide perovskites have recently become one of the most promising semiconductors in optoelectronic applications, especially in solar cells, owing to their outstanding properties, such as high extinction coefficients, ambipolar charge transport, high defect tolerance and solution processability. These enable Pb-based perovskites to demonstrate remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25%, which is comparable to that of conventional silicon solar cells.1,2 However, organic–inorganic Pb-based perovskites exhibit poor intrinsic stability, causing severe degradation on exposure to environmental conditions with heat, humidity and light.3,4 The high chemical sensitivity of Pb-perovskite materials greatly limits their photovoltaic performance as well as the reliability of this technology. Besides, organic forms of Pb in hybrid perovskite materials are extremely dangerous due to ease of dissolution or absorption through human skin, and the inherent toxicity of Pb perovskites can potentially cause severe environmental pollution and serious threat to human health.5 Recent studies have shown that Pb contamination in soil and water is an irreversible process and imposes negative impacts on the survival of all natural organisms.6,7 These aforementioned issues represent the main limiting factors and major obstacles to scalable production of Pb-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this context, some alternative cations, such as tin (Sn2+), germanium (Ge2+), antimony (Sb3+) and bismuth (Bi3+), were explored in Pb-free thin film solar cells.8 Due to superior stability and low toxicity, many groups have been working to investigate Bi-based materials as well as solar cell performance.9,10 Perovskites with Bi3+ have similar electronic configuration ([Xe] 4f145d106s26p0) to Pb2+, and the stable 6S2 valence electron enables the formation of stable Bi3+.11 Theoretical simulation has predicted the remarkable optoelectronic properties and promising photovoltaic performance of Bi-based perovskites.12,13 To date, various compositions including MA3Bi2I9 (MA = methylammonium),14 FA3Bi2I9 (FA = formamidinium),15 Cs3Bi2I9,13 and ABi3I10 (A = MA+, FA+, Cs+)16 have been explored as light absorbers in solar cells.13 Among these, all-inorganic CsBi3I10 (CBI) represents one of the most promising candidates due to its appropriate band gap (1.77 eV), solution processability and high light absorption,16 but little attention has been paid to optimizing its material properties and device performance. In spite of some brief studies in solvent engineering and device architecture, the photovoltaic performance of CBI is far lower than that of its Pb counterparts.17 For example, Song et al. reported CBI thin film solar cells based on a mesoporous carbon structure which exhibited so far the highest reported PCE of 1.51%, but the CBI films showed poor quality.16 Recently, Islam and co-workers prepared nickel oxide by spray pyrolysis as a hole transporter in inverted devices in order to improve the crystallinity of CBI thin films, but the devices only attained an efficiency of 0.72%.12 Some other attempts have been made to optimize the fabrication process and device structures, but most of them relied on traditional spin coating methods and showed inferior performance.2,10,17–19 Based on previous experiences, one major reason for inferior device performance is the poor film morphology coupled with a high number of defects, which led to insufficient charge collection efficiency at interfaces.20 The deposition of perovskite thin films heavily relies on the spin-coating method, and the anti-solvent (AS) technique is often introduced to control crystallization kinetics and modify film quality.21 However, because of the low solubility of Bi-based precursors in common solvents and fast crystallization, challenges remain in fundamentally modulating the crystallization kinetics of CBI, and there is a clear need to develop new strategies to improve film quality as well as solar cell performance.
Considering these challenges, we developed a versatile technology, namely gas quenching assisted anti-solvent (GQAS), to fabricate CBI thin films in order to fine modulate the crystallization process. The GQAS method imposes a decisive effect on nucleation and film growth, and produces high-quality CBI films with higher density, few pinholes and higher conductivity, as compared to the conventional AS method. Moreover, a novel additive strategy was introduced by incorporating 1,3-bis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]thiourea (FS) into precursor solution, which endows the CBI film with higher crystallinity, stronger light absorption and better water stability. Based on systematical characterization, the complementary effects and working mechanism of GQAS and FS have been proposed. Synergistic cooperation between GQAS and FS promotes a significant improvement of charge collection efficiency, leading to a 10 times higher PCEs in CBI solar cells. This work provides an effective strategy to adjust the film microstructure and optoelectronic properties, and opens a generally applicable way to improve the efficiency and stability of Pb-free thin film solar cells.
Results and discussion
Additive engineering is an efficient approach to modify precursor coordination and control perovskite crystallization, in terms of grain growth rates, defect formation and film stability. A previous study has shown that a sulfur-containing Lewis base forms coordination with Bi3+ and passivate defects,22 for example 3-(decyldimethylammonio)-propane-sulfonate inner salt,23N-(4-bromophenyl)thiourea.16 In addition, additives with fluorine (F) element exhibit outstanding hydrophobic function, which is conducive to inhibiting water ingress.24 Inspired by this, we introduced a multifunctional organic molecule FS (Fig. 1a) into CBI films. The additive FS with multiple F elements is expected to show hydrophobic properties, suppressing the uptake of moisture into CBI. The sulfur (S) is supposed to modulate the crystallization and passivate the defects via forming coordination with Bi3+ at the grain boundary. The possible working mechanism of FS is displayed in Fig. 1b.

(c) UV-vis absorption spectra of the solution based on FS, FS–BiI3 and FS–CsI–BiI3 (the inset shows the photographs of solutions). (d) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the solution with FS, FS–BiI3 and FS–CsI–BiI3, and the expanded fingerprint region for the CS stretching vibrations (e). 
To probe the chemical interaction between FS and CBI precursors, we measured the UV-vis absorption of the solutions based on FS, FS–BiI3 and FS–CsI–BiI3, as exhibited in Fig. 1c. The inset images of the solutions clearly show a significant color change, which is consistent with their UV-vis spectra. The FS solution was transparent, while BiI3 and CsI–BiI3 solutions with FS were cloudy black and red, which indicates that a strong chemical interaction is probably existed between FS and BiI3 (Fig. 1c). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed to further study the chemical interaction between FS and BiI3. Fig. 1d displays the FTIR spectra of FS, the FS–BiI3 complex, and the FS–CsI–BiI3 complex with their corresponding expanded fingerprint region for the CS stretching vibrations (Fig. 1e). Specifically, the stretching vibration of CS at 665 cm−1 originates from FS molecules. The corresponding CS stretching vibration peak shifted to 660 cm−1 and 659 cm−1 for FS–BiI3 and FS–CsI–BiI3, respectively. This was mainly attributed to the fact that the coordination between BiI3 and FS reduced the bonding strength of CS, resulting in the reduction of the tensile vibration frequency of CS, which is similar to the PbI2–thiourea coordination effects.25,26 Furthermore, the CS stretching vibration in FS–CsI–BiI3 (659 cm−1) is slightly lower than that of FS–BiI3 (660 cm−1), indicating additional interactions between CsI and Bi3+. The coordinating complex formed by BiI3 and FS reagents likely plays critical roles in crystal nucleation and growth,27 which will be discussed later.

Fig. 2a illustrates the fabrication process of CBI-based films by GQAS. Different from the conventional AS method, a gas quenching (GQ) step by applying a N2 gas flow on wet films was introduced after dripping anti-solvents. Solvents in the precursor solution showed essential effects in adjusting film quality, therefore, we firstly optimized the solvent composition of the CBI solution via varying the volume ratio of DMF/DMSO from 10% to 100%, as shown in Fig. S1.† The images of CBI films made from different solvents are exhibited in Fig. 2b, showing a notable color change from dark to light brown. We also examined their structural evolution by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as demonstrated in Fig. 2b. The XRD patterns of CBI films were consistent with those reported previously.28 It is noted that the increase of DMF ratio induced a gradual increase of peak intensity at 2θ = 12.6°, particularly when the ratio of DMF/DMSO reached 9:1 and 1:0. The enhanced peak intensity suggests that CBI films with higher crystallinity were obtained, which is likely attributed to more rapid nucleation due to faster solvent evaporation of DMF-rich solution (Fig. S2†). This phenomenon is similarly reported in previous work.28 We further examined the solvent effects on film properties by measuring their UV-vis absorption, as displayed in Fig. S3.† Similarly, when the ratio of DMF/DMSO reached 9:1, the CBI film showed the highest light absorption capability, indicating that denser films with fewer defects were likely obtained under this condition. Therefore, an optimal solvent composition with DMF/DMSO = 9:1 was employed in the following study.

(b) The photos and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of CBI films made from different precursor solutions with varying DMF/DMSO ratios. (c) The photos and XRD spectra of CBI films with different ratios of FS. (d) UV-vis absorption spectra, (e) XRD patterns and (f) steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films based on pristine CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2. Note: 20% FS introduced into CBI is denoted as 20-FS–CBI; the film made by GQAS is named 20-FS–CBI–N2. 
As seen in Fig. 1d, the incorporation of FS into the CBI precursor solution induced strong coordination. The roles of FS in CBI film formation and properties are systematically explored by tuning the FS concentration. As noted from the film images in Fig. 2c, a significant color change from light brown to dark after annealing was observed, indicating transition to the CBI crystalline phase. In comparison to the pristine CBI film, the FS-based films became darker with the introduction of more FS from 5% to 40%, which may suggest that FS played essential roles in the CBI crystallization process. Observed from XRD spectra, FS incorporation promoted a significant rise in the typical CBI crystal peak at 2θ = 12.6°, as well as an increase of light absorbance, especially when the FS proportion lies in the range of 5–20% (Fig. S4†). The stronger XRD peaks of FS–CBI than the pristine CBI further indicates that FS facilitates film formation with higher crystallinity. As illustrated in previous work, Bi–S coordination could suppress rapid nucleation and leave more time for grain growth, which favors larger grain formation. The optical bandgap of CBI films was further evaluated by performing UV-vis absorption, as shown in Fig. S5.† Estimated from the Tauc diagram, CBI films exhibited a bandgap of 1.75 eV, as similarly reported previously, revealing their high potential to act as efficient light absorbing materials. The optimal condition with 20% FS (coded as 20-FS–CBI) was used in the latter optimization. To further fine adjust the crystallization process, we introduced the GQAS method by applying a high-pressure gas flow on the 20-FS–CBI film (coded as 20-FS–CBI–N2) during spin coating in order to control the nucleation and film growth. Fig. 2d and e demonstrate the UV-vis absorption and XRD spectra of CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 films. It is noted that more than 200% and 150% enhancement of absorption capacity were obtained for 20-FS–CBI–N2 and 20-FS–CBI compared to the pristine CBI, which reveals that the GQAS method promotes high crystallinity and film quality. To probe the defects associated non-radiative recombination in CBI films, steady state photoluminescence (PL) has been performed on different CBI films at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 2f. All films exhibited PL peaks at about 700 nm which originates from the radiative recombination. In a comparison of their PL intensities, we observed that the PL peak strength of 20-FS–CBI film is much stronger than that of the pristine CBI film, suggesting that the introduction of FS can effectively inhibit the non-radiative recombination, as exhibited in Fig. 2f. In contrast, the 20-FS–CBI–N2 film showed the strongest PL compared to the other two films, indicating that the GQAS process can efficiently suppress the non-radiative recombination losses in CBI films by engineering the crystallization process.29 The working mechanism of GQAS will be discussed later. Besides, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves of the pristine CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 thin films are given in Fig. S6,† and the fitted average carrier lifetimes (τave) are listed in Table S1† (estimated by the bi-exponential equation). The films based on 20-FS–CBI–N2 displayed the highest τave (11.95 ns) compared to 20-FS–CBI (2.43 ns) and CBI films (3.55 ns), revealing the longest carrier lifetime for the films made by the GQAS method. These results clearly illustrate that the synergistic effects of the FS additive and GQAS can effectively reduce the defect density and enhance the film quality. The poor film quality (e.g. high surface roughness and high pinhole density) of CBI has been widely recognized as the bottleneck of its photovoltaic performance, therefore, the changes in the microstructure of CBI films were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). From Fig. 3a we noted that the surface morphology of the untreated CBI thin film exhibited porous structures with low film density and large voids, as similarly observed previously.28 Similarly, an uneven grain size with low uniformity was observed for the CBI film treated with the GQAS method (CBI–N2). In comparison, after applying the GQAS method to the CBI film, the voids in the films can be greatly reduced and the grains became larger. When FS was introduced in the film, the 20-FS–CBI sample exhibited much higher uniformity and film density compared to the CBI film. However, some pinholes were still visible in the case of the 20-FS–CBI film. The surface morphologies of CBI films with different FS doping ratios characterized by SEM are shown in Fig. S7,† which further demonstrated that 20% incorporation of FS is the optimal condition for the film morphology. The film based on 20-FS–CBI–N2 (Fig. S8†) demonstrated remarkable quality by showing a high surface coverage, overall uniformity, high compactness and few pinholes, all of which are essential for charge collection and device performance.

The film uniformity and surface roughness present another approach to evaluate the film compactness and quality. As seen from the AFM images in Fig. 3b, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the pristine CBI film (39.74 nm) was reduced to 33.18 nm and 27.58 nm for 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 films, respectively. It suggests that both FS addition and GQAS are effective to improve the film quality and microstructures. We also measured the AFM spectra of the GQAS treated CBI film, showing a reduced RMS of 34.06 nm, which further verified the positive role of GQAS in improving film uniformity. The electronic properties of the formed CBI films were examined by conductive AFM (c-AFM), as given in Fig. 3c. According to the electrical current mapping on different films, we noted a significantly enhanced electrical conductivity in the order of 20-FS–CBI–N2 > 20-FS–CBI > CBI–N2 > CBI. This reveals that the cooperation of FS and GQAS is highly beneficial for the improvement of electrical properties. We further examined the conducting features of these films by measuring their resistivity through a four-point probe, as exhibited in Fig. S9.† A high resistivity of 146.98 × 109 Ω m was obtained for the pristine CBI film, which agrees well with the low current density in c-AFM mapping. In contrast, six orders of magnitude lower resistivity (449.41 × 103 Ω m) was achieved for the 20-FS–CBI film, evidencing that the introduction of FS additives can effectively improve the conductivity of the material. Encouragingly, the resistivity of the 20-FS–CBI–N2 film (232.06 × 100 Ω m) is three orders of magnitude lower than that of 20–FS–CBI. Similarly, the resistivity of CBI–N2 is greatly reduced compared to that of the CBI film, which further reveals the improvement of film quality by GQAS. The significantly reduced resistivity in the case of 20-FS–CBI–N2 guarantees sufficient charge transport and collection in the devices.
Film surface properties play a critical role in the environmental stability of CBI films, and FS incorporation is supposed to enhance the film hydrophobicity and stability. To examine this, the water contact angles (CA) of the films with CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 were measured, as revealed in Fig. 4a. FS introduction in the CBI film significantly caused an increase of film CA from 76.6° to 81.0°, and GQAS enabled a further enhancement of CA to 85.3°. The improved CA suggests that both FS incorporation and GQAS favor the achievement of high film hydrophobicity, which can be mainly attributed to the hydrophobic nature of FS molecules as well as high film compactness. The water stability of CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 films was briefly investigated by fully immersing these thin films in water at room temperature, as presented in Fig. 4b. It is noted that the black CBI films degraded to yellow after only 10 s, indicating a fast reaction between the CBI crystals and water molecules to likely form hydrate products. In contrast, the 20-FS–CBI film exhibited a higher stability by maintaining the dark feature for 30 s. In contrast, the 20-FS–CBI–N2 thin film demonstrated the best stability by showing undetectable changes in the film color after 70 s under the same conditions. Furthermore, the structural stability of these thin films in an ambient environment was monitored for 6 days. Fig. 4c shows a substantial reduction of the XRD characteristic peak at 2θ = 12.6°, suggesting fast structural deformation under ambient conditions. In contrast, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 thin films can maintain about 92% and nearly 100% of the initial XRD intensity, respectively. The detailed XRD spectra changes are displayed in Fig. S10–S12.† We also recorded the images of the corresponding films with different times, as illustrated in Fig. 4d. A clear film change to brown was observed for CBI films after 4 days, however, no notable color change was seen for the 20-FS–CBI–N2 thin film after 6 days, indicating GQAS enabled outstanding water stability and environmental stability.

Based on the above results, we proposed a working mechanism of FS additives and the GQAS method, as illustrated in Fig. 5. According to previous reports, the major challenge limiting the CBI film performance is the poor film morphology with pinholes and low uniformity, as shown in Fig. 5a. We believe that uncontrollable nucleation and growth determine the poor film quality. In the process of standard anti-solvent, the nucleation rate of CBI crystals is relatively low, leading to a small quantity of nucleation sites. Such a low concentration of nuclei provides a large room for grain growth in the annealing step, resulting in random and disordered crystal growth. This mechanism endows the film with disconnected grains and large voids/pinholes, as seen in Fig. 3a. After the introduction of FS additives in the CBI precursor, the coordinating interaction between FS and BiI3 can effectively slow down the grain growth, and in the meantime facilitate reaching supersaturation for the nuclei formation, as exhibited in Fig. 5b. The incorporation of FS does not only modulate the crystallization kinetics and film quality, but also effectively passivate the defects at the grain boundaries of film (Fig. 5b). The GQAS method can further modify the nucleation process by introducing another driving force for the solvent evaporation and solution supersaturation. The accelerated solvent evaporation induces a high concentration of nuclei, and favors the formation of dense, uniform, pinhole free films, as seen in Fig. 5c. Besides, the FS molecules with high hydrophobicity favors the protection of perovskite from environmental moisture, enhancing water stability. Significantly, the synergistic effect of FS and GQAS leads to a CBI film with high density, good uniformity, few pinholes and high compactness, which induces a significant increase of electrical conductivity, defect reduction and film stability.

The photovoltaic performances of CBI films were tested in n-i-p device configuration of FTO glass/SnO2/CBI/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in Fig. 6a. The cross-sectional SEM images of devices based on CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 demonstrated that a similar thickness of about 650 nm was obtained for all three cases. A much denser film with clear interfaces was recorded for 20-FS–CBI–N2, which is consistent with the observed high film compactness without pinholes (Fig. 3a). The corresponding energy level alignment in CBI solar cells is displayed in Fig. 6b according to previous reports, meaning that the CBI thin film presents favorable energy levels matching well with both electron and hole transport materials. Fig. 6c exhibits the effects of FS concentration on solar cell performance. The pristine CBI film showed a poor PCE of about 0.1% on average. The low PCE of the CBI film is mainly caused by poor film quality with voids and pinholes (Fig. 3a). After incorporation of FS, a great enhancement of PCE was found with the increase in FS concentration from 5–20%. High PCEs of over 0.4% were achieved for 20-FS–CBI–N2. Further addition of FS induced a PCE reduction. The statistics of other photovoltaic parameters (short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit potential (Voc) and fill factor (FF)) of different solar cells are collected in Fig. S13† and listed in Table S2.† The maximum PCE was reached for 20-FS–CBI, which agrees well with its superior optoelectronic properties, including high crystallinity, good film quality, strong light absorption, and a low number of defects.

(g) Impedance (Rrec) of three kinds of perovskite solar cells at different bias voltages. 

Fig. 6d shows a comparison of the PCE statistics for CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2. Clearly, GQAS enabled a significant PCE increase to 0.8% on average, which is about 800% and 400% enhancement compared to those of CBI and 20-FS–CBI. The J–V curves of champion CBI thin film solar cells are presented in Fig. 6e, and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 1 and Fig. S14.† The best-performing CBI device showed a Voc of 322 mV, Jsc of 0.787 mA cm−2, and FF of 40.52%, yielding a PCE of 0.102%. The device with 20-FS–CBI showed a maximum PCE of 0.462% (Voc = 540 mV, Jsc = 2.35 mA cm−2, FF = 36.39%). Encouragingly, the device with 20-FS–CBI–N2 delivered a highest PCE of 0.97% (1.03% for reverse scan as shown in Fig. S15†), with a Voc of 454 mV, Jsc of 5.84 mA cm−2, and FF of 36.67%. It has to be noted that the J–V hysteresis in devices with 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 is greatly reduced compared to that of CBI, which may be attributed to their relatively high film density and a low number of defects. Evidently, the improvement of PCEs in devices with 20-FS–CBI–N2 is mainly gained from the increase of Jsc, which represents one of the highest reported values. Table S3† summarizes the recent development of photovoltaic performance for CsBi3I10 thin film solar cells. According to the factors influencing Jsc (e.g. light harvesting efficiency, interfacial charge transfer efficiency and charge collection efficiency), we suggest that high Jsc in the case of 20-FS–CBI–N2 can be attributed to three factors: (1) the incorporation of FS molecules into CBI solution induces the coordination with BiI3 enabling altering of the crystallization kinetics, which induces an increase of light harvesting efficiency, as suggested by high UV-vis absorption (Fig. 2d); (2) the GQAS approach facilitates the formation of a dense film with few voids or pinholes and reduces charge transport barriers, as evidenced by Fig. 3c; (3) the film with high uniformity and a low number of defects favors the suppression of non-radiative recombination losses, as illustrated in Fig. 2f; (4) the film with FS and GQAS showed enhanced electrical conductivity, providing high charge collection efficiency.

To confirm the improved interfacial transport properties, electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectra were measured on the complete devices by applying a bias potential of 0.5 V in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz under one sun illumination. The Nyquist plots of solar cells based on CBI, 20-FS–CBI and 20-FS–CBI–N2 are shown in Fig. 6f. The EIS spectra can provide essential information on the interfacial resistance in the device.30 As illustrated in the equivalent circuit of the Nyquist diagram, Rs represents the series resistance of the whole device, Rrec denotes the recombination impedance at the interfaces, and CPE expresses the constant phase element, respectively. According to the fitted results, the device of 20-FS–CBI exhibited a much larger Rrec than CBI, and 20-FS–CBI–N2 based devices showed the largest Rrec. These results indicate that the introduction of FS and GQAS is beneficial to inhibit the charge recombination in CBI solar cells, which agrees well with the PL results in Fig. 2f. To confirm this observation, the Rrec values of devices under bias voltages of 0.5 V, 0.8 V and 1.0 V were extracted and are shown in Fig. 6g. Similarly, 20-FS–CBI–N2 based devices demonstrated the largest Rrec at all voltages compared to those with CBI and 20-FS–CBI, indicating that cooperating effects from FS and GQAS induce efficient charge collection efficiency in the devices.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a versatile strategy and multifunctional molecular incorporation to modulate the crystallization process of CBI thin films. The introduction of FS additives into the CBI precursor solution can induce ion coordination, which enabled the formation of CBI films with high light absorption capacity, improved film quality and water stability. The GQAS process can further optimize the supersaturated level of the precursor during crystallization, which contributes to a high-quality thin film with few pinholes, high conductivity, fewer defects and remarkable environmental stability. As a result, devices based on FS and GQAS exhibited a PCE of over 1%, which is about one order of magnitude higher than that of pristine CBI devices. Besides, we proposed a working mechanism of FS incorporation and GQAS, which provides new insights to further manage the crystallization kinetics and film quality. We believe that this strategy opens up a new pathway to fabricate bismuth-based thin films with a satisfactory film morphology and stability, showing great promise to further enhance the efficiency and stability of Pb-free thin film solar cells.
