, Accepted 13th October 2016First published on 26th October 2016AbstractWe report a new facile strategy to enhance the efficiency of TiO2 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using Nb-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes with carbon nanotube-derived TiO2 nanotubes (CDTs). Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with an average diameter of 80 nm are used as the template to produce CDTs through facile sol–gel and oxidation processes at 600 °C. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses reveal that the synthesized CDTs have a uniform thickness of 60–120 nm and a crystallite size of 17 nm. We prepare Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with different atomic ratios of 0–4 at% Nb and test them as photo-electrodes to investigate the doping effects on electron–hole separation and electron injection. X-Ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) show that Nb5+ ions are well doped into Ti–O lattice without any secondary phases. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.87% is observed for 3 at% Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (DN3%). Furthermore, different percentages of CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes (0–20 wt%) are introduced into the optimal Nb-doped electrode (DN3%) to improve the electron transportation. An increase of 32% in cell efficiency is obtained for the DSSC composed of the optimal content of CDTs compared with the DSSC made of pure TiO2 nanoparticles. We obtain the highest photovoltaic performance (i.e., PCE of 9.02% and short current density of 18.83 mA cm−2) for a mixture of 3 at% Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and 5 wt% CDT. Such enhancements are attributed to a higher photo-response by introducing additional energy levels within the band gap of TiO2 as well as providing a direct way for electron transportation to occur in the photoelectrode.
1. Introduction
An increasing concern as technology develops is how to harness renewable energies in an economic and efficient way. Photovoltaic devices are the most promising alternatives to fossil fuels. Since the achievement by Gratzel et al. in 1991,1 many researchers, authorities, policy-makers, and companies all over the world consider dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a way of meeting energy demands. DSSCs are an electrochemical cell in which the photoanode of the cell is a semiconductor with an appropriate band gap, conventionally TiO2, which can be photo-sensitized by dye molecules. Photo-excited dye molecules produce electrons injected through the conductive band of the semiconductor, and are subsequently reduced through a redox couple in a liquid electrolyte and a counter electrode to complete the circuit. Solid-state DSSCs using solid-state electrolytes have also been reported.2 In order to reach higher efficiencies, straight paths for photo-electrons are required to suppress charge recombination. Focusing on the benefits of one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures such as nanotubes,3–5 nanowires6,7 or nanorods8,9 many researchers reported significant improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by incorporating 1D structures into TiO2 nanoparticle-based photoanodes. Yen et al.4 prepared TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) by a reflux method and showed that the efficiency of a DSSC was significantly improved to 10.27% by adding 10 vol% TNTs to TiO2 nanoparticle-based photoanodes. This was explained as an enhancement in the electron transport properties of the anode, charge collection, and light harvesting. Recently, Lee et al.10 fabricated DSSCs with different ratios of TiO2 nanowires to nanoparticles and reported an efficiency improvement from 6.41% to 7.34% as a results of efficient charge transport. Zhao et al.11 prepared TiO2 nanotube/nanoparticle composite electrodes with different ratios. In spite of dye adsorption decrement, they demonstrated an efficiency improvement from 6.83% to 7.13% due to a lower recombination rate and the longer life of electrons.
Many different approaches have been used to prepare TNTs for DSSC photoanodes, such as anodization,12,13 template assisted methods14,15 and hydrothermal methods.16,17 While many of these techniques are expensive and time consuming, researchers have functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the preparation of 1D TiO2 nanostructures through a facile template assisted sol–gel method, specifically for DSSC applications. Eder et al.18 prepared TiO2 nanotubes using benzyl alcohol as a surfactant to enable TiO2 to interact with the hydrophobic surface of pristine CNTs without the need of covalent functionalization. In a different work they reported rutile and anatase TiO2 nanotubes derived from multi-walled CNTs and investigated their photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of propene.19 They also suggested the structure as the support for Pt catalysts.20
In addition to preparing 1D TiO2 nanostructures to improve the PCE, many researchers have asserted that doping a foreign element, especially metallic ions, into the titanium dioxide based photoanode enhances the charge transfer, minimizes the recombination of excitons, and prolongs the electron lifetime by different mechanisms such as lowering band gap energies, forming subsidiary Fermi levels as donors or acceptors, which leads to the higher rates of electron injection. Various dopants such as Nb,21 Zn,22 Cr,23 Ce,24 Cu25 and N26 attracted the great attention of researchers due to their substantial positive influence on the photocatalytic properties of TiO2. Nb5+ has one more valance electron than Ti4+, producing donors below the conductive band edge of TiO2, so there would be a shorter gap distance from the donor level to the conductive band which results in the easier migration of injected electrons and, therefore, better separation of electrons and holes. Yang et al.27 reported higher solar photocatalytic activity using 5% Nb-doped TiO2 microspheres due to a change in the energy gap between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of dye molecules and the Fermi energy level (EF) of Nb-doped TiO2, reducing the recombination rate of carriers and improving the electron injection rates. They suggested narrowed band gap energies by adding Nb ions comparing to undoped TiO2 nanoparticles, extending the light absorption range, suppressing the recombination of electrons and holes. Long et al.21 prepared Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles by hydrothermal methods. They reported the highest PEC of 8.77% for 2% Nb-doped TiO2 containing small amounts of rutile (7.9 wt%). Similarly, Horie et al.28 added electrospun nanofibers (ES-NFs) of TiO2 and Nb-doped TiO2 (NTO) to the TiO2 mesoporous layer in the photoelectrode of DSSCs. They observed an enhancement of the photocurrent (6% and 8% for ES-NFs of TiO2 and NTO, respectively) due to band bending at the interface of TiO2/NTO.
So far, no significant work has been reported on CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes doped with Nb ions as photoanode electrodes for DSSCs applications. Therefore, we studied both electron injection and electron transportation for the improvement of DSSCs aided by doping Nb into CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes. The weight ratio of TiO2 nanoparticles to nanotubes as well as the Nb atomic concentration were also tailored to obtain the optimum cell efficiency.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of Nb-doped TiO2 sols and powders
In a typical experiment, TiO2 sols were prepared according to the method reported in our previous work.29 Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) with a purity of 97% (Aldrich, UK) was used as a titanium precursor; analytical grade hydrochloric acid (HCl) 37% (Fisher, UK) was used as a catalyst for the peptisation and deionised water was used as a dispersing media. The water–acid mixture (pH = 2) was stabilized at 70 °C under reflux system. A clear TiO2 sol was gradually formed after adding TTIP. The TiO2 sol with a concentration of 0.4 M was prepared with TTIP:HCl:H2O molar ratio of 1:0.5:351.
For the preparation of Nb-doped TiO2 sols, niobium(V) chloride (NbCl5) with a normal purity of 99% (Aldrich, UK) was dissolved in the TiO2 sol with different Nb percentages in the range of 0–4 at%. The sols were then heated at 50 °C for 24 h to obtain as-synthesized Nb-doped TiO2 powders. Subsequently, the as-synthesized powders were annealed at 450 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere to achieve crystalline powders.
2.2. Preparation of CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes
In order to prepare CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes (i.e., CDT), multi-walled carbon nanotubes were used as the template (Aldrich, UK) and coated via a sol–gel process and subsequently oxidized by heat treatment in air atmosphere, analogous to the procedure reported previously.18 In a typical experiment, CNTs were dispersed in ethanol (EtOH) with the aid of ultrasonication for 10 minutes. Benzyl alcohol (BA, Aldrich, UK) and H2O were then added and the solution was stirred at 0 °C. Afterwards, TTIP was dissolved in ethanol and slowly dropped into the CNT suspension so that the final molar ratio of a mixture of TTIP:BA:EtOH:H2O was 1:5:30:6. After one hour of stirring, the precipitates were filtered, washed in ethanol and dried at 60 °C in oven for 12 h. Afterwards, TiO2-coated CNTs were heated at 600 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere to obtain CDTs.
2.3. Preparation of DSSCs
Two categories of TiO2 DSSCs, with an average thickness of 19 μm, were fabricated in order to study the effect of CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes (i.e., CDTs) into Nb-doped TiO2 photoelectrodes on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. For both categories, the required pastes were prepared by mixing the synthesized powders, the solvent, the dispersing agents, and binders according to the procedure reported in our previous work.30 A thin TiO2 blocking layer was deposited on F-doped SnO2 (FTO, 14 Ω sq.−1) substrates immersed in a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 (Aldrich, UK) at 70 °C for 15 min and sintered at 450 °C for 30 minutes in an air atmosphere.31 The first category of DSSCs is comprised of five different electrodes with various x = Nb/(Nb + TiO2) atomic percentages, deposited on the FTO substrate by a spin coating method, as listed in Table 1. The optimal Nb atomic ratio was determined by the photovoltaic characteristics of the mono-layer DSSCs. The second category consists of five different photoelectrodes in the form of mixed films by adding different weight ratios of CDTs to optimal Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e., DN3%) in the range of 0–20 wt%. The films were annealed at 450 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere. The films were again treated with TiCl4 solution and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to improve interfacial contact of dye molecules with the nanocrystalline TiO2. Dye sensitization was performed by immersing completely dried films in 0.5 mM N-719 dye (Dyesol, UK) solution (mixture of acetonitrile and methanol, volume ratio: 1:1) at room temperature for 18 h in a dark room. The sensitized electrodes were washed with acetonitrile and dried in air. The counter electrode was platinized by applying a drop of 5 mM H2PtCl6·6H2O in isopropanol solution onto a conducting glass substrate and annealing in air at 450 °C for 15 min. The DSSCs were assembled by sandwiching the working and counter electrodes using a 60 μm thick thermoplastic frame (Surlyn 1601, Dupont). The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in 1:1 acetonitrile/valeronitrile.

2.4. Characterization and measurements
The morphology of TiO2-based photoanodes was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) HITACHI SU8000 and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) JOEL 2100F. The thickness of the films was measured with a Tensor Alpha-step Profiler. Raman analyses were carried out by incident light of tunable argon laser with a wavelength of 523 nm focused on the sample by means of a 100× objective of 0.9 numerical aperture. The spot is around 3 μm diameter while the beam intensity is 1 mW. X-ray diffraction diffractometer (XRD) was performed by D8 Discover Bruker AXS GmbH, Cu-Kα. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed under ultrahigh vacuum on a ESCA PHI 5000 VersaProbe to study doping systems. All binding energies (Eb) were calibrated with contaminant carbon (C 1s = 285 eV) as a reference. The photovoltaic measurements of the fabricated solar cells were carried out using a solar simulator under white light irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructure
Fig. 1 shows FE-SEM images of the preparation steps of CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes (CDTs). An FE-SEM micrograph of the pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) without further processing, such as functionalization, is shown in Fig. 1a. It can be observed that the average diameter of the CNTs is about 80 nm with the average length around 5 microns. Fig. 1b illustrates that TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the surface of the functionalized CNTs, forming TiO2–CNT hybrid structures (TCHs). The surface of the hybrid is smooth and uniform which confirms the surface noncovalent functionalizing of CNTs by aromatic molecules of benzyl alcohol, and further hydrolysis by water molecules. The thickness of the deposited TiO2 film depends on sol–gel processing parameters and CNTs:TiO2 ratio. For example, for a CNTs:TiO2 weight ratio of 1:10, the thickness of the TiO2 film varies between 60–120 nm. Moreover, the average diameter of the prepared TiO2–CNT hybrids is approximately 200–300 nm. The weakness of π–π interactions in some parts of CNTs yields crack formation and discontinuity in the deposited film. Fig. 1c shows the morphology of CDTs after heat treatment of the hybrids at 600 °C in air atmosphere. The image reveals that CNTs oxidize to CO2 and CO gases, and consequently the template is easily removed from the structure, to produce pure TiO2 nanotubes. According to the literature,20 heating at temperatures below 550 °C does not entirely remove the CNTs. However, the required temperature for the elimination of the CNTs is decreased in the presence of TiO2. The results reveal that after eliminating the template, the nanotube structure is preserved and no discrete TiO2 particles (which may remain due to cracks formed in the earlier steps) are observed.

To accurately corroborate the FE-SEM results and prove the tubular and hollow structure of CDTs, TEM analysis was performed. Fig. 2 presents high magnification of one single tube. The details of the outermost layer of the CDTs observable in the image indicate that the structure of the hollow tube is preserved after heat treatment. As can be observed in Fig. 2a, uniform deposition of TiO2 on the surface of CNTs without any apparent aggregation accompanying the dense morphology was obtained. After heat treatment at 600 °C a tubular and hollow structure along the entire length of CDTs were discernible (Fig. 2b). It is conceivable that the oxidization starts from intrinsic defects in the CNTs. The crystalline feature and growth of TiO2 nanoparticles after heating is somewhat perceptible in the TEM images, compared to the as-prepared TiO2. After removal of CNTs, the inner diameter of the CDTs remains almost constant, indicating that it is not affected by crystallization and phase transformation during heat treatment. The inner and outer diameters of CDTs are in good agreement with those obtained from FE-SEM results.

3.2. Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra were obtained (Fig. 3) at the wide range of 0–1800 cm−1 spectral region for the uncoated sample, the TiO2 coated CNTs (i.e., TCHs) and CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes (CDTs). The Raman spectrum of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Fig. 3a) shows two main graphite peaks at 1582 and 1350 cm−1 which are assigned to the graphite G band of the C–C bond and the D mode activated by disorders in the CNT lattice structure, respectively. A peak at 139.8 cm−1 is attributed to the radial breathing mode (RBM). Fig. 3b presents the corresponding Raman spectrum of the CNTs–TiO2 hybrid structures (i.e., TCH) annealed at 450 °C for 2 h in order to show the TiO2 peaks. A strong peak belonging to TiO2 appears at 146 cm−1 (Eg) accompanied by a small peak at 197 cm−1 (Eg) and the remaining peaks at 395 (B1g), 513 (A1g) and 635 (Eg) cm−1 are related to the anatase structure. The blue shift of the intense peak may be attributed to defects such as vacancies that cause nonstoichiometry in the TiO2 lattice or the surface strain due to the adsorption of the BA surfactant.32 After annealing at 600 °C (Fig. 3c), the G band peak of the CNTs is eliminated as a result of the CNT removal. Compared to TCH which is a pure anatase phase, a new peak at 448 cm−1 is detected which is attributed to the rutile phase. Therefore, the anatase to rutile phase transformation occurs at this temperature. The dominance of these peaks (anatase/rutile) followed by XRD analysis reveals that the structure is mainly composed of the anatase phase with a small amount of rutile structure.

3.3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
Fig. 4 illustrates the XRD patterns of 450 °C annealed Nb-doped TiO2 films with various atomic ratios of Nb content in the range of 0–4%. XRD patterns of all samples show pure anatase phase by dominant peaks at 2θ = 25.3° with no peak attributed to niobium oxide or other Nb compounds. This implies that Nb5+ ions are possibly doped in the TiO2 lattice, which is confirmed by XPS analysis (see Section 3.4.). Such substitution can be related to the low difference between the ionic diameters of Nb5+ (0.64 Å) and Ti4+ ions (0.60 Å). The average crystallite size of the phases was calculated by the Scherrer equation:33 
(1)where d is the crystallite size, k is a dimensionless shape factor which has a typical value of 0.9, λ is the X-ray wavelength of Cu-Kα which is 1.5406 Å, θ is the Bragg angle in degree and, B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak. As expected, Nb introduction has no influence on phase composition of TiO2. The main impact of Nb addition into the TiO2 nanoparticle is the decrease in crystallite size. Therefore, incorporating the Nb dopant into the TiO2 structure hinders crystallite growth. The crystallite size slowly decreases from 11.4 to 10.1 nm by addition of Nb content up to 4 at%.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of 450 °C annealed Nb-doped TiO2 films with various Nb atomic ratios: (a) 0 at% Nb, (b) 1 at% Nb, (c) 2 at% Nb, (d) 3 at% Nb and (e) 4 at% Nb. 
Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized CNT–TiO2 hybrid structure dried at 60 °C and CNT-derived TiO2 structures after heat treatment at 600 °C. Before heat treatment, no diffraction peak is observed which indicates that the as-prepared hybrid structure is amorphous. The curvy shape in the pattern is likely due to the presence of CNTs in the structure of hybrids. By heating upon 350 °C for 2 h, the TiO2 coating starts to crystallize into anatase phase,34 and diffraction peaks emerge. The major peaks in the pattern exclusively conform to the anatase phase (JSPDS card 01-071-1166). However, phase transformation to the rutile phase is observed with a small peak at 2θ = 27.4° attributed to the (1 1 0) planes (JSPDS card 01-078-1510). Another peak at 2θ = 41° also contributed to the rutile phase. Consequently, heat treatment at 600 °C for 2 h removes all templates and can be defined as the optimum temperature since annealing at higher temperatures causes crystal growth and reduction in the specific surface area.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of: (a) CNT–TiO2 hybrid structure and (b) CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes (CDTs). 
The content of anatase (fa) and rutile (fr) in the crystal structure can be calculated based on the relationship between the integrated intensities of anatase (1 0 1) and rutile (1 1 0) peaks by the following formula:35 
(2)where Ia and Ir are the integrated peak intensities of the anatase and rutile peaks, respectively.
The ratio of anatase to rutile content is 97:3, which shows that the amount of transformation is negligible. The synergistic effect between anatase and rutile significantly improves the photovoltaic activity of TiO2.36 The presence of rutile phase extends the photoactive response to the visible region and stabilizes the charge separation by electron transfer from rutile to anatase trapping sites, which reduces the recombination process.37 Using the Scherrer formula, the crystallite size of CDTs is calculated to be 17 nm.
3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
In order to measure the elemental composition of the deposited films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out. The standard Shirley background is used for all reference sample spectra. Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra of the undoped electrode (DN0%) and the electrode containing 5 wt% TiO2 nanotubes, doped with 3 at% Nb5+ (i.e., NT5%). Fig. 6a shows that Ti, O, and Nb elements exist on the surface of the doped film. Fig. 6b illustrates the XPS spectrum of O 1s for DN0% and NT5% electrodes. The peaks at Eb = 529.36 eV for DN0% electrode and Eb = 529.39 eV for NT5% are due to oxygen ions in the TiO2 lattice (Ti–O–Ti) and the surface hydroxyl groups (Ti–OH), respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the Ti 2p XPS spectrum of the NT5% electrode shows changes with a major contribution from TiO2 bonds since the core levels of Ti4+ 2p3/2 (Eb = 458.29) and Ti4+ 2p1/2 (Eb = 464.08 eV) shifted to higher binding energies compared to that of pure TiO2 (458.26 and 464.05 eV, respectively). The XPS spectrum of NT5 film in Fig. 6d illustrates two peaks at Eb (Nb5+ 3d5/2) = 206.88 and Eb (Nb5+ 3d3/2) = 209.38 eV. Consequently, Nb-doped TiO2 films are successfully prepared through a particulate sol–gel process.

3.5. Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
3.5.1. Controlling the electron injection. Different atomic percentages of Nb5+ (0–4 at%) were doped into the TiO2 lattice to control the electron injection of the photoanode electrodes. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated TiO2 DSSCs and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters were shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2, respectively. As can be observed, the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the DSSCs changed inversely compared to the dopant percentage.

Hagfeldt et al.38 showed that VOC depends on the surface charge of the metal oxide and the potential of the conduction band edge (VCB). Therefore, considering that the introduction of niobium into the TiO2 lattice shifts VCB to lower values,39 the observed decrease in VOC is justified.
It is evident that the short circuit current (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells changed with the Nb atomic percent, reaching a maximum at 3 at% Nb5+. Therefore, DN3% showed the highest JSC and a PCE of 16.52 mA cm−2 and 7.87%, respectively. The most likely reason for the enhanced JSC may be attributed to the increase of dye adsorption onto the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles thanks to the decrease in crystallite size by Nb introduction into TiO2 lattice, as mentioned in section 3.3. Another possible reason is that the Nb dopant improves electron transport in the electrode because as an n-type semiconductor, Nb5+ has a higher number of valance electrons than Ti4+, therefore one Ti vacancy is created per four Nb introduced, and the stoichiometric reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ happens according to eqn (3), resulting in an improvement of the photo-response by introducing additional energy levels within the band gap of TiO2.

The small amount of Nb is able to reduce the number of surface traps which increases the current density. However, higher amounts of Nb (higher than 3 at% Nb) create more defects in the photoelectrode, decreasing the performance of the DSSCs.40

3.5.2. Controlling the electron transportation. The electron transportation of electrodes was controlled by adding CNT-derived nanotubes (i.e., CDTs). The J–V diagram of the fabricated TiO2 DSSCs and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters were shown in Fig. 8 and Table 3, respectively. It is clear that the PCE of the solar cells is changed with the CDT to nanoparticle weight ratio, reaching a maximum at a specific value (i.e., 5 wt%). NT5% cell showed the highest power conversion efficiency of 9.02% amongst all assembled DSSCs. The JSC enhancement of NT5% DSSC suggests that CDTs should play a significant role in enhancing the conductivity of the TiO2 films. CDTs provide a direct way for electron transportation in the photoelectrode, leading to an increase in JSC. However, the PCE decrease at higher CNT content may be justified by the dye adsorption loss as a result of the lower surface area of the prepared CDTs compared to the TiO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, as mentioned in Sections 3.2. and 3.3., the cells were mostly anatase with a small amount of rutile phase, leading to the improved photocatalytic activity of TiO2 due to a synergic effect between the anatase and rutile phases. Therefore, the introduction of CDTs into the photoelectrode introduces a fierce competition between the reduction of PCE through the reduction of surface area and the enhancement of PCE through the enhancement of JSC.

4. Conclusions
A facile sol–gel method was suggested to synthesize CNT-derived TiO2 nanotubes (CDTs) for highly efficient DSSCs. A series of structural analyses showed the uniform deposition of TiO2 with a thickness of 60–120 nm on the surface of CNTs, which act as a continuous template, without any TiO2 agglomeration. Further analysis showed that CDTs were preserved after removing the templates at 600 °C, primarily producing anatase phase along with a small amount of rutile (3 wt%) with a crystal size of 17 nm. To examine the effect of CDT incorporation on the power conversion efficiency (PCE), Nb-doped TiO2 designed with CDTs were used as DSSC photoanodes. XPS revealed that Nb5+ ions were doped into the TiO2 lattice and XRD analysis showed that Nb dopants hindered crystallite growth of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Photovoltaic characteristics showed that doping of Nb ions improved the PCE from 6.81% for undoped conventional TiO2 based DSSC to 7.87% for 3 at% Nb-doped TiO2. Afterwards, to reach the highest efficiency, CDTs were introduced in the optimal Nb-doped TiO2 photoanodes (i.e., DN3%), and the highest efficiency of 9.02% was acquired for the mixture of 3 at% Nb-doped TiO2 with content of 5 wt% CDTs (i.e., NT5%). Nb doping significantly improves electron transport and suppresses charge recombination, while CDTs mostly enhance conductivity by producing direct paths for electrons.
