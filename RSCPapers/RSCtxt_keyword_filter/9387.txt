    , Accepted 30th August 2019First published on 13th September 2019AbstractC60:Li@C60 hybrid n-type semiconducting films were first fabricated. The Fermi level of 1% Li@C60-added C60 films was determined to be −4.52 eV, which was 0.12 eV higher than that of pristine C60 films. A fraction of Li@C60 is distributed uniformly within the C60 film. Its application in PSCs was demonstrated, in which the addition of Li@C60 into a C60 film improved the device performance.
Established organic electronics demonstrate remarkable technological maturity and comprehensiveness. These devices rely on organic semiconductors which possess many advantages, such as solution-processability and modifiability, over their inorganic counterparts.1 However, low mobility has been one of the chief limitations of organic semiconductors.2 While doping with a small number of charge carriers has widely been used to improve mobility and tune the Fermi levels of materials,3 metallic dopants possess the risk of distorting crystallinity and spreading impurities upon exposure to high temperature.4 Therefore, organic dopants that can give high conductivity and control the Fermi levels are in high demand, and may lead to breakthroughs in organic semiconductors. In contrast to extensive studies on doping of inorganic semiconductors, doping technology of organic semiconductors is still in its infancy.5 This is due to the intrinsic inertness of organic semiconductors on doping. Li+@C60˙− (Li@C60), which we reported in 2016,6 has a strikingly similar molecular structure to fullerene, C60, only to be different in the number of electrons. This means that a small number of Li@C60 can sit within a sea of C60 as there will be space just enough for C60-like molecules to accommodate. Such a unique feature enables the Li@C60 and C60 pair to induce effective doping without distortion of crystallinity, which is common in inorganic doping, owing to the structural similarity (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the Li-ion is totally encaged by the fullerene such that deterioration by ion diffusion is suppressed in this system. In this work, the Li@C60 was utilised as a supraatomic dopant for pristine C60. The resulting C60:Li@C60 hybrid material showed 0.12 eV higher Fermi level than that of the pristine C60, indicating that the Li@C60 functions as an electron donor for C60. Furthermore, inverted-type perovskite solar cells (PSC) were fabricated to demonstrate the device application of the n-type semiconductors. The inverted-type PSCs with C60:Li@C60 hybrid as the electron transporting layer (ETL) showed a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.18% than 4.67% of the PSCs with the pristine C60 ETL. Such high performance was attributed to the improved conductivity and the favourable energy level alignment of the ETL.

The utilised Li@C60 was synthesised according to the reported procedure (Scheme 1).7 Note that although the actual electronic structure of the compound is Li+@C60˙−, it is denoted as Li@C60 according to the custom of the endohedral fullerene community. As the ETL is commonly fabricated by a solution-process, the solubility of Li@C60 in common organic solvents was screened, and the results are summarised in Table 1. ortho-Dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and carbon disulfide (CS2) showed relatively good solubility for the compound. Although chlorobenzene, toluene, and dichloromethane are commonly recognised as good solvents for fullerenes, they failed to dissolve Li@C60 due probably to the dimerisation of Li@C60 in these solvents.6 Therefore, 20 mg mL−1 solution of pristine C60 mixed with 0–2% of Li@C60 in o-DCB was spin-coated on ITO substrates to fabricate C60:Li@C60 hybrid thin films. The Fermi levels of the films were measured by using the Kelvin probe (Table 2). While the addition of Li@C60 clearly raised the Fermi level of C60 film by ca. 0.12 eV, the increase in the concentration of Li@C60 did not increase the Fermi level further. In addition, the Fermi level values were uniform across the C60:Li@C60 hybrid film. These results implied that the Li@C60 can n-dope pristine C60 films effectively and uniformly. It should be mentioned that further addition of Li@C60 to more than 2% lowered the quality of the films noticeably with uneven Fermi level distribution. Indeed, the films doped by 1.5% or more Li@C60 showed much lower performance in our device experiments, vide infra.

To shed light on the intermolecular interaction between Li@C60 and empty C60, a particle size analysis for C60:Li@C60 binary solution was performed by dynamic light scattering measurement. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of Li@C60 induced the aggregation of C60, and they formed C60:Li@C60 nanoparticles of ca. 120 nm in size. We speculate that they form stable binary nanoparticles based on the intermolecular charge transfer interaction predicted previously.9 Further addition of Li@C60 produced polydispersion of the sample with an even larger particle size of more than 200 nm with a wider variation. This was consistent with the observed behaviour in the Fermi level measurement, in which uneven Fermi level distribution was observed at high dopant concentrations.

The inverted-type PSCs were fabricated in a device configuration of glass/ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/C60:Li@C60/Au, (Fig. 3a and b).10Fig. 3c shows the PCE of the inverted-type PSCs according to the amount of Li@C60 dopant added. It shows that the PCE increases gradually with the increase in the dopant amount, but plummets rapidly from 1.5% upwards. The drop in the PCE at high dopant concentrations is related to the poor uniformity of the films with large aggregations.11 The optimal doping concentration was 1.0%, which gave a PCE of 8.18% while the C60-based reference devices exhibited a PCE of 4.67% (Fig. 3d). The improvement in PCE came from the improvement in all three photovoltaic parameters, namely, short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The addition of Li@C60 increased the conductivity as evidenced by the decrease in series resistance (RS), which resulted in high FF (Table 3).

The improved VOC can be ascribed to the better alignment between the Fermi level of the fullerene ETL and the conduction band of the perovskite layer. Besides, photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal that the Li@C60-added C60 films show much better carrier extraction ability, as it shows stronger quenching of the PL spectra than those of the C60 films next to a perovskite layer (Fig. 3e).
In conclusion, we designed a supraatomic doping concept to enhance the electron-transporting ability and thereby promote the performance of perovskite solar cells. The Li@C60 dopants in C60 resulted in better energy level alignment with the conduction band of the perovskite layer and higher electron mobility of the C60 ETL. The optimised dopant condition was found to be 1.0% of Li@C60 in C60 with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1, by which PSCs showed a PCE of 8.18%, outperforming the reference devices with a PCE of 4.67%. Notably, all photovoltaic parameters, namely, JSC, VOC, and FF improved significantly, which conclusively demonstrates that Li@C60 can serve as a supraatomic dopant for C60.
