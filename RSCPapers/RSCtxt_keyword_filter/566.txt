    , Accepted 5th April 2018First published on 6th April 2018AbstractPrecious metal based electrocatalysts are considered as the most efficient ones to drive kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) for metal–air batteries and fuel-cells. However, their monofunctionality in addition to their exorbitant cost has stimulated the quest for economically viable bifunctional electrocatalysts for use in next generation electrochemical energy devices. Here, we report Fe–Fe3C encapsulated in Fe–Nx enriched spheres of N-doped carbon nanotubes (FCMR, M = 3, 10, 25, 40 represents the ramping rate of temperature during synthesis) as a potentially enduring, cost effective, highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for total oxygen electrochemistry (ORR and OER) and a comprehensive study to elucidate the role of various Fe moieties. In addition to the improved OER/ORR activities as evident from the better onset potential, lower Tafel slopes and high current densities over commercially available RuO2/Pt–C electrocatalysts and several recently reported state-of-the-art bi-functional electrocatalysts, FC10R shows a current retention value of ∼93 and ∼98% after the accelerated cyclic stability test for the OER and ORR, respectively. The preferable 4e− pathways and suppressed peroxide generation in the ORR by FC10R further ensure maximum electrochemical energy harvesting. Remarkably, the complete oxygen electrochemistry of FC10R in alkaline medium as evaluated from ΔE (=Ej(OER) = 10 − E1/2(ORR) = 0.758 V) is significantly lower than that of commercially available/recently reported electrocatalysts and advocates the minimum cyclic loss. The overall study elucidates the synergistic effect of Fe–Nx coordination and Fe3C moieties on oxygen electrochemistry, and FC10R has shown its potential to serve as a non-precious metal based bifunctional electrocatalyst for next generation electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Finally, a prototype Al–air battery arrangement using FC10R as an air-cathode for powering a green light emitting diode has been demonstrated.
Introduction
The electrochemical oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) plays a decisive role in the performance evaluation of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices like fuel cells, metal–air batteries, electrolyzers, etc.1–3 The OER and ORR reactions are sluggish in nature due to multiple electron transfer and are catalyst driven.1–3 Precious metal group (PMG) based catalysts are considered efficient for the ORR and have been studied widely.4–7 However, besides cost (which adds to ∼49% of the device cost) and operational stability, PMG based catalysts are mainly known for their mono-functionality. Pt-based catalysts are promising for the ORR but show very poor activity/stability towards the OER.1,2 Similarly, Ru and Ir based oxides are well known for the OER, but show poor performance towards the ORR that restricts their use in metal air-batteries.1 Recent studies show that non-precious metal group based electrocatalysts (NPMGCs) can be promising alternatives for PMG based electrocatalysts as some of them warrant the bi-functional behaviour in addition to superior activity.1,8–22
NPMGCs enriched with M–Nx coordination (M = Fe, Co) offer excellent ORR as well as OER activities in alkaline medium.12,23–27 However, there exist divergent opinions regarding the direct or indirect involvement of nitrogen coordinated metals in oxygen electrochemistry.20 For rational engineering and designing of appropriate electrocatalysts, it is of paramount significance to identify the active centres responsible for electrochemical activity and stability.12 Further, it has also been suggested that the encapsulation of metal–metal carbide nanoparticles in the graphitic layer activates the structure electrochemically towards the ORR by reducing the work function of the carbon layer, and in return, the carbon layer provides a protective coating and hence the stability.28,29 A recent study suggests that the presence of Fe–Fe3C moieties in electrocatalysts boosts the electrochemical activity.12,29–31 However, the stability and activity are inferior to those of benchmark state-of-the-art commercial catalysts.29,30 In order to evaluate the direct or indirect involvement of metal based active centres, poisoning tests have been suggested.20 Nevertheless, a comprehensive study, which can elucidate the impact of such poisoning on total oxygen electrochemistry and may shed some light on the importance of M–Nx/C coordination, is much needed as it may pave the way for designing NPMG based bifunctional electrocatalysts to serve as a catalyst for metal–air batteries, in particular. Furthermore, it is essential to understand the role of each component associated in catalysis for the optimum utilization of electrocatalysts.
In this work, we synthesized Fe–Fe3C encapsulated N-doped carbon spheres and Fe–Fe3C encapsulated Fe–Nx enriched spheres of N-doped carbon nanotubes in an attempt to elucidate the importance of Fe–Fe3C and Fe–Nx based active centres for oxygen electrochemistry. Importantly, the study offers a facile approach to enhance the Fe–Nx coordination by simply optimizing the ramping rate of temperature during the synthesis. Four ramping rates, namely 3, 10, 25 and 40 °C minute−1, has been taken in the present study, and the samples are named FC3R, FC10R, FC25R and FC40R, respectively. The electrochemical studies suggest the presence of Fe–Nx and Fe–Fe3C coordination centres in FC10R which offers remarkable improvement in the bi-functionality (ORR and OER) over FC3R, FC25R, FC40R (which mainly incorporates Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles in the N-doped carbon network), and various recently reported and commercially available state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The poisoning study with NaSCN further reveals the direct involvement of coordinated metal (Fe–Nx) as electrochemically active centres for the ORR and OER. In addition to the electrochemical studies, we fabricated a simple prototype metal–air battery using an aluminium wire (a common household object) as the anode material and FC10R coated carbon tape as the cathode electrocatalyst to power a light emitting diode for more than 150 h. Overall, we present a comprehensive analysis which is believed to be helpful in designing various M–Nx centre based bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrochemistry.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
The samples are synthesized by pyrolysing32 100 mg of melamine and 80 mg of ferrocene at 750 °C for 1.1 h at different ramping rates of 3, 10, 25 and 40 °C minute−1, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the representative scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of FC3R (Fig. 1a and b), FC10R (Fig. 1c and d at different magnifications), FC25R (Fig. 1e) and FC40R (Fig. 1f). It is obvious from the SEM images that the ramping rate influences the final structure obtained. It may be noted that catalyst particles are very much needed to promote graphitization and hence, carbon nanotube (CNT) formation.26,32 For the slow ramping rate, the formation of sphere of carbon encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles (FC3R) is believed to be due to slow availability of active carbon moieties. This slow availability can cause carbide formation and hinder CNT formation.26 It is evident from Fig. S1† that FC3R appears as a sphere of carbon encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles. When the ramping rate was increased to 10 and 25 °C min−1, the formation of CNT takes place prior to that of metal carbide. However, the structure is rich in carbides, and very few CNTs are observed at a ramping rate of 40 °C min−1. The study suggests that CNTs obtained for 10 and 25 °C min−1 offer better electrochemical activities as CNTs can accommodate a large no. of electrochemically active centers as well as provide better accessibility to reactant species.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of FC10R (Fig. 2a and b) reveal the presence of CNTs loaded with Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles well encapsulated in the graphitic layers. This type of structure has the potential to serve as an efficient electrocatalyst for the ORR and OER as it possesses a unique host and guest relationship where the encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles activate the carbon layer towards the ORR by reducing the work function, and at the same time, the encapsulation provides the stability for the electrocatalyst.28,29 The indexing of the high resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. 2c) image suggests the presence of Fe (110) and Fe3C (200). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 2d) further elucidates the presence of encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles in the FC10R. The box marked in Fig. 2d is subjected to drift-corrected imaging and mapping of constituent elements as shown in Fig. 2e–h. The elemental mapping is suggestive of uniform distribution of nitrogen in the structure loaded with Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles. In contrast, the TEM image of FC3R (Fig. S1†) does not show the presence of CNTs while the structure is rich in encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles.

The XRD patterns of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) suggest the presence of the graphitic (002) peak centred at around 26.3° which is in consort with the TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 1 and S1†).30 The peaks in Fig. 3a centred at around 44.75, 65.3 and 82.55° can be attributed to the planes corresponding to (110), (200) and (211) of metallic Fe (ICSD no. 52258). In addition, the peaks centred at around 29.6, 35.8, 37.8, 40, 40.9, 43, 43.9, 46, and 49.23° are suggestive of the Fe3C phase (ICSD no. 99002) in the structure which can be indexed to the diffraction from the planes corresponding to (111), (200), (210), (002), (201), (211), (102), (112), and (221), respectively. Thus, the XRD and TEM/HRTEM studies suggest the co-existence of graphitic carbon, metallic Fe and Fe3C in the structures. The presence of Fe–Fe3C encapsulation with N-doped carbon is an important trait for the ORR. The Raman spectra of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) shown in Fig. 3b comprise the defect peak (D-band) centred at around 1350 cm−1 and graphitic peak (G-band) centred at around 1590 cm−1.12,33 The peak intensity ratio between the D-peak and G-peak (ID/IG) can be valuable for comparing the presence of surface defect density present in the structures.12,33 The ID/IG ratio is larger for FC10R (1.15) as compared to that for FC3R (∼0.96), FC25R (∼1) and FC40R (∼0.98). The Raman study suggests the presence of larger surface defects in FC10R which may be more beneficial for the electrochemical studies over other electrocatalysts.

To further understand the chemical states and composition of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies have been carried out. Fig. 3c shows the wide XPS spectra of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) which comprise the characteristic peaks of C1s (∼284 eV), N1s (∼398 eV), O1s (∼532 eV) and Fe2p (∼720 eV). Fig. 3d presents the deconvoluted nitrogen N1s core spectrum of FC3R. The constituent peaks in N1s of FC3R suggest the presence of a variety of nitrogen species. Peaks at centred around 397.7, 399.1, 400.56, 402.4 and 404.6 can be attributed to pyridinic (N1), pyrrolic (N2), quaternary (N3), oxidized nitrogen (N4) and chemi-absorbed nitrogen oxides (N5).34–38Fig. 3e and S2† show the deconvoluted Fe2p core spectra of FC10R and FC3R, and FC25R and FC40R, respectively. The deconvolution of the Fe2p core spectrum of FC10R (Fig. 3d) reveals peaks centred at around 708.1 and 719.6 eV which can be attributed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 metallic iron (Feo). Similarly, the peaks centred at around 710.9 and 714.4 and 723.4 and 729.9 eV correspond to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Fe2+ and Fe3+, respectively.12,23–27 The Fe to C ratio in FC3R, FC10R, FC25R and FC40R is found to be 0.19, 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24, respectively. Fig. S3† describes the various chemical states of C1s in FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40). The XPS study also suggests the presence of Fe–Fe3C in the structure. Fig. 3f–h present the deconvoluted nitrogen N1s core spectra of FC10R, FC25R and FC40R, respectively. The amount of nitrogen content in FC3R (∼8.9%), FC10R (∼9.4%), FC25R (∼7.8) and FC40R (∼7) is calculated with the help of the XPS study. The constituent peaks in N1s of FC25R (N1, N2, N3 and N4) and FC40R (N1, N2, N3, N4 and N5) suggest the presence of a variety of nitrogen species (Fig. 3g and h). Interestingly, in addition to the N1, N2, N3, and N5 constituent peaks of FC10R, there exists a peak centred at around 398.6 eV (N1*) of the N1s peak that advocates the presence of Fe–Nx coordination (Fig. 3f).12,23–27 A recent literature survey suggests that the peak at around 398.6 ± 0.3 eV can be safely attributed to the coordination of iron with pyridininc/pyrrolic nitrogen.12,23 Importantly, N1, N1*, N2, and N3 nitrogen moieties play an important role in oxygen electrochemistry as N1 and N2 moieties coordinate with Fe (as evidenced by the presence of the N1* signature in Fig. 3f) to form a Fe–Nx/C complex in the carbon nanostructure, and the Fe–Nx/C centre plays a decisive role in the ORR as the binding energy of oxygen to Fe–Nx/C (∼4.45 eV) is approximately similar to that for the bulk Pt (111) surface (∼4.46 eV).22 The present study suggests that by simply optimizing the temperature ramping rate during synthesis, Fe–Nx enriched nanostructures can be achieved which have potential for oxygen electrochemistry. Further, the N3 moieties in the carbon matrix modulate the C–N bond length close to the O–O bond length which promote facile side-by-side oxygen adsorption and hence, the preferable 4e− ORR pathway.35 The nitrogen adsorption–desorption study was carried out on FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25 and 40) to obtain specific surface area which provides an idea about the electrochemically active sites. FC3R, FC10R and FC40R show type IV isotherms as shown in Fig. 3g which is indicative of the presence of mesoporosity in the structure.12,39 The adsorption–desorption isotherm of FC25R is a type II isotherm, indicative of a nano/macroporous surface. The hysteresis loops of all samples suggest capillary condensation with multilayer adsorption which further confirms the presence of macro- and meso-porosity in the structures.39 The pore size distribution (Fig. 3j and S4†) as evaluated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model suggests the presence of micro-, macro- and mesoporosity, and it is evident from the pore size distribution graphs that the pore volume and size distribution are much better in FC10R as compared to FC3R, FC25R and FC40R. Further, FC10R exhibits a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of ∼240 m2 g−1 which is much superior to those of FC3R (∼92 m2 g−1), FC25R (∼165 m2 g−1), FC40R (∼65 m2 g−1) and various reported values for doped carbon nanostructures (Table S1†). A literature survey suggests that the presence of foreign atoms in carbon nanostructures, apart from electronic and chemical modulation, introduces a variety of porosity and improves the specific active surface area,12,39 which in consequence offers high surface defects, large BET specific surface area and a variety of porosity in the structure. It may be noted from the structural analysis of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) that the Fe to C ratio as well as the amount of nitrogen present is nearly the same. However, besides Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles as is the case in FC3R, FC25R and FC40R, FC10R is enriched with Fe–Nx/C moieties which suggests that by simply controlling the ramping rate of the pyrolysis temperature during synthesis, Fe can be better utilized in the Fe–Nx/C coordination. The Fe–Nx/C further introduces surface defects as evident from the Raman study. The overall study suggests that the Fe–Nx coordination which is very fruitful for oxygen electrochemistry can be easily accommodated in the electrocatalyst by optimizing the ramping rate.
Electrochemical oxygen evolution
In order to evaluate the electrochemical activity of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25 and 40), we have taken the OER as a model reaction in alkaline medium. The OER plays a significant role in device performance evaluation in metal–air batteries and in sustainable electrochemical hydrogen production.1–3,12,22 The sluggish and complex nature of the OER requires catalysts.1–3 We have used a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) setup to evaluate the OER activity of FCMR as well as commercially available state-of-the-art-catalysts like RuO2 and Pt–C (20 wt% Pt loading on carbon) under similar experimental conditions. Fig. S5a† shows the OER polarization curve of FC10R in 1 M NaOH solution. A background current is clearly observed below 1.5 V vs. RHE, and above 1.5 V the current rises rapidly. This background current (<1.5 V) may be due to some side reactions other than the OER. One of the possibilities maybe carbon electro-oxidation as the thermodynamic potential of carbon electrooxidation is 0.207 V vs. RHE (C + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H+ + 4e−) which is much more negative than that of the OER process (1.23 V vs. RHE) making carbon susceptible for oxidation.2c In order to eliminate the contributions due to possible side reactions other than the OER process, the Pt ring of the RRDE electrode was kept at 0.4 V to execute the ORR of the oxygen bubbles evolved during the OER, and the results for the FC10R modified disk electrode are presented in Fig. 4a and b. The Pt-ring current was regulated using collection efficiency N (=0.3). As shown in Fig. 4a the magnitude of the disk and ring current (after calibration) obtained at 1.775 V vs. RHE are 133 and 122 mA cm−2. This indicates the possible contribution of some side reactions like carbon oxidation besides the OER process at the disk electrode which must be excluded in order to obtain the true electrochemical activity. For better visualization of this effect on the OER onset potential (Eon-set, the potential at which the OER current density for different electrocatalysts is 2 mA cm−2, is taken for this work) and the potential at which the OER current density value is 10 mA cm−2 (Ej = 10 mA cm−2), the rectangular portion (as marked by the red dotted line in Fig. 4a) is magnified and shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4b shows that the disk current attains current values of 2 and 10 mA cm−2 at 1.311 and 1.521 V, respectively, whereas the ring current attains the same current values at 1.522 and 1.57 V vs. RHE, respectively. Since the ring current appears solely due to reduction of oxygen, getting generated at disk electrode in the process of oxygen evolution, represents the true OER process. In the OER study, the contribution due to the side reactions other than the OER process has been subtracted with appropriate base line correction as explained through Fig. S5.†

(j) Sweeping rate dependent OER study on FC10R. 
For better results, the catalyst (FC10R) loading was optimized as shown in Fig. 4c. Initially with the increase in catalyst loading from 0.75 to 1 mg cm−2, the OER current increased from 93 to 122 mA cm−2@1.775 V vs. RHE. When the loading was increased to 1.25 mg cm−2 the OER current decreased to 106 mA cm−2 (@1.775 V vs. RHE) as shown in the inset of Fig. 4c, which may be due to the restriction associated with mass transport. With the increased loading of the electrocatalyst, the layer thickness increases which in turn increases the electron diffusion length and slows down the electronic communication between the electrode layer and current collector which is a glassy carbon electrode here.12 The optimized loading in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at 1200 rpm and 10 mV s−1 scan speed was found to be 1 mg cm−2 of FC10R. This optimized loading (1 mg cm−2) was used for further electrochemical studies with FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25 and 40). Fig. 4d shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves of FC3R, FC10R, FC25R, FC40R and commercially available RuO2 and Pt–C electrocatalysts in nitrogen-purged 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at 1200 rpm and a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 under similar experimental conditions. The onset potential is 1.522 V (over-potential, η ∼ 0.292 V) for FC10R which is noticeably lower than those for FC3R (1.57 V, η ∼ 0.340 V), FC25R (1.6 V, η ∼ 0.370 V), FC40R (1.62 V, η ∼ 0.390 V) and Pt–C (1.535 V, η ∼ 0.305 V), while it is comparable to that for commercially available RuO2 (1.49 V, η ∼ 0.260 V) electrocatalysts in alkaline medium as shown in Fig. 4d and e. Importantly, FC10R outclasses FC3R, FC25R, FC40R, RuO2 and Pt–C in terms of OER current densities at 1.775 V (vs. RHE, JOER@1.775 V for FC10R, FC3R, FC25R, FC40R, RuO2 and Pt–C are found to be ∼122, 46, 70, 40, 59 and 39, respectively).
A recent literature survey suggests that the potential at which the OER current density attained a value of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej = 10 mA cm−2) can be used for further appraising the performance of the electrocatalysts.10–17 It normally signifies the estimated value for an effective 10% solar water-splitting device under one sun illumination.12,15 Remarkably, the Ej = 10 mA cm−2 for FC10R (∼1.57 V, η = 0.34 V) is very much close to that of RuO2 (∼1.557 V, η = 0.327 V) and much lower than that for FC3R (∼1.64 V, η = 0.410 V), FC25R (∼1.654 V, η = 0.424 V), FC40R (∼1.683 V, η = 0.453 V) and Pt–C (∼1.635 V, η = 0.405 V). Interestingly, Ej = 20 mA cm−2 for FC10R is better than those for all the electrocatalysts studied in this work (Fig. 4d and e). Fig. 4e and Table 1 summarises the variation of Eon-set, Ej = 10 mA cm−2 and Ej = 20 mA cm−2 for various electrocatalysts used in the OER studies in alkaline medium.

Tafel slope is evaluated for different electrocatalysts in order to shed some light on the kinetics of the OER process. The lower Tafel slope represents the more favourable reaction kinetics.1 In the present study, FC10R shows a much smaller Tafel slope of ∼35 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4f) as compared to those for FC3R (∼50 mV dec−1), FC25R (∼38 mV dec−1), FC40R (∼48 mV dec−1), RuO2 (∼65 mV dec−1) and Pt–C (∼77 mV dec−1) along with several recently reported state-of-the-art carbon based electrocatalysts.10–23 In an attempt to understand the improved OER performance of FC10R over FC3R, FC25R and FC40R, the quasi-reversible [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox study that involves the transfer of one electron is carried out using 15 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− in 0.5 M KCl aqueous solution with the same three electrode set-up used for the OER study under similar experimental conditions (loading is maintained as 1 mg cm−2 at 10 mV s−1 scan speed) as a probe to appraise the ease with which electron transfer takes place on the electrocatalysts under study.1,12 The difference between the redox peaks obtained from CV, shown in Fig. 4g, is lower for FC10R (0.103 V) than for FC3R (0.220 V), FC25R (0.115 V), and FC40R (0.240 V) which advocates the better surface conductivity/surface electron transfer kinetics on FC10R and in return may provide improved OER current density.
To further comprehend the enhanced OER activity of FC10R over other electrocatalysts, double layer capacitance (Cdl) in the non-faradaic region, which gives an idea about the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrocatalyst,12,15 is evaluated from the CV voltammograms (Fig. 4h) recorded in nitrogen-saturated alkaline (1 M NaOH) aqueous solution in the potential region of 0.535 to 0.635 V vs. RHE (Fig. S6†). The estimated Cdl (Fig. 4f) obtained for FC10R (∼7.75 mF cm−2) is much better than that for FC3R (∼2.71 mF cm−2), FC25R (6.3 mF cm−2) and FC40R (1.96 mF cm−2) which indicates the availability of the large amount of electrochemically active sites in the FC10R as compared to FC3R, FC25R and FC40R. Further, the ECSA and roughness factor (Rf) of the FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) electrocatalysts were evaluated using eqn (1) and (2) (Table 2).3b,c Interestingly, the linear relationship (Fig. S4†) indicates that the BET surface area is consistent with the ECSA of the FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40, Table 2) electrocatalysts. (1) (2)where Cdl is the double layer capacitance evaluated from CV at different scan speeds in the non-faradaic region (Fig. S6† and 4h) and Cs represents the capacitance of the atomically flat surface of the material per unit area under similar experimental conditions (Cs = 0.040 mF cm−2).3b,cAg is the active geometric area of the working electrode (∼0.07 cm2).

Fig. 4j shows the OER polarization curves at 1200 rpm and at different sweep rates. It is evident that the OER current density at 1.775 V vs. RHE is independent of scan speed, as seen in the inset of Fig. 4j, and the polarization curves almost overlap each other which prove that the Tafel analysis (Fig. 4f) is valid as the effect from mass transfer can be neglected.3c In an attempt to study the reproducibility of the OER performance of FC10R, five different electrodes (FC10R modified GCE@1 mg cm−2) has been prepared at different times. The OER polarization curves (recorded in nitrogen-purged 1 M NaOH aqueous solution at 1200 rpm and a scan speed of 10 mV s−1) and Tafel slope calculations in the window of 5 to 15 mA cm−2 for each electrode (Fig. S7†) suggest better reproducibility of the OER on FC10R (Eon-set ∼ 1.52 ± 0.006 V vs. RHE, Ej = 10 ∼ 1.57 ± 0.015 V vs. RHE, Tafel slope ∼34 ± 2 mV dec−1). Overall, the quasi-reversible redox process, Cdl, ECSA and Rf reveal that FC10R has better electron transfer characteristics along with large electrochemically active sites than other electrocatalysts in the present study (Fig. 4i, Table 2). Moreover, the enhanced electroactive centres of FC10R over FC3R, FC25R and FC40R is in consort with the Raman study (Fig. 3b) which suggests increased surface defects as elucidated from the large ID/IG ratio for FC10R (∼1.15) as well as the BET surface area, and the porosity studies (Fig. 3i and j) further support the possibly improved electrochemical activity of FC10R. The accelerated cycling stability test (at 1200 rpm and 100 mV s−1 scan speed in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution) on FC10R suggests ∼93% current retention values after 1500 cycles (Fig. S8†). Overall, the electrochemical oxygen evolution study on FC10R in alkaline medium outclasses the other electrocatalysts under study (FC3R, FC25R, FC40R, RuO2 and Pt–C) and various recently reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts (Table S2†).10–23
Electrochemical oxygen reduction
Encouraged by the enhanced OER performance, we studied the ORR activity of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) in alkaline medium to appraise the feasibility of bifunctionality. Similar to the OER, the ORR too is a very important half-cell reaction and plays a crucial role in the device efficiency evaluation of fuel cells and metal–air batteries.1–3,12,15 Traditionally, Pt-based electrocatalysts are considered as efficient catalysts for the ORR and are widely studied.1–3,12,15 However, Pt-based electrocatalysts suffer from fuel crossover poisoning, poor stability, and scarcity along with high cost that hinder the wide spread commercialization of these electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.2,12,15 In addition these Pt-based electrocatalysts are known only for their mono-functionality2 which is also evident from the poor OER activity of Pt–C in the present study (Fig. 4d and f). Fig. 5a comprises the ORR polarization curves recorded using RDE-linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at 2200 rpm and 10 mV s−1 sweep rate in oxygen-purged 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution for RuO2, Pt–C, FC3R, FC10R, FC25R and FC40R. The Eon-set, the half-wave potential (E1/2), the current density and the Tafel slopes are considered as the important parameters for ORR activity. In the present study, Eon-set is considered as the potential corresponding to a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2 (Fig. S9†). The Eon-set and E1/2 for FC10R are ∼0.935 and ∼0.812 V vs. RHE which is very much comparable to those of commercial Pt–C (∼0.927 V, ∼0.8 V) and are much more positive than those for FC3R (∼0.833 V, ∼0.605 V), FC25R (∼0.924 V, ∼0.754 V), FC40R (∼0.823 V, ∼0.591 V), and commercial RuO2 (∼0.769 V, ∼0.518 V) as evident from Fig. 5a, b and S9.† Further, the current density at 0.3 V vs. RHE for FC10R is −5.15 mA cm−2 which is better than those for RuO2 (−3.6 mA cm−2), FC3R (−3.4 mA cm−2), FC25R (−3.95 mA cm−2), FC40R (−1.85 mA cm−2) and Pt–C (−4.2 mA cm−2) as evident from Fig. 5a.

(c) Tafel slopes of FC10R deduced from (a) RDE-LSV polarization curve and (d) RDE-LSV ORR polarization curves of FC10R at different electrode rotation speeds and 10 mV s−1 sweep rate in oxygen-purged 0.1 M NaOH solution. (e and f) K–L plots, deduced from (d) and no. of electrons transferred in the ORR process on FC10R. (g) RRDE-ORR polarization curves with H2O2 generation and (h) no. of electron transfers (deduced from (g)) with applied electrode potentials of FC10R and Pt–C at 2400 rpm and 10 mV s−1 sweep rate in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. 
Two Tafel slopes (Fig. 5c and S10†) are deduced from the RDE-LSV polarization curves for the ORR from Fig. 5a in the low and high over-potential regions. Among the catalysts, FC10R exhibits smaller Tafel slopes (∼54 and 110 mV dec−1) as compared to those for FC3R (∼75 and 172 mV dec−1), RuO2 (∼93 and 261 mV dec−1) and Pt–C (∼62 and 124 mV dec−1) in the low as well as high over-potential regions. The study suggests that the ORR process is much favourable on FC10R. On the basis of the structure and property correlation, the better ORR activity of FC10R can be attributed to the presence of plenty of defects (Fig. 3b, ID/IG ∼ 1.15), Fe–Nx/C coordination along with C–Nx coordination (Fig. 3f), large specific BET surface area (∼240 m2 g−1) with high pore density (Fig. 3g and h), better electron transfer properties (Fig. 4e), enhanced ECSA (13.56 cm2) and high Rf (194). For further understanding the ORR kinetics, the RDE-LSV ORR polarization curves of FC10R at different electrode rotation speeds and at 10 mV s−1 sweep rate are recorded and shown in Fig. 5d. As evident from Fig. 5d, the ORR current density increases with the electrode rotation speed which can be attributed to the increased oxygen flux availability on the FC10R modified electrode surface. The Koutecky–Levich (K–L)5,7,12 equation is used to obtain the kinetic parameters (no. of electrons involved per oxygen molecule reduction, reaction order and kinetic currents) of the ORR process in the mixed current region. The K–L equation is given by5,7,12 (3)where Jd, Jk and J signify the diffusion limited, kinetic and experimentally measured current densities. For RDE-LSV voltammetry, the Jd can be associated with the working electrode (FC10R modified) rotation speed using the Levich equation which is given by5,7 Jd = 0.62nFD2/3ν−1/6Coω1/2(4)where n is the number of electrons transferred per oxygen molecule reduction in the ORR process, F (=96485 C mol−1) represents the Faraday constant, ν (=0.011 cm2 s−1) is the kinematic viscosity of the solution, D (=1.65 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) is the oxygen diffusion co-efficient in electrolyte solution, Co (=8.4 × 10−7 mol cm−3) represents the dissolved oxygen concentration in the electrolyte solution, and ω is the angular speed of the FC10R modified working electrode used for the ORR study.5,7,12
The corresponding K–L plots (J−1 and ω−1/2) are deduced from Fig. 5d and with the help of eqn (1) and (2). The linear behaviour of the K–L plots suggests the first order reaction kinetics with respect to the dissolved oxygen in the solution for the ORR process. In addition, the parallel nature of the lines in the K–L plots suggests the uniform transfer of electrons with respect to the applied potentials on the working electrode. The slopes and the intercepts obtained from the K–L plots provide an idea of the no. of electrons involved in the reduction per oxygen molecule and the kinetic current values for the ORR process with applied electrode potentials.5,7,12 The variation of the no. of electrons and the Jk with applied electrode potentials as obtained from the K–L plot analysis are presented in Fig. 5f and S11.† The analysis based on the K–L study suggests that the 4e− pathway facilitates the oxygen reduction on FC10R and therefore, warrants maximum electrochemical energy harvesting during the ORR process.
Further, the RRDE measurements are also employed to assess the ORR performance on FC10R and Pt–C in oxygen saturated 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. Fig. 5g shows the RRDE-LSV ORR polarization curves comprising of ring and disk currents. The ring current, a measure of peroxide (HO2−) oxidation is monitored by the Pt-ring electrode kept at constant potential.5,7,12 The percentage HO2− generation and the no. of electrons transferred (n) per oxygen molecule reduced in the ORR process on FC10R and Pt–C are deduced from the RRDE voltammograms (Fig. 5g) using eqn (5) and (6). (5) (6)where n is the no. of electron transfer, Id and Ir are faradic disk and ring currents and N is the collection efficiency of the Pt ring electrode (0.3).5,7,12

Fig. 5h shows the variation of the no. of electrons transferred and the % HO2− generation on FC10R and Pt–C as obtained from the RRDE study with respect to the applied electrode potentials, suggesting the preferential 4e− pathway for the ORR process on Pt–C as well as on FC10R which is in consort with the K–L analysis (Fig. 5f). The reduced % HO2− generation on FC10R further supports the better ORR activity and in this regard, it emulates the commercially available state-of-the-art Pt–C electrocatalyst. Further, the accelerated LSV-RDE cycling stability test study is carried out on FC10R in oxygen-purged 0.1 M NaOH solution at a rotation speed of 2000 rpm and scan speed of 100 mV s−1 which supports the excellent stability (Fig. S12†). The stability study suggests that after 1500 cycles the FC10R retains 98% of the initial current values without any noticeable change in Eon-set. Overall, the FC10R shows its potential as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.
Overall oxygen electrochemistry
The catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst towards overall oxygen electrochemistry can be evaluated from the difference between the electrode potentials of the OER current density at 10 mA cm−2 (Ej = 10, OER) and the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2, ORR) which can be given as ΔE = Ej = 10, OER − E1/2, ORR.12,15,17 Smaller the magnitude of ΔE closer is the electrocatalyst towards the oxygen reversible electrode and therefore, minimizing the cycling loss during the charge–discharge cycle of metal–air batteries as the combined large over-potentials of the OER and ORR alone diminishes the power output by ∼70%.12,15,17 It is evident from the bifunctional activity that among the catalysts under study FC10R exhibits the smallest ΔE (0.758 V) as represented in Fig. 6a and poses potential for practical applications over RuO2, Pt–C FC3R, FC25R and FC40R (ΔE ∼ 1.039, 0.835, 1.035 0.9 and 1.092 V, respectively). Further, the ΔE for FC10R is much smaller than those of various recently reported state-of-the-art transition metal based hetero atom doped/co-doped bifunctional electrocatalysts (Fig. 6b, Table S4†) such as Fe/Fe3C@NGL-NCNT (ΔE = 1.29 V), MWCNTs@S–N–C (ΔE = 1.25 V), B-MWCNTs (ΔE = 1.00 V), N-doped graphene–CNT nanocomposites (ΔE = 1.00 V), CoFe2O4/N–P–biocarbon (ΔE = 0.98 V), CoFe2O4/rGO (ΔE = 0.98 V), Fe/Fe3C@ N-graphitic layer (ΔE = 0.97 V), N,P co-doped carbon paper (ΔE = 0.96 V), NiCo2O4/graphene (ΔE = 0.915 V), NS-CN (ΔE ∼ 0.88 V), Fe/N/C@BMZIF (ΔE ∼ 0.79 V), BFNCNTs (ΔE ∼0.788 V), etc., and various precious/non-precious metal based electrocatalysts such as CaMn4Ox (ΔE = 1.04 V), Pt@C (ΔE = 0.94 V), MnxOy/N–carbon (ΔE = 0.93 V), and Ir@C (ΔE = 0.92 V).12–22 Overall, the FC10R shows the superior oxygen electrochemistry collectively.

Poisoning study
Identification of the electrochemically active centres is helpful in designing future electrocatalysts. In an attempt to elucidate the involvement of nitrogen coordinated Fe (Fe–Nx) in oxygen electrochemistry, we carried out the poisoning test by repeating the electrochemical studies on FC10R in oxygen saturated 0.1 M NaOH + 50 mM NaSCN solution. The rationality behind the poisoning test is that the SCN− ions interact with the Fe2+/3+ ions and mask the coordination sites which would reduce the activity.20 The substantial amount of decrease in the ORR current density (Fig. 7a and b) with a negative shift in the Eon-set and E1/2 (Fig. 7b), as evident from the CV and RRDE polarization curves of FC10R in 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M NaOH + 50 mM NaSCN (Fig. 7a and b), suggest the direct involvement of coordinated metal in the ORR process. The masking of Fe-based active centres has an adverse effect on the % HO2− generation (calculated by eqn (6)) which has increased up to 25% (Fig. 7c). The decrease in the no. of electrons transferred has also been noted (Fig. 7d, calculated from eqn (5)). We also carried out the poisoning test on FC3R as the XPS study suggests mostly the presence of C–Nx based moieties and carbon encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles. Remarkably, we do not observe any noticeable change in the ORR polarization curves (Fig. S13†) which suggests that the activity of the FC3R catalyst is mainly due to the presence of the C–Nx based moieties and the indirect involvement of the encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles in the ORR.

(c and d) Effect of the poisoning study on generation of HO2− % and no. of electrons transferred in the ORR process deduced from (a and b). (e and f) The effect of poisoning on overall OER current density, Eon-set and Ej = 10, OER, respectively. (g) Effect of poisoning on overall oxygen electrochemistry ΔE (Ej = 10, OER − E1/2, ORR). 
Besides the ORR, the masking of the Fe-based centre with SCN− has a noteworthy effect on the OER activity as the significant loss in the current density along with the shift in the Eon-set and Ej = 10, OER towards the high over-potential side has been observed (Fig. 7e and f). As a result, the parameter which has been generally used to access the total oxygen electrochemistry, ΔE (Ej = 10, OER − E1/2, ORR), shows a shift of ∼140 mV (ΔENaOH + NaSCN − ΔENaOH), as seen from Fig. 7g.
To further elucidate the reduction in electrochemical activity due to the poisoning test, Cdl for FC10R in 0.1 M NaOH + 50 mM NaSCN is estimated. The Cdl decreased from 7.75 (Fig. 4f) to 2.31 mF cm−2 (Fig. S14†) and hence, the ECSA decreased from 13.56 to 4.04 cm2 proving the direct involvement of the Fe-based active centres in oxygen electrochemistry. Overall, the poisoning study suggests that (i) the FC10R is enriched with Fe–Nx coordination which is in consort with the XPS study (Fig. 3f), (ii) the Fe-based centres play a direct and decisive role in oxygen electrochemistry, (iii) the residual electrocatalytic activity in the presence of SCN− can be attributed to the presence of some other kind of centres such as N–Cx moieties and Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles in the FC10R, and (iv) carbon encapsulated Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles do not interact with reactant species directly as evident in the case of FC3R.
Practical realization
Motivated by the promising bifunctional (OER and ORR) behaviour of FC10R, we have fabricated an aluminium-air battery to power a light emitting diode (LED) in an attempt to study the practical feasibility of the electrocatalyst in ambience as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a shows the scheme of fabrication of an Al–air battery. A piece of an aluminium wire (4 mm diameter, 2 cm long) is taken and appropriately wrapped with a porous-cloth used as a separator. Finally, on the outer surface the FC10R electrocatalyst has been drop-cast (the loading is maintained ∼1 mg cm−2) on carbon tape which is in direct contact with air. A spray of 2 M NaOH aqueous solution (as an electrolyte) is used after battery fabrication. A prototype of such assembly is shown in Fig. 8b. Fig. 8c shows two such kinds of prototype battery systems connected in series to power a green LED. We also tried to study the variation of the open circuit voltage (OCV) of this arrangement with time, as shown in Fig. 8d. Interestingly, the OCV remains the same as the initial value even after 150 h which proves the feasibility of FC10R towards practical applications. After an interval of ∼60 h, NaOH electrolyte is sprayed to maintain the ionic conductivity as shown by the arrow in Fig. 8d.

Conclusions
In summary, Fe–Fe3C encapsulated N-doped carbon spheres and Fe–Fe3C encapsulated, Fe–Nx enriched spheres of N-doped carbon nanotubes (FCMR, M = 3, 10, 25, 40) have been synthesized as a noble metal-free bi-functional electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR). The study suggests that though the nitrogen and Fe content in the present electrocatalyst is nearly the same, the one with enriched Fe–Nx coordination shows superior oxygen electrochemistry, and the Fe–Nx coordination mainly depends upon the ramping rate. As a consequence the surface defect density as evident from the ID/IG ratio in Raman spectra and the electrochemically calculated ESCA and roughness factor are much favourable in the Fe–Nx enriched nanostructure FC10R. In addition to the improved OER/ORR activities as evident from better onset potential, lower Tafel slopes and high current densities over commercially available RuO2/Pt–C electrocatalysts and several recently reported state-of-the-art bi-functional electrocatalysts, FC10R shows a current retention value of ∼93 and ∼98% after 1500 cycles of the accelerated cyclic stability test for the OER and ORR, respectively. The preferable 4e− ORR pathways and suppressed peroxide generation in the ORR on FC10R further ensure maximum electrochemical energy harvesting. Remarkably, the complete oxygen electrochemistry on FC10R in alkaline medium as evaluated from ΔE (=Ej(OER) = 10 − E1/2(ORR) = 0.758 V) is significantly lower than that of commercially available electrocatalysts (RuO2/Pt–C) and various metal-free/transition metal doped/co-doped carbon nanostructure based state-of-the-art bi-functional catalysts reported recently. Moreover, in an attempt to study the feasibility of FC10R as an air-cathode electrocatalyst, a prototype Al–air battery system has been assembled to power a green light emitting diode. The OCV (∼2.59 V) even after 150 hours is nearly the same as its initial value (∼2.64 V). Importantly, the poisoning study on FC10R elucidates the direct involvement of nitrogen coordinated (Fe–Nx) metal based active centers in oxygen electrochemistry. Overall, the experimental outcome of the present study suggests that Fe–Nx/C enriched electrocatalysts have potential to serve as a promising bi-functional electro-catalyst for both the OER and ORR and therefore beneficial for next generation electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.
Experimental section
Materials
For the synthesis of FC3R and FC10R, the precursors used are melamine (C3H6N6, S.D. Fine Chemicals, 97.5% purity) and ferrocene (Merck, 98% purity). For the electrochemical studies Milli-Q water (conductivity ∼5 × 10−8 S) and sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH, S.D. Fine Chemicals, AR grade) are used for making the required alkaline solution. For the poisoning studies, sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN, from Sigma-Aldrich, purity ≥98%) is used. For the proto-type battery fabrication, an aluminium wire (2 cm long, 4 mm diameter, a common household object) is used as the anode material. For the comparative studies, commercial Pt–C (20 wt% Pt loading on amorphous carbon, from Arora-Matthey, Kolkata, India) and RuO2 (from Sigma-Aldrich, purity ∼99.9 trace metals basis) have been used.
Synthesis process of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40)
FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) were synthesized by pyrolysing32 80 mg ferrocene and 100 mg of melamine at 750 °C (the temperature ramping rate used for the studies are 3, 10, 25 and 40 °C min−1, and consequently the samples are named FC3R, FC10R, FC25R and FC40R, respectively) for 1.1 h duration. The motive of ramping rate variations was to introduce structural change as the ramping rate controls the availability of reactant carbon moieties. For the pyrolysis, a tube furnace (Lenton LTF 14/--/180) was used and the synthesis was carried out in a quartz tube (1 cm diameter and 100 cm in length) as shown in Fig. S15.† The precursors were kept at the closed end of the quartz tube while the other end was connected to a rubber bladder (Fig. S15†). After the experiments, the tube furnace was allowed to cool down to room temperature.
Characterization technique
The as-synthesized FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) were characterized using an FEI SIRION scanning electron microscope(SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution TEM (HRTEM) and elemental mapping were performed on an FEI-TITAN-G2-60-300 microscope operated at 300 keV, equipped with an X-FEG, and a four quadrant detector was used for performing energy dispersive spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a PAN analytical instrument with a Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) source, and the Raman study was performed with a Nd:YAG laser (excitation wavelength used was 532 nm, WITec, Germany). For determining the chemical composition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an AXIS ULTRA DLD instrument from Kratos, equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source. In order to study the specific surface area and pore size distribution in the samples, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were carried out at 77 K with a Quantachrome instrument. The BET analysis was carried out for the estimation of the specific surface area, while the porosity study was evaluated using the BJH model. The electrochemical ORR and OER characterization was performed by CV, and RDE and RRDE voltammetry (CHI instrument 700E, USA) with a traditional three electrode set-up comprising of an electrocatalyst modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, electrode active geometric area ∼0.07 cm2 for RRD and 0.196 cm2 for RRDE), Pt-ring and KCl saturated Ag/AgCl as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively, in alkaline aqueous solution.
Electrochemical characterization
For the electrochemical studies, the stock solutions of all respective electrocatalysts (FC3R, FC10R, FC25R, FC40R, Pt–C and RuO2) were prepared by dispersing 7 mg of each in 1 ml of Milli-Q water followed by 30 minutes of sonication for better dispersion. From the stock solutions, 75 μl was taken and mixed appropriately with 15 μl of Nafion® solution (5%, Sigma Aldrich) and is drop-cast on the GCE for the electrochemical studies. The catalyst loading (0.75, 1 and 1.25 mg cm−2) was optimized for the OER by drop casting FC10R solution on the RDE-GCE electrode (geometric area ∼0.07 cm2) followed by drying prior to the electrochemical measurements. The optimum OER activity is achieved for a loading of 1 mg cm−2. The OER and RDE-LSV polarization curves were recorded in nitrogen-purged 1 M NaOH solution at 1200 rpm with a scan speed of 10 mV s−1 in a potential window of 0 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The ORR and RDE/RRDE-LSV polarization curves were recorded in oxygen-purged 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution in the potential window of 0.1 to −0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl at various electrode rotation speeds and a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1. The K–L equation and plots (J−1vs. ω−1/2) at different potentials are used to determine the electron transfer number and kinetic current densities.9,23 In addition to the number of electrons transferred, the % H2O2 generation was deduced from the RRDE-polarization curves. The poisoning tests were carried out on FC10R in oxygen saturated 0.1 M NaOH + 50 mM NaSCN solution. Commercially available state-of-the-art electrocatalysts like Pt–C/RuO2 are used for the comparative ORR/OER studies. As the geometric surface area of the electrode (RDE-GCE ∼ 0.07 and RRDE-GCE ∼ 0.196 cm2) is used for current normalization in the current study, the loading of commercial catalysts was maintained as 1 mg cm−2. For the calculation of the overall oxygen electrochemistry efficiency of the catalysts under study, the recorded OER/ORR polarization curves with the saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were converted with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation ERHE = Eo Ag/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + EAg/AgCl where Eo Ag/AgCl is 0.197 V vs. SHE. In order to obtain the ECSA, the actual Cdl values were used as obtained by loading 1 mg cm−2 of FCMR (M = 3, 10, 25, 40) in nitrogen-purged 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (Cdl ∼ 0.19, 0.54, 0.44 and 0.14, respectively, for FC3R, FC10R, FC25R and FC40R).
