    , Accepted 16th November 2020First published on 17th November 2020AbstractQuasi-two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites have lately attracted extensive research interest due to their superior environmental stability to their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts. While solar cells based on 2D layered perovskites have achieved remarkably high efficiencies over 18%, their intrinsic carrier dynamics after photoexcitation remain obscure due to the presence of bound excitons and the coexistence of multiple layered perovskite phases. Discrepancies were found in the interpretations of the reported ultrafast processes with hundreds of femto- or pico-second time scales in previous literature via transient absorption measurements. Here, carrier dynamics in (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3; MA = CH3NH3) 2D layered perovskite was systematically studied through a combination of transient absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements with femtosecond time resolution. The ultrafast sub-ps (100–400 fs) carrier dynamics is unambiguously demonstrated due to hot carrier relaxation. Carrier transport occurs from small n layered perovskites to their surrounding 3D like (large n) perovskite via energy transfer on the time scale of 2–300 ps. These results provide valuable information on the intrinsic carrier dynamics in 2D layered perovskites which would be helpful in further improving the device performance.
Introduction
Over the past decade, three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with the formula of ABX3 (A = CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+, Cs+; B = Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) have attracted tremendous attention owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as large absorption coefficients,1 high mobilities,2,3 long carrier diffusion lengths4,5 and band gap tunability.6,7 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has leapt from the initial 3.8% in 20098 to 25.5% in 2020,9 and is approaching its theoretical limit.10 However, the poor long-term stability against thermal and atmospheric moisture directly obstructs their large scale commercial applications.11 Compared to 3D perovskite materials, quasi-two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites have shown excellent stabilities against ambient environments. To date, the Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite (RPP) is the most studied quasi-2D layered perovskite which comprises n blocks of inorganic [PbI6]2− octahedral slabs separated by organic cations (R) following the chemical formula of R2An−1BnX3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, …), where R is usually a large alkylammonium cation such as phenethylammonium (PEA)12–14 or n-butylammonium (BA).15,16 The organic spacer (R) acts as an intrinsic protection and passivation layer against moisture, which results in superior stability against the ambient environment in 2D RPPs compared to their 3D counterparts. However, it also leads to a strong quantum and dielectric confinement, which widens the optical band gap and confines electron–hole pairs to form excitons with binding energy greater than room temperature thermal energy.17–19 Intuitively, the insulating nature of the organic layers is expected to inhibit the transport of charge carriers,20 and the high exciton binding energy will not be conducive for solar cells which require high charge separation efficiency. Nonetheless, high PCEs of >18% have been achieved in 2D layered PSCs.21,22
Further improvements on the 2D layered PSC performance will require an understanding of the intrinsic carrier transport mechanism, which is currently complicated by the presence of strongly bound excitons and the coexistence of multiple phases in 2D RPPs. It has been reported that multiple perovskite phases with different n values (n = 1, 2, 3, …, ∞) coexist and show structural gradient distribution vertically in a typical 2D RPP film although they were intended to be grown as a single phase.23 Even in the same horizontal layer of a 2D RPP film, there is also a mixture of multiple perovskite phases with various n values.13,24 So far, discrepancies remain in both the time scales and the mechanisms of carrier transport in 2D RPPs in the present literature. Previous studies reported a decay process of either hundreds of fs or a few to hundreds of ps in the small n RPP phases, and a corresponding rise in the large n RPP phases via time-resolved spectroscopy measurements, which is attributed to the carrier transport between the mixed perovskite phases via charge or energy transfer.13,24–29 Recent theoretical study suggests that both type-I and type-II band alignments could coexist in 2D perovskite heterostructures due to the “softness” of inorganic layers and the electron–phonon coupling at room temperature, which makes the intrinsic carrier transport mechanism even more complicated.30 Although there are also reports on the fabrication of phase pure 2D perovskite films,31,32 to date, 2D PSCs with the highest PCEs are still based on mixed phase films.21,22 It indicates that the carrier dynamics and charge transport in mixed phase 2D layered perovskites play a key role in enhancing the performance of 2D layered PSCs.
In this work, we systematically investigated the carrier relaxation process in a prototypical 2D RPP system, (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3). The carrier dynamics in (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 is spectrally and temporally characterized employing transient absorption (TA) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) techniques. Global analysis of the excitation-dependent TA spectra helps clarify the controversial interpretations of the TA results from previous literature. The combination of excitation-dependent TA and fs TRPL results provides unambiguous evidence for hot carrier relaxation which proceeds on a time scale of a few hundreds of fs, and the subsequent carrier transport from small n (n = 1, 2, 3) to large n (n ≥ 10) RPP phases via energy transfer on a time scale of 2–300 ps. The large n phase (3D-like) perovskites act as a reservoir and collect charge carriers from small n 2D layered perovskites, and the charge carriers continue to transport within the 3D-like perovskite networks with the advantageous high carrier mobilities and long carrier lifetimes. These results provide basic insights for understanding the carrier dynamics and charge transportation in mixed phase 2D layered perovskites, as well as the working mechanisms of 2D layered perovskite based solar cells.
Results and discussion
Material preparation and steady-state characterization
2D RPP films with a nominal composition of (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3; MA = CH3NH3) were fabricated on glass substrates by spin-coating following the previous report with slight modifications.24 Steady-state absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-prepared RPP film are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The features exhibited in the absorption and PL spectra confirm the presence of multiple RPP phases with n = 1, 2, 3… ∞ in the fabricated (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 film, in agreement with previous reports.23,24 It also indicates that the fabricated n = 3 RPP film is suitable to intentionally study the carrier transport between the mixed 2D perovskite phases with different n values.
Excitation-dependent transient absorption (TA) spectra
Excitation-dependent TA measurements were carried out by pumping into different excitonic absorption bands under excitation wavelengths (λexc) of 400, 530, 570 and 610 nm, respectively. Since multiple perovskite phases coexist and arrange along the direction vertical to the substrate from small to large n,23 the sample is excited from the glass substrate side in order to primarily excite the small n perovskite phases. To focus on the early time TA spectra, the time delay steps were set to be linear within the first 5 ps and logarithmic from 5 to 5000 ps in all TA experiments. The obtained TA spectra are shown in Fig. 1a–d. Upon excitation at a shorter wavelength (higher photon energy) of 400 nm, all RPP phases with n from 1 to ∞ are excited simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 1a, the negative ΔA signal due to ground state bleaching (GSB) shows features corresponding to the excitonic absorption peaks with different n values. For large n (n ≥ 10) RPP phases, the quantum confinement effect is rather weak, and thus the absorption and PL spectra are similar to those of 3D perovskites.13,18 Therefore, for simplicity, we hereafter use n ≥ 10 to represent the large n RPPs which generate the broad GSB band centered at ∼750 nm. Next, we shifted the excitation to a longer wavelength of 530 nm. Although the excitation photon energy is reduced compared to that of λexc = 400 nm, it is still sufficient to excite all RPP phases, as schematically shown in Fig. 1e. Therefore, similar TA spectra would be expected under excitation at 400 and 530 nm. However, strikingly, TA spectra under λexc = 400 nm exhibit a substantially more intense positive signal within the first 2 ps compared to those under λexc = 530 nm (Fig. 1a and b, purplish curves). To be specific, a pronounced broad positive ΔA signal which corresponds to the photoinduced absorption (PIA) is present in the TA spectra under λexc = 400 nm (Fig. 1a), while its magnitude becomes significantly smaller under λexc = 530 nm (Fig. 1b). Intriguingly, this short-lived PIA signal diminishes with further increasing the excitation wavelength to 570 and 610 nm (Fig. 1c and d). Under direct excitation at the excitonic absorption band of n = 2 at λexc = 570 nm, only n ≥ 2 RPPs are excited (Fig. 1e); therefore, the GSB signal corresponding to n = 1 disappears as shown in Fig. 1c. Under λexc = 610 nm, mainly n ≥ 3 RPPs are excited and the short-lived PIA signal nearly completely vanishes (Fig. 1d). Biexcitons were previously reported in 2D layered perovskites via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy.33,34 We can rule out the possibility that the positive TA signal in Fig. 1 is due to biexcitons for several reasons. First, the lifetime of the positive TA signal is ultrafast (hundreds of fs) which is implausible for biexcitons. Second, the excitation intensity needs to be high enough to form biexcitons. Moreover, the TA signal of biexcitons will show superlinear (square) dependence on the excitation intensity. In our work, we kept the excitation power as low as possible for all TA measurements to ensure that the magnitude of the TA signal depends linearly on the excitation intensity.

TA kinetics at probe wavelengths corresponding to the GSB bands of small n (n = 1, 2, 3) and large n (n ≥ 10) RPPs under various excitation wavelengths are shown in Fig. 2. The general features present in the TA kinetics can be summarized as follows: the GSB kinetics of small n RPPs undergo fast decay which is accompanied by the buildup of the GSB signal of large n RPPs. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2a, there is an ultrafast decay within hundreds of fs in the TA kinetics of small n RPPs and a corresponding rise in the TA kinetics of large n RPPs. In a longer time window as shown in Fig. 2b, there is an additional ps decay (small n) and rise process (large n). A four exponential decay model is applied to get satisfactory fitting for the TA kinetics at various probe wavelengths and the resulting time constants are tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). The obtained ultrafast time component τ0 is around 0.1–0.5 ps which varies with pump and probe wavelengths. The ps decay components (τ1 and τ2) for small n RPPs are in the range of 2–280 ps. In addition, there is also a weakly weighted ns decay component τ3 which could be assigned to the excitonic traps.35 These ultrafast time components are consistent with those reported previously via TA measurements which are assigned to the carrier transport between the mixed perovskite phases via electron and/or energy transfer.13,24–27 Shang et al. reported that hole transfer proceeds at a longer time scale of 400 ps by observing tiny GSB signals from small n phases upon selectively exciting the large n (n ≥ 10) RPP phases.24 In order to study the possible hole transfer from large n to small n RPP phases, we also pumped the 2D perovskite film from the front face (air side) and selectively excited the large n RPPs using λexc = 770 nm, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). However, we did not observe distinguishable GSB signals corresponding to small n RPP phases. Later time-resolved photoluminescence results also confirm that there is no visible hole transport process from large n to small n RPPs in our studied system.

Pseudo-color (ΔA) representations of the TA spectra under excitation at 400 and 570 nm as a function of probe wavelength and delay time between the pump and probe (within the first 2 ps time window) are shown in Fig. 3a and b. It is clearly seen that there is a blue-purple pattern which decays on a time scale of a few hundreds of fs under λexc = 400 nm, while this pattern nearly disappears under λexc = 570 nm. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2a, with increasing the excitation wavelength from 400 to 610 nm, the ultrafast rise time in the TA kinetics of large n RPPs decreases. These features provide strong evidence for a hot carrier relaxation process. This ultrafast process is further investigated via performing kinetic analyses of the TA data sets using SVD36 followed by global fitting to a kinetic rate model based on hot carrier relaxation described by eqn (1) and (2):37 (1) (2)where N1 is the population of initially generated “hot” carriers, τ0 is the hot carrier relaxation time, N2 and τ are the population and lifetime of carriers relaxed to the band edge, respectively. Here, since our focus is on the femtosecond process, global fitting was performed for the TA spectra within the first 2 ps for simplicity. In this scenario, we fix the lifetime of τ to be infinite as the TA kinetics show no obvious decay within 2 ps (Fig. 2a). The extracted species-associated spectra are presented in Fig. 3c and d. The blue lines represent the TA spectra of N1, i.e., hot carriers. The red lines represent the TA spectra of the relaxed carriers (excitons). The main difference between Fig. 3c and d exists in the blue curves, while the red curves are quite alike. The distinct hot carrier associated spectra could be attributed to the formation of hot carriers with different initial energies under various λexc. These hot carriers finally relax to the same band edge state, resulting in similar spectra of N2. Therefore, a longer relaxation time τ0 would be expected for the hot carriers with higher initial energies generated under shorter excitation wavelength. This is confirmed by the kinetics reconstructed from the global fits, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. The extracted hot carrier relaxation time (τ0) is 0.40 ± 0.01 ps under λexc = 400 nm, which is longer than that under λexc = 570 nm (τ0 = 0.27 ± 0.01 ps). It is worthy to mention that, based on the simplified model described by eqn (1) and (2), the obtained relaxation time τ0 is an average of the carrier relaxation times in all RPP phases. The obtained hot carrier relaxation times are consistent with the reported values for 2D layered perovskite crystals due to electron–phonon interaction.38

Femtosecond-resolved photoluminescence (PL) kinetics
To further verify the hot carrier relaxation and investigate the origin of the subsequent ps conversion process, we performed fluorescence up-conversion measurements to characterize the PL kinetics with fs time resolution. The instrument response function (IRF) is around 300 fs, characterized by measuring the Raman scattering signal from ethanol (Fig. S3, ESI†). With a deconvolution fit, 150 fs time resolution could be achieved. Fig. 4 shows the PL kinetics traces of the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 film at different emission wavelengths corresponding to the excitonic emission peaks of small and large n RPP phases. The PL kinetics are fitted with a four-exponential model with the convolution of IRF. The detailed fitting parameters are tabulated in Table S2 (ESI†). Interestingly, all PL kinetics traces of small n (n = 1, 2, 3) RPPs build up with an ultrafast rise and decay within a few hundreds of ps (Fig. 4a–c). These rise times (τ0) are determined to be τ0 = 0.39 ± 0.05 ps (n = 1), τ0 = 0.22 ± 0.04 ps (n = 2) and τ0 = 0.23 ± 0.06 ps (n = 3), which are in good agreement with the ultrafast process obtained from the TA experiment under 400 nm excitation (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, the PL kinetics in the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 under 400 nm excitation can be explained by the sub-ps hot carrier relaxation to the band edge followed by the subsequent radiative recombination with ps lifetimes, as shown schematically in Fig. 4f. Counter-intuitively, the rise time in the PL kinetics of n = 1 RPP (0.39 ps) is larger than that of the n = 2 and 3 RPPs (∼0.22 ps) under the same excitation wavelength. We assign it to the reduction in the optical phonon relaxation with increasing quantum confinement as reported in perovskite nanocrystals.24 Future study on the layer number and excitation intensity dependence of hot carrier relaxations in 2D perovskites will be highly beneficial while beyond the scope of our study.

(f) The schematic diagram of PL emission upon excitation at 400 nm. 
In contrast to small n phases, the PL signal of large n RPPs mainly builds up on the picosecond time scale, as shown in Fig. 4d. The rise times of PL kinetics for large n (n ≥ 10) RPPs are determined to be 2.4 ± 0.8 ps and 250 ± 60 ps, which are consistent with the ps PL decay times of small n RPPs (Table S2, ESI†). Therefore, we assign this process to energy transfer from small n to large n RPP phases. Energy transfer, either Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) or Dexter energy transfer (DET), will result in an excited state in the acceptor. Therefore, we could expect to observe a fast decay time in the TRPL of the donor due to PL quenching and a corresponding rise time in the TRPL of the acceptor if energy transfer occurs. However, charge transfer results in additional free charges in the acceptor which also quenches the PL of donor, whereas does not enhance the PL intensity of the acceptor. As shown in Fig. 4d, the PL kinetics trace of large n RPP phases shows no visible decay within the 1 ns time window of fluorescence up-conversion measurement. In order to characterize this long-lived PL lifetime, we performed time-resolved PL measurements using the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a longer time window of 12 ns. As shown in Fig. 4e, the PL kinetics of large n RPPs decays with a lifetime of 25 ns with visible ps rise time which agrees with the fluorescence up-conversion results. In addition, the PL kinetics of large n RPPs were also measured under 700 nm excitation to avoid exciting small n RPPs, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The PL recombination lifetime does not vary with excitation wavelength (Fig. S4a, ESI†). However, the ps rise component disappears under 700 nm excitation (Fig. S4b, ESI†), which further proves that the ps rise process is due to energy transfer from small n RPP phases. The invariant PL lifetime under 400 and 700 nm excitations also rules out the hole transport from large n to small n RPPs, in agreement with the above-mentioned TA results and the recent report by Zhou et al.39
Carrier transport mechanism in the quasi-2D layered perovskite
Carrier transport in the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 has been previously studied via various time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. However, discrepancies exist in both the time scales and the transport mechanisms in the present literature. Shang et al. reported efficient electron transfer between the small n (n ≤ 3) perovskite phases on a time scale of 300–500 fs in (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 3 and 5) via TA spectroscopy.24 Proppe et al. also observed an ultrafast process of a few hundreds of fs through TA and 2D electronic spectroscopy in the same 2D RPP system, while they assigned it to energy transfer between multiple RPP phases.25 On the other hand, Qing et al. reported electron transfer from small n (n = 2, 3) to large n (n ≥ 10) phases on the time scale of ∼450 ps in the (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 film (n = 4).26 Proppe et al. also reported charge transfer on the time scale of 1–100 ps in (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 3 and 5).25,28 Nevertheless, Williams et al. suggested that energy transfer proceeds on the time scale of 30–120 ps in (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 2 and 3).27 Yuan et al. suggested that cascade energy transfer occurs on the 100 fs to 100 ps time scale from small n to large n phases in (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 films (n = 3).13
According to the TA experimental and global analysis results in our study, the TA spectra of the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 are complicated by the strong spectral overlap between the absorption of hot carriers and the GSB signals of multiple RPP phases, which makes it difficult to draw a definite conclusion based on single wavelength kinetics analysis. For instance, the GSB kinetics of n = 1, 2 and n ≥ 10 RPPs under λexc = 400 nm (Fig. 2a) show hundreds of fs decay and rise which seemingly indicate the presence of an ultrafast conversion process (e.g. charge or energy transfer) between the small n and large n RPP phases. However, the global analysis clearly shows that the origin of this ultrafast decay or rise is actually due to the spectral overlap with the short-lived TA signal from hot carriers (Fig. 3c). The absence of this decay, while the presence of the corresponding rise in the TRPL kinetics of small n RPPs, further confirms this point. Therefore, the hundreds of fs ultrafast carrier dynamics in 2D perovskites is due to hot carrier relaxation rather than the previously suggested carrier transport between the mixed RPP phases via charge or energy transfer. The hot carrier relaxation time (100–400 fs) in the 2D layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 is on a similar time scale to that reported in 3D perovskites40–42 and perovskite nanocrystals.24,43 Moreover, hot carriers have been extracted successfully in 3D perovskites44 and perovskite nanocrystals,24 indicating potential utilization of hot carriers to enhance the performance of 2D perovskite based optoelectronic devices toward breaking the Shockley–Queisser limit.45,46
In our study, through the combination of fs-resolved TA and TRPL experimental results, carrier transport is demonstrated to occur on a time scale of 2–300 ps from small n to large n RPP phases via energy transfer. Our observation is consistent with the recent report by Zhou et al. employing nonlinear photocurrent/fluorescence spectroscopy to selectively probe charge/energy transfer which suggests that energy transfer between different phases dominates the sub-ns time scale, while electron transfer occurs at later times.39 Yan et al. also claimed that energy transfer dominates the first 500 ps time scale via two-dimensional TA spectroscopy.47 Based on the analyses above, the carrier dynamics in the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 2D perovskite upon photoexcitation are schematically plotted in Fig. 5a. The photoexcitation generates initial hot carriers which relax toward the band edge on a time scale of 100–400 fs depending on the excitation photon energy and layer number. Subsequent carrier transport from small n to large n perovskite phases proceeds on a time scale of 2–300 ps via energy transfer. Then the charge carriers in large n RPPs recombine radiatively on the tens of ns time scale.

It is worthy to mention that we did not observe a cascade energy transfer between small n RPPs as proposed previously.13,27 PL signals from all small n RPPs build up with only hundreds of fs hot carrier relaxation time, while the ps rise is solely observed in the PL kinetics of large n RPPs. This suggests that efficient energy transfer proceeds directly from the individual RPP phase with small n (n = 1, 2, 3…) to the large n (n ≥ 10) RPPs. In (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 2D layered RPPs, multiple phases of perovskites are arranged along the direction vertical to the substrate from small to large n and also coexist randomly in the same horizontal planes.13,24 Lin et al. reported that the 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 thin films comprise multiple layered (small n) perovskite phases surrounded by 3D-like (large n) perovskites via morphology characterization on both microscopic and nanoscopic scales.48 Therefore, the carrier transport mechanism in our studied (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 2D layered perovskite system can be depicted schematically in Fig. 5b. Picosecond carrier transport proceeds directly from the small n RPP phases to their surrounding large n RPP phases via energy transfer. The large n phase (3D-like) perovskites act as a reservoir and collect charge carriers from small n 2D perovskites, and the charge carriers continue to transport within the 3D-like perovskite networks with their advantageous high carrier mobilities and long carrier lifetimes. This carrier transport mechanism facilitates high charge collection efficiencies and thus high PCEs in 2D perovskite solar cells, although in the presence of strong quantum and dielectric confinement effects.
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the carrier dynamics in the prototypical quasi-2D layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10via ultrafast spectroscopic techniques including excitation-dependent TA and fs time-resolved PL. Our study reveals that the photogenerated carrier relaxation pathway is dominated by hot carrier relaxation on a time scale of 100–400 fs and the subsequent carrier transport from small n perovskite phases to their surrounding large n perovskite phases via energy transfer on the time scale of 2–300 ps. Charge carriers are collected from the small n layered perovskite phases and they continue to transport within the 3D-like large n perovskite networks with longer lifetimes and higher mobilities. This carrier transport mechanism is suggested to result in the high efficiencies achieved in 2D PSCs. These results offer a deep insight into the carrier dynamics and transport mechanisms in 2D layered perovskites and provide valuable information for future development of 2D perovskite based solar cells with enhanced performance.

Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI), lead iodide (PbI2) and phenethylammonium (C6H5CH2CH2NH3I, PEAI) powders were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp (purity > 99%). Anhydrous DMF and DMSO were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Chlorobenzene (purity > 99.5%) was purchased from Macklin. All chemicals were used as received without further purification unless otherwise stated.
Sample preparation
The 2D layered perovskite (n = 3) precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 249.2 mg PEAI, 159.1 mg MAI and 692.3 mg PbI2 (1:1:1.5 molar ratio) in 2 mL of a 1:1 mixture of DMF and DMSO, resulting in a precursor solution with a concentration of 35 wt%. This precursor solution was stirred at 70 °C for 4 h. Glass substrates were cleaned using Hellmanex III solution (1%) and isopropanol solution in an ultrasonication system for 5 min, respectively, sequentially dried with a compressed air gun, and then cleaned with an ultraviolet/ozone treatment for 30 min.
The 2D layered perovskite films with a nominal composition of (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3; MA = CH3NH3) were fabricated using a sequential two-step spin-coating procedure. First, the precursor solution was spin-coated on a pre-cleaned glass substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s. During the spin coating, 25 mL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the 2D layered perovskite film. The obtained film was finally annealed on a hot plate at 80 °C for 15 min to remove the residual solvent. The whole fabrication procedure was conducted in a nitrogen filled glove box. The samples were stored in a vacuum and used as is without intentional encapsulation.
Steady-state characterization
Steady-state absorption spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV 3600 Plus spectrometer and recorded with an integrating sphere to eliminate the influence due to scattering. The steady-state PL spectra were recorded using a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) under excitation at 460 nm.
Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy
The TA spectra were collected using an amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (Solstice Ace, Spectra Physics), with an output of 800 nm at 1 kHz repetition rate, 35 fs pulse width, and a power of 5.6 W. 20% of the output 800 nm (1.12 W) was delivered to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-prime, Newport) to generate the tunable pump pulses. A small portion of 800 nm fundamental beams (500 nJ per pulse) was focused onto a 3 mm sapphire plate to produce the white-light continuum (WLC) probe pulses. A computer-controlled, piezo-driven high precision translation stage (Physik Instrumente) incorporated with a long travel range motorized stage (Newport) was placed in the pump beam arm to generate a time delay between pump and probe pulses with 1 fs time delay precision and 8 ns time window.
TA spectra were analyzed via singular value decomposition (SVD) using lab-written Matlab programs. SVD deconvolutes the two dimensional spectra to produce an orthonormal set of basis spectra which describe the wavelength dependence of the species and a corresponding set of orthogonal vectors which describe the time-dependent amplitude of the basis spectra.36 A species-associated first order kinetics model49 (eqn (1) and (2)) was fit to a linear combination of the time-dependent amplitude vectors, and the same linear combination of basis spectra was used to construct the spectra for the chemical species.
Femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion
The fluorescence lifetimes were recorded with a time resolved fluorescence spectrometer (Newport) in combination with a mode-locked Ti–sapphire laser (Mai Tai DeepSee, Spectra-Physics). Briefly, the femtosecond laser system generated light pulses at 800 nm for a duration of 200 fs at a repetition rate of 80 MHz and with an average power of 2.9 W. The frequency of the laser pulse was doubled with a BBO crystal and used for excitation. The residual fundamental pulse that served as a gate pulse was split from the pump beam with a beam splitter. The intensity of the excitation beam (400 nm) was kept below 20 mW in order to avoid photochemical degradation of the sample.
Time-resolved single photon counting (TCSPC)
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements with a 12 ns time window were carried out at room temperature by the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique (PicoQuant PicoHarp 300). By use of the deconvolution/fit program (PicoQuant FluoFit) a time resolution down to 10 ps was reached. A wide tuning range (690–1040 nm) titanium–sapphire laser (Mai Thai DeepSee, 150 fs, 80 MHz) was used as the excitation source. The excitation wavelength of 400 nm was generated from the second harmonic of 800 nm, while the 700 nm wavelength was directly from the output of Mai Thai DeepSee.
