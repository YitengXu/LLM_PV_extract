    , Accepted 16th September 2019First published on 16th September 2019AbstractRecent years have witnessed a significant performance breakthrough in all-inorganic perovskite solar cells, but their power conversion efficiencies are still far lower than the theoretical limit and they also suffer from severe moisture instability. Based on the discussions on crystal structures, chemical bonds, and optical and electrical properties of all-inorganic perovskites, we have summarized their comprehensive applications in solar cells and detectors. The effects of monovalent and divalent ion doping, morphology, crystallization control and interface engineering on device performance and stability have been carefully evaluated. A narrow-bandgap CsPbI3 polycrystalline bulk film solar cell has achieved the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.4%, while a stable CsPbBr3 nanocrystal film is a more successful choice in UV-visible and high-energy ray detections. Finally, we call on boosting the performance and stability of solar cells and shortening the response time for tandem photovoltaic and high-speed dynamic detection applications, respectively.

1. Introduction
All-inorganic halide perovskites (CsPbX3, where X = Cl, Br, and I) have attracted increasing interest because of their better thermal and light exposure stability and balanced carrier mobility compared with their organic–inorganic counterparts.1,2 CsPbX3 has several morphologies including single crystals, polycrystalline bulk films, and nanocrystal films, and all of them can be prepared based on a solution-processing bottom-up growth method. Importantly, morphology and composition strongly determine their electrical and optical properties. CsPbBr3 single crystals exhibit an ultrahigh carrier mobility of 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1 while nanosheet (NS) films have a mobility of 77.9 cm2 V−1 s−1.3,4 CsPbI3 polycrystalline films and nanocrystal films have mobilities of 60 and 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.5,6 CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 95%, while CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 nanocrystals have lower PLQYs of 10% and 70%, respectively.7 Based on these unique characteristics, CsPbX3 has been developed for application in solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).8–17
In all-inorganic perovskites, cubic (α) phase CsPbI3 is the best candidate for photovoltaic applications because its narrowest bandgap of 1.73 eV can absorb a large part of the solar spectrum. However, bulk CsPbI3 can only maintain the cubic black phase at high temperature, and it transforms into the non-perovskite orthorhombic (δ) phase at room temperature (RT), losing its photovoltaic property. When bromide is added to the halide anion, the black phase at RT is more stable owing to the increased effective tolerance factor and a lower phase transition temperature.9,18 However, the bandgap is significantly increased with increasing bromide to iodide ratio. Mixed-anion CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 exhibit a bandgap of 1.92 and 2.05 eV, respectively, and this large bandgap limits the short-circuit current (JSC) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A CsPbBr3 PSC has a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) exceeding 1.6 V due to its wide bandgap of 2.3 eV.8,19 Besides, both polycrystalline bulk films and nanocrystal films have been employed in CsPbX3 PSCs. These wide bandgap PSCs have great potential in tandem and semitransparent photovoltaic applications.
Compared with the fact that a wide-band absorption is needed for PSCs to increase the power output, photodetectors work in either a wide-band mode or a narrow-band mode. CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are designed to detect a wide range of 270–532 nm and 270–740 nm, respectively, while CsPbCl3 can be used to respond to a narrow band of 300–400 nm. CsPbX3 nanocrystals with different morphologies including 0D quantum dots (QDs), 1D nanowires (NWs), and 2D NSs can be used to construct these UV-visible light photodetectors. Moreover, the high atomic number makes CsPbX3 suitable for high-energy ray detection. The CsPbBr3 single crystal is a viable candidate for electronic-based high-energy ray detectors. CsPbBr3 QDs and NSs can also be employed as optical-based scintillators to detect high-energy rays.
In this review, we first discuss crystal structures, chemical bonds, and optical and electrical properties of CsPbX3. We then summarize their applications in PSCs, UV-visible photodetectors and high-energy ray detectors, and the impacts of composition, morphology and some strategies including crystallization control, defect passivation and interface engineering on device performance and stability are also evaluated. Finally, we raise several issues including the performance and stability of PSCs, response speed and imaging arrays of photodetectors and propose corresponding solutions.
2. Properties of CsPbX3 perovskites
2.1 Crystal structures
CsPbX3 consists of 3D interconnected [PbX6]4− octahedra with Cs+ occupying the voids between the adjacent octahedra. When the Goldsmith tolerance factor (t) ranges from 0.8 to 1.0, the photo-active black-phase perovskite is favorable. Octahedra are stable when the octahedral factor (μ) is between 0.4 and 0.9. The t and μ values of CsPbCl3 (0.93, 0.54), CsPbBr3 (0.92 and 0.5) and CsPbI3 (0.89 and 0.47) explain their stable crystal structure at RT. CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 have 3D orthorhombic phases while CsPbI3 has a 1D orthorhombic phase (yellow phase, bandgap of 2.82 eV) at RT, and its desired 3D polymorph (black phase, bandgap of 1.73 eV) can be obtained only above 315 °C (Fig. 1a).20,21 CsPbCl3 undergoes cubic to tetragonal and tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transitions at 47 and 42 °C, respectively. CsPbBr3 undergoes cubic to tetragonal and tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transitions at 130 and 88 °C, respectively.18,22 By contrast, CsPbI3 undergoes a more complicated phase transition when the temperature decreases. Recently, cubic (α) (1.73 eV), tetragonal (β) (1.68 eV), and orthorhombic (γ) (1.75 eV) phases of CsPbI3 were distinguished clearly, and all three phases are black phases.23,24 Before a careful structural refinement, an actual β or γ phase is thought as an α phase mistakenly due to their very close XRD patterns. By conducting an in situ temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction, it is found that CsPbI3 undergoes cubic (α) to tetragonal (β) and then to orthorhombic (γ) phase transitions at 281 and 184 °C, respectively, and all three phases are black phases. When this orthorhombic (γ) CsPbI3 is exposed to moist air, it can transform into a nonperovskite orthorhombic (δ) phase quickly (Fig. 1b).21,25 Perovskite black phase CsPbI3 is necessary for photovoltaic applications because the large bandgap of the yellow phase significantly reduces long-wavelength light absorption, and its poor electronic transport is not desirable. Yellow phase CsPbI3 can be stimulated to emit blue light, and it has been reported as a high-stable blue-light photodetector.26

A 3D cubic structure is observed in α-CsPbI3, a 3D orthorhombic structure is found in CsPbBr3 and FA-doped CsPbI3 QDs, a 1D hexagonal structure is found in yellow FAPbI3, and a 1D orthorhombic structure is found in yellow CsPbI3.20 Copyright 2017, American Chemical Society. (b) Temperature-induced phase transitions in CsPbI3. The initial orthorhombic δ phase (yellow nonperovskite) can be converted to the cubic α phase (black perovskite) at high temperature. Upon cooling, the cubic α phase can convert into the tetragonal β phase and orthorhombic γ phase in order, and these metastable phases can be transformed into the orthorhombic δ phase at RT.21 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. 
Different from polymorphs in the bulk, small grain size and organic molecules covering the grain boundary can adjust the polymorph stability of perovskites due to the surface effect. For example, the black phase of CsPbI3 can be maintained at RT based on QDs and small grains in polycrystalline films. However, the black phase of QDs cannot be maintained for a long time because weak bonds lead to the easy loss of surface ligands. A-site cation doping provides another method to stabilize the black phase of CsPbI3, and smaller inorganic or larger organic cations are introduced based on different mechanisms. Smaller alkali metal cations including Rb+, K+ and Na+ work by adding more inorganic elements and increasing the entropy of mixing.27,28 By contrast, larger organic cations such as CH3(CH2)3NH3+ (BA+), C6H5CH2CH2NH3+ (PEA+) and NH2C2H4NH3+ (EDA+) can be incorporated into the 3D perovskite structure as a bulky organic spacer to form 2D multilayered perovskites.29–32 Compared to 3D perovskites, quasi-2D perovskites show a better crystal structure tolerance.
2.2 Chemical bonds
In the all-inorganic perovskite structure, the bandgap and energy band dispersion are mainly determined by the chemical bond between the metal and halogen. An increasing electronegativity is obtained when halogen is from I to Cl, and the larger electronegativity differences between the halogen and lead result in more ionic bond character, producing a shorter bond length and a larger bandgap.33 First, ionic bonds lead to soft lattices of CsPbX3. Halide perovskites have lower crystal lattice energies than oxide perovskites, leading to their much lower melting points. For example, the melting point of 570 °C for CsPbBr3 is far lower than that of 2000 °C for CaTiO3. Besides, their ionic bonds lead to a small formation energy of vacancies of 0.5 eV, and producing enormous concentration of Cs and halide vacancies enables the high mobility of cations and anions. The positive consequence is that composition regulation can be achieved by a facile cation or anion exchange, and the negative effects include photoinduced ion separation, ionic conduction and hysteresis in solar cells.34
Second, CsPbX3 nanocrystals have ‘soft’ and predominantly ionic lattices, resulting in highly dynamic ligands with a high diffusion coefficient of 166 μm2 s−1, so they often lose their colloidal stability or even structural integrity due to the desorption of those weak binding ligands with a single headgroup such as oleic acid and oleylamine. By contrast, zwitterionic molecules have several anchoring groups including quaternary ammonium and deprotonated acid groups, leading to a much more tight coordination to the surface atoms of CsPbX3 nanocrystals (Fig. 2a).35,36
 Fig. 2  (a) Schematic of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with dynamic binding using conventional ligands and tight binding using zwitterionic ligands.35 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. (b) Schematic of the electronic band structure of defect-tolerant CsPbX3 perovskites.38 Copyright 2018, Nature Publishing Group. 
Third, chemical bonds also have an impact on defect-related electronic states. The bandgap of CsPbX3 is formed between two antibonding orbitals, one is mixed halide 3/4/5p and Pb 6s character in the valence band, and the other is Pb 6p character in the conduction band. Although the formation energy of vacancy is low, the defect states of vacancy or dangling bonds reside within the conduction band or valence band (Fig. 2b).37–39 These benign defects in CsPbX3 contribute to their defect tolerance, explaining high PLQYs of nanocrystals without surface passivation and high efficiency of photovoltaics based on polycrystalline films.
Fourth, the substantially ionic bond character can facilitate the preparation of CsPbX3 nanocrystals at low temperatures ranging from 200 °C to RT, which is obviously different from the high synthesis temperature required by metal chalcogenide nanocrystals with highly covalent bonds. One preparation method is hot-injection. CsPbX3 nanocrystals are obtained by reacting Cs-oleate with a Pb-halide, and their nucleation and growth occur quickly within the first 1–3 s based on an ionic metathesis reaction.40 The other method is called coprecipitation or supersaturated recrystallization conducted at RT. With the assistance of ligands, when precursors in a good solvent are mixed with a poor solvent, cations and anions can coprecipitate forming CsPbX3 nanocrystals.7,41
2.3 Synthetic approaches of nanocrystals
The hot-injection method is conducted at a high reaction temperature and in an inert atmosphere. It can produce CsPbX3 nanocrystals with high degree of monodispersity, good phase purity, narrow full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and high PLQYs. However, it also suffers from low batch-to-batch reproducibility and small-scale production.42 The traditional hot-injection method was first used to synthesize CsPbX3 nanocrystals by Kovalenko's group in 2015.40 Generally, they are synthesized by swiftly injecting cesium oleate into an octadecene solution containing PbX2, oleic acid (OA), and oleylamine (OAm) at high temperature (Fig. 3a). OA chelates with surface lead atoms while OAm interacts with surface halide atoms. We have summarized the roles of ligands including functional groups, chain length, ratio and amount in controlling the size and shape in our previous review.43 For example, Pan et al. found that nanocubes with increasing size were obtained by decreasing the carbon chain length of acids, and thinner nanoplatelets were obtained from shorter carbon chain amines.44

Ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP), also called supersaturated recrystallization, is conducted at RT and in air. It can be finished within a few minutes, and extended to gram-scale preparation easily.45 Generally, the inorganic salt and organic acid and amine are dissolved in a highly polar solvent, such as N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and then a precise volume of this precursor solution is dropped into a nonpolar solvent, such as toluene. Due to the huge solubility difference of the inorganic salt in DMF and toluene, the transfer from DMF to toluene produces a highly supersaturated state immediately and then induces rapid recrystallization (Fig. 3b).7 For example, Sun et al. used a RT LARP method to prepare spherical QDs with hexanoic acid and octylamine, nanocubes with oleic acid and dodecylamine, nanorods with acetate acid and dodecylamine and nanoplatelets with oleic acid and octylamine.46
The highly ionic lattice endows perovskite nanocrystals with adjusting composition by the anion ion exchange reaction. It occurs quickly at RT and the composition can be finely tuned by adding a certain amount of halide precursors. Shape and crystal structure of nanocrystals can be preserved. For example, Akkerman et al. studied the effects of different halide precursors including tetrabutylammonium halides (TBA-X), octadecylammonium halides (ODA-X) and oleylammonim halides (OLAM-X). They found that anion exchange only worked from I to Br or from Br to Cl using TBA-X, while the reverse exchange did not work. However, the anion exchange was reversible for ODA-X and OLAM-X (Fig. 3c).47 Therefore, hot-injection is suitable for preparing small-scale CsPbX3 nanocrystals with high quality, while LARP is a low-cost method to prepare large-scale products, and anion ion exchange provides a fast and simple method to adjust the composition and optical properties.
2.4 Optical properties

2.4.1 Composition. 
The bandgap and emission spectra of CsPbX3 nanocrystals are readily tunable by adjusting the halide anion. Protesescu et al. reported that the emission wavelength could be shifted from 410 (Cl) to 512 (Br) and 685 (I) nm, and an approximately continuous regulation was achieved by adjusting the ratio of halides in mixed halide nanocrystals (Fig. 4a). Other optical characteristics including narrow emission line widths of 12–42 nm, high PLQYs of 50–90%, and short radiative lifetimes of 1–29 ns were also obtained. They further estimated the Bohr diameters and binding energies of excitons for CsPbCl3 (5 nm, 75 meV), CsPbBr3 (7 nm, 40 meV) and CsPbI3 (12 nm, 20 meV).40 Temperature-dependent PL spectra of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals presented blueshifted, weaker, and broader PL peaks with increasing temperature, indicating that an exciton–optical phonon interaction was dominant. The narrowest emission line width and the smallest Stokes shift were observed for CsPbCl3, which may relate to its large exciton binding energy.7,48

Doping is another method to manipulate the optical properties. Mn2+ is introduced into CsPbCl3 nanocrystals obtaining a strongly Stokes-shifted emission. The bandgap is determined by the perovskite matrix and the emission results from the atomic states of Mn2+, so Mn2+ doping can achieve the change from Mn2+ state emission to excitonic emission.49–52 With 0.8% Mn doping, the largest intensity of Mn emission was obtained, resulting in a larger PLQY of 20.3% than that of 2.8% for undoped CsPbCl3 nanocrystals.53 Mn2+ can also be introduced into CsPbBr3 nanocrystals to achieve a dual-emission at 500 and 600 nm with greatly improved thermal and air stability as a result of enhanced formation energy.54,55 Many other divalent cations such as Cd2+, Zn2+, Sr2+ and Co2+ are also introduced into CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, resulting in a PL peak blue-shift, enhanced excitonic PL and improved stability (Fig. 4b). This blue-shift and stability enhancement result from the lattice contraction due to their smaller ion sizes than Pb2+.55,56


2.4.2 Size. 
When the sizes of CsPbX3 nanocrystals are shrunk down to or even below the size of the excitonic Bohr radius, the wave functions of the carriers become confined, resulting in the blue-shifts of the absorption onset and PL peak. Due to a small Bohr diameter ranging from 5 to 12 nm, many of the reported CsPbX3 nanocrystals display only a weak quantum-confinement or even no confinement at all. With the assistance of long and short chain ligands, NSs or nanoplates (NPs) with thicknesses ranging from a monolayer to several monolayers can be prepared. These NSs have an analogous exciton electronic structure to quantum wells, and strong quantum-confinement leads to a significant blue-shift and an increased exciton binding energy. For example, CsPbBr3 NSs with a thickness of 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 (0.6 nm) monolayers have PL peaks at 488, 477, 462, 435 and 405 nm, respectively (Fig. 4c).57 We also reported a large exciton binding energy of 231.6 meV for 1.8 nm-thick CsPbBr3 NSs in solution, which is relatively larger than that of 40 meV for 20 nm nanocubes. They also have an optical phonon energy of 27.5 meV, which is larger than that of 4.6 meV for 11 nm CsPbBr3 nanocubes. Such a large optical phonon energy is considered as a negative factor to obtain a high PLQY.4 When these NSs assemble into films, they tend to stack together so that enhanced electronic coupling weakens the quantum confinement, leading to the reduction or even absence of blue PL peaks and a decreased exciton binding energy of 149.1 meV.4 Ultrathin NWs and small nanocubes also exhibit strong quantum confinement.40,58,59 These results show a significant effect of size-induced quantum-confinement on optical modulation.


2.4.3 Dimensionality. 
Different from the size-induced quantum confinement of 2D NSs, 1D NWs and 0D QDs, 2D perovskites provide another dimensionality modulation to tailor optical properties. They exhibit a quantum well energy landscape, where the inorganic structure acts as a quantum well and the organic ammonium cation as a quantum barrier. This structure leads to an enhancement of electron–hole Coulomb interactions.60,61 The bandgaps of BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 change progressively from 1.50 eV for n = ∞ to 1.91 eV (n = 4), 2.03 eV (n = 3), 2.17 eV (n = 2) and 2.43 eV (n = 1).62 Similarly, PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 exhibits PL peaks at 1.73 eV (n = ∞), 1.80 (n = 4), 1.82 eV (n = 3), 1.87 eV (n = 2) and 1.94 eV (n = 1).30 At the same time, an increased PL intensity is observed with decreasing n.32

2.5 Electrical properties
The electrical properties of CsPbX3 single crystals, nanocrystal films and polycrystalline bulk films include conductivity, mobility, carrier diffusion length and trap density. The effects of these parameters on device performances will be discussed in Sections 3, 4 and 5. Their electrical properties have been evaluated carefully based on different measurement methods. First, a time-of-flight (TOF) technique was adopted on CsPbBr3 single crystals by fitting the curve of transit time versus voltage, and a high electron mobility of 2290 cm2 V−1 s−1 was calculated. By applying a negative voltage on ITO/CsPbBr3 single crystal/C60/Ag, photogenerated holes were absorbed by the ITO anode, while electrons could travel through the whole single crystal and were collected by the Ag cathode, and C60 played a role in inhibiting the formation of AgBr and accelerating electron extraction.3 Second, a transient photoconductivity measurement was conducted on CsPbBr3 single crystals to obtain a mobility–lifetime product (μτ) of 1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1. Combining a lifetime of 2.5 μs, a mobility of 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 was calculated.63 The μτ and mobility of the CsPbBr3 NS film were obtained as 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 and 2.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.4 The third method is space-charge limited current (SCLC), which is based on fitting the dark current of the CsPbBr3 single crystal by the Mott–Gurney law when it operates in the trap-free SCLC regime, and film defect properties can be revealed. The hole and electron mobilities were estimated to be 2060 and 2240 cm2 V−1 s−1 and their trap densities were about 1 × 109 cm−3.3 The fourth method is the Hall effect measurement. It is suitable for measuring large mobility because a small mobility will only produce a tiny Hall voltage. A high electron mobility of 2270 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for CsPbBr3 single crystals while NS films have a mobility of 77.9 cm2 V−1 s−1.3,4 The fifth method is time-resolved THz spectroscopy, and a remarkably high electron mobility of 4500 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for CsPbBr3 nanocrystal films.64
Although five methods are used, a fairly wide range from 10 to 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CsPbBr3 single crystals was reported, which may result from measurement error and material quality.65 What is the difference among the five methods? First, the structure and sample thickness are different depending on the measurement method. For TOF and SCLC methods, a vertical structure device is needed by sandwiching the sample between two electrodes, while a lateral structure is usually used for transient photoconductivity and Hall effect measurements. Second, TOF and transient photoconductivity are achieved with the assistance of photogenerated carriers, so a small mobility of the photosensitive semiconductor can be measured. SCLC and Hall effect measurements are conducted in the dark, so they are suitable for measuring a large mobility. Third, different techniques provide an AC or DC mobility. Time-resolved THz spectroscopy is a contact-free technique, and it provides intrinsic AC mobility, which is seen as the upper limit of mobility. TOF mobility is generally smaller because such a DC measurement probes a macroscopic range and the charge carriers have an interaction with defects.66
Although the defect tolerance of CsPbX3 is beneficial to achieve superior optical properties, conventional doping using substitutional atoms is rather ineffective for the case of electrical properties. By contrast, organic species modulations at the nanocrystal surface or grain boundary of polycrystalline films seem to be a powerful strategy to modulate electronic coupling and charge carrier type and concentration. Our group employed a facile annealing method to engineer the excitonic separation in 2D CsPbBr3 NS films. By optimizing the annealing temperature, the charge transfer rate was improved from 0.01 to 0.15 ns−1, which were assigned to tunneling and resonant energy transfer domination, respectively. A ligand rearrangement mechanism was proposed to explain this increased charge transfer rate (Fig. 4d).4 Molecular doping offers another modulation strategy. Untreated CsPbI3 nanocrystal films showed a slightly p-type mobility of 1.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and incorporating an electron-accepting dopant resulted in an increased mobility of 5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to its hole injection into nanocrystals while an electron-donating dopant led to a decreased conductivity (Fig. 4e).67
3. Perovskite solar cells
Perovskite crystallization properties including film compactness, grain size, film thickness and phase stability are achieved by controlling the film deposition process. Vacuum deposition offers great advantages such as good uniformity, high reproducibility and mature industrial fabrication facilities. However, it also has obvious shortcomings including high cost and source contamination. By contrast, the solution method provides better flexibility. Many techniques such as spin-coating, spray-coating, doctor blade, slot-casting and roll to roll coating can be utilized to prepare perovskite films, and perovskite composition can be easily optimized by introducing doping elements into precursors. Besides, low-cost and fast deposition speed also push solution deposition as the most widely used method.
Crystallization control, composition optimization, defect passivation and interface engineering are four primary strategies to obtain high PSC performances, which are achieved by producing a positive band offset, reducing the surface recombination velocity and improving the carrier lifetime. After these three conditions are met, thick absorbers can be fabricated to increase the PCE because increased absorber thickness leads to more solar energy absorption contributing to an increased JSC, and an ideal thickness is thought to be from 300 to 500 nm.9,68 We have summarized the performance of all-inorganic PSCs until September 2019 in Table 1. For a CsPbI3 solar cell, a high PCE of 15.71% was obtained from polycrystalline bulk films with ultralarge grains in 2018,69 and the highly crystalline β phase film achieved a record PCE of 18.4% in 2019.24 The highest PCEs of CsPbI3 QD films and 2D perovskite modified 3D film solar cells were13.58% in 2017 and 17.06% in 2018, respectively.6,70 By contrast, the highest PCE of 14.81% was achieved for a CsPbI2Br solar cell with a large grain in 2018.71 A blade-coated CsPbI2Br solar cell has achieved a PCE of 12.5% in 2019, which is the highest performance for 1.0 cm2 all-inorganic PSCs.72 A CsPbBr3 solar cell has obtained the highest PCE of 10.6% in 2019.19

3.1 CsPbI3

3.1.1 Polycrystalline bulk films. 
The crystallization process in the one-step method is controlled by the film drying process including chemicals, solvents, drying methods, composition, additives and annealing temperature, producing perovskite films with varied grain size, compactness and thickness. In particular, the black phase at RT can be maintained based on the composition and grain engineering and surface capping treatment. Although some methods such as doping with Br, small grain size effect and 2D perovskite can stabilize the black phase of CsPbI3, they inevitably broaden the bandgap and hinder carrier transport. A surface organic capping layer can stabilize the black phase through efficient passivation of surface ionic defects, and it has no negative effect of decreasing the carrier transport.
Film morphology and grain size are key factors to avoid current leakage and decrease interface recombination. They are controlled by optimizing crystallization and growth processes, which are affected by the film deposition method. In 2016, Frolovaby et al. utilized thermal evaporation (TE) of CsI and PbI2 to obtain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.3% (forward direction) and 10.5% (backward direction). Thermal annealing at 320 °C led to the growth of grains up to 1–3 μm compared with nonannealed films (50 nm) and 120 °C annealed films (150 nm).73 For solution-processed CsPbI3 films, CsI and PbI2 have high solubility in DMF and DMSO, so an ideal active layer thickness of 300–500 nm is not hard to prepare. However, the crystallinity and grain size need to be adjusted by controlling the annealing temperature. First, a low precursor concentration of 0.5 M and a low annealing temperature of 100 °C were used to prepare a 200 nm thick film under open-air conditions with humidity below 30%, resulting in a low VOC of 0.66 V and a low stabilized power output (SPO) of 1.88%. This poor performance was attributed to the thin film thickness and incomplete phase transition.74
Small grain size is helpful in overcoming the black phase instability of bulk CsPbI3 at RT. Additives including functional molecules and polymers were introduced into the precursor to inhibit grain growth, and small grains were obtained in one-step solution-processed films. In 2017, Wang et al. introduced a small number of zwitterions into the precursor to obtain a 30 nm-grain size via electrostatic interactions between the ions and colloids. Besides, CsPbI3 films with thicknesses of 200, 300, 400 and 600 nm were made with 0.4, 0.65, 0.8 and 1.2 M precursor solutions, respectively. A stabilized PCE of 11.4% was achieved based on the improved phase stability in air and a suitable film thickness of 300 nm (Fig. 5a).68 In 2018, Li et al. added 10 wt% PVP into 0.8 M CsPbI3 DMF/DMSO (1:1) mixed solvent, and a large grain size of over 1 μm and a large thickness of 500 nm were obtained. Different from the reported phase transition of CsPbI3 with a large grain size, acylamino groups of PVP induced electron cloud density enhancement on the surface of CsPbI3, conducive to stabilizing the black phase even on the micrometer scale. The cubic CsPbI3 PSCs exhibit an extra-long carrier diffusion length of over 1.5 μm, the highest PCE of 10.74% and excellent thermal/moisture stability (Fig. 5b).75 Despite the role of small grains produced with the assistance of ligands in stabilizing the black phase, they inevitably lead to a decreased JSC due to the increased grain boundary number. A new kind of short-chain organic terminal group (OTG) molecule was used to stabilize the black phase but not decrease the grain size, and a high PCE of 13.2% and better air stability were obtained. The mechanism is that the cyanoacetic acid group as an anchor can bond with the Pb–I framework, and organic molecules can also passivate surface trap states.76
 Fig. 5  The methods to improve the performance and stability of CsPbI3 polycrystalline bulk film PSCs. (a) Mechanism of black phase stabilization by zwitterions. The size of the PbI2–DMSO colloids is decreased with the assistance of zwitterions due to their interaction with Cs+ and I−. During grain growth, zwitterion molecules are expelled toward the grain surface and boundaries which maintain the small grains by impeding further grain growth.68 Copyright 2017, Elsevier Inc.

Different from the commonly used fast annealing method after spin-coating, Wang et al. developed a solvent-controlled growth (SCG) method in which fresh spin-coated precursor films were first dried at RT, and then they were annealed at 350 °C for 10 min to form complete α-phase CsPbI3. This SCG method slowed down the evaporation rate of the residual DMSO which could enhance the mass transport and diffusion. With the assistance of SCG, more continuous and pinhole-free precursor films could be produced, contributing to an ultralarge grain size of above 5 μm for annealed perovskite films, and thus an amazing PCE of 15.71% was obtained (Fig. 5c).69 Ion doping is a common solution engineering method to adjust film composition. Ca2+ doping can produce a larger grain size, and the formation of a Ca rich oxide layer provided a surface passivation effect. The best SPO of 13.3% was obtained using 5% Ca2+ substitution, and the PSC maintained 85% of its initial efficiency for over 2 months. Besides, an increased VOC was attributed to Ca2+doping-induced bandgap increase.77
Recently, γ and β phase CsPbI3 were demonstrated as more stable phases than the α phase at low temperature. The γ-phase has been fabricated at low temperature (<100 °C) to fabricate high-efficiency and stable CsPbI3 solar cells. Zhao et al. first reported a highly reproducible efficiency of 11.3% for a γ-phase CsPbI3 solar cell, and it also exhibited robust stability in an ambient atmosphere for months. They theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that the γ phase had a significantly lower surface energy than the δ phase, and γ-CsPbI3 was obtained by a simple solution process in which a small amount of H2O manipulated the size-dependent phase formation through a proton transfer reaction.23 However, the γ phase is still a metastable phase and it can easily transform into the δ phase in ambient moisture. The stability can be improved by introducing Ca2+ with a smaller radius to substitute Pb2+. A 0.25% Ca2+-doped γ-CsPbI3 solar cell achieved a PCE of 9.2%, and device stability could be extended to 120 h from 10 h under 20% humidity, resulting from the lower cohesive energy of Ca2+-doped CsPbI3.78 Besides the solution method, TE was developed to prepare γ-phase CsPbI3 with CsI-rich composition, and the device exhibited a SPO of over 11% and very high shelf stability of over 1200 h. The γ-CsPbI3 film exhibited a carrier mobility of above 60 cm2 V−1 s−1, a carrier lifetime larger than 70 ns, and a large diffusion length >2 μm, contributing to a VOC of up to 1.24 eV.5 In 2019, Zhao's group prepared a highly crystalline β phase CsPbI3 film, exhibiting a better phase stability at 70 °C in an inert atmosphere compared with MAPbI3. A record PCE of 18.4% under 45 °C ambient conditions was achieved when the CsPbI3 film was treated with choline iodide, resulting from the increased carrier lifetime and improved energy-level alignment. The encapsulated device retained 95% of its initial PCE in air after 240 hours of continuous illumination at the maximum power point.24 This significant improvement in PCE and stability for CsPbI3 solar cells are encouraging to push continuous progress in all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.


3.1.2 QD films. 
Similar to the result that the stable black phase of CsPbI3 films can be obtained on the basis of the small grain size, QDs with sizes smaller than 20 nm provide a natural platform to obtain the stable black phase at RT. In 2016, Luther's group first reported that CsPbI3 QDs could retain the stable black phase for months in ambient air due to the large contribution of surface energy, and PSCs presented a very high VOC of 1.23 V and PCE of 10.77%. This high VOC resulted from their large bandgap, but QD PSCs suffered from a poor carrier collection efficiency.79 In order to enhance QD coupling, they adopted A-site cation halide salt treatments to tune surface chemistry, and the mobility of FAI-treated CsPbI3 QD films could be improved from 0.23 to 0.50 cm2 V−1 s−1, and thus a certified record PCE of 13.43% and an improved JSC of 15.25 mA cm−2 were obtained (Fig. 6a).6 Besides, Wang et al. used micrometer-sized graphene (μGR) to crosslink CsPbI3 QDs based on its numerous functional groups, and an increased PCE of 11.40% and 5 h stability under 60% humidity and 100 °C thermal stress were obtained. μGR provided a charge transport channel to achieve an efficient electron extraction, and this crosslinked structure suppressed the agglomeration of QDs and thus blocked the phase transition. Besides, μGR can also impede the diffusion of water molecules due to its hydrophobic nature (Fig. 6b).80 In addition, CsPbI3 QDs are commonly synthesized using long-chain oleic acid and oleylamine. They suffer from poor black phase stability and low PCE due to the easy loss of ligands and charge transport hindrance. Short-chain octanoic acid and octylamine were employed to obtain CsPbI3 QDs with a better black phase stability (>180 days) in solution, and PCE was improved from 7.76% to 11.87%, resulting from stronger adsorption energies of short-chain ligands (Fig. 6c).81 This work shows a promising way to maintain black phase stability of CsPbI3 QD films by ligand engineering.

3.1.3 2D perovskite films. 
Compared with 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites show higher chemical and photostability. Their improved crystal stability is related to the large organic amine and the insulating van der Waals gaps, and they have higher formation energies than their 3D counterparts. The improved moisture stability results from the fact that their hydrophobic bulky alkylammonium cations can effectively block the accessible pathways of moisture invasion, providing a steric hindrance for the surface water absorption.82 These large organic groups can suppress ion migration between perovskite multilayers. Besides, when high-n 2D perovskites with small exciton binding energies are introduced at the perovskite/transporting layer interface, favorable carrier transport is beneficial to improve the performance of solar cells.83 First, amine salt as an additive can be introduced into the precursor solution. EDAPbI4 was introduced to stabilize α-CsPbI3 films by forming a 2D component, achieving high phase stability at RT for months and at 100 °C for >150 hours, and a highly reproducible PCE of 11.8% was obtained.84 Phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) was incorporated to form 2D/3D mixed-dimensional PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 films. Black α-CsPbI3 films converted to the completely yellow phase within only 4 hours while 2D/3D CsPbI3 maintained a stable black phase, indicating the role of undesirable phase transition suppression by quasi-2D perovskites. The best performance was obtained from 〈n〉 = 60 films, and its PCE decreased from 12.4% to 10.3% under an ambient atmosphere after 40 days (Fig. 7a). A PCE as high as 15.07% was also obtained for 2D/3D mixed-dimensional perovskites, and the bare cell without any encapsulation showed a negligible PCE loss after 300 h of light soaking, resulting from the stabilized black phase via the steric effect of the formed 2D perovskite (Fig. 7b).85 Second, amine salt can also be used to post-treat CsPbI3 films, and using 2D perovskites as an interface modification layer can passivate defects and improve moisture resistance. Wang et al. demonstrated that the PEAI post-treatment can improve the PCE and stability of CsPbI3 PSCs from 11.2% to 14.3%, and 2 days to 30 days, respectively (Fig. 7c).86 The CsPbI3 film was also post-treated by phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr), resulting in a PCE increase from 13.59% to 17.06%, and it retained 91% of its initial PCE after 500 h of continuous white LED illumination while the PCE of the untreated device dropped to 10% of its initial value after ∼300 h of illumination. The improved PCE was attributed to the enhancement of VOC and FF, indicating bifunctional stabilization including gradient Br doping and surface passivation (Fig. 7d).70 Based on this exciting PCE increasing trend, CsPbI3 PSCs are expected to exhibit a performance close to those of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.

3.2 CsPbI2Br
CsPbI2Br has a lower δ to α phase transition temperature of 100 °C than CsPbI3, contributing to a better phase stability at RT. However, an increased bandgap due to Br introduction can reduce long wavelength light absorption, resulting in a decreased JSC. Generally, CsPbI2Br has similar film preparation technique and crystallization process to CsPbI3 except for the lower solubility of CsBr than CsI and lower annealing temperature, so similar solution-processing methods are used.

3.2.1 Polycrystalline bulk films. 
First, solvents and chemicals are chosen to obtain an ideal CsPbI2Br film thickness. In 2016, Sutton et al. prepared CsPbI2Br PSCs with a dramatic PCE of 9.8% using a 0.4 M DMF solution, but they presented a significant hysteresis and thus delivered a SPO of only 5.6%.18 Beal et al. promoted the SPO to 6.5% with a negligible hysteresis using a 0.4 M DMSO solution.87 To some extent, these low PCEs are limited by a small JSC, resulting from a small film thickness of 150 nm due to a low precursor concentration. There are two kinds of methods to improve precursor concentration. (1) DMF/DMSO mixed solvent is employed to improve the solubility of CsBr due to its stronger polarity and coordination ability. Lau et al. employed a 0.7 M DMF/DMSO (2:1) precursor solution to prepare a 250 nm-thick CsPbI2Br active layer and the PCE was improved to 7.7%.88 A 350 nm-thick active layer was fabricated by Mariotti et al. using a 1 M precursor DMF/DMSO (9:1) solution, and the PCE was improved to 9.08%.89 Zhao et al. achieved a 10.3% PCE with a 300 nm-thick active layer using a 0.83 M DMF/DMSO solution.90 (2) Chemicals with higher solubility such as cesium acetate (CsAc) and CsI are used as the Cs source. A 1.3 M CsAc and HPbX3 DMSO solution was adopted to fabricate CsPbI2Br films with a large thickness of 500 nm, obtaining an improved PCE of 10.99%.29 The usage of CsI can improve the precursor concentration to 0.86 – 1 M, corresponding to a 40 wt% solution.89,91
Second, film morphology and grain size are controlled by optimizing the crystallization and growth processes based on different film deposition methods. A one-step solution method is widely used, and homogeneous, pinhole-free and large grain size films are expected to form by adjusting solvents, additives, precursor evaporation temperature and film annealing temperature. (1) Zhang et al. found that the crystallization process and film morphology could be greatly affected by the DMF/DMSO solvent composition, because DMSO has a strong coordination with Pb2+, and forming a PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase is beneficial to promote the perovskite crystallization toward compact films with large grain sizes (Fig. 8a). With increasing DMSO ratio, the number of pinholes first decreases and then increases. Using an optimized 40% DMSO precursor, a large grain size of 400 nm and the longest lifetime of 14 ns were obtained, resulting in a high JSC of 14.2 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8b and c).92 (2) Lewis base adducts such as PbI2(DMSO) and PbBr2(DMSO) can slow the crystallization, resulting in the formation of large-grain films with low defect densities, long carrier lifetimes, and high stability, and a high PCE of 14.78% was reported by Yin et al.93 (3) The crystallization can be controlled via optimizing the precursor solution concentration and temperature to obtain thick films with a large grain size. For a fixed concentration, the precursor evaporation temperature should be adjusted to suppress the formation of too many nuclei and increase the crystallization rate at the same time (Fig. 8d). With the optimized substrate and solution temperatures of 100 °C, a large grain size of 740 nm and the highest PCE of 14.81% were obtained (Fig. 8e and f).71 (4) Nam et al. studied the effect of annealing temperature on film morphology. Upon annealing above 230 °C, gaps were filled to form large grains. The film annealed at 280 °C exhibited a pinhole-free surface with fully grown grains. Above 330 °C, the film started to degrade, and a severely damaged surface was observed.94 Besides one-step annealing, a two-step annealing method is also developed to prepare compact and uniform perovskite films. The transition film was first obtained at 42 °C with a color change from transparent to light brown, and the desired dark-brown CsPbI2Br film was obtained after being annealed at 160 °C. The PSC showed a higher JSC of 15.2 mA cm−2 and an improved PCE of 13.3%.95 Yan et al. also utilized a two-step annealing method to obtain a high PCE of 14.6% and thermal stability longer than 300 h.96 By extending the drying time at RT, Wang et al. obtained an amazing PCE of 14.21% for a CsPbI2Br PSC, indicating the universal applicability of the SCG method for all-inorganic PSCs.69

Other fabrication technologies have also been developed to engineer film growth and PSC performance. Different from routine hot plate annealing, a hot air flow (HAF) method in ambient air was developed by Zhang et al. to control the nucleation and crystallization, which provided a wide solution-processing window including a wide range of solvent components and solute concentrations, indicating the potential to achieve industrial fabrication. A large grain size of 700 nm was obtained, resulting in the highest VOC of 1.315 V and a low energy loss.97 Besides, an all-vacuum-depositing method was utilized to accurately control stoichiometric ratios of the precursors, resulting in a high JSC of 15.2 mA cm−2.98


3.2.2 Ion-doped films. 
Ion doping is also an efficient method to obtain large grain size, improve crystal stability and passivate surface defects. Cations including monovalent K+, divalent Sr2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+, and trivalent In3+ can be introduced into CsPbI2Br precursors to achieve a designed doping ratio. Nam et al. optimized the doping amount of K+, and a maximum PCE of 10.0% was obtained from Cs0.925K0.075PbI2Br films with a smoother morphology and larger grain sizes, implying that small amounts of metal ion additives could modify the crystallization process. Besides, the unencapsulated PSC maintained 80% of its initial value for 120 h, and this improved air-stability resulted from its higher structural stability (Fig. 9a).27 The average PCE of CsPb0.98Sr0.02I2Br was improved from 6.6% to 10.1%, which was partially attributed to the fact that enriched Sr at the film surface provided a passivation effect. A doped film PSC showed nearly no difference after heat treatment at 100 °C under ambient conditions for 1 h, while the CsPbI2Br PSC experienced a PCE drop, indicating the better thermal stability of the Sr doped device.88 Bai et al. utilized Mn2+ doping to increase grain size from 0.5 to 1.2 μm (Fig. 9b and c). When Mn2+ was inserted into the interstices of the CsPbI2Br lattice, the increase of lattice constant caused a slight structural change. Such a distorted structure and Mn2+-enriched environment slowed down the crystallization process, forming highly crystalline and uniform perovskite layers (Fig. 9d). PL quenching and lifetime shortening of the Mn-doped CsPbI2Br film indicated faster electron extraction, resulting from the defect passivation induced by excess Mn2+ aggregated at the film surfaces and grain boundaries (Fig. 9e). Therefore, an average PCE of 13.47% was obtained for 2% MnCl2 doping (Fig. 9f).99 Then, Liu et al. demonstrated that incorporating 0.25% InCl3 into the host perovskite lattice was beneficial to inhibit the formation of the yellow phase, resulting from the fact that the structural reconstruction significantly improved the overall spatial symmetry with a closely packed atom arrangement. Both air and thermal stability were improved exceeding 100 h, indicating the significant role of InCl3 doping (Fig. 9g–j).100 Due to less than 2% doping for K+, Sr2+, Mn2+ and In3+, a negligible bandgap change was observed, while the decrease of 0.03 eV was observed for 10% doping of Zn2+, contributing to a larger JSC. Similar to Mn2+ doping, Zn2+ doping also slowed down the crystallization process, and increased grain size to 4 μm and highly crystalline grains were obtained. Zn2+-enriched grain surface contributed to a decreased surface trap density of 1.69 × 1015 cm−3. Therefore, an improved PCE from 11.8% to 13.6% was obtained based on increased VOC and JSC.101

3.2.3 QD and heterojunction films. 
All-inorganic perovskite QDs have high light absorptivity, tunable bandgap, narrow PL emission line width, high PLQY, and good air stability. QD films with different thicknesses can be prepared by depositing a QD solution with a good dispersity in a nonpolar solvent with different concentrations and deposition numbers. In order to enhance QD film coupling, removing long-chain insulated ligands is necessary.102 Both solvent washing and film annealing are efficient methods to remove partial ligands or achieve ligand rearrangement due to their highly dynamic nature.4,103 Zeng et al. used both isopropanol washing and annealing in ambient air to remove ligands and increase grain size to 253 nm, resulting in a PCE of 12.02% and a VOC of up to 1.32 V with Eloss down to 0.5 eV.104 This is the highest PCE for CsPbI2Br QD PSCs until now, and more efforts on improving QD coupling and optimizing interface transport are needed.
One key challenge for CsPbI2Br PSCs is to maximize absorbance without sacrificing charge collection to attain high VOC and JSC based on their large bandgap. Although large active layer thickness is beneficial for increased sunlight absorbance, large recombination loss at the interface limits the extraction of photogenerated carriers. In order to overcome this problem, Liu's group developed a series of CsPbI2Br heterojunction active film PSCs based on band alignment engineering. First, they fabricated dimensionally graded bulk-nanosheet-QD (3D–2D–0D) heterojunctions, and all increased VOC from 1.11 to 1.19 V, JSC from 11.94 to 12.93 mA cm−2, and PCE from 10.38% to 12.39% were obtained. The improved JSC and VOC were attributed to the fact that the introduced electric field promoted carrier extraction and increased electron and hole quasi-Fermi-level splitting (Fig. 10a and b).105 Next, they designed CsPbI2Br/CsPbI3 QD heterojunctions to achieve a suitable band-edge bending for improving carrier collection, and a PCE of 14.41% was achieved, which is higher than those of the wide-bandgap subcell of 13.42% and the narrow-bandgap subcell of 10.75%. Holes generated in the CsPbI2Br film can be transported through the CsPbI3 QD layer and be collected at the anode, while electrons generated in the CsPbI3 QD film can move through the CsPbI2Br layer to the TiO2/FTO cathode. The bottom CsPbI2Br layer absorbs high-energy photon larger than 1.91 eV and the top CsPbI3 QD layer absorbs high-energy photon from 1.77–1.91 eV, and the visible light that has not been absorbed by the CsPbI2Br layer (Fig. 10c and d).106 Other CsPbI2Br/CsPbI3 QD examples also demonstrate the improved performances of heterojunction PSCs.71,99

3.3 CsPbBr3
CsPbBr3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic phase at RT, and transitions to a tetragonal phase and cubic phase at 88 °C and 130 °C, respectively. There is almost no relationship between phase and optoelectrical properties, so CsPbBr3 has stable properties at RT and a device operating temperature lower than 100 °C. Due to the low solubility of CsBr smaller than 0.3 M, it is impossible to prepare CsPbBr3 films with an ideal thickness using the one-step spin-coating method. The two-step method can produce a 400 nm-thick CsPbBr3 film. 1 M PbBr2 DMF solution is first spin-coated, and then the PbBr2 film reacts with 0.07 M CsBr methanol solution.
First, the PbBr2 film is immersed into CsBr methanol solution. In 2015, Kulbak et al. dipped a PbBr2 film into CsBr methanol solution at 50 °C, and studied the effect of different hole-transporting layers (HTLs) including 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMETAD) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA). When PTAA or no HTLs were used, high PCEs of 5.95% and 5.47% were obtained, which were attributed to a higher VOC based on a good energy band alignment.107 Then they improved the PCE to 6.2% using PTAA as the HTL.108 In 2016, Chang et al. first fabricated HTL-free CsPbBr3 PSCs using a carbon electrode and studied the effect of reaction time and temperature on performance. Using an optimal reaction condition of 50 °C for 40 min, a champion PCE of 5.0% was obtained.109 Next, all-inorganic PSCs using a FTO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon structure was obtained by Liang et al. (Fig. 11a), and a PCE of 6.7% was obtained based on a large VOC of 1.24 V and FF of 0.73. Amazingly, the PCE of all-inorganic PSCs exhibited no degradation even after storage in humid air (90–95% RH) at 25 °C for more than 2640 hours and at 100 °C for 840 hours without any sealing.110 In 2018, Tang's group promoted PCEs of CsPbBr3 PSCs over 9%. Because of a large concentration difference between CsBr and PbBr2 solutions, mixed phases are always formed, and the presence of a CsBr-rich Cs4PbBr6 phase can reduce the PCE greatly. They developed a multistep solution-processing method, and CsBr deposition was conducted 4 times (Fig. 11b), reaching a high PCE of 9.72% with a large VOC of 1.46 V.111 Then they used alkali metal cation doping to modulate the lattice. There was an optimal amount of alkali metal cation doping to obtain the highest VOC, JSC and FF at the same time, and the PCE increased upon doping alkali metal cations from Li to Rb. A maximum PCE as high as 9.86% was achieved for Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 PSCs, resulting from their largest grain size of 820 nm and smallest bandgap of 2.24 eV. Besides, PSCs retained nearly unchanged performance over 700 h storage in 80% RH (Fig. 11c).28 Next, they optimized both ETL and HTL using SnO2 QDs and CsMBr3 QDs with different bandgaps to achieve an ideal energy level alignment. A champion PCE of 10.60% with an ultrahigh VOC of up to 1.610 V was obtained (Fig. 11d).19

Solution-processing methods including spin-coating and spray-coating were also used to deposit CsPbBr3 QD films. Akkerman et al. found that both JSC and VOC increased with increasing deposition cycles in spin-coating, resulting from the enhanced sunlight absorption based on the increased film thickness. A 550 nm-thickness was obtained after nine depositions, reaching a PCE of 5.4% and a high VOC of 1.5 V.112 Hoffman et al. further added an annealing step after each spin-coating deposition to obtain a desired thickness (Fig. 11e). The annealing process led to the transformation from QDs into bulk with the removal of organic ligands. The improved conductivity of QD films led to an increased JSC of 7 mA cm−2 and PCE of 5.5%.113 In order to overcome the difficulties of a low material utilization ratio of 1% and a small coverage area for spin-coating, we developed a spray-coating technique to fabricate CsPbBr3 QD films, and a high material utilization ratio of 32% and a deposition rate of 9 nm s−1 were achieved. At an optimized substrate temperature of 90 °C and spray time of 90 s, a PCE of 2.64% was achieved for 600 nm-thick QD films.114
4. Perovskite photodetectors
According to the device structure and working mechanism, photodetectors can be divided into three types: photoconductors, photodiodes and phototransistors. The photoconductor type only conducts a single carrier type. One type of photogenerated carrier is trapped by the material surface or inner defects, whereas the others recirculate multiple times during the lifetime of the trapped ones, leading to a high gain and a long response time. By contrast, the photodiode type can extract both electrons and holes through a built-in potential, resulting in a high responsivity and a fast response speed.115,116 Vertical photoconductors and photodiodes have an electrode spacing smaller than 500 nm, providing a fast response and low driving voltage. They also have the advantages of low dark current, high detectivity and large linear dynamic range. By contrast, lateral photoconductors and phototransistors lead to a slow response and high driving voltage due to their electrode spacing of larger than 5 μm, but they are beneficial for high photocurrent and responsivity.117 For all-inorganic perovskite photodetectors, the lateral photoconductor type is often adopted because this metal–semiconductor–metal (M–S–M) structure is more simple and flexible. A photoconductor detector is also convenient to study the photophysics of perovskite nanocrystals. At the same time, perovskite nanocrystals can be processed at RT, making them suitable to develop flexible modules. The performances of all-inorganic perovskite photodetectors are summarized in Table 2.

4.1 CsPbBr3

4.1.1 The effect of morphology and size. 
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with different sizes and morphologies including QDs, NWs, and NSs have been synthesized by adjusting the ligand composition, reaction temperature and time based on solution methods including hot-injection and supersaturated crystallization.7,41,118 When these nanocrystals are assembled into a photodetector, the effect of morphology and size on performance should be evaluated. Pang et al. found the largest responsivity of 12.5 A W−1 and on/off ratio of 8616 from a CsPbBr3 nanoribbon (NB) film photodetector with a length of 200 nm compared with those of sphere QDs and nanocubes with sizes of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The largest responsivity of the NB film photodetector results from the increased carrier mobility and the reduced interface defects based on its large grain size.119 Considering the large grain sizes of NWs and NSs, they have been widely employed to fabricate perovskite film photodetectors. We have prepared 1.8 nm-thick CsPbBr3 NSs, and deposited them on Au interdigitated electrodes to obtain a photoconductor detector, which had a high detectivity of 7.3 × 1012 Jones and a short response time of 0.333 ms under a low bias voltage of 5 V. Such a superior performance was related to a high carrier mobility of 77.9 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 12a).4 Other works also demonstrate the superior photoresponse performances of 2D CsPbBr3 NS film photodetectors.120–122

Besides enhanced nanocrystal coupling by ligand rearrangement, increasing the nanocrystal size is another strategy to improve film carrier mobility because a decreased number of nanocrystal boundaries is beneficial to decrease carrier recombination. A recyclable dissolution–recrystallization (RDR) method can increase the sizes of nanocrystals from 10 nm to 1 μm through washing with polar solvents based on a solubility equilibrium principle. When the polar solvent is dropped on the perovskite film, surface atoms are dissolved. After the evaporation of the solvent, the dissolved species will be attached on nanocrystal surfaces and recrystallize, forming compact and uniform films. Li et al. obtained a significantly improved responsivity from 0.024 to 0.176 A W−1 based on a RDR treated CsPbBr3 film photodetector, resulting from the reduced loss of photogenerated carriers due to boundary scattering and recombination.123 Different from nanocrystalline films, a one-step spin-coated CsBr and PbBr2 DMSO precursor solution can produce polycrystalline bulk films with large grains of about 200 nm, and a high responsivity of 55 A W−1 was obtained.124 In addition, a solution growth method can give rise to CsPbBr3 microcrystals with a ultralarge grain of about 30 μm and a low trap-state density of 1012 cm−3, and a ultrahigh responsivity of 6 × 104 A W−1 was obtained under a low intensity of 200 nW cm−2, indicating a significant role of large grains in improving the photocurrent.125 Furthermore, a photodetector based on the (101) facet of CsPbBr3 single crystals had a responsivity of 0.028 A W−1, and this small value was attributed to a large electrode space of 0.1 mm.126 A higher responsivity of 2 A W−1 at 535 nm was obtained for a CsPbBr3 single crystal photodetector with a high carrier mobility of 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1, a large diffusion length of >10 μm and a low trap state density of 1.2 × 109 cm−3. Surprisingly, CsPbBr3 single crystals also exhibited an excellent two-photon absorption coefficient of 3.7 cm GW−1, leading to a photocurrent of 9.1 × 10−6 A under 800 nm illumination (Fig. 12b).3
Compared with nanocrystal film photodetectors, a single NS or NW photodetector has a lower dark current, enabling it to achieve a very high detectivity. At the same time, a single NS or NW device avoids carrier recombination and scattering existing at the grain boundary of bulk films, contributing to higher internal photoconductive gain and photoresponsivity. The single NS or NW device is also beneficial to study the effect of metal electrodes and perovskite contacts directly due to the absence of perovskite grain boundaries. Besides, only a low driving voltage is needed, making it a device with low power consumption. Single CsPbBr3 NSs can be put on a Au electrode pair, and a high responsivity of 34 A W−1 can be obtained, resulting from that the single NS photodetector has a higher gain (Fig. 12c).127 Single NS devices can be employed to evaluate surface defects of perovskites. The CsPbBr3 NS was found to have a persistent photoconductive (PPC) effect, similar to a traditional ZnO photodetector.128 More surface defects cause a long PPC effect, resulting in a slow temporal response.129 A single CsPbBr3 NW with a large length is also an ideal candidate for photodetection (Fig. 12d).130,131 Compared with Ohmic contacts, Schottky contacts can introduce an energetic barrier, playing a role in suppressing the dark current and accelerating the response speed. A very low dark current of ∼10 pA can be obtained from CsPbBr3/ITO, which is 1–3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the CsPbBr3/Al device.132


4.1.2 The effect of heterostructures. 
To achieve ultrasensitive photodetection, a promising strategy is to construct a perovskite/transport layer heterostructure, where light is effectively absorbed by the perovskite layer. One kind of photogenerated carrier is trapped at the surface, while the other carrier is transferred into a transport layer, so high gain can be achieved as these carriers recirculate many times within the lifetime of the opposite charges. First, semiconductor films including n-type (ZnO, TiO2, InGaZnO (IGZO), MoS2) and p-type (CuSCN, NiO, PCBM) are utilized as transport layers (Fig. 13a–d).119,133–138 A high responsivity ranging from 4 to 30 A W−1 was reported for these CsPbBr3/transport layer heterostructure photodetectors. The response and recovery time are usually shorter than 1 ms except for CuSCN and TiO2, resulting from the surface defect induced PPC effect. Besides, different from the traditional structure where photosensitive films are deposited on the electrodes, the electrode can also be inserted between the perovskite and transport layer, contributing to a longer photogenerated carrier lifetime.133 Second, metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene are also employed to construct the heterostructure with CsPbBr3, achieving an ultrahigh responsivity of 105 and 108 A W−1, respectively (Fig. 13e and f).139,140 Such high responsivities result from the high conductivity of CNTs and graphene. After electrons transport from the perovskite into conductive transport layers, a negligible carrier transport loss contributes to a high photoconductive gain. However, the negative effects are a large noise due to the large dark current and a small on–off ratio.

Furthermore, other strategies are also developed to improve photoresponse performance. With the assistance of Au plasmonics, a high on–off ratio of 106 was obtained because a 2.5 times enhancement of the localized electrical field was obtained for Au modified CsPbBr3 NCs under 532 nm illumination.141 Constructing a Mie-scattering porous CsPbBr3 film produced a 103 times increase in photocurrent because this structure effectively boosted light harvesting and carrier transport.142 The thickness of the CsPbBr3 film could be adjusted in a large range by freeze-drying casting, leading to an ultranarrow response photodetector with a FWHM of ∼12 nm and detectivity of over 1011 Jones at 545 nm.143 Dual-phase CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 perovskites provided a hybrid structure, and CsPb2Br5 with a bandgap of 2.9 eV could reduce the conduction of energy, effectively passivating the interface.144,145
A photodiode detector has the same structure as a solar cell. The difference is that the detector works under a negative or zero bias voltage while the solar cell works under a positive bias voltage. Based on a p-i-n structure of ITO/PTAA/CsPbIBr2/PCBM/BCP/Ag, the photodetector showed a detectable limit of about 21.5 pW cm−2, a fast response speed of 20 ns and negligible degradation after 2000 h under ambient conditions. The device is also integrated into an optical communication system to demonstrate its function as an optical signal receiver.146 An n-i-p photodetector of structure ITO/TiO2/CsPbBr3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au showed a high responsivity of 0.172 A W−1 in the self-powered mode, resulting from the large grain size and thickness of 10 μm.147 Under −0.7 V of bias voltage, a higher responsivity of 3 A W−1 could be obtained for a spray-coated CsPbBr3 NC photodiode, indicating that it is more suitable for working under negative bias.114 Other structures such as ZnO/CsPbBr3/GaN and CsPbBr3/Si junctions also show high responsivities and widen the response wavelength range.148,149

4.2 CsPbI3
CsPbI3 photodetectors have adopted similar engineering strategies including single NW devices, heterojunctions and photodiodes to improve photoresponse performance. Cubic α phase CsPbI3 NCs with the size of 10 nm were drop-cast on Au interdigitated electrodes, and the photodetector exhibited a high on/off ratio of 105, a responsivity of 1.7 A W−1, and a fast response of 24 ms, indicating that the CsPbI3 NC photoconductor exhibited a satisfactory photoresponse.150 A single α phase CsPb(Br/I)3 NW photodetector with an effective length of 3 μm showed a large photocurrent of 3 μA.151 Amazingly, single orthorhombic yellow phase CsPbI3 NWs exhibited an ultrahigh responsivity of 2920 A W−1 and an ultrafast response of 0.05 ms, indicating that the crystal structure did not affect the photoresponse at short wavelength.26 When these single NWs are assembled into a parallel NW array, a higher photoresponse is expected. The NW array can be prepared by either chemical vapor deposition growth on an Al2O3 template or controlling the dewetting dynamics of the precursor solution on an asymmetric-wettability template.152,153 Chen et al. fabricated stable α-CsPbI3 NW arrays with large grain size, high crystallinity, preferential (100) orientation, and regulated alignment by employing an asymmetric-wettability topographical template (Fig. 14a). Photoconductor detectors could be easily fabricated by depositing Au electrodes on NW arrays (Fig. 14b), which had a linearly increased photocurrent and a decreased responsivity with increasing illumination intensity from 0.001 to 1 mW cm−2 (Fig. 14c). It is worth noting that adding PVP can keep the black phase stable for 30 days, while the sample without PVP presents the yellow phase. NWs with 10 wt% PVP had the longest PL lifetime, which was attributed to their large grain size, high crystallinity and suppressed trap density (Fig. 14d).153 An organic semiconductor 2,7-dioctyl benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (C8BTBT) was used to construct a heterojunction with CsPbI3 NWs, and a ultrahigh responsivity of 4300 A W−1 was obtained.154 By combining CsPbI3 NCs with NaYF4 QDs, a broad-bandwidth photodetection from the deep UV to NIR region (260–1100 nm) was achieved.155 These two examples demonstrate the role of heterojunctions in accelerating carrier transport and widening the response range. Finally, ZnO/CsPbI3/P3HT and TiO2/CsPbI3/spiro-OMETAD photodiodes were prepared to make the photodetector work in the self-powered mode.156,157 A short chain ligand, 2-aminoethanethiol (AET), was compactly coated on the surfaces of CsPbI3 NCs, preventing penetration of water molecules, passivating surface traps and improving carrier mobility. Modified CsPbI3 NC films retained 95% of the initial PL intensity in water after 1 h, and devices retained 95% of the initial responsivity in ambient air for 40 h without any encapsulation.157

4.3 CsPbCl3
A CsPbCl3 photodetector can be employed in visible-blind UV detection due to its wide bandgap of 3.1 eV. Compared with other wide bandgap materials such as ZnO, TiO2, GaN, NiO, CsPbCl3 perovskite has a low surface defect density, and a low nonradiative recombination ratio is beneficial to obtain large responsivity and fast response for film photoconductor detectors. Zhang et al. fabricated transparent CsPbCl3 NC UV photodetectors, obtaining a good photoresponsivity of 1.89 A W−1, a high on/off ratio of 103, and a fast response of 41 ms.158 Well-connected CsPbCl3 microwire networks were prepared using vapor-phase epitaxial growth, and the photodetector exhibited a high on–off ratio of 103 and a fast response of 3.212 ms.159 Aiming at the instability issue of CsPbCl3 under ambient conditions, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was used to conduct a ligand exchange, resulting in passivating surface defects, accelerating charge transfer and improving stability. Furthermore, Gong et al. prepared a MPA–CsPbCl3 NC and graphene heterojunction photodetector, and a ultrahigh responsivity of 106 and ambient stability with less than 10% degradation of photoresponse after 2400 h were achieved (Fig. 14e–g).160
5. Perovskite high-energy ray detectors
X-ray detectors are currently based on either a direct-conversion method or an indirect-conversion method. In the direct method, X-ray energy is absorbed by the semiconductor such as amorphous selenium and converted into photo-generated charge carriers, which are collected on electrodes and extracted by an integrated circuit to achieve images. In the indirect method, X-ray energy is absorbed by a scintillator and converted into low energy visible light and this intermediate signal is subsequently converted into electrons.161
The operation of direct-conversion X-ray detectors is similar to that of visible-light photodetectors, but a much thicker active layer is needed to fully absorb X-ray due to its much stronger penetration capability. To collect all charges generated across the entire thickness, it is necessary to have a large charge carrier μτ. A methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) polycrystalline film was first used as a highly sensitive photoconductor based on a p-i-n solar cell structure, exhibiting a high sensitivity of up to 25 μC mGyair−1 cm−3 and the lowest detectable X-ray dose rate of 1 mGyair s−1.162 Then MAPbBr3 single crystals with a thickness of 3 mm had a high μτ of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1, achieving the lowest detectable X-ray dose rate of 0.5 μGyair s−1 with a sensitivity of 80 μC mGyair−1 cm−3.163 MAPbBr2.94Cl0.06 single crystals had an improved μτ of 1.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 and resistivity of 3.6 × 109 Ω cm, reaching a sensitivity of 8.4 × 104 μC mGyair−1 cm−3 and the lowest dose rate of 7.6 nGyair s−1.164 By integrating MAPbBr3 single crystals and Si, a high sensitivity of 2.1 × 104 μC mGyair−1 cm−3 could also be obtained.165 Although above breakthroughs are from organic–inorganic perovskites, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 is a strong candidate because of its high crystal, moisture and heat stabilities, and high mobility of 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μτ of 1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1.63 A γ-ray detector with an asymmetric electrode design of Ga/CsPbBr3 single crystal/Au was reported to achieve 3.9% energy resolution for 122 keV 57Co gamma-ray, and this high spectral resolution resulted from the low dark current under a large bias voltage and the long hole carrier lifetime of over 25 μs.166 CsPbBr3 QDs could also be inkjet-printed on a flexible substrate to fabricate detector arrays, achieving a high sensitivity of 1450 μC mGyair−1 cm−2 under an X-ray dose rate of 0.0172 mGyair s−1 and 0.1 V voltage.167
In a bulk scintillator material, incident X-ray photons can interact with heavy atoms to produce a large number of hot electrons through the photoelectric effect. These charge carriers are quickly thermalized to form low-energy excitons, which can subsequently be transported to defect centres or activators for radiative luminescence. Compared with a conventional polymer or bulk semiconductor scintillator with a wide emission peak, CsPbBr3 QDs have the advantages of high light production efficiency, narrow FWHM, short light pulses, high chemical, mechanical and antiradiation stabilities, and solution-processability at a relatively low temperature. Chen et al. prepared a CsPbBr3 QD scintillator with a thickness of 0.1 mm, and a high radioluminescence intensity of 106 under 278 μGy s−1 X-ray excitation was obtained, which was much higher than that of bulk single crystal CsPbBr3 or MAPbBr3 (Fig. 15a). The lowest detectable dose rate of 13 nGy s−1, a very fast response of 44.6 ns, and a long-term stability under continuous or repeated cycles of X-ray illumination were obtained (Fig. 15b). Besides, a multicolour X-ray scintillator was obtained by adjusting the QD composition (Fig. 15c), which could be employed to examine electronic circuit boards under low-dose X-ray illumination.168 Heo et al. prepared a CsPbBr3 QD/PMMA composite film scintillator, and an indirect detector was constructed by stacking the film scintillator and carbon fiber reinforced polymer film on an arrayed Si photodetector module (Fig. 15d).169 The CsPbBr3 scintillator detector had a higher spatial resolution of 9.8 lp mm−1, a faster response time of 200 ns, and comparable stability under a high intensity X-ray exposure of 40 Gy s−1 compared with the commercialized Te doped-Gd2O2S scintillator, resulting from a higher conversion efficiency of 49% (Fig. 15e).169

CsPbBr3 NSs are ideal candidates to obtain a high light yield and a fast response of a scintillator because their analogous exciton electronic structure to quantum wells leads to increased exciton binding energy, enhanced absorption cross section, and shortened PL lifetime. We have observed a monotonically decreased lifetime for a decreased PL wavelength for both NS solutions and films. The shortest lifetime of 7.5 ns was observed at 458 nm for a 1.8 nm-thick NS film. At the same time, a large exciton binding energy of 231.6 meV contributed to a strong PL emission.4 Zhang et al. used a streak camera system to collect the transient PL signal. A red shift of the PL peak from 460 to 510 nm indicated that the exciton recombination center shifted from a high energy level to a low one in 15 ns. NS films had a lifetime of 1.3 ns at 460 nm and 8.09 ns at 500 nm, suggesting a fluorescence resonance energy transfer from thin NSs (donor) to thick NSs (acceptor). A self-assembled CsPbBr3 NS film with a thickness of 25 μm exhibited an exceptional linearity to the dose rate from 1 to 140 nGy s−1, and its resposne time of 2 ns was 2 orders faster than that of 200 ns for a standard NaI:Tl scintillator.170
6. Challenges and outlook
All-inorganic CsPbI3 solar cells have achieved the highest PCE of 18.4% and 500 h stability under continuous illumination in a N2 glovebox. However, this best PCE only reaches 84% of the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit (21.7%), mainly limited by a low VOC (82% of the theoretical limit). CsPbI2Br solar cells have the highest PCE of 14.81%, which is also 78% of the theoretical limit (19%).9 Although higher thermal and light stabilities have been obtained for all-inorganic PSCs, most of the stability data are measured in a dry inert atmosphere because moisture-induced crystal instability is relatively disappointing, and they are far inferior compared to their organic–inorganic counterparts with a stability of 5000 h in air. In terms of performance, both QD films and polycrystalline bulk film solar cells are expected to improve their PCEs reaching 90% of the theoretical limit. On one hand, efficient interface engineering methods including 2D perovskite modification and functional molecules will achieve a better energy-level alignment and reduce the charge recombination, contributing to an increased VOC. On the other hand, increasing absorber thickness while maintaining a high carrier lifetime is beneficial to increase the current output. For more satisfactory device stability, material stability is expected to intrinsically improve based on B-site doping with ions of smaller sizes, low-temperature γ phase and suppressing surface defects. Isolating devices from the external environment through encapsulation is another feasible method to extend their lifetime. In terms of application, all-inorganic PSCs with wide bandgaps are integrated as the front cell in tandem solar cells. Both transparent anode and cathode need to be optimized to provide suitable work functions. Enhancement of light utilization but without sacrificing the transparency is expected by light trapping designs instead of increasing the active-layer thickness.
Compared with PSCs, CsPbBr3 visible light and high-energy ray detectors do not suffer from prominent stability problems. First, a faster response speed is pursued to meet high-speed dynamic monitoring. Photoconductors with a response time of milliseconds or even shorter can be achieved based on single crystal or single NW and NS devices with a high carrier mobility and a low defect density. Photodiodes with a response time of microseconds or even nanoseconds are obtained by decreasing the charge carrier transit time and resistance–capacitance time constant. A thin NS with a single-atom layer has a very short PL lifetime of less than 2 ns, so it is an ideal choice for ultrafast scintillator detectors. Second, detector arrays for multipixel imaging are closer to the requirement of commercial products than a single sensor unit detector. A compatible integrated circuit is required to fabricate detectors based on single crystals or large-area films. Therefore, all-inorganic perovskite photodetectors with a high-speed response and imaging function are promising candidates for visible light and high-energy ray detection.

 	Fig. 5  The methods to improve the performance and stability of CsPbI3 polycrystalline bulk film PSCs. (a) Mechanism of black phase stabilization by zwitterions. The size of the PbI2–DMSO colloids is decreased with the assistance of zwitterions due to their interaction with Cs+ and I−. During grain growth, zwitterion molecules are expelled toward the grain surface and boundaries which maintain the small grains by impeding further grain growth.68 Copyright 2017, Elsevier Inc. (b) Mechanism of PVP-induced black phase stability. PVP anchored at the surface of CsPbI3 grains via the combination between N/O and Cs. The negative state on crystal surfaces reduces the surface tension significantly and stabilizes the black phase.75 Copyright 2018, Nature Publishing Group.
