    , Accepted 23rd November 2022First published on 8th December 2022AbstractInspired by natural photosynthesis, bio-photoelectrochemical (BPEC) cells based on photo-enzyme coupled catalysis hold great promise for energy conversion and chemical valorization. Here, we report an integrated BPEC system comprising a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) modified meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin/titanium dioxide (TCPP/TiO2) dye-sensitized photoanode and a mesoporous carbon hollow spheres/carbon paper (MCHS/CP) cathode for light-driven glucose oxidation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, respectively. Such a proposed bifunctional BPEC cell delivers a maximum power output of 0.24 ± 0.03 mW cm−2 with an open circuit voltage of 0.76 ± 0.01 V and achieves efficient H2O2 accumulation (rate: 0.94 ± 0.02 mM cm−2 h−1). Overall, our proof-of-concept assembly leverages the ascendancy of biocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and electrosynthesis to provide an optimized design for biotic/abiotic coupling and expand the functional versatility of green energy devices.
Introduction
With a rational combination of bioelectrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, the development of bio-photoelectrochemical (BPEC) systems, a kind of ingenious electrochemical system which mimics natural photosynthesis artificially, shows great promise to convert both solar and biomass energy into electric power and valuable chemicals simultaneously.1,2 In recent years, many efforts on BPEC system construction have been intensively devoted to the special immobilization of photosensitive biocatalysts (e.g. photosystem I (PS I),3 photosystem II (PS II),4 and photosynthetic bacteria, such as Cyanobacterium5 and Ralstonia eutropha6) on substrates, and the reasonable assembly of biotic units (e.g. formate dehydrogenase (FDH),7 hydrogenase,8 and glucose oxidase (GOD)9) with abiotic optoelectronic substrates (e.g. bismuth vanadate (BiVO4),10 sensitized titanium dioxide (TiO2),11 and carbon nitride12). Although these studies have explored intriguing possibilities and achieved remarkable advances in multiple fields, such as solar-driven CO2 fixation and H2 evolution, there still exist many challenges to constructing satisfactory functional BPEC systems without external bias assistance.
Typically, bio-photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction pathways are hindered by complicated electron transfers of thermodynamically and kinetically intensive multiple-proton-coupled processes, poor enzyme activity and yield, and indispensable cofactor participation.2 Similar to CO2 reduction, bioelectrocatalytic N2 fixation struggles with the oxygen-sensitive nature of nitrogenase and chemical inertness of N2, specifically including the high activation barrier of triple bond cleavage, multiple electron transformations, and competitive side reactions.13 Besides, H2, one of the significant energy vectors, can also be produced via photo-enzyme approaches, such as the selective surface attachment of a [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase on perovskite14 or inverse opal TiO2 (IO-TiO2),4 facing the challenge of oxygen injury, restricted interfacial electron transfer of hydrogenase, and strict storage and transport conditions. Moreover, in recent years, realizing a broad range of chemical synthesis via photobiologic strategies has been attracting extensive attention, for example, asymmetric trans-hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds,15L-glutamate production,16 and oxyfunctionalization.10 However, most of these enzyme-based biocatalytic synthesis is limited by the dependence on expensive cofactors, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or its phosphorylated form NAD(P)H and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and the high cost of engineered biocatalysts. Apart from these specific problems, a large input of electrical energy is indispensable to the majority of previous systems, because of the low theoretical potentials (e.g. CO2/CO: −0.11 V vs. RHE; CO2/HCOOH: −0.20 V vs. RHE; N2/NH3: 0.09 V vs. RHE; H+/H2: 0 V vs. RHE). Thus, there is an urgent need to search for more efficient routes and available strategies to construct bias-free BPEC systems.17
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as a kind of significant eco-friendly oxidant, has been extensively used in applications for sewage treatment, pulp bleaching, sterilization, chemical oxidation, etc.18,19 Besides, with the growing global demand for energy, H2O2 is regarded as a promising liquid fuel for future alternative energy utilization.20 From the perspective of large-scale production, the only raw reactant, O2, is ubiquitous in natural environments and possesses moderate intrinsic properties.21 However, at present, almost 99% of H2O2 is manufactured by the energy-intensive and highly polluting anthraquinone oxidation method, which is an indirect synthetic process with multi-step chemical reactions through the hydrogenation of 2-ethyl anthraquinone by H2 and the subsequent oxidation with O2 in an organic solvent.22 Conversely, in the research field of water science, direct H2O2 synthesis based on an electrocatalytic two-electron (2e−) ORR has been regarded as a desirable route because of safer and greener reaction conditions with more efficient and facile working routes. Benefiting from these advantages, many studies on designing robust 2e− ORR catalysts, such as carbon-based materials,18,23 precious metals,24 metal alloys,25 metal–organic-framework (MOF) materials26 and single-atom catalysts,27,28 have been published. To economize on electrical energy, reduce transportation costs, and retard the self-decomposition of H2O2, further optimization of H2O2 production, such as storage conditions and synthesis device design, is urgently required. Based on the existing research, BPEC systems have showed great promise for green synthesis and in situ applications of H2O2.10,29 Noteworthily, with the pursuit of high activity and selectivity, most catalyst designs focus on an alkaline or acidic medium, which is incompatible with BPEC systems.30,31 Thus, it is challenging and meaningful to develop an integrated model to optimize the electric power output and simultaneously yield H2O2 under mild ambient conditions.
Herein, we develop an unassisted bifunctional BPEC cell that utilizes glucose, light, and oxygen to produce electric power and H2O2 simultaneously, pairing an enzyme-based photoanode and carbon-based cathode (Scheme 1). By integrating a biophotoanode, comprising glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) wired to meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin (TCPP)-sensitized TiO2 for visible-light-driven glucose oxidation, and a cathode, where mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (MCHS) are adopted as electrocatalysts for 2e− ORR, the two-chamber optically controlled BPEC cell is validly constructed. At the biophotoanode, TCPP with a photoactive delocalized macrocyclic structure and four carboxyl anchoring groups displays very strong visible-light absorption and high substrate affinity.32 Under light irradiation, the photogenerated carriers of TCPP can be efficiently separated by TiO2 and the hole accepter NADH. And this cofactor can be successively regenerated through the biocatalysis of GDH, thus providing a sufficient driven force for cathodic reduction.33 Through the external circuit, the photo-generated electrons are transferred to the cathode. Under the catalysis of MCHS, the oxygen molecules are reduced to H2O2. Consequently, our results demonstrate that such a BPEC cell possesses stable and reliable operating performance and delivers a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.74 ± 0.10 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 ± 0.01 V, and a maximum output power density (Pmax) of 0.24 ± 0.03 mW cm−2. Besides, while the MHCS electrocatalysts can reach higher than 80% selectivity in a wide range of potentials in a neutral electrolyte, this assembled BPEC cell can achieve a H2O2 production rate of 0.94 ± 0.02 mM cm−2 h−1 with >90% faradaic efficiency after 3 h continuous visible-light irradiation.

Results and discussion
Photo-enzyme coupled catalysis
At the biophotoanode, a TCPP-sensitized TiO2 photoanode with an average thickness of 35 μm was prepared according to previously modified strategies.34 As shown in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S1†), this prepared TiO2 film displayed a porous structure, which not only provided a high loading capacity for the subsequent integration of both dye molecules and enzymes but also promoted interfacial mass transfer. As is well known, the metastable anatase is widely recognized as the most active crystal phase for photoelectrochemical applications with a wide band gap of approximately 3.2 eV.35 Except for the diffraction peaks of the F-doped indium tin oxide (FTO) substrate, all of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks are well indexed to the typical anatase phase (PDF#71-1166) of TiO2 after annealing and dye adsorption (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the interaction between the TCPP sensitizer and TiO2 was also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements. In XPS survey scans, the peak intensity of both C 1s and N 1s is significantly enhanced, suggesting the effective adsorption of TCPP on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1b). Besides, in the high-resolution spectra of O 1s and Ti 2p, the peaks of Ti–O, Ti (2p1/2) and Ti (2p3/2) slightly shift to higher binding energies by 0.15, 0.16 and 0.14 eV, respectively, compared with pristine TiO2 (Fig. 1c and d).34,36 This result further confirms the anchoring of TCPP molecules on TiO2 by carboxyl groups. The FTIR spectra showed the weakened intensity of the carboxylic stretching mode ν(CO) at 1690 cm−1 and the C–O stretching mode ν(C–O) at 1248 cm−1, indicating the decrease of unbonded carboxyl groups (Fig. 1e). Meanwhile, two obvious bands at 1383 and 1639 cm−1 assigned to the symmetric νs(–COO−) and asymmetric νas(–COO−) stretching modes of carboxylate were monitored, and this phenomenon is ascribed to the effective bridging or bidentate chelate coordination between TiO2 and the TCPP sensitizer according to previous specialized studies.34,37,38 Furthermore, the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS) and UV-Vis absorption spectrum were applied to prove that the TCPP sensitizer was reliably integrated on the TiO2 film (Fig. 1f and S2†). The intense Soret absorbing band at 420 nm and low intensity Q-bands at 520, 556, 595, and 652 nm belong to the typical spectral features of porphyrin sensitizers, which are in good agreement with the absorption spectrum of the TCPP ethanol solution, revealing the great capability of visible light capture.32,37

(f) UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of TiO2 and TCPP/TiO2 (insets show the photographs of TiO2/FTO and TCPP/TiO2/FTO electrodes). 
The intrinsic collocation rationality of TCPP and TiO2 can be verified by the distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) of the sensitizer molecule and valence band/conductor band (VB/CB) of the oxide semiconductor (Fig. S3†).39 There are three steps occurring in the TCPP/TiO2 dye-sensitized electrode during the irradiation: (1) light absorption, (2) charge separation, and (3) charge collection. Different from the common semiconductor photoanode, steps (1) and (2) here are performed separately by different parts. First of all, photons pass through the active layer and thus are harvested by TCPP. Then, electrons in the dye molecules get excited and jump from the HOMO to the LUMO with TCPP reaching a charge-separated state. In the second step, the excited-state electrons quickly transfer to the CB of TiO2 linked by carboxyl groups (verified by XPS and FTIR) and finally arrive at the conducting glass substrate. And we need to mention that TiO2 can only function as a carrier separation layer with visible light irradiation based on the DRS results (Fig. 1f).40 The oxidized TCPP molecules return to the neutral stable state by collecting electrons from the reductive species in the electrolyte. On this basis, we paired a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide redox couple (NAD+/NADH), a biocatalytic coenzyme, as the electron mediator to realize photo-enzyme coupling catalysis.
NAD+/NADH is a natural hydride carrier in biological systems, serving as the key cofactor of numerous biocatalytic reactions, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle41 and glycolysis.42 In a typical dehydrogenase biocatalytic reaction, NAD+ can be reduced to NADH by combining the electrons and protons liberated from biomass oxidation.43 Thus, we added NADH into the anode compartment to investigate the photo-electrocatalytic properties of the dye-sensitized TCPP/TiO2 photoanode before being coupled with GDH. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the quasi-reversible redox peaks were obtained at −0.57 V vs. Ag/AgCl (anodic peak) and −0.73 V vs. Ag/AgCl (cathodic peak) respectively, demonstrating a robust ohmic contact between TCPP and TiO2. Only in the presence of both light illumination and NADH, a pronounced photo-electrocatalytic current could be observed when the bias voltage was higher than −0.58 V. Besides, the current densities were gradually increased from 0.05 to 2.47 mA cm−2 with the increased concentration of NADH (Fig. 2b), confirming the prominent photo-electrocatalytic performance of the TCPP/TiO2 photoanode towards NADH oxidation. For comparison, a pure TiO2 electrode was also studied using the same characterization methods (Fig. S4†). It is observed that the TiO2 electrode exhibits negligible current response with UV cut-off due to the wide band gap of 3.20 eV, highlighting that TCPP plays a key role in visible light harvesting and NADH oxidation.

Light illumination intensity: 100 mW cm−2 and λ > 420 nm. 
Subsequently, modifying GDH onto the TCPP/TiO2 electrode, a GDH/TCPP/TiO2 biophotoanode was developed. This photo-enzyme coupled catalytic system is initiated by the biocatalytic turnover of glucose oxidation. Under light illumination, one of the metabolites of biocatalysis, namely NADH, reacts with the excited-state TCPP to achieve electron transfer from GDH to the electrode substrate, resulting in enhanced anodic photocurrents. As shown in Fig. 2c, in the presence of both glucose and light illumination, this assembled GDH/TCPP/TiO2 biophotoanode obtained an onset potential of −0.75 V, and the photocurrent density reached 0.58 mA cm−2 (at 0 V) with an obvious anodic peak centered at −0.55 V. To optimize the synergistic effect between the photocatalyst and biocatalyst, LSV assays were adopted by increasing the glucose concentration and a saturated current density of 0.88 mA cm−2 was monitored at a rather positive bias potential (0 V) when the glucose concentration increased to 120 mM (Fig. 2d). Moreover, in agreement with previously reported TCPP-based catalysts, the dissolved oxygen has a negative impact on the performance of the biophotoanode (Fig. 2e), implying the necessity of designing a two-compartment photoelectrochemical reactor.44 Finally, the chronoamperometry test was adopted to evaluate the stability of the GDH/TCPP/TiO2 biophotoanode towards glucose oxidation (Fig. 2f). After 5 h, this biophotoanode exhibited superior photoelectrocatalytic stability retaining 84% of the initial photocurrent, which indicated that a robust biophotoanode was developed successfully.
Mesoporous carbon hollow spheres for H2O2 electrosynthesis
Benefiting from the low onset potential (−0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and stable electrocatalytic performance of the GDH/TCPP/TiO2 biophotoanode, a strong driving force can be provided for the cathodic reaction. Coupling an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a 2e− transfer pathway, a high-performance glucose/O2 bio-photo-fuel cell (BPFC) is constructed, where the simultaneous electric power and value-added chemical product H2O2 can be obtained.
Aiming at a high generation efficiency of H2O2 on the cathodic side, we prepared MCHS by SiO2-templated pyrolysis in a one-pot and surfactant-free synthesis (Fig. 3a).45,46 In the first step, two silica sources, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and tetrapropyl orthosilicate (TPOS), catalyzed by ammonia, undergo hydrolysis with different rates and condensation to generate crosslinked silica colloidal particles and cores. NH4+ is necessary for the formation of spherical SiO2 with a uniform size (∼300 nm, Fig. S5a–c†), where NH4+ cations surround the outer surface of the negatively charged colloidal particles to stabilize the template suspension and alleviate aggregation.47 Then, analogous to the siloxane sol–gel process, the hydrolysis polymerization reaction of resorcinol and formaldehyde catalyzed by OH− ions occurs. The dynamics of the organic sol–gel reaction of resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resins is relatively slower than the formation of silica templates in a mixture containing alcohol, H2O, and aqueous ammonia.48 Thus, in the second step, silica particles and RF oligomers are co-condensed surrounding the silica core to form SiO2@SiO2/RF core–shell structures. Subsequently, high-temperature carbonization is adopted to transform SiO2@SiO2/RF to SiO2@SiO2/C. After selective etching of SiO2 templates and filtration, MCHS is obtained.

(d) XPS surveys of MCHS and the SiO2@SiO2/C composite. Deconvoluted (e) C 1s spectrum and (f) O 1s spectrum of MCHS. (g) Raman spectrum of MCHS. 
During the synthesis process, the physical and chemical characterization of MCHS and SiO2@SiO2/C by different techniques may shed light on the origin of their catalytic performance. After the removal of SiO2 from the SiO2@SiO2/C composites, the monodisperse distribution and radial mesoporous channels on the shell could be directly distinguished by SEM (Fig. S5a, b, d, and e†). Meanwhile, as depicted in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. S5c and f†), no obvious structural collapse was observed, and the diameter and thickness of MCHS were consistent with those of SiO2@SiO2/C. High-angle annular dark field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirmed the uniform distribution of C and O elements onto the shell and the elimination of Si (Fig. S6†). Besides, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis demonstrated a narrow size distribution and good dispersibility of MCHS presenting a sharp peak at 342 nm in the hydrated particle size distribution with a low polydispersity index (PDI of 0.003), which was in agreement with the SEM results (Fig. S7†).
To scrutinize the real surface structure of MCHS, N2 adsorption isotherm analysis was adopted to measure its specific surface area and porosity. It is observed that the MCHS exhibits a type-IV adsorption isotherm with a sharp capillary condensation process at P/P0 = 0.60–0.70 confirming the typical mesoporous materials (Fig. 3b).49 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of MCHS is 2049.86 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of similar mesoporous materials.50,51 Based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model, a total pore volume of 4.72 cm3 g−1 and a narrow pore size distribution with a mean value of 5.63 nm can be calculated from the adsorption branch (Fig. 3c). Taken together, the hollow mesoporous morphology and high surface area of MCHS may contribute to the superior performance for the ORR via improving mass transfer kinetics and increasing catalytically active sites.18,52
The electronic structure evolution and surface functionalities of MCHS were further investigated by XPS and Raman spectroscopy. According to XPS survey scans, we can observe the disappearance of Si 2p and 2s peaks and the weakened intensity of the O 1s peak after etching SiO2 templates (Fig. 3d). The C 1s spectrum of MCHS can be deconvoluted into the following three peaks: carbon in graphite at 284.55 eV, carbon singly bound to oxygen (C–O) at 286.27 eV, and carbon bound to two oxygens (O–CO) at 288.79 eV (Fig. 3e). The deconvolution of the O 1s spectrum presents two peaks assigned to oxygen doubly bound to carbon (CO) at 532.04 eV and oxygen singly bound to carbon (C–O) at 533.47 eV (Fig. 3f).46 According to previous studies, diverse oxygen functional groups that arose from oxygen-doping are particularly efficient for the 2e− ORR, especially carboxyl53,54 and carbonyl groups.54,55 To verify material defects of MCHS, based on the Raman spectrum, the typical D and G bands were found at 1336 and 1586 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 3g). The ID/IG ratio calculated to be 0.98 shows a structure with abundant defects.56 To our knowledge, carbon-based nanomaterials or nanostructures benefiting from the nano-scale effect possess high-curvature surfaces and vacancies, which result in various defect sites including carbon lattice defects57 and graphite edges,18 contributing to outstanding catalytic performance.
The electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of MCHS towards the ORR were further determined in a 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 8.0) electrolyte using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique with a catalyst loading of 0.10 mg cm−2. The polarization curves were recorded in O2-saturated solution at different angular velocities, namely revolutions per minute (rpm), where the oxygen reduction currents were measured on a disk electrode (solid lines) and the H2O2 oxidation currents were measured on a platinum ring electrode (dashed lines). To quantify the amount of H2O2, the potential on the platinum ring electrode was fixed at 0.73 V vs. Ag/AgCl. As shown in Fig. 4a, the MCHS exhibited a large disk current density of 2.43 mA cm−2 (1600 rpm) at −0.30 V vs. Ag/AgCl. And an ORR onset potential of −0.10 V was observed, which was defined as the potential measured at a current density of −0.10 mA cm−2. By increasing the electrode rotating rate from 400 to 2025 rpm, the disk currents and ring currents were boosted correspondingly. Meanwhile, both disk and ring currents increased quickly ranging from −0.10 to −0.30 V indicating fast ORR kinetics in the neutral electrolyte. In addition to high electrochemical activity, as depicted in Fig. 4b, MCHS also exhibited an outstanding H2O2 selectivity ranging from −0.10 V to −0.41 V (>80%).

(c) LSV curves of the MCHS/CP cathode measured in N2-, air-, and O2-saturated 0.1 M PBS (pH 8.0). Scan rate: 5 mV s−1. (d) Chronoamperometry (i–t) curves of the MCHS/CP cathode at different bias voltages for H2O2 selectivity estimation. (e) H2O2 selectivity curve of MCHS determined after 60 min electrolysis at different bias potentials. (f) Long-term chronoamperometric test of the MCHS/CP cathode at a constant potential of −0.30 V (inset shows the configuration photograph of a commercial H-type cell for the cathode test). 
Structural characterization and RRDE measurement verify MCHS as a potential metal-free electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen to H2O2 in PBS (pH 8.0). To examine the ORR performance in a man-made cathode, the well-dispersed catalyst ink was added dropwise onto a P50 carbon fiber paper (CP) substrate fixed on ITO with a loading of 0.1 mg cm−2 to construct the MCHS/CP cathode. Fig. 4c displays the ORR behaviors of the MCHS/CP cathode in N2-, air-, and O2-saturated PBS (pH 8.0). The cathodic catalysis commenced from −0.07 V and the catalytic current reaches −3.22 mA cm−2 (at −0.5 V) under O2-saturated conditions and −0.86 mA cm−2 (at −0.5 V) under air-saturated conditions. Compared with the ideal polarization curve obtained in the RRDE test, the depletion effect could be observed at −0.23 V even under adequate agitation, which proved the full utilization of dissolved oxygen and fast catalytic kinetics at the cathode. Then bulk H2O2 electrosynthesis was performed in a commercial H-type cell (Fig. 4f insert) and quantified with a typical cerium sulfate (Ce(SO4)2) colorimetric titration method (Fig. S8†).53 Chronoamperometric tests were adopted to determine the accurate H2O2 selectivity (or denoted as faradaic efficiency) at different bias voltages in a practical scenario (Fig. 4d). Consistent with the RRDE test, the MCHS/CP cathode could also retain more than 80% H2O2 selectivity in a wide potential range and have ∼100% H2O2 selectivity at −0.20 V (Fig. 4e). Moreover, the prepared MCHS/CP cathode exhibited excellent catalytic stability, where a stable current of nearly −1.0 mA cm−2 (at −0.3 V) was generated over 5 h without any observed decrease (Fig. 4f).
Fabrication of bio-photoelectrochemical cells
For the fabrication of the BPEC cell, the GDH/TCPP/TiO2 biophotoanode and MCHS/CP cathode have been coupled in a two-chamber photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) designed by ourselves (Fig. 5a and S10†). The two chambers were made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) separated by a Nafion 115 membrane and filled with a 10 mL N2-saturated Tris–HCl electrolyte (anodic chamber) and O2-saturated PBS electrolyte (cathodic chamber), respectively. The two electrodes were arranged parallel to each other and deviated from the center of the chamber so as to shorten the electrode distance and increase the light transmittance rate. Moreover, the integral working mechanisms of this BPEC cell are summarized (Fig. 5b). Briefly, excited-state TCPP molecules and GDH synergistically propel the reversible recycling of the NAD+/NADH redox couple, and then the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the MCHS/CP cathode for O2-to-H2O2 electrosynthesis. To investigate the power output of BPEC cells, current–voltage curves were recorded under light illumination. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 ± 0.01 V (Fig. S11a†) and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.74 ± 0.10 mA cm−2 have been obtained. Maximum output power densities (Pmax) of 0.24 ± 0.03 mW cm−2 and 0.09 ± 0.02 mW cm−2 could be determined at 0.36 V with agitation applied in the cathodic and anodic chambers, respectively (Fig. 5c and S11b†). This can be ascribed to the restricted oxygen diffusion kinetics and in situ rapid NADH recycling, confirming that the cathodic process of dissolved oxygen transport is the rate-determining step in the whole cell reaction. Based on the results, the performances are superior to those of previously reported BPEC cells,9,12 although the cathodic reaction is the 2e− ORR, whose theoretical onset potential is much lower than that of the 4e− ORR. Then, the stability and photo-response of the BPEC cell were examined by chronoamperometry under intermittent or continuous light illumination. After more than 20 cycles, this BPEC cell showed a slight decline in power output and a quick and stable response to visible light (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, this BPEC cell exhibited acceptable discharge stability retaining 73% of the initial signal at 0.36 V after 3 h (Fig. 5e). Subsequently, to maximize the utilization of photocurrent, the determination of the H2O2 yield was performed under bias-free conditions, namely the short-circuit conditions of the BPEC cell. The cathodic electrolyte was extracted to perform colorimetric tests at intervals of half an hour. It was found that the H2O2 yield could reach 2.83 ± 0.05 mM cm−2 and the faradaic efficiency was observed to be >90% during 3 h operation (Fig. 5f). To the best of our knowledge, these results provided the first example for a BPEC system, in which both the high power output and H2O2 production are accomplished by integrating a biophotoanode and a 2e−-ORR cathode with renewable green resources input. However, since natural enzymes and dye-sensitized electrodes have intrinsic fragility, there exists great potential for further improvement in the stability of the biotic/abiotic interface, for instance optimizing the local environment of enzyme bioelectrochemistry,58 introducing a hydrogel protective layer,59 co-depositing conductive polymers,60etc.

Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a bifunctional glucose/O2 bio-photoelectrochemical cell serving as a “trading” platform for simultaneous energy conversion and H2O2 electrosynthesis. The biophotoanode has been designed based on an abiotic/biotic hybrid strategy. Specifically, a TCPP/TiO2 dye-sensitized photoanode was coupled with glucose dehydrogenase, allowing for light-driven cofactor recycling and glucose oxidation. On the cathodic side, MCHS was selected as a 2e−-ORR catalyst owing to high catalytic activity and selectivity towards H2O2 in a neutral electrolyte. After rational assembly, this BPEC cell exhibited a Pmax of 0.24 ± 0.03 mW cm−2 at 0.36 V and a Voc of 0.76 ± 0.01 V under visible light illumination and achieved a H2O2 production yield of 2.83 ± 0.05 mM cm−2 (rate: 0.94 ± 0.02 mM cm−2 h−1) during 3 h operation without the assistance of an externally applied bias. It is anticipated that our work will boost the development of BPEC systems for future clean energy demands and high-efficiency chemical valorization and also open up possibilities for the in situ utilization of H2O2 for a wide variety of purposes.
