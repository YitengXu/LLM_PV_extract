By using ruthenium complexes through novel molecular design, Sharp and our group have reported DSCs with high photoenergy-conversion efficiencies (η) of over 11% for AM1.5-simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2, 1 sun).2 However, ruthenium complex dyes are not suitable for cost-effective environmentally-friendly photovoltaic systems, because ruthenium is a rare and expensive metal, which limits the potentially wide application of these complexes. Therefore, the investigation of DSCs using metal-free organic dyes is very important for practical applications. Recently, numerous organic dyes for high-efficiency DSCs have been reported; new organic dyes with efficiencies over 5% are hemicyanine dye (η = 5.1%),3a polyene–diphenylaniline dye (η = 5.1%),3b thienylfluorene dye, (η = 5.23%),3c phenothiazine dye (η = 5.5%),3d thienothiophene-thiophene-derived dye (η = 6.23%),3e phenyl-conjugated polyene dye (η = 6.6%,3f 6.8%3g), N,N-dimethylaniline–cyanoacetic acid (η = 6.8%),3h porphyrin dye (η = 7.1%),3i oligothiophene dye (η = 7.7%),3j coumarin dye (η = 8.2%),3k indoline dye (D149, see Scheme 1: η = 9.03%)3l and oligo-phenylenevinylene-unit dye (η = 9.1%).3m Scheme 1  The structures of indoline dyes (D149 and D205). In order to improve the η values, it is necessary to remodel the molecular design of organic dye photosensitizers. One of the new design concepts is to control aggregation between dye molecules. To obtain a dye with efficient photocurrent generation, π-stacked aggregation (D and/or H aggregation4) on the nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes should normally be avoided. Aggregation may lead to intermolecular quenching or molecules residing in the system that are not functionally attached to the TiO2 surface and thus act as filters.5 Some ruthenium complexes (black dye2a and N7192b) have shown the best results using chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which functions as an anti-aggregation reagent to improve the photovoltaic effect.6 On the contrary, indoline dyes and coumarin dyes form photoactive aggregates on nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes for DSCs, known as J-aggregation.7,8 Therefore, controlling dye-aggregation is an important issue for high-efficiency DSCs.In order to control the aggregation between dye molecules, a new indoline dye was designed by introducing an n-octyl substitute onto the rhodanine ring of D149 for use in DSC: D205 (Scheme 1). D205 gave 7.2% conversion efficiency using an ionic-liquid electrolyte.9 In this report, we disclose the synthesis method of D205 and show high-efficiency DCSs using volatile electrolytes. In particular, with the use of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the DSCs with D205 on nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes exhibited a high open-circuit photovoltage at 710 mV. The best resulting photopower-conversion efficiency was 9.52% under 1 sun irradiation. This is the best photopower-conversion efficiency published for an organic dye-sensitized solar cell to date.Fig. 1 shows the synthesis route for D205. Indoline dye (D205, 3) was produced by heating a mixture of 4-[4-(2,2-diphenyl-vinyl)-phenyl]-1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydro-cyclopenta[b]indole-7-carbaldehyde (1) (0.53 g, 1.2 mmol), octyl-5-(4-oxo-thiazolidin-2-ylidene)-rhodanine-3-acetic acid (2) (0.53 g, 1.3 mmol),10 ammonium acetate (0.01 g) and acetic acid (10 mL) at 120 °C for 5 h. After cooling the red–brown precipitate was filtered and washed twice with MeOH and then dried, yielding 0.89 g of crude dye. The crude dye was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, using CHCl3 and MeOH (20 : 1) as the eluent, and 0.80 g (78%) of pure dye was obtained as a brown powder. The analytical data are given in the footnote.† Fig. 1  Synthesis route of D205. For DSC fabrication, the procedure for dye-sensitized nanocrystalline-TiO2 and Pt electrodes was described in detail in a previous report.11 The cell conditions of this report are described below. The thicknesses of the transparent nanocrystalline-TiO2 layer and the scattering layer were 14 and 5 μm, respectively. For the dye uptake, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed into the D1493l or D205 solutions [0.5 mM in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (v/v, 1 : 1)], and kept at room temperature for 4 h. For the coadsorption, chenodeoxycholic acid was added (1.0 mM). The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a hot-melt ionomer film (Surlyn 1702, 25 μm thick, DuPont). A drop of the electrolyte solution was placed on a drilled hole in the counter electrode of the assembled cell, and was driven into the cell by means of vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using an additional hot-melt film (Bynel 4164, 35 μm thick, DuPont) and a cover glass (0.1 mm thick). The electrolyte was composed of 0.10 M lithium iodide, 0.60 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, and 0.05 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile : valeronitrile (v/v, 85 : 15).3l A self-adhesive, antireflection, UV cut-off film (λ<380 nm, Arctop, Asahi Glass, Japan) was attached to the DSC surface after the cell was assembled. In order to reduce the scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer, light-shading masks were attached onto the DSCs.12 The power of the AM1.5 solar simulator was calibrated using a reference Si photodiode equipped with an IR cut-off filter (KG-3, Schott) in order to reduce the mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm between the simulated light and the AM1.5 to less than 2%.13Fig. 2 shows absorption spectra in DMF and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of D149 and D205. The IPCEs under 380 nm are deteriorated, because sheets of anti-reflecting UV cut-off film (Arctop, Asahi Glass, Japan) attached to DSCs reduced the values in the short-wavelength region (<380 nm). It should be noted that although the absorption spectra of D149 and D205 were identical, the IPCEs of D149 and D205 are different. We are currently studying dye-aggregation phenomena with CDCA on TiO2 electrodes, which will be presented in a forthcoming paper. Fig. 2  Absorption spectra in DMF (a) and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) (b) of indoline dyes (D149 and D205). The IPCEs were measured with/without chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). A sheet of Arctop (an anti-reflecting UV cut-off film, Asahi Glass, Japan) was attached to each DSC surface for IPCE. Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells using D149 and D205. Table 1 summarizes the results where Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density under irradiation, Voc is the open-circuit voltage and FF represents the fill factor. Comparisons between D149 and D205 show that n-octyl substitution increased the VOC regardless of the presence of CDCA. The presence of CDCA increased the VOC of D205 by approximately 0.054 V, but had little effect on D149 (improvement of only 0.006 V). It is significant that the combination of CDCA and the n-octyl chain (D205) improves the VOC up to 0.710 V, which is 0.066 V higher (10.2%) than that of D149 with CDCA. Kroeze et al.14 showed that alkyl substitution of dyes improved the VOC, due to the blocking effect of the charge recombination between I3− and electrons injected in the nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes. Therefore, the VOC variation observed in Fig. 3 indicates that the charge recombination was impeded by the blocking effect, due to the combination of the n-octyl chain and CDCA.

However, with CDCA, the effect of the n-octyl chain was apparent and the substitution of the n-octyl chain (from D149 to D205) with CDCA decreased the JSC by 5.9%. The effect of n-octyl substitution and CDCA on the FF was similarly small. Without CDCA, the n-octyl substitution decreased the FF by 0.6%. With CDCA, the n-octyl substitution increased the FF by 1.9%.Without CDCA, the improvement in η from D149 to D205 was only by 2.1%. With CDCA, the improvement in η from D149 to D205 by 6.2% was significant. The resulting average η value of D205 with CDCA was an outstanding 9.40% (Table 1). The highest η value of 9.52% was achieved with a DSC based on D205 (JSC: 18.56 mA cm−2, VOC: 0.717 V, and FF: 0.716). Reproducible efficiencies from 9.3% to 9.5% were obtained with the solar cell based on D205.In summary, a new indoline dye exhibiting an η value of 9.52% has been demonstrated, which is the highest efficiency obtained so far among DSCs based on organic dye photosensitizers under AM 1.5 radiation (100 mW cm−2). This efficiency rivals the highest value (11.18%) obtained with a DSC based on the Ru dye N719 under the same measurement conditions.2b It was confirmed that the control of dye-aggregation by the combination between CDCA and substitution of the n-octyl chain on the rhodanine ring was the key factor in obtaining a high-efficiency organic dye-sensitized solar cell. These results strongly indicate that the application of organic dye photosensitizers in DSCs is promising with regard to high solar cell performance, low-cost production and recyclability. However, the detailed mechanisms of dye-aggregation for DSC photovoltaics are still undetermined. In order to supersede the results of ruthenium complexes (11%),2 advanced studies to understand molecular aggregation with an electron-dynamics study (e.g. photovoltage decay) will be presented in a forthcoming paper.This work was supported by a grant from the Swiss Federal Energy Office (OFEN) and Nissan Science Foundation.
