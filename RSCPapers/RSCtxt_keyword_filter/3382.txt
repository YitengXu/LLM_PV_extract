    , Accepted 20th July 2017First published on 20th July 2017AbstractUtilizing the N-annulated PDI acceptor PDI–DPP–PDI, a simple air-processed and air-tested organic photovoltaic device fabrication procedure has been established to streamline the screening of donor materials. Post-deposition solvent vapour annealing of the active layer blend results in a preferential re-organization dictated by PDI–DPP–PDI and is responsible for significant increases in device performance. Employing this method, a series of low-cost and scalable donor polymers were screened to help select promising candidates as alternatives to the expensive high-performance donor polymer PTB7-Th. Universal improvements in performance upon solvent vapour annealing with a range of donor polymers highlighted the advantages of PDI–DPP–PDI and this post-deposition treatment. This facile screening protocol identified PDTT-BOBT as the most suitable PTB7-Th alternative in the surveyed series, with the best device efficiencies reaching 4.5% PCE compared to control devices with PTB7-Th at 4.6% PCE.
Introduction
Solution-processable organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a technology with the potential to offer an inexpensive route to solar energy conversion.1–8 Record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are being set each year,9–11 yet the organic solar cell technology remains largely an academic interest. To extend current lab-scale methodologies to eventual larger scale commercialization there are several deficiencies that need to be addressed.12–14
Currently, one of the most obvious issues is transitioning away from high-performance materials with complicated and/or multi-step syntheses,15–17 this renders them expensive to scale and limits their use to an academic setting. Recently, we have identified a low-cost and scalable N-annulated perylene diimide (PDI) building block that can be incorporated into a range of final materials with efficiencies between 2–8% PCE18–23 when employed as non-fullerene acceptors.24–29 While these materials proved to be simple to access and scale, their impressive efficiencies relied on the use of donor materials which cost thousands of dollars per gram.‡ Having recognized this deficiency, we have directed our focus to identifying simple and scalable donor materials that could better complement our acceptor materials.
To streamline the screening of new donor materials we have selected our N-annulated PDI derivative PDI–DPP–PDI.19,20 This material offers a diagnostic morphological handle that is induced by solvent vapour annealing (SVA) and can be monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. In our previous work, when paired with the expensive high-performance donor polymer PTB7-Th, the best air-processed and tested devices increased from 2.2 to 5.6% PCE using this method.19 In this work, we have extended this methodology to simple and scalable donor polymers P3HT,30–32PCDTBT,33–38 and PDTT-BOBT39 to identify a suitable alternative to PTB7-Th.
Material selection
Having identified PDI–DPP–PDI as a promising non-fullerene acceptor that can be accessed from readily available building blocks and a simple and efficient direct heteroarylation (DHA) synthetic method optimized in our research group40–45 we sought donor materials with similar accessibility advantages.

P3HT

The quintessential low-cost donor polymer,30–32 this simple wide-band gap polythiophene material can be synthesized with high regioregularity46 employing direct heteroarylation polymerization (DHAP).47–49P3HT has an overlapping absorption profile with PDI–DPP–PDI and the lowest ionization potential of the series (Fig. 1, red). This suggests, on paper, that it is not one of the ideal polymers to pair with PDI–DPP–PDI; however, the synthetic and cost advantages of using P3HT cannot be overlooked and thus this polymer certainly warrants investigation.

PCDTBT

This carbazole-based co-polymer is synthesized by Suzuki polymerization and represents one of the most efficient low-cost materials for BHJ organic solar cells.33–38 With a high ionization potential (Fig. 1, green), using this donor polymer with appropriate acceptor materials often leads to devices with a characteristic high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of greater than 0.9 V. PCDTBT is an intermediate band-gap material in this series, more red-shifted than P3HT but negligible absorption past 700 nm. To complement PDI–DPP–PDI, PCDTBT contributes additional light absorption from 550–650 nm and a significant high-energy absorption band centered around 400 nm.

PDTT-BOBT

Consisting of simple and cost-effective alkoxy-substituted benzothiadiazole units and dithienothiophene, PDTT-BOBT represents a medium band-gap polymer with the lowest energy absorption of the series (Fig. 1, blue). When paired with PDI–DPP–PDI, this polymer offers additional absorption from 600–750 nm as well as some further high-energy contribution centered around 400 nm. While amenable to gram-scale synthesis and isolable in yields greater than 80%,39 synthetically, the drawback of this donor polymer is the reliance on a Stille condensation polymerization reaction. Although this is the method currently employed, the same substrates should be amenable to a DHAP protocol as a more efficient and sustainable access to this polymer in the future.
Active layer processing and device screening
Recognizing the diagnostic morphological handle inherent to PDI–DPP–PDI, the effect of post-deposition chloroform vapour annealing was assessed on 40:60 blends of the respective donor polymers with PDI–DPP–PDI in 1.0 wt/v% solutions in chloroform. Optimal SVA times were chosen based on two-minute intervals where absorption spectra were collected until no further changes in profiles were observed. Full details on the post-deposition processing procedure can be found in the ESI.†
In screening the post-deposition processing of these three active-layer blends it became evident that the observed peak at 586 nm, which appears upon chloroform vapour annealing (Fig. 2), is dictated by PDI–DPP–PDI and is independent of the donor polymer pairing. This same peak at 586 nm was observed to emerged upon chloroform vapour annealing with the donor polymer PTB7-Th in our previous work.19 The presence of this peak was correlated with the preferential organization of PDI–DPP–PDI which led to a more favourable active layer morphology and more than doubled device efficiencies. Considering this, we were optimistic for a similar photovoltaic response when screening as-cast and solvent vapour annealed devices with these alternative polymers.

The selected donor polymers were screened in air-processed and air-tested organic solar cell devices utilizing the following device architecture: ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The active layers were cast at 1500 rpm from 1.0 wt/v% solutions in chloroform made up of a 40:60 donor:acceptor ratio, the same conditions as optimized in our previous work with PTB7-Th as the donor polymer.19,20 Device performance was compared between the as-cast and chloroform solvent vapour annealing post-deposition technique. Full details on the device fabrication procedure can be found in the ESI.† Photovoltaic performance and external quantum efficiencies (EQE) are summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 1.

In all cases, post-deposition chloroform vapour annealing treatment of the as-cast thin-film led to substantial improvements in performance (Table 1, Fig. 3, top). Utilizing P3HT as the donor polymer saw efficiencies rise from 0.1 to 0.7% PCE with a near 3-fold increase in short-circuit current (JSC). Improvements in the as-cast devices of PCDTBT were also accompanied by 3-fold increase in JSC which led to efficiency improvements from 0.4 to 1.5% PCE. When paired with PDTT-BOBT, the largest gain in JSC was observed with a 4-fold increase from ∼5 to 9 mA cm−2. This correlated with efficiency increases from 1.7 to 3.9% (Table 1).
The increases in performance upon solvent vapour annealing are highlighted by an increase in photocurrent generation specifically where PDI–DPP–PDI absorbs (500–600 nm, Fig. 3, bottom) and a growth in the fill factor (FF). Open-circuit voltages (VOC) for medium band-gap polymers PCDTBT and PDTT-BOBT were approximately 1.0 V for both as-cast and chloroform vapour annealed devices, an increase of more than 0.1 V compared to devices utilizing PC71BM as the acceptor material.34,39 These high VOC achieved with PDI–DPP–PDI represent an Eloss of 0.8 and 0.7 eV respectively, calculated from the onset of photocurrent generation, and are close to the energy losses record with PTB7-Th:PDI–DPP–PDI (∼0.6 eV).20P3HT was also able to achieve a high VOC (0.8 V); however, a significant drop in potential was observed upon solvent vapour annealing, down to approximately 0.7 V which can be correlated with shorter recombination lifetimes.50
This simple post-deposition treatment and the universal improvement in device performance highlights the diagnostic morphological handle of PDI–DPP–PDI as a tool for streamlined screening of donor materials. With this protocol, we can use UV-vis spectroscopy as a mechanism for quality control where the emergence of the absorption band at 586 nm is directly correlated to a favourable morphology for improved device efficiencies. Paring this post-deposition treatment with simple air-processed and air-tested devices makes for a truly simplified and efficient screening method for donor materials.
Ultimately, this streamlined screening of donor materials goes hand-in-hand with the importance of materials selection when investigating the device performance of new materials. Our research group,18 and others,51–54 have previously shown how crucial appropriate donor:acceptor pairings are to improving photovoltaic efficiencies, and we now have a reliable method to identify the most promising materials to investigate with PDI–DPP–PDI and related materials. While the investigation of other processing and fabrication methods that are often used unique to each donor polymer (i.e. thermal annealing, device architecture, solvents, additives) may lead to increases in performance compared to our screening conditions, PDTT-BOBT was determined to be the most promising donor material under our optimized conditions for pairing with PDI–DPP–PDI as a low-cost and scalable alternative to PTB7-Th. Therefore the optimization of the PDTT-BOBT:DPP-PDI-DPP blend will be the focus for the remainder of this work.
Device optimization
Having identified PDTT-BOBT as the most promising donor material to investigate, optimization of the active layer blend was first focused on determining the best solution concentrations and donor:acceptor ratios. Device performance confirmed that a 10 mg mL−1 solution concentration and a 40:60 donor:acceptor ratio, as used in device screening, were in fact the best combination (see ESI, Fig. S14–S19 and Tables S4–S6†). This optimized processing methods leads to an active layer thickness ca. 80 nm, as measured by AFM (see ESI, Fig. S33†).
Considering the importance of chloroform vapour annealing to improvements in device performance, an optimization of SVA time was also warranted. As-cast devices were exposed to chloroform vapour annealing at two-minute intervals from 0–12 minutes and the device performance, quantum efficiencies, and active layer morphologies were compared.
At four minutes of chloroform vapour exposure the PDTT-BOBT:PDI–DPP–PDI blend reaches its maximum potential with efficiencies surpassing 4.0% PCE, and an external quantum efficiency profile that matches the absorption spectrum, implying both the donor and the acceptor component are contributing to photocurrent generation (Fig. 4 and Table 2). AFM images reveal that solvent vapour annealing is accompanied by an increase in roughness to the as-cast devices with the formation of slightly larger domains (Fig. 5). Exposure of the as-cast devices to chloroform vapour at times longer than four minutes began to degrade the device performance. Photocurrent generation decreases as the domain sizes increase with PCEs dropping to 3.1 and 2.4% after 8 and 12 minutes respectively.

Evidently over-exposure to chloroform vapour is detrimental to device performance but an optimal window between 3–5 minutes is sufficient for reaching peak performance. This selection of SVA time is similar to the window observed with PTB7-Th:PDI–DPP–PDI,19 highlighting the analogous behaviour of PDTT-BOBT which supports its promise as a low-cost alternative to PTB7-Th.
The solution-processing of the PDTT-BOBT:PDI–DPP–PDI active layer blend proved to be remarkably reliable over the course of the device fabrication optimization. From the range of devices fabricated from different material batches, ink solutions, and evaporations, device efficiencies post-SVA were consistently between 3.8 and 4.5% PCE with an overall average device efficiency from all trials of 3.95% PCE across 24 different devices on 12 different substrates. Devices with variable sizes also demonstrated consistent performance. Using device sizes from 3.0 to 36.0 mm2 were found to have a minimal influence on photovoltaic performance (Fig. S23 and Table S8†). The smaller devices (3.0–9.0 mm2, 3.5–4.2% PCE) performed slightly better compared to the larger devices (10.0–36.0 mm2, 3.2–3.5% PCE). The fact that device efficiencies remain relatively consistent with increasing device size suggests that this active layer blend may be a promising candidate to be scaled for large area devices in the future.
As a final evaluation, PDTT-BOBT:PDI–DPP–PDI devices were compared with PDTT-BOBT:PC61BM and PTB7-Th:PDI–DPP–PDI devices under the same optimized processing conditions (Fig. 6 and Table 3 and ESI Fig. S24–S27 and Tables S9–S11†). As-cast PC61BM control devices with PDTT-BOBT reached a best PCE of 3.1%, and were surpassed by PDI–DPP–PDI upon post-deposition SVA treatment with a best device PCE of 4.5%. PDI–DPP–PDI devices benefitted from a higher VOC than that of PC61BM devices, but also saw improvements in all other device parameters. This best device efficiency for PDTT-BOBT:PDI–DPP–PDI, 4.5% PCE upon SVA treatment, is comparable to the 4.6% PCE obtained when PTB7-Th was used as the donor polymer. These results support the potential for PDTT-BOBT to act as a low-cost and scalable alternative to PTB7-Th. In comparison, the clear advantage for PTB7-Th (λonset = 780 nm) is the increased photocurrent generation compared to PDTT-BOBT (λonset = 720 nm) a result of a red-shifted λonset. Therefore, red-shifting the absorption of PDTT-BOBT, without decreasing the ionization potential, is an obvious area to address in future polymer designs.

Device stability
The stability of the optimized BHJ active layer blend was assessed by thermal, air and light stability measurements. Complete results for these experiments can be found in the ESI.†
Heating the devices at 80 °C in air over a period of 20 minutes was accompanied by a burn-in period where efficiencies dropped over 0.7% (Fig. S28 and Table S12†). After the initial 20 minutes (and up to 60 minutes) the degradation plateaued with only small decreases in performance. The relative thermal stability of the active layer is beneficial given the exposure to heat that is commonly observed for various encapsulation methods that could be employed upon scale-up to large area printed devices.
As shown previously, the initial device performance of PDTT-BOBT was comparable to that of PTB7-Th; however, given the impressive air and light stability of the PTB7-Th:PDI–DPP–PDI blend,19 it is also important for PDTT-BOBT:PDI–DPP–PDI to reach similar achievements. Exposing the devices to air over a period of 14 days had little effect on device performance; however, the light stability of the active layer did present some glaring issues with the donor polymer PDTT-BOBT (Fig. S29 and Table S13†). When left in air under ambient light, significant degradation in all device parameters were observed and PCEs dropped from 4.3 to 2.4% and could not be avoided even with the use of a UV-light blocking film (Fig. S30†). This degradation was accelerated under sunlight where PCEs decreased from 3.9 to 0.5%. UV-vis spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the losses in performance can be attributed to the degradation of PDTT-BOBT which evidently has poor photochemical stability in air (Fig. 7) as verified by the loss of the low-energy absorption band contributed by PDTT-BOBT. Similar stability outcomes were observed for PDTT-BOBT:PC61BM control devices, and the results support the degradation of PDTT-BOBT in light (Fig. S31 and 32 and Table S14†).
 Fig. 7  Thin-film absorption profiles and images of devices exposed to light. Results show PDTT-BOBT degrades in light but PDI–DPP–PDI remains unaffected after 14 days of exposure to light in air. 
The poor photochemical stability of PDTT-BOBT has been attributed to the use of alkoxy side chains on the benzothiadiazole unit. They are known for their negative impact on polymer stability as a result of the readily cleavable C–O bond under irradiation,55 where the instability of this functionality likely precipitates the degradation of the pi-conjugated backbone. This is important to note considering the attention alkoxybenzothiadiazole building blocks are receiving, having been incorporated into polymeric donors materials that approach 10% PCE in single-junction solar cells with PC71BM.56 We therefore suggest to ere on the side of caution when utilizing this building block in new polymer designs and supplement device results with light stability measurements to assess the integrity of the active layer blend. Further studies on the light stability of such building blocks and materials is warranted.
Conclusions
Taking advantage of the diagnostic morphological handle inherent to PDI–DPP–PDI we have devised a streamlined method to screen for compatible donor materials. Using this efficient and reliable method we have screened a series of low-cost donor polymers and identified PDTT-BOBT as a simple and promising competitor for PTB7-Th.
Optimizing the active layer blend of PDTT-BOBT:PDI–DPP–PDI lead to dramatic increases in performance upon post-deposition chloroform vapour annealing. Our best cell PCEs increased from 1.9 to 4.5% compared to 1.7 to 4.6% for PTB7-Th. These results have recognized PDTT-BOBT as a practical alternative to PTB7-Th and support its credibility for screening new acceptor materials.
As an interest for future work, we have also identified a couple target area to pursue for improvements in device performance. The negligible light absorption of PDTT-BOBT past 700 nm and poor photochemical stability in air are the most obvious drawbacks to the polymer design. Considering PDTT-BOBT offers a high ionization potential, and correspondingly, a high VOC, it would be ideal to red-shift the onset of absorption with minimal influence to the ionization potential. Therefore, any alterations to target lower band-gap derivatives should focus on modifications to the acceptor component of this polymer. Improving the light stability of PDTT-BOBT will likely require substituting the alkoxy side chains on the benzothiadiazole moiety with more stable solubilizing substituents, albeit without significantly reducing the solubility of the polymer or influencing its self-assembly tendencies.
Although addressing these challenges will require the synthesis of several new polymeric materials we have established a streamlined method to easily screen these derivatives and select the best design.
