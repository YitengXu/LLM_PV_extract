    , Accepted 20th June 2022First published on 29th June 2022AbstractDue to the aggravation of environmental pollution and the energy crisis, it is urgent to develop and design environment-friendly and efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. van der Waals heterostructures composed of different two-dimensional materials offer an easily accessible way to combine properties of individual materials for applications. Herein, a novel Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure is proposed through first-principles calculations. The structural, electronic, and optical properties, as well as the charge transfer mechanism at the interface of Cs3Bi2I9/C2N are systematically investigated. Due to the difference between the work functions of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N monolayers, when they are constructed into heterostructures, redistribution of charge occurs in the whole structure, and some of the charge transfer occurs at the interface due to the formation of an internal electric field. The band structure of Cs3Bi2I9/C2N has type-II band alignment, and the band edge position as well as the band-gap value of the heterostructure are suitable for visible light water splitting. The in-plane biaxial strain, interfacial spacing, and external electric field can effectively modulate the electronic structure and photocatalytic performance of the heterostructure. Under certain conditions, the heterostructure can be changed from type-II to type-I band alignment, accompanied by the transition from an indirect band-gap semiconductor to a direct band-gap semiconductor. Moreover, the intrinsic anion defect (I vacancy) at different positions, as donor defects, can introduce defect levels near the conduction band edge, which affects the transition of photogenerated carriers in these systems. Our findings provide a theoretical design for strategies to improve the performance of two-dimensional perovskites/C2N in photocatalytic and optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Due to the ever-rising energy requirement of society, a great deal of attention has been paid to the utilization of green, clean, and endless renewable energy sources, creating a research hotspot to explore high-efficiency photocatalysts and photovoltaic materials.1–3 Generation of hydrogen (H2) by photocatalytic water splitting with solar energy is a sustainable strategy for addressing the energy scarcity and environmental pollution due to its zero-pollutant emission (the only combustion product is water vapour), higher energy density per unit mass, and light weight, the abundance of solar energy and the fact that it is the highest energy carrier.4,5 Since overall water splitting was experimentally achieved with TiO2,6 many photocatalysts, such as metal nitrides, sulphides and oxides, and other bulk materials, have been reported to play a vital role in solar energy conversion and storage processes.7–12 However, the low solar utilization of bulk materials due to the depressed quantum yield, inability for visible light absorption, high carrier recombination rate, and poor catalytic activity hinders their practical applications as high-efficiency photocatalysts.13,14 Thus, an urgent task is to discover new photocatalysts with improved performance.
The successful mechanical exfoliation of graphene has stimulated research on two-dimensional (2D) materials in the past decade.15–19 Owing to the resultant quantum effects from their reduced dimensions, 2D materials show many intriguing physical and chemical properties that are different from their bulk counterparts.20,21 Meanwhile, 2D materials show great potential for photocatalytic water splitting because of the high specific surface area, which may provide more adsorption and reaction sites.22,23 For practical applications, a promising 2D photocatalyst semiconductor must also possess a small exciton binding energy, low exciton recombination rate and high separation efficiency of photo-generated charge carriers, a band-gap value greater than 1.23 eV, good visible light response and appropriate band edge positions for overall water splitting.24 Recently, carbon nitride materials, including C6N6, C3N4, and C2N,25–27 have been identified as potential photocatalysts due to their well biocompatibility, non-toxicity, abundance and low cost. Due to the appropriate optical direct band-gap and high carrier mobility, 2D C2N nanosheets have attracted much attention.28–31 Moreover, it has been clearly noticed that the C2N monolayer has high water permeability, superior chemical activity and better visible light absorption than the other carbon nitride materials.32 As N and C are lighter elements, the hydrogen storage capacity of C2N may be significant as a result of its high surface-to-volume ratio with a periodic porous structure compared to other 2D materials,33 demonstrating C2N as an effective H2 generation photocatalyst.34 However, the small thickness material with a direct band-gap also has a disadvantage: the photoinduced carriers would usually lie in the same region, leading to a high recombination rate, which is undesirable for water splitting.35 To address this issue, an effective approach is to construct a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure by stacking two different layers vertically.36–38 Due to the weak interlayer coupling effect and the electron transfer between the layers, charges of the vdW heterostructure around the interface are redistributed. Thus, the vdW system not only retains the intrinsic properties of each component but also yields some excellent properties emerging to meet different application requirements.39 Particularly, the heterostructure with type-II band alignment, in which one layer has higher valence-band-maximum (VBM) and conduction-band-minimum (CBM) than the other layer, is favorable for effectively separating the photoinduced carriers into different layers, due to the built-in electric field between the layers. Some C2N-based heterostructures, including (MoS2 or WS2)/C2N,40,41 BlueP/C2N,42 GaTe/C2N,43 InTe/C2N,44 and h-BN/C2N,29 have been designed, which are predicted to have improved activity for photocatalytic water splitting.
Recently, bismuth-based halide perovskites have received increasing attention owing to their low toxicity and high stability compared with lead-based halide perovskites. In particular, all-inorganic cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9, X = Br or I) perovskite nanocrystals with a 2D layered phase are expected to possess a high optoelectronic performance, and have been actively exploited as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction,45 H2 evolution,46 organic synthesis,47 and organic pollutant degradation.48 However, one drawback is that Cs3Bi2X9 has a higher exciton binding energy and more deep energy defects with respect to lead-based halide perovskites,49,50 which is unfavorable for charge separation and photocatalytic efficiency.51 Accordingly, the preparation of the heterostructure of 2D perovskites with other 2D layered materials is expected to provide a new exciting phenomenon. In previous reports, the Cs3Bi2I9-based heterogeneous systems, such as Cs3Bi2I9/TiO2,52 Cs3Bi2I9/g-C3N4,53 and Cs3Bi2I9/Bi2WO6,54 have been successfully synthesized in experiments and proved their stability in aqueous media with outstanding photocatalytic performance. Motivated by those interesting works on the designing of type-II heterostructures, we have selected the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N vdW heterostructure. Herein, the structural, electronic, and optical properties, as well as the charge transfer mechanism at the interface of Cs3Bi2I9/C2N are systematically investigated by using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Due to the difference between the work functions of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N monolayers, when they are constructed into heterostructures, redistribution of charge occurs in the whole structure, and some of the charge transfer occurs at the interface due to the formation of an internal electric field. The band structure of Cs3Bi2I9/C2N has type-II band alignment, and the band edge positions as well as band-gap values of the heterostructure are suitable for visible light water splitting. Moreover, the in-plane biaxial strain, interfacial spacing, external electric field and I vacancy can effectively modulate the electronic structure and photocatalytic performance of the heterostructure.
Computational details and models
DFT calculations are based on the projected augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential applied to describe the interactions between core and valence electrons as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.55–57 The valence electron configuration is as follows: C(2s2p2), N(2s2p3), Cs(6s1), Bi(6s2p3), and I(5s2p5). The exchange correlation functional is used within generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional.58,59 For all calculations, a cutoff energy for the plane wave basis is set to 500 eV. The conjugate-gradient scheme is applied for geometric optimization until the force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å−1, and the total energy change is less than 10−6 eV to acquire good convergence. A sufficient vacuum space (∼25 Å) is added along the z direction (in the direction perpendicular to the interface) to decouple the spurious interaction between repeated slabs. The interlayer vdW interaction between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N is corrected using the DFT-D3 method of Grimme.60 For both accuracy and efficiency, the Brillouin zone is sampled on a Γ-centered k-mesh of 11 × 11 × 1 for optimizing the geometry and calculating the total energy of the Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N monolayers, and 9 × 9 × 1 for the formed heterostructure.61 The convergence tests on the cutoff energy, k-points, and thickness of the vacuum layer are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) to verify the reliability of the calculated results. Given that the GGA-PBE functional probably underestimates the band gap, the HSE06 hybrid functionals with a screening parameter of 0.2 Å−1 and the mixing parameter of 25% are adopted for more accurate property determination.62 The dipole correction has an ignorable impact on the electronic structures of the monolayers and heterostructure and is thus not considered in the following calculations. Moreover, Cs and Bi are heavy elements, so the effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) on the electronic structures is considered in both the Cs3Bi2I9 monolayer and the heterostructure. To ensure the structural stability of the heterostructure, the phonon dispersion spectrum is calculated using the finite displacement method on the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell with 128 atoms by using the PHONOPY package.63,64 To verify the stability of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure at room temperature (300 K), we perform room temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for more than 5000 fs with a time step of 1 fs. In MD simulations, a supercell of size 2 × 2 × 1 is employed to guarantee the decay of interatomic force constants within the supercell dimensions.
For 2D monolayers and their heterostructures, the absorption range of the spectrum is very important in the application of optoelectronic devices, and we calculate the optical absorption coefficient using the following formula:65,66 (1)where ε1 and ε2 are the real part and imaginary part of the complex dielectric function, respectively, and the ε1 could be obtained from ε2 using the Kramer–Kronig relationship. The ε2 is defined as (2)Here α and β represent the x and y directions, respectively, and Ω is the volume of the unit cell. The indices c and v refer to the conduction and valence band states, respectively. The ω and μ correspond to the photon frequency and the vector defining the polarization of the incident electric field, respectively.67,68
Results and discussion
Initially, the structural and electronic properties of individual Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N layers are investigated before fabricating 2D heterostructures. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), in the Cs3Bi2I9 unit cell, a pair of [BiI6]3− octahedra share faces to form a [Bi2I9]3− bioctahedra, which results in a hexagonal symmetric structure with the Cs cations filling the hexagonal channels (D6h point group).50 The C2N layer has periodic holes in the form of a delocalized benzene structure. The two aromatic rings are joined together by pyrazine rings that are made up of a six-membered D2h point group with two N atoms facing each other.41 The optimized lattice constants of the unit cell are 8.60 Å and 8.33 Å for the individual Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N, respectively, which are consistent with the previously reported results,40,69 confirming the reliability of the following calculated results. The analogous lattice constants of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N suggest the likelihood of epitaxial stacking, especially in few-layer systems. The band structures of the monolayers are theoretically calculated using the HSE06 method, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c) and (d). For comparison, the relevant results using the PBE functional are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It is found that both monolayers have a semiconductor nature. In detail, the Cs3Bi2I9 monolayer shows an indirect band-gap, in which the CBM is located at the high symmetric Γ point, while the VBM is present at the K point. In contrast, the C2N monolayer has a direct semiconductor characteristic, in which both CBM and VBM are located at the Γ point. The gap values of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N monolayers are calculated to be about 3.09 eV (2.44 eV) and 2.47 eV (1.66 eV) using the HSE06 (PBE) functional. These values are in good agreement with the previous theoretical calculations.29,44,50,69 Moreover, in Fig. 1(e) and (f), the calculated total density of states (TDOS) and the projected density of states (PDOS) show that the CBM of the Cs3Bi2I9 comprises I-5p and Bi-6p states, while the VBM is only dominated by I-5p states. For C2N, both CBM and VBM are mainly composed of C-2p and N-2p states with strong orbital hybridization.

Due to the analogous lattice constants of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N, the model of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure as shown in Fig. 2(a) is built by attaching the unit cells of each component together with a total atom number of 32. The lattice mismatch is determined by the relation η = 2(a1 − a2)/(a1 + a2) × 100%, which shows that there is a slight mismatch of 3.19% occurring in the vdW heterostructure, ensuring the structural stability and experimental feasibility.70 In our theoretical simulation, the lattice constants of the heterostructure are first sited to the average value due to the absence of a substrate, where moderate strains are applied to both the monolayers. During atomic structure relaxation calculations to find the most energetically favorable structure, all the atoms and in-plane lattice vectors of the simulation box are free to relax. After fully relaxing the heterostructure, the in-plane lattice constant a is 8.35 Å and the equilibrium interlayer distance between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N is 3.63 Å. The lattice vectors and fractional coordinates of each employed cell are shown in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†). To evaluate the relative stability of the heterostructure, the interface binding energy (Eb) is calculated, according to the equation Eb = (EHS − ECsBiI − ECN)/S, where EHS is the total energy of the heterostructure, ECsBiI and ECN are, respectively, the energies of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N monolayers fixed with the same lattice constant as the heterostructure, and S denotes the contact area. The calculated binding energy of Cs3Bi2I9/C2N is −65.84 meV Å−2, which is more negative than those of other C2N-based heterostructures, such as GeI2/C2N (−14.94 meV Å−2),70 h-BN/C2N (−13.40 meV Å−2),29 g-ZnO/C2N (−44.29 meV Å−2),71 and blueP/C2N (−42.01 meV Å−2),42 indicating that the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure should possess better stability. Moreover, the negative binding energy corresponds to an exothermic reaction, which further confirms the thermodynamic feasibility. The phonon dispersion of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure is shown in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†). The absence of imaginary frequencies in the entire Brillouin zone confirms the dynamical stability of the heterostructure. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are also performed to evaluate the thermodynamic stability, as shown in Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). Results indicate that no obvious structural disruption occurs after 5 ps at 300 K, and total energy (without entropy contribution) fluctuates within a small range. Therefore, thermal stability for the heterostructure can be determined, and the experimental feasibility may be strongly expected.

The inset is the band decomposed charge density of the CBM and VBM. 
The projected band structures of Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructures obtained by the HSE06 functional are shown in Fig. 2(b), indicating that the weak vdW interaction between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N will not destroy the intrinsic nature of the individual layers after creating the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure. The indirect band-gap of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure is about 1.91 eV (1.12 eV) using the HSE06 (PBE) functional, which is less than those of the individual layers. The smaller band-gap may be more conducive to the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, effectively enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the band-gap value is greater than the minimum band-gap energy (1.23 eV) necessary for photocatalysis processes.14 The electron transfer from the VBM to CBM needs a photon with a larger energy than the band-gap, but a phonon is also required in an indirect semiconductor. However, the reduced band-gap energy will ensure more visible light absorption with significant solar energy conversion efficiency and make the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers easy with the contribution of phonons. The CBM is located at the Γ point and mainly contributed from the C2N layer, whereas the VBM is positioned at the K point and dominated by the Cs3Bi2I9 layer, resulting in a type-II band alignment. These phenomena can also be obtained intuitively from the related band decomposed charge density of the CBM and VBM (inset of Fig. 2(c)), which clearly shows the spatial separation and localization of charge carriers in the individual monolayers. As the photogenerated charge distribution is maintained in different layers and spontaneously separated at the interface, the type-II band alignment makes the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure promising as a solar energy conversion device. Moreover, the CBM is more localized with the relatively flat energy bands compared to the VBM, meaning that photogenerated electrons have greater effective masses, which may also increase electron–hole pair separation during the water redox reaction and photocatalytic activity. As shown from the calculated TDOS and the corresponding PDOS as shown in Fig. 2(c), the CBM is primarily contributed by the C-2p and N-2p states with strong orbital hybridization, whereas the VBM is mostly dominated by the I-5p states, confirming type-II band alignment. It is worth mentioning that HSE06 only enhances the band-gap without any notable changes in the orbital contributions of the CBM and VBM.
For a clearer understanding of the charge redistribution and interaction mechanism of the interface, the plane-averaged charge density difference of the heterostructure is shown in Fig. 3(a). The negative value represents charge depletion and the positive value represents charge accumulation. The corresponding 3D isosurface of the charge density difference is also shown in the inset. These results demonstrate that the two layers are preferably bonded with each other and a large amount of charge transfer from the Cs3Bi2I9 to C2N and a remarkable charge redistribution occur at the interface, resulting in electron–hole puddles and an interface dipole layer. The work function of the monolayers is also used to evaluate the potential barrier at the interface between them, which determines the direction of electron flow. As shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4(c), the obtained work functions of Cs3Bi2I9, C2N, and Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructures are 5.57 eV, 5.77 eV, and 5.34 eV, respectively. When the interface between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N monolayers is formed, electron flows from Cs3Bi2I9 to C2N owing to the higher work function for C2N till the Fermi level reaches equilibrium, which is consistent with the analysis result of the charge density difference. As calculated from Bader charge analysis, an insignificant amount (0.045 |e|) of charge transfer is found to occur from Cs3Bi2I9 to C2N, confirming the weak vdW interlayer interaction. From the electrostatic potential distribution of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure along the z direction (see Fig. 3(b)), it can be found that a built-in electric field of ∼4.93 eV is formed at the interface of the heterostructure, and the powerful built-in electric field is conducive to the spatial separation of electron–hole pairs, which further inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes and prolongs the lifetime of photogenerated carriers.72

(b) Schematic diagram of the photocatalytic hydrogen production mechanism in the heterostructure. (c) Band edge positions based on HSE06 calculations. The vacuum level is set to zero, and the redox potentials of water splitting at pH = 0 and pH =7 are represented by red and blue dotted lines, respectively. 
The migration mechanism of photogenerated electrons–holes in the heterostructure is illustrated in Fig. 4(a). When irradiated photon energy is greater than the band-gaps of both Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N, electrons in valence bands (VB) will be excited to conduction bands (CB), thereby generating holes in VB. The band offset has a significant influence on the photogenerated carriers. As the conduction band offset (CBO) impelling, the excited electrons in CB of Cs3Bi2I9 flow continuously to CB of C2N and accumulate. Meanwhile, the holes generated in VB of C2N will be assisted with the valence band offset (VBO) to inject into VB of Cs3Bi2I9, which realizes the spontaneous electron–hole separation in space. Therefore, the type-II band alignment of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure is conducive to overcome the recombination of electron–hole pairs. As a consequence, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mainly occurs at the C2N layer, whereas the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) chiefly takes place at the Cs3Bi2I9 layer.73 The advantages of heterostructure photocatalysts have been reported in related experiments.74–77 Furthermore, another interesting mechanism is the Z-scheme which provides the photogenerated charges with high redox ability for photocatalysis.78 In such a system, there exists a charge transfer between the adjacent CB and VB through the interface. The recombination of electrons and holes of the respective semiconductors is facilitated by the built-in electric field, which helps in the efficient separation of electrons and holes with high redox capabilities. Based on the Z-scheme mechanism, a new mechanism called the step-scheme (S-scheme) has also been reported, which is applicable to several photocatalytic processes.79–81 In Fig. 4(c), the band edge positions of each monolayer and Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure relative to the vacuum level are shown schematically based on HSE06 calculations at both pH = 0 and pH = 7. The band-gap of a good photocatalyst should be higher than the free energy of water splitting (1.23 eV) and straddle redox potentials, i.e., the CBM must be higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 and the VBM must be lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O. As the redox potentials are connected with pH values, the standard potentials (vs. vacuum) at different pH values are expressed as: (3) (4)
It can be seen that both the monolayer and the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure can straddle the water redox potentials at both pH values. At pH = 7, although the monolayers fulfill the requirement of overall water splitting, the CBM of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure lies very close to the reduction potential of H+/H2, which may restrict the HER activity. Moreover, at pH = 0, the VBM and CBM of the heterostructure are located at 0.27 eV lower than the O2/H2O potential and 0.52 eV higher than the H+/H2 potential, respectively. Due to the presence of heavy elements, after considering SOC, both the CBM and VBM of Cs3Bi2I9 move towards the Fermi level, especially the CBM, resulting in a significant decrease in the band-gap (∼2.48 eV), as shown in Fig. 5(a). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the band-gap of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure decreases correspondingly (∼1.68 eV). However, the CBM of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure after considering SOC is lower than the reduction potential of H+/H2 at pH = 7. An appropriate acidic pH value is needed for the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure for photocatalytic water splitting. The band edge positions as well as band-gap values of the heterostructure ensure that the visible light water splitting redox reactions are thermodynamically favorable in an acidic environment.

(d) Calculated power conversion efficiency contour as a function of the donor bandgap and conduction band offset. 
In order to evaluate the overall efficiency of photocatalytic performance, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure with type-II band alignment is calculated using Scharber's method,82 in which the upper limit of the PCE in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency can be expressed as follows: (5)where βFF is the band fill factor, which is supposed to have a value of 0.65. The maximum open circuit voltage VOC is estimated using Edg − ΔEc − 0.3, where Edg is the band-gap of the donor and ΔEc is the CBO, as shown from the band alignments in Fig. 5(c). P(ℏω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ℏω. Here, the Cs3Bi2I9 layer is the donor and the C2N layer is the receptor. The PCE contour plots in Fig. 5(d) show that the PCE of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure is 6.4%, which is comparable to reported MoSSe/g-GeC (7.6%) and some III–V group vdW heterostructures.83,84
Optical absorption is another important factor for photocatalysts. A wide and strong optical absorption spectrum is needed for efficient solar energy utilization in water splitting reactions. For producing electron–hole pairs, the process of photon absorption is the first step in water splitting. Fig. 6 displays the calculated absorption curves based on HSE06. The C2N monolayer can absorb both visible and ultraviolet light. Compared to the C2N monolayer, Cs3Bi2I9 shows a much stronger absorption coefficient in the ultraviolet light region. Moreover, the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure shows a wider absorption range and higher optical absorption, which displays an obvious enhancement, as compared with the individual layers. The enhancement effect of optical absorption performance can be ascribed to strengthen interlayer hybridization interaction and charge transfer at the interface. The hybridization interaction can induce new optical transitions between overlapped electronic states and enhance optical absorption intensity.68

In order to study the overall water splitting performance, the thermodynamic feasibility of the HER and OER on the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure is explored by calculating the changes in the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) during water splitting. The ΔGi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) for each adsorption reaction is evaluated as follows:85 ΔGi = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS + ΔGU + ΔGpH(6)where ΔE and ΔZPE are the changes in total energy and zero-point energy, respectively. T is the temperature (298 K) and ΔS is the variation of entropic contribution. ΔGU and ΔGpH represent the influence of the electrochemical potential and pH value on ΔG, respectively. ΔGU = −eU, where e is the electron charge and U is the potential difference. ΔGpH = −kBTln10 × pH, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. The potential driving force for the HER (Ue) can be obtained by Ec − EH+/H2. And for the OER (Uh), it can be obtained by EH+/H2 – Ev.
As shown in Fig. 4(b), the HER occurs in the C2N layer and the OER occurs in the Cs3Bi2I9 layer. The ΔG of the HER and OER pathway is illustrated in Fig. S4(a) and (b) (ESI†), and the insets show the related reaction steps. With Ue = 0 V, the overpotential of the HER reaches 1.60 eV. The values of ΔG at pH = 0 (Ue = 0.52 V) and pH = 7 (Ue = 0.11 V) are also calculated. Although the overpotential decreases, the reaction is still not spontaneous. Analogously, in the case of the OER, the first step needs to overcome a larger free energy barrier, although it can be mitigated by Uh. Therefore, by comparing the free energy diagrams of the HER and the OER, we find that both of them have higher potential barriers, which is not conducive to the spontaneous occurrence of the HER and the OER. Therefore, a more bias is necessary to make every step downhill.
In general, strain engineering is considered to be a feasible strategy to adjust electronic and optical properties, especially the band alignment of heterostructures.86 To examine the sensitivity of the electronic and related properties, in-plane biaxial strain is applied uniformly along both the x and y directions while allowing the atomic positions to relax fully in the strained supercells. Strain is given by ε = (a − a0)/a0, where a and a0 are the lattice constants of the strained and unstrained systems, respectively. As hybrid functional HSE06 shows the same trend in the variation in the band-gap with strain as PBE,87 the latter is used in the following discussions, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and Fig. 7(a). When the compressive strain is applied, the band-gap of the heterostructure decreases gradually. When the strain is greater than −6%, the heterostructure changes from type-II to type-I band alignment, accompanied by the transition from an indirect band-gap to a direct band-gap semiconductor. Under tensile strain, the band-gap of the heterostructure monotonously increases, but maintains the type-II band alignment. The mechanism for the variation in band alignment can be more thoroughly obtained from the effect of applied strains on the band-gap and potential band edge position of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N in the heterostructure. In Fig. 8, taking the vacuum level as a reference, the compressive strain reduces the band-gap of both Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N layers, and the variation in the C2N layer is more obvious. Especially when ε > −6%, the relative position of the VBM in the C2N layer is higher than that in the Cs3Bi2I9 layer, thus the system is transformed into I-type band alignment with both the CBM and the VBM dominated by the C2N layer. Tensile strain leads the band-gap of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N layers to increase slowly, but the relative position of the band edge does not change obviously, so the original band alignment of type-II is maintained. Fig. 7(b) and (c) show the plane-averaged charge density difference and optical absorption curves of the strained systems. With compressive strain, the interfacial charge transfer increases, indicating that the interlayer interaction is enhanced. Especially when ε > −6%, the charge transfer increases obviously, which is consistent with the results of band alignment transition. Under tensile strain, the charge transfer between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N gradually decreases, suggesting that the interaction between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N layers is weakened, and the properties of different layers in the heterostructure gradually change to the corresponding isolated systems. In addition, the reduction of the band-gap under compressive strain results in a red shift of the absorption peak and a decrease in the absorption coefficient. The tensile strain causes these properties to change in opposite trends.

According to previous studies, changing the interlayer distance and applying an external electric field can also affect the coupling strength of the vdW interface, thus affecting the charge transfer and electronic properties. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Fig. 9(a), the interlayer distance in the equilibrium state is 3.63 Å, and the band-gap of the heterostructure does not change significantly as the interlayer distance decreases to 2.43 Å (ΔD = 1.20 Å). When the spacing is less than 2.43 Å, the band-gap of the system decreases rapidly, and the CBM also shifts from the Γ point to the M point. The VBM also moves from the K point to the M point, leading the system to transform into a direct band-gap semiconductor. In contrast, with the increase of interlayer spacing, the band-gap of the system gradually increases, but the CBM and VBM are always located at Γ and K points, keeping the indirect band-gap unchanged. The behavior of type-II band alignment is sustained during the whole process. In addition, the decrease of the interlayer distance will inevitably strengthen the interaction between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N layers, resulting in the increase of the charge transfer at the interface, especially when the layer spacing is less than 2.43 Å (see Fig. 9(b)). In Fig. 9(c), the decrease in the band-gap can be represented as the red shift of the absorption peak, while the light absorption coefficient decreases slightly.88

The band structures and band-gaps of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure with the external electric field varying from −0.6 V Å−1 to +0.6 V Å−1 are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 10(a). The external electric field perpendicular to the interface can regulate the electronic structure of the system by influencing the interface dipole behavior. In our calculations, the positive (negative) direction of the external electric field is defined as that pointing from C2N (Cs3Bi2I9) to Cs3Bi2I9 (C2N). After constructing the heterostructure, a large amount of charge transfer takes place from Cs3Bi2I9 to C2N at the interface, resulting in an interface dipole layer. The positive electric field synergistic with the interfacial dipole layer can further promote the electron transfer from Cs3Bi2I9 to C2N, which can be clearly seen from the plane-averaged charge density difference as shown in Fig. 10(b), resulting in the downward movement of the CBM and the upward movement of the VBM. The band-gap of the heterostructure decreases rapidly, but the behavior of type-II band alignment remains unchanged. However, the negative electric field inhibits the charge transfer at the interface, which leads to the gradual increase in the band-gap and the decoupling between Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N layers, and finally changes from the type-II staggered gap to the type-I straddling gap. The electric field has little effect on the absorption spectrum, and the absorption coefficient decreases slightly regardless of the positive or negative electric field. On comparing with the previously reported type-II semiconductor heterostructures,70,85,89 the isolated Cs3Bi2I9 has five atomic layers. Therefore, in the process of applying in-plane strain or changing interface spacing, the system has a certain buffer effect on these external disturbances. However, the band-gap of the system is very sensitive to the external electric field.

Finally, we focus on the effect of the intrinsic anion defect (I vacancy) on the electronic structure of the heterostructure. Defects can not only affect the interface dipole behavior but also provide more active sites for the photocatalytic water splitting process. From the band structures shown in Fig. 11(a–c), we can find that the I vacancy at different positions, as donor defects, can introduce defect levels near the CBM, which affects the transition of photogenerated carriers in these systems. Interestingly, when the I vacancy is located at the bottom of the Cs3Bi2I9 layer, except for the introduction of the n-type defect at the CBM, the change in the interface dipole behavior leads to the VBM of C2N, moving beyond that of Cs3Bi2I9, thus regulating the band alignment of the system. In Fig. 12, by analyzing the migration behavior of the I atom in the defective Cs3Bi2I9, it can be seen that whether the I atom migrates from the top surface or from the bottom surface to the intermediate lattice site, it has to cross a high energy barrier, suggesting the stability of the I vacancy. Furthermore, the I vacancy is more likely to form on the top or bottom surface than on the intermediate lattice.54,90 Our study provides a good platform and abundant regulation means for the construction of heterostructures with type-II band alignment for efficient photocatalytic water splitting.

Conclusions
In summary, based on first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate structural, electronic, and optical properties, as well as the charge transfer mechanism at the interface of a novel 2D Cs3Bi2I9/C2N vdW heterostructure. Due to the difference between the work functions of Cs3Bi2I9 and C2N monolayers, when they are constructed into heterostructures, a large amount of charge transfer from Cs3Bi2I9 to C2N and a remarkable charge redistribution occur at the interface, resulting in electron–hole puddles and an interface dipole layer. The band structure of Cs3Bi2I9/C2N has type-II band alignment, and the band edge position as well as the band-gap value of the heterostructure are suitable for visible light water splitting. Moreover, the in-plane biaxial strain, interfacial spacing, external electric field and I vacancy can effectively adjust electronic and optical properties, especially the band alignment of heterostructures. Thus, the 2D Cs3Bi2I9/C2N vdW heterostructure can be deemed to be a potential candidate for photocatalytic water splitting. We hope that the obtained results could set up a new pathway for the design and application of the Cs3Bi2I9/C2N heterostructure photocatalyst.
