    , Accepted 29th January 2019First published on 31st January 2019AbstractTo solve the increasing greenhouse problem and to achieve sustainable carbon cycling, effective conversion of CO2 through chemical or electrochemical ways is key. In this study, efficient and controllable conversion of CO2 mainly to CO and CH4 has been demonstrated in a proton conducting solid oxide electrolysis cell (P-SOEC) using BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ (BZY) as the electrolyte and SrEu2Fe1.8Co0.2O7−δ as the anode, in which an excellent current density of 1.23 A cm−2 at 1.5 V was achieved at 550 °C and 100 hours of smooth operation is demonstrated. Compared with the pure steam electrolysis, impedance spectral investigations indicate that the presence of CO2 in the cathode actually accelerates the electrode reactions, in contrast with that in a regular O-SOEC. This may be attributed to the higher adsorption of CO2 and more effective conversion of protons over the BZY electrolyte. With the increase of electrolysis current, formation of both CO and CH4 are enhanced, contradictory to the deduction based on thermodynamic calculations in which the concentration of CH4 increases while that of CO reduces. In situ Raman and in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) was conducted, and reaction routes for CO2 were then proposed. Continuously replenished protons, which steadily and efficiently react with CO32− to form–OCO– and finally CO, are suggested to play a critical role in the conversion of CO2 and the formation of CO in the P-SOEC. Our results shed new light on future effective conversion of CO2.
1. Introduction
Conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels has been largely boosted by the emerging global warming issue and the increasing energy demands.1 Up to now, many methods, including photocatalysis, chemical catalysis, electrochemical catalysis and their combinations, have been proposed to achieve CO2 conversion with plenty of catalysts applied and various products (such as CO, CH4, and olefins) obtained.2–6 Unfortunately, limited by the great stable structure of CO2, efficient CO2 conversion with a desirable reaction rate and energy input is still an issue with global challenges.1
One of the attractive ways is CO2 conversion in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which is deemed as a promising approach not only to solve the environmental issue arising from CO2 emission but also to efficiently utilize the non-grid-connected electricity generated by solar or wind power. Traditional SOECs adopt oxygen ion conductors as electrolytes (O-SOECs), e.g. yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ), and high operating temperatures (700–900 °C) are required to achieve sufficient performances, which, nevertheless, brings a great challenge toward both the cost and lifespan of the SOEC stacks. Compared with O-SOECs, SOECs using proton-conducting electrolytes (P-SOECs) are more prone to work at low-intermediate temperatures (400–700 °C) because of the low energy barrier for proton migration and proton involved electrode reactions, and this saves the power input and benefits the optimization of stack materials and their service life.7,8 Moreover, at low operating temperatures, hydrocarbons in addition to CO were proposed to form at the cathode, which may broaden the application of P-SOECs.9
Unfortunately, very limited investigations till now have been done on CO2 electrolysis in P-SOECs. E. Ruiz-Trejo et al. studied the cathode materials of a P-SOEC with an electrolyte (BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3−δ, BZCYZn)-supported structure, and an electrolysis current density of 40 mA cm−2 was obtained at 1.5 V/600 °C using Pt-modified Fe as the cathode, which is far below the practical demand.9 Similarly, a low current density of 20 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V/600 °C was achieved for a P-SOEC with a (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3−δ-BZCYZn anode and Ni-BZCYZn cathode, respectively.10 What is worse, the performance of the cell dropped by about 30% within 12 hours of short-term operation, which may be ascribed to carbon deposition, Ni oxidation and the decaying of the BZCYZn electrolyte. Xie et al. demonstrated an anode supported single cell using Ni-BZCYZn as the anode and Fe-BZCYZn as the cathode, and a current density of 1.5 A cm−2 was achieved at 2.6 V and 614 °C with humid H2 and CO2 injected into the anode and cathode, respectively. A small amount of CH4 was observed at a current density of 1.5 A cm−2, and a short-term stability for 60 minutes was demonstrated.11 All this indicated that CO2 electrolysis in P-SOECs is still a challenge despite its good prospects predicted. Moreover, rare studies on the reaction mechanisms of CO2 conversion in P-SOECs have been conducted.
In this work, CO2 conversion was conducted with P-SOECs, as illustrated in Fig. 1, in which BaZr0.8Y0.2O2.9 (BZY)12,13 and SrEu2Fe1.8Co0.2O7−δ (SEFC)-BZY were adopted as the electrolyte and anode, respectively, due to their great stability in CO2 and steam containing atmospheres.14–16 The electrochemical performance and stability of such single cells were investigated. Gas evolution as functions of electrolysis currents and operating temperatures was characterized using gas chromatography. The thermal equilibrium gas composition was calculated as comparison for the practical outlet gas of P-SOECs. In situ Raman, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) was employed to investigate the free radicals over the cathode surface and the products/intermediates in CO2 conversion reactions. Potential reaction paths for CO2 electrolysis were also discussed.

2. Experimental
2.1 Single cell fabrication
P-SOEC single cells employed the cathode supported configuration with BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ (BZY), SrEu2Fe1.8Co0.2O7−δ-BZY, and Ni-BZY as the electrolyte, anode and cathode, respectively. All the powders were prepared via a citric acid–EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid) complexing method, as previously reported.16,17 Detailed fabrication steps for single cells are described as follows: NiO, BZY and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were mixed in ethanol for 2 hours in a weight ratio of 65:35:10. After drying, the mixed powders were cold pressed at 300 MPa into pellets with a diameter of 15 mm, and then calcined at 600 °C for 2 hours to remove organics. The BZY powder with 1 wt% NiO as the sintering aid was well dispersed in ethanol and then dip coated on the green cathode substrates. The formed bilayers were co-sintered at 1430 °C for 5 hours to get a dense electrolyte film. Finally, the SEFC and BZY powder (in a weight ratio of 95:5) was mixed with terpineol as the anode ink, and brush painted on the electrolyte surface with an effective area of 0.385 cm2. Here, 5% BZY is added to improve the binding between the electrolyte and anode.16 The formed samples were heated at 1000 °C for 2 hours to complete cell fabrication.
2.2 Cell characterization
Single cells were sealed onto alumina tubes with ceramic adhesive, and then tested in a home-made testing system, as shown in Fig. S1.† The AC impedance spectra and electrochemical properties of the cells were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (IM6e, Zahner) with 10% H2O−90% air and 20% CO2–80% H2 injected into the anode and cathode, respectively, as reactant gases. Before data collection, the cathode was reduced at 700 °C for 2 hours to ensure the reduction of nickel. The long-term stability of the cell was investigated at electrolysis current densities of 200 mA cm−2 and 800 mA cm−2 at different temperatures using the electrochemical workstation. The micro-structure of the tested cell was visualized on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6700F). As a comparison, the steam electrolysis performance of the P-SOEC was also characterized with 10% H2O–90% air and H2 injected into the anode and cathode, respectively.
A gas chromatograph (GC, Fuli 9790II) equipped with a TDX-01 packed column in thermal conductivity detector (TCD) mode was employed to analyze the composition of the outlet gas of the cathode measured at various temperatures. In this study, the inlet cathode gas was diluted to 30% with argon (30% × (20% CO2–80% H2) mixture–70% Ar = 6% CO2–24% H2–70% Ar) to suppress the impact of large H2 peaks and to ensure the accurate analysis of the outlet gas composition. With this reactant, the open circuit voltages (OCV) of the cell dropped slightly from 0.97 V to 0.93 V measured at 550 °C (Fig. S2†). The flow rates of cathode and anode gases were set as 45 ml min−1 and 30 ml min−1, respectively. To meet GC's demand for the stream concentration, the outlet gas was dried in a cold trap before entering the GC, and the composition of the obtained liquid in the cold trap was characterized by GC using a PLOT-Q capillary column in flame ionization detector (FID) mode.
For Raman spectral investigation, the pre-reduced half-cell (cathode supported electrolyte film) was put into a catalytic reaction pool with the cathode facing the detector, and then heated up to 550 °C in N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After switching the gas to the 6% CO2–24% H2–70% Ar mixture, Raman spectra were recorded on a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw in Via) with a 532 nm laser and the wavenumber set as 200–2000 cm−1. X-ray diffraction patterns of the tested cathode were recorded using a Rigaku TTR-III powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 10° min−1 in the range from 20° to 80°. To investigate the possible formation of any amorphous solids on the tested samples, pictures of BZY powders after being treated at 550 °C in 6% CO2–24% H2–70% Ar for 2 hours were taken using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Talos F200X).

In situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS, BRUKER IFS 66v/S) was employed to study the free radical species adsorbed on the surfaces of Ni, BZY and Ni-BZY samples. Before measurements, powders were mixed with KBr in a weight ratio of 1:10. Measurements were conducted in the 6% CO2–24% H2–70% Ar mixture at 500 °C with the wavenumber ranging from 600 to 4000 cm−1. The background data for in situ DRIFTS experiments for each sample were collected in N2 atmosphere. The CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiment was conducted from 100 to 900 °C at 10 °C min−1 with pure argon as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min−1 using a Thermo Finnigan TPDRO 1100 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Before the test, the nickel and BZY powder was reduced at 700 °C for 2 hours by pure hydrogen and, then the temperature was lowered to 200 °C for 30 minutes of CO2 adsorption.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Electrochemical performance of the single cell

Fig. 2(a) shows the I–V curves of the P-SOEC single cell tested at 400–600 °C in 20% CO2–80% H2 and 10% H2O–90% air atmospheres. Open circuit voltages (OCV) of the cell are 0.99 and 0.94 V measured at 500 and 600 °C, respectively, indicating that the electrolyte is very dense. At an electrolysis voltage of 1.5 V, a large current density of 1.73 A cm−2 is achieved at 600 °C. This is much better than that in previous reports on CO2 electrolysis in P-SOECs10,11,18 as summarized in Table S1,† in which some performances for pure steam electrolysis are also listed as comparison.7,12–16,19 The good performance of our P-SOEC should be attributed to the optimized cathode-supported cell configuration and the application of the efficient SEFC anode.16 Notably, the performance of our cell is also comparable with those of O-SOECs at elevated temperatures (e.g. 0.4 A cm−2 at 1.3 V at 800 °C with a Ni-YSZ cathode20 and 1.1 A cm−2 at 1.6 V at 800 °C for the cell with a BaCO3 modified Ni-YSZ cathode21), well consistent with the prior hypothesis that P-SOECs should exhibit better performance because of the low energy barriers for proton diffusion and reactions. Interestingly, electrolysis performances of the cell with pure H2 (pure steam electrolysis) and the 20% CO2–80% H2 mixture injected into the cathode, respectively, are very close, as shown in Fig. 2(b), suggesting that the existence of CO2 in the cathode does not hinder the electrode reactions in P-SOECs. This phenomenon is quite different from that in O-SOECs, in which CO2 injection is found to largely suppress the cathode reaction rate.22–24

(d) Long-term stability of the P-SOEC measured at 550 °C at an electrolysis current density of 800 mA cm−2 with 20% CO2–80% H2 and 10% H2O–90% air injected into the cathode and anode, respectively. (e) Bulk resistances (Rb) and (f) polarization resistances (Rp) of the cell with pure H2 (blue) and the 20% CO2–80% H2 mixture (orange) injected into the cathode, respectively, measured at different applied voltages (vs. OCV). 
Impedance spectra of the single cell are then investigated as shown in Fig. 2(c). Measured under open circuit conditions with the 20% CO2–80% H2 mixture injected into the cathode, the fitted bulk resistance (Rb) and polarization resistance (Rp) are 0.69 and 0.84 Ω cm2, respectively, measured at 600 °C, both of which increase with the lowering of testing temperatures. The low activation energy for Rb is calculated to be 0.35 eV, clearly indicating the proton conduction in the electrolyte (Fig. S3†). When measured in electrolysis mode, Rb reduces with the increase of applied voltage, as shown in Fig. 2(e) and S4,† demonstrating the electronic conduction in the BZY electrolyte at electrolysis voltages viaeqn (1). A similar phenomenon has also been observed in previous reports.25,26 Importantly, Rb values for CO2 conversion are slightly lower than those for pure steam electrolysis. This may be ascribed to the formation of H2O at the cathode due to H2 oxidation by CO2. The formed H2O promotes the formation of proton defects in the electrolyte at the expense of oxygen vacancies, as shown in eqn (2), which in turn partially suppress the formation of electronic holes at electrolysis voltages (eqn (1) shifts slightly left), leading to the mildly suppressed electronic conductivity in the electrolyte. Fortunately, such suppressed electronic conduction also implies a better faradaic efficiency for CO2 conversion in the P-SOEC than that for pure steam electrolysis (about 40–70% at 550 °C, Fig. S5†). (1) (2)
In contrast to Rb, values of Rp for CO2 conversion in the P-SOEC are always lower than those for pure steam electrolysis, as shown in Fig. 2(f) and S4,† demonstrating the much improved electrode reaction rate in the presence of CO2. This result is consistent with a recent report, in which authors claimed that adding CO2 into the cathode may promote steam electrolysis.19 It should be noted that values of Rp reduce much faster with increasing voltage than those of Rb, which should be ascribed to the dual effects of the increased electronic conduction in electrolytes and the conversion of rate-limiting steps accelerated by electrochemical forces.26 These results highly indicate that CO2 can be effectively activated by electrochemical forces.
Long-term stability tests of our P-SOEC for CO2 conversion have been conducted at 550 and 450 °C, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and S6.† At both high (800 mA cm−2) and low (200 mA cm−2) electrolysis current densities, the cells can operate steadily for almost 100 hours, demonstrating the good stability of our P-SOEC. SEM pictures of the tested cell are shown in Fig. S7.† After the long-term test, the microstructure of the cell has no obvious change, indicating the good stability and compatibility of the electrolyte and electrode materials under the operating conditions. Considering the high electrochemical performance, good stability and suitable operating temperatures, P-SOECs could play a promising role in CO2 conversion.
3.2 Gas compositions and theoretical calculations
Compositions of the outlet gas for CO2 conversion are investigated. As shown in Fig. 3(a), both CO and CH4 are detected in the outlet gas for the cell under OCV conditions, resulting from the chemical reduction and hydrogenation of CO2. It can be found that the selectivity of CO increases with the increasing test temperature, while that of CH4 reduces, demonstrating that CO is more prone to be generated at high temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the selectivities of CO and CH4 are about 44.9% and 34.5% at 450 °C, and 88.9% and 9.8% at 550 °C, respectively. It is also worth noting that the total selectivity of CO and CH4 at 450 °C is only 80%, and other hydrocarbons such as CH3OH and HCOOH also generate as detected in the cold-condensed liquid (Fig. S8†). Also, formation of such hydrocarbons is highly suppressed at enhanced temperatures and the total selectivity of CO and CH4 can reach about 98% at 550 °C.
 Fig. 3  Selectivity of CO and CH4 in the cathode outlet gas as a function of (a) measured temperature and (b) electrolysis current density at 550 °C. 
With the increase of applied electrolysis currents, the contents of H2, CO and CH4 all increase almost linearly (as shown in Fig. S9(a–c)†), indicating that protons formed at the anode have been successfully transferred to the cathode via the electrolyte film. The respective faradaic efficiency of CO, CH4 and H2 is calculated, as shown in Table 1. The calculated total faradaic efficiency here is 42.8%, slightly lower than that for pure steam electrolysis (43.8%), which seems to be beyond our expectation from Rb analysis. This should be ascribed to the formation of other hydrocarbons, such as CH3OH and HCOOH. Unfortunately, we fail to calculate the accurate content of these hydrocarbons because of the major existence of water in the condensed liquid, which inevitably results in the tailing of the peaks in the GC test and thus lowering the total faradaic efficiency for CO2 conversion here.

It is interesting to find that the selectivities for CO and CH4 formation seem not be impacted by the applied current density, as shown in Fig. 3(b). To reveal such a phenomenon, the thermal equilibrium compositions of the cathode gas as well as their changes after adding additional hydrogen (0.469 ml min−1 to simulate the injected protons via electrolysis at a current density of 400 mA cm−2) are calculated as a function of testing temperature using the Gibbs free energy minimization method, as shown in Fig. S10.†27,28 To make better comparison with GC results, compositions of gases are corrected by removing the content of steam. The obtained theoretical (thermodynamic calculations) and practical (P-SOEC) compositions of the cathode gas at 550 °C in OCV and electrolysis (400 mAcm−2) mode are shown in Fig. 4(a–c). Compared with their theoretical ones, the practical contents of CO and CH4 (especially the latter) are much lower in the cathode outlet gas. This should be ascribed to the inconsistency of thermodynamics and kinetics of cathode reactions, in which the catalytic activity of cathode materials plays a key role. In our reaction system, all gases fail to reach their equilibrium composition due to the low reaction rates. And therefore, in such an unbalanced system, the raw materials, such as H2, have a higher practical ratio compared with their theoretical ones, while the products, such as CO and CH4, have lower practical ratios. Moreover, the cathode catalyst of Ni has high catalytic activity toward methane decomposition, which leads to an extremely low practical content of methane. Notably, in theoretical electrolysis mode (blue bars in Fig. 4(d)), concentrations of H2 and CH4 increase, while they reduce in the case of CO, suggesting that increase of hydrogen theoretically benefits CH4 formation at the expense of CO. In contrast, in a practical electrolysis mode, the CO concentration increases by about 17.6%, clearly indicating that the applied electrolysis current benefits the formation of CO. This is extraordinarily interesting in view of the conversion mechanism for CO2, which may be ascribed to the special catalytic activity of the cathode in electrolysis mode.

The theoretical values in electrolysis are simulated by adding 0.469% H2 (grid bar) to the 6% CO2–24% H2–70% Ar mixture. (d) Theoretical (blue) and practical (orange) increased ratio of H2, CO, CH4 and CO2 in electrolysis mode compared to that at OCV mode (=ni,electrolysis/ni,OCV − 1). 
3.3 Mechanism discussion of CO2 conversion in P-SOECs
To explore the potential intermediates and to investigate the possible mechanisms for CO2 conversion in P-SOECs, in situ Raman29 and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) studies are conducted, which can effectively distinguish functional radicals on the catalyst surface. As shown in the Raman spectra at 550 °C (Fig. 5(a)), the peak at 1060 cm−1 corresponding to CO32− appears immediately over the Ni-BZY sample when the gas switches from N2 to the 6% CO2–24% H2–70% Ar mixture30 and remains stable within the testing time. Fig. 5(c) shows the HRTEM picture of the treated BZY powders in which only BZY crystal lattices rather than any amorphous BaCO3 were observed. For example, the lattice distance in the inset of Fig. 5(c) is 0.297 nm, which corresponds to the BZY (110) plane.31 Since no crystal or amorphous carbonates have been detected in XRD spectra and the HRTEM picture, it's reasonable to speculate that the detected CO32− is surface adsorbed species instead of solid carbonates.32 This may be key for later CO2 electrolytic conversion. It should also be mentioned that the peaks corresponding to solid carbon are invisible within the investigated time range, indicating that solid carbon is not formed under the measured conditions.

(b) XRD spectrum of the Ni-BZY pellet after the Raman test. (c) HRTEM picture of the BZY sample after being treated in 6% CO2–24% H2–70% Ar at 550 °C for 2 hours. The inset shows the enlarged view of (c) which corresponds to the BZY (1 1 0) plane. 
To figure out the exact functional groups over BZY, Ni and Ni-BZY surfaces, in situ DRIFTS spectra of the three samples are studied, as shown in Fig. 6.33,34Fig. 6(a) shows the whole normalized spectra of in situ DRIFTS for the three samples with the background subtracted. The highest peak at 2350 cm−1 indicates gaseous CO2. The peaks at 2120 cm−1 and 2170 cm−1 correspond to the vibration of gaseous CO (Fig. 6(a)), suggesting the formation of CO via the reverse water gas shift reaction over all three samples. Notably, the peak intensities of CO on Ni and Ni-BZY samples are higher than that on BZY, indicating that nickel can facilitate the formation of CO. The enlarged view of spectra shown in Fig. 6(b) involves the asymmetrical (Vas, 1577 cm−1) and symmetrical (Vs, 1367 cm−1) vibration of the carboxylate radical (–COO–), carbonate radical vibration (CO32−, 1420 cm−1), and C–O vibration (1050 cm−1).34,35 It's interesting to find that the peaks corresponding to –OCO– and CO32− are detected on the BZY surface with high intensity, while they are invisible on the Ni surface. This should be ascribed to the high basicity of BZY, which makes it strongly adsorb CO2 molecules and provide the right place for CO2 conversion.36,37 Moreover, the low wavenumber (∼1420 cm−1) for CO32− indicates that CO32− should be in a polydentate configuration (as indicated in Fig. 6(f)), which is more stable at high temperatures than bidentate and bridged carbonate species (Fig. S11†), which are typically located at higher wavenumbers and are prone to desorb at lower temperatures.38 This can also be proved by CO2-TPD results (shown in Fig. S12†), in which two desorption peaks located at 400 and 700 °C are observed. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 6(c), the C–H vibration peak located at 3015 cm−1 is clearly observed on the Ni-BZY sample,33,34 less pronounced in nickel, and invisible in BZY, indicating that methyl species cannot form over the BZY sample, while they preferentially form over Ni-BZY heterogeneous catalysts. This may arise from their interfacial effect and indicates that BZY can facilitate the formation of C–H over the Ni catalyst. Fig. 6(d) shows the peaks corresponding to vibrations of surface adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (–OH, 3730 and 3700 cm−1) and hydroxyl species (–OH, 3630 and 3600 cm−1) in bicarbonate (HCO3−).34,38 The peaks of both –OH are spotted over all three samples, in accordance with the formation of water and CO via the reverse water gas shift reaction. Moreover, the detection of –OH in bicarbonate over Ni catalysts also implies that CO2 can adsorb over Ni, and the invisibility of the CO32− group may arise from the fast conversion of HCO3− to other hydrocarbon radicals, such as C–H and CO under the investigated conditions. From the above, we can conclude that CO2 is more prone to be adsorbed over BZY via the CO32− radical; the C–H radical cannot form over BZY, while BZY can promote its formation over Ni; CO and HCO3− can form over all the samples.

Based on the above observation, conversion of CO2 in P-SOECs in the open circuit state and electrolysis mode can be speculated. In the open circuit state, only thermal reactions happen, and two routes are proposed (Fig. S13†) for CO formation. The former is over the BZY surface: CO2 adsorbs on the BZY surface with oxygen atoms inserted into the oxygen vacancies, and receives electrons from surface O2− and forms carbonate (CO32−)38 on BZY (Fig. 6(f)); carbonate then reacts with protons on BZY to form bicarbonate species (HCO3−) and then decomposes into formate species (–OCO–) and hydroxyl species (–OH) (Fig. 6(g)), which finally turn into CO and water released to the gas (Fig. 6(h)); the reaction details are also listed in Table 2, eqn (1)–(6). The other CO formation route is over the Ni catalyst. CO2 reacts with dissociated hydrogen atom and forms bicarbonate radicals (HCO3−) over the Ni surface, which then decompose into water and CO with the assistance of the other surface hydrogen atoms (Table 2, eqn (7)–(10) and Fig. S13†). For the formation of CH4 (only generated over Ni or Ni-BZY catalysts), CO may be the reactant. Based on molecular orbital theory, CO is ready to adsorb over the nickel with the formation of the C–Ni bond,39 and then receives hydrogen atoms from hydrogen dissociation over nickel and generates methane (Table 2, eqn (11)–(13)).40,41

In electrolysis mode, the protons are generated at the anode via steam electrolysis and transported to BZY in the cathode, also shown in Table 2. Such continuously replenished protons over BZY should be key for the much promoted formation of CO, which steadily and efficiently reacts with CO32− to form–OCO– and finally CO, as indicated by eqn (1)–(6) in Table 2 and Fig. 7. This as well should be the right reason for the observed enhanced concentration of CO in electrolysis mode, which is in contrast to the theoretical expectation of suppressed CO formation with additional H2 injected. Concurrently, the enhanced adsorbed CO over nickel can receive more protons from interfacial BZY and accelerate the formation of methyl radicals and thus CH4, in accordance with the observation in Fig. 4(d) and eqn (11)–(13). Importantly, this reaction mechanism also gives a good explanation for the observed accelerated electrode reactions for CO2 conversion compared with those for pure steam electrolysis. In steam electrolysis, protons formed at the anode migrate to the cathode via the electrolyte and finally generate hydrogen in the cathode. That is to say, hydrogen should be deemed as a product in steam electrolysis, and thus the hydrogen gas continuously injected into the cathode may partially limit the hydrogen formation rate, wile for our CO2 conversion, the active protons transferred to the cathode perform as reducers for CO2 and can shift the reactions of eqn (3), (6) and (12) in Table 2 to the right side, benefiting the formation of CO and CH4via eqn (4), (5) and (12). All this suggested that the continuously replenished protons play a critical role in the conversion of CO2 in P-SOECs.

4. Conclusions
In this study, the performance and reaction mechanism of P-SOECs for effective conversion of CO2 have been investigated. A great electrolysis current density of 1.23 A cm−2 at 1.5 V was achieved at 550 °C, which is comparable to those of O-SOECs operating at 800–900 °C. Impedance spectrum analysis shows that the presence of CO2 in the cathode is beneficial to accelerate the cathode reaction. In situ Raman and in situ DRIFTS analysis indicates that CO2 is more prone to be adsorbed over BZY via the CO32− radical; BZY can promote the formation of the C–H radical over Ni, while BZY cannot generate it alone; and CO as well as HCO3− can form over all the samples. Based on these results, reaction routes of CO2 reduction to CO and CH4 in P-SOECs have been proposed, in which continuously replenished protons are suggested to be key for effective CO2 conversion in P-SOECs.
