    , Accepted 4th April 2013First published on 5th April 2013AbstractSix fluoranthene-fused imide derivatives were employed as acceptors in solution processed inverted BHJ solar cells with P3HT as the donor. The PCEs of all devices vary from 2.14% to 2.89%. All acceptors are in their amorphous state with low electron mobility, but achieving high PCEs.
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have exceeded 10%.1 In the road map of the development of BHJ solar cells, significant efforts have been devoted to the development of various polymeric donors.2–5 For acceptors, however, the structures are rather limited, with fullerene derivatives being the most investigated and the most successful species.6 Recently, soluble non-fullerene electron acceptors, with the possibilities of broadening absorption, tunable energy levels, and facial derivatization and functionalization as compared with fullerene derivatives, have received considerable attention.6–8 Hence, developing non-fullerene acceptors will enrich the diversity of acceptors to match the present high-performance donors, which may ultimately lead to higher PCEs via proper selection and combination of donors and acceptors.
To date, with P3HT as the donor, only a few BHJ solar cells containing non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors exhibited PCEs higher than 1.5%,9–14 and fewer achieved PCEs higher than 2.5%.13 Recently, we used a fluoranthene-fused imide based molecule (FFI-1, Th-CN) as a non-fullerene electron acceptor, and achieved the highest PCE of 1.86% when blended with the P3HT donor in BHJ solar cells.9 To achieve higher PCEs, systemic investigation of the relationship between acceptor structure and device performance is necessary. Herein, we further modify the acceptor structure by changing the substituents from thienyl to five other aryl groups perpendicular to the backbone of the acceptors.9,15 These acceptors provide us a platform to understand the structure–property relationship and to screen out better acceptors based on fluoranthene-fused imides. Through optimization of the process of device-fabrication, we achieve PCEs of over 2.15% for all devices using these six acceptors blended with P3HT, and the highest PCE is up to 2.89%.

Fig. 1 illustrates the chemical structures of the six acceptors based on fluoranthene-fused imide units, which were prepared following our previous report.15 The different aryl groups perpendicular to the backbone of the acceptors are expected to improve the device performance for their different sizes and electron-donating properties. All new compounds have been characterized using 1H and 13C NMR, high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), and elemental analysis (see ESI†). The electrochemical and photophysical properties of all acceptors in the solid state including absorption, emission, photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE), fluorescence lifetime, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are shown in Table 1. All six acceptors show identical absorption features both in solution and in the solid state, which indicates that the introduction of the bulky aromatic substituents effectively suppresses the aggregation of these acceptors in the solid state. The optical band gaps of the six acceptors are measured to be in the range of 2.69 to 2.83 eV from their absorption spectra on ZnO substrates, which are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The measurement of the electrochemical behavior of all six acceptors indicates that the LUMO levels of the six acceptors are in the range of −3.40 to −3.48 eV, indicating higher open circuit voltage (VOC) than that of PCBM system when blending with the P3HT donor. According to the band gap measured through the onset of their absorption features, the HOMO levels of the six compounds are calculated to be located from −6.04 to −6.27 eV.

BHJ solar cells using P3HT as the donor and the six compounds as acceptors were fabricated and characterized. Devices with P3HT as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor were fabricated as control. Before device fabrication, 40 mg of acceptor and 40 mg of P3HT were dissolved into 1 mL of o-dichlorobenzene, respectively, serving as stock solutions. Both solutions were heated at 100 °C for 1 h, filtered through a 0.2 μm filter, and then cooled to room temperature. A typical architecture of inverted solar cells, ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, was employed. Sol–gel processed ZnO serves as the electron transporting layer. Our investigation demonstrates that all devices achieve the maximum PCE at the weight ratio of 1/1 (P3HT/acceptor) in the inverted configuration. As shown in Table 1, all six acceptors achieve PCEs higher than 2%, and three of these are higher than 2.5%. When o-CH3Ph-CN serves as the acceptor, the highest PCE of 2.89% is achieved. Due to similar LUMO levels of these acceptors, the VOC of devices are almost the same, all around 0.95 V. Lower VOC is observed while Th-CN serves as the acceptor, due to the deeper LUMO level of Th-CN. The fill factors (FF) of all devices are around 0.50, which implies that the differences in PCEs of our devices mainly arise from different JSC values. It is notable that with different substituents, the acceptors have different fluorescent properties, but no strong correlation with the performance of the devices (JSC in particular) is found.
The J–V curves, the IPCE spectra, the absorptance (1 − T), and the photocurrent in the reversed region of the devices with different acceptors are shown in Fig. 2. The J–V curves of all devices show the same shape, indicating that the parallel resistances and the series resistances of all devices were at the same level. The calculated parallel resistances range from 600 to 800 Ω cm−2, while the series resistances are between 25 and 33 Ω cm−2. The IPCE responses are correlated with JSC and the highest EQE reaches 48% at 560 nm with o-CH3Ph-CN. The IPCE features of different devices are consistent with the absorptance (1 − T) of different active films, thus suggesting that the excitons generated by both acceptors and donors are separated equally. As shown in Fig. 2d, the maximum photocurrents of the devices with different acceptors follow the same trend with JSC. The different photocurrents in the reversed region can be caused by the differences in charge collections at the electrodes, carrier mobilities in the devices, and polaron pair recombinations. The typical space charge limited current (SCLC) regions in the photocurrent characteristics indicate that the hole and electron transportation in the active films is not balanced.17

Surface morphologies of the active layers with different acceptors were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). These active layers display similar surface roughness and grain size. The surface roughness of all active layers with different acceptors is around 8 nm. The surface composition of the active layers was subsequently investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Under the same conditions, the ratio of the quantum yields of the electrons escaped from the C1s and the S2p orbitals is proportional to the ratio of the amount of these two elements in the X-ray illuminated area on the surface.16 As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the ratios of the S2p and the C1s electron quantum yields of all active layers are similar to that of the pure P3HT film, implying that the surfaces of all different active layers are dominated by P3HT. As a result, P3HT mainly aggregates at the upper surface connected with the MoO3/Ag electrode, whereas the acceptors come into contact with the polar ZnO surface, fitting well with the ideal model of inverted solar cells.16 The above analysis implies that the active layers containing different acceptors display similar vertical distributions of donors and acceptors, which is mainly caused by the different surface energies of donors and acceptors. This is not surprising since the six acceptors have the same fluoranthene-fused imide backbones, only with small change in the substituents.
Furthermore, microstructures of the active films containing different acceptors on ZnO substrates were investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), for all the six active layers, only diffractions of P3HT are observed at the identical 2θ degrees, indicating an edge-on lamellar packing of P3HT chains. The out-plane and in-plane diffractions are all in good agreement with the diffraction data of the pure P3HT film. These results reveal that P3HT has an identical periodically oriented arrangement in all blend films, whereas the acceptors are amorphous, consistent with the peaks at 610 nm (the aggregation peak of P3HT) observed in absorption and EQE spectra (Fig. 2). Thus, the packing mode of P3HT has not changed in the presence of different acceptors. Notably, the diffraction intensities of different blend films vary largely, indicating different crystallinity of the P3HT blend with different acceptors (Fig. S4, ESI†). The crystallinity of P3HT strongly correlates with the hole mobilities of the active layers. Since JSC of the devices should be dependent on the carriers having lower mobility, both hole mobility and electron mobility of the active films are examined to find the factors for different JSC.
The mobilities of active layers containing different acceptors were measured by the SCLC method. The structure of the hole only diode is ITO/PEDOT/active films/MoO3/Ag, while the configuration of the electron only diode is ITO/ZnO/active films/LiF/Al. As shown in Table 1, for the six compounds, their hole mobilities are one order of magnitude higher than their electron mobilities. In particular, the JSC values correlate well with the electron mobilities of the active layers. With o-CH3Ph-CN as the acceptor, the highest electron mobility and the highest JSC are achieved, which leads to the highest PCE. The rest of the acceptors follow the same trend. Interestingly, acceptors with more bulky aryl substituents, such as o-CH3Ph-CN and α-Naph-CN, exhibit higher electron mobilities. Although the electron mobilities of our acceptors (1–9 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) are considerably lower than those of the previously published systems (10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), higher JSC values are achieved from the inverted devices using them as the active acceptors.3,10,18
The investigation of morphology of the active layers with different acceptors indicates that the surface roughness, the vertical distribution and the ordered structures of the active layers are almost identical, thus do not contribute to different device performances (JSC). Therefore, the differences in PCEs may result from the different electron mobilities of the active films.
In conclusion, six fluoranthene-fused imides have been developed as non-fullerene acceptors in the solution processed inverted BHJ solar cells with P3HT as the donor. The inverted BHJ solar cells using the mixture of P3HT and these acceptors at a weight ratio of 1/1 as the active layers show good performance with the PCEs of all devices varying from 2.14 to 2.89%, depending strongly on JSC. Our further investigation indicates that the JSC values of our inverted BHJ solar cells correlate well with electron mobility of the active films containing different acceptors. Other factors such as the morphology of the thin films, the vertical phase-separation and the diffractions of the mixture of P3HT and these acceptors in the active layers all remain almost identical. It is notable that all acceptors are in their amorphous state with low electron mobility, but the devices exhibit high PCEs. Our results may change the notion that only highly crystalline planar aromatic molecules with high electron mobility (which are usually difficult to fabricate) are good candidates for non-fullerene acceptors. Our method to scrutinize possible factors associated with PCEs can be valuable for in-depth investigation of the structure–property relationship of other acceptors for BHJ solar cells.
