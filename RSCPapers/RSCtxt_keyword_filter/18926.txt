    , Accepted 3rd November 2021First published on 3rd November 2021AbstractElectrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate is considered as a perfect route for efficient conversion of the greenhouse gas CO2 to value-added chemicals. However, it still remains a huge challenge to design a catalyst with both high catalytic activity and selectivity for target products. Here we report a unique Sn-doped Bi2O3 nanosheet (NS) electrocatalyst with different atomic percentages of Sn (1.2, 2.5, and 3.8%) prepared by a simple solvothermal method for highly efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate. Of them, the 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibited the highest faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.4% with a current density of 24.3 mA cm−2 for formate at −0.97 V in the H-cell and a maximum current density of nearly 50 mA cm−2 was achieved at −1.27 V. The formate FE is stable maintained at over 90% in a wide potential range from −0.87 V to −1.17 V. Electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses of undoped and Sn doped Bi2O3 NSs indicated that the strong synergistic effect between Sn and Bi is responsible for the enhancement in the adsorption capacity of the OCHO* intermediate, and thus the activity for formate production. In addition, we coupled 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs with a dimensionally stable anode (DSA) to realize battery-driven highly active CO2RR and OER with decent activity and efficiency.
Introduction
Chemical transformation of the greenhouse gas CO2 to value-added chemical feedstocks or fuels is one of the promising routes to fix CO2, thereby alleviating the growing emission of CO2 as well as the energy pressure caused by the increasing shortage of fossil fuels.1–3 Electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR), powered by renewable energies (e.g., solar energy, wind, and tidal power), has attracted increased interest as a promising strategy for achieving environmental and energy sustainability.4–8 However, achieving desirable activity and satisfactory selectivity simultaneously is generally limited by the chemical inertness of CO2 molecules, the complex CO2RR pathway and the completive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous solution.9–12 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop electrocatalysts with both excellent activity and selectivity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2.
In general, CO, formate, methanol, ethylene, etc. can be obtained from CO2RR by using different electrocatalysts.13–16 Among these value-added products, formate (or liquid formic acid) is very attractive since it is a key feedstock for chemical products.17–19 Thanks to the features of formate such as easy storage and transport and the high volumetric hydrogen density, it is also regarded as a valuable hydrogen carrier in fuel cells. Typically, some metals, such as Pb, Hg, In and Cd, were reported as electrocatalysts to reduce CO2 to formate effectively.20–22 However, many of these heavy metals are highly toxic and/or expensive and therefore are not suitable for practical applications. Recently, environment friendly Bi-based electrocatalysts have drawn great attention due to their low cost and high selectivity for formate production. Previous studies have demonstrated that the selectivity of nanostructured Bi-based materials can reach more than 90% and the overpotential for the conversion of CO2 to formate is relatively low.14,23–27 Nevertheless, many of these Bi-based electrocatalysts suffer from a narrow potential window of high selectivity for the formation of formate and a low current density. To address these issues, several optimization strategies have been developed recently, including dimension control,28–30 defect creation,31 and hybridization of Bi-based nanostructures with conductive supports.32–35 Doping other elements in CO2RR-active electrocatalysts has been proved to be an effective means to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity.36–39 However, there are only a few reports on doping Bi-based nanostructures for CO2RR. Other alternative low-cost Sn-based catalysts possess some attractive characteristics that are suitable for CO2 electrochemical reduction, whereas Sn-based materials often suffer from unsatisfactory activity and selectivity for formate production.40–43 Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that catalysts constructed by an appropriate combination of the above-mentioned two elements can improve the activity and selectivity towards the CO2RR.37,44,45
Herein, we report the synthesis of unique Sn-doped Bi2O3 nanosheet (NS) catalysts, showing high CO2RR activity and faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate. In particular, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibited an FE of 93.4% with a current density of 24.3 mA cm−2 for formate at −0.97 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the H-cell, which is better than those of undoped Bi2O3 NSs (92.1%, 18.4 mA cm−2). In addition, 2.5% Sn doped-Bi2O3 NSs possessed a wider negative potential range (from −0.87 to −1.17 V), in which the FE of formate was over 90%. The mechanism for the enhancement in activity of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs was investigated by electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses. Finally, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs were combined with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts consisting of a commercially available dimensionally stable anode (DSA) to realize highly active CO2RR and OER simultaneously when powered by two AA-size alkaline batteries.
Results and discussion
The Bi2O3 and Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs were prepared by a solvothermal method in polyol media. As shown in Fig. S1a and S1b,† the product in the absence of the Sn precursor exhibited a sheet-like nanostructure. From the HRTEM image in Fig. S1c,† ordered lattice fringes are clearly observed for Bi2O3 NSs with a spacing of 0.276 nm, corresponding to the {200} facets of Bi2O3. The HAADF-STEM-EDX image in Fig. S1d† reveals the uniform distribution of Bi and O elements in the NSs. In addition, the XRD pattern (Fig. S2†) matches well with the standard pattern of cubic Bi2O3 (JCPDS no. 27-0052), indicating the successful synthesis of the pure Bi2O3 NSs. After doping 2.5% atomic percentage of Sn (determined by ICP-AES), the sheet-like shape is well preserved, as shown in TEM (Fig. 1a) and HAADF-STEM (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c shows the HRTEM image of an individual 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NS. The fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.274 nm can also be indexed to the {200} facets of Bi2O3. Doping Sn with a smaller atomic radius than that of Bi results in the shrinking of the lattice fringes. Moreover, the elemental distribution of Bi, Sn and O was measured by HAADF-STEM-EDX mapping analysis (Fig. 1d). As observed, the Bi, Sn and O elements are uniformly distributed throughout the NSs. In addition, the 1.2% and 3.8% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs were also generated by varying the amount of Sn precursor fed during the synthesis (Fig. S3 and S4†). The crystal structures of these Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs were characterized using the XRD technique, as shown in Fig. S2.† As can be seen, four obvious diffraction peaks can be assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of cubic Bi2O3. Upon increasing the amount of Sn, the diffraction peaks exhibit a slight shift to higher 2θ values due to the smaller radii of Sn atoms compared to Bi atoms. Furthermore, a small diffraction peak of the (110) plane of SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445) appeared when the atomic percentage of Sn reaches 3.8%. This result indicates that a small amount of SnO2 coexists in this sample.

XPS measurements are employed to analyze the valence states of Bi and Sn as well as the electron coupling between them in the Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs. The XPS spectra are calibrated with a C–C 1s peak of 284.8 eV. The survey XPS spectrum (Fig. S5†) clearly confirms the existence of Bi, Sn, and O elements in the samples. The high-resolution Bi 4f spectra (Fig. 2a) show that the two main peaks demonstrate a single oxidation state of Bi3+ for the three Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs and undoped Bi2O3 NSs,46,47 while the element Sn mainly exists as Sn4+ species in the three Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs (Fig. 2b).48 In addition, the Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs gradually shift to lower binding energies upon increasing the amount of doping Sn relative to undoped Bi2O3 NSs, as shown in Fig. 2a. On the other hand, as the amount of doping Sn increases, the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 peaks shift to higher binding energies (Fig. 2b). These results (Table S1†) clearly indicate the charge transfer between Bi and Sn, which is caused by the difference in electronegativity between them.37,45 Such electron coupling can modify the electronic structure of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, which may be beneficial to CO2RR.

The electrochemical CO2RR performances of the Sn-doped Bi2O3 catalysts were evaluated in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution within a homemade gas-tight the H-cell, which was separated by an anion exchange membrane. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of undoped Bi2O3 and Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs were measured in both CO2-saturated and Ar-saturated electrolytes. From the LSV profiles (Fig. S6†), all these catalysts present higher negative currents in the CO2-saturated electrolyte than those in the Ar-saturated counterparts at the same potentials. For example, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibited a current density (j) of 60.8 mA cm−2 in CO2-saturated electrolyte at −1.2 V versus RHE, which was 3.8 times as high as that (16.1 mA cm−2) in Ar-saturated electrolyte (Fig. S6c†). This result implies more favorable CO2RR over competitive HER on the electrocatalysts. To reasonably demonstrate the preferential CO2RR and exclude the HER contribution to the total j, constant electrolysis at various potentials was conducted on undoped Bi2O3 and Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, as shown in Fig. S7.† Gaseous and liquid products were quantitatively measured by high-performance gas chromatography and ionic chromatography, respectively. Only three products namely H2, CO and HCOOH were detected during electrolysis. The liquid product HCOOH was measured by ionic chromatography according to the standard curve (Fig. S8†). After Sn doping, the total current density (jtotal) of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs increases significantly compared with undoped Bi2O3 NSs (Fig. 3a). In addition, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibit high selectivity toward formate generation (Fig. 3b and Fig. S9†), achieving a maximum FE value of 93.4% at −0.97 V. Their FE stably remains over 90% in a wide negative potential range from −0.87 V to −1.17 V, which outperforms undoped Bi2O3 NSs, 1.2% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, 3.8% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, and many other benchmarking catalysts in the H-cell (Table S2†). Moreover, the formate FE maintains at 82.2% at a more negative potential of −1.27 V, accompanying competitive HER with H2 FE of 13.4%. While the CO FEs of the three Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs are a little higher compared with undoped Bi2O3 NSs at a low overpotential (Fig. S9 and S10†), Sn generally has a higher CO selectivity than Bi at low overpotential.40–43,49 To support this demonstration, the electrochemical CO2RR performances of pure SnO2 catalysts were tested, as shown in Fig. S11.† Apparently, SnO2 catalysts show much lower FE of formate than Bi2O3. For 3.8% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, more Sn sites were exposed on the surface than those of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs. Sn doping promotes the enhancement in the activity of Bi sites for formate production due to the synergic effect between them. But the Sn site is more active than the Bi site for side reactions such as CO and H2 production. As such, it is a volcano plot of FEs for formate with the increase in the amount of Sn in Bi2O3 NSs. We also measured the formate partial current density (jHCOO−, Fig. 3c) and formate production rate (Fig. 3d) of these four Bi2O3-based catalysts when varying the potential. Clearly, the jHCOO− values of all these catalysts show a gradual upward trend with the negative variation of the potentials. Of them, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibited the highest jHCOO− with the potential varying from −0.67 to −1.27 V. In particular, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs achieved a jHCOO− of 48.2 mA cm−2 at −1.27 V, which was about 1.7 times as high as that of undoped Bi2O3 NSs (29.0 mA cm−2). In addition, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs displayed the most rapid increase in formate production rate relative to other Bi2O3-based catalysts and achieved 0.93 mmol cm−2 h−1 at −1.27 V. The efficiency of conversion of electrical energy to the chemical energy of the target product is also an important parameter to evaluate the catalytic performance.50Fig. 3e shows the energy efficiency for formate (ΦHCOO−) of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs and undoped Bi2O3 NSs at different applied potentials. The ΦHCOO− of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exceeded 50% at potentials ranging from −0.77 to −1.17 V, which is wider than that of undoped Bi2O3 NSs (−0.87 to −1.07 V). A long-term stability test of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs was carried out at a fixed potential of −0.97 V for 8 h with the j and FE values of H2, CO and formate being monitored, as shown in Fig. 3f. The j value shows only little attenuation at the electrolysis potential and the H2, CO and formate FE is also stable during the stability test. The average FE of formate during 8 h reached ∼90.5%, suggesting that the CO2RR selectivity was well maintained during the stability test. After electrolysis, the morphology of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs is largely preserved (Fig. S12a†). The XRD pattern (Fig. S12b†) shows that some metastable Bi2O2CO3 (JCPDS no. 41-1448) was formed after electrolysis, and this phenomenon has been reported in other studies as well.33 Nevertheless, no diffraction peak associated with metallic Bi was found in the XRD pattern, which may result from the re-oxidation of the reduced Bi when exposed to the air after electrolysis. Moreover, the XPS spectra were used to determine the chemical composition and valence of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs after stability measurement (Fig. S13†). For Sn, no peak corresponding to Sn2+ was observed. The element Bi existed in trivalent ions. It is indicated that Bi2O3 can effectively maintain Sn4+, which is considered to be beneficial to the selective formation of formate.22

To elucidate the underlying reasons for the excellent CO2 reduction activity of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs toward formate production, some physical and chemical characterization studies together with DFT calculations were performed. The adsorption of CO2 on the active sites of catalysts is a prerequisite for CO2RR.51,52 As such, CO2 adsorption isotherms were conducted to evaluate the adsorption capacity of CO2 on such catalysts. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs displayed a stronger adsorption capacity (0.096 mmol g−1) than that of Bi2O3 (0.061 mmol g−1), which can accelerate the activation and subsequent reduction of CO2. As one of the most important factors that determine CO2RR activity, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of these catalysts was measured (Fig. S14†). As plotted in Fig. 4b, Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibited a larger slope (1.69 mF cm−2 for 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, 1.57 mF cm−2 for 1.2% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs and 1.58 mF cm−2 for 3.8% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs) than that of undoped Bi2O3 NSs (1.34 mF cm−2). This result indicates that doping Sn in Bi2O3 NSs can offer more active sites to facilitate CO2RR. Furthermore, we normalized the jHCOO− of these samples based on the value of Cdl (Fig. S15a†). The normalized jHCOO− of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs was larger than that of undoped Bi2O3 NSs at all applied potentials. This result implied the better intrinsically catalytic activity of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs for CO2 reduction. Meanwhile, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs also exhibited higher mass activities than undoped Bi2O3 NSs as shown in Fig. S15b.† The charge transfer process was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Nyquist plots and the corresponding data fitted through the equivalent circuit diagram are depicted in Fig. S16 and Table S3.† The charge transfer resistance (Rct, 2.52 Ω) of 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs was smaller than that (4.48 Ω) of undoped Bi2O3 NSs. Accordingly, doping Sn exhibited a faster faradaic process toward CO2 electroreduction and the hydrated CO2 molecules received electrons more easily to form the CO2− intermediate.32

The reaction kinetics mechanism of CO2RR to formate was examined through Tafel plots (overpotentials η vs. logjHCOO−), as shown in Fig. 4c. Clearly, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibited a lower Tafel slope of 109 mV dec−1 than that of undoped Bi2O3 NSs (122 mV dec−1), suggesting the improvement of kinetic activity for electrocatalytic reduction CO2 to formate over Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs. The Tafel slopes for all Bi2O3-based catalysts are close to the theoretical value of 120 mV dec−1, indicating that the first electron transfer process is the rate-determining step (RDS).32,53–55 Based on these results, we can speculate the formation of the OCHO* intermediate through the proton-coupled one-electron transfer process and its adsorption strength on the surface of catalysts is critical for CO2RR. To identify the formation mechanism of formate as well as the origin of enhanced CO2RR activity of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, DFT calculations were employed (see the ESI† for the details). Fig. S17† shows the corresponding simulation models of undoped Bi2O3 and Sn-doped Bi2O3. The calculated free energy diagrams for the conversion of CO2 to OCHO* and eventual HCOOH over the undoped Bi2O3 and Sn-doped Bi2O3 are shown in Fig. 4d, including the conversion on the Bi-site and the Sn-site. Clearly, both undoped Bi2O3 and Sn-doped Bi2O3 show the largest energy barrier (EG) for OCHO* formation, implying that the initial proton-coupled electron transfer is the RDS. Interestingly, Sn doping can decrease the EG for OCHO* formation from 1.45 eV (on Bi-site of Bi2O3) to 1.09 eV (on Sn-site of Sn-doped Bi2O3) and even 0.49 eV (on Bi-site of Sn-doped Bi2O3). As such, it is much easier to form the OCHO* intermediate on the surface of Sn-doped Bi2O3 compared to undoped Bi2O3. In addition, the adsorption energy of OCHO* on the surface of these catalysts was calculated. From Fig. 4e, a more negative adsorption energy of OCHO* was found for the Sn-site and the Bi-site on Sn-doped Bi2O3 relative to Bi-site on undoped Bi2O3. This result suggests that OCHO* is energetically favorable to adsorb on the surface of Sn-doped Bi2O3 than undoped Bi2O3. As such, the incorporation of Sn can efficiently stabilize the adsorption of OCHO* on the catalysts. This demonstration was further confirmed by the p-projected density of states (pDOS) analysis, as shown in Fig. 4f. After OCHO* adsorption, the highest peak of total DOS (Ep) for Sn-doped Bi2O3 is much closer to the Fermi level (Ef) than undoped Bi2O3, indicating a higher binding strength of Sn-doped Bi2O3 to OCHO*. The total DOS centers of Bi site and Sn site in Sn-doped Bi2O3 move up. Such an up-shift in Sn-doped Bi2O3 demonstrates the decrease in the bonding states and increase in the anti-bonding states, leading to its higher binding strength to OCHO*.51,56,57 Taken together, the origin of improved activity in Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs can be attributed to the enhancement in the adsorption capacity of the OCHO* intermediate on catalysts due to the strong synergistic effect between Sn and Bi.
Encouraged by the excellent CO2RR performance of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, we pursued a two-electrode full-cell device that employed 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs supported on carbon paper as the cathode for CO2RR and a commercial DSA as the anode for the OER to explore practical applications. The commercial DSA used here consists of a thin IrO2 layer coated on Ta-coated-Ti foil. This catalyst has been widely employed for the industrial OER because of its high activity and strong corrosion resistance. The OER activity of IrO2 is first evaluated separately using a three-electrode setup. The OER polarization curve is shown in Fig. 5a. Clearly, the anodic current density is observed to dramatically accelerate at ∼1.5 V and reach 10 mA cm−2 at ∼1.7 V in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte. After constructing the full cells with 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs, their corresponding polarization curve was displayed in Fig. 5b. The CO2RR-OER couple became active under the external voltage of ∼2.1 V and delivered a current density of 7.7 mA cm−2 at 3 V. In addition, two AA-size alkaline batteries were used (with an open circuit voltage of ∼3.2 V) to drive the full cell device through CO2RR-OER electrolysis (Fig. 5c). As shown in Fig. 5d, the current density started at ∼10.2 mA cm−2, presented a slow decay during 5 h, and reached ∼8.9 mA cm−2 eventually, with a loss of ∼13%. The FEs for H2 and CO have no significant change during the full-cell electrolysis test for 5 h and the average formate FE reaches ∼76.1%. The FE value is not satisfactory enough because the actual working potential of the Sn-doped Bi2O3 electrode is not in the appropriate potential window. It should be pointed out that the working current density here was superior to that of early reported catalysts,14,58 suggesting the practical feasibility for driving the CO2RR-OER device by using an external power source.

Conclusions 
In summary, we developed a simple solvothermal approach for the synthesis of Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs with different atomic percentages of Sn (1.2, 2.5 and 3.8%). When evaluated as electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate, the 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs exhibited the highest formate FE of 93.4% with a current density of 24.3 mA cm−2 at −0.97 V. In addition, such formate FE is stable at over 90% in a wide potential range from −0.87 V to −1.17 V. Electrochemical and DFT analyses revealed that Sn doping facilitates the adsorption of an OCHO* intermediate on electrocatalysts due to the synergistic effect between Sn and Bi, thereby boosting the activity for the CO2RR. Finally, 2.5% Sn-doped Bi2O3 NSs were combined with a DSA to realize a battery-driven full cell with decent activity and efficiency through CO2RR-OER electrocatalysis. Our study opens up an attractive avenue to design advanced metal oxide electrocatalysts for highly efficient CO2RR to high-value fuels.
