    , Accepted 24th November 2010First published on 24th January 2011AbstractWe report on the synthesis of visible-light-response iodine-doped TiO2 nanocrystals (I-TNCs), and their implementation as photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The preparation of I-TNCs starts with hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide in iodine-based aqueous system, followed by hydrothermal treatment and annealing process to achieve anatase structure. The I-TNCs were characterized by TEM, SEM, XRD, EDS and XPS. Under an optimized I/Ti doping ratio of 20 mol%, the photovoltaic performance of the cell based on I-TNCs is significantly better, with an energy-conversion efficiency of 7.0% under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which is 42.9% higher than that of the cell based on undoped TNCs. Interestingly, the I-TNCs-based cell shows a higher conversion efficiency of 10.0% under 30 mW cm−2 illumination. The improved performance is explained by the expanded visible-light harvesting (characterized by incident photon to current conversion efficiency and UV-vis absorption spectra), lowered recombination resistance (characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Rrec) together with prolonged electron lifetime τe. These results suggest substantial potential of TiO2 nanocrystals with controlled doping in DSSC application.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted particular attention as low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon-based photovoltaic devices.1–3 One of the key elements in DSSCs is the semiconductor photoanode, which transfers the electrons from the dye molecules to the transparent conducting substrate and concurrently allows the electrolytes to diffuse to the anchored dyes.4,5 For an efficient DSSC, the porous electrode composed of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals (10–20 nm in diameter) is essential due to the high internal surface area which maximizes the uptake of dye molecules, thereby increasing the cell performance.6,7 However, such TiO2 nanocrystalline films usually show poor light harvesting due to the shortage of optical elements in the electrode films. One way to successfully enhance photocapture efficiency and optical absorption of the photoelectrode films is the introduction of highly scattering layers.8–12 Many research groups have succeeded in improving the photon-to-current conversion efficiency of TiO2-based DSSCs by light-scatterer.10–12 As examples, Qiu et al.13 reported double-layered photoanodes from variable-size anatase TiO2 nanospindles that not only provide high specific surface area, but also exhibit stronger aggregation-induced light scattering in the visible wavelength of the solar spectrum. Recently, our group also developed a new bilayer-structured film with TiO2 nanocrystals as the underlayer and TiO2 nanotubes as the overlayer exhibiting an overall energy-conversion efficiency of 44.7% higher than that formed by pure nanocrystalline TiO2.14 Additionally, the enhanced visible absorption and photocurrent generation can also be achieved by doping nonmetal elements in TiO2 nanostructures.15–24 For instance, Ma and coworkers20 reported that a nitrogen-doped nanocrystalline TiO2 film as a favorable electron-transfer mediator in photovoltaic devices exhibited improved incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and great stability due to the replacement of oxygen-deficient TiO2 by visible-light-active nitrogen-doped TiO2, which was further testified by other research groups.21–24 Indeed, iodine has been demonstrated to be promising for n-type doping and iodine-doped (I-doped) TiO2 has been shown to be effective in narrowing TiO2 band gap subjected to absorbing visible light of the solar spectrum in recent years.25–28 More importantly, the recombination of electron-hole pairs could be sufficiently inhibited because the doping iodine sites can act as trapping sites to capture the photo-generated electrons. Furthermore, the trapped holes generated in I-doped TiO2 were evidenced to have no significant oxidation reactivity toward substrates adsorbed on the TiO2 surface.29–31 All the features above of I-doped TiO2 can be considered as favorable influencing factors for improving overall energy-conversion efficiency of TiO2-based DSSCs. However, to date, I-doped TiO2 nanomaterials for DSSCs have yet to be reported.
In this paper, a new visible-light-response I-doped TiO2 photoanode was fabricated through the packing of nanocrystal particles that were prepared via a combination of sol–gel process and hydrothermal treatment using iodic acid as doping source. It was observed that as-prepared I-doped TiO2 nanocrystals (I-TNCs) exhibited strong absorption in the 400–550 nm range with a red shift in the band gap transition. In the I-doped TiO2 film, nanocrystal particles offered a large internal surface area for sufficient dye-adsorption; on the other hand, the introduction of iodine in the TiO2 matrix was able to promote the light-harvesting efficiency as well as the overall energy-conversion efficiency of the cells. By fabricating the I-doped TiO2 photoanode with a low volatile 3-methoxypropionitrile-based electrolyte in the DSSC, we achieved conversion efficiencies of 7.0% and 10.0% under 100 and 30 mW cm−2 illumination, respectively. The mechanism behind the improvement caused by I-doping was also discussed.
Experimental
Materials
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP), anhydrous lithium iodide (LiI), iodide (I2), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 3-methoxypropionitrile, polyethylene glycol M-20000 (PEG20000) and chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) were received from Sigma. cis-Di(thiocyanate)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II) (N3) was obtained from Solaronix (Aubonne, Switzerland). Iodic acid (HIO3), acetic acid (HAc), nitric acid (HNO3), ethanol (C2H5OH), and all other chemicals used in this study were purchased from commercial sources of analytical grade and used without further purification. Milli-pore water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was used throughout the study.
Preparation and characterization of I-TNCs
As an example, 20 mol% I-TNCs (I/Ti molar ratio of 20%) were obtained as follows: 70 mmol HAc was dropwise added into 75 mmol TTIP under stirring for 15 min. Then the modified titanic precursor was poured into distilled water containing HIO3 (15 mmol) with vigorous stirring. The obtained suspension was stirred for 1 h, followed by heating from room temperature to 75 °C at a rate of 1 °C min−1 and peptizing for 75 min. After that, the suspension was transferred into Teflon-lined autoclave for thermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h. The resultant I-TNCs colloids were dispersed with an ultrasonic titanium probe at a frequency of 15 pulses per s, and then centrifuged and washed with ethanol for several times. Finally, the obtained products were calcined at 500 °C for further characterizations. In parallel, other samples with different I-doping ratios (I/Ti molar ratio of 0, 10%, 30%) were also synthesized by following the same procedure as mentioned above.
The morphology of the synthesized I-TNCs was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images characterized on a JEOL JEM-3010 microscope. The surface area was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method recorded on an ASAP 2010 surface area analyzer. The crystalline structures of the sintered samples were identified using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (X′Pert PRO MPD, Panalytical). The optical properties of I-TNCs were studied by the adsorption spectra detected using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV 2501 spectrometer, Shimadzu). The chemical composition of doped TNCs samples was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) performed on a Thermo ESCALAB250 XPS system using Al Kα as X-ray source.
Preparation and characterization of I-TNCs electrode films
The I-TNCs paste was obtained by dispersing 0.8 g PEG 20000 in 2 ml I-TNCs colloids by means of sufficient grinding. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (Hartford, 14 Ω/sq, 80% transmittance) used as the substrates were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in acetone, ethanol, water, and pretreated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. The paste was then coated on the FTO glass by a typical doctor-blade technique and dried at room temperature. Finally, the I-TNCs electrode films were gradually heated under a programmed annealing process, i.e. at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and at 500 °C for 15 min. The surface morphology of I-TNCs films were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images characterized on a Hitachi S-4700 microscope.
Dye adsorption of I-TNCs electrode films
After thermal treatment with the programmed annealing process, the I-TNCs electrode films were cooled to 80 °C and immersed in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the ruthenium complex cis-[RuL2(NCS)2] (commercially called N3 dye) for 24 h at room temperature. Then the sensitized films were rinsed with ethanol and dried at room temperature. In order to examine the loading amount of the dye in I-TNCs electrode, the dye was desorbed from I-TNCs electrode into a 1.0 M NaOH solution in water–ethanol (50:50, v/v). The absorption spectrum of the desorbed-dye solution was detected using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV 2501 spectrometer, Shimadzu).32,33
Cell assembly and photoelectrochemical measurements
The counter electrodes were prepared by depositing a platinum thin film on the FTO glass using an H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg Pt in 1 ml isopropanol), followed by annealing at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye-adsorbed I-TNCs electrode and the Pt electrode were assembled into a sandwich cell by heating at 80 °C using a thermal adhesive film (Surlyn, 25 μm) as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of an electrolyte solution (0.1 M LiI, 0.12 M I2, 1.0 M DMPII and 0.5 M TBP in 3-methoxypropionitrile) was infiltrated into the cell. The effective area of the cell exposed in light was 0.25 cm2 (∼0.5 cm × 0.5 cm).
The photocurrent-voltage characteristics and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSSCs were recorded by a electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, ShangHai) under one sun condition using a solar light simulator (Oriel 69911 1000 W xenon lamp, AM 1.5) with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range was explored from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz. The applied bias voltage and ac amplitude were set at open-circuit voltage of the DSSCs and 10 mV between the FTO-Pt counter electrode and the FTO-TiO2-dye working electrode, respectively. The impedance spectra were analyzed by an equivalent circuit model for interpreting the characteristics of the DSSCs. The incident photo to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm on a Keithley model 2000 SourceMeter under short circuit conditions using a tungsten source.
Results and discussion
The morphology and structure of I-TNCs

Fig. 1 shows TEM and HR-TEM bright field images of 20 mol% I-TNCs. It can be seen that as-synthesized I-TNCs have a uniform spherical structure with an average diameter of ∼15 nm (Fig. 1a). HRTEM analysis (Fig. 1b) reveals that a tiny nanocrystal particle is single-crystal structure. The lattice fringe of d = 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane, can be assigned to the most stable anatase phase with a lower surface energy according to the calculation by Oliver et al.34 For comparison, undoped TNCs as well as 10 mol% I-TNCs and 30 mol% I-TNCs were also synthesized by following the same procedure as 20 mol% I-TNCs, and it was found that all these particles maintained analogous structure and morphology (not shown here).

Structural characterization of the TiO2 powders was performed by XRD measurements. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the undoped and I-doped TNCs with various doping contents. All diffraction peaks of as-prepared powders after annealing at 500 °C exhibit good agreement with anatase reference data (JCPDS 21-1272) (Fig. 2a), indicating that the anatase nanocrystalline structure is retained after doping. The average crystallite size calculated from the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (101) peak based on the Scherrer's formula (d = 0.9λ/β1/2cosθ) is within a narrow range of 13–16 nm, and it is shown to be well consistent with the TEM image shown in Fig. 1a. Note that shift of the characteristic (101) peaks is observed (Fig. 2b). With increasing the contents of iodine doped in TiO2 nanocrystals the peak with the index of (101) gradually shifted negatively from 25.45° to 25.22°, indicating that the interplanar spacing between parallel crystallographic planes in the anatase structure expanded after I-doping.35 By knowing that the ionic radii of I5+ (0.095 nm) is larger than that of Ti4+ (0.060 nm), it is reasonably deduced that iodine should be incorporated into the crystal structure.36,37 Such a diffraction peak shift has also been observed in other doping systems such as Nd-doped TiO2 nanoparticles or Cl-doped ZnO nanowire arrays.38,39 The physical parameters of all prepared samples including crystal structure, crystallite size and BET surface areas are summarized in Table 1.

To further investigate the chemical states of iodine and the possible changes on the binding energies of Ti and O after I-doping, we conducted the measurements of I 3d, Ti 2p and O 1s core levels using the XPS technique. Fig. 3a shows a typical XPS survey spectrum of 20 mol% I-TNCs containing Ti, O and I elements. There are doublet peaks of I 3d observed at the binding energy around 619.8 and 624.0 eV (Fig. 3b). According to recent published papers,29,40–42 the peak of I 3d5/2 at 624.0 eV, close to HIO3 (623 eV), can be attributed to I5+ allowing replacing Ti4+ in TiO2 matrix. The other peak detected at 619.8 eV may be originated from I− species, in agreement with the results reported by Su et al.26 Furthermore, one can see that the intensity of I 3d5/2 peak at 624 eV is much weaker than the peak at 619.8 eV, which could be understood by the reduced concentration of I5+ on the surface of TiO2 due to substitutional I5+ in TiO2 lattice.25,27,40 Besides, that the I 3d5/2 peak of I5+ decreased with a significant increase in the peaks of I− during the whole XPS measurement was also observed by Tojo et al.,29 in which the doped I5+ was proposed to be as an electron acceptor to produce measurable I− species. Additionally, the high resolution XPS peaks for Ti 2p (Fig. 3c) and for O 1s (Fig. 3d) also exhibit obvious changes after I-doping. Compared with the binding energies of undoped TNCs (458.9 eV for Ti 2p and 530.3 eV for O 1s), the binding energies of I-TNCs shifted toward lower values (458.5 eV for Ti 2p and 529.8 eV for O 1s), corresponding to the reduction of 0.4 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively. The low energy shifts of Ti and O binding energies after I-doping, together with the low angle shift of (101) peak in XRD pattern, synergistically provide favorable evidence for the successful incorporation of iodine into the TiO2 matrix.23,24,29

Note: The actual percentage of iodine in the doped TiO2 samples obtained by XPS is estimated to be ca. 6 mol% for I/Ti doping ratio corresponding to experimentally controlled ratio of 20 mol%. 
The morphology and optical properties of I-TNCs films
The monolayer I-TNCs films were formed using the doctor-blade method onto FTO a substrate and subsequently followed by thermal treatment. A cross-sectional SEM image provides a direct observation on the fabricated film thickness (see Fig. 4a). In this work, the thickness of all films was experimentally controlled to be identical to ∼7 μm. A typical electrode film fabricated by 20 mol% I-TNCs as shown in Fig. 4b exhibits smooth and homogeneous surface morphology without cracks and big agglomerates, facilitating electron transport between neighbouring nanoparticles.43 Accordingly, we also obtained undoped TNCs film as well as 10 mol% and 30 mol% I-TNCs films with similar surface morphology and texture framework compared with 20 mol% I-TNCs film. (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†).

The optical properties of undoped and doped TNCs films were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectra. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, pure TNCs sample shows the characteristic spectrum with the fundamental absorbance stopping edge at ∼380 nm. With increasing the iodine contents, I-doped samples exhibit a noticeable expanded response in the visible light region from 400 to 550 nm; concomitantly, the color of pure and I-doped TNCs films changes from colorless (transparent) to yellow brown (see the inset of Fig. 5a). The visible light response is more likely to be due to I-doping in the TiO2 crystal structure inducing a new state lying close to the valence band edge.26,44,45 To further gain insight into the absorption red-shift of materials originated from I-doping, the band gap energies (Eg) of samples were estimated by plotting square of absorbance coefficient (α2) versus photon energy (hν) (see Fig. 5b).46 The photon energy can be calculated from the transformation of absorption wavelength using the following equation:  
 Fig. 5  (a) Optical absorption spectra of undoped and I-doped TNCs with different doping ratios. The inset shows the color change after iodine doping. (b) Plots of the square of absorbance coefficient (α2) versus photon energy (hν). Band gap values are determined from the extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption band to the photon energy abscissa. 
Extrapolation of the linear portion of the absorption band to hν axis at zero absorption value yields the band gap energies associated with light harvesting efficiency, and the results of Eg are listed in Table 1. As expected, for pure anatase TNCs its band gap is ∼3.2 eV, which is consistent with the very poor visible light absorbance ability (see Fig. 5a). I-TNCs samples show an obvious band gap narrowing ranging from ∼2.9 to 2.2 eV accompanied with the increase of iodine ratios from 10 mol% to 30 mol%, which explains the excellent visible light absorbance ability they demonstrate.
The photovoltaic performance of I-TNCs-based DSSCs
Solar cells consisting of undoped TNCs as well as a series of I-TNCs (10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%) films were tested under the AM 1.5 simulated sunlight with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 6 displays the photocurrent density-voltage (I–V) curves of the cells and the performance characteristics including short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (ff) and efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. For undoped TNCs cell, the JSC of 10.9 mA cm−2, VOC of 672 mV, ff of 0.67 and η of 4.9% were achieved. After introducing iodine into TNCs, the JSC of I-TNCs-based cells increases markedly, with 12.5 mA cm−2 for 10 mol% I-TNCs-based cell and 14.1 mA cm−2 for 20 mol% I-TNCs-based cell, respectively. Afterwards, upon continuing increasing the doping ratio up to 30 mol%, the JSC value shows an obvious decrease to 10.3 mA cm−2, in which the excess amounts of dopants in electrode films could be considered as recombination centers to inhibit the efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs.38,47 Besides, the Voc of all the I-TNCs-based cells is slightly higher than that of undoped one, reaching up maximum to 715 mV at the doping ratio of 20 mol%. In a typical n-type doping system based on identical electrolyte, the Voc enhancement is assumed to be arisen from the increase of the electron concentration and upward shift of the Fermi level.48,49 Hence, under our current experimental conditions the highest η of 7.0% was achieved for a 20 mol% I-TNCs-based DSSC, corresponding to a 42.9% increment of the undoped one.

The photoactive wavelength regime for the undoped and I-doped TNCs cells was studied by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (Fig. 7). The IPCE spectra were observed to follow a similar trend to I–V curves described above (see Fig. 6). Specifically, with increasing I-doping ratio, the maximum efficiency contributed by the N3 dye absorption at the approximately 520 nm first increases gradually from 45% for undoped cell to 54% for 10 mol% I-TNCs-based cell and 60% for 20 mol% I-TNCs-based cell, and then decreases to 43% for 30 mol% I-TNCs-based cell. Note that 10 mol% and 20 mol% I-TNCs-based cells both exhibit better photoelectrical response over the entire wavelength region of 400–800 nm, matched well with their enhanced JSC and η. It should also be pointed out that the enhance IPCE in the range of 400–550 nm could be considerably ascribed to the photoresponse of I-doped TiO2 in the visible light region.20 To clarify the contribution to the increase in IPCE, the amounts of dye absorbed on all four electrode films were measured and the data are presented in Table 2. One can see that the adsorbed amount of dye on all films maintains almost unchanged before and after iodine doping, which is also coincided very well with their analogous surface area data (see Table 1). In this case, the influence of dye uptake on IPCE could be neglected and the increases in JSC and IPCE can be reasonably inferred to be arising from the intrinsic component of the films as well as the enhanced light-harvesting efficiency and the electron transfer process of the cells.15–24,50,51 Detailed explanation for the enhancement of photovoltaic performance of I-TNCs-based cells will be further discussed below.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on undoped and I-doped (10 mol%, 20 mol% and 30 mol%) TNCs. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was used to investigate the recombination resistance and the electron lifetime of DSSCs. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist and Bode phase plots of the DSSCs based on undoped and I-doped TNCs. In general, two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots (see Fig. 8a). The small semicircle in the high-frequency region (>1 kHz) represents the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the Pt/electrolyte interface, and the other large semicircle in the low-frequency region (100–1 Hz) is assigned to the accumulation/transport of the injected electrons within TiO2 film and the electron transfer across the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.52,53 The large one dominates the impedance of the DSSC and is recognized as the characteristic shape of recombination through the TiO2 electrode.54,55 It is worth noting that the charge transport resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface just shows an opposite trend to I–V curves (Fig. 6) and IPCE spectra (Fig. 7a). This implies that among our four types of cells, 20 mol% I-TNCs-based cell possesses the lowest recombination resistance and hence more effective electrons could be captured. Correspondingly, the Bode phase plots of EIS spectra, as shown in Fig. 8b, display the characteristic frequency peaks of the charge transfer process for all cells. The lifetime of electrons (τe) in TiO2 film can be related to as the inverse of the characteristic frequency and estimated by the equation: τe = 1/ωmax = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the low-frequency peak.52,53,56,57 The calculated τe values show an increased trend in a sequence of 20 mol% I-TNCs-based cell (14.2 ms) > 10 mol% I-TNCs-based cell (12.5 ms) > pure TNCs-based cell (9.1 ms) > 30 mol% I-TNCs-based cell (7.1 ms). Obviously, the 20 mol% I-TNCs-based cell has the lowest recombination resistance and the longest electron lifetime, which could favor the electron transport through a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance, and finally leading to enhanced photoconversion efficiency.

As a supplement, the dependence of the performance characteristics on light intensity for the optimized cell, viz. 20 mol% I-TNCs-based cell, was also studied (see Fig. 9). Under standard global AM 1.5 solar condition, the cell shows an overall efficiency of 7.0%. Interestingly, under lower light intensity, 30 mW cm−2 and 10 mW cm−2, the cell exhibits better photovoltaic performance, with efficiencies of 10.0% and 8.2%, respectively. This implies that the fabricated DSSCs could work well even under weak light intensity.

Conclusions
Visible-light-response I-doped TiO2 nanocrystals with various molar ratios of I/Ti synthesized via a combination of sol–gel process and hydrothermal treatment have successfully been applied as photoanodes in DSSCs. The doped materials were confirmed to possess huge internal surface area for adequate dye-adsorption as well as improved light absorption and light harness. The photovoltaic measurement results showed that the cell with an optimizing I-doping ratio of 20 mol% gave conversion efficiencies of 7.0% and 10.0%, under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) and 30 mW cm−2 illumination, respectively. The improved performance could be explained by effective harvesting of sunlight, reduced electron-hole recombination process and prolonged electron lifetime. It is anticipated that the visible-light-response doping material can be extended to other nonmetal-doped semiconductors for high efficient DSSCs.
