, Accepted 11th September 2014First published on 11th September 2014AbstractWe report on the architecture of tandem dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with a back-contact bottom electrode without a transparent conductive oxide layer (TCO-less tandem DSSCs). The bottom electrode consists of glass/stained porous TiO2/back-contact porous metal. As the structure has fewer TCO layers than simple mechanical stack tandem DSSCs, more light reaches the bottom electrode. Two model dyes (D131 and N719) were used to confirm the tandem performance of the cells. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) was the sum of the Voc of the top cell and the Voc of the TCO-less bottom cell, showing that the cell worked as a tandem cell. The power conversion efficiency of the TCO-less tandem DSSC (7.10%) was greater than that of the stack tandem DSSCs (6.28%).
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among the most promising of the third-generation photovoltaic devices as a result of their eco-friendly properties and the low cost of fabrication.1–4 Mathew et al.5 have reported an efficiency of 13% using DSSCs, however, further improvements in DSSC efficiency are needed. Enhanced light harvesting from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) region has been reported using a panchromatic sensitizer. Mixing different sensitizers that absorb light in different regions of the solar spectrum seems to be a promising approach, but the photoconversion efficiency is not much improved.6–9 Another method of enhancing the region of absorption is to use a tandem structure, where two cells are connected in series.10–13 In tandem DSSCs (T-DSSCs), the top cell uses a shorter wavelength region of the incoming light and the bottom cell harvests light from longer wavelengths. By matching the photocurrent density of the top and bottom cells, the sum of the open-circuit voltage (Voc,top + Voc,bottom) of the top (Voc,top) and bottom (Voc,bottom) cells is obtained. Almost all the T-DSSCs reported to date14–16 have mechanically stacked structures. In these cells, light reaching the bottom electrode has to pass through at least three transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers, during which losses in photon harvesting occur.
T-DSSCs with layers of TCO-glass/porous TiO2/dye 1/electrolyte/dye 2/electrolyte/porous NiO/TCO-glass have been reported, where photons reaching the bottom electrode pass through only one TCO-glass substrate.17,18 This provides a simple T-DSSC structure, however, the increase in Voc is limited to about 0.1 V, which is because of the energy level difference between the I3−/I− redox potential and the NiO valence band. DSSCs with a back-contact electrode structure without a TCO layer (TCO-less DSSCs) have been reported.19,20 The TCO-less DSSC consist of the following layers: glass substrate/TiO2–dye/porous metal layer/electrolyte/counter electrode. The expected advantage of these TCO-less DSSC is more efficient light harvesting properties because the light can be harvested directly without passing through layers of TCO. It has been reported that the TCO-less back-contact DSSCs have almost the same performance as TCO-based DSSCs.19 By using this TCO-less structure in the bottom electrode, the number of TCO layers can be reduced and the light harvesting properties of the bottom electrode improved. Fibre-type TCO-less cylindrical tandem DSSCs using a TCO-less structure have been reported previously.21
We have also reported on the development of flat T-DSSCs using a back-contact structure, in which photons pass through only one TCO substrate before reaching the bottom electrode. The cell structure consists of layers of TCO-glass/TiO2–dye (top electrode)/electrolyte/transparent Pt/compact TiO2/porous TiO2 layer–dye (bottom electrode)/electrolyte/counter electrode. We were able to observe a slightly higher Voc than that obtained with the corresponding single cell, however, the increase in Voc was limited as a result of electrolyte diffusion (leakage) between the top and bottom electrodes through pin-holes in the compact layer fabricated in the bottom electrode.22 We report here TCO-less T-DSSCs. These T-DSSCs have an architecture in which the bottom cell electrode has a TCO-less back-contact structure. These novel TCO-less T-DSSC structures are capable of reducing the absorption loss of IR illumination by using semi-transparent Pt-sputtered fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as an intermediate layer between the top and bottom cells. This is possible because the number of TCO layers can be reduced from two to one for simply stacked tandem cells.
2. Experimental
All materials used in this investigation were commercially available and used without further purification. To fabricate the T-DSSCs by mechanically stacking the top and bottom cells, the corresponding photoanodes were sensitized with indoline D131 (Mitsubishi Paper Mills, Japan) and the ruthenium dye di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium (II) (N719, Solaronix SA), respectively. Nanoporous transparent TiO2 paste (HT/SP, Solaronix, SA) and a semi-transparent paste (D/SP, Solaronix, SA) were used to fabricate the top and bottom photoanodes, respectively. These two dyes were selected for the sensitization of the top and bottom electrodes as a result of their complementary light absorption properties. The chemical structures of the dyes and their electronic absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1. The TCO-less photoanode was fabricated using a flexible stainless-steel mesh (SUS-730, Asada Mesh Co. Ltd, Japan) with a wire diameter of 13 μm and a spacing between the wires of 16 μm. A hot melt polymer film (Himilan®, Mitsui-DuPont Polychemicals, Japan) of 30 μm thickness was used as the spacer. All the electrolytes and solvents were of reagent grade and used without further purification. The thickness of the nanoporous TiO2 layer coated on the F-doped SnO2 glass (FTO glass) was measured using a Dektak 6M Stylus Profiler.

2.1 Fabrication of TCO-based T-DSSC with four FTO plates (conventional mechanical tandem) as the reference cell
TCO-based T-DSSCs (reference cells) consisting of four TCO plates (conventional mechanical tandem) were prepared in the following device configuration: FTO glass/TiO2/dye A/electrolyte/semi-transparent Pt–FTO glass/FTO glass/TiO2/dye B/electrolyte/Pt–FTO glass, as shown schematically in Fig. 2. The FTO glasses were cleaned sequentially with distilled water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and distilled water and were subjected to UV-ozone treatment to remove organic impurities and to make the surface hydrophilic. The mesoporous TiO2 layer of the bottom electrode was prepared by coating the electrode with TiO2 D/SP paste followed by baking at 450 °C for 30 min. The sample was immersed in a 0.3 mM solution of N719 dye in acetonitrile:tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 v/v) for 48 h at room temperature. The porous TiO2 layer for the top electrode was prepared by coating the electrode with TiO2 HT/SP paste followed by baking at 450 °C for 30 min. The sample was immersed in a 0.5 mM solution of D131 in acetonitrile:tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 v/v) for 4 h at room temperature for dye adsorption. For the counter electrode in the top cell, a semi-transparent catalytic Pt layer was deposited on an FTO glass via sputtering (CFS-4EP-LL, Shibaura Mechatronics, Japan). The top cell was then assembled using the D131-sensitized FTO-based photoanode, the semi-transparent Pt-coated FTO and the Himilan® film spacer, followed by insertion of the electrolyte. The bottom cell was prepared by a similar process except that the N719 dye was used instead of the D131 dye. The T-DSSC was then fabricated by mechanically stacking the top cell bearing the D131-sensitized photoanode on the bottom cell. The electrolyte used in both cells consisted of I2 (50 mM), LiI (500 mM), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (580 mM) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (600 mM) in dehydrated acetonitrile.

2.2 Fabrication of TCO-less T-DSSC with three FTO plates
In this device architecture, one of the FTO glasses in the bottom electrode was replaced by the flexible metal mesh based TCO-less photoanode. This reduces by one the number of TCO plates commonly used in standard mechanically stacked TCO-based DSSC. The TCO-less T-DSSC fabricated in this work consists of FTO glass/TiO2–D131/electrolyte/transparent Pt–FTO glass/N719–TiO2/metal mesh/electrolyte/Pt–FTO glass, as shown schematically in Fig. 3. The flexible and porous metal mesh used to fabricate the TCO-less photoanode not only serves the purpose of supporting the nanoporous TiO2 layer, but also functions as the back-contact current-collecting grid. The top TCO-based cell sensitized with the D131 dye was prepared in a similar manner to that described in the preceding section. To prepare the TCO-less bottom electrode, a porous TiO2 paste (D/SP) was screen-printed on to a Ti (240 nm)-sputtered stainless-steel mesh (SUS-730) followed by baking at 450 °C for 30 min. This porous mesh coated with nanoporous TiO2 was immersed in a bath of N719 dye for 48 h for dye absorption. After dye absorption, the samples were washed with a similar solvent to remove any residual unabsorbed dyes. The bottom cell was prepared by assembling TiO2-coated Ti/SUS mesh stained with N719 dye and Pt-sputtered FTO glass. To avoid a short circuit and to fill the space with electrolyte, porous polytetrafluoroethylene film with a thickness of 35 μm (H010A293D, 0.1 μm pore size, Advantec) was placed in between the metal mesh sheet and the Pt/FTO counter electrode. After the insertion of the electrolyte, both the bottom and top cells were finally sealed with epoxy resin. The TCO-less T-DSSC was then finally fabricated by assembling the TCO-based top electrode sensitized with D131 dye and the TCO-less bottom cell sensitized with N719 dye.

2.3 Fabrication of TCO-less tandem DSSC with two FTO plates
To reduce the TCO component further in the T-DSSCs, an effort was made to remove both of the FTO layers in the bottom cell by implementing a new TCO-less device architecture. In this approach, the Pt-coated FTO counter electrode was replaced by a Pt-coated flexible Ti metal foil. TCO-less T-DSSCs without TCO glasses in the bottom cell were fabricated with the following device architecture: FTO glass/TiO2–D131/electrolyte/transparent Pt–FTO glass/N719–TiO2–metal mesh/electrolyte/Pt–Ti foil, as shown schematically in Fig. 4. The basic fabrication process for individual TCO-based top electrode sensitized with D131 and TCO-less N719 sensitized bottom electrode was similar to that discussed earlier. The only difference in the TCO-less bottom electrode is the replacement of the Pt-coated FTO counter electrode with Pt-sputtered Ti foil as the counter electrode. The thickness of the sputtered catalytic Pt layer on the Pt foil was 60 nm.

2.4 Photovoltaic characterization
The photovoltaic performances were measured with a solar simulator (CEP-2000 Bunko Keiki Co. Ltd, Japan) equipped with a xenon lamp (Bunko Keiki BSO-X150LC) for light illumination. The spectrum of the solar simulator and its power were adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 at AM 1.5 using a spectroradiometer (LS-100, Eiko Seiki, Japan). The power of the irradiated light on the solar cells was confirmed and corrected by a standard amorphous silicon photodetector (Bunko Keiki BS-520 S/N 353) with a similar light sensitivity to the DSSCs. The photovoltaic parameters were measured with a 0.2025 cm2 mask on the TiO2-coated substrate. The photocurrent action spectra of the devices were also measured with a constant photon flux of 1 × 1016 photons per cm2 at each wavelength in the DC mode using a photo-action spectrum measurement system connected to the solar simulator (CEP-2000, Bunko Keiki, Japan).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Working principle of the TCO-less T-DSSC with three TCO substrates
Conventional T-DSSCs consist of two stacked DSSCs connected in series. In this work, the T-DSSC was fabricated using a TCO-less structure as the bottom electrode in an attempt to remove one of the TCO components from the bottom cell.19 Fig. 5 shows the electron flow in the TCO-less T-DSSC consisting of a TCO-based top electrode and a TCO-less bottom electrode. Light is introduced from the front. The D131 dye in the top electrode is excited and electrons are excited from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)top electrode to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)top electrode, followed by injection from the dye into the porous TiO2 layer and collection by the FTO layer on the front of the cell. The light passing through the top electrode and the FTO layer in the middle reaches the bottom electrode, which is stained with the N719 dye. The bottom electrode absorbs the remaining light flux. The complementary electronic absorption spectra of dyes D131 and N719 (Fig. 1) indicates that the photons with wavelengths longer than 500 nm, which were not absorbed by the top cell, are now available for the bottom cell. The electrons of the N719 dye in the bottom electrode are excited from the (HOMO)bottom cell to the (LUMO)bottom cell. The LUMO level of the dyes used in these cells is higher than the conduction band level of mesoporous TiO2. This leads to facile injection of the electrons from the dyes to the porous TiO2. The bottom cell electrons are collected by the protected metal mesh. Electrons from the top photoanode are directed to the counter electrode of the bottom cell. At the same time, electrons collected by the TCO-less photoanode of the bottom cell also reach the counter electrode of the top cell. The electrons at the counter electrodes reduce the I3− in electrolytes to form I−, which leads to the regeneration of the dye, as follows:D + hν → D*, excitation process.D* + TiO2 → eTiO2− + D+, injection process.eTiO2− + C.E. → TiO2 + e− (C.E.), energy generation.

3.2 Optimization of the top cell Jsc in T-DSSCs
In T-DSSCs connected in series, the performance of the top cell in terms of its optimum thickness and the light transmission through the top cell, together with the complementary light absorption and photon harvesting with respect to the bottom cell, have crucial roles. In T-DSSCs connected in series, the overall efficiency is mainly controlled by the cell with the lower Jsc. Therefore a large mismatch between the Jsc of the bottom cell and that of the top cell results in a poor overall Jsc for the tandem cell. Fig. 6 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of TCO-based single cells and T-DSSCs fabricated using a D131-sensitized top electrode and a N719-sensitized bottom electrode in the T-DSSC device architecture of Fig. 2. It can be seen from this figure that the Voc of the T-DSSC is the sum of the Voc of the top and bottom cells, which is a typical characteristic of T-DSSCs connected in series. Table 1 shows that T-DSSCs only show a slight increase in external power conversion efficiency (4.3%) compared with the best single cell (3.8%, top cell). In spite of the summation of the Voc in T-DSSCs, the very low fill factor (FF) as a result of the highly mismatched Jsc values of the top and bottom cells may be responsible for the only slight enhancement of the photoconversion efficiency.

As the bottom cell receives only the photons remaining after passing through the top cell, it is important to optimize the thickness of the nanoporous TiO2 layer used for the D131 dye-sensitization of the cells. In this context, the transmission of the light passing through the D131 dye in the top electrode and falling on to the bottom cell was measured with varying thicknesses of the nanoporous TiO2 layer (Fig. 7). It can be clearly seen that there is decrease in the transmittance of light with increasing thickness of the TiO2 layer in the top electrode.

Fig. 8 shows the effect of the thickness of the nanoporous TiO2 layer on the photovoltaic performance of the TCO-based T-DSSCs using four FTO glasses (Fig. 2). The harvesting of the photon flux in the top cell increases with increasing thickness of the layer in the top cell. However, this increasing thickness reduces the intensity of the transmitted light reaching the bottom cell and has an adverse effect on the performance of the bottom cell. In all cases the Voc in the T-DSSCs was the sum of the Voc of the top and bottom cells. The FF was found to decrease drastically when the thickness of the TiO2 layer in the top electrode increased to more than 1 μm, leading to a reduction in the overall photoconversion efficiency of the T-DSSCs with the structure shown in Fig. 2.

The best photovoltaic performance (6.28%) and photon-harvesting behaviour of the T-DSSCs shown in Fig. 2 were, therefore, obtained when the top cell sensitized with D131 had a 1 μm thick layer of nanoporous TiO2, as shown in Fig. 9, with the photovoltaic parameters shown in Table 2. Table 2 clearly indicates that a relatively good match between the Jsc value of the top cell (7.17 mA cm−2) and the bottom cell (6.07 mA cm−2) results in a better FF of 0.65, ultimately leading to a much improved photoconversion efficiency compared with the individual top and bottom cells.

3.3 Optimization of Jsc of bottom cell and TCO-less T-DSSC
As discussed earlier, T-DSSCs with the structure shown in Fig. 2 usually consist of four FTO glasses. The TCO is not only one of the most costly components of the DSSCs, but it also decreases the transmission of light when light passes from the top cell to the bottom cell.15 The TCO-less T-DSSC with the structure shown in Fig. 3 was fabricated and the transmission of light at the surface of the bottom TiO2 layer was compared with that of the T-DSSC with the structure shown in Fig. 2. The results are shown in Fig. 10. It can be clearly seen that the removal of only one of the TCO layers of the middle substrate between the top and bottom cells leads to about a 20% enhancement in the amount of light transmitted in the wavelength range 600–1100 nm. These results suggest the usefulness of the TCO-less T-DSSC device architecture in terms of the light flux available to the bottom cells, especially if these cells are potential NIR sensitizers.
 Fig. 10  Transmission spectra of T-DSSC with light passing through three TCO layers (the TCO T-DSSC shown in Fig. 2) and only two TCO layers (the back-contact T-DSSC shown in Fig. 3). 
As discussed earlier, in the standard TCO-based T-DSSCs with the structure shown in Fig. 2, nanoporous TiO2 with a 1 μm thick layer gave the best performance. Optimization of the TiO2 layer thickness in the TCO-less bottom cell sensitized with N719 dye was carried out for the TCO-less T-DSSC (Fig. 3). The thickness of the nanoporous TiO2 layer coated on the protected metal mesh (bottom TCO-less electrode) was varied and the results are shown in Fig. 11. In all the TCO-less T-DSSCs, about 1.45 V of the Voc (the sum of the Voc of the top and bottom cells) was observed, demonstrating the tandem functionality. It is interesting to see from Fig. 11 that the optimum thickness of the TiO2 layer in the TCO-less bottom electrode was 16 μm. A relatively thinner nanoporous TiO2 layer leads to inefficient light harvesting, while a much thicker TiO2 layer leads to a limitation in the redox ion diffusion. As this is the same as the TCO T-DSSC with the structure shown in Fig. 2, the mismatch of the Jsc value of the top and bottom cells leads to a reduced FF of the T-DSSCs and ultimately results in a reduction in the overall photoconversion efficiency.

As shown in Fig. 11b, the best photovoltaic performance for the TCO-less T-DSSC shown in Fig. 3 was obtained using a TCO-less bottom electrode (16 μm thickness) sensitized with N719 and a TCO-based top electrode (1 μm thickness) sensitized with D131, as shown in Fig. 12 and Table 3. An external power conversion efficiency of 6.06% was obtained for this TCO-less T-DSSC (Fig. 3). In addition, the Voc of the TCO-less T-DSSC (1.45 V) is the sum of the Voc observed for the top cell (0.76 V) and the bottom cell (0.68 V), confirming the successful formation of a tandem cell.

In the next step, in order to remove the TCO layer completely from the bottom cell, a TCO-less T-DSSC was fabricated using a back-contact TCO-less bottom cell sensitized with N719 dye, in which the Pt-coated FTO was replaced with Pt-coated Ti foil as the counter electrode using the device architecture shown in Fig. 4. This T-DSSC contains only two TCO layers in the top cell sensitized with D131 and has a nanoporous TiO2 layer of optimum thickness (1 μm), as discussed earlier. Fig. 13 shows the photovoltaic characteristics and photocurrent action spectra for the TCO-less T-DSSC with the structure shown in Fig. 4 and the photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 4. A very good match of the Jsc for the top and bottom cells results in a high FF of 0.69 for the TCO-less T-DSSC (Fig. 4), giving an external power conversion efficiency of 7.10%. The observation of the high Jsc and FF for the TCO-less bottom cell (Fig. 4) may be attributed to the more effective use of the incoming photon flux to the bottom cell by utilizing the reflected light from the metallic Ti foil. This was confirmed by the relatively higher IPCE (Fig. 13) of the TCO-less T-DSSC with the structure shown in Fig. 4. At the same, the relatively high conductivity of the Ti foil compared with the FTO gives a higher FF.

4. Conclusion
TCO-less T-DSSCs were fabricated, not only to remove the costly TCO components, but also to enhance efficiency. The optimum thicknesses for the TCO-based top electrode sensitized with dye D131 and the TCO-less bottom cell sensitized with dye N719 were 1 and 16 μm, respectively. Complete removal of the TCO layer from the bottom cell gave the best TCO-less T-DSSC with a Jsc of 7.20 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.42 V and an FF of 0.69, leading to an external power conversion efficiency of 7.10%. The TCO-less T-DSSC with the structure shown in Fig. 4 had a superior photovoltaic performance to the conventional TCO-based T-DSSC (6.28%) with the structure shown in Fig. 2. These results clearly indicate the superiority of our novel TCO-less T-DSSC architecture over previous TCO-based T-DSSCs and shows their potential in the fabrication of more efficient DSSCs by using efficient NIR dyes to sensitize the bottom TCO-less electrode.
