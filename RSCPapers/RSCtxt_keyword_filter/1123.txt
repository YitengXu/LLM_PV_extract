From the commercialization point of view, the overall solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency should compete with other solar cells. But, due to structural restrictions of DSSC using the liquid electrolyte and a space requirement between two electrodes, the direct tandem construction of DSSCs by stacking of repeating units is highly limited. In this feature article, important research trials to overcome these barriers and a recent research trend to improve the light harvesting strategies mainly panchromatic engineering, various tandem approaches such as parallel tandem, series tandem, p–n tandem etc., have been briefly reviewed.Suresh Kannan BalasingamSuresh Kannan Balasingam is currently a PhD student in Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea.

IntroductionThe advantages of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been challenging the conventional solar cells in various aspects such as a variety of colours, semi-transparency, and low cost fabrication processes, etc. Although noticeable attention has been paid from Gratzel's work in 1991, the origin of DSSC goes back to 1870's. Vogel et al. prepared a silver halide in gelatine medium, which shows sensitivity to UV light.1 Bare silver halide did not show any activity towards visible light, but Vogel made it possible to be active to visible light by applying dyes with silver halide–gelatine emulsion in 1873, and the phenomenon was further proved by James Moser in 1887.2 The voltage developed for the first time was very low of around 0.04 V. After a few decades, Hishiki (1965) and Gerischer (1968) paid attention to the system of ZnO with dyes such as rose bengal and cyanine series.3,4 More closely, Daltrozzo and Tributsch adopted Rhodamine B on the ZnO system, and observed the transfer of electrons from Rhodamine B to the conduction band of ZnO.5 In 1977, the first application of TiO2 instead of ZnO was achieved by Spitler and Calvin.6 The authors observed that the current densities are related to the amount of dyes adsorbed and pH of the solution used for the dye adsorption processes.From the late 1980's to early 1990's, Gratzel had been developing a newly designed dye (Ru series)–TiO2 system and this opened up a new era for dye-sensitized semiconductor systems.7–10 Since the investigation, the components of DSSC have not been changed a lot. To date, TiO2 NPs sensitized with Ru series dyes as a working electrode, a Pt counter electrode (CE), and an iodine based electrolyte system are the main components of DSSCs. Although there have been no landslide changes in DSSCs, many of the modification of dyes, additives, and TiO2 paste have been successful. Of course, the modification and improvement of DSSC has been moving forward in order to improve their efficiencies. For instance, TiO2 NPs are optimized based on the surface area with high crystallinity and in some cases, new structures such as nanorods, hollow spheres, nanotubes etc. are introduced.11–15 Additives are developed to block the empty space between dyes, which prevent dye aggregations. Electrolytes are also chasing the high mobility of electrons from the CE back to dyes with possibly high shunt resistances and high temperature stability.16 A number of dyes have been designed to improve their light absorption wavelength range of solar spectrum and in turn the overall efficiency of the cell. For example, dyes with a high absorption coefficient may increase the number of effective electrons on the LUMO level of the dyes. Also, the band gap (including HOMO and LUMO levels) of dye should be matched with TiO2 and the electrolyte system, otherwise, over potential may deter a properly working system. In general photo electrochemical reactions, for example, a solar cell, increasing the range of absorption band is a matter of concern for the effective utilization of the solar spectrum. Many trials have been accomplished by the development of new dyes to meet the above-mentioned criteria. A brief evolution of dyes such as Ru based dyes from N3 to N719, and black dyes were included.10,17–19 They all have very similar chemical structure, but increase the region of the absorption spectrum as shown in Fig. 1. The present study summarizes the trials done aiming to broaden the absorption region in DSSCs, for example, panchromatic engineering and tandem structures. Addition of photonic crystals and a scattering layer to the DSSC have been excluded from the present study, since they could be one topic of interest under a different category. Some solar cells utilize tandem structures in order to broaden the active absorption region to a full solar spectrum. GaAs solar cells are the most representative solar cells for tandem structures with more than 3 active layers such as InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs, InGaP/InGaAs/Ge, or InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs/Ge etc.20–23 But in the case of tandem DSSCs, due to the structural restrictions such as the usage of a liquid electrolyte and a space requirement between working and counter electrodes, stacking of repeating units is highly limited. In this feature article, we briefly review the recent and important research attempts to broaden the spectral response of the DSSCs and the methods to overcome the above-mentioned barriers.

Panchromatic DSSCs2.1 Various dyes for different spectral absorptionThe most advancing challenge in order to achieve a broad spectral response in DSSC is choosing suitable dyes. Dyes are the primary active materials, which determine the colour of the working electrode. The first dye for the DSSC system, N3, responds to visible light ranging down to 800 nm. However, a set of sun spectra has photons down to infrared with longer wavelength more than 1000 nm. CIGS and CdTe solar cells normally have a band gap of around 1.4 eV (theoretically possible maximum efficiency = 33%), which are considered as an ideal band gap based on Shockley–Queisser limit.24 Compared to these band gaps, the Ru dyes have band gaps of ca. 2 eV (theoretical possible maximum efficiency is around 20% by Shockley–Queisser limit).25 This value is quite large, and does not cover the whole range of the sun spectrum. Therefore, various dyes are designed and applied to the DSSC system to harvest a broader spectrum of sunlight. In this article, Ru based and organic dyes were organized based on their high performance with different range of absorption spectra. The data could help to find a selection of suitable dyes for the panchromatic DSSC applications.The black dye for panchromatic application was first introduced by Nazeeruddin et al. in 1997.26 The new class dye was synthesized by replacing the terpyridyl ligand with three carboxyl groups. Efficient panchromatic sensitization was extended over the whole visible range up to 920 nm. Similar spectral response was obtained by β-diketonato Ru(II)-polypyridyl complexes, Ru(4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine)(1,1,1-trifluoropentane-2,4-dionato)(NCS) and Ru(4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine)(1,1,1-trifluoroeicosane-2,4-dionato)(NCS), by the Arakawa group in 2002.27 When the dyes are anchored to the TiO2 surface, photocurrent action spectra of both dyes show highly effective panchromatic sensitization up to 900 nm. In order to provide options to employ dyes for a broad spectral response, we have drawn a bar chat consisting of highly efficient selective dyes with characteristic values such as absorption range and maximum absorption peaks (λmax) as shown in Fig. 2.28–85 ESI† is also available for more dyes. The dyes selection was investigated after the review paper published in 2009.86 Fig. 2  Absorption range of various dyes. Y-axis indicates the reference number of selective dyes. X-axis shows the absorption wavelength. Red circle indicates the absorption maximum (λmax). 2.2 DSSCs with multiple dyesSince there have been difficulties in the synthesis of single panchromatic dyes responding to most of the sun spectra, it is often considered as a convenient way to employ more than one dye. The earliest trials to utilize broad sunlight absorption by more than one layer of dye have been successful by cocktailing of different dyes in a solvent.88 Deng et al. mixed tetrasulfonated gallium phthalocyanine (GaTsPc) and tetrasulfonated zinc porphyrin (ZnTsPP) sensitizers in a DMSO solvent, and coated on the working electrode until the absorbance of the electrode showed no more increase.89 The total concentration of dyes was maintained at 1 × 10−5 M. ZnTsPP and GaTsPc show strong absorption at ranges of 600 to 700 nm and 400 to 450 nm, respectively. Although the full system with both dyes showed enhancement of photocurrent on monochromatic illumination at 685 nm, the cell performance under 1 sun spectra was not measured. The authors performed further experiments with various porphyrins.90–92 The dyes they employed for cocktailing have structures very similar in size and geometry. For example, the central metal of ZnTsPP was replaced with hydrogen, H2TsPP, to alter the absorption region to visible light. However, simply mixing two or more dyes in a pot is not considered as a good complementary method to make a broad absorption spectrum of the working electrode. Mixing of more than two different kinds of dye molecules may not show an ordered self-assembled monolayer and there might be negative interactions between the dye molecules. These are not enticing for the maximum number of dyes on a given space of the working electrode.In 2008, Hayase et al. prepared a regular TiO2 working electrode with a thickness of 9 μm on FTO glass, and then placed it in a stainless container containing a black dye solution.87 Initial results showed both to be intact. After that the container was sealed, CO2 with a pressure of up to 5–18 MPa at 40–60 °C was introduced. Once the coating was stopped at a certain time, the dye coating was precisely controlled on a μm scale. Once, the first layer was controlled as described, the rest of the TiO2 layer was coated by dipping it in the second dye solution. Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows a schematic for the process and the corresponding IPCE from a device using this method. The device successfully represented the sum of each single-layered cell. In order to analyse the double layer formation, the fluorescence monitoring technique using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon) was employed. Fig. 3(c) shows a clear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and thickness of each dye layer. The Hayase group studied another similar structure by the dye-replacing method.93 For the successful double layer formation, a working electrode was immersed into a mixture of NK3705 + Z907 cocktail dye solution. NK3705 dye molecules are smaller than the Z907 dye molecules, therefore the former dye rapidly diffuses into the mesoporous structure and swiftly adsorbs on the majority area of the TiO2 surface. In order to replace the NK3705 dye from the whole range of 9 μm thick working electrode, it may take around 10 days using this method. The authors suggested that NK3705 is weakly adsorbed on TiO2 and then it could be easily replaced by the Z907 dye.

One of the interesting structures was achieved by Clifford et al. in 2004, who suggested multiple electron transfer processes on the co-sensitized TiO2 working electrode by Al2O3 layers.94 Choi et al. revisited stepwise co-sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 films in 2008 with organic dyes to obtain improved cell performance.95 Firstly, a 4 μm thick TiO2 film was dipped into a dye solution until no further changes on UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained. Afterwards, this dye coated working electrode was washed, dried and then immersed into a mixture of aluminium isopropoxide and isopropanol solution for 15 minutes at room temperature. Exposure of this sample to air completed hydrolysis of the aluminium isopropoxide i.e. the Al2O3 layer was coated on the sample. This electrode was further sensitized with the second dye. The first trial did not show improved performance based on Ru dyes, the second trial by Choi et al. proved a possible increase in cell efficiency by employing organic dyes such as JK-2 and SQ1.The most accurate and prominent work for panchromatic DSSC was performed by Lee et al. in 2009.96 They applied up to three dye layers with a highly selective positioning method. The process to realize the structure is illustrated in Fig. 4 for two dye layers. Firstly, the working electrode with normal thickness was coated with the N719 dye (dye 1) using a conventional method. Secondly, styrene oligomer was filled in the mesoporous TiO2 film, and polymerized. An aqueous NaOH solution penetrated through the film, which detached the N719 dye from the TiO2 surface. Finally, selective etching removed polystyrene and the naked TiO2 layer can be prepared for the next dye layer. Three dye layers can be obtained in a similar way. When we employ more than two dyes in a working electrode, the final current densities are obviously expected to increase. However, the open circuit voltage is more complicated. Lee et al. tried to understand the correlation between Voc and multiple dye layers through the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The dependence of Voc with respect to the logarithm of the inverse of the frequencies at the maximum imaginary resistance of the Nyquist plot suggests that Voc is closely related to the interfacial charge transfer rate at the dye layer and electrolyte.

Discrete layers formation can also be obtained by the so-called “stamping” method introduced by Huang et al.97 The schematics of the stamping method are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). TiO2 NPs were dispersed in ethanol, and coated on an ITO-PEN substrate using a doctor blade method. The film was attached on the substrate using a cold isostatic press at a pressure of 100 MPa for 3 minutes. The same process was completed with another kind of dye on a non-conductive PEN substrate without pressing. The un-pressed film was transferred onto a previously pressed ITO-PEN substrate working electrode. This method utilizes the transfer of the un-pressed layer onto the already pressed working electrode. Fig. 5(c) shows photos of the individual GD3 and N719 sensitized films before and after stamping. They also compared this discrete double layered system with a simple cocktailing method. The first comparison by IPCE is shown in Fig. 6. While the panchromatic device prepared by the stamping method showed a comparable sum of efficiency of each individual device, the device prepared by the cocktailing technique showed a lower IPCE over most of the wavelength region from 500 nm to 750 nm.

Instead of using the pressurizing method, Miao et al. used the high temperature sintering method for each layer.98 A scheme for the experiment is described in Fig. 7. They prepared the first layer using the conventional method on FTO glass by the high temperature sintering process. However, the second layer was prepared on the ceramic tile which has low adhesion with TiO2. This second layer (or the third one as a scattering layer) was easily transferred to the first layer by a friction action. The device structure with absorbance characteristics is shown in Fig. 8. An efficiency of 11.05% is achieved by this structure with N719 and black dyes. Current densities are shown as a sum of each individual device, and an open circuit voltage is located in the middle of each individual device value.

A similar structure has been achieved using a layer-by-layer fabrication method. Yang et al. prepared the multiple dye-sensitized TiO2 films using a vacuum cold spray in 2011.99 For the first layer, the researchers applied the conventional method using the N719 dye (24 h soaking at room temperature). Afterwards, the second TiO2 layer was added by the vacuum cold spray method, and then the black dye was applied (24 h soaking at room temperature). However, there is a concern for this experimental method. Since Yang et al. left the first dye coated sample in the second dye solution for 24 h, there might be a replacement of the first dye molecules by the second dye molecules. Normally, 30 minutes are enough to remove the extra N719 dye molecules from the dye coated TiO2 working electrode using an ethanol solvent. Further treatment often lowers the cell efficiency due to the removal of dye molecules by the solvent action.Recently, Lan et al. reported enhanced photovoltaic performance with co-sensitization of porphyrin and an organic dye.100 To prepare the co-sensitized working electrode, TiO2 coated FTO glass was immersed into a solution of LD12 with CDCA in ethanol–toluene at room temperature for 3 h. Afterwards, the LD12-sensitized film was washed, dried, and then immersed into a solution of CD5 with CDCA at room temperature for 2 h. In order to obtain an efficient working electrode as shown by Lan et al., the first dye adsorbed on TiO2 should not come off while the second dye coating is processed. Otherwise, a simple replacement of the first dye occurs during the second dye adsorption process, which is not believed to be an ideal way for the application of two different dyes. Lan et al. successfully introduced the parallel tandem structure simply by adding the second dye in a working electrode. When LD12 and CD5 are employed separately for devices, they showed cell efficiencies of 7.5% (14.97 mA cm−2, 0.711 V) and 5.7% (11.12 mA cm−2, 0.689 V) respectively. The device with LD12 and CD5 in an electrode showed improved cell performance with 9.0% (Jsc = 16.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.731 V). Interestingly, this working electrode containing a two dye system showed an increase in Voc as compared to each individual cell with only one of the dyes. Normally, Jsc increases are expected by co-sensitization due to effective response to the sun spectra. The authors measured charge densities for these devices to obtain a conduction band shift of TiO2, and also observed a cathodic shift from the LD12–CD5 system by 25 mV with respect to the individual devices. Briefly, Lan et al. believed that the two dye system effectively blocked the TiO2 surface, which blocks Li+ penetration to the TiO2 surface. The Li+ approach to the TiO2 surface normally believed to lower the Fermi level of TiO2, which further lowers the Voc value of the device.3. Tandem cells3.1 Parallel tandem DSSCsIn 2004, Nelles et al. fabricated a tandem DSSC with two different sensitizer dyes in two different (upper and lower) compartments of the cell, which were connected in parallel to achieve a high photo current density and in turn improved power conversion efficiencies.101 The upper compartment consisted of TiO2 sensitized with a red dye and the lower compartment was made of black dye-sensitized TiO2 for the corresponding absorption of the shorter and longer wavelength regions of the solar spectrum as shown in Fig. 9. The overall conversion efficiency of 10.5% and the short-circuit current densities of Jsc = 21.1 mA cm−2 were achieved using this structure. Kubo et al. proposed the light absorption model of tandem DSSC, further light harvesting efficiency and incident photon-to-current conversion (IPCE) were calculated using the absorption spectra of dye, electrolyte and TCO substrates.103 They followed the Nelles et al. design and fabricated tandem DSSCs with N719 coated TiO2 as the top electrode and black dye coated TiO2 as the bottom electrode. The only difference between the two laid in the use of a liquid electrolyte, as compared to Nelles et al., who used a polymer based gel type electrolyte. The increase in the photocurrent density of 15.9 mA cm−2 and the overall conversion efficiency of 7.6% were recorded. Fig. 9  Schematic representation of parallel-connected tandem DSSC. The first compartment consists of red dye and the second compartment consists of black dye-sensitized working electrodes.

Murayama and Mori fabricated a face-to-face novel tandem structure with two dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 films, as working electrodes, and a platinum mesh sheet was inserted between the working electrodes, which played the role of a common counter electrode.102 The TiO2 anodes were connected in parallel with each other and in series with a Pt mesh counter electrode as illustrated in Fig. 10. Two different types such as homogeneous DSC (N3 dye-sensitized TiO2) and heterogeneous DSC (N3 dye and black dye-sensitized TiO2) were measured in this experiment. Homogeneous DSC showed a current density of 5.9 mA cm−2, which was the summation of front (4.8 mA cm−2) and back (1.0 mA cm−2) electrode current densities and the corresponding efficiency of 1.8% was reported, whereas heterogeneous DSC showed a Jsc value of 11.4 mA cm−2 with an overall conversion efficiency of 3.9%. In 2008, the same authors developed the equivalent circuit model in order to study the aggregate effect of the photocurrent.105 They had also optimized the thickness of the photoelectrode to 7.8 μm, which showed a higher photocurrent density of 13.3 mA cm−2 and higher conversion efficiency of 4.7%. Fig. 10  Schematic illustration of face-to-face tandem structure. A platinum mesh counter electrode is inserted between two working electrodes. Reprinted with permission from ref. 102. Optimization of tandem dye-sensitized solar cells by varying the thickness of the top electrode was done by Yanagida et al.104 The top cell consisted of the N719 dye coated TiO2 and the bottom cell consisted of black dye coated TiO2 electrodes. They had investigated two types of TDSSCs, i.e. parallel-connected TDSSC (P-TDSSC) and series-connected TDSSC (S-TDSSC). They observed that while increasing the thickness of the top electrode, the Jsc of the top cell increases due to higher light harvesting efficiency, but the Jsc of the bottom cell decreases due to partial overlap of the absorption spectrum of the top cell's N719 dye and the bottom cell's black dye. The increase in thickness gradually decreases the Voc value of the bottom cell but there is no drastic change observed. The P-TDSSC showed a higher efficiency (11%) than the S-TDSSC (10.2%), since the efficiency of S-TDSSC is dependent on Jsc values, which has experienced serious photocurrent mismatch, whereas the efficiency of P-TDSSC depends on the Voc which has not change drastically (see Fig. 11). Fig. 11  Current–voltage curves of parallel tandem DSSC (top) and series tandem DSSC (bottom). Reprinted with permission from ref. 104. Fan and colleagues have investigated the method of improving the Voc of the back sub-cell in a P-TDSSC.106 The schematic representation of the tandem cell is shown in Fig. 12. The front cell consisted of JK2 sensitized TiO2 with a lithium ion based electrolyte and the back cell consisted of a SQ1–TT1 sensitized TiO2–Al2O3 electrode with a lithium ion free electrolyte. The introduction of the Li+ ion absent electrolyte to the back sub-cell could help to heighten the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band and the presence of an Al2O3 blocking layer helped to retard the charge recombination reaction. Combination of both these aspects enhanced the open circuit voltage of the back sub-cell and in turn, the overall conversion efficiency of parallel tandem cells.

Recently, Sun et al. designed a P-TDSSC with double sided nanotube arrays as the working electrode and platinum based counter electrodes as shown in Fig. 13.107 The novel parallel structure showed a 70% increase in photocurrent and 30% enhancement in efficiency compared to the single cells. The parallel tandem effect was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and current–voltage curves.

Cell components are as follows (from left to right): FTO-Pt/electrolyte/dye-nanotubes/Ti/nanotubes-dye/electrolyte/Pt-FTO. Reprinted with permission from ref. 107. Li et al. fabricated double band tandem DSSCs using TH305 and HY103 organic sensitizers.108 The front cell consisted of zirconia doped TiO2 sensitized with TH305 in order to improve the photovoltage of the cell. Notably, the sensitizer TH305 has more negative LUMO energy level (−1.28 V vs. NHE) for the better matching with ECB of ZrO2 doped TiO2. The back sub-cell consisted of undoped TiO2 sensitized with near IR light absorbing dye HY103, which has an absorption range of 500–800 nm. The two cells are partitioned with double-sided FTO glass as shown in Fig. 14. The Mott–Schottky relationship of working electrodes has been investigated using the impedance spectroscopy. From the linear graph of C−2vs. E, the flat band potentials of bare TiO2 and ZrO2 doped TiO2 were acquired. Interestingly, the flat band potential of ZrO2 doped TiO2 is more negatively shifted by 80 mV than the undoped TiO2 electrode and hence, the organic dye TH305 is a more suitable candidate for the ZrO2 doped TiO2 electrode. The individual cell efficiency of the ZrO2-doped TiO2/TH305 front sub-cell and the TiO2/HY103 back sub-cell is 9.05% and 2.45% respectively. The overall energy conversion efficiency of the double band tandem DSSC is reported to be around 11.5%. Fig. 14  Schematic representation of double band tandem DSSC using organic dyes.

Transparent conductive oxide-less TDSSC was prepared by Hayase and colleagues.110 In this work, authors used a glass rod as a support, dye coated TiO2 layer/porous titanium electrode/gel film electrode/Ti counter electrode were assembled around the glass rod as presented in Fig. 16 (top). The same glass rod containing two different areas (area ‘A’ and area ‘B’) were stained with two different dyes (dye I: λmax = 492 nm and dye II: λmax = 646 nm) as shown in Fig. 16 (bottom). Area ‘A’ was connected in series with area ‘B’ using a copper sheet. The higher Voc of 1.13 V was the summation of cell A (0.57 V) and cell B (0.57 V) which proved the series tandem effect. The same group reported a combined effect of TCO-less tandem DSSC and light splitting wave guides.111 TCO-less TAN1 has a rod tandem (two cells) structure combined with a polystyrene dispersion wave guide in water. Another type, TCO-less TAN2 has a pillar tandem (three cells) structure coupled with three dichroic mirrors in a wave length as light-splitting structures (see Fig. 17). Efficiencies of TCO-less tandem DSSCs showed much lower efficiencies (0.69% and 1.25%) due to poor Jsc values of the cells.

Uzaki and co-workers reported series-connected TDSSCs consisting of a floating electrode design.112,113 The floating electrode was made of a flexible, free standing composite film of a dye coated titania layer supported by a mesh electrode. This electrode was inserted between the working electrode and counter electrode of conventional DSSC in order to make a tandem structure as illustrated in Fig. 18. The higher Voc value of TDSSC (0.88 V), compared to their corresponding single cells (0.6–0.66 V), confirmed the series tandem effect.

Reprinted with permission from ref. 112. 3.3 p–n type tandem DSSCsConventional dye-sensitized solar cells consist of a dye coated n-type semiconductor, commonly TiO2 and a passive counter electrode (platinum coated TCO based substrates), in which excited electrons from the dye are injected into an n-type semiconductor and reach the passive counter electrode through the external load. The new type of dye-sensitized photocathode (p-type semiconductors) operates in a reverse mode of conventional DSSCs, in which a transfer of electron occurs from the excited dye to an oxidized species of electrolyte and also from the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor to the HOMO level of the dye. The combination of both dye coated n-type photoanode and p-type photocathode semiconductors conferred the hybrid tandem structure p–n type DSSCs. For the best performance of p–n type tandem DSSCs, one should carefully select the energy levels of different components i.e. the electron transfer process from the valence band of the photocathode to the HOMO level of the dye and the LUMO level of the dye to the redox mediator should follow the downhill process as illustrated in Fig. 19. To achieve this condition, the electron in the LUMO level of the dye should not enter into the conduction band (CB) of the p-type semiconductor. Therefore, one should carefully select the large band gap material with CB above the LUMO level of the dye. In the meanwhile, the HOMO level of the dye should be lower than the VB of the p-type material and the LUMO level of the same dye must be higher than the redox system of the electrolyte. Therefore, a careful selection of semiconductor materials, dye and the redox electrolyte, renders them as key factors for the fabrication of highly efficient p–n tandem DSSCs. Fig. 19  Schematic illustration of energy levels of various components in p–n type tandem DSSC. The scale bar shows the approximate redox potential (vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE in V) and band energies (vs. vacuum level, VAC in eV) of the tandem cell components.

The observation of a photocurrent in the dye-sensitized p-type nickel oxide photocathode and the dye-sensitized p-type diamond electrodes were the first initiation of the p-type DSSCs research in 1999.119,120 He et al. prepared the nanostructured p-type nickel oxide films, which were separately sensitized with tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TTPC) and erythrosin B sensitizers.119 These electrodes were sandwiched with a passive platinised TCO based counter electrodes. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies of TTPC sensitized NiO and erythrosin B sensitized NiO were recorded as 0.24% and 3.44% respectively. The short-circuit cathodic photocurrent density (Jsc) of 0.079 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 98.5 mV and overall efficiency (η) of 0.0033% were observed for the TTPC coated NiO and a Jsc of 0.232 mA cm−2, Voc of 82.8 mV and η = 0.0076% were observed for the erythrosine B coated NiO case. The authors claimed that the observed cathodic photocurrent was due to hole injection from the dye molecule to the valence band of the p-type NiO electrode. Contemporaneous to He et al., Fujishima and colleagues also observed the cathodic photocurrent in a ruthenium based dye-sensitized p-type diamond electrode.120 In this experiment, Fujishima et al. used a three electrode setup connected to the potentiostat, for the measurement of a photocurrent by varying the electrode potential. The photocurrent was explained using the hole injection mechanism of the excited dye into the VB of the p-type diamond electrode.Interesting results based on p-type DSSCs pave the way to the discovery of the first tandem structured p–n type DSSCs in 2000 by Lindquist et al.115 They have used an n-type nanostructured TiO2 semiconductor sensitized with cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-ruthenium(II), N719 as the photoanode and p-type NiO with a large band gap (3.6 eV), coated with erythrosin B dye as the photocathode. The electrolyte system consisted of a traditional I−/I3− based redox system with 0.44 V vs. NHE. The current–voltage characteristics of fabricated p–n tandem DSSC were compared with the two different reference cells. The first reference cell (n-DSSC) was made by the dye coated TiO2 photoanode and a passive platinum counter electrode using a traditional electrolyte system. Another reference cell (p-DSSC) comprised of an erythrosine coated NiO with the same platinum electrode and electrolyte system. The overall efficiency of tandem DSSC was very low of about 0.39%. But the most interesting observation was the higher open circuit voltage of tandem DSSC compared with the p-DSSC and n-DSSC reference cells. The Voc of n-DSSC was equal to 650 mV, the p-type DSSC was 83 mV and the p–n type tandem cell was equal to 732 mV, which was almost equal to the addition of p-DSSC and n-DSSC reference cells voltage (733 mV), proving that the tandem DSSCs could deliver a higher photopotential than the single semiconductor DSSCs. The current density of tandem DSSC (2.3 mA cm−2) was approximately three times lower than the n-type DSSC (7.1 mA cm−2) and ten times higher than that of the p-type DSSC (0.26 mA cm−2). The conclusion was that the tandem DSSC was limited by the photocurrent density. The authors suggested that the photocurrent densities of both electrodes (p-DSSC and n-DSSC) should be matched to get an optimized efficiency of tandem DSSC, which could be done by varying the amount of adsorbed dyes and/or film thicknesses of the electrodes.In 2005, Nakasa and co-workers fabricated a p–n type DSSC comprised of a conventional TiO2 dye-sensitized photoanode, an I−/I3− electrolyte and a dye-sensitized NiO photocathode as described by Lindquist et al.116 They had achieved around 0.92 V open circuit voltage (Voc) with 3.62 mA cm−2 of short-circuit current density (Jsc) with an overall efficiency of 0.66%. These results were much better than the one reported by Lindquist et al. The enhancement in photoconversion efficiency, Voc and Jsc were attributed to the improvement of the nanostructured NiO film prepared by the sol–gel method using a triblock copolymer template. The improved nanostructure could increase the dye-adsorption surface area and in turn light adsorption, resulting in an increased number of photoactivated electrons. Still the lower value of around 3.6 mA cm−2 current density was observed for the p–n type DSSC, which was much lower than the n-DSSC (5.83 mA cm−2) prepared by the same group. Further, they have concluded that an increase in thickness of the NiO film and a proper choice of cathodic and anodic dye would enhance the current density value of the tandem cell.Novel tandem DSSC containing FeSx (x = 1,2) nanosheet films were synthesized by Hu and colleagues using a one-step hydrothermal reaction of iron foil and sulphur powder with and without a reducing agent.117 Since the pyrite (FeS2) has a very high optical absorption co-efficient of 5 × 105 cm−1 in the case of λ ≤ 700 nm and a desirable band gap of 0.95 eV for the solar spectrum it could be a potential candidate for the solar cell applications. The authors fabricated four different types of DSSCs, out of which two contained non-dye coated FeS and FeS2 photocathodes while the remaining two cells contained Pt and Fe as passive counter electrodes. For all the cases, N3 dye coated n-TiO2 served as the photoanode. The I–V curves of different solar cells are presented in Fig. 20. The authors found that the FeS photocathode showed a higher efficiency than the FeS2 photocathode in a tandem cell arrangement. For the FeS-nTiO2 tandem cell, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 2.53 mA cm−2 and an open circuit photovoltage of 0.60 V with the overall conversion efficiency of 1.32% were reported, which suggests that iron sulphide thin films are attractive photocathodes for the tandem DSSC applications. Fig. 20  Current–voltage curves of TiO2 based dye-sensitized solar cells combined with different photocathodes: (a) Pt; (b) FeS; (c) FeS2; (d) Fe. Reprinted with permission from ref. 117. Gibson et al. used a cobalt based electrolyte, CoII/IIItris(4,4′-ditert-butyl-2,2′-dipyridyl)perchlorate as a redox mediator and ‘dyad’ sensitizer (PINDI) coated NiO as a photocathode.118 P-type DSSC showed a much higher open circuit voltage of 0.35 V. The higher Voc of p-DSSC ascribed to the more negative redox potential of the cobalt based redox couple compared to the I−/I3− based electrolyte. The authors have coupled a p-DSSC with the N719 dye coated TiO2 photoanode. The measured open circuit potential (Voc) of pn-tandem DSSC is 0.91 V which was 0.35 V higher than the n-DSSC (0.66 V), seems that the summation of voltages of p-DSSC and n-DSSC is equal to the p–n tandem cell. The authors claimed that better performance of TDSSC was due to the stability of the cobalt based electrolyte with the NiO and TiO2 based electrodes and the slow recombination of the PINDI sensitizer. Gibson et al. suggested that a combination of sensitizers, where one absorbs the low-energy photons and another absorbs the high energy photons, leads to a complimentary absorption of the spectra and a higher efficiency of TDSSCs.In 2010, Nattestad and co-workers reported highly efficient NiO photocathodes sensitized with a donor–acceptor dye comprising of perylenemonoimid (PMI) as the acceptor and an oligothiophene coupled to triphenylamine as the donor with variable length of oligothiophenes (n = 1,2,3).114Fig. 21 shows the chemical structure of donor–acceptor dyes and the electron-density distribution for the LUMO and HOMO levels of the same dyes. In the case of sexithiophene (n = 3) PMI dye-sensitized NiO based p-DSSC showed a remarkable value of Jsc (5.35 mA cm−2) and Voc (218 mV). The higher efficiency was rationalized in terms of a charge transfer kinetics mechanism. The increase in length of oligothiophene controls the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers and also increases the hydrophobicity of the dye to shield the NiO surface from the electrolyte. These factors helped to decelerate the charge recombination reaction and in turn improved power conversion efficiency of the cell. The p–n tandem DSSC was fabricated with the above-mentioned p-DSSC and n-DSSC (N719 coated TiO2) using an iodine based electrolyte. The tandem cell showed the highest open circuit voltage of 1079 mV, a photocurrent density of around 2.4 mA cm−2 and an overall efficiency of 1.91% (see Fig. 22), which is the most efficient p–n tandem DSSC reported so far in the literature (see Table 1).115–118 Fig. 21  (a) Chemical structure of donor–acceptor dyes.

CIGS is a compound semiconductor composed of a solid solution of copper indium selenide (CIS) and copper gallium selenide (CGS) with a chemical formula of CuInxGa(1−x)Se2, where x can be varied from 0 to 1 and the corresponding band gap varies continuously with x from 1.7 eV (CGS) to 1.0 eV (CIS).122 DSSC shows higher external quantum efficiencies in the range of 400–800 nm of the visible region, this corresponds to the band gap of 3.1–1.6 eV. CIGS with varying x content decreases the band gap from 1.7 eV down to 1.0 eV, which could be useful for harvesting in the red and near infra-red region of the solar spectrum. The combination of both solar cells enhanced the absorption of a wide range of solar spectrum and the corresponding efficiency was reported to be around 15%.In 2009, Wenger et al. fabricated a monolithic design of a TiO2/CIGS tandem cell in order to overcome the drawbacks of mechanical stacking design.123 The mechanical stacking design confined with FTO supported DSSC on both sides. The bottom side of DSSC was connected in series with a CIGS/CdS cell using an index matching liquid. Since ITO has higher transmittance compared to the FTO,121 the back side of the FTO contact of DSSC in the mechanical design was replaced with ITO in the monolithic design. Further, DSSC was merged directly with the CIGS cell without any index matching liquid in order to minimize the reflection loss and free charge carrier absorption losses (see Fig. 23). The overall conversion efficiency of 12.2% was reported with a Voc of 1.22 V; a higher open circuit voltage value confirmed the series tandem effect but the efficiency was much lower than the mechanically stacked design. The initial voltage loss of 140 mV and the performance degradation of the monolithic tandem cell within an hour were attributed to the corrosion of the CIGS bottom cell by the percolation of I3− ions in the electrolyte from the top cell. Fig. 23  Schematic illustration of a monolithic tandem device containing DSSC as a top cell and CIGS as a bottom cell. Reprinted with permission from ref. 123. Wang and colleagues followed Liska et al.'s method of mechanical stacking of DSSC/CIGS, except using the index matching liquid.124 Two different CIGS solar cells with the efficiency of 10.27% and 16.76% were mechanically stacked with the DSSC (7% efficiency) in a separate experiment to form tandem cells. Their corresponding tandem efficiencies were found to be 10.46% and 12.45%. The authors observed that the top DSSC of the tandem cell plays an important role in the overall conversion efficiency, since even with the higher performance of bottom CIGS, the tandem cell did not show significant improvement in the conversion efficiency. To confirm this statement, they have simulated the equivalent circuit analysis to find where the tandem structure stops improving their performance. From the analysis, the bottom CIGS cell efficiency beyond 10.82% leads to a decrease in overall efficiency of the tandem cell when the top DSSC is fixed (DSC-I). Further when they increased the optical transmittance value of the top DSSC (DSC-II), the limiting efficiency increases from 10.82% to 12.46%, which infers that transmission from the top cell played a major role in the overall conversion efficiency (see Fig. 24 (top)). Another simulation was done with changing the performance (Jsc and Voc) of the top cell without changing the transmittance value, which also shifted the limiting efficiencies to a higher value (see Fig. 24 (bottom)). Further investigations were also done to improve the optical transmittance of the top cell. UV-vis-NIR spectra showed that FTO was found to have a better optical transmittance than the ITO in the infra-red and near IR region; the result was supported by carrier density and mobility values using the Hall effect measurement.

DSC-I: transmittance of the DSSC is fixed; DSC-II: increase in transmittance of DSSC; Voc +0.1 V: increase in 0.1 V of the open circuit voltage for DSC-I, Jsc + 1 mA cm−2 and Jsc + 2 mA cm−2: increase in 1 and 2 mA cm−2 of the short-circuit current density for DSC-I.

Both cells were mechanically stacked together and electrically connected in series.125 Compared to the isolated cell conversion efficiency of 8.27% for DSSC and 11.71% for CIGS, the tandem cell showed a higher performance of 12.35% with an open circuit voltage of 1.435 V. Wavelength-dependent photocurrent generation was measured using the external quantum efficiency (EQE) method under AC and DC mode. Under DC mode, monochromatic light was irradiated continuously, but in AC mode, the beam was chopped with a shutter, where the chopper speed represented by hertz and the bias light intensity were varied. The authors observed that EQE of the bottom CIGS cell was almost independent of the bias light intensity and chopping frequency but the top DSSC was significantly affected by both of these values under AC mode.A high voltage tandem cell of around 1.8 V was reported by Ito et al. using mechanically stacked DSC as the top cell and GaAs/AlxGa(1−x)As graded cell (GGC) as the bottom cell as shown in Fig. 25.126 Usually, tandem cells suffer from the lower photocurrent density; it can be determined by the lower photocurrent of the top or bottom cells. Three different dyes such as D131, D102 and D205 were used as sensitizers in order to compare the photocurrent matching of top and bottom cells. All three tandem cells using the above dyes showed a high open circuit voltage of around 1.8 V but the tandem cell using the D131 dye showed the highest photocurrent density of around 5 mA cm−2. Since the same GGC was used in all three tandem cells, the Jsc value of GCC (filtered by DSC) varies between 4.88, 3.70 and 2.98 mA cm−2 for the D131, D102 and D205 sensitized DSC. This observation was supported by IPCE data, when changing the dyes from D131 to D102 and then D205, the IPCE peak of the DSC shifted to the longer wavelength and in turn affected the GGC absorbance in this region, which leads to a lower photocurrent in GGC (see Fig. 26). This lower Jsc value of the GGC cell influenced the overall performance of the tandem cell. Fig. 25  Schematic diagram of mechanically stacked series-connected DSSC/GGC tandem structure.

Recently, Hao and colleagues reported a hybrid hydrogenated amorphous silicon/DSSC tandem cell with an overall efficiency of 8.31%, Voc of 1.45 V and Jsc of 10.61 mA cm−2.127 In this setup, a-silicon solar cell had been placed as the top cell and a dye-sensitized TiO2 as the bottom cell with ZnO/Pt as the interlayer as illustrated in Fig. 27. Due to the same absorption range of a-Si:H (400–800 nm) in the top cell and N719 (400–700 nm), N749 (400–800 nm) dyes in the bottom cell, the tandem structure did not show better efficiency. The authors suggested that the dyes with a long absorption wavelength (around 920 nm) will absorb the wide range of solar spectrum and will increase the overall conversion efficiency. The photovoltaic parameters of various tandem DSSCs combined with inorganic solar cells are summarized in Table 2.

Conclusion and future outlookWe have briefly summarized the research attempts moving forward to obtain a full spectrum of sunlight. Each experiment looked at in this review has pros and cons. For instance, utilizing multi-layers of dye may enhance the broad absorption of the solar spectrum; however, an increase in thickness of the layer highly limited the efficiency of the cell. The use of a black dye showed an increase in performance proportional to the thickness of the layer up to 20 μm, but most of the working electrodes containing other dyes illustrate an efficiency plateau at around 12 μm. When the thickness is higher than this limit, the electrons do not survive to the contact; therefore, no electron gains are expected. Note that the TiO2 film made of commercially available nanoparticles (NPs) show a diffusion length of electrons ranging from 8.5 to 12.5 μm depending on the size of NPs.128,129 Since there are many interactions between dyes and the TiO2 surface, changing of dyes can affect the open circuit voltage as well. When the open circuit voltages (Voc) produced by different dyes do not match each other, the flow of electrons may not reach the FTO contact, instead they drop inside the multilayer. Therefore, the matching of Voc is a critical factor when it comes to choose suitable dyes for the panchromatic application. Although a few structures consist of molecular level tandem, there could be more possibilities, for example, inserting smaller dye molecules between the large dye molecules on the surface of TiO2 particles. Once the smaller dyes occupy empty space between dyes, they will also work like an additive such as pyridine derivatives.A tandem DSSC consisting of two cells made from different dyes are mechanically stacked together and electrically connected either in series (S-TDSSC) or in a parallel (P-TDSSC) manner. S-TDSSC shows a summation of Voc of both the cells, but the current density is limited by the serious mismatch among the two devices. But in the case of P-TDSSC, the phenomenon occurs in a reverse manner, Jsc is higher and Voc is limited by the mismatching of both cell values. The p–n tandem DSSC consists of dye-sensitized photocathode and photoanode, which are electrically connected in series, showing a high open circuit voltage. But, an efficient sensitizer, p-type photocathode materials and suitable redox electrolytes need to be developed for the higher conversion efficiency. Tandem cells made of DSSC combined with other thin film solar cells show much higher efficiency. When these cells are stacked using either a mechanical or monolithic pattern, the transparency and photovoltaic parameters of the top cell plays an important role in the overall conversion efficiency. In addition, monolithic design consisting of the bottom CIGS cell has been suffered by the leakage of corrosive electrolyte from the top DSSC. Therefore, a highly efficient DSSC with all solid state components will be the best way to realize a new tandem structure for DSSC applications. Recently, there have been a few reports showing the solid structure of DSSC with comparable efficiency values.130 When these structures are optimized, studies on conventional repeating tandem structure with either a tunnel junction or terminal junction will be successfully carried out shortly. An alternative to the tandem approach, recently, dye-sensitized upconverter materials, have also been developed in order to convert the low energy NIR light into high energy visible light.131 The application of highly efficient upconverter materials to the DSSC could be an effective way to utilize the broader solar spectrum.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by the MEST & MKE (2012K001288, 20110030361, 20110030211 and 20123010010070).Notes and referencesW.
