    , Accepted 7th June 2021First published on 7th June 2021AbstractThe performance of organic solar cells based on nonfullerene acceptors is improving rapidly and nowadays the power conversion efficiencies of single-junction devices have achieved over 18%. Nonfullerene acceptors usually consist of electron-rich units and electron-deficient units, and the interaction between these two parts can widen the optical absorption, tune the energy levels and improve the film morphologies of acceptor materials. Among the various electron-withdrawing groups, cyano groups have been most used in the construction of electron-deficient units for nonfullerene acceptors. In this review, the electron-deficient units containing cyano groups for nonfullerene electron acceptors have been summarized, and the effects of these electron-deficient units on the photoelectric properties and photovoltaic performance of acceptor materials have been elaborated to extract some effective molecular design strategies for high-performance acceptor materials.

Introduction
With the increasing depletion of fossil energy and the environmental pollution caused by fossil energy, people are moving forward in exploring renewable and clean energy including solar energy, wind energy, hydropower and ocean energy, etc.1,2 To some extent, all the other energy resources are derived from the sun.3,4 Solar energy can be converted into electrical energy based on solar cells.5 Relative to inorganic solar cells, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs)6 exhibit distinct superiorities of low cost, light weight and mechanical flexibility.7–20
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs are dependent on the performance of the active layer materials (Fig. 1 donor and acceptor materials). A series of polymer and small molecules have been designed as donor materials.21–34 Some donor materials discussed in this review are shown in Fig. 2 and the photoelectric data are summarized in Table 1. However, the development of acceptor materials has lagged behind the progress of donor materials for quite a long time. In the first twenty years of the development of acceptor materials, fullerene derivatives (e.g.PC61BM and PC71BM) with high electron affinity and charge transfer capability have always been in the monopoly position,35–40 but obvious drawbacks of fullerene acceptor materials, including weak and narrow absorption, poor tunability of chemical structures and energy levels, and low stability, have restrained the development of organic photovoltaic technology. To overcome these issues, the exploration of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials has been started since the early 21st century.22,41–53 Only in recent years have NFA materials become fully capable of outcompeting fullerene acceptors.54–56 Nowadays, the highest PCE of single-junction OSCs based on NFAs has exceeded 18%.57 It is conceivable that the future potential of NFAs will be unlimited.

NFAs usually employ one or more electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units to construct diverse conjugated backbones such as D–A, A–D–A, D–A–D and so on (Fig. 1). The electron push–pull effects between the electron donor and electron acceptor units can improve charge transfer and extend optical absorption. All the units of the materials play key roles in improving the photovoltaic performance of acceptor materials. Electron donor moieties in most cases are made up of electron-rich aromatic rings. Electron acceptor moieties are always electron-deficient heterocyclic rings58 or other electron-deficient compounds with selected electron-withdrawing groups.59–65 Typical electron-withdrawing groups are cyano, carbonyl, amide, imide groups, etc. In contrast to multifarious electron donor backbones, the progress of electron acceptor backbones lags behind. Through interacting with electron donor units, electron acceptor units play a significant role in tuning the optical absorption ranges, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and film morphology.
In this review, we will focus on electron acceptor units with the electron-withdrawing cyano groups (Fig. 3). Cyano groups have high electron-withdrawing capabilities due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect and conjugative effect.76,77 Cyano groups were initially used to modify the donor materials, especially poly(alkylthiophenes) or oligothiophenes.78–80 Early results showed that CN can decrease the reorganization energy of oligomers, which probably improves the hole mobility abilities of polymers. Compared with other electron-withdrawing groups, cyano groups have much stronger electron-accepting abilities. Stemming from these early results, cyanation has been widely employed in perfecting the photoelectric properties of n-type organic semiconductor materials.81–86 Cyano groups can not only broaden the light absorption ranges of the materials and extend the π-conjugation areas of molecules but also enhance the intermolecular interaction and improve the π–π stacking to elevate charge mobility. Herein, we aim to highlight the cyano groups in NFAs and elaborate on the effects of these units with various electron-withdrawing abilities on the photoelectric properties of NFAs and the overall performance of OSCs.

1. Progress on the NFAs with various electron-deficient units
1.1 NFAs based on simple CN groups as electron-withdrawing units
Single CN group can transport electrons from electron donors to acceptors. An early material design strategy involves connecting one or more CN groups directly to electron-rich aromatic rings. Sellinger group reported the NFA SMA1 containing four CN groups (Fig. 4).87SMA1 showed strong absorption from 300 to 520 nm with two maximum absorption peaks at 337 nm and 448 nm. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.87/−3.49 eV, calculated from electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV), which matches the energy level of P3HT. The OSCs using P3HT/SMA1 as the active layer gave the PCE of 0.45%, which was the best performance of OSCs using P3HT71 as the donor and small molecules as the acceptors for that time (Table 2). Subsequently, various polymer donor materials were employed to blend with SMA1 or SMA2 (the SMA1 analogue) to improve the PCE up to 1.4% (Fig. 4).72,88–90 Malliaras and Anthony prepared a series of cyanopentacenes (Fig. 4, SMA3–SMA8).91,92 It is easy to tune LUMO and HOMO energy levels through the introduction of different numbers of CN groups (Table 2). The LUMO and HOMO energy levels decreased with the increase of the CN group number. The highest PCE of 1.29% was obtained via the morphological tuning of the P3HT/SMA8 blend. Malliara also concluded that the performance of SMA8 was far better as compared to its analogues with other electron-withdrawing substituents at the same position.92 Similarly, the efficiencies of devices based on CN group end-capped SMA15 are more than 10 times higher than that of CF3 group end-capped SMA16.93 In 2009, Pei et al. developed a series of fluoranthene-based n-type semiconductor materials (Fig. 4). The LUMO energy of SMA9–SMA14 can be easily tuned by introducing imide and cyano groups onto the two ends of fluoranthene.94,95 The OSCs-based SMA11 achieved the highest PCE of 2.90%. Other CN groups end-capped NFAs SMA17–SMA21 (Fig. 4) with various central cores were also blended with P3HT;85,96 the device results are summarized in Table 2.

The electron-withdrawing ability of a single CN group is limited, so all these NFAs mentioned above have wide bandgaps, which is not beneficial for obtaining high circuit current density (Jsc) for OSCs.
1.2 NFAs based on dicyanovinyl groups as electron-withdrawing units
An early commonly used strategy for the development of D−A type NFAs is to directly connect dicyanovinyl (DCV) groups with electric-rich units; for example, carbazole, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole, benzodithiophene, oligothiophene (Fig. 5). This design strategy created NFAs with wide absorption and narrow optical bandgaps. Tian and coworkers reported such an acceptor, SMA22,97 with a wide absorption in the 300-600 nm region and high LUMO energy (−3.42 eV). The OSCs devices using P3HT as the donor gave high Voc but unsatisfactory PCE due to the low electron mobility of SMA22 (Table 3). Wang et al. replaced the carbonyl groups of quinacridone with DCV groups to obtain acceptor materials SMA23–SMA25. By making this modification, the intramolecular charge transfer was obviously improved and the materials showed red-shifted absorptions.83 The best OSCs based on P3HT/SMA24 gave a PCE of 1.57%. Under the same conditions, the photovoltaic performances of cell devices based on SMA24 were better than the control devices based on PCBM. Similarly, the Nielsen group developed two truxene-based acceptor materials SMA26 and SMA27 through substituting DCV for the carbonyl groups of truxenone.98 The 3-hexyl-2-thienyl substituent in SMA27 is more twisted than the 5-hexyl-2-thienyl substituent in SMA26, which led to the higher HOMO energy levels for SMA26. Whether using SubPc67 or ZnPc68 as donors, the performances of bilayer cell devices based on SMA26 were superior to those based on SMA27 (Table 3). In 2014, Chandrasekharam employed phenothiazine derivatives as electron donor units flanked with the DCV group to obtain a small molecule acceptor, SMA28.99 Phenothiazine is widely used as an electron donor unit due to its N and S atoms with strong electron-donating abilities. Through fabrication technology improvement, the device efficiency was increased from 1.75% to 4.16%.

Besides D–A type NFAs, the A–D–A type structure is also a common design strategy for NFAs. In 2015, Roncali and coworkers synthesized an A–D–A type NFA SMA29 using benzodithiophene as the central core and dicyanovinyl as end groups.100 The intramolecular interactions were obviously improved through connection with DCV. The all-small-molecule OSCs device using TCN66 as the donor presented a PCE of 0.24% (Table 3). Other similar DCV end-capped A–D–A NFAs SMA30–SMA34 with different central cores (dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole, silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and fluorinated oligothiophenes) were synthesized by Ma101 and Duan et al.102 Through comparing the energy levels of SMA30, SMA31 and SMA32, it was found that the central cores could not affect the LUMO levels and the different cores would make slight changes in the HOMO levels. SMA34 and SMA35 have low energy levels because of the weak electron-donating abilities of the fluorinated oligothiophenes. When blended with PTB7-Th,73 the OSCs devices based on SMA34 gave high Voc > 1 V and PCE of 4.5% (Table 3).
1.3 NFAs based on the alkyl cyanoacetate group as electron-withdrawing units
The alkyl cyanoacetate group was obtained by replacing one cyano group with an ester group. On the one hand, using alkyl cyanoacetate groups as electron-withdrawing units for NFAs can elevate the LUMO energy of the materials to improve the Voc of devices; on the other hand, introducing ester groups with alkyl chains can increase the solubility of NFAs. At first, alkyl cyanoacetate groups were extensively applied in small donor materials.103–105 In 2014, Li et al. reported an octyl cyanoacetate group end-capped NFA SMA35 with benzothiadiazole as a center core and oligothiazoles as π-spacers (Fig. 6).106 The cell devices using a small molecule donor SF8TBT70 gave a high Voc of 1.24 V and low PCE of 0.21% due to the low Jsc and FF (Table 4). By replacing DCV groups with ethyl cyanoacetate groups, Nielsen synthesized three truxene-based NFAs, SMA36–SMA38, containing different numbers of ethyl cyanoacetate groups.107 Compared with SMA26 containing DCV groups, SMA36–SMA38 had higher LUMO energy levels due to the slightly weaker electron-withdrawing ability of cyanoacetate groups. However, the number of ethyl cyanoacetate groups could not affect the LUMO levels of SMA36–SMA38. The high LUMO energy level is beneficial to the enhancement of Voc.107

In 2015, Lim and coworkers reported two ethyl cyanoacetate groups end-capped A–D–A type NFAs SMA39 and SMA40 with carbazole or fluorine as central cores, respectively (Fig. 6).108 The optimized devices based on P3HT/SMA39 produced a PCE of 1.03% with the following photovoltaic parameters: Voc of 1.00 V, Jsc of 2.34 mA cm−2 and FF of 44%. The OSCs devices with the P3HT/SMA40 blend achieved a Voc of 1.03 V, Jsc of 2.82 mA cm−2, FF of 44% and PCE of 1.26%. On replacing carbazole or fluorine with naphthalene diimide, NFA SMA41 exhibited low energy levels owing to the weak electron donor ability of naphthalene diimide. Through blending with P3HT at a ratio of 1:1.2 (P3HT:SMA41), the cell devices achieved a high PCE of 4.03%.109
Fabricating ternary OSCs is a common strategy for the improvement of the efficiency and stability of OSCs.110–113 In this context, one donor material is usually blended with two acceptor materials to fabricate ternary OSCs.114–117 It is crucial to design the third acceptor to tune the charge transfer and film morphology.113 Recently, the Cui group synthesized one NFA SMA42 with indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the donor motif, fluorinated phenyl as π-bridges and alkyl cyanoacetate as end groups (Fig. 6). Although SMA42 behaved badly in the binary OSCs devices using PBDB-T as the donor, SMA42 became the perfect third acceptor introduced into the binary OSCs118 based on PBDB-T:IE4F-S. Through introducing 20% SMA42 into the binary blend, both the efficiency and stability of ternary devices were greatly improved.119 Compared with the PCE of the binary device based on PBDB-T:IE4F-S, the PCE of ternary OSCs devices was increased from 13.07% to 15.06%. In terms of the stability of the devices, the ternary device maintained 81% of the initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous thermal aging at 60 °C relative to the binary devices (71.7% of the initial efficiency). Similarly, the ternary devices showed better photoinduced stability.
1.4 NFAs based on malononitrile-substituted benzothiadiazoles (BM) as electron-withdrawing units
Benzothiadiazoles (BT) as electron-deficient aromatic rings have high electron affinities, and are widely exploited backbones in organic semiconductors.120–122 In order to further elevate the electron-withdrawing ability of the BT unit, a successful method is to introduce one dicyanovinyl group onto the BT unit. In early studies, this electron-withdrawing backbone often appeared in donor materials.123–125 Meredith et al. firstly prepared the NFA SMA43 with BM as the electron-withdrawing unit (Fig. 7).126–128 After annealing at 65 °C, the PCE of BHJ devices based on P3HT/SMA43 was increased from 0.04% for as-cast devices to 0.73% (Table 5). Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed that the crystal growth of SMA43 can be improved by annealing, which can increase the electron mobility of SMA43.128 Replacing fluorenes with thienosilole endowed SMA44 with a wider absorption and narrower optical bandgap. Without being annealed, the OSCs device achieved a higher PCE of 1.43% due to the increase of Jsc and FF.129

In 2015, Zhan group synthesized two BM end-capped A–D–A-type NFAs, SMA45 and SMA46, using the fused-ring unit IDT and indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) as electron donor cores, respectively (Fig. 7).130SMA46 showed a slightly red-shifted absorption in solution and in the solid state due to the stronger electron donor ability of IDTT, while the LUMO energy levels were the same. Solvent processing played a key role in improving their photovoltaic performances when using PBDTTTC-T74 as the donor. The PCE of PBDTTTC-T/SMA45 was increased from 3.79% to 4.26% on replacing the pure o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with o-DCB/CN (CN = 1-chloronaphthalene, o-DCB/CN = 100:6 (v/v)). Similarly, the PCE of SMA46-based devices increased up to 4.81% using the mixed solvent o-DCB/CF/DIO (CF = chloroform, o-DCB/CF/DIO = 60:40:3 (v/v)). AFM in the tapping mode and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) were used to probe the effects of solvent processing on the blend film morphologies. Compared with SMA45-based devices without CN additive, SMA45-based devices using CN additive showed slightly lower roughness, a smaller size but clearer phase separation, which is beneficial for the charge transport. Using o-DCB/CF/DIO as the solvent, PBDTTTC-T:SMA46 blend film showed larger domains and greater roughness. R-SoXS measurements indicated that the smaller and purer domains of the blend films can be obtained after solvent optimization. A similar molecule design strategy was adopted by Beaujuge who developed three BM-terminated NFAs using fluorene, carbazole, and cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as central cores (Fig. 7, SMA47–SMA49). SMA49 exhibited a significantly red-shifted absorption and a narrower bandgap because of the higher electron-donating capability of cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene.131 When blended with PTB7-Th, all the molecules demonstrated comparable photovoltaic levels with PCE of 5.1%, 5.3% and 5.0% for SMA47, SMA48 and SMA49, respectively.
Besides the fused ring design strategy, the non-fused ring design strategy for NFAs attracted more and more attention due to the molecular structure simplification and synthesis cost reduction. Recently Zhu and coworkers synthesized a simple-structured NFA SMA50 that combined BM as terminals, thiazolothiazole as the core and thiophene rings as π-bridges (Fig. 7).132 Using J7133 as the donor, the device parameters were Voc of 0.90 V, Jsc of 15.43 mA cm−2 and FF of 57%. The final PCE was up to 8.77%.
1.5 NFAs based on malononitrile-substituted rhodanines (RCN) as electron-withdrawing end groups
Rhodanine derivatives are commonly used dye molecules for organic semiconductor materials.58,77 Rhodanines as electron-deficient groups can improve electron transfer from donors to acceptors so as to widen the optical absorption and reduce the bandgap. The alkyl substitutions on the N atom of rhodanines play an important role in tuning the solubility of materials. Among the rhodanine derivatives, malononitrile-substituted rhodanines (RCN) have received considerably more attention in NFAs design. Replacing the S atom with malononitrile can increase the electron-accepting ability of the end groups for the improvement of intramolecular charge transfer.
After scanning the RCN-terminated NFAs, we concluded that there are three molecule design strategies for these NFAs: (1) three-dimensional (3D) twisted NFAs with more than two arms; (2) the A–A′–D–A′–A type, introducing other electron-withdrawing units between RCN and the cores; (3) the A–π–D–π–A type, inserting some aromatic rings as π-bridges between RCN and the cores.
In 2016, Chen reported a spirobifluorene-based NFA, SMA51, with four RCN terminals (Fig. 8). A 3D twisted geometry can avoid molecule over-aggregation and bring about suitable π–π stacking distances.133SMA51 showed a slightly broader absorption and lower LUMO energy than its analogue using 3-octylrhodanine as the terminals. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction measurements for the pure films of SMA51 and its analogue showed that replacing the S atom with the malononitrile group could disturb the co-facial stacking of the sub-molecule conjugated plan, leading to the low crystallinity of SMA51. After condition optimization, an efficiency of 4.48% was achieved. A similar molecule SMA52 was synthesized by Kelly et al. Using PTB7-Th as the donor, the OSCs based on SMA52 achieved a PCE of only 1.42% (Table 6).134 Other RCN-terminated 3D NFAs SMA53 and SMA54 can be obtained by using truxene as building blocks.135 The slight structural difference between SMA53 and SMA54 made a huge difference in their optical absorption. SMA53 showed a broader and stronger absorption with the optical absorption in the 300–600 nm region and the maximum absorption coefficient of 3.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In terms of cell devices, a higher Jsc of 16.49 mA cm−2 and PCE of 10.15% were achieved for the devices based on PTB7-Th/SMA53 (Table 6). In contrast, the PTB7-Th/SMA54-based OSCs gave a Jsc of 13.54 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 8.29% (Table 6).

Using A–A′–D–A′–A type molecules with two kinds of electron-withdrawing units as electron acceptor materials is becoming an effective means to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. This design strategy was also adopted for SMA52–SMA54 discussed above. The incorporation of two electron-withdrawing groups at the end of donor cores can further improve the charge transfer, extend conjugate length and lower the LUMO energy. A series of electron-deficient groups, including BT,134,136–139 benzotriazole,138,140 thiophene-fused benzothiadiazole,141,142 thiophene-fused benzotriazole141,142 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione143 have been incorporated as intermediate A′ units into RCN end-capped NFAs (Fig. 9, SMA55–SMA69). Here we do not want to lay out their photovoltaic data but there are two points that we want to recommend. (1) It is well-known that P3HT is by far the most promising electron donor material for future commercial applications due to its easy commercial mass synthesis and chemical stability.144–146 Such A–A′–D–A′–A NFAs, especially those using rhodanines and BT as conjoint end groups, are very appropriate acceptors blended with P3HT due to the matched LUMO–HOMO energy and complementary absorption.141,142,147,148 Nowadays, P3HT paired with such types of NFAs have given PCE surpassing 8%,149 which showed the huge potential of these NFAs in P3HT-based OSCs. (2) In addition to the above A′ building blocks, other electron-deficient aromatic rings143,150–152 can also be used as A′ moieties linked with other end groups. Therefore there is significant room for us to tune the molecule energy levels and absorption of these NFAs to match diverse donor materials.
 Fig. 9  Chemical structures of SMA55–SMA69, Ar = 4-hexylphenyl. 
Similar to the above design strategy, the incorporation of aromatic rings as π-bridges to connect cores and end groups is also an effective method for tuning the photoelectric properties of NFAs. The Zhu group inserted a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene group between IDT and RCN to obtain NFA SMA70 (Fig. 10). Through the addition of solvent additive and the adjustment of film thickness, the cell efficiency was obtained up to 10.07% (Table 6), which was the highest PCE value of OSCs devices using PTB7-Th as the donor for that time.153 Other similar NFAs SMA71 and SMA72 with different side chains also gave PCE values more than 10%.154 Other simple thiophene and thiazole π-bridges were also used to construct the NFAs of SMA73 and SMA74, respectively.155SMA74 showed deeper LUMO–HOMO energy values as compared to SMA73 due to the electron-withdrawing group of thiazole. Owing to the high Jsc and FF, SMA74 presented better photovoltaic performance with PCE of 8.71% (Table 6).
 Fig. 10  Chemical structures of SMA70–SMA76. 
Other types of RCN end-capped molecules were SMA75 and SMA76, developed by Sharma (Fig. 10).156,157 Both showed superior performance in all small molecule OSCs. The higher PCE of 9.05% was achieved using p-DINI-(FBTTTh3)269 as the donor blended with SMA76.
1.6 NFAs based on 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) and its derivatives as electron-withdrawing end groups
End group INCN was obtained by substituting one O atom of indanedione with the malononitrile group (Fig. 11). The electron-withdrawing ability of INCN was higher as compared to indanedione. In earlier stages, INCN was a common chromophoric group widely used in p-semiconductor materials for OSCs.158–161 Despite the brilliant performance of INCN as electron-accepting units in polymer and small molecule donor materials, INCN failed to attract our attention regarding their application in acceptor materials until 2015. At the end of 2014, Zhan group developed two INCN-terminated A–π–D–π–A-type NFAs (SMA77 and SMA78) with IDT as donor cores (Fig. 12).162,163 Their superior performance in OSCs showed their huge potential for combining fused-ring cores and INCN end groups in developing NFAs. It was later reported that the ITIC molecule (SMA79) using the extended fused-ring IDTT as the core showed enormous potential in challenging conventional fullerene acceptors (Fig. 12).54 A PCE of 6.80% was achieved when blended with PTB7-Th, which created a new record for OSCs based on nonfullerenes; hence, OSCs entered the fast track with the rapid development of ITIC derivatives.164–178

 Fig. 12  Chemical structures of SMA77–SMA90, Ar = 4-hexylphenyl. 
In this context, the structural modifications of INCN have made a huge contribution that could not be extinguished. The structural modifications of INCN have usually been focused on the phenyl group via two paths (Fig. 11). One is the substitution of one or more organic groups (halogen atoms, alkyls, alkoxyls) on the benzene ring and another is the replacement of the phenyl group with other aromatic rings (thiophene ring, naphthalene ring). The photoelectric performance could not easily be compared horizontally due to the different fabrication technologies with different donor materials. Here, we only want to elaborate on the effects of diverse end groups on the photoelectric properties and film morphologies of ITIC derivatives (Table 7).

(1) INCN class end groups with various substituents on the benzene ring.
(2) Naphthalene-based end groups.
(3) Thiophene-based end groups.
Substituting alkyl or alkoxyl groups onto the phenyl group of INCN can weaken the electron-withdrawing capability of end groups, thus promoting the LUMO energy of NFAs (Fig. 16). In 2016, Hou group acquired two methyl-substituted INCN.179 Relative to ITIC, the corresponding NFAs SMA80 and SMA81 exhibited different degrees of blue-shifted absorption. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements showed that both SMA80 and SMA81 exhibited edge-on as well as face-on orientations. The higher PCE of 12.05% was obtained through optimizing the cell devices based on PBDB-T/SMA80. In subsequent work, they introduced alkoxyl groups into the end groups to synthesize a series of ITIC analogues SMA82–SMA88 (Fig. 12). Both the substituent positions and the length of alkoxyl can affect the photoelectric properties of NFAs. There are four positions for the substitutions on the benzene ring of INCN. The substituent positions can greatly affect the photoelectric properties of materials due to the different resonance electron effects of different positions. The electron-withdrawing abilities of four methoxy-substituted INCN isomers are in the following order: DCI-1 < DCI-3 < DCI-4 < DCI-2 (Fig. 13); for this reason, SMA82 showed the highest LUMO energy.180 Different steric hindrance effects caused by different substitution positions may affect the molecule planarity and stacking.180 It was found from the GIWAXS measurements that SMA85 exhibited the strongest intermolecular aggregations owing to the low distortion of the terminal groups. The length of the side chains of end groups affected the solubility and aggregation behavior of NFAs (Fig. 12, SMA85–SMA88), which further affected the exciton diffusion and charge mobility.181 AFM images showed that the roughness of the blend film increased with the increase of the side chain length. Fibrillar-like aggregates were found in the blend films of PBDB-T:SMA87 and PBDB-T:SMA88. Besides straight alkyl chains, cyclic alkyl chains have also been exploited to modify INCN. Huang et al. reported NFA SMA90 with cyclohexyl-substituted INCN as end groups.182 Similar to straight alkyl chains, NFAs SMA90 exhibited higher LUMO energy than its analogue SMA89 with INCN as end groups. In terms of the film absorption, they had the same absorption edges but SMA90 showed stronger absorptions in the visible region.

Another modification path involves replacing the benzene ring with a naphthalene ring, thiophene ring, and so forth. The LUMO levels were almost unaffected but the optical absorption spectra can be broadened when using naphthalene-based end groups, which can increase the Jsc of the devices without causing the reduction of Voc.183–186 Interestingly, the LUMO energy and optical absorption of NFAs will change towards the opposite direction when slightly changing the structures of naphthalene-based end groups.186,194 Compared with ITIC, SMA95 showed a slightly lower LUMO energy level and red-shifted absorption, while the SMA96 isomer exhibited a higher LUMO energy level and blue-shifted absorption. For thiophene-based end groups, there was also a similar phenomenon worth discussing, where the effects on the photoelectric properties of NFAs (Fig. 14, SMA97–SMA104) were different based on the different thiophene-fused modes.187–192,195 In contrast to INCN, CPTCN can usually reduce the LUMO energy slightly and lead to the bathochromic absorption,187 while CPCN will elevate the LUMO energy and narrow the absorption.191 Recently, Yang group reported three isomeric NFAs (Fig. 14, SMA100–SMA102) with three brominated thiophene-based end groups (CPTCN-Br, CPTCN-Br1, CPTCN-Br2). These three isomeric end groups have similar backbones with different thiophene-fused modes and Br substitution positions, which lead to their different electron-withdrawing abilities.190 Among these isomers, SMA102 presented the lowest LUMO energy and narrowest bandgap. GIWAXS experiments were carried out to explore their molecule packing. In terms of the difference in the morphology of the neat film, SMA102 showed the tightest molecular stacking and strongest crystallinity; therefore when blended with PBDB-T-2F,75 the devices based on SMA102 achieved the highest Jsc and FF values.

The introduction of halogen atoms is a common means of tuning energy levels, optical absorption, crystallization and molecular stacking of organic semiconductor materials. This strategy has also been applied to the modification of INCN. In 2017, Zhan group firstly introduced F atom into INCN to obtain three new end groups. As the number of F atoms increased, the LUMO energy and optical bandgap of NFAs based on these fluoride end groups were reduced.196 F atoms can increase the electron-withdrawing ability, and enhance the interaction between the end groups and the central cores, thus widening and enhancing the optical absorption. On the other hand, difluoro substituted INCN can lead to much tighter packing of acceptor molecules owing to the increased interactions between the end groups.197 Therefore, difluoro-substituted INCN has become the state-of-the-art end group.198–208 The constantly refreshed device efficiencies were obtained by using ITIC derivatives based on this end group. To date, the highest PCE of 18.22% for single-junction OSCs was achieved by using D18 as the donor and SMA105 (Fig. 15, Y6) as the acceptor.57 SMA105, firstly reported by the Zou group,209 has become the most advanced acceptor for OSCs, and the birth of Y-series acceptors set off the second wave of the rapid development of OSCs.210–212 Apart from F atoms, Br and Cl atoms were also employed to tune the photoelectric properties of INCN.213,214 All the types, numbers and substitution positions of halogen atoms have important effects on the photovoltaic performance of NFAs.193,213–217 Tobin J. Marks made a detailed discussion in this respect through systemically comparing the chemical energy, bandgap, absorption, crystallinity and molecule stacking of NFAs (SMA79, SMA106–SMA109).193 End-group fluorination can effectively reduce the LUMO energy and narrow the optical bandgap, which is consistent with previous reports. Different end-group fluorination densities brought about evident differences in intermolecular stacking and molecule planarity. SMA109 had the shortest π–π distances while SMA108 presented relatively large torsions. GIWAXS measurements proved that SMA109 with the most F atoms had minimal crystallinity. However, the morphologies of the as-cast blend films did not show obvious differences and were not affected by the end-group. Besides halogen atoms, trifluoromethyl groups with stronger electron-withdrawing ability were also recently used to modify the INCN end group.216

From this, we can see that tiny structural modifications of INCN class end groups may lead to large changes in the photoelectric properties of NFAs, which provide more methods for the modification of these acceptors for better OSCs devices.
Summary and outlook
In the last five years, with the development of the ITIC class of NFAs, organic solar cells have been advancing at an astonishing speed. The breaking PCE is over 18%, which makes OSCs more competitive in solar cell applications. However, the structures of the INCN class end groups, especially the main electron-withdrawing groups (malononitrile and carbonyl), have not changed greatly from the advent of the star molecule ITIC to the birth of Y6. In contrast to the central cores boom, the development of end groups lags behind. Hence the focus of the next phase will be the study of other electron-deficient groups for the excellent performance of end groups, which will offer an effective “prescription” for the existing issues of the OSCs.
The development of NFAs has opened up the possibility for the commercial application of organic solar cells; however, the undeniable fact is that the common progress of donor materials, acceptor materials and device processing has contributed to the OSCs boom. Therefore more efforts need to be put into material and device engineering for promoting the commercial viability of OSCs.
