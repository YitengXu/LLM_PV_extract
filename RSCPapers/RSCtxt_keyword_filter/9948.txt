    , Accepted 28th October 2021First published on 5th November 2021AbstractHeteroaromatic units are commonly used as π-spacers for sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here, we investigated the influence of the π-spacer on the photophysical properties, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of carbazol-phenyl functionalized phenothiazine donor based organic dyes, i.e., CPPC-No (without a π-spacer), CPPC-Th (thiophene as the π-spacer), CPPC-Fu (furane as the π-spacer), CPPC-Ph (phenyl as the π-spacer) and CPPC-Py (pyridine as the π-spacer). The solar to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved with these dyes strongly depends on the type of π-spacer, increasing in the order of CPPC-Ph < No < Py < Th < Fu. The width of the absorption band and the photocurrent density increased with the electron richness of the π-spacer. Theoretical calculations indicated that the planar molecular configuration of CPPC-Fu promotes the intramolecular charge transfer process. As a result, the CPPC-Fu based device showed a PCE of 7.4% under one sunlight illumination. The dyes using thiophene and pyridine as π-spacers showed slightly lower performance, however, still significantly higher than the PCE achieved with the control compound lacking a π-spacer. By contrast, introducing a phenyl group as the π-spacer led to a decrease in device efficiency. These results give deeper insight into the effect of different π-spacers on DSSC performance, showing the importance of molecular engineering in developing high efficiency organic dyes.
Introduction
Since their invention by Grätzel and co-workers, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted widespread attention from both fundamental research and industry as a third-generation photovoltaic technology due to their ease and low-cost of preparation, semi-transparency, flexibility and versatility in color design as well as their potential for indoor application.1,2 The buildup of DSSCs includes a photoanode composed of a 3D array of nanoparticles of an oxide semiconductor such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), a photosensitizer (dye), a redox electrolyte and a counter electrode. The dye is one of the most critical components as it acts as a light harvester.2 Metal-free organic dyes have become a research hotspot because of their high molar extinction coefficients, tunable molecular structure and spectral properties, giving them great potential for large-scale photovoltaic power generation.3–11 To date, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 13% have been reported by using organic dyes as photosensitizers.12 Generally, organic sensitizers are designed with a donor–π-spacer–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration, because the push–pull effect between the donor and acceptor can improve the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process and enhance the photon-to-electron conversion.
Among the various donor moieties, phenothiazine (PTZ) and carbazole (Cz) derivatives have emerged as promising building blocks for dyes in DSSCs, due to their good electron-donating and hole-transporting abilities.13 A recently published review article provides a big database across the history of PTZ usage in DSSCs and gives a profound summary and prospects.14 The PCEs of DSSC devices using PTZ and Cz donors reached over 10%15 and 12%,16 respectively. To strengthen the ability of electron donation in a D–π–A dye for a more efficient ICT process, electron-rich functional groups can be chemically bonded to form one D-moiety.17 For instance, Zhu and co-workers introduced Cz into an indoline donor, which broadened the absorption spectrum into the NIR region and gave the dye appropriate ground and excited state energy levels, thereby optimizing the photovoltaic performance.18 Hou et al. synthesized two organic dyes containing an indoloquinoxaline grafted PTZ donor.19 These robust dyes presented good balance between the rigid planar structure of indoloquinoxaline and the butterfly conformation of PTZ resulting in excellent device properties, better than those based on a simple PTZ donor.
In terms of π-spacers for D–π–A dyes, phenyl20–22 as well as heteroarenes such as thiophene,20,22–24 furane,22,23 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT),25 cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT),25,26 benzothiadiazole,21,27 benzotriazole,28 quinoxaline29 and pyridine24 are commonly used. π-Spacers play a significant role in tuning the molecular conformation to improve dye loading, optimize molecular aggregation, and extend the absorption spectra response, eventually leading to better device performance.19,30–32 For example, Grätzel et al. reported D–π–A dyes employing EDOT and CPDT as π-spacers for DSSC application.25 It was found that in the EDOT dye, there was a significant twist between EDOT and the cyanoacrylic acid (CA) anchoring group, which could retard the ICT process hence leading to a poor extinction coefficient and inferior photovoltaic performance. In contrast, the device based on the CPDT π-spacer exhibited superior performance, owing to its planar structure and longer electron lifetime. In our previous work,33 we used the PTZ unit as the donor, the carbazol-phenyl unit as the functionalized group and CA as the acceptor. A phenyl group has been introduced as the π-spacer in ortho-, meta- and para-configurations between PTZ and CA, resulting in different photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as device performances. Thus, π-spacer selection plays an important role in designing highly efficient D–π–A organic sensitizers and expanding our dataset is of critical importance to inform future dye design.
To get a deeper understanding of the effect of different π-spacers on DSSC performance, we carried out a systematic study by installing π-spacers with different electric properties between a carbazol-phenyl functionalized phenothiazine donor and a CA acceptor. Four metal-free organic dyes, named CPPC-No (without a π-spacer), CPPC-Th (thiophene as the π-spacer), CPPC-Fu (furane as the π-spacer) and CPPC-Py (pyridine as the π-spacer) were designed and synthesized. In addition, our previously reported sensitizer CBPTZ-p33 employing an electron-neutral phenyl unit as the π-spacer was employed as a reference dye (CPPC-Ph). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to investigate the effect of π-spacers, with features covering electron-withdrawing to electron-donating, in PTZ-based sensitizers. The molecular structures of the five dyes are shown in Fig. 1. CPPC-Fu containing furane as the π-spacer exhibited a most red-shifted absorption peak, a strong molar extinction coefficient, a relatively planar molecular configuration, the best electron injection and good charge collection efficiencies as well as high dye loading, which lead to the best PCE of 7.36% under one sun illumination. These results clearly show that molecular engineering of π-spacers is a promising path to develop efficient sensitizers for DSSCs.

Results and discussion
Dye synthesis
The synthetic routes to obtain our CPPC dyes are shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized following a known procedure.13,33,34 The first target compound, CPPC-No, was synthesized by the Knoevenagel reaction of aldehyde 1 with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of acetic acid and ammonium acetate. The synthetic routes leading to dyes CPPC-Th and CPPC-Fu are similar, with the only difference being the employed π-spacer unit. They began with a Suzuki coupling reaction of compound 2 with (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid and (5-formylfuran-2-yl)boronic acid, respectively, to obtain compounds 3 and 4. Eventually, CPPC-Th and CPPC-Fu were synthesized via the Knoevenagel reaction of aldehydes 3 and 4 with cyanoacetic acid. The synthetic route to dye CPPC-Py started from a Miyaura reaction of compound 2 with bis(pinacolato)diboron to afford compound 5. In the next step, a Suzuki coupling reaction was carried out between compound 5 and 6-bromonicotinaldehyde to get compound 6. Finally, the Knoevenagel reaction of aldehyde 6 with cyanoacetic acid afforded the desired dye CPPC-Py. All key intermediates and the four final sensitizers were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of the new CPPC dyes in dichloromethane (DCM) and on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2 and their corresponding spectroscopic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the five dyes exhibit two major absorption regions in DCM solvent. The one between 300 and 400 nm originates from a localized π–π* transition. Another absorption band located at longer wavelengths is attributed to the ICT process. The dye CPPC-No without a π-spacer shows the highest molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 21587 M−1 cm−1 at 469 nm. The dye CPPC-Fu with an electron-rich furane unit as the π-spacer shows the most red-shifted absorption peak at 481 nm as well as a comparable ε of 21354 M−1 cm−1, which portends that DSSC devices based on CPPC-Fu could achieve a higher photocurrent due to its better light absorption. After being adsorbed onto the TiO2 film, the absorption spectra of all the dyes are blue-shifted, which may be attributed to H-aggregates or deprotonation of the carboxylic acid.25,35

In order to investigate the energy level variation resulting from the different π-spacers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out with dye-coated TiO2 films using an acetonitrile (ACN) electrolyte solution. The curves are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding data are displayed in Table 1. Fig. 4 gives a visual summary of the schematic energy level diagrams. For CPPC-No, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, calculated from its first oxidation potential (Eox), is found to be −5.36 eV vs. vacuum. After introducing π-spacers, the HOMO levels of the other four CPPC dyes rise by more than 0.1 eV and are in the range of −5.26 to −5.22 eV vs. vacuum. These HOMO levels are still more negative than the redox potential of I−/I3− (−4.8 eV vs. vacuum), ensuring sufficient regeneration of the oxidized dyes. The energy gaps (Eg) of the five dyes were determined from the onset wavelength of the absorption spectra. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the dyes with a π-spacer are calculated using the equation ELUMO = Eox + Eg, and they show a small upshift compared to CPPC-No except for CPPC-Ph which exhibits a significantly larger upshift. The high LUMO level of CPPC-Ph has its origin in a hypsochromic shift of the absorption spectra. The LUMO levels of these dyes are all found to be above the TiO2 conduction band (CB, −4.0 eV vs. vacuum), i.e., all dyes have enough driving force for electron injection from the dye into TiO2.

Theoretical calculations
To get an insight into the relative energies of the HOMO and LUMO levels, as well as the molecular configuration of CPPC dyes, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian 09 package. Fig. 5 shows the molecular orbital distributions and energies of CPPC dyes. The HOMOs of CPPC dyes are located mainly on the carbazol-phenyl functionalized phenothiazine donor moieties, and the LUMOs localize mainly on the π-spacer and the CA anchoring group. Moreover, the HOMO−1 of CPPC-No and CPPC-Fu is delocalized over the whole donor part, while it is only distributed over the Cz unit for CPPC-Ph, CPPC-Th and CPPC-Py. This indicates a more efficient charge transfer process from the donor to the CA acceptor in CPPC-No and CPPC-Fu due to better orbital overlap. Fig. S1† displays the TD-DFT calculated absorption spectra of CPPC dyes, which show good agreement with experimental absorption properties as discussed above. CPPC-Fu exhibits the widest absorption spectrum and most red-shifted absorption peak, meanwhile an almost highest ε.

Table 2 exhibits a selection of critical dihedral angles of CPPC dyes in a vacuum, where α and β are the dihedral angles between the donor and the π-spacer unit, as well as between the π-spacer unit and acceptor, respectively. The CA acceptor shows good coplanarity with the carbazol-phenyl functionalized PTZ donor in CPPC-No without a π-spacer. After introducing the π-spacer units into the molecule, furane and pyridine show good coplanarity with both the donor and the acceptor, enabling efficient charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor in CPPC-Fu and CPPC-Py. However, the thiophene and phenyl units exhibit large dihedral angles of 20° and 32° with the donor group in CPPC-Th and CPPC-Ph, respectively, which is detrimental for the intramolecular charge transfer process. The insulating effect of the phenyl π-spacer has also been reported by Bodedla et al.20

Previous studies have shown that there exists a shift of the chemical potential at the organic–inorganic interface in DSSCs due to the dipole inherently present in the adsorbed dye molecules.33,36,37 The shift of the energy level of the conduction band edge can be expressed as ΔECB = −qμxγ/ε0ε,37,38 where q is the elementary charge, γ is the dye concentration at the surface, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, ε is the dielectric constant of the organic monolayer and μx is the dipole moment vertical to the TiO2 surface.
The positive μx values of CPPC-No and CPPC-Ph are expected to upshift the CB of TiO2 and increase the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of the DSSCs employing these dyes. The negative μx values of the other three dyes are likely to downshift the CB.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The current density–voltage (I–V) curves of DSSCs based on CPPC dyes with iodide electrolyte are shown in Fig. 6(a). The best performances based on 8 solar cells with each dye are listed in Table 3 and the statistical data of all the devices are plotted in Fig. S2.† The device based on CPPC-No without a π-spacer shows a PCE of 6.36% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 10.1 mA cm−2, a VOC of 744 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.81. After introducing π-spacers into the molecule, the JSCs of the devices increase in the order of CPPC-Ph < CPPC-Py < CPPC-Th < CPPC-Fu, which is in good agreement with their absorption spectra. The device based on CPPC-Fu with furane as the π-spacer exhibits the highest JSC of 12.60 mA cm−2, resulting in the best PCE of 7.36%. Meanwhile, the VOCs of the devices based on the dyes with π-spacers decrease in the order of CPPC-Ph > CPPC-Fu > CPPC-Py > CPPC-Th. In addition, the dark currents of the devices increase in the order CPPC-Ph ≈ CPPC-Fu < CPPC-Th < CPPC-Py, indicating less charge recombination at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte in CPPC-Ph and CPPC-Fu based devices, which contributes to this VOC trend.25,39,40 Compared to the device with dye CPPC-No, comprising no π-spacer, the VOCs of devices based on the dyes with a π-spacer decrease. This phenomenon has been summarized by Buene and co-workers and explained as increased protonation and a low CB of the TiO2 in devices with dyes containing π-spacers.14 It could be expected for other simple spacers, such as pyrrole,41 pyridazine,42 thiazole,43 in view of the similar molecular and electronic structure of these phenyl analogues. Fig. S3 and S4† show that the current dynamic plots of devices with different light intensities exhibit good linear behavior and flat plateaus, respectively, which suggests a good mass transport of the iodide redox couple within the liquid electrolyte.25,44,45

Although the device efficiencies in this work are not high enough compared with many published reports, considering the promising new dye structure proved by the relatively high device results in PTZ-based dyes, this work is very valuable. And high device efficiencies can be expected by careful device structure/component engineering, which is our next future work. Specifically, our systematic work, including careful molecule design and mechanism study, gives deeper insight into the structure–function relationship of the π-spacer on DSSC performances and provides guidance for future research. In general, the furane moiety is less efficient and less used than the thiophene group as the π-spacer in DSSC dyes.14,17 However, in this study, the devices based on the furane spacer show superior performance to those based on thiophene, e.g., higher JSC and VOC. Via investigation, we found that the higher JSC can be attributed to better light capture capability of the furane based dye originating from a better coplanarity structure as disclosed in the theoretical section. Additionally, the relatively positive μx value of furane dye is supposed to upshift the CB of TiO2 and responds to the higher VOC achieved. Compared to the reported dyes with a similar structure whereas no additional Cz moiety is attached,22 our CPPC dyes improve the overall device performance, mainly due to the successful reduction of the dye energy gap to extend the light absorption by the Cz moiety.

Fig. 6(b) shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra based on the CPPC dyes with iodide electrolyte, as well as the integrated JSC values, which are consistent with the trend of measured JSCs. The CPPC-Ph based device shows an IPCE plateau of 80% which is higher than the plateaus reached by the other CPPC dyes. However, CPPC-Th, CPPC-Fu and CPPC-Py based devices exhibit broader IPCE plateaus, which are in accordance with the corresponding absorption spectra as well as their short-circuit current densities. We analyzed the governing factors behind JSC using the equation JSC = ∫IPCEdλ = ∫LHE × ηinj × ηcolldλ(1)where LHE is the light-harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the electron injection efficiency and ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency.37,46
The LHE can be calculated from the absorption spectra of dye-coated TiO2 films by LHE = 1–10−A, where A is the absorbance of the dye. Fig. S5† depicts the LHEs, and the total number of absorbed photons under AM 1.5G of these dyes (CPPC-No/Th/Fu/Ph/Py) is 5.95, 6.47, 6.13, 4.05 and 6.21 × 1016 cm−2 s−1, respectively, as calculated by the integration of the product of LHE and photon flux spectra under AM 1.5G. CPPC-Fu, CPPC-Th and CPPC-Py show better photon absorption capacities, which is in good agreement with the JSC data. For CPPC-Ph, the onset wavelength of its LHE response is located at around 600 nm, and the integral is about 30% lower than that of the other dyes.
Photoluminescence studies
To investigate the ηinj of the photoexcited dye into the TiO2 photoanode, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL, Fig. S6†) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL, Fig. 7) based on dye-coated TiO2 as well as Al2O3 films were investigated. Al2O3 films were chosen as a control system due to the absence of a matched energy level for electron injection. TRPL data were fitted using a bi-exponential decay function. The decay times (τ) and corresponding amplitudes (A) are shown in Table 4. The τav of all the sensitized TiO2 films is much shorter than those of the sensitized Al2O3 films, because of quenching of the dye excited state by electron injection into the TiO2 film. Values for ηinj can be calculated from ηinj = 1 − τdye/TiO2/τdye/Al2O310,47,48 and are listed in Table 4. CPPC-Fu exhibits the highest electron injection efficiency and CPPC-Ph the lowest. The dyes using electron-rich π-spacers (thiophene and furane) and an electron-deficient π-spacer (pyridine) achieve more than 85% ηinj, likely leading to an improved photocurrent.

Charge collection efficiency and charge extraction measurements
Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements were used to analyze charge collection and charge recombination. ηcoll, charge transport lifetimes (τtr) and charge recombination lifetimes (τrec) of our DSSC devices are shown in Fig. 8(a) and S7.†ηcoll was determined from τtr and τrec by ηcoll = τrec/(τtr + τrec).10,49 Under the same LED bias, the ηcoll decreases in the following order: CPPC-No > CPPC-Ph > CPPC-Fu > CPPC-Th ≥ CPPC-Py. The higher ηcoll for CPPC-No and CPPC-Ph is mainly due to a longer charge recombination lifetime.
 Fig. 8  (a) Charge collection efficiency and (b) charge extraction spectra of DSSC devices based on CPPC dyes. 
The CPPC-Fu device shows the highest JSC values due to the “Cask Effect”, because the following parameters (light harvesting capacity, coplanarity molecular structure, electron injection efficiency, charge collection efficiency and dye loading) are synergistically responsible for its best performance, though some specific parameters from other dye-based devices are higher.

V
OC is another critical factor for device efficiency. The maximum attainable VOC (VOC,max) is determined by the difference between the Nernst potential of the redox couple in the electrolyte (Eredox) and the Fermi level of the TiO2 photoanode (EFn). VOC,max can therefore be expressed as: (2)where k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge, T is the sample temperature, ECB is the energy level of the conduction band edge, n is the density of free electrons and NCB is the effective density of states in the TiO2 semiconductor.37,50 This is the maximum VOC that a DSSC with a certain photoanode and electrolyte can reach if there is no non-radiative recombination. Since we use the same electrolyte throughout this study, a difference in EFn is one of the determining factors for VOC,max. Further, T and NCB are constant, and thus ECB and n are the quantities determining VOC,max.
Charge extraction at open-circuit was measured as a function of light intensity for complete devices. For a certain extracted charge (Fig. 8(b)), DSSCs employing CPPC-No and CPPC-Ph show a positive voltage shift compared to the other dyes. Consequently, the CB edge of the devices based on CPPC-No and CPPC-Ph exhibits an upwards shift, hence increasing VOC.
As mentioned in the DFT section, the positive dipole moments of CPPC-No and CPPC-Ph lead to an up-shift of the CB edge whereas the negative dipole moments of the other three dyes lead to a down-shift of the CB edge with respect to the redox potential of the electrolyte.
To get more insight into the VOC losses associated with non-radiative charge recombination, we perform both transient photovoltage measurements to determine the electron lifetime and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to determine the charge recombination resistance. As shown in Fig. S7(b),† the longer electron lifetimes indicate a reduced interfacial charge recombination for CPPC-No and CPPC-Ph.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
EIS was carried out to investigate the interfacial charge transfer kinetics of DSSCs under dark conditions at bias potentials between 0.48 and 0.76 V. Fig. S8† presents the Nyquist plots and Fig. 9(a) shows the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface Rct and the chemical capacitance Cchem. The latter relates to the density of states accessible to electrons in the TiO2. The electron lifetime (τn) calculated by τn = Rct × Cchem is shown in Fig. 9(b). A higher Rct, and therefore a longer τn suggest less charge recombination which is in good agreement with the higher VOC. Thus, both the Rct and τn decrease in the following order: CPPC-Ph > CPPC-No > CPPC-Fu > CPPC-Th ≈ CPPC-Py, which is similar to the results from transient photovoltage measurements.

Operational stability evaluation
Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) was utilized to analyze the operational stability of these DSSC devices. To the best of our knowledge, although MPPT is often employed in perovskite solar cells,51,52 this work is the first try in DSSC investigation, which is expected to benefit the DSSC assessment via unified stability tests under realistic operational conditions. Fig. 10 depicts the variation of PCE, FF, JSC and VOC as a function of time (h) for DSSCs with champion dye CPPC-Fu over a period of 500 h under illumination. The device retains 95% of its original PCE over 500 h solar light exposure, demonstrating the high operational stability of CPPC-Fu based DSSC devices. Fig. S9† proves the stability of the prototype DSSCs with CPPC dyes over a period of 1000 h in ambient air at room temperature. It can be seen that the PCEs maintain more than 97% of their initial values for CPPC-No, CPPC-Fu and CPPC-Py, and 90% of their initial values for CPPC-Th and CPPC-Ph at the end of the test, thereby confirming the long-term shelf stability of the CPPC devices.

Conclusions
A systematic study of different π-spacers for organic D–π–A dyes for DSSCs has been carried out. Thiophene, furane, phenyl and pyridine have been selected as π-spacers. The devices based on the dyes CPPC-No/Th/Fu/Ph/Py achieved efficiencies of 6.4%, 6.9%, 7.4%, 6.3% and 6.8%, respectively, with high stability. Introducing electron rich units as π-spacers was beneficial for improving the device performance. CPPC-Fu with furane as the π-spacer showed the highest PCE, and it exhibited the most red-shifted absorption peak as well as a strong molar extinction coefficient. Theoretical calculations indicated that the planar molecular configuration of CPPC-Fu promoted the intramolecular charge transfer process. Having the highest electron injection efficiency, a good charge collection efficiency as well as high dye loading CPPC-Fu led to an increased JSC. However, the downshift of the CB edge, a low free charge carrier density and a higher charge recombination rate led to a decreased VOC of this dye compared to CPPC-No. Moreover, the furane spacer shows better effects on DSSC performance than thiophene, with superior JSC and VOC values. Another conclusion is that the introduction of a π-spacer into donor–acceptor dyes was not always advantageous for device performance as was demonstrated with the CPPC-Ph dye. It is supposed that similar effects of different π-spacers on DSSC performances should occur when other donors/π-spacers/acceptors are grafted in a dye molecule; this study will afford experience for future work on molecule design. In summary, molecular engineering of a dye's π-spacer holds promise for the development of novel high efficiency organic sensitizers for DSSCs.

Methods and instrumentation

Characterization of new compounds. 

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Ultra Shield Plus 400 MHz or 100 MHz spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was performed on a 6530 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS.


Photophysical measurements. 
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 500 spectrometer (Varian, USA). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog Spectrofluorometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured via time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) using a LifeSpec II (Edinburgh Instruments) fluorescence spectrometer with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-510, Edinburgh Instruments) at 510 nm wavelength and 85 ps pulse width.


Electrochemical measurements. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed with a potentiostat (BioLogic SP300) using a three-electrode system. The 4 μm dye-adsorbed TiO2 film, carbon rod and aqueous Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) served as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. 0.1 M LiTFSI in dry ACN served as the electrolyte solution. The glassy carbon electrode served as the working electrode when ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was tested, and this result was used as an internal reference.


Theoretical calculations. 
The geometry optimization and frontier molecular orbital studies were performed using density functional theory (DFT) with the Gaussian 09 program under Becke's 3-parameters employing the Lee–Yang–Perdew function (B3LYP) with the 6-31G(d) basis set.53–55 Properties of electronic excitations were determined using time-resolved density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the Gaussian 09 program with the same functional and basis set.

DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements

DSSC fabrication. 
The DSSCs were fabricated following a literature procedure.10,56 Fluorine-doped tin-oxide glass (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass, 10 Ω sheet resistance) was cleaned with detergent solution, acetone and ethanol, respectively, followed by 15 min UV/O3 treatment. The FTO glass was immersed in a 50 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 45 min, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol. The 16 μm TiO2 photoanode, including a 12 μm light-absorption layer and 4 μm thick light-scattering layer, was coated onto FTO by screen printing. Then, the film was gradually heated in air on a hotplate with the following program, 125 °C (5 min), 325 °C (5 min), 375 °C (5 min), 450 °C (15 min) and 500 °C (15 min), and gradually cooled down to room temperature. After that, the film was immersed in a 50 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol. Then, the film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The prepared photoanode was immersed overnight in the dye bath composed of 0.1 mM CPPC dye and 7.5 mM CDCA in absolute ethanol. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by drop-casting H2PtCl6 ethanol solution onto clean FTO and sintering at 420 °C for 20 min. The device was assembled by melting a 25 μm thermoplastic Surlyn ring between working and counter electrodes thereby sealing the device. The electrolyte was injected into the space between the electrodes through the predrilled hole on the counter electrode using a vacuum pump. The iodide-based electrolyte consisted of 1 M DMII, 0.2 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tBP and 0.1 M GNCS in ACN. The predrilled hole was sealed by using a thermoplastic sheet and round glass cover. ACN was replaced by a room temperature nonvolatile solvent, MPN, during device stability tests.


Characterization of DSSCs. 
Current density–voltage (I–V) data and photocurrent dynamics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 450 W xenon lamp with a SchottK113 Tempax sunlight filter was used to simulate AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Solar cells were masked with an aperture area of 0.16 cm−2. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded with a commercial apparatus (Aekeo-Ariadne, Cicci Research s.r.l.) based on a 300 W xenon light source and a holographic grating monochromator (Cornerstone, Newport). Maximum power point tracking was carried out under continuous white illumination with an aperture area of 0.28 cm−2. A silicon diode was used to calibrate the spectral mismatch between AM 1.5G and the solar simulator via the Schott K113 Tempax filter. The light intensity was around 80 mW cm−2, and the actual device current was in-time calibrated through the silicon diode.


Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements. 
The measurements were performed with a Dyenamo toolbox using a white LED (Luxeon Star 1 W). Lifetimes and extracted charges were determined by monitoring photovoltage and photocurrent transients at different light intensities upon applying a small square wave modulation to the base light intensity.


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 
Impedance measurements were performed with a BioLogic SP300 potentiostat under dark conditions. A sinusoidal potential perturbation (10 mV) was applied within a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–1 MHz at bias potentials between 0.48 and 0.76 V. The EIS values were fitted through ZSimpWin software.
