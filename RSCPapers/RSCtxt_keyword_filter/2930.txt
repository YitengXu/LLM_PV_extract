Nanostructured TiO2 films on transparent conducting substrates have attracted much attention for a variety of applications including photocatalytic water splitting,1,2 photocatalysis,3–5 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).6–10 Electrodes made from TiO2 nanorods, nanowires, and nanosheets are particularly useful because they provide direct transport pathways for photogenerated charge carriers11–17 and faster charge transport improves performance of devices such as dye-sensitized solar cells. While several approaches based on solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis methods produce dispersions of TiO2 nanostructures in various solvents,18–21 it is still challenging to grow them heterogeneously, particularly on transparent conducting substrates. Recently, Grimes et al. and our group independently reported synthesis of single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods and nanowires on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates.22,23 However, the electron transport rate through these single crystal rutile nanowires was the same as that through nanoparticle-based films where electrons have to hop from nanocrystal to nanocrystal. Surprisingly, electron transport was not as fast as that would be expected from single crystal nanowires.24 This was attributed to the low electron mobility in rutile TiO2 (∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1).25,26 In contrast, electron mobility in anatase is an order of magnitude faster (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1) than in rutile, and anatase nanowires may provide faster electron transport than rutile nanowires. While polycrystalline anatase nanotubes and nanowires have recently been synthesized on titanium foil and FTO substrates,27–29 to our knowledge, single-crystalline anatase nanowires or nanorods have not been grown successfully on transparent conducting substrates. Single-crystalline nanorods would be preferred over polycrystalline nanorods in photovoltaic devices such as DSSCs. Herein, we describe a simple method for growing oriented single-crystalline anatase nanorods and nanoflakes on FTO substrates.
Single-crystalline anatase nanorods and nanoflakes were grown on FTO substrates through a two-step process. In the first step, TiCl4 vapor is condensed and hydrolyzed on the substrate to form a nanostructured precursor film. In the second step, this film is heated to form anatase nanorods and nanoflakes.30,31 The detailed experimental procedure is given in the ESI.† Briefly, the FTO substrates are sealed in an autoclave and heated to a temperature between 90–150 °C in the presence of liquid TiCl4. Following this, the autoclave temperature is lowered to either 50 °C or room temperature before opening it up to ambient air. During the cooling, the TiCl4 vapor condenses on the substrate and subsequent exposure to water vapor in the ambient air hydrolyzes this condensed TiCl4, forming amorphous nanostructured precursor film. Heating the substrate in an oven at 450 °C yields the nanostructures shown in Fig. 1. The entire surface of the FTO substrate is uniformly covered with anatase TiO2 nanorods or nanoflakes, depending on the condensation temperature. Nanorod films are obtained when condensation temperature is 50 °C, while lowering it to room temperature leads to the formation of nanoflake films. Our observations suggest that the film morphology does not depend on the duration of condensation but depends on the condensation temperature which is also the temperature at which the sample is removed from the autoclave and allowed to hydrolyze. The level of humidity in the ambient air appears not to affect the morphology. The amount of TiCl4 on the surface is so small and hydrolysis is so rapid that one only needs a small amount of water vapor to be present in the ambient air for hydrolysis when the samples are removed from the autoclave.

(a) and (b) Top and cross-sectional view of the nanoflake film, (c) and (d) top and cross-sectional view of the nanorod film. Insets are high-magnification top view images. The scale bars in (a), (b) and (c) are 1 μm while the scale bar is 100 nm in (d). 
Both the nanorods and the nanoflakes are nearly perpendicular to the FTO substrate surface and reach ∼1 μm height measured from the FTO surface. Cross-sectional images show that the nanoflake film consists of 20 nm thick anatase flakes which form a honeycomb-like structure when viewed from above and the nanorod film is composed of tapered nanorods with a mean diameter of ∼20 nm.
Before heating to 450 °C, the films are amorphous: XRD patterns displayed in Fig. 2a and c show only the FTO diffractions. The chemical stoichiometry of the hydrolyzed films was examined with EDX and the ratio of Ti atoms to O atoms was found to be ∼1:4 with no detectable Cl (see ESI†), suggesting that the composition of the as-deposited film is titanium hydroxide (Ti(OH)4).

These amorphous films could be converted to anatase without losing the nanostructured film morphology by heating them to 450 °C at a rate of 1 °C min−1. After thermal treatment, both the nanorods and nanoflakes are single-crystalline anatase, as evidenced by the XRD data (Fig. 2b and d), the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, and the clear lattice fringes in HRTEM images shown in Fig. 3. Examination of individual nanorods with HRTEM shows that they are crystalline along their entire lengths. Lattice fringes with interplanar spacings, d(101) = d(01) = 0.35 nm are clearly imaged and are consistent with the anatase phase. The interior angles are in agreement with the angle of (101) and (01) planes, 43.2° and 136.8°, as calculated from the lattice parameters of anatase (space group: I41/amd; tetragonal symmetry, ao = 3.7852 Å and co = 9.5139 Å, JCPDS file no. 21-1272).32 The HRTEM image and the corresponding SAED pattern indicate that the top and bottom facets of the nanoflakes are the high energy {010} planes. Two sets of lattice fringes in the HRTEM image give two interplanar distances, corresponding to (01) and (004) of anatase. More intriguingly, troughs and depressions with faceted edges were observed on the nanoflake surfaces. These faceted troughs form only when the heating rate during thermal treatment is slow. We suspect that they form as a result of a slow stress relaxation mechanism during crystallization. Increasing the heating rate from 1 °C min−1 to 10 °C min−1 during thermal treatment resulted in break up and loss of structural integrity of the nanoflakes.

While the details of the formation mechanism of anatase nanoflakes and nanorods are unclear, the strong dependence of the film's nanostructure on the condensation temperature suggests that the nanostructure is determined by the amount of TiCl4 condensed on the FTO surface. One possible mechanism is that the rough surface of the FTO (see ESI†) promotes TiCl4 condensation on its surface to form nanodroplets. The shape and spreading of these nanodroplets depend on the amount of TiCl4 condensation, and, thus, on the condensation temperature. Exposing this TiCl4 liquid covered FTO substrate to the water vapor in the ambient environment leads to rapid hydrolysis of TiCl4 to form Ti(OH)4. If the nanodroplets are isolated, hydrolysis can lead to nanorods. If, on the other hand, nanodroplets spread and begin coalescing, nanoflakes can be formed (Fig. 4).

While nanorods that are 20 nm in diameter and 1 micron in height can form from hemispherical droplets that are approximately 100 nm in diameter, the mechanism by which the nanostructures acquire their anisotropy and grow to a height of 1 micron is unclear. Another likely possibility is that the nanostructures form from a continuous liquid film but the film breaks up into nanorods and nanoflakes as it hydrolyzes. Clearly, making taller structures will require further work to understand this nanostructure forming mechanism.
Nevertheless, FTO substrates covered with anatase TiO2 nanorods and nanoflakes were used as the photoanodes in DSSCs. The current–voltage characteristics of two DSSCs made with nanorods and nanoflakes are shown in Fig. 5. Under 100 mW cm−2 of AM1.5 illumination, the nanorod cell exhibits a short circuit current density of ∼5.05 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of ∼0.67 V, and a fill factor of ∼0.6. The overall power conversion efficiency was found to be ∼2.1%. The nanoflake cell shows a lower short circuit current density (∼4.57 mA cm−2) with a similar open circuit voltage and fill factor as the nanorod cell, resulting in a lower overall power conversion efficiency. The lower short circuit current density is mainly attributed to a smaller dye adsorption area (surface roughness factor) for the nanoflake film than for the nanorod film. Clearly, the efficiency is limited by the film thickness which may be increased by repeating cycles of hydrothermal treatment followed by exposing the films to ambient air. Another approach is to use the nanorods as seeds to continue growing longer anatase nanowires from hydrothermal reactions of titanium butoxide or TiCl4.23

In summary, we have synthesized single-crystalline anatase nanorods and nanoflakes on transparent conducting FTO substrates through a two-step process that relies on hydrolysis of TiCl4 condensed on the substrate followed by thermal treatment. DSSCs assembled from 1 μm high nanorod and nanoflake films give a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of ∼2.1%. Further improvements in the cell performance should be possible by increasing the height of nanorods or nanoflakes. Besides DSSCs, these nanostructured anatase films on transparent conducting substrates should find applications in a broad variety of areas such as photocatalytic water splitting and photocatalysis.
