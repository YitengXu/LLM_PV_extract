In this study, an efficient perovskite/PCBM heterojunction was formed via conventional sequential deposition and one-step formation processes. Compared with conventional deposition, the one-step process was more facile, and produced a perovskite thin film of substantially improved quality due to fullerene passivation. Moreover, the resulting perovskite/PCBM heterojunction exhibited more efficient carrier transfer and extraction, and reduced carrier recombination. The perovskite solar cell device based on one-step perovskite/PCBM heterojunction formation exhibited a higher maximum PCE of 17.8% compared with that from the conventional method (13.7%). The device also showed exceptional stability, retaining 83% of initial PCE after 60 days of storage under ambient conditions.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received much attention recently due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, including a tunable band gap, high absorption coefficient, balanced charge carrier transport, and long charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length.1–11 Perovskite solar cell efficiency has been greatly improved, from 3.8% to over 20%, in the past five years by tuning the perovskite compositions, using interface engineering, and optimizing the film deposition methods.10–22 These high efficiencies are approaching those of long-established inorganic thin-film solar cells based on copper–indium–gallium–selenium (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe).23 Although PSC devices have achieved impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) values, significant problems such as stability and hysteresis issues remain in commonly used devices.24 Without encapsulation, these devices tend to degrade within a few hours or days under air conditions, which is a large obstacle to PSC commercialization. Hysteresis behavior is a complex issue of PSCs and can be due to ion migration, defect-assisted traps, or other factors.25–31 To improve device performance, this hysteresis behavior should be eliminated to ensure reliable performance.
For device fabrication, planar structures, including n–i–p or p–i–n type structures, are usually used to avoid a mesoporous scaffold layer and improve reproducibility.32,33 Most importantly, these structures are compatible with flexible substrates because the metal oxide interlayer can be processed at low temperature or replaced with organic interlayers. Among these structures, perovskite–fullerene (especially phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) heterojunctions have been widely used in PSCs due to their simple fabrication, decreased hysteresis effects, and high device performance.34–37 For example, Huang's group has reported PCBM passivation effects in some studies, with the fullerene small molecules able to diffuse into the perovskite layer through the grain boundaries and further passivate the shallow trap states.38 Therefore, the resulting PSC devices usually exhibit high fill factors of up to 0.80 and negligible hysteresis effects. To simplify the fabrication process, perovskite–PCBM bulk heterojunctions have been reported using a Pb(Ac)2 + MAI + PCBM precursor solution.39 However, due to the low solubility of PCBM in DMF solvent, its content in formed perovskite heterojunctions is limited. Moreover, these methods all require an additional electron transporting layer deposition process for efficient charge extraction and transport to achieve high device performance.
In this study, we adopted a unique solvent engineering method to form a perovskite–fullerene heterojunction in one step. Moreover, this process not only passivates the perovskite grain boundaries with small fullerene molecules, but also forms an electron transporting layer, which simplifies the fabrication. The perovskite film quality was found to be improved and defects reduced by this heterojunction structure. Moreover, a higher content of PCBM solution was able to form a continuous and efficient electron transporting layer to ensure efficient charge carrier extraction and transport. Therefore, a higher device performance of 17.8% and enhanced device stability was achieved compared with the conventional method (device PCE of 13.3%). This strategy provides a simple and practical route toward low-cost and high-efficiency PCSs.
Results and discussion
To form this perovskite/fullerene heterojunction structure, perovskite thin films were deposited as shown in Fig. 1. A thin film was formed on the PEDOT:PSS surface using solvent engineering methods. This method is an efficient route for retarding crystal growth and obtaining perovskite through forming a complex MAI-DMSO-PbI2 immediate phase and optimizing the perovskite quality. During spin coating, PCBM in CB solution was dropped onto the perovskite surface. The thin films were then annealed at 100 °C for 20 min before the devices were finished by thermally evaporating 100 nm Ag under high vacuum (≤5 × 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask.

The influence of PCBM content on device performance is shown in Fig. 2, with the corresponding device performance parameters summarized in Table 1. When the PCBM content was lower during film formation, the performance was poorer due to discontinuous formation of the electron transporting layer. For example, the 5 mg-PCBM PSC had a short circuit current density (JSC) of 16.44 ± 0.76 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 63.5 ± 1.1%, and average PCE of about 10.7% (the PCE of the best device was 11.2%). As the PCBM content was gradually increased, the device performance was enhanced. When the PCBM content was 10 mg mL−1, PCBM formed a continuous thin film for efficient electron transport. The best 10 mg-PCBM PSC showed an improved device performance, with a JSC of 21.90 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.02 V, a FF of 69.3%, and an overall PCE of 15.6%. Devices with PCBM contents of 20 mg mL−1 showed the best performance, with significantly improved device performance parameters (JSC of 21.71 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.02 V, FF of 78.1%, and overall PCE of 17.8%). These parameters were much higher than those of the conventional device, which exhibited a JSC of 18.78 ± 1.21 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.99 ± 0.02 V, a FF of 71.0 ± 1.5%, and a corresponding average PCE of 13.3% (the best device had a PCE of 13.7%). The increased device performance contributed to the enhancement of all parameters. PCBM was thought to play an important role in the heterojunction device by transporting electrons and blocking holes. PCBM possesses a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of −4.2 eV, which matches that of perovskite, and relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (−6.0 eV), which acts as a hole blocking layer in inverted PSCs. Meanwhile, a thin PCBM layer between the perovskite and cathode can facilitate electron transport and efficiently reduce charge recombination. Therefore, a thin continuous PCBM layer should be formed between the perovskite layer and cathode to avoid their direct contact and ensure full coverage to reduce the leakage current. Meanwhile, the PCBM layer should be as thin as possible to reduce series resistance (RS). Moreover, the in situ-formed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction has better film passivation between grain boundaries compared with the conventional device prepared via two deposition steps.37

The IPCE curves of the conventional and one-step method-based devices are shown in Fig. S1.† The higher IPCE values in the wavelength range of 350–750 nm also confirmed the higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. The integrated current densities were 18.9 mA cm−2 and 21.5 mA cm−2 for the conventional and one-step method-based devices, respectively, which were close to the JSC values obtained from current density–voltage (J–V) scans.
The hysteresis behavior was also determined by scanning the devices at different scan rates (high scan rate with delay time of 10 ms and low scan rate with delay time of 100 ms) and scan directions (reverse scan: from positive bias of 1.1 V to negative bias of −0.2 V; forward scan: from negative bias of −0.2 V to positive bias of 1.1 V). Negligible photocurrent hysteresis and highly consistent J–V characteristics were observed regardless of the scan rates and scan directions. These results were consistent with literature reports that PCBM can significantly reduce the hysteresis effect. This was easily attributed to carrier extraction at the PCBM and perovskite interfaces being very efficient, which effectively alleviates carrier accumulation at the interfaces. Moreover, PCBM diffused into the perovskite layer can effectively passivate the trap states and tie up the mobile ions. The steady state outputs for current density and PCE as a function of time were also determined (Fig. 3c and d). The devices exhibited steady-state PCE outputs of 13.5% and 17.2% for conventional and one-step method-based devices, respectively. These results confirmed that the device performance was stable and the absence of photocurrent hysteresis in the devices.

To further investigate the effect of the formed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction on device performance and the related recombination mechanism, VOC and JSC were measured with respect to light intensity at various light intensities, from 100 to 0.1 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 4, VOC as a function of light intensity on a semi-logarithmic scale exhibited a linear relationship with a slope of kT/q, where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature (in K), and elementary charge, respectively. The slopes extracted from the curves were 2.31 and 1.65 for conventional and one-step method-based devices, respectively. The slope of this plot is known to be greater than kT/q when additional trap-assisted recombination is involved. Therefore, a lower slope value indicates a reduced density of grain boundary-related traps and suppressed trap-assisted recombination. JSC showed a power law dependence on illumination intensity (JSC ∝ Iα, where I and α are the light intensity and exponential factor, respectively). The α values extracted from the curves were 0.82 and 0.94 for conventional and one-step method-based devices, respectively. This showed that the one-step approach could efficiently passivate the perovskite grain boundaries, enhancing charge carrier transport and reducing recombination.

(b) JSC as a function of light intensity on a log scale for the conventional and one-step method-based devices. (c, d) Transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage measurements. 
To further probe the charge transfer and recombination processes of the devices, we performed transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4c, the photocurrent decay of the one-step-formed device was faster (0.47 μs) than that of the conventional device (0.56 μs), indicating that the one-step-formed devices possessed more efficient charge extraction and charge transport processes. Fig. 4d shows the transient photovoltage measurements used to determine the charge recombination lifetime. The charge recombination lifetime of the one-step-formed devices was higher, at 32.1 μs, than that of the conventional device (27.0 μs), indicating that the charge recombination process was efficiently suppressed and trap density was reduced in devices with a perovskite/PCBM heterojunction.
The device stability resulting from the different fabrication methods was investigated by storing the unencapsulated devices under ambient conditions (22 °C and ∼30% humidity). As shown in Fig. 5, the PCE of the conventional device decreased to 25% of the original value after 60 days, while that of the one-step method-based device retained about 83% of the original value after 60 days. This enhanced stability was attributed to both the passivation effect on the traps and mobile ions in the perovskite layer and hydrophobic properties that protected the perovskite layer against moisture. Furthermore, the nature of the perovskite material, which had much larger and denser crystal grains, should provide a dynamic barrier against water molecules in ambient air.

To illustrate the effect of the one-step formation method on the final perovskite thin film quality, various characterization techniques were used to analyze the thin film properties. Thin film crystallinity was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Diffraction peaks at around 14.21°, 28.51°, and 31.88° were assigned to the (110), (220), and (310) lattice planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively, indicating that a perovskite film was formed. The PbI2 peak at around 12.8° was not observed in the one-step-formed film, indicating that the perovskite thin film was high quality. The enhanced diffraction intensities of perovskite peaks at 14.21°, 28.51°, and 31.88° indicated the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film. Notably, the one-step formation method did not change the perovskite crystal structure, with no peak shifts observed. This agreed with the UV-vis absorption results, which showed that the one-step-formation method did not affect the perovskite thin film absorption (Fig. 6b).

The surface morphologies of the one-step formed perovskite thin films were measured by FE-SEM. As shown in Fig. 7, the 0 mg mL−1 processed thin film exhibited clear crystal domains with crystal sizes of around 400–600 nm. Some bright grains were also observed, which should be due to PbI2 because a slight excess of PbI2 was used to enhance device performance.40 Using 2 mg mL−1 PCBM solution, a thin discontinuous PCBM film was formed on the perovskite surface. However, perovskite grains were still observed. The discontinuous PCBM film would lead to undesirable recombination losses between the perovskite and cathode. When the PCBM solution concentration was increased to 5 mg mL−1, the top PCBM thin film became connected, but some voids or pinholes were still observed. Notably, when the perovskite thin film was converted to MAPbI3−xClx during the thermal annealing process, the PCBM small molecules were able to occupy and fill vacancies and pinholes at the grain boundaries.37,41,42 Therefore, by gradually increasing the PCBM concentration from 2 mg mL−1 to 30 mg mL−1, the grain boundaries could be efficiently passivated by PCBM small molecules. Furthermore, excess PCBM would not be incorporated into the perovskite film and could be readily segregated on the perovskite film surface. When the PCBM concentration was increased to 20 mg mL−1, the PCBM film became continuous, as confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 7b) and EDX mapping of the thin film (Fig. S2†). This was consistent with the device results. Notably, the one-step-formed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction structure led to the substantial incorporation of fullerene into the perovskite with a gradient distribution near the interface, similar to previously reported results.37 This structure can be confirmed by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements,37 cross-section SEM (Fig. 7b), and EDX analysis (Fig. S3†).43

To obtain a better understanding of charge extraction based on the perovskite/PCBM heterojunction structure, the charge carrier dynamics were further investigated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL measurements. Samples were prepared on ITO glass substrates. Interestingly, as the PCBM content was gradually increased, the PL intensity was gradually quenched, indicating that an efficient charge transfer process from perovskite to PCBM occurred. When the PCBM concentration was 10–20 mg mL−1, PL quenching was most efficient, which was consistent with the higher Jsc values achieved using these two sets of conditions. Moreover, the PL quenching efficiency was higher for the one-step-formed film compared with the conventional perovskite/PCBM thin film prepared using two deposition steps (Fig. S3†). Time-resolved PL exhibited similar results. The carrier lifetime was obtained by fitting the PL with a double exponential decay model.44 The fitting results are shown in Table S1.† The decay time gradually decreased with increasing PCBM content. The average lifetime for 0 mg mL−1 PCBM was 10.07 ns, which decreased to 6.85 ns and 4.49 ns using 10 mg mL−1 and 20 mg mL−1 PCBM. Based on these observations, we concluded that efficient electron transfer occurred between perovskite and PCBM (Fig. 8).

Experimental
Materials
All materials, including methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, 99.8%, Dyesol), lead iodide (PbI2 crystals, 99.999%, Sigma), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, 98%, nano-c), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PVP Al 4083), dimethyl sulfoxide (99.8%, Sigma), chlorobenzene (99.8%, Sigma), toluene (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), and γ-butyrolactone (99.8%, Aladdin), were used as received without further purification.
Film formation and device fabrication
An inverted planar heterojunction structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag) was used. Inverted planar PSCs were fabricated on pre-patterned ITO glass substrates (∼2 × 2.5 cm2 in size, 10 Ω per square). The patterned ITO glass substrates were sequentially ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol at 50 °C for 20 min. The ITO substrates were then dried using a nitrogen gun and treated in UV-ozone oven for 15 min before a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the substrates at 7000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 140 °C for 15 min. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. A MAPbI3−xClx precursor solution containing 1.26 M PbI2, 0.14 M PbCl2, and 1.35 M MAI was prepared in DMSO/GBL cosolvent (3:7, v/v) and stirred for 2 h at 75 °C. PCBM solutions of various concentrations (2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg mL−1) were prepared by dissolving PCBM in anhydrous chlorobenzene and stirring for 12 h. The spin-coating process for the perovskite precursor solution was programmed to run at 1000 rpm for 20 s and then 4000 rpm for 40 s. After spinning for 50 s, 150 μL anhydrous chlorobenzene or PCBM solution was injected onto the substrates. The perovskite films were thermally annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 20 min. A thin layer of BCP (0.5 mg mL−1 in IPA) was then spin-coated on the top of the heterojunction layer. The devices were finished with thermally evaporated 100 nm Ag under a high vacuum (≤5 × 10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask. All devices had an area of 7 mm2.
Materials and device characterization
Samples for material characterization were prepared using the device fabrication process detailed above. Morphology measurements of the perovskite layers were measured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-7800F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using an UV-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950). Photovoltaic performances were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated sunlight from XES-70S1 solar simulator matching the AM 1.5G standard with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The system was calibrated against a NREL-certified silicon reference solar cell. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of PSCs were measured using a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (SCS10-X150, Zolix instrument. Co. Ltd). All solar cell measurements were performed under ambient conditions without encapsulation. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) was measured with an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980 spectrometer using a 450 nm picosecond pulsed laser (EPL-450). Transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were performed by excitation with a 532 nm pulse laser (1000 Hz, 3.2 ns). Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed using the same system, but excited with a 405 nm pulse laser (50 Hz, 20 ms). A digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, D4105) was used to record the photocurrent or photovoltage decay process using a sampling resistor of 50 Ω or 1 MΩ, respectively.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a perovskite/PCBM heterojunction thin film was formed using one-step formation method. Selecting the appropriate PCBM content during film formation significantly improved the perovskite film quality, while charge extraction and collection were enhanced, and charge carrier recombination was reduced. Therefore, the device performance and stability were significantly improved. The best device had a high PCE of 17.8%, which represented a 30% improvement compared with the conventional device. Further performance enhancements could be expected with careful optimization of the perovskite composition and film interfaces. This approach clearly simplifies the device fabrication and, therefore, reduces the fabrication costs. These results provide a facile approach toward the widespread use of one-step formation for photoactive and electron transporting layers in high-efficiency and low-cost PSCs for commercial applications.
