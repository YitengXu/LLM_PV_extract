    , Accepted 3rd February 2009First published on 5th March 2009AbstractThe thermal reshaping of gold nanorods (NRs) in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposite film is investigated by UV-vis and TEM. To ensure dispersion, the NRs are modified with PEG brushes, and then dispersed in PMMA. Thermal annealing of the PMMA–NR film results in a blue shift of the longitudinal plasmon resonance, caused by a decrease in the length of the NR. The rate of the blue shift increases as temperature increases from 100 °C to 200 °C, and the longitudinal absorption peak approaches a constant value that scales linearly with temperature. We demonstrate a potential application by fabricating a device with a gradient in optical properties.
Introduction
As their fundamental understanding evolves, polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) are receiving increasing attention because of their novel properties. The combination of nanoparticles (NPs) and polymer matrix makes them suitable candidates for magnetic storage,1 catalysis,2 optoelectronic3–5 and electronic devices,6,7 and biomedical applications.8,9 Whereas nanospheres have so far received the most attention, anisotropic objects, such as one-dimensional nanorods (NRs), are attractive building blocks for nanoscale devices. For example, a hybrid of CdSe NRs combined with a polymer matrix is advantageous for easily processible high-efficiency solar cells.10 Also, NRs of ZnO play an important role in collecting photogenerated electrons to improve the power conversion efficiency in hybrid photovoltaic devices.11
Among one-dimensional nanostructures, gold NRs are of particular interest because of their size- and shape-dependent optical properties. This unique metallic nanostructure has two plasmon resonance peaks corresponding to longitudinal and transverse absorption bands, which differ from spherical gold NPs.12,13 The longitudinal plasmon resonance band is extremely sensitive to changes in the dielectric properties of surrounding media and can be tuned from the visible to near IR region by adjusting the aspect ratio of the NR. This enables widespread applications in photothermal therapy,14 cancer and antibody detection,15–17 and chemical sensing18etc. To optimize and extend gold NR applications, the assembly of these NPs has received much attention. For example, gold NRs could be assembled into one- and two-dimensional arrays using a DNA template under appropriate conditions.19 In another approach, gold NRs were modified with a hydrophobic shell and self-assembled into two- or three-dimensional ordered structures by evaporation of solvent on a substrate.20 Most recently, our group utilized a symmetric diblock copolymer film, i.e., poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate), as a template to assemble gold NRs in a specific lamellar domain through solvent annealing at room temperature.21 Several research groups have investigated the optical properties of NRs in a polymer matrix, which has the advantage of low temperature processability over hard matrices such as silica. For example, gold and silver NRs embedded in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) films could be used for optical laser writing and patterning.22,23
The thermal stability of the embedded NPs can greatly impact the potential applications for nanocomposite based devices. Theoretical simulations show that gold NRs undergo morphological and structural transitions upon heating to form more stable facets with low surface energy.24 There have been several experimental studies investigating the thermal stability of gold NRs exposed to thermal or laser induced heating. However, these experiments dealt with NRs in the solution phase or exposed directly to the atmosphere,25–28 and to our knowledge very few studies have been performed regarding thermal stability of gold NRs in a polymer matrix. Because these studies used gold NRs with varying sizes, surface functionalities, surrounding media and heating methods, a complete and consistent understanding of the thermal stability of gold NRs is still lacking. In the present work, we systematically study the thermal reshaping behavior of gold NRs in a homopolymer matrix. Gold NRs are surface modified with thiol terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), uniformly dispersed in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film, and annealed at different temperatures. The temperature-dependent shape change of gold NRs provides a way to tune their optical properties. Liz-Marzán and co-workers reported the alignment of gold NRs in PVA films and achieved polarization-dependent optical response by stretching the film to orient NRs.29 Although creative, this approach used unfunctionalized NRs in an aqueous solution of PVA to form the films and therefore is limited to water soluble polymers and low NR loadings. In our experiments, we explore how to control thermally the optical properties of gold NRs in PMMA films by adjusting annealing time and temperature. Upon exposing a PMMA–NR film to a temperature profile, we could fabricate a coating containing a gradient of gold NRs with tunable absorption properties. This result demonstrates the advantages gained by combining thermal reshaping with polymers for fabricating nanoscale devices such as those used for detection/sensing of multiple targets.
Experimental
Materials
PMMA powder with molecular weight, Mw = 82.4 kg/mole, and PDI = 1.07 was obtained from Polymer Sources Inc. All the chemicals, including cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB), chloroauric acid trihydrate, sodium borohydride, silver nitrate, L-ascorbic acid, toluene, methanol, and O-[2-(3-mercaptopropionylamino)ethyl]-O′-methylpoly(ethylene glycol) or mPEG-thiol (5 kg mol−1), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Water was obtained from a Direct-Q Ultrapure Water System (Millipore 18.2 MΩ cm).
Methods

          Gold
          nanorods were prepared through a seed-mediated, surfactant directed synthetic method as previously described.21,30 In brief, gold nanoparticle seeds were synthesized by adding 0.25 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl4·3H2O solution to 7.5 mL of 0.1 M CTAB solution followed by 0.6 mL ice-cold 0.01 M NaBH4 solution with gentle mixing for 2 min. The pale yellow-brown colored seed solution could be used 2 h after preparation and was stable for several days. To produce nanorods, 120 mL of 0.1 M CTAB, 1.7 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl4·3H2O, 0.25 mL of 0.01 M AgNO3, and 0.27 mL of 0.1 M L-ascorbic acid were added one-by-one in the given order followed by gentle mixing. 0.42 mL of the seed solution was then added to this mixture, and the rods were allowed to grow for the next 3 h. The as-prepared nanorods were purified twice by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min and redispersed in ultrapure water. For PEG modification, 7.2 mL of 0.002 M mPEG–thiol solution was prepared in degassed water immediately before use, and then added to the purified nanorod solution. This mixture was shaken at room temperature for 2 h.
Surface modified gold NRs, i.e., PEG-NRs, were centrifugated at 8000 rpm and resuspended in 10mL methanol twice to remove excess chemicals and residual water. The PEG-NRs could finally be resuspended in 1 mL toluene. 8.8 mg of PMMA powder was added to the PEG-NR–toluene solution in order to prepare a nanocomposite film containing ∼5 vol% of NRs. After complete dissolution, the mixture was spin coated onto 1.5 × 1.5 cm clean glass microscope slides, yielding a film thickness of 45 nm.
The samples were annealed in a vacuum oven (10−3 torr) at 200 °C, 150 °C, 100 °C, and 60 °C, respectively. The annealing times for the 200 °C, 150 °C, and 100 °C samples were 0.5 h, 2 h, 6 h, 2 days and 8 days, whereas the 60 °C sample was only annealed for 8 days. The NR shape, size, and location in the PMMA film were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2010F) operated at 200 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to determine the elemental profiles across the film. The original, unannealed 45 nm PMMA–NR film was floated off its glass substrate in ultrapure water, and picked up on holey carbon-coated copper grids for TEM imaging, whereas the annealed films were floated off in a buffered oxide etch solution using the same procedure. ImageJ 1.37 software (NIH, USA) was used to process the TEM images to determine NR dimensions and their corresponding aspect ratios. The values at each temperature and time were obtained based on analysis of at least 300 NPs. The optical properties of the composite films were studied by UV-visible spectrophotometry (Varian, Cary 5000).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a typical TEM image of an as-cast PMMA–NR thin film. After PEG modification, the gold NRs readily disperse in toluene and uniformly distribute throughout the PMMA matrix due to the favorable interaction between the PEG brush and PMMA chains.21,31 Although some irregularly shaped NPs are observed, around 90% of the NPs are NRs, in agreement with previous studies.30 Applying statistical analysis to over 600 NRs, the average length and diameter are 42.1 ± 3.7 nm and 12.6 ± 1.0 nm, respectively, with an average aspect ratio of 3.3. The PMMA chain density is calculated to be 0.53 chains nm−2, based on the weight fraction of PEG chains, determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and NR dimensions. A UV-vis spectrum of the as-cast composite film is shown in Fig. 1b. Compared to the NRs in water, NRs in PMMA film undergo red shifts in both longitudinal and transverse plasmon resonance peaks from 768 nm to 844 nm and 513 nm to 529 nm, respectively. These shifts are attributed to the increase in refractive index of the surrounding media, i.e., water to PMMA.32 The shoulders in the transverse peaks in both spectra correspond to the plasmon resonance of the minority non-rod NPs.33

The optical properties of the thermally annealed composite films were recorded at different times for four temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2. The results from the UV-vis spectra show that the longitudinal plasmon resonance peak blue shifts during annealing, corresponding to a decrease of the NR aspect ratio.34 When heating at 60 °C, far below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PMMA, the blue shift is very small, only 17 nm, after 8 days (Fig. 2a). The stability of NRs in PMMA is much greater than in a colloidal solution, where the structural transitions at 60 °C or even lower have been observed even at a short time.26 For the composite film annealed at 100 °C, a small blue shift is observed after 30 min as shown in Fig. 2b. Upon further annealing, the longitudinal plasmon peak continues to blue shift and reaches a final value of 741 nm after 8 days. No significant change was observed after annealing beyond 8 days (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3a–c, TEM analysis of the PMMA–NR film at 100 °C confirms a small shape change consistent with the longitudinal peak shift. The NRs become slightly shorter, and the final aspect ratio is 2.73 (Fig. 3c) after 8 days. At 150 °C (Fig. 2c), a much stronger blue shift is observed after 30 min of annealing compared to that at 100 °C. After 8 days, the longitudinal peak approaches a constant wavelength of 671 nm. The average aspect ratio at this point has decreased to 2.09 (Fig. 3f). Fig. 2d shows the UV-vis spectra of PMMA–NR films annealed at 200 °C, the highest temperature. As expected, the shape transition occurs more rapidly than at lower temperatures. A 170 nm blue shift is observed after only 30 min. Moreover, the transverse and longitudinal plasmon resonance peaks overlap after annealing for 8 days, indicating that a majority of NRs are nearly spherical. Consistent with UV-vis spectra, TEM images (Fig. 3g–i) clearly show a shape change from rods to spheres with increasing annealing time. The average aspect ratio decreases from 3.19 to 2.10, 1.97, and 1.39, after 30 min, 6 h and 8 days, respectively.

Over the past 10 years, the stability of individual metal nanorods has received much attention. Based on theoretical simulations,24 the surface energy has been identified as a driving force for NR reshaping, where higher energy {110} and {100} facets reorganize to form more stable {111} facets. For CTAB or PEG modified NRs, surface ligands act as a protecting layer to stabilize the {110} and {100} facets.35 Therefore, the NR reshaping mechanism in polymers (and other media) may be due to the partial or complete removal of surface ligands during thermal annealing, which results in the exposure and subsequent shape change of high-energy facets. Based on our experimental results, temperature plays a key role in the reshaping of NRs in a polymer matrix. At 60 °C, which is far below the PMMA Tg, the polymer matrix is an amorphous glass. Because of the limited free volume, the PEG ligands are unable to diffuse rapidly into the surrounding glassy matrix. Upon annealing above the Tg of PMMA, i.e., at 150 °C and 200 °C, the NR shape change is quite significant because the PEG can now readily diffuse into the PMMA matrix.36 In addition to temperature, the surrounding media is a key factor in NR reshaping. To test this relationship, we compared the behavior of the same NRs at the same temperature in water and PMMA. Specifically, PEG-NRs in water were found to undergo a much stronger blue shift than the same NRs in PMMA at 60 °C and 100 °C (Figure S1†). The rapid reshaping in water is consistent with the high diffusivity of the ligands in the liquid compared to the glassy polymer. This comparison further supports the proposed mechanism, where the mobility of the surface ligands plays an important role in NR reshaping.

Fig. 4 shows how the longitudinal plasmon peak position (λ) decreases with annealing time at 60 °C, 100 °C, 150 °C, and 200 °C, respectively. The initial peak position is 844 nm for all temperatures. At 60 °C the peak position remains almost fixed up to 8 days. However, with increasing temperature the peak position decreases more rapidly. At long annealing times, the peak positions approach a constant value, corresponding to a metastable shape having well defined aspect ratios, as confirmed by both UV-vis and TEM (Fig. 2 and 3). This is consistent with previous observations of NRs annealed in air on glass substrates.27 Most likely, a thermodynamic equilibrium is reached between the concentration of PEG diffused into polymer or water and the concentration of PEG remaining on the gold surface. Here, we propose a two-step reshaping mechanism that includes the detachment of PEG ligands from the gold surface followed by the diffusion of the ligands into the surrounding media. As temperature increases, the detachment of PEG ligands increases, which accounts for the temperature-dependent shape change in PMMA shown in Fig. 2 and 3. Regarding the surrounding media, PEG diffusion in water is more rapid than in a glassy polymer, which explains why NRs at 60 °C can reshape in water but not in PMMA. For this reason, polymers are more advantageous than liquids as a host for fine tuning and manipulating the shape of NRs.

Based on TEM images, the NRs shorten significantly after thermal annealing above 100 °C. In laser induced reshaping experiments,37,38 fragmentation of gold NRs was observed by several research groups. However, for our system and annealing conditions, the number density of NRs is constant, suggesting that the fragmentation process is unlikely. Rather, we attribute the decrease in NR length to the diffusion of gold into the PMMA matrix. To test this hypothesis, EDX analysis was used to measure the distribution of gold across the PMMA–NR film (Figure S2†). Compared to the original film, the concentration of gold relative to carbon (i.e., PMMA) is higher after annealing in the PMMA matrix at 200 °C for 8 days. Therefore, the shape change that occurs during annealing, at least in part, results from the diffusion of gold from the surface of the NRs into the PMMA matrix.
Interestingly, the longitudinal peak position, corresponding to the metastable state (i.e., ≥ 8 days), varies linearly with annealing temperature as shown in Fig. 5. Using this relationship as a guide, NRs should be completely converted to spheres at a temperature slightly above 200 °C. This prediction is confirmed by experiment (cf., Fig. 6). The temperature-dependent reshaping of NRs in a polymer host provides a facile method to precisely tune the absorption properties of PNC films. Sensing and imaging devices based on gold NRs are tuned to absorb at a frequency that matches common lasers (e.g. 633 nm, 785 nm and 830 nm).39 A recent study showed that gold NRs can act as wavelength-selective absorption centers in the visible and near-infrared regions, and therefore, can be used to trigger the release of encapsulated molecules.40 Thus, our ability to control the shape of gold NRs in a polymer host can be utilized to make an all-in-one optical chip. Combining NRs with processible polymers to create a device is particularly attractive because coatings can be applied to a wide range of substrates, which can serve as an interface with a monitoring system. As a proof of concept, Fig. 6a–b shows how a simple optical chip can be fabricated by controlling thermal reshaping of the NRs. Initially, the PMMA–NR film contains a uniform dispersion of NRs. By applying a temperature gradient, the NRs at the colder end (top) retain their shape, whereas the NRs near the hot end (bottom) become spherical. In between, a gradient of NR shapes will be created resulting in a range of absorption properties and colors. In principle, the longitudinal plasmon resonance peak can be shifted across the entire visible and near IR regions. For demonstration purposes, a spin-coated PMMA–NR film on a glass microscope slide was annealed on a temperature gradient ranging from room temperature to 230 °C. From top to bottom, the slide displayed in Fig. 6c shows at least four colors, i.e., brown–red, green, blue, and pink–red, corresponding to NRs with decreasing aspect ratios, 3.3 to ∼1. This simple approach can be used to prepare nanoscale devices for applications requiring a gradient of optical or sensing properties.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully incorporated and uniformly dispersed PEG modified gold NRs in PMMA films. By annealing the PNC films at various temperatures, the aspect ratio (i.e., optical properties) of the NRs could be controlled. Compared to NR reshaping in solution or air, the PMMA matrix significantly slows down the reshaping process, thus enhancing the thermal stability of the NRs. For example at 100 °C, the NRs are thermally stable in a PMMA matrix, whereas they rapidly become nearly spherical in water. Upon annealing, the NRs reach a metastable shape after 8 days. For these NRs, the wavelength of the longitudinal plasmon resonance peak is found to vary linearly with temperature. Based on our ability to control NR shape in a polymer coating, a prototype device is fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a gradient in optical properties.
