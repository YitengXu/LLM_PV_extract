    , Accepted 30th April 2018First published on 2nd May 2018AbstractA hybrid light/ToF-SIMS system was used to analyze the dynamic chemical changes of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films under light illumination, in order to reveal the mechanism of light instability for perovskite materials. Real-time material degradation and quasi-reversible iodine migration were successfully observed.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material (e.g. CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) based solar cells have attracted great attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 22%.1–3 The high PCEs are attributed to the high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high charge carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime of these perovskite absorbers.4–6 Although perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have favorable efficiencies, their instability is still a critical issue for commercial applications.7 It was known that PSCs were susceptible to moisture and light.8,9 In the presence of moisture, the water-sensitive CH3NH3PbI3 material was gradually hydrolyzed into PbI2, CH3NH2 and HI, leading to the degradation of PSCs.10 Several strategies have been explored to improve the moisture stability of PSCs, such as by changing the composition of perovskite materials,11 optimizing the solar cell structures,12 developing effective encapsulation methods,13 or improving the moisture resistance of the hole-transport layer.14,15 On the other hand, the cause of light instability, especially visible light-induced chemical changes, is not fully understood. Thus, investigating the light-induced chemical changes of perovskite materials is necessary for better understanding and improvement of PSCs’ light stability.
Previous studies have reported that the ionic migration or structure damage in PSCs’ active layers under light irradiation could affect the device operation and optoelectronic performance.16–18 Most of these works focused on the changes of perovskite films under UV light or sunlight irradiation, while few studies referred to distinguishing the different effects of visible light with different wavelengths on perovskite films.19 For example, Ito and co-workers found that CH3NH3PbI3 layers transformed into PbI2 after UV light exposure for 12 h.20 Cacovich et al. used a scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (STEM-EDX) for device analysis, observing that gold and iodine diffusion caused material degradation under sunlight soaking.21 Various analysis techniques were used to characterize the light-induced changes of perovskite materials. High resolution imaging techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM) provided useful morphological information about the perovskite structures.22 However, not much chemical information could be obtained using these techniques. Chemical component analysis methods like energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be useful in providing elemental information as well as chemical states of perovskite materials.21,23 Nevertheless, these methods can hardly get molecular information, which could be important for a better understanding of the chemical changes of the material. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) with high surface sensitivity, label-free high spatial resolution chemical imaging and 3D depth profiling could be used for unravelling the spatial distribution of chemical components at the molecular level.24,25 However, due to the high vacuum environment of ToF-SIMS, it was usually used for off-line analysis of materials. Real-time analysis of materials under operando conditions was challenging. It was reported that after light soaking, PSCs can self-heal by resting them in the dark for less than 1min.8 Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the dynamic changes of perovskite materials under light irradiation, in order to better understand the mechanism of light instability. As far as we know, few reports provided the chemical evidence of the real-time changes in perovskite films under visible light illumination.26
Here we use a hybrid light/ToF-SIMS system to study the real-time photo-induced chemical changes in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 materials. Our strategy is shown in Scheme 1. The CH3NH3PbI3 sample was prepared via one-step deposition followed by spin-coating on FTO glass. The light path of the laser was marked with red arrows. Filters and mirrors were used to control the laser intensity and incidence direction. The time-resolved chemical changes of the CH3NH3PbI3 film were measured using ToF-SIMS under the illumination of blue, green, or red lasers or white light, respectively. The real-time degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 and iodine migration were observed. ToF-SIMS chemical imaging as well as depth profiling were further performed to confirm the iodine migration under red laser irradiation. The real-time ToF-SIMS analysis of visible light-induced chemical changes of the perovskite film provided important evidence for the mechanism of light instability of the perovskite material.

The characterizations of the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 film using SEM, XRD, EDS, ToF-SIMS and UV-vis absorption were performed, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), indicating the acquisition of a high quality perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 film. Detailed discussion of material characterization is presented in the ESI.† Light-induced chemical changes of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 materials were analysed using in situ ToF-SIMS, as shown in Fig. 1. Equipped with additional light set-ups, ToF-SIMS has the advantage of monitoring the real-time changes of the CH3NH3PbI3 film under light irradiation. In order to compare the signal intensities (I) of certain species under different light conditions, the intensities obtained under dark conditions served as a background (I0). The selected secondary ions were divided into three groups: Ix− (x = 1–3) (Fig. 1A), PbxIy− (x = 1, 2; y = 2, 3) (Fig. 1B) and CNHxIy− (x = 5, 6; y = 1, 2) (Fig. 1C). In these figures, the lines with different colors (grey, blue, green and red) represent the signal intensities under the radiation of white light, a blue laser, a green laser and a red laser, respectively. Before light illumination (500–1500 s), the signals from each measurement showed negligible differences. When the lights were turned on at 1500 s, obvious signal changes and differences among the colors could be seen. The intensity of Ix− and PbIx− increased significantly under the illumination of the blue laser. However, the signal of CNHxIy− decreased slightly. These signal changes were in good agreement with our ToF-SIMS study results of CH3NH3PbI3 degradation in air (Fig. S2, ESI†). Therefore, the blue laser-induced signal changes in this work could be interpreted as the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3. It was reported that UV light exposure of CH3NH3PbI3 leads to an irreversible breakdown into PbI2.27 This could be attributed to the higher energy of relatively short wavelength lights.28,29 According to the UV-vis spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. S1E, ESI†), a higher absorption was observed within the short wavelength region. Thus, under illumination of short wavelength lights, the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 into PbI2 was easier. Unlike the blue laser, decreases of iodine-containing species, especially CNHxIy−, were observed under the illumination of the green or red laser. Previous studies demonstrated that under light illumination, high density of photo-excited electrons could be trapped in the iodine vacancies, further to create an electric field that induces iodine migration.26 Compared with the green laser, the red laser showed a greater degree of decrease, which may be attributed to the heating effect of the red laser that leads to acceleration of iodine migration.30 In the case of white light, a built-in white LED lamp was used as the source with an estimated power density of ∼55 mW cm−2, which is similar to the power density of visible light in sun light.31 The white light source could be regarded as an integration of multiple monochromatic visible lights. Thus, both characteristic signal changes for material degradation (increase of Ix− and PbIx−) and iodine migration (decrease of CNHxIy−) were observed. Therefore, the changes under white light could be regarded as the combined action of degradation of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and the migration of iodine. In order to confirm the feasibility of the built-in LED white light source, a standard 100 mW cm−2 xenon lamp was used to conduct the same experiment. After filtration of UV light (<400 nm) and IR light (>780 nm), the remaining power density was ∼80 mW cm−2. The results shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) were in agreement with those obtained using the built-in LED white light. Thus, it is reasonable to use this LED white lamp in this work. These results indicated that lights with different wavelengths had different impacts on perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. Other than photo-induced migration, we also found evidence for photo-induced degradation.

For further study of iodine migration, chemical mapping of the CH3NH3PbI3 surface was conducted. The mapping was recorded in an area of 500 × 500 μm2. As shown in Fig. 2A, a masking paper was fixed onto the edge of FTO glass so that half of the CH3NH3PbI3 sample area was shaded from light/laser irradiation. Two representative secondary ions I− and PbI3− were chosen to show the real-time migration under red laser illumination. The 2D images of I− and PbI3− were acquired under red laser illumination for 0, 10, 15 and 20 min, respectively. Before light illumination, I− and PbI3− showed uniform distribution. After 10 min of illumination, the illuminated part showed obvious signal decrease for I−, while no obvious changes were found in PbI3− distribution. With the increase of illumination time, the ion intensities of I− and PbI3− gradually decreased in the illuminated area. Our results showed direct experimental evidence for real-time migration of iodine-related species in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3.

Inset: The magnified view of PbI3− signal changes within the sputter time of 20–80 s. 
To confirm the iodine migration direction in the CH3NH3PbI3 film, depth profiling was conducted. As shown in Fig. 2B, the black, red, blue and green lines represent the ion intensities under 0, 20, 40 and 60 min of illumination of the red laser, respectively. The inset shows the magnified view of the PbI3− signal changes within the sputter time of 20–80 s under red laser illumination. In this region, the intensity of PbI3− decreased along with the illumination time. The sputter rate was calculated to be 1.85 nm s−1. AFM characterization showed a 200 nm thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The interface position between the CH3NH3PbI3 film and FTO is labelled in Fig. 2B. At the interface region, the signal of iodine-related species increased with illumination time. The longitudinal distribution of iodine-containing species shifted downwards after illumination of the red laser, indicating the downward migration and accumulation at the interface region of iodine. The time-resolved signal changes of I− at the interface are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The results indicated a constant migration speed in the first hour of illumination. After that, the migration speed started to slow down, which could be attributed to the charge compensation of the electric field by I−.
ToF-SIMS signal changes of CH3NH3PbI3 under cycling “on–off” red laser illumination are shown in Fig. 3. The light was turned on at 1500 s, and then turned off after 200 s. This operation was repeated in one ToF-SIMS real-time measurement. As shown in Fig. 3C, when the red laser was turned off at 1700 s, the intensity of CNHxIy− increased, but did not recover to the original intensity. The result confirmed that iodine migration is a quasi-reversible process. The signal changes of iodine-related species were compared, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The iodine in CNH5I− and CNH6I2− had 10.4% variation, which was higher than those of I−, I2−, PbI3− and PbI2− (<4.8%). For white light, the signal intensity did not recover to the original intensity when the light was turned off, either. For the reason that the degradation of perovskite was irreversible, the ionic migration under the red laser was quasi-reversible. Thus, the signal changes under white light were partly reversible. All these results further evidenced the degradation of perovskite and the migration of iodine. Besides, fast recovery of the ion migration was observed, demonstrating the necessity of real-time measurement of photo-induced chemical changes in perovskite materials.

In conclusion, the real-time degradation and iodine migration in CH3NH3PbI3 materials were studied using an in situ hybrid light/ToF-SIMS system. We found that lights with relatively short wavelengths tend to degrade the chemical structure of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. With the increase of the wavelength, the migration of iodine-related species played a dominant role in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. In addition, it was shown that the iodine migration was quasi-reversible. Our experimental results could contribute to a better understanding of the photo-instability under different light illuminations, especially for the real-time changes of perovskite materials. Further effort will be focused on the analysis of assembled perovskite solar cells under in situ light illumination, for further study of the relationship between the chemical structure and photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
