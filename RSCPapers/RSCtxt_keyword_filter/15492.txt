The front sub-cell's active layer consists of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) DPP(TBFu)2:PC70BM device while the back cell has a typical bilayer structure employing a 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl] squaraine (SQ) donor and a C60 acceptor.
The recent record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8% for a small molecule (SM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cell (OSC) demonstrates that when suitably designed, such devices can match and even exceed the performance of polymer-based BHJ OSCs.1 Just as for polymer-based devices, overcoming the 10% PCE barrier in SM-BHJ devices will probably require the use of multiple junctions. Such devices, consisting of multiple stacks of active layers displaying complementary light absorption properties separated by intermediate recombination layers, have been widely studied in the case of solution processed polymer-based OSCs.2 Up to triple junction entirely solution-processed devices with PCEs as high as 10.6% have been fabricated using a combination of polymer-based active layers typically separated by a layer of metal oxide nanoparticles and a layer of conductive polymers.3 However, a similar strategy has yet to be applied to solution-processed SM-BHJs. Indeed, SM-BHJ devices have only been shown to be competitive with polymer BHJs very recently, and the characteristically low FF displayed by SM-BHJ devices is often regarded as a limitation for their use in tandem devices. Moreover, SMs with absorption maxima shifted towards the NIR region and also capable of matching the absorption of a potential front sub-cell in a tandem architecture are scarce, rendering the task even more challenging. Nonetheless, one example of SM-based tandem solar cell devices in which one of the layers was solution-processed (the remaining being vacuum deposited) has been described.4 However this layer consisted of a pristine layer of donor material and thus the overall tandem device did not comprise of any BHJ active layers.
Herein, as a follow-up to this work, and to provide a preliminary study for the fabrication of entirely solution-processed SM-based tandem solar cells we set out to fabricate a SM-based tandem solar cell in which at least one sub-cell was composed of a solution-processed SM-BHJ active layer. The tandem device consisted of a solution-processed DPP(TBFu)2:PC70BM front sub-cell,5 while the back sub-cell consisted of a vacuum-processed device using 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl] squaraine (SQ) as a donor and C60 as the acceptor.6 Ultrathin layers of aluminium and gold were used as the recombination layers.
The devices presented here are based on the early work on tandem devices by De Boer et al.3a The structure proposed therein which consisted of two solution-processed sub-cells separated by an Al–Au recombination layer was simplified, leaving only the front sub-cell (DPP(TBFu)2:PC70BM)5b to be solution processed. The Al–Au combination provides the required energy level alignment for electron extraction from the front sub-cell, and hole extraction from the back sub-cell, as well as an efficient recombination centre (Fig. 1c). The back sub-cell consisted of a widely studied commercially available squaraine (SQ) donor incorporated into a conventional bilayer structure, which displays an absorption pattern displaced towards the infra-red part of the visible spectrum, able to complement – to some extent – the absorption of the front sub-cell (Fig. 1). As seen in the UV-visible spectra (Fig. 2a), the DPP(TBFu)2-based layer displays a fairly narrow absorption band with a maximum centred at around 600 nm while the SQ based active layer shows two distinct main absorption bands at around 400 nm and 700 nm. The EQEs of typical DPP(TBFu)2:PC70BM and SQ:C60 devices (Fig. 2b) show some complementarity, although some clear overlap is apparent, indicating that the increase in PCE of the tandem device with respect to the sub-cells may be limited. The overall structure of the tandem device is depicted in Fig. 1b.

The structure of both sub-cells is kept identical to that of their respective single junction solar cell analogues, necessitating the use of LiF and BCP as exciton blocking layers on top of each sub-cell active layer. The Al–Au interlayer was kept as thin as possible to minimize light absorption that could induce photocurrent losses in the back sub-cell. However, the tendency of thin layers of gold to be deposited as ‘isle’-like layers,7 together with the extreme roughness of solvent annealed BHJ active layers,5b required the MoO3 to be as thick as possible in order to smoothen the surface before SQ:C60 deposition and thus avoid the formation of a discontinuous SQ/C60 interface. It was found that increasing the MoO3 thickness to 20 nm, compared to the 8 nm required in single junction devices,6a was optimum as no significant change in the J–V characteristics was observed (see the ESI† for MoO3 thickness study).
To best match experimentally the photocurrents of the two sub-cells, reference devices for the back sub-cell were fabricated under optimised conditions on top of a 1 nm Au layer to provide the highest possible PCEs under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3b). The front reference cell of DPP(TBFu)2:PC70BM was subsequently optimized for active layer thickness and SVA time in order to provide devices with JSC slightly higher than that of the reference SQ:C60 back cell. This is to account for the decrease in JSC in the tandem device that arose from the back sub-cell absorbing most of the light reflected back from the Al cathode.

To build the whole tandem device, the front sub-cell active layer was deposited on top of PEDOT:PSS covered ITO substrates, and annealed for times varying slightly from the optimum value (see the ESI† for details), thus maximizing the chances of accurately matching the JSC of the sub-cells by spanning a range of slightly different JSC. The interlayer was subsequently deposited by thermal evaporation, followed by the sequential deposition of the back sub-cell layers. The J–V characteristics of the best performing tandem device are shown in Fig. 3, together with the J–V characteristics and structure of the corresponding reference sub-cells fabricated simultaneously. It can be noted that the VOC of the tandem device equals the sum of the VOC of sub-cells quite accurately, and that the fill factor approaches 60%, which is remarkable for such a structure. The JSC is significantly lower than that of the limiting sub-cell, however, the overall PCE is significantly higher than that of the best performing sub-cell (Table 1).

The rather modest PCE enhancement observed in the tandem device could be entirely explained by the spectral mismatch of the two sub-cells. That is, the front sub-cell absorbs a significant amount of light in the wavelength region of maximum absorption of the back sub-cell, thus implying that the latter does not function at its maximum potential when integrated into the tandem structure. To demonstrate this, and to quantify the losses occasioned by the presence of the front sub-cell, we fabricated a reference back cell in which a layer of PEDOT:PSS and a DPP(TBFu)2:PC70BM active layer were deposited on the front face of the substrate before the fabrication of the reference SQ:C60 device (Fig. 4a).

Comparing the J–V characteristics of this test cell with a standard reference back cell shows that the spectral mismatch between the two sub-cells results in a 32% loss in JSC and a roughly 3% loss in VOC (Fig. 4b). A difference in JSC of a very similar magnitude (30%) is observed between the tandem device and the reference back sub-cell (Table 1, Fig. 3). Additionally, the drop in VOC induced by the light absorption of the front sub-cell is responsible, to a significant extent, for the VOC of the tandem device being lower than expected from the sum of the VOC of the two sub-cells (Table 1).
In conclusion, we established the basis for the fabrication of entirely solution-processed tandem devices based on SM-BHJ active layers. Using a solution and vacuum processed mixed architecture we showed that the limitations inherent to SM-BHJs can be overcome through architecture optimization and rational design of SM donors. We first demonstrated that the extreme roughness of SM-BHJ devices is not a limitation to the fabrication of tandem cells with good characteristics provided that the adequate interlayer and adequate thickness of the electron-blocking layer of the back sub-cell are used. Matching of the JSC of the sub-cells could be achieved experimentally through rational screening of the active layer thickness and annealing time. Finally, using a test architecture we demonstrated that the main limiting factor is the spectral overlap of the sub-cell absorption characteristics. As such, great effort is being invested in the synthesis of solution processable SMs with absorption shifted far into the NIR region for application in solution processed tandem solar cell devices.
