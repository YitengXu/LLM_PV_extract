    , Accepted 25th January 2019First published on 27th February 2019AbstractHalide perovskites have continued to rise as attractive light absorber materials, mainly driven by their potential wide applications in the fields of solar cells, photodetectors, lasers and others. However, Pb-containing perovskites are poisonous and could cause serious potential problems to our environment. Thus, there is a strong desire to develop lead-free perovskites as environmentally friendly alternatives. Here, we have shown a successful synthesis of a non-toxic single crystalline double-halide perovskite, Cs3BiBr6, and analysed its structural characteristics in detail. This perovskite represents a new structure in terms of double-halide perovskites. The crystal structure features isolated BiBr6 polyhedra forming a zero-dimensional halide perovskite. The bandgap of this compound is measured to be 2.55 eV. High thermal stability is also clearly shown in the Cs3BiBr6 single crystal. A photodetector based on this compound is fabricated and tested, which exhibits an impressive detectivity of 0.8 × 109 Jones and low dark current under 400 nm light illumination. Overall, our results show that the Cs3BiBr6 perovskite as a lead-free perovskite has interesting structures and promising properties for optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Halide perovskites have been at the forefront of new-emerging energy materials due to their great potential in the design and fabrication of new-generation optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells,1 photodetectors,2–5 light-emitting devices,6,7 field-effect transistors8,9 and lasers.10,11 Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ABX3 (A = monovalent cation, B = divalent metal, and X = halides)-based solar cells has largely increased from 3.8% to 22.6%, and it aims towards 30% in the future.12–16 Although they possess unique photo-physical properties such as tunable wavelength, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), large carrier diffusion length, long carrier lifetime etc., the current most efficient materials are Pb-containing perovskites. Pb is detrimental to the environment and the human body, potentially causing memory problems and intellectual disability. Therefore, there is a strong desire to replace toxic Pb with a benign element such as Sn, Ge, Bi etc. without drastically reducing the conversion efficiency. However, due to the high-energy-lying 5s orbitals of Sn2+, its oxidation into Sn4+ would undoubtedly leads to drastic performance reduction.17–19 As for Ge-based perovskites, their poor performance makes them lag far behind the other two alternatives.20–22
Among the various alternatives, Bi-based halide perovskites have undergone rapid development. The recently emerged double perovskites, A2BB′X6, in which B is a monovalent metal and B′ is a trivalent metal, have been demonstrated to be stable and environmentally friendly. Visible to near-infrared absorption of Cs2SnI6 nanocrystals exhibited high mobility after being fabricated into field-effect transistors.23 Solar cells based on Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films show a PCE of 2.5%, which represents the highest efficiency among non-lead perovskites.24 Especially for the double perovskite single crystal, a detectable dose rate in the Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal, 59.7 nGyairS−1, was reported to be as low as that of CH3NH3PbBr3 arising from the suppressed ion migration.25
Besides A2BB′X6, the development of the series of A3B2X9 materials is on a par with them. Blue (CH3NH3)3Bi2Br9 quantum dots with a high PLQY of 12% were successfully synthesized.26 As for their all-inorganic counterparts, a PLQY of 19.4% was realized in Cs3Bi2Br9, exhibiting quite good photostability and moisture stability as well.27 Besides Cs3Bi2Br9, the structure of Cs3BiBr6 was also reported to be possible in the literature and predicted to have different optical properties compared with Cs3Bi2Br9. However, the pure phase of Cs3BiBr6 has yet to be achieved and the fine structure remains unknown.28
In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis and structural analysis of a single crystal of Cs3BiBr6 for the first time, which crystallizes in the form of isolated BiBr6 octahedra within a three-dimensional (3D) framework. A photodetector based on this perovskite was fabricated, showing a high detectivity of around 0.8 × 109 Jones under ambient conditions. This material has thus successfully substituted Pb2+ with Bi3+ in the perovskites. Moreover, it enriches the structural family of non-lead perovskites and holds potential for optoelectronic applications.
Experimental section
Chemicals
All chemical reagents were at least of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Bismuth bromide (BiBr3, 99%), cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9%), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Synthesis and crystal growth of Cs3BiBr6
In a typical batch synthesis, BiBr3 (0.0894 g, 0.2 mmol), CsBr (0.1038 g, 0.49 mmol) and HBr (2.5 mL) were mixed in a beaker, which was then transferred into an oven at 110 °C for 2 h. Finally, light yellow crystals were obtained after cooling to room temperature naturally. During the synthesis of the single crystal, if the amount of CsBr was much lower than BiBr3, Cs3Bi2Br9 was obtained. Therefore, controlling the ratio between the two raw materials is a key factor to obtain the single crystals of Cs3BiBr6.
X-ray crystallographic studies
Small crystals of Cs3BiBr6 (∼0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.05 mm) were selected and mounted on glassy fibers for single-crystal XRD measurements. Data collections were performed on a Bruker APEX-II CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. The data sets were corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors as well as for absorption by using a multi-scan method.29 The structure was solved using direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares fitting on F2 by SHELX-97.30 All non-H atoms were refined using anisotropic thermal parameters. The final refined structural parameters were checked by using the PLATON program.31 Crystallographic data and structural refinements are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† The final refined atomic positions and structural parameters are further provided in the ESI† (Tables S2–S4). Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD data was performed by using the Fullprof program.
Material characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Scientific) was performed to analyze the compositions of samples, with Al-Kα (1486 eV) as the excitation X-ray source. The pressure of the analysis chamber was maintained at 2 × 10−10 mbar during measurements. All characterizations were carried out at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) characterizations were carried out on an FEI Quanta FEG 200 ESEM. The absorption behaviours of the samples were studied using the UV-Vis spectrometer from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, USA). Absorption (α/S) data were converted from diffuse reflectance spectra using the Kubelka–Munk function, α/S = (1 − R)2/2R, where R is the reflectance coefficient and α and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients.32 All the photoelectronic characterizations were performed on the Autolab workstation. The phase and purity of all samples were characterized via powder XRD with Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in the Mettler Toledo, StarE System (Columbus, OH, USA) with a GC 100 gas controller in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. It should be noted that all the measurements were performed at room temperature.
Fabrication of photodetectors
Prototype optoelectronic devices were prepared in-house. ITO electrodes were prepared by ultrasonic cleaning in acetone, ethanol, and Milli-Q water successively. Cs3BiBr6 single crystals were dissolved into DMF and then a certain amount of solution was deposited on the device surface by drop-casting, followed by annealing at 100 °C. The working area was 0.004 cm2.
Results and discussion
X-ray analysis indicates clearly that the compound of Cs3BiBr6 crystallizes in the orthorhombic system of space group Pbcm with a = 8.689(2) Å, b = 13.628(1) Å, and c = 27.694(9) Å (Table S1, ESI†). There are two Bi atoms, three Cs atoms, and seven Br atoms in an asymmetric unit. Two independent Bi atoms are located at their Wyckoff position of 4c and 4d, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, each Bi atom is coordinated by six Br atoms, forming BiBr6 octahedra. All of the BiBr6 octahedra are distorted, as illustrated by the bond lengths and angles in Table S3 (ESI†). The 3D framework of Cs3BiBr6 is displayed in Fig. 1c, where all BiBr6 octahedra are isolated from each other forming a 0D perovskite structure. Cs+ cations filled up the spaces left by the unconnected BiBr6 octahedra. In particular, Bi1 locates at the mirror plane while Bi1 and Cs3 form a pseudo-triangular tunnel, which is filled up by Cs2 atoms (Fig. S1a, ESI†). In contrast, Bi1, Bi2 and Cs3 form a square tunnel, where Cs1 atoms are located forming a traditional ABX3 structure. In order to better understand the structural characteristics of this compound, a relationship among Cs3BiBr6, CsPbBr3,33 Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs4PbBr6,34 is discussed, as displayed in Fig. 2. It is known that if one Pb atom is substituted by Ag and the neighboring one is substituted by Bi in CsPbBr3, the perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 forms, where all BiBr6 octahedra are separated by Cs+ and Ag+. This comparison has generally been used to illustrate the relationship between CsPbBr3 and Cs2AgBiBr6. Despite this, there is a clear statement for the relationship between Cs3BiBr6 and Cs2AgBiBr6, where Ag in Cs2AgBiBr6 is substituted by Cs3 in Cs3BiBr6. At the same time, a difference arises, which is that after the incorporation of Cs3, the crystallographic symmetry of Cs3BiBr6 is lower than that in Cs2AgBiBr6, leading to a distinct structural characteristic in Cs3BiBr6. Meanwhile, we could also clearly observe the similarity of Cs3BiBr6 with that of Cs4PbBr6, where one monovalent Cs+ and one divalent Pb2+ are simultaneously substituted by a trivalent Bi atom. Both structures are characteristic of isolated MX6 octahedra, despite being crystallized in different crystal systems. Even compared to its isomers of Cs3BiCl6 and Rb3BiBr6 (Table S5, ESI†),35–37 different crystallographic systems and structures are found. This further reminds us that much more attention is needed for the phase checking of a new material if using the known phase as a reference (Fig. S2, ESI†).

The purity of samples was confirmed via powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3a). The dominant diffraction peaks of 2θ = 13.66°, 20.09°, 22.06°, 29.19°, 30.08°, 32.22°, 39.08°, 44.98°, and 56.43° could be identified to be the crystal planes of (112), (115), (130), (044), (233), (312), (334), (329) and (367), respectively. Furthermore, we used the Fullprof software to check the purity in detail. The Rietveld refinement results show the good agreement between observed (cross) and fitted (solid lines) diffraction patterns with the resulting χ2 of 4.40. This consistency between the experimental and simulated XRD patterns confirms the phase purity of the studied material. Besides, we further confirmed the valence state and the element distribution by XPS measurements (Fig. 3b–e). From the XPS results, we could observe the signals of Cs (3d5/2, 3d3/2, separated spin-orbital components Δ = 14.02 eV), Bi (4f7/2, 4f5/2, Δ = 5.26 eV) and Br (3d5/2, 3d3/2, Δ = 1.10 eV), which indicates their valence (+1, +3, −1, respectively) to be consistent with the formula and confirms the existence of all elements in this material (Fig. 3c–e). Besides, the morphology of the as-synthesized single crystal was measured via SEM, where a smooth surface was observed on the single crystal (Fig. 3f). Elemental composition was mapped by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy to study the elemental distribution (Fig. 3g–i). All elements of Cs, Bi, and Br were observed and distributed uniformly on the surface of the single crystal.

To analyze the optical properties of Cs3BiBr6, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum was measured. Cs3BiBr6 displays an absorption edge at about 485 nm, and the bandgap of the compound was calculated to be 2.55 eV according to the Tauc plot (the inset of Fig. 4). Meanwhile, we also conducted DFT calculations to evaluate the bandgap, which was found to be ∼3.2 eV (Fig. S3, ESI†). The slight difference with the experimental values is attributed to the limitation of the DFT methods.38 In the PL spectra, two emission peaks appear: one peak at 475 nm is due to the band emission and the other peak at 530 nm is due to the defects (Fig. S4, ESI†). Regarding the thermal stability, the samples of Cs3BiBr6 single crystals were heated under a nitrogen atmosphere, as shown in the TGA curve in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It can be observed that Cs3BiBr6 is stable with increasing temperature up to 425 °C, when the onset of weight loss is observed.39,40 As a comparison, CH3NH3PbBr3 was also investigated. For CH3NH3PbBr3, the loss in the weight of the sample starts from 285 °C, while a plateau is seen in the temperature range of 420–455 °C. This step was attributed to the loss of CH3NH3Br. Furthermore, a rapid drop in the weight loss curve is clearly seen above 455 °C, indicating further decomposition of the system. This indicates a higher thermal stability of Cs3BiBr6 than CH3NH3PbBr3.

In order to check the optoelectronic property of Cs3BiBr6, a photodetector was fabricated on ITO electrodes as illustrated in Fig. 5a. The morphology of the film was examined as displayed in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Fig. 5b and Fig. S7 (ESI†) show the I–V characteristics in the dark and under light illumination at different light densities. Obviously, the photocurrent increases with the increase of the light density and voltage. Under a 6 V bias, an ultralow dark current of 0.3 nA was obtained. Fig. 5c shows the dynamic current–time (i–t) curves for the Cs3BiBr6 based photodetectors under repeated switching of 400 nm monochromatic illumination with a light density of 25 mW cm−2. The amperometric i–t curves demonstrate that the device can repeatedly produce stable photocurrent signals in response to periodical light ON and OFF. Upon illumination, the photocurrent increases to 70 nA cm−2 by increasing the voltage up to 8 V. Besides, the photoresponse of the detector versus light power density was also measured, as shown in Fig. 5d. With the increase of the power density, the photocurrent also increases, reaching 50 nA cm−2 under the light density of 25 mW cm−2 at the voltage of 6 V. The above results from i–t curves are consistent with our conclusions from the I–V curves.

(e) Comparison of the responsivity at two different light densities. (f) Comparison of the detectivity at two different light densities. 
Hereafter, we focus on the investigation of responsivity and detectivity of the photodetector. Fig. 5e and f show the responsivity and detectivity of the photodetector versus voltage and light density, respectively. The responsivity (R), which can be understood as an electrical output per optical input, is calculated by the following equation:41 R = (IPC − Idark)/(Pirra·S)(1)where IPC and Idark are currents measured with and without illumination, respectively. Pirra is the irradiation power density and S is the effective working area of the detector. Detectivity (D*) as a figure of merit evaluating the ability to detect weak light can be calculated using eqn (2). D* = R/(2e × Idark)1/2(2)
At the voltage of 6 V, the responsivity of this material can reach ∼25 μA W−1 at a light density of 4 mW cm−2. And its detectivity was calculated to be around 0.8 × 109 Jones. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was calculated to be 0.008% at a voltage of 6 V and a power density of 4 mW cm−2 according to the equation EQE = R·hc/(eλ) (Fig. S8, ESI†). After exposing to 400 nm light illumination, the rise and decay time of the device was extracted to be 50 ms and 60 ms, respectively (Fig. S9, ESI†). Meanwhile, we also checked the photodetection ability of this material toward white light, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). It is clear that the device behaves similarly to that under 400 nm light, although a weak responsivity was observed. At a 6 V bias, the responsivity towards white light was only 0.2 μA W−1, much lower than that under 400 nm wavelength light. In Fig. S11 (ESI†), the stability of the photodetector is shown.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized non-toxic single crystals of a perovskite, Cs3BiBr6. The crystal structure of the perovskite was analyzed for the first time revealing a system of non-overlapping BiBr6 polyhedra. A photodetector based on this perovskite was fabricated, exhibiting a good detectivity of 0.8 × 109 Jones under 400 nm light illumination, demonstrating the potential of the material for its application in optoelectronic devices. Besides, the crystals display high stability against temperature and moisture. Finally, this work offers an example of the utilization of non-toxic perovskites for photodetection. It further facilitates the development of lead-free perovskites toward environment friendly energy conversion devices.
