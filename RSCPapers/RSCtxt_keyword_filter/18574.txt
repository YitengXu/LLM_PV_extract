    , Accepted 9th March 2018First published on 10th March 2018AbstractSince the discovery of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent–organic frameworks (COFs) and zeolite–imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), many of their outstanding properties have been explored such as their large specific surface area, significant gas adsorption, and high catalytic activity. Some kinds of porous coordination polymers (PCPs) and their derivatives have shown high photocatalytic or electrocatalytic activity; thus, they may be able to catalyze the degeneration of organic molecules, the production of hydrogen and oxygen, carbon dioxide reduction, and so on. This review mainly focuses on the electrocatalytic, photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic properties of PCPs including MOFs, ZIFs and COFs. Several experiments have been reported in this article to compare their catalyst properties. Moreover, the reasons why they show these differences have been analyzed. These PCPs can be applied for tackling environmental pollution in water, carbon dioxide reduction and the production of hydrogen, which can help solve the energy crisis, the greenhouse effect and facilitate the utilization of solar energy.Haolin ZhuHaolin Zhu was born in 1998, Shandong Province, China.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, industrialization as well as population growth have led to a large demand for fossil fuels, which brings with it many problems such as energy shortage and the greenhouse effect.1 In fact, the energy crisis and global warming are among the most important problems.2 Ever since these problems arose, many efforts have been made to try to solve them. Photocatalysts as well as electrocatalysts are two kinds of materials that can help solve these problems because they can catalyse many reactions such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction and the degradation of organic contaminants.3
For electrocatalysis, many studies have proposed some ideas to achieve efficient energy conversion. However, most of these designs are based on two-electrode systems, in which the anode part involves some chemical fuel oxidation or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the cathode relates to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, practical application of these systems has not been achieved due to the usually slow rate of oxygen evolution. In the past, electrocatalytic OER, HER and ORR have been extensively studied. Many kinds of catalysts have been designed for these reactions. However, most catalysts have the disadvantage of being unstable or expensive; this makes them not viable commercially.4 Moreover, for photocatalysis, PCPs offer a unique opportunity to integrate various molecular components to achieve light capture and promote photocatalytic CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution. Sunlight can activate the photocatalytic reaction to drive reactions that cannot be performed under normal conditions. Photocatalysis is considered a very important synthesis method for the construction of C–C bonds, but its use is affected by the fact that most organic substrates lack photon absorption in the solar spectrum.5 In particular, there is a lack of research concerning photoelectrocatalysis. Therefore, it is necessary to continue such research. Thus, how to find efficient photocatalysts and electrocatalysts remains a great challenge. TiO2 is regarded as a kind of photocatalyst and Ir/Pt is a kind of electrocatalyst. Actually, TiO2 is used as a commercial photocatalyst, denoted as P-25. Attempts have been made to optimize the structure of TiO2,6 but their prohibitive cost and low efficiency currently restrict their development and application.1,7 Hence, it is crucial to find new types of catalysts.
Recently, work has focused on metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent–organic frameworks (COFs) and zeolite–imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) due to their large specific area, high pore volume and design structures.1 Because of these properties, they are considered in various applications, such as gas absorbers, catalysts and chemical sensors. The metal clusters and organic linkers of these frameworks can be controlled to change their properties.8 MOFs usually show considerable catalytic activity. For instance, MOF-48 as well as MIL-47 can catalyze the oxidation reaction of methane.9 They can be used as photocatalysts and electrocatalysts.10 Sometimes they may be combined with other catalysts, which enlarge the catalytic activity of these complexes.8 Herein, we review the photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis of MOFs, ZIFs and COFs. The history of these frameworks in catalysis is introduced and some experiments and reports are mentioned. Finally, we analyze the outlooks and future perspectives in this area.
2. Methods of determining the catalytic properties
2.1 Determination of the photocatalytic properties
In general, the determination of the photocatalytic properties of MOFs includes the use of MB or RhB as a substrate and a gas, such as CO2, as a substrate. The test methods corresponding to these tests are as follows, respectively.

2.1.1 The degradation of organic pollutants. 
In general, RhB and MB can simulate organic contaminants in water to determine the catalytic effect of MOFs on the decomposition of organic contaminants in wastewater. MB or RhB can be dissolved in an aqueous solution and used as a reaction solution. Since the reaction is an oxidation reaction, the solution should be agitated in the dark for a period of time to dissolve a certain amount of oxygen in the solution and to balance the dissolved/released oxygen in the solution. The solution is then irradiated (commonly using a Xe lamp). Then, the catalyst to be tested is added. Since most MOFs are insoluble in water, the system should be kept in suspension during the reaction by continuous stirring. The remaining concentration of RhB or MB after a certain period of time reflects the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst. The concentration of RhB or MB is reflected by the intensity of absorption at the wavelength of maximum absorption in the UV-visible spectrum. Typically, RhB absorbs at 554 nm and MB at 664 nm.11,12


2.1.2 Heavy metal ion pollution treatment. 
Unlike MB and RhB, Cr(VI) simulates heavy metal ion contaminants in water. Heavy metal ions in water can also cause environmental pollution. Reducing the valence of Cr(VI) by a reduction reaction converts it to an hydroxide to form a precipitate, thereby removing heavy metal ions from the water. The method utilized in this type of experiment is roughly the same as that previously described with RhB or MB, except the experiment was conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent oxidation. A hole scavenger (ammonium oxalate) may also be added before stirring. The concentration of Cr(VI) is reflected by the intensity of absorption at the wavelength of maximum absorption in the UV-visible spectrum, which is usually taken as 540 nm.13


2.1.3 HER, OER and ORR. 
In recent years, research in HER, OER and ORR has become a hot spot for researchers. Some MOFs have photocatalytic activity for these three reactions. Since these three reactions involve the generation, collection and measurement of gases, the test apparatus for these reactions is different from the above. In addition, the amount of generated gas is measured by gas chromatography.14

2.2 Determination of the electrocatalytic properties
In the case of the reaction of a precipitating gas, such as HER and OER, generally, the corresponding MOF and its derivatives can be attached to the electrode substrate. The electrocatalytic performance can be tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Generally, the lower the initial potential, the greater the current, and the better the electrocatalytic properties.15 For some substances, redox reactions, such as hydrogen peroxide oxidation, can be tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using an electrochemical workstation. Here, if a change in the concentration of the substance causes a significant change in the current peak at the electrode where the MOF is present, then the MOF or its derivatives are prove to have good electrocatalytic properties.16
3. Catalytic properties of MOFs
3.1 History of MOFs as catalysts
According to a previous report, good photocatalysts should have certain aspects: (1) suitable topological structures, with a large enough porous volume and channels connecting the pores, (2) redox-active metallic nodes to allow charge separation, and (3) photoresponsive structures that can capture light.17 In fact, many surveys and research studies have been completed concerning the catalytic properties of MOFs, and lots of discoveries have been reported.18 Two key advantages allow MOFs to be used as photocatalysts: first, the high pore volume enables them to enhance the reaction speed, second, their optical absorption characteristics can be adjusted via designing their coordination.19 Modification of their organic linkers and metal ions leads to a variety of electronic structures, which makes it possible to control the chemical and physical properties of MOFs.20 For example, it is possible to increase the band gap of UiO-66, UiO-67 and UiO-68 (UiO = University of Oslo)21via adding more benzene repeating units, which makes their band gap between 2.9 and 4.1 eV.22 The rigidity of the utilized organic linkers enabled carboxylate clusters to form 3D structures.8 In 2007, Alvaro and coworkers studied the degradation of phenol under light in the presence of MOF-5.23 One year later, Cavka et al. managed to prepare UiO-66, with the chemical formula [Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12],24 which was later transformed into a photocatalyst. From then on, many kinds of frameworks were studied by researchers. MIL-101(Fe), MIL-53(Fe) and MIL-88B(Fe) (MIL = Materials Institute Lavoisier)21 were studied, and their photocatalytic activity demonstrated.25 Song et al. pointed out that only if MOFs have stability and can catalyze reactions under natural environment can they be used as catalysts.26 Besides, many kinds of MOFs have valuable optical properties, and they can be used as luminescent materials, visible light photocatalysts and optoelectronic elements.27
3.2 Photocatalytic properties of MOFs
Photocatalysis research is beneficial to take advantage of solar energy and to control the density of chemical reaction sites and chemical selectivity.28 MOFs were first defined by Yaghi et al.29 The large specific surface area as well as orderly structure of MOFs enable them to be used as a new type of photocatalyst. MOFs, through modulation of their organic linkers and metal clusters, in combination with other metal complex catalysts, can adsorb a reactant and accelerate the reactive activity and charge separation efficiency, which enables them to have excellent photocatalytic properties. Generally speaking, there are three key steps related to photocatalysis: (1) light capture, (2) charge separation and transfer, and (3) reaction, which is triggered by the charge.30 Thus, it is important to promote light capture and charge separation. Besides, as for organic semiconductors, once they are activated by light, electrons will jump from the highest occupied molecular orbitals to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. MOFs also follow this rule. However, the inefficiency of separation between the poles and electrons in MOFs limits their application. Hence it is important to improve their photocatalytic activity. Combining MOFs with other catalysts is one solution to help solve this problem. MOFs work as the absorber and absorb gases or organic molecular, while the other catalysts catalyze the reaction.8 From these angles, many kinds of photocatalysts have been prepared.
Wastewater treatment has been related to environmental problems. The organic compounds in sewage can cause eutrophication, which leads to water pollution. However, many MOF-based photocatalysts can catalyze the degradation of organic compounds. Generally, methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB) and many other dyes are used as simulated pollutants, because they are difficult to be decomposed under the irradiation of ultraviolet light and can thus be used as representatives of the pollutants in wastewater.31 They can thus be used to test the catalytic activity of those photocatalysts.32,33 Besides, X3B is also difficult to be decomposed under ultraviolet light, which means it can also be used as a simulated pollutant.34 A lot of experiments have been done in this field.
Wang et al. prepared a kind of MOF via heating a mixture of Bi(NO3)3, KOH, 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (H2mna) and DMF, which was donated as Bi-mna. It could be activated by visible light. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that photogenerated electrons could easily jump to the surface of Bi-mna, which enabled a considerable efficiency for the separation between poles and electrons (Fig. 1a). The photocatalytic activity of Bi-mna for the degradation of RhB was also tested. By contrast, a-Bi2O3 was also tested. The results are shown in Fig. 1b. Clearly, Bi-mna is superior to a-Bi2O3 as a photocatalyst, and it also showed good photocatalytic properties.32 Meng et al. synthesized a MOF, CuI3(L1)2(L2)[PMoVI8VV4O40(VIVO)2]·2H2O, in which L1 = 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene and L2 = 1,2,4,5-tetra(4-pyridyl)-benzene. Its photocatalytic activity was examined in a solution of RhB under the irradiation of ultraviolet light. The results showed that 50% of the RhB was decomposed in the presence of the photocatalyst in 6 h, though this catalytic activity may be a little lower than other catalysts.35 Kozlova et al. studied the photocatalytic activity of nine MOFs, namely UiO-66, UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66-NO2, MIL-100(Al), MIL-100(V), MIL-100(Fe), MIL-100(Cr), MIL-125(Ti) and MIL-47(V). Their ability to catalyze the decomposition of MB under ultraviolet light was studied. All of them exhibited photocatalytic activity for this reaction except MIL-100(Al) and MIL-47(V). UiO-66-NH2 showed the highest catalytic activity among these compounds. In the presence of UiO-66-NH2, the reaction rate reached 1.05 × 10−4 min−1. MIL-100(V) and MIL-100(Fe) also exhibit considerable activity, with reaction rates being 0.86 × 10−4 min−1 and 0.67 × 10−4 min−1.36

MIL-88A was also reported to be able to catalyze the degradation of MB in the presence of H2O2 under visible light, and the catalytic reaction obeyed the first order kinetics. Here, H2O2 worked as an electron acceptor. MIL-88A has a 3D structure formed by an iron(III) octahedral and fumarate dianions.37 MIL-88A could be synthesized according to a previous report. Briefly, a mixture of fumaric acid and FeCl3·6H2O was heated in ultrapure water.38 Its photocatalytic activity was then studied under the irradiation of visible light (Fig. 2). Clearly, almost all the MB was decomposed in the presence of MIL-88A and H2O2 under visible light within 20 min, which meant that MIL-88A exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity.39 MIL-53(Fe), MIL-53(Al) and MIL-53(Cr) were proven to be able to catalyze the degradation of MB, which suggested they could be candidates for organic pollutants treatment. These three MOFs have the same structures. The synthetic strategies of these MOFs were all provided in previous reports. MIL-53(Cr) was obtained via heating a mixture of terephthalic acid (H2BDC), hydrofluoric acid, water and Cr(NO3)3. MIL-53(Fe) was synthesized via heating a mixture of H2BDC, FeCl3·6H2O and DMF.40 Also, H2BDC, Ag(NO3)3 and deionized water were heated in mixture to prepare MIL-53(Al).41 Their photocatalytic activities for the degradation of MB were similar (Fig. 3), which suggested that the structure of MOF was irrelevant to the photocatalytic activity of the MOF.11

Not only should the organic pollutants in wastewater be treated, but also the heavy metal ions too. Cr(VI) is harmful to the ecological environment due to its acute toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenesis.42,43 Hence it is crucial to find an efficient catalyst that can catalyze the reduction of Cr(VI). Wang et al. used TiO2 as a photocatalyst for the reduction of Cr(VI) under ultraviolet light.42 Liang et al. reported MIL-53(Fe) as a photocatalyst for the reduction of Cr(VI). It was non-toxic, inexpensive and stable. Its photocatalytic activity was studied with respect to N-doped TiO2 under visible light (Fig. 4a). Clearly, the photocatalytic activity of MIL-53(Fe) was higher than N-doped TiO2, and indeed almost all the Cr(VI) was reduced in 40 min. In addition, ammonium oxalate and N2 were both beneficial to this reaction, and they showed a synergistic effect (Fig. 4b). Besides, the mixture of RhB could also be treated by MIL-53(Fe) (Fig. 4c and d). MIL-53(Fe) showed excellent stability in the four sets of cycling experiments. About 60% of the Cr(VI) was reduced and 80% of the RhB was decomposed in the mixed system. So MIL-53(Fe) was demonstrated to be a good candidate for wastewater treatment.13 In addition, In-benzenedicarboxylate (MIL-68(In)) and In-2-NH2-benzenedicarboxylate (MIL-68(In)-NH2) were also reported to have photocatalytic activities for the reduction of Cr(VI), and so these were tested. MIL-68(In) had excellent thermal stability and high photocatalytic activity.44 MIL-68(In) was synthesized via mixing 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and In(NO3)3·xH2O under stirring and heating the mixture,45 while MIL-68(In)-NH2 was synthesized via heating a mixture of 2-aminoterephthalic acid, In(NO3)3·xH2O and DMF.46 The results are shown in Fig. 5a. It can be seen that MIL-68(In) showed no photocatalytic activity for this reaction. However, over 90% of the Cr(VI) was reduced in the presence of MIL-68(In)-NH2. Besides, the optimal pH value was 2, which meant that this reaction should be carried out under acidic conditions. Finally, the stability of MIL-68(In)-NH2 was also studied by carrying out three sets of cycling experiments (Fig. 5b), and MIL-68(In)-NH2 was proven to be able to be recycled for at least 3 times.47

HER, OER and ORR, which are related to energy production and translation, have attracted the attention of many researchers. In order to make the best of solar energy, one of the methods is to store the energy in a covalent form in hydrogen.17 Some MOFs are able to selectively regulate HER.48 Many kinds of MOFs can catalyze these reactions so they may be able to be applied to hydrogen and oxygen production. Many MOFs that can catalyze these reactions have indeed been reported. Al is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust, and aluminium carboxylates show excellent chemical and thermal stability,49,50 which means that Al is adequate and useful for many applications. Two kinds of Al-based MOFs were synthesized by An et al., which are termed as Al–TA with the organic linker terephthalic acid and Al–ATA, with the linker 2-amineterephthalic acid. They have special photocatalysis and photoelectric effects, and can catalyze OER. A mixture of terephthalic acid, Al(NO3)3·9H2O and DMF was stirred and heated to gain Al–TA. The procedure to prepare Al–ATA was similar to that for Al–TA, but the terephthalic acid was replaced by 2-amineterephthalic acid. CoPi (cobalt phosphate) is also an abundant compound in the earth's crust and it exhibits catalytic activity for water oxidation.51 It can be combined with Al–ATA and Al–TA to obtain CoPi–Al–ATA and CoPi–Al–TA. Their photocatalytic activity was tested (Fig. 6). It was clear that the production of oxygen was improved a lot via the modification with CoPi. That is, CoPi could improve the catalytic activity of Al–ATA and Al–TA.52 MIL-101 can catalyze OER. Chi et al. studied its photocatalytic activity for OER under visible light with respect to MIL-101-NH2. The results are shown in Fig. 7. About 36.50 μmol O2 was generated in the presence of MIL-101 in 10 min. The optimal pH value was 10.53

MOFs can work directly as photocatalysts. Wu and coworkers reported a kind of copper-based MOF, {[CuII2(DCTP)2]NO3·1.5DMF}n, denoted as 1. It could also catalyze the degeneration of MB. As a result, 70% of MB was degraded in the presence of 1 but without visible light. When both of them co-exist, more than 80% of MB was decomposed.54 Kan et al. studied four kinds of MOFs, namely [Ag7(4,4′-tmbpt)(HL)2(L)(H2O)] (denoted as 2), [NaCd3(4,4′-tmbpt)(L)2(OH)]·H2O (denoted as 3), [Cd3(3,3′-tmbpt)2(L)2-(H2O)2]·3.5H2O (denoted as 4) and [Cd3(3,4′-tmbpt)2(L)2(H2O)]·1.5H2O (denoted as 5). They could also accelerate the degradation of MB under ultraviolet light. According to the report, 3 had the lowest photocatalytic activity among these MOFs, due to its coordination of ions, amount of water molecules and volume of Cd clusters. In fact, there are three-core units in 5, which easily allow electron–hole pairs into the surface of the material, which is beneficial for photocatalysis, while 4 has two-core units. Then a comparative experiment was done to compare the catalytic activity of 2, 3 and 5 (Fig. 8). According to the data, with the existence of 2, 3 and 5, the decomposition rates of MB reached 54%, 65% and 73%, respectively in 1.5 h, while the rate was 24% without catalyst. Hence, the photocatalytic activities of these MOFs were proved.55 Two kinds of Anderson-type polyoxometalate (POM)-based MOFs, namely H{Cu2(μ2-OH)2L3[CrMo6(OH)6O18]}n·4H2O, and {Cu2L4[CrMoVI5MoV(OH)6O18](H2O)4}·4H2O (L3 = N,N′-bis(3-pyridinecarboxamide)-piperazine, where L4 = N,N′-bis(4-pyridinecarboxamide)-piperazine), were reported, which could catalyze the degeneration of MB under the irradiation of ultraviolet light, visible light and sunlight. According to the experiment results, the decomposition ratios of MB in the presence of the two MOFs under the irradiation of ultraviolet light were 94.3% and 82.1%, respectively. For visible light and sunlight, the decomposition ratios were 88.4%, 82.2% and 87.4%, 83.4%, respectively.56 Sun et al. reported several kinds of POM-MOFs, including three-dimensional (3D) [Cu(H2tda)(H2O)2]4[SiW12O40]·12H2O (6), one-dimensional (1D) [Cu2(H2tda)2(H2O)4][SiW12O40]·(TMA)2·3H2O (7) and zero-dimensional (0D) [Cu(H2tda)(H2O)3][SiW12O40]·(TMA)3·H2O (8). Their photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under the irradiation of ultraviolet light was studied and their preparation strategy provided. Compound 6 was synthesized via heating a mixture of H3tda (1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid), CuCl2·2H2O, H4SiW12O40 and distilled water, while 7 was obtained by heating a mixture of H4SiW12O40, CuCl2·2H2O, H3tda, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and distilled water at 100 °C. The synthetic strategy of 8 was similar to that of 7, except for heating the mixture at 70 °C. Compound 6 had a 3D structure, and each structural unit possessed a SiW12 cluster, four H2tda organic linkers and four Cu ions. Different with 6, 7 and 8 had 1D and 0D structures, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity was examined. According to the results (Fig. 9), the conversion rate of RhB reached 90% in the presence of 6, while it was less than 50% in the presence of 8. This phenomenon showed that photocatalytic activity is related to the structure of the photocatalysts. In general, the higher the dimension the photocatalysts have, the higher the efficiency is.57 Two kinds of MOFs whose photocatalytic activity was reflected by the degradation of X3B under visible light were reported: [Ni2(bimb)3(H2O)6·(aobtc)·(DMF)2·(H2O)2]n (9) and [Cd(3,3′,4,4′-bptcH2)(H2O)·(bimb)]n (10) (bimb = 4,4′-bis(1-imidazolyl)biphenyl, 3,3′,4,4′-bptcH4 = 3,3′,4,4′-biphenyltetra-carboxylate acid-aobtcH4 = azoxybenzene-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylic acid). According to the results, 10 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than 9. Their stability was also proved to be excellent.58

A kind of MOF, namely [Co4(pidc)2(Hpidc)4(H2O)3]n·12nH2O (11) (H2pidc = pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid), was prepared and was proven to be able to catalyze the degradation of RhB under visible light. It was synthesized via heating a mixture of H2pidc, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, acetonitrile and distilled water. But 11, which was prepared by this synthetic strategy, was mixed with [Co2(pidc)2(H2O)6]n·2nH2O. The photocatalytic activity of 11b was tested. It was seen that 11 showed excellent catalytic activity under visible light. More than 90% of RhB was decomposed in the presence of 11 under visible light in 1.5 h. However, it could exhibit a higher catalytic activity under visible light if the pH of solution was adjusted to 3 with sulfuric acid. In this circumstance, more than 90% of RhB was decomposed within 20 min.59 Du et al. reported four kinds of MOFs, namely [Zn4(L)2(μ3-OH)2(H2O)1.5]·2H2O (12), [Zn5Na(L)2(μ3-OH)4(CH3CH2O)(H2O)2] (13), [Cd4(L)2(BIME)0.5 (μ3-OH)2(H2O)1.5]·2H2O (14) and [Zn4(L)2(BET)0.5(μ3-OH)2(H2O)] (15) (H3L = (3,5-dicarboxyl-phenyl)-(4-(2′-carboxyl-phenyl)-benzyl) ether, BET = 1,1′-(2′-oxybis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis (1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) and BIME = 1,2-bis(imidazol-1-yl)ethane, and all of them could catalyze the degradation of MB under the irradiation of ultraviolet light. The synthetic strategies were provided in the report. Briefly, 12 was synthesized via heating a mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, H3L, water and ethanol. The synthesis of 13 was similar to that for 12, but NaCO3 was also used as one of the reactants. For the synthesis of 14, Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, BIME, H3L, water and ethanol were mixed together and heated. Also, a mixture of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, BTE, H3L, water and ethanol was heated to obtain 15. They were all colourless crystals. The degradation of MB in the presence of these compounds was studied (Fig. 10). It was clear that in the presence of 12, 13 and 15, the conversion rate of MB could reach 90% within 1.5 h. The photocatalytic activity of 14 was lower than for the other compounds. Also, according to the report, all of these compounds had great stability during the reaction.60

Johnson et al. reported several isologs of an indium-based porphyrin MOF, which was denoted as UNLPF-10 (UNLPF: University of Nebraska–Lincoln Porous Framework). The isologs were denoted as UNLPF-10a, -10b, -11 and -12, and were formed with the combination of porphyrin and a free base, In(III), Sn(VI)Cl2 and Sn(IV), respectively. They could catalyze the oxidation of arylboronic acid. Arylboronic acid was transformed to phenolic compounds in this reaction. As the results show, UNLPF-10a exhibited a lower photocatalytic than the other compounds in this study under visible light. Actually, it can be seen that UNLPF-12 showed the highest catalytic activity. However, it could not show its catalytic ability without air or light, according to entries 7 and 8. Also, cycling experiments were also done according to entry 6. After 4 sets of cycling experiments, the catalytic activity of UNLPF-12 was affected only at the margins, which means that it showed excellent stability during the reaction.61
Many reports also provide mechanisms for the photocatalytic reactions catalyzed by MOFs. MOF-74 has been studied for years. Co-MOF-74 was synthesized via microwave heating, and it was proven to have considerable catalytic activity.62 Zou et al. used the strategy called High Valence Metathesis and Oxidation (HVMO) and obtained four kinds of Ti-MOFs, namely MOF-74(Mg)-Ti, PCN-333(Sc)-Ti, MOF-74(Zn)-Ti and MIL-100(Sc)-Ti. Their catalysis for the degradation of MB under the irradiation of a Xe lamp was examined. According to the results, MOF-74(Mg)-Ti and MOF-74(Zn)-Ti showed the highest photocatalytic activity (Fig. 11a). In the presence of MOF-74(Mg)-Ti or MOF-74(Zn)-Ti, about 98% of MB was decomposed in 3 min. Besides, their photocatalytic activity was higher than TiO2, which indicated that the combination of MOFs and Ti leads to a higher photocatalytic activity. The mechanism of this reaction was also illustrated (Fig. 11b), whereby once the electrons are excited, they are transferred form the organic linker to Ti4+ and form Ti3+. Thus, the organic linker is oxidized and changes into benzoquinone, which is stable. However, MB can deoxidize the benzoquinone, so MB is decomposed. Then, Ti3+ is oxidized by the oxygen in the air. The chemical constituent of the photocatalysts isn't changed and so cyclic catalysis is achieved.63

The derivatives of MOFs were also studied. For instance, Otal et al. modified UiO-66 with N,N-dimethylaniline, 1-naphthol, 2-naphthol, diphenylamine and obtained UiO-66-NH2via a diazo coupling reaction. They could catalyze the degradation of MB. Then the photocatalytic activity of these compounds was tested under visible light in aqueous solution. The results are shown in Fig. 12. It can be seen that all of these materials showed a lower photocatalytic activity than TiO2. The UiO-66 modified with diphenylamine exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity. According to the report, UiO-66 was modified with 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol because of their low surface area.64 Sha et al. reported Ag2CO3/UiO-66 and named them by the molar ratio of Ag to Zr. For example, when the ratio was 1:2, the Ag2CO3/UiO-66 was called AgCO/UiO-66-0.5. Similarly, AgCO/UiO-66-0.1 and AgCO/UiO-66-1 were also prepared. They could promote the degradation of RhB under the irradiation of visible light, and the catalytic properties were tested. According to the results, in the presence of these three materials, MB could be decomposed within 2 h (Fig. 13a). Besides, AgCO/UiO-66-0.5 had the highest photocatalytic activity among these three materials. The rate constants were also provided ifn the report (Fig. 13b). According to Sha et al., the dynamic model of these reactions agreed with a pseudo-first-order kinetic model.65 In addition, Bi2WO6/UiO-66 was also reported by Sha et al., and the naming rule was similar to that for Ag2CO3/UiO-66, which meant it was named by the ratio of Bi and Zr. RhB was here also used as a simulated pollutant in the experiments.

The photocatalytic activities of BWO/UiO-66-2, BWO/UiO-66-1, BWO/UiO-66-0.5 and BWO/UiO-66-0.1 are reflected in Fig. 13c and d. BWO/UiO-66-1 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity among these materials. The stability of Bi2WO6 and UiO-66 led to the stability of Bi2WO6/UiO-66.2 Compared to Ag2CO3/UiO-66, BWO/UiO-66-1 showed a lower activity than AgCO/UiO-66-0.5. So AgCO/UiO-66-0.5 showed the highest catalytic activity among these materials reported by Sha et al. Furthermore, other redox reactions could also be catalyzed by the derivatives of MOFs. MIL-125(Ti) was first reported by Dan-Hardi et al.,66 and is now commonly used as a photocatalyst. N-Hydroxy-carbamates could be oxidized to N-hydroxy-oxazolidinones by UiO-66-NH2 or MIL-CNNSs-MIL-1 wt%-NH2 (CNNSs = carbon nitride nanosheets), and during the reaction MIL-125-NH2 and UiO-66-NH2 worked as photocatalysts.21 Abdelhameed synthesized many derivatives of MIL-125-NH2, including [Ti8O8(OH)4(C10H7NO5)2.82(C11H9NO4)3.18] (denoted as MIL-125-AC-1), [Ti8O8(OH)4(C13H11NO5)4.2(C10H7NO5)0.72(C8H5NO4)1.08] (denoted as MIL-125-AC-2) and [Ti8O8(OH)4(C19H28NO8CrCl)4.2(C10H7NO5)0.72(C8H5NO4)1.08] (denoted as Cr-MIL-125-AC). They could all catalyze the degradation of MB under visible light. Ag-MIL-125-AC could also be obtained by doping MIL-125-AC-2 with silver, while Cr-MIL-125-AC was obtained by doping with chromium. Their photocatalytic activities were studied. It was known that Ag-MIL-125-AC shows the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light. Much more than 90% of MB was decomposed in the presence of Ag-MIL-125-AC within 1 h. Cr-MIL-125-AC also exhibited considerable catalytic activity. While the degradation was carried without light, MB was just absorbed by these compounds. It was proved that MIL-125-NH2 had the largest absorption of MB among these compounds. Besides, 5 sets of cycling experiments were carried and Ag-MIL-125-AC was proved to be stable during the reaction.67 N-K2Ti4O9/MIL-101 was prepared via heating a mixture of N-K2Ti4O9, 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, and hydrofluoric acid, in which N-K2Ti4O9 showed an electrical conductivity capability, while MIL-101 could work as an absorber. It could also catalyze the degradation of RhB under visible light.68 MIL-88B(Fe) also exhibited high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB and RhB. Its photocatalytic activity under visible light was studied. The concentrations of RhB and MB reduce quickly in 1 h, which showed that they were decomposed in the presence of MIL-88B(Fe). Thus demonstrating it had considerable photocatalytic activity.69
MIL-125(Ti) displays certain photocatalytic activity only under the irradiation of ultraviolet light, and the electron–hole pairs in MIL-125(Ti) usually combine again after they separate, which lead to its limited photocatalytic activity. Yuan et al. modified MIL-125(Ti) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) in order to improve the photocatalytic activity of MIL-125(Ti). Graphene oxide (GO) was dispersed in ethanol, and AgNO3 and MIL-125(Ti) were then added into the solution, and the solution was irradiated by ultraviolet-visible light to obtain Ag/rGO/MIL-125(Ti). Then, Ag/rGO/MIL-125(Ti) was obtained. In this process, GO was reduced to rGO and AgNO3 was reduced to Ag NPs. RhB was chosen as the simulated pollutant in the experiment to study the photocatalytic activity of Ag/rGO/MIL-125(Ti). The results are shown in Fig. 14a. It is obvious that Ag/rGO/MIL-125(Ti), rGO/MIL-125(Ti) and Ag/MIL-125(Ti) showed excellent photocatalytic activity. About 90% of RhB was removed in the presence of these composites.70 What improved the photocatalytic activity was that the rGO is an excellent electron transporter. Electron–hole pairs are more likely to be generated in the presence of rGO.70–72 Also, the reusability of Ag/rGO/MIL-125(Ti) was also studied (Fig. 14b). The removal efficiency of each experiment was a little lower than in the former experiments, which means the structure of Ag/rGO/MIL-125(Ti) was affected during the reaction.70 MIL-53(Fe) was also combined with rGO and the composite was denoted as M53–rGO. It could catalyze the reduction of Cr(VI). In order to prepare M53–rGO, MIL-53(Fe) and GO were dispersed in water, respectively, and then mixed and stirred. Then, the solid was gathered. M53–rGO was obtained by dissolving this part of the solid in ethanol and heating. The mass of GO in this process was crucial to the properties of M53–rGO. When the mass ratio of GO was 0.5%, M53–rGO showed the highest photocatalytic activity.73 In2S3@MIL-125(Ti) was synthesized, and could catalyze the degradation of tetracycline. Different composites could be obtained by controlling the mass ratio of MIL-125. According to the report, up to 63.3% of the tetracycline was decomposed in 1 h. Tetracycline was difficult to be removed from the solution entirely, but In2S3@MIL-125(Ti) was shown to be beneficial for wastewater treatment.74

Some dyes are also known to be able to be used to modify MOFs to form a new kind of photocatalyst. Erythrosin B was used to modify UiO-66 so that the composite had photosensitivity. It showed photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. In order to form the catalytic system, H2PtCl6 was added to a solution of UiO-66 to gain Pt-UiO-66. Then, Pt-UiO-66 and a certain amount of Erythrosin B to L-ascorbic acid were also added. Finally the solution was treated by Ar, and the catalytic system was obtained. Different photocatalysts were obtained and named after the amount of Erythrosin B added, e.g. when 5 mg of Erythrosin B was added, the photocatalyst was named UiO-66-5. Different catalysts were used to catalyze hydrogen production so as to test their photocatalytic activity under the irradiation of visible light. The results are shown in Fig. 15a. Clearly, UiO-66-30 showed the highest photocatalytic activity. In the presence of UiO-66-30, the hydrogen release rate was 4.6 μmol h−1. Then, the stability of UiO-66-30 was also tested via three sets of cycling experiments. Every cycle was about 10 h. According to Fig. 15b, the hydrogen production in the third cycle was about 80% of the first cycle. So UiO-66-30 had considerable stability. The reduction of hydrogen production was due to the instability of Erythrosin B, as it may be consumed during the reaction, or decomposed under the irradiation of light.75 Besides, methyl red was used to modify MIL-125(Ti) and then MR-MIL-125(Ti) was obtained. This had photocatalytic activity for the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under visible light, and the reaction rate was 87 nmol min−1 g−1.76

Besides, some dyes can improve the photocatalytic activity of MOFs or their derivatives. For instance, Zhen et al. encapsulated a Ni–Mo cluster into MIL-101 so as to obtain NiMo@MIL-101, and it showed excellent photocatalytic activity for HER under visible light in the presence of Eosin Y (EY), with the system called EY–NiMo@MIL-101. The hydrogen production reached 1480.4 μmol in the presence of EY–NiMo@MIL-101. The hydrogen production in the presence of EY–NiMo@MIL-101 was compared with Mo@MIL-101, Ni@MIL-101 and EY–MIL-101, and the photocatalytic activity of EY–NiMo@MIL-101 was proved to be the highest among these composites. In addition, EY–NiMo@MIL-101 showed the highest photocatalytic activity when the weight ratio of Ni and Mo was 1:1.77 Hence, we can summarize that the organic dyes and MOFs may have three relations: (1) the degradation of dyes are catalyzed by MOFs or their derivatives, (2) MOFs may be able to be modified with dyes to form composites so that their catalytic activities are improved, and (3) MOFs exhibit higher catalytic activity in the presence of dyes. Surface active agents were also used to modify MOFs. Pluronic P123 was used to modify MIL-125-NH2 by a method according to a previous report with some modification.78 Pluronic P123 was dissolved in DMF and the solution was stirred; then, TPOT (Ti-(OC3H7)4) and H2BDC-NH2 (2-amino-benzenedicarboxylic acid) were added. Finally, the mixture was heated to obtain the composite, which was denoted as SMIL-NH2. Both SMIL-NH2 and MIL-125-NH2 could catalyze the deoximation reaction of acetophenone oxime under the irradiation of blue LED lamps. Their photocatalytic activities were compared with P-25. According to the results (Fig. 16), SMIL-NH2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity. The reaction was finished in 10 h in the presence of SMIL-NH2.79 According to a previous report, POMs have a high photocatalytic activity for HER.80 Kong et al. doped [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) with [Ni4·(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− (Ni4P2). This was shown to be an effective photocatalytic HER catalyst.81 A composite of HKUST-1 and BiVO4, which was denoted as HKUST-1-MOF–BiVO4, was prepared by Mosleh et al., and can catalyze the degradation of rose bengal (RB) and disulfine blue (DB) under the irradiation of visible light. The synthesis strategy was provided in the report. HKUST-1 could be synthesized via heating a mixture of H3BTC, Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O, H2O, DMF and ethanol.82–84 HKUST-1-MOF–BiVO4 could be synthesized via treating a mixture of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, NH4VO3, nitric acid, HKUST-1 and water by ultrasonic waves and heating it. Sonocatalysis, photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis for the degradation of DB and RB in the presence of HKUST-1-MOF–BiVO4 were tested, and according to the results, sonophotocatalysis had the highest efficiency, which means that sonocatalysis and photocatalysis have a synergistic effect. Sonophotocatalysis of the degradation of DB as well as RB was also studied with respect to HKUST-1 and BiVO4 (Fig. 17). It was clear that HKUST-1-MOF–BiVO4 had the highest catalytic activity among these materials. Besides, 5-cycle experiments were carried out to test the stability of HKUST-1-MOF–BiVO4, and the results showed that it was stable under visible light. From this study, we know that HKUST-1-MOF–BiVO4 exhibited considerable catalytic activity, and that sonocatalysis and photocatalysis have a synergistic effect which may be beneficial to improve the catalytic efficiency.84 Ag3PO4/Bi2S3–HKUST-1-MOF was synthesized and showed great photocatalytic activity for the degradation of trypan blue dye. Also, here again, it was better to combine photocatalysis and sonocatalysis.85

Cu3(BTC)2@SiO2 with a core–shell structure was prepared. It could catalyze the degradation of phenol. In order to obtain Cu3(BTC)2@SiO2, tetraethylorthosilicate was added to a mixture of NaOH, H3BTC, ethanol, DMF and deionized water under ultrasonication, and the precipitate was gathered via centrifugation. The precipitate was diluted with ethanol, and a sol–gel spin-coating method was used to paint Cu3(BTC)2@SiO2 onto glass slides. The samples were named after the length of painting time, namely, film 1.5 h, film 2 h and film 2.5 h. These films were used to catalyze the degradation of phenol under visible light. Only in the presence of H2O2 did they exhibit high photocatalytic activity. In the presence of these films and H2O2, the decomposition rate of phenol was more than 90%. The effect of pH on the catalytic activity of film 2 h was also studied. According to the results, when the pH was lower than 6, film 2 h showed a high catalytic activity. The results of the five sets of cycle experiments illustrated that film 2 h was very stable during the reaction. This study points out that the membrane of MOFs may show excellent catalytic activity and stability.86
MOFs can not only work as photocatalysts, but can also be used to synthesize photocatalysts. Shi et al. reported a combination of Cu-MOF and [SiW11O39Ru(H2O)]5−, in which Cu-MOF worked as a copper catalyst and [SiW11O39Ru(H2O)]5− worked as a photocatalyst. This kind of material can show high photocatalytic activity, even though the MOF doesn't work as the photocatalyst.87 According to Mahata et al., GdCoO3 could be prepared via the calcination of a kind of MOF, [Gd(H2O)3Co-{C5N1H3(COO)2}3]. Here, pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, Co(OAc)2·4H2O and Gd(NO3)3 were dissolved in water, and the solution was heated to gain the MOF. Then, the MOF was calcined in the air at 400 °C, and 3 nm sized GdCoO3 could be obtained. Similarly, the MOF was calcined at 700 °C and 800 °C to prepare 12 and 200 nm sized GdCoO3, respectively. Four dyes and four kinds of phenolic compounds were used to test the photocatalytic activity of these three kinds of GdCoO3, whereupon GdCoO3 showed considerable activity. GdCoO3 showed photocatalytic activity rather than the MOF, and instead the MOF worked as a precursor.88 Similarly, MIL-125-NH2 was also used as the precursor to form a composite of gold nanoparticles (GNP) and TiO2, which was denoted as GNP/TiO2. GNP/TiO2 was proved to have photocatalytic activity.89 MIL-125 was also calcined to prepare TiOx/C, which could catalyze the degradation of MB. But the photocatalytic activity of TiOx/C seemed to not be very high.90 Besides, TiO2 was encapsulated in NH2-MIL-101(Cr) to improve its photocatalytic activity.91
Nanorods or nanoparticle of MOFs were used to modify copper nanowires under the irradiation of microwaves. Once the material was illuminated by light, a photogenerated electron is generated, which enables the material to catalyze the decomposition reaction of water. Hence this kind of copper nanowires may be good candidates to replace noble metals as a photocatalyst for H2 production.92
Lee et al. inserted TiO2 into cobalt(II) benzenedicarboxylate (Co-BDC) or cobalt (II) 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (Co-NDC) using layer-by-layer (LbL) technology, and the MOFs were doped with iodine. By doing this, the electrical conductivity of the MOFs were improved, and the solar power conversion efficiency of this system was 1.12%.93 A metalloporphyrin (MnPor-MOF) film was synthesized by Zhou et al. via layer-by-layer technology too. The substrate was alternately soaked in an ethanol solution of [5,10,15,20-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin] Mn(III), zinc (II) acetate as well as 2,2′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridine. Then, a MnPor-MOF film was obtained after the substrate was washed. The photocatalytic activity of this film for the degradation of MB was studied in the presence of H2O2 under the irradiation of visible light. About 90% of MB was decomposed in the presence of the MnPor-MOF film and H2O2 under the irradiation of visible light. However, if H2O2 or visible light is absent, the photocatalytic activity of MnPor-MOF film will be affected.94 Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) core–shell microspheres were also prepared via a layer-by-layer strategy, and could catalyze the degradation of MB under visible or ultraviolet light. The system was also beneficial in terms of economy and environmental protection and suitable for large-scale industrial processing. Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) core–shell microspheres were synthesized according to the report. The photocatalytic activity was studied in the presence of MB and H2O2 under ultraviolet-visible light and visible light. According to Fig. 18a, more than 99% of MB was decomposed in the presence of H2O2 and Fe3O4 @MIL-100(Fe) within 40 min. But as shown in Fig. 18b, MB was decomposed in the presence of H2O2 and Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) in about 200 min, which means ultraviolet-visible light is more suitable for this reaction. What is worth mentioning is that the photocatalytic activity of Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) was similar to MIL-100(Fe), but Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) could be gathered by its magnetism. Thus, it is a good candidate for wastewater treatment.95 Interestingly, Zhao et al. used a cycle assembly to prepare Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe), which could also catalyze the degradation of MB.96 Similarly, Pd@MIL-100(Fe) was synthesized and showed photocatalytic activity for the degradation of theophylline, bisphenol A and ibuprofen under the irradiation of visible light. It was prepared by refluxing a mixture of polyvinylpyrrolidone, H2PdCl4, ethanol and water. Its photocatalytic activity was tested. As a result, Pd@MIL-100(Fe) showed excellent photocatalytic activity only if in the presence of H2O2. The photocatalytic activity of Pd@MIL-100(Fe) was measured to be very high, and could lead to the degradation of almost all the theophylline and ibuprofen in about 2.5 h, and achieve more than 60% degradation of bisphenol A in 4 h. Acidic conditions were more suitable for the degradation of theophylline, while alkaline conditions were more suitable for the degradation of bisphenol A and ibuprofen. This system may also be suitable for wastewater treatment.97

Some materials, such as MIL-101(Cr), exhibit high stability in catalytic reactions,98 but they may not be able to be used in catalytic reactions directly because they may lack functional groups or reactive sites. Their performance can be improved by taking advantages of organic functional groups, metal ions or other structures of other compounds.99,100 In this vein, Qin et al. proposed a synthesis strategy that allowed iron complexes to be grafted onto amine-functionalized MOFs. MIL-53-NH2(Al) and MIL-101-NH2(Al) were reported to be good candidates for this modification.99
Doping can also improve the photocatalytic activity. Kaur et al. doped MOFs with quantum dots (QDs) to gain CdTe QD/Eu-MOF. The synthesis of this was also provided in the report. Briefly, Eu-MOF was synthesized via heating a mixture of Europium nitrate, 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (H3BTB) and methanol. NaBH4 and tellurium powder were then dispersed in distilled water under a nitrogen atmosphere and NaHTe solution was obtained. Afterwards, CdCl2·5H2O and cysteamine were dissolved in distilled water. Then, the NaHTe solution was added to the mixed solution and the mixture was heated, followed by the addition of 2-propanol. Then, CdTe QDs were obtained by centrifugation. The CdTe QDs solution was mixed with Eu-MOF and triethylamine was added. CdTe QD/Eu-MOF was obtained after filtration and washing. The photocatalytic activity of QD/Eu-MOF, Eu-MOF and CdTe QD were tested via the degradation of Rhodamine 6G (Fig. 19a). According to the figure, in the presence of QD/Eu-MOF, 98% of Rhodamine 6G was decomposed in 50 min. Besides, the decomposition of Rhodamine 6G at different concentrations was also studied (Fig. 19b and c). QD/Eu-MOF at a concentration of 5 mg L−1, when the concentration of Rhodamine 6G was less than or equal to 2 mg L−1, caused it to be almost completely decomposed in 50 min. Also, QD/Eu-MOF at a concentration of 50 mg L−1 could catalyze the decomposition of Rhodamine 6G at a concentration of 10 mg L−1. It could thus be seen that CdTe QD/Eu-MOF is an efficient photocatalyst. Also, more QD/MOFs could be synthesized and their photocatalytic abilities should be tested.101 According to a previous report, nitrogen doping may significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of materials.102 Saha et al. doped Zn(II)-based low-molecular-weight metallohydrogel (ZAVA) with CdS QDs to form a CdS@ZAVA gel, which could catalyze water oxidation under visible light.103

Noble metals are not very suitable for photocatalysis due to their prohibitive cost and low stability during the reaction. However, they can be doped into MOFs so as to improve the photocatalytic activities of MOFs. For instance, MIL-125(Ti)-NH2 was doped with Pt and Au. According to Sun et al., Pt and Au could evidently improve the photocatalytic activity of MIL-125(Ti)-NH2.104 Pt could also modify MIL-53-NH2 to improve its photocatalytic activity.105 In order to improve the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors, we can dope semiconductors with MOFs, which generates more composites and promotes the separation between pores and electrons. HKUST-1 was used for the in situ synthesis of Cu nanoparticles, which were inserted into TiO2. HKUST-1 was combined with TiO2 to form Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2.106 The mixture of HKUST-1, ethanol and tetrabutyl titanate was stirred for a while and some water as well as hydrofluoric acid were added to the mixture, and the mixture was again stirred and heated several times to obtain Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2.107 Then, the core of HKUST-1 was eliminated, leaving Cu nanoparticles in the structure. However, the octahedron structure of HKUST-1 was still retained in Cu/TiO2. When Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 was heated at 500 °C to obtain Cu/TiO2, the production was called Cu/TiO2-500 °C; while when Cu3(BTC)2@TiO2 was heated and deoxidized by ascorbic acid (AA) in glycol (EG), the production was called Cu/TiO2–AA. The rate of hydrogen production in the presence of Cu/TiO2–AA, Cu/TiO2-500 °C with respect to the TiO2 shell and Cu nanoparticles was tested. According to the results, Cu/TiO2–AA showed a higher photocatalytic activity than Cu/TiO2-500 °C and the TiO2 shell. The rate of hydrogen production in the presence of Cu/TiO2–AA was 62.16 μmol g−1 h−1, which meant it had high photocatalytic activity. Thus, it was shown to be feasible to improve the efficiency of photocatalysts via using MOFs as sacrificial templates.106 A Mg-based MOF denoted as Mg2(DOBDC), (DOBDC = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), or CPO-27-Mg, was reported to be combined with TiO2 to form CPO-27-Mg/TiO2. It could catalyze the reduction of CO2 under the irradiation of ultraviolet light. CPO-27-Mg had a CO2 adsorption of 35.2 wt%, so it could work as a CO2 absorber. Mg2+ works as an alkaline metal ion site, and is helpful to capture CO2.108 Also, TiO2 can work as a catalyst. CPO-27-Mg/TiO2 could be synthesized via heating a mixture of H4DOBDC (2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), THF, Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, NaOH, and TiO2 nanospheres and deionized water. According to research, the material showed the highest photocatalytic activity when the content of CPO-27-Mg was 39.3%. Most importantly, it exhibited excellent stability when it worked as a photocatalyst.109 Carbon nitride is a kind of polymeric photocatalyst, and it was combined with MIL-100(Fe) by Hong et al. Carbon nitrite falls off to form 2D carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNSs), which is the framework of the composite. The composite was denoted as CNNSs-MIL. Different composites were named after the mass fraction of CNNSs, such as CNNSs-MIL-0.5 wt%, CNNSs-MIL-1 wt%, CNNSs-MIL-2 wt% and CNNSs-MIL-5 wt%. Their photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB was also studied. As a result, all of these composites exhibited high catalytic activity under visible light. Among these composites, CNNSs-MIL-1 wt% showed the highest activity. Almost all the RhB was decomposed in the presence of CNNSs-MIL-1 wt% in 4 h.110
Fe3O4@C/Cu and Fe3O4@CuO were also prepared via using a MOF as a sacrificial template. Fe3O4@HKUST-1, which was reported in 2012,111 worked as a sacrificial template. Fe3O4@C/Cu could be obtained via calcination carbonization in an atmosphere of nitrogen, while Fe3O4@CuO could be obtained via calcination carbonization in an atmosphere of air. Fe3O4@C/Cu had higher photocatalytic activity for catalyzing the degradation of MB than Fe3O4@CuO in the presence of H2O2. According to the report, when more H2O2 was added to the reaction system, a higher catalytic activity of Fe3O4@C/Cu was seen. The photocatalytic activities of Fe3O4@HKUST-1, Fe3O4@C/Cu, Fe3O4@CuO were studied under visible light and compared with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), C/Cu, Fe3O4 and TiO2. According to the report, Fe3O4@C/Cu exhibited the highest catalytic activity, among these materials.112 Also, g-C3N4 showed high catalytic activity, which agrees with previous reports.113,114 MIL-125(Ti) could be modified with g-C3N4 to form g-C3N4/MIL-125(Ti), which could catalyze the degradation of RhB and also exhibited high stability during the reaction.12
The reduction of carbon dioxide has been a research hotspot. As mentioned above, the global energy crisis and global warming are two important problems that we are faced with today. The reduction and fixation of carbon dioxide can not only reduce greenhouse gases, but can also provide energy for human activities.3,115–117 Li et al. reported three kinds of MOFs that could catalyze the reduction of CO2 and the degeneration of RhB.118 Besides, UiO-66-NH2 and MIL-125-NH2 can also catalyze the reduction of CO2 under the irradiation of visible light. Carbon dioxide is transferred to HCOO− in this reaction. Interestingly, only when UiO-66 and MIL-125-NH2 are aminated do they exhibit photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2.119,120
Some organic synthesis reactions were reported to be catalyzed by MOFs. MIL-68(Fe) and MIL-100(Fe) were used as photocatalysts for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol under visible light, and the photocatalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe) for this reaction was tested. According to the results, the conversion ratio of benzene in the presence of MIL-100(Fe) was 30.6% after 24 h. Also, the stability of MIL-100(Fe) during the reaction was also studied via three sets of cycling experiments, and it was proved to be stable. Though the conversion ratio of benzene wasn't very high, this study highlighted that photocatalytic reactions catalyzed by MOFs may also be applied for some organic syntheses.121 Also, MIL-101 can be used as a catalyst in the synthesis of some spices and drugs, which can help solve the lack of the natural sources of these products.48
Porphyrin can be applied for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis due to its specifical catalytic activity, and it can be used as a chemical sensor.122 A Cu porphyrin (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin)-based MOF, denoted as SCu, was reported. It could catalyze the reduction of carbon dioxide. Here, CO2 was reduced to methanol, which could be used as a fuel. The productive rate of methanol was 262.6 ppm g−1 h−1, which represents a considerable rate.3
In addition, many kinds of MOFs can be applied for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). An indium-based MOF ((Me2NH2)[InL]·3(H2O)·0.5DMF, donated as NNU-32, L: [5,5′-(anthracene-9,10-diylbis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))diisophthalic]), could catalyze ATRP. NNU-32 could be prepared via heating a mixture of H4L[5,5′-(anthracene-9,10-diylbis(ethyne-2,1-diyl))diisophthalic acid], In(NO3)3·4H2O, hydrochloric acid, DMF and H2O. UV was used to assess the adsorption of light by MMU-32, and it exhibited an adsorption band between 400 nm and 650 nm. According to the report, NNU-32 could catalyze the in situ synthesis of a cuprous activator, then the cuprous activator could initiate ATRP. The efficiency of this catalytic experiment was examined under visible light. The conversion of raw material is shown in Fig. 20a. Clearly, this polymerization could easily be controlled by light, and the conversion reported was considerable. The mechanism of this polymerization was also provided in the report (Fig. 20b); whereby In-MOF offers an electron to Cu(II), and Cu(II) is transformed into Cu(I). In exchange, the copper compound provides In-MOF with an anion. Then, the In-MOF cation can be deoxidised by an amine. Up to here, NNU-32 has finished the catalytic reaction of the cuprous activator production. Hence, MOFs can be applied for the catalysis of ATRP.10 However, the prohibitive cost of indium may restrict the development of NNU-32.
 Fig. 20  (a) ATRP with the presence of NNU-32. (b) Mechanism of ATRP induced by light.10 
The factors that influence the photocatalytic activity have also been studied. The size of the molecules can influence the efficiency of the reaction. MOF-5 is a commercially available material. It has the ability to perform heterogeneous catalysis and can be used as an adsorber.123 It has been used to catalyze the degradation of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (DTBP) and phenol. However, under similar circumstances, the decomposition ratio of DTBP is higher than that of phenol. Half of the phenol was decomposed in 3 h while almost all the DTBP was decomposed during the same time. According to the report, it is the volume of DTBP and phenol that causes the difference. Phenol is much smaller than DTBP, which enables it to get into the pore of MOF-5. However, it is difficult to induce the photocatalytic reaction except on the surface of MOF-5. Hence it is more difficult for phenol to be decomposed than DTBP.124 Photocatalysis is also related to chirality. Wu et al. reported two kinds of MOFs as enantiomers.125 Chiral MOFs are suitable for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis because they can control the shape of materials through their pores and embedded chiral functional groups.126–128 A triphenylamine group and L- or D-pyrrolidin-2-ylimidazole were set in a framework to obtain Zn-PYI1 and Zn-PYI2. These were enantiomers. The triphenylamine group induced the motion of photogenerated electrons, while the L- or D-pyrrolidin-2-ylimidazole promoted the asymmetrical catalytic reaction. They showed a synergistic effect according to the research of Wu et al. It has been proved that the asymmetric selectivity of combining a photocatalyst with an asymmetric catalyst in a MOF is superior to a simple combination of photocatalysis and asymmetric catalysis.125
To sum up, MOFs are promising for use in photocatalysis, due to their distinctive structures and photoexcitation activity. Lots of measures have been adopted to promote light capture and charge separation in order to improve the photocatalytic activity, such as combining MOFs with dyes, functionalization of ligands and uniting MOFs and photosensitizers or photocatalysts. Among the materials mentioned above, MIL-88A, MIL-53(Fe), Pd@MIL-100(Fe), CNNSs-MIL, Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) and some other compounds exhibit outstanding photocatalytic activities. According to those previous reports, photocatalysis can be applied for wastewater treatment, hydrogen production, carbon dioxide reduction and organic synthesis. The efficiency of these photocatalysts should be improved and the costs should be controlled. So further research on them ought to be carried out.
3.3 Electrocatalytic properties of MOFs
Nowadays, seeking a renewable energy source has become one of the most important issues facing modern society. Electrocatalysis is the most used catalytic method for HER, OER and ORR, which can provide renewable energy. Jahan et al. combined GO with Cu-MOF, which showed electrocatalytic activity for OER, HER and ORR, but the power density of this composite was only 76% of the traditional commercial Pt catalyst.129 MOFs can used as electrocatalysts. Some MOFs have photovoltaic characteristics.130 In general, the many shortcomings of MOFs make it difficult to apply MOFs to electrocatalysis. For instance, most MOFs have poor electron-conductive properties, which make them unable to work as electrocatalysts.131,132 Hence, many strategies have been discovered to solve this problem.131,133–135 For example, MOF films can be functionalized with ferrocene carboxylate.136 The catalysts are usually processed into membranes or spheres in order to simplify the recycling technology in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. However, many MOFs have proven to be brittle crystals, so their electrode needs to be made with polymer binders or other additives. These additives can downgrade the conductivity of electrodes made of MOFs and may clog up the pores, which may affect the electrocatalytic performance. Thus, the electrodes of MOFs without polymer binders are sought.137 Actually, a lot of studies have been done to find the most suitable electrocatalysts for various applications. In general, the electrocatalytic activities of various catalysts are tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV).
MOFs that work as electrocatalysts can catalyze redox reactions. Cu3(BTB)2(H2O)3·(DMF)9(H2O)2, which is commonly called MOF-14, is reported to be able to catalyze the reduction of H2O2 and the oxidation of glucose. In order to prepare MOF-14, a mixture of H3BTB, dimethyl sulfoxide, Cu(OH)2, HNO3, DMF and deionized water was heated. A peak of the oxidation current appears at 0.7 V, which shows that MOF-14 exhibits good electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of glucose (Fig. 21a). Similarly, CVs of the reduction of H2O2 also show the considerable electrocatalytic activity of MOF-14 for the reduction of H2O2 (Fig. 21b). Thus, MOF-14 may be a good candidate for electrochemical sensors.14 OER, HER and ORR can occur in the presence of MOFs or their derivatives working as electrocatalysts. PdCo alloy can be combined with N-doped carbon to form PdCo@CN, which shows electrocatalytic activity for HER. The composites are named after the molar ratio of Pd:Co. For instance, when Pd:Co = 1:6, the material is named S-6. The overpotentials of S-10, S-8 and S-6 are 100 mV, 85 mV and 80 mV when the current density is 10 mA cm−2, which are lower than Co@CN. The stability of S-6 was also tested. The hydrogen reduction in the presence of S-6 did not change after 10000 cycles, which indicated that S-6 had high electrocatalytic activity.138

A kind of Co-MOF was synthesized by Yang et al. via stirring a mixture of H2pbda (H2pbda = 3-(pyridine-3-yloxy)benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid), Co(AC)2·4H2O, 4,4-bipyridine, KOH and distilled water and it represented a kind of electrocatalyst with a peroxidase-like activity. Once it reacts with H2O2, the colour of the solution changes, so it can be applied for H2O2 detection.139 MoP nanoparticles absorbed in porous carbon were prepared using UiO-66, and the composite MoP@PC was obtained. Its synthetic strategy is shown in Fig. 22. It demonstrated electrocatalytic activity for HER. Its onset potential was 77 mV, which is very low. Its electrocatalytic activity after 200 cycles was the same as in the initial one, so it showed excellent stability during the reaction. Its electrocatalytic properties were also excellent.140

Sometimes MOFs are used as a precursor to prepare an electrocatalyst. Sulfur codoped carbon substrate, denoted as NiS@N/S–C, exhibits god electrocatalytic activity for OER. The overpotential was 417 mV when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, which is superior to many electrocatalysts, according to the report.141 Co-MOF-71 ([Co(bdc)(DMF)], in which bdc refers to 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), could be transformed into porous cobalt hydroxides, which have good electrocatalytic activity.142 Co-naphthalenedicarboxylate MOF is grown on the copper foil and the MOF is carbonized to form a Co3O4–carbon nanowire, which can be directly used as an oxygen evolution electrode. The specific surface area of this electrode was 251 m2 g−1, which is beneficial for the release of oxygen. Its initial potential was 1.47 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is a relatively low value. It could maintain a current density of 10.0 mA cm−2 at the potential of 1.52 V, and its faradaic efficiency reached 99.3%. Besides, its stability was proved to be good, so it is consider suitable to be used as an electrocatalyst.15 Ania et al. reported a composite formed by HKUST-1 and GO, which could catalyze the ORR.143 In addition, many new composites have been found to have high electrocatalytic activities, such as ε-MnO2/MOF(Fe).144 MIL-53-NH2(Fe) doped with Co was carbonized and the products named after the ratio of Fe:Co and the carbonization temperature, such that when the molar ratio of Fe:Co was 1:3 and the carbonization temperature was 550 °C, the product was called MOF (Fe1–Co3)550N. It showed electrocatalytic activity for the OER. The kinetics and stability of MOF (Fe1–Co3)550N during the reaction were studied with respect to RuO2 (Fig. 23). Its overpotential was 0.39 V when the current density was 10 mV cm−2, and its Tafel slope was 72.9 mA dec−1 (Fig. 23a). It has the lowest Tafel slope among the compounds shown in Fig. 23a. After 1000 cycles, the overpotential of the MOF (Fe1–Co3)550N was changed by 2 mV, while the overpotential of RuO2 changed by 23 mV, which indicates that MOF (Fe1–Co3)550N had considerable electrocatalytic activity.145 The ORR is important for biomimetic synthesis and fuel cells. However, its high overpotential and low reaction rate have restricted its development and application.146 Efficient electrocatalysts for ORR are crucial for fuel cells.147–149 The efficiency can be improved by electrocatalysis. So it is vital to study electrocatalysis for the ORR. The electrocatalytic activities for the ORR involve two kinds of MOFs: [Cu2(OH)(bipy)2(BTC)3·2H2O]n (Cu-bipy-BTC, in which bipy refers to 2,2′-bipyridine), and Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)x (CuBTC, HKUST-1).150 Cu-bipy-BTC could be prepared via heating a mixture of 2,2′-bipyridine, H3BTC, NaOH, Cu(CH3COO)2·3H2O and water.151 The reduction peak current is increased and the oxidation peak current decreased when O2 is present with the existence of HKUST-1 (Fig. 24a) too, which means that HKUST-1 has considerable electrocatalytic activity. A pair of redox wave appeared at ca. −0.15 V, which also indicated the electrocatalytic activity of Cu-bipy-BTC (Fig. 24b).150 Miao et al. loaded Co(II)-salen in the pores of MIL-100(Cr) on a GCE to prepare an electrode, and this electrode was denoted as Cosalen@MIL-100(Cr)/GCE. MIL-100(Cr) has two kinds of pores, sized 2.9 and 2.5 nm, so the Co(II)-salen can be easily loaded in the pores. Its electrocatalytic activity is shown in Fig. 25. The redox peak of Cosalen@MIL-100(Cr)/GCE was more prominent than for the other electrodes. So it can be seen that the combination of Co(II)-salen and MIL-100(Cr) can improve the electrocatalytic activity appearently.146 Huang et al. combined N-rich graphene(NGr) and Fe3C nanoparticles and prepared Fe3C/NGr by treating a mixture of glucose, dicyandiamide, ultrapure water, ethanol and MIL-88B(Fe) with ultrasonication and with heating the mixture several times. The product was denoted as Fe3C/NGr-1. It had good electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. When the mass of MIL-88B(Fe) was halved, the product was denoted as Fe3C/NGr-0.5. Also, Fe3C/NGr-0.25 was also named after this rule. According to the report, the onset potential of Fe3C/NGr-1 was 1.07 V and the peak potential was 0.90 V, which means it showed the highest electrocatalytic activity among these composites.152

Many kinds of oxidation can be carried out by electrocatalysis to remove the pollutants in water. A kind of Cu-MOF, which was denoted as [Cu(adp)(BIB)(H2O)]n, in which BIB refers to 1,4-bisimidazolebenzene and H2adp refers to adipic acid, was reported. It was proved to have considerable electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of H2O2. A mixture of BIB, H2adp, CuSO4·5H2O and distilled water was heated to prepare this MOF. The CV curves of the electrode modified with this MOF with different concentrations of H2O2 are given in Fig. 26. As the concentration of H2O2 increases, the anodic peak increase appearently, indicating that this Cu-MOF exhibited electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of H2O2.16 Su et al. synthesized a Zr-based porphyrin MOF, which was denoted as MOF-525, via an inkjet-printed method, which could act as an electrocatalyst for the oxidation of nitrite. The “ink” was prepared by a modified method from a previous report.153,154 In order to prepare this solution, different amounts of mesotetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (H4TCPP) and ZrCl4·8H2O were mixed with DMF and the mixture was heated. Then, MOF-525 crystals were obtained, and which were named after the mass of H4TCPP, e.g. 0.9 g, 1.1 g, 1.35 g, 2.0 g and 2.7 g H4TCPP was added and M0.9, M1.1, M1.35, M2.0 and M2.7 were obtained, respectively. These were dissolved in DMF to prepare the “ink”. The “ink” was deposited on indium tin oxide coated glass (ITO) and then the electrode was obtained. The electrocatalytic activity of M1.1 for the oxidation of nitrite was studied. The current density changed between 10 and 800 mM at 0.85 V. The results show that the electrode modified with M1.1 had considerable electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of nitrite.154 Besides, the solvothermal method was also used to synthesize MOF-525 film on a glass slide,155 and its electrocatalytic activity was also tested.156
 Fig. 26  CVs of the Cu-MOF in the presence of various concentrations of H2O2. Insert shows CVs of the Cu-MOF in the presence (solid line) and absence of H2O2 (dotted line).16 
In addition, MOF electrocatalysts could also work as chemical sensors for organic compounds. Zhou et al. modified HKUST-1 with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and they were then grown on a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The composite was denoted as HKUST-1/SWCNTs/GCE. It could catalyze the oxidation of catechol (CT) and hydroquinone (HQ). Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to measure the concentration of CT and HQ. The linear relationships between the peak current and concentrate indicated that the HKUST-1/SWCNTs/GCE was suitable to work as a sensor for CT and HQ.157 Electrocatalysis can also be applied for organic synthesis. For instance, dimethyl-carbonate (DMC) has good biodegradability and a large capacity for oxygen, which makes it very attractive to many researchers.158 It was synthesized by Jia et al. via electrocatalysis in a process catalyzed by Cu(II)-2,2′-bipyridine-BTC, a kind of Cu-based MOF. It could be prepared by heating a mixture of 2,2′-bipyridine, NaOH, H3BTC, Cu(CH3COO)2·3H2O and water.151 Four sets of cycling experiments were carried, and according to the results, the yield of DMC was decreased from 73.11 μmol to 54.56 μmol, which suggests the structure of this MOF might be damaged during the reaction.159
Besides, electrocatalysis can also be applied for chemical sensors. Uric acid (UA) and dopamine (DA) have a great effect on the human body and play a role in many body systems.160 So it is necessary to study the properties of DA and UA. Carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) of MIL-101 were prepared. MIL-101 was modified to prepare a new electrode, which was denoted as MIL-CPE. Briefly, MIL-101, graphite powder and paraffin were mixed and stirred to give a paste, and then a copper bar was stuck into this paste to obtain MIL-CPE. The MIL-CPE, with a mass ratio of carbon paste and MIL-101 of 9:1, was studied with respect to CPE in the report. According to the report, in the presence of CPE, the peak potentials of UA and DA were 347 and 272 mV, respectively, so the difference between them was 75 mV, which makes it not very easy to discriminate them from each other; however, in the presence of MIL-CPE, the difference changes to 118 mV, which makes it suitable for work as a chemical sensor. This difference may due to the nodes in the framework161 and the larger pore volume of MIL-101, which leads to adequate sites for reaction.162 As a result, MIL-CPE was proved to be suitable as a chemical sensor.163 Similarly, ascorbic acid (AA) is also important to human health. Many fields require the detection of AA. In order to prepare an effective chemical sensor for AA, a tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt of [PMo10V2O40]5− (PMo10V2) was encapsulated into the pores of MIL-101(Cr) to form a composite denoted as PMo10V2@MIL-101. The TBA salt of PMo10V2 (TBA-PMo10V2) could be synthesized via heating a mixture of NaOH, NH4VO3, NaH2PO4·2H2O, Na2MoO4·2H2O and hydrochloric acid,164 and then MIL-101(Cr) was added into the solution of TBA-PMo10V2 and the mixture was stirred to obtain PMo10V2@MIL-101.165 The current density and the concentration of AA had a linear relationship, which suggested that PMo10V2@MIL-101 is suitable to be used as a chemical sensor for AA.167 Some berthollides also exhibit electrocatalytic activity. For instance, Sr1−xCexCoO3−δ (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.15) exhibited electrocatalytic activity.168 Also, bimetal–organic frameworks also have shown electrocatalytic activity, such as NiCo-UMOFNs.169
Overall, a lot of MOFs have electrocatalytic activity and can be applied for catalyzing HER, OER, ORR and water oxidation, which can help solve the energy crisis. They can also be used to catalyze the degradation or oxidation of some organic molecules, which can be applied for wastewater treatment and as chemical sensors. The electrocatalysis of MOFs thus has bright prospects for wide application.
3.4 Photoelectrocatalytic properties of MOFs
Some MOFs show higher electrocatalytic activity under light. In other words, they have photoelectrocatalytic activity. Some research has been performed on this aspect. For instance, 1D MIL-53(Fe) nanoparticles were decorated with magnetic nanospheres to form a multi-functional hybrid magnetic composite, which was denoted as MHMC. It could catalyze the water oxidation reaction. As Fig. 27a shows, it exhibits a current density at the potential between 0.3 to 0.8 V under visible light. Also, Fig. 27b shows the excellent photosensitivity of MHMC. Besides, the change of current density during the reaction was not very apparent, which indicated that MHMC had excellent stability.166 The electrocatalytic activity of MOFs can also be applied to practical work.

4. Catalytic properties of ZIFs
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are new kinds of porous material with zeolite-like topologies. The organic linker here is imidazole.170 Similar to MOFs, they can also be applied to photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Their derivatives can also be used as catalysts. They may be carbonized, modified to form catalysts or they can encapsulate other molecules.171 For example, lots of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts can be prepared from ZIF-8 and ZIF-67.172–175 Generally speaking, it is nanoclusters or nanoparticles that exhibit catalytic activity,176 so the catalytic activity can be improved via doping the compounds with nanoparticles. In addition, the separation of poles and electrons and the transformation of electrons are important for photocatalysis.177–181 There are many reports about the catalytic activities of ZIFs.
4.1 Photocatalytic properties of ZIFs
The cobalt-containing benzimidazolate ZIF (Co-ZIF-9) was prepared and used as a cocatalyst. The synthetic strategy was provided in a previous report.182 It could work with Ru-based photosensitizers to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to CO. The relationship between the mass of Co-ZIF-9 and the efficiency of photocatalysis was studied (Fig. 28a). The production of CO reached a maximum for 1 mg Co-ZIF-9 added to the reaction system. It was pointed out that the reaction efficiency was mainly influenced by the mass of Co-ZIF-9 in region I, while it was influenced by the kinetics in region II.182 The production of H2 was also related to the mass of Co-ZIF-9, indicating the influence of Co-ZIF-9 on the redox reaction. This research may give indicators to the studies on artificial photosynthesis.183 Besides, the long-lived photoexcited state of ZIF-67 was discovered, indicating the potential of ZIF-67 for photocatalysis.184

ZIFs can be used as a precursor to prepare various photocatalysts, because they have various topological structures, which makes it easier to control the structure of the photocatalysts.185,186 Cao et al. synthesized ZIF-8 on 3D graphene networks (3DGNs), where the ZIF-8 worked as a precursor to prepare ZnO/3DGN.187 It was suitable to grow ZnO on 3DGNs because it is inexpensive and efficient as a photocatalyst.188 The photocatalytic activity of ZnO/3DGN was tested (Fig. 28b). Almost all MB was decomposed in 1 h, indicating the excellent photocatalytic activity of ZnO/3DGN.187 A two-step calcination method was used by Pan et al. to synthesize porous C-doped ZnO with ZIF-8 as the precursor. It could dope carbon into ZnO more effectively than using a one-step carbonization process.189
Interestingly, provided the Zn in ZIF-8 is replaced by Ni, the framework can absorb alcohol selectively.192 ZIF-8 could be combined with diatomite to form a composite, which then had a large CO2 adsorption capability.193 When this composite is combined with photosensitizers such as TiO2, the new material obtained may have high photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2.
4.2 Electrocatalytic properties of ZIFs
Many noble metals are used as electrocatalysts, such as Ru, Pt and Ir composites.194 Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru are usually used for the reduction of CO2.104,138,195–199 But noble metal composites have a major disadvantage which is that the sources of noble metals are pretty rare and thus tend to be expensive, and this limits their development. In addition, the stability of noble composites during the reactions is low, which means that the catalysts need to be replaced frequently.133,200
Nitrogen–boron codoped graphitic carbon cages, which can encapsulate Co nanoparticles (denoted as Co@BCN), were prepared via heating a mixture of boric acid solution and ZIF-67 and calcining the products. It exhibited electrocatalytic activity for HER. The electrocatalytic activity of Co@BCN was studied. The overpotential of Co@BCN was measured to be 0.096 V when the current density was 10 mA cm−2, which is pretty low. The electrocatalytic activity was proved to be excellent.201
The derivatives of ZIFs may also be able to be applied to electrocatalysis. According to Wei et al., SO3H-functionalized graphene oxide and ZIF-8 could be combined to form ZIF-8@SO3H–GO. This had functional groups, such as CO2− and SO3−, which are Lewis acids. It exhibited electrocatalytic activity for [3 + 3] formal cycloaddition reactions. It could be removed from the reaction system via filtering, and it could be recycled for about 10 times. It is also suitable to be used as an electrocatalyst.202
Several kinds of Zn- and Co-based bimetallic ZIFs (BMZIFs) were synthesized, and they were denoted as BMZIF-n, in which n refers to the molar ratio of Zn:Co, where BMZIF-100 refers to the BMZIF without Co and BMZIF-0 refers to the BMZIF without Zn. Their electrocatalytic activities were studied with respect to P-CNCo-n, which was obtained by doping P into CNCo,203 and the CV curves are given in Fig. 28c. As is shown in Fig. 28c, P-CNCo-20 exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity among these composites. Furthermore, it was stable in a solution of methanol and KOH.190 ZIF-8 can also grow on Te nanowires and be carbonized to form a composite that has an electrocatalytic activity for ORR.204
ZIFs can also be used as precursor for the preparation of materials with electrocatalytic activity. N, Co-codoped carbon nanosheets, denoted as N, Co-CNSs were prepared via a salt melt synthesis by Hou et al. The synthetic strategy was provided in the report. Briefly, a eutectic mixture of LiCl–KCl and ZIF-67 were mixed together by ball-milling, and the mixture was carbonized at 800 °C to prepare N, Co-codoped carbon nanosheets (N, Co-CNSs-800), which showed electrocatalytic activity for ORR. The CVs are shown in Fig. 28d, which show their electrocatalytic activity.191 Armel et al. synthesized ZIF-8, and then used it as a precursor to prepare electrocatalysts.205,206 N-doped carbon nanotube frameworks (denoted as NCNTFs) were synthesized from the precursor ZIF-67. Also, NCNTF showed electrocatalytic activity for ORR as well as OER,207 and then when the coordination was released, it exhibits photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB.192
5. Catalytic properties of COFs
COFs represent a series of frameworks that are formed by light elements, such as C, B, N, O and H.208 The catalytic properties of COFs have also been studied. A series of CdS–COFs were synthesized and they were proved to be able to catalyze hydrogen production under visible light. The synthetic strategy of CdS–COFs was provided in the report. Briefly, mesitylene, acetic acid and dioxane were mixed and heated to prepare the COF. Then the COF was mixed with dimethyl sulphoxide and Cd(OAc)2 and heated. Then, the CdS–COF hybrid was obtained. CdS–COFs were named after the mass ratio of CdS:COF. The CdS–COF hybrid with 10 wt% of COF was named as CdS:COF (90:10), and had the highest hydrogen production rate among the CdS–COFs. Its hydrogen production was 3678 μmol h−1 g−1 (Fig. 29a). Also, the stability of CdS:COF (90:10) was also studied (Fig. 29b). It was proved to be very stable during the reaction.209 Besides, a kind of hydrazone-based COF (TFPT–COF) was also synthesized, which could also catalyze hydrogen production under the irradiation of visible light. TFPT–COF could be synthesized via the condensation reaction of building blocks, namely dioxane–mesitylene. Its hydrogen production was measured to be 230 μmol h−1 g−1.211 Clearly, its hydrogen production was lower than CdS:COF (90:10), which has been mentioned before. COF-366-Co was also prepared and its electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction was discovered. It could be synthesized via the condensation of 1,4-benzenedicarboxaldehyde and [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl) porphinato]cobalt. Its overpotential was −0.55 V and its faradaic efficiency reached 90%, which is considerable. It may be a good candidate for CO2 reduction.212

Two kinds of porphyrin-based COFs were reported, named 3D-Por-COF and 3D-CuPor-COF. Porphyrin and its derivatives can be excited under irradiation, whereby energy is transferred to oxygen molecules, which leads to the generation of singlet oxygen. In this study, 3D-Por-COF and 3D-Cu-Por-COF functioned as photocatalysts, and 9,10-dimethylanthracene (DMA) was used to reflect the generation of singlet oxygen. As Fig. 30 shows, 99% of the DMA is decomposed in 1.5 h in the presence of 3D-Por-COF, indicating the excellent photocatalytic activity of 3D-Por-COF.210

6. characterizations
In order to explore the relationship between the characterization and catalytic performance of the catalysts of the above type, some of the more typical catalyst characterizations described above and the relationship between the catalytic performance and characterization are summarized here.
In general, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can be used to determine the presence of an element by measuring the binding energy, whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) can determine the presence of each component in PCPs. The combination of the two measuring methods can explore the existence of each component in PCPs derivatives and their relationship, and then initially determine the photocatalytic activity.77 SEM can present the most intuitive crystal morphology of PCPs and their derivatives, which can help determine the most basic crystal morphology and degree of crystallinity, and compare whether their crystalline structures are affected following the combination of PCPs and other compounds.2,53,65 In particular, as for electrocatalysts, the Tafel slope as well as the overpotential can reflect the electrocatalytic properties.4
XRD, SEM and UV-vis spectra can be used to help determine the catalytic properties of materials. For instance, both BWO/UiO-66-1 and AgCO/UiO-66-0.5 are typical examples of combining MOF and inorganic compounds. The SEM and XRD results showed that UiO-66 still retained its original structure after combining with inorganic compounds (Fig. 31). This shows the stability of UiO-66, which is exactly what is required of it as a catalyst.2,65 The ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) of a photocatalyst causes it to show some characteristic peaks in UV-visible absorption spectra. For example, the absorption edge of MIL-88A is about 650 nm with many discrete absorption peaks.39

As mentioned earlier, Zou et al. used metal ions to replace titanium ions in the original MOF metal ions, thus obtaining a new MOF with an improved catalytic performance. The metal ions in MOF-74(Zn), MOF-74(Mg), PCN-333(Sc) and MIL-100(Sc) were replaced with Ti(III). The Ti content of the four products was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Among these, the conversion of MOF-74(Zn)-Ti was 100%, while the conversion of MOF-74(Mg)-Ti was only 35.1%. Although they have the same framework structure, the conversion rates of metal ions were quite different. According to the author's analysis, this was due to the strength of the coordination bond of the metal ion and the ionic radius. The Zn ion radius is close to that of the Ti ion, resulting in a lower lattice tension; moreover, the bond strength of Zn ions in the crystal lattice is lower than that of Mg and was therefore easier to replace. On the other hand, the conversion rate of PCN-333(Sc)-Ti was 85.9%, which was significantly higher than that of MIL-100(Sc)-Ti (52.0%), although both contained the same metal ions. This difference was mainly caused by the difference between the two connector lengths. The length of the PCN-333(Sc) connector was greater than that of MIL-100(Sc), resulting in larger voids in the crystal and greater flexibility. Therefore, the metal ions in PCN-333(Sc) could be more easily displaced.63 This provides a guideline for the preparation of PCPs by ion exchange, whereby the conversion rate can be increased by increasing the length of the linker and choosing ions with similar radius and coordinative bond strength.
As for the photocatalysts, the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 32) in Liang et al.'s study of MIL-68(In) and MIL-68(In)-NH2 shows that the light absorption range of MOFs can be adjusted by introducing amino groups into the MOFs. The introduction of amino groups can move the absorption edge to the visible light range. It can be seen that the introduction of auxochromes such as amino groups into the linker can increase the utilization of visible light for PCPs.47

7. Conclusions
The search for renewable energy and clean energy to replace the current fossil energy will be an increasingly important issue for human society in the future. The use of alternatives to fossil fuels can not only reduce environmental pollution but also ease the energy crisis. In terms of electrocatalysis, when PCPs act as an electrocatalyst, they can catalyze the HER, OER, ORR and the oxidation of some compounds and the reduction of heavy metal ions. Qualified electrocatalysts should have the following characteristics: (1) stable at higher potentials, (2) high conductivity to transfer charge,4 and (3) reasonably priced. In the case of PCPs, the majority of PCPs are electrically conductive and therefore can increase the conductivity of PCPs by combining the PCPs with other compounds, such as some ionic compounds, or by carbonizing MOFs, while retaining the catalytic ability of PCPs. For photocatalysis, the catalyst should not only have high catalytic activity and stability, but also a certain light trapping ability and charge-transfer ability. Except for some PCPs that can be directly used as photocatalysts, many of the remaining PCPs must be carbonized or combined with other compounds. In a heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction, the photocatalyst can be recovered, which allows the photocatalyst to be reused, and avoids the pollution of the product and the environment by substances in the photocatalyst.5 As a photocatalyst, PCPs are often used to treat organic pollutants, heavy metal pollutants or to react in some reactions, such as HER, OER and ORR, and are of great significance to attempts to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Some of the photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are listed here for readers to compare their catalytic properties easily (Tables 1 and 2).

Many studies may open new doors for photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. For instance, Chaudhari et al. reported some examples of porous 2D nanoplatelets made of 3D MOF structures and developed the supramolecular self-assembly method in order to synthesize MOF nanosheets under ambient conditions using a host–guest strategy for their in situ functionalization. The MOF nanosheets obtained by this method have considerable photosensitivity, and may be used as chemical sensors. The nanosheets can be combined with catalysts, and the nanosheets could be excited by light to release electrons in the composite. Then the composite can exhibit good photocatalytic activity.213
However, there are also many challenges for MOFs, ZIFs and COFs in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. For instance, the mechanisms of many catalytic reactions haven't been clarified yet, such as water splitting catalysed by MOFs.1 and the conductivity and photosensitivity of PCPs should be improved in order to improve the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities. Photocatalysis may be applied for organic synthesis, but the efficiency needs to be improved.121 As mentioned before, combining MOFs with other photosensitizers, dyes or catalysts may be a good idea to improve the efficiency. Besides, ligand functionalization and quantum doping can also help. More research should be done. Besides, as for COFs, according to a previous report, it is now well equipped to prepare small COF crystals that are suitable for single crystal electron diffraction, but it is difficult to prepare large COF crystals, which would be very useful for exploring the properties of COF, so more research is needed.214 However, despite so many challenges, PCPs are good candidates for catalysis and the outlook is bright in this field. All in all, more research should be done to optimize the catalytic performances of PCPs.
