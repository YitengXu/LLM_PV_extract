    , Accepted 24th May 2013First published on 28th May 2013AbstractAnodized nanoporous Nb2O5 films are synthesized using two different types of electrolyte compositions onto transparent conductive glasses and their impurities induced during the anodization process are assessed. These films are incorporated as photoanodes in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The one with no traces of impurity-driven defects exhibits higher current density and longer electron lifetimes, and consequently, an improvement in photoconversion efficiencies compared to the one that contains impurities.
Anodization is now one of the most widespread nano-fabrication methods due to its capability of producing highly porous and ordered oxide morphologies. Usually, fluorine (F) and phosphorus (P) based electrolytes are utilized in anodization processes to produce thick organized nanostructures.1–4 The obtained anodized oxides offer many advantages such as self-organized formation, large surface area, controllable pores and film thickness, as well as ordered electron transport pathways. These properties promote the anodized oxides as potential candidates in various applications including sensing, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, photocatalysts, and electrochromic windows.5
Unfortunately, the induction of embedded ionic impurities during the anodization process negates many of the aforementioned advantages of the anodized oxides.2,6–8 These impurities increase the exciton-like trap states, which obstruct the unhindered transfer of free charge carriers and increase the electron scattering effect within the oxide structure.9 Unfortunately, this results in serious efficiency limitations for anodized oxides incorporated into various devices. By minimizing the induced defect states during the anodization process, the quality of the anodized oxide can be enhanced for many applications ranging from sensing to photoconversion.9
Previously, we have successfully fabricated the anodized Nb2O5 on foil with no observable impurity effects by optimizing electrolyte and anodization conditions in a F containing electrolyte.3,10 However, the growth of the nanoporous Nb2O5 on the foil limits the application of its films in many optical systems, thus it is essential to realize transparent configurations of such films. Here, we report the synthesis of anodized nanoporous Nb2O5 on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) using a similar electrolyte composition (ethylene glycol [C2H6O2] + ammonium fluoride [NH4F] – denoted as Nb2O5-EGAF in this communication). Since the report by Lee et al. shows a promising technique to grow thick organized Nb2O5 nanostructure, the K containing electrolyte based on glycerol (glycerol [C3H8O3] + potassium phosphate dibasic [K2HPO4] – denoted as Nb2O5-GLPP in this communication) is also selected in our study.2 To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the formation of anodized Nb2O5 on transparent conductive oxide substrates (FTO in this report).
The initial material used for fabricating the anodized Nb2O5 is the niobium metal, which is deposited onto FTO glass pieces using an RF sputtering system (the details of the sputtering process are presented in the ESI†). The electrolyte used for forming Nb2O5-EGAF is a combination of 0.25 g NH4F (98% purity, Sigma Aldrich) and 4 vol% deionized water in 50 ml ethylene glycol (98% purity, Sigma Aldrich). The electrolyte is kept at an optimum temperature of 50 °C during each experiment.3 For forming Nb2O5-GLPP, the suggested experimental conditions for the electrolyte based on glycerol are 10 wt% K2HPO4 (98% purity, Sigma Aldrich) in 50 ml glycerol (99% purity, Sigma Aldrich) at an optimum temperature of 180 °C.2 The details of the anodization process are presented in the ESI.†
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface and the cross-section of the as-sputtered niobium layer can be viewed in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. From these observations, it can be clearly seen that the sputtered niobium layer consists of compressed, vertically-aligned nanorods. The top of the nanorods has arrow-head shaped platelets with widths ranging from 50 to 120 nm. In this study, the initial thickness of the niobium metal is chosen to be ∼2.4 μm, as thicker layers cannot be fully and homogenously anodized.

Normally, the conventional anodization methods require high voltages (on the order of 60 V) in order to enhance field assisted growth of anodic oxides.11 Nevertheless, in this study we are able to produce thick layers of anodized Nb2O5 on FTO at voltages on the order of 10 to 20 V. To fabricate the Nb2O5-EGAF, the as-sputtered niobium films are anodized at three different voltages of 10, 15 and 20 V for 1 hour. Three different film thicknesses of ∼3.5, ∼5.0 and ∼6.8 μm are obtained, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). It is observed that the pore openings on the surface of the Nb2O5-EGAF become wider at higher voltages, while the widths of the walls of the remaining oxide decrease. SEM images in Fig. 1c represent the surface morphology of the Nb2O5-EGAF after 1 hour anodization at 15 V and annealing at 430 °C. From the cross-sectional view of the SEM image (Fig. 1d), it is found that the layer contains nanorod-like structures that consist of a porous chain-like network distribution. An applied voltage of 15 V is the best condition for forming the Nb2O5-EGAF, since its morphology is still maintained and it is fully crystalline after annealing at 430 °C. Note that when the Nb2O5-EGAF (∼6.8 μm) is anodized at 20 V, it appears to be slightly cracked after annealing and only partially crystallized when a lower temperature is applied.
The fabrication of the Nb2O5-GLPP is also performed at three different voltages: 10, 15 and 20 V. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), Nb2O5-GLPP films of three different thicknesses (∼3.5, ∼5.0 and ∼6.6 μm) and surface pore sizes are produced when 10, 15 and 20 V are applied during anodization. Since a high temperature is used in this process, the anodization duration of the Nb2O5-GLPP is short and takes only 3 to 9 minutes, depending on the voltage applied. The SEM images in Fig. 1e show the surface morphology of the Nb2O5-GLPP anodized at 15 V after annealing at 500 °C, while Fig. 1f presents the cross-sectional view. It is observed that the surface of the Nb2O5-GLPP consists of a well-established pore distribution, with outer walls of less than 10 nm. Furthermore, we also identify the presence of a secondary porous layer underneath the initial layer of the Nb2O5-GLPP. The pore diameter of the secondary layer ranges from 20 to 40 nm. The cross-sectional part of the Nb2O5-GLPP forms compact nanochannels with diameters of 20 to 40 nm, which are similar to the pore dimensions of the secondary layer. In comparison, it is observed that the surface area of the Nb2O5-GLPP (Fig. 1e) layer is larger, which is approximately 3× higher than that of Nb2O5-EGAF (Fig. 1c) (detailed measurement is provided in the ESI†).
The crystal phases of both Nb2O5-EGAF and Nb2O5-GLPP are determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Details of the crystal structure characterization methods are presented in the ESI.† XRD patterns (Fig. S3, ESI†) show that both the annealed Nb2O5-EGAF and Nb2O5-GLPP have dominant orthorhombic phases. However, there are no obvious peaks indicating structural impurities in these patterns. As a result, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is employed to trace the impurities in both samples. Measurements are performed at five different levels on each anodized Nb2O5 sample with an etching time of 20 seconds at a power of 2 keV. From XPS analysis (Fig. 2a), the spectra of annealed Nb2O5-EGAF and Nb2O5-GLPP confirm the presence of elemental niobium and oxygen. The F1s scans (Fig. 2b) indicate that the Nb2O5-EGAF contains no fluorine impurity. For the Nb2O5-GLPP, lower peaks of potassium (∼2.7%) and phosphorus (∼1.8%) are detected in the spectra.2 The spectra of K2p scans (Fig. 2c) show that the intensity of the peaks of potassium at 293.8 eV (2p3) and 296.5 eV (2p1) is still observable until the 4th etch level of the Nb2O5-GLPP. Meanwhile, the peaks of phosphorus (134.3 eV) in the P2p scans (Fig. 2d) are only obvious until the 3rd etch level, and become weaker when the 4th level is reached. These results indicate that small amounts of potassium and phosphorus ions in the glycerol based electrolyte are embedded into the structure of Nb2O5-GLPP, which can potentially contribute to the formation of defect states. However, the annealed Nb2O5-EGAF seems to be void of any detectable impurities.

Since Nb2O5-EGAF and Nb2O5-GLPP films offer thick and unique highly ordered architectures, they are beneficial for potential use in photo-conversion as well as many other applications. To evaluate the photo-conversion characteristics of anodized nanoporous Nb2O5, several tests are conducted by assembling the material as photoanodes in DSSCs. Samples of ∼5.0 μm thickness are used.
In order to determine the anodized Nb2O5 dye loading, its UV-Vis absorption spectra are obtained. According to Fig. S4 (ESI†), the calculated dye loadings for the Nb2O5-EGAF and Nb2O5-GLPP photoanodes are 63.6 and 74.8 nmol cm−2 at 534 nm, respectively. The details of the dye loading measurements are presented in the ESI.†
The fabrication details of the DSSCs are presented in the ESI.† The photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the Nb2O5-EGAF and Nb2O5-GLPP DSSCs under AM 1.5 irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3a. The DSSC parameters for both devices, including short-circuit current density Jsc (mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage Voc (V), fill factor (FF) and photoconversion efficiency η, are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC exhibits 3.45% efficiency (η). The efficiency (η) of the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC is 57% higher than that of the Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC, despite its smaller surface area and lower dye loading. Additionally, the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC exhibits a 34% higher FF value than that of the Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC.

Open-circuit photovoltage decay measurements are conducted in order to study the electron lifetime, τn, and the recombination effect in DSSCs. Fig. 3b and c shows the plots of open-circuit photovoltage decay of the Nb2O5 DSSCs as a function of elapsed time and the estimated electron lifetime. From the graphs, it is observed that the photovoltage decay of the Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC has an obvious ‘kink’, i.e. a decay velocity that is much faster than that of the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC. At voltages above 0.45 V, the electron lifetime (τn) of the Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC is slightly higher than that of the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC. However, the τn of the Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC suddenly decreases to nearly an order lower in magnitude than that of the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC, when the voltage is less than 0.45 V. This condition possibly indicates that the electrons in the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC demonstrate overall longer lifetimes in comparison to those of the Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC, despite its lower Voc, thus potentially reflecting better charge recombination kinetics.
The origin of this interesting observation can be possibly ascribed to the influence of impurities in the photoanode. As discussed previously, XPS results have revealed that the Nb2O5-GLPP photoanode has significant amounts of embedded potassium and phosphate impurities. This factor increases the number of trap states in the Nb2O5-GLPP photoanode, causing longer residence times.12 As a result, the free electron concentration is reduced, leading to the interruption of electron transfer and the shortening of the electron lifetime, therefore lowering the photoconversion efficiency.3,9,13 Furthermore, it is possible that the presence of these impurities on the surface increases the possibility of electron trapping within the interface between the photoanode and the I−/I3− electrolyte, thus promoting the electron to recombine with the I3− ions in the electrolyte.9,12,14
Additionally, we also investigated the electron recombination kinetics of the DSSCs using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). From the obtained results, it is observed that the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC has a higher charge-transfer resistance (Fig. 3d) and a lower frequency peak position (Fig. S5, ESI†), in comparison to the Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC, indicating lower electron recombination with the I3− ions and longer electron lifetimes in the Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC, which is in agreement with the decay curves (further discussion is presented in the ESI†).
In summary, nanoporous Nb2O5 films on FTO are successfully fabricated using an anodization process. When a suitable electrolyte containing fluorine is used, thick anodized nanoporous Nb2O5 with high surface area can be produced, and the impurity defects in the anodized films can be significantly reduced, below detectable levels using XPS. The measurements indicate that the photoconversion efficiency of Nb2O5-EGAF DSSC is much better than that of Nb2O5-GLPP DSSC with the same photoanode thickness. This study also reveals that the existence of defect states in photoanodes is possibly one of the key factors that affects the degradation electron lifetime in DSSCs and as a result, the overall DSSC efficiency. Nb2O5-EGAF photoanodes with no detectable fluoride impurities exhibit longer electron lifetimes in comparison to Nb2O5-GLPP photoanodes, indicating better charge recombination. These results signify the importance of the electrolyte choice and composition in the anodization process of nanoporous Nb2O5. These findings also show that these transparent anodized nanoporous Nb2O5 films can potentially provide a novel platform for applications, where low scattering and minimum impurity pathways for charge transport are essential.
