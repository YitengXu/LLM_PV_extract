    , Accepted 27th January 2018First published on 29th January 2018AbstractHerein, solvent-treated bandgap-tunable covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) were prepared via the Stille cross-coupling reaction. These materials are considered useful as interlayers in photovoltaic devices upon the alignment of energy levels between other components. Among various types of solar cells, according to the organic-interlayer study, inverted planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are mostly demanded to effectively transport and collect charge carriers due to their high performance. At first, the C-V analysis proved the energy levels of the frontier orbitals for CON-10 and CON-16 nanosheets; this verified the suitability of these nanosheets as hole transport layers (HTLs) with the PEDOT:PSS upon casting both films from DMSO. It became evident, however, that the hole transport property of the PEDOT:PSS on the CON-16 layer was unfavorable with the increasing UPS-proven hole injection barrier. In addition, both CONs induced a rough surface morphology; however, CON-10 showed a relatively smooth surface as compared to CON-16 based on the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) profiles; furthermore, their surface properties influenced both the PEDOT:PSS layers and the perovskite layers. Especially, the XRD profiles presented an enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite layers with CON-10. All these aspects indicate that CON-10 is a more effective HTL material, and several versions of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been fabricated with/without CON-10 and CON-16 together with the PEDOT:PSS to determine the more-HTL-suitable CON. As a result, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the optimized devices with CON-10 exhibited a value of 10.2%, which represented a 1% increase over those of the reference devices without the CONs and was 4% higher than that of the CON-16 devices. Moreover, the devices with CON-10 were further optimized with TiOx using Al electrodes, leading to a PCE increase of these devices that became slightly higher than the PCEs of the device with CON-10 and without TiOx. This tendency was supported by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, photocurrent density (Jph), and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobility results.
Introduction
Throughout the last decade, naturally occurring two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as clay minerals and graphites, have been widely utilized in both academia and industry since they can be utilized for applications such as in purification,1 energy storage,2,3 catalysis,4 and electronics.5 Therefore, in the field of materials science, the design and synthesis of 2D materials have gained significant interest and importance from researchers; as a result, many ceramic and/or inorganic 2D materials, such as synthetic clays and graphene, have been designed and synthesised.6,7 Although the particle size and shape of these inorganic materials can be controlled with the state-of-the-art techniques, it is still difficult to control their structural diversity.8,9
Therefore, significant research efforts have been made towards the development of new types of low-density 2D network-structure polymers.10 As a result, covalent organic frameworks (COFs)11 and covalent thiazine frameworks (CTFs)12 have been investigated as these are composed of highly crystalline, ordered, and unique porous sheet structures depending on the intermonomer connecting fashion in the network polymers.13,14 Furthermore, appropriate π-conjugated monomers can delocalize the electrons through 2D-network frameworks, resulting in excellent light-harvesting and semiconducting properties.15 The COFs and CTFs, however, exhibit a strong tendency to form π–π stacked self-assemblies that degrade their dispersion properties in various solvents; thus, thin-film fabrication via solution processes, such as spin coating, drop casting, and dip coating, gets hampered.
Therefore, covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) exfoliated from COFs, such as graphene, have gained attention due to their colloidal stability in various solvents.16–20 Previously, the authors have reported facile synthetic routes for delaminated CONs with a relatively reduced tendency towards π–π stacked self-assemblies like COFs; as a result, solvent-treatment variation of the delaminated-CON morphologies in their film states has been observed. Furthermore, the materials showed an excellent visible-light harvesting property in the 2D directions due to the elongated π-electron networks, and their bandgaps were tunable upon morphological change that was induced by treatments with different solvents.21 Thus, it was expected that the materials could be applicable for a number of optoelectronic devices via energy-level alignment between various organic/inorganic components.
Functioning optoelectronic devices, such as photovoltaic devices, have been fabricated by casting essential components in a layer-by-layer manner on conducting substrates, and this efficiently generates and transports photoinduced charge carriers.22 Among several types of photovoltaic devices, organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs)23 generally require organic components to improve the device performance. PSCs that are based on organometal halides, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), have been investigated very intensively due to their unique properties such as long diffusion length of the excitons,23–26 low exciton-binding energy,27 low-cost fabrication,28 high absorption coefficient,29 and broad light absorption that can be tuned by controlling the chemical compositions.30 The PSCs, however, typically show lack of structural diversity regarding the photoactive layers; thus, for the study of the PSC interlayers, it is more important to enhance the device performances than the OPVs with the utilization of various photoactive-layer structures.29,30 Therefore, with respect to the interlayer usage, two types of PSC have been widely developed. First, the titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL) that is generally applied to normal PSCs. Currently, highest device efficiencies (more than 20%) have been reported with these normal-PSC types, thereby improving the quality of the perovskite layers and/or modifying the interlayer structures.31–34 A number of issues of the normal-type devices, however, are related to the requisite high processing temperatures (approximately 500 °C) for the development of the crystallized TiO2 ETLs,35 and there is also an hysteresis issue, depending on the direction of the voltage sweep that hinders the utilization of the crystallized TiO2 ETLs towards flexible devices with plastic substrates and tandem devices with other inorganic solar cells.
Alternatively, inverted planar-type devices have been developed for the fabrication of flexible electronics with organic HTLs and ETLs such as poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and fullerene derivatives such as 6,6-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM), respectively.34 However, the crystallinity of the photoactive layers should be controlled at relatively low treatment temperatures (approximately 100 °C) in inverted PSCs due to the combustible characteristic of flexible substrates and other organic components.36 Thus, regarding the planar PSCs, the crystallinity of the perovskite layers will be premature as compared to that of the normal PSCs that are fabricated at high temperatures on certain ceramic or silicon substrates, and this means that the development and application of the interlayers will become further important to increase the efficiency of the inverted planar-type PSCs.37 The current strategy to increase the HTL properties of the PEDOT:PSS, however, has been limited to increasing the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS without changing its chemical structure.38 Therefore, new types of HTL materials should be introduced together with the PEDOT:PSS, and the previously mentioned CONs would be applicable as effective HTLs for planar PSCs due to their bandgap tunability.
In this study, an attempt has been made to utilize these CONs as HTLs together with the PEDOT:PSS in the inverted-type PSCs for the purpose of establishing the electronic parameters and/or device architectures that are mostly influenced. Especially, the focus of the present study was on gauging the properties of two versions of the network polymer, CON-10 and CON-16, as shown in Scheme 1. The method for the preparation of targeted polymers with identical physical characteristics (i.e., structural units, except for different synthetic conditions and morphologies in their solid states) is reported in the literature.21 Notably, since CON-16 was prepared by a solvothermal reaction without stirring, the Pd(0) catalyst for polymerization could only diffuse by the convection flow of the solution. Therefore, the unique dendronic morphologies of CON-16, as shown in the TEM image of Scheme 1a, resulted from the Stille cross-coupling reaction under solvothermal conditions. However, since CON-10 was polymerized by conventional refluxing under stirring, the (Pd(0)) catalyst was homogeneouly difused in the solution such that the Stille reaction could occur equivalently in the 2-dimensional direction. Hence, we believe that CON-10 has paper-like morphologies, as shown in the TEM image in Scheme 1a. Especially, it was confirmed by analysis of the TEM images in Fig. S2 (see the ESI†) that the primary particles of CON-10 consisted of 4–7 layers of CON-10 sheets like graphene. The influence of CON on the functioning devices was investigated by fabricating a series of PSCs that were prepared by spin coating CONs dispersed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on substrates consisting of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO), and subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the glass/ITO/CON substrates. MAPbI3-perovskite layers were then grown on the glass/ITO/CON/PEDOT:PSS substrates. Furthermore, both the PC70BM and TiOx layers were respectively fabricated on top of the perovskites to improve the electron-transfer stability of the solar-cell devices.37–41 Finally, the fabrication was completed by thermal evaporation of the aluminum (Al) electrodes, as represented in Scheme 1.

Experimental
Preparation of the chemicals
For the perovskite layer, the MAPbI3 solution was composed of methylammonium lead trihalide (CH3NH3I) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2) in a ratio of 1.06:1 mol%, and it was mixed in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and DMSO (7:3 v/v%) with a molar concentration of 1.4 mol L−1 at 100 °C for 4 h. The Clevios P VP AI 4083 type of PEDOT:PSS was purchased from Heraeus (Germany). The PC70BM solution was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) in a concentration of 20 mg mL−1.
Preparation of the CON solutions
Both CON-10 and CON-16 suspensions were prepared by dissolving 4 mg of each CON in 1 mL of DMSO with ultrasonication for 30 min.
Fabrication of the perovskite-solar-cell devices
The inverted perovskite photovoltaic devices were fabricated on a structure consisting of ITO/(CON)/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PC70BM/(TiOx)/Al. To fabricate the inverted PSC devices, patterned ITO glasses were washed via 20 min sonication in deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol. After cleaning, the ITO glasses were dried at 100 °C and then treated with ultraviolet (UV) ozone for 15 min. The CON solutions were spin-coated onto ITO glasses at 2000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. Prior to the PEDOT:PSS coating onto the CON films, the CON films were treated with UV ozone for 5 min. The PEDOT:PSS was then spin-coated onto the ITO substrates or the CON films at 5000 rpm for 40 s. The PEDOT:PSS films were annealed on a hot plate at 140 °C for 10 min to generate a thin film with a thickness of 30 nm. The MAPbI3 solution was first spin-coated on a PEDOT:PSS film at 1000 rpm for 30 s and then again at 5000 rpm for 30 s with an additional process of CB drop-casting. Then, the substrates were placed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 5 min to fabricate the MAPbI3 film with a thickness of 300 nm. A PC70BM layer with a thickness of ∼30 nm was formed on the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s. A TiOx interlayer with a thickness of ∼10 nm was subsequently added on the active layer at 5000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, an Al cathode was thermally deposited under 4.0 × 10−6 Torr with a thickness of ∼100 nm using a thermal evaporator. All the devices were encapsulated using a UV-curable resin and a cover glass.
Film characterization
The surface morphologies and roughness of the hole transport and perovskite layers were characterized using the Park NX10 AFM device (Park Systems, South Korea) in the noncontact mode and the SIGMA SEM (Carl Zeiss, Inc., USA) instrument at 5 kV, respectively. In addition, the Bruker-AXS XRD device (Bruker, South Korea) was used to investigate the crystallinity of the perovskite thin films.
Device measurement
The J–V characteristics of the fabricated inverted OPVs were assessed using the ZIVE SP1 instrument (ZIVE LAB, South Korea) under an AM 1.5-G solar simulator (light and dark conditions). The SCLC and Jph values were measured under the AM 1.5-G solar simulator and the dark condition, respectively. The total cell area of the fabricated inverted PSCs was 0.15 cm2. The IPCE values were measured to prove the short-circuit current of the Jsc. The PL spectra were obtained using the XPERAM 200 Raman microscope (Nanobase, Inc., South Korea). The laser wavelength and the power for each device were 642 nm and 0.3 mW, respectively.
Results and discussion
Film fabrication of CONs and their energy-level alignments
Although the morphologies of the CONs that were used in this study could be varied depending on the solvents that were used for drop casting on the substrates, actual self-assembled morphologies of CON-10 and CON-16 that were spin-coated on ITO glasses from each DMSO suspension were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Each morphology exhibited a self-assembly tendency that was similar to that reported in a previous study21 despite different film-casting methods, and fibrous morphologies for CON-10, as shown in Fig. 1(a), and aggregated globular-flake morphologies for CON-16, as shown in Fig. 1(b), were observed. It can be suggested, however, that CON-10 can supply a more effective HTL than CON-16 because the film coverage of CON-10 upon spin-coating is superior to that of CON-16.

To determine and align the relative frontier-orbital energy levels of the CONs relative to those of the other device components, cyclovoltammetry (C-V) measurements of the ITO/CON and ITO/PEDOT:PSS films were carried out with respect to a silver (Ag)/silver chloride (AgCl) reference electrode in degassed anhydrous DMSO (ESI, Fig. S3†). The energy levels of all the device materials are summarized in Fig. 2. The band alignment between the CONs and the PEDOT:PSS gives rise to the expectation that both CONs can effectively transfer photoinduced holes to the ITO electrodes with blocking of the electron transfer.

Therefore, to obtain a rationale for the charge-transport behaviors of each CON together with the PEDOT:PSS on the ITO electrodes, an investigation of the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) was conducted, as shown in Fig. 3. The edges of the high-energy cut-off region of the ITO/CON-10/PEDOT:PSS and the ITO/CON-16/PEDOT:PSS, which can be seen in Fig. 3(a), are slightly shifted towards a higher binding energy relative to those of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS, and this means that each CON can slightly lower the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PEDOT:PSS in terms of the vacuum level. The differences between the cut-off regions, however, are insignificant such that the PEDOT:PSS electron-blocking properties would be almost identical. In contrast, the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the PEDOT:PSS for the ITO/CON-16/PEDOT:PSS films was shifted towards a higher binding-energy region, showing an approximate difference of 1 eV relative to the HOMO of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS films, whereas the HOMO of the PEDOT:PSS on the ITO/CON-10 is almost identical to that of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS, as shown in Fig. 3(b). In general, the hole injection barriers in the optoelectronic devices have been subjected to the energy differences between a zero binding energy and the onset of the HOMO states, as indicated by the dashed lines that are perpendicular to the x-axis in Fig. 3(b).42 Therefore, it can be expected that the CON-16 hole injection would be hindered relative to that of the PEDOT:PSS because the HOMO of the PEDOT:PSS in the ITO/CON-16/PEDOT:PSS is further shifted to a higher binding-energy region. Furthermore, considering the PEDOT:PSS layer thickness of 35–40 nm and the penetration depth of helium light, which is approximately 3 nm,43 the corresponding HOMO states in all the UPS spectra with respect to the zero binding energy can be associated with the HOMO states of the top surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer in all the films. Therefore, it can be suggested that CON-16 can induce adverse defect sites on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, whereas the surface physicochemical properties of the PEDOT:PSS with CON-10 are identical to those atop the PEDOT:PSS without a CON.

Induced morphologies of each layer and the perovskite-layer crystallinity by the CONs
To obtain an insight into the surface properties of each of the layers above the CON layers that had been spin-coated onto the ITO glasses, the surface morphologies were analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). All the images within the surface area of 5 μm × 5 μm were obtained, as shown in Fig. 4. The topographic morphologies of CON-10 and CON-16 on the ITO are similar to those in the SEM data of the CONs that show the flake-like particles of CON-10 with a high aspect ratio, as presented in Fig. 4(a), and the globular particles of CON-16, as presented in Fig. 4(b). Moreover, CON-16 represents a more uneven surface than CON-10 upon comparison of the root mean square (RMS) roughness values of 6.39 nm and 15.7 nm, respectively. Then, it can be carefully speculated from the CON topographies that the previously mentioned features can be ascribed to a larger average particle size and a more severe aggregation of CON-16 as compared to those of CON-10. Then, the surface morphologies of the PEDOT:PSS that had been spin-coated on each CON film were investigated using the AFM topping mode to gauge the CON influence on the surface morphologies of these additional organic layers. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the RMS value of the PEDOT:PSS surface on the CON-10 is 1.03 nm, whereas that of the PEDOT:PSS surface on the CON-16 is 1.23 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Therefore, despite the small difference between the RMS-roughness values, it was clearly demonstrated that the surface roughness of the PEDOT:PSS coating on top of the CONs was governed by the surface properties of the underlying CON layer. Additionally, depsite the lack of insight into the interfacial interaction between the CONs and the PEDOT:PSS, it could be suggested herein that the previously mentioned UPS profile of the PEDOT:PSS on the CON-16 was associated with the PEDOT:PSS surface roughness on the CON-16.

The MAPbI3 layers were developed continuously on the PEDOT:PSS layers with different treatments of the CONs on the ITO substrates, and the top morphologies of the resultant films were examined in the same AFM mode, as shown in the Fig. 4(e) and (f). Unlike the PEDOT:PSS layers, the surface roughness of the MAPbI3-perovskite layers was not determined by the PEDOT:PSS surface characteristics on the CONs, and they showed an even rougher MAPbI3 surface that was developed on the ITO/CON-10/PEDOT:PSS as comparedto the other layers. Furthermore, as presented in Fig. 1, it can be expected that CON-10 with the fibrous morphologies and better coverage can exhibit a more effective HTL than CON-16 with aggregated globular-flake morphologies. Since the hole transport layers with a higher film coverage ratio and higher roughness will lead to an enhanced contact area, the film coverage of CON-10 will lead to enhanced contact area between the perovskite and CON-10/PEDOT:PSS and will render more efficient charge transfer.44 Hence, the enhanced contact area between CON-10 and PEDOT:PSS can lead to increased RMS of the perovskite on CON-10/PEDOT:PSS, which is related to the crystallite size of the perovskite domains. It was, however, implied herein that the MAPbI3 crystallinity could have been affected by different CON treatments.
Therefore, to obtain crystallinity insights for the perovskites upon the treatment of the CONs, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were examined, as depicted in Fig. 5(a), for which the MAPbI3 XRD pattern of the PEDOT:PSS without the CONs on the ITO was compared. All the XRD profiles showed the characteristic diffraction peaks of the typical perovskite phase,37 but the intensities of the (110) diffraction peaks at around 14° of 2θ for all the films are clearly different when all the perovskite layers are thermally annealed at 100 °C for 5 min as a typical procedure to increase the crystallinity of the planar PCSs. At first, it was confirmed that the intensity of the (110) diffraction peak for the ITO/CON-16/PEODT:PSS/MAPbI3, denoted by the black line in Fig. 5(a), was clearly reduced as compared to that of the ITO/PEODT:PSS/MAPbI3 that served as a reference film and is denoted by the red line in Fig. 5(a); however, that of the ITO/CON-10/PEODT:PSS/MAPbI3, denoted by the blue line in Fig. 5(a), was stronger than the peak of the reference film. Hence, the crystallite sizes were calculated using the Scherrer equation with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) diffraction peaks for the three cases that are provided in Fig. 5(b). As a result, the calculated crystalite size of the perovskite domains was enhanced when the perovskite grew on the PEDOT:PSS surface with CON-10 on the ITO glass, whereas the PEDOT:PSS surface with CON-16 on the ITO showed an adverse effect on the crystallite size of the perovskite domains relative to that of the perovskite on the PEDOT:PSS without a CON. Therefore, it is noteworthy that the CON-10 treatment induces a more effective MAPbI3 crystallinity and a rougher surface morphology, as is depicted in the results of the previously mentioned AFM study.

(b) Calculated crystallite size (blue bars) obtained by the Scherrer equation and the full width at half maximum (FWHM), denoted by the red bars, from each corresponding XRD pattern. 
At this stage, although a MAPbI3 growth mechanism regarding the PEDOT:PSS surface with/without the CONs is not elucidated, it is now carefully suggested that an optimal surface roughness of the polymeric matrix that influences the crystallinity of the inorganic thin layer on the organic surface at an earlier stage of the growth mechanism, and/or that of the CON-10/PEDOT:PSS bilayer, can better transfer the thermal energy up to the MAPbI3 top layer as compared to the case of both the PEDOT:PSS-only layer and the CON-16/PEDOT:PSS bilayer.
Device fabrication and characteristics
The efficacy of the CONs regarding the device performances was further evaluated in the perovskite devices. Fig. 6(a) presents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the devices based on the PEDOT:PSS-only layer and the CON/PEDOT:PSS bilayer, and all the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The devices with the PEDOT:PSS-only layer exhibited an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.38% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.82 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.96 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 62%. The incorporation of an ultrathin CON-10 interlayer (∼30 nm) led to an encouraging simultaneous enhancement in all the solar-cell parameters with the exception of a VOC of 0.95 V, a JSC of 16.33 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65%, thereby yielding a promising PCE of 10.17%. The solar-cell performance, however, was decreased by the use of the CON-16 interlayer, and this might be attributed to the surface roughness of the PEDOT:PSS layer and/or the hindrance of the hole injection. In brief, the insertion of the CON-10 between the ITO and the PEDOT:PSS resulted in a significant PCE improvement of 8.4% as compared to that of the PEDOT:PSS only-based device. Furthermore, we confirmed the standard deviation of cell data from several devices for every condition. As shown in Table S1 and Fig. S4,† the data present the average value and error bars of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE, respectively. Therefore, it can be suggested herein that the incorporation of the CON-10 layer exhibits stable device parameters. Interestingly, when applied in conjunction with the CON-10, the TiOx ETL exhibited more favorable effects in the device as compared to the devices with the CON-10 but without TiOx, leading to an improved FF of 72% and a PCE of 10.7%, as shown in Table S2 and Fig. S5,† respectively.

The major contribution to the PCE enhancement can be attributed to the increased JSC and FF in the case of the CON-10/PEDOT:PSS-bilayer-based device; the corresponding device improvement provides a sound hole transport ability and the excellent electron-blocking properties of CON-10.45 It was expected that the CON-10 layer would be able to effectively prevent the leakage of electrons through the ITO and increase the charge generation, thereby significantly affecting the JSC of the devices. A measurement of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra was carried out for the PSCs with and without the CONs to confirm the improved JSC, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The values that were integrated from the IPCE characteristics of the devices well matched with the JSC values with an error of less than 4%. Especially, all the IPCE profiles showed two broad peaks at around 500 and 700 nm, and these two peaks were maximized in the devices that were based on the CON-10/PEDOT:PSS bilayer, revealing peaks that were approximately 10% higher than those of the other two devices.
Relation between the morphology of the BHJ film and the charge-carrier dynamics
The photoluminescence (PL) properties of the perovskite layers have been analyzed to compare the effect of the CON interlayers that are associated with the efficient charge separation or injection from the photoactive material to the charge-extraction layers, as shown in Fig. 7. For this study, the films were fabricated with the composition of ITO/(CONs)/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 and excited at approximately 770 nm. As a result, the perovskite layer deposited on CON-10/PEDOT:PSS exhibits lower PL intensity. On the contrary, the perovskite layers with CON-16/PEDOT:PSS show a higher PL intensity. A lower relative PL intensity or higher PL quenching is generally related to efficient charge separation or injection from the photoactive layer to the charge-extraction layer. Surprisingly, the existence of the very thin CON-10 film at the PEDOT:PSS interface significantly enhances the PL quenching; this is strongly associated with the significantly increased fill factor of the perovskite solar cells with the CON-10/PEDOT:PSS bilayer.46 Consequently, it could be worthwhile to highlight that the CON-10 layer was subjected to a more efficient dissociation of the excitons into the free charge carriers as compared to the PEDOT:PSS-only and CON-16 layers; this led to an improved charge-generation efficiency.47
 Fig. 7  Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) on top of the poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), shown in black; the CON-10/PEDOT:PSS (red); and the CON-16/PEDOT:PSS (blue) that were measured at the laser wavelength of 642 nm and the power of 0.3 mW. 
To investigate the charge-carrier dynamics upon the insertion of the CONs as HTLs into the PSCs, the photocurrent densities (Jph) were measured as functions of the internal voltage (Vint) and the hole mobility, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively. The photocurrent was driven by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The Jph–Vint. curve of Fig. 8(a) is considered with an emphasis on the two separated regimes, such as a low-voltage regime with unsaturated Jph values and a high-voltage regime with saturated Jph values, since the low-voltage regime is generally related to charge extraction and collection, whereas the high-voltage regime corresponds to charge generation.48
 Fig. 8  (a) Photocurrent density (Jph) vs. internal voltage (Vint) characterization of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), shown in black, the CON-10/PEDOT:PSS (red), and the CON-16/PEDOT:PSS (blue). Both the x-axis and y-axis are on a logarithmic scale. (b) Hole mobility of the hole-only device with the PEDOT:PSS (black) and the CON-10/PEDOT:PSS (red); the y-axis is on a logarithmic scale. 
At first, Jph was increased in proportion to voltage in the low Vint regime that was saturated at a high Vint, and all the photogenerated excitons were dissociated into free charge carriers at 2 V for all the cases. The highest saturation point of the Jph (17.6 mA cm−2) was achieved in the PSCs with the CON-10 layer; this suggested that charge generation in this device was most efficient as compared to that in the two device types without the CONs and with the CON-16 layer: the Jph values of 17.4 mA cm−2 and 15.7 mA cm−2, respectively. This tendency corresponds well to the previously mentioned PL spectra (Fig. 7) and the JSC characteristics of Fig. 6(a). Furthermore, it is obvious that the Jph values for the PSCs with the CON-10 are higher in the low-voltage regime as compared to the other two cases, and this means that the CON-10 can facilitate either charge extraction or charge collection.
The Jph values of the PSCs with CON-16, however, are notably higher up to a point of approximately 0.2 V as compared to that of the PSCs without the CONs, and the Jph values from the devices with CON-16 are saturated earlier than the Jph values from the devices with the PEDOT:PSS. At this point, the CON-16 could also enhance the charge collection and extraction in terms of the energy-aliment diagram of Fig. 2, but the CON-16 limited the degree of charge generation. Therefore, it was clearly demonstrated that the device with the CON-10 layer could generate more charge carriers together with the PDEOT:PSS than the device without the CONs, and it could help in the collection and extraction of charge carriers at the ITO electrode.
Moreover, to gauge the effect of the CONs on the hole mobility, two versions of the hole-only devices with/without the CON-10 under the PEDOT:PSS layers were fabricated with the development of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) layers on top of the perovskite layers and the completion of the devices with Ag electrodes. The characteristic J–V curve of Fig. 8(b) was obtained. In the high-voltage region (higher than 0.5 V), the electron mobility was calculated using the Mott–Gurney law, as shown in the following eqn (1):49 (1)where J, μeff, ε0, εr, V, and d are the current density, the effective charge-carrier mobility, which includes the effect of the injection efficiency49 or the traps, the permittivity of the free space (≈8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3 (≈21.2), the applied voltage, and the thickness of the MAPbI3 layer (≈300 nm), respectively. The J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices were fitted with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.50,51
According to the substitution principle, the hole-only PSCs with CON-10 as the HTL presented a hole mobility (4.69 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) that was approximately two times higher than that of the other hole-only device with the PEDOT:PSS (2.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), as summarized in Fig. 8(b). The higher mobility in the CON-10 may be due to its suitable work function, and this leads to interfacial hole extraction and improved hole carrier transportation,52 thereby resulting in an enhanced JSC. Thus, the optimization of new organic materials as an interlayer is a very meaningful approach for enhancing the electrical characteristics of devices, as proven by the charge-carrier dynamics.
Conclusions
In summary, the present study demonstrates that the CONs can be utilized for the interlayer materials of inverted planar PSCs together with the PEDOT:PSS. When two versions of the CONs were cast on the ITO glass from DMSO suspensions, the HOMO levels for these CONs were slightly higher than those of the PEODT:PSS, and the LUMOs of the CONs and the LUMO of the PEDOT:PSS were almost identical. However, both CONs seemed to be useful for the HTL role. As proven in the band-alignment study, it can be clearly seen that the CON morphologies can influence the hole transport barrier by change in the surface morphologies of the PEDOT:PSS and even by enhancement of the crystallinity of the perovskites layer with CON-10 in the functioning PSCs. As a result, all the PSC devices were optimized, with CON-10 representing a higher PCE than other types of devices that were studied herein, and this was due to the more effective charge-carrier generation and collection with facile mobility.
From a broader perspective, this study indicates that the utilization of a wider selection of monomers may be attempted to address the various challenges in the attainment of some of the target-HTL optoelectric properties in PSCs. In this specific case, and contrary to the previous uses of HTL layers such as in the PEDOT:PSS, the rough CON surfaces were successfully employed to effectively crystallize the surface of the inorganic photoactive layer and transport the charge carriers towards the electrodes. Therefore, this study contributes to an understanding of the physical contributions of each PSC component that will be important for shifting fundamental research endeavors towards commercially feasible technologies.
