    , Accepted 8th February 2016First published on 8th February 2016AbstractPoly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) is shown to be simultaneously cross-linked and p-doped when immersed into a phosphomolybdic acid solution, yielding conductive films with low solubility that can withstand the solution processing of subsequent photoactive layers. Such a modified PCDTBT film serves to improve hole collection and limit carrier recombination in organic solar cells.
Electrical doping of organic semiconductors1,2 is among the key technologies used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), and organic solar cells (OSCs). Efficient p [n] electrical doping is generally realized by addition of a strong electron acceptor [donor] to an organic semiconductor to generate free holes [electrons]. The generated free carriers increase the conductivity and thus minimize ohmic losses through the organic semiconductor. Doping of a semiconductor also leads to a shift in the Fermi level energy, allowing efficient carrier injection and collection with minimal contact resistance.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has long been the standard p-doped polymer used in OSCs, since it serves as an efficient hole-collecting interlayer between indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes and the photoactive layers. However, PEDOT:PSS is hygroscopic in nature, which causes the diffusion of water vapor into the devices, accelerating device degradation.3
Several materials for replacing PEDOT:PSS have been reported.4–12 One class of materials that has found use in this respect, are cross-linkable small molecules13–16 and polymers,17–20 which are structurally defined by electronically active conjugated backbones and photo- or thermally cross-linkable side groups. These materials can be cast from solution and then in situ cross-linked upon ultraviolet irradiation or thermal annealing. Once cross-linked, they become completely insoluble in common organic solvents, and thus compatible with subsequent solution processing. Moreover, cross-linkable materials can also be p-doped by incorporation of strong electron accepters as a p-dopant.13
Although cross-linkable materials have been successfully used to replace PEDOT:PSS, their in situ cross-linking reactions often require a time-consuming high-temperature annealing process (e.g., at 150–200 °C for 0.5–4 hours).21 Such a process greatly increases manufacturing time and cost, while also preventing the use of flexible plastic substrates because of the requirement for processing below their glass-transition temperatures (e.g., 120 °C for PEN).22 To solve this challenge, we have previously reported an oxidative coupling reaction induced by a strong electron accepter, phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) (Fig. 1a inset), for cross-linking polycarbazoles.23 This reaction occurs rapidly upon annealing for three minutes at a temperature of 110 °C to connects two carbazoles at the 3 potions. However, p-doping of the cross-linked polymers was not realized because the cross-linking reaction consumed the radical cations (i.e. free holes) generated by PMA.

Here, we report simultaneous cross-linking and p-doping of a polycarbazole derivative, poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT)24,25 (Fig. 1b inset) by immersing it into a solution of PMA in nitromethane. The immersion of PCDTBT into a solution of the electron-accepting PMA allows for the diffusion of PMA molecules into the film previously formed on the substrate and for the generation of free holes in the volume of the film, resulting in conductive cross-linked films with high tolerance to the processing solvent used to deposit the subsequent photoactive layers (processed from e.g. chlorobenzene). Such a modified PCDTBT film serves to improve hole collection and limit carrier recombination, leading to higher Voc and improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to devices using PEDOT:PSS.
To cross-link and p-dope PCDTBT films, 30 nm-thick PCDTBT films spin-coated from chlorobenzene on quartz substrates were immersed into a 0.5 M nitromethane solution of PMA for up to 60 min, and then rinsed in pure nitromethane. The rinsing removes any residual PMA molecules from the surface of the films. In this process, the PCDTBT films do not dissolve in nitromethane, but allow PMA molecules to diffuse and introduce free holes through the films. Upon immersion for 10 s, the resulting modified PCDTBT films became completely insoluble to common organic solvents, including dimethyl sulfoxide, hydrazine, and chlorobenzene, indicating that the polymer chains were covalently cross-linked into highly interpenetrated network structures. Additionally, we observed a considerably decreased sheet resistance of 1.8 × 105 Ω sq.−1, which is seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of pristine PCDTBT (1.2 × 1012 Ω sq.−1). The sheet resistance further decreased with immersion time from 10 s to 30 min (Fig. 1a), indicating an increase in the penetration depth of PMA into the film. For an immersion time of 30 min, the lowest sheet resistance of 6.0 × 104 Ω sq.−1 was measured, corresponding to a conductivity of 5.5 S cm−1 assuming uniform doping across the entire thickness of the film. This value remained unchanged for an immersion time of 60 min, suggesting that the modified PCDTBT film was saturated with PMA.
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy was used to characterize the modified PCDTBT films (Fig. 1b). The absorption spectra showed a pronounced band around 800 nm, which is consistent with the absorption maximum of the reduced PMA anion.26 Additionally, a broad absorption band appeared above 1100 nm. The broad absorption band above 1100 nm, could be indicative of a charge transfer state formed between PCDTBT and PMA. Both absorption bands increase their intensity as a function of immersion time, supporting the interpretation that the reduction of sheet resistance arises from an increased penetration depth of diffused PMA into the film.
The work function of modified PCDTBT deposited on an ITO electrode was investigated by Kelvin probe measurements. These measurements were calibrated against freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with a known work function of 4.6 eV.27 Relatively thick films (50 nm) were employed to avoid the formation of a space charge region adjacent to the ITO electrode. The work function of pristine PCDTBT was 4.7 eV and was found to increase to a value of 5.2 eV for modified PCDTBT regardless of immersion time (Fig. 2). This increase in work function correlates with an increase in Fermi-level energy upon electrical doping of PCDTBT by immersion into PMA in nitromethane. Note, however, that the formation of interfacial dipoles can also contribute to the measured change in work function. OSCs using modified PCDTBT as a hole-collecting interlayer were examined with the following device architecture: ITO (130 nm)/Modified PCDTBT (30 nm)/PCDTBT:[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) 1:4 (by weight) (70 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). For comparison, PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was also used as a hole-collecting interlayer. The current density (J) as a function of voltage (V) of the OSCs is shown in Fig. 3a. The device performance improved with increasing the immersion time because of the increased penetration depth of diffused PMA in the modified PCDTBT films, as shown by the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1b). For an immersion time of 60 min, the best PCE of 6.8 ± 0.4% was achieved with a Voc value of 0.88 ± 0.01 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.5 ± 0.5 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.63 ± 0.01, averaged over five devices. Reference devices using PEDOT:PSS exhibited an average PCE of 5.7 ± 0.4% with Voc of 0.81 ± 0.02 V, Jsc of 11.7 ± 0.3 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.60 ± 0.01, averaged over five devices. Because the work function of PEDOT:PSS measured by Kelvin probe is 0.3 eV lower than that of modified PCDTBT (Fig. 3b), the improved PCE of devices containing modified PCDTBT hole-collecting layers arises from an increased built-in potential and associated improvement of the Voc and Jsc values.

In summary, we have demonstrated a simple approach to cross-link and p-dope PCDTBT films by immersion into a solution of PMA in nitromethane. The immersion process allows the PMA to diffuse into the pre-coated PCDTBT film and to dope the film across its volume. As a result, PCDTBT was cross-linked through an oxidative coupling reaction, making highly solvent-resistant films. In addition, the electrical conductivity of the PMA-modified PCDTBT films was enhanced through p-doping, yielding a maximum conductivity of 5.5 S cm−1 and a work function of 5.2 eV. The cross-linked and electrically doped PCDTBT film was found to serve as an efficient hole-collecting interlayer in OSCs, as an alternative to PEDOT:PSS.
We expect the overall electrical doping resulting from the immersion of the semiconductor film in a PMA solution to depend on several process parameters, including the choice of solvent, the temperature, the immersion time, and the concentration of the PMA solution. Optimization of these process conditions will be carried out in future studies.
