    , Accepted 9th July 2016First published on 11th July 2016AbstractOrganic small molecule (SM) acceptors containing a perylene diimide (PDI) moiety, F2B-T2PDI and T2PDI are synthesized, and the effects of their molecular geometry on the performance of fullerene-free organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are investigated. The SM acceptors possess a PDI–core–PDI structure in which the PDI wing is connected to conjugated core units. By incorporation of a 2,5-difluorobenzene (F2B) moiety within the core unit, the planarity of the conjugated core is enhanced and the energy levels of the SM acceptor are down-shifted. In terms of molecular geometry, the F2B-containing SM acceptor, F2B-T2PDI, has a rigid core, which can symmetrically align the two PDI wings and enhance molecular packing. As a result, improved electron transport and bulk heterojunction morphology of the active layers are achieved. Furthermore, the incorporation of the F2B moiety effectively down-shifts the HOMO energy level, preventing back-transfer of holes from the acceptor to the cathode and enhancing the absorption of complementary wavelengths of the donor polymer, PTB7-Th. Leveraged by the beneficial geometric and energetic effects from the incorporation of F2B units, the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-free OPV devices using F2B-T2PDI reached 5%, whereas that using T2PDI was 3.63%.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have been widely studied as a potential power source for portable electric devices because of their following properties: lightweight, flexibility, and color tunability. In recent times, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs has been rapidly enhanced, reaching >10% mainly through the development of p-type photoactive donor materials and device architectures.1–10 Concurrently, studies on the other requirements for commercialization, such as mechanical, thermal, and environmental long-term stabilities, are actively ongoing.11 For the latter aspects, the substitution of fullerene acceptors with other organic semiconductors has been extensively considered because the phase segregation between fullerene derivatives and organic donors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends precludes long-term use or mechanical deformation.12,13
In the design of organic acceptors that can replace fullerenes, the organic semiconductors should possess appropriate energy levels (i.e., the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO, and highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO), which can accept electrons from the donor materials without significant energy loss while preventing the back-transfer of holes to donor materials.14–16 In addition, good electron transport properties, complementary optical absorption to the donor materials, and favorable phase segregation in BHJ blends should be considered.17–19 One of the most successful design architectures for organic acceptors has been the alteration of the connection between the electron-accepting moieties (A) and the electron-donating moieties (D). In those structures, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction and the internal D–A polarization enable manipulation of energy levels and charge transport properties.17,20–23
Small molecule (SM) acceptors containing altered D–A moieties have recently been developed because of the synthetic simplicity and the versatility of their structural design. SM acceptors containing various A moieties, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole,24–28 naphthalene-diimide,29,30 rhodanine,31–33 dicyanovinyl,34,35 and perylene diimide (PDI),36–41 have been used to build A–D–A structures that demonstrate impressive performance. The PCEs of the OPVs using SM acceptors could reach >7%.20 Among these, the PDI moiety has received great attention because it has strong electron withdrawing characteristics, electron mobility, thermal stability, and intermolecular stacking behavior. However, strong intermolecular stacking among PDIs often induces excessive self-aggregation; thus, undesirable large segregated domains are formed within the BHJ films.42–44 To prevent these deleterious effects, SM acceptors have been designed so that the PDI moieties are connected to conjugated core units with a highly twisted geometry.39,40,45–51 This strategy has been considerably effective for the control of morphology and processibility in BHJ active layers, improving the PCE of the fullerene-free OPVs.39,40,45–51 Using PDI and conjugated core units, several structures such as vertical twists,36,51 three dimensional (3D) connections,46 propeller shapes,39,45 and nonplanar fused rings47 have been reported.
In this work, we suggest a design strategy to develop PDI-based SM acceptors to improve the performance of fullerene-free OPVs. PDI moieties were employed as wing units on the conjugated core unit in a highly twisted fashion (Scheme 1). The planarity of the conjugated core is manipulated by inserting a 2,5-difluorobenzene (F2B) unit between two thiophene groups. Noncovalent sulfur–fluorine (S–F) interactions have been considered to be an effective way to build a planar backbone structure by minimizing the torsional angles between the aromatic rings via intra/intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions.52–54 Woo et al. demonstrated that the noncovalent S–F coulombic interaction improved the backbone planarity and intermolecular ordering of the polymer chains, resulting in better charge carrier mobility in photovoltaic devices.55,56 These intra-/inter-molecular S–F interactions in the conjugated core unit highly increased the molecular rigidity, while the PDI wings were still connected with a highly twisted geometry (F2B-T2PDI in Scheme 1). Because the alignment of the PDI groups within SM acceptors is a crucial issue to determine the performance of the acceptors,57–59 we focused on the effect of the core planarity on the entire molecular geometry. Furthermore, the alteration of the molecular packing and the optical and energetic properties by the addition of F2B were also investigated. For comparison, a T2PDI acceptor without F2B units was also synthesized as a counterpart (Scheme 1). Fullerene-free BHJ OPV devices using SM acceptors with a narrow bandgap donor polymer, PTB7-Th,60 were fabricated, and the effects of the SM acceptors on the device performance were investigated in terms of charge transport and BHJ morphology. The devices using F2B-T2PDI showed improved PCE (>5%) because of superior electron transport and reduced back transfer compared to those using the counterpart (T2PDI, a PCE of 3.63%). By inclusion of F2B, a highly planar conjugated core with a suppressed HOMO level of the SM acceptor was achieved. The increased rigidity of the core facilitated the packing of the SM acceptors within the BHJ films.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
The synthetic procedure of the SM acceptors (F2B-T2PDI and T2PDI) is described in Scheme 1. Compound 2 was synthesized in high yield (85%) via direct lithiation of compound 1 using lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) followed by distannylation using trimethyltin-chloride. Compound 5 was synthesized according to a literature procedure.61 Finally, the SM acceptors, F2B-T2PDI and T2PDI, were prepared by the Stille coupling between monobrominated PDI (compound 3) and the distannylated core units (2 and 5). The products were easily purified by short-column chromatography and recrystallization, with yields greater than 75%. The SM acceptors were readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), at room temperature. Notably, the overall synthetic yield from the starting reagent (1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene) to F2B-T2PDI was extraordinarily high (>65%), which enables the possibility of bulk scale preparation. More details on the synthesis conditions and characterization results of the small molecule acceptors are shown in the ESI (ESI, Fig. S1–S4†).
The thermal stability of the SM acceptors was evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) under a N2 atmosphere. The temperature for 5% weight loss was 417 °C, indicating sufficient thermal stability during processing and use (Fig. 1a). The melting temperatures (Tm) and the crystallization temperatures (Tc) of F2B-T2PDI determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were 272 °C and 211 °C, respectively, whereas those of T2PDI were 280 °C and 245 °C, respectively (Fig. 1b). The crystallinity of F2B-T2PDI, evaluated by melting energy (Em), was slightly higher (34.9 J g−1) than that of T2PDI (33.9 J g−1). Furthermore, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the crystallization peak of F2B-T2PDI was narrower (6 °C) than that of T2PDI (13 °C). These results indicated that F2B-T2PDI is more easily crystallized than T2PDI because of its planar molecular structure, which is discussed in the “Theoretical calculation” section. The results of the thermal characterization are summarized in Table 1.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the SM acceptors are shown in Fig. 1c and the molar absorption coefficient of SM acceptors and a PDI wing are reported in Fig. S5a.† F2B-T2PDI displayed strong absorptions at ∼360 nm and ∼500 nm, whereas T2PDI exhibited a strong absorption at ∼500 nm with a relatively lower absorption at ∼340 nm. The absorptions of the films were slightly red-shifted compared to those of the solutions in chloroform. F2B-T2PDI showed a distinct absorption shoulder at ∼600 nm that is typically known to occur by intermolecular packing.56,62 The enhanced absorption of F2B-T2PDI in short wavelengths (∼360 nm) is attributed to the additional benzene ring in the core unit; the high aromatic resonance energy (1.56 eV) of the benzene ring decreases the quinoidal population of the conjugated backbones by preventing the π-electron delocalization, resulting in the stronger absorption in the short wavelength region.63 The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of F2B-T2PDI and T2PDI obtained from the absorption onsets in the film samples were 1.77 and 1.69 eV, respectively. The larger bandgap of F2B-T2PDI was also caused by the F2B group in the core because the fluorine substituents reduce the electron-donating strength of the core and the high aromatic resonance energy of the benzene ring diminishes the efficient π-electron delocalization.63
The HOMO energy level (EHOMO) and LUMO energy level (ELUMO) of the SM acceptors were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 1e. The onsets of the oxidation and reduction potentials were measured, and the EHOMO and ELUMO were calculated relative to the redox potentials of the internal standard, ferrocene. The EHOMO and ELUMO of F2B-T2PDI were −5.94 and −3.83 eV, respectively, whereas those of T2PDI were −5.80 and −3.85 eV, respectively. The bandgap values determined by CV (ECVg) of F2B-T2PDI and T2PDI were 2.11 eV and 1.95 eV, respectively, which showed a similar trend to that of the Eoptg values. The addition of the F2B unit down-shifted the HOMO energy level of F2B-T2PDI compared to that of T2PDI, which may be beneficial to prevent the back-transfer of holes from the acceptor to the cathode, facilitating charge carrier transfer in OPVs. The results of the optical and electrochemical characterizations are summarized in Table 2.

Theoretical calculations
The ground state (So) geometric structures of the SM acceptors were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set. As shown in Fig. 2, F2B-T2PDI showed high planarity in the core unit, with a dihedral angle of <3° between F2B and the thiophenes, while the PDI wings are highly twisted with respect to the core unit (59.7°). The core of T2PDI, however, had a more twisted geometry between the two thiophene rings, with a dihedral angle of 21.5°, while the PDI wings are highly twisted with respect to the core unit (57.1°). The values for the dihedral angle by DFT calculations are summarized in Table 3. The high planarity of F2B-T2PDI is attributed to the intramolecular interaction between S and F atoms. In addition, the planarity of the core unit in F2B-T2PDI enabled more symmetrical alignment with a 90° tilt angle between the PDI wings in the 3D structure; however, the more twisted core structure of T2PDI induced less aligned PDI wings, with a 110° tilt angle (Fig. 2). Thus, the unique geometry of F2B-T2PDI (rigid core, twisted core–wing connection, and aligned PDI wings) induced higher crystallinity with good solution processability.

Photovoltaic properties
BHJ OPV devices were fabricated using our SM acceptors and a low bandgap donor polymer, PTB7-Th (Fig. 3). As shown in the energy level diagram in Fig. 1f, the sufficient energy gaps between PTB7-Th and the SM acceptors ensured efficient exciton dissociation.64 In addition, we carefully examined PL emission properties of neat PTB7-Th and PTB7-Th/SM blend films (a thickness of ∼90 nm). Almost complete photoluminescence (PL) quenching of the PTB7-Th/SM acceptor blend films compared to that of the neat PTB7-Th film, shown in Fig. 1d, confirmed the effective photoinduced charge transfer between the PTB7-Th donor and the SM acceptors. The change in the PL intensity was quite significant indicating the decrease in PL stems from the charge transfer rather than any variation in thickness. Inverted structure OPV devices, in which in situ sol–gel derived ZnO layers and a thermally evaporated MoOx layer were used as the electron- and hole-transporting buffer layers, respectively, were fabricated. The structure of the devices was ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI (or T2PDI)/MoOx/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1f.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices (under AM 1.5G one sun conditions, 100 mW cm−2) using various PTB7-Th/SM acceptor blend ratios are shown in Fig. S6,† and the results are summarized in Table S1.† In the case of PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI, the 1.0:1.2 ratio blends showed optimum performance, whereas the 1.0:1.5 ratio showed optimized results in PTB7-Th:T2PDI blends. These optimized blend ratios were used for later studies. By inclusion of 3% of a conventional additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the device performance was considerably enhanced. The F2B-T2PDI-based devices showed a PCE of 5.05% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 10.60 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.57, while the T2PDI-based devices exhibited an average PCE of 3.63% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 8.95 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.49 (Fig. 3a and Table 4). This is attributed to the enhanced phase separation by DIO addition, as indicated by the PL increase of the BHJ films (Fig. 1d). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra indicated that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was enhanced in the entire visible region by DIO addition (Fig. 3b). The broad EQE spectra from ∼350 to ∼750 nm suggested that both PTB7-Th and the SM acceptors contributed to the EQE response and Jsc. In particular, the F2B-T2PDI-based devices showed higher EQE values at shorter wavelengths (∼400 nm) compared to those of the T2PDI-based devices. This result is attributed to the enhanced optical absorption of F2B-T2PDI because the donor polymer (PTB7-Th) has low absorption in those wavelengths. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 4.

As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 4, the improved performance in the devices using F2B-T2PDI compared to that of T2PDI mainly originated from the greatly enhanced Jsc and FF values, whereas the Voc values are comparable because of the nearly identical LUMO levels of the two SM acceptors. In addition to higher FF values, the EQE values of the F2B-T2PDI-based devices were much higher in the >500 nm region, although the optical absorptions of the active layers are similar (Fig. S5b†). This result suggested that the charge extraction properties of the F2B-T2PDI-based devices are superior. Intensity-dependent Jsc characteristics can reveal the effects of non-geminate bimolecular recombination on the charge extraction properties (Fig. 3c). The power-law dependence of Jsc upon the illumination intensity can generally be expressed as Jsc ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor.65,66 Given that the α value is close to unity, bimolecular recombination during the charge sweep-out under short-circuit conditions is negligible.66–68 The α value of the F2B-T2PDI-based devices was 0.963, whereas that of the T2PDI-based devices was 0.948 (Fig. 3c). This result indicates that the enhanced charge transport properties of F2B-T2PDI contributed to the improved device performance by reduction of bimolecular recombination.
To understand the charge transport properties of the devices, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the active layers were measured using the steady-state space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S7 and S8†). Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated using configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoOx/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/ZnO/Al, respectively. The mobility of the blend films was determined by the Mott–Gurney law, in the SCLC trap free regime, by using the slope of J1/2vs. V. The μe of the PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI blend film (3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was >5 times higher than that of the PTB7-Th:T2PDI blend film (6.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas the μh of the PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI blend film (9.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was ∼2 times lower than that of the PTB7-Th:T2PDI blend film (1.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). As a result, the PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI blend possessed a much more balanced μh/μe ratio (2.9) compared to that of the PTB7-Th:T2PDI blend (28.9). The better-balanced hole/electron ratio in the F2B-T2PDI-based devices is responsible for their reduced bimolecular charge recombination.
Morphology characterization
The morphology of the active layers is an important factor to determine the charge generation and extraction properties of OPVs. Properly segregated highly crystalline donor and acceptor domains are a generally favored morphology. The surface morphology of our blend active layers was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images in Fig. 4 exhibit highly uniform blend films (PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI and PTB7-Th:T2PDI) with a root mean square roughness (RRMS) of 0.61 and 0.73 nm, respectively. However, by the addition of DIO, the surface morphology of the blend films became rougher (RRMS > 2 nm), indicating enhanced phase segregation.

The internal molecular ordering of the blend films was revealed using two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD). 2D-GIXD patterns provide detailed information about morphological changes in terms of molecular packing and orientation. As shown in Fig. 5a and d, the neat SM acceptor films showed crystallinity with no preferential orientation, whereas the PTB7-Th films showed crystallinity with a strong face-on orientation, as indicated by the (010) out-of-plane (Qz) peaks at 1.67 Å−1, corresponding to an intermolecular π–π distance of ca. 3.76 Å (Fig. 5g). After DIO treatment as shown in Fig. 5c and f, the orientation of the acceptors is much developed in both face-on and edge-on directions with a clear (h00) reflection. Thus, it is expected that the slower evaporation of DIO due to its high boiling point (168 °C) allows favorable phase separation between the electron donor and the acceptor and forms better molecular ordering in the 3D electron pathway, which is in good agreement with the AFM results (Fig. 4).19

In the blend films without DIO, the face-on orientation of PTB7-Th and the crystallinity of the SM acceptors were significantly suppressed (Fig. 5b and e), indicating the considerable intermixing of PTB7-Th and the SM acceptors. However, the face-on orientation of PTB7-Th was more prominent in the PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI film than in the PTB7-Th:T2PDI film (Fig. 5b and e), which indicates the enhanced phase separation between PTB7-Th and F2B-T2PDI. By addition of DIO, both blend films showed greatly improved intermolecular ordering in both the face-on and edge-on orientations. The average interval of (h00) reflections of the SM acceptors in the blend films were obviously developed along the Qxy and Qz axes, indicating well-ordered three dimensional (3D) layered structures (Fig. 5c and f). Furthermore, the face-on ordering of PTB7-Th was also enhanced. This result revealed that the addition of DIO improved the 3D molecular ordering of PTB7-Th and the SM acceptors in the blend films because of enhanced phase separation. This enhanced 3D molecular ordering by addition of DIO offered improved charge transport pathways. The higher face-on ordering of PTB7-Th and the improved BHJ phase segregation in the PTB7-Th:F2B-T2PDI film compared to those of the PTB7-Th:T2PDI film were observed even after DIO addition.
The azimuthally uniform reflections of both SM acceptors in the 2D-GIXD results (Fig. 5a and d) revealed 3D intermolecular ordering. This is a beneficial morphology for SM acceptors because it can facilitate 3D electron transport, which resembles the charge transport by fullerenes, the state-of-the-art acceptor material for OPVs. In BHJ films, the F2B-T2PDI acceptor showed superior morphology compared to that of the T2PDI acceptor, which is reflected in the device performance. We attribute the superior properties of F2B-T2PDI to its geometric uniqueness. Firstly, the highly twisted core–PDI connection can resist to form excessively large domains; secondly, the highly rigid F2B-containing conjugated core unit can enhance the intermolecular packing to yield high crystallinity; finally, the PDI wing units are geometrically aligned because of the plane core unit, which facilitates electron transport. Recently, similar effects of molecular geometry on the packing and electron mobility of PDI-containing SM acceptors were also reported by Yu and co-workers.69 Our work suggests a design strategy for SM acceptors by geometric manipulation to achieve a favorable morphology with high electron transport.
Conclusions
Organic small molecules with PDI–core–PDI architectures were synthesized, and their performance as electron acceptors for OPV devices was investigated. The molecular geometry of the SM acceptors was manipulated by inserting the F2B moiety in conjugated core units. The S–F interaction in F2B-T2PDI yielded a highly rigid planar core unit, which enhanced the molecular packing and also symmetrically aligned the PDI moieties. The twisted connection between the core and PDI was preserved, preventing excessive phase aggregation. The unique molecular geometry of F2B-T2PDI afforded improved morphology and electron transport in BHJ active films compared to its counterpart (T2PDI). Furthermore, the incorporation of the F2B moiety effectively down-shifted the HOMO energy level, preventing back-transfer of holes from the acceptor to the cathode, while enhancing the absorption at short wavelengths that are complementary to that of the PTB7-Th donor. These beneficial geometric and energetic effects by the incorporation of F2B units resulted in improved acceptor performance. The PCE of fullerene-free OPV devices using F2B-T2PDI reached 5%, whereas that of devices using T2PDI was 3.63%. Our synthetic approach on PDI-based acceptors provides important information to design the better non-fullerene acceptors.
Experimental
Synthesis

((2,5-Difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(trimethylstannane) (2). 
2,2′-(2,5-Difluoro-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene (1) (1.0 g, 3.60 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (100 ml). After cooling the solution at −78 °C, 2 M lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in THF/​heptane/​ethylbenzene (4.0 ml, 8.0 mmol) was slowly added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 hours at −78 °C, and then 1 M trimethyltin chloride (10 ml, 10 mmol) was added dropwise. After 30 min, the reaction temperature was slowly increased to room temperature, and then the solvent was evaporated using a rotary vacuum. The pale yellow slurry was poured into methanol and a white solid was precipitated out. The white solid product was recrystallized from dichloromethane/methanol, and white crystals were obtained with a yield of 75% (1.6 g). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): δ 7.62 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 2H), 7.43 (t, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.22 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 0.44 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): δ 155.88, 153.46, 141.54, 139.76, 136.00, 127.82, 121.89, 121.78, 121.65, 115.49, 115.37, 115.30, 115.18, −8.16.


1-Bromo-N,N′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (3). 

N,N′-Bis(2-hexyldecyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (5 g, 5.96 mmol) was added to chloroform (200 ml). At room temperature, bromine (6 ml, 118 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction solution and then heated to 60 °C for 2 days. When the starting material had almost disappeared, the reaction was quenched by water. After removing bromine using aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution, the organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The purple solid was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with dichlorobenzene:hexanes (1:1 v/v) and dried under vacuum to afford a red solid (2.58 g, 47%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): δ 9.48 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 8.57 (s, J = 8.8 Hz, 1H), 8.40 (m, 3H), 8.20 (m, 2H), 4.05 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 4.01 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 1.93 (br, 2H), 1.24 (m, 48H), 0.82 (t, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): δ 163.34, 163.03, 162.90, 162.10, 138.85, 133.14, 132.76, 132.60, 130.53, 130.14, 128.32, 128.00, 127.62, 127.45, 126.26, 123.33, 123.27, 123.21, 122.82, 122.54, 122.33, 120.78, 44.74, 44.69, 36.70, 36.66, 31.91, 31.89, 31.71, 30.11, 30.08, 29.79, 29.77, 29.61, 29.34, 26.47, 22.68, 14.11.

A mixture of compound 2 (0.2 g, 0.331 mmol), compound 3 (0.67 g, 0.728 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (35 mg, 0.03 mmol) was dissolved in degassed toluene (12 ml). After refluxing the mixture for 2 days, it was poured into water and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed three times with water and dried over magnesium sulfate. The crude product was reprecipitated with chloroform/acetone and then purified by column chromatography on silica gel with dichloromethane.

General characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend™-400 spectrometer, with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. The absorption spectra were measured on a SHIMADZU/UV-2550 model UV-visible spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Thermo plus EVO II TG 8120 instrument under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a METTLER TOLEDO/DSC1 STARe system under N2 with a heating and cooling rate of 5 °C min−1. PL spectra of neat PTB7-Th and PTB7-Th/SM blend films were measured under the excitation at 650 nm (Nanolog, HORIBA Scientific). All of the film thicknesses were controlled to be ∼90 nm. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a BAS 100B/W electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in a 0.1 N Bu4NBF4 solution in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The polymer film was coated onto a Pt wire electrode by dipping the electrode into a polymer solution in chloroform. All measurements were calibrated against an internal standard of ferrocene (Fc), the ionization potential (IP) value of which is −4.8 eV for the Fc/Fc+ redox system. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with a Waters 2690 Associates liquid chromatography instrument equipped with a Waters 2414 differential refractometer. Chloroform was used as the eluent and polystyrene was used as the standard. The morphology of the PTB7-Th:SM acceptor blend films was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using tapping mode, and the AFM scan images (5 μm × 5 μm) were acquired in tapping mode on a Nanoscope instrument (Bruker).
Two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD)
2D-GIXD measurements were performed under vacuum at the 6D beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Republic of Korea. The samples were prepared on ZnO-modified Si substrates under the same conditions as those used for the fabrication of solar cell devices. The wavelength of the X-ray was 0.1069 nm and the incidence angle (i.e., the angle between the critical angle of the sample and that of Si) was 0.12°. The 2D-GIXD patterns were recorded using a 2D-CCD detector (MX225-HS, Rayonix L.L.C., USA), and the X-ray irradiation time was set at 0.5 to 10 s, depending on the saturation level of the detector. The 2D-GIXD images from the films were analyzed based on the relationship between the scattering vector (q) and the d spacing (q = 2π/d).
Device fabrication
Bulk heterojunction OPVs were fabricated with an inverted structure (ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag). Firstly, ZnO electron transporting layers (20 nm) were prepared by in situ ZnO sol–gel conversion on pre-cleaned ITO substrates following a reported procedure.70,71 A precursor solution, a 0.45 M solution of zinc acetate dehydrate ([Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%, 5 g) and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, Sigma Aldrich, 99.5%, 1.35 ml) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%, 50 ml), was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 15 s in an ambient environment, followed by thermal treatment at a mild temperature (∼150 °C for 10 min). The bulk heterojunction active layers were achieved by spin-coating the PTB7-Th:SM acceptor (F2B-T2PDI or T2PDI) solutions. The donor density was 8 mg ml−1. The thickness of the active layers was ∼80 nm. Thin hole-transporting layers, MoOx (8 nm), and a metal electrode, Ag (100 nm), were deposited by thermal evaporation at reduced pressure (10−6 bar).
Device analysis
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2401 instrument and a solar simulator with a 150 W Xenon lamp (Newport) as the light source. The light intensity was set to AM 1.5G and calibrated using a monosilicon standard from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The incident photon to electron (IPCE) spectra were obtained by passing the output of a 400 W Xenon lamp through a monochromator using the appropriate order-sorting filters. The collimated output of the monochromator was measured through a 1 mm aperture with calibrated Newport 818-UV and 818-IR power meters (McScience, K3100 IQX). The IPCE values were collected at a chopping frequency of 1 Hz from 300 to 1100 nm. The charge mobilities of the active layers were measured by the steady-state space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The structures of hole-only and electron-only devices were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoOx/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/ZnO/Al, respectively. The mobility of the blend films was determined by the Mott–Gurney law in the SCLC trap free regime, by using the slope of J1/2vs. V.
