    , Accepted 29th March 2018First published on 29th March 2018AbstractA fully conjugated ladder polymer (PFIDT) based on the indacenodithiophene unit was synthesized via a simple strategy. PFIDT displayed a strong intramolecular charge transfer character with a small Stokes shift as a result of the geometrically constrained and rigid conjugated molecular system and thus, PFIDT showed a promising potential in optoelectronic applications.
Fully conjugated ladder polymers (FCLPs) have received intensive attention in optoelectronic applications and fundamental polymer science due to their distinctive chemical structures compared with the conventional conjugated polymers.1,2 Generally, FCLPs have fully π-conjugated and fused backbones along the polymer chains with a restricted torsional motion among the conjugated units, which endows them with special properties such as a well-defined fully conjugated ladder backbone, fast intrachain charge and/or photon transport, small reorganization energy, long exciton diffusion length and strong π-π interactions. Since the first soluble FCLP was reported by Müllen et al., numerous FCLPs for various applications have been designed and synthesized with significant efforts from polymer chemists.3–13 For example, Scherf et al. developed a series of phenylene- and carbazole-based FCLPs and investigated their charge transport and electroluminescent properties.14 Luscombe et al. developed solution-processable n-type FCLPs based on naphthalene bisimide and achieved an electron mobility of up to 0.0026 cm2 V−1 s−1.15 Recently, Scherf et al. prepared novel donor–acceptor type FCLPs by incorporating the benzothiadiazolodithienopyrrole unit.16
In recent years, indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based conjugated polymers for organic solar cells (OSCs) have been developed rapidly due to their rigid and fused aromatic systems.17,18 A power conversion efficiency of up to 13% has been achieved from IDT-based polymers with material and device innovations, which indicate that the IDT unit is a very attractive building block for pursuing high-performance OSCs.19–22 However, IDT-based FCLPs have not been reported due to their limited synthesis strategies.
Herein, we report a new and simple strategy for synthesizing IDT-based FCLP (PFIDT, Scheme 1). With this strategy, the time-consuming synthesis of aromatic carbonyl groups and the use of methyllithium (MeLi) in the traditional synthesis method for FCLP can be avoided (Fig. S1†); the all-aromatic side chains in PFIDT not only guarantee the solubility of the resulting ladder conjugated polymer, but also impede the intermolecular coupling side reactions and confer regioselectivity in the ring closure reaction.7,23 Moreover, the aromatic side chains can also be easily tuned with specific functional groups to satisfy the requirements of optoelectronic applications (Fig. S1†). The symmetrical aromatic side chains in PFIDT are different from those in previously reported asymmetric FCLPs and may have significant effects on inter/intramolecular π–π interactions and optoelectronic properties.24,25
 Scheme 1  Synthesis routes of ladder-typed PFIDT. 
The synthetic route towards PFIDT containing IDT repeat units with peripheral tetrahexylbenzyl groups is shown in Scheme 1. Instead of the carbonyl group, we selected the 2-ethylhexyl ester group in 1,4-dibromo-2,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)benzenedicarboxylate (1) as the unsaturated reactive substrate, which can be attacked by two equivalent nucleophilic agents to form polyalcohols. Palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization of 1 and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (2) was carried out under standard conditions to produce the FCLP precursor PBTT with ester groups. The 2-ethylhexyl side chains of PBTT ensured good solubility for the functionalization reaction. The subsequent nucleophilic reaction was carried out using a similar strategy developed by us for the synthesis of IDT, except that PBTT was used as the substrate.26 The addition of lithium n-hexylphenyl into PBTT solution generated the polyalcohol PBTT-OH efficiently after a simple aqueous workup. Direct use of the nucleophilic agent to produce the polyalcohol, instead of using excess of reducing agents such as MeLi or lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) in the carbonyl-type strategy, simplified the process and also avoided possible side reactions caused by the reducing agents (Fig. S1†). The double-stranded PFIDT was prepared by the direct treatment of the polyalcohol PBTT-OH with boron trifluoride in THF via the Friedel–Crafts ring closure reaction. As discussed above, quantitative conversion of the ring annulation reaction is necessary to achieve well-defined FCLPs. In our strategy, it was proved that the amount of the nucleophilic agent lithium n-hexylphenyl played a determinative role in the conversion efficiency. Eight or more equivalent of the nucleophilic agents in excess was needed for the full conversion of PFIDT. An incompletely converted polymer PBTT-FIDT (see ESI† for details) was also prepared for comparison. In addition, our strategy also provided a generalized route for obtaining other novel FCLPs by selecting different aromatic nucleophilic agents or other C2h symmetric comonomers. The obtained fully conjugated ladder polymer PFIDT exhibited good solubilities in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobezene. The weight-averaged molecular weight (Mw) of FPIDT measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with trichlorbenzene as eluent was 16 kDa, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 1.68 (Table 1).

Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was employed to investigate the effectiveness of the Friedel–Crafts ring closure reaction of PBTT toward the fully conjugated ladder PFIDT, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen from the chemical structures of PBTT and PFIDT (Scheme 1), the biggest difference in the functional groups on both polymers was the ester group in PBTT. Moreover, it is well-known that the ester group has two notable characteristic peaks in the range 1000–1800 cm−1.27 As shown in Fig. 1, PBTT had an obvious and strong peak at 1720 cm−1, which was ascribed to the stretching vibration absorption of CO in PBTT. In PFIDT, this characteristic peak vanished due to the lack of CO groups. As expected, the stretching vibration of the CO characteristic peak in PFIDT disappeared as a result of the formation of the ladder type structures. Moreover, further evidence of the complete conversion could also be found from the strong bending vibration peaks of C–O–C groups in PBTT at 1239 and 1104 cm−1, which disappeared in the FT-IR spectrum of PFIDT (Fig. 1). It is noted that the small peaks at ∼1187 and 1240 cm−1 in the spectrum of PFIDT came from the C–C and C–S vibration peaks. In addition, FT-IR spectrum of the incompletely converted polymer PBTT-FIDT was also obtained (Fig. S2†). As expected, PBTT-FIDT displayed both relatively strong stretching and bending vibration peaks of the CO and C–O–C groups when compared with PBTT.

The chemical structures of PBTT and PFIDT were further confirmed by 1H NMR spectra, and the well-resolved resonance signals are shown in Fig. 2. From the chemical structures of PBTT and PFIDT, three significant changes in 1H NMR were expected upon quantitative conversion. First, the characteristic chemical shift (δ) of protons of −(CO)–CH2– on the benzene unit of PBTT will disappear as a result of the nucleophilic reaction. Second, the proton signals of the thienothiophene unit in PBTT will also be eliminated on PFIDT after the Friedel–Crafts ring annulation reaction. Third, new characteristic resonance signals of –CH2– in the hexylphenyl side chains will appear in the proton NMR spectrum of PFIDT. In addition, the chemical shift movements of the proton resonance signals from the benzene units of PBTT and PFIDT backbones and newly appeared double resonance signals from the protons of phenyl side chains on PFIDT were also expected. As seen from Fig. 2, δ at 4.15 ppm could be observed in the spectrum of PBTT (pink), which corresponded to –(CO)–CH2– of the 2-ethylhexyl chain, whereas this resonance signal completely disappeared in the spectrum of PFIDT. The proton resonance signal on thienothiophene of PBTT was found at 7.37 ppm (green), which was also not seen in the 1H NMR spectrum of PFIDT. After the addition of peripheral n-hexylbenzyl groups in PFIDT, a newly emerged singlet characteristic resonance signal of –CH2– could be found at 2.53 ppm (yellow). Moreover, the singlet resonance signal at 7.89 ppm corresponding to two protons of benzene in the PFIDT backbone (blue) shifted to 7.31 ppm because the adjacent chemical environment changed from an electron-withdrawing ester group to electron-donating moiety after the ring closure reaction. Resonance signals at 7.04–7.12 ppm also appeared and were attributed to the protons of phenyl side chains on PFIDT. The 1H NMR spectrum of incomplete FCLP PBTT-FIDT was also measured and is shown in Fig. S3.† As discussed above, it can be seen that there is a coexistence of the resonance signals from both PBTT and PFIDT. By using the ratio of the newly emerged chemical shift and protons of the benzene unit in the PBTT-FIDT backbone, the conversion efficiency of PBTT to PFIDT in the incomplete ladder polymer PBTT-FIDT was estimated at ∼24%. After combining the FT-IR and 1H NMR results, it can be safely stated that PFIDT is a well-defined and fully conjugated ladder polymer. The results also demonstrated that our new strategy for synthesizing FCLPs is highly efficient and controllable.

To gain an insight into the relationship between structure and property, the optical properties of PBTT and PFIDT were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3, PBTT in chlorobenzene solution exhibited a typical structureless absorption band at 300–450 nm with a peak at 403 nm, which was ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between di(2-ethylhexyl) benzenedicarboxylate and thienothiophene. The maximum extinction coefficient of PBTT in solution was 2.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. 3b). In PFIDT, the absorption band showed a significant bathochromic shift due to the increased effective conjugation length. The well-structured absorption profile of PFIDT in solution showed 0–1 and 0–0 bands at 504 nm and 543 nm, respectively. The maximum extinction coefficient of PFIDT solution was 2.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (543 nm), which was slightly higher than that of PBTT. The absorption band of the PFIDT film had a very similar structure to the absorption band of PFIDT in solution. The 0–1 and 0–1 absorption bands gave slight blue-shifts to 501 nm and 540 nm, respectively. As seen from Fig. 3a, the well-structured absorption profile with a very steep absorption edge in PFIDT indicated the existence of a highly defined ground electronic structure and strong intramolecular charge transfer. The optical bandgaps of PBTT and PFIDT films estimated from the absorption edges (493 nm and 572 nm) were calculated to be 2.52 eV and 2.17 eV, respectively (Table 1). For PBTT-FIDT, the absorption band contained absorption bands from both PBTT and PFIDT (Fig. S4a†). The results further proved the successful preparation of the fully conjugated ladder polymer PFIDTvia the new proposed synthesis strategy. The photoluminescences (PL) of both polymers in film states were also measured and are shown in Fig. 3c. It can see that PBTT still showed a structure-less emission band with a PL maximum at 515 nm, whereas a structured emission band was observed for PFIDT with a PL maximum of 558 nm. The Stokes shift of PBTT was found to be as large as 113 nm; however, the Stokes shift was reduced to 15 nm in PFIDT, which is believed to be the result of the geometrically constrained and rigid conjugated system with much smaller geometric changes resulting from the transition from the ground to excited states. Fig. 3d also shows the colors of both polymers in either solution or powder under a UV lamp (365 nm). The colors of PBTT and PFIDT changed from yellow to pink in solution and from yellow to purple black in powder, and these results were identical to the above measurements.

To better understand the conformations of PBTT and PFIDT, geometry optimization was carried out using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Gaussian 09 software and B3LYP/6-31G** were used for full geometry optimization. Methyl groups were used to replace hexyl side chains and model compounds of the polymers with three repeated units to economize calculation time. The optimized conformations and representative orbital surfaces are provided in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals were all delocalized along the backbone of PFIDT, which was due to the strong electronic interactions as a result of the highly fused conjugated molecular configuration. However, the LUMO energy levels of PBTT were mainly localized at the backbone and also extended to the side chains in small portions, which was due to the weak conjugation of the ester group with the PBTT backbone (Fig. 4). Moreover, the dihedral angle between the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moiety and ethylhexyl ester side chains was calculated to be −44.3°, resulting in a more twisted geometry for the precursor PBTT. As expected in FCLPs, the extremely rigid and restricted planar structure of PFIDT resulted in a dihedral angle as small as 0.89° (Fig. S5†). The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PBTT and PFIDT were −5.52 eV/−2.31 eV and −4.53 eV/−1.96 eV with calculated bandgaps of 3.21 eV and 2.57 eV, respectively, which agreed well with those obtained from the optical and electrochemical measurements (Table 1).

Bottom-gate bottom-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with solution-processed PBTT and PFIDT were used to evaluate the carrier transport properties. PBTT showed extremely low value with nearly undetectable mobility of less than 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. As expected, PFIDT showed a typical p-type characteristic, and the corresponding output and transfer plots are presented in Fig. 5. Different channel lengths and annealing temperatures were also applied in OFETs of PFIDT (see Fig. S6 and Table S1† for details). The best hole mobility of 1.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved with a channel length of 5 μm after annealing at 120 °C for 20 min.

In summary, an indacenodithiophene-based FCLP (PFIDT) has been designed and synthesized by a new and simple synthetic strategy using a nucleophilic agent to produce polyalcohol directly. FT-IR and 1H NMR analyses show that this strategy is highly efficient for the quantitative conversion of a precursor to the fully conjugated ladder polymer. The optical and electrochemical properties of PFIDT are also investigated, and strong intramolecular charge transfer along the polymer backbone can be found. Moreover, OFETs based on solution-processed PFIDT films are also fabricated to study the charge carrier transport properties. The best hole mobility of 1.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 is achieved. These results provide an enlightening pathway for designing and synthesizing state-of-the-art FCLPs through a simplified strategy.
