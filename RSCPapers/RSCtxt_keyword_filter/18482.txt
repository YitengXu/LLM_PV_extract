The acceptor addition (PC71BM or ITIC) was beneficial for charge transport and suppressed charge recombination. Addition of a 9 nm PC71BM layer on the surface of the bulk-heterojunction layers significantly improved the performance of rigid OSCs (on glass substrates), and the maximum PCE increased from 8.99% to 10.25%, which was higher than that (9.78%) of the OSCs using ITIC. In addition, the degradation of the OSCs during long-term stability testing reduced from 21% to 14% Furthermore, the PCE of flexible OSCs (on polyethylene naphthalate substrate) improved from 7.65% to 8.52%. Our results indicated that evaporating PC71BM on the surface of bulk-heterojunction layers is a simple and effective method to fabricate high-performance rigid and flexible OSCs.
1. Introduction
During the past few decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their high performance, light weight, low cost, and simple processing properties.1–3 Recently, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11% has been achieved for a single OSC,4 indicating a bright future for commercialization.1–4
To further improve the PCE of OSCs, approaches such as finding new materials, designing new structures, and optimizing fabrication procedures have been under investigation.5–9 Owing to their high performance, OSCs using poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the donor and acceptor materials, respectively, to form bulk-heterojunctions layers have been actively studied.5,10,11 Recently, strategies such as molecular engineering of PTB7-Th and the use of new acceptor materials and ternary blend systems have been developed to improve the performance of OSCs.5,12–16 Moreover, the morphology of the active layers also plays a very important role in determining the performance of OSCs, because it is closely related to charge generation, dissociation, and collection.3,5,6 For PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based OSCs, chlorobenzene (CB) is typically employed as the host solvent to form bulk-heterojunction layers.5,17 To control the morphology, 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) is frequently used as an additive solvent, resulting in a better phase separation of the donor and acceptor.5,17,18 However, to further enhance the performance, other techniques to control the morphologies of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM layers have been developed. For example, by changing the host solvent, such as o-xylene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and using new additives, like N-methylpyrrolidone and p-anisaldehyde, to form bulk-heterojunction layers, PCEs of 8.80–10.40% were achieved for PTB7-Th-based OSCs.11,17–19 Using the solvent flux and vacuum drying methods, Zhao and coworkers optimized the morphology of the active layer and enhanced the PCE of PTB7-Th-based OSCs from 6.79% to 7.67%.20 By adjusting the amount of PC71BM in the active layers, the crystallinity of PTB7-Th was well tuned. As a result, a high PCE of 10.61% was achieved by He et al.21 A top-down post-additive soaking approach was developed to reconstruct the PTB7-Th:PC71BM layer, resulting in an improved PCE of 9.74%.22 However, owing to the vertical phase separation, it was found that PTB7-Th-rich and PC71BM-poor surfaces were formed on PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunctions layers after conventional spin-coating and drying processes, which negatively affected the performance of OSCs.20,23,24 To overcome this issue, in addition to using a solvent additive, an upside-down drying method for PTB7-Th:PC71BM layer preparation was first proposed by Sun et al., which resulted in an improved PCE (up to 10.30%) and stability.23 Huang et al. developed an inverted off-center spin-coating technique for controlling the morphology and tuning the ratio of PTB7-Th:PC71BM on the active layers, thus improving the PCE of the corresponding OSCs from 9.26% to 10.82%.24 These results indicate that increasing the amount of PC71BM on the surface of the active layers is very effective for improving the performance of PTB7-Th-based OSCs. To date, there has been no investigation on the direct supply of acceptor materials to the surface of PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based bulk-heterojunction layers. Although previous research has indicated solution deposition of PCBM on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based bulk-heterojunction layers,25 due the solubility of PTB7-Th and PC71BM, solution processing of additional acceptors may destroy the underlying PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layers. It has been reported that the deposition of additional PCBM- on P3HT-based active layers via thermal evaporation successfully improved the performance of the related OSCs, with PCEs improving to 3.5–4.5%.26,27 However, the PCEs of P3HT-based cells need to be improved considerably compared to that of PTB7-Th-based cells before commercialization can be considered.5 Moreover, the fabrication processes for P3HT- and PTB7-Th-based cells are quite different, with both using different component ratios and operations to control the morphology of the active layers.5,26,27 Thus, it is very important to investigate the addition of non-solution-based acceptors on the surface of PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunctions layers and investigate its effect on the performance of PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based OSCs.
In this study, we used a vacuum deposition method to supply PC71BM and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC, a non-fullerene acceptor) to the surface of PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based bulk-heterojunction layers using a thermal evaporator. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated the formation of PTB7-Th-rich and PC71BM-poor surfaces on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer, which was disadvantageous for the performance of OSCs. Adding a 9 nm PC71BM layer on the surface of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layers significantly improved the PCE of rigid OSCs (on glass substrates) from 8.99% to 10.25%, and this value was higher than the PCE achieved using ITIC (maximum PCE = 9.78%), with simultaneous increases in the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) values. The impendence, electron mobility, and dark current analysis indicated the improved electron transport and suppressed charge recombination due to the addition of PC71BM. The long-term stability also improved by the use of additional PC71BM, with the PCE degradation reducing from 21% to 14%. Furthermore, the PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based flexible OSCs on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate was improved from 7.65% to 8.52%. Our results indicated that the addition of PC71BM on the surface of PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based bulk-heterojunction layers is a simple and effective method for improving the performance of both rigid and flexible OSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Device fabrication
PTB7-Th and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material, Inc. (Canada) and Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (China), respectively. The non-fullerene acceptor ITIC was purchased from Ossila (UK). The solvents (CB and DIO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). PTB7-Th and PC71BM (1:1.5 by weight) were dissolved in a solvent mixture of CB:DIO (97%:3%) with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1. Before device fabrication, indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass and PEN substrates were washed with water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. First, a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, approximately 50 nm, Clevios P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO substrates and baked at 140 °C for 15 min in air to fully remove the remaining solvent. Then, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layers at 1000 rpm to form the bulk-heterojunction layers in a N2 filled glove box. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM layers were then annealed at 60 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the PC71BM layer (with thicknesses of 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 nm) and ITIC layer (with thicknesses of 0, 3, 5, 7, and 9 nm) were thermally evaporated on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layers at the rate of 0.5–1 Å s−1 using an evaporator. Finally, a 0.6 nm LiF and 100 nm Al cathode was evaporated on the active layers under a high vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the high-performance OSCs had a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PC71BM/LiF/Al, with the energy levels shown in Fig. 1(b). The effective device working area was 0.06 cm2, which was determined by a shadow mask.

2.2 Characterization
The surface morphologies were analyzed by tapping-mode AFM (Veeco, USA). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis; PerkinElmer Lambda 750, USA) absorption spectra were also obtained. Cross-sectional images were obtained using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, Japan) operated at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The XPS measurements were performed on a Thermo-VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromated Al (Kα) (1689.6 eV) X-ray source. Electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under open-circuit conditions using an SP-240 potentiostat (Bio-Logic, France) in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–2 MHz with an AC voltage of 10 mV. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs were measured at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 Sun, AM1.5). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (Solar Cell Scan 100, Zolix, China).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(c) shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the OSC with the 9 nm PC71BM layer and indicates a typical layer-by-layer structure. The thickness of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM layer was estimated to be approximately 100 nm, as indicated by the SEM image, which was similar to that reported previously.5,11,17–19 The molecular structures of PTB7-Th and PC71BM are shown in Fig. 1(d), indicating that sulfur (S) atoms only exist in the PTB7-Th molecules.
The J–V performances of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 2(a) with the device parameters and deviations summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S1, S2 (ESI†). The OSCs without the PC71BM (control) layer showed an average PCE of 8.59%, with Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.785 V, 16.7 mA cm−2, and 65.5%, respectively, which were similar to5,11,17,22–24 or higher than19,20,28 that of previously reported PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based OSCs with the same structure and indicate a well-optimized fabrication process. By evaporating a 3–9 nm PC71BM layer on the surface of the bulk-heterojunction layers, the PCE was gradually increased from 9.01% to 9.93% (on average). Further increasing the thickness of the PC71BM layer (to 12 nm) led to a decreased PCE of 9.16%, which might be attributed to the imbalanced ratio of donor and acceptor materials and high resistance of the thicker PC71BM layer.26 Thus, 9 nm was the optimal thickness of the PC71BM layer for boosting the performance of OSCs and showed the largest improvement (by 15.6%), with Voc, Jsc, and FF improving simultaneously. Fig. 2(b) shows the IPCE results of the OSCs. The integrated Jsc of OSCs without and with the 9 nm PC71BM layer from the IPCE spectra was 16.5 and 17.4 mA cm−2, respectively. The difference in the Jsc values obtained from the IPCE spectra and from the J–V measurements (average Jsc = 16.7 and 17.8 mA cm−2 for control and 9 nm PC71BM-based OSCs, respectively) was only 1.2%–2.2%, indicating the high accuracy and reliability of our experiment. Comparing to the maximum PCE of the control OSCs (PCE = 8.99%), the maximum PCE value of 10.25% was achieved with the 9 nm PC71BM layer, with a high Jsc of 18.0 mA cm−2, a high FF of 70.9%, and a Voc of 0.803 V, which is similar to the maximum PCEs achieved using other techniques for high-performance OSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layers.5,11,19–24 From Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†), the average PCE of the OSCs also improved to 9.47% (maximum PCE = 9.78%) using a 7 nm ITIC layer. The maximum improvement achieved by the ITIC layer was 5.4% lower than that achieved by the PC71BM layer, probably due to the inhomogeneous components of acceptors (PC71BM and ITIC) in the OSCs and lower electron mobility of ITIC.13 Thus, we concluded that the evaporation of PC71BM better improves the performance of OSCs than that of other non-fullerene acceptors such as ITIC.

To find the reason for the improved performance, we measured the surface morphologies of the pure PTB7-Th layer, PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer with the 9 nm PC71BM layer by AFM, as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c), respectively. The pure PTB7-Th layer showed a uniform surface with clear crystalline structures, which corresponded to PTB7-Th aggregates.20,28 The bright-colored rice-like particles and dark domains in Fig. 3(b) corresponded to the PTB7-Th and PC71BM phases, respectively.20,28 PTB7-Th could be clearly observed on the surface of the bulk-heterojunction layer. On adding the 9 nm PC71BM layer on the surface of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer, the crystalline structures of PTB7-Th disappeared, indicating a good surface coverage by PC71BM. Fig. 3(d)–(f) show the related contact angle results by dropping water onto the surfaces of PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk heterojunction, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk heterojunction with the 9 nm PC71BM layer. The contact angles of the pure PTB7-Th (Fig. 3(d)) and PC71BM (Fig. 3(f)) layers were 108° and 88°, respectively, while that of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer was 102°, which was closer to that of the pure PTB7-Th layer, indicating the presence of a PTB7-Th-rich surface on the bulk-heterojunction layer.23 Moreover, the larger contact angle of PTB7-Th indicated its lower surface energy than PC71BM.23 To minimize the surface energy of the system, PC71BM migrated to the bottom of the bulk-heterojunction layer, leaving excess PTB7-Th on the surface (Fig. 3(b) and 4(a)).23,29,30 Another possible reason for this phenomenon was the solubility of the employed solvents to PTB7-Th and PC71BM. In dry conditions (N2 atmosphere), during spin-coating and annealing, the solvent first evaporated at the top of the blend film and was retained on the substrate.23,25 Generally, PC71BM is more soluble in the CB/DIO solvent than PTB7-Th; thus, during the solidification of the bulk-heterojunction layer, PC71BM moved to a deeper solvent-rich region of the film.23,25 Owing to the vertical phase distribution, as shown in Fig. 4(a), a PTB7-Th-rich surface was formed with less PC71BM.23,24

To confirm the surface composition, we measured the XPS spectra for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layers without and with the 9 nm PC71BM layer, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The PTB7-Th:PC71BM composition near the top film surface could be estimated according to the atomic ratio of C (286 eV) and S (168 eV) because the S atom was the characteristic element of PTB7-Th (Fig. 1(d)).5,23 The C-to-S atomic ratio of the bulk-heterojunction layer could be calculated based on the integrated peak areas and sensitivity factors (0.11 for C 1s, 0.20 for S 2p). Then, the weight ratios of PC71BM to PTB7-Th were determined by the atomic ratios of C to S.23 For the control PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer, the PC71BM to PTB7-Th weight ratio was calculated to be 0.73:1, which was much lesser than the original ratio (1.5:1) in solution. However, for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer with the 9 nm PC71BM layer, the signal for S almost disappeared, indicating a pure PC71BM surface.23
Our XPS analysis was in good agreement with the AFM and contact angle results, indicating that the coverage of PC71BM was beneficial for the performance of OSCs. To better understand the mechanism, we show schematics of the three types of bulk-heterojunction layers in Fig. 5(a)–(c). Under light irradiation, electrons and holes were formed and separated at the interface of the donor and acceptor. The electrons were transferred through the acceptors to the cathode, and the holes were transferred through the donors to the anode.31,32 Calculations and morphology simulations indicated an ideal bulk-heterojunction morphology, as shown in Fig. 5(c). In this structure, the interface between the bulk-heterojunction layer and cathode should be acceptor materials, which was beneficial for electron transportation and prevents charge recombination.31,32 On the actual bulk-heterojunction layer (Fig. 5(a)), both donor and acceptor materials existed at the interface between the active layer and cathode, causing disordered alignment of energy levels (see Fig. 1(b)) and charge recombination.31,32 Moreover, for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based bulk-heterojunction layer, more PTB7-Th remained on the surface, resulting in a poor performance of OSCs. By supplying additional PC71BM to the surface, the PTB7-Th-rich surface was fully covered by acceptors, leading to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer to be closer to the ideal case (Fig. 5(c)).

The UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 6(a) indicated the enhanced light absorption of the active layers in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm with the addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer.19,23 As shown in Fig. 6(b), we tested the relation between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage. Here, Jph was determined by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities obtained under irradiation and darkness, respectively. The effective voltage was defined as V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 (i.e., JL = JD) and Va is the applied voltage. From Fig. 6(b), Jph saturated at a sufficiently high effective voltage (2.5–4.0 V). Assuming that all the photogenerated excitons were dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes afterward in the high-effective-voltage regions,19,33,34 the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) was only limited by the total number of absorbed incident photons. Gmax was calculated by Jsat = qGmaxL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layers. The Jsat values were obtained by asymptotic fitting of the Jph-effective voltage curves. By adding the 9 nm PC71BM layer, Jsat was increased from 178 to 199 A m−2, resulting in the Gmax improving from 1.38 × 10−26 to 1.54 × 10−26 m−3 s−1. The exciton dissociation probability could be calculated from the normalized photocurrent density (Jph/Jsat).19,33,34 The dissociation probability under short-circuit conditions increased from 95.1% to 95.9% on addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer, indicating the slightly improved dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers. From the Jph analysis, the increased Gmax and enhanced dissociation probability of the excitons were in good agreement with the improved Jsc and FF.19,33

We performed EIS measurements to investigate the electrical properties of the bulk heterojunctions and interfaces in the OSCs.17Fig. 7(a) shows the corresponding Nyquist plots for OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer without and with the 9 nm PC71BM layer. By fitting the Nyquist plots using the corresponding equivalent, the values of the series resistance (R1) and charge transfer resistance (R2) could be obtained. R1 was mainly derived from the electrical contact and sheet resistance of the electrodes, and R2 was caused by the charge transport resistance at the bulk heterojunction/electrode interface and/or inside the bulk-heterojunction layers.17 By addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer, R1 slightly decreased from 2.3 to 2.1 Ω cm2, whereas R2 dramatically reduced from 33.2 to 20.1 Ω cm2, indicating improved charge transportation.17,35 Because the OSCs had the same inner bulk-heterojunction layers, the improved charge transportation was only caused by the improved interface between the active layer and the cathode, i.e., where the 9 nm PC71BM layer was supplied. To confirm the charge transport property without and with the 9 nm PC71BM layer, we measured the electron mobility using the space charge limited current method.17,23 The details of the electron-only device and mobility calculations are shown in the ESI.† The J–V characteristics for the electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The calculated electron mobility improved from 1.79 × 10−3 to 3.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer. Thus, the 9 nm PC71BM layer more efficiently facilitated the electrons from the active layer to the cathode.23 The enhanced electron mobility indicated the improved electron transport property, which was in good agreement with the EIS analysis.17 Thus, the improved charge (electron) transport was another reason for the improved Jsc and FF.17,23

Fig. 7(b) shows the dark J–V characteristics of OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer without and with the 9 nm PC71BM layer. Other device parameters could be obtained by fitting the following equation:36–38 (1)where J0 is the reverse saturation current density, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The fitting results showed that J0 decreased from 1.48 × 10−7 to 6.52 × 10−8 mA cm−2 and n decreased from 1.61 to 1.56 upon the addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer. Because J0 and n are factors for the leakage current of carrier recombination and charge recombination of the space charge region,36–38 the decreased J0 and n values indicated the suppression of charge recombination due to the addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer, which was consistent with the working mechanism of bulk-heterojunction OSCs. The suppression of charge recombination further confirmed the enhanced Jsc and FF values.36–38 Under open-circuit conditions, eqn (1) could be simplified into the following Shockley equation:36–38 (2)Thus, the decreased J0 and n as well as the improved Jsc well explained the difference in Voc due to the addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer.36–38
In addition, we investigated the stability of OSCs without (control) and with the 9 additional PC71BM layer by storing them in air under a humidity of 40–50%. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows that after 7 days, the PCE degradation of the OSCs was 21% and 14% for the control and 9 nm PC71BM-based cases, respectively. This was possibly caused by the better protection of the bulk-heterojunction layer by the additional PC71BM layer. Without the additional PC71BM layer, the bulk-heterojunction layer was exposed to air, with PTB7-Th getting gradually degraded by O2 and moisture in air.39–41 However, by adding the 9 nm PC71BM layer, the bulk-heterojunction layer was well protected (see Fig. 4 and 5), thus improving the long-term stability of the OSCs.
Finally, we compared the J–V performance of flexible OSCs based on PEN substrates with the 9 nm PC71BM layer. As shown in Fig. 8, the active layer of the OSC with the 9 nm PC71BM layer (right) showed a slightly darker color than that of the control (left), confirming the addition of the PC71BM layer. As shown in Table 2, the control flexible OSC exhibited an average Voc of 0.778 V, a Jsc of 15.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 61.1%, yielding a PCE of 7.32%, which was 17.3% lower than that of the control rigid OSC (PCE = 8.59%). The degradation of Jsc and FF was possibly caused by the rougher plastic substrate and high series resistance of the flexible devices.42,43 Similar to rigid OSCs, the addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer improved the PCE of the flexible OSC to 8.31%, an enhancement of 13.5%. The highest PCE of the OSC with the 9 nm PC71BM layer was 8.52%, which was comparable to that of other high-performance flexible OSCs.44–46 Our results indicated that the addition of PC71BM on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layer is an effective method to improve the performance of both rigid and flexible OSCs.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we supplied an additional PC71BM or ITIC layer to the surface of PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based bulk-heterojunction layers by thermal evaporation. AFM, contact angle, and XPS measurements indicated the formation of PTB7-Th-rich and PC71BM-poor surfaces on the bulk-heterojunction layers, which were detrimental to the performance of OSCs. We found that using a 9 nm PC71BM layer led to greater improvement in the PCE of OSCs than using a non-fullerene acceptor layer such as an ITIC layer. The PCE of the rigid OSCs (on glass substrates) significantly improved from 8.99% to 10.25%, with simultaneous increases in Voc, Jsc, and FF. The impendence, electron mobility, and dark current analysis indicated the improved charge transport and suppressed charge recombination by the addition of the 9 nm PC71BM layer. The long-term stability also improved owing to the coverage of the additional PC71BM layer, which protected the underlying bulk-heterojunction layer. Furthermore, using this technique, the PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based flexible OSCs on PEN substrate improved from 7.65% to 8.52%. Our findings indicated that the addition of the PC71BM layer on the surface of PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction layers is a simple and effective method to improve the performance of both rigid and flexible OSCs.
