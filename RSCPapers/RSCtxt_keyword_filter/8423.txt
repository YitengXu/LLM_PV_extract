    , Accepted 17th July 2020First published on 20th July 2020AbstractSurface passivation is a critical factor for improving the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. However, more robust principle investigations are required to build effective passivation strategies enabling high-performance perovskite solar cells. Here, it is demonstrated that a non-reactive organic polymer induces band-bending at the perovskite surface through a passivation effect, furthermore suppressing Pb0 formation at the perovskite surface. Consequently, the photovoltaic performance and stability of the perovskite solar cells can be improved. The key findings show that the polymer passivation layer can control the Fermi-level at the perovskite surface, which changes the band structure at the perovskite surface and affects carrier dynamics by suppressing non-radiative pathways. Moreover, the organic polymer can prevent degradation of the perovskite surface. By using the passivating layer, the open circuit voltage improves from 1.046 to 1.100 V, the photoconversion efficiency exceeds 21%, and the stability of the perovskite solar cells is substantially improved. The organic polymer poly(bisphenol A anhydride-co-1,3-phenylenediamine) (PEIm) was used to control the perovskite band structure, and this passivation mechanism is revealed here.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have attracted significant attention in the past few years. Since the first reports,1–4 advanced properties of solar cells have been investigated extensively5–10 and device photoconversion efficiencies have reached over 25%.11,12 Such a development is due to the remarkable characteristics of halide perovskites including an easily tunable bandgap,13–15 long charge carrier diffusion length,16–19 and high absorption coefficient.20,21 These unique semiconductor characteristics allowed achieving photoconversion efficiency values approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit.22–24 However, further passivation strategies are necessary to progress beyond the current state-of-the-art photovoltaic performance.
Passivation materials in perovskite solar cells can be categorized into two main types: materials that are reactive and that are non-reactive with the perovskite layer. The reactive passivation materials react chemically with the perovskite material to change the crystal structure and composition. Reactive materials such as ammonium salts25–27 are reported, including phenylethylammonium iodide (PhEtNH3I)28 and n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB).29 For example, PhEtNH3I reacts with the perovskite layer near the interface, which changes the surface of the perovskite layer to a two-dimensional perovskite. This has the effect of improving the stability of the perovskite layer.28 On the other hand, non-reactive passivation materials do not vary the perovskite structure but coordinate with the iodine vacancy sites of the perovskite. There are reports of non-reactive materials such as poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC),30 poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV),31,32 poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PVP),33,34 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),35 poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)8 and choline chloride.36–38 In the case of these non-reactive materials, the effect of the passivation layer is still unclear. Thus, a more in-depth understanding of the passivation strategy is necessary to improve further the performance of perovskite solar cells. The non-reactive materials have also the possibility of strongly interacting with perovskite semiconductors.39–42 Such an interaction can be expected to affect the perovskite energy level to improve the photovoltaic performance. Since poly(bisphenol A anhydride-co-1,3-phenylenediamine) (PEIm) has partially negative charges caused by the polar carbon–oxygen bond in the imide functional group, it is expected to affect the carrier density on the perovskite and improve the photovoltaic properties. Furthermore, the durability of perovskite solar cells is expected to be enhanced upon covering the perovskite surface with PEIm.
Herein, we investigate the effect of passivation on the perovskite band energy levels and photovoltaic performance by using a non-reactive organic polymer. Furthermore, we reveal the detailed effects of surface conditions of the perovskite layer on the durability and properties of perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion
We propose a passivation strategy that influences the band structure by using the organic polymer poly(bisphenol A anhydride-co-1,3-phenylenediamine) (PEIm). Fig. 1a shows the chemical structure and Fig. 1b shows the presence of the passivation substance on the perovskite surface measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). PEIm was deposited on the perovskite layer using a 0.25 vol% concentrated solution. PEIm is a polymer consisting of benzene rings linked by a repeating sequence of phthalimide dimethylbenzyl ether (Fig. 1a). Functional groups such as phthalimides are expected to affect the energy band structure of the perovskite surface. To confirm the existence of PEIm on the perovskite surface (Fig. 1b), the O 1s peak was measured, with comparison of surfaces with and without PEIm. In the case of the sample with PEIm, the peaks at 531.8 and 533.4 eV were detected and identified as CO and C–O–C bonding attributed to PEIm, respectively.43 From this result, we detected the presence of PEIm on the perovskite surface.

To investigate the perovskite crystallinity with and without PEIm treatment, two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-WAXS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed. The PEIm concentration was 0.25 vol%. The 2D-WAXS patterns of perovskite layers with and without PEIm showed that both are reciprocal lattice mapping data, depicting a random crystallite orientation (Fig. S1†). Both perovskite layers present a cubic structure according to the azimuthally integrated intensity profiles of 2D-WAXS at 100, 110, 111, 200, and 210 reflections.44–46 The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the device with and without PEIm are shown in Fig. S2.† From the SEM images, it can be observed that the PEIm does not appear to affect the grain size of the perovskite (average 450 nm). While the PEIm was detected by XPS measurement (Fig. 1b), it seems to be too thin to confirm the accurate thickness by SEM. From these results, it was found that the PEIm does not change the grain size of the perovskite. Also, we confirmed that PEIm is a non-reactive material since it did not change the perovskite structure.
To verify the influence of the passivation layer on the perovskite layer, steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), PL decay, XPS, and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron (HAXPES)47–49 were performed (Fig. 2 and S3†). For the photoluminescence spectroscopy, the sample was structured as glass/perovskite/PEIm and compared to the sample without PEIm. The PEIm solution concentration was 0.25 vol%. From the steady-state PL spectra, the peak observed at 800 nm was associated with the emission coming from the perovskite layer (Fig. 2a). The PL intensity increased after applying PEIm on the perovskite layer. By increasing the PEIm concentration from 0.25 to 0.5 vol%, we confirmed a further increase of the PL intensity (Fig. S3†). Regarding PL decay measurement, τb increased from 517.3 to 686.3 ns (0.25 vol%) (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). By increasing the concentration of PEIm from 0.25 to 0.5 vol%, τb increased further to 713.2 ns. These results indicate the suppression of nonradiative pathways induced by the PEIm, which points to the presence of the passivation effect.26,33,34 To investigate the reason why the PL intensity was increased, perovskite surface and bulk energy levels were measured by XPS and HAXPES, respectively. From the XPS measurements (Fig. 2b), it was found that the Pb 4f peak at 136.6 eV, assigned to Pb0 at the perovskite surface, was suppressed by the PEIm treatment. Since Pb0 is related to the degradation of the perovskite layer, the PEIm passivation seems to play the role of a barrier for the perovskite surface.50–52 Moreover, the HAXPES result indicated the absence of Pb0 in the perovskite bulk (Fig. 2c), since the detection depth is around 35 nm.49,53 From these results, we conclude that the PEIm acts as a protection layer, which passivates the perovskite surface resulting in enhanced PL intensity.

To characterize the effect of the PEIm on the perovskite solar cells, the photovoltaic performance was measured as shown in Fig. 3. The photovoltaic performance with and without PEIm (Fig. 3a) and the open circuit voltage (VOC) distribution of more than 18 cells (Fig. 3b) were measured. With PEIm passivation, the VOC could reach 1.108 V, which was higher than that of devices without PEIm. Owing to the improvement of the VOC, the power conversion efficiency improved from 19.45% to 21.01% by using PEIm. Other photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S4 and S5.† The average VOC was improved to 1.100 V with PEIm (0.25 vol%) from 1.046 V without PEIm. The average fill factor (FF) increased from 0.749 to 0.780 by applying PEIm passivation. We confirmed that the most reproducible concentration was 0.5 vol%, which achieved a VOC of 1.095 V and a conversion efficiency of 19.76% on average (Fig. S5†). From these results, we can conclude that the passivation effect resulting from PEIm improved the VOC as well as the conversion efficiency.

To further investigate the origin of the passivation effect, an energy band level diagram was constructed using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and angle dependent hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron (AD-HAXPES) as shown in Fig. 4. ΔE is assigned to the difference between the Fermi-level and the valence band edge of the perovskite. From the UPS results for the PEIm layer (Fig. 4a), it can be observed that the valence band edge is lower than that of the perovskite, while the conduction band is higher than that of the perovskite (Fig. S6 and S7†). This result indicates that the PEIm could affect the carrier dynamics of the perovskite solar cells since the energy band structure is energetically close to the capping layer.54 Interestingly, the ΔE of the perovskite surface was shifted to the intrinsic-side upon applying PEIm, as observed from the AD-HAXPES measurement (Fig. 4b and S8†).47–49 By increasing the PEIm concentration from 0.25 to 0.5 vol%, the work function was slightly increased from −4.55 to −4.51 eV (Fig. S7 and S9†). From this result, we verified that the band structure did not change prominently between 0.25 and 0.5 vol%. And we found that in the case of the perovskite film with PEIm, there is a ΔE difference between the perovskite surface and bulk. This ΔE difference could be due to the interaction between the polymer and perovskite, which changes the electronic state around the perovskite surface. Consequently, such a ΔE difference can generate band-bending at the perovskite surface. Regarding the reason why PEIm has an effect on the band-bending, it may be due to the partially negative charges generated by the polar carbon–oxygen bond in the imide functional groups. Another reason may be the fixed charge density in the PEIm, which effects changes in the electrical density of the perovskite surface.55 J. Yang et al. reported that the carbonyl groups in the imide structure could chelate with noncoordinated Pb2+ to passivate the perovskite surface.56 Owing to this, PEIm may affect the carrier density at the perovskite surface and cause band-bending. This could also be the reason for the suppression of Pb0 at the perovskite surface. To investigate the interaction between PEIm and the perovskite, we performed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Fig. S10†). The perovskite sample showed CN bonding vibration from a formamidinium cation at 1712 cm−1 while PEIm showed CO bonding vibration at 1725 cm−1.57,58 Upon depositing PEIm on the perovskite, the peak of the CN bonding shifted from 1712 to 1709 cm−1. This shift can be due to the oxygen atoms of the polymer, which interact with the cation of the perovskite.31 These results suggest that the oxygen atoms of PEIm may interact with the CN bond of the perovskite cation.

ΔE is assigned to the difference between the Fermi-level and valence band edge. The PEIm concentration was 0.25 vol%. 
A schematic image of the band-bending concept is shown in Fig. 5. Note that band-bending is generally induced by local imbalanced space-charges inside a semiconductor,59 which generates an electric field leading to a gradient potential (Fig. 5a). The electric field strength was estimated on average to be 100.9 kV cm−1 (from 9 to 35 nm), which is 10 times higher than the gradient found in a typical silicon pn junction.60 This band-bending could influence the carrier dynamics at the semiconductor surface, which induces an electric field.39–42 Thus, the PEIm could serve as a passivation layer to increase the VOC and FF, which results in improving the photoconversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells compared to the cells without passivation (Fig. 5b). Due to these reasons, we concluded that the passivation material, which induces the band-bending, generates the gradient band structure in the perovskite layer, and this results in the improvement of the VOC.

Finally, we investigated the influence of PEIm on perovskite stability as shown in Fig. 6. For the stability tests, the sample was stored in the dark, in ambient air with 10% relative humidity between measurements. The photoconversion efficiency shows that the perovskite solar cell containing PEIm could almost maintain the efficiency for 1560 h, while devices without PEIm showed a drop of 0.46% from the initial efficiency (Fig. S11†). It is considered that the passivation layer improved the stability by suppressing Pb0 which is related to the degradation of the perovskite layer.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the passivation effect of using PEIm for high performance and stable perovskite solar cells and revealed the mechanism of the passivation. It was found that the non-reactive passivation material PEIm can induce band-bending by controlling the energy band of the perovskite surface. Such a band-bending can generate a gradient band structure and have a significant effect on the carrier dynamics by suppressing non-radiative pathways. Moreover, PEIm suppresses the formation of Pb0 at the perovskite surface. These results indicate that an improvement in the VOC from 1.046 to 1.100 V and a photoconversion efficiency exceeding 21% are achieved, and the stability of the perovskite solar cells improved substantially by the addition of PEIm to the device architecture.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(bisphenol A anhydride-co-1,3-phenylenediamine) (PEIm) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. To fabricate the perovskite layer, methylammonium bromide and formamidinium iodide were purchased from GreatCell Solar Ltd. Lead iodide and lead bromide were purchased from TCI Co. Ltd. Cesium iodide was obtained from abcr GmbH. An FTO glass substrate (TEC-9AX) was purchased from NSG Group. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Titanium oxide nanoparticles (PST30NRD) were purchased from GreatCell Solar. Tin chloride (IV) was purchased from Acros Organics. Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt and cobalt-complexes (FK209) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the purchased chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Device fabrication
After cleaning the FTO glass by sonication in ethanol and deionized water, a blocking titanium oxide (TiO2) layer was deposited on the FTO glass by spray pyrolysis deposition of a TiO2 precursor solution (1 mL of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 15 mL of ethanol) at 500 °C. Then, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was formed on the blocking TiO2 layer by spin-coating (5000 rpm, 30 s) a TiO2 nanoparticle solution (1 g in 11.8 g of ethanol), and annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. After that, a tin oxide (SnO2) layer was formed on the mesoporous TiO2 layer by spin-coating a precursor solution (0.1 M tin chloride (IV) in deionized water) and annealing at 190 °C for 1 h in air.61 After UV/O3 treatment, a perovskite layer was formed on the SnO2 layer. The perovskite solution was 1.3 M (CsPbI3)0.1(FAPbI3)0.875(MAPbBr3)0.125 dissolved in DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (volume ratio).53 The perovskite solution was spin-coated on the SnO2 layer (two-step program: 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s). The anti-solvent chlorobenzene was dropped onto the film surface 10 s before finishing the spin-coating recipe, followed by annealing the samples at 100 °C for 1 h to form the perovskite layer. Subsequently, PEIm was deposited on the perovskite layer by spin-coating (4000 rpm, 30 s) a solution of variable concentration (0.1–1 vol% diluted in chlorobenzene). Thereafter, spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transport layer was formed on the perovskite layer by spin-coating (4000 rpm, 30 s). To prepare the spiro-OMeTAD solution, 80 mg of spiro-OMeTAD was diluted in 1023 μL of chlorobenzene, followed by the addition of 32 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 19 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt solution (517 mg mL−1) in acetonitrile, and 14 μL of cobalt-complex solution (376 mg mL−1) in acetonitrile. To complete the device, an Au layer (70 nm) was evaporated on the hole-transport layer.
Characterization and measurements

I–V measurements were made using an Oriel VeraSol solar simulator (Newport Corporation) by using a calibrator LCE-50 (Centronics). The I–V measurement was performed from 1.2 to 0 V and from 0 to 1.2 V as reverse and forward scans, respectively, with a mask of 3 × 3 mm2. The scanning step and speed were 10 mV and 50 mV s−1, respectively. UV/Vis spectroscopy was carried out by using a Lambda 950S (PerkinElmer, Inc.). Photoluminescence emission spectra were measured by using an LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Inc.) and an excitation wavelength of 610 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed using a Fluorolog TCSPC with an excitation wavelength of 640 nm (HORIBA, Ltd.). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was carried out using a Spectrum Two (PerkinElmer Inc.). Morphology was measured using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SU8200, Hitachi high-tech. Co.). Two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-WAXS) patterns represented in reciprocal lattice space were obtained at SPring-8 at beamline BL19B2. The samples were irradiated with an X-ray energy of 12.39 keV (λ = 1 Å) at a fixed incident angle on the order of 6.0° through a Huber diffractometer.62 The 2D-WAXS patterns were measured with a two-dimensional image detector (Pilatus 300K). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) equipped with a He–I source (hν = 21.22 eV) (AXIS Nova, Kratos Analytical Ltd., UK) was performed for determining the valence band energy and Fermi level. The Fermi level of the samples was referred to that of Au which was in electrical contact with the sample in UPS measurements. Angle-dependent hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AD-HAXPES) at 7940 eV was performed using a Scienta R4000 system at the BL46XU beamline in SPring-8. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired using a spectrophotometer (VersaProbe II, Physical Electronics Inc.) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV), and the energy offset was calibrated using the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon as a reference at 284.8 eV. The spectrum was referenced using the C–C bond component of the adventitious carbon. The stability test was performed by keeping the samples in the dark without encapsulation at 10% relative humidity and 25 °C.
