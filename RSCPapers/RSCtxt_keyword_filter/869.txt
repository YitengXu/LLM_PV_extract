Here we report the first synthesis of mesoporous SnO2 single crystals (SnO2 MSCs) by a simple silica-templated hydrothermal method, and its application in solution-processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A relatively low efficiency (3.76%) was obtained due to the strong charge recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface. However, by coating a thin TiO2 barrier layer on SnO2via TiCl4 treatment, we were able to achieve an 8.54% power conversion efficiency (PCE). A dynamics study using impedance spectroscopy revealed a much lower transport resistance for the SnO2 MSC-based solar cells than for the TiO2 nanocrystal PSCs, but a stronger recombination. Significantly, the thin TiO2 coating layer on SnO2 considerably reduced the recombination while largely maintaining the superior electron-transport properties.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic hybrid organolead halide absorbers have developed dramatically and have become the most competitive candidate for use as third-generation photovoltaics.1 In recent years, PSCs have achieved over 15% power conversion efficiency (PCE), both in nanostructured sensitized solar cells and thin film solar cells.2,3 The general formula of perovskite is CH3NH3PbX3 (where X = halogen) and its structures generally have cuboctahedral and octahedral geometries.4–6 The advantages of these halide perovskites have already been shown by their interesting optical, electroluminescence, magnetic and other properties.7 Therefore, solar cells made from such halide perovskite absorbers hold the promise of advancing the field by being at the same time highly efficient and inexpensive.8
Electron collectors, i.e., acceptors, are widely used and necessary in the structure of PSCs. Mesoporous PSCs as well as thin film p–i–n heterojunction solar cells need a thin dense semiconductor oxide layer (mostly TiO2) as an electron acceptor to facilitate the injection of electrons into the conducting substrate, while inverted PSCs use PCBM as the top layer to attract electrons to the metal electrode.9–12 Therefore, an efficient electron collector would promote separation of excitons and furthermore improve the PCE. Recently, TiO2 mesoporous single crystals (MSCs) were used in PSCs as an electron collector due to their fast electron transport and high surface area.13,14 The MSCs should benefit the performance of solar cells both by providing high electron mobility and few bulk defects and impurities. Compared with TiO2, tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) MSCs appear to be an even better choice for PSC applications in many respects.15 First of all, SnO2 has a higher band gap (at 3.8 eV), which results in lower photocatalytic activity and higher device stability. Secondly, the charge mobility of SnO2 is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of TiO2,16,17 and even the trap density is lower, and the conduction band edge exhibits a 300 mV positive shift.18
Here, we for the first time synthesized mesoporous SnO2 MSCs by a simple silica-templated hydrothermal method, and further explored their use as the electron collector in PSCs deposited by a two-step CH3NH3PbI3 solution process. The strong recombination in the SnO2 MSC-based PSCs was found to limit the efficiency to less than 4.0% (highest efficiency ∼3.76%) due to the low photovoltage and photocurrent. After treating the SnO2 MSCs with TiCl4 to make a thin TiO2 layer, the cell efficiency was dramatically increased to as high as 8.54%, indeed much higher than the 7.20% record for TiO2 MSC-based PSCs.13 Through a dynamics study by impedance spectroscopy, we found that the SnO2 MSC-based PSCs present less transport resistance than do TiO2 nanocrystal-based PSCs, but charge recombination in the devices is stronger. Significantly, the device based on the TiO2-coated SnO2 (TiO2-SnO2) MSCs retained the transport properties of that based on the pristine SnO2 MSCs but with much less recombination.
The synthesis of SnO2 MSCs is an extension of our previous work on TiO2 MSCs.19 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1A and B both show the well-defined and homogeneously dispersed mesoporous nanorod-shaped SnO2 MSCs, with an average width of 150–200 nm and length of 500 nm–1 μm. With the assistance of the silica template, the mesopores with a diameter of ∼50 nm were obtained after removing the template, as shown in Fig. 1C. The Laue electron diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 1D indicated the single-crystal nature of SnO2 MSCs enclosed by dominant (110) facets. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1E) clearly showed the well-ordered SnO2 single crystals, whose outer d spacing was measured to be 0.33 nm and match well with the interplanar spacing of the (110) plane. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1F) established the phase of the SnO2 MSCs with a tetragonal structure and all of the conspicuous peaks matched well with the standard pattern in JCPDS No. 01-077-0447. After coating with TiO2, the MSCs still maintained the mesoporous nanorod structure but the surfaces were observed to be much rougher due to the coating of a 30–40 nm-thick layer of TiO2, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is clearly seen from the elemental mapping (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†) that the Ti was indeed distributed uniformly on the SnO2 MSC surface.

The deposited TiO2 thin surface layer was used to modify the chemical and electrical properties of SnO2 MSCs, with the aim of decreasing the recombination from SnO2 MSC to perovskite and further improving the PV efficiency of photon harvesting. For photoanode fabrication, we deposited both a SnO2 MSC layer and a TiO2–SnO2 MSC layer, each one about 300 nm thick, by spin-coating them onto separate fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, and annealing under 400 °C to increase the connectivity between the SnO2 MSCs. The TiO2–SnO2 MSC layer deposition was similar to the method of fabricating SnO2 dye-sensitized solar cells, where the SnO2 MSC films were treated in 50 mM TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows that the resulting TiO2 thin layer formed with a thickness of 30–40 nm and much rougher surfaces than did pristine SnO2 MSC, due to the 10 nm of TiO2 nanoparticles grown thereon. The elemental mapping analysis (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†) confirmed that the TiO2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the SnO2 MSC surfaces. In contrast to the TiO2 MSC-based PSCs, the SnO2 MSCs remove the need for the TiO2 compact layer, thus simplifying the device fabrication procedure. The CH3NH3PbI3 and spiro-OMeTAD layers were successively deposited onto both the SnO2 MSC and TiO2–SnO2 MSCs films (for details, see ESI† experimental section). The energy diagram and a cross-section image of a typical TiO2–SnO2 MSC-based PSC are shown in Fig. 2A and B. Here, the total thickness of the device was observed to be about 450–500 nm, including a 300 nm-thick SnO2 MSC layer, 100–150 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD layer and 50 nm-thick Au electrode.

The SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/hole-transport layer (HTL)/Au and TiO2–SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTL/Au devices were examined under a simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) solar irradiation and the active area of the electrode was set at 7 mm2. Their respective current–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3A, related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, the overall distributions of device performance parameters are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†), and the average performances of TiO2–SnO2 MSCs and SnO2 MSCs PSCs are tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). The TiO2–SnO2 MSC-based PSCs attained up to 8.54% PCE, with a short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) of 17.16 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.802 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.621, whereas the pristine (i.e., without TiCl4 treatment) SnO2 MSC-based device only presented a 3.76% PCE with a JSC of 10.94 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.546 V and FF of 0.633. The efficiency difference was mainly caused by the JSC and VOC. First, it can be seen that the open-circuit voltage of the TiO2–SnO2 MSC cells (VOC = 0.802) is higher than that of pristine SnO2 MSC cells (VOC = 0.546). This 0.256 V decrease could be explained by the conduction band edge of SnO2 being 300 mV more positive than that of TiO2. The VOC of TiO2–SnO2 MSC devices was improved greatly by the TiO2 modification, which shifted the electronic band to a more negative value and decreased the interfacial recombination. Then the photocurrent was also enhanced by the TiO2 treatment process: for the pristine SnO2 MSC device, JSC was measured to be only 10.94 mA cm−2, whereas the TiO2–SnO2 MSC device exhibited a JSC of 17.16 mA cm−2. The photocurrent difference could be explained by the strong recombination of the pristine SnO2 MSC device, and the details are discussed below. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in Fig. 3B show an onset of ∼800 nm, and appear to be dominated by CH3NH3PbI3 absorptions. The IPCE results agree well with the photocurrent from the J–V curves, and the value of integrated photocurrent from IPCE is similar to the JSC (Fig. S6, ESI†), validating the measurements. To check whether the notable PCE for our devices is reliable, we took the stabilized photocurrent at a photovoltage near the maximum power point of the optimal device and monitored it as a function of time. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), we obtained a steady-state PCE of 8.4% for the device based on the TiO2–SnO2 MSCs and 3.5% for that based on the SnO2 MSCs, thereby confirming the PCE values derived from the J–V curves. For comparison, a TiO2 nanocrystal-based device without the TiO2 dense layer but treated with TiCl4 was also prepared, and displayed an efficiency of 8.61%, which is quite similar to the efficiency of TiO2–SnO2 MSCs (Fig. S8, ESI†).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the interfacial charge transfer at the SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces.21 We measured the EIS spectra at an applied bias of VOC (0.546 V, 0.802 V and 0.882 V for SnO2 MSCs, TiO2–SnO2 MSCs, TiO2 nanocrystal based PSC, respectively) range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV under illumination of simulated solar AM1.5 global light at 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots derived from the results of EIS spectra of SnO2 MSC, TiO2–SnO2 MSC and TiO2 nanocrystal PSC films. The related parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). A simplified circuit model reported previously was used to fit these Nyquist curves (see the inset of Fig. 4).22 Here, two clear semicircles were observed, one in the high-frequency region and the other in the low-frequency region. The first arc at high frequencies corresponds to the charge-transport behavior of the whole device. Since all of the devices showed similar values of R1 (see Table S2, ESI†) and since these devices were designed to share the same structure, the transport properties also appeared to be similar. The low-frequency arc or the main arc is ascribed to the recombination resistance (R2) together with the chemical capacitance (C2). By using the above features, we fitted the Nyquist plots by the appropriate equivalent models in the inset of Fig. 4. This fitting clearly showed the order of the recombination resistance being R2(SnO2MSC) < R2(TiO2–SnO2MSC) < R2(TiO2nanocrystals), meaning that SnO2 MSCs showed stronger recombination than did the TiO2 MNC film. The coated TiO2 thin layer decreased the recombination rate, but to a level still higher than that of the TiO2 MNC film. This result explains why treatment with TiCl4 could cause a large increase in the VOC.

Conclusions
In summary, we have for the first time synthesized SnO2 MSC nanorods by a simple silica-templated growth method. We have also demonstrated the application of these SnO2 MSCs in perovskite solar cells. When treated with TiCl4, the SnO2 MSC-based PSCs attained a record 8.54% efficiency, which is higher than the efficiency values of all of the SnO2-based DSSCs as well as of the TiO2 MSC-based PSCs, demonstrating their potential to rival the mesoporous TiO2 PSCs. The EIS measurements further showed a very good electron-transport ability for the SnO2 mesoporous single crystals, which makes these crystals a most promising electron collector for PSCs.
