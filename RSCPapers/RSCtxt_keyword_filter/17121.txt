    , Accepted 6th September 2021First published on 7th September 2021AbstractLead halide based perovskite semiconductors self-assemble with distinct organic cations in natural multi-quantum-well structures. The emerging electronic properties of these two-dimensional (2D) materials can be controlled by the combination of the halide content and choice of chromophore in the organic layer. Understanding the photophysics of the perovskite semiconductor materials is critical for the optimization of stable and efficient optoelectronic devices. We use femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) to study the mechanism of energy transfer between the organic and inorganic layers in a series of three lead-based mixed-halide perovskites such as benzylammonium (BA), 1-naphthylmethylammonium (NMA), and 1-pyrenemethylammonium (PMA) cations in 2D-lead-based perovskite thin films under similar experimental conditions. After optical excitation of the 2D-confined exciton in the lead halide layer, ultrafast energy transfer is observed to organic singlet and triplet states of the incorporated chromophores. This is explained by an effective Dexter energy transfer, which operates via a correlated electron exchange between the donating 2D-confined exciton and the accepting chromophore under spin conservation.
Introduction
Perovskites are promising semiconductor materials for efficient solar cells (SCs) or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) because of their high quantum efficiencies, optical and electrical properties, tunability, and their low cost. Three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells showed outstanding progress in the power conversion efficiency from 3.8%1 to 25.2%2 within 11 years. To date, many researchers are trying to improve the properties of the two-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic perovskites with large size organic spacers as they are photochemically and structurally very stable because of the hydrophobicity of these organic layers compared with the 3D perovskites.3–7 Besides, for 2D perovskites, important optoelectronic applications8 like LEDs,9–11 transistors,12 solar cells, photodetectors, scintillators,13 phosphors,13 and photonic devices14 were demonstrated.
Lead halide perovskites consist of inorganic PbX6 octahedrons, where X is Cl, Br, or I. Depending on the choice of the organic cations, these PbX6 units crystallize isolated (0D), linearly arranged (1D), layered (2D), or connected in all directions (3D). This allows the control of the dimensionality of the inorganic semiconductor material.15–24 The chemical formula of 2D perovskites (see scheme in Fig. S1†) is known for more than 30 years as (R–CH2–NH3)2(A)n−1BX3n+1, where A and B are cations. R–CH2–NH3 is a primary aliphatic or an aromatic alkyl-ammonium group working as a spacer between the layers, X is a halide anion, and n refers to the number of metal halide octahedral layers.21
About 20 years ago, some groups started to use the organic cations in this material class not only to determine the structure of the inorganic semiconductor material but moreover to become the electronically active component. The introduction of large chromophores in 2D lead halides leads to effective low-dimensional energy transfer systems, including organic triplet states,25–28 organic singlet states26,27 and organic charge-transfer states (pyrene-TCNQ).29,30 By tuning the inorganic excitonic states to high transition energies in the (R–CH2–NH3)2PbCl4 system, efficient energy transfer between the inorganic layers (lead chloride) and organic layers (benzyl, naphthyl, anthryl) could be achieved.26 For benzyl and naphthyl chromophores, a strong coupling between the lead chloride excitonic band and the triplet state of the chromophore is monitored by a strong phosphorescence signal from the organic triplet state. This was interpreted by an efficient energy transfer process from the inorganic excitonic band to the triplet state of the organic layer via a Dexter energy transfer mechanism.26 Ema et al. reported for lead bromides that the energy transfer efficiency to the organic naphthyl triplet system decreases with increasing the alkyl chain length between the NH3 anchor group and the aromatic naphthyl system.31 Pyrene-based halide perovskites were also studied with different lead halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide) as a promising material for light-emitting applications and efficient energy transfer to the organic singlet and triplet system.27 2D perovskites were not applied in solar cell devices until Cao et al. could achieve 4.02% power conversion efficiency.32 Recently, efficiencies as high as 12.4% have been obtained by employing quasi-2D perovskites, which consist of alternating napthylmethylamine and formamidinium cations33 and even solar cells with naphthyl and anthryl groups were realized.34 Many studies have reported the possibility of tuning the excitonic band by halide replacement and the improved stability of these mixed halide (Cl, Br, and I) crystals due to their flexibility, which facilitates the fabrication of LEDs from blue to the green region.35–39 Those mixed halide perovskites are referred to as (R–CH2–NH3)2Pb(BrxI4−x) with the aromatic chromophore R. Here the parameter x determines the relative content of Br and I and for e.g. a ratio of Br:I of 0.7:0.3, this can also be written as (R–CH2–NH3)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4.
In this work, we present time-resolved spectral studies of different chromophores like benzylammonium (BA), 1-naphthylmethylammonium (NMA), and 1-pyrenemethylammonium (PMA) cations in 2D-lead based perovskite thin films using steady-state UV-Vis, steady-state PL spectroscopy, time-resolved emission, and ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. These experiments are performed on all investigated samples under similar experimental conditions to elucidate the energy transfer and relaxation pathways.
Experimental section
The one-step spin-coating method was applied to fabricate thin films of microcrystalline (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, and (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 on quartz glass substrates. We used mixed halide lead-based Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 for all samples to tune the excitonic transition energy of the inorganic part and visualize the influence of the different chromophores.
Preparation of the substrates
The 25.4 mm × 25.4 mm quartz substrates of 1 mm thickness were cleaned with soapy water and then washed with deionized water after ultrasonication for 45 min in a mixture of acetone and isopropyl alcohol (1:1). Afterwards, the glass was dried with a nitrogen blower. Before the spin coating, the substrates were subsequently exposed to O2 plasma for 15 min (Plasma cleaner Zepto, Diener electronic) to remove organic residues.
Preparation of perovskite precursors for the thin films
Firstly, benzylammonium bromide (C7H7NH3Br), was synthesized via the reaction of benzylamine (C7H9N, 3 mL, Alfa Aesar) with hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48% in water, ACROS ORGANICS) and stirred at 0 °C for 30 min. The C7H7NH3Br powder was washed three times with petroleum ether and dried in a vacuum pump for two days before use. Benzylammonium iodide (C7H7NH3I) was synthesized via the reaction of benzylamine (C7H9N, 3 mL, Alfa Aesar) with hydroiodic acid (HI, 55–58 mass% in water, Fluka) by the same process. (BA)2PbBr4 and (BA)2PbI4 precursor solutions (the concentration of solute was fixed at 0.3 M for all samples) were prepared in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, anhydrous, Aldrich, 1 mL). (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 solution was mixed from 0.7 ml of (BA)2PbBr4 and 0.3 ml of (BA)2PbI4. The solution was stirred at 50 °C for 1 day before use in the spin-coating process.
We have used the analogue procedure to prepare (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 (except that 1-naphthylmethylammonium bromide and 1-naphthylmethylammonium iodide powders were washed with diethyl ether). The procedure prepared the salts 1-pyrenemethylammonium bromide, and 1-pyrenemethylammonium iodide described elsewhere27 and in the ESI.†
Finally, transparent and homogeneous solutions of (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, and (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 without the formation of any precipitates were obtained. Using these solutions at 50 °C, spin-coating was carried out at 4000 rpm for 50 s. After the spin-coating, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. S1,† the SEM and XRD spectra of all samples exhibit high crystallinity of the films.
Optical measurements

Steady-state spectroscopy. 
Absorption spectra of the spin-coated films on a quartz substrate (thickness 1 mm) were recorded with the UV/Vis spectrophotometer SPECORD S600 (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected by an FP-8500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Groß-Umstadt, Germany). The excitation wavelength was 320 nm with a bandwidth of 5 nm. We additionally applied an UV band pass filter for 280–370 nm (UG11, Schott Glas) for the excitation path and a long pass filter of 360 nm (WG360, Schott Glas) for the emission path. The PMT voltage was set to 950 V. The wavelength-dependent instrument sensitivity and the baseline were corrected routinely.


Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). 
Nanosecond time-resolved emission measurements were performed using a TCSPC system (Fluo Time 100, PicoQuant) and counting card with 25 ps channel width. The thin films were excited using a sub-ns pulsed LED PLS320 at 325 nm, and the PL of the sample was detected using a photomultiplier detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant). The repetition rate of the pulsed LED was 107 Hz (time window of 100 ns). The Rayleigh scattered light on a pure quartz substrate was used to determine the temporal instrument response function (IRF) of the TCSPC system (full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼800 ps). This IRF was considered in the fitting of the transient traces. For all measurements, a long pass filter at 390 nm was inserted routinely to block stray light from the excitation source. Various detection wavelength ranges were selected using combinations of long pass and band pass filters.


Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements (fs-TAS). 
We used a home-built pump–probe setup40 for fs-TAS to investigate the ultrafast exciton dynamics, energy transfer, and recombination processes in the 2D perovskite systems. The pulsed laser system ran at a central wavelength of 775 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz (Clark-MXR, Dexter, MI, USA, pulse duration of 180 fs). Excitation pulses were applied with a central wavelength of 387 nm (after second harmonic generation of the laser fundamental). We adjusted the pump pulse energy to obtain an excitation density of 162 μJ cm−2 at the sample position. The probe white light covering a spectral range of 360–645 nm was generated by focusing a part of the laser fundamental onto a 5 mm thick calcium fluoride crystal. The white light was transmitted through the sample and subsequently detected via an HR320 spectrograph (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). The detection system is consisting of a signal processing chip (S8865-128) with 128 channel photodiode arrays (PDA), a C9118 driver circuit (Hamamatsu Photonics) and a data acquisition card that digitizes the analog PDA signals at 16 bits (National Instruments, NI6120). The sample was continuously moved in the plane perpendicular to the direction of probe pulse propagation. By varying the time delay between the excitation and the probe pulses via a stepping translational stage (delay line), we obtained a three-dimensional transient absorption profile (ΔOD vs. λ and t).41 All spectra presented here were chirp-corrected, and the instrumental resolution was ∼200 fs. The decay-associated spectra (DAS) resulted from the global lifetime analysis (GLA) discussed in detail elsewhere.42 All TA measurements were performed up to 1.5 ns delay time.

Results and discussion
The benzyl, naphthyl and pyrenyl chromophores, which are incorporated as an organic layer in the lead halide perovskite films, were chosen because the energetic position of their first excited singlet and triplet states allows for different scenarios of energy transfer. The fluorescence and phosphorescence of these chromophores cover transition wavelengths from the UV to the red spectral range. The halide mixture of Br and I in the ratio 0.7:0.3 shifts the transition wavelength of the 2D lead halide exciton to about 400 nm.
It is worth noting that a paper by Wu et al. reporting the triplet excimer formation with NMA cations has been recently published during the preparation of our manuscript.43 However, our study mainly focuses on the energy transfer mechanism between the inorganic and organic layers in 2D perovskite thin films.33
UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy of the thin film samples
Absorption spectroscopy is a unique tool for the estimation of optical bandgap and the nature of semiconductors, but also of allowed molecular transitions. The absorption spectra of thin semiconductor films show a sharp enhancement at wavelength regions larger than or close to the bandgap if the material is excitonic. As shown in (Fig. 1a–c), this excitonic absorption peak of the (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 film is observed at 402 nm (3.09 eV) with a red-shifted extinction tail due to scattering. The (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 film shows excitonic absorption at 417 nm (2.98 eV) with a weak broad red-shifted absorption plateau that extends until 570 nm, most likely due to trap states.44 The excitonic peak of (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 is found at 404 nm (3.07 eV) and has a weak red-shifted absorption at about 453 nm (2.74 eV), most likely due to trap states.44 The PL spectrum of (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 after excitation at 320 nm shows a spectrally narrow excitonic emission peak at 405 nm without spectral fine structure. This is the typical emission behaviour for the 2D exciton confined in the inorganic lead halide layer.26,27 The emission spectrum of the (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 after excitation at 320 nm film consists of two components: an excitonic peak at 440 nm is observed, which is slightly red-shifted to the excitonic absorption maximum of the film; also a structured emission with maxima at 570 and 617 nm is observed, that can be assigned to the phosphorescence of the naphthyl chromophore at room temperature.31,43 The PL spectrum of (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 excited at 320 nm shows a broad, fine structured emission with maxima at 403, 428, and 460 nm that extends until 600 nm. This can be assigned to the fluorescence of the pyrenyl chromophore in this film, as these emission characteristics are well-known for 1-substituted pyrene chromophores.40,45

Altogether the 2D perovskite samples with the selected three different organic chromophores show an absorption behaviour which is dominated by the lead halide based 2D confined exciton of the inorganic layer while the emission behaviour is either due to the 2D inorganic exciton or the organic triplet state or the organic singlet state, depending on the chosen organic chromophore.
Time-resolved fluorescence measurements
To investigate the mechanisms of energy relaxation pathways and lifetimes, PL decay measurements were performed using the TCSPC technique. TCSPC decay profiles of (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, and (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 thin films are shown in (Fig. S2†). It is evident from the figure that (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 has the longest lifetimes with two decay components of 0.98 ns and 17 ns, followed by (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 (0.60 ns) and (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 (0.61 ns) samples. The detailed parameters are summarized in Table S1.†
In BA perovskite, the lifetime of 0.61 ns represents the exciton relaxation in the inorganic layer. In NMA perovskite, the lifetime component monitored at the exciton peak (440 nm) represents the relaxation of the 2D exciton to the ground state and the triplet state of the naphthyl chromophore at room temperature, while the slower decay monitored at the naphthyl phosphorescence (wavelength > 530 nm) shows the decay of the organic triplet state.31 The PMA perovskite has two components. The fast component (0.98 ns) may represent different relaxation processes like singlet–singlet annihilation in the organic layer, while the slow component (17 ns) shows the lifetime of the pyrenyl singlet state.46 The observed average PL lifetimes (τavg) of NMA and PMA chromophores are close to the reported values of different groups.31,46
Transient absorption
By performing fs-TAS experiments, it is possible to monitor the dynamics of transiently created excited states, excitons or charge carriers. This provides insight into the mechanisms of exciton cooling processes, energy transfer or charge carrier transfer in these thin-film samples. The used approach is a pump–probe experiment, where the sample is excited by an ultrashort laser pulse.47–49 The ensuing non-equilibrium dynamics of the system can be detected via the transmission of delayed probe pulses. The samples were pumped at 387 nm, and the spectrally broad probe pulse revealed the changes in the absorption spectrum (ΔA) as a function of time. The samples were measured from the sample side at room temperature. The films were stable during the measurements, and repeated measurements at identical sample positions showed no difference in the magnitude of the recovery kinetics of the signals.
Ultrafast dynamics of (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4
In the BA-based perovskite, thin-film absorption and emission are dominated by the 2D Pb-mixed halide excitonic state. It is expected that energy transfer between the organic and inorganic layers is absent after excitation at 387 nm, as the excitonic lead halide state at 406 nm is lower in energy than both the singlet (at about 260 nm) and the triplet (at about 360 nm)26 excited state of the BA chromophore.
The wavelength and time-dependent TA map of BA perovskite thin film is shown in Fig. 2a. The ground state bleach GSB at 404 nm (3.09 eV) is close to the bandgap of the material. The excitonic band of the inorganic part is lower in energy than the singlet and the triplet states of the organic part, thus only the exciton dynamics from the inorganic layer is observed without any relaxation channels provided by singlet or triplet states of the organic cation.44

The absorption changes of the sample at 406 nm for different delay times are shown in Fig. 2b. The decay-associated spectra (DAS) resulting from the global lifetime analysis (GLA)42 are composed of two lifetimes (Fig. 2c). The dominant bleach signal due to the lead halide exciton is long-lived and decays with a time constant of 506 ps.
By comparing the TA spectra of different excitation power densities, a clear pump power dependence is observed. With increasing power (from 81 to 146 μJ cm−2) the exciton relaxation time decreases from 506 to 32 ps, respectively, and the amplitude of the fast component τ1 strongly increases (Fig. S3 and Table S2†). The excitation power-dependence is directly correlated to the exciton density in the sample. Therefore, the fast time constant τ1 is assigned to the exciton-exciton annihilation process (EEA), whereas the time constant τ2 is indicative for the relaxation of the 2D confined exciton to the ground state.
Ultrafast dynamics of (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4
In the NMA-based perovskite thin-film, the excitonic band (at 417 nm) is lower in energy than the singlet excited state (at 290 nm) though it is higher in energy than the triplet excited state (at 470 nm) of the NMA chromophore.26 In this case, a strong coupling between the layers leads to an energy transfer from the excitonic lead halide band to the organic triplet state.31 The wavelength and time-dependent TA map are shown in Fig. 3a. In the transient absorption spectra of the NMA perovskite, the peak position of the negative signal (blue signal) at about 420 nm is in good agreement with the excitonic peak in the absorption spectrum (Fig. 1b). Thus it can be assigned to the state filling signal contributed by both band-edge electrons and holes of the lead halide exciton. The positive feature around 440 nm, which appears around 0.5 ps after the optical excitation pulse (see Fig. 3b and d), might be due to the naphthalene monomer triplet–triplet absorption.43,50,51 The broad positive peak (red signal) around 600 nm is assigned to triplet–triplet absorption of the intramolecular triplet excimer of NMA,33,43,51 which forms due to the high density of naphthalene chromophores in the organic layer.

(c) Kinetic traces at 419 and 600 nm. (d) Decay associated spectra (DAS) from kinetic fitting with three time constants and slow component that does not decay (Inf). 
The changes in the absorption spectrum of the sample at different delay times are shown in Fig. 3b. The respective recombination kinetics probed at 419 and 600 nm were plotted in Fig. 3c. The (DAS) is composed of three lifetimes and a long-lived component (inf) (Fig. 3d). It worth noting that the dominant bleach signal due to the lead halide exciton at 417 nm decays fast with τ1 of 0.26 ps, τ2 of 9.7 ps and τ3 of 670 ps. This result is in agreement with the Ema work.31
By comparing the TA spectra at different excitation power densities (Fig. S4 and Table S3†), it is observed that exciton relaxation times become faster, and the respective amplitudes become larger with increasing pump power. Further, by increasing the power from 81 to 162 μJ cm−2, the exciton relaxation time decreases. Thus, the fast time constants τ1 (0.26 ps) and τ2 (9.7 ps) have strong contributions to the exciton-exciton annihilation process. The DAS of the time constant τ1 also shows a negative amplitude in a spectrally broad range between 450 to 600 nm, and the DAS of the time constant τ2 has a negative component at 430 nm, which both is indicative for the rise of triplet–triplet absorption signals of the naphthalene chromophore (Fig. 3d). Therefore, the energy transfer to the organic naphthalene layer is observed in this ultrafast time range. The transient absorption spectrum at the longest experimental delay time is identical with the DAS of the infinity decay component τ4. This long-lived signal consists of a negative signal at 420 nm (bleach of lead halide based exciton signal) and positive signals at 435 nm (triplet–triplet absorption of naphthalene chromophore52 and at 600 nm (triplet–triplet absorption of naphthalene excimer.52
Ultrafast dynamics of (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4
In the PMA-based perovskite, the excitonic band is higher in energy than the singlet and triplet excited states of the chromophore.46,53 The wavelength and time-dependent TA map of PMA perovskite thin film is shown in Fig. 4a. The peak position of the negative signal (blue signal) at 418 nm is in good agreement with the excitonic absorption peak in the steady-state spectrum (Fig. 1c). This can be assigned to the state filling signal contributed by both band-edge electrons and holes. The spectrally broad positive feature in the visible range with a maximum around 575 nm can be assigned to excited singlet state absorption of the PMA chromophore.40,54 The excited-state absorption appears within about 0.4 ps and does not decay until 1 ns, suggesting a long-lived singlet state. This is in line with the observed long-lived fluorescence decay (biexponential decay with 0.98 ns and 17.1 ns) as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S4.†

(c) Kinetic traces at 420 and 584 nm. (d) Decay associated spectra (DAS) from kinetic fitting with three time constants and slow component that does not decay (Inf). 
The absorption changes of the sample at different delay times are shown in Fig. 4b, and kinetics at selected probe wavelengths (420 nm, 473 nm and 584 nm) are plotted in Fig. 4c. The DAS is composed of three lifetimes and a long-lived component (inf) (Fig. 4d). The dominant bleach signal due to the lead halide exciton probed at 420 nm decays fast with two time constants (τ1 = 0.2 ps and τ2 = 8.6 ps).
The comparison of the TA spectra at different excitation power densities shows that carrier relaxation times become faster with increasing power (Fig. S5 and Table S4†). By increasing the power density from 81 to 146 μJ cm−2, the carrier relaxation time τ1 of 0.36 ps decreases to 0.2 ps and the decay time τ2 of 14 ps decreases to 8.6 ps. Moreover, the respective amplitudes of the fast components τ1 and τ2 are strongly increased. Thus these time constants are assigned to the exciton–exciton annihilation process. The DAS for all decay times lacks a negative amplitude between 450 and 620 nm, which was assigned to the ESA signal of the pyrene singlet state. Thus the energy transfer process from the lead halide based exciton to the organic pyrene layer occurs ultrafast beyond our experimental time resolution. The long-lived excited singlet state of the pyrene chromophore is also seen in the DAS of the time constant τ3 and the infinity time constant τ4.
Differences between (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 and (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 thin films
(NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 triplet state and (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 singlet state both are lower in energy than the inorganic lead halide exciton band, yet the transient data monitoring the energy transfer processes exhibit different results. For the NMA chromophore, an ultrafast population time of 0.26 ps could be resolved (negative amplitude of the respective DAS in the visible range between 450 and 600 nm). On the other hand, a similarly negative amplitude in the DAS of the PMA perovskite is not resolved. Instead, the transient absorption spectrum, which is characteristic for the pyrene singlet state is observed directly after optical excitation and remains to the nanosecond time regime. Therefore, the energy transfer from the lead halide exciton to the organic singlet state occurred faster than the time-resolution of our experiment (about 200 fs). For the PMA chromophore absorption, the negligible spectral overlap with the lead halide excitonic emission spectrum does not support the FRET process as a possible transfer mechanism. FRET is excluded as an explanation also for the energy transfer for the NMA chromophore as the accepting triplet state would be optically forbidden. Instead for both chromophores, a Dexter-type mechanism seems to be more reasonable. This was also discussed before by several research groups on comparable systems26,33,55 and especially the work of Ema et al.,31 where the energy transfer in dependence of the distance between the chromophore and lead halide layer was studied in detail. Therefore, a correlated two-fold charge transfer (electron and hole) from the lead halide exciton to the organic acceptor chromophore explains the observed ultrafast transfer time. The short methyl spacer between the organic chromophore and the ammonium anchor group to the halide allows for the necessary contact interaction between the 2D exciton in the inorganic layer and the organic chromophores. A recent theoretical study for the perovskite system (R–CH2–NH3)2(A)n−1BX3n+1 investigated the excitonic interaction of lead halide layers separated by organic spacer layers with respect to exciton delocalization.56 Especially for the case of single lead halide layers (n = 1) a very strong delocalization of electron and hole density was calculated, which results in Dexter-type energy transfer processes in the range of a few to tens of femtoseconds. This exciton delocalization effect also enables efficient energy transfer to suitable organic chromophores by this mechanism in the same time-range. Because the Dexter mechanism conserves the spin state, the ultrafast transfer to singlet and triplet states is feasible.
Besides the ultrafast energy transfer dynamics, as summarized in Fig. 5, an excitation density dependent decay is observed for all investigated samples. The samples showed exciton–exciton annihilation in the sub-ps and few-ps range for both chromophores t, which is effective due to the reduced dimensionality of the crystalline structure. These exciton–exciton annihilation processes are non-exponential by nature, which is reflected by the approximated parametrization via multi-exponential fit models as seen in the respective DAS57–59 (Fig. 3 and 4).

Conclusions
A series of three lead-based mixed-halide perovskites containing BA, NMA, and PMA thin films have been fabricated to study the ultrafast dynamics of energy transfer from the inorganic to the organic layer. The choice of the organic chromophores facilitates the relative energetic alignment of the 2D confined exciton in the lead halide layer with respect to the singlet and triplet states of the organic layer. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy on (BA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, (NMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4, and (PMA)2Pb(Br0.7I0.3)4 nanocrystalline thin films in the visible spectral region showed the ultrafast Dexter-type energy transfer path to the organic singlet/triplet states. The presented spectral studies help to understand the interaction of large chromophores with perovskite structures and how it can be optimized for different optoelectronic devices, where the recent interest in 2D and 3D perovskite systems is combined with often complementary demands for the optimization in different applications ranging from LEDs (high emission quantum yield) to solar cells (high charge separation efficiency). The implementation of large organic chromophores with well-defined spacers between the lead halide layer and the organic pi-electron system enables more flexibility in the design of those devices.
