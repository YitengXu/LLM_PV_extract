Broader context
Lead-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as one of the most promising candidates for new generation photovoltaic devices, have achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.5%. However, the presence of lead in perovskites hampers the market prospect of these solar cells. Sn perovskites with narrow band gaps and high carrier mobilities are thus by far the most promising alternatives. The main structures of lead-free Sn-based PSCs can be divided into regular and inverted structures. Inverted Sn-based PSCs show a number of advantages including their simple fabrication, low cost, and negligible hysteresis behavior. Here, recent developments and future perspectives regarding inverted Sn-based PSCs are reviewed. In particular, this review focuses mainly on the features and interfaces of inverted Sn-based PSCs, properties of Sn perovskites, and fabrication of a high quality Sn perovskite active layer, highlighting the obstacles to further progress and opportunities for future work. Finally, we propose the challenges and prospects in further development of inverted Sn-based PSCs.

1. Introduction
Being one of the most promising materials for solar cells, metal halide perovskite semiconductors have attracted great interest since 2009.1 The efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased from 3.8% to 25.5% over the past 12 years, which is comparable with the advances achieved for silicon and thin-film solar cells.1–20 Typical lead perovskites, such as MAPbI3, FAPbI3, and mixed-cation perovskite materials, have been used to fabricate high-performance solar devices.21 However, the toxicity issue of Pb hinders the wider applicability of Pb-based PSCs. Therefore, it is crucial to pave a new path to reduce or eliminate Pb from PSCs and replace it with other environmentally-friendly elements.22–27
To select suitable metal elements for replacing Pb, it is crucial to determine whether the potential candidates can form a perovskite crystal structure. Typical metal hybrid perovskites exhibit an ABX3 structure, where A is a univalent organic or inorganic cation, B is a coordinate bivalent metal ion, and X is either Cl−, Br−, or I−. To form a stable perovskite structure, A, B, and X ions must have suitable ionic radii defined by the tolerance factor  where rA, rB, and rX are the corresponding ionic radii. The ideal t value should be in the range from 0.813 to 1.107;28,29 otherwise the cubic or cubic-like crystal structure would be warped, distorted, and eventually destroyed. ABX3 perovskites provide excellent opto-electronic properties, thus making these materials a popular choice in solar devices. Only a limited number of metals could replace the Pb content in the synthesis of metal hybrid perovskites, such as Sn, Ge, Sb, Bi, and Cu.30–35 Among these materials, Sn perovskites have shown the greatest potential over the past five years. Compared with lead perovskites, Sn perovskites exhibit superior optical and electronic properties, such as higher charge mobilities and narrower optical band gaps (∼1.3 eV).36,37 Therefore, Sn perovskites could generate a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc), approaching the theoretical efficiency limit (Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells) of ∼33%.38 More importantly, Sn perovskites with low toxicity can degrade to environmentally-friendly SnO2 after exposure to air.25,39 Therefore, Sn perovskites are very promising for the fabrication of high-performance lead-free PSCs.
Snaith and co-workers first used MASnI3 as the light absorber for perovskite solar cells in 2014, achieving a very promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.4% in a mesoporous structure.30 This has attracted considerable attention towards the Sn perovskites, and numerous efforts have been dedicated to obtaining high-performance Sn-based PSCs.40–42 Planar p–i–n Sn-based PSCs have gradually attracted growing interest owing to their simple fabrication, low cost, and negligible hysteresis behavior.40,43 Wang et al. first reported p–i–n PSCs based on CsSnI3, achieving a PCE of 3.31%.44 Very recently, Liu et al. demonstrated that the introduction of phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) can improve the illumination stability of FASnIBr2, resulting in a record certified PCE of 12.4% for p–i–n Sn-based PSCs (a PCE of 13.4% in the laboratory).45 Although numerous research efforts have been devoted to inverted Sn-based PSCs, the PCE of these PSCs is still much lower than that of Pb-based PSCs. Furthermore, Sn perovskites are highly instable after exposure to air due to the fact that Sn2+ can be easily oxidized to Sn4+.37 Therefore, their stability issue remains a big challenge. Many efforts have been made to obtain stable Sn-based PSCs. For example, Liao et al. found that the stability of inverted FASnI3-based PSCs is significantly improved after encapsulation, retaining 85% of their initial PCE for one month in a glove box.40 Liu et al. demonstrated that the PHCl reductive additive improves the illumination stability of inverted Sn-based PSCs, maintaining 82% of the original PCE for 330 h in a glove box.45 Wang et al. fabricated Sn-based PSCs by introducing a gallic acid additive, which can maintain 80% of their initial PCE for 1000 h in air; this represents the best air stability for inverted Sn-based PSCs reported to date.46
The rapid development of inverted Sn-based PSCs prompted us to review the current progress of inverted p–i–n Sn-based PSCs, focusing mainly on the aspects involving the fabrication of a high quality Sn perovskite layer and charge transport layers for p–i–n Sn-based PSCs. The aim of this work is to provide a detailed review of the current developments in this area on the following topics: (i) features and charge transport layers of planar p–i–n Sn-based PSCs; (ii) properties of tin perovskites; (iii) constructing high quality Sn perovskite active layers; (iv) stability of inverted Sn-based PSCs; and (v) challenges of p–i–n Sn-based PSCs and possible directions of future research.
2. Features and charge transport layers of planar p–i–n Sn-based PSCs
The structures of Sn-based PSCs can be divided into three categories: mesoporous, regular (n–i–p), and planar p–i–n (inverted) structures (Fig. 1). Traditional Sn-based PSCs with a mesoporous structure originated from mesoporous dye-sensitized solar cells (Fig. 1a).30,31 The mesoporous scaffolds were used to collect the generated charges from the perovskite layer. Later, it was noted that PSCs without the mesoporous scaffold still show excellent performances. Indeed, it was found that these perovskites can form a dense active layer and provide a planar heterojunction structure, which can be divided into n–i–p (regular) and p–i–n (inverted) structures (Fig. 1b and c). For the regular structure, a 300–500 nm thick perovskite absorber layer was used to acquire a long enough diffusion length for suppressing charge recombination.47 However, Sn-based PSCs based on mesoporous and regular structures show high hysteresis and relatively low PCEs (normally lower than 8%).25,48,49 In contrast, planar p–i–n PSCs enable negligible hysteresis along with a competitive PCE of over 13%. In addition, the fabrication processes of p–i–n Sn-based PSCs are facile and cost-effective and most recent advances in highly efficient and stable Sn-based PSCs were achieved in the inverted structure. Therefore, we focus on inverted Sn-based PSCs.

2.1 Features of p–i–n Sn-based PSCs
Sn perovskites doped with SnF2 have shorter diffusion lengths (∼500 nm) compared with Pb perovskites (∼1 μm).50 Therefore, planar structures can also be applied in Sn-based PSCs. Regular n–i–p Sn-based PSCs using compact TiO2 or SnO2 films as the electron transport layer (ETL) exhibit a higher hysteresis induced by ion migration in the perovskite layer. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a reliable PCE for the regular devices.48,49 By contrast, planar p–i–n PSCs, using fullerene as the ETL, exhibit negligible hysteresis.51,52 This reduced hysteresis might be due to the fact that fullerenes can passivate the trap states and efficiently extract the electrons, thereby limiting charge accumulation and eliminating the hysteresis.53–55 In addition, the fabrication processes of p–i–n Sn-based PSCs are relatively simple and cost-effective. For inverted PSCs, the p-type hole transport layer (HTL) is fabricated before the formation of Sn perovskites and the n-type ETL was deposited after annealing of perovskites (Fig. 1c). Thus, Sn perovskites are sandwiched between the HTL and ETL as the light absorber. Therefore, p–i–n Sn-based PSCs with the desired features of low-temperature fabrication, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and suppressed hysteresis behavior are highly attractive.
Inverted Sn-based PSCs were reported for the first time by Wang and co-workers in 2016. In this work, NiOx was used as the HTL, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was employed as the ETL, and CsSnI3 in between the two layers was used as the light absorber (Fig. 2a–c). A PCE of 3.31% was obtained for this inverted Sn-based PSC.44 Then it was reported that the concept of the p–i–n structure could be applied to PSCs based on the fact that Sn perovskites can act as both the hole conductor and light absorber.25,56 Since the first report of inverted Sn-based PSCs, many investigations have been conducted to meticulously study the HTL, ETL, and Sn perovskites for the fabrication of high-performance p–i–n Sn-based PSCs.45,57–61 For example, in 2016 Yan and co-workers reported efficient FASnI3 PSCs with a notable PCE of 6.22%. The authors fabricated these PSCs via the solvent-engineering method to obtain a full-coverage, uniform, and high quality FASnI3 film, thus promoting the development of p–i–n Sn-based PSCs in the subsequent few years.40 Zhao et al. for the first time used a three-dimensional (3D) mixed-cation Sn perovskite absorber (FA0.75MA0.25SnI3) to fabricate highly efficient inverted lead-free PSCs, which exhibited a maximum PCE value of 8.12%.58 Subsequently, Huang et al. also fabricated high performance reproducible inverted PSCs via the solvent-engineering method, obtaining an average PCE of 8.26% ± 0.38%.62 Diau and co-workers incorporated guanidine diiodide (GAI) into the FASnI3 crystal structure with the ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) additive, attaining an excellent PCE of 9.6%.63 In 2019, Kamarudin and co-workers introduced a post-treatment method for the Sn perovskite using a bidentate amine and ethane-1,2-diamine (edamine) to passivate the surface defects and increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc), leading to a PCE of up to 10.18%.64 Additionally, low-dimensional Sn perovskite absorbers have gained great attention in the fabrication of inverted PSCs for enhanced device performance and air stability. Liao et al. used a two-dimensional (2D) PEA2FA8Sn9I28 film as the light absorber in inverted PSCs, achieving a PCE of 5.94%.65 Ning et al. found that indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) can be used to achieve an unprecedentedly high voltage of 0.94 V with a record PCE of 12.4% for low-dimensional Sn-based PSCs.41 The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, energy level diagram, and device performance of Sn-based PSCs are shown in Fig. 2d–f.

2.2 Charge transport layers in p–i–n Sn-based PSCs
In inverted Sn-based PSCs, charge extraction and transport occur at the interfaces. Furthermore, charge recombination takes place also at the interfaces due to interfacial defects and specific charge distributions.66 Thus, the charge transport layers, including HTLs and ETLs, play a key role in enhancing both the efficiency and stability of Sn-based PSCs.67,68

2.2.1 Hole transport layer. 
In p–i–n inverted Sn-based PSCs, the mismatched energy level between indium tin oxide (ITO, ∼−4.6 eV) and FASnI3 (∼−5.6 eV) limits the efficient collection of holes and photovoltage output.40 To solve this issue, an HTL is often introduced between the Sn perovskite layer and ITO anode in inverted PSCs. The HTL should meet the following requirements: (a) high hole mobility for effective hole transport from the perovskite to the anode; (b) matching of the energy levels between the HTL and Sn perovskite layer; (c) high transmittance and low absorption in the photoresponse wavelength range of the Sn perovskites; and (d) solution processability for the future mass production of Sn-based PSCs.
Owing to its high conductivity, good morphology, and low-temperature solution processing, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) material is usually used as the HTL for high performance inverted Sn-based PSCs.40,63 However, several drawbacks hinder it from becoming an ideal HTL. Firstly, the acidic nature of the PEDOT:PSS solution arising from the anionic PSS dispersant will corrode the ITO electrode and perovskite. Secondly, the PSS dispersant in the PEDOT:PSS is hygroscopic, which may induce a potential instability for Sn-based PSCs.12,69 Thirdly, the mismatched energy levels between PEDOT:PSS (∼−4.9 to −5.2 eV) and FASnI3 limit the Voc value in p–i–n Sn-based PSCs. Modifications of PEDOT:PSS have been widely studied in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaic cells.70 The strategy exploiting PEDOT:PSS modifications was also explored in inverted Sn-based PSCs. For example, Han et al. doped PEDOT:PSS with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to reduce the mismatch in energy levels between FASnI3 and PEDOT:PSS, thus leading to an increase in PCE from 2.01% to 5.02%.71
Other p-type semiconductors have been developed for use as the HTL of inverted Sn-based PSCs owing to their tunable energy levels and chemical structures, molecular packing, band gap, and chemical stability.44,72–75 NiOx is the most popular hole transport material used in PSCs. Wang et al. for the first time constructed the HTL by employing simple solution-processed NiOx.44 Yan et al. reported the fabrication of FASnI3 solar cells using NiOx nanoparticles as the HTL for enhanced air-stability and Voc values. It was shown that these devices can achieve a PCE of 6.76% with a Jsc of 17.64 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.55 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70.72 Besides NiOx, other inorganic metal oxides such as MoO3 have also been used in Sn-based PSCs. Lunt et al. used MoO3 as the HTL for all CsSnBr3 PSCs but obtained a PCE lower than 1%.73 In addition to p-type metal oxides, CuI has also been utilized as the HTL for inverted Sn-based PSCs. Hatton et al. fabricated CsSnI3 PSCs with a high Voc using CuI, obtaining a PCE of 2.76% with a superior Voc of 0.55 V.74 Owing to its high hole mobility and good energy alignment with FASnI3, Yan et al. introduced CuSCN as the HTL in inverted Sn-based PSCs, obtaining a PCE of up to 7.3%.75 Furthermore, other p-type semiconductors utilized in Pb-based PSCs, such as CuOx, VOx, and graphene oxide, might be good hole transport materials for inverted Sn-based PSCs.76–82


2.2.2 Electron transport layer. 
In inverted Sn-based PSCs, the ETL is deposited directly onto the Sn perovskite film. N-Type materials for inverted Sn-based PSCs are often chosen from the field of organic photovoltaic cells. However, owing to the unique properties of Sn perovskites, the choice of the ETL is very critical. The ideal ETL should exhibit two crucial characteristics, namely a high electron mobility and hole-blocking property as well as complete coverage of the Sn perovskite layer. Indeed, a direct contact between the metal cathode and the perovskite layer would lead to current leakage. Obtaining complete coverage of the ETL could also contribute to preventing a potential reaction between the cathode (Ag or Al) and the perovskite film. Furthermore, the ETL deposition process is extremely critical and should not destroy the Sn perovskite film. Sn perovskites are very sensitive to some alcohols and water, and thus several n-type materials that are only soluble in methanol or water are not suitable to be used. Another important requirement is that the ETL should not undergo any potential reaction with the Sn perovskite. For example, iodides or amines may be generated in the perovskite layer under working conditions, leading to a decrease in PCE.
For a long time, the most popular electron transport materials in inverted Sn-based PSCs have been C60 and some C60 derivatives such as PCBM. Guo et al. reported that C60 and fullerene derivatives could contribute to charge separation and result in superior performance of PSCs.83 Thereafter, PCBM and C60 have been widely utilized in inverted PSCs. In fullerene-based ETLs, additional functional films are often deposited onto the fullerene layer to form multilayer ETLs. These additional films should meet the following criteria: blocking holes, passivating the trap states in the perovskite, and reducing the energy barrier between the cathode and the ETL.
Huang et al. first used PCBM/C60 double layers as the ETL to passivate the trap states in PSCs.54 Although both C60 and PCBM could passivate the trap states, their passivation effects were found to be complementary. C60 could passivate the trap states with energies deeper than 0.5 eV, while PCBM was shown to have a weaker passivation effect on the trap states with energies between 0.4 and 0.5 eV. Such complementary passivation effects are beneficial in reducing the hysteresis effect and improving the FF. Jen et al. reported a correlation between the charge transport properties of the ETL and the device performance.56 Zhang et al. proved that C60 can improve the efficiency with a reduced hysteresis, while PCBM can enhance the stability in a N2 environment.84 Bathocuproine (BCP) and LiF have also been used to form multilayer ETLs with fullerenes to block holes.85 BCP and LiF with a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level could contribute to the reduction of charge recombination at the ETL. Recently, ICBA with a suitable energy level was used as a novel ETL for inverted Sn-based PSCs, leading to a maximum Voc of 0.94 V.41 The energy levels for the most commonly used materials in inverted Sn-based PSCs are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram of the reported energy levels of typical materials used in inverted Sn-based PSCs (in eV).11,12,22,25,41,44,86 
In the above, we have given a brief discussion on the features of inverted Sn-based PSCs and reviewed the progress of their charge transport layers. To further improve Voc, it is necessary to optimize the interface properties between charge transport layers and Sn perovskites. Also, there is an urgent need to develop and apply charge transport layers that can specifically match the energy level of Sn perovskites with low interface trap states in inverted Sn-based PSCs.

3. Properties of Sn perovskites
Sn has a chemical similarity to its adjacent elements (Ge and Pb). Sn has two oxidation states (Sn2+ and Sn4+), and Sn2+ is slightly unstable and can easily oxidize to Sn4+. Therefore, Sn perovskites may exhibit higher conductivity and mobility due to the self-doping behavior resulting from the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, thus generating a higher dark carrier density.37 The properties of Sn perovskites can also affect the performance of inverted Sn-PSCs and should thus be thoroughly studied. Typical Sn perovskites exhibit the ABX3 structure. Materials with different A cations and X halide ions, as well as 2D or 3D perovskites with mixed A cations, have different electrical and optical properties.
3.1 Sn perovskites with a single organic cation
Sn perovskites with a single organic cation are often used in inverted Sn-based PSCs, such as MASnI3, FASnI3, and CsSnI3. Unusual properties of these Sn perovskites are discussed in the following sections.

3.1.1 MASnI3. 
MASnI3 was first synthesized as a lead-free perovskite material in the 1970s, but it was not until 2014 that MASnI3 was used in PSCs.22 Snaith et al. reported the use of MASnI3 in PSCs with a mesoporous scaffold and demonstrated that MASnI3 is characterized by the α-phase of the tetragonal P4mm symmetry at room temperature (Fig. 4a and Table 1).30 MASnI3 transforms into tetragonal β (I4cm) and orthorhombic γ (Pbnm) phases at low temperature, which results in PSCs being sensitive to the self-doping levels of MASnI3. The cubic unit cell of α-phase MASnI3 is shown in Fig. 4b; the unit cell has a lattice parameter in the range of ∼6.231–6.243 Å.37 MASnI3 materials have been fabricated via the solid-state method37 or hydroiodic (HI) solution preparation method87 to vary the hole mobility (from 50 to 200 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole concentration (from 1017 to 1019 cm2) (Table 1).37,87–89 MASnI3 prepared using the HI solution approach exhibits a low charge concentration of 1 × 1014 cm−3 with a conductivity of ∼5 × 10−2 S cm−1, resulting in a high electron mobility of up to 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4c).31 Furthermore, the bandgap of MASnI3 (∼1.3 eV) is narrower than that of MAPbI3 (∼1.5 eV), which is more beneficial for single-junction solar cells. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the bandgap of MASnI3 can be tuned by incorporating different halides with energies from 1.30 to 2.15 eV (MASnBr3) (Fig. 4d).31 MASnX3 films can be fabricated via a solution processing method and exhibit excellent crystallinity.31 The hole and electron diffusion lengths of MASnI3 have been determined to be 193 ± 46 nm and 279 ± 88 nm, respectively, via fluorescence quenching measurements (Fig. 4e).50 Owing to its excellent photoelectric properties, MASnI3 has been used in different optoelectronic devices, such as photo-detectors and perovskite solar cells.25,90

In 2014, MASnI3 was first utilized in Sn-based PSCs with a mesoporous structure, achieving a promising PCE of 6.4%.30 Subsequently, Yan et al. first reported a MASnI3 perovskite absorber in inverted PSCs with a PCE of 1.7% (Fig. 4e).91 Although numerous studies have been conducted over the past few years, the PCE of inverted PSCs based on MASnI3 is still lower than that of PSCs based on other organic cations of the Sn perovskite, which can be attributed to its rapid oxidization in air.91,92,97 Recently, Zhan et al. developed a synthetic strategy for high quality MASnI3 films via ion exchange/insertion reactions between the solid SnF2 and the gaseous MAI, enabling the achievement of a PCE of up to 7.78%. This represents the highest PCE value ever reported for MASnI3-based inverted PSCs (Fig. 4f and g).92


3.1.2 FASnI3. 
The FA cation is most commonly used to replace the MA cation for improving the performance of Sn-based PSCs. FASnI3 has two main crystal structures, namely the Amm2 orthorhombic structure and the Pm3m cubic crystal structure (Fig. 5a and b). The cubic FASnI3 has a lattice parameter of ∼6.3290(9) Å.37 Unlike MASnI3, which is thermodynamically unstable, FASnI3 shows a stable perovskite structure at room temperature.37 The bandgap of FASnI3 is ∼1.4 eV, which is narrower than that of the Pb perovskite and wider than that of MASnI3 (Fig. 5c).37 The bandgaps of FASnX3 can be tuned using different halides. For example, the bandgaps of the FASnI2Br and FASnBr3 films are 1.68 and 2.40 eV, respectively.84,98 It has been reported that the introduction of Br into FASnI3 significantly reduces the carrier density due to the decreased Sn vacancies.99 Thus, the reduced defects of Sn vacancies will elongate the charge lifetime, leading to high-performance reproducible Sn-based PSCs. In addition, FASnI3 exhibits nearly the same thermal stability but a lower conductivity in comparison to MASnI3 (Fig. 5d).100 In addition, FASnI3 can be tuned to exhibit conductivity behavior ranging from p-type to intrinsic conductivity by changing its growth conditions, while MASnI3 shows only p-type conductivity.101 Shi found that organic cations play a vital role in affecting the defect physics of the Sn perovskite. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations proved that the large ionic size of the FA cation increases the formation energy of Sn vacancies.101 Milot et al. reported that the charge-carrier mobility of FASnI3 is 22 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the threshold charge-carrier density is up to 8 × 1017 cm−3 (Fig. 5e and Table 1).93 Furthermore, FASnI3 shows a strong bimolecular recombination and an Auger rate over an order of magnitude lower than that of the Pb perovskite.102 Thus, FASnI3 is an excellent absorber candidate for Sn-based PSCs.

Koh et al. first used FASnI3 in mesoporous Sn-based PSCs and achieved a PCE of 2.1%.104 In 2016, Yan and co-workers reported for the first time efficient inverted FASnI3-based PSCs via the solvent-engineering method with a maximum PCE of up to 6.22% (Fig. 5f).40 Since then, most high-performance inverted Sn-based PSCs have been predominantly based on the FASnI3 perovskite owing to its superior air stability than that of MASnI3.40,45,58,105,106 Very recently, Han et al. developed a novel templated growth method for high quality FASnI3 films, achieving a maximum PCE of 11.89% with a certified PCE of 11.22% (Fig. 5g).103 Wang et al. studied the degradation mechanism of the Sn perovskite and confirmed that FASnI3 materials exhibit better tolerance to O2.100 From theoretical calculations and chemical analyses, it was found that Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+ in MASnI3; however, replacing MA with FA in Sn perovskites could reduce the extent of Sn2+ oxidation, which might be related to the better thermodynamic stability of the oxidized products (FA2SnI6) than that of MA2SnI6.107


3.1.3 CsSnI3. 
CsSnI3 has similar electrical and optical properties to MASnI3 and CsSnI3 materials. Compared with organic–inorganic perovskites, such as those based on FASnI3 and MASnI3, the thermal stability of the all-inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite is significantly improved.37,108,109 The CsSnI3 perovskite has three main structures, namely cubic (α-CsSnI3), tetragonal (β-CsSnI3), and orthorhombic (γ-CsSnI3). CsSnI3 exhibits a 3D perovskite structure with orthorhombic Pnma symmetry at room temperature (Fig. 6a).108,109 The γ-CsSnI3 has a hole mobility of μh ∼ 585 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a charge density of ∼1017 cm−3 (Fig. 6b and Table 1).109 After thermal annealing, the conductivity and photoluminescence intensity of the CsSnI3 perovskite increase.109 The diffusion length of CsSnI3 is comparable to that of the MAPbI3 perovskite. It was reported that the melt-synthesized CsSnI3 single crystal has a carrier lifetime of 6.6 ns, a diffusion length of ∼1 μm, and a charge concentration of ∼4.5 × 1017 cm−3 (Fig. 6c).110 The surface recombination rate of CsSnI3 was found to be ∼2 × 103 cm s−1, which is as low as that of CsPbI3 (Fig. 6d).110 The bandgap of CsSnI3 can be tuned from 1.3 to 1.7 eV by incorporating the Br element (Fig. 6e).108,111 All-organic CsSnI3 has great potential for application in inverted PSCs owing to its excellent air stability and thermal stability.

It was reported that PSCs based on the CsPbI3 single crystal could achieve a PCE of up to 23%, which could be sufficiently high for the commercialization of solar cells.110 CsSnI3 was first used as the absorber in PSCs with a structure of ITO/CsSnI3/Au/Ti, yielding a PCE of 0.9%.113 Later, Kumar et al. used the CsSnI3 perovskite in mesoporous PSCs achieving a PCE of 2.02%.114 In 2016, the first inverted Sn-based PSCs using CsSnI3 as the absorber achieved a PCE of 3.31%.44 In 2019, Deng et al. reported a novel convenient approach to produce CsSnI3 perovskite quantum dots for lead-free perovskite films, achieving a PCE of 5.03% for all-inorganic inverted PSCs.115 Very recently, Li et al. reported a facile passivation strategy to modulate the trap state density in CsSnI3 perovskites via thiosemicarbazide (TSC), leading to a maximum PCE of 8.20% (Fig. 6f–h).112 Tao et al. fabricated grain-ordered, low defect density, and highly stable CsSnI3 films by localized electron density engineering through coordination interactions between the phthalimide and perovskite, generating a high PCE of over 10%.116

3.2 Low-dimensional Sn perovskites
Ruddlesden–Popper two-dimensional (RP-2D) Sn perovskites have drawn increasing attention owing to their moisture resistance and stability. The general chemical formula of RP-2D perovskites is (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1 (with n being an integer), where the A cations, B cations, and X anions form the perovskite structure.117 RNH3 is an aromatic alkylammonium or a primary aliphatic cation. A 2D network with corner-sharing [BX6]4− octahedra was observed between the layers of alkylammonium cations.117 Cao et al. for the first time reported the use of 2D Sn-based (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 as the absorber for regular Sn-based PSCs, obtaining a PCE of 2.5%.94 It was shown that the bandgaps of (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 can be tuned from 1.83 to 1.20 eV by increasing the number of layers (n) from 1 to ∞.94 2D Sn perovskites were first reported in inverted Sn-based PSCs in 2017. Ning and co-workers used PEA and FA cations to fabricate a 2D (PEA)2(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 structure for Sn-based PSCs, achieving a PCE of 5.94% with a high Voc of 0.583 V and improved stability.118 PEA acts as an organic spacer layer (Fig. 7a–c) and plays a critical role in enhancing the air stability compared with the 3D structure. Additionally, it was reported that the orientation of the perovskite structure could be modified by varying the PEA ratio, and a highly preferentially oriented perovskite layer perpendicular to the surface of the substrate was formed by adding 20% PEA. In addition, the highly oriented Sn perovskite could improve the charge transport and reduce the background charge density. In 2019, Chen et al. first introduced the mixed spacer organic cations, BA and PEA, to form (BA0.5PEA0.5)2FA3Sn4I13 for inverted Sn-based PSCs, achieving a maximum PCE of up to 8.82% (Fig. 7d and e).96

Loi et al. reported a 2D-quasi-2D–3D Sn perovskite film fabricated by mixing the 2D Sn perovskite with 0.92 M (molar ratio) of 3D FASnI3 for inverted p–i–n Sn-based PSCs, generating a PCE as high as 9.0% (Fig. 7f).120 After this work, numerous investigations have been conducted on 2D-quasi-2D–3D perovskites (Fig. 7f).41,63,119,121,122 Li et al. fabricated a low-dimensional inorganic perovskite film using Sn(SCN)2 and phenylethylamine hydroiodide additives for precise control of the crystal growth, reaching a PCE of 5.01%.123 Recently, PSCs based on 2D-quasi-2D–3D Sn perovskites have reached a certified PCE of up to 12.4%, which is the highest value reported thus far.41
3.3 3D Sn perovskites with mixed cations
The perovskite structure can be stabilized by mixed cations which combine the advantages of various cations while limiting their disadvantages. 3D Pb perovskites with mixed cations at the A site are widely used in PSCs as they exhibit higher stability and performance.124 Most high-performance Pb-based PSCs have been based on 3D mixed-cation perovskites because of their superior photovoltaic properties.13,82,125 3D halide Sn perovskites with mixed cations are also promising as light absorbers in inverted Sn-based PSCs. In 2016, Liu et al. introduced MA and Cs mixed cations (MA0.9Cs0.1SnI3) in the Sn perovskite. The obtained unoptimized inverted Sn-based PSCs were found to display a PCE of 0.33% with a Jsc of 4.53 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.22 V.126 Bian et al. reported a mixed-organic-cation perovskite absorber, (FA)x(MA)1−xSnI3, in inverted Sn-based PSCs (Fig. 8a–c).58 It was found that the crystallization and absorption of the perovskite film were affected by the MA and FA cation ratios. The bandgap could be tuned by changing the FA content within the range of ∼1.26–1.36 eV. Furthermore, the film morphology of the Sn perovskite was highly improved, leading to a reduction in the charge recombination of PSCs. Therefore, the inverted PSCs based on (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3 materials exhibited an outstanding PCE of 8.12% with a remarkable Voc of 0.61 V. Huang et al. reported the influence of different antisolvents on the charge recombination and film morphology of (FA)0.75(MA)0.25SnI3 in inverted PSCs. It was found that a dense and uniform perovskite film could be formed using chlorobenzene as the antisolvent, achieving a PCE of 9.06%.62 Han et al. fabricated the Cs0.2FA0.8SnI3 perovskite with an amorphous-polycrystalline structure to improve the charge extraction and transport properties of Sn-based PSCs, obtaining a certified PCE of over 10% (Fig. 8d and e).127 Wakamiya et al. used tin(0) nanoparticles to treat the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite for high-performance Sn-based PSCs, achieving a PCE of 9.9% (Fig. 8f).128

In the above, we have reviewed the properties of Sn perovskites in terms of three main aspects: (1) Sn perovskites with different A cations and X halide ions, (2) low-dimensional Sn perovskites, and (3) 3D perovskites with mixed A cations. The properties, such as crystal structure, mobility or conductivity, carrier density and energy levels, have been summarized and discussed with a brief review on the process of inverted Sn-based PSCs based on different Sn perovskites. In Section 4, we will discuss different methods and techniques for constructing high quality perovskite films.
4. Constructing a high quality Sn perovskite active layer
In inverted Sn-based PSCs, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between the HTL and the ETL. The perovskite layer should have multiple functions, such as light absorption, charge generation, and charge separation. Furthermore, an ideal perovskite layer for high-performance devices should have several features: large grain size, long charge diffusion length, high charge mobility, as well as compact and uniform surface.43 Large grain size, long charge diffusion length, and high charge mobility contribute to the charge transport. A compact film is a key requirement to avoid the current leakage generated by the direct contact between the ETL and the HTL. Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the quality of the Sn perovskite active layer. Due to the different crystallization speeds between the Pb and Sn perovskites, several methods that are suitable for Pb perovskites may not be suitable for Sn perovskites.129–131 Sn perovskites show a faster crystallization process than Pb perovskites due to the lower solubility of SnI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).131 In addition, SnI2 has a much better solubility in isopropyl alcohol than PbI2. The two-step solution method commonly used for Pb perovskites would not be suitable for Sn perovskite films due to the isopropyl alcohol used for MAI in the second step.130 In the following section, different methods, interface passivation, and additives for constructing high quality Sn perovskite active layers are presented.
4.1 One-step solution method
The most widely used one-step spin-coating method for Sn perovskites takes inspiration from Pb-based PSC fabrication methods.77,132–134 However, solvents that are commonly used in the one-step method, such as γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and DMF, cannot be utilized to realize smooth Sn perovskite layers due to the lower solubility of SnI2 and faster crystalline rate compared with Pb perovskites. This motivated the use of various solvent-engineering methods to fabricate high quality Sn perovskite layers via the one-step method. Hao et al. found that DMSO could form a stable SnI2·3DMSO intermediate which delays the perovskite crystallization and achieves the best coverage without pinholes (Fig. 9a and b).131

Many antisolvents, such as chlorobenzene,136 toluene132 and diethyl ether,137 have also been used to obtain highly uniform and crystalline perovskites by dripping during the spin-coating process. It was found that this antisolvent method can form the intermediate phases to prevent the rapid reaction between SnI2 and MAI/FAI and provide a supersaturated driving force for the nucleation, thus enabling the formation of dense and uniform surfaces.5,25,132 Wakamiya et al. used hot chlorobenzene antisolvent treatment to increase the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film coverage and decrease the number of pinholes (Fig. 9c and d). They found that a full coverage film could be formed using hot chlorobenzene (65 °C) as the antisolvent due to the increased density of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 nucleation sites.135 The resulting high quality FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 films enable the inverted Sn-based PSCs to achieve a PCE of up to 6.6%. In 2019, Huang et al. compared the morphology of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite films fabricated with different antisolvents (Fig. 9e and f). They found that, when using chlorobenzene as the antisolvent, a dense and uniform Sn perovskite film could be formed, permitting the achievement of a maximum PCE of up to 9.06%.62
4.2 Two-step solution method
The two-step solution method has been widely used for lead-based perovskites; this method is more flexible for controlling the crystallization than the one-step approach.3,138–140 However, SnI2 has a much better solubility in isopropyl alcohol than PbI2, as isopropyl alcohol can easily deteriorate Sn perovskites. Thus, the widely used two-step method for Pb-based PSCs is not suitable for Sn perovskites. In 2017, Jen et al. first used a modified two-step solution method for Sn-based PSCs. They introduced trimethylaluminum (TMA) into a precursor solution with SnI2 and a small amount of SnF2 (10 mol%) to fabricate a SnI2 film. TMA was employed as an additional Lewis base to form SnI2–TMA complexes, thereby delaying the fast reaction occurring between FAI and SnI2.141 Therefore, this two-step method modulates the perovskite crystallization to allow a homogenous dispersion of SnF2, thus preventing its segregation. The TMA additive has significantly improved the film coverage and quality of the SnI2 film (Fig. 10a). The homogeneous morphology of these SnI2 films results in a dense and compact morphology with large crystallites for the FASnI3 layers (Fig. 10b).

Reproduced with permission.142 Copyright 2020, American Chemical Society. 
Recently, Diau and co-workers reported the use of a novel cosolvent system for the second step of the two-step solution method.142 In the first step, they used DMSO as the solvent for the deposition of the SnI2 film and demonstrated that DMSO could form a stable SnI2·3DMSO intermediate at this stage (Fig. 10c). Then, the cosolvent system composed of isopropanol (IPA), hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP), and chlorobenzene with a 5:5:2 optimal ratio was used to fabricate the FAI film on top of the SnI2/DMSO film. They speculated that H-bonding interactions among HFP, IPA, and FAI stabilized the FAI film, thus preventing the quick penetration of IPA from destroying the SnI2 film. Furthermore, chlorobenzene could act as an antisolvent for the extraction of the residual DMSO during annealing. The cosolvent system reduced the rate of crystal growth between SnI2 and FAI, resulting in a uniform FASnI3 film (Fig. 10c). During this process, CB served as the antisolvent. Ethylenediammonium dihypophosphite (EDAP2) was used in the first step as a reducing agent to increase the PCE from ∼5% to ∼7% with excellent reproducibility and stability. Very recently, they used this new sequential deposition method to deposit anilinium cations on top of the FA0.8GA0.2SnI3 layer in order to form a 3D/quasi-2D layer, achieving a maximum PCE of 10.6%.143 Therefore, this novel two-step solution method is promising for the fabrication of high quality inverted Sn-based PSCs.
4.3 Vapor deposition method
High quality Sn perovskite layers can also be fabricated via the vapor deposition method due to the low melting point of perovskite materials.105,130,142,144,145 The vapor-assisted method can be used to fabricate Sn perovskite multilayers without damaging the bottom layer. In addition, the vapor deposition method permits the preparation of Sn perovskite layers without the use of incompatible solvents and gives rise to a uniform and ultrasmooth morphology for the grown films.3,146,147 The MAI, FAI, SnI2, and SnBr2 materials are easily deposited on substrates via evaporation.91,105,130,148,149 In 2016, Yokoyama et al. fabricated a MASnI3 film via a low-temperature vapor-assisted solution process (LT-VASP) (Fig. 11a).130 The temperature of the substrate during the vapor-assisted solution process is a key parameter to achieve high quality MASnI3 films exhibiting high surface coverage and excellent uniformity (Fig. 11b and c).130 The device obtained through this LT-VASP approach was found to exhibit a PCE of 1.80% with improved reproducibility. It was noted that Sn perovskite layers fabricated via the LT-VASP method have a lower hole carrier concentration which significantly improves the air stability and PCE. Yu et al. also fabricated MASnI3 thin films with uniform coverage and a smooth surface via a dual-source coevaporation method, obtaining a high Voc of 0.494 V and a PCE of 1.7%.91 Moghe et al. fabricated CsSnBr3-based inverted PSCs via an all vapor-deposition method. It should be noted that MoO3, perovskite, C60, BCP, and Ag can be sequentially vapor-deposited onto substrates without solution engineering.73 Using this strategy, the air stability was found to be significantly improved. Song et al. employed SnF2 and MAI as precursors for the fabrication of MASnI3 films via the vapor deposition method through ion exchange/insertion reactions (Fig. 11d).92 The obtained SnF2/PEDOT:PSS film was found to be uniform with high surface coverage and covered with fine mesh cracks. As the film was exposed to MAI vapor, MASnI3 crystals were observed and grown (Fig. 11f–h). Finally, the resultant MASnI3 was found to be continuous and compact without pinholes, leading to a PCE of 7.78%. Very recently, Choi et al. introduced a bilayer composed of 2D PEA2SnI4 and 3D MASnI3 perovskites fabricated via a sequential vapor deposition method combining vapor reaction and vacuum deposition. The resultant 2D/3D perovskite thin layers were found to be highly uniform, and the introduction of PEA2SnI4 enhanced the crystallinity of MASnI3 and suppressed Sn2+ oxidation. The average PCE of the devices was measured to be up to 9.2% ± 0.2%.150 While the vapor deposition method can be employed to fabricate high quality Sn perovskite films, the PCE of the inverted Sn-based PSCs based on this method still needs to be enhanced.

4.4 Other methods
Besides the aforementioned major methods, other methods have been reported for the fabrication of the Sn perovskite active layer, such as solvent annealing,135 solvothermal reaction,151 cocrystallization,152 melt synthesis,153 and cold precursor solution.154 Wakamiya et al. discovered that the average crystallite size of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 could be enlarged through the solvent annealing method (Fig. 12a). They used a mild DMSO solvent (<1.0 μL) in a Petri dish to create a DMSO vapor-enriched atmosphere during thermal annealing of the perovskite film, which could dissolve the small perovskite crystallites in the DMSO vapor. They also found that the average grain size was increased from 237 to 394 nm (Fig. 12b–e), leading to a corresponding increase in the PCE from 5.7% to 7.1%.135 Chen et al. reported that the optical properties of CsSnX3 quantum rods could be tuned via the solvothermal method without requiring an annealing process; this finding renders these CsSnX3 quantum rods attractive for solar cells.151 The resulting quantum rod morphology could facilitate charge collection and light harvesting for high performance PSCs. Diau et al. showed that the cocrystallization method could be adopted to achieve reproducible and stable MASnIBr2−xClx-based PSCs.152 The electrochemical impedance spectra and transient fluorescence (TRPL) decay spectra demonstrated that the dielectric relaxation, superior charge recombination, and longest lifetime properties result in the superior performance of Sn-based PSCs. It was also shown that Cl in the lattice could suppress the charge recombination and enhance the lifetime, leading to improved PCEs of the corresponding devices. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that melt-synthesized CsSnI3 single crystal grains could be more effective to mitigate the inferior photophysical and morphological properties of Sn perovskite films.153 Compared with polycrystalline analogs, the CsSnI3 single crystal has a lower defect density, a higher minority carrier mobility, and a longer lifetime. A PCE of ∼23% was predicted via solar cell performance simulations for the optimized CsSnI3-based PSCs, thereby indicating that melt-synthesized CsSnI3 ingots have great application potential. Very recently, cold perovskite precursor solution is used to control the crystallization process by slowing down the nucleation rate due to the raised Gibbs free energy for nucleation at low temperatures.154 The FASnI3 fabricated using 0 °C precursor solution shows oriented growth with micrometer-scale grains, which can significantly decrease the trap state density and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+.

4.5 Interface passivation and additives
Non-radiative recombination, which originates from the traps and interface mismatch energy level,66 is becoming one of the main factors limiting the Voc and FF values of Sn-based PSCs. Interface passivation of perovskites is an efficient way to reduce non-radiative recombination. However, due to the sensitivity of perovskites to solvents, oxygen, and HTL/ETL materials, only a few studies have been conducted on the interfaces in inverted Sn-based PSCs. In 2018, Chen et al. first introduced an ultrathin phenylethylammonium bromide (PEABr) interlayer between the PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite film. This layer was found to assist the growth of perovskites, endowing them with an improved film morphology and reduced traps. Additionally, trap passivation suppresses charge recombination at the interfaces, resulting in an outstanding PCE of 7.05%.155 Ran et al. evaporated an ultrathin LiF interlayer to reduce the work function of PEDOT:PSS and improve the hole extraction at the interface of ITO/PEDOT:PSS. The LiF layer was shown to improve the Voc and FF of Sn-based PSCs, permitting the achievement of a maximum PCE of 6.98%.156 Yan et al. introduced MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 flakes at the interface of NiOx/FASnI3 to promote hole extraction and suppress charge recombination. The WSe2-modified devices reach a high PCE of up to 10.47%.157 In 2020, Kamarudin et al. introduced an ethane-1,2-diamine interlayer between the perovskite and the ETL to passivate the surface traps of the perovskite in order to suppress the non-radiative recombination for enhancing Voc. This results in an increase in the Voc by up to 0.1 V with a PCE of up to 9.37%.64 Very recently, Liu et al. reported a pre-treatment of FASnI3via the introduction of n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) as the interlayer to induce the template growth of perovskite crystals, resulting in a high quality perovskite film with a low trap state density. In this case, the maximum PCE value was as high as 11.22%.103
Both the quality of the Sn perovskite film and the stability of Sn2+ are crucial aspects to realize inverted Sn-based PSCs with high performance. To this end, some additives have been reported to enhance the stability of Sn2+ and control the crystallization kinetics of lead-free perovskites (Table 2 and Fig. 13).40,46,72,86,95,156,158–175 Marshall et al. utilized different Sn halide additives, such as SnF2, SnCl2, and SnBr2, to investigate CsSnI3 films. It was found that the morphology of CsSnI3 with 10 mol% SnCl2 has a higher pinhole density, comparable to that of CsSnI3 with 10 mol% SnF2, SnBr2, or SnI2.56 However, devices based on 10 mol% SnCl2 have the highest PCE, which could be attributed to SnCl2 forming an ultrathin hole-selective layer at the interface between ITO and CsSnI3. Furthermore, SnCl2 at the CsSnI3 surface forms a Schottky barrier to prevent electrons from transiting from the fullerene to the ITO electrode through the pinholes. SnF2 is commonly used as an additive in Sn perovskites to prevent the oxidization of Sn2+ into Sn4+.25 The lattice parameters of the Sn perovskite are not changed after the addition of SnF2. Additionally, F− does not replace I− of the perovskite film due to the large difference between the ionic radii of F (1.33 Å) and I (2.29 Å).176 Gupta et al. reported that the SnF2 additive could reduce the background carrier density and cation vacancies which affect the work function and electronic band structure of CsSnBr3.114 SnF2 was also found to increase the diffusion length, photocarrier lifetime, and stability of Sn-based materials.50,177,178 In 2016, the FASnI3 absorber was first reported to be doped with SnF2 in inverted Sn-based PSCs.40 It was found that using the SnF2 additive together with the diethyl ether antisolvent is critical for the fabrication of pinhole-free and highly uniform FASnI3 films. The average PCE of these Sn-based PSCs was measured to be 5.41% ± 0.46% with a small J–V hysteresis.

However, an excess of SnF2 leads to a decrease in the device performance due to phase separation at the surface of the FASnI3 film and the aggregation at the grain boundaries. Lee et al. combined SnF2 with pyrazine to mitigate the phase separation induced by SnF2 and the unwanted Sn2+ oxidation.176 They successfully fabricated inverted Sn-based PSCs with good reproducibility and long-term stability with a maximum PCE of 4.8%. In 2017, Zhu et al. added a Lewis-type base additive (trimethylamine (TMA)) to the Sn perovskite, which resulted in the formation of the SnY2-TMA (Y: I−, F−) complex. This significantly improved the morphology of the perovskite film with the presence of large crystals. The PCE of these inverted Sn-based PSCs was found to be as high as 7.09% with an improved N2 and air stability. Similarly, Deng et al. also used a Lewis-type polymer additive (PMMA) to optimize the electronic properties, morphology, PCE, and device stability.159 Tai et al. employed hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid or salt, including phenolsulfonic acid (PSA), 2-aminophenol-4-sulfonic acid (APSA), and the potassium salt of hydroquinone sulfonic acid (KHQSA), in the Sn perovskite film in the presence of SnCl2 (Fig. 14a).72 It was proved that Sn2+ in the solution could establish a coordination interaction and electrostatic attraction with the sulfonate group (Fig. 14a). Additionally, these additives could be used to limit SnCl2 aggregates (Fig. 14a), and the reducing hydroxybenzene group eliminated Sn2+ oxidation. The average PCE of inverted Sn-based PSCs could be improved to 6.76% with excellent air stability. He et al. reported that the segregation of SnF2 could be suppressed by the environmentally-friendly additive TFEACl, resulting in an enhancement of both PCE and stability.158 Han et al. reported the surface-controlled growth of FASnI3 perovskite films using FOEI, achieving a certificated PCE of 10.16% (Fig. 14b).42 Very recently, Wakamiya et al. used the 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-dihydropyrazine (TM-DHP) reagent to form Sn(0) nanoparticles in situ in the perovskite precursor, reaching a PCE of 11.5% (Fig. 14c).128 Meng et al. introduced piperazine dihydriodide in the perovskite precursor to form stable clusters before nucleation, attaining a PCE of 11.39% along with enhanced stability (Fig. 14d).173 Very recently, Bian et al. introduced a reducing phenylhydrazine cation (PhNHNH3+) and halide anions (Cl− and Br−) into the FASnI3 film, greatly improving the PCE and stability of inverted Sn-based PSCs. The optimal device achieved a PCE of 13.4% (certified: 12.4%).45

Furthermore, several other additives have been used in association with the SnF2 additive to improve the performance. For example, Bian et al. first reported that the addition of Sn powder and SnF2 to FASnI3 could reduce the elevated carrier concentration and charge recombination, leading to a PCE of 6.75%.166 Ran et al. introduced a conjugated large-volume amine (3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine (PPA)) and SnF2 in the formamidinium FASnI3 perovskite (Fig. 14e).122 It was found that PPA could passivate the surface vacancy or replace FA at the surface of FASnI3 (Fig. 14f). The introduction of PPA into FASnI3 could improve the film quality and enhance the charge extraction and transport, resulting in a maximum PCE of 9.61% with superior stability. The Han group also reported that the addition of SnCl2 and SnF2 could form a stable amorphous-polycrystalline structure in the perovskite layer, resulting in a high PCE of over 10% and enhanced stability.127
In brief, the SnF2 additive has been widely used in Sn perovskite preparation. However, the mechanism behind the improved performance achieved through this approach needs to be further studied in depth. Heo et al. showed that the improved performance of Sn-based PSCs could be due to surface passivation and stabilization energetics, which in turn could be caused by the interactions and lattice interstitial site occupation of SnF2 rather than the suppression of Sn2+ oxidation.179
In the above section of discussion, various film fabrication methods, interface passivation approaches, and additives to obtain high quality Sn perovskite films have been reviewed and discussed. The film quality of the Sn perovskite, including crystalline quality, grain size, pinhole number and so on, is of paramount importance for achieving highly efficient and reproducible PSCs. In the following section, recent advances in improving the stability of inverted Sn-based PSCs will be reviewed.
5. Stability issues of inverted Sn-based PSCs
Stability is a key factor for the commercialization of photovoltaic devices. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 standard is generally used to determine whether the stability of solar devices could meet the industry requirements. In order to comply with the IEC61215:2016 standard, PSCs have to be subjected to the damp heat test (85 °C/85% RH, 1000 h), thermal cycling test (∼−40 to 85 °C, 200 cycles), ultraviolet (UV) preconditioning test (60 °C, 15 kW h m−2), maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and light soaking test (55 °C ± 5 °C, 1000 h).180 However, stability tests for Pb-based PSCs in the laboratory are often not strictly carried out according to the IEC61215:2016 standard. Several conventional stability tests, such as storage stability, thermal stability, operational stability, and light soaking stability tests, have been conducted to evaluate the device stability.181 In storage stability tests, the prepared PSCs (encapsulated or unencapsulated) are placed in air or in a glove box to investigate their aging performance. Thermal stability tests are carried out on a hot stage at temperatures in the range of ∼60–100 °C for hundreds of hours. Operational stability tests are carried out to investigate aged PSCs under one-sun illumination at MPPT. Light soaking stability tests investigate the aged devices in the presence of a light source for a certain period of time. In 2020, there is a consensus statement for the stability of PSCs. Standard testing procedures should be followed to investigate the stability of PSCs based on International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS), including stability under light–dark cycling (ISOS-LC), stability in the dark under continuously applied bias (ISOS-V), and intrinsic stability testing (ISOS-I).182
Sn-Based PSCs are highly air sensitive due to the fact that Sn2+ easily oxidizes to Sn4+ in the Sn perovskite layer.37 For instance, the FASnI3 perovskite is seriously degraded after exposure to air for 6 h, as confirmed through absorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 15a and b).183 The rate of degradation becomes much faster after annealing in air at 100 °C (Fig. 15c and d). The perovskite film was almost decomposed and became transparent after annealing for 40 min. Therefore, the instability of Sn perovskites has to be immediately improved in order to realize inverted Sn-based PSCs with high performance. In addition, interfacial interactions in Sn-based PSCs should also be considered to improve the stability of the devices.

Zhu et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of TMA in the FASnI3 precursor could improve the stability of Sn-based PSCs. It was found that the FASnI3 devices showed enhanced stability when stored in N2 and air.141 Furthermore, the FASnI3 devices with an inverted structure showed better stability than the regular FASnI3 devices. Both types of device retain over 80% of their initial PCEs after being encapsulated in N2 for a month. Marshall et al. reported that HTL-free inverted CsSnI3 PSCs with 10 mol% SnCl2 exhibited enhanced stability (Fig. 16a).56 The unencapsulated devices retained 70% of their initial value under one-sun illumination in ambient air for about 7 h. In addition, their stability was almost 20 times higher than that of Pb-based devices under the same conditions. This is the first report to establish that Sn-based PSCs have better stability than Pb-based PSCs based on the same structure. Recently, Qiu et al. introduced n-butylamine (BA) and PEA in the perovskite precursor to fabricate a 2D Sn perovskite layer, which significantly improved the stability of the resulting Sn-based PSCs in a N2 environment. These PSCs retained 60% of their initial PCE after 24 days, while PSCs based on individual BA or PEA retained only about 50% (59%) of their initial PCE after eight days, and 3D Sn-based PSCs only maintained ∼20% after eight days (Fig. 16b).96 Recently, Ran et al. reported that the incorporation of PPA into the FASnI3 precursor could result in outstanding stability. After being stored in N2 for 60 days, these PSCs based on PPA retained 82% of their initial efficiency, while the efficiency of the control devices dropped to 12% of the original value (Fig. 16c).122 Additionally, PSCs based on PPA exhibit better air stability and thermal stability. Very interestingly, PPA-based devices have a self-healing effect. After being exposed to air and then stored in N2 for a certain time, PPA-based devices were able to partially restore their PCE (Fig. 16d).122 Furthermore, the stability of these Sn-based PSCs could be significantly enhanced by introducing hydrogen bonding between the additive and Sn perovskite. For example, Meng et al. demonstrated an effective approach to achieve highly efficient and stable FASnI3-based PSCs by introducing O–H⋯I− hydrogen bonding interactions. These PCs were found to exhibit excellent light illumination stability with no decay in PCE after 400 h of operation (Fig. 16e).106

It should be noted that Sn2+ oxidation could be suppressed after introducing reducing additives in situ encapsulated in the Sn perovskite grains. For example, Kayesh et al. reported that the addition of hydrazinium chloride (N2H5Cl) in FASnI3 as a reductant could suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, retaining 65% of its initial PCE for up to 1000 h in a glove box (Fig. 17a).163 Gu et al. firstly introduced Sn powder into the FASnI3 precursor solution to reduce the concentration of Sn4+. The obtained device could retain 80% of its initial PCE after 860 h of storage in a glove box.166 Tai et al. employed an antioxidant additive (potassium salt of hydroquinone sulfonic acid (KHQSA)) to significantly enhance the air stability of Sn-based PSCs. The unencapsulated Sn-based PSCs based on KHQSA could retain 80% of the original PCE after 500 h of air exposure (Fig. 17b).72 Recently, they also introduced an antioxidant, gallic acid (GA), together with SnCl2 to further improve the performance of Sn-based PSCs. The corresponding PSCs could retain almost 80% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of storage in air; this represents the best air stability for Sn-based PSCs to date (Fig. 17c).46 Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) and TM-DHP were also introduced to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ in order to obtain Sn-based PSCs with high stability. The unencapsulated devices based on TM-DHP and PHCl displayed almost no reduction in performance over 50 and 110 days, respectively. Controlling the crystallization process of high quality Sn perovskite films is also crucial to obtain devices with high stability. In addition, high quality Sn perovskite films with a lower defect density could result in the reduction of the number of pathways for ion migration, thus enhancing the stability. Meng et al. introduced FOEI to control the crystallization process of the Sn perovskite, reducing the surface energy of the liquid-gas interface. This FOEI-based device almost retained its initial efficiency after 500 h of operation under light (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 17d).42 Very recently, Meng et al. modulated the crystallization kinetics of FASnI3 through a non-classical nucleation mechanism based on piperazine dihydriodide, achieving high quality perovskite films with a much lower defect density. The stability of the corresponding device was enhanced and retained >90% of its initial efficiency after 200 h (Fig. 17e).173 Liu et al. reported a pre-treatment of the FASnI3 perovskite film consisting in spin-coating of n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) before annealing. This procedure resulted in the templated growth of FASnI3 crystals for high quality films with a lower trap state density. The PAI-derived device maintained >95% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of operation at the maximum power point (Fig. 17f).103

Device encapsulation is also an effective way to improve the stability of inverted Sn-based PSCs. Timely encapsulation can avoid oxygen and water contamination and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. There are several widely used encapsulation methods, such as airtight encapsulation,184 atomic layer deposition,185 roll lamination (device encapsulation by two adhesive sheets),186 heat sealing,187 and UV-curable epoxy sealing.188 Currently, most inverted Sn-based PSCs are encapsulated by UV curable glues.63,106 Liao et al. found that inverted FASnI3 PSCs are more stable after encapsulation, retaining 85% of their initial PCE after being stored in a glove box for one month.40 They speculated that the degradation of the encapsulated Sn-based PSCs could be due to the measurements under ambient conditions and the use of organic materials as interfacial layers.189 Lee et al. also found that the encapsulated Sn-based PSCs showed excellent long-term stability, retaining 98% of their initial PCE after storage for 100 days.176
In addition, device interfaces are also crucial for obtaining stable inverted Sn-based PSCs. The widely used PEDOT:PSS material for the HTL in Sn-based PSCs is unfavorable for the stability.11,190–193 The ITO electrode and perovskite would be corroded due to the acidic nature of the PEDOT:PSS solution. Furthermore, hygroscopicity could cause moisture inside the Sn perovskite layer. A few groups have used different HTLs, such as NiOx and CuI, to replace PEDOT:PSS in order to improve the stability of Sn-based PSCs.46,119 For example, Wang et al. used NiOx as the HTL in Sn-based PSCs in combination with the NH4SCN additive. In this way, they were able to enhance the stability of the device, which was found to retain over 90% of its initial PCE after being stored for 600 h without encapsulation.119 The Han group also used PEG to modify PEDOT:PSS in order to achieve higher stability. The corresponding device retained more than 90% of its initial PCE after being stored in air for 4 h.71
From the above discussions, it can be inferred that Sn perovskites without encapsulation are very air sensitive and will be seriously degraded after exposure to air for several hours. The in situ encapsulation of reducing additives in the Sn perovskite grains can stabilize Sn-based PSCs over several thousand hours. Besides device encapsulation, properly selecting HTLs to replace PEDOT:PSS and regulating crystallization process using additives can also improve the stability of Sn-based PSCs. All in all, various efforts such as developing new encapsulation methods, using different reducing additives, and constructing high-quality perovskite layers are all effective in improving the stability of Sn-based PSCs as well as that of Pb-based PSCs.
6. Summary and future challenges
Currently, lead-free perovskites are becoming attractive candidates for application as solar cells. In this work, the recent developments and future perspectives regarding highly efficient and stable planar inverted Sn-based PSCs were reviewed. In particular, the features of the p–i–n structure, interface modification approaches, Sn perovskites, and their photovoltaic performance were discussed. The planar p–i–n structure of Sn-based PSCs has constituted a breakthrough in this field. Ever since, these inverted devices have attracted increasing attention owing to their low-temperature fabrication, cost-effectiveness, and suppressed hysteresis behavior. Film quality and interface engineering play a vital role in achieving high-performance Sn-based PSCs. Despite achieving a maximum certified PCE as high as 12.4%, the PCE and stability of Sn-based PSCs still lag behind those of Pb-based PSCs. The main obstacle for enhanced performance is the low Voc which is due to charge recombination. Although a record Voc value of 0.94 V has been reported, the average Voc of p–i–n Sn-based PSCs is only 0.5–0.7 V. Thus, the most urgent task is to increase Voc. In addition, the FF of inverted Sn-based PSCs is also lower than that of Pb-based PSCs. Further fundamental research should be undertaken to deeply understand the origin of such low Voc and FF values. If Voc and FF were as high as 1.0 V and 80%, respectively, the PCE of planar inverted Sn-based PSCs could be similar to that of Pb-based PSCs.
In addition, the stability of Sn-based PSCs is still far from the requirements for commercialization. Therefore, improving the air stability of Sn-based PSCs remains an urgent challenge. The instability could be attributed to the Sn2+ oxidation and perovskite decomposition after exposure to oxygen and water. To enhance the stability of Sn-based PSCs, the chemical composition of the perovskite layer should be finely tuned, and suitable materials for interface engineering should be developed. For example, several interface materials used in OLEDs or organic photovoltaics (OPVs) could be better alternatives for improving the device stability. Furthermore, specific reagents, such as phenol derivatives, could be selected to suppress the Sn2+ oxidation for improving the stability of the Sn perovskite. The performance of large-scale Sn-based PSCs is also important for practical applications. Upon increasing the device area, the PCE tends to decrease due to the non-uniform fabrication for layers with a large area, and consequently the series resistance increases. Until now, only few studies have investigated the fabrication of high quality Sn perovskite films with an area of 1 cm2. Further studies should focus on scalable fabrication methods and morphology modulation to obtain high quality pinhole-free perovskite films. Furthermore, developing encapsulation methods could also be important for the realization of highly stable inverted Sn-based PSCs. It is envisaged that, through continuous interface engineering, physical studies, and simultaneous control of the chemical composition of lead-free stable perovskites, important breakthroughs will be made in the future on high-performance inverted Sn-based PSCs for commercial applications.

Broader context
Lead-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as one of the most promising candidates for new generation photovoltaic devices, have achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.5%. However, the presence of lead in perovskites hampers the market prospect of these solar cells. Sn perovskites with narrow band gaps and high carrier mobilities are thus by far the most promising alternatives. The main structures of lead-free Sn-based PSCs can be divided into regular and inverted structures. Inverted Sn-based PSCs show a number of advantages including their simple fabrication, low cost, and negligible hysteresis behavior. Here, recent developments and future perspectives regarding inverted Sn-based PSCs are reviewed. In particular, this review focuses mainly on the features and interfaces of inverted Sn-based PSCs, properties of Sn perovskites, and fabrication of a high quality Sn perovskite active layer, highlighting the obstacles to further progress and opportunities for future work. Finally, we propose the challenges and prospects in further development of inverted Sn-based PSCs.
