    , Accepted 22nd April 2014First published on 24th April 2014AbstractThe density of state (DOS) of intra-gap traps and the dynamics of electron transport of a dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cell were investigated by means of time-resolved charge extraction (TRCE). The intrinsic chemical capacitance of the TiO2 layer was separated from the parasitic capacitance of the FTO electrode, and was found to be dependent biexponentially on the photovoltage. It was shown that the shallow traps (>700 meV) differ from the deep ones (<350 meV) by the respective characteristic energy of 48 meV and 765 meV, and that the amount of shallow traps is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the deep ones. Our results support the mechanism of shallow-trap dominant multiple-trap limited charge transport, and suggest a substantial margin for the short-circuit photocurrent density to reach its theoretical limit.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconductors are capable of displaying a power conversion efficiency exceeding 10%.1,2 The primary light-to-electricity conversion occurs in the photoanode of DSSCs consisting of a thin layer of interconnected TiO2 nanoparticles adsorbed with light-harvesting dye molecules.3 Photoexcitation induces efficient dye*-to-TiO2 interfacial electron injection,4–7 which is followed by the electron percolation through the TiO2 layer towards the fluorine-doped-tin-oxide (FTO) coated transparent electrode.8–10 Concomitantly, dye radical cations left by the electron transfer are reduced by the secondary electron donors in electrolytes.11 The charge transport efficiency of a photoanode is evidently a key determinant for the overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Since the TiO2 layer is screened by the electrolytes from the internal electric field of the device, electron transport in the photoanode is considered to be diffusive rather than drifting.12–15 Besides, electron transport in the TiO2-photoanode is generally regarded as a trap-limited process owing to the high concentration of intra-gap trap states, which results in a few orders of magnitude lower electron diffusion coefficient with reference to the bulky anatase TiO2 crystal.16 Furthermore, electron transport in DSSCs is known to be intimately dependent on the incident light intensity as well as on the photoanode morphology.17,18
Electron transport can be described by the multiple-trap model or the hopping model.19–24 The former assumes that the effective electron transport occurs merely in the conduction band, i.e. the electrons trapped by intra-gap states have to be freed by jumping into the conduction band, as evidenced by the power-law dependence of the electron diffusion coefficient on the intensity of incident light,19–23 whereas the latter assumes the tunneling mechanism among the intra-gap states, which is supported by the strong dependence of electron conductivity on the bias potential.24 To date, the mechanism of electron transport remains obscure, however, it is generally accepted that the density of intra-gap states plays a crucial role in the electron transport in photoanodes. The trap states may origin from the structural defects at the surfaces and the grain boundaries of TiO2 particles,25–27 as well as from those in the interior of TiO2 nanocrystallites.26–28 As an alternative view, the trap states may mainly arise from the electrostatic attraction between the electrons in TiO2 and the metal cations in the electrolyte.29
Regarding the density-of-state (DOS) distribution of the intra-gap traps, Marshall proposed different types of DOS distribution for amorphous semiconductors based the Monte Carlo simulation, i.e. Gaussian, rectangular, linear and exponential.30 Assuming that the surface is the main origin of traps, Frank et al. successfully interpreted the power-law dependence of the short-circuit current density on the electron concentration based on an exponential DOS distribution.31 In addition, Nelson et al. showed that an exponential DOS distribution is in accordance with the dynamics of transient photocurrent and photovoltage.21 Through the literature studies we see that at least the trap states contributing to charge transport obey an exponential DOS distribution against the photovoltage (the quasi-Fermi level). Assuming that the bulk traps are significantly more than the surface ones, Bisquert et al. proposed that the bulk and the surface trap states may follow different DOS distributions, i.e. with different characteristic temperatures.32 However, this view, as an interesting alternative to the generally-accepted monoexponential DOS distribution, needs to be further proved.
Chemical capacitance is widely adopted to describe the DOS distribution of the intra-gap traps in semiconducting TiO2 layers,28,33 which can be measured experimentally by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),34–37 integration of photocurrent at differential voltage,38 cyclic voltammetry39 and time-resolved charge extraction (TRCE).40 For TRCE measurements, photogenerated electrons under a given photovoltage (Vph) are dumped out at specified timing by rapidly switching the DSSC from open- to short-circuit conditions, and the amount of extracted charges (Q) is plotted against Vph. TRCE studies have revealed the exponential Q–Vph dependence in the regime of Vph > 400 mV, which is in good accord with the results of electron transport and recombination dynamics.41,42 However, the monoexponential dependence is not the case in the relatively low Vph region. E.g., Peter et al. observed a significant deviation from exponential Q–Vph dependence for Vph < 400 mV.43 Hagfeldt et al. measured the Q–Vph plot over a wide voltage range (0–700 mV), and observed an exponential dependence for Vph > 360 mV, indicating the major roles of the corresponding trap states in electron transport.44 Interestingly, the semi-logarithmic Q–Vph plot in ref. 44 exhibits a linear dependence in 100–360 mV with a relatively small slope, which is suggestive of different behavior of the deep trap states.
In the present work, we have adopted TRCE to examine the DOS distribution of intra-gap traps and the dynamics of electron transport in DSSCs. The capacitance distribution over a wide range of Vph (40–650 mV) allows the contribution from the FTO electrode and the TiO2 layer to be separated, and hence the chemical capacitance and the DOS distribution to be accurately determined. The observed biexponential Vph-dependence of chemical capacitance (DOS) is successfully accounted for by a theoretical chemical capacitance derived within the framework of Fermi–Dirac statistics, which allows us to differentiate the deep and the shallow trap states with distinctly different characteristic temperatures. The roles of deep and shallow trap states in electron transport are discussed in terms of engineering the DOS distribution for efficient light-to-electricity conversion.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 DSSC preparation
In preparing the paste, hydroxypropyl cellulose (Aldrich) was added to diethylene glycol at a concentration of ∼10 wt%, which was added with P25 microspheres (TiO2 particles). After vigorous stirring, a homogeneous slurry was obtained, and was subsequently spread onto the FTO glass substrate (TEC-8, LOF) by the doctor-blade method with the TiO2 film thickness of ∼14 μm. After being dried in air, the films were heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 450 °C and then maintained for 30 min. The films cooled to 80 °C were sensitized in an ethanol solution of cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridy1-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719, 3 × 10−4 M, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) for 24 h. The counter electrodes were platinized FTO. The electrolyte was composed of LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.03 M), tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M), guanidine thiocyanate (GuNCS, 0.1 M) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII, 1 M) in an acetonitrile–valeronitrile binary solvent (5:1, v/v). The typical DSSC thus prepared exhibited a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 12.4 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 784 mV (see the ESI,† S1 for more details on device performance).

Fig. 1a schematically illustrates the TRCE setup. A pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) provided the actinic light pulses (530 ± 5 nm, 70 μs (full width at half maximum), 170 μJ per pulse). An analogous electric switch unit with an action speed of 10 ns and an intrinsic resistance of 5 Ω was set in the parallel connection with the DSSC device. A precise delay pulse generator (DG-535, Stanford Research Systems) was used to trigger, at specified timing, the DSSC device switching from open- to short-circuits. A digital oscilloscope (64Xs, Lecroy; input impedance, 1 MΩ) recorded the potential drop across the sampling resistance (50 Ω) and the switch unit in series connection (the actual sampling resistance was 55 Ω). Light pulses irradiated the DSSC device from the transparent FTO electrode side. Under open-circuit conditions, the oscilloscope measured the overall Vph decay kinetics. At specified timing, when the DSSC device was switched into the short circuit, the charge extraction was initiated under the corresponding Vph, and the specific charge extraction kinetics was recorded (Fig. 1b).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Chemical capacitance and density of states

Fig. 2a illustrates a representative charge-extraction kinetics, which is characterized by a “fast” and a “slow” component with distinctively different decay rates. The quantity of extracted charges (Q) can be readily obtained by the integration, Q = R−1∫Vphdt, where R and Vph stand for the sampling resistance (55 Ω) and the photovoltage, respectively. Fig. 2b presents the extracted charge quantities from the fast and the slow phases under different Vph (at corresponding extraction timing, cf.Fig. 1b). It is seen that the fast component exhibits a linear Q–Vph dependence, implying a constant capacitance that is attributed by the capacitance of the FTO electrode (CFTO).28 The CFTO value determined from the slope of the Q–Vph plot is 0.32 μF (1.28 μF cm−2), in well agreement with the EIS determined values of a few μF cm−2.45 Since the capacitance of a DSSC device is contributed by the CFTO and the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 layer, it is reasonable to relate the slow component of the Q–Vph plot (Fig. 2b) to the charges extracted from the chemical capacitance, which can be well described by a biexponential model function, (1)where Q and Vph are in μC and mV, respectively. Based on eqn (1), chemical capacitance (Cμ) can be obtained by taking the derivative dQ/dVph, (2)where Cμ and Vph are in μF and mV, respectively. Here, it is noteworthy that, despite a small pre-exponential factor, the first exponential component gives rise to a substantial contribution over the sum of two components (>5% for Vph > 420 mV, and increase rapidly with increasing Vph). In addition, as indicated by Fig. 2(b), the amount of charges extracted from CFTO (“fast”) is below 5% of that from Cμ (“slow”), implying that the inclusion of CFTO may not arouse any significant problem for the subsequent discussion on Cμ or the DOS. However, in analyzing the TRCE kinetics, the “fast” component has to be separated from the “slow” one, so as to extract the specific dynamics of trap-limited electron transport (vide infra).

(b) Plots of the extracted charges (Q) against Vph (corresponding to various extraction timings). Q was calculated by integrating the “fast” or the “slow” phases as shown in panel-a (see text for details). Solid lines were obtained by least-square fitting of the “fast” and the “slow” data (filled symbols), respectively, to linear and bi-exponential model functions. 
The DOS of intra-gap states is proportional to the chemical capacitance Cμ, DOS = Cμ/edS(1 − p), where d stands for the film thickness, S is the effective area of the photoanode, p is the porosity of the TiO2 layer, and e represents the unity charge.46 We could then obtain the DOS as a function of Vph. Fig. 3 illustrates the semi-logarithmic plots of Cμ and DOS versus Vph. The aforementioned biexponential Vph-dependence of chemical capacitance was theoretically predicted by Bisquert et al.32 These authors attributed the two exponential components, respectively, to the conduction-band capacitance under higher photovoltages and the chemical capacitance of intra-gap states under lower photovoltages. In the present work, we have obtained the Cμ and the DOS of the intra-gap states that are intrinsic to the TiO2 layer (Fig. 3), both of which exhibit biexponential dependence on the level of electron occupancy as measured by Vph. For the following reasons, we interpreted the biexponential Cμ–Vph dependence in terms of two different types of intra-gap trap states. (i) In the relatively high Vph regime (Fig. 3), the slope of the semi-logarithmic plot of Cμ ((48 meV)−1, corresponding to the curvature of the Cμ–Vph plot on linear scales) is about a half of that of the conduction band capacitance ((25.6 meV)−1, corresponding to the room-temperature kBT energy), indicating that the chemical capacitance is most likely originated from trap states rather than conduction band states. (ii) The typical conduction band edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 lies about ∼900 mV above the electrolyte redox potential. It had been shown that, when the quasi-Fermi level (EFn) is far enough below the bottom edge of the conduction band, the contribution from the conduction band to Cμ is negligible.32 In Fig. 3 when Vph exceeds 700 mV, Cμ varies linearly against Vph in the semi-logarithmic plot. Because EFn is far below the bottom of the conduction band, meaning little contribution from the conduction band, Cμ must originate from the intra-gap trap states rather than from the conduction band states. The biexponential DOS-Vph dependence seems to be contradictory to the generally acceptable monoexponential DOS distribution, which can be explained by the difference in the experimental means: intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) derives the DOS distribution indirectly from charge transport dynamics,31 whereas TRCE is capable of directly measuring the DOS distribution over a wide voltage range, irrespective of whether or not the trap states are involved in charge transport. In fact, the biexponential DOS distribution was also reported in ref. 44, where the semi-logarithmic Q–Vph plot showed two linear phases: the one over 360–700 mV was assigned to the trap states rather than the band states, however, the other one over 100–360 mV was not subjected to detailed discussion.
 Fig. 3  Semi-logarithmic plot of chemical capacitance (Cμ, left coordinate) and density of states (DOS, right coordinate) versus photovoltage (Vph). Dashed lines were calculated with the first and the second exponential terms of eqn (2) representing the shallow and the deep intra-gap states, respectively (see the text for details). 
Bulk trap states locating inside TiO2 particles can be associated with the chemical defects such as Ti3+(3d) and/or oxygen vacancies,47–49 and are considered to be completely shielded from the macroscopic electrical field.12–15 Surface trap states, which are not insufficiently screened from the field, are considered to be of physical origins, i.e. induced by the mutual coulombic attraction between the injected electrons and the cations in the electrolyte.29 Different trap structures must correspond to different depths in terms of the DOS distribution, however, it is rather hard to establish the correlation between the location (surface or bulk) and the energetics (shallow or deep). Therefore, we collectively grouped different trap states into the shallow and the deep ones, which are characterized by their distinctly different characteristic temperatures (vide infra). Nevertheless, as seen from Fig. 3, the chemical capacitance in the voltage regions of <350 mV and >700 mV, respectively, are dominated by the deep and the shallow trap states, while that in 350–700 mV depends on both types of trap states.
Within the framework of Fermi–Dirac distribution and under the Boltzmann and the absolute-zero approximations, the theoretical Cμ–Vph relation can be written as (ESI,† S2), (2′)where kB is Boltzmann's constant, e is the unit charge, TS and TD are characteristic temperatures of the shallow and the deep trap states, respectively, B1 and B2 are pre-exponential factors that are independent of Vph. Comparison of eqn (2′) to eqn (2) yields the characteristic kBT energy of 48 meV (kBTS) and 765 meV (kBTD), respectively, for the shallow and the deep trap states. The existence of two different characteristic temperatures, TS and TD, is in accord with the theoretical prediction in ref. 32.
3.2 Charge transport dynamics

Fig. 4a shows the TRCE kinetics curves at different extraction timings. For each kinetics, the faster component decays out completely within a few hundreds of microseconds, whereas the slower component decays from a few hundred microseconds to a few milliseconds. As mentioned above, the slow and fast components correspond to different processes, i.e. the discharge of CFTO and Cμ, respectively. Therefore, in order to study the dynamics of electron extraction in the photoanode, the slow component was separated from the fast one to be analyzed. Fig. 4b shows the Vph-dependence of the apparent decay time constant of the slow component (τapp) derived by the exponential curve-fitting of the TRCE kinetics in Fig. 4a. It is evident that τapp varies little in the regime Vph < 300 mV, whereas it is substantially prolonged in the regime of Vph > 300 mV. In view of the fact that a larger Vph corresponds to a higher electron occupancy level and thereby faster electron transport, it is rather puzzling to see the rapid increase of τapp in the regime Vph > 300 mV. This anti-intuitive τapp–Vph dependence can be clarified in view of the followings: for a DSSC subjected to TRCE measurements, the electron occupancy level varies at different Vph or at different charge extraction timings. To achieve an equal size of photovoltage decrease, more electrons have to be extracted for a higher level of electron occupation. This together with the rapid increase of the DOS upon increasing Vph (Fig. 3) lead to a prolonged τapp for completely dumping out the trapped electrons.
 Fig. 4  (a) TRCE kinetics with the extraction timing brought to zero. The respective extraction timings along the arrow are 20 ms, 24 ms, 34 ms, 48 ms, 97 ms, 200 ms, 370 ms, 725 ms, 1.56 s, 3.28 s, 6.51 s and 11 s. (b) The apparent extraction time constants of the “slow” phases (τapp, filled circles) derived by curve fitting to the TRCE kinetics in panel-a, and the characteristic extraction time (τc, open circles) defined by dividing τapp with the accordingly extracted charges (τapp/Q, meaning the temporal duration for dumping out same amount of charges). The solid curve was obtained by fitting the τc–Vph plot to eqn (3′) (see the text for details). 
Here, we define the characteristic extraction time (τc) by dividing τapp (in ms) with Q (in μC), implying a temporal duration for dumping out the same amount of trapped charges. The plot of τc against Vph then clearly shows faster charge extraction under a higher level of electron occupation (Fig. 4b). It is interesting to see that τc drops rapidly for Vph < 300 mV, whereas it remains nearly unchanged for Vph > 300 mV, which means that the transport of deeply trapped electrons is relatively slow and highly dependent on Vph, whereas the transport of shallow electrons is relatively fast and almost independent of Vph. It is worth noting that the charge transport time constant (τtr) determined by transient photocurrent (TPC) or IMPS decreases upon increasing Vph,19,31,50 which is understandable in view of the fact that these measurements are operated in the so-called perturbation mode: the DSSC devices are continuous-wave (CW) light illuminated or potentiostatically biased to maintain a high level electron occupancy, while the electrical signals of interest are induced by a weak light flash or by modulating the CW light. In contrast, TRCE operates without pre-filling the trap states and, therefore, it measures the process of completely dumping out the trapped electrons. Nevertheless, the above defined characteristic extraction time (τc) is parallel to the charge transport time constant (τtr) in a sense that both of them decrease upon increasing Vph.
3.3 Influence of the DOS on charge transport
Within the multiple-trap framework, the charge transport time constant (τtr) can be expressed as (ESI,† S3) (3)where τcbtr represents the time constant for free electron transport in the conduction band, T and T0 (T0 > T, vide infra) stand for room temperature (300 K) and the characteristic temperature of the intra-gap states, respectively. It is worth noting that eqn (3) invokes the assumption that the distribution of trap states for charge transport is monoexponentially dependent on the photovoltage.31
As discussed in the last section, the characteristic charge extraction time (τc) derived from the TRCE kinetics is parallel to the charge transport time constant (τtr). Therefore, eqn (3) also holds for the τc–Vph relation, (3′)where τcbc is the characteristic time constant for the transport of electrons agitated into the conduction band. Fitting the τc–Vph plot shown in Fig. 4b to the model function of eqn (3′) gives rise to (4)where τc and Vph are in ms and mV, respectively.
Comparison of eqn (4) to eqn (3′) yields the characteristic time constant of electron transport, τcbc = 0.177 ms, as well as the characteristic temperature for the trap states, T0 = 531 K. This characteristic time constant is comparable to the τcbtr determined by the use of alternative methods,34,46i.e. a few hundred microseconds to a few milliseconds. On the other hand, the characteristic temperature of the intra-gap states derived from the τc–Vph plot corresponds to a thermodynamic energy of 46 meV (kBT0), which agrees with the literature values.32,51 Importantly, this kBT0 energy is comparable to the kBTS energy (48 meV) derived from the Cμ–Vph plot shown in Fig. 3 for the shallow trap states, implying that electron transport in the photoanode is dominated by the shallow trap states rather than by the deep ones. This point of view is corroborated by comparing the amount of shallow trap states to that of deep ones: assuming that the band-edge energy of TiO2 is 900 meV above the electrolyte redox potential (Ecb–Eredox), the amount of different types of trap states can be estimated by integrating the Cμ–Vph function (eqn (2)) across the band gap (0–900 mV). It turns out that the shallow trap states (2.5 × 1015) is 49 folds of the deep trap states (5.1 × 1013), which again suggests the predominant role of shallow trap states in electron transport.
The characteristic extraction time, τc, accounts for the time duration required for extraction of 1 μC charges (∼6 × 1012 electrons). Therefore, an inverted τc implicitly means the photocurrent, and the inverted τcbc represents an upper-limit photocurrent, i.e. Imax = 1 μC/0.177 ms = 5.6 mA. Dividing Imax with the effective photoanode area of 0.26 cm2 yields the upper-limit of the photocurrent density, Jmax = 21.7 mA cm−2. Note that Jmax is estimated under the assumption of infinitive driving potential, i.e. most of the electrons are transported in the conduction band. In reality, the short-circuit current density of JSC = 12.4 mA cm−2 for the targeted DSSC device is about 57% of the Jmax. Such considerably large difference is due to the electrons trapped in the intra-gap states, which undergo the competition of effective charge transport with charge recombination. The chemical diffusion coefficient (Dn) is known to be inversely proportional to the electron transport time constant,50i.e. Dn = d2/(2.35τtr) with d representing the TiO2 film thickness. In view of the τc-to-τtr comparability, it is obviously seen from Fig. 4b that the electrons in the deep trap states (corresponding to lower Vph) bear relatively low chemical diffusion coefficients, and thereby relatively high charge recombination probability.
4. Conclusions
Based on the TRCE analyses of working DSSC devices, we have separated the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 photoanode from the parasitic capacitance of the FTO electrode, and have determined the biexponential photovoltage dependence of the DOS of intra-gap traps, which can be well accounted for by the theoretical chemical capacitance derived within the framework of Fermi–Dirac distribution. On the other hand, the characteristic charge extraction time (τc) is shown to decrease exponentially upon increasing photovoltage. In addition, the characteristic energy determined from the TRCE kinetics (46 meV) is in good agreement with that derived from the DOS distribution (48 meV). The results strongly support the mechanism of multiple-trap limited electron transport in the TiO2 photoanode of DSSCs.
We show that the biexponential DOS distribution is originated, respectively, from the shallow trap states (above 700 meV) and the deep ones (below 300 meV) with the characteristic energy of 48 meV (kBTS) and 765 meV (kBTD), respectively. Because the shallow trap states are found to be in a substantially larger amount than the deep trap states, and the kBTS energy of shallow trap states is comparable to the kBT0 energy of the overall electron trap states (46 meV), the shallow trap states must dominate the electron transport in the photoanode. In contrast, the deep trap states contribute little to photocurrent because of the substantially large kBTD energy of deep trap states. Furthermore, we show that the actual short-circuit photocurrent density of the targeted device (JSC = 12.4 mA cm−2) is substantially lower than the theoretical upper-limit (Jmax = 21.7 mA cm−2), suggesting a substantial margin to improve the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency, which may be brought about by material engineering to reduce the intra-gap trap states, especially the deep ones.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic layout of the time-dependent charge extraction (TRCE) setup. (b) Representative kinetics trace of the overall photovoltage (Vph) for an open-circuit DSSC device (thicker black line), and the charge extraction kinetics at indicated timing (thinner color lines) recorded by fast switching of the DSSC into short circuit.	 
	(1)
	(2)

 	Fig. 2  (a) A representative charge extraction kinetics at the extraction timing of 20 ms. Notations “fast” and “slow” refer to two distinctive temporal evolution phases of the TRCE kinetics. (b) Plots of the extracted charges (Q) against Vph (corresponding to various extraction timings). Q was calculated by integrating the “fast” or the “slow” phases as shown in panel-a (see text for details). Solid lines were obtained by least-square fitting of the “fast” and the “slow” data (filled symbols), respectively, to linear and bi-exponential model functions.	 

 	Fig. 3  Semi-logarithmic plot of chemical capacitance (Cμ, left coordinate) and density of states (DOS, right coordinate) versus photovoltage (Vph). Dashed lines were calculated with the first and the second exponential terms of eqn (2) representing the shallow and the deep intra-gap states, respectively (see the text for details).	 
	(2′)

 	Fig. 4  (a) TRCE kinetics with the extraction timing brought to zero. The respective extraction timings along the arrow are 20 ms, 24 ms, 34 ms, 48 ms, 97 ms, 200 ms, 370 ms, 725 ms, 1.56 s, 3.28 s, 6.51 s and 11 s. (b) The apparent extraction time constants of the “slow” phases (τapp, filled circles) derived by curve fitting to the TRCE kinetics in panel-a, and the characteristic extraction time (τc, open circles) defined by dividing τapp with the accordingly extracted charges (τapp/Q, meaning the temporal duration for dumping out same amount of charges). The solid curve was obtained by fitting the τc–Vph plot to eqn (3′) (see the text for details).
