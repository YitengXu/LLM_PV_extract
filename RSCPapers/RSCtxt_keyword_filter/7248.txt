    , Accepted 11th April 2005First published on 27th April 2005AbstractThrough cooperative interactions, each of the three organic dyes utilized achieved improved sensitizing abilities on nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes in co-sensitization over single-dye-sensitization, which led to a wide (400–700 nm) and highly efficient (exceeding 70%) photocurrent action spectrum in triple-dye-sensitization and an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.5%
				(AM1.5, 80 mW cm−2), the highest η to date for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on the co-sensitization of plural organic dyes, fully demonstrating the potential of co-sensitization in DSSC applications.
Dye-sensitized nanocrystalline semiconductor solar cells (DSSCs) based on Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have been actively investigated over the past 15 years since O’Regan and Grätzel’s report in 1991.1–4 Compared with Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, organic sensitizer dyes generally possess larger molar extinction coefficients and can be prepared and purified more easily and economically, therefore, exhibit promising potential in DSSC applications.5–8 However, the sharp and narrow absorption bands of organic dyes seriously impairs their light harvesting capabilities, and as a result, the simultaneous adsorption on TiO2 electrodes of the plural dyes, which have different absorption wavelengths, the so called co-sensitization, was utilized to broaden the absorption spectrum.9 Though many combinations of organic sensitizer dyes were studied in the context of co-sensitization, success is still very limited.9–14 The overall photoelectric conversion efficiencies of the DSSCs based on plural organic dyes did not exceed 3.5% under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), and in most cases the dye component having the most potent sensitization ability in the dye combination behaved less efficiently in co-sensitization than in single-dye sensitization, which partly accounted for the unsatisfactory photoelectric conversion efficiencies obtained in co-sensitization.9–14 In this study, three organic dyes, a merocyanine dye (Y), a hemicyanine dye (R), and a squarylium cyanine dye (B) named after their colors respectively (Scheme 1), were combined to co-sensitize TiO2 electrodes. It was found that all three dyes behaved better in triple-dye sensitization than in single-dye sensitization, consequently a high photoelectric conversion efficiency up to 6.5% was achieved, fully demonstrating the potential of co-sensitization in DSSC applications.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of the three dyes. 
The three dyes absorb light of different wavelengths with absorption maxima at 380 nm for Y, 535 nm for R, and 642 nm for B, respectively, in methanol solutions (Fig. 1). Their molar extinction coefficients at absorption maxima are 3.0 × 104
				(Y), 7.2 × 104
				(R), and 23.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1
				(B), much higher than those of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes (ca. 1.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1).2 Upon adsorption on TiO2 electrodes, all the absorption bands were broadened greatly, and a strong shoulder peak appeared at 600 nm for B, suggesting the formation of a dye aggregate, particularly for B, of which the H-type aggregate formed unambiguously.9
				(For clarity, arbitrary units for the absorbance are used in Fig. 1. The absorption spectra of dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes with true absorbance are shown in Figure A of the ESI.†) The co-adsorption of the three dyes on TiO2 electrodes led to an efficient light harvesting over a wide spectrum region covering the whole visible and part of near-IR, a desirable feature for solar cells. It is noted that the shoulder peak intensity of B originating from the H-aggregate decreased significantly with respect to the main peak of B originating from the monomer, indicating that the presence of Y and R restrained the aggregation of B remarkably.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of TiO2 electrodes sensitized by the individual dye alone (Y/TiO2, R/TiO2 and B/TiO2) and by their combination (Y+R+B/TiO2, the molar ratio of Y : R : B in the dye solutions was 10 : 20 : 1). The absorption spectra of the three dyes in methanol are also included. 
Based on the ground state oxidation potentials (0.84 V, 0.80 V, and 0.72 V vs. SCE for Y, R, and B, respectively) and 0–0 transition energies (2.94 eV, 2.20 eV, and 1.92 eV for Y, R, and B, respectively, calculated from the wavelength where the normalized absorption and fluorescence spectra intersect),2 the oxidation potentials of Y, R, and B in their excited states are estimated to be −2.1 V, −1.4 V, and −1.2 V vs. SCE, respectively, far more negative than the conduction band edge potential of the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes (ca. −0.8 V vs. SCE),15 indicating that the electron injection processes from the excited dyes into the TiO2 conduction band are energetically permitted. This is confirmed by the photocurrent efficiencies of the three dyes shown in Fig. 2
				(A), where the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) are plotted as the function of wavelength.2 The TiO2 electrodes sensitized by Y, R, and B alone exhibited effective photoelectric conversion abilities in the regions 400–500 nm, 500–600 nm, and 600–700 nm, respectively. As a result, their combination as sensitizers gave rise to a wide photoelectric response spectrum (Fig. 2
				(A), Y+R+B/TiO2). Though the molar ratio of the three dyes was 10 : 20 : 1 (Y : R : B) in the dye solution, the dye ratio of Y : R : B desorbed from the electrode was 4.1 : 1.0 : 1.3 (see Table 1 and Table A in the ESI†), indicating the stronger adsorbing abilities of Y and B than that of R, which probably results from the smaller size of Y (allowing its entrance to the small pores in the electrode) and the presence of two carboxyl anchoring groups in B.
 Fig. 2  Photocurrent action spectra of TiO2 electrodes (A) sensitized by the individual dye alone (Y/TiO2, R/TiO2 and B/TiO2) and by their combination (Y+R+B/TiO2); (B) sensitized by the individual dye alone with deoxycholic acid (DCA) adsorbed simultaneously (Y+DCA/TiO2, R+DCA/TiO2 and B+DCA/TiO2); and (C) sensitized by the double dyes (Y+R/TiO2, R+B/TiO2 and Y+B/TiO2). The total dye(s) concentrations in the dye solutions were kept at 0.5 mM. The molar ratios of the dyes in solution were 10 : 20 : 1 for Y+R+B/TiO2, 10 : 20 for Y+R/TiO2, 20 : 1 for R+B/TiO2, 10 : 1 for Y+B/TiO2. The concentrations of DCA were fixed at 1.0 mM in the dye solutions.

It is worthy of note that the three dyes all exhibited higher IPCEs in their corresponding spectrum regions in co-sensitization than in single-dye sensitization, despite the fact that the adsorbed amount of each kind of dye decreased in the co-sensitization cases (see Table A in the ESI†). Such a cooperative effect may result from two possibilities. First, the co-adsorption of the three kinds of dyes may result in a more compact coverage of the TiO2 surface, which blocks the approach of I3− in the electrolyte to the TiO2 surface, and therefore decreases the dark current originating from the combination of injected electrons with I3− ions. Secondly, the aggregation behaviors of the individual dyes may be varied in co-adsorption conditions so that their injection efficiencies take positive changes. The sharpening and narrowing occurred for the photoelectric response band coming from the contribution of B (650–750 nm) may reflect the suppression of B aggregation, which is in line with the observation in Fig. 1, and supports the second explanation. The decrease in the adsorbed amount of B in the co-sensitization did not favor its aggregation either.
It is well known that the simultaneous adsorption of deoxycholic acid (DCA) onto a TiO2 surface with organic sensitizer dyes can improve the photocurrent efficiencies (IPCEs) of the organic sensitizers due to a blocking effect which stops the dark current and/or the isolating effect which suppresses dye aggregation.9,16Fig. 2
				(B) indicates that DCA can also improve the IPCEs of R and B remarkably, suggesting that in triple-dye-sensitization Y and B or Y and R may serve as DCA for R or B, respectively. The “DCA effect” was also observed in double-dye-sensitized solar cells (Fig. 2
				(C)), where the IPCEs of each dye were improved over the single-dye sensitization cases.
Besides the “DCA effect”, we cannot exclude energy and/or electron transfer among the three dyes when they closely contact each other on the TiO2 surface. It has been recognized that the energy and/or electron transfer among different dyes will make all of them exhibit the electron injection efficiency of the dye having the smallest band-gap.9 Owing to the highly efficient electron injection efficiency of B (approaching unity when one considers the loss of the incident light caused by the conducting glass substrate) in the co-sensitization cases, the energy and/or electron transfer, if any, will not deteriorate the electron injection efficiencies of Y and R to a detectable extent.
It is found that the IPCEs of the co-sensitized electrodes depended greatly on the ratio of the three dyes on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 3 and Table 1), and the electrode soaked in a solution of the three dyes with the molar ratio of 10 : 10 : 1 (Y : R : B) achieved the best IPCE curve over the wavelength region 400–800 nm, of which the dye ratio on the TiO2 surface was detected to be 5.0 : 1.0 : 1.5 after dye desorption.
 Fig. 3  Photocurrent action spectra of the TiO2 electrodes co-sensitized by the three dyes at different dye ratios. The total dye(s)’ concentrations in dyeing solutions were kept at 0.5 mM. The ratios of Y : R : B in dyeing solutions were 10 : 10 : 5, 10 : 10 : 1, 10 : 30 : 1, and 10 : 50 : 1, respectively. 
The photovoltaic performances including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor (ff), and the overall power conversion efficiency (η) of solar cells based on the three dyes are collected in Table 1, from which the potent ability of the co-sensitization approach in improving the efficiencies of the solar cells is clearly demonstrated. The power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells were affected remarkably by the components of the dye solutions. Also, as expected, the power conversion efficiencies depended greatly on the concentration of t-butylpyridine in the electrolyte, an additive often used in DSSCs for improving Voc and optimizing η.3 As a result, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.5% was obtained (Fig. 4 inset and Table 1), representing up to now the most efficient DSSC based on the co-sensitization of plural organic sensitizer dyes. The short-circuit photocurrent obtained in the most efficient solar cell was 15.8 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the calculated value (16.4 mA cm−2) from the overlap integral of the corresponding IPCE curve (Figs. 3 and 4) with AM1.5 Global solar spectrum (normalized to 80 mW/cm2).

In summary, we demonstrate in this study a remarkable promotion of Jsc and η of the solar cells by co-sensitization of plural organic sensitizer dyes. The “DCA effect”, involving both the blockage of I3− ions at the TiO2 surface and the restriction of dye aggregation, play an important role in achieving the cooperation of the three dyes upon TiO2 sensitization.
Experimental
The three dyes, Y, R, and B, were synthesized according to the reported procedures17–20 and characterized by 1H NMR, EI-MS and MALDI-TOF MS. The TiO2 paste (Nanoxide-T from Solaronix, Switzerland) was coated by means of the doctor blade technique on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass, followed by sintering at 450 °C in air for 30 min.2 The thickness of the TiO2 film was 9 µm determined by a Dektak 3 Profilometer. The obtained TiO2 electrodes were dipped in a 0.5 mM dye solution with or without the presence of 1 mM DCA in t-BuOH/CH3CN (1 : 1 volume ratio) for 8 h at room temperature and rinsed with CH3CN and dried under a stream of hot air. A sandwich-type solar cell was constructed by introducing the redox electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1–0.5 M t-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) in methoxypropionitrile between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a counter electrode of Pt-coated FTO conducting glass. The dye-sensitized TiO2 film was illuminated through the conducting glass support and the effective irradiated area was 0.175 cm2. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cell was taken from a computer-controlled digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) under illumination from a AM1.5 Global simulated light (80 mW cm−2) from an Oriel 91192 Solar Simulator. During the measurement of the photocurrent action spectra, the solar cell was irradiated by monochromatic light, obtained from a 500 W Xe lamp in combination with a SpectraPro-150 monochromator (Acton Research Co.), in the range 400–800 nm at 10 nm intervals, and the generated short-circuit photocurrents were recorded on a model 283A potentiostat/galvanostat. The incident monochromatic light intensity was measured with a S370 single-channel optometer equipped with a Model 262 flat response sensor head (Graseby Optronics). The electrolyte of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.3 M DMPImI in methoxypropionitrile was used in the IPCE measurements.
