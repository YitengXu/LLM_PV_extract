    , Accepted 25th October 2018First published on 27th October 2018AbstractAn effective strategy of “synthesizing an electron-acceptor composite (ZITI-m) by one-pot reaction” to improve photovoltaic performance is proposed. The ZITI-m composite is synthesized by one-pot Knoevenagel reaction of ZIT-2CHO and a mixture of INCN-2F and I-a, from which asymmetrical ZITI-3F and symmetrical ZITI-4F are separated. J71:ZITI-m-based OSC shows the highest PCE of 13.65 ± 0.13% with remarkable PCE of 13.85% than those based on J71:ZITI-3F (12.97 ± 0.15%) and J71:ZITI-4F (13.02 ± 0.13%) blends. The effect of acceptor ratio in the composite on OPV performance indicates that all PCEs of composite system are higher than those of the materials based on pure acceptors with a broad composition tolerance, which is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the ternary blend system.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), especially with an acceptor (A)–donor (D)–acceptor (A) configuration,1 power conversion efficiency has been rapidly increased to 13%,2 which was inconceivable ten years ago,3 and this confirms the bright future of the organic photovoltaic technique. For A–D–A-type FREA, the electron-rich and bulky fused-ring core typically designed by replacing the benzene ring of indacenodithiophene with naphthalene,4 thieno[2,3-b]thiophene,5 fluorene,6 carbazole,7 benzodithiophene,8etc. is crucial for intramolecular charge transfer property and phase separation in blend films. The electron-deficient terminals determine the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which is the key for the trade-off between charge separation and energy loss.9
Among various electron-accepting moieties,10 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) is the most frequently used compound for the design of FREAs, as represented by ITIC.11 Chemical modifications of INCN provide an opportunity to further increase photovoltaic performance because the electronic structure and packing behavior of FREAs can be effectively tuned (Fig. 1). With INCN-Me and INCN-2Me moieties possessing one or two very weak electron-donating methyl groups,12 Hou et al. reported FREAs denoted as IT-M and IT-DM. Compared with ITIC, IT-M and IT-DM show successively elevated LUMO energy levels and hypsochromically shifted absorptions. An average PCE of 11.48 ± 0.25% is achieved by PBDB-T:IT-M-based OSCs with an improved open-circuit voltage (Voc). With INCN-F and INCN-2F moieties possessing one or two electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms,13,14 Zhan et al. developed FREAs, INIC2 and INIC3, with a π-extended indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene) core. Compared with INIC1 using INCN as terminal, INCN2 and INCN3 with INCN-F and INCN-2F as terminal show deepened LUMO energy levels, bathochromically shifted absorptions, and increased crystallinity. By matching a large-bandgap polymer donor, FTAZ, INIC2-based OSCs show the best photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 11.2%. With INCN-2Cl possessing two chlorine atoms,8e Forrest et al. reported a small-bandgap FREA, BT-CIC, with which they fabricated semi-transparent OSCs15 with an average PCE of 7.1 ± 0.1% at an average visible transmittance of 43 ± 2%. Quite recently, Chen et al. systematically investigated the halogen substituents of FREAs on the OPV performance and achieved an average PCE of 11.88% for an FDICTF-Br acceptor having INCN-Br terminals.16 Among various INCN analogues, mono-substituted INCN derivatives are special, which are mixtures consisting of two isomers. Accordingly, the corresponding FREAs are also isomeric mixtures. Despite the good device performance, whether and how the mixtures affect the final OPV performance are not well understood so far.

Recently, we developed a new fused-ring core, dithienocyclopentaindenoindene (ZIT), designed by linking 2,7-dithienyl substituents and indenoindene17 with the smallest methylene groups and the corresponding FREA featuring a large unoccupied π-surface based on indeno[1,2-b]thiophene-INCN-F combination.18 ZITI acceptor shows excellent compatibility with large-bandgap polymer donors. Since INCN-F is a mixture of I-a and I-b isomers (Fig. 1), we found that ZITI acceptor material is a composite consisting of ZITI-bb and ZITI-ab isomers. Furthermore, OPV performances based on pure ZITI-bb (12.46 ± 0.15%) and ZITI-aa acceptors (9.83 ± 0.14%) are lower than that based on ZITI composite (13.04 ± 0.14%). Because asymmetrical ZITI-ab cannot be prepared or separated in pure form, it is hard to distinguish the origin of the higher performance of ZITI composite. In this study, we deliberately synthesized an electron-acceptor composite ZITI-m by a one-pot reaction between ZIT-2CHO and I-a (considering higher Voc of ZITI-aa than that of ZITI-bb) and INCN-2F (to obtain distinguishable molecular polarity) to investigate the effect of the mixture on OPV performance. ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F can be purified from ZITI-m composite. ZITI-3F, ZITI-4F, and ZITI-m show high molar extinction coefficients (ε) and maximum absorptions at 753, 768, and 760 nm in thin films, leading to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.50, 1.47, and 1.48 eV, respectively. Using the wide-bandgap polymer J71 as the electron donor, the optimized devices for J71:ZITI-3F and J71:ZITI-4F blends yield comparable PCEs of 12.97 ± 0.15% and 13.02 ± 0.13% with distinguishing Voc values of 0.90 vs. 0.85 V and Jsc values of 20.67 vs. 21.30 mA cm−2. In contrast, J71:ZITI-m-based OSC shows very high PCEavg of 13.65 ± 0.13% with simultaneously improved photovoltaic parameters. Furthermore, the impact of ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F ratio in composites on photovoltaic performance is systematically investigated, which shows a broad composition tolerance. In contrast to synthesizing pure molecule ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F, ZITI-m composite synthesized via one-pot reaction is easier. Compared with the traditional procedures of fabricating ternary devices, namely, mixing three pure materials, we envision that one-pot synthesis of composite materials can easily combine advantages of binary and ternary OPVs.
2. Results and discussion
The synthesis of ZITI-m is shown in Scheme 1. Compound ZITI-m is synthesized by the Knoevenagel reaction of ZIT-2CHO and a mixture of INCN-2F and I-a (7:3 weight ratio) in 55% yield. According to typical hydrogen signals at δ 8.71 and 8.55 ppm for ZITI-3F and δ 8.55 ppm for ZITI-4F, the molar ratio of both ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F is estimated to be 1:1. ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F can be separated from ZITI-m composite. ZITI-3F, ZITI-4F, and ZITI-m show good solubility in commonly used device-processing solvents including chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. According to thermal gravity analysis, ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F show excellent thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures of 317 and 321 °C at 5% weight loss (Fig. S2, ESI†).

ZITI-3F, ZITI-4F, and ZITI-m show maximum absorptions at 712, 716, and 714 nm with extinction coefficients of 2.23 × 105, 2.46 × 105, and 2.43 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively, in chloroform solution (Fig. S1†). The thin films of ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F exhibit maximum absorption peaks at 753 and 768 nm, which bathochromically shift by 41 and 52 nm compared with those in solutions (Fig. 2a). The optical bandgaps of ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F are calculated to be 1.50 and 1.47 eV according to the absorption onsets at 823 and 846 nm, respectively. ZITI-m exhibits maximum absorption at 760 nm and Eoptg of 1.48 eV, which is in accordance with its mixture nature. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were employed to evaluate the energy-level alignment of ZITI-3F, ZITI-4F, and ZITI-m (Fig. S1†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are calculated from onsets of oxidation and reduction processes that are calibrated by using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV under vacuum energy level). The HOMO energy levels of ZITI-3F, ZITI-4F, and ZITI-m are similar: −5.64, −5.66, and −5.65 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels decrease from ZITI-3F to ZITI-m and ZITI-4F: −3.76, −3.77, and −3.81 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b).

To investigate the photovoltaic potentials of ZITI-3F, ZITI-4F and ZITI-m composites, OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/J71:acceptors/PNDIT-F3N/Al, where the large-bandgap polymer J71 was used as the electron donor due to its complementary absorption with these acceptors. The devices were optimized by varying the donor/acceptor weight ratios, thermal annealing conditions, and active layer thickness, and the results are summarized in Tables S2–S7.† The best donor/acceptor weight ratio is 1:1 (w/w); when chloroform is used as the processing solvent, the total concentration is 18 mg mL−1, and the optimized thickness is ca. 110 nm. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, after thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min, the optimized devices for J71:ZITI-3F and J71:ZITI-4F blends deliver similar average PCEs of 12.97 ± 0.15% and 13.02 ± 0.13% with Voc values of 0.89 ± 0.005 and 0.85 ± 0.006 V, Jsc values of 20.39 ± 0.29 and 21.28 ± 0.26 mA cm−2, and FF values of 71 ± 0.82% and 72 ± 0.79%, respectively. Voc of J71:ZITI-3F-based OSC is larger than that of the J71:ZITI-4F-based one, which can be due to different LUMO levels. Jsc of the J71:ZITI-4F blend film is higher than that of J71:ZITI-3F, which can be ascribed to the slight bathochromic shift in absorption. When the ZITI-m composite is synthesized by a one-pot reaction, a higher performance is obtained with average PCE of 13.65 ± 0.13% and remarkable PCE of 13.85% with balanced photovoltaic parameters of Voc (0.87 ± 0.006 V), Jsc (21.49 ± 0.29 mA cm−2), and FF (73 ± 0.88%). Voc of the device based on the J71:ZITI-m blend lies between those of J71:ZITI-3F and J71:ZITI-4F ones. The higher Jsc and FF values of the J71:ZITI-m-based device are in accordance with those of J71:ZITI-4F blend. To further investigate the effect of these nominal ternary blend systems, we maintained the D:A ratio of 1:1 (A1 = ZITI-3F, A2 = ZITI-4F) and changed the ratios of A1 and A2. We found that all PCEs of ternary blend systems are higher than those of the binary systems (Table S1†), exhibiting a broad compositional tolerance throughout the blend ratios from 1:0.4:0.6 to 1:0.6:0.4 with high PCEs over 13.6%.

From the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3b), we found that the three devices show broad and strong photon responses from 300 to 860 nm with maximum values over 80% from 540 to 800 nm. The Jsc values are also integrated from EQE curves. The corresponding Jsc values of the optimized J71:ZITI-3F- and J71:ZITI-4F-based devices are 20.07 and 20.88 mA cm−2. The EQE value of the J71:ZITI-m-based device is higher across the region of 500–800 nm, giving rise to the highest calculated Jsc value of 21.13 mA cm−2 because of the similar absorption and high photon response from 500–800 nm to that of J71:ZITI-4F blend film. The EQE spectra were consistent with the results from J–V measurements with a small 2–3% error.
We applied hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and electron-only devices with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al to explore the charge transport property; the corresponding data are summarized in Tables 1 and S1.† The electron and hole mobilities of J71:ZITI-3F and J71:ZITI-4F blend films are calculated to be 1.57 × 10−4 and 1.86 × 10−4 (μe) and 3.96 × 10−4 and 3.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh) with mobility ratios (μh/μe) of 2.52 and 2.06, respectively. In contrast, the electron and hole mobilities of the J71:ZITI-m blend film are calculated to be 1.97 × 10−4 and 2.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, leading to the most balanced mobility ratio (μh/μe) of 1.15, which agrees well with enhanced Jsc and FF.
To investigate charge generation and extraction processes among the three devices, photocurrent analysis was performed. We measured the current density at different light intensities to study the carrier recombination under short-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 3c, all the devices display almost the same relationship of Jsc ∝ P0.95. The high slope implicates weak bimolecular recombination and effective carrier extraction. In addition, photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the cells after annealing is measured to investigate the efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge collection. The ratio of Jph/Jsat can reflect exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency, where Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density. At high reverse voltage (Veff = 2.0 V), Jph reaches saturation (Jsat); for the devices based on the J71:ZITI-3F, J71:ZITI-4F, and J71:ZITI-m blends, Jsat = 22.22, 22.65 and 22.70 mA cm−2 at the point of Veff = 2.0 V. The values of Jph/Jsat under their short-circuit conditions are 93%, 94% and 95% for the devices based on the J71:ZITI-3F, J71:ZITI-4F, and J71:ZITI-m blends, respectively (Fig. 3d). The slightly higher value of Jph/Jsat for the J71:ZITI-m-based device indicates better charge extraction and collection efficiency, which contributes to the highest Jsc value.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) under typing-mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to study the superficial and bulk morphologies of the active layers. As shown in AFM images (Fig. 4), J71:ZITI-3F and J71:ZITI-4F blend films show very smooth surfaces with nearly the same root mean-square surface (RMS) roughness values of 0.85 and 0.84 nm, respectively. For J71:ZITI-m blend film, RMS almost showed no change (0.88 nm). In TEM images (Fig. 4), all these blend films present refined textures of fibril type in a small length scale, indicating continuous phase separation, which is consistent with the AFM images. 2D GIXD scattering images and the corresponding in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) line cut profiles are shown in Fig. 5. Both ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F neat films show a strong π–π stacking peak at 1.81 Å−1 (π–π stacking distance of 3.47 Å) along the OOP direction and a sharp alkyl stacking packing at 0.32 Å−1 along the in-plane (IP) direction, suggesting the good structure ordering of ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F. For the blend films, the π–π stacking distance and alkyl stacking packing of J71:ZITI-m blend film show negligible differences for J71:ZITI-3F and J71:ZITI-4F. For J71:ZITI-4F and J71:ZITI-3F binary blends, the out-of-plane (OOP) coherence lengths (CCL) are 4.83 nm and 4.85 nm, whereas the CCL value increases to 5.07 nm for the J71:ZITI-m blends, suggesting improvement in material crystallinity. The improved crystallinity of J71:ZITI-m can be ascribed to higher FF. All thin films exhibit strong face-on orientation, which is beneficial for charge transport.

3. Conclusions
We designed and synthesized a ZITI-m composite consisting of ZITI-3F and ZITI-4F by a one-pot reaction. J71:ZITI-3F- and J71:ZITI-4F-based devices show comparable PCEs of 12.97 ± 0.15% and 13.02 ± 0.13%, respectively. To our great delight, J71:ZITI-m-based OSC combines the individual advantages J71:ZITI-3F- and J71:ZITI-4F-based devices, giving a very high PCE of 13.65 ± 0.13%. The Voc value of J71:ZITI-m-based OSC lies between those of ZITI-3F- and ZITI-4F-based ones due to the electronic alloy nature of ZITI-m composite. The higher Jsc value of J71:ZITI-m-based OSC is consistent with broadened absorption as compared to that of J71:ZITI-3F blend. Moreover, FF of ZITI-m-based device is the highest compared to those of ZITI-3F- and ZITI-4F-based ones due to the most balanced charge transport property. Thus, the high performance of ZITI-m composite can be due to the synergistic effect of the formed ternary blend19 and the device is among the best fullerene-free ternary solar cells.20 Compared with the traditional ternary strategy of high material and device complexity,21 this “one-pot synthesized composite” strategy is much more practical; also, it provides an insightful view on FREA design and will promote the development of OSCs.
4. Experimental
Materials and general methods
All reactions involving air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under a positive pressure of nitrogen. Unless stated otherwise, starting materials were obtained from Adamas, Aldrich, or J&K and were used without further purification. Anhydrous THF and toluene were distilled over Na/benzophenone prior to use. Anhydrous DMF was distilled over CaH2 prior to use. Compound ZIT-CHO was prepared according to published procedures.181H and 13C NMR spectra were measured with Bruker Avance 400 or Bruker Avance 600 spectrometers. Chemical shifts for hydrogens are reported in parts per million (ppm, scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the residual protons in the NMR solvent (CDCl3: 7.26). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts for carbons are reported in parts per million (ppm, scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the carbon resonance of the solvent (CDCl3: 77.2). The data are presented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet and/or multiple resonances, br = broad), coupling constant in hertz (Hz), and integration. MALDI measurements were performed with MALDI-FT 9.4 T, Bruker solariX, or MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Autoflex III. Elemental analyses were performed with a Flash EA 1112 Series from ThermoQuest. UV-vis was recorded with Jasco V-570 spectrometers. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a CHI620D potentiostat. All measurements were carried out in a one-compartment cell under a nitrogen atmosphere, equipped with a glassy-carbon electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 mol L−1 dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP). All potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+. CV was measured with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Shimadzu DTG 60 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere with runs recorded from room temperature to 550 °C.

Fabrication of organic solar cells
The device structures were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J71:ZITI-3F (or ZITI-4F, ZITI-m)/PNDIT-F3N/Al. Organic solar cell devices were fabricated using ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1), which were cleaned with de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in successive 20 min sonication steps applying a final 20 min oxygen plasma treatment to eliminate any remaining organic components. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) was first spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm and baked at 150 °C for 15 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Subsequently, the active layers were spin-coated from chloroform solution with the same optimal donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1:1 for both J71:ZITI-3F (or ZITI-4F, ZITI-m) blends with a total concentration of 18 mg mL−1 and then treated with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. Then, PNDIT-F3N as the electron transporting layer was spin-coated on the active layer by 3000 rpm from alcohol solution. At the final stage, the substrates were pumped down in high vacuum, and aluminum (100 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer. Shadow masks were used to define the OSC active area (0.05 cm2) of the devices.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of unencapsulated photovoltaic devices were measured under N2 using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 300 W xenon arc solar simulator (Oriel) with an AM 1.5 global filter operated at 100 mW cm−2 was used to simulate the AM 1.5 G solar irradiation. The illumination intensity was corrected by using a silicon photodiode with a protective KG5 filter calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed using certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc., SolarCellScan100).
SCLC mobility measurements
Space charge-limited currents were tested in electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/J71:ZITI-3F (or ZITI-4F, ZITI-m)/Al and hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J71: ZITI-3F (or ZITI-4F, ZITI-m)/Au. The devices were prepared following the same procedure described in the experimental section for photovoltaic devices except for the metal electrode. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC current with field-dependent mobility, which is described as (1)where J is the current, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer.
