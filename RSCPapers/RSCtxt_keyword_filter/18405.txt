    , Accepted 16th October 2012First published on 8th November 2012AbstractOrganic photovoltaic cells with an ordered heterojunction (OHJ) active layer are expected to show increased performance. In the study described here, OHJ cells were fabricated using a combination of nanoimprinting and electrohydrodynamic (EHD) spray deposition methods. After an electron donor material was nanoimprinted with a PDMS stamp (valley width: 230 nm, period: 590 nm) duplicated from a Si nanomold, an electron acceptor material was deposited onto the nanoimprinted donor layer using an EHD spray deposition method. The donor–acceptor interface layer was observed by obtaining cross-sectional images with a focused ion beam (FIB) microscope. The photocurrent generation performance of the OHJ cells was evaluated with the current density–voltage curve under air mass (AM) 1.5 conditions. It was found that the surface morphology of the electron acceptor layer affected the current and voltage outputs of the photovoltaic cells. When an electron acceptor layer with a smooth thin (250 nm above the valley of the electron donor layer) surface morphology was obtained, power conversion efficiency was as high as 0.55%. The electrohydrodynamic spray deposition method used to produce OHJ photovoltaic cells provides a means for the adoption of large area, high throughput processes.
1. Introduction
Polymer-based organic photovoltaic cells (organic solar cells, OSCs) have recently garnered considerable interest as a future source of energy, with a number of studies being conducted to improve their efficiency. OSCs based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) conjugated polymers have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 7%.1 Typical BHJ OSCs have an active layer which is formed by simply coating the substrate with a blended solution containing two semiconductor materials (e.g., an electron donor and an electron acceptor). These materials are deposited using low-cost solution processes such as spin coating and spray deposition. Reyes-Reyes et al. prepared OSCs by spin coating with a solution mixture consisting of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1,1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM) in chlorobenzene and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.1–4.9% was obtained.2 Li et al. fabricated OSCs by spin coating with a blend of P3HT:PCBM at a weight-ratio of 1:1 and achieved a PCE of 4.0%.3 Vak et al. fabricated OSCs using a spray deposition method to apply a solution mixture consisting of P3HT and PCBM in chlorobenzene and obtained a PCE of 2.83%.4 Green et al. used an airbrush spray deposition method to fabricate P3HT:PCBM OSCs in which the PCE was 2.35% with chlorobenzene as a solvent.5 Girotto et al. investigated the characteristics of airbrush spray coated OSCs based on a mixture of P3HT:PCBM dissolved in dichlorobenzene and showed smooth films yielding spray coated solar cells with a PCE of 2.8%.6
To further improve the efficiency of OSCs, a structure based on the concept of a donor/acceptor heterojunction nanostructure with a highly aligned morphology, so-called ordered bulk heterojunction (OHJ) OSCs, was proposed in the early 2000s.7–9 Recent developments in the OHJ OSCs, especially focused on fabrication and device physics, were reported by Weickert et al. and Liu et al.10,11 Several researchers recently reported that the donor/acceptor structures and OHJ OSCs were successfully fabricated using nanoimprinting and spin coating.12–18 Haberkorn et al. showed that the highly ordered interpenetrating donor/acceptor structure was fabricated using spin coating on an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template and selective removal of the template.12 They visualized the well-ordered donor/acceptor structure having a nine-fold larger interface area compared to a bilayer structure. Kim et al. presented a fabrication of OHJ OSCs employing a direct transfer method of the P3HT layer from a flexible polyfluoropolyether (PFPE) mold.13 They noted that the OHJ OSC with P3HT nanocavities had almost a twice higher PCE compared to that of a flat bilayer OSC. Kim et al. employed nanoimprinting to demonstrate the top-down fabrication of an ordered nanostructure of an electron donor layer.14 They used spin coating to fabricate an electron acceptor layer on the nanoimprinted electron donor layer. Aryal et al. fabricated a Si based nanoimprinting mold with electrochemically prepared nanoporous AAO.15 After high-density P3HT nanopillar structures had been formed with the mold, PCBM was spin coated to fabricate the electron acceptor layer. Chen et al. fabricated nanorod arrays of P3HT on ITO glass using AAO templates before spin-coating PCBM directly on the top of the nanorod arrays.16 They showed that the PCE of cells with a nanostructured layer was clearly higher than that of traditional bilayer cells. Furthermore, He et al. proposed a double nanoimprinting process that employs the nanopatterned electron donor layer as a stamp in the second nanoimprinting step for the acceptor polymer.17 They demonstrated a clear improvement in the PCE of OHJ photovoltaic cells to 1.85%, 50% higher than that of the reference BHJ photovoltaic cell (1.09%). Dissanayake et al. fabricated a pentacene-C60 OHJ OSC with a laser nanostructured silicon film as the imprinting stamp and a vacuum sublimation deposited C60 layer.18 Their cell yielded a PCE, which is five times higher than that of the reference cell.
In most of the previous studies outlined above, the spin coating method was used to fabricate the electron acceptor layer. While the spin coating method is one of the most widely used solution processes and produces high-quality, uniformly thin films, it necessarily involves a time-consuming batch process and is not scalable to devices covering a large area. It has been demonstrated that various fabrication methods, including a spray deposition method, can be applied to realize large area coverage for the mass production of OSCs.
Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) spray, also referred to as electrospray, is one of the approaches most recently used to fabricate a thin film composed of fine particles. The EHD spray method has long been used to generate highly charged, relatively monodispersed, micro and nano particles.19–22 Under this method, electrostatic forces homogeneously disperse particles in the space between a nozzle and a substrate. The thickness of the film can be controlled by simply varying experimental parameters such as material concentration, deposition time, the flow rate of the precursor solution and the voltage applied to the nozzle. A few researchers have recently reported on making organic solar cells using the EHD spray deposition method.23–25 Kim et al. fabricated an EHD-sprayed BHJ organic solar cell.23 They chose a mixture of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) and chlorobenzene (CB) as the solvent of P3HT:PCBM blends and obtained a maximum PCE of 3.25% by optimizing the solvent mixing ratio, a level comparable to the PCE of the reference cell (spin coating method, 3.62%). Fukuda et al. fabricated a BHJ OSC based on a P3HT:PCBM blend using a mixed solvent consisting of o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and acetone.24 The PCE of the OSC was 1.9%. Park et al. investigated the effect of the liquid feeding rate on the morphology and performance of P3HT:PCBM BHJ cells fabricated using an EHD spray with a maximum PCE of 0.49%.25
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to describe a fabrication process by which nanoimprinting and EHD spray deposition methods are combined to fabricate OHJ OSCs. After fabricating the electron donor (P3HT) layer with an ordered nanostructure by nanoimprinting the substrate with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanostamp, an EHD spray deposition method was used to deposit the electron acceptor (PCBM) on the P3HT layer. Fine droplets of a polymeric solution containing PCBM were generated, and their successive deposition onto the nanostructured P3HT layer was verified by focused ion beam (FIB) cross-sectional images. OSCs with an OHJ structured active layer were produced and changes in their performance with variations in the thickness and roughness of the PCBM layer were evaluated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
The electron donor material used in the experiments was P3HT purchased from Rieke Metals, and the electron acceptor material was PCBM purchased from Nanocraft Inc. The P3HT and PCBM were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and dichloromethane (DCM, Sigma-Aldrich Co.), respectively. A glass substrate (25 × 25 mm2) with 4 indium tin oxide (ITO) patterns was used as the transparent electrode (thickness ∼100 nm). The ITO glass substrate was successively cleaned with detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The substrate was then treated with a UV ozone cleaner (PSD-UV3, Novascan Technologies Inc.) for 10 min and moved into a glove box to coat it with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P) at a thickness of about 40 nm as a buffer layer. A Si nanomold purchased from Lightsmyth Co. (SNS-C20-0808-xxx-D4-P) was used to duplicate a PDMS nanostamp with a trench width and period of 220 nm and 500 nm, respectively. Fig. 1 shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the PDMS nanostamp fabricated by duplicating the Si nanomold. The properties of the PCBM:DCM solution were determined by employing various measurement devices and are summarized in Table 1. The density of each solution was determined by observing the volume–mass relationship of the solution in a bottle using a microbalance. Viscosity and electrical conductivity were measured using a vibration viscometer (SV-10, AND) and a conductivity meter (YSI 3200, YSI Instruments), respectively. Relative permittivity was measured using a commercial liquid dielectric constant meter (Model 871, Rufuto Co.). Surface tension was measured by adopting the well-known Du-Nouy ring method using a surface tensiometer (Model 21, Fisher Scientific).

2.2 Device fabrication

Fig. 2 provides a schematic representation of the steps in the OHJ photovoltaic cell fabrication process using a combination of nanoimprinting and EHD spray deposition methods. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the nanoimprinting process was conducted on an electron donor P3HT layer spin coated onto an ITO glass substrate to a thickness of about 200 nm using 1 wt% of P3HT:CB solution. After establishing full contact between the P3HT film and the PDMS nanostamp, pressing was performed for 3 min at a pressure of 0.8 kgf cm−2 (5 kg weight on the 6.25 cm2 substrate) under a nitrogen-filled glove box to minimize its exposure to ambient air. As the nanostamp released, high-density and ordered P3HT nanogratings of well-controlled morphology were fabricated (see Fig. 2(b)). The PCBM electron acceptor was then deposited on the nanostructured P3HT layer by EHD spraying with the PCBM:DCM solution (see Fig. 2(c)). After deposition, the ITO glass substrate with PCBM:P3HT layers was transferred into a thermal evaporator for the deposition of aluminum cathode (100 nm thickness) at 2 × 10−6 Torr using a shadow mask, resulting in fabrication of a device. The device was then transferred into the glove box, annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min, and cooled to room temperature. The photovoltaic characteristics of the device were measured with an AM1.5G filtered solar simulator (SAN-EI, XES-301S) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and a Keithley 2400 source meter (see Fig. 2(d)).

Details of the schematic used in the EHD spray method are shown in Fig. 3. The PCBM thin films were deposited by employing the EHD spray system used in our previous studies to fabricate conductive micro patterns and BHJ photovoltaic cells.25,26 The experimental setup consisted of a liquid supply system, an electrical system, a motion stage and a visualization system. The liquid supply system included a syringe pump (Model 200, KD Scientific), a syringe, and a stainless steel nozzle (inner diameter: 150 μm, outer diameter: 320 μm, Iretech Co. Ltd., Korea). The flow rate varied from 10 to 70 μl min−1. The electrical system consisted of a high voltage power supplier (∼DC 15 kV). The pin-type nozzle used for the liquid supply system also served as the anode. A substrate (60 mm width × 80 mm length × 0.1 mm thickness) made of copper and located below the nozzle was used as the ground electrode. The distance between the nozzle and the substrate varied from 8 mm to 50 mm. The visualization system consisted of a high-speed camera (FASTCAM SA1.1 model 1000K-C2, Photron) and a 400 W peak power metal halide light source (MHB-400/DOL, Inflidge Co.). The camera was capable of capturing continuous images with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels at a recording rate of 60000 frames per second (fps) and an exposure time of 400 ns. Exposure time was maintained at below 10 μs throughout the image capturing processes. Although the deposition process was conducted in ambient air, all experiments were conducted in a class 100 (above 0.5 μm) clean room to minimize the penetration of ambient aerosol particles into the device.

A FIB system (SMI 3050, SII Nano Technology Inc.) was used to investigate cross-sections of the P3HT:PCBM layer nanostructure deposited on the substrate. The cross-sections were milled by a FIB system using 30 keV Ga+ ions. All samples were coated with a platinum film of 20 nm before the cross-sectioning to avoid the charging effect. The cross-sectional images were taken using a beam current of ∼1.0 pA.
3. Results and discussion
When the electric potential applied to the PCBM solution loaded in the capillary nozzle increased to 4 kV, the electrospray entered the dripping mode. When the voltage increased further, however, there was a transition from the dripping mode to the cone-jet mode. A stable cone-jet mode was obtained for voltages between 4.5 kV and 5.2 kV. As shown in Fig. 4, a fine cone-jet was emitted from the meniscus when the voltage was 4.5 kV, the liquid flow rate was 10 μl min−1, the nozzle-plate distance was 50 mm, and the solution fraction was 1.2 wt%. The photographic image of the stable cone-jet was captured by a high-speed camera at a rate of 20000 frames per second (fps) and an exposure time of 1 μs. The image demonstrates that a series of monodisperse fine droplets formed at the end of the jet. The droplet size was measured using ACDSee image viewer software (Version 3.1, ACD Systems) and was about 20.6 ± 2.9 μm. This size was qualitatively similar to 28.7 μm that was calculated using the following equation suggested by Ganan-Calvo (1)where dd is the droplet diameter (m), Q is the liquid flow rate (m3 s−1), ρ is the liquid density (kg m−3), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (C V−1 m−1), γ is the liquid surface tension (N m−1), and K is the electrical conductivity (S m−1).27

Fig. 5 shows cross-sectional images of PCBM layers deposited on the nanoimprinting processed P3HT layers for three different experimental parameters of applied voltage (electric potential), flow rate, nozzle-plate distance, and PCBM concentration. Fig. 5(a) shows the PCBM:P3HT layer when the electric potential was 3.55 kV, the liquid flow rate was 30 μl min−1, the nozzle–plate distance was 10 mm, the spray time was 60 s, and the PCBM concentration was 1.2 wt%. It was verified that the nanostructure of the PDMS nanostamp was efficiently transferred onto the P3HT layer (gray) on the glass substrate (black) and transparent electrode layers (ITO and PEDOT:PSS, white). The width of the peak of the P3HT layer was about 200 nm, almost the same as that of the valley of the PDMS nanostamp (230 nm). The period of the P3HT layer was about 600 nm, almost the same as that of the PDMS nanostamp (590 nm). The height above the valley and the overall thickness of the P3HT layer were 180 nm and 350 nm, respectively. The P3HT layer was prepared through nanoimprinting with nanograting being repeated periodically; however, the PCBM layer showed poor morphology. It was not possible to determine the thickness of the PCBM layer because its surface was significantly inhomogeneous and rough.

It has been reported that the quality of a thin film layer is largely determined by evaporation of the liquid in the solution.28,29 After droplets become detached from a nozzle, they undergo evaporation and only solid particles of solute eventually remain.
In this case, the film mainly consists of solid particles and the morphology of the film might be rough. Chen et al. insisted that the morphology of the spray deposited film might be improved to make it smoother by using a solvent with a high boiling point due to the slower evaporation of such solvents when EHD sprayed droplets travel through the air.28 Yu et al. also reported that a smoother surface morphology could be obtained by depositing droplets of solution prior to its complete evaporation into dried particles.29 The influence of droplet evaporation is also related to OSC performance. In our experimental set-up, because the DCM solvent is an extremely volatile liquid with a boiling temperature below 40 °C, the solvent in the solution droplets dries out very quickly. The time required for a droplet to evaporate can be estimated with the following equation tevap = dd2/Kevap(2)where tevap is the evaporation time and Kevap is the evaporation constant. Assuming that the physical properties of a droplet are similar to those of the DCM solvent, the evaporation time for a solution droplet of 20 μm in diameter is calculated to be 3.7 ms. The flight time of the droplet is simply described as (3)where H is the electrode spacing and v is the velocity of the droplet.30 The droplet velocity is expressed as (4)where q is the charge of the droplet, E is the electric field, and μ is the viscosity of ambient air. According to Gomez and Tang, the charge of a droplet generated by EHD spray is 0.49 times the Rayleigh charge limit which is defined as qmax = π(8ε0γdd3)1/2(5)where qmax is the maximum amount of charge a droplet could carry.31 In this study, droplet velocity was calculated to be 5.07 m s−1, which was in good agreement with the droplet velocity (5.19 ± 0.22 m s−1) measured from a series of motion pictures captured using a high-speed camera. Therefore, the flight time of a 20 μm droplet was approximated to be 2 ms. Because the flight time was about half of the evaporation time, the deposited film might contain semi-evaporated particles, resulting in inhomogeneous and rough morphology. According to Wilhelm, one of the most important parameters for film morphology is the initial drop size.32 The initial droplets have to be large enough so they can reach the substrate before they evaporate completely. Evaporation time increases with the size of the droplet. Large droplets allow for the deposition of a thin film with a much smoother surface topography as droplets combine on the substrate.29
FIB cross-sectional images were also obtained at the increased liquid flow rate of 70 μl min−1 while the nozzle-plate distance and the spray time were the same at 10 mm and 60 s, respectively. Fig. 5(b) and (c) show the results for PCBM concentrations of solution (b) 1.2 wt% and (c) 0.2 wt%, respectively. The electric potential was 3.4 kV for both Fig. 5(b) and (c). The evaporation time for a solution droplet generated in the set-up, shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c) (at a liquid flow rate of 70 μl min−1), was calculated at about 7.6 ms, while the flight time was nearly the same at 2 ms as determined using eqn (1)–(5). In comparison with the PCBM layer shown in Fig. 5(a), the PCBM layers shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c) had a smooth and void-free morphology, which might have been caused by less evaporation than in Fig. 5(a) due to tflight ∼ 0.25tevap.
The performance of each of the pristine OHJ photovoltaic cells (as fabricated without thermal annealing, T/A) was measured for comparison. Current density versus voltage (J–V) curves obtained under an AM 1.5 source at an intensity of 100 mW cm2 illumination are shown in Fig. 6. Table 2 summarizes the specific evaluation results, such as open-circuit voltages, short-circuit current densities, fill factors, and PCEs. The PCE of the cell containing a rough particulate active layer without thermal annealing (T/A) (see Fig. 5(a)) was 0.04%. According to Kumar et al., this poor characteristic of fabricated cells is considered to be caused by the surface roughness leading to leakage contact between the anode and the cathode.33 Even though the surface roughness of the PCBM film was improved to make it smooth (see Fig. 5(b)), the PCE of the cell was still as low as 0.011%, which might have been caused by the thick PCBM layer (750 nm). It is widely known that a relatively thick active layer can be an obstacle to the efficient transfer of free charge carriers.34,35 Moule et al. demonstrated that the performance of OSCs was significantly dependent on the thickness of the active layer, and that a PCBM layer thickness of over 225 nm could reduce cell performance.35 In our study, the best PCE among the samples not subject to T/A treatment was 0.14%, a reading observed in the cell with a smooth thin (250 nm) PCBM layer (see Fig. 5(c)). The PCE of the cell increased after T/A treatment at 150 °C for 30 min, as summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 7, the PCE of the cell with a 250 nm PCBM layer increased fourfold from 0.14% to 0.55%. He et al. used spin coating of F8TBT and nanoimprinting of P3HT spin coated to fabricate OHJ OSCs with 2D dot patterns about 80 nm deep with a feature size of 200 nm and a period of 400 nm.17 They also demonstrated a clear improvement in the PCE of nanoimprinted cells with a reduced nanoimprinted feature size, strongly indicating the increased contact interface. Because the period used in our experiment was 600 nm, which is 1.5 times longer than that used in He et al., our PCE of 0.55% is believed to be comparable to the 0.77% obtained by He et al.

4. Conclusions
In the study reported here, an EHD spray deposition method was adopted to deposit a PCBM electron acceptor layer onto a nanoimprinted P3HT layer to fabricate OHJ OSCs. The FIB cross-sectional images demonstrate that the OHJ PV cells had various PCBM layer morphologies, such as rough, smooth/thick (750 nm) and smooth/thin (250 nm) layers. The PV cell with a smooth thin PCBM layer showed the maximum PCE of 0.55% after T/A processing. To attain greater PV cell efficiency under our proposed system, it is desirable that the size and the period of the nanoimprinted P3HT layer be reduced to make it finer. Nanoimprinting with finer nanostamps may make it possible to increase the contact area, leading to improved device performance.
