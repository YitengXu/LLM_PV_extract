Here, based on first principles, we propose a family of achievable 2D tetragonal-structured titanium nitride halides (TiNX, X = F, Cl, Br) as donor and acceptor materials for XSCs in virtue of their desirable optoelectronic properties, such as a direct bandgap with moderate size, superior optical absorption, ultrahigh photoresponsivity together with very small effective masses and exciton binding energy. More importantly, we find that they can be easily superimposed onto each other to form effective solar cell systems with the type-II heterojunction alignment. We predict that the maximum energy conversion of the designed TiNF/TiNBr, TiNCl/TiNBr and TiNF/TiNCl bilayer solar cells can reach as high as ∼18%, 19% and 22%, respectively, which are far superior to those of typical conjugated polymer or fabricated 2D solar cell systems. Our work suggests these potential bilayer systems are appealing 2D solar cell materials with high efficiency.
1. Introduction
Since the development of the first solar cells in the 1950s,1–3 solar cell devices converting energy radiated from the sun to electricity have been searched for unremittingly. Such devices can be divided into two main branches. One is using conventional bulk inorganic semiconductors such as Si, GaAs, CdTe,4 in which the photoexcited free charge carriers are created without intermediate steps. Another is based on donor–acceptor composite networks, where the electron–hole pairs (excitons) are generated and dissociated simultaneously at the donor–acceptor interfaces, referred to as excitonic solar cells (XSCs).5,6 As previous studies proved that such excitons can be dissociated with a high yield at the interfaces of materials with different electron affinity and ionization potentials in XSCs,7,8 achieving substantial energy-conversion efficiencies, considerable efforts have been dedicated to improving the performance of XSCs. Unfortunately, most of them still exhibit less than 12% efficiency,9–11 which is due to the fact that, in addition to separation and inhibited recombination of the excitons, high optical absorption in the visible range and carrier transfer are also important factors that cannot be ignored.12,13 To this end, finding appropriate donor and acceptor materials is still a challenging work.
After the mechanical exfoliation of graphene,14 many 2D materials are predicted in theory or fabricated in the laboratory one after another.15–21 2D materials can exhibit exotic properties that are different from those of their bulk counterparts due to the quantum confinement effect, making them more attractive for designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices.22,23 Particularly, the experimentally synthesized layered transition metal nitride halides (MNX, M = Zr, Hf, Ti; X = Cl, Br, I)24 have drawn tremendous interest for catalysis or topological properties in their monolayer phase.25–27 More recently, Zhou et al.33 found that rectangular TiN monolayer shows enhanced auxeticity and ferroelasticity with alternating order of Poisson's ratios. Interestingly, they observed that the metallic nature of TiN can be modulated to semi-conductive via halogenation, indicating potential applications in water splitting. However, whether they can be employed in photovoltaic application is still not clear. Inspired by the ingenious work of Yang et al., in which edge-modified phosphorene nanoflakes (PNFs) are presented as donor and acceptor materials for solar cells,28 we wonder if these 2D layered structures shrouded by different halogen atoms are endowed with satisfactory characters for the development of 2D photovoltaic materials, especially for XSCs.
Here, we investigate the properties of TiNX (X = F, Cl, Br, I) monolayers. The direct bandgap with moderate size, ultrahigh photoresponsivity, small effective mass and exciton binding energy render them as promising candidates for optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Moreover, TiN with different halogen terminations displays different HOMO and LUMO energies, allowing us to create a TiNX heterobilayer that serves as a type-II donor–acceptor XSCs interface. We demonstrate that these 2D XSCs possess ultrahigh photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE), with values of 18% for TiNF/TiNBr XSC, 19% for TiNCl/TiNBr XSC and 22% for TiNF/TiNCl XSC, which are far superior to the typical polymer and fabricated 2D solar cell systems.
2. Computational methods
First-principles calculations are carried out with the context of density functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)29 exchange-correlation functional, and the projected augmented wave (PAW)30 approach with plane wave cutoff energy of 450 eV, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.31 The convergence criteria are set to be 10−5 eV in energy and 0.01 eV Å−1 in force. A k grid of 15 × 15 × 1 is employed in both geometry and electronic properties calculations. A vacuum spacing of ∼18 Å is used to avoid the interaction between adjacent layers. To correct the band gap underestimation of PBE, we employed the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerh of (HSE06) hybrid density functional with 25% Hartree–Fock exchange energy. The calculated band gaps agree well with those in previous reports.32,33 Phonon spectra are calculated by using the PHONOPY code.34 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out at 500 K with a time step of 1 fs for 1 ps to verify the thermal stability.
Photocurrent calculations are performed on the basis of DFT combined with the non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method,35 as implemented in the Nanodcal code.36,37 Following the previous work,38 the norm-conserving pseudopotential is employed to define the atomic core, and the double-zeta polarization (DZP) basis set is used for photocurrent calculations. The generalized gradient approximation with PBE form is applied for the exchange-correlation potential. The photocurrent (Jph) is obtained as:38–40  where α stands for the lead electrode. Tα(E) is the effective transmission coefficient:Tα(E) = Tr{iΓα[(1 − fα)G<ph + fαG>ph]}where Γα is the line-width function, fα is the Fermi function, and G>/<ph denotes the greater/lesser Green's function including electron–photon interactions.38,41
Then photoresponsivity (Rph) is calculated by:  where Fph is the photon flux, defined as the number of photons per unit time per unit area.40,42
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure and stability
The atomic structure of TiNX monolayer is plotted in Fig. 1a. Each TiNX unit cell contains two Ti, two N and two halogen atoms. The fully optimized lattice parameters of all the TNX monolayers are listed in Table 1, which are almost the same as their bulk phase.43 The lattice constants increase in the order of a(F) < a(Cl) < a(Br) < a(I), which is in accordance with the order of the atomic radius of these halogen atoms. To provide more information on the structures, the simulated STM image of TiNCl is also depicted in Fig. 2a, which can be a reference to the experimental observation about these tetragonal structures. Using TiNCl as a generic example, the charge density difference is shown in Fig. 1c, which indicates charge transfer from Ti to N and halogen atoms through Ti–N and Ti–X bonding interactions. Furthermore, the bonding strength of these monolayers can be estimated from the elastic constants, Cij, which are listed in Table 1. For comparison, the elastic constants of 2D MoS2 are also included, which are C11 = 157.4 N m−1, C12 = 50.5 N m−1 and C22 = 150.7 N m−1, agreeing well with the previous results.44 Compared with MoS2, GeS (C11 = 17.6 N m−1, C12 = 24.7 N m−1, C22 = 47.9 N m−1)45 and GaS (C11 = 108 N m−1, C12 = 32 N m−1, C22 = 108 N m−1),46 the larger Cij shown in our calculation for the proposed TiNX monolayers manifests that they possess stronger in-plane bonding than the majority of other 2D materials. This clearly indicates that these TiNX monolayers are all relatively mechanically stable.

To further confirm the stability of these structures, vibrational phonon calculations were performed. We found that TiNX (X = F, Cl, Br, I) monolayers have similar phonon dispersions, as shown in Fig. 2b and S1 in the ESI.† The absence of imaginary phonon modes over the entire Brillouin zone for all the monolayers suggests that they are all dynamically stable. Additionally, after ab initio MD simulations at 500 K for 1 ps, no broken bonds or geometry reconstruction appear, as shown in Fig. 2d and S2d–f.† Moreover, the evolution of the total energy for these monolayers is also plotted in Fig. 2c and S2a–c.† These systems are thermodynamically stable even at 500 K. The analysis of the elastic constants, phonon spectra and MD simulation demonstrate that all these TiNX (X = F, Cl, Br, I) are mechanically, dynamically and thermally stable. Significantly, as their bulk counterparts are successfully fabricated, and TiN layers are embedded within halide double layers forming sandwich slabs, which interact via weak van der Waals forces between the halide anions of adjacent slabs,43 we are quite confident that these monolayers can be easily obtained via mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition methods, like many other 2D materials.14,16,47
3.2. Electronic and optical properties
The electronic band structures are shown in Fig. 3, which are all calculated at the HSE06 level. Clearly, both of them are direct bandgap semiconductors, with the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) both located at the Γ point. The bandgap values are listed in Table 2. The HSE correction to the PBE gap is about 0.9 eV for the TiNF, TiNCl and TiNBr monolayers. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the CBMs of these monolayers are mainly originated from the Ti 3d states, while the valance states can be divided into two parts: the VBMs of TiNX (X = F, Cl, Br) are dominated primarily by N 2p orbitals, but the main contribution from I 5p orbitals forms the VBM of TiNI. Note that TiNI exhibits zero gap semimetal feature, as can be seen in Fig. S3,† agreeing well with the previous results. This proves that it is an intrinsic quantum spin insulator.26 Thus, we mainly focus on TiNF, TiNCl and TiNBr monolayers in the following study.

The direct bandgaps of 1.56, 1.41, and 1.39 eV of the TiNF, TiNCl and TiNBr monolayers, respectively, perfectly satisfy the optimum range (∼1.2–1.6 eV) for XSCs. The feature of a direct bandgap with moderate size guarantees sufficient optical harvesting, which can be measured by examining the optical absorption, as shown in Fig. 4. These monolayers would display high absorption of sunlight as there is a strong peak lying in the visible range (390–760 nm), behaving as ideal solar absorbers for XSCs. Owing to anisotropic morphology, the optical absorption also exhibits strong anisotropies. Clearly, the optical absorption is governed by the polarization vector parallel to the plane, whereas the contribution of the normal component is negligible in the visible area. The high anisotropy in the optical absorption of these monolayers indicates high polarization sensitivity, which could also be good candidates for polarized optical sensors.48

We then investigated their photocurrents (Jph) induced by incident light, and the corresponding results are plotted in Fig. 5. A detailed description of the model and method is provided in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† For comparison with the experimental results, we use illumination with 1 μW mm−2 light power normal to the surface of materials, and 0.2 V external bias voltage along the x or y directions to drive different current values under different incident laser wavelengths. Note that we chose 0.2 V bias voltage, which is smaller than the band gaps of the TiNX(X= F, Cl, Br) monolayers, so the detected current in the electrode is totally generated by the light.39 The anisotropic feature is consistent with the optical spectrum. The obtained Rph values, another critical property, for TiNF, TiNCl and TiNBr monolayers are 0.31 AW−1, 0.12 AW−1 and 0.22 AW−1, respectively. Those values are about an order of magnitude larger than ultrathin black phosphorus (0.0648 AW−1) and monolayer MoS2 (0.016 AW−1), suggesting promising advances in solar cell applications.49,50

The bandgaps of many 2D materials are tunable under an electric field according to previous theoretical and experimental studies.51,52 It is therefore necessary to examine how these monolayers respond to an external vertical electric field. As the band dispersion and evolution trend under external conditions can be well described with the PBE method,53 the variation of bandgap at the PBE level as a function of electric field strength is displayed in Fig. S4.† We can see that the bandgaps of these monolayers are not sensitive to small electric field strength (≤3 V nm−1) and remain as direct bandgap semiconductors with large critical values of about 9 V nm−1, 5 V nm−1 and 11 V nm−1. It means that TiNF, TiNCl and TiNBr could serve as stable semiconductors for solar cells or be used in other nanoelectronics, like all-electrical field controlled memory devices.54
Considering that the fast separation of free carriers is vitally important in enhancing the efficiency of solar cells,8 the carrier mobility and exciton binding energy are hence discussed qualitatively. The effective masses of electrons at the conduction band minimum (me*) and of holes at the valance band maximum (mh*) were calculated using:m* = ℏ2/(∂2E/∂k2)where k is the wave vector and Ek is the energy corresponding to the wave vector k. We list me* and mh* along the x and y directions of these monolayers in Table 2. We can see that the values are competitive with those of phosphorene55 (me* = 0.17, mh* = 0.15), GeCH356 (me* = 0.09, mh* = 0.43) and p-SiC57 (me* = 0.59, mh* = 0.22). According to the simplistic model, we can calculate the charge carrier mobility ε by:58  where τ is the scattering time, q is the charge, and m* is the effective mass. We can conclude that the TiNX monolayers would be quite promising materials for microelectronics with high carrier mobility. The exciton binding energy is estimated from the hydrogenic model using the formula:  .
Here, RH, m0 and μ are the Rydberg constant of a hydrogen atom (13.6 eV), free electron mass and effective reduced mass of an exciton, respectively. The macroscope static dielectric tensor εr equals the sum of the electron contribution (ε∞) and the ionic contribution (εvib), and can be obtained by density functional perturbation theory (DFPT).45,59 Values of Eb are listed in Table 3. For comparison, the exciton binding of phosphorene is also examined. All these values are comparable with those for phosphorene, and smaller than the famous semiconductors MoS2 (Eb = 280 meV) and C3N4 (Eb = 728 meV) at the same level of computation.45 It should be noted that the hydrogenic model is a more convenient approximation over other methods70–72 so we also checked exciton binding energy of TiNBr by ab initio GW and Bethe–Salpeter equation calculation, as shown in the ESI,† which also shows a weakly bounded excitonic state. As reported from experiments, under the effect of a synergy between band alignment and interlayer build-in potential,9,60,61 such an exciton is more likely to be dissociated into free electrons and holes. Therefore, TiNX monolayers possess high carrier mobility and small exciton binding energy comparable or superior to many traditional two dimensional materials. As a result, they are expected to show satisfactory performance for nanoelectronic applications, especially for excitonic solar cells.

3.3. PCE for XSCs
In XSC, power conversion efficiency depends critically on the band alignment between donor and acceptor materials. The CBM and VBM positions based on the HSE06 level are illustrated in Fig. 6a. Thus, potential solar-cell devices made of TiNX monolayers are constructed and the schematic model is shown in Fig. 6b.

(b) Schematic illustration of type-II donor–acceptor band alignments; ΔEc and ΔEv represent the conduction and valence band offsets, respectively. (c) Computed power conversion efficiency contour as a function of donor bandgap and conduction band offset. 
To evaluate the quality of our solar cell systems, we estimate the efficiency by employing the method used in the study by Scharber et al.,62 which is considered to be a reasonable method of efficiency estimation for 2D XSCs.63–65 The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) η for such devices with type-II alignment can be described as:  
Here the band-fill factor (FF) is assumed to be 0.65 from the literature,62 and the (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) term is an estimation of the maximum open circuit voltage. P(ℏϖ) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ℏϖ, the integral in the numerator represents the short circuit current performed applying the limit external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 100%, and the integral in the denominator denotes the incident solar radiation. Eg is the bandgap of the donor segment and ΔEc is the offset of the conduction band.
As highlighted with black stars in Fig. 6c, the solar cell systems of the TiNF/TiNCl, TiNCl/TiNBr and TiNF/TiNBr heterobilayers could yield PCEs of 22%, 19% and 18%, respectively. All these PCE values are much larger than the best certified efficiencies of organic solar cells (11.7%)66 and MoS2/p-Si heterojunction solar cells (5.23%).9 Furthermore, it is competitive with that of recently proposed bilayer phosphorene/MoS2 systems (16–18%),67 g-SiC2 based systems (12–20%)63 and the edge-modified phosphorene nanoflakes system (20%)28 for highly efficient solar cells. Additionally, for practical applications, we suggest using transition metal oxides with high work functions as the interlayer material in order to match their high HOMO energies. Examples include molybdenum oxide (MoOx) and vanadium oxide (V2O5), which have shown unambiguous advantages of hole injection over the conventionally explored metal contacts.68,69
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the feasibility and the performance of solar cells based on two-layer thin systems constructed from TiNX (X = F, Cl, Br) monolayers. The mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability of all these monolayers were validated. The optimal bandgap size, unsusceptibility to electric field, efficient optical absorption with ultrahigh photoresponsivity, small effective mass and exciton binding energy make TiNX (X= F, Cl, Br) promising candidates for use in flexible optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the PCEs of TiNF/TiNBr, TiNCl/TiNBr and TiNF/TiNCl bilayer solar cells systems can be as high as ∼18%, 19% and 22%, respectively. These calculations illustrate new avenues for nanoscale solar energy conversion using different halogen atom-coated TiN monolayers.
