1. Introduction
Over the past decades, photoactive nanomaterials as photocatalysts, especially semiconductor nanomaterials, have been of great interest due to their potential applications in environmental remediation and energy conversion.1–13 For a single component photocatalyst, upon band gap light illumination, a number of electron–hole pairs will be generated, and these charge carriers either recombine or migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst to contribute to a series of photocatalytic reactions. There are three key factors to determine the performance of the photocatalyst: (1) the band gap of the photocatalyst; (2) the behavior of photogenerated charge carriers; (3) the adsorption capacity of the photocatalyst. Only under light with a wavelength lower than that corresponding to the band gap energy of photocatalyst can a lot of photogenerated electron–hole pairs could be obtained. Thus the narrower the band gap of photocatalyst, the better the light stimulating it can match with solar spectrum. At the same time, the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs provides more opportunities to transfer to the surface of photocatalyst and produce various reactive oxidative species. As is known, the reactive oxidative species (ROSs) produced on the surface of the photocatalyst have a short lifetime and need to diffuse to participate in the oxidation reaction during heterogeneous photocatalysis. Thus if the photocatalyst itself has a considerable adsorption capacity, it is favorable to resolve this contradiction by enrichment of organic compounds from the bulk solution and shorten the diffusion distance. To achieve high performance of photocatalysts, many methods have been developed: such as doping with metallic nanoparticles and/or nonmetal elements;8,14–16 and integration with other types of semiconductor.17–22 Despite the great progress in improving the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts that has been achieved in the past decades; there are still some challenges to be addressed, which are thought to greatly inhibit practical applications. These problems can be briefly summarized into three categories: the fast recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, the narrow excitation wavelength and poor adsorption capacity.
Carbon nanomaterials, such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, have been extensively investigated in various applications due to their promising electronic and catalytic properties.23–32 Among various applications, coupling carbon nanomaterials with photoactive nanomaterials has been demonstrated to be an efficient way to improve the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst. Recently, there have been some reviews on carbon nanomaterials for the enhancement of TiO2 photocatalysis by Sigmund's group and Westwood's group.31,32 The mechanism of the enhancement of photocatalytic performance can be briefly outlined as following: suppressing the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs; tuning the band gap and/or photosensitizing to extend the excitation wavelength; and providing high quality, highly adsorptive active sites. Graphene, as a newly discovered 2-dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterial, has gained increasing attention due to its unique physical, optoelectronic, and chemical properties.33–41 For instance, it possesses high thermal conductivity, excellent mobility of charge carriers, large specific surface area, and good mechanical stability.42–44 These properties make it an ideal electron sink and/or electron transfer bridge and 2D support for constructing a new classes of photocatalyst and improving their photocatalytic performance. To further make use of these properties, various methods including physical and chemical routes have been devoted to the synthesis of graphene.45–48 Although pristine graphene could be obtained via physical routes such as micromechanical exfoliation of graphite, its insufficient functional groups make it difficult to develop functionalized graphene-based nanomaterials. In contrast, graphene obtained by the reduction of exfoliated graphene oxide (GO), possesses many reactive oxygen-containing groups, which offers tremendous opportunities for the fabrication of functionalized graphene-based nanomaterials.
As a respective class of carbon-based nanocomposites, graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites possess remarkable advantages. First, introducing graphene into photocatalysts could improve the charge separation and suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which thus enhances the performance of photocatalyst. Second, owing to its unique two-dimensional structure, graphene could be used as the support to increase the specific surface area of photocatalyst. Third, the strong π–π interaction between graphene and organic molecules facilitates the adsorption of organic molecules. Therefore, these outstanding merits intrinsically associated with graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites suggest that they can be used as a promising class of photocatalysts for applications in environmental remediation and energy conversion.
Herein we provide a tutorial review focusing on the utilization of graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites for environmental remediation and energy conversion, including photodegradation of organic contaminants, photoelectrochemical solar cells, and solar fuel production. We hope that this review can further promote the design and fabrication of novel photocatalysts with unique performances and expand their functional applications as photocatalysts using solar energy.
2. Graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites
Rational design and synthesis of graphene-based photoactive nanomaterials is still in great demand for various applications such as nanoelectronics, sensors, catalysis and energy conversion.42–44,49,50 Generally, approaches for graphene-based photoactive nanomaterials synthesis can be briefly divided into two categories: solution-phase methods and hydrothermal/solvothermal methods.51–65 For example, Kamat's group synthesized TiO2–graphene nanocomposites via mixing graphene oxide and colloidal TiO2 in ethanol and then subjecting them to steady state UV irradiation.51 The photocatalytic methodology not only provides an on-demand UV assisted reduction technique but also opens up new ways to obtain graphene–semiconductor photoactive nanomaterials. In addition, our group reported a novel and facile method for water-phase synthesis of high-quality graphene–TiO2 composite nanosheets using TiCl3 as both a reducing agent and a precursor.63 In this process, besides the reduction of GO into graphene by TiCl3, the oxidized and hydrolyzed products of the reducing agent could also act simultaneously as building blocks of the composite. The advantage of the in situ growth strategy is that it can avoid the agglomeration of semiconductor nanoparticles on the graphene sheets. A graphene–TiO2 nanocomposite can also be synthesized via a sol–gel method using tetrabutyltitanate and GO as the starting materials.64 Due to the existence of surface hydroxyl groups on the GO sheets as nucleation sites for the hydrolysis step, semiconductor nanoparticles could disperse homogeneously on the surface of the graphene. Another effective method for the preparation of semiconductor composites with graphene is the hydrothermal/solvothermal process, in which high crystalline nanocomposites could be obtained without post annealing or calcination treatment. Anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed {001} facets on graphene sheets have been prepared via a facile solvothermal synthetic route.65 The detailed synthesis methods of graphene-based photoactive nanomaterials can be referred to several review articles recently published.33–37
To date, large varieties of graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites have been synthesized. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the available graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites. Generally, photoactive materials consist of three kinds of photoactive materials: noble metal, photoactive organic molecules and semiconductor. From this point of view, graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites could be classified into three main different groups: graphene–noble metal, graphene–photoactive organic molecule and graphene–semiconductor. A detailed categorisation is listed in Table 1.

Besides exploring the new protocols for the synthesis of graphene-based nanocomposites, the understanding of the interaction between graphene and photoactive materials, involving energy and/or electron transfer, is another topic of current research interest.64,66–73 For instance, Tagmatarchis and co-workers66 successfully functionalized graphene with 5-(4-aminophenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl-21,23H-porphyrin (H2P) and applied photoluminescence spectroscopy as meaningful way to investigate the electronic interactions of the H2P units with GO sheets in the excited state. The effective emission quenching of porphyrin covalently linked with GO was indicative of the fact that the singlet excited state of the porphyrin (1H2P*) interacted with GO. Transient absorption measurements further confirmed the formation of (GO)˙−–(H2P)˙+, resulting from the one-electron oxidation of the H2P with the simultaneous one-electron reduction of GO. Our group reported a facile method for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)–anatase TiO2 nanocomposite and investigated its improved photo-induced charge transfer properties via the transient photovoltage (TPV) technique.64 From Fig. 1, it could be seen that the photovoltaic response of RGO–anatase TiO2 nanocomposite (0.16 mV) was 5 times higher than that of anatase TiO2 (0.03 mV). This demonstrated that once the anatase TiO2 was excited, the photo-induced electrons would transfer from anatase TiO2 into RGO, while the holes were left in the anatase TiO2, which was proved by the positive signal of photovoltaic response. Through this electron transfer process, the electron–hole pairs generated in the excited anatase TiO2 could be efficiently separated, thus resulting in the improved photovoltaic response of the RGO–anatase TiO2 nanocomposite. The other characteristic of the photovoltaic response of RGO–anatase nanocomposite compared with anatase TiO2 was that its mean lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs was prolonged from 10−7 s to 10−5 s. This demonstrated that the integration of RGO with anatase TiO2 would greatly retard the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the excited anatase TiO2. Interestingly, visible-light responsive GO–TiO2 (GOT) composites with p/n heterojunction composites were prepared by using TiCl3 and GO as reactants.72 It can be seen from Fig. 2 that these composites exhibited a cathodic–anodic photocurrent response under different wavelength light illumination and at different applied bias. This phenomenon suggested different kinds of semiconductor conductivity types of GO in GOT. Recently, to achieve multistep electron transfer, organic–inorganic ternary composites, consisting of porphyrin, zinc oxide nanoparticles and RGO, have been constructed via a bottom-up strategy.67 The slow rise of photovoltage of the FTO/SnO2/(RGO + ZnONP + ZnP)m electrode indicated that electron equilibration needed additional time in the ZnONP–RGO composite (shown in Fig. 3). What's more, compared to the FTO/SnO2/(ZnONP + ZnP)m electrode, the slower photovoltage decay of the FTO/SnO2/(RGO + ZnONP + ZnP)m electrode directly reflected the longer lifetime of accumulated electrons in the electrolyte. These results indicated that graphene could be used as an excellent electron-acceptor and transporter to improve the photoelectrochemical properties of graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites.

3. Photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants
Currently, environmental problems caused by organic contaminants have become a severe threat to human beings. Photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants, as an efficient way to solve these problems, has gained increasing attention owing to its highly efficient eco-friendly removal of organic contaminants present in our environment.1–5,13 In particular, graphene-based photoactive nanomaterials, as a new type of photocatalyst, have been extensively investigated for its application in environmental remediation due to their high adsorption capacity of dyes, extended light absorption range, and enhanced charge separation and transportation properties.52,74–99 For instance, a visible light responsive graphene–InNbO4 composite was fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal method and its photocatalytic performance was tested by the photodegradation of methyl blue (MB) under visible light irradiation.83 The kinetic constant of MB removal with graphene–InNbO4 was 1.87 times higher than that of InNbO4. By measuring the surface photovoltage, they found that the photovoltaic response of graphene–InNbO4 was larger than that of InNbO4. The results indicated that after the introduction of graphene the separation of the carriers generated in InNbO4 could be enhanced. In addition, the adsorption ability of the InNbO4 was also enhanced. Thus the enhancement of photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improved adsorption performance. Zhao's group synthesized graphene–gold nanocomposites, which possessed an excellent performance in the photocatalytic degradation of dyes under visible light illumination.81 The mechanism of the photodegradation could be briefly outlined as following: under visible light illumination, an electron transfer from the excited dye to a gold nanoparticle via graphene and was then trapped by O2 to produce various ROSs. The dye˙+ finally itself degraded and/or was degraded by the ROSs.
Du et al.82 demonstrated the synthesis of hierarchically ordered macro-mesoporous titania–graphene films through a confinement self-assembly method. Using photocatalytic degradation of MB in the liquid phase as a probe reaction, it can be seen from Fig. 4 that the apparent photodegradation rate constants for macro-mesoporous titania films without and with graphene were almost 11 and 17 times higher than those for pure mesoporous titania films, respectively. In one respect, the structure of hierarchically ordered macro-mesoporous film could help to improve the mass transport through the film, reduce the length of the mesopore channel, increase the accessible surface area of the thin film, and enhance significantly their photocatalytic activities. In another respect, incorporating graphene into the hierarchically ordered macro-mesoporous frameworks could effectively suppress the charge recombination in the films.

Hwang's group reported a strong electronic coupling between graphene and titanium oxide by the formation of intimately coupled nanocomposites of layered-titanate–RGO.100 They found that the UV-vis spectra of the layered-titanate–RGO nanocomposites revealed the disappearance of the reflectance edge, indicating the additional enhancement of visible light absorption. In contrast, the previously reported UV-vis spectra of other TiO2–RGO composite systems possessed a distinct edge in the absorption or reflectance spectra. This difference is due to the highly efficient electronic coupling between the very thin 2D sheet-like morphology of layered titanate and RGO nanosheets. The most important thing was that the self-assembly with RGO nanosheets facilitated the phase transition of anatase TiO2 into layered titanate, which made possible very strong electronic coupling between the two components. The photocatalytic performance of the layered-titanate–RGO was also investigated by the photocatalytic degradation of dichloroacetic acid (DCA). The results indicated that the layered-titanate–RGO showed higher photocatalytic activity than the bulk layered titanates and nanocrystalline layered titanate, which was ascribed to the strong electronic coupling between the two components and the increase in the mobility of carriers by the incorporation of highly conductive RGO nanosheets. This work could provide a new approach to design novel RGO-based nanocomposites with advanced functionality.
Park and co-workers84 reported on the synthesis of graphene-wrapped anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) via one-step hydrothermal GO reduction and TiO2 crystallization from GO-wrapped amorphous TiO2 NPs. The photocatalytic performance of graphene-wrapped anatase TiO2 NPs was also evaluated by using the photocatalytic degradation of MB under visible light as a probe reaction, as shown in Fig. 5B. It can be noted that under visible light illumination, the photocatalytic activity of graphene-wrapped anatase TiO2 NPs was much superior to that of graphene–TiO2 NPs (two-step hydrothermal) and bare anatase TiO2 NPs. During one-step crystallization and reduction, functional groups on the surface of GO (e.g., –OH, –COOH) disappeared when GO was reduced to graphene and the remaining unpaired π electrons of C atom should easily bond with more free Ti atoms on the surface of TiO2. In a similar way to the effect of surface doping that allowed the energy level change of conduction (or balance) band, the interaction between unpaired π electrons and Ti atoms should result in the shift of the band-edge and the significant reduction of the band gap of graphene-wrapped anatase TiO2. Therefore, the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of graphene–TiO2 NPs under visible light illumination can be explained as following two respects: on one hand, the band gap narrowing of TiO2 in the graphene–TiO2 NPs allowed electrons from the excited MB to flow to the conduction band of TiO2 NPs via graphene; on the other hand, valence electrons of TiO2 can also be excited to the conduction band state by absorbing visible light (shown in Fig. 5D). This work could provide guide information to steer the design of highly photoactive graphene-based metal oxide hybrid materials.

Compared to two dimensional graphene nanosheets, zero-dimensional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) possess strong quantum confinement and edge effects when their sizes are down to 10 nm, which induce new physical properties.101–106 For example, GQDs with excellent upconversion photoluminescent (PL) properties were conveniently synthesized using a direct and simple ultrasonic reaction process and were used to construct complex photocatalysts (rutile TiO2–GQD and anatase TiO2–GQD systems) to harness the visible spectrum of sunlight.101 Interestingly it was found that the photocatalytic activity of the rutile TiO2–GQD complex were obviously superior to that of the anatase TiO2–GQD under visible light illumination. As shown in Fig. 6, the upconversion PL peak of GQDs was located at ca. 407 nm (3.05 eV). This energy was larger than the band gap of rutile TiO2 3.0 eV (414 nm), yet smaller than that of anatase TiO2 3.2 eV (388 nm). That is, the upconversion PL emission of GQDs only excited rutile TiO2 to form e−/h+ pairs. Hence the photocatalytic ability of rutile TiO2–GQD was much superior to that of the anatase TiO2–GQD complex.

Besides the applications of graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites in photodegradation of organic dyes in an aqueous phase, they have also been utilized in other photocatalytic processes.74,107–109 For instance, the nanocomposites of TiO2–graphene (TiO2–GR) have been prepared via a facile hydrothermal reaction of graphene oxide and TiO2 in an ethanol–water solvent.74 The photocatalytic activity of TiO2–GR was also investigated toward the gas-phase degradation of benzene, a volatile aromatic pollutant in air. The results showed that the TiO2–GR nanocomposite was able to exhibit much higher stability and activity than that of the bare TiO2. Lee's group also prepared bismuth oxybromide and graphene nanocomposite (BGCs) through a facile solvothermal route by using GO, bismuth nitrite, and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the precursors.107 Its photocatalytic performance was also evaluated using photocatalytic removal of gaseous nitrogen monoxide (NO). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the BGCs nanocomposites in comparison to pure BiOBr under visible light irradiation is ascribed to more-effective charge transportation and separation arising from the strong chemical bonding between BiOBr and graphene. The graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites have also been utilized in photocatalytic killing of cancer cells and bacteria.110 A graphene oxide–TiO2 hybrid (GOT) was prepared using Ti(OC4H9)4 and graphene oxide (GO) as reactants and the visible light-induced photodynamic activity of GOT was investigated in a HeLa cell line. It was found that the enhancement of visible light driven photodynamic activities of GOT was attributed to the lower electron–hole recombination by transporting the electron from TiO2 to GO.
4. Solar fuel production
The increasing serious energy crisis and environmental contamination caused by the burning of fossil fuels have led to an aggressive search for renewable and environmental-friendly alternative energy recourses.111,112 Hydrogen (H2) energy has been recognized as a potentially significant alternative form of storable and clean energy for the future due to its pollution-free, storage, and economical advantages. Industrially, H2 is produced by steam reforming of hydrocarbons such as methane, which also consumes fossil fuel. The utilization of solar energy for the conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen by photocatalysts has been considered a promising solution to address energy and environmental problems.113–115 There have been some reports on the utilization of graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites for overall photocatalytic water splitting.116–136 For example, a high efficiency of the photocatalytic H2 production was achieved using graphene nanosheets decorated with CdS clusters (GNCs) as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst.133 It was interestingly found that the rate of hydrogen production of these nanosized composite could be enhanced after the introduction of graphene, and it was about 4.87 times higher than that of pure CdS nanoparticles under visible light irradiation when the content of graphene was up to 1.0 wt% (shown in Fig. 7). In one way, compared to the pure CdS nanoparticle, there exist more active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers for GNCs due to the larger specific surface area, favoring the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. In another way, in the GNCs system, due to the electron-accepting and transporting properties of graphene, the intimate contact between graphene and CdS could effectively suppress the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, leaving more charge carriers to form reactive species. However, when the content of graphene was higher than 1.0 wt%, a further increase in graphene content led to a reduction of the photocatalytic activity. This decrease could be due to the increase in opacity and light scattering, leading to a decrease in the intensity of irradiation through the depth of the reaction solution, i.e., a “shielding effect” that took place during this process. These results demonstrated that a suitable content of graphene was of great importance for optimizing the photocatalytic performance of GCNs. The work suggests that graphene-based photoactive nanomaterials could be used as a new type of highly efficient hybrid photocatalyst to utilize the solar power effectively.

Generally, the core–shell nanoarchitecture provides a “three-dimensional” intimate contact between two composites which maximizes the interaction. Choi's group has developed a new type of reduced nanosized GO–TiO2 nanoparticles (r-NGOT) which induce a self-assembled core–shell structure with high photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activity.136 The intriguing structural design took an advantage of the synergetic interaction between graphene and TiO2, which invested the composite with two merits. Firstly, compared to the TiO2 loading on the larger graphene (r-LGOT), photogenerated electrons from TiO2 can be more easily transferred to r-NGO because of the excellent contact between the TiO2 surface and the r-GO shell (see Fig. 8A). Secondly, the fact that Pt was directly loaded on the core–shell composite resulted in a stronger synergy between Pt and r-NGOT. In contrast, Pt and TiO2 NPs in Pt–r-LGOT were separated on the GO sheet and the electron transfer from TiO2 to Pt required a distance to travel, Pt on r-NGOT was in contact with TiO2 NPs only through a thin graphene layer. Such a close contact between Pt and TiO2 through a conductive r-GO layer should facilitate the charge separation and the subsequent production of hydrogen. The results exhibited in Fig. 8B show that the rates of H2 production and photocurrent generation of r-NGOT were higher those that of r-LGOT. The high photocatalytic efficiency should be ascribed to these merits above. The geometry of the core–shell structure should be also effective in the design of other graphene-based photoactive composite for solar conversion applications.

In addition to binary graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites, Amal's group reported RGO used as a solid electron mediator for Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting, in which RGO could be obtained by hydrazine reduction and visible-light-assisted photoreduction.135 They found that among various Z-scheme systems, the H2 production rate of interacting RGO prepared by BiVO4 with Ru–SrTiO3:Rh was higher than that of interacting RGO prepared by Ru–SrTiO3:Rh with BiVO4 and interacting BiVO4 with Ru–SrTiO3:Rh without graphene. Upon light illumination, photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of BiVO4 (the O2 photocatalyst) transfer to Ru–SrTiO3:Rh (the H2 photocatalyst) via graphene as an electron conductor (as shown in Fig. 9A). In addition, due to the higher degree of GO reduction using Ru–SrTiO3:Rh and hydrazine in comparison with BiVO4 (as shown in Fig. 9B), GO photoreduced by BiVO4 was more miscible in water and provided a great improvement in the activity for water splitting by efficiently transferring photogenerated electrons from the O2 photocatalyst to the H2 photocatalyst. Moreover, the pH value of the solution also played an important role in forming an intimate physical interaction between the H2 and O2 photocatalysts, which was favorable to the charge transfer. This work provides a new way of using the attractive graphitic carbon material, graphene, in the design of new and efficient systems for water splitting.

A novel dye-sensitized photocatalysis system, employing RGO as a catalyst scaffold and an efficient electron relay mediator between photosensitizer and catalyst, have also been reported for visible-light-driven water reduction.130 Under visible light illumination, this photocatalyst exhibited highly efficient activity for hydrogen evolution from water reduction. The highly efficient activity was attributed to the excellent electron-accepting and electron-transporting properties of RGO, greatly facilitating the electron transfer from excited dye to Pt catalyst and promoting the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. Similarly, Wang's group131 also studied the photocatalytic hydrogen-production activity of EY-functionalized RGO. The total amount of H2 evolved from the EY–RGO system after 2 h irradiation was 8.35 mmol, which was higher than that produced from the RGO (4.86 mmol), GO (5.78 mmol), and EY–GO (6.09 mmol) system. The higher H2 production could be attributed to the broad light absorption of EY–RGO and the efficient electron transfer from photoexcited EY to RGO.
In most photocatalytic hydrogen-generating systems above, the yields of H2 required noble metal as co-catalyst. Nevertheless, noble metals possess the disadvantages of being rare, expensive and harmful to the environment, which limit their wide application. Therefore, developing alternative materials with low cost has been attracting much attention.119–121 For example, Yu's group reported hydrogen evolution from water using a graphene-modified titania nanosheet photocatalyst without noble metals.119 These nanocomposites exhibited a high photocatalytic H2-production activity without Pt co-catalyst. This high photocatalytic activity was due to the graphene sheets as an electron acceptor separating efficiently the photogenerated charge carriers. What's more, the absolute potential of graphene–graphene˙− (−0.08 V vs. SHE, pH = 0) was higher than the reduction potential of H+ (0 V), thus favoring the reduction of H+ even without Pt co-catalyst. This work shows the possibility for the utilization of low cost graphene sheets as a substitute for noble metals (such as Pt) in photocatalytic H2-production.
In addition to powdered-type photocatalytic water splitting, there is another method for hydrogen production, namely, photoelectrochemical water splitting. RGO on a visible-light BiVO4 photocatalyst was constructed for photoelectrochemical water splitting.132 Due to the flat band potential of −0.30 and ∼0 V versus NHE for BiVO4 and graphene at pH 7, photogenerated electrons transferred readily from BiVO4 to graphene under visible light illumination. In addition, the high surface area of RGO sheets also provided a better medium for the dispersion of BiVO4 particles and improved contact with the flat FTO surface. Therefore, electrons injected from BiVO4 were quickly transported to the collecting electrode via RGO sheets.
5. Photoelectrochemical solar cell
Photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion, such as in Si based solar cells, polymer based solar cells and dye (or quantum dots, QD) sensitized solar cells, has attracted increasing interest.137–142 The key to the solar energy conversion is the construction of high performance photoelectrochemical cells (PEC). However, efficient electron–hole pair separation and electron collection are still a big challenge for these photovoltaic applications. Recently, carbon nanostructures, such as C60 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have been considered as excellent electron acceptors and highly conductive scaffolds for electron transportation in the photovoltaic applications.143–145 Graphene as a rising star in carbon family has been also extensively investigated for the applications in solar cell, such as transparent conducting electrodes and counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).146–149 For example, Kamat and co-workers146 designed an RGO–Cu2S composite and employed it as a counter electrode along with TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode to construct a photoelectrochemical cell. They found that charge transfer to the oxidized redox polysulfide species could shuttle electrons more efficiently through the RGO sheets and polysulfide-active Cu2S than platinum as a counter electrode because RGO sheets provide a better medium for the dispersion of Cu2S reactive sites.
In addition to the transparent electrode and the counter electrode, graphene can also be used as the electron acceptor and charge transfer medium to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices.150–155 Yang et al.150 introduced graphene as a 2D bridge into the nanocrystalline electrodes of DSSCs and found that the short-circuit current density was increased by 45% without sacrificing the open-circuit voltage, and the total conversion efficiency was increased by 39% compared with the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide photoanode. On one hand, the nanocrystalline TiO2 could anchor on the graphene flake compactly to form graphene bridges through various intermolecular forces such as physisorption and electrostatic binding. On the other hand, due to its excellent electrical conduction, the bridged graphene behaved as an electron transfer medium to enhance quickly the electron transport from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 at the anchor position, leading to suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (shown in Fig. 10). Therefore, the photoelectrical conversion efficiency could be improved.

Graphene was also used in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).151–153 For QDSSCs, the limiting factor of the efficiency is mainly attributed to two factors: (1) a non-uniform surface coverage and weak anchoring of QDs to the transition metal oxide; and (2) the accumulation of electrons in the semiconductor layer due to the relatively slow electron transfer, resulting in carrier recombination at the semiconductor surface.156 Thus, increasing the loading amount of QDs and suppressing carrier recombination at the semiconductor interface is the key to improve the performance of QDSSCs. QDSSCs based on TiO2 film photoanodes incorporated with different amounts of graphene were fabricated and their photovoltaic performances was also investigated.151 The results showed that the CdS QDSSC incorporating graphene in TiO2 photoanodes demonstrated a higher power conversion efficiency than that without graphene. In one respect, the incorporation of graphene could increase CdS adsorption on the surface of TiO2 film and thus lead to enhancement of the performance of the cell. In another respect, the work function of graphene (−4.4 eV) was close to the work function of FTO (−4.4 eV vs. vacuum) whereas the conduction band of TiO2 was −4.2 eV (vs. vacuum). Therefore, it was beneficial for electrons to transport from the conduction band of TiO2 to FTO glass via graphene bridges, which decreased the charge recombination and back–transport reaction. Chen et al.152 proposed the use of graphene–ZnO composite architecture to enhance the electron transport in QDSSCs. After the introduction of graphene, the reduced series resistance helped to facilitate electron transfer and suppress the interfacial carrier recombination, thus a high fill factor could be obtained.
6. Summary and perspective
In summary, graphene as a new type of 2D carbon nanomaterial has been used to integrate with photoactive nanomaterials to construct a new and promising type of photocatalyst. Recent progress on utilization of graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites in environmental remediation and energy conversion, including photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants, solar fuel production, and photoelectrochemical solar cells, has been summarized in this article. In most common systems reported in the literature, the role of graphene is mainly considered as the electron transport mediator, leading to the effective separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and improving the photocatalytic performance. In addition, graphene could also be used as a 2D support to increase the surface area and provide adsorptive active sites to the photocatalyst, enhancing the photocatalytic activity. At the same time, the strong π–π interaction between graphene and organic molecules facilitates the adsorption of organic molecules. What's more, it should be noted here that graphene could also employed effectively as a substitute for noble metals (such as Pt) in photocatalytic H2-production.
Although considerable progress has been achieved, there still exist great opportunities in the exploitation of novel graphene-based photoactive nanomaterials. Due to the existence of defects or oxidized sites in the partially restored graphene, there still remains a significant challenge to synthesise large-scale and high-quality graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites, which is a barrier for commercialization production. New synthesis methods would need to be developed for addressing these issues. As we know, the rapid development of material science leads to the creation of various advanced photocatalytic materials. Thus some novel properties could be explored via combining these novel photocatalytic materials with graphene. What's more, the underlying mechanisms of the photocatalytic enhancement by graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites are partly unclear. For example, many recent studies found that visible-light-induced electrons could transfer from the occupied electronic level of RGO to the conduction band of layered titanate upon visible light irradiation, indicating that graphene could also be used as the sensitizer.100,157 Recently, He and Lu158 demonstrated a facile route to revisit the structure of GO for preparing new-style graphene-based ultraviolet absorbers. Their studies indicated that, distinct from the common understanding, the as-synthesized nitrogen-doped graphene sheets could dramatically enhance the photostability of Food Black under UV irradiation. Thus more studies are needed on understanding the mechanisms of the photocatalytic enhancement, which is very favorable for designing novel graphene-based photoactive nanocomposites.
