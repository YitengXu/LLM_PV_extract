    , Accepted 6th August 2020First published on 7th August 2020AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) favor minimal environmental impact and low processing costs, factors that have prompted intensive research and development. In both cases, rare, expensive, and less stable metals (Pt and Au) are used as counter/back electrodes; this design increases the overall fabrication cost of commercial DSSC and PSC devices. Therefore, significant attempts have been made to identify possible substitutes. Carbon-based materials seem to be a favorable candidate for DSSCs and PSCs due to their excellent catalytic ability, easy scalability, low cost, and long-term stability. However, different carbon materials, including carbon black, graphene, and carbon nanotubes, among others, have distinct properties, which have a significant role in device efficiency. Herein, we summarize the recent advancement of carbon-based materials and review their synthetic approaches, structure–function relationship, surface modification, heteroatoms/metal/metal oxide incorporation, fabrication process of counter/back electrodes, and their effects on photovoltaic efficiency, based on previous studies. Finally, we highlight the advantages, disadvantages, and design criteria of carbon materials and fabrication challenges that inspire researchers to find low cost, efficient and stable counter/back electrodes for DSSCs and PSCs.M.

1. Introduction
Energy has become the key to achieving almost all sustainable development. Total energy consumption in 2018 was 13864.9 mtoe (million tonnes oil equivalent, 1 mtoe = 4.1868 × 1016 J), and by 2040, almost 815 quadrillion Btu (British thermal units, 1 Btu = 1055.06 J) energy will be needed.1,2 To meet this ever-increasing demand for energy, fossil fuel depletion has accelerated and, considering the greenhouse effect and climate change, exploration and development of renewable energy resources have increased around the world. Among all of the renewable energy sources, solar energy is the world's most rapidly developing system. Indeed, total solar production has grown by an average of 8.3% per year and has the abundant potential for power generation.1,3 The overall solar energy received by the Earth's crust is roughly 3.8 million EJ per year, and the total global annual solar energy potential is 1575 (minimum) to 49837 EJ (maximum) per year (Fig. 1a).4,5Fig. 1b shows the worldwide distribution of solar radiation; the small black dots indicate a theoretical area large enough to supply the entire world's energy demands (18 TW with solar power).

Third generation solar cells are often designated as evolving photovoltaic cells, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot solar cells, organic/polymer solar cells, perovskite solar cells (PSCs), etc. The majority of these designs are still in the research or development stage. Fig. 1c displays the efficiency progress of the best researched cells since 1976. Notably, third generation solar cells favor minimal environmental impact and low processing costs, factors that have prompted intensive research and development.6–12 DSSC energy conversion efficiency (η ≈ 14.0%) is far below that of silicon solar cells (η ≈ 26.1%).13–16 However, due to DSSCs’ simple assembly technique, transparency, good plasticity, mechanical robustness, environmental friendliness, and ability to work at wider angles, they are one of the highly promising alternatives to silicon solar cells.17,18 Furthermore, their outstanding performance19 (η ≈ 34%) in indoor-light conditions compared to other solar cells makes them a possible candidate as a power source for indoor electronic devices and smart windows in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs).20–22 On the other hand, PSCs, which originate from DSSCs, have advanced from very low initial efficiency to show competitive efficiency with silicon solar cells in only a decade. Hence, PSCs are the fastest-advancing solar technology. Furthermore, due to low production cost, roll-to-roll processing ability, and flexibility, PSCs have become commercially attractive for photovoltaic technology.
Platinum (Pt) is a commonly used standard counter electrode (CE) in DSSCs due to its high catalytic activity for redox shuttles and high conductivity. However, Pt is a costly and rare noble metal, and thus it is not feasible for extensive use to industrialize DSSCs. Furthermore, Pt makes complexes with electrolyte and has insufficient long-term stability in DSSCs. Therefore, significant attempts have been made to find possible substitutes for an efficient, low cost, and stable CE. Similar to DSSCs, the back electrode (BE) used in PSCs (silver [Au] and gold [Ag]) are expensive and less stable, factors that increase the overall device fabrication cost and practical application of Au or Ag as the BE in commercial (or real) devices.
Carbon-based materials are favorable CE/BE candidates for DSSCs and PSCs due to their excellent catalytic ability, easy scalability, low cost, and long-term stability.26–30 Furthermore, the carbon work function (WF) (5.0) is close to Au (5.1) and Ag (4.7); this criterion is critical for PSC BEs. Another advantage of carbon-based materials is its non-hydrophilic character: it stops moisture penetration in the perovskite layer, even with no sealing process.31 In 1996, Kay and Grätzel first employed a graphite–carbon black (CB) mixture as the CE in a DSSC. Subsequently, many research attempts have explored different carbon materials, such as CB, graphite, mesoporous carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), all of which have been effectively utilized as CEs. However, the application of carbon-based materials as the BE in PSCs has not grown at the same rate as DSSCs; it remains in an emerging stage.
Some interesting reviews have discussed different CEs/BEs of DSSCs and PSCs.27–29,32,33 However, in this review, we specially focus and discuss the different critical issues of carbon-based CEs/BEs. We discuss the source, structure–function relationship, and synthesis methods that greatly influence the performance of the materials. Finally, we highlight the advantages, disadvantages, design criteria of carbon materials, and fabrication challenges of a CE/BE that may lead researchers to identify low cost, efficient, and stable CEs/BEs for DSSCs and PSCs.
2. Dye-sensitized solar cells
2.1. Working principle of DSSCs and the function of the CE
In a conventional solar photovoltaic cell, when a sunlight photon hits the P–N junction, an electron–hole pair is generated in the depletion region. Due to the built-in potential and electric field in the depletion region, electrons move to the n-region and the holes move to the p-region. When an external load is applied, electrons travel through the load and recombine with the holes to complete the circuit.
The working principle of DSSCs is not similar to a conventional solar cell; rather, it is similar to the natural photosynthesis process, where light absorption and charge carrier transportation are mediated by different substances. The overall process in a DSSC can be divided into four different fundamental steps: (i) photoexcitation of a sensitizer dye; (ii) injection of the electron into the conduction band of a semiconductor metal oxide from the excited dye and flow to the CE via an external circuit; (iii) reduction of an oxidized electrolyte at the CE interface; and (iv) regeneration of the dye by accepting electrons from the redox couple (Fig. 2). When a DSSC is exposed to light, the dye sensitizer is excited by absorbing a photon and an electron from a HOMO jump to LUMO. The excited electron is injected into the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor metal oxide film and diffuses to the anode. For efficient electron transfer between the excited dye and semiconductor metal oxide, the conduction band of the metal oxide should be lower than the LUMO level of the excited dye.18,34 Typically, a layer of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) is used as a semiconductor electrode with a thickness ca. 10 μm, particle size 10–30 nm and porosity of 50–60%.18
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the working principle of dye-sensitized solar cells. 
In DSSCs, the charge carriers face different types of resistance during the completion of the circuit, including series resistance (Rs), the Warburg parameter (ZW), and charge transfer resistance (Rct).35–37 Series resistance arises from the sheet resistance of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass and the contact resistance of the cell. The Warburg parameter describes the Nernst diffusion of the triiodide ion (I3−) in the electrolyte. Charge transfer resistance results from the charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte and CE/electrolyte interface. In DSSCs, the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface often dominates over other charge transfer resistances, and thus Rct often refers to charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. The CE in a DSSC executes three fundamental functions:38–42 it collects electrons from the external circuit, reduces the oxidized redox couple as a catalyst, and finally—as a mirror—it reflects unabsorbed light from the cell back to the cell to enhance the utilization of sunlight. The CE substantially contributes to the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. The output voltage of a DSSC after loading is lower than its theoretical maximum photovoltage or open-circuit voltage. This voltage loss is due to the charge transfer or mass transfer over-potential as well as the kinetic over-potential. The former originates from the electrocatalytic activity of the CE toward the mediator, whereas the latter results from the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and the transportation of mediator species from the CE to the photoanode.35,43 Another important parameter, the fill factor (FF), depends on the aforementioned resistance values. Decreasing the overvoltage for diffusion and electron transfer and reducing the charge transfer resistance and series resistance will lead to a higher FF value, thus ensuring better efficiency and allowing the output power of the solar cell to approach its theoretical maximum.
2.2. Diverse carbon-based CEs for dye-sensitized solar cells
Carbon is the 15th most abundant element on Earth. Carbon atoms can bond with each other in diverse ways. There are eight carbon allotropes (Fig. 3): (i) diamond, (ii) graphite, (iii) lonsdaleite, (iv) fullerenes, namely C60 (buckminsterfullerene or buckyball), C540, and C70, (vii) amorphous carbon, and (viii) CNTs (buckytube). Due to different intrinsic structures, allotropes show distinct physical and electrochemical properties. Several carbon-based materials, including CB, mesoporous carbon, graphite,45,79 graphene,46,47 CNTs, and CNFs, have been successfully employed as CEs in DSSCs. To enhance the catalytic ability of carbon, different heteroatoms (nitrogen [N], oxygen [O], sulfur [S], and phosphorus [P]) can be doped in the carbon network. Due to their different electronegativity, the heteroatom redistributes the spin and charge density of the carbon network and creates a highly efficient active site, where reactant molecules interact more competently.48,49 Furthermore, different metals (Pt, iron [Fe], cobalt [Co] and palladium [Pd]), metal oxides (RuO2, Fe2O3, and NiO), alloy, and polymers can be incorporated into the carbon matrix: the synergetic effect of the component materials produces better catalytic performance.50–53 Different defect positions or heteroatoms in the carbon substrate can be exploited as active sites for nucleation and growth of metal nanoparticles (NPs). These features can help stabilize the deposited metal NPs with a small size and narrow distribution.54 Besides, the carbon substrate enhances the surface roughness and oxygen vacancies of metal NPs and metal oxides, factors that also improve the catalytic activity of carbon composites.

2.2.1. Carbon black and dense carbons for dye-sensitized solar cells. 
Carbon black (CB) is an amorphous form of carbon with finely divided particles; it is generally obtained as soot from partial combustion of hydrocarbons. CB particles are spherical and their size varies widely depending on the process by which they are made. The particles are typically less regularly crystalline (paracrystalline). As a result of high surface-area-to-volume ratio, excellent conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity, CB is a good material for a CE.56,57
The electrocatalytic activity and charge transfer resistance of CB depend on the particle size and its thickness on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass; these factors are crucial for the function and performance of DSSCs. As CB thickness increases, the charge transfer resistance of the CE drops. Above 14 μm, the enormous surface area of the CB leads to a low Rct of approximately 2.96 Ω cm2 and enhances the DSSC's power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 9.1%.58 Kim et al. varied the particle size from 20 to 90 nm and controlled electrode thickness from 1 to 9 μm by adjusting the spraying time. They increased the surface-to-volume ratio by decreasing the CB particle size. These manipulations increase the electrocatalytic activity and conductivity of the CB electrode. Charge transfer resistance decreases as the electrolyte/electrode interface area increases.
The annealing temperature and composition of CB also play critical roles in the photovoltaic performance, especially when a binder is used in CE fabrication.59 At a low temperature, excess binder materials leads to a high charge transfer resistance. The optimum temperature is above 450 °C, at which point the binder particles are entirely eliminated. Consequently, the electrochemical properties of the resulting CB films become similar to those of Pt film.
Recently, Liu et al. studied the electrocatalytic activity of CB material in Co-based DSSCs (Fig. 4a–f).60 They found that the amount of CB loading and the heat-treatment play equal key roles in the electrochemical behavior of the resulting a thin CB film. Notably, one CB layer without heat-treatment (denoted as CB-1) fully covers the FTO/glass substrate and is tightly bound by ethyl cellulose molecules. By contrast, a heat-treated CB layer (i.e., CB-1-H) is partly covered with aggregated CB clusters. The electrochemical studies revealed that heat-treated CB shows very high catalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance. This CB particle aggregation is evidently increased by augmenting the CB deposition layer (CB-3-H). Furthermore, catalytic activity is increased with an increased CB deposition layer.

To augment the CE performance, CB composites have been made with different materials, including polymer, graphene, and transition metals and their compounds.56,61–66 Park's group developed a three-dimensional (3D) network epoxy polymer and CB composite, acting as a catalytic layer and conductive corrosion protective layer (CCPL), by controlling the CB weight percentage alongside the polymer (Fig. 4g–j).67 The authors fabricated the composite film by mixing cross-linkable epoxy monomers and polyamine hardener with CB; they applied it by the spray pyrolysis technique. They used an efficient charge collector stainless steel as the substrate. The CCPL (6 wt% of CB) is chemically stable in contact with electrolytes and can inhibit the diffusion of electrolytes. These data indicate it is a remarkable CCPL.
Wu's group used the spin-coating method to fabricate cheap and efficient counter CEs for DSSCs using Pt/CB composites.68 To make the spin-coating procedure, they used ethyl cellulose (EC) as a binder to control the viscosity of the Pt/CB composites. At the Pt-to-CB ratio of approximately 1:3, the authors studied the influences of film composition (Pt/CB:EC = 30:15 or 30:4) and the number of coating layers of the Pt/CB electrodes on the electrochemical properties as well as the efficiency of the corresponding DSSCs. The analysis showed that a Pt/CB CE with a lower fraction of EC (Pt/CB:EC = 30:4) exhibits a low charge transfer resistance, high electrochemical activity, and good PCE (8.06%) comparable to that of cells using Pt. The detailed information of CB CEs and their electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties in DSSCs are summarized in Table 1.

Different carbon-based materials with a low SSA also show very good catalytic activity due to their high surface catalytic activity. Different polymers and biomass have been used without any activating agent or template. Stucky et al. reported crystalline poly(triazine imide)-based graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) which they prepared via a reformed ionothermal process by using a melamine-cyanuric acid (MCA) complex as precursor.69 Li et al. reported an active agent and template-free facile fabrication approach for the preparation of carbon nanosheets (CNSs) (Fig. 5a–f).70 To fabricate CNSs, the authors mixed sodium citrate and urea, ground them, and annealed the mixture at various temperatures. At low-temperature solid-phase, cross-linking occurs, while at high-temperatures, carbonization occurs. There were annealing temperature–dependent electrochemical properties when applying CNSs as metal-free CEs for DSSCs. Yuan et al. reported a unique In2S3–C–Au hybrid, fabricated simply by decorating carbon-coated hierarchical In2S3 flower-like architectures with Au particles (Fig. 5g–l).71 The authors synthesized the In2S3–C–Au (ICA) hybrid materials by two-step hydrothermal treatment, using glucose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as carbon sources. Electrochemical performance showed that the hybrid material contains high catalytic activity and electrochemical constancy for the interchange of the redox couple I3−/I−. Moreover, the hybrid material as a CE exhibits a better PCE (8.91%) compared to the commercial Pt counterpart (7.67%).

Wang and Chen group's successfully planned and prepared a superlattice polyoxometalate/MoS2 heterojunction coated on the activated carbon surface by a facile step-by-step method. They used candle soot as carbon precursor.72 This nanomaterial contains the synergetic benefits of the high conductivity of carbon NPs, admirable redox performance of P2Mo18, and electrocatalytic activity of two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 with the structural advantages of a superlattice, heterojunction, high SSA, and hierarchical structure. Electrochemical properties specify that the P2Mo18/MoS2@C nanomaterial has excellent electric conductivity for fast charge transformation, as well as outstanding catalytic activities for I3− reduction in DSSCs. Indeed, a DSSC that employs P2Mo18/MoS2@C as a CE shows a PCE of 8.85%, which is higher than when using a Pt electrode. The details information of dense-carbon counter electrodes and their electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties in DSSCs are summarized in Table 2.

2.2.2. Porous carbons for dye-sensitized solar cells. 
Porous carbon materials have received significant attention as CEs for DSSCs owing to their unique characteristics, including ultra-high surface areas, large pore volumes, and tunable pore sizes and shapes. They also exhibit nanoscale effects in their pore channels and pore walls. High surface areas provide a large number of reaction or interaction sites for surface or interface-related processes, such as adsorption and catalysis. Moreover, mesoporous channels facilitate the transport of atoms, ions, and large molecules through the bulk of the material and assist to overcome charge transfer resistance.96–98 Different methods and precursors have been used to synthesize mesoporous carbons; the efficiency of the mesoporous carbon electrodes depend on synthetic methods and precursors.99–107
Activated carbons, due to their high surface area, pore structure (essentially microporous), and high degree of surface reactivity, are widely used as catalysts. The primary raw material used for activated carbon is any organic material with a high carbon content, such as coconut shells, coal, peat wood, and polymers. Typically, physical (CO2 or steam) or chemical (salts: ZnCl2, K2CO3, K2SO4,108,109 strong bases: KOH, NaOH,110,111 or acids: H2SO4, H3PO4)109,111 activation methods are used to produce activated carbon. Transition metal chlorides, which decompose at low temperatures (below the carbonization temperature), may act as crystalline templates below the decomposition temperature, but at an elevated temperature, they act as activating agents. For example, ZnCl2 is generally considered to be a dehydrating agent that eliminates water and induces aromatization and acts as a template below decomposition temperature to create micropores. However, at an elevated temperature, zinc chloride hydrates, which may form at low temperature, are converted to ZnO, which oxidizes carbon and creates mespores as well as micropores, according to eqn (1) and (2).109,112–114 ZnCl2(l) + H2O(g) = ZnO(s) + 2HCl(g)(1) ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(s) + CO(g) + CO2(g)(2)
On the other hand, oxysalts, acids, and bases either oxidize lignocellulose or carbon itself or decompose to form CO2, SO42−, NO3−, or H2O (steam), among other compounds, which oxidize lignocellulose or carbon and create pores, according to eqn (3)–(9).115,116 Furthermore, S-, N-, and P-containing activating agents may be incorporated heteroatoms in the carbon network, as shown in Fig. 6a.112,117 KOH(s) + C(s) → K(s) + H2(g) + K2CO3(g) (≤600 °C)(3) K2CO3(s) + C(s) → K2O(s) + CO(g) (≤700 °C)(4) K2CO3(s) → K2O(s) + CO2(g) (≥700 °C)(5) CO2(g) + C(g) → CO(g)(6) KHCO3(s) → K2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(g)(7) K2CO3(s) + C(s) → K2O(s) + CO(g)(8) CO2(g) + C(g) → CO(g)(9)

Activating agents and carbonization temperatures have significant effects on the materials’ surface morphology and performance. The carbonization temperature shows a pyramidal effect on the efficiency of materials that contain heteroatoms. At low temperatures, there is lower catalytic performance due to inferior graphitization, while at elevated temperature, the fraction of heteroatoms decreases. Therefore, an optimized temperature is a prerequisite. When researchers carbonized coffee waste (CW) carbonized with ZnCl2 at different temperatures, they found that the total surface area is higher for the prepared carbon samples at a carbonization temperature 900 °C, while the electrocatalytic performance is higher for the carbon prepared at 800 °C (Fig. 6c–n).118 This phenomenon occurs because of the decreasing percentage of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen. Our group activated anchovy-derived carbons (AnCs) with KOH, a strong activating agent; there is a higher SSA (2622 m2 g−1) with 2.09 and 0.81 atom% N and S, respectively.119 AnCs as CEs in DSSCs show superior electrocatalytic activity compared to Pt CE with a Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox mediator. An AnC-based DSSC employing an SM-315 porphyrin sensitizer shows a PCE of 12.72%. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported value for DSSCs that utilize carbon nanomaterials as CEs.
Wang et al. prepared activated N-doped porous carbons (a-NCs) by melamine–formaldehyde (MF) resin incorporation in the graphene and subsequent alkali activation and pyrolysis.121 The graphene integration, mesopore-rich porous texture, and moderate N doping levels facilitate the applications of a-NCs as a CE in DSSCs. Wang et al. showed a simple and general way to prepared bio-based porous carbon (BPC) supported by a ZnNb2O6 hybrid containing a distinctive network structure that provides an efficient way to increase electron transportation between the electrode/electrolyte interface, and higher PCE (Fig. 7).122 As the raw materials, they used aloe peel waste, and by hydrothermal carbonization, KOH activation, and pyrolysis carbonization, they prepared a network BPC structure. Subsequently, they generated a dispersed solution of BPC in ethanol mixed with NbCl5 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O salts containing another ethanol solution. Next, they moved the mixed solution to a Teflon-coated stainless-steel autoclave. Finally, they conducted hydrothermal treatment at 240 °C for 12 h and dried it under inert gas conditions. Table 3 shows the details information of porous-carbon counter electrodes and their electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties in DSSCs.

Different template methods, including hard and soft templates, are generally used to produce mesopores or macropores alongside micropores in many carbon materials. In the hard template processes, carbon precursors are incorporated into the templates with well-defined structures. Subsequently, templates are removed by high-temperature, dissolution, or chemical etching, leaving behind the negative carbon replicas of the templates. Silica,138,139 inert alkali metal chlorides (LiCl, NaCl, or KCl),112,140 alkali earth metal oxides (MgO or CaO),141–143 sulfates (MgSO4),144 and carbonates (CaCO3)145–147 are used as hard templates.
Xiao et al. used an MgO-based hard template method to synthesize N-doped porous carbon (NPC) from the nitrogen-rich pitch (Fig. 8a–i).148 The authors mechanically mixed N-rich pitch and MgO with a 1:6 mass ratio, followed by carbonization at 900 °C. The porous carbon obtained at 900 °C contains a high nitrogen content (7.11 wt%) with high SSA and displays high electrocatalytic activity in the iodine reduction reaction. The generated NPC provides higher PCE (8.75%) compared to that of the commercial Pt CE (7.55%). Li et al. used basic magnesium sulfate (BMS) whiskers to fabricate dual-doped meso/microporous carbon as low-cost and efficient CEs for I3− reduction.144 Melamine is used as N-containing carbon source, while BMS whiskers are used as an S source and templates. This higher photovoltaic efficiency is due to the merits of well-balanced and fast charge transportation relating to facile ion transfer and fast electron conduction to the open framework structure and soft carbon nature of pitch-derived porous carbon, respectively.

Unlike the hard template, soft templates do not possess a concrete shape. Soft templates are mainly block copolymers or organic molecules. In a liquid mixture, soft templates form micelles via self-assembly and act as the structure-directing agent. The hydrophilic tails of micelles then interact with the carbon precursor through covalent or hydrogen bonds. In this process, micelles are enclosed inside the carbon precursor. The enclosed micelles are then removed by heat treatment in an inert atmosphere above 400 °C, creating hierarchically ordered mesopores inside the carbon. The shape of the pores depends on the shape of the micelles.149
Our group prepared copolymer-templated N-enriched nanocarbon (CTNC) and examined the performance with I−/I3− and Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox mediators (Fig. 9).150 This is also considered as a self-template or template-free method. We used polyacrylonitrile-b-poly(butyl acrylate) (PAN-b-PBA) block copolymer as a precursor, where the PAN fraction acts as a source of graphene-like structure and the PBA fraction acts as sacrificial block to create pores. CTNC shows greater catalytic activity towards the Co(bpy)32+/3+ reduction reaction and higher efficiency in comparison to the typical Pt CE. The experimental catalytic activity is due to the synergetic effect of the large surface area of CTNCs provided by a 3D bi-continuous structure and hierarchical pore connection. Furthermore, their distinctive electrical characteristics result from the existence of N heteroatoms situated on the edges of nano graphitic domains.

To enhance catalytic activity and stability, porous carbon with ordered graphitic layer has been mixed with a polymer, transition metal, metalloid, or other nanocarbon materials like graphene and CNTs to enhance the catalytic activity, wettability toward electrolytes, and long-term stability.149,151–154 Wang and Lin's group used a polystyrene sphere as a soft template to prepare CoSe2 NPs inserted into porous carbon shells (CoSe2/CS) as highly competent catalysts for the I3− reduction reaction.155 They covered the polystyrene sphere with polydopamine-containing Co precursor. After pyrolysis at 800 °C, they removed the polystyrene sphere with CoOx/CS, which after calcination with Se powder at 450 °C under an Ar atmosphere produces CoSe2/CS. The carbon nanoshells are highly graphitized with N doping, and CoSe2 NPs are well distributed within the nanoshells. Our group recently doped tellurium (Te) and ruthenium (Ru) in the copolymer-templated N-enriched nanocarbon network via an in situ approach.52,156,157 We found that after doping, the Te and Ru atom 3D carbon network retains its hierarchical graphene-like structure, including numerous defect sites and high porosity. Therefore, the generated Te- and Ru-doped CTNC shows better catalytic ability toward both iodine and cobalt redox couples. We obtained the highest efficiencies of 11.64 and 9.67% under one sun illumination for SGT-021/Co(bpy)32+/3+- and N719/I−/I3−-based DSSCs with Te-doped CTNC CEs. These values are higher compared to using a Pt CE.
To enhance the synergetic effect of different elements, Chen et al. synthesized titanium, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon-containing compositional material (TiOPC) as a CE competent in I3−/I− redox couples (Fig. 10).158 In this study, they obtained TiOPC nanocomposites from carbon thermal transformation of TiP2O7 at a high temperature in inert conditions. Furthermore, they examined the catalytic performance of TiOPC by varying the carbon composition in the nanocomposites. They found that TiOPC with approximately 24.6 wt% carbon enhances porosity and displays better electrocatalytic activity in the iodine reduction reaction, offering a photovoltaic performance of 8.65%. The energy conversion efficiency of TiOPC CE-based DSSCs is even greater than that of the typical Pt-based CE (6.66%). The superior catalytic activity of TiOPC is due to the existence of a leading Ti–O–P–C structure, besides the uninterrupted conductive carbon structure and higher porosity. Detailed information about mesoporous carbon CEs and their electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties in DSSCs are summarized in Table 4.

2.2.3. Graphene for dye-sensitized solar cells. 
Graphene is a flat monolayer of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms tightly packed into a 2D honeycomb lattice. It is the basic building block of many other carbon allotropes, such as graphite, charcoal, CNTs, and fullerenes (Fig. 11).102,103 Graphene possesses many exceptional properties: high charge carrier mobility (∼10000 cm2 V−1 s−1),180–182 high SSA (2630 m2 g−1),183,184 excellent thermal conductivity (∼3000 W m−1 K−1),185 high Young's modulus (∼1 TPa),186 and high optical transparency (97.7%).187 Due to these unique properties, graphene has attracted most attention as a DSSC CE material among all of the carbon allotropes.188,189 Pristine graphene has zero bandgaps, with no defects and functional groups.190–192 Like graphite, basal planes of graphene are low free energy active sites. Therefore, pristine graphene acts like inert materials and shows very weak catalytic properties. However, creating defects and surface modification or functionalization with heteroatoms opens the bandgap and, thus, broadens its application in catalysis.
 Fig. 11  Two-dimensional (2D) graphene is the foundation for 0D, 1D, and 3D carbon materials. It can be folded into 0D buckyballs, rolled into 1D nanotubes, or piled into 3D graphite.193 Copyright 2007, Nature Publishing Group; reprinted with permission.193 
The edge sites and topological defects in graphene can tune the electronic structures of basal planes. The edge sites usually include dangling groups and vacancies at the edge of the carbon. The dangling bonds located at the edge of sp2-hybridized carbon basal planes usually are high-energy sites and catalytic centers. Topological defects in nanocarbon materials can occur as nonhexagonal units in the form of patterned defects or a random point mismatches. Different research groups have used graphite and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), where edge sites are only catalytic sites, as CEs in DSSCs and studied the effect of edge sites on catalytic activity. The number of edge sites as well as catalytic activity increases as the graphite and GNP particle size decreases.44,194,195 To increase topological defects, Kong and Li used a template-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach to synthesize 3D nanomesh graphene frameworks (NGFs) (Fig. 12).196 To synthesize NGFs, they deposited graphene frameworks on a MgO template, which they removed by hydrochloric acid washing. The result was a 3D nanomesh graphene framework. They used field-emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods to confirm topological defects and mesoporosity. The synergetic effect of a large surface area integrated with the improved surface edge defects make 3D NGFs a very efficient electrocatalyst toward the I3− reduction reaction. Indeed, a DSSC with an NGF CE displays a PCE of 7.32%, which is analogous to that of a Pt CE (7.28%).

To date, different techniques have been used to produce “pristine” graphene, such as liquid exfoliation,197 mechanical exfoliation (“Scotch Tape” method),180 epitaxial growth,198 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).199 Modified Hummer methods are used to produce large quantities of graphene oxide (GO) through the exfoliation of graphite and subsequent reduction.200,201 Graphene produced by this method is known as reduced graphene oxide (rGO); it contains few oxygens as impurities. Xu et al. first applied chemically reduced graphene oxide (CR-GO) film as a CE in a DSSC.202 The PCE (2.2%) for CR-GO film as CE is higher compared to bare FTO (PCE = 0.05%), but many developments would be needed to achieve the efficiency of the typical Pt electrode (PCE = 4.0%). Although the oxygen functional group in the graphene structure is considered to be a catalytic active site, highly oxygenated graphene shows low electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is important to optimize the number of oxygen functional groups in rGO. Aksay et al. investigated the performance of oxygen-functionalized graphene sheets (OF-GS), synthesized via the thermal exfoliation of GO, as a CE in a DSSC. They found that the charge transfer resistance of OF-GS is 10 times higher compared to that of Pt without any applied potential. However, at the bias potential of 0.8 V, its charge transfer resistance is similar to that of a Pt CE. They also explored the consequence of modifying catalytic functional groups on OF-GS and found that increasing the content of oxygen functional groups may augment the catalytic activity of OF-GS. A C-to-O ratio lower than 13 provides optimum efficiency for DSSCs, near to a Pt CE.203
Heteroatom (N, B, S, P, chlorine [Cl], selenium [Se], and Te, among others) doping is also an effective method to enhance the catalytic activity of graphene-based materials. Heteroatoms can be introduced directly into the graphene network by CVD or via a solvothermal process during graphene generation.204,205 Furthermore, heteroatoms can be doped through post-treatment of graphene or GO, such as thermal annealing, ball milling, and plasma treatment.206–208 N-Doped materials are by far the most studied doped graphene materials. To use the synergetic effect of both topological defects and the N heteroatom, Wang and Li synthesized nitrogen-doped holey graphene (NHG) (Fig. 13).208 The generated NHG shows high conductivity (3100 S m−1) and a distinctive holey scaffold with abundant edge-induced topological defects and a large surface area (1874 m2 g−1). Due to these special properties, NHG displays excellent electrocatalytic activity with extraordinary electrochemical stability toward the I−/I3− redox reaction. A DSSC fabricated with an NHG CE shows a PCE of 9.07%, which is higher than that of the Pt CE (8.19%). In addition, the authors performed density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to further clarify the core mechanism after this boosting performance. They found that pyridinic and pyrrolic N satisfy the interaction threshold values of Eads (0.33–1.20 eV) for I3− reduction. Furthermore, edge-induced topological defects, including five-carbon and seven-carbon rings, can indeed act as catalytically active sites to greatly enhance the catalytic activity for the IRR, especially a seven-carbon ring.

To use the synergetic effect of different heteroatoms, multiple heteroatoms such as N, B, P, S, and O, are doped into the graphene structure.209–212 The catalytic mechanism of different heteroatoms is considered to be distinctive. Therefore, co-doping is hypothesized to significantly enhance catalytic activity due to the greater influence in energy bandgap, spin, and charge density. Furthermore, co-doping may increase the electrochemical stability and introduce a new route for catalysis, where carbon atoms can also be an active site for catalysts.212,213
Our group studied a series of edge-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (EFGnPs) as metal-free CEs in DSSCs with different sensitizers.207,214–224 We produced EFGnPs with a simple and environmentally friendly method, namely ball milling the desire substances (halogens, nonmetals, semimetals, or metalloids) with graphite (Fig. 14a). Edge-functionalization reduces the van der Waals forces of the graphene layers and facilitates their exfoliation. We utilized atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AR-TEM) to ensure the pristine graphene basal plane and edge-selective Se doping in the SeGnPs (Fig. 14b and c). Our nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) and DFT calculations confirm that the single-coordinated Se-doping (CSe) for both the zigzag and armchair edges well satisfies the I atom binding criterion, with adsorption energies of 0.48 and 0.77 eV, respectively (Fig. 14d).

Moreover, we elucidated the I3− reduction mechanism using NEGF and DFT calculations. The iodine reduction reaction (IRR) simulated diagram on the SeGnP surface is shown in Fig. 14e based on electrochemical kinetics and DFT and NEGF results. The initial arc is considered due to the transmission resistance (Rtm) in addition to capacitance (Cad) originated from the adsorption of I−/I3− on the graphitic basal plane, and the second arc is due to the Rct with double-layer capacitance (Cdl) with regard to IRR at the edge of the Se-doped graphene and electrolyte interface (Fig. 14f, bottom diagram). We confirmed this by the monitoring the disappearance of the first semicircle at the elevated temperature (Fig. 14f, top diagram). With increasing temperature, thermodynamic variations of the graphene and I−/I3− redox couple will rigorously reduce the binding strength between the two and finally start desorption of I−/I3− from the graphitic basal plane.
Recently, Xia et al. proposed a detailed design rule for p-block heteroatom-doped (X) graphene as effective IRR catalysts using DFT calculations (Fig. 14g–l).225 Almost all of the X-doped graphene nanoribbons have comparatively lower adsorption energy with respect to Pt (−0.56 V). A heteroatom with higher electronegativity shows the highest polarization effect in the graphene structure; however, strong electronegativity boosts its interaction with the adsorbates and, consequently, leads to low catalytic activity. Therefore, the electronegativity of the heteroatoms should be modest. In the volcano plots, boron (B)-, N-, O-, S-, and Se-doped graphene sheets are located near the summit, where both the overpotential and the adsorption energy are equivalent to zero; this location signifies the highest catalytic activities. Furthermore, another descriptor:ϕ = EXAX/ECAC,where EX and EC are electronegativities of the dopant and carbon, AX and AC are electron affinities of the dopant and carbon, describes the catalytic activity of doped carbon nanomaterials for IRR in DSSCs. According to this descriptor, a lower ϕ value indicates better catalytic activity. The dopant amount or number of active sites also play a critical role in catalytic activity. The normalized current density increases with more active sites, and catalytic activity is higher than that of Pt when the value of ϕ is smaller than 3. The detailed information of graphene CEs and their electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties in DSSCs are summarized in Table 5.

2.2.4. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for dye-sensitized solar cells. 
CNTs are continuous cylinders comprise one or more layers of graphene, with open or closed ends.290 CNTs are associated with the fullerene structural group, also recognized as tubular fullerenes or buckytubes. Considering the number of graphene layers, CNTs are called single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), with a typical diameter of 0.8–2 nm or 5–20 nm, respectively. However, MWCNT diameters can exceed 100 nm. MWCNTs are a collection of nested tubes that are held together by van der Waals forces (similar to graphene sheets). They can have anywhere from 2 to more than 100 tubes (walls). CNT lengths range from less than 100 nm to a few centimeters, providing a length-to-diameter ratio equal to 132000000:1, considerably higher than any other materials. CNTs are bound with each other through “dispersion forces” and have diverse structures, including a vertically-aligned CNT forest, CNT bundles, horizontally aligned CNTs, a random network of interconnected CNTs, etc.
Pristine CNTs are seamless cylinders, but unlike pristine graphene, they have some catalytic activity that originates from metallic impurities, pyramidalization, and misalignment of pi-orbitals and sidewall defects.291,292 In 2003, Suzuki et al. first used SWCNTs as a CE in DSSCs; they perform better compared to other carbon nanomaterials (carbon filament and carbon nanohorn), with a PCE of 4.5%, which is analogous to the cell-based on Pt-sputtered CE under the same conditions.293 Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) and triple-walled carbon nanotubes (TWCNTs) are more catalytically active than SWCNTs and MWCNTs.292,294 The lower catalytic activity of SWCNTs is likely due to the disruption of the π-electron system and electronic conductivity of SWCNTs by the adsorption of foreign elements during electrocatalytic processes. However, outer wall defects in DWCNTs act as catalytic sites while the inner wall act as a metallic electron conductor.295 With regard to the outer wall and inner tube distance in the range of electron tunneling, the effective electron transmission from the outer wall to the inner tubes may occur through electron tunneling under the electrochemical polarization driving force.296 This electron tunneling process would become less favorable as the number of walls increases due to the decreasing polarization effect across the inner tubes.292 Therefore, CNTs with different walls show pyramidal catalytic activity. Three different DSSCs based on SWCNTs, DWCNTs, and MWCNTs were fabricated by Zhang et al. The PCE is comparable: 8.03% (DWCNTs) > 7.61% (SWCNTs) > 7.06% (MWCNTs).
CNTs can be metallic or semiconductor, based upon how delocalized electrons dwell in a one-dimensional (1D) density of states. However, SWCNT sidewall functionalization substantially changes electrical properties through the localization of these electrons. Furthermore, sidewall functionalization enhances the dispersibility and processability in aqueous and organic solvents. Different covalent and non-covalent methods are used to functionalize CNTs. Qiu et al. reported plasma-activated oxygen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (P-CNTs) with abundant defect sites (Fig. 15a–f).297 DFT calculations and experimental results confirmed the positive effects of oxygen toward the electrochemical behaviors of I3− reduction. Furthermore, strong plasma activation cleaves the surface of the CNT sidewall to generate more exposed open ends and edges. Notably, a DSSC with a P-CNT CE shows a high PCE of 8.35%, clearly higher than the Pt CE performance (8.04%). DFT calculations revealed that the oxygen species on the surface hydroxyl groups and the carbonyl groups reduce the ionization energy of the P-CNTs through the adjustment of electronic properties of neighboring carbon atoms. This efficiently decreases the charge transfer resistance and hastens electron transfer.

Unlike atomic size and electronegativity, the integration of heteroatoms will result in charge rearrangement of adjacent carbon matrix and distort the lattice order, phenomena that activate unique physicochemical properties. Among various doping elements, electron-reach N and electron-deficient B are believed to be a likely candidate for the efficient chemical-doping of carbon materials. This effect may be due to the lone-pair electron in N and electron vacancy in B, which easily allows to polarize the chemically inactive sp2 carbon network and induce sufficient free-flowing π electrons to act as catalysts for electrochemical applications. Besides, the incorporation of N and B may considerably enhance the conductivity of carbon materials by escalating the density of n- and p-type charge carriers, respectively. To use the synergetic effect of high surface area, edge defects, and heteroatom, Wu et al. prepared bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) by straight pyrolysis of nanostructured Prussian blue analog (metal hexacyanoferrates). The pyrolysis temperature helped control the structure of the resulting carbon materials. At 700 °C, the authors obtained bamboo-like N-CNTs with the desired catalytic properties.299
Chemically altering the CNT surface and incorporating low-cost metal-based nanoparticles is another feasible way to improve the CNT catalytic activity. Specifically, transition metals can influence the carbon structure: they can adjust the electronic structure, WF, and electrical conductivity of carbon materials by electron-donating effect through incompletely filled 3d orbital. Recently, NiS, FeS, FeC, CoTe, CoS, CoSe, and Co2O3 have been reported as an efficient CE for a DSSC.300–306 Li et al. reported rGO wrapped N-doped functionalized MWCNTs incorporated with zinc sulfide quantum dots (ZnS QDs) (Fig. 15g–i).298 Initially, they functionalized MWCNTs with –COOH and –OH groups by using a refluxing strategy. The functional groups act as sites for the nucleation of the ZnS(QDs) as oxygen-containing groups. The ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO have an intertwined distinctive hollow structure with a particular surface area that is suitable for use as a CE. The electrochemical performance showed that at the electrolyte/CE interface, the ZnS@N.f-MWCNTs@rGO electrode has a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a greater catalytic ability than naked ZnS QDs.
Chen et al. reported Co-embedded and N-CNTs supported by Mo2C nanoparticles (Mo2C/N-CNTs@Co) heterostructure as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst (Fig. 16).307 These authors used a simple and straightforward method to synthesize Mo2C/N-CNTs@Co by in situ metal precursor carbonization and nitridation, using cobalt acetate as a Co precursor, (NH4)4Mo7O24 as a Mo precursor, and melamine as a C/N precursor. The DSSC with a Mo2C/N-CNTs@Co CE shows a high PCE of 8.82% and outstanding electrochemical stability, with a remaining efficiency of 7.95% after constant illumination for 200 h; these values are better than the DSSC with a Pt CE. Furthermore, the authors calculated higher catalytic property of Mo2C/N-CNTs@Co with DFT. Specifically, the WF of Co-embedded and N-CNTs is correspondingly regulated from 4.91 to 4.52 eV with an electron-donating effect. In addition, Mo2C nanoparticles display a Pt-like 4d electronic configuration and present a thriving matched WF (4.85 eV) with I−/I3− redox couples (4.90 eV).

The elastic modulus and tensile strength of the CNTs are very high due to covalent sp2 bonds that form between the individual carbon atoms. Espinosa et al. observed that elastic modulus and tensile strength of the cross-sectional area for individual MWNTs are 1 TPa and 100 GPa, respectively.308 The higher elastic modulus and tensile strength of the CNTs makes them favorable for producing flexible and stretchable DSSCs. Different groups have recently reported wire-like DSSCs with high photovoltaic efficiency that contain different structural configurations by exploiting the 1D and flexible properties of CNTs.309–311 Ali et al.309 used TiO2 nanotubes and TiO2 NP-modified Ti-wire as a working electrode and twisted a CoSe@MWCNTs composite fiber as a CE around it. They sealed the resultant wire-like DSSC into a transparent plastic tube with redox electrolyte (Fig. 17a–c). Xue et al.310 utilized TiO2 nanotubes and TiO2 NP-modified photoanode and a 3D graphene-modified CNT fiber CE sidewise in the transparent fluorinated ethylene propylene (FET) tube containing the electrolyte (Fig. 17d–k). Notably, the photovoltaic efficiency of the wire-like DSSCs fabricated with modified CNT fiber CE is much higher compared to the Pt wire CE. The detailed information of carbon nanotube counter electrodes and their electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties in DSSCs are summarized in Table 6.

2.2.5. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) for dye-sensitized solar cells. 
CNFs comprise MWCNTs, where stacked graphene layers are organized as cones, cups, or plates (Fig. 18). Unlike MWCNTs, stacked graphene layers in CNFs are less ordered and mostly graphitic. Depending upon the CNF type, diameters range from 50–200 nm (almost 10 times larger than MWCNTs), and the walls are thicker compared to CNTs.

CNFs have high mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, a large surface area, and high catalytic activity, all of which are almost comparable to CNTs.352–354 However, the CNF synthetic process is easier and cheaper compared to CNTs. Hence, CNFs are a hopeful candidate as a CE for DSSCs.355 Electrospinning (ES)356 and vapor deposition, including catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD),357 arc discharge,290 and radio frequency glow discharges,358 are usually applied to synthesize CNFs. Among these methods, ES and CCVD are the most widely used methods to generate CNFs. Joshi et al.355 first employed ES CNFs as an electrocatalyst and low-cost alternative to Pt for I3− reduction in DSSCs. The CNF CE exhibits low charge transfer resistance, high capacitance, and fast reaction rates for I3− reduction. The CNF-based DSSC reaches an η of 5.5% under one sun illumination. These authors also noted that the FF and η may be significantly enhanced by using thinner and highly porous CNFs to reduce the thickness of the CE.
The CNF catalytic properties rely on the degree of graphitization, structural defects, functional heteroatoms, and surface area. Highly graphitic CNFs feature a well-developed graphene orientation in CNFs structure, and high-temperature heat treatments can considerably prompt the orientation of the graphene layer and increase the extent of graphitization of CNFs. Liu and Wang synthesized a flexible CNF mat using alkaline lignin-based solutions containing poly (vinyl alcohol) via ES (Fig. 19a–h).359 They examined the effect of carbonization temperature. Notably, graphitizing degree and SSA remarkably increase when carbonization is performed >1000 °C. The CNF obtained at 1500 °C as binder-free CE in DSSC shows the maximum PCE (up to 7.60%), comparable to that of the DSSCs with a typical Pt CE (7.67%). However, the porosity in CNFs decreases the conductivity due to decreasing contact between the carbon crystalline domain. To increase the catalytic activity and conductivity, Qiu et al. reported coaxial CNFs synthesized from hydrogenated pitch and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) by ES (Fig. 19i–m).360 Planar aromatic hydro-pitch (HP) molecules are more easily transformed into an optically anisotropic, graphitizable carbon structure, while PAN forms a carbonaceous structure with a high N content and abundant defects. Benefiting from the diverse configuration, their procedure produced a novel coaxial core/shell structure, where HP provides the core phase structure and PAN yields the outer shell phase. CNFs containing dual phases show unique characteristics as CEs in DSSCs: the outer shell provides active sites for catalyzing I3− reduction and the core phase mediates charge transport.

CNFs are considered to be one of the best supports for catalytic NPs and polymers due to their low cost, high surface area, thermal and electrical conductivities, and stability. Many researchers have reported that composite CNFs as CEs in DSSCs to increase the catalytic activity and photovoltaic efficiency.361–365 Several methodologies have been used to synthesize CNF-supported catalytic NPs.366–368 Zhang reported in situ synthesis of Co and N-doped carbon nanofibers (Co–N-CNFs) from PAN and Co(NO3)2·6H2O via ES (Fig. 20a–h).366 The N-heteroatom plays a critical role in the nucleation and growth mechanism of metallic NPs, discussed in the previous section. Furthermore, the N-heteroatom increased the hydrophilic nature and interaction between Co NPs and the carbon substrate. This factor offers additional advantages to the catalytic behavior of Co–N-CNFs. DSSCs fabricated using Co–N-CNFs-based CE display a high PCE of 9.05% at one sun illumination, which is significantly higher than that of the most commonly used Pt CE (7.1%).

Transition metal sulfides are considered to be a proficient alternative to valuable Pt metals due to their low cost, exceptional redox properties, and high conductivity. High catalytic activity of transition metal sulfides are expected because of their high SSAs and unique structures, as well as their similar electronic properties with Pt. Recently, Wu et al. prepared flower-like nanosheet molybdenum sulfide on carbon nanofibers (MoS2/CNFs) via impregnation of Mo and S precursor into the CNFs, followed by hydrothermal synthesis of MoS2 (Fig. 20i–p).369 The MoS2/CNF composites exhibit good performance as a CE in a DSSC. A DSSC with MoS2/CNF CEs delivers a PCE of 8.46%, which is even higher than that of the DSSC with CNF CE (6.59%) or Pt CE (7.65%) in the identical conditions.
The mechanical strength of CNFs is similar—but slightly lower—compared to CNTs. This lower mechanical strength is due to the irregular organization of the graphene layers. The strength of CNFs can reach 12 GPa (and even up 30 GPa); therefore, CNFs have also been explored to fabricate flexible and fiber-shaped DSSCs.362,370–372 Zou prepared CoNi2S4 nanoribbon and nanorod on carbon fibers and used them as CEs in fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) (Fig. 21).368 CoNi2S4 nanoribbon-CF-based FDSSC show a high PCE of 7.03%, which is superior to the Pt wire CE (6.45%). Notably, the CoNi2S4 nanorod-CF-based DSSC show a PCE of 4.10%. The higher conversion efficiency of CoNi2S4 nanoribbon-CF-based FDSSC compared to nanorod-CF-based FDSSC is due to their intrinsic properties as well as their different morphological structure. The unique open crystal facet likely contributes to the noteworthy difference in PCE when compared to two 1D CoNi2S4 nanostructures. The detailed information of graphene CEs and their electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties in DSSCs are summarized in Table 7.

3. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
3.1. Working principle of perovskite solar cells
Perovskite materials present excellent light absorption; they are derived from calcium titanate (CaTiO3). The perovskite material can be described by the formula AMX3, where A is an organic or inorganic cation (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium, and Cs = cesium), M is a metal cation (such as lead [Pb], tin [Sn], or mixtures thereof)—with smaller size than that of the A cation—and X is generally a halogen anion (such as C1, bromine [Br], iodine [I], or mixtures thereof). The perovskite crystal structure is depicted in Fig. 22. PSCs have experienced rapid development: the PCE has increased from 3.8 to 25.2% within 11 years,385 mainly due to the following advantageous features: (1) perovskites exhibit broad spectral absorption386,387 from visible to near-infrared; and (2) perovskite materials possess a high absorption coefficient,388,389 high charge carrier mobilities,390 long carrier diffusion lengths,391,392 and small exciton binding energy.393

(c) A schematic diagram of the energy levels and electron transfer processes in a HTM/perovskite/TiO2 cell. (d) An energy level diagram of related material in PSCs that vary in the back electrode. 
The general operating principles of PSCs are illustrated in Fig. 22. When incident light is irradiated to the perovskite layer through a transparent substrate (indium tin oxide [ITO] or FTO glass), photons with an energy greater than the forbidden bandwidth of the perovskite can excite the electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, generating electron–hole pairs in the perovskite film. Then, the hole and electron are separated and transferred from the perovskite to the hole transporting materials (HTMs) and electron transporting materials (ETMs) simultaneously (Fig. 22c). The injected electrons diffuse through the ETM and reach the BE to complete the circuit, where they combine with diffuse holes at the BE. Furthermore, undesired reactions, such as exciton annihilation, non-radiative recombination and the recombination of holes and electrons at the three interfaces (ETM/perovskite, perovskite/HTM and ETM/HTM), reduce the efficiency of the device.
3.2. Back electrodes (BEs) for PSCs
The BE in a PSC plays a vital role in hole extraction and collection process from the valence band (VB) of perovskite layer or the HOMO of the HTM to the BE. In contrast to a CE in a DSSC, a BEs in a PSC does not require electrocatalytic activity. However, a BE requires a suitable WF for better energy level alignment and hole collection from the perovskite layer or the HOMO of the HTM. Furthermore, a BE's electric conductivity and film morphology should also be seriously considered to reduce the series resistance and make a good physical contact in the interface of perovskite/BE layers, which are crucial for the photovoltaic performance of device. Currently, the most widely used BEs in state-of-the-art PSCs are noble metals, such as Au and Ag. These metals possess a low sheet resistance (Rsq) as well as high light reflectivity. However, Ag reacts with the iodide ions in the perovskite layer to generate AgX, which degrades perovskite film.394–396 On the other hand, Au BEs usually faces metal migration through the HTM into perovskite films. This phenomenon leads to the dramatic performance degradation of the devices.397–399 These Au and Ag drawbacks will hamper the scalable commercialization and long-term stability of PSCs.
Al has a low WF of 4.3 eV and is typically used as a BE in inverted PSCs. However, Al exhibits high constraints as a PSC electrode due to its high reduced power originating from its comparatively low standard reduction potential of −1.66 V. Zhao et al. employed in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) to show that Al0 can reduce Pb+ to Pb0 in H2O and dimethylformamide (DMF) even without the requirement of oxygen or light, and thus convert TiO2/Al2O3/carbon (MAPbI3) to (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O and later methylammonium iodide (MAI).400 In addition, some alternative non-metal BEs have already been developed for PSCs, including carbon and the polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). To replace the expensive metal electrode, various carbon BEs have been developed as alternatives; they present excellent function due to their hydrophobic features, suitable electronic properties, and excellent chemical and thermal stability.401 In the following section, we comprehensively illustrate and emphasize the development of various carbons as alternative BEs to metal electrodes (Ag, Al, and Au). We present the characteristics of different carbon BEs, their fabrication methods, and the performance of devices with carbon-based BEs. We hope that this review will give researchers more insights into non-metal carbon BEs for PSCs and their contribution to boost future PSC commercialization.
3.3. Carbon BEs for PSCs
Carbon materials are abundant, low cost, and have high electrical conductivity, chemical stability, diversity, and modifiability.402 They usually have a WF of 5.0 eV, which is close to that of Au (5.1 eV). Hence, they can be potential BEs for PSC. Carbon pastes (usually a composite of graphite and CB), CNTs, or graphene have been used in carbon-based PSCs.403

3.3.1. Carbon pastes for PSCs. 
Carbon pastes composed of graphite and CB are the earliest and most popular carbon materials used in PSC devices. So far, there are two main device configurations for the carbon pastes as PSC BE applications (Fig. 23). One architectural design consists of a mesoporous triple layer with an insulator space layer, also known as meso-PSC (Fig. 23a). In this device, before the deposition of the perovskite layer, an ETM of mesoporous TiO2, an insulator spacer layer (ZrO2 or Al2O3), and a mesoporous carbon BE layer are sequentially deposited. The obtained scaffold is then processed at a high temperature to improve the adhesion and physical contact of the assembled layers. Finally, the perovskite film is formed via the infiltration of perovskite precursor solution through the mesoporous triple layer of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon. The insulating ZrO2 layer prohibits direct contact of carbon with the TiO2 layer. In this architecture, various parameters may affect perovskite precursor infiltration, such as the size of graphite, CB, the thickness, and even the morphology of carbon film, as well as the related parameters of insulating spacer layer (ZrO2). Hence, these parameters should be thoughtfully considered.

A conventional type PSC represents another design architecture (Fig. 23b); it excludes the insulating spacer layer. The carbon electrode is deposited onto top of the perovskite film; thus, the carbon film should be processed at low temperature to avoid the thermal degradation of the perovskite film. Additionally, the processing solvent for the carbon paste should not damage the under perovskite film. Therefore, the following aspects should be seriously considered when employing carbon paste for conventional PSCs; (i) processing temperature; (ii) processing solvent for carbon paste; (iii) deposition method; (iv) the WF of the carbon film, to enable efficient hole extraction and collection; and (v) the conductivity of carbon film.
3.3.1.1. Device configuration with mesoporous triple layers including an insulator space layer. 
For the mesoporous triple layer C-PSC device configuration, an insulating layer of ZrO2,404,405 Al2O3,406 or SiO2407 is required to be inserted between the TiO2 and carbon layer. This insulating layer plays a vital role to prevent the ETM from making direct physical contact with the CB electrode. The carbon paste is finally deposited on the top of the FTO substrate/compact TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/ZrO2 or Al2O3 insulating layer. In addition, the TiO2/insulator layer (ZrO2 or Al2O3)/mesoporous carbon layer serve as the scaffold to support the deposition of perovskite light absorbing layer by the infiltration-drying-crystallization process.407–413
Generally, carbon paste electrodes employ CB and graphite as the main components. They are usually applied in mesoporous triple layer with insulator layer type PSCs due to the mesoporous character. Graphite is the vital component with regard to determining the porosity and conductivity of a CB electrode. In 2014, Han et al. first investigated the effect of graphite size in the CB/graphite BE on the device performance of HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs.414 They demonstrated that an 8 μm graphite carbon BE possessing a larger pore size is beneficial for the filling of perovskite precursors through the mesoporous carbon layer. Meanwhile, the conductivity characterization results indicated that 8 μm graphite carbon BE exhibits a smaller Rsq (square resistance) and, hence, a higher PCE up to 11.65%, with a FF value of 0.72, compared with other graphite size-based devices (Fig. 24a–h).

Increasing the conductivity of carbon BEs can help lower the series resistance of the device; this endeavor increases the FF value of a PSC. The introduction of functional additives of acetic acid and titanium(IV) isopropoxide to carbon paste prior to the ball milling process increase the conductivity.415 The electrical conductivity of this newly developed carbon film is up to 1.13 × 104 S m−1 due to the in situ generation of newly complex polymeric Ti–O–Ti species that act as a binder and plasticizer. Thus, a PSC based on a carbon paste BE treated by acetic acid and titanium(IV) isopropoxide achieves a high efficiency of 14.04%.
Heteroatom doping of carbons has been widely used for CNTs416 and graphene.417,418 Furthermore, the hole extraction ability and a WF of carbon BE are crucial for HTM-free carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs).419 Thus, doping the graphite with heteroatoms may be a feasible strategy for tuning the WF and conductivity of a graphite-based BE.420,421 One study doped graphite with B by a ball milling process of graphite powder with a 5% mass ratio of boron carbide (B4C) followed carbonization at 900 °C for 2 h prior to the graphitization. This process increases the WF and enhances conductivity due to higher graphitization.39 Thus, the hole extraction from perovskite to the carbon electrode is facilitated, leading to much improved efficiency from 12.4% for the pristine graphite BE-based PSC to 13.6% for the boron-doped BE-based PSC due to an improved open-circuit voltage and FF. In another study, oxygen-rich carbon black (ORC), which has a high oxygen content, elevates the WF of a BE and improves the interface contact between carbon BE and perovskite layer.422 When combined with the p-type characteristic of ORC, the hole extraction from perovskite to a ORC BE is considerably enhanced. Thus, an HTM-free C-PSC based on ORC BE exhibits a higher Voc of 980 mV compared to an oxygen-deficient carbon black (ODC)-based device with a Voc of 880 mV (Fig. 24i–k).
Based on the features of triple mesoporous layer device structure, the penetration of perovskite solution through carbon and ZrO2 films to reach the ETM is crucial. The main role of the insulating spacer layer for C-PSCs is to separate the ETM and carbon BE, and thus prevent the electrons in the ETM from being transported to the carbon electrode. To improve the separating property of the insulating layer and ensure high performance in C-PSCs, many factors should be considered: the particle size of the insulating spacer layer, film morphology, a wide bandgap of the spacer layer, the thickness of the insulating layer and interfacial contact of the perovskite/ZrO2 (or Al2O3).405,409,423,424 A device without a ZrO2 spacer layer shows rather poor device performance, delivering a PCE of only 1.56% because the electrons in the TiO2 may directly leak to the carbon BE. The efficiency improves markedly to 5.92% in the presence of 0.3 μm ZrO2, and it further increases to 10.3% when inserting a 1 μm ZrO2 film. However, a very thick ZrO2 layer may limit the carrier diffusion length and decrease the device efficiency.391,392 Han et al.425 systematically investigated the spacer layer parameters of design points for the triple mesoporous layer structures of C-PSCs. They proposed that an efficient spacer layer for C-PSCs should possess the following features: (a) pore size >100 nm, (b) high porosity, and (c) excellent insulating property with an ultra-thin film thickness.
Zhou et al.407 investigated SiO2 paste as a low cost insulating layer to replace ZrO2. With this replacement, the PCE is 13.09%, which is comparable to a device with a ZrO2 spacer layer. Furthermore, the PCE of devices without encapsulation decreases from the initial value of 13.09% to the final value 12.33% after storage under ambient air conditions for 104 days (50–70% relative humidity). The authors mainly attributed this loss to the thick and condensed carbon films providing a heavy barrier again air (H2O/O2) as well as the chemical stability of SiO2 paste.
Inserting a P-type layer (NiO410 or WO3426,427) between the insulating layer and carbon film is also an efficient way to improve photovoltaic performance because it reduces carrier recombination and benefits the hole extraction rate. In 2015, Wang et al. employed NiO/Al2O3 as a spacer layer to prevent the direct contact of TiO2 and carbon BE in MAPbI3-based C-PSCs.410 The presence of an NiO layer between Al2O3 and the carbon BE significantly improves the Jsc value from 17.59 mA cm−2 for the parent TiO2/Al2O3/carbon (MAPbI3)-based device to 21.62 mA cm−2 for the TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon (MAPbI3)-based device (Fig. 25a–c). Moreover, the NiO-containing device provides a higher Voc value of 915 mV, compared to 896 mV for the parent device without the NiO layer, due to the reduced charge carrier recombination. This outcome is attributed to the dual roles of the spacer layer as well as the HTM. The PCE of the device with the NiO layer is markedly higher (15.03%) compared to that of the device without NiO (11.2%). Considering the appropriate position of the WO3 conduction band, Bhandari et al. incorporated p-type inorganic WO3 nanoparticle into the carbon BE to promote hole extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface for C-PSCs.426,427 It was found that the device performance can be significantly influenced depending on the amount of incorporated WO3 additive into the carbon BE. The optimal amount of WO3 additive by volume (7.5%) gives the highest device PCE (10.3%), compared to 7.4% for the control device without WO3 additive.

Compared to conventional HTM-based PSCs, recombination at the interfaces of ETM/perovskite and perovskite/BE, where the generated electrons recombine with holes, is a more serious issue in HTM-free C-PSCs due to the direct contact of carbon and TiO2.428,429 Therefore, the Voc value of C-PSCs are usually lower compared to conventional HTM-based PSCs. To avoid the recombination at the interfaces of ETM/perovskite and perovskite/BE is crucial to increase the Voc value of C-PSCs. Surface modification of ETMs by insulating materials, such as MgO,430 Al2O3,431,432 or La2O3,433 suppresses the charge recombination and enhances the Voc of devices in conventional PSCs. Similarly, the surface modification of the mesoporous TiO2 by inserting an additional ultrathin Al2O3 layer with a ZrO2 spacer layer increases the efficiency—due to minor charge recombination—and thus enhances the Voc of the device (Fig. 25d–f).434 Furthermore, inserting a thin Al2O3 insulating layer is favored to reduce the expensive ZrO2 spacer layer without a loss of efficiency.435
From the aspect of perovskite composition engineering, partially substituting the MA cation with a 5-AVA group,411 or replacing the anion of I− with BF4−,436 or introducing a triple cation to the perovskite film can help to deposit a high quality perovskite film with low defect concentrations and improve carrier transport. These factors lead to better device performance. The incorporation of 5-AVA to perovskite precursor decreases defect concentrations and improve pore filling via the formation of linear hydrogen-bonded chains between COOH and NH3+ groups from 5-AVA and I− ions from the PbI6 octahedron. Thus, a (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3-based PSC shows a significantly improved efficiency (up to 11.6%) compared to 7.2% for a MAPbI3-based device. Besides, a (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3-based device exhibits long-term stability (>1000 h) under full sunlight in ambient air (Fig. 25g–i). Based on the same device configuration, partially substituting I− of perovskite with BF4− markedly improves efficiency from 10.54% to 13.24% due to enhanced charge transport and reduced charge recombination (Fig. 25j–l).436 Using triple cation perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 as a light absorber martial—instead of MAPbI3—demonstrated that the presence of Cs in perovskite layer can extend the carrier diffusion length (electron diffusion lengths of 140 nm and hole diffusion lengths of 1.9 μm). These alterations benefit charge transport in mesoporous layers.437 Therefore, PSCs based on Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI2.8Br0.2 show a PCE of 17.02%, with a Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.008 V, and a FF of 0.72. Meanwhile, a devices based on the Cs doped triple cation exhibited excellent stability, with a retention of >90% initial PCE after stored in dark conditions at 85 °C for 1020 h.
Zhang et al.438 pre-passivated the triple mesoporous layer of TiO2/ZrO2/C by dipping the mesoporous triple layer scaffold into a 0.2 mM PbI2 solution in DMF for 30 min at room temperature. They then rinsed the triple layer scaffold in DMF to get rid of loosely bound PbI2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization showed the formation of C–O–Pb linkages via the reaction of –OH on the carbon surface with PbI2. The PCE of the pre-passivated device significantly improves to 7.3% compared to the device without pretreatment of PbI2 by one-step method for perovskite deposition (2.21%). This increased efficiency is due to the reduced carrier recombination.
Investigation on the precursor solvent showed that an optimized DMF/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) ratio (0.93:0.07, v/v) provides better wettability and excellent perovskite film quality because of a suitable compromise between the solvent's polarity and viscosity.439 The device based on this optimal solvent has a PCE of 13.89% due to the improved light harvesting ability and the enhanced charge separation of the perovskite (Fig. 26a–c). Additives, like guanidinium chloride (GuCl), improve the quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber and suppress recombination in the device (Fig. 26d).440 The suppressed recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface is considered due to the exchange hydrogen-bonding interaction between –C(NH2)3+ and halide ions (from N–H⋯Cl− to N–H⋯I−). The three –NH2 groups in GuCl may increase the linking of the neighboring MAPbI3, thus helping the crystal growth in contact with each other more tightly (Fig. 26e–j). A device with pristine MAPbI3 shows a PCE of 9.10% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 15.10 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.68. The device fabricated with MAPbI3·xGuCl presents a much higher PCE of 14.35% and Voc of 1.00 V, and an enhanced Jsc of 19.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.743.

The perovskite layer is sensitive and unstable when exposed to water and moisture, ultraviolet light, and thermal stress.441–443 Beyond PSC degradation due to the poor perovskite layer stability, device instability can be also accelerated by the instability of the other layers in the full device. For example, the dopants used in organic HTM layer are hydrophilic and, consequently, reduce device stability.444,445 Thus, it is crucial to improve the stability of the perovskite layer, HTM, and BE to ensure the full device is stable. Rong et al. carried out moisture-induced transformation of perovskite crystals in a triple-layer scaffold of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon to fabricate printable mesoscopic solar cells. The employed ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as an additive to assist the perovskite crystallization, wherein the formation and transition of intermediate CH3NH3X·NH4PbX3(H2O)2 (X = I or Cl) enables high-quality perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 crystals with a preferential growth orientation (Fig. 26k and l). A device based on CH3NH3PbI3 achieves an average PCE of 13.92%, with a champion efficiency of 15.60% and a lifetime of over 130 days in ambient air with 35% relative humidity. This design and strategy suggest promising prospects for further mass production of perovskite-based photovoltaics and will significantly promote the development of perovskite-based photovoltaics.446
In 2017, Nazeeruddin et al. prepared triple mesoporous layer structure carbon electrode-based PSCs that are stable for 1 year by the combination of incorporation of moisture stable 2D perovskite layer and HTM-free carbon-based BE (Fig. 26m and n).31 This ultra-stability is due to the use of mixed perovskites—2D perovskite (5-AVA)2PbI4 and 3D perovskite CH3NH3PbI3—which form a 2D/3D interface in the devices. The 10 × 10 cm2 PSC solar modules prepared via a fully printable industrial-scale process show 11.2% efficiency and the device stability for >10000 h with zero loss in efficiency measured under controlled standard conditions. Table 8 shows the summary information of carbon-based perovskite solar cells with device structure of TiO2/insulating spacer layer/carbon past/perovskite.

3.3.1.2. Conventional device architecture without an insulating layer. 
A triple mesoporous layer-based C-PSC requires an additional ZrO2 insulating layer and high processing temperature for interfacial bonding. These factors increase the energy cost. Furthermore, its application for a flexible C-PSC is limited due to high temperature processing. However, the conventional device architecture for a C-PSC usually comprises FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/carbon paste or FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/HTM/carbon paste. In the above device configuration, perovskite is first deposited onto the mesoporous TiO2 layer. Except for the perovskite crystal infiltrated into mesoporous TiO2, a perovskite capping layer is also built; it physically prevents direct contact of TiO2 and the carbon BE. Thus, an insulating spacer layer is not required to reduce carrier recombination. Then, a carbon BE is deposited on top of the perovskite layer or HTM layer. Finally, the device is sintered at a low temperature—considering the instability of the perovskite layer. Moreover, low-temperature (<150 °C) processing allows the device fabrication on the flexible substrate. Given the features of conventional device architecture for C-PSCs, in this section we discuss the carbon film, HTM incorporation, and ETM optimization.
Ma et al.450 developed a carbon electrode by doctor-blade coating carbon paste dispersed in chlorobenzene, followed by drying at 70 °C for 40 min. The authors showed that the square resistance of carbon film is decreased as its thickness increases. And thus giving effect toward the photovoltaic performance of the device. At the optimal carbon film thickness (∼20 μm), the PCE is 9.08% (Fig. 27a–g).

A graphite layer tends to produce an interspace between the graphite flakes and perovskites due to its lamellar nature.451 Thus, without a spacer layer, a HTM-free conventional C-PSC device usually suffers from poor contact at perovskite/carbon interface. To improve the contact sites at the perovskite/carbon BE interface, Meng et al. investigated the effect of graphite flake size on C-PSC performance. A carbon BE made of small graphite flakes exhibits higher performance compared to when larger graphite flakes are used. This phenomenon occurs because BEs made with smaller graphite particles have more contact sites with the perovskite film and thus there is reduced charge transfer resistance during hole extraction from the perovskite to carbon BEs.451 The PCE is further improved to a maximum of 10.2% when incorporating 20 wt% small CB particles (Fig. 27h–j). Hagfeldt et al.452 developed a CB BE by incorporating a low-cost carbon cloth into the carbon paste. When a carbon cloth is embedded into carbon paste as BE for a PSC, the device exhibits a PCE up to 15.29%, with a Jsc of 20.4 mA cm−2, an excellent Voc of 1.12 V, and a high FF of 0.67. By contrast, an insulating carbon fiber embedded into the carbon paste as a control BE shows a poor PCE (8.7%) with a very low FF (0.429).
Bio-carbons are a potential carbon material with an ultra-low-cost; they can be prepared by biomass pyrolysis. Very recently, Gao et al.453 developed economical and eco-friendly bio-carbons as PSC BEs. The authors examined four biomasses—corn stalks, peanut shells, Phragmites australis, and bamboo chopsticks—to prepare bio-carbons via a carbonization process under nitrogen flow. The device performance of C-PSCs based on different bio-carbon BEs is affected by the combination effects from the morphology of these bio-carbons, the interfacial connection, WF, and the sheet resistance of the bio-carbons. Bamboo chopstick bio-carbons exhibit a suitable WF (4.80 eV) for better energy level alignment, lower radiative recombination, and faster carrier transport in C-PSCs compared to other bio-carbon BE based devices. Thus, the C-PSCs based on bamboo chopstick bio-carbon BE produce the highest PCE of 12.82% (Fig. 28a–g). PSCs based on a bio-carbon BE are more stable than that of conventional devices. Indeed, they maintain 87% of the initial PCE after stored at room temperature for 2000 h.

With regard to conventional C-PSCs, the carbon layer is directly deposited on top of the pre-deposited perovskite films. Thus, the processing solvent for the carbon paste should not damage the underlying perovskite film. The ideal processing solvent for carbon paste should possess the following properties: (i) the solvent should not dissolve the lower perovskite film; and (ii) the solvent should sufficiently dissolve the binder to ensure the homogeneity of the carbon film. Based on a detailed investigation, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) emerged as the processing solvent for carbon paste that is most friendly to perovskite.454 A C-PSC device based on the PGMEA method shows a much higher PCE of 13.5% compared to using a device with a commercial carbon BE (5.26%). Furthermore, some fast solvent evaporation processes may be used to avoid the damage of underlying perovskite layer. Yang et al.455 used a simple and efficient gas pump process to significantly shorten the solvent evaporation time in the carbon paste. This procedure leads to a uniform and continuous surface morphology in the perovskite film. The as-prepared C-PrSCs based on gas pump method showed a PCE of 12.3% and a Voc of 1.03 V, values that are much higher than that of the control device, with a PCE of 4.73% and Voc of 0.81 V.
Separate fabrication of a carbon film followed by stacking it on the perovskite layer represents another solution to avoid possible damage to the perovskite layer. However, there is reduced interfacial bonding at the perovskite and carbon interface. To address this drawback, Meng et al.456 fabricated a free-standing flexible carbon film containing 20 wt% thermoplastic poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) as a BE by doctor blading. They then directly hot-pressed the BE on top of perovskite film at 85 °C. Strong interfacial bonding is formed during hot pressing due to the thermoplasticity of PVAc. After optimizing the weight ratio of graphite flakes and CB in the carbon film, the champion device based on the free-standing carbon film exhibits a PCE of 13.53%.
To improve interface contact between the perovskite layer and carbon BE, while maintaining efficient charge separations and enhancing the hole extraction ability, HTMs are usually inserted between the perovskite layer and carbon BE.452,457–461 Sun et al. observed a remarkable PCE of 16.1% by incorporating CuPc nanorods as an HTM to enhance hole extraction between the MAPbI3 film and carbon BE (Fig. 28h–k).462 The CuPc nanorods are usually deposited via thermal vapor deposition, which is complicated (e.g. high-vacuum conditions are required) and costly due to the poor solubility of CuPc. To improve CuPc solubility, the authors developed a solution-processable CuPc-TIPS with hydrophobic triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) groups. The champion C-PSC based on CuPc-TIPS exhibits the highest efficiency of 14.0%. Furthermore, the device exhibits good long-term stability in the dark at ambient conditions (∼35% relative humidity). After 720 h, the best device maintained about 90% of its initial PCE (from 14.0% to 12.5%) because the hydrophobic CuPc-TIPS HTM interlayer prevents moisture from penetrating the perovskite layer.463 Another group incorporated the small organic molecule 5,10,15-triphenyl-5Hdiindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole (TPDI) into C-PSCs as a HTM; this process does not require a vacuum. This device has a PCE 15.5% and a FF up to 0.75.464 Li et al.465 incorporated an inorganic HTM (NiOx nanoparticles) into carbon paste and found a PCE of 13.26% compared to 10.29% of a device with a pure carbon BE. Moreover, the C-PSC maintains 85% of the initial efficiency after storage at ambient conditions for 800 h.
From perovskite film processing, to improve the interfacial contact of perovskite/carbon layer, Chen et al.466 proposed a solvent engineering method based on a two-step sequential method to realize a uniform and compact perovskite capping layer. They hypothesized that this process will enhance the contact between the perovskite layer and the carbon BE (mainly composed of CB and graphite flakes). They obtained the highest PCE of 14.38% with a FF of 0.65 and a PCE of 10% for the device with a 1 cm2 area.466 Moreover, through colloidal engineering to form ultra-even perovskite layer, they further boosted the efficiency of the C-PSC to 14.58%.467
Some strategies from the aspects of the ETMs optimization, such as the optimization of TiO2 thickness,468 the chemical doping of TiO2469–471 or SnO2,458 the size and morphology of TiO2,472–475 its surface modification,476–478 and a bilayer of TiO2/SnO2479 improve C-PSC performance.
It was observed that the TiO2 thickness also affected the device performance. In 2014, Sun's group468 deposited a low-temperature-processed (100 °C) carbon BE by doctor-blading technology. They then deposited the carbon BE on the already-deposited perovskite layer. After optimization, the HTM-free perovskite/TiO2 device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 8.31% and excellent stability over 800 h (see Fig. 28l–o).
To improve the electron injection efficiency as well as the stability of C-PSCs upon exposure to UV light, Zhao et al.469 developed W-doped TiO2 to enhance electron conductivity. The C-PSC based on W-TiO2 exhibits a high PCE up to 12.06% with an improved Jsc and FF value due to facilitated electron transfer efficiency. Another group investigated Ni-doped rutile TiO2 as an ETM in planar C-PSCs.470 Ni doping shifted up the Fermi level of TiO2 and also increases its electron mobility; these phenomena enhance electron extraction and carrier transport. The planar C-PSC based on 0.01 M Ni doped TiO2 as the ETM (optimal doping level) and with CuPc as the HTM has a PCE up to 17.46%, which is higher than that of using pristine TiO2, with a PCE of 15.82%. The device also exhibits excellent stability, with a retention of >97% of its initial efficiency after stored in ambient air for 1200 h. These works indicate that TiO2 with appropriate heteroatom doping can improve the efficiency and enhance the stability of C-PSCs.
Coating an additional layer (MgTiO3,476 PC61BM,477 or MgO478,480) onto the surface of TiO2 was demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve device performance by reducing interfacial charge recombination. Huang et al.478 coated an ultrathin wide bandgap MgO layer onto mesoporous TiO2. Together with modulating perovskite crystallization with a terephthalic acid additive, the C-PSC device shows a high average PCE of 14.29%. Considering the high temperature sintering and photocatalytic-activity of the TiO2, Zhou et al.481 employed SnO2 with high electron mobility and low photo-catalytic activity as the ETM for planar C-PSCs. With (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 as the light harvesting material and CuPc as the HTM, the prepared C-PSC based on SnO2 shows a higher PCE of 14.2% compared to a C-PSC based on TiO2 (10.46%), with excellent storage stability up to 3600 h. Later, Liao et al.479 utilized a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETM and CuPc as the HTM for C-PSCs. Attributed to the better energy level alignment and inhibited electron–hole recombination, C-PSCs based on the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer shows a best efficiency of 15.39% and excellent stability over 1200 h. Table 9 exhibits the summary information of carbon-based perovskite solar cells with device structure of TiO2/perovskite/carbon past.

3.3.2. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for PSCs. 
CNTs possess excellent thermal and electrical conductivity and are very hydrophobic and highly stable. Hence, they have attracted much attention for electronic and optoelectronic applications.482 CNTs have been employed as p-type contacts for organic or inorganic solar cells.483,484 They possess a suitable WF value in the range of 4.7 to 5.1 eV,485,486 enabling them to be a potential BE or HTM for PSCs. In this section, we summarize the recent progress of CNTs as BEs, including their function in the hole transporting layer. Based on their characteristics, an isolated CNT layer has usually been applied as a BE for conventional C-PSC devices. On the other hand, CNTs with a p-type character and high mobility can be an efficient additive to embed into perovskite layer487,488 or the carbon film488,489 to improve the hole extraction at the perovskite/carbon BE interface.
Li et al. first employed CNTs as a PSC BE.490 They dripped anti-solvent toluene onto the top of the CNT film after the deposition on the perovskite layer to improve the physical interfacial contact of CH3NH3PbI3/CNTs. Toluene does not damage the underlying perovskite film; rather, it wets the surface of both films and thus improves the CH3NH3PbI3/CNT contact. The photoluminescence quenching results indicate the strong adhesion through van der Waals interactions between CH3NH3PbI3 and CNT films. Thus, PSC devices based on this laminated CNT show a PCE of 6.87%, which is higher than 5.14% from a device with an Au BE (Fig. 29a–e). However, the interfacial surface contact between perovskite and CNT suffered an inferior contact. To improve the interfacial surface between the staking of perovskite and CNT, Jang et al.487 dripped anti-solvent containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on perovskite layer prior to the thermal annealing of the perovskite film. This process successfully incorporates MWCNTs into the grain boundaries of the perovskite film to form CNT-perovskite heterojunction, providing channel for rapid hole extraction from perovskite to carbon back electrode. The device based on carbon BE prepared by screen printing by utilizing this strategy showed a high efficiency of 13.57% with less hysteresis, which is attributed to the improved interfacial contact of perovskite and the carbon BE and reduced series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rh).

Yang et al.429 successfully deposited an MWCNT film onto a perovskite film with a seamless contact at the interface of perovskite/MWCNT by a simple ultrasound spray method. The control device based on drop-casted MWCNT BE exhibits a poor PCE of 12.08%, Jsc of 19.31 mA cm−2, FF of 0.712, and Voc of 0.88. However, a C-PSC based on ultrasound spray MWCNT BE shows a higher PCE up to 14.07%, as well as an improved Jsc of 21.03 mA cm−2 and a remarkably high FF of 0.744 and Voc of 0.899 V. This device also shows excellent long-term stability and exhibits almost zero PCE loss after storage in a dry box (15% relative humidity) for 3000 h. Li et al. proposed a CNT bridging method for device fabrication by incorporating SWCNTs in both the perovskite and carbon layers to form a high-quality perovskite/carbon interface (Fig. 29f–i).488 The penetrated CNT bridges into both the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and the carbon BE not only facilitated hole extraction at the interface of CNTs inserted CH3NH3PbI3 film/CNTs incorporated carbon films but also promoted the conductivity of the carbon BE. Attributed to such merits, the prepared C-PSC shows a high PCE up to 15.73% with a good FF of 0.72. Moreover, the CNT bridging method enables the PSC to retain an excellent long-term stability over 90 days under severe conditions (65 ± 5% relatively humidity at 25 ± 5 °C and 25 ± 5% relative humidity at 75 ± 5 °C).
When MWCNT BE was compared with graphite and CB BE. They found that MWCNT tightly attaches to the perovskite layer to form a consecutive and crack-free thin film. The compact MWCNT morphology with the improved contact with the perovskite layer enhances the FF and photovoltaic performance of a HTM-free C-PSC. Furthermore, the MWCNT-based device shows a negligible hysteresis effect. By optimizing the thickness of PbI2 precursor layer and MWCNT layer, a hysteresis-free PCE of 12.67% with an FF of up to 0.80 was achieved.491 Due to the better hole extraction and hole mobility of CNTs compared to CB, Wang et al.489 used a BE that comprises printed carbon paste containing SWCNTs on the top of Al2O3. With this technique, hole extraction from the perovskite to carbon BE is significantly boosted owing to the excellent hole mobility of SWCNTs. After optimization, the champion device based on a carbon BE containing 0.05 wt% SWCNTs achieves an efficiency up to 14.7%, with a high Voc of 1.01 V and a FF of 0.69.489 Under the same conditions, the control device without SWCNTs in the carbon BE shows a lower PCE of 9.9% (Voc = 0.889 V and FF = 0.55). SWCNT incorporation in the carbon BE modifies the WF and also reduces the charge recombination. These phenomena are helpful to improve the Voc and FF of the device performance.
To increase Voc and hole extraction efficiency, optimum energy level alignment is crucial. The WF of MWCNT is very high compared to the valence band (VB) of perovskite; hence, doping MWCNT with atoms that are electron deficient or rich can provide better energy level alignment with perovskite. Yang et al.492 doped MWCNTs with B to decrease the WF and boost hole extraction at the perovskite/MWCNT interface (Fig. 29j–l). Together with the benefits of an additional physical barrier (Al2O3) layer coating onto m-TiO2 to reduce the charge recombination, this device achieves a high PCE up to 15.23%. Moreover, the device maintains 85% and 93% of its highest PCE without encapsulation after 2 weeks of storage under thermal stress (80 °C) and high humidity (∼65% at 25 °C), respectively. These outcomes are attributed to the hydrophobic characteristic of the MWCNTs and the compact interlinked MWCNT network films.
Insertion of an HTM in the perovskite/CNT interface is an effective way to boost hole extraction and reduce interfacial recombination. Aitola et al.493 developed a spiro-OMeTAD infiltrated SWCNT as a C-PSC BE. They deposited the SWCNT film, prepared by the CVD method, on top of the perovskite film by a press-transfer process. They then densified the coated SWCNT film by dropping a small amount of chlorobenzene. To lower the SWCNT BE sheet resistance, they transferred double SWCNT layers onto the perovskite film. The C-PSC device with the above-described BE but without an HTM shows a poor efficiency of 11%. By contrast, a device based on spiro-OMeTAD infiltrated SWCNT BE has a PCE up to 15.5%. Choi et al.494 developed carbon sandwiched PSCs with C60 as the ETM and MAPbI3 as perovskite light absorbing film, together with the infiltration of spiro-OMeTAD into SWCNT. The prepared PSC device shows a markedly higher PCE (17%) compared to polymeric poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) HTM. Indeed, this is a record-high PCE among the laminated CNT BE-based PSCs. Wu et al. inserted an inorganic copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as an HTM between the perovskite and the carbon BE to reduce the electron recombination process.482 As a result, the updated CuSCN and CNT incorporated C-PSC device exhibits a Voc of 1.01 V and a PCE up to 17.58%, as well as enhanced long-term stability (Fig. 30a–d).

Guo et al.495 developed a flexible PSC with an all-carbon electrode by using graphene as a transparent anode and CNTs as the BE. A flexible device containing this all-carbon electrode with and without spiro-OMeTAD HTM shows a PCE of 11.9% and 8.4%, respectively (Fig. 30e–h). The devices also exhibit good robustness against mechanical deformation compared to counterparts fabricated on a flexible ITO substrate. The flexible PSC with an all-carbon electrode also shows noticeably enhanced stability compared to the flexible PSCs based on Au or Ag BE under continuous light soaking or 60 °C thermal stress in air, retaining over 90% of its original PCEs after 1000 h. To enhance the built-in potential and reduce the non-radiative recombination in C-PSCs, Yang et al.496 inserted an ultrathin ferroelectric perovskite oxide (PbTiO3) layer between the TiO2 layer and the perovskite film. The prepared C-PSC shows a remarkable PCE of 16.37%. The significantly improved Voc and PCE are mainly attributed to the enhanced built-in potential in the prepared C-PSC device and reduced non-radiative recombination due to the incorporation of a ferroelectric PbTiO3 layer (Fig. 30i–l). Table 10 shows the summary information of carbon-based perovskite solar cells with conventional device configuration and using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the back electrode.

3.3.3. Graphene for PSCs. 
Graphene, a 2D material, possesses excellent electric conductivity and high mobility, transparency, mechanical flexibility, and specific surface area. Thus, graphene is also considered to be an ideal BE with transparency for C-PSCs. Yan et al.499 prepared a semi-transparent PSC by employing stacked multilayer graphene as a transparent BE onto a PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 31a–d). They deposited the transparent graphene BE on perovskite films by a facile lamination process under pressure at low temperature (≈60 °C), which is compatible with printing and roll-to-roll processing. After optimization, the device with a double-layer graphene BE exhibits the maximum PCE of 12.02% ± 0.32% under illumination from the FTO side and 11.65% ± 0.35% under illumination from the graphene side. Their work indicates that graphene may be an ideal transparent BE material for metal electrode free-based PSCs and tandem photovoltaic devices that utilize perovskite.500

Zhu et al.501 developed nitrogen-doped graphene frameworks (N-GFs) as an excellent carbon BE for an HTM-free C-PSC. The WF of the graphene frameworks are decreased from 5.22 eV of GF to 4.92 eV of N-GF, and thus leading to a more efficient hole extraction from the perovskite film to the carbon BE. A C-PSC with a N-GF-based BE shows a PCE of 10.32%, higher than the PCE of a C-PSC using an undoped graphene frameworks (Jaidev). This enhanced performance is probably due to the superiority of N-GFs in enabling increased charge extraction and transport with reduced charge recombination. This work demonstrates that an N-GF may be a potential BE material to replace expensive organic HTM and noble metal electrodes (Au/Ag) for constructing efficient and low-cost HTM-free C-PSC devices.
Considering the difficult deposition of large scale CVD graphene, rGO is another potential carbon BE material for C-PSCs. Yang et al.502 employed rGO to investigate the effects of WF of graphene on device performance (Fig. 31i–l). First, GO is chemically cleaved from expanded natural graphite flakes, and then single-layer graphene (SG), with a WF of 4.8 eV, and multilayer graphene (MG), with WF of 5.0 eV, are synthesized from the reduction of their oxide (SGO and MGO, respectively) at 1000 °C under an argon atmosphere. Notably, there is a Schottky junction with a rectifying characteristic formed at the MG/perovskite interface that enables effective hole extraction and electron blocking. However, the SG/perovskite interface contact exhibits an ohmic contact behavior with recombination. Thus, the PSC based on a MG BE shows a much high PCE of 11.5%, with a Jsc of 16.7 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.73, and a Voc of 0.943 V, compared to a SG-based PSC, with a PCE of 6.7%, a Jsc of 14.2 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.54, and a Voc of 0.878 V.
Hu et al. prepared a 3D honeycomb-like structured graphene (3DHG) by the reaction of potassium with CO2 and employed it as a BE for HTM-free C-PSCs.503 They deposited the 3DHG on top of perovskite layer by doctor blading. The 3DHG exhibits excellent performance as a BE for an HTM-free C-PSC device, leading to a PCE of 10.06% (Fig. 32a–f). Shi et al. proposed an innovative modular architecture design for C-PSCs by stacking a semi-cell A and charge collector B together (Fig. 32g–k). The individual semi-cell A consisted of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD and the charge collector B fabricated by spraying a carbon source in isopropyl alcohol onto an FTO substrate.504 They compared commercial CB, graphite sheet (GS), and graphene. With graphene, there is sufficient interfacial contact of graphene with adjacent layers through deformation to fit the surface fluctuation of the adjacent functional layers. Thus, graphene is the best carbon BE for C-PSC in this experiment. Based on a graphene BE, a C-PSC device fabricated at low temperatures (≤85 °C) shows the best PCE (up to 18.65%). The prepared device also has excellent stability when exposed to humidity and heating. Moreover, it shows prominent structural flexibility with negligible degradation in efficiency even after repeated disassembly and reassembly (more than 500 times). Table 11 shows the summary information of carbon-based perovskite solar cells with conventional device configuration and using graphene as a back electrode.

4. Conclusions and outlooks
The CE/BE is a key component in DSSCs and PSCs and plays a critical role in the photovoltaic efficiency of the devices. The CE in DSSCs must possess high electrocatalytic ability, high conductivity, high electrochemical and mechanical stability, and good adhesivity with FTO. These properties may increase Voc, Jsc, and FF and, consequently, the PCE of the DSSC. Pt satisfies most of the properties and has been widely employed as the standard CE in DSSCs; however, Pt is a costly and scarce noble metal, and it is thus difficult to use for large-scale applications. Carbon-based materials are promising substitutes for a Pt CE due to their low cost, scalability, and long-term stability. Numerous carbon-based materials, like CB, porous carbon, graphite, graphene, CNTs, and CNFs, have been successfully employed as CEs in DSSCs. The main disadvantages of carbon-based CEs are their low catalytic activity and conductivity compared to a Pt CE, as well as the large quantity required to obtain the desired catalytic activity. Therefore, researchers have attempted to increase the surface area and modify the surface of carbon-based materials through heteroatom doping (N, O, S, B, and P), as well as the incorporation of metals, metalloids, metal oxides, alloy, and polymer to achieve the anticipated performance of the devices.
Among the different types of amorphous carbons, N-doped mesoporous carbon is one of the best choices for a CE in DSSCs. A large surface area increases the catalytic active sites, while heteroatom doping redistributes the spin and charge density of the carbon network and creates highly efficient active sites, where reactant molecules interact more competently. Besides, different defect positions or heteroatoms in carbon substrate may be exploited as active sites for nucleation and growth of metal NPs, which can stabilize the deposited metal NPs that have a small size and narrow distribution.54 Additionally, a doped carbon substrate enhances the surface roughness and oxygen vacancies of metal NPs and metal oxides, factors that also improve the catalytic activity of carbon composites.
Notably, functionalized graphene shows the best catalytic activity toward the iodine and cobalt reduction reaction in DSSCs. Topological defects and the dangling bonds located at the edge of sp2-hybridized carbon basal planes usually render high-energy sites and catalytic centers. Graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) composites, where edge sites are only catalytic sites, as CE in DSSCs, show the highest efficiency.214,218,505,506 Conversely, CNTs and CNFs show lower efficiency compared to functionalized graphene due to fewer active sites and limited capability for functionalization. Due to their higher flexibility and mechanical stability, CNTs and CNFs are the only choice for flexible, stretchable, or wire-shaped DSSCs.309,310,368 However, engineering specific catalytic sites in different carbon materials remains challenging. Thus, more investigations are required to develop a synthetic approach to create well-defined active sites in various carbon-based catalysts. Furthermore, researchers should consider the adjustability of designed CE materials for different electrolytes employed in DSSCs.
Unlike the CE in DSSCs, the catalytic activity of a carbon CE is not required for a BE in PSCs. Carbon materials are cost effective, highly stable, and have a Fermi energy level that is close to an Au electrode. Considering these aspects, carbon materials may be the ideal BE materials for PSCs. However, the efficiency of C-PSCs is relatively low, and there is a gap of over 25% comparing with metal BE-based PSCs, as summarized in Tables 8–11. To minimize this large gap, the following aspects should be considered for developing efficient carbon BEs for C-PSCs. For mesoscopic triple layer type of C-PSCs: (1) a carbon BE must have good conductivity; (2) a carbon BE must have a suitable WF for a better energy level alignment of carbon-based materials with perovskite to ensure efficient hole selectively extraction; (3) the mesoporous carbon layer should have a suitable morphology to allow for efficient perovskite precursor filtration and interfacial contact in perovskite/carbon film; (4) there should be an efficient insulating layer with a wide bandgap, high porosity, and pore size >100 nm with ultra-film thickness.425 For conventional insulating layer-free C-PSCs: (1) a carbon BE must have good conductivity; (2) the carbon BE must have a suitable WF for a better energy level alignment; (3) the processing solvent for carbon paste should not damage the perovskite film; and (4) a suitable organic and inorganic HTM should be inserted to enhance the HTM/carbon composite hole selectively extraction and collection. Furthermore, to improve heterogeneous contact at the carbon BE/perovskite or BE/HTM/perovskite interface, chemical binding, different solvent engineering, and fabrication processes should be investigated, all of which may decrease interfacial recombination. Finally, CNT and CVD graphene may be a potential transparent BE for a bifacial C-PSC490,499 or as a metal-free transparent electrode for a tandem solar cells that involve perovskite.500 In addition, a low-processing temperature for C-PSCs allows their application in flexible devices.
