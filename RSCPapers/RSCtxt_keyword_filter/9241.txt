    , Accepted 28th March 2017First published on 28th March 2017AbstractFormamidine (FA) and cesium (Cs) cations were introduced into quasi-two-dimensional (2D) perovskites as B site cations. The unique crystalline growth of the resulting (n-C6H13NH3)2FAPb2I7, which promotes charge transport in photovoltaic solar cells, was confirmed, as was the stability of this material. The photovoltaic properties of (n-C6H13NH3)2FAPb2I7 were found to be superior to those of other homologous quasi-2D perovskite compounds.
Perovskite compounds have attracted significant attention since their initial application to photovoltaic devices by Miyasaka et al. in 2009.1 As research into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has progressed over the last several years, and new methods for fabricating perovskite layers and devices have been developed, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of PSCs have increased from 3.8% to more than 20%.2–9
Typically, three-dimensional (3D) perovskites with the general formula AMX3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−) have been studied as light harvesters in PSCs due to their outstanding properties, including high extinction coefficients, moderate band gaps, small exciton binding energies, and long exciton and charge diffusion lengths.10–12 However, PSCs continue to have serious challenges related to long-term robustness, especially in the presence of moisture, due to the inherent instability of 3D perovskite compounds.13 Therefore, improvements in the stability of PSCs are necessary prior to their practical deployment. To address this issue, some groups have recently reported the application of 2D perovskite compounds that have improved resistance to moisture.14–19
The structure of 2D perovskites with the general formula A2MX4 (A = CH3(CH2)nNH3+, C6H5(CH2)nNH3+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−) is presented in Fig. 1(a), in which inorganic layers and organic ammonium layers are alternately stacked. The inorganic layers comprise 2D sheets of [MX6]4− octahedra connected at four corners with halide ions in the plane. It is also possible to obtain analogous compounds to these 2D perovskites that can be considered as quasi-2D perovskites. These have the general formula A2Bm−1MmX3m+1 (A = CH3(CH2)nNH3+, C6H5(CH2)nNH3+; B = CH3NH3+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−).20 In these materials, multilayered CH3NH3MX3 perovskite sheets are sandwiched between organic ammonium layers, as shown in Fig. 1(b), and m is the number of inorganic monolayer sheets. An m value of ∞ is equivalent to a 3D perovskite, as pictured in Fig. 1(c).21 It is well known that the 2D perovskites have unique electrical and optical properties due to quantum confinement effects, as well as superior moisture stability as a result of the hydrophobic alkylamines in their structures.22–28 Therefore, 2D perovskites are a promising option for PSC light harvesters.

Karunadasa et al. and Kanatzidis et al. have both reported quasi-2D perovskite solar cells to utilize moisture stability of quasi-2D perovskites.14,15 (Due to poor photovoltaic properties, 2D perovskites were not investigated in detail.) It is notable that only CH3NH3+ (abbreviated as MA) has been used as the B site cation in such materials. As well, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of quasi-2D perovskite compounds in which the B site cation is CH(NH2)2+ (abbreviated as FA) or Cs+, although FAMX3 and CsMX3 are common compounds in this field. This means that the diversity of perovskite components has not been utilized. And properties of quasi-2D perovskites can meliorate by introduction of other cations to the B site. Herein, we report the first fabrication and application of quasi-2D perovskites in which the B site cations are FA or Cs. We also describe the effects of the B site cations on the properties of these compounds.
In this work, the quasi-2D perovskite compounds (n-C6H13NH3)2(MA)Pb2I7 and (n-C6H13NH3)2(FA)Pb2I7 (abbreviated as HAMAPbI and HAFAPbI, respectively) were fabricated by reacting stoichiometric amounts of n-C6H13NH3I and MAI or FAI with PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). In addition, (n-C6H13NH3)2CsPb2I7 (abbreviated as HACsPbI) was obtained by reacting n-C6H13NH3I and CsI with PbI2 in a mixture of DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 1:1, v/v). This mixed solvent was required due to the low solubility of CsI in DMF. For comparison purposes, the 2D perovskite compound (n-C6H13NH3)2PbI4 (abbreviated as HAPbI) was synthesized by reacting stoichiometric amounts of n-C6H13NH3I and PbI2 in DMF. Thin films of these microcrystalline quasi-2D and 2D perovskites were fabricated on pre-heated glass substrates at 70 °C by the spin-coating method at 3000 rpm. From the elemental analysis, compositions of HAFAPbI and HACsPbI were confirmed.

Fig. 2(a) shows the out-of-plane XRD patterns of HAPbI and HABPbI (B = MA, FA, Cs) spin-coated films. A series of (00l) diffractions (for HAPbI) and (0k0) diffractions (for HABPbI) corresponding to the interlayer d-spacing are clearly observed for all samples. An increase in the d-spacing value is also evident for each HABPbI specimen relative to HAPbI. The increments in the d-spacing from HAPbI to HABPbI are 5.9, 5.5 and 6.1 Å for HAMAPbI, HAFAPbI and HACsPbI, respectively. Because the diameter of an [PbI6]4− octahedron is approximately 6.3 Å,29–31 the increased spacing in HABPbI is attributed to the insertion of one additional BPbX3 perovskite layer per unit cell. This result indicates that quasi-2D perovskites can be fabricated not only with MA+ but also with FA+ or Cs+ as the B site cation. The d-spacing values were not dependent on the cation size. The d-spacing values of 2D and q-2D perovskites are typically dependent on the tilted angle and interdigitated degree of organic ammoniums, and the distortion of [PbX6]4− octhedra in inorganic sheets as reported in the previous report.25 From these multiple reasons, the d-spacing values of three q-2D materials were seemed to be independent of the cation size. Fig. 2(b) presents the in-plane XRD patterns of each film. These data demonstrate a perpendicular crystalline structure to the film surface. Each sample generated diffraction peaks at 14° and 28°, corresponding to diffractions from (111) and (222) planes, respectively. This result shows the formation of a 2D sheet of [PbI6]4− octahedra at the film surface, suggesting that the pronounced tendency of 2D perovskites for crystalline growth parallel to the substrate results in this formation.32 Because insulating organic cations in the A site prevent charge transport within the PSC, this parallel crystalline growth is not suitable for photovoltaic applications. In the case of HAFAPbI, a diffraction peak at 3.8°, corresponding to the (010) plane is observed. This peak indicates the formation of a quasi-2D perovskite layered structure at the film surface and crystalline growth partly perpendicular to the film surface. This perpendicular crystalline growth is well-suited to photovoltaic applications, because it allows charges to migrate within the perovskite layers without disturbance. This growth tendency was also exhibited by HAFAPbI spin-coated on a mesoporous TiO2 layer (Fig. S1(a) in the ESI†).

Fig. 3(a) shows the optical absorption spectra of HAPbI and HABPbI (B = MA, FA, Cs) spin-coated films at room temperature. Each film generated a strong absorption peak at 567 nm for MA, 566 nm for FA, and 561 nm for Cs, respectively. These peaks correspond to the lowest exciton states, which result from electronic potential and dielectric confinement in the inorganic layers. Compared with HAPbI, the absorption peak of each HABPbI specimen is red-shifted as the inorganic layer widths increase. This result is attributed to decreases in the quantum confinement effect due to the expansion of the exciton Bohr radius, resulting in a decrease in the exciton binding energy. The exciton peak position is determined by the bandedge of inorganic sheets and the exciton binding energy. Generally, the bandgap of bulk materials will increase (FA → MA → Cs) as the cation size decreases (FA → MA → Cs). Because Cs is the smallest cation among the three cations, the bandedge will shift to a shorter wavelength region. This may be the reason why the exciton absorption of HACsPbI was observed at shorter wavelength than HAMAPbI and HAFAPbI.

We also investigated the thermal stability of HABPbI in bulk, obtained by scraping the substance from the cast films. During thermal analysis, mass loss attributed to the decomposition of the organic components occurred at 244, 249 and 252 °C in the case of HAMAPbI, HAFAPbI and HACsPbI, respectively. HAFAPbI and HACsPbI were also found to be more thermally stable compared with HAMAPbI. This result is in good agreement with the higher thermal stabilities of FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 compared with MAPbI3.33,34
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of these quasi-2D perovskites, mesoscopic cells were fabricated on fluorine-doped transparent conductive tin oxide substrates under the ambient atmosphere. These devices were constructed with TiO2 as the electron transport layer and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxy phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene as the hole transport layer. Au was vapour-deposited on top of the device to serve as the cathode. The J–V curves and photovoltaic properties of the best-performing quasi-2D perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 3(b) and Table 1.

The photovoltaic properties of these cells were inferior to those of 3D perovskite solar cells basically due to the lack of light absorption in a narrow wavelength range (550–600 nm) (Fig. 3(a)) and, in addition, the influence of crystal orientation in which the crystalline growth of the quasi-2D perovskite parallel to the substrate is disadvantageous for photocurrent collection. The photovoltaic properties of HAMAPbI were similar to those provided in a previous report.15 As well, HACsPbI exhibited lower photovoltaic properties than HAMAPbI, because of the relatively low photovoltaic ability of CsPbI3.35 Compared with these two cells, HAFAPbI produced a higher short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), leading to a PCE over 1%. This increased JSC value is attributed to the increased charge transportation resulting from partly perpendicular crystalline growth of HAFAPbI relative to the substrate.
The stabilities of these films were assessed by acquiring XRD patterns of as-prepared HAFAPbI and MAPbI3 films and comparing these to the XRD patterns of films stored under ambient conditions for one week (Fig. S2, ESI†). While there were no obvious changes in the diffraction peaks of HAFAPbI, the MAPbI3 peaks were less intense after storage, suggesting decomposition of MAPbI3 and higher stability of HAFAPbI. This is because q-2D compounds were stabilized by van der Waals interaction between the hydrophobic long alkyl chains.
In an attempt to improve the photovoltaic properties, we tried to control the crystalline orientation of HAFAPbI by varying the rotational speed during spin-coating as well as the pre-heating temperature. Perpendicular crystalline growth during these trials was evaluated by calculating the ratio of the two peaks at 3.8° and 14°, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Higher values of this peak ratio suggest a greater proportion of perpendicular crystalline growth. A dependence of the peak ratio on both the rotational speed and the pre-heating temperature was observed (Fig. S3, ESI†). As can be seen from the in-plane XRD patterns in Fig. 4(a), the peak intensity ratio of HAFAPbI prepared at 130 °C and 1000 rpm was greater than that of the same material prepared at 70 °C and 3000 rpm. This result demonstrates an increase in the perpendicular growth, although some portion of the crystalline growth remained parallel. The photovoltaic properties of HAFAPbI fabricated at 130 °C and 1000 rpm were also investigated, and the J–V curve of the highest performing cell is presented in Fig. 4(b). Due to the enhanced perpendicular growth, the PCE was increased to 1.26%, with a JSC of 2.98 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.733 V and a fill factor of 0.574. Hysteresis is often observed in PSCs due to the defect states or surface charging induced by ion migration. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the discrepancy between forward and reverse scans for the cells prepared at 70 °C and 3000 rpm was small, and the hysteresis behaviour was dependent on the preparation conditions.

In conclusion, quasi-2D perovskite compounds in which the B site cations consisted of MA, FA or Cs were newly fabricated. HAFAPbI with partly perpendicular crystalline growth relative to the substrate was found to show a level of charge transportation suitable for use in a PSC. HAFAPbI also exhibited better photovoltaic properties than the other candidate materials when applied to a mesoscopic PSC. Further improvements of photovoltaic properties are expected by material or device architectural design.
