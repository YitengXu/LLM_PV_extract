    , Accepted 13th November 2006First published on 1st December 2006AbstractFour new azulene-based dye molecules, 3-(azulen-1-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (Azu-1), 3-(7-isopropyl-1,4-dimethylazulen-3-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (Guai-1), 5-(azulen-1-yl)-2-cyanopenta-2,4-dienoic acid (Azu-2), and 5-(7-isopropyl-1,4-dimethylazulen-3-yl)-2-cyanopenta-2,4-dienoic acid (Guai-2), were synthesized and their photoelectrochemical properties were studied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). All of them exhibit, in the visible region, a strong absorption band coming from the S0–S2 transition and a very weak band coming from the S0–S1 transition, and the transition assignments are supported by theoretical calculations using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6–31G* level. In sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes, reducing their adsorption amount on the TiO2 surface (by co-adsorption with deoxycholic acid) mitigates dye aggregation and improves their photoelectric conversion efficiency greatly. Also, extending the conjugated side chain (Azu-2vs.Azu-1 or Guai-2vs.Guai-1) not only shifts their photoelectric response to longer wavelengths and therefore enhances the short-circuit photocurrent, but also increases the open-circuit photovoltage significantly. Moreover, it was found that the electron injection efficiencies varied remarkably with excitation wavelength, suggesting direct electron injection from the S2 state of these dye molecules.
1 Introduction
As a novel renewable and clean solar-to-electricity conversion system, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on mesoporous TiO2 electrodes have attracted extensive interest following their discovery in 1991.1 While ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, such as cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (N3) and tri(thiocyanato)(4,4′,4″-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine)ruthenium(II) (Black dye),2–6 still represent the most efficient sensitizers so far, metal-free organic chromophores are increasingly applied in DSSCs by virtue of their high molar extinction coefficient, easy preparation, low cost, as well as their rich structures. The rich structures lead to diverse photophysical, photochemical, and electrochemical properties, which stimulate the continuous exploration of new types of organic dye molecules for DSSC application. Over the past decades, many kinds of organic dyes, including cyanines,7,8 hemicyanines,9 triphenylmethanes,10,11 perylenes,12,13 coumarins,14–16 porphyrins,17–20 squaraines,21,22 and indoline dyes,23,24 have been utilized in DSSCs, and some of them achieved respectable photoelectric conversion efficiencies.16,24
Azulene is well known as a non-alternant, non-benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbon. Compared with naphthalene, its isomeric alternant aromatic molecule, azulene shows a characteristic blue color, and its color can be varied remarkably by simple substitution, depending on the substituent nature (e.g. alkylated, fluorinated or formylated) and substitution position.25,26 Once it loses an electron, azulene will become a resonance-stabilized azulenylium carbocation, a 6π-electron aromatic tropylium carbocation analog (Scheme 1).27,28 It is estimated that the azulenylium carbocation is about 10 kcal mol−1 more stable than azulene itself, accounting for the electron-donating feature of azulene.29,30 The unique electron-donating property of azulene has been fully utilized to construct highly efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) materials,31–33 conducting polymers,34–37 charge-transfer complexes,38,39 molecular switches,40 and red-shifted bacteriorhodopsin pigments.41–43 Recently, it was reported that 1-carboxyazulene can inject an electron in its excited state into the conduction band of TiO2 within the fs time scale, implying its great potential to sensitize TiO2 nanocrystalline electrodes.44 However, the light-harvesting efficiency of 1-carboxyazulene is poor, as the result of its weak absorptivity for the S0–S1 transition and high energy for the S0–S2 transition (below 400 nm). This shortcoming may be overcome by insertion of methine units between the azulene chromophore and the anchoring carboxyl group. It was found that the position of the S2 band is highly sensitive to the conjugated side chain appended on C-1 of azulene, and undergoes a bathochromic shift with increasing conjugation length.41,45 Moreover, the longer conjugated side chain will move the azulenylium carbocation far away from the TiO2 surface, and therefore may restrict the recombination of the injected electron with the azulenylium carbocation. In this regard, four new azulene derivatives, Azu-1, Azu-2, Guai-1, and Guai-2 (Scheme 2), were designed and synthesized for DSSC application, and their sensitizing abilities were discussed based on their structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the photoelectrochemical behavior of azulene-based sensitizers in DSSCs.

2.1 General measurements, materials, and dye synthesis

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian GEMINI 300 or on a Bruker AM400 spectrometer. Mass spectra were taken on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 spectrometer and a GCT-MS Micromass UK spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were run on a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Azulene, guaiazulene, trimethyl orthoformate, boron trifluoride–diethyl etherate, cyanoacetic acid, piperidine, TiCl4, LiI, and I2 from Aldrich, tri-n-butylphosphine from TCI, 2-bromomethyl-1,3-dioxolane and deoxycholic acid (DCA) from Acrose, TiO2 paste (Nanoxide-T) and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) from Solaronix, Switzerland, were used as received. All solvents used were analytical grade and purified following general procedures.46
Syntheses of 3-(azulen-1-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (Azu-1) and 3-(7-isopropyl-1,4-dimethylazulen-3-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (Guai-1) were performed as follows. The formylation of azulene (1a) and guaiazulene (1b) with trimethyl orthoformate in the presence of boron trifluoride–diethyl etherate47 gave 1-formylazulene (2a) and 1-formylguaiazulene (2b), respectively. Then, the condensation of the corresponding aldehyde with cyanoacetic acid in acetonitrile in the presence of a catalytic amount of piperidine, followed by recrystallization of the formed precipitate from ethanol, gave pure Azu-1 and Guai-1 in yields of 73% and 69%, respectively (Scheme 3).

The Wittig reaction of 1-formyl-azulene (2a) or 1-formyl-guaiazulene (2b) with ((1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)methyl)-tri(n-butyl)phosphonium bromide following the reported method48 gave 3-(azulen-1-yl)acrylaldehyde (3a) or 3-(7-isopropyl-1,4-dimethylazulen-3-yl)acrylaldehyde (3b), from which Azu-2 and Guai-2 were prepared by condensation with cyanoacetic acid (Scheme 3) in yields of 68% and 63%, respectively.

2.2 Preparation of the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes
The TiO2 paste was coated on a conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (transmission >85%, sheet resistivity of 20 Ω square−1) by the doctor-blade method with Scotch tape as the spacer. The thickness of the TiO2 film was controlled by the number of Scotch tape layers. After air drying at room temperature for 30 min, the film was heated to 450 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1 and maintained at 450 °C for 30 min. Then the sintered TiO2 film was treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, followed by heating at 450 °C for another 30 min.4 The electrode was then immersed in a solution of 0.5 mM dye in DMSO (with or without 1 mM DCA) while it was still hot (about 80 °C) and soaked for at least 12 h at room temperature. After that, the electrode was rinsed thoroughly with ethanol and dried under a dry air stream. The thus-obtained TiO2 film had a thickness of 12 µm, determined by a Dektak 3 Profilometer. The amount of the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode was estimated spectroscopically after the dye was desorbed in a 1.0 mM solution of NaOH in methanol–H2O (50 : 50 volume ratio).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on a Potentiostat/Galvanostat model 283A (EG&G Princeton Applied Research) to determine the oxidation potentials of the dyes in DMF solutions. The measurement details are as follows: Pt working and counter electrodes, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate ((C4H9)4NClO4) as supporting electrolyte, scan rate of 100 mV s−1, and temperature of 20 °C.
2.4 Photovoltaic measurements
The sandwich-type solar cell consisted of a dye-sensitized TiO2 film as working electrode, a Pt-coated FTO conducting glass as counter electrode and a redox electrolyte solution which was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.6 M DMPImI in methoxyacetonitrile. The dye-sensitized TiO2 film was illuminated through the conducting glass support and the effective irradiated area was 0.2 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained from a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination by AM 1.5 Global simulated light (75 mW cm−2) from an Oriel 91192 Solar Simulator.
In the measurements of the action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs), the solar cell was irradiated by monochromatic light in the range of 400–800 nm at 10 nm intervals. The monochromatic light was obtained from a 500 W Xe lamp in combination with a SpectraPro-150 monochromator (Acton Research Co.). The generated short-circuit photocurrents were recorded on a model 283 A Potentiostat/Galvanostst. The incident monochromatic light intensity was measured with a S370 single channel optometer equipped with a Model 262 flat response sensor head (Graseby Optronics).
2.5 Molecular orbital calculation
All calculations were made on the Gaussian 03 program package49 by using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). B3LYP along with the 6-31G(d) basis set was used. Before optimizing ground-state geometries by B3LYP/6–31G*, the molecular structures were initially optimized in semiempirical PM3 calculations as recommended in the Gaussian 03 program package. All the geometries and electronic properties were calculated by assuming the target molecules to be isolated molecules in the gas phase.

The absorption spectra of the four dye molecules in DMSO exhibit similar profiles, i.e. a strong absorption band within 375–550 nm and a very weak absorption tail extending beyond 650 nm. The weak absorption band can be attributed to the S0–S1 transition of these azulene-based dye molecules, while the strong absorption band can be ascribed to the S0–S2 transition. Such assignments are supported by the theoretical calculations (see below). Extension of the conjugated side chain (Azu-2vs.Azu-1 or Guai-2vs.Guai-1) results in a significant red shift of the absorption maxima, making them more efficient in harvesting blue and green light. The alkyl substitutions on the azulene ring (Guai-1vs.Azu-1 or Guai-2vs.Azu-2) also make a noticeable contribution to the spectrum red shift, a typical characteristic of azulene chromophores that the absorption is very sensitive to ring substitution. Besides red shifting the absorption spectrum, the alkyl groups present in Guai-1 and Guai-2 may play an important role in restricting the dye aggregation. As shown in Fig. 2, Azu-1 undergoes a remarkable red shift of the absorption maximum, broadening of the absorption band, as well as variation of the absorption line shape with increasing concentration, implying strong intermolecular interactions. In sharp contrast, the concentration effect on the absorption spectrum of Guai-1is greatly diminished. Similar behavior was also found for Azu-2 and Guai-2. Dye aggregation often opens up new deactivation pathways for the excited state, which may therefore interfere with the desired process, such as electron injection at the dye/semiconductor interface. The better sensitizing ability of guaiazulene-based dye molecules in DSSCs may partly originate from their restricted aggregation (see below).
 Fig. 2  Normalized absorption spectra of DMSO solutions of Azu-1 (a) and Guai-1 (b) at varied concentrations: a, 1.5 × 10−6; b, 2.5 × 10−6; c, 5.0 × 10−6; d, 1.0 × 10−5; e, 2.0 × 10−5 M. 
Upon adsorption onto the TiO2 nanocrystalline electrodes, the absorption spectra of the four dye molecules were all extended greatly to longer wavelengths (Fig. 1b), probably resulting from the interactions between dye molecules and TiO2 and/or among the dye molecules. Such spectrum broadening allows the dye molecules to harvest visible light more efficiently, particular for Azu-2 and Guai-2 based TiO2 electrodes.
The dye adsorption amount decreased in the order Azu-1 > Azu-2 > Guai-1 > Guai-2, no matter whether the dye molecules were adsorbed alone or adsorbed simultaneously with DCA (deoxycholic acid). It seems that there is a good correlation between the dye adsorption amount and dye molecular size, i.e. the bigger the dye molecules, the smaller the adsorption amount. Furthermore, the alkyl groups substituted on the azulene ring reduce the adsorption amount more effectively, and consequently weaken the dye aggregation more efficiently, which may account for the higher photoelectric conversion efficiencies of Guai-1 and Guai-2 with respect to Azu-1 and Azu-2, respectively (see Table 1).
One special property of azulene is its fluorescence emission from the S2 rather than the S1 state. This violation of Kasha's Rule50 results from the unusually large S1–S2 energy gap and the presence of a chemical channel for rapid relaxation of the S1 state.51 However, no fluorescence emission was observed for Azu-1, Azu-2, Guai-1, and Guai-2. The absence of fluorescence may be the result of the red shift of the S2 band, which reduces the S1–S2 gap and accordingly enhances internal conversion from S2 to the nonemissive S1 state.
3.2 Electrochemical properties
The oxidation potentials of the four dye molecules were measured with cyclic voltammetry (Table 1). It is clear that both alkylation on the azulene ring and the extension of the conjugated side chain shift the oxidation potential cathodically. The excited state oxidation potential (Eox*) of a dye molecule can be estimated by subtracting the 0–0 transition energies (E0-0) from the ground state oxidation potential (Eox). The low extinction coefficient for the S1 band limits the accurate estimation of E0-0, so a E0-0 of 1.9 eV (corresponding to a transition at 650 nm) was used for the four dyes to calculate the oxidation potentials of their S1 states (Table 1). Obviously, all the S1 state potentials are far more negative than the band edge energy of the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode (−0.8 V vs. SCE), suggesting that the electron injection from the S1 state to the TiO2 conduction band is energetically permitted. Due to the higher E0-0 for the S2 state, a larger driving force and higher efficiency may be envisioned for electron injection from the S2 state (see the discussion below).
3.3 Quantum-chemical calculation
To gain insight into the electronic structures of these new azulene-based dyes at the molecular level, we performed TD-DFT (time-dependent density functional theory) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level with Gaussian 03, revision B.03.49 The optimized geometries and atom labeling are shown in ESI Fig. 1S,† while the main dihedral angles, by which the optimized geometries of the ground state can be defined, are tabulated in Table 1S.† Largely, the four dye molecules adopt almost planar conformations in their energy minima, though the methyl group at C-4 of the azulene ring (for Guai-1) makes the vinyl group have some torsion vs. the azulene plane.

Fig. 3 shows the electron distribution of the HOMOs and LUMOs for these dye molecules. In the cases of Azu-1, Azu-2 or Guai-1, the HOMO electron density is mainly located in the five-membered ring of azulene and the conjugated side chain. The LUMO electron density, however, is mainly confined in the seven-membered ring of azulene. This phenomenon is very similar to the calculated result for azulene itself, in which there is a substantial charge transfer from the five-membered ring to the seven-membered ring upon HOMO–LUMO transition.26 For Guai-2, the electron density within the five-membered ring moves both to the conjugated side chain and the seven-membered ring upon HOMO–LUMO transition.

Table 2 presents the calculated absorption maxima in the visible region, their oscillator strengths, and their compositions for the four dye molecules. Similar to the experimental data (Fig. 1 and Table 1), the calculation also produces a strong absorbing band at higher energy and a very weak band at lower energy. Moreover, the calculated absorption maxima for the second excited states are in good agreement with the measured ones, supporting the band assignments in Fig. 1(a).

3.4 Photovoltaic performance
A series of DSSCs were prepared and compared to get insight into the relations between the sensitizing behavior of the four dye molecules and their structures. Fig. 4 shows the incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of the wavelength of the incident light, which is defined as the number of electrons generated by light in the external circuit divided by the number of incident photons and is calculated using the following equation,2 where Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density, λ is the excitation wavelength, and Pin is the incident light intensity.  
 Fig. 4  Photocurrent action spectra of the DSSCs based on Azu-1, Azu-2, Guai-1, and Guai-2. 
The four dye molecules exhibit photoelectric activities over their whole absorption bands (Fig. 1(b)), indicative of the participation of the S1 state (and/or even the dye aggregate) in the electron injection process. It is well known that the S1 state of azulene and its derivatives has an ultrafast deactivation pathway,52 which in turn indicates that the electron injection rates for the four dyes should be fast enough to compete effectively with their intrinsic decay from the S1 state.
Another point worthy of concern is that whether the electron injection can directly occurs in the S2 state of these dye molecules, though no fluorescence from S2 was observed for them. With this in mind, we examined the electron injection efficiencies (Φin) of the dye molecules at different wavelengths. The IPCE at a wavelength is the production of three efficiencies, i.e. IPCE = LHE(λ) ×
					Φin
					×
					Φc, in which LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency at a wavelength of λ and Φc is the collection efficiency of the injected electron at the back contact of the photoanode. Φc is associated with (1) the electron transport within the TiO2 network, (2) the recombination of the injected electrons with the electrolyte (I3−), and (3) the recombination of the injected electrons with the oxidized dyes, and therefore should be a term independent of the excitation wavelength. Thus, IPCE/LHE(λ) can be used to compare Φin at different wavelengths, while LHE(λ) can be calculated based on the absorption spectrum of the dye-sensitized electrode (Fig. 1(b)). Taking Guai-2 as an example, its IPCE/LHE(λ) at 400 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm, 550 nm, and 600 nm are respectively 0.57, 0.51, 0.34, 0.27, and 0.25. Such wavelength dependence suggests that electron injection might take place (at least partly) in the S2 state and with a higher efficiency than in the S1 state (and/or dye aggregate). The decrease of IPCE/LHE(λ) with increasing wavelength was also found in Azu-1, Azu-2 and Guai-1 sensitized solar cells. The higher electron injection efficiency from the S2 state may result from the larger driving force and/or longer S2 lifetime. It will be useful to take measurements on the lifetimes of the S1 and S2 states, the electron injection rate constants, as well as the recombination rates for these azulene-based dye molecules, though the features of our time-resolved spectrum techniques (absorption and emission at ns or longer time regimes) limit us presently.
Once the four dye molecules are compared to each other (Fig. 4), it immediately appears that Azu-2 and Guai-2 possess better sensitizing capabilities than Azu-1 and Guai-1, respectively, mainly due to their red shifted absorption (Fig. 1).

Fig. 5 presents the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves of the corresponding solar cells under AM1.5G irradiation (75 mW cm−2), from which the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and the overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) can be obtained (Table 3). The relations between these photovoltaic parameters are as follows, where Pin is the intensity of the incident light and Pmax the power output maximum of the solar cells.

In Table 3, the photovoltaic parameters both with and without the co-adsorption of DCA are included for comparison. DCA was often utilized, by co-adsorption with dye stuff, to improve the photovoltaic properties.53 The working mechanisms of DCA have been well accepted to be (1) blocking the access of I3− to the TiO2 surface where not occupied by dye molecules and therefore restricting recombination of the injected electrons, and (2) reducing the dye adsorption amount and therefore refraining dye aggregation.54 In the presence of DCA, the η was increased by 36% (Azu-1), 26% (Azu-2), 11% (Guai-1), and 9.4% (Guai-2), respectively. The improved photoelectric conversion efficiencies mainly stem from the enhanced photocurrent as evidenced by the fact that Voc was increased by only 3.9% (Azu-1), 1.9% (Azu-2), 1.1% (Guai-1), and 1.3% (Guai-2), FF was increased by only 1.9% (Azu-1), 1.2% (Azu-2), 1.2% (Guai-1), and 1.2% (Guai-2); in contrast, Jsc was increased by 28% (Azu-1), 23% (Azu-2), 10% (Guai-1), and 6.3% (Guai-2). Interestingly, the enhanced Jsc was obtained in the case that less dye molecules were bound on the electrode (Table 1), implying the dye aggregation occurred at higher loading impaired the electron injection process. This is further proved by the fact that DCA promoted the photovoltaic properties of Azu-1 (vs.Guai-1) and Azu-2 (vs.Guai-2) more efficiently, because Azu-1 and Azu-2 are more prone to aggregate than Guai-1 and Guai-2 as mentioned above (Fig. 2).
The length of the conjugated side chain is of importance as well in the photovoltaic performances of these dye molecules (Fig. 5). While the enhanced Jsc for Azu-2 or Guai-2 can be mainly attributed to the red shifted absorption (Fig. 1) and therefore the improved IPCE beyond 550 nm (Fig. 4), the reason underlying the increased Voc by the extension of conjugated side chain is not so clear. In DSSCs, Voc can be expressed as follows:55  where n is the concentration of electrons in TiO2, and the summation is for all electron transfer rate constants, ki, to acceptors, [A]i. Both I3− and oxidized dye can serve as acceptors. The diminished dark currents (Fig. 6) indicate that the recombination between the electrons in TiO2 and I3− was retarded to some extent in the cases of Azu-2 and Guai-2. The side chain extension might vary the arrangement and orientation manner of the dye molecules, and thus influence the access of I3− onto the TiO2 surface. The increased Voc might also come from the restricted recombination of the injected electrons with the oxidized dye molecules, since the extended side chain may make the formed azulenylium carbocation further away from the TiO2 surface. If this assumption is true, improved photovoltaic performance will be expected in the analog with longer conjugated side chain.

4 Conclusions
The four new azulene-based dye molecules were, for the first time, utilized to sensitize nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes. The photovoltaic performances are found to be dependent strongly on their chemical structures and on their mutual interactions on the TiO2 surface. Reducing their adsorption amount on TiO2 electrodes (by co-adsorption with deoxycholic acid) mitigates dye aggregation and improves their photoelectric conversion efficiency greatly. Extending the conjugated side chain shows two-fold advantages: (1) increasing the short-circuit photocurrent as the result of the red shifted absorption, and (2) increasing the open-circuit photovoltage under a mechanism ambiguous as yet but deserving further investigation. While the study of the important kinetic processes (such as electron injection and recombination, lifetimes of the first and second excited states) will aid the better understanding of the photoelectrochemical properties of the four dye molecules, the chemical modifications (such as the extension of the conjugated side chain and introduction of more bulky groups at proper positions) may lead to more efficient azulene-based dyes for DSSC application.
