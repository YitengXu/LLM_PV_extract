    , Accepted 17th June 2019First published on 18th June 2019AbstractA highly proton-/vanadium-selective perfluorosulfonic acid (Nafion) membrane modified by phosphotungstic acid (PWA)-anchored nano Kevlar fibers (NKFs) and nano silica particles (NSP) for a vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) was fabricated through solution casting. The nanohybrid composed of NKFs, NSP and PWA exhibited excellent compatibility with the polymer matrix, and effectively suppressed the vanadium ion crossover. In addition, the anchoring of PWA was of great significance for maintaining the ion exchange capacity and constructing continuous proton transport channels. The optimal Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA) membrane presented a high proton conductivity (0.079 S cm−1) and a low vanadium permeability (6.27 × 10−7 cm2 min−1), resulting in an ion selectivity of 1.26 × 105 S min cm−3, which is much higher than that of recast Nafion (0.34 × 105 S min cm−3). Moreover, the VRB assembled with the modified membrane showed a lower self-discharge rate, higher battery efficiency and superior capacity retention than that with the recast Nafion over a range of current densities from 40 mA cm−2 to 100 mA cm−2.
Introduction
With more urgency than ever before, green energy like solar and wind must be further developed to address the problem of environmental deterioration.1–3 However, the unreliability of these energy sources from nature has introduced great challenges to actual production processes.4 Linking the power grid with an energy storage equipment is considered an effective approach.5,6 It has been predicted that energy conversion techniques will be increasingly important in future energy utilization. Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) have attracted extensive attention among these techniques due to the combination of long life, low-cost and flexible design.7–9 As the key component of the VRB system, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) serve to isolate the anode and cathode electrolytes, allowing protons to pass through while preventing vanadium ions from crossing.10,11 The membrane for VRBs should be characterized by a sufficient proton conduction rate, low vanadium ion diffusion rate and good chemical stability.12,13 Nafion, a perfluorosulfonic acid polymer, has been widely used in VRBs for its outstanding proton conductivity and chemical tolerance.14,15 Nevertheless, the PEMs based on Nafion tend to exhibit excessively severe vanadium ion permeability, which leads to a reduction in battery capacity and a decrease in battery efficiency.16–18
To solve these problems, certain modifications have been developed to minimize vanadium ion crossover and increase the ion selectivity of Nafion.19–21 A general way to restrict vanadium diffusion is by incorporating inorganic fillers into the polymer matrix to adjust the interaction existing in the interface region. Inorganic particles, such as SiO2,19,22 ZrO2,23 and TiO2,24,25 and fillers based on graphene,26 are frequently introduced into various matrices to suppress the vanadium ion permeation. However, the proton transport capacity of the hybrid membrane is significantly reduced once oxide fillers are merged into Nafion due to the decrease in the density of sulfonated groups. Thus, a balance between the high conductivity and low vanadium permeability to achieve superior proton/vanadium selectivity must be achieved.24 Therefore, there should be impactful studies to incorporate acid conductors with sufficient proton transport capability into the polymer matrix while introducing inorganic fillers to inhibit vanadium ion crossover.27–29
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a series of metal–oxygen cluster compounds that have attracted extensive attention attributed to their superior acidity and thermodynamic stability.26 The protons present in POMs can combine with water to form hydrogen bonds and exist in the form of H3O+ or H5O2+, making it a promising material that can be used to construct highly conductive proton membranes. A Nafion/POM composite membrane can improve proton conductive rates, but the leakage of POMs from the membrane owing to its enormous water solubility is still an urgent problem to be addressed.30,31 Therefore, anchoring POMs on the oxide support not only prevents its leakage, but also compensates for the reduced proton conductivity. In fact, many effective studies have combined the excellent properties of PWA and inorganic components to fabricate composite PEMs, and achieved remarkable results in the fields of fuel cells and VRBs.26,32,33 Unfortunately, owing to the great difference in solubility parameters between organic polymer matrices and inorganic materials, the incorporation of inorganic fillers into the polymer matrix often causes fillers to agglomerate, leading to phase separation.34,35 Thus, only a small amount of fillers can be introduced to the matrix to suppress vanadium crossing, making it difficult to maximize the effect of fillers. In view of this, one prospective approach to improve the compatibility with polymers is the organic modification of inorganic fillers through rational design.
In this study, nano Kevlar fibers (NKFs) were utilized to form an in situ entangled fibers/nano silica particle (NSP) structure during the hydrolysis process of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Hereafter, phosphotungstic acid (PWA, which possesses the strongest acidity in the POM) was anchored on this entangled structure via hydrogen bonding, and the nanohybrid defined as NKFs@NSP/PWA was subsequently merged into the Nafion ionomer to form a casting solution. The nanohybrid exhibited excellent compatibility with the Nafion matrix and there was no obvious agglomeration until the filler content reached 15 wt%. Thus, the polar structure of Nafion was effectively blocked, which resulted in the significantly reduced vanadium ion permeability. Benefiting from the supplement of PWA, the consecutive proton transport channels were maintained and protons could be easily conducted inside the membrane, which led to an overall promotion in ion selectivity. Moreover, the VRB constructed with the modified membrane exhibited remarkably improved battery performance than that of the recast Nafion.
Experimental
Materials
PWA and TEOS were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd Nafion solution was prepared following a method reported the literature.36 NKFs were supplied by DuPont, America. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Vanadium electrolytes were provided by Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was purified by a laboratory water purifier. All other materials were utilized as received without further purification.
Synthesis of NKFs@NSP and the anchoring of PWA
The NKFs@NSP entanglement was synthesized by an in situ hydrolysis method. The details can be described as follows. TEOS (1.9 mL) and ethanol (30 mL) were stirred for 30 minutes to mix well. Then, ethanol (30 mL), a concentrated ammonia solution (28 wt%, 3.75 mL) and ultrapure water (9 mL) were injected into a three-neck flask in turn, then placed in a 25 °C water bath. After the mixture mentioned above was stirred for 15 minutes, the ultrasonically dispersed NKFs solution (0.1 wt%, 40 mL, DMSO used as the solvent) was slowly dropped into it. After 30 minutes, the mixture of TEOS and ethanol was dripped into the flask through a peristaltic pump at a constant rate. The mixture was continuously reacted for 12 h, and the resultant denoted as NKFs@NSP was centrifugally separated, then fully washed to remove unreacted reactant. The synthetic NKFs@NSP was immersed in a 20 wt% aqueous solution of PWA for 7 days to achieve the adequate anchoring of PWA. The final resultant was centrifugally separated and fully washed to clear away unbound PWA to obtain NKFs@NSP/PWA. The loading level of PWA was acquired from the results of EDS (shown in Fig. S7 and Table S2, ESI†). Moreover, pristine NSP was prepared according to a modified Stöber's method.37 In the process, the other steps were exactly the same as above with the exception that no NKF solution was added.
Fabrication of Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA) membrane
Perfluorosulfonic acid resin was obtained by evaporating a Nafion solution, followed by being dried thoroughly in the oven. The dry resin was dispersed in DMF and stirred at 65 °C for 4 h to form a uniform solution. Then, the NKFs@NSP/PWA was added to the DMF solution in a certain ratio. Subsequently, the mixture was treated by ultrasound for 0.5 h, then magnetically stirred for 12 h. After the solution was dispersed uniformly, it was poured into a glass dish and heated at 60 °C overnight to acquire a Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-x (where x means 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% of NKFs@NSP/PWA in the membrane) modified membrane. To compare, NKFs@NSP, NSP and PWA were incorporated into the Nafion ionomer individually utilizing the similar manner to acquire Nafion-(NKFs@NSP)-x, Nafion-(NSP)-x, or Nafion-(PWA)-x (where x means 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% of NKFs@NSP, NSP or PWA in the membrane). The thickness of each membrane was approximately 120 ± 10 μm.
Results and discussion
Morphological analysis
The hydrophilic polar clusters of Nafion facilitated proton transport and accelerated vanadium ion permeation, which led to the cross-contamination of positive and negative electrolytes. In numerous methods of filling polar clusters, the incorporation of silica is considered to be a simple and effective route. Although the oxygen functional groups on silica could interact with the sulfonic acid groups from Nafion and partially block the accessibility of the polar structure in Nafion, the phenomenon of agglomeration tends to occur when excess silica is doped into the matrix due to the large difference in solubility parameters. In this study, NSP was modified by organic polymer fibers to solve this problem. The modification of NSP and the fabrication of the composite membrane are shown in Fig. 1a.

(b) Schematic depiction of the increased tortuosity of transport channels for vanadium ions by incorporating (NKFs@NSP/PWA) into the Nafion matrix, recast Nafion is used as a comparison. 
The NSP modified by NKFs exhibits excellent compatibility with the matrix (Fig. 2f), which makes a difference with the particle agglomeration phenomenon in the cross-section of Nafion-(NSP), as shown in Fig. 2e. In addition, due to the influence of NKFs, the NSP in the entangled structure (Fig. 2b) exhibits a smaller particle size than that of pristine NSP (Fig. 2a), which also contributes to its better dispersion in the matrix. When PWA is anchored to the entangled structure (the appearance of a W signal in the elemental mapping presented in Fig. 2d indicates that PWA is successfully immobilized on the nanohybrid), it seems that NKFs are more closely bound to the NSP (Fig. 2c). This may be attributed to the fact that both amide groups on NKFs and silicon hydroxyl groups on NSP can act as anchoring sites for PWA,38,39 so the addition of PWA makes them more compact. Simultaneously, aided by the good dispersion of fillers, the proton conduction sites are uniformly dispersed in the Nafion matrix, which contributes to the construction of continuous proton transport channels. It can also be inferred from the decrease in transparency on the membrane surface (as presented in Fig. S8, ESI†) that the polar ionic clusters of Nafion have been blocked, and the resulting tortuous path effect (as shown in Fig. 1b) can effectively inhibit the crossover of vanadium ions.

Spectrum and physicochemical properties analysis
FT-IR was performed to clarify the characteristic functional group vibrations of the materials (Fig. 3a and b). In the spectrum of NSP, the peaks at 1084 cm−1 and 795 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations and bending vibrations of Si–O–Si, respectively.40 Once NSP was modified by NKFs, the CO stretching vibrations at 1650 cm−1, N–H deformation and C–N stretching coupled modes at 1545 cm−1, CC stretching vibrations at 1516 cm−1 and Ph–N vibrations at 1319 cm−1 belonging to NKFs (the structure is presented in Fig. S3, ESI†) appear,41 which indicates that NKFs are successfully incorporated into the entanglement structure. In terms of NKFs@NSP/PWA, PWA (the structure is presented in Fig. S2, ESI†) characteristic peaks all appear in the spectra and some peaks are shifted. Namely, the value of P–Oa changes from 1081 to 1076 cm−1, W–Od changes from 987 to 975 cm−1 and W–Ob–W changes from 890 to 886 cm−1, which demonstrates that a hydrogen bonding interaction exists between the nanohybrid and PWA.31 In terms of recast Nafion (the structure is presented in Fig. S4, ESI†), the peaks at 1211 and 1150 cm−1 are referred to the antisymmetric vibrations of C–F, the peaks at 1058 cm−1 are referred to the stretching vibration of –SO3H, and the peaks at 981 and 973 cm−1 are referred to the symmetric vibrations of C–O–C.13 For Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA), except for the appearance of the Nafion characteristic peaks, the characteristic bands of PWA can also be detected, which shows that the nanohybrid has been successfully introduced into the polymer.

(d) Stress–strain, (e) TGA and (f) DTG curves of Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA) membranes, recast Nafion is used as a control. 
The major problem with the PWA-based membrane is the leakage of PWA due to its large water solubility. Herein, PWA was anchored on NKFs@NSP and the leachate after 200 h of water immersion was placed in a quartz cuvette to evaluate the leakage level of PWA. According to Fig. 3c, the intensities are 0.173, 0.308, 0.533 and 0.821 for Nafion-(PWA), which indicates that 30.5, 27.1, 31.4 and 34.4 wt% of PWA leaked in water (PWA concentration is obtained from the absorption intensity and the standard curve is displayed in Fig. S5, ESI†). The values are just 0.036, 0.069, 0.092 and 0.129 for Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA), which means that the leakage content is only 6.2, 6.1, 5.4 and 5.7 wt%, respectively. The results confirm the excellent anchoring of the nanohybrid for PWA, which contributes to maintaining the membrane performance stability.
Adequate water uptake (WU) facilitates the PEM to speed up proton conduction.42 In comparison with recast Nafion, the WU of the modified membrane generally shows an upward trend (as presented in Fig. S9a, ESI†), yet it increases more and more slowly as the filler content increases. The increased WU is mainly influenced by the hygroscopicity of NSP enhancing the water adsorption and retention capability, which helps to increase the bound water content. Moreover, there exists a probable cross-linking effect attributed to the interaction between NSP and the matrix, and the cross-linking effect leads to a decrease in the polymer chain mobility and water absorbing sites.43,44 Accordingly, under the balance of the two effects, the growth rate of WU is gradually slowed down. Compared with the recast Nafion, the swelling ratio (SR) decreases as the filler content increases (as presented in Fig. S9b, ESI†), which can be ascribed to the interaction between the nanohybrid and sulfonated groups of Nafion. Simultaneously, the modified membranes show more robust stability in Fenton reagents (as presented in Fig. S9c, ESI†), which is advantageous for its use in oxidizing electrolytes.
Having a certain mechanical strength is essential for the material to achieve its function. According to the results of Fig. 3d, the ultimate stress of recast Nafion is 22.1 MPa, while they are 27.4, 33.8, 41.7 and 33.2 MPa for the modified membranes. This shows that the filler has a positive effect on the mechanical properties of the membrane, which can be ascribed to the cross-linking effect between the nanoparticles and the polymer.43 The thermal stability of the membranes evaluated by TGA is shown in Fig. 3e. The weightless behavior for both recast Nafion and Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA) is nearly identical, which indicates that the thermodynamic characteristics of Nafion did not change even after incorporating the nanohybrid into the matrix. To detect the weight loss in more detail, differential thermal gravity (DTG) was performed to analyze the process. As presented in Fig. 3f, two weightlessness domains can be observed. The first region ranges from 340 °C to 380 °C, arising from the degradation of –SO3H groups, and the second region around 500 °C originates from the damage in the CF2–CF2 skeleton.45,46
The –SO3H group decomposition temperature of recast Nafion is 341 °C, while they are 336 °C, 354 °C, 368 °C and 343 °C for the modified membranes, respectively.
Ion exchange capacity (IEC) is one of the most important factors influencing the proton conductivity.47 Since NSP does not carry protogenic groups, incorporating it into the membrane causes a decrease in the density of sulfonated groups and leads to a drop in the IEC. As presented in Fig. 4a, the values of Nafion-(NKFs@NSP) are 0.923 meq g−1, 0.908 meq g−1, 0.883 meq g−1 and 0.852 meq g−1, reflecting an obvious inferiority to that of recast Nafion (0.939 meq g−1), while the values of Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA) are all maintained above 0.93 meq g−1, which can be attributed to the superacidity of PWA. The proton conduction rate, which is profoundly influenced by WU and IEC,48 directly affects the voltage efficiency of VRB. Compared with recast Nafion, the composite membranes based on NKFs@NSP/PWA have almost the same IEC and higher WU, which will be more conducive for completing the proton transfer process, thus achieving a higher proton conductivity. Typically, Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% has a value of 0.079 S cm−1, while it is 0.068 S cm−1 for recast Nafion. Particularly, Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-20 wt% exhibits a distinctively lower proton conduction rate arising from filler agglomeration. Consistent with the inference, owing to the significantly decreased IEC, Nafion-(NKFs@NSP) exhibits a remarkably reduced proton conductivity compared with Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA).

Vanadium ion permeability of the membrane deeply affects the efficiency and the capacity of the battery. In terms of recast Nafion, the ionic clusters tend to form dilated transfer channels, resulting in the rapid crossover of vanadium ions. According to Fig. 4b and c, the VO2+ concentration across recast Nafion increases very fast, resulting in a permeability of 20.18 × 10−7 cm2 min−1, which speeds up the self-discharge rate of the battery. As mentioned before, the incorporation of the nanohybrid could block the polar clusters of Nafion and act as barriers for vanadium ions by increasing the tortuosity of the transport channels. The decreased SR also contributed to suppressing the vanadium permeation. Thus, the growth rate of the VO2+ concentration for the composite membrane is slower and a series of low vanadium diffusion rates are obtained. Typically, Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% possesses a value of 6.27 × 10−7 cm2 min−1, which is much lower than that of recast Nafion. The modified membrane achieved higher selectivity due to its preferable proton conductivity and lower vanadium permeability. The ion-selective values of Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA) are 0.56, 0.93, 1.26 and 0.62 × 105 S min cm−3, respectively (as presented in Fig. 4d), which are superior to that of the recast Nafion (0.34 × 105 S min cm−3). The high proton/vanadium selectivity primarily arises from the increased transport tortuosity due to the incorporation of the NKFs@NSP/PWA nanohybrid. However, the proton transport behavior is insignificantly influenced owing to its distinctively smaller Stokes radius versus vanadium ions.49
VRB performance
The Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% membrane has the optimum proton/vanadium selectivity, which helps the VRB performance to be fully realized. The charge–discharge curves of the single cell with Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% at various current densities utilizing recast Nafion are shown in Fig. 5 for comparison. As the current density increases, the battery capacities show a downward trend arising from the greater degree of IR drop at higher current densities.20 In addition, the VRB constructed with Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% shows a lower charge voltage but a higher discharge voltage versus recast Nafion at the same current density. This is because a high proton conduction rate reduces the ohmic polarization and results in a lower charge voltage, while a lower vanadium diffusion rate reduces the number of vanadium ions across the membrane and leads to a relatively high discharge voltage.50 The detailed data on charge–discharge voltage and capacity are provided in Table S3 (ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Charge–discharge curves for the VRBs with recast Nafion and Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% membranes at various current densities. 
The VRB with Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% exhibits a higher charge capacity and discharge capacity than those of recast Nafion, and the coulombic efficiency (CE) is also much higher due to the inhibited vanadium permeability, as shown in Fig. 6 (particularly, 86.4% at 40 mA cm−2 and 91.5% at 100 mA cm−2 for the modified membrane, while 83.5% at 40 mA cm−2 and 89.8% at 100 mA cm−2 for the recast Nafion). In addition, the CEs increase for both cells with the increase in current densities that is attributed to the faster charge–discharge at higher current densities, which implies that the crossover of vanadium ions is suppressed.51 Benefiting from the preferable proton conductivity, the voltage efficiency (VE) of the Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% based VRB shows a higher value than that of the recast Nafion. Moreover, the VE decreases as the current density increases due to the increase in the ohmic resistance and over-potential at higher currents.52 The energy efficiency (EE) of the battery is the most important parameter because it is directly related to actual production. The EE of the single cell based on Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% is higher than that of recast Nafion at various current densities. The optimal EE is 81.2% for the modified membrane, while 77.4% for recast Nafion at a current density of 40 mA cm−2. The reason for this result is that EE is derived from the product of CE and VE, while both the CE and VE of Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% are higher than those of recast Nafion, thus achieving a superior EE.
 Fig. 6  CE, VE and EE for the VRBs with recast Nafion and the composite membrane at various current densities. 
The migration of vanadium ions across the separator leads to the self-discharge of the VRB and results in a decrease in the open circuit voltage (OCV).15 Thus, the OCV can be utilized to evaluate the level of self-discharge. All the tests start from a state of charge (SOC) value of 75%, and the change in the OCV values with time from the VRB assembled with recast Nafion and the modified membrane are displayed in Fig. 7a. The duration in which the VRB maintained above 0.8 V is 71 h for the VRB with Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% and 40 h for that with recast Nafion. The remarkable increase in the self-discharge retention time for the modified membrane indicates that the crossover of vanadium is greatly suppressed by employing Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt%.

To assist the uninterrupted operation of the battery, the cyclic efficiency and discharge capacity were recorded at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. As presented in Fig. 7b, the VRB efficiency for each cell is just fluctuating within a narrow range after 100 cycles, indicating that neither of these membranes is irreversibly damaged during the VRB operation. As displayed in Fig. 7c, the single cell based on recast Nafion shows a quick capacity decay at the beginning of the cycle, which is a frequently encountered problem. This serious issue could be ascribed to the unequal transfer of water molecules and vanadium ions, which may affect the durability of the battery arising from vanadium electrolyte precipitation.51 Yet the single cell with Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% performed more stably. Typically, the capacity retention of the VRB based on Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% is 83.18% after 100 cycles, while it is only 67.82% for that with recast Nafion. The significantly increased capacity retention indicates that the modified membrane has distinctive advantages in a long-term VRB operation as compared with recast Nafion.
Conclusions
In the present study, a Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA) composite membrane with remarkably improved proton/vanadium selectivity for VRBs was successfully fabricated by solution casting. The utilization of NKFs as a medium to incorporate inorganic filler into the polymer solved the problem of the poor compatibility between inorganic fillers and the Nafion matrix. The anchoring of PWA could compensate for the decrease in IEC and contributed to the construction of continuous proton transport channels. The incorporation of the NKFs@NSP/PWA nanohybrid effectively blocked the polar ionic clusters of Nafion and acted as a barrier for vanadium ions by increasing the tortuosity of ion transport channels. The optimal Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% membrane presented a higher proton conductivity (0.079 S cm−1), lower vanadium ion permeability (6.27 × 10−7 cm2 min−1) and a preferable ion selectivity (1.26 × 105 S min cm−3), as compared with recast Nafion (0.068 S cm−1, 20.18 × 10−7 cm2 min−1 and 0.34 × 105 S min cm−3, respectively). Moreover, the single cell based on Nafion-(NKFs@NSP/PWA)-15 wt% exhibited a lower self-discharge rate, higher battery efficiency and superior capacity retention as compared with those of recast Nafion, indicating that the modified membrane has great prospects for usage in VRB applications.
