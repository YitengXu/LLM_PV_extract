    , Accepted 12th March 2020First published on 12th March 2020AbstractDefects in a semiconductor dictate the carrier transport and recombination ability, which are critical factors that influence the power conversion efficiency in solar cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of tellurium is able to fine tune the atomic ratio of Se/Sb in Sb2Se3 thin films, both Se-rich and Sb-rich Sb2Se3 are obtained. Using fine-tuned device fabrication and deep level defect spectroscopy for characterization, we experimentally disclose that Se-rich Sb2Se3 favors the formation of SeSb and VSb defects, while Sb-rich films benefit the formation of SbSe and VSe defects. With an appropriate excess of Se in Sb2Se3, a net efficiency improvement of 2% is obtained when compared with pristine Sb2Se3 based solar cells. Our study provides an effective strategy to manipulate the defect formation in Sb2Se3 solar cells and inspires further improvement in the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells.
Introduction
Antimony chalcogenides, Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3, possess identical crystal structures with (Sb4S(e)6)n ribbons in the [001] direction.1,2 Sb2Te3, however, exhibits a rhombohedral crystal structure with two-dimensional configuration in the [010] direction (Fig. 1a).3 Sb2S3, Sb2Se3 and the alloy-Sb2(S,Se)3 have attracted intensive attention for their potential in photovoltaic applications.4–8 In particular, Sb2Se3 has a band gap of ∼1.1 eV, situated at the low end of the optimum values for light harvesting materials.9 This band gap enables a theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 32% for a single-junction solar cell according to the Shockley–Queisser limit.10 In addition, Sb2Se3 consists of earth-abundant elements with excellent long-term stability, and is therefore regarded as one of the promising candidates for new generation solar cells. Due to the potential photovoltaic applications, increasing efforts have been put into the efficiency improvement of Sb2Se3-based solar cell. Materials synthesis and film deposition have been the major focus during past years. Typically, solution process based on thiol–amine mixed dissolution solvents11 has led to a benchmark efficiency of 3.9%, while the vapor deposition derived films have generated efficiencies of 7.6% (ref. 8) and 9.2% (ref. 7) in superstrate and substrate device architectures, respectively.

All photovoltaic materials share an identical light-to-electricity energy conversion process. However, the defect property of each photovoltaic material is distinct owing to the materials processing approach, chemical composition as well as the crystal structure. Sb2Se3 is a binary compound with a quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) crystal structure. The simple chemical composition, in principle, generates less defect types, while the low symmetry crystal structure would bring about unexpected defect characteristics. First-principle calculations show that the intrinsic defects in Sb2Se3 are complicated and differ from those in conventional binary photovoltaic semiconductors such as CdTe or GaAs.12 Typically, uncommon defects SeSb and VSb have high concentrations in Se-rich Sb2Se3, while VSe and SbSe are the dominant defects in Se-poor Sb2Se3.13–15 Experimentally, limited examples of control over defect formation have been reported, and experimental studies on the defect properties of Sb2Se3 are rare. For example, vapor transport deposition is more effective to suppress the antisite defect pairs SbSe + SeSb when compared with the conventional rapid thermal evaporation method.8 Moreover, in situ Se compensation during the thermal evaporation process could create a Se-rich environment, and Sb2Se3 films grown in a Se-rich environment demonstrated SeSb acceptors.16 In essence, the defect formation is sensitively dependent on the processing method and intrinsic chemical and structural properties of the specific material.
In this work, we demonstrate an effective strategy to suppress the defect formation of Sb2Se3 films by introducing tellurium. Our results show that tellurium and selenium tend to competitively react with antimony to form Sb2Te3-doped Sb2Se3, instead of alloy type Sb2(Se,Te)3. This competitive reaction in turn leads to regulation of the atomic ratio of Se/Sb. We found that a suitable excess of selenium induces significantly reduced hole traps, while the selenium-poor Sb2Se3 generates detrimental electron traps. The reduced deep level defects render longer carrier lifetimes in light of the absorption layer, and give rise to pronounced enhancement in the device parameters, including short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF).
Results and discussion
We adopted a spin-coating and annealing process for the preparation of Sb2Se3 and Te-doped Sb2Se3 films. The Sb–Se precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Sb and Se powder in a mixture of ethylenediamine (EA) and mercaptoethanol (ME) with a volume ratio of 4:1. ME was used instead of ethanethiol for the following three reasons: (1) in terms of experimental safety, ethanethiol is volatile, odorous, and has high toxicity towards humans, ME is less volatile; (2) the ME–EA solvent mixture has stronger solubility towards Se and Sb powders compared with ethanethiol–EA solvent mixtures;17 (3) ME has a high boiling point at 157 °C, while the boiling point of ethanethiol is as low as 36 °C. The violent evaporation of ethanethiol during annealing would result in poor quality Sb2Se3 films, affecting device efficiency. For Te doping, the molar ratios of the Te/(Se + Te) in the precursor solution were set to 0%, 1%, 2%, and 4% for a systematic study. After stirring for 4–5 h at 60 °C, the mixture turns into a homogenous solution, which can remain stable for months under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The as-prepared Sb–Se precursor solution displays an orange color and becomes darker and darker with increasing amounts of tellurium in the solution (Fig. 1b). From a chemistry perspective, the dissolution of bulk Se and Te in a EA–ME mixed solution yields nucleophiles, HOC2H4SE− (E = Se or Te), and the presence of these nucleophiles greatly increases the solubility of Sb for the formation of Sb–Se or Sb–Te complexes (Fig. 1c).17 The precursor solution with Sb–Se or Sb–Te complexes was spun onto an fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/CdS layer, followed by thermal decomposition to form the solid film (Fig. 1d). The optimized annealing process conditions are applied in two-consecutive steps: at 200 °C for 1 min and 400 °C for 2 min on a preheated hotplate in a N2-purged glove box. The dependence of device efficiency on the annealing temperature is shown in Fig. S1.† Both the pristine Sb2Se3-based device and Te-doped Sb2Se3 device, achieve the highest efficiency with an annealing temperature of 400 °C. Therefore, the doping of tellurium does not change the optimum annealing temperature compared with undoped Sb2Se3 films.
We firstly conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments to confirm the crystal structure of the as-obtained films (Fig. 2a). All of the films exhibit the same peak positions and similar peak intensity. The diffractions at 10.6, 16.9, 27.0, 28.2, 31.2° can be assigned to the (110), (120), (021), (211), and (221) crystal planes of orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (JCPDS 15-0861).11 There are no additional peaks that can be indexed as Sb2Te3 at this concentration range. Once we increase the Te concentration to 15% in the precursor solution, an additional Sb2Te3 phase appears, instead of the peak of Sb2Se3 shifting (Fig. S2†). This observation suggests that the Te atoms did not substitute Se atoms in the Sb2Se3 lattice.

(c) Sb 3d XPS spectra and (d) Te 3d XPS spectra, of the pristine Sb2Se3 film and the film prepared by 2% Te doping in the precursor solution. The films were deposited on silicon substrates. 
Furthermore, the light absorption spectra also shows a similar absorption shape with nearly identical onset wavelength (Fig. 2b). The band gap of Sb2Te3 is 0.21 eV, while that of Sb2Se3 is 1.1 eV. The formation of the alloy Sb2(Se,Te)3 should generate a sensitive shift in the absorption spectrum, so the same onset wavelength indicates again that the Te atoms are not incorporated into the lattice to form alloy type Sb2(Se,Te)3.
To probe the chemical coordination of tellurium in the thin film, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments. As shown in Fig. 2c, there are four peaks in Sb 3d spectra. The binding energies at 538.3 and 528.9 eV are ascribed to the Sb 3d3/2 and Sb 3d5/2 of Sb2Se3. The binding energy at 539.6 and 530.3 eV are assigned to the Sb 3d3/2 and Sb 3d5/2 of Sb2O3.18Fig. 2d shows a metallic peak at 572.5 eV and an oxide peak at 576.0 eV for Te 3d5/2, clearly showing Sb2Te3 and Sb2TexO3−x, respectively.19 Combined with XRD analysis, we conclude that Te is coordinated with Sb at the grain boundaries or surface as depicted in Fig. 1d. Most likely, the different crystal structures between Sb2Se3 and Sb2Te3 prevent the formation of the alloy-Sb2(Se,Te)3 film. In contrast, Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 have identical crystal structures so that the alloy, Sb2(S,Se)3, can form with continuous S/Se atomic ratios across a wide atomic ratio range.20
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was applied to quantify the element composition in the prepared thin films. The calculated doping concentrations of Te (molar ratio of Te/(Te + Se)) are 1.21%, 2.21% and 3.77%, corresponding to the initial feeding concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4%, respectively (Table S1†). On the other hand, the incorporation of tellurium also decreases the Se/Sb atom ratios. Pristine Sb2Se3 thin films have a Se/Sb atom ratio of 1.578:1. The atom ratios reduce to 1.569:1 and 1.537:1 with Te doping concentrations of 1.21% and 2.21%, respectively. When the Te doping concentration reaches 3.77%, the atom ratio of Se/Sb is 1.465:1, which suggests the formation of Se-poor Sb2Se3 thin films. The sustained decline of the Se/Sb atom ratio with the incorporation of Te may be due to the high melting temperature of Te compared to that of Se, as Se is easier to evaporate out during the annealing process. This change in the Se/Sb atomic ratio from Se-rich to Se-poor provides an excellent model system and is expected to generate distinct defect characteristics according to the calculations.14
The device structure was FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where CdS and Spiro-OMeTAD served as electron and hole extraction layers, respectively. All of the as-obtained films display a flat surface morphology (Fig. S3†). The average grain size of pristine Sb2Se3 is 150 nm. Once the 1% and 2% tellurium are added in the precursor solution, the average grain size increases to 200 nm, respectively. However, when the doping concentration increases to 4%, the average grain size increases to 250 nm, while large pin holes at around 200 nm appear. In this case, more Te is concentrated in the grain boundaries, preventing the growth of grains and generating more pin holes in the film. The increased pin holes would increase the probability of direct contact between the electron transport layer and the hole transport layer.
A cross sectional SEM image of the typical device is shown in Fig. 3a, from which the thickness of the CdS buffer layer, absorption layer, HTM, and Au electrode are measured to be 50, 120, 100, and 80 nm, respectively. The J–V curves of the devices (Fig. S4†) were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The pristine Sb2Se3 device delivers a PCE of 3.3%, with a JSC of 21.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 312 mV and FF of 48.2%. The Te-doping concentration of 1.21% increases the PCE to 4.2%. Once the Te-doping concentration increases to 2.21%, the PCE is remarkably increased to 5.4%, with a VOC of 360 mV, JSC of 29.0 mA cm−2, and FF of 51.5% (Fig. 3b and c). Further increasing the Te-doping concentration to 3.77%, however, brings forth a PCE decrease to 2.9%.

(f) Transient kinetic decay and kinetic fits (solid lines) monitored at 720 nm for pristine and 2.21% Te-doped Sb2Se3 films. 
We also extract the series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) to study the transport properties of the film. Since the prepared devices differ only in the light absorption layer, the electrical conductivity of the Sb2Se3 films can be represented by a series resistance difference. The incorporation of Te in the Sb2Se3 films effectively reduced the RS of the device (Table S2†), which suggests an improvement in the electrical transport properties in Te:Sb2Se3 films. On the other hand, the RSH was obviously increased by Te doping, indicating the significant reduction of charge recombination. In this case, the improved conductivity and suppressed recombination can be attributed to the significantly reduced deep level deep defects (vide infra).
To understand how Te-doping alters the defect properties of Sb2Se3 films and the device efficiency, we conducted deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) experiments. Fig. 3d shows the as-obtained DLTS signals from the capacitance mode. The capacitance was measured using a HF frequency of 1 MHz under the reverse bias voltage of 0.4 V after applying a pulse voltage of −0.4 V. A temperature scan was made between 120 and 400 K at a heating rate of 2 K min−1. Arrhenius plots of three devices are shown in Fig. 3e. The activation energy and capture cross-section of the hole traps and electron traps can be obtained from the Arrhenius plots using eqn (1) and (2): (1) (2)where k is the Boltzmann constant, the activation energy (ET − EV) or (EC − ET) can be obtained from the slope of the corresponding line, and the capture cross-section (Xpσp) or (Xnσn) can be derived from the y-intercept of the lines. The trap concentration (NT) can be obtained from eqn (3): (3)where NS is the shallow dopant concentration in the Sb2Se3 film, CR is the capacitance under reverse bias. With that we can calculate the defect energy level, concentration, as well as the cross sections, which are summarized in Table S3.† Typically, the pristine Sb2Se3 device (pristine-device) displays three deep traps. There are two hole traps H1 (ΔE = 0.48 eV, NT = 6.10 × 1014 cm−3), H2 (ΔE = 0.71 eV, NT = 1.00 × 1015 cm−3) and one electron trap E1 (ΔE = 0.63 eV, NT = 6.49 × 1014 cm−3). The hole traps and electron traps correspond to acceptor and donor defects, respectively. Combining with the calculated defect energy levels in Sb2Se3,14 the H1, H2 and E1 can be readily indexed to the antimony vacancy (VSb), selenium antisite (SeSb) and antimony antisite (SbSe) defects, respectively. For the best Sb2Se3 device (2.21% Te doping), only one hole trap, H1 (ΔE = 0.48 eV, NT = 5.34 × 1013 cm−3), and one electron trap, E1 (ΔE = 0.64 eV, NT = 3.32 × 1014 cm−3), are detected. On the other hand, by finely tuning the stoichiometry in the absence of Te in the precursor solution, a Se/Sb atom ratio of 1.532 was achieved in the Sb2Sb3 film, which is almost identical to that of the 2.21% Te-doped Sb2Se3 film. The device prepared based on this absorption film, only had an efficiency of 3.6% and the defect types in this device do not change compared with the pristine-Sb2Se3 device according to the DLTS test (Table S4†). Therefore, the film defect properties and efficiency of the device were not changed substantially just by controlling the precursor Se/Sb ratio. The results indicate that Te incorporation plays a role in reducing hole trap concentrations, i.e. the disappearance of SeSb defects and a lower concentration of VSb. Here, we cautiously attribute the improvement in device performance mainly to the reduction in defect type and concentration. Although the grain size of Sb2Se3 has increased by 2.21% Te doping (from 150 nm to 200 nm), this slight increase in grain size may not greatly reduce the non-radiative recombination. As the antisite defect SeSb is the dominant deep defect under the Se-rich condition8 and has a high defect concentration of 1.00 × 1015 cm−3, this defect was nearly completely suppressed which is expected to greatly reduce the charge recombination and thus improve the device performance.
Further increasing the Te doping concentration to 3.77% leads to a continuous reduction of hole traps (H1) (Fig. S5†). However, the concentration of SbSe electron traps (ΔE = 0.79 eV, NT = 3.61 × 1015 cm−3) exhibits an order of magnitude increase. Moreover, a new electron trap (Se vacancy (VSe), ΔE = 0.54 eV, NT = 2.84 × 1013 cm−3) appeared. This change in the defect properties is expected. In this sample, the Sb2Se3 film becomes Sb-rich. This composition change leads to the increased probability of Sb substituting Se, and Se vacancies, in the Sb2Se3 lattice. On the one hand, the defect concentration in Sb2Se3 significantly increased, on the other hand, larger pin holes were formed in the Sb2Se3 film when the Te doping concentration was 3.77%. These two negative factors cause serious charge recombination and thus greatly reduce the device efficiency.
To complete the investigation, we tested the effects of sulfur doping into the Sb2Se3 film using the same film preparation method. Upon sulfur incorporation, XRD characterization shows a peak shifting to a high diffraction angle, and the UV-vis absorption spectra displays onset absorption shifting to a shorter wavelength (Fig. S6†), both of which suggest the formation of an Sb2(S,Se)3 alloy phase. Similarly, we introduced a S-doping concentration of 5.23% in the Sb2Se3 based device. It turns out that the sulfur-doped Sb2Se3 film shows the same defect types (H1, H2 and E1) (Fig. 3d) and nearly the same concentrations compared with the pristine Sb2Se3-based device (Table S3†), indicating that the sulfur is unable to suppress defect formation. The PCE of the S-doped Sb2Se3 device (5.23% molar ratio) has an even worse efficiency of 2.06% (with VOC of 258 mV, JSC of 19.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 41.2%) compared to that of the pristine Sb2Se3-based device. As shown in Fig. S7,† the surface morphology is rather poor with abundant pin holes, which leads to serious charge recombination and the poor device efficiency. In addition, we also compare the absorber film of our best device to the state-of-the-art device with identical configuration fabricated by vapor deposition.21 It is noted that the VOC and FF of the device herein are not satisfactory, which decreases the device efficiency. To further improve the device efficiency, the defect properties, crystallinity, as well as orientation, should be the major considerations.
Carrier transport dynamics in the pristine Sb2Se3 film and the best Sb2Se3 film (with 2.21% Te doping) were studied by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Time-resolved transient spectra were recorded over a time window of 0–7000 ps following a 580 nm laser pulse on two Sb2Se3 films deposited on soda-lime glass. The decay kinetics of the related band edge bleaching are exhibited in Fig. 3f. In the absence of any electron acceptor or donor species, as in the glass/Sb2Se3 film, the decay kinetics show the relaxation of excited Sb2Se3 to the ground state through charge recombination. The kinetic curves are normalized and fitted by the biexponential decay kinetic model shown in eqn (4). This fit yields a short (τ1) and a long (τ2) decay lifetime and weighted coefficients (A1 and A2) representing the contribution of each exponent to the normalized biexponential, which are summarized in Table S5.† Referring to the transient absorption study of Sb2S3,22,23τ1 and τ2 represent two distinct hole trapping processes. The increase of both τ1 and τ2 in the Te-doped Sb2Se3 thin film indicates lower hole trap concentration and thus a reduction of hole recombination in the Sb2Se3 layer. y = A1e(−x/τ1) + A2e(−x/τ2)(4)
We further conducted external quantum efficiency (EQE) to study how the defect property affects the photocurrent generation with regard to the wavelength of light irradiation. As shown in the EQE spectra (Fig. 4a), both the pristine device and best device show a photoresponse in the range 300–1100 nm, while the best device exhibits a higher EQE in the whole photoresponse region and in turn leads to an obvious enhancement in JSC. The improvement at longer wavelengths (520–900 nm) indicates that the Te-doped best device has a lower defect density and longer carrier lifetime.16 Photoresponse efficiency around the 300–520 nm region is mainly affected by absorption in CdS layer. As the CdS layers were prepared under identical conditions, the EQE improvement for the best device in the short wavelength region can be attributed to the reduced recombination losses at the CdS/Sb2Se3 interface.24
 Fig. 4  (a) EQE spectra and (b) Nyquist plots under dark conditions at 0.3 V, for the pristine device and the best device (with 2.21% Te-doping). 
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results were recorded at a potential of 0.3 V at frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 4 MHz. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4b, and the inset shows the equivalent electrical circuit model. R1 is related to the internal series resistance of the device, and R2 is associated with the charge recombination resistance of the device.25 The value of R2 for the pristine device is 2196 Ω cm2, while that of the best device increases to 7843 Ω cm2. The remarkable increase in recombination resistance suggests the 2.21% Te doping Sb2Se3 based device prevents charge recombination more efficiently than the pristine Sb2Se3 based device, as the reduced deep level defect as discussed above should be at work. This reduced recombination probability contributes to the enhancement in VOC and FF of the device.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that doping tellurium into Sb2Se3 films effectively reduces the deep level defects of Sb2Se3. The introduction of tellurium in the solution process leads to competitive reaction with antimony precursors, finally tailoring the Se/Sb atomic ratios in the as-synthesized Sb2Se3 films. By fine tuning the doping concentration of tellurium, Se-rich and Se-poor Sb2Se3 can be well obtained, which provides an excellent platform for investigating the chemical composition dependent defect properties. With that, this research discloses that the Se-rich Sb2Se3 is prone to form VSb and SeSb defects, while the formation of SbSe and VSe defects is favored in Sb-rich Sb2Se3. By optimizing the doping concentration of Te, a PCE of 5.4% is obtained, which is the highest efficiency in solution processed Sb2Se3 solar cells. This study provides experimental understanding of the defect formation and offers an effective approach to reduce deep level defect formation.
