, Accepted 14th November 2014First published on 17th November 2014AbstractTwo different processes, namely the Bamford–Stevens and [4 + 2] Diels Alder reactions, have been optimized under microwave irradiation for the functionalization of fullerenes. In this manner, all the main C60- and C70-based acceptor derivatives for organic solar cells such as PCBM, DPM, BHN and ICBA, have been prepared in higher yields and shorter reaction times with respect to the reported data. These findings represent a step forward toward the wide production of cheaper organic solar cells as a consequence of the cost abatement of the acceptors given by higher yields, lower waste production, and reduced reaction time which means a strong energy saving.
Introduction
In the last two decades the organic photovoltaic (OPV) field has witnessed a very impressive momentum in terms of people engaged in and in terms of results. After the first evidence for photoinduced electron transfer from a conjugated polymer to fullerene,1 C60-derivatives have been largely employed as n-type organic semiconductors due to their excellent electron-accepting capability.2 Since then, a number of modified fullerenes have been tested in donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs),3–11 phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester [60]PCBM12–20 and its C70 analogue, [70]PCBM21–27 being the most widely studied (Fig. 1). Performances of such BHJ PSCs are still lower compared to inorganic semiconductor solar cells. Many efforts have been made in order to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. The structure optimization of fullerene derivatives is a way to reach better results in terms of PCE. In fact, the molecular design of acceptor species allows to tune their frontier energy levels28 in order to facilitate exciton dissociation and reach higher open circuit voltage (Voc), being the last one determined by the offset between the donor's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the fullerene's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).29 Most used fullerene monoadducts, such as the above mentioned [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM but also [60]DPM and [70]DPM,30–35 have the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) at a relatively low energy level, which gives rise to a small Voc when poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as donor species. The introduction of electron-donating groups in the fullerene acceptor species, as well as the use of bis-adducts of fullerene, lead to an increase of the LUMO energy level.36 In this regard, it has been shown that the further functionalization of fullerene to reach production of bis-adducts does not have a great influence on the charge-carrier properties of the fullerene and that the isomer mixture of bis-adducts can be directly used giving rise to cells with greater performances than those constituted by corresponding monoadducts.36,37 Another important feature of bisadducts is their higher solubility in common organic solvents compared to corresponding monoadducts.38–42 This improved solubility may ensure a better morphology of the blend film, which constitutes an important factor in the PSCs fabrication.43 In this way, recently, novel C60 bisadducts such as [60]BHN (bishydronaphthyl-C60)44–46 and [60]ICBA (indene-C60 bisadduct)47–52 emerged as key acceptors in high performing BHJ PSCs. Nevertheless, taking advantage of two decades of optimization in OPV, [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM are still able to afford tandem devices with outstanding power conversion efficiencies in the 6.0–10.6% range.53–56

However, in order to ensure large-scale diffusion of PSCs, it is necessary to have a facile and convenient access to all substances employed in the fabrication of such solar cells. Especially regarding the synthesis of different acceptor species, one of the main drawback in the synthesis of fullerene derivatives is that the reported examples show from low to moderate yields often below 40% and/or long reaction time, which in several cases reach up to 72 h.37,38,44,45,47,57–61 These weak points strongly contribute to a higher final price for the fullerene-acceptors.
Nowadays the use of microwave irradiation in organic synthesis, which was introduced about thirty years ago by Gedye and by the group of Giguere and Majetich,62,63 has become a common use technique applied in almost all laboratories as an alternative to conventional heating processes to carry out a large number of reactions in different fields of chemistry.64–66 The so-called microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) is an ever-growing field due to its many benefits.67–70 There are many examples reported in literature in which the use of microwave irradiation leads to a drastic reduction of reaction time, an improving of yields and a diminishing of side reactions.71–73 Furthermore, an interesting approach to MAOS consists in the possible use of solvent-free conditions.71,74–78 The absence of solvent to carry out chemical transformations under MW irradiation is a good method to optimize efficiency (in this case absorption of MW radiation is limited only to reactants) and simplify clean procedures of such chemical reactions. In the light of this, microwave mediated functionalization of fullerenes, and more in general of carbon nanoforms (CNFs), which interact strongly with microwaves,79–82 may overcome the problem of both productivity and efficiency in terms of yields and reaction time. First examples on use of microwave irradiation for functionalization of fullerenes are due to Langa and Martìn.83–87 Their works showed, through a direct comparison, as microwave irradiation is more efficient than conventional conductive heating to perform various chemical functionalizations in a shorter time and with improved yields.
Taking into account the above, herein simple and very efficient synthetic procedures based on MW irradiation were optimized in order to obtain mono-, bis-, and tris-adducts of the most common fullerene-derivatives employed in OPV in good yields and in a short time. Results obtained in terms of yields are in almost all cases the best reported so far.
Results and discussion
The first process to be investigated was the modified Bamford–Stevens reaction for the synthesis of [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM mono-, bis- and trisadducts (Scheme 1), firstly reported by Hummelen and Wudl.88 Although these derivatives are the widest employed in the fabrication of organic solar cells, just recently some efforts have been devoted to the improvement of the yields by using the continuous flow technology.89,90 A key factor for the right outcome of the reaction is the tosylhydrazone 1/fullerene ratio, which will direct the process toward the preferential formation of the monoadduct or to the bis- and trisadducts. Since the title transformation leads to the formation of both [6,6]-closed methanofullerene and [5,6]-open fulleroid stereoisomers, being the latter the kinetically favored and the former the most stable,91 an important factor is the temperature at which the reaction is carried out. In this regard, usually the rearrangement of the [5,6]-open to the [6,6]-closed form can be achieved by means of photochemical irradiation25,92,93 or by thermal treatment in refluxing 1,2-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) for several hours.88,91,94

In Table 1, the microwave-mediated optimization of the synthesis of PCBM derivatives is reported. We planned to carry out the reaction at 180 °C in oDCB with the aim to work under thermodynamic control and concomitantly pursue the isomerization of the [5,6]-open isomer eventually produced. The microwave oven (closed vessel CEM DISCOVER monomode system in manual mode with no pressure control) was settled to 180 °C, temperature reached within 2 minutes and an observed power of 150 W. Afterwards, the oven kept the above temperature automatically supplying 100 W, which in 30 minutes decreased to a constant power supply of 48 W. To our delight, 1 hour is sufficient to the reaction smoothly proceed to the excellent formation of [60]PCBM 2a with a 65% yield when 1/C60 ratio of 0.66 is employed (entry 1). To our knowledge, this is the highest yield reported so far, being the precedent value 59% obtained under continuous flow conditions (conversion determined by HPLC, isolated yield 35%).90 It is worth to note that 1H and 13C NMR spectra confirmed the exclusive presence of [6,6]-closed form (see Fig. S1 and S2†). Hence, tosylhydrazone 1/fullerene ratio was varied in order to maximize the production of bisadducts 2b and trisadducts 2c (entries 2–4).

Interestingly, when the ratios were >2.5 the fullerene conversion was complete affording, in the case of 1/C60 ratio 3, 2b in 43% (entry 3) yield and 2c in 47% yield when the ratio was 4 (entry 4). Unfortunately, in the literature bis- and trisadducts yields are not reported since they are collected as “byproducts” of the synthesis of [60]PCBM, however these obtained represent very good values taking into account that even higher adducts could be produced during the process. Finally, also the syntheses of [70]PCBM 3a and bis [70]PCBM 3b have been optimized (entries 5–7). In the former case, the 1/C70 ratio of 0.66 led to the outstanding yield of 83% for 3a which is unprecedented (entry 5, the previous record was 59%).25 Differently from C60, which possess a single kind of [6,6] bond, [70]fullerene has four different [6,6] bonds and up to three different isomers of monoadduct can be formed (α, β and γ). In our case the three isomers of [70]PCBM 3a have been formed in a 80/11/9 ratio for α, β1 and β2, respectively (from 1H NMR spectra – see Fig. S5†). Total conversion and a substantially equal distribution of 3b and 3c are achieved with 1/C70 ratio of 3.0 (entry 7).
The general applicability of the microwave-mediated protocol for the Bamford–Stevens reaction has been checked through the synthesis of the series of diphenylmethanofullerene-derivatives with the hexyloxy-chains (DPM6 – Scheme 2). This class of acceptors is of interest due to higher Voc showed by the devices in which they are employed in the active layer in comparison with those containing PCBM derivatives.31 In Table 2, the microwave-mediated optimization of the synthesis of DPM6 derivatives is reported. The same conditions used for PCBM derivatives were applied also for DPM6, generally resulting in a minor conversion to the products. This finding is clearly reflected in the case of a 4/C60 ratio of 0.66 which gave rise to a conversion of 42% (yield of 5a 40%) after 1 h of irradiation at 180 °C whereas for the PCBM the conversion was >92% (compare entry 1 with entry 1 of Table 1). Once again, the exclusive presence of [6,6]-closed form can be confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra (see Fig. S13 and S14†). An increase in the irradiation time to 2 h resulted in an enhanced conversion with 48% yield for 5a (entry 2). On the other hand, in order to maximize the yield of 5b, 4/C60 ratio as well as reaction time has been varied (entries 3–6).

Interestingly, in none of these reaction trisadducts were produced above 5%, likely due to the bulkiness of DPM substituent. An increase in the reaction time from 1 to 2 h had a remarkable effect on the yield of [60]DPM6 bisadducts (from 41 to 61%) when a 4/C60 ratio of 4.0 has been used (entries 4 and 5). A more prolonged reaction time had no additional beneficial effect (entry 6). Applying the best conditions found for 5a, [70]DPM6 6a has been synthesized in 57% of yield being the two isomers α and β in a 9/1 ratio (entry 7), whereas 3 h of irradiation led to the best results for [70]DPM6 bisadducts 6b, which was obtained in 59% yield (entry 9).
Microwave-assisted Diels–Alder [4 + 2] cycloadditions were the first transformations investigated for fullerenes with the help of microwave irradiation.83,87,95 As stated, recently C60 and C70 bisadducts such as [60]BHN (bishydronaphthyl-C60)44–46 and [60]ICBA (indene-C60 bisadduct),47–52 prepared through [4 + 2] cycloadditions, attracted the interest as novel acceptor materials for OPV due to their excellent performances in terms of PCE. Hence, we focused our attention on the optimization of BHN-derivatives synthesis employing the sultine 7 as ideal precursor of the o-quinodimethane intermediate, since it decomposes with chelotropic extrusion of sulfur dioxide at around 80 °C, not producing additional organic or inorganic byproducts (Scheme 3). Initially, a 7/C60 ratio equal to 3 has been chosen, using oDCB as solvent and the temperature was set to 100 °C leaving the reaction for 1 h (Table 3, entry 1). Under these conditions, an equilibrium power of 7 W has been reached which was sufficient to afford the total conversion of fullerene, giving rise to a yield of 54% for the desired bis-adduct 8b. Raising the temperature to 130 °C just had a marginal beneficial effect on the yield of 8b (entry 2), whereas a 7/C60 ratio of 4 allowed to obtain a remarkable yield of 63% (entry 3). This value is exactly the same obtained by us carrying out the reaction under classical thermal conditions in refluxing toluene for 15 h that slightly differs from the 72% reported (conversion determined by HPLC).44

Hence, the same conditions were successfully applied in the synthesis of the C70 analogue 9b achieving the outstanding yield of 68% (entry 4), higher than the best reported value (64%).57
Finally, by means of microwave-assisted [4 + 2] Diels–Alder cycloadditions, we optimized the syntheses of ICBA-derivatives reacting fullerenes and in situ thermally converted isoindene (Scheme 4). Differently from the reactions previously investigated, ICBA-derivatives require higher indene/fullerene ratio (10–36 equivalents). In our case, adopting a 10/C60 ratio of 12 in oDCB at 180 °C irradiating for 1 h, resulted in the formation of 49% of monoadduct 11a (Table 4, entry 1), which has not utility in OPV due to its scarce solubility. Then, the use of 24 equivalents irradiated for 1 h led to an improved yield in 11b (54%), even though the not complete conversion of C60 (entry 2) suggested the possibility to irradiate for a longer time. Hence, 2 h of irradiation had a beneficial effect both on the total conversion as well as in the yield of [60]ICBA, which reached the remarkable value of 62% with the concomitant decrease to 11% of yield for the monoadduct (entry 3). Almost the same result gave the employment of 36 equivalents of indene irradiated for 1 h (entry 4), whereas no improvements were achieved with longer reaction times (entries 5 and 6). On the contrary, with a 10/C70 of 36, 2 h of reaction was found as optimum for obtaining a 62% yield of [70]ICBA 12b (entries 7–9). It is worth to note that, once again, for bisadduct 11b and 12b, the yields obtained are the higher reported so far, being the previous 54% (ref. 90) and 58%,48 respectively. It is worth to note that under solvent-free conditions the reaction was hard to control, giving rise to a mixture of higher adducts. Probably the presence of a solvent able to partially absorb microwaves and to transfer the heat (tanδ oDCB: 0.28 (ref. 96)), helps to have a better control on the reaction.

Conclusions
In conclusion, [4 + 2]Diels Alder cycloaddition and, for the first time, modified Bamford–Stevens reaction, have been optimized under microwave irradiation for the functionalization of fullerenes. Such protocols have been applied to the improved synthesis of C60- and C70-based acceptor derivatives for OPV such as PCBM, DPM, BHN and ICBA (mono-, bis-, and in some case tris-adducts). In almost all cases the acceptors have been obtained in high yields (48–82% range), which have been increased or al least paired with respect to those reported in literature. One of the main advantages of the reported microwave-assisted protocols is that often the complete fullerene conversion is achieved within 1–3 hours, sensibly less than the reaction times required under classical conditions (16–72 h), and with high selectivity toward the target acceptor. Thus, the higher yields of a selected acceptor are accompanied by a less waste production (side products) and a sensitive energy and time saving. As a whole, acceptors molecules can be produced with strong cost abatement, which will represent a step forward toward the wide production of cheaper organic solar cells. Further, improvements involving the continuous-flow scaling up of the microwave-assisted synthesis of fullerene-acceptors are currently underway in our laboratories.
