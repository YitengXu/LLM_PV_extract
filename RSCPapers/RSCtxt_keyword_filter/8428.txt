This control over donor molecule crystallization leads to a reduction in optimized thermal annealing times as well as smaller donor molecule crystallites, and therefore more efficient devices, when using an excessive amount of solvent additive. We therefore demonstrate the use of nucleating agents as a powerful and versatile processing strategy for solution-processed, small molecule BHJ OPVs.
Bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ OPVs) are a particularly interesting photovoltaic technology primarily because they have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% and can be solution-processed over large areas.1,2 In a BHJ OPV device, absorption of a photon produces an exciton which must then be split at a donor–acceptor molecular heterojunction in order to generate free charge carriers. These free carriers are then swept out of the device, thereby generating electrical current.3 The nanoscale BHJ morphology of the donor–acceptor active layer in a BHJ OPV device therefore significantly affects device performance.4,5 Accordingly, a variety of processing techniques have been utilized to control the development of BHJ nanoscale morphology, i.e. the degree of solid state order and the spatial distribution of donor and acceptor (phase separation), such as post film formation thermal annealing6–8 and the incorporation of solvent additives into the casting solution.7,9,10 Recent work suggests that crystallization of the donor molecule is particularly important in BHJ OPV devices fabricated using small molecule donors and the fullerene acceptor phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).7,11,12 Likewise, control of polymer crystallization has proven essential for the manufacture of many consumer products. Nucleating agents are widely used to control crystallization in commodity polymers in order to tailor their mechanical, thermal and optical properties.13–15 More recently, nucleating agents functionality has been extended to organic electronics as they have been used to increase the device yield and processability of solution-processed organic field-effect transistors (FETs) as well as limit the size of PCBM crystallites upon thermal annealing.16,17
In this communication, we describe the use of 1,3:2,4-bis(3,4-dimethylbenzylidene)sorbitol (DMDBS; Millad 3988), a commercially available nucleating agent commonly used to clarify isotactic polypropylene (iPP), to control the crystallization of two different small molecule donors, 3,6-bis(5-(benzofuran-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP(TBFu)2) and 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2), during processing of BHJ OPV devices (Fig. 1). By controlling donor molecule crystallization, DMDBS is shown to act as a useful processing additive for solution-processed small molecule BHJ OPV devices. Specifically, we find that DMDBS can be used to: (1) decrease the annealing time necessary for BHJ OPV device optimization and (2) reduce the size of donor crystallites nucleated during film formation when using a solvent additive.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the electron donors (DPP(TBFu)2, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2), electron acceptor (PC71BM), and nucleating agent (DMDBS) used in this study. 
We first show that use of DMDBS accelerates the crystallization kinetics of DPP(TBFu)2 in DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices. The DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV system forms a homogenous, amorphous blend when cast from chloroform, but, upon thermal annealing, DPP(TBFu)2 crystallizes, leading to phase separation and a significant increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and, in turn, PCE.12 DPP(TBFu)2 crystallization therefore occurs on an experimentally accessible timescale and directly affects OPV device performance, thus allowing a straightforward analysis of the nucleating agent's effects. Fig. 2 displays Jsc as a function of isothermal annealing time for DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices processed without and with 1.4 wt% DMDBS. Both devices display near identical Jsc in the as-cast state, approximately 0.45 mA cm−2. However, the devices cast without and with nucleating agent respond drastically different to the isothermal annealing with the Jsc of the device processed with DMDBS increasing significantly faster than the device processed without DMDBS. The Jsc of the device processed with DMDBS increases to 4.62 mA cm−2 after 22 minutes whereas the device processed without DMDBS does not exhibit a comparable Jsc until approximately 44 minutes of annealing.

As explained below, we infer that the accelerated increase in Jsc as a function of isothermal annealing exhibited by the device processed with DMDBS compared to the device processed without DMDBS is the result of a faster DPP(TBFu)2 nucleation rate leading to faster crystallization kinetics in the presence of DMDBS. This interpretation of the data is consistent with the observation that, in DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices, DPP(TBFu)2 crystallization leads to increased phase separation and a concomitant increase in Jsc, thus directly linking donor crystallization to increased Jsc.12 Additionally, this interpretation is consistent with the fact that sorbitol-based nucleating agents were developed to accelerate the primary nucleation rate of iPP during solidification from the melt18–20 and have more recently demonstrated the ability to modulate the crystallization of a variety of organic semiconductors.16 According to classic nucleation theory, nucleating agents improve the rate of primary nucleation by reducing the driving force needed to form a stable nuclei, resulting in an increase in the overall crystallization rate of a material.21 It therefore appears that DMDBS is remarkably able to have a similar effect on the molecular semiconductor DPP(TBFu)2 in a DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV blend.
Further evidence for this hypothesis was collected using in situ isothermal annealing grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments, which were performed on DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ blend films cast without and with DMDBS. The data in Fig. 3 reveal that the crystallization kinetics of DPP(TBFu)2 are faster with DMDBS compared to without. To quantify this difference the in situ isothermal annealing GIWAXS data was fit using Avrami kinetics22–24 as described by eqn (1):  F = 1 − exp[−(kt)n](1)where F is the fractional crystallization at time t, k is a temperature dependent rate constant and n is referred to as the Avrami exponent, which is often interpreted as indicative of the geometry or dimensionality of the crystallization process. The results of this fitting process are displayed in Table 1. DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ blend films without and with DMDBS exhibit essentially the same Avrami constant, suggesting DMDBS does not significantly alter the crystallization geometry or dimensionality. The overall crystallization rate constant for the two samples, however, differs with the film prepared with DMDBS having a rate constant approximately 1.5 times greater than the film prepared without DMDBS. This increased rate constant for DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ blends prepared with DMDBS is consistent with the data in Fig. 2 and confirms that incorporation of DMDBS into DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ blend films leads to accelerated DPP(TBFu)2 crystallization kinetics.

The effect of DMDBS was also investigated on a small molecule BHJ OPV system that is optimized using a solvent additive. The PCE of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV system increases from 1.8% to 7.0% when fabricated with 0.4 vol% of the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO).7 The morphology, and therefore PCE, of this system is very sensitive to the amount of DIO incorporated into the BHJ casting solution. Specifically, 1.0 vol% DIO leads to the formation of large p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystals and concomitant large scale BHJ phase separation and decreases PCE to less than 1.0%.7 We have thus investigated whether DMDBS can be used as an additional tool to control p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization, and therefore device performance, by preventing large scale p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization as has been previously demonstrated for PCBM.16,17p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices were accordingly fabricated with 1.5 vol% DIO and varying amounts of DMDBS (Fig. 4). The control device fabricated without DMDBS exhibits a very low PCE of 0.72%, however, device performance increases as the amount of DMDBS incorporated into the BHJ solution increases (Table 2). Even a very modest incorporation of 0.1 wt% DMDBS leads to a doubling in PCE. When 1.0 wt% DMDBS is added, a respectable PCE of 4.15% is achieved due to increases in Jsc and FF.

In order to understand the underlying cause behind this increase in device performance, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM films cast with 1.5 vol% DIO, without and with 1.0 wt% DMDBS, were imaged with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 5). TEM images of films prepared without and with DMDBS both exhibit wire-like p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites reminiscent of those known to form in thermally annealed p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ films.7 In the blend prepared with DMDBS, however, these wire-like crystallites appear smaller and more numerous compared to the blend prepared without DMDBS. So as to obtain more quantitative insight into the structural changes induced by incorporation of the nucleating agent, GIWAXS data was used to calculate the crystalline correlation length (CCL) of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ films cast with 1.5 vol% DIO, without and with DMDBS (Fig. S2†). As the CCL is a measure of the size and/or disorder of a crystallite, it allows for quantification of the spatial extent of ordered p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 regions from X-ray diffraction data.25 In p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ films cast with 1.5 vol% DIO without DMDBS the CCL is 19.8 ± 0.2 nm and for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ films cast with 1.5 vol% and 1.0 wt% DMDBS the CCL decreases to 14.7 ± 0.1 nm.

Both TEM and GIWAXS data then show that DMDBS reduces the size of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ blends when using 1.5 vol% DIO. This is a similar observation to that of Lee, et al. who were able to use electronically active small molecule additives to reduce the grain size of solution-processed small molecule organic FETs during solvent annealing.26,27 In the work presented here, the blend prepared with DMDBS additionally seems to exhibit smaller p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM-rich domains as evidenced by the smaller light and dark regions, respectively, in Fig. 5b compared to Fig. 5a. These smaller domains suggest a concomitant reduction in the length scale of phase separation with the reduction in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallite size as would be expected given the relationship between donor molecule crystallization and phase separation in solution-processed small molecule BHJ OPVs.12 DMDBS therefore reduces the size of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites, and thus the length scale of phase separation, in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices cast with 1.5 vol% DIO. This reduction in phase separation likely leads to improved exciton harvesting at donor–acceptor interfaces, in part explaining the increased Jsc of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices cast with DMDBS compared to devices cast without DMDBS.28,29 Smaller p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites have additionally been shown to correspond to a reduction in voltage-dependent free carrier generation in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices, leading to increased Jsc and FF.30 The smaller donor and acceptor-rich domains and donor crystallites associated with the use of DMDBS therefore likely explain why p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices cast with DMDBS exhibit increased Jsc, FF and, in turn, PCE compared to devices cast without DMDBS.
Conclusions
From the above data it is clear that the commercially available nucleating agent DMDBS can be used to successfully control small molecule donor crystallization, and therefore BHJ morphological development, in solution-processed small molecule BHJ OPV devices. Using DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices, we have shown that DMDBS is capable of accelerating donor molecule crystallization kinetics. The ability to accelerate donor molecule crystallization kinetics has important implications for BHJ OPV device fabrication, where the use of nucleating agents could potentially lead to shorter thermal annealing protocols, thus leading to more economical device manufacturing, or help overcome kinetic barriers to crystallization that prevent the formation of optimized BHJ morphologies.31 Likewise, we have shown that DMDBS can be used to prevent the over-crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ OPV devices fabricated using an excessive amount of DIO. This observation suggests the ability to use DMDBS to create larger processing windows for optimized device fabrication and generally aid in the formulation of BHJ solutions buffered to small variations in solvent additive concentrations that could otherwise lead to undesirable morphologies. This widened processing window may facilitate the commercial scale-up of solution-processed small molecule BHJ OPV devices. The ability to limit donor crystallization may additionally improve long term small molecule BHJ OPV device stability, especially under elevated operating temperatures. We have thus demonstrated a versatile new strategy for the morphological control of solution-processed small molecule BHJ OPV devices. Such morphological control will likely be essential as this promising photovoltaic technology attempts to transition from an academic curiosity to a commercially viable renewable energy technology.
