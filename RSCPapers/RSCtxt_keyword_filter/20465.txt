    , Accepted 21st September 2017First published on 21st September 2017AbstractA novel small-molecule, B2F, which is based on benzobis(thiadiazole), was designed and synthesized as an electron extraction material for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Because of the high electron affinity of the benzobis(thiadiazole) unit and the Pb–S bonding, B2F exhibited good adhesion on the perovskite surface and an efficient photoluminescence quenching to CH3NH3PbI3. The simple device with B2F as the solution-processing electron extraction layer without any extra interface layer exhibited an optimal power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.35%. The B2F-based device can be further improved by the addition of C60/BCP as efficient electron transport and hole-blocking layers to enhance electron transport and prevent carrier leakage. A champion PCE of 17.18% was achieved with an open-circuit voltage of 1.052 V, a short-circuit current density of 20.63 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 79.15%. In summary, we developed an efficient electron extraction material for PSCs, which represents a new building block for the design and development of highly efficient electron transport materials for PSCs in the future.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials have attracted great attention because of their inherent advantages for photovoltaic applications, such as broad optical absorbance, low-temperature solution processability, ambipolar transport properties, long electron–hole diffusion lengths (100 nm and 1 μm for triiodide and mixed trihalide perovskites, respectively) and facile tuning of band gaps by varying their compositions.1–3 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have piqued the attention of researchers and opened up a new vista in the photovoltaic field. The adoption of new organic cations, deposition techniques and interface materials has improved the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from 3% to over 20%.4–11 Perovskites can be adopted in various types of PSCs, including the n–i–p type based on meso-porous metal oxide scaffolds and the p–i–n planar-heterojunction type.12,13 The latter type has recently attracted increasing attention owing to the relatively simple device manufacturing process and the potential for the devices to be deposited at low temperature. Correspondingly, in the p–i–n type structure, the so-called inverted type, a hole transport layer (HTL), such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and an electron transport layer (ETL), such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), are introduced at the transparent electrode/perovskite and perovskite/metal interfaces, respectively, altering the device polarity compared to the n–i–p polarity.14–16 To increase the PCE, it is essential to precisely manipulate carriers along the entire pathway from the absorber to both electrodes. Interfacial materials were found to be of critical importance for charge collection and extraction in PSCs.
Compared with the efforts dedicated to the development of HTLs to improve the hole collection at the anode,17 the development of ETLs is lacking.18 For n–i–p structure devices, metal oxides such as TiO2,19 ZnO,20 SnO221 and recently reported BaSnO322 were developed to optimize the device performance. Correspondingly, in those inverted type PSCs, the fullerene and its derivatives such as PCBM and indene–C60 bisadducts (ICBAs)23 or their combinations with other organic molecules24,25 have been investigated widely. Despite the attractive properties offered by fullerenes, their high cost and poor ambient stability and the difficulty in tuning the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level are still disadvantageous,26,27 features that limit their further application in PSCs based on various band gap perovskite semiconductors because the LUMO of the ETL must be appropriately adjusted to minimize the loss of voltage output in solar cells. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient non-fullerene organic ETL materials with tunable energy levels and comparable properties to fullerenes for application in PSCs.
A perfect ETL for PSCs should fulfill several requirements, such as a good electron transport ability, matched energy levels with the perovskite film and ohmic contact with the electrodes. Although the performances of inverted PSCs with non-fullerene organic ETLs have been enormously improved,28–30 the choice of the molecular building unit is still limited. To date, molecular units utilized for efficient ETLs in inverted PSCs have been restricted to the following: naphthalene imide,28,31 perylene diimide32,33 and hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA).29,30 Those molecular units with fused aromatic rings could provide high electron affinity, a rigid planar core and high electron mobility that are matched to the LUMO energy level of the perovskite. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop new molecular units to design efficient ETL materials.
The benzobis(thiadiazole) unit with a hypervalent sulfur atom is a strong electron acceptor34,35 that has been used as an electron acceptor in low band-gap donor–acceptor copolymers,36,37 and its high mobility has been verified by its use in organic field-effect transistors.38,39 In consideration of the deep LUMO energy level of benzobis(thiadiazole) derivatives, we suggested that the benzobis(thiadiazole) unit may be beneficial to electron extraction in PSCs. Compared with conjugated polymers, small molecules can use simpler synthetic procedures and easier purification steps. The mono-disperse properties of small molecules with specific chemical structures will be beneficial to good reproducibility in device fabrication. In this work, we synthesized a benzobis(thiadiazole)-based small molecule called B2F and first applied such a structure as an effective electron extraction material in inverted PSCs. The device based on a single B2F layer exhibited a PCE of 12.35%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.927 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.05 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 69.90%. Further improvement of PCE can be achieved by using B2F as an interlayer for the perovskite and C60/BCP as electron transporting and hole-blocking layers to enhance the electron extraction and prevent carrier leakage. A champion PCE of 17.18% was achieved with a VOC of 1.052 V, a JSC of 20.63 mA cm−2 and an FF of 79.15%. The good performance could be attributed to the well matched energy level of B2F with the perovskite. Our work presented a new organic unit for the development of highly efficient electron transport materials for PSCs.

Device fabrication
Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially and then treated with plasma for 15 min. The hole transport layer P3CT-Na40 was formed on ITO substrates by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s followed by annealing at 140 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, a CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution (1.4 M in DMF:DMSO mixed solution with a v/v of 4:1) was deposited onto the substrates in a glove box at 5000 rpm for 30 s with CB treatment at 8 s after the start-up. Next, the film was annealed on a hot plate at 60 °C for 1 min and at 80 °C for 2 min. B2F solutions in chlorobenzene were then spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm. C60 and BCP were evaporated at a rate of approximately 1 Å s−1 under high vacuum (∼5 × 10−4 Pa). Finally, a 100 nm thick silver electrode was deposited on the ETL through a shadow mask under vacuum (∼1 × 10−4 Pa). The shadow mask used during thermal evaporation defined the active area of 6 mm2. The ZnO solution used in the electron-only device was synthesized according to the literature.41
Film and device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curve measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter with an Oriel So13A solar simulator under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in a glove box. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was performed using a Newport quantum efficiency measurement system (ORIEL IQE 200TM) combined with a lock-in amplifier and a 150 W xenon lamp in an ambient atmosphere. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard Si/Ge solar cell. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed using a Shimadzu Spectrometer (AXIS ULTRA DLD) with a HeI (21.2 eV) discharge lamp. A Horiba (FL3-111) spectrometer recorded the steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension 3100V, Veeco, tapping mode) were applied to observe the film surface morphology. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer.
Results and discussion
Herein, we designed and synthesized a small organic molecule, B2F, as an effective electron extraction material in PSCs. Its chemical structure and synthetic procedures are shown in Scheme 1. B2F consists of a benzobis(thiadiazole) unit and two fluorene end-capping units. The former block is a strong electron acceptor that can effectively lower the LUMO energy level to guarantee the electron extraction from the perovskite to B2F. The latter unit can adjust the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, solubility and film morphology. The appropriate alky chain on the fluorene unit will improve the material's solubility in non-polar solvents such as chlorobenzene, which is commonly used as the solvent to deposit a hole or electron transport layer onto a perovskite film. Fig. 1a shows the UV-vis absorptions of B2F in solution and in the film state. Both of the absorption spectra exhibited two distinctive peaks. Peaks from 300 to 400 nm are attributed to the π–π* transition and the possible n–π* transition of the conjugated aromatic segments, and those at longer wavelengths from 500 to 750 nm are attributed to the intra-molecular charge transfer transitions. The film absorption spectrum is redshifted compared to the solution absorption spectrum originating from the molecule aggregation. The absorption edge of the B2F film reaches approximately 751 nm, from which the optical band gap is estimated to be 1.65 eV. UPS was conducted to examine the energy level of B2F as shown in Fig. 1b. By incorporating the film optical band gap, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are calculated to be 5.67 eV and 4.02 eV. The electrochemical CV can also be adopted to estimate the energy level of a material. The HOMO and LUMO level values estimated from CV are similar to those of UPS (Fig. S1, ESI†). The LUMO energy level of B2F of approximately 4.0 eV is almost aligned with that of CH3NH3PbI3 (3.9 eV),42 suggesting possible favorable electron extraction properties at the CH3NH3PbI3/B2F interface. In addition, the HOMO energy level of B2F (5.67 eV) is deeper than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (5.4 eV) and therefore can prevent holes from leaking towards the cathode.

To evaluate the effects of processing interface materials on top of the perovskite semiconductor, perovskite films with and without the B2F layer or C60/BCP layers were investigated using PL spectra. After coming into contact with charge transport layers, perovskite films usually show obvious PL quenching characteristics due to efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to the charge transport layer. As we can see from the spectra in Fig. 2a, the deposition of a 3 nm thick B2F layer quenched 52% of the PL intensity. By increasing the B2F thickness to 26 nm, a PL intensity quenching of 64% was observed. For the C60/BCP layers evaporated on a perovskite film, a high PL quenching of 80% was achieved, higher than that of the B2F layer. After depositing the B2F/C60/BCP layers on the perovskite, the PL intensity showed a 92% decrease, suggesting a better electron extraction ability than both the B2F layer and the C60/BCP layers. From the result of the PL spectra, we speculate that the B2F/C60/BCP based device would show a better performance compared with B2F based PSCs. We also attempted to confirm the possible interaction between the perovskite and B2F by examining the FT-IR spectra. In Fig. S3a (ESI†), an appearance of an absorption peak at 428 cm−1 was observed that was assigned to the Pb–S vibration.43,44 Two types of sulfur exist in B2F, S–N (829 cm−1) and SN (865 cm−1);45 an intensity change was observed at both 829 cm−1 and 865 cm−1, suggesting a potential interaction between the perovskite and B2F. The improved contact interaction of B2F on the perovskite will also contribute to the electron extraction from the perovskite to B2F.

As electron mobility is an important parameter to evaluate the properties of an electron dominant material, we performed the electron mobility measurement of B2F by adopting a space charge-limited current (SCLC) method.46Fig. 2b depicts the J–V curve of the electron-only device with an ITO/ZnO/B2F/Ca/Al structure. We can see that the device was well characterized using the SCLC model, the logJ–logV slopes of the ohmic conduction and the SCLC conduction were 1 and 2,47 respectively. By linear fitting the J1/2–V curve in the SCLC conduction region, an electron mobility of 4.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained, see Fig. S4 (ESI†). Unfortunately, this value is approximately one to two orders of magnitude lower than the electron mobility of PCBM in PSCs, which usually shows a value on the order of 10−3 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.30 This relatively low electron mobility could be ascribed to insufficient molecular stacking, resulting in the reduced planarity of the B2F molecular structure compared with recently reported small molecule ETL materials, e.g., HATNASOC7-Cs,30 HATNT29 and TDTP.48 Therefore, the lack of electron mobility could be the main reason for the lower PL quenching of B2F compared with the C60/BCP layers.
Although B2F showed moderate electron mobility compared with PCBM, the matched energy level of B2F and the perovskite and their potential interaction would be beneficial to the performance in PSCs. To verify the effectiveness of B2F as an ETL, devices with an ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/B2F/Ag configuration were fabricated. Here, ITO and Ag act as an anode and a cathode, respectively, and P3CT-Na and B2F act as hole and electron transport layers, respectively. The corresponding energy band diagram is depicted in Fig. 1d. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra with or without the B2F layer. The deposition of the B2F layer introduced a slightly increased absorption in the <480 nm and 560–730 nm wavelength ranges, which should stem from the absorption of B2F (Fig. 1a). The photovoltaic performances of the perovskite solar cells with varying B2F film thicknesses were evaluated. Fig. 3b exhibits the J–V characteristics of the solar cells under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, and Table 1 lists the detailed performance parameters. As we can see, the device performances significantly depend on the thicknesses of the B2F films. When the B2F film is thin, the device shows a leakage current behavior, leading to a low VOC and poor JSC. The optimal B2F thickness is approximately 26 nm, corresponding to a VOC of 0.927 V, a JSC of 19.05 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.90%, leading to a device efficiency of 12.35%. Further increasing the thickness of B2F will continue to increase the VOC from 0.855 V (20 nm) to 0.974 V (39 nm), suggesting a better film coverage on the perovskite, as will be discussed later. The JSC values present an obvious decrease at thicknesses higher than 26 nm, indicating an increased impediment for electron extraction from the perovskite to the cathode. The decreasing JSC with the increasing B2F thickness agreed well with the relatively low mobility of B2F. The optimal performance of B2F-based PSCs showed a competitive PCE with other non-fullerene organic electron transport materials with a similar device configuration and film deposition process.33,48,49

The EQE spectrum of the optimal device is presented in Fig. 3c; the integrated photocurrent of the device is 17.83 mA cm−2, agreed well (approximately 6% error) with the JSC value from the J–V curve, which confirmed the accuracy of our reported PCE value. Further study of the time-dependent power output of the champion device by monitoring the PCE under a constant voltage bias at the maximum power point was also performed, as shown in Fig. 3d. The optimal device demonstrated a stable power output of 11.82% over 500 s, which could rule out the problem of the variation in efficiency induced by light soaking observed in some PSCs.50
The ETL film morphology on a perovskite layer plays an important role in the device performance of inverted type PSCs. As seen in Fig. 4a, the perovskite film was a well crystallized and pin-hole free film, with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 9.72 nm. By depositing various B2F layers on it, the film roughness decreased gradually with increasing B2F thickness, as seen in Fig. 4b–f. When the B2F thickness is 3 nm, the perovskite crystal can still be clearly observed, i.e., a low coverage of the perovskite film. For thicknesses from 20 to 40 nm (Fig. 4c–e), the B2F layer was not able to cover the perovskite film completely. When the film thickness was approximately 60 nm, the RMS roughness was further decreased to below 1 nm, i.e., the perovskite film was fully covered. The incomplete B2F coverage caused by the perovskite–cathode contact could result in the formation of AgI and induce more defects in the perovskite/B2F interface. Consequently, the efficiency of the device suffers from the deteriorated perovskite film, poor electron extraction, and generation of a AgI barrier.51 This should also be a significant reason for the relatively lower JSC of the B2F device than that of the PCBM based device that we fabricated before.52 In brief, as we discussed in the introduction section, an ideal electron transport material for perovskite should present a matched energy level, good interface contact with perovskite, and high electron mobility. To increase the mobility of our electron extraction material to get a full coverage of the perovskite film, further improvement could proceed by chemical doping of B2F53 or extending the planarity of benzobis(thiadiazole).

To increase the electron transport of B2F extraction interlayer based devices, we fabricated an ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/B2F/C60 (20 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag device structure, as shown in Fig. 1c. Here, C60 is applied as the electron transport layer and hole blocking layer for its high HOMO energy level (Fig. 1d). BCP acts as a cathode modification layer for C60.54 By tuning the thickness of the B2F interlayer, an optimized efficiency can be achieved, as shown in Fig. 5a and summarized in Table 2. When there was no B2F interface layer, a PCE of 15.35%, with a VOC of 1.028 V, a JSC of 19.58 mA cm−2, and an FF of 76.30% can be achieved. With approximately 3 nm of the B2F interlayer deposited in between the perovskite and C60, a 12% increase of PCE was observed, which was 17.18% with a VOC of 1.052 V, a JSC of 20.63 mA cm−2 and an FF of 79.15%. All the performance parameters were improved after B2F interlayer modification. These results were consistent with the PL spectra that indicated the B2F/C60/BCP layers were more efficient electron extraction layers than the B2F and C60/BCP layers. Because the photocurrent hysteresis was considered to be a major issue in accurate characterization of device efficiency, we measured the typical J–V curves for B2F only, C60/BCP and B2F/C60/BCP based PSCs with different scan directions (reverse and forward). As depicted in Fig. 5b and summarized in Table S2 (ESI†), the B2F/C60/BCP based device exhibited a negligible hysteresis in the J–V curves, where the forward and reverse scanning directions yielded PCE values of 17.18% and 16.96%, respectively (a difference of 1.2%). In contrast, hysteresis is more pronounced for the B2F only and C60/BCP based devices, with a difference in PCE values between forward and reverse scans of 11% and 6%, respectively.

Fig. 5c shows the EQE spectrum of the champion device, which presented a spectral response over a wide wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm. The integrated current density derived from the EQE spectrum is 19.57 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with our measured result of 20.63 mA cm−2. The time-dependent power outputs of the PSCs with or without the B2F layer were also obtained under their maximum power points, as shown in Fig. 3d. Both of the devices showed stable power output over 500 s. The device with a B2F interlayer exhibited a PCE of 16.95%, and the device without a B2F interlayer showed a PCE only 15.26%, indicating efficient interface modification by the B2F interlayer.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a benzobis(thiadiazole) derivative, B2F, as a novel electron extraction material for use in inverted planar hetero-junction PSCs. The high LUMO energy level derived from the benzobis(thiadiazole) unit makes B2F suitable for electron extraction from the perovskite. In addition, the potential interaction of Pb–S between B2F and the perovskite could favor contact between them. The optimized device with B2F as an electron extraction layer showed a PCE of over 12%. Considering the electron mobility of B2F is on the order of 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, further improvement of the PCE can be achieved in B2F interlayer based PSCs by adding C60/BCP layers to increase the electron transport efficiency and block current leakage more effectively. A champion PCE of 17.18% was achieved with a VOC of 1.052 V, a JSC of 20.63 mA cm−2 and an FF of 79.15%. In summary, we believe that benzobis(thiadiazole) is a promising building block for the design and construction of efficient electron transport materials for PSCs. To enhance the device efficiency, further efforts to increase the mobility could be made through chemical doping of B2F or molecular design to expand the planarity or lengthen the conjugated chain segment of the molecule.
