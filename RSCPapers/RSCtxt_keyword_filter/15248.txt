    , Accepted 1st December 2021First published on 8th December 2021AbstractThe defects of a perovskite film were first passivated by two dimensional ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, the non-radiation recombination at interfaces was suppressed and the contact of the perovskite film with water vapour in the air was avoided, resulting in a high efficiency of 20.55%.
In the past few decades, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased significantly from 3.8% to 25.5%,1,2 which has attracted tremendous attention. However, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites can be decomposed easily in an atmosphere of water vapor and oxygen,3 and the fabrication of stable PSCs is still a top priority. On the other hand, the perovskite film exhibits a polycrystalline composition,4 which has bulk defects and interface defects, the latter is far more than the former, and the interface defects usually exist at grain boundaries.5,6 In general, the formation of interface defects is attributed to the lack of I− ions and A-site cations (CH3NH3+ or HC(NH2)2+), which could cause the decomposition of the perovskite film and serious non-radiation recombination of the PSC device.7 To reduce defects in the perovskite film, many strategies including interface engineering, additive engineering, anti-solvent engineering, and process preparation optimization have been developed.8–11
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely used to improve the properties of PSCs. Han et al. developed a solution-processing strategy for stabilizing the perovskite film, and a heterostructure of a chlorinated graphene oxide (Cl-GO) layer was formed via strong chemical bonds on the surface of perovskite films, resulting in an enhancement of the hole extraction ability, and an efficiency of 21% was achieved.12 Xie et al. used g-C3N4 to modify the electronic transport layer of mesoporous TiO2, which effectively enhanced the charge transport ability, and the champion device exhibited an efficiency of 20.5%; in particular, the short circuit current density (JSC) was improved significantly from 22.83·mA cm−2 to 24.44 mA cm−2.13 Yan et al. utilized few-layer MoS2 flakes as inverted hole transport materials (HTMs), and a perovskite film was formed on the MoS2 flakes in the van der Waals epitaxial growth, leading to a highly oriented perovskite film with a large grain size and a low defect density, and a PCE of 20.55% was achieved.14 Ma et al. used Ti3C2Tx MXene as an additive in the perovskite absorber layer, and found that MXene with excellent electrical properties can favor the charge transfer of PSCs, and the termination groups of Ti3C2Tx retarded the crystallization rate, and increased the crystal size of the perovskite film.15 Obviously, introduction of 2D materials in PSCs can improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Unfortunately, studies dealing with the surface passivation of the perovskite film are rare, and the relationships between 2D materials and the photovoltaic properties need to be explored in detail.
In this work, ZnIn2S4, a typical 2D material, was first applied to passivate the defects of a perovskite film. Owing to a large number of dangling bonds and lone-electron pairs on the surface of ZIS nanosheets,16 the defects of the surface and grain boundaries in the perovskite film have been passivated efficiently. As a result, the best PCE of 20.55% has been achieved; in particular, the open current voltage (VOC) was increased significantly from 1.017 V to 1.068 V. Moreover, the PCE of the unpackaged device can remain at more than 96% of the initial efficiency after 60 days in air with RH = 15 ± 5% humidity.

Fig. 1a shows the crystal structure of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS), and the metal atomic layers are surrounded by the sulfur atomic layers. Thus, there are a large number of lone-electron pairs and dangling bonds of S atoms on the surface of ZIS. Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of ZIS, and the peaks are in good agreement with the pervious report (JCPDS#65-2023). As depicted in Fig. 1c and d, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ZIS show a microsphere morphology, which was composed of thin nanosheets, and also confirmed by TEM observation (Fig. 2e). The high-solution TEM image in Fig. 1f indicates that the lattice fringe was found to be approximately 0.325 nm, corresponding to the (102) plane of ZIS, which was in agreement with the related selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1g). The elemental mapping images of ZIS (Fig. 1h) show that Zn, In and S elements were well distributed in the entire microsphere. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum of ZIS in Fig. S1 (ESI†) displays that the ratio of the Zn, In, and S atomic fraction was approximately 1:2:4.

As shown in Fig. 2a, the structure of the PSC device is FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, in which ZIS nanosheets were introduced into the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film. To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of PSCs, a series of cells with different concentrations of ZIS have been investigated under AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the photovoltaic parameters for twenty devices are summarized in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It can be seen that the highest value of VOC, FF and PCE has been achieved when 0.02 mg mL−1 of ZIS was used. Moreover, the J–V curves of the champion devices without and with ZIS are displayed in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was enhanced significantly when ZIS nanosheets were introduced into the surface of the perovskite film, exhibiting a PCE of 20.55% with a VOC of 1.068 V, a JSC of 24.42 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.788. In contrast, the control device only exhibited a PCE of 18.16% with a VOC of 1.017 V, a JSC of 23.96 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.745. Besides, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the champion devices without and with ZIS were measured (Fig. 2c), and their integrated currents were 23.17 mA cm−2 and 24.14 mA cm−2, respectively, which were in good agreement with the JSC value obtained from J–V characterization. It can also be detected that the device with ZIS has a higher external quantum efficiency than the control device, indicating that the light-absorbing ability of the device has been increased when ZIS nanosheets were introduced into PSCs. To exclude the effects of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the anti-solvent on the performance of PSCs, DMF and chlorobenzene (CB) were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:99 and then used as an anti-solvent (DMF/CB) in PSC devices. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the PCE of the champion device was found to be 17.85% (JSC = 23.89 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.014 V and FF = 0.737), which was close to the efficiency of the device with chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent. Obviously, the presence of DMF in the anti-solvent has little effect on the photovoltaic properties of the device, indicating that ZIS is the key factor for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
UV-vis spectrophotometry was used to measure the absorbance of the perovskite films, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The absorbance intensity was increased for the perovskite film with ZIS, indicating that the modification with ZIS is beneficial for the enhancement of JSC.
The XRD patterns of perovskite films with and without ZIS modification are shown in Fig. 2d. It is noted that the intensity of the (100) diffraction peak was increased significantly after the perovskite film was modified by ZIS, indicating that the crystal plane orientation and the crystal quality of the perovskite film are higher, which is beneficial for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In addition, 2θ at 12.8° is a characteristic diffraction peak of lead iodide, which was decreased for the perovskite film modified by ZIS, indicating that the content of lead iodide on the surface of the perovskite film was reduced.
To examine the interaction between the ZIS nanosheets and perovskite film, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were probed to identify Pb and S atoms in the perovskite film before and after modification with ZIS nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 2e, the peaks of Pb0 were located at 141.8 eV and 136.9 eV. The existence of Pb0 could be due to the lack of I− ions,17 which would cause non-radiative recombination during the carrier migration process, resulting in a decrease of the efficiency and stability of devices. The intensity of the Pb0 peaks for the perovskite film modified by ZIS nanosheets was lower than that of the control sample, indicating that the Pb0 defects in the perovskite film were reduced, resulting in the increase of the performance of the devices. The Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 signals of the control film were located at 143.6 eV and 138.8 eV, respectively, and their position did not shift after the perovskite film was modified by ZIS nanosheets. The ZIS powder in the XPS spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†) shows that S 2p peaks were located at 162.6 eV and 161.4 eV, while the signals of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 were detected at 162.4 eV and 160.9 eV, respectively, for the ZIS modified perovskite film, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Compared with the ZIS powder in the XPS spectra, the peaks of S 2p for the ZIS modified perovskite film were shifted to a lower binding energy, indicating that there is a coordination effect between the S and Pb atoms, which further confirmed that ZIS nanosheets can passivate Pb defects, which were caused by the absence of I− ions and A-site cations.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to observe the perovskite films before and after modification with ZIS. As presented in Fig. 3a and b, the perovskite films are flat and dense, the grain size of the pristine perovskite was found to be about 50–550 nm, the average size of the grains was 240 nm, and the statistical distribution graphs are shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). It can be seen from Fig. 3b that the grain size of the perovskite modified by ZIS was found to be 50–700 nm and the average grain size was about 315 nm (Fig. S7b, ESI†), indicating that the grain boundaries of the perovskite film have been reduced after modification with ZIS. In addition, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images in Fig. S8 (ESI†) indicate that Zn, In and S elements were evenly distributed on the surface of the perovskite film with ZIS passivation. Fig. 3c and d show the cross-view SEM images of perovskite films with and without ZIS modification, and exhibited the same thickness of the film (about 500 nm). The crystal grains of the perovskite film passivated by ZIS were penetrated and the entire active layer and grain boundaries were unclear, while only small grains were formed and more grain boundaries were presented for the control sample. As is well known, non-radiative recombination of carriers often takes place in the grain boundaries of the perovskite film, and few grain boundaries are required for fabricating highly efficient PSCs.18 Therefore, the perovskite film modified by ZIS can reduce defects and enhance the photovoltaic properties of PSCs. As depicted in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show that the interface of the perovskite film with ZIS passivation has a lower roughness, which is beneficial for the transport of carriers between the perovskite layer and HTM layer.

Steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) characterization were carried out for two samples on a glass substrate. Fig. S10a (ESI†) shows the fluorescence spectra of two samples; their peak positions are at 783 nm, and the intensity of the PL peak was increased significantly after the perovskite film was modified by ZIS. It is noted that PL emission has been enhanced for the perovskite film with ZIS nanosheets, suggesting that the ZIS modified perovskite film has a higher crystal quality with a low defect density, and the non-radiative recombination could be suppressed.19 Fig. S10b (ESI†) shows the TRPL decay curves for two perovskite films, and Table S2 (ESI†) lists the corresponding carrier lifetime components extracted by fitting the curves with a biexponential function. The average lifetime is related to the recombination of carriers in perovskite films, and was calculated to be 325 ns and 756 ns without and with ZIS modification, respectively. The enhancement of the average lifetime can be attributed to reduced trap-assisted recombination at defect sites, which is beneficial to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells.20,21 Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under light and dark conditions with a negative bias was explored to investigate the interfacial carrier transmission and recombination process in the PSCs. As shown in Fig. S11b (ESI†), the semicircle in the low frequency range under light conditions was related to the carrier transmission resistance (Rct), and the decreased Rct implies that the ability for extracting and transporting carriers from the perovskite layer to the carrier transport layer has been enhanced. Under dark conditions (Fig. S11a, ESI†), the semicircle in the low frequency region was related to the recombination resistance (Rrec) of the perovskite film, and the increased Rrec value implies that the charge recombination at the interfaces could be suppressed. Under two measurement conditions, the high frequency characteristic was series resistance (Rs).22 The EIS data are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†); the Rct and Rrec values for the pristine device were 26.92 Ω and 35987 Ω, respectively, while the Rct and Rrec values for the cell modified by ZIS nanosheets were 11.34 Ω and 52948 Ω, respectively, indicating that the device has a faster rate of carrier transport and less carrier recombination after the passivation of the ZIS nanosheets, which is related to the improvement of JSC and VOC.
The space charge limited current (SCLC) is widely used to measure the trap states density of materials.23,24 In Fig. S12 (ESI†), the I–V curves of electron-only devices (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au) were obtained under dark conditions and included an Ohmic regime, a trap-filled limited regime (TFL), and a trap-free space charge limited current regime.25 After calculation, the Ntrap values of perovskite films without and with ZIS modification are 1.05 × 1016 cm−3 and 6.57 × 1015 cm−3, respectively, indicating that the perovskite film has fewer defects after modification with ZIS, resulting in the improvement of VOC.
The steady-state power point output of devices with and without the perovskite film passivated by ZIS has also been measured under a positive bias at the maximum power point, as shown in Fig. S13a (ESI†). The cell composed of the perovskite film with ZIS passivation exhibited a steady-state PCE of 19.77% and the current density was stabilized at 21.99 mA cm−2 with a bias of 0.90 V. In contrast, the steady-state PCE of the control device decreased from 17.76% to 13.86% at a bias of 0.84 V after 100 s. Obviously, the former exhibited better stability than the latter. To further investigate the effects of ZIS modification on the stability of PSCs, the devices have been carried out without encapsulation in air with 15 ± 5% humidity for 60 days. As shown in Fig. 13b (ESI†), the PCE of the control device was decreased by 35.5% of its initial value, while the device composed of the perovskite film passivated by ZIS can maintain about 96% of its initial value. On the other hand, the stability of cells is another key issue for the practical application of PSCs, while the effect of the moisture resistance on the stability of the perovskite film has been investigated in several ways. Accordingly, the contact angle of water on the surface of the perovskite film has been revealed, and the results are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). The contact angle of water on the surface of the perovskite film was increased from 66.6° to 86.9° after modification with ZIS nanosheets, which might be attributed to the fact that the S atomic layer in 2D structural ZIS can effectively isolate the contact of the perovskite film with water, so the decomposition of the perovskite film was decreased and the durability of the PSCs was improved.
In summary, 2D structural ZIS nanosheets were successfully synthesized and utilized to modify the surface and grain boundaries of a perovskite film, and a strong coordination with Pb can be formed by a large number lone-electron pairs and dangling bonds of S on the surface of ZIS, resulting in the decrease of the Pb defects which were caused by the lack of I− ions and A-site cations, and the non-radiation recombination at the interfaces of the perovskite film has also been suppressed efficiently. A cell composed of the perovskite film with ZIS passivation exhibited an efficiency of 20.55%. In air with RH = 15 ± 5% humidity, the PCE of the unpackaged device can maintain more than 96% of the initial efficiency after 60 days, showing an excellent stability. This might be ascribed to the fact that 2D structural ZIS nanosheets on the surface of the perovskite film could avoid the contact of the perovskite film with water in the air, preventing the decomposition of the perovskite. Thus, the present work provides a new strategy of defect passivation by 2D materials to fabricate highly efficient and stable PSCs in the future.
