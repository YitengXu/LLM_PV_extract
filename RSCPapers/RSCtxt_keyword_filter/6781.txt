    , Accepted 1st July 2014First published on 1st July 2014AbstractUsing density functional theory calculations, the mechanism of insulator-to-metal transition of S-doped Si has been systematically investigated. The calculated crystal structure indicates that the gentle lattice distortion is caused by sulfur doping, and this doping effect is gradually weakened with the increase of sulfur concentration. Two distinct impurity energy levels in the band gap are induced by sulfur doping, and their position and width are linearly varying along with the increase of sulfur concentration. Owing to the overlap and dispersion of these impurity energy levels, the insulator-to-metal transition occurs at the sulfur concentration of 2.095 × 1020 cm−3, which is consistent with the experimental measurement. Moreover, the defect states related with sulfur doping show delocalization features and are more outstanding at the higher sulfur concentration. The calculated results suggest that S-hyperdoped Si is a suitable candidate for intermediate band solar cells.
1. Introduction
Because the two global issues, energy shortage and environmental pollution, are becoming more and more serious, the utilization and development of renewable energy have been attracting ever greater attention. Solar energy reaching the earth's surface provides energy supply potential surpassing the power consumption of our civilization by three orders of magnitude.1 To convert solar energy to electrical energy, high-efficient and low-cost solar cells are of pressing need and great significance. Furthermore, to achieve high sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency, solar cells require carefully selected types of absorbing materials and sophisticated control of their qualities. Currently industrialization is still dominated by crystal silicon-based solar cells and its market share is higher than 80%. However, as the first generation solar cells, their lab conversion efficiency is approximately 24.7%, which is very close to the theoretical limit efficiency.2 Although the second generation solar cells (thin film solar cells) can partially solve the problem of high production cost, their conversion efficiency cannot be compared with that of the first generation solar cells. In order to further improve the conversion efficiency, researchers have studied solar cell efficiency limits, energy loss mechanisms and put forward the concept of the third generation solar cell. These are characterized by the use of multi-gap, improved efficiency of single photon use, photon energy redistribution, and other measures to improve the conversion efficiency.3,4
In the third generation, the intermediate band solar cells could significantly utilize lower energy photons, thereby increasing the photocurrent without reducing open circuit voltage and surpassing the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit for single-gap materials.5 Recently, different research groups found that silicon material can achieve the intermediate band through hyperdoping with various impurities. Kim et al. found strong sub-bandgap infrared absorption in silicon supersaturated with sulfur by ion implantation and achieved optical absorption coefficients over the range of 1200–2500 nm in uniformly high variations of ∼2.5 × 104 cm−1.6 Antolín et al. measured the carrier lifetime of Si wafers doped with Ti in the 1020–1021 cm−3 concentration ranges, showing an increase in the lifetime. This finding implies that the conditions necessary to produce successful intermediate band solar cells on semiconductor materials doped with deep level impurities can be achieved.7 Other impurities, such as chalcogen (S, Se, and Te),8–12 transition metals,13,14 have been proven to have the similar doping effects. In particular, Winkler et al. observed an insulator-to-metal transition in crystalline silicon doped with sulfur in non-equilibrium concentrations using ion implantation.15 The transition from insulating to metallic conduction occurs at a sulfur concentration between 1.8 and 4.3 × 1020 cm−3, and this transition is driven by a deep-level impurity. Owing to the delocalization of these deep states, S-hyperdoped Si is suitable for the intermediate band gap solar cells.
In spite of extensive investigation of the properties of Si-based intermediate band gap materials, the origins of these phenomena have not been studied in-depth, especially the nature of the insulator-to-metal transition. Furthermore, the distribution of defect states within the bandgap is still not clearly defined. So, it is necessary to understand deeper the nature of sulfur doping for crystalline silicon. In order to solve these problems, and motivated by aforementioned novel observations, we systematically studied the doping effects of sulfur on the crystal structure and electronic properties of crystalline silicon in this work, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that there are two impurity energy levels related to sulfur impurity in the bandgap of silicon, and their position and width linearly vary along with the increase of sulfur concentration. Due to the shifting and overlapping of these two impurity energy levels, the insulator-to-metal transition occurs at the sulfur concentration of 2.095 × 1020 cm−3, which is consistent with the experimental measurement. These findings are helpful to understand previous experimental observations, and useful to develop the novel intermediate band solar cells.
2. Calculation methods
Various sizes of supercell models were present, having different sulfur concentration of S-doped Si in the present work. In these supercells, one Si atom was replaced by one sulfur atom, to construct the substituted doping models. For example, in the case of 2 × 2 × 2 supercell model, one Si atom was replaced by one S atom, so, the sulfur concentration is about 1.56% (atomic fraction, equal to 7.804 × 1020 cm−3). Beginning with 2 × 2 × 2 supercell, ten supercells were constructed, including 2 × 2 × 2 supercell, 2 × 2 × 3 supercell, …, and 4 × 4 × 4 supercell. In the case of 4 × 4 × 4 supercell, the total number of atoms reached 512, and the corresponding sulfur concentration is about 0.305% (atomic fraction, equal to 0.976 × 1020 cm−3), which was comparable to that used in the experiments.15 This approach works on the premise that the sulfur impurities have uniform distribution in the silicon host, which is commonly accepted in standard DFT calculations.16,17 Of course, the different distances between S doping atoms (namely, S impurities occupying different relative lattice sites) may lead to different atomic interactions between S impurities. This issue is beyond the scope of this article, and the related work is being performed in our research group.
In the present work, all the calculations were carried out by using the periodic density functional theory package of Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) codes.18 CASTEP is a state-of-the-art quantum mechanics-based program designed specifically for solid-state materials science. The core electrons (Si:[Ne], S:[He]) were treated with the ultrasoft pseudopotential. The exchange–correlation effects of valence electrons (Si: 3s23p2, S: 3s23p4) were described by the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof for solid (PBEsol) of generalized gradient approximation (GGA).19 In order to obtain accurate electronic structure, the method of GGA + U was adopted to overcome the well-known shortcoming of GGA.20 The Hubbard model is one of the most successful models to describe the correlated electrons in solids. To construct and appropriated functional the GGA + U approach subdivides charge density into two subsystems: delocalized and localized. The former remains described by its charge density, while for the latter a site diagonal charge density matrix is introduced. In the present work, the U value of Si-p orbital was set as follows: Ueff = U − J = 9.57 eV, which is obtained by comparing the calculated and measured band gap of crystal Si. The Monkhorst–Pack scheme k-points grid sampling was set as 2 × 2 × 2 for the irreducible Brillouin zone. A 120 × 120 × 120 mesh was used for fast Fourier transformation. An energy cutoff of 250 eV was used for expanding the Kohn–Sham wave functions. The minimization algorithm was chosen the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) scheme.21 Its convergence criteria were set as follows: the force on the atoms were less than 0.01 eV Å−1, the stress on the atoms were less than 0.02 GPa, the atomic displacement was less than 5 × 10−4 Å, and the energy change per atom was less than 5 × 10−6 eV. Based on the optimized crystal structure, the electronic structure and the optical properties were then calculated.
Using the above calculation method, we first optimized the bulk crystal structure of crystalline silicon and obtained the following lattice constants: a = b = c = 5.4733 Å. This calculation results is well consistent with the experimental measurements: a = b = c = 5.4305 Å.22 These calculated results indicate that the calculation models and method in the present work are reasonable.
3. Results and discussions
Owing to the difference in ionic radius and electronegativity, sulfur impurities will cause lattice distortion of silicon host. As shown in Table 1, the bond length of Si–S in S-doped Si models, ∼2.45 Å, is larger than the bond length of Si–Si in pure Si model, 2.37 Å. Because of the larger Si–S bond, the Si–Si bond around the sulfur impurity will be squeezed, resulting in the slight decrease in the bond length of Si–Si in S-doped Si models, ∼2.36 Å. The tendency of lattice distortion with sulfur concentration is plotted in Fig. 1. After sulfur doping, the average lattice constants are not obvious. For all S-doped Si models, the average deviations of lattice constant are not larger than −0.018 Å, and the corresponding deviations of cell volume are not larger than −0.38 Å3, suggesting that the lattice distortion induced by sulfur doping is very small. The overall tendency of lattice distortion is decreasing along with the increase of sulfur concentration. Moreover, the lattice distortion in the case of lower sulfur doping is more obvious than that of higher sulfur doping, which maybe caused by relatively uniform distribution of bond lengths in the latter and the formation of SiSx-like compounds. Therefore, the excellent semiconductor properties can be preserved in the case of S-hyperdoped Si, which is consistent with previously published experimental observations.

 Fig. 1  The calculated average deviation of lattice constant and cell volume of S-doped Si, compared with pure Si. 
In order to compare the relative degree of difficulty for a sulfur atom to incorporate into the Si crystal host in various concentrations, the impurity formation energy (Ef) is analyzed as shown in Fig. 2, which is a widely accepted method. In the present work, the formula of the impurity formation energy was the same as that used in the formalism defined by Van de Walle et al.23 At lower sulfur concentration, the doping process exhibits the feature of a very distinct exothermic reaction. In the case of 0.976 × 1020 cm−3 sulfur doping, the impurity formation energy reaches −42.72 eV. When the sulfur concentration is increased to 3.902 × 1020 cm−3, the impurity formation energy drastically reduces and then varies quite gently. Finally, the impurity formation energy converges to the value of ∼−1 eV in the case of sulfur with 7.804 × 1020 cm−3 concentration. Through fitting analysis, it is found that the tendency of variation of impurity formation energy along with sulfur concentration obeys the law of exponential growth well, as shown in Fig. 2. This finding implies the required preparation conditions need not be changed with the increase of the doping concentration for the S-hyperdoped Si cases, and the hyperdoping is relatively easy to perform, compared with lower doping for sulfur incorporating into silicon crystal.

For the intermediate band solar cell materials, the important property is the corresponding electronic structure. In Fig. 3, three kinds of band structure of S-doped Si and the band structure of pure Si as reference are illustrated. The calculated band gap (Eg = 1.118 eV) and dispersion relation (E(k) ∼ k) of pure Si are in very good agreement with experimental measurement, meaning the computational method could reproduce the experimental results well. The first important change is the type of band gap. For pure Si, it is the indirect band gap. However, in all S-doped Si models, the band gap is changed to the direction band gap as the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the same k-point of Γ. Second, the band gap is gradually widened. At the lower sulfur doping (0.976 × 1020 cm−3), the band gap is slightly widened to 1.151 eV, and is further widened to 1.402 eV at the higher sulfur doping (7.804 × 1020 cm−3). In this process, the value of Eg varies almost linearly with the sulfur concentration. The relationship between Eg and sulfur concentration (x) obtained by fitting is Eg = 1.118 + 0.034 × x, with the corresponding fitting curve illustrated in Fig. 4.

There are two more valence electrons in a sulfur atom, compared to a silicon atom. So, the impurity energy levels that act as donor levels will be induced, when one sulfur atom replaces one silicon atom in Si crystal host. In Fig. 3, two impurity energy levels (EI1 and EI2) are found in the bandgap of S-doped Si. The first impurity energy level (EI1) is below the bottom of conduction band, and the second impurity energy level (EI2) overlaps with the bottom of the conduction band. In the case of lower sulfur doping as shown in Fig. 3 as labeled by “Si511S” (in which, x = 0.976 × 1020 cm−3), these two impurity energy levels are obviously separated from each other. The distance from the maximum of EI1 to the minimum of EI2 (DEI1–EI2 = MIN[EI2] − MAX[EI1]) is 0.131 eV. Moreover, both impurity energy levels are not across the Fermi energy level (EF), indicating that there are no nearby empty states, and these extra electrons cannot contribute to metallic conduction. Thus, the S-doped Si model is in the insulating state and maintains the features of an insulator in this case. In the case of middle sulfur doping as shown in Fig. 3 as labeled by “Si255S” (in which x = 1.951 × 1020 cm−3), these two impurity energy levels nearly contact each other, and the distance of DEI1–EI2 almost equals to zero (DEI1–EI2 = 0.029 eV). The first impurity energy level (EI1) touches the Fermi energy level. In the next S-doped Si model, Si217S in which x = 2.312 × 1020 cm−3 and is not shown in Fig. 3, the distance of DEI1–EI2 almost equals −0.005 eV, indicating that these two impurity energy levels are already partially overlapping. On the other hand, both impurity energy levels are across the Fermi energy level (EF). These calculated results clearly indicate the insulator-to-metal transition occurring between these sulfur doping concentrations. In the case of higher sulfur doping as shown in Fig. 3 as labeled by “Si63S” (in which, x = 7.804 × 1020 cm−3), these two impurity energy levels are more obviously overlapping, and the corresponding distance of DEI1–EI2 equals to −0.325 eV. At the same time, both impurity energy levels are across the Fermi energy level. In other words, there are nearby empty states and these extra electrons can contribute to metallic conduction. Thus, the S-doped Si model is in the metallic state and obviously exhibits the feature of a metal in this case.
In order to explore the mechanism of insulator-to-metal transition, we carefully analyzed the band structure of all S-doped Si models and observed three important phenomena. The first phenomenon is that the positions of impurity energy levels are gradually shifting along with the sulfur concentration. From lower sulfur doping to higher sulfur doping, the position of EI1 is gradually shifting upward, that is, gradually coming close to EF and finally crossing it. On the contrary, the position of EI2 is gradually shifting downward, that is, gradually closing EF and finally crossing it. This phenomenon could be reflected by the variation of DEI1–EI2 as shown in Fig. 4. The second phenomenon is that the width of impurity energy levels, defined as the difference between maximum and minimum of energy level (for example, WEI1 = MAX[EI1] − MIN[EI1]), is gradually widening along with the increase in sulfur concentration, as shown in Fig. 4. In the case of lower sulfur doping, the impurity energy levels are quite flat (the band structure of “Si511S” as shown in Fig. 3), while, in the case of higher sulfur doping, the impurity energy levels are quite disperse (the band structure of “Si63S”as shown in Fig. 3). The abovementioned two phenomena lead to the insulator-to-metal transition of S-doped Si by sulfur doping concentration. The third phenomenon is that all the electronic parameters (including distance between energy levels or energy level width) vary linearly along with sulfur doping concentration. Thus, in Fig. 4, the calculated data were fitted in the present work, as shown by the fitting formula and curves. According to the definition of the insulator-to-metal transition, we considered that the transition occurs when DEI1–EI2 = 0. So, the corresponding sulfur doping concentration is 2.095 × 1020 cm−3, indicated by a blue cycle in Fig. 4, which is in the range of 1.8–4.3 × 1020 cm−3, as measured by Winkler et al.15
To explore the bonding information in depth, the density of sates (DOS) of all S-doped Si models were further analyzed as shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The total density of states of all S-doped Si models and pure Si model are illustrated in Fig. 5. It is clearly shown that the Fermi energy level is shifted upward relative to the bottom of the conduction band, and a distinct defect peak that is induced by sulfur doping is located at the bottom of the conduction band. With increasing sulfur concentration, the DOS peak related to the impurity is stronger. Because of the Gaussian broadening effect of smearing eigenvalue integration, the total DOS can not display the insulator-to-metal transition process as described above. However, the increasing width of the defect peak indicates the increasing dispersion and interactions between neighboring sulfur impurities. As sulfur impurities become more closely spaced, stronger impurity–impurity interaction induce the decrease of DEI1–EI2, resulting in the extra electrons, which are no longer bound to impurity sites. Thus, the charge transport can be accomplished without thermal activation, implying the occurrence of insulator-to-metal transition. The local and partial DOS of two S-doped Si models are illustrated in Fig. 6, which provide two strong evidences for above mentioned phenomena. First, the impurity energy levels predominantly consist of the hybridization of S-3s states with the 3p states of Si atoms neighboring with the impurity. The hybridization between S-3p states and Si-3s states also contributes to the formation of impurity energy levels. Secondly, the defect states are mainly localized on the impurity site and around its host atoms in the case of lower sulfur doping (labeled as “Si511S” in Fig. 6), while they are still present far away from impurity in the case of higher sulfur doping (labeled as “Si63S” in Fig. 6). In the former case, the defect states disappear for the seventh neighboring site of the impurity, while in the latter case, the defect state still exists even for the ninth neighboring site of impurity, which has a larger distance of 8.79 Å. In the present work, this distance means all silicon atoms are involved. Therefore, in the sulfur hyperdoping for crystal silicon, the defect states have global or delocalized feature, which is very important for the application of intermediate band solar cells.

The delocalized feature of defect states could be further confirmed by the maps of electron density, electron difference density, and electron localization function as shown in Fig. 7. For the pure Si, only inner electrons are localized at Si sites, while the valence electrons are forming the covalent bond between Si atoms. So, the Mulliken charge population of Si equals to zero, while the population on the Si–Si is very large (2.97 e). As a result, the direction of electron distribution is along the Si–Si bond: the electrons transfer from the side far away from Si–Si bonds to collect on the bond between Si atoms; and the electron localization function of Si–Si bonds is obviously larger than that around Si sites. When sulfur impurity is incorporated, this situation is changed (i) the sulfur defect charge density is relatively localized around the impurity as shown in Fig. 7(b). So, the Mulliken charge population of S impurity equals to ∼−0.29 e, while that of Si boned with S impurity equals to ∼0.09 e. Importantly, at the lower sulfur doping, the Mulliken charge population of Si atoms that are not bonded with sulfur impurity are staying at zero; while after insulator-to-metal transition, their Mulliken charge populations slightly changed to negative values at the higher sulfur doping. Moreover, the average Mulliken populations of Si–Si bonds are obviously decreasing and that of the Si–S bond is smaller, resulting in the weakening of covalent feature of Si–Si bonds and forming relative strong ionic Si–S bond. These features are more and more obvious along with the increasing of sulfur doping concentration. (ii) For the Si atoms that are boned with sulfur impurity, the situation of electron redistribution is different. As shown in Fig. 7(d) and Table 1, their s states lose fewer electrons, while their p states lose more electrons, when compared with those of Si atoms that are not bonded with sulfur impurity. Thus, the conclusions of Si–S ionic bond and hybridization between S-3s states and Si-3p states around impurity are confirmed again. (iii) As shown in Fig. 7(f), the electron localization functions around the sulfur impurity are relatively smaller than that of silicon host atoms. Thus, the extra electrons of the sulfur impurity may possibly transfer around the whole crystal lattice, to become a quasi-free charge carrier and to contribute the metallic conduction at the higher sulfur doping.

4. Conclusions
In order to explore the mechanism of insulator-to-metal transition of sulfur doped silicon, ten supercell models containing different sulfur impurity concentrations were constructed. Moreover, the crystal structure and electronic properties were investigated by density functional theory calculations. The lattice distortion of crystal silicon induced by sulfur doping was very small and remained negligible as sulfur concentration increased. Two impurity energy levels that act as donor levels were formed in the band gap of all S-doped Si models. The positions and width of impurity energy levels linearly vary with the increase of sulfur concentration. Finally, the impurity energy levels overlap with each other and cross the Fermi energy level at higher sulfur doping concentration, resulting in metallic conduction. In the present work, it is predicted that the insulator-to-metal transition occurs at the sulfur concentration of 2.095 × 1020 cm−3, which is well consistent with experimental measurement. Furthermore, these defect states present the features of delocalized states, suggesting that S-hyperdoped Si is very suitable of the intermediate band solar cells. These findings are helpful to understand previous experimental observations and useful in developing the novel intermediate band solar cells.

 	Fig. 1  The calculated average deviation of lattice constant and cell volume of S-doped Si, compared with pure Si.	 

 	Fig. 2  The calculated impurity formation (Ef) of S-doped Si as a function of sulfur concentration (x) and the corresponding fitting curve and formula.	 

 	Fig. 3  The calculated band structure of pure Si and three types S-doped Si. The impurity energy levels are labeled by purple dash dot line (EI1) and blue dash line (EI2), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  The various parameters of electronic structure of S-doped Si as a function of sulfur concentration and the corresponding fitting curve and formula. The blue cycle indicates the occurrence of insulator-to-metal transition.	 

 	Fig. 5  The calculated total density of states of pure Si and S-doped Si at different sulfur concentrations.	 

 	Fig. 6  The local and partial density of states of Si511S and Si63S models. The number after “Si” indicates the neighboring sequence of Si atoms with the impurity S atom, and the number in the parentheses indicates the distance between Si and S atoms, with the unit of Å.	 

 	Fig. 7  The calculated electron density map of pure Si (a) and S-doped Si (Si63S) (b); electron difference density map of pure Si (c) and S-doped Si (Si63S) (d); electron localization function map of pure Si (e) and S-doped Si (Si63S) (f). All the slices are across the position of S impurity sites and take the crystalline orientation of [10].
