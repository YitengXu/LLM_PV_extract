    , Accepted 21st February 2019First published on 22nd February 2019AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) with high tolerance to film thickness are essential for high performance and low-cost commercial manufacturing. Most popular strategies acquire this feature by designing new donor or acceptor materials, which is too complicated and time-consuming. In this work, we provide a simple and efficient strategy that introduces a novel halogen-free solid additive, 1,10-decanediol (DDO), into the bulk heterojunction to realize highly efficient and thermostable OSCs with good tolerance to film thickness. The binary OSC based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.11%, which is superior to that of the OSC doped with the traditional solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (PCE of 9.44%). On co-doping DDO and DIO into the system, a maximum PCE of 11.64% was obtained for the binary OSC. Most importantly, the DDO-containing OSCs show a high tolerance to film thickness (80–300 nm), with a PCE ranging from 10.22% to 11.64%. This is attributed to the addition of DDO, which improved the crystallinity of the polymer, optimized the miscibility between donor and acceptor, and modulated the vertical distribution of molecules. Furthermore, considering the good tolerance to film thickness of the active layer, a semi-transparent OSC (ST-OSC) based on DDO achieves a high PCE of 8.41% with a high average visible transmittance (AVT) of 30.8%, and an optimized PCE of 9.71% with an AVT of 15.9%, which is among the best reported ST-OSCs. Moreover, the DDO-containing OSCs show excellent thermostability, with the PCE remaining at 73% of its original value after 120 min thermal annealing under atmospheric conditions. This work demonstrates an original and convenient strategy to fabricate high performance semi-transparent or thick-film OSCs.
Introduction
As renewable and clean sources of energy, organic solar cells (OSCs) could significantly reduce global warming and ecological deterioration. Ascribed to novel syntheses of photovoltaic materials and continuous improvement in device fabrication,1–7 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single heterojunction OSCs have reached 14% in the last two years.8–10 Aside from achieving high device efficiency, more and more researchers have also paid intense attention to investigating the properties of OSCs, such as flexibility, semi-transparency and thickness tolerance.11–14 To achieve high performance semi-transparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) or thick-film OSCs, most research groups designed special materials with high transmittance in their absorption spectra, or modulated the molecular distribution so that the OSCs are insensitive to film thickness.15,16 For example, by synthesizing a near-infrared (NIR) acceptor, IUIC, an excellent non-fullerene ST-OSC with a high PCE of 10.2% was obtained by X. Zhan’s group.17 The weak absorption in the visible region endowed the ST-OSC with a high average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31%. Y. Sun’s group utilized a ternary strategy to realize a high performance fullerene based ST-OSC: by introducing a wide band gap donor, PBT1-S, into the traditional polymer/fullerene system, a high PCE of 9.2% and an AVT of 20% were achieved.18 For thick-film OSCs, J. Hou’s group recently reported a significant work,19 in which a new non-fullerene acceptor, SeTIC4Cl, was designed and utilized to fabricate OSCs with different film thickness. Attributed to the desirable nanoscale phase separation, the device showed a high tolerance to film thickness. However, almost all the strategies to achieve thickness-insensitive OSCs are high-cost and complex, and there are few reports focusing on realizing this property for OSCs with simpler and lower-cost strategies.
To solve this thorny problem, we innovatively introduced a novel solid additive, 1,10-decanediol (DDO), into the polymer/fullerene system. The terminal hydroxyl groups of DDO can not only enhance the emulsification ability of the components and make them mix with each other more effectively, but can also endow the system with appropriate surface tension to form favourable interpenetrating network structures.20–22 The fullerene material [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was selected as the acceptor in this work, for its high electron mobility and wide visible absorption spectrum. The polymer donor poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl) (PTB7-Th) was used in combination with PC71BM, for its good compatibility and complementary absorption.7 In addition, to demonstrate the general applicability of this strategy, popular OSCs such as poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T):PC71BM and benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR):PC71BM were also sensitized by DDO. First of all, the opaque device consisting of PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO was studied. Compared with the traditional additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), the DDO-containing device can also achieve a high performance with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.07 mA cm−2 and a maximum PCE of 10.11%. Considering that DDO exhibits better chemical stability, the solid additive DDO can completely replace the most utilized solvent additive DIO (DIO decomposes easily).23,24 On further addition of a small amount of DIO to the active layer, a very high PCE of 11.64% was achieved for the binary system, which is the highest efficiency among reported PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary OSCs. More remarkably, the OSC shows a high tolerance to film thickness. When the thickness of the active layer varied from 80 to 300 nm, the PCE was maintained at above 10%. The high film thickness tolerance of the DDO-containing device is attributed to the addition of DDO, which optimized the crystallinity of the polymers and modulated the vertical distribution of the molecules. Furthermore, considering this unique feature, a binary ST-OSC containing PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO was fabricated by using 1 nm Au/20 nm Ag as the electrode. The semi-transparent device showed a high PCE of 8.41% with a high average visible transmittance (AVT) of 30.8%. On further increasing the Ag thickness to 30 nm, an optimized PCE of 9.71% with an AVT of 15.9% was obtained, which is among the best reported ST-OSCs. These results provide a simple and convenient way to develop high performance semi-transparent or thick-film OSCs.
Experimental section
General information
PTB7-Th (MW: 145000) and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material and American Dye Source, respectively. 1,10-Decanediol (DDO) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from TCI. PEDOT:PSS and MoO3 were purchased from Xi’an p-OLED Technology Corp. All solvents utilized in this work were procured from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Chemical. All materials were sourced from the same batch, which guarantees the fairness and credibility of this research.
Device fabrication and measurements
The opaque and semi-transparent OSCs were fabricated with a conventional inverted device structure. A ZnO precursor solution was prepared by blending zinc acetate dihydrate (110 mg) and ethanolamine (31 mg) with 2-methoxyethanol solution (1 ml) for 24 h. The active layer mixture was formed with a donor:acceptor (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) doping ratio of 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene (CB) solvent, in which the donor concentration was maintained at 10 mg ml−1. 0.5% wt solid additive DDO was dispersed in the mixture to improve the film morphology. Furthermore, the traditional solvent additive DIO was added to the binary system as a contrast. For the PBDB-T:PC71BM system, the donor and acceptor were blended in CB solvent in a ratio of 1:1, with a total concentration of 20 mg ml−1. BTR and PC71BM (1:1) were dissolved in chloroform solvent with a total concentration of 40 mg ml−1. All active layer mixtures were stirred overnight in a nitrogen filled glove box at 60 °C. For device construction, indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glasses were cleaned by successive 30 min ultra-sonication treatments in detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone, and ethanol, and then the glasses were flushed with nitrogen. After pretreatment with ultraviolet radiation and ozone, the prepared ZnO solution was dropped on the ITO surface and spin-coated at a rotation speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s, and then the ZnO covered glasses were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h. After that, the ZnO covered glasses were immediately transferred to a glove box. The active layer mixture was spin-coated onto ZnO at a rotation speed of 600–6000 rpm for 30 s, which yielded 60–300 nm thickness films. Afterwards, the MoO3 transport layer (10 nm) and the Ag electrode (150 nm) were sequentially evaporated at rates of 0.1 Å s−1 and 5 Å s−1, to form active areas of 2.3 and 11.0 mm2, respectively. For the ST-OSCs, a semi-transparent electrode containing Au (10 nm)/Ag (10–30 nm) was also formed via vacuum evaporation. Both Au and Ag were evaporated at the rate of 1 Å s−1. The thickness of the active layers was measured using a step profilometer (AMBIOS-XP2). The absorption and transmission spectra of the films were recorded using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-VS spectrophotometer. The film surface morphology and structure were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), using an Asylum Research AFM system (MFP-3D-BIO, an Oxford Instruments company) and a high-resolution TEM scanning-probe SPM system (Hitachi TEM system) at Ceshigo Research Service (http://www.ceshigo.com). For specimen preparation, films were spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS covered substrates in a nitrogen containing glove box. After that, the substrates were steeped in a water-filled culture dish. After a few seconds, the organic phase would float on the water and then be removed by a 200 mesh TEM copper grid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a Thermo Fisher Scientific EscaLab 250 Xi. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out on the BL16B1 beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. All samples were irradiated with 10 keV X-rays with an incident angle of 0.12°. A Pilatus 2M detector was used. The current density–voltage (J–V) properties were studied using a Keithley 2400 source meter instrument. PCEs were determined from J–V curves recorded under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (Newport Oriel Sol3A Simulator, calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. EQE curves were measured using a QEX10 Quantum Efficiency Measurement System (PV Measurements, Inc.). The deviation between the theoretically calculated current densities and the actual measured JSC values was lower than 5%. The carrier mobility was investigated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were measured by hole- and electron-only devices with the structures ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/Active layer/LiF/Al, respectively. The calculations were performed using the Mott–Gurney equation as follows:JSCLC = (9/8)ε0εTμ((V2)/(L3))
in which ε0 stands for the vacuum permittivity and is 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1, and εT means the relative permittivity (3.00). μ is the calculated charge mobility. L is the distance from the cathode to the anode. V is the external electric field.
Results and discussion
Characterization and optical properties
1,10-Decanediol (DDO), which is a commercially available, structurally simple and chemically stable material, has more research potential than traditional halogenated solvent additives. Fig. 1(b) shows the chemical structures of PTB7-Th, PC71BM and DDO. DDO possesses two hydroxyl groups at either end of the decane chain, which endows DDO with suitable hydrophilicity. The absorption spectra of PC71BM and PTB7-Th are shown in Fig. S1.† PC71BM exhibits a broad absorption range of 300–700 nm, whereas PTB7-Th shows a complementary absorption spectrum within the region of 550–850 nm. The combination of PC71BM and PTB7-Th can encompass the whole visible region and is able to absorb the intense radiation in the region of 400–600 nm. The normalized absorption spectra of the blend films are shown in Fig. 1(c). After adding DDO to the binary system, the intensity of the short wavelength band (300–550 nm) shows few differences compared to that of the control film, while the long wavelength band (550–800 nm) exhibits enhanced absorption intensity. Indicating that the introduction of DDO has a positive contribution to improve the crystallinity and the ordered stacking of PTB7-Th, this phenomenon has also been demonstrated in the film morphology and crystallization analysis. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PTB7-Th doped with different amounts of DDO were recorded, as shown in Fig. 1(d). All precursor solutions were prepared with a constant concentration of PTB7-Th (10 mg ml−1). The excitation wavelength was 600 nm. With an increase in DDO content, the emission intensity of PTB7-Th is significantly enhanced, indicating that the crystallinity of the polymer has been improved by introducing DDO into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system. PTB7-Th possesses a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) at −5.24 and −3.62 eV, respectively. PC71BM has a HOMO/LUMO at −6.10/−3.10 eV.

Photovoltaic performance
To verify the influence of DDO on the photovoltaic characteristics of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based OSCs, opaque devices with the inverted structure ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO/MoO3/Ag were firstly fabricated. The thickness of MoO3 was controlled at 10 nm and that of Ag was maintained at 150 nm to form an opaque electrode. For comparison, the most commonly used halogenated solvent additive DIO was also introduced into this system. The control devices contained PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:3% DIO.

Fig. 2(a) shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of binary OSCs containing the solid additive DDO in different doping concentrations. The current density continuously increases from 14.01 to 18.07 mA cm−2, and the fill factor (FF) increases from 53.93% to 66.90% with an increase in DDO content from 0% to 0.5%. Table 1 shows the device performances of the fabricated OSCs. On further increasing the amount of DDO, the FF shows a downward trend, which may be caused by the addition of excess DDO, resulting in a much larger domain size. Compared with the control devices with or without DIO, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO based OSC shows a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC), which may be caused by the enhanced polymer crystallinity. The superior device performance suggests that DDO is an excellent halogen-free auxiliary that can replace the traditional solvent additive DIO.25–29 To further improve the PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary blend OSCs, DIO was added and cooperated with DDO in the system. The performances of PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:x% DIO based OSCs with different amounts of DIO are shown in Fig. 2(c) as well as in Table 1. In these devices, x ranges from 0.5% to 2%. When the concentration of DIO is optimized to 1%, the device shows a particularly high PCE of 11.64% with an improved FF of 71.30%, which is among the best results for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary OSCs. Furthermore, to verify the applicability of this solid additive strategy, two other popular OSCs, PBDB-T:PC71BM and BTR:PC71BM, were also sensitized by DDO. Fig. 3(a) shows the J–V curves of PBDB-T:PC71BM:3% DIO, PBDB-T:PC71BM:1% DIO, PBDB-T:PC71BM:0.5% DDO and PBDB-T:PC71BM:1% DIO:0.5% DDO based OSCs. The doping ratio in the device was optimized, and the device data are listed in Table 2. Compared with the traditional additive DIO, the solid additive DDO shows better optimization of JSC and FF, suggesting that DIO can be replaced by DDO in this system. Fig. 3(b) shows the J–V properties of BTR:PC71BM and BTR:PC71BM:0.3% DDO containing OSCs. It is obvious that introducing DDO in this all small molecule system also effects a great improvement in charge dynamics; as a result, BTR:PC71BM:0.3% DDO shows a high PCE of 10.55% with a high FF of 70.09%, which represents a 12.7% enhancement with respect to the control device. These results demonstrate that the solid additive strategy has great applicability in polymer/fullerene and small molecule/fullerene OSCs.

To further explore the potential applications of the solid additive DDO, PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO based OSCs with different active layer thickness were fabricated and investigated; the film thickness ranged from 60 to 300 nm. As shown in Fig. 3(c) and Table 3, a remarkable decrease in JSC can be observed when the film thickness is reduced from 300 to 60 nm, which is ascribed to reduced light absorption. Contrarily, the FF increased from 57.76% for the device with 300 nm film thickness to 71.30% for the best device; this increase can also be easily seen in the J–V curves. With a decrease in film thickness from 300 to 60 nm, the PCE value increased from 10.22% to 11.64%, and then decreased to 10.02% for the device with 60 nm film thickness, which shows a minor efficiency variation. When the active layer thickness of the control device was varied from 60 to 300 nm (shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1†), the PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:3% DIO containing device changed from 9.26% to 5.52%. When the active layer thickness of the control device increased from 120 nm to 300 nm, both JSC and FF decreased to a low value; this may be caused by the strong bimolecular recombination and unbalanced charge transport occurring in the device. When the thickness decreased from 120 nm to 60 nm, the JSC value decreased from 18.26 to 13.38 mA cm−2, which is attributed to poorer photon absorption in the active layers. For the DDO and DIO co-doped device, the introduction of DDO can greatly suppress adverse recombination, and as a result, the DDO-containing device shows a better tolerance to film thickness than the device doped with DIO only. This unique feature is mainly attributed to the introduction of DDO, which not only improved the charge dynamic characteristics in the active layer, but also ordered the molecular distribution to form efficient charge transfer channels, as demonstrated in the morphology analysis. This excellent device performance suggests that DDO has great potential in large-scale industrial production. We further developed a larger area (11 mm2) device under the same conditions (Table S2†). The device shows few changes in VOC and JSC, while the FF decreased obviously from 71.30% to 66.99% for the optimized OSC. As a result, the maximum PCE decreased from 11.64% to 11.15%. Similar tendencies were also exhibited by the control device, as shown in Table S2.† The reduction in FFs and PCEs in devices with larger area can be attributed to the series resistance (RS) of the patterned ITO as the area and current density increase.30,31 The EQE characteristics of the optimized OSCs are shown in Fig. 2(d) and 3(d). In contrast to the control devices with or without DIO, the DDO-containing OSCs show remarkable enhancement in the region of 300–800 nm, especially in the long wavelength range of 550–800 nm. The enhancement is attributed to suppressed adverse accumulation and improved polymer crystallization, so that the active layer can capture more photos. When the film thickness increased to 300 nm, the EQE values showed remarkable enhancement over the whole wavelength range, which may be attributed to improved light absorption as a result of the increased film thickness. The JSCs calculated from the EQEs are consistent with the measured values within a deviation of 5%.

Inspired by the high conversion efficiency and good film thickness tolerance of the active layer, ST-OSCs with the structure ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO/MoO3 (10 nm)/Au (1 nm)/Ag (10–30 nm) were fabricated as shown in Fig. 1(a). 1 nm Au combined with various thicknesses of Ag was used as a transparent electrode. Transmission spectra in the visible region (370–740 nm) were used to measure the light transmitted from the glass/ITO side to the transparent electrode side, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Unlike recently reported NIR non-fullerene ST-OSCs, all devices show suitable transmittance in the visible region, indicating that the ST-OSCs in our work exhibit a balance between absorption and transmission in the intense solar radiation region of 400–600 nm. When the thickness of Ag is tuned to 10 nm, a PCE of 6.83% along with an ultra-high AVT of 49.5% was obtained. On further increasing the electrode thickness to 20 nm, the PCE of the ST-OSC increased to 8.41% with an AVT of 30.8%. This result realized the balance of high PCE and good AVT in the full visible absorption spectrum. On increasing the thickness of Ag to 30 nm, a very high PCE of 9.71% with an AVT of 15.9% was realized. More detailed data for the ST-OSCs is shown in Table 4. Fig. 4(b) shows outdoor photographs taken through ST-OSCs with Ag thickness of 10, 20 and 30 nm (from left to right). The background can be clearly recognized through all ST-OSCs, implying that all devices have good transmittance and possess the potential to be used in smart windows. The J–V curves of these ST-OSCs are presented in Fig. 4(c). The JSCs of the semi-transparent devices showed regular degradation and decayed from 17.56 to 13.33 mA cm−2 as the Ag thickness was reduced from 30 to 10 nm. As demonstrated in the EQE curves in Fig. 4(d), the EQEs show remarkable reduction compared to the opaque device, especially in the visible region, which is attributed to the good transmission of the ST-OSCs. Furthermore, on decreasing the thickness of the Ag electrode to 20 and 10 nm, the EQEs are reduced in the whole region of 300 to 800 nm in accordance with the decline in JSC, which was ascribed to a decrease in light absorption in the active layers, due to the lowered reflectivity of the Ag electrode.

Fig. 5(a)–(c) show the PCE statistics for ST-OSCs with different Ag thickness. 25 samples were studied for each kind of device, and all PCEs fall in a reasonable region, suggesting that the ST-OSCs exhibit great reproducibility. Fig. 5(d) shows a comparison with remarkable recently reported work on fullerene ST-OSCs.32–40 All of the ST-OSCs show huge superiority to the reported fullerene based semi-transparent devices. This is synchronously attributed to the contribution of DDO, which maintains a high PCE, and the thin active layer thickness (80 nm). Compared to recently reported NIR non-fullerene based ST-OSCs, although the results for our semi-transparent devices are not among the best, the ST-OSCs in this work achieve high PCEs with full visible region absorption, and even yield comparable efficiencies to those of NIR non-fullerene based ST-OSCs.

To investigate the origin of the enhanced JSC in DDO-containing binary OSCs, the charge transport abilities of devices with and without DDO were studied by space-charge limited current (SCLC), as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S3.† Both μh and μe showed an upward trend when 0.5% DDO was added to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film. Compared with the film without any additives, the μh of the DDO-containing film increased from 2.18 × 10−5 to 1.12 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is also higher than that of the DIO doped film (5.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Besides, the DDO and DIO co-doped film also showed a remarkable μh of 1.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. This enhancement in hole mobility can be attributed to the addition of DDO, which enhances the crystallinity of the polymer and forms effective charge transport channels. Accordingly, the μe increased from 4.34 × 10−6 to 9.56 × 10−4 and 1.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO and PTB7-Th:C71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO based films, respectively. The improvement in μe is ascribed to the dispersion effect of DDO, which provides more donor/acceptor contact interfaces. The charge balance properties can be evaluated using the specific value of μh/μe as shown in Table S3.† The control film contains PTB7-Th:PC71BM without any additives and shows an unbalanced charge transmission with a μh/μe of 5.02. This is because fullerene aggregation caused severe phase separation.41 When 3% DIO was added to the film, the charge transport improved, with a μh/μe of 1.78, suggesting that the solvent additive DIO could avert material aggregation in the active layers, resulting in enhanced charge mobility. When DDO was added to the above films, a more balanced charge transfer could be obtained, with μh/μe values of 1.17 and 1.18, respectively. The high and balanced charge mobility of the DDO-containing films guarantees efficient charge transport and extraction, and is responsible for the high JSC and FF of the devices. Fig. S4† shows the fitting curves for the hole and electron mobilities of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO film with 300 nm thickness; the hole and electron mobilities decreased to 8.71 × 10−4 and 4.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The device showed an unbalanced charge transport with μh/μe of 2.06, which may be the main factor in the low FF of the thick-film device.
In order to understand the relationship between charge generation and recombination in the active layers of DDO-containing OSCs, the dependence of JSC on the illumination intensity (Plight) was measured from 100 mW cm−2 to 5 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Theoretically, the connection between JSC and Plight should be consistent with a power law connection of JSC ∝ Plightα, in which α refers to an exponential factor and should be close to 1.00 if there is weak bimolecular recombination in the device. The 0.5% DDO and 0.5% DDO:1% DIO-containing devices show improved α of 0.997 and 0.999, respectively, compared to the device doped with 3% DIO only (0.947), indicating that bimolecular recombination can be ignored in DDO-containing devices. As DDO-containing devices show good tolerance to film thickness, we deduce that this is closely related to the charge dynamic properties in the active layers. Hence, the JSC–Plight characteristics for PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO based OSCs with different film thickness were investigated, as shown in Fig. 6(c). On increasing the film thickness from 80 to 300 nm, the α value shows a slight decrease from 0.999 to 0.984; even for a thick film, the device still shows weaker bimolecular recombination than DIO doped OSCs. Besides, using Au (1 nm)/Ag (20 nm) or Au(1 nm)/Ag (30 nm) as the transparent electrode, the ST-OSCs also show suppressed bimolecular recombination with α values of 0.992 and 0.998 (shown in Fig. S5(a)†), respectively, suggesting that the solid additive DDO indeed makes a positive contribution to both thick and semi-transparent OSCs. The feeble charge recombination implies more efficient exciton dissociation, which could be demonstrated by the photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves, as shown in Fig. 6(b) and (d) and S5(b).†42–49 The Jph is the difference between JL and JD, in which JL and JD mean the current density of the device under AM 1.5G illumination and in the dark, respectively. The Veff is determined by V0 − VA, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and VA is the applied voltage in the device. Compared with the control device (PTB7-Th:PC71BM:3% DIO) in Fig. 6(b), the Jphs of the DDO-containing devices achieve saturation status at a lower Veff, suggesting that weaker bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge dissociation would occur in DDO-containing devices.50,51 When Veff reaches a higher value (Veff ≥ 2.0), charge recombination is suppressed for high internal electric fields, and the Jph becomes saturated at a constant value (Jsat). The charge dissociation probabilities P (E, T), which can be estimated from the value of JSC/Jsat, were calculated. For opaque OSCs, the control device shows a P (E, T) value of 0.88. When 0.5% DDO was doped in the binary film, an enhanced dissociation probability of 0.90 was obtained. For the system containing 0.5% DDO and 1% DIO, the device shows a higher P (E, T) value of 0.93. Accordingly, as depicted in Fig. 6(d), DDO and DIO co-doped devices show P (E, T) values of 0.89 at 300 nm film thickness and 0.92 at 200 nm film thickness. Furthermore, the Jph–Veff curves of ST-OSCs are shown in Fig. S5(b).† The ST-OSCs also retain high exciton dissociation probabilities of 0.92 for the device utilizing 20 nm Ag and 0.93 for the device utilizing 30 nm Ag. The increased charge dissociation rate shows that the introduction of DDO can accelerate exciton dissociation and charge collection, which contributes to improved charge transfer in the device.52–54

Morphology characterization
The excellent device performances of the DDO based OSCs are also related to the morphology of the active layers, therefore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to directly observe the morphology of the DDO-containing films. Fig. 7(a)–(d) show TEM images of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM:3% DIO, PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO films, respectively, while Fig. 7(e)–(h) present the AFM images in turn. In the TEM images, the bright regions indicate the donor materials and the black regions represent fullerene-rich domains. Without any additive addition in PTB7-Th:PC71BM, the film shows noticeable inhomogeneity with huge domain sizes (as shown in Fig. 7(a)), which is caused by the severe aggregation of PC71BM domains. Corresponding to the AFM image in Fig. 7(e), a high root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.65 nm suggests a non-uniform surface appearance for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film. When 0.5% DDO was added to the binary film, a remarkable improvement could be seen in both the TEM (Fig. 7(c)) and AFM (Fig. 7(g)) images. The AFM image shows homogeneous dispersion with a small RMS of 0.94 nm, which is smoother than the control and DIO-containing films. The uniform appearance implies favourable interface contacts between the active layer and the electrodes. The TEM image of the 0.5% DDO-containing film shows less phase separation and a distinct nano-fiber interpenetrating network structure, which is the dominant factor in enhancing JSC and FF. Fig. 7(b) and (f) show the TEM and AFM images for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:3% DIO based film, respectively. The film shows better micro-morphology and structure than the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film, with an RMS of 1.43 nm. When DDO and DIO were co-doped in the host system, a trade-off surface appearance with an RMS of 1.22 nm was obtained, as shown in Fig. 7(h). As shown in the TEM image in Fig. 7(d), an appropriate domain size of about 20 nm appeared to give a bi-continuous interpenetrating network in the film. The unique micro-structures provided more donor/acceptor contact at the interface and formed lots of “high-speed” channels to accelerate charge transport. As a result, the generated charges would be transmitted to the electrode as soon as possible. The enhancement in film morphology was responsible for the high JSC and FF of the OSCs containing DDO.

The crystalline orientation and molecular packing properties of these films were investigated by two dimensional (2D) GIWAXS measurements. 2D GIWAXS patterns of pure PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th:0.5% DDO, pure PC71BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM:3% DIO, PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO films are shown in Fig. 8(a)–(f), and the corresponding out of plane and in plane profiles are shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b). The pure PTB7-Th film shows a typical face-on orientation ((010), qz = 1.68 Å−1) in the out of plane direction, which arises from Bragg diffraction due to π–π stacking in PTB7-Th. In the in plane direction, a remarkable (100) scattering can be observed, which corresponds to polymer alkyl stacking. To investigate the influence of solid additive on polymer crystallization, the 0.5% DDO-containing polymer was studied, as shown in Fig. 8(b) and 9(a). DDO doped PTB7-Th shows a stronger scattering intensity with a qz of 1.72 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.65 Å, which is smaller than that in pure PTB7-Th (3.74 Å), suggesting that the introduction of DDO can improve the crystalline orientation of PTB7-Th. PC71BM shows similar scattering in both the out of plane and in plane directions (Fig. 8(c) and 9(a)), implying an amorphous film state. Fig. 8(d) shows the 2D scattering of the control device. The π–π stacking peak of the polymer in the out of plane direction becomes weaker along with a reduced qz of 1.61 Å−1, which means that PC71BM disturbs the distribution of PTB7-Th. Compared with the control device, the DDO-containing films show much stronger scattering intensity in the (100) and (010) positions (Fig. 8(e) and (f)), indicating that the solid additive also promotes the crystallinity of PTB7-Th in the blend state. The higher qz values for the two films of around 1.70 Å−1 suggest strong face-on crystallization, which is beneficial to charge transport and results in higher mobility. To understand the vertical distribution of DDO and DIO co-doped films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to measure the proportions of carbon (C), oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) atoms in the film at different detection depths. As shown in Fig. 9(c), because only PTB7-Th possesses S atoms and both PTB7-Th and PC71BM contain O atoms, we ascribe the characteristic peaks at about 163 eV to S2p of PTB7-Th and at 532 eV to O1s of the mixture of PTB7-Th and PC71BM. As the amount of DDO added (0.5 wt%) is very small, the influence of DDO on oxygen concentration can be ignored. As the depth of detection increased from 0 nm to 60 nm, the S- and O-content decreased continually, implying that the polymer also exhibits a surface enriched distribution. The introduction of DDO does not destroy the inherent distribution of polymers.

A schematic representation of the possible molecular distributions of the DDO-containing active layers is shown in Fig. 10. Without any additives, the fullerene material PC71BM will be gathered together in the binary system of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 10(a). The aggregated PC71BM in the film is responsible for the large phase separation, which is consistent with the TEM result. When 3% DIO is added to the above film (Fig. 10(b)), the molecular distribution is optimized for the suppression of adverse aggregation. However, the added DIO cannot change the crystallinity and orientation of the polymer donor. Unlike the traditional additive DIO, the solid additive DDO can promote the ordered packing of polymers (demonstrated by GIWAXS in Fig. 9(a)), which can be represented by Fig. 10(c). The improved crystallinity and the ordered stacking of PTB7-Th result in an interpenetrating polymer network, which provides more efficient charge transport channels to accelerate charge transmission and yields a high exciton dissociation ratio. However, TEM images suggest that the domain size of the blend film should be further optimized to provide more donor/acceptor contact interfaces. Hence, on co-doping DDO and DIO in the binary film, a suitable domain size for the synergistic effect of DDO and DIO is achieved. As demonstrated in Fig. 7(b)–(d), the co-doped film shows a more interpenetrated network structure than the film containing DIO only, which is attributed to the contribution of DDO. It also exhibits a smaller domain size than the film doped with DDO only, which is a benefit of the addition of DIO. As displayed in Fig. 10(d), 1% DIO can suppress fullerene aggregation, and 0.5% DDO can promote polymer crystallization and form a favourable interpenetrating network. Hence, the film presents an ordered polymer distribution and a dispersed fullerene distribution, which is beneficial for enhancing the charge transport ability. Relating these behaviors to the device performance, an OSC with high current density and FF was obtained to yield the highest PCE of 11.64%.

Thermal stability characterization
Compared with traditional halogenated solvent additives, the solid additive DDO has better chemical stability, so we deduced that DDO can also improve the heat resistance of OSCs. For this reason, the thermal stability of unencapsulated devices was measured by continuous annealing at 60 °C under atmospheric conditions. As expected, after continuous annealing for 120 min, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO containing device still maintained 73% PCE compared to the device without annealing treatment (as shown in Fig. 11(a)), while the 3% DIO based control device showed a bigger attenuation and only kept 59% PCE. The huge difference between DDO and DIO-containing OSCs is mainly attributed to the fact that iodide dissociated from DIO and mediated fullerene oxidation.55 Therefore, the DDO and DIO co-doped devices also show slightly lower stability than the devices containing 0.5% DDO. Even so, the PCE after annealing treatment is still much higher than that of the devices doped with DIO only. Fig. 11(b)–(d) show respectively the changing trends in JSC, VOC and FF with increasing annealing time. As VOC is determined by the HOMO/LUMO difference of PTB7-Th/PC71BM, the VOCs show few changes for these devices. Similar to the PCEs, the JSCs and FFs exhibit regular variation, indicating that DDO-containing devices possess a better film morphology after the annealing process than DIO-containing OSCs. The excellent thermal stability of the DDO-containing devices demonstrates that DDO is an ideal alternative additive for OSCs.

Conclusion
We report a new strategy that introduces a solid additive DDO into the active layer to realize fullerene material based OSCs with high PCE and good film thickness tolerance. As the thickness of the active layer ranges from 80 to 300 nm, high PCEs between 10.22% and 11.64% can be achieved. Attributed to the unique properties of the DDO-containing film, highly efficient semi-transparent OSCs were also fabricated. Unlike the recently reported NIR ST-OSCs, the semi-transparent devices in this work absorbed photons in the full visible region while achieving high efficiency. Using 1 nm Au/20 nm Ag as the electrode, the ST-OSC containing PTB7-Th:PC71BM:0.5% DDO:1% DIO shows a high PCE of 8.41% with a high AVT of 30.8%. On further increasing the Ag thickness to 30 nm, an optimized PCE of 9.71% with an AVT of 15.9% is obtained. The DDO-containing films show remarkable interpenetrating network nano-fiber structures, which provide more donor/acceptor contact interfaces and high speed channels to accelerate charge transfer. Besides, after thermal annealing at 60 °C for 120 min, the PCE of the DDO-containing OSC still remains at 73% of its original value. The excellent device performance suggests that DDO possesses great potential in the field of organic electronics.
