    , Accepted 18th November 2019First published on 20th November 2019AbstractHerein, two new electron acceptors, BTTPC and BTTPC-Br, are developed through extending the conjugation of terminal electron accepting moieties with thiophene and bromine units. Such a structural design effectively improves the hole transfer of exciton dynamics in blends, revealing that BTTPC-Br and BTTPC based blends, in the presence of a smaller energetic offset as a driving force, exhibit faster hole transfer from acceptors to the polymeric donor interface, 4 times (BTTPC-Br) and 1.5 times (BTTPC) faster than 0.44 picoseconds of unmodified Y5. As a result, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the BTTPC-Br acceptor, outperforming those of BTTPC:PBDB-T and Y5:PBDB-T, reach a power conversion efficiency of 15.22%, which is so far one of the highest among the single junction OSCs made with PBDB-T polymer donor.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made rapid progress in recent years1–7 and approached over 16% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for single junction OSCs.8–13 The fast evolution of active materials, especially for electron acceptors, has raised new queries on the photophysical processes in OSCs,14–21 such as how the excitons from newly developed acceptors undergo diffusion and separation at acceptor–donor interfaces. Typical fullerene acceptor based OSCs generally require a driving force of ∼0.3 eV (energy level offset) to reach efficient exciton separation,22 resulting in a relatively large voltage loss. Recent research on newly developed acceptors authenticated the practicability of high-performance non-fullerene OSCs,23–25 which allow retaining efficient exciton separation and charge generation at smaller driving forces than those in fullerene OSCs.26–28 These results revealed that efficient exciton separation can be realized at the different energy level offsets upon the evolution of acceptors. In addition to the energetic landscapes, it is also interesting to study the correlation between the structural factors of molecules and the excited dynamics of OSCs, which is important and yet to be understood for potentially improving the efficiency limits of OSCs.
It was previously discussed, in fullerene based OSCs, that highly conjugated polymer donors could facilitate charge delocalization on the backbone, hence yielding loosely bound geminate electron–hole pairs on polymers for separation.29,30 Different from those blends with spherical fullerene acceptors, present electron acceptors mainly adopt a conjugated acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone,31–33 facilitating the spatial delocalization of positive and negative charges on acceptor backbones. These acceptors adopt preferable “end-to-end” stacking of terminal A groups for the construction of electron transport channels,34–36 such as recently reported Y acceptors,37–41 which thereby offers flexibilities in structure tuning of molecules to optimize active components in non-fullerene OSCs. Herein, we have developed two new non-fullerene acceptors, namely BTTPC and BTTPC-Br, wherein a BTPTT central core from Y-series acceptors is employed because their sp3-carbon-free skeletons enable good balance between the crystallinity and solution-processability of the derived acceptors, which are beneficial to construct transport channels for high charge mobilities, and to maintain effective donor/acceptor interface for exciton disassociation. Meanwhile, electron-rich thiophene is applied to extend the conjugation of terminal electron accepting moieties. Differing from the commonly used 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (IC) with terminal benzene groups, new terminal aromatics with extended conjugation, benzo[b]thiophene and 2-bromobenzo[b]thiophene, have been employed in the design of electron acceptors, BTTPC and BTTPC-Br, respectively. It is revealed that such structural tuning of terminal groups effectively impacts the exciton dynamics of blends.
Despite having nearly the same phase morphology and molecular orientation in blends, transient absorption (TA) measurements disclose that BTTPC-Br and BTTPC based blends, in the presence of a similar or even smaller highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) offset, exhibit faster hole transfer from acceptors to the donor at the interface, 4 times (BTTPC-Br) and 1.5 times (BTTPC) faster than that of the unmodified Y5 system. It is because the introduction of the thiophene ring into the terminal A group effectively tunes the conjugation length and electron density of electron acceptors. As a result, OSCs based on both BTTPC and BTTPC-Br acceptors outperform the Y5:PBDB-T system. The BTTPC-Br based device reaches a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.71 mA cm−2 and a corresponding PCE of 15.22%, which is so far one of the highest among the single junction OSCs made with polymer donor PBDB-T. Overall, this work demonstrates that structural design of an A–D–A electron acceptor for tuning the π-conjugation of terminal groups can improve the exciton dynamics of blends and hence the PCEs of OSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthetic procedures of BTTPC and BTTPC-Br are shown in Scheme 1. Two terminal electron-deficient moieties, TPC and TPC-Br, were synthesized from 2,3-thiophene-dicarbaldehyde without and with 5-bromo groups through three steps. Target acceptors were achieved by a Knoevenagel reaction, yielding 62% BTTPC and 75% BTTPC-Br. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy were applied to confirm the structures of BTTPC and BTTPC-Br, as shown in Fig. S1–S7 of the ESI.† Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to study the molecular configuration and orbital distribution (Fig. S8 and S9†), indicating similar planar geometries for these acceptors. The structure of Y5 is shown in Fig. S10.† Terminal aromatics are designed to have alternative electron-deficient benzene and electron-rich thiophene (Fig. 1a and b), with the purpose to extend the conjugation length of the acceptor while promoting the stacking of end groups, likely in an anti-parallel dipole–dipole arrangement, and thereby facilitating charge transport in the solid.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of neat acceptor films and blends are shown in Fig. 1c, S11 and S12,† with the absorption onsets of neat films at 880 nm for Y5, 889 nm for BTTPC and 905 nm for BTTPC-Br. The enhanced absorption intensities of the 0–0 peaks (785 nm for Y5, 798 nm for BTTPC and 813 nm for BTTPC-Br) over 0–1 peaks (709 nm for Y5, 726 nm for BTTPC and 733 nm for BTTPC-Br) for BTTPC and BTTPC-Br films, compared with that of the Y5 film, indicate a strong aggregation tendency in the solid for new acceptors with extended terminal groups. In addition, the absorption coefficients of BTTPC and BTTPC-Br films were measured and are shown in Fig. S13.† Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves are shown in Fig. S14† and the energy level diagram of the active components is displayed in Fig. 1d, with HOMO levels of −5.55 eV for Y5, −5.54 eV for BTTPC-Br, and −5.47 eV for BTTPC-Br. The introduction of electron-rich thiophene into the terminal group leads to the extension of π-conjugation and the narrowing of the bandgap, without down-shifting the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), −3.78 eV (BTTPC) versus −3.82 eV (Y5), respectively. The further introduction of bromo atoms (Br) onto thiophene helps extend the conjugation of the terminal group via p–π hybridization between Br and the thiophene π-system and slightly downshifts the LUMO (−3.88 eV) of BTTPC-Br. Interestingly, despite possessing uplifted HOMO levels (smaller offset energies than Y5:PBDB-T), BTTPC-Br and BTTPC generally exhibit faster hole transfer in blends than Y5 (Fig. 1e), which will be elaborated later. The DFT calculated energy levels of the three molecules exhibit a similar tendency to the measured values (Table 1). Besides, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that the two new molecules have good thermal stabilities, as shown in Fig. S15.† Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) are 324 °C for BTTPC and 333 °C for BTTPC-Br, respectively.

With these data in hand, we firstly investigated their photovoltaic performance paired with the PBDB-T polymer donor, with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag, and the J–V characteristics are displayed in Fig. 2a. As a result, the device based on BTTPC:PBDB-T exhibits an excellent efficiency of 14.51%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 22.25 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73, as shown in Table 2. Meanwhile, a device based on PBDB-T:Y5 was made for comparison and detailed parameters can be found in Table 2 and Fig. S16,† which is similar to that in a previous report on Y5.39 Intriguingly, despite the higher HOMO of BTTPC than Y5, that is a smaller HOMO offset ∼0.09 eV (BTTPC:PBDB-T) versus ∼0.17 eV (Y5:PBDB-T), the Jsc values of the two devices are fairly close to each other, which is measured to be 22.31 mA cm−2 for Y5:PBDB-T. Remarkably, despite having similar HOMO offsets to the Y5 system, the PCE of the BTTPC-Br based device reaches 15.22%, which is one of the highest among PBDB-T based single junction OSCs, displaying a high Jsc of 24.71 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.86 V and FF of 0.71. It verifies that simultaneous introduction of thiophene and Br atoms onto the terminal groups is effective in improving the photovoltaic characteristics of acceptors. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices display a broad and intense photo-response from 300 nm to 900 nm, wherein the BTTPC-Br based device keeps over 75% EQE from 485 nm to 815 nm, corresponding to its high Jsc (Fig. 2b). The integrated current density values from the EQE spectra are 22.32, 21.89 and 24.34 mA cm−2 for the Y5, BTTPC and BTTPC-Br based devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with values obtained from the J–V curves (within 5% mismatch).

To understand reasons why higher quantum efficiency can be realized at smaller HOMO offsets for BTTPC-Br and BTTPC systems, we investigated the charge transport of each blend. The mobilities of the blends were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, as shown in Fig. S17 and Table S1.† The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of BTTPC:PBDB-T are 2.77 × 10−4 and 5.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while BTTPC-Br:PBDB-T blends exhibit slightly enhanced μh (3.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (6.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). These values are better than those of the Y5 system (μh of 1.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 2.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). As shown in Fig. 2c, the relationship of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of different devices was determined. The ratio of Jsc/Jsat (note that Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density when Veff is equal to 2.5 V) can be used to assess the exciton dissociation probability of different blends. The ratio values are 94.4% and 97.4% for BTTPC and BTTPC-Br based blends, respectively, indicating that devices based on BTTPC-Br are more efficient in exciton dissociation. In addition, the charge recombination of the devices was studied via measuring the dependence of Jsc to light density (Plight), as described by the power law equation Jsc ∝ Plightα (Fig. 2d). The exponent α represents the degree of bimolecular recombination, wherein both devices have an α closer to 1, suggesting negligible bimolecular recombination in these devices.
To gain insights into the excited state dynamics of blends, we have performed femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy to probe the photo-induced hole transfer of blends from the acceptor to the polymer donor at the interface and the results are displayed in Fig. 3, S18 and S19.† The steady-state absorption peaks for different acceptors and donors are well separated in the spectral domain; therefore both the spectral and temporal characteristics of hole transfer dynamics can be extracted. For probing hole transfer, an excitation wavelength of 750 nm was selected to excite only acceptors without exciting donors. For electron transfer, we rely on time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) as photoexcitation of the donor in fs-TA will inevitably excite the acceptor, which will complicate the analysis.

The color plot of fs-TA spectra of the PBDB-T:BTTPC-Br film after 750 nm excitation and a few representative TA spectra at indicated delay times are shown in Fig. 3a and S19a,† respectively. Fig. S19a† shows the TA spectrum of a neat BTTPC-Br film (gray circles) for comparison. The bleach peaks at ∼720 nm and 830 nm appear in both the neat BTTPC-Br film and PBDB-T:BTTPC-Br film, corresponding to the ground state bleach (GSB) and stimulated emission (SE) of absorption transition in BTTPC-Br due to photoexcitation. With the decay of the BTTPC-Br bleach peak at 700–850 nm, a few new bleach peaks at 580–650 nm emerge in the PBDB-T:BTTPC-Br film. These peaks at 580–650 nm match very well with the absorption features of PBDB-T films. As shown in Fig. 3d and S19a,† the bleach decay process of photoexcited BTTPC-Br agrees well with the rise process of the PBDB-T ground state bleach, confirming photoexcited hole transfer from BTTPC-Br to PBDB-T. Biexponential fitting yields lifetimes of τ1 = 10.02 ± 0.014 ps and τ2 = 8.458 ± 0.538 ps. The former ultrafast process can be assigned to ultrafast hole transfer from photoexcited BTTPC-Br to PBDB-T at the interface and the latter can be assigned to the exciton diffusion in BTTPC-Br towards interfaces followed by an interfacial hole transfer process.42 Similarly, the hole transfer process in the PBDB-T:BTTPC blend is studied and the results are shown in Fig. 3b, e and S19b.† The hole transfer also occurs biphasically with time constants of τ1 = 0.285 ± 0.045 ps and τ2 = 14.357 ± 1.630 ps. As a comparison, we also studied the hole transfer process in the PBDB-T:Y5 blend (Fig. 3c, f and S19c†) and the biphasic time constants are 0.444 ± 0.034 ps (τ1) and 14.875 ± 1.100 ps (τ2). We employed TRPL to detect the electron transfer process of blend films and the results (Fig. S19d†) indicate that all three blend films have a similar ultrafast electron transfer process. The above comparison shows that despite having a slightly higher HOMO energy level than Y5, the PBDB-T:BTTPC blend film exhibits a faster hole transfer rate, enabling a more efficient exciton separation process. The introduction of Br into BTTPC-Br provides similar HOMO offsets to Y5 and PBDB-T:BTTPC-Br shows the fastest hole diffusion and transfer, proving the most efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation among the three systems. These photophysical results are well consistent with the tendency of Jsc improvement of the respective devices.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was applied to study the film morphology and solid stacking of molecules in neat and blend films. Fig. 4 and S20† show the acquired two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding out-of-plane (qz) and in-plane (qr) intensity profiles. The pure PBDB-T film exhibits bimodal packing with (100) lamellar peaks observed in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions at q = 0.318 Å−1 (d = 19.8 Å) and 0.287 Å−1 (d = 21.9 Å), respectively. A very weak (010) π–π peak is observed at qz = 1.71 Å−1 (d = 3.64 Å). The pure acceptor films present predominant “face-on” oriented crystalline packing. The (100) lamellar peak of BTTPC is located at qr = 0.365 Å−1 (d = 17.6 Å) and that of BTTPC-Br is at qr = 0.371 Å−1 (d = 16.9 Å). And the (010) π–π peaks of BTTPC and BTTPC-Br appear at qz = 1.73 Å−1 (d = 3.64 Å) and 1.74 Å−1 (d = 3.62 Å), respectively. In blends, these acceptors generally exhibit nearly the same phase morphology and “face-on” stacking patterns, with slightly different positions of the (010) peak (qz = 1.73 Å−1 for the BTTPC:PBDB-T blend film and qz = 1.75 Å−1 for the BTTPC-Br:PBDB-T blend film, indicating the acceptor π–π stacking distances of d = 3.63 Å and 3.60 Å, respectively). While the literature reported that the film of PBDB-T:Y5 exhibited a π–π stacking distance of d = 3.63 Å (qz = 1.73 Å−1),39 the PBDB-T:BTTPC-Br blend film adopts slightly tighter “face-on” oriented π-π stacking, which facilitates vertical charge transport and reduces the charge carrier recombination, and finally enhances the performance of OSCs.

The surface morphology of the blends was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4c, d and S21.† The height images display that the values of root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of BTTPC:PBDB-T and BTTPC-Br:PBDB-T are 1.21 nm and 1.06 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, these images show that both blend films possess fiber-like networks, indicating continuous carrier transport channels.
Conclusions
In summary, two new terminal groups with extended conjugation were designed to develop electron acceptors, BTTPC and BTTPC-Br, in which thiophene and bromine units are employed to construct terminal aromatics. It is revealed that the modulation of the conjugation length effectively impacts the exciton dynamics of blends. In the presence of a smaller HOMO offset, the two new acceptors exhibit faster hole transfer at the interface in blends, which is 4 times (BTTPC-Br) and 1.5 times (BTTPC) faster than that of the Y5 system. Considering their similar absorption and blend morphology, as well as molecular orientation, the changes in exciton dynamics are mainly ascribed to the structural modulation of terminal aromatics with electron-rich thiophene. As a result, BTTPC based devices achieve a PCE of 14.51%, and BTTPC-Br based devices reach a good Jsc of 24.71 mA cm−2 and PCE of 15.22% with the PBDB-T polymer donor. From the above results, we reveal that the new structural design of electron acceptors facilitates exciton separation under small energy offsets, thereby improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.
