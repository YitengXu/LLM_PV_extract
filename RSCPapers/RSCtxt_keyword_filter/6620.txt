    , Accepted 14th July 2014First published on 16th July 2014AbstractThe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one important bottleneck in the development of economical photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting materials. To help address this we report the electrodeposition of Ni-doped FeOOH (Ni:FeOOH) as an OER electrocatalyst. The deposition method is applicable to a wide range of photoanodes and catalytic films as thin as a few nanometers can be easily grown. The Ni:FeOOH films with 5–20% Ni content reach 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M NaOH at an overpotential ranging from 420–460 mV initially, and improve with anodization at 10 mA cm−2 to below 400 mV. Deposition on triple junction solar cells results in a full PEC system with higher performance and a more cathodic peak power potential compared to undoped FeOOH electrocatalysts.
Introduction
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH− → 2H2O + O2 + 4e− in alkaline solutions) has been and continues to be one of the most widely studied reactions in electrochemistry. The OER's importance is derived from its relationship to energy storage and conversion, be it via photosynthesis,1 hydrogen production through water splitting,2 metal air batteries,3 or merely as the counter electrode to many cathodic processes in industry.4 As such, a large number of electrocatalysts for the OER are known.5–8 Unfortunately, because each specific OER application has different requirements, the best electrocatalyst material for each application is not necessarily the same. In the case of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting (2H2O → 2H2 + O2), a solar-to-chemical conversion process which shows promise for storing large amounts of renewable energy,9,10 OER catalysts are needed to improve the reaction kinetics; it is has proved difficult to find a material that efficiently absorbs light, transports charge, and has a low overpotential for the complicated multi-electron transfer processes required for oxygen evolution.11–14 The specific requirements an OER catalyst must meet for large scale PEC water splitting are optical transparency, a deposition process that is applicable to nanostructured and perhaps temperature sensitive substrates, and no precious metal content.
These PEC-specific requirements severely limit which electrocatalysts can be used, at least with currently known synthesis techniques. This has driven a number of groups to work on development of OER catalysts appropriate for PEC water splitting.8,15–21 Despite this welcome development, not every deposition technique is suitable for all substrates and there is evidence that specific catalyst/absorber interactions can be important determining factors for the overall system efficiency.22,23 For example, cathodic deposition of catalysts at high current densities18 could cause irreparable damage to many metal oxides used as photoanodes, or annealing16 could cause unwanted reactions to occur between substrate and catalyst. Of course, these potential concerns do not apply to all photoanodes – in some cases the electrocatalyst deposition conditions might even have beneficial effects on the photoanodes. Nonetheless, these considerations highlight the importance of having a large collection of PEC-ready OER catalysts and deposition techniques. We believe anodically electrodeposited Ni-doped FeOOH reported herein is a useful addition to the expanding OER catalyst library.
Experimental
Materials
FeCl2 (tetrahydrate, 99+%, Acros Organics), N-methylimidazole (99%, Acros Organics), NaCl, NaOH, Na2CO3 (all 99+%, Fisher Chemical), and NiCl2 (anhydrous, 98+%, Acros Organics) were purchased and used without further purification for all experiments. Substrates were fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass cleaned by sonicating in a Contrex detergent–ethanol solution for 30 minutes, or triple junction (TJ) amorphous Si (a-Si) solar cells from Xunlight Corp (no cleaning step).24 These cells are on a stainless steel substrate and the top layer is an indium-tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductor, this ITO is what the deposited OER catalyst is in contact with.
Electrodeposition
Deposition baths were adapted from reports on electrodeposition of iron corrosion products25 and our previous work on amorphous FeOOH as an OER catalyst.19 0.014 mol NaCl was dissolved in 35 mL of DI water (0.4 M NaCl). To this solution, 0.287 g (0.1 M) of N-methylimidazole (NMI) was added. Meanwhile, two separate solutions of 0.5 M FeCl2 and 1.0 M NiCl2 were prepared and appropriate amounts were added to the NMI solution to get the desired [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratio, the final FeCl2 concentration was always 5 mM, thus the final NiCl2 concentration varied from 0 to 90 mM. The solution pH dropped from 10 to between 8.7 and 7.0 depending on the final metal salt concentration. The baths were always freshly prepared and never used more than 3 hours after preparation. Deposition areas of ∼1 cm2 on FTO were masked off using electrical tape and the area of each film was determined to within ±0.005 cm2 using calipers prior to deposition and testing. Deposition on FTO was carried out between −0.2 V and −0.125 V vs. Ag/AgCl(1 M KCl) (no iR compensation, no stirring, lower [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratios were done at more negative potentials). It was found that baths with [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] from 0 to 5 could be deposited at −0.2 V, 7 to 12 at −0.15 V, and 15 to 18 at −0.125 V, with the values chosen based on a balance of repeatability of OER performance and reasonable deposition currents and time. Photoelectrodeposition on the a-Si solar cells was carried out under AM1.5G illumination at a potential of −1.0 V (the stainless steel potential, the ITO potential would be significantly positive of this value).
Physical characterization
A Quanta 650 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a Bruker XFlash 5010 detector was utilized for energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken with a Philips X'Pert diffractometer generating Cu Kα radiation operating in θ–2θ mode with a step size of 0.04° and an integration time of 4 seconds per step (0.6 degrees per minute). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired with a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer using a monochromated Al Kα source. A pass energy of 20 eV was used for high resolution spectra and 80 eV for surveys.
Electrochemical characterization
A Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) with Teflon frit from CH Instruments was used as the reference electrode for all tests. The potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode was periodically checked against a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and any observed drift was corrected by assuming the SCE was stable – the largest observed change in the Ag/AgCl potential was less than 6 mV. Most tests were done in 0.1 M NaOH (pH = 12.9, based26 on the tabulated mean ionic activity coefficient for NaOH) with overpotentials measured by holding at the desired current densities long enough for the potentials to stabilize, generally about 40 seconds, and recording the stabilized potential. The tests were done in an open beaker under rapid stirring to remove bubbles at high currents and to maintain constant pH at the electrode surface. The uncompensated resistance was measured using the built-in step-voltammetry method of the CHI potentiostat27 and used to manually correct the potentials for iR loss.
A Newport 150 W Xe arc lamp with collimating assembly and AM1.5 filter with the incident intensity set to 100 mW cm−2 as measured by a Newport thermopile detector was utilized to simulate solar illumination. The solar cells were held vertically in a PEC cell with an O-ring setting the illuminated and immersed area to 0.23 cm2. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference and Pt as the counter electrode. A peristaltic pump was used to continually circulate the solution (about 0.7 mL s−1) and remove bubbles from the film surface that would otherwise impact the tests. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were done at 50 mV s−1 and no difference in current as a function of scan direction was observed. Efficiency was calculated as. η(E) = (J(E) * (1.229 − E))/(100 mW cm−2)(1)where J is the current density in mA cm−2, E is the potential (in V vs. RHE), and 1.229 V is the thermodynamic potential stored in H2 that can be released upon oxidizing with O2. While this is the standard equation for efficiency calculation using a 3 electrode setup, it of course assumes no hydrogen evolution overpotential and thus represents an upper limit estimate.
Results and discussion
As with previous work on pure FeOOH grown under similar conditions,19 Ni-doped FeOOH films (Ni:FeOOH) are X-ray diffraction (XRD) amorphous, no differences between a bare FTO substrate and a ∼300 nm thick film are notable (Fig. S1†). To verify that any crystalline phases would be identifiable, we collected XRD patterns after annealing the same 300 nm thick film at 550 °C for 2 hours and easily detected hematite (α-Fe2O3) peaks – peaks for the possibly present spinel NiFe2O4 mostly overlap with the hematite peaks.
Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements of the Ni/(Ni + Fe) atomic ratio in the films as a function of the [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratio is shown in Fig. 1a. Note that even with no Ni in the bath, EDS still shows about 2% Ni/(Ni + Fe) in the film. This is an artifact of the quantification procedure, which is known to suffer limitations for low atomic concentrations, and this incorrect data point is shown to give a sense of the size of the error for the characterization equipment utilized. This artifact is less of a concern for higher Ni content since the algorithm is fitting an existing peak instead of noise at the given peak position. It is clear from the EDS data that Ni incorporation is rather inefficient – an 18/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratio during deposition (i.e., 90 mM Ni2+ and 5 mM Fe2+) only results in about 22% of the total metal sites being occupied by Ni (Fig. 1a). This low incorporation is even more apparent as the deposition potential is moved in a positive direction. The cause of this appears to be a mechanism whereby only Fe2+ species are directly oxidized and Ni2+ is only incorporated if it is near a Fe3+ species (generated by oxidizing Fe2+) as it joins the film – perhaps in a Ni–NMI–Fe polynuclear complex.28 Evidence consistent with this mechanism is shown in Fig. S2† – in cyclic voltammetry measurements NMI–Fe2+ is the only species that is oxidized at the deposition potentials considered, NMI–Ni2+ is inactive. The more anodic deposition potentials for higher [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratios were only used to get reasonable growth rates, above about 5 μA cm−2 (or ∼0.17 Å s−1) for most depositions. The deposition current drops for a constant potential as the [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratio increases due to competitive complexation of Ni by NMI.28
 Fig. 1  (a) Ni/(Ni + Fe) content of the deposited films as measured by EDS versus the [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ion ratio in the deposition bath. The vertical lines at 6 and 10.5/13.5 demarcate the deposition potential used for each region. Note that for 12/1 films, more positive deposition potentials lead to measurably lower Ni content in the film. (b) XPS trace of O(1s) region for a 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] film showing significant OH− and O2− features. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the surface composition Ni/(Ni + Fe) were consistent with EDS measurements of the bulk – 12.1 ± 0.1 at% versus 12.6 ± 0.9 at% for the same 9/1 films via XPS and EDS, respectively. Unfortunately, due to the Ni(2p) region's high binding energy (leading to high background signal) and the low Ni content, analysis of the Ni(2p) region for anything beyond quantification was impossible. The O(1s) region (Fig. 1b) shows two distinct peaks with the lower binding energy (BE) peak due to O2− and the higher BE peak attributable to OH−; there is also a small, third peak attributable to adsorbed H2O.29 The OH− content for Ni-doped films is significantly higher than for pure FeOOH,30 and this difference corresponds well to the measured Ni content if it is assumed that the Ni is in the 2+ oxidation state; the Ni/(Ni + Fe) from metal 2p ratios is 12.1 ± 0.1% and from OH−/(O2− + OH−) the ratio is 14 ± 4% assuming only Fe3+ and Ni2+ are present to balance charge. This is consistent with the prior evidence that Fe2+ is the only electroactive species during deposition, and the difficulty of preparing Ni in the 3+ oxidation state at potentials more negative than the onset of OER.26
SEM images confirmed that Ni incorporation (and thus deposition potential and current) did not have any measureable impact on the film morphology (Fig. 2). The observed morphology for all films suggests a large number of nucleation sites that grow with time and merge as more material is deposited. Additionally, the feature size of the Ni:FeOOH films is similar to the size of the features on the FTO substrate. It appears that this substrate roughness is reliably coated by the film and thus that this electrodeposition method could be used to coat rough surfaces, consistent with previous results for pure FeOOH deposited on conducting nanorods.31
 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) pure FeOOH, (b) 7/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] Ni:FeOOH, (c) 15/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] Ni:FeOOH, and (d) bare FTO substrate. Scale bar applies to all images. All catalyst films are indistinguishable and their roughness reflects the underlying roughness of the FTO substrate. 
The OER activity of Ni:FeOOH films on FTO at 1 mA cm−2 and 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12.9 as determined by the tabulated mean ionic activity coefficient26 – benchtop pH meters are inaccurate at such values) as a function of the [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratio of the deposition bath is shown in Fig. 3a (derived from galvanostatic plots as shown in Fig. S3†). All the films had 10 mC cm−2 of charge passed during deposition, equivalent to a thickness of around 35 nm – assuming approximately the same relationship between charge and thickness established for pure FeOOH. A monotonic and roughly linear decrease in the overpotential is seen as the Ni content of the films increases, a result consistent with the higher intrinsic OER activity of Ni oxides compared to Fe oxides.16,17 Based on this trend it is apparent that we did not achieve the optimum performance because no minimum in overpotential is seen. However, as noted above higher [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratios result in lower deposition currents, the 18/1 films grown here took about 1 hour each for just 35 nm of material. As a result of this it is not likely practical to use [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratios much higher than those shown here. Thus, the upper limit on performance is set by the deposition chemistry, which can hopefully be addressed in future work. While this limit is certainly a disadvantage, it should be noted that other work on (mostly) pure Ni(OH)2/NiOOH and CoOOH synthesized films by cathodic electrodeposition16,21,32 which is likely to harm many metal oxides commonly used as photoanodes. Therefore, the high activity of those materials (∼350 mV and 490 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for NiOOH and CoOOH, respectively) is somewhat offset by the difficulty of deposition on many materials germane to PEC water oxidation.
 Fig. 3  (a) Overpotential in 0.1 M NaOH (pH = 12.9) versus the [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratio in the deposition bath, all films are produced by passing 10 mC cm−2. Points and error bars based on at least 3 films deposited on at least 2 separate days, black points are at 1 mA cm−2 while red points are at 10 mA cm−2. (b) Representative comparison of stability of 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] Ni:FeOOH (black) and pure FeOOH (red) at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M NaOH. Both films are 10 mC cm−2 thick. 
For current densities applicable to economic use of PEC water splitting (greater than 8 mA cm−2), going from pure FeOOH to Ni:FeOOH only decreases the initial overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 by 3 to 12%. However, stability testing shows these values significantly underestimate the improvement due to adding Ni. The overpotential for pure FeOOH increases significantly over the course of stability testing, while 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] films show consistent improvement over the same time span (Fig. 3b). This data indicates that in 0.1 M NaOH the overpotential improvement offered by Ni-doping is closer to 30% and also, importantly, that the total OER overpotential falls to 400 mV at 10 mA cm−2. This threshold is important because it is a commonly assumed value for the OER overpotential in calculations of realistically achievable PEC efficiencies.11,33 It is interesting to note that the activity increase seen in the Ni-doped films occurs even without any change in the electrochemical surface area (Fig. S4†). Furthermore, both the undoped and 9/1 Ni:FeOOH electrocatalysts shown in Fig. 3b display no apparent physical degradation (Fig. S5†). The stability of Ni:FeOOH implies a high Faradaic efficiency for O2 production, if any electrochemical degradation process accounted for greater than ∼0.05% of the current, then over the course of an hour at 10 mA cm−2, a 10 mC cm−2 film would be entirely degraded. Determining the precise reason for the improved performance and stability with Ni doping is beyond the scope of this work. However, based on recent computational work on similar materials34 adjacent Fe and Ni sites work cooperatively to allow for a lower overpotential than pure Fe or Ni oxyhydroxides – our results are not contrary to this suggestion.

Fig. 4 shows the impact of thickness on the initial performance for 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] films, with the trend representative of the behavior of other doping levels. There is a slight tendency towards worse performance at 10 mA cm−2 as the films get thicker. While this is different than many other metal oxide catalysts this result is promising for coupling to photoanodes – because thinner layers absorb less light there is usually a tradeoff between catalytic activity and light blocking, however, for Ni:FeOOH generated by anodic electrodeposition, it appears that there is no such trade-off.

Because high activity on FTO does not necessarily translate into higher performance for OER catalysts coupled to light absorbers, we went beyond measurements of OER activity on FTO and electrodeposited Ni:FeOOH on triple junction (TJ) amorphous Si photovoltaic cells24 to test as a full PEC system. These cells were chosen due to their high current density relative to more realistic, but lower efficiency, materials such as Fe2O3 and BiVO4; additionally, using a higher current density is a more stringent test of the electrocatalyst's performance. This complete system test is important to demonstrate simple coupling of the catalyst to a light absorber and to ensure that the electrochromism (a change in light absorption behavior as a function of potential) shown by the Ni-doped films does not significantly offset the gains expected from increased catalytic activity35 – note that the difference in absorption with no bias is minimal (Fig. S6†). Fig. 5 shows typical efficiency versus applied potential traces for TJ cells with 2.5 mC cm−2 of either 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] Ni:FeOOH (tested in 0.1 M NaOH) or pure FeOOH (tested in 1 M Na2CO3 due to its instability in 0.1 M NaOH, see above) deposited. These plots are made assuming a perfect HER catalyst, so they should be interpreted as an upper limit and not necessarily as practically achievable. Nonetheless, the data is useful for comparing the utility of the different OER catalysts. The Ni-doped films outperform the pure FeOOH films at all potentials, reaching a peak power efficiency of 4.4% compared to 4.2% for pure FeOOH. Furthermore, the potential at which the peak efficiency is reached is shifted cathodically by ∼50 mV. This shift is important because in an unbiased two-electrode system the operating potential must be negative of 0 V vs. RHE by an amount equal to the overpotential of the hydrogen evolving electrode at the appropriate current density.

The traces are averages of 2 films. All 4 bare, TJ solar cells showed similar J–V characteristics in a test in sulfite solution before deposition of the respective catalysts. 
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully grown Ni-doped FeOOH via anodic electrodeposition which shows promisingly low OER overpotentials at current densities appropriate for realistic PEC systems (greater than 8 mA cm−2) – on the order of 400 mV. The Ni doping is achieved despite no active oxidation of Ni ions in the deposition bath, which leads to low incorporation efficiency. Despite this, the activity is quite high, on par with other Fe/Ni oxide materials recently investigated elsewhere. The films are stable under high current OER conditions, and show high activity for very thin layers (on the order of 10 nm), which should allow low parasitic light absorption compared to other OER catalysts for PEC water oxidation applications. We demonstrate these properties in an actual device utilizing a-Si solar cells as the solar absorbing material.

η(E) = (J(E) * (1.229 − E))/(100 mW cm−2)	(1)

 	Fig. 1  (a) Ni/(Ni + Fe) content of the deposited films as measured by EDS versus the [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ion ratio in the deposition bath. The vertical lines at 6 and 10.5/13.5 demarcate the deposition potential used for each region. Note that for 12/1 films, more positive deposition potentials lead to measurably lower Ni content in the film. (b) XPS trace of O(1s) region for a 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] film showing significant OH− and O2− features.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) pure FeOOH, (b) 7/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] Ni:FeOOH, (c) 15/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] Ni:FeOOH, and (d) bare FTO substrate. Scale bar applies to all images. All catalyst films are indistinguishable and their roughness reflects the underlying roughness of the FTO substrate.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Overpotential in 0.1 M NaOH (pH = 12.9) versus the [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] ratio in the deposition bath, all films are produced by passing 10 mC cm−2. Points and error bars based on at least 3 films deposited on at least 2 separate days, black points are at 1 mA cm−2 while red points are at 10 mA cm−2. (b) Representative comparison of stability of 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] Ni:FeOOH (black) and pure FeOOH (red) at 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M NaOH. Both films are 10 mC cm−2 thick.	 

 	Fig. 4  Comparison of initial overpotential for 9/1 [Ni2+]/[Fe2+] films as a function of thickness in 0.1 M NaOH at 1 mA cm−2 (black) and 10 mA cm−2 (red).	 

 	Fig. 5  Comparison of the overall power conversion efficiency – J (mA cm−2) * (1.23 − VRHE)/100 mW cm−2 – of Ni:FeOOH (black, 9/1, tested in 0.1 M NaOH) and pure FeOOH (red, tested in 1 M Na2CO3 due to instability in hydroxide) deposited on TJ a-Si solar cells. The traces are averages of 2 films. All 4 bare, TJ solar cells showed similar J–V characteristics in a test in sulfite solution before deposition of the respective catalysts.
