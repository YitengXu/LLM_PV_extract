Here, we conducted systematic research for the low-temperature fabrication of AOS by a solution route using amorphous NbOx as an example. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on a solution-processed amorphous ETL obtain a high power conversion efficiency of up to 19.09%, which is much higher than that of the PSCs using solution-processed AOS ETLs and even compare favourably with those using vacuum-processed ETLs.
Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are materials of great significance in electronics because of their high mobility, excellent transparency, tunable band gap, and low fabrication cost.1–4 Specifically, high-quality AOS films can be easily formed over large areas that exceed 1 m2 at low temperatures on various substrates, which enable them to be sufficiently competitive relative to their crystalline counterparts.2 Many successful applications of AOSs in the fabrication of thin-film transistors (TFTs) have been demonstrated, which proved them to be excellent candidates for switching or driving transistors in active matrix liquid crystal or active matrix organic light emitting diode displays.1,3 Meanwhile, AOSs have been developed into several other functional devices, such as gas sensors and electrochromic glass (known as “smart glass”).3,4 The use of AOSs as buffer or charge transport layers in new-generation solar cells, including MOx,5–7 NiOx,8 VOx,6 CuOx,9,10 WOx,5,11–14 NbOx,15–18 TiOx,19–26 SnOx,27–34etc., has rapidly increased in recent years.48,49
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which are an emerging photovoltaic technology, have demonstrated an incredible increase in efficiency from 9.7% in 2012 to 22.7% in 2017,35,36,50–54 which made them popular in the field of photovoltaics and attracted the interest of academic and industrial communities. Currently, one of the research studies on PSCs is the fabrication of flexible devices through low-temperature fabrication of functional layers. Electron transport layers (ETLs),55–57 such as TiO2,35,37,38 SnO2,39 and Zn2SnO4,40 used in high-efficiency PSCs are usually crystallized; their preparation constantly requires high-temperature annealing or hydrothermal/solvothermal procedures.41–43 The use of AOSs as an ETL for PSCs has been proven feasible and advantageous in low-temperature formation. Most AOS ETLs were fabricated by vacuum methods, such as sputtering, E-beam, or thermal depositions, which have the advantages of wide substrate selection, small impurity defects, good control of film thickness, and smooth film morphology.3,5,11,15,19,20,27,43,44 However, vacuum-based techniques usually require complex and expensive vacuum equipment, which limits their utility in low-cost device fabrication.
The advantages of wet chemical routes over vacuum techniques in the preparation of AOS-based ETLs are their low cost, ease of handling, and maneuverability in large area fabrication.10,13,14,28,29,32,33 By contrast, a large number of defects are formed within AOS films when they are prepared by wet chemical routes,22,23 and several obstinate defects of specific types cannot be eliminated simply by UV–Ozone (UVO, a powerful technique in post-treatment) treatment at low temperatures (<100 °C). These conditions have limited the popularization of solution-processed AOSs in PSCs. Thus, the efficiencies achieved by PSCs using solution-processed AOS-based ETLs were unsatisfactory, for example, 8.99 ± 0.41% for WOx,13 14.36% for SnOx,32 14.67% for TiOx,25 and 8.8 ± 1.15% for NbOx.17 Unfortunately, we cannot find any effective solution route in the literature to guide us in fabricating high-quality AOS films for efficient PSCs.
In the present study, we conducted systematic research for the low-temperature fabrication of AOSs by a solution route using amorphous NbOx. Several critical considerations, such as precursor type, solvent type, and controllable hydrolysis, were highlighted.43 Residual impurities were obstinate and were barely removed by UVO treatment when the precursor was a metal halide or the solvent was isopropanol (IPA). A high-quality amorphous NbOx ETL was obtained at room temperature (∼25 °C) through controlled hydrolysis and systematic chemical screening, which had higher conductivity and transmittance than a traditional TiO2 ETL annealed at 450 °C. Moreover, the conduction band (Ecb) levels of our NbOx ETL and perovskite were well-aligned, which minimized interfacial charge accumulation. PSCs based on a solution-processed amorphous ETL obtained high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 19.09%, which were much higher than those of the aforementioned cells and surpassed those of cells using vacuum-processed ETLs.15,16 Moreover, the amorphous NbOx ETL demonstrated excellent resistance against UV light due to its large band gap (>4.0 eV), which endowed the PSCs with good stability.45 Our work provided important guidelines for the low-temperature fabrication of high-quality AOS films in photovoltaics.

Fig. 1 shows the general considerations in preparing AOS films by a solution route, including the selection of metal precursor and solvent, the control of the chemical process during film formation, and the elimination of impurities and intrinsic defects during post-treatment. In the precursor solution, AOS film formation basically involves hydrolysis (or alcoholysis), cross-linking, and polycondensation.46 The post-treatment, such as by annealing, oxygen plasma, or UVO, is adopted to remove the residual impurities and modulate the energy levels of metal oxides by modifying the surface chemical composition. Precursor solution formulation and atmospheric humidity determine the surface roughness and the electronic and optical properties of final films.47 Various metal salt precursors, such as halides, nitrates, alkoxides, acetylacetonates, and carboxylates, can be used for the preparation of metal oxide films.46,47 These salts have different sensitivities toward moisture. For example, organic salts generally hydrolyze quickly under ambient conditions, which constantly result in an uncontrollable surface morphology.
 Fig. 1  General considerations in preparing AOS films by a solution route and the critical sol–gel process during film formation. 
We used NbOx to clarify the critical considerations for the room-temperature fabrication of AOS films by a solution route. The metal salts and solvents used in this work were NbCl5, Nb(C2H5O)5, ethanol (EA), and IPA. We first prepared two precursor solutions, NbCl5 (0.10 M) in EA and Nb(C2H5O)5 (0.10 M) in IPA, and the two resulting samples are named NbOx-1# and NbOx-2#, respectively. Spin coating was conducted at room temperature in air, after which UVO post-treatment was performed. The two samples were identified as amorphous films by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. S1†). Fig. 2a and b show that the two NbOx films are compact and can cover the conductive substrate (FTO) uniformly. We used the UVO-treated samples as an ETL and fabricated them into a planar PSC, in which they did not obtain high PCE, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The PCEs of NbOx-1#-UVO- and NbOx-2#-UVO-based PSCs are 7.98% and 10.64%, respectively. Meanwhile, a noticeable increase in photovoltaic performance was achieved by annealing amorphous NbOx films at 500 °C. The PCEs of the NbOx-1#-500 °C- and NbOx-2#-500 °C-based PSC are 16.36% and 15.67%. The dependence of PCE on high-temperature annealing (500 °C) of the ETL indicates that several impurities or defects cannot be removed by UVO treatment.

Component identifications were conducted through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Fig. 2e shows no obvious variation in chloride content, i.e., 13.07% for the fresh sample and 12.45% for the UVO-treated sample. By comparison, the chloride was effectively eliminated by annealing at 500 °C, and the content was largely reduced to 0.45%. Sample NbOx-2# was prepared by using IPA as a solvent. However, the ATR-FTIR results indicate that the alkyl and hydroxy groups are barely removed by UVO treatment, as demonstrated in Fig. 2f. Similar to the chloride residual in sample NbOx-1#, the organic impurities in sample NbOx-2# are only removed by high-temperature annealing, in which nearly no indication of an alkyl or hydroxyl group in the ATR-FTIR of NbOx-2#-500 °C is observed.
The above results indicate the importance of selecting the appropriate metal salt and solvent. Several counter ions or solvent molecules are too obstinate to be removed by UVO treatment. Chloride anions usually have a strong ionic interaction with metal cations, such as Nb5+. Meanwhile, IPA molecules cannot easily escape from amorphous NbOx, in which these C3 alcohol molecules are apt to be confined within the random network structure. The residual impurities usually affect the electrical properties (e.g., conductivity and defect concentration) of AOS films and the final photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The electron transport is reduced, and the charge recombination is pronounced when using an AOS-based ETL with abundant defects. The defect elimination by high-temperature annealing implies that such AOS films are unsuitable for fabricating flexible PSCs.
The third sample in our work was prepared using a precursor solution containing 0.10 M Nb(C2H5O)5 in EA. Compared with chloride, the organic C2H5O− anion has a weaker interaction with Nb5+. Meanwhile, EA, which is a C2 compound with a short molecular length, can easily escape from the amorphous NbOx network. In addition, the effect of atmospheric humidity on the surface morphology and the optical and electrical properties of AOS films was investigated in this section. We prepared different NbOx films under two humidity conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. First, fast hydrolysis was observed when AOS films were prepared under ambient air conditions (humidity was about 55%), and the resulting film had a rough surface.

By comparison, the film prepared in a glove box had a very smooth surface. The two samples are named NbOx-3#-R and NbOx-3#-S, where “R” and “S” stand for “rough” and “smooth”, respectively. The digital photos attached to the SEM images of Fig. 3a show the different appearances of the two films. The light transmittance of NbOx-3#-R was evidently low (see Fig. S2†). However, the ATR-FTIR measurement results showed that the organic impurities in NbOx-3#-R were nearly thoroughly removed by UVO treatment, which suggested that this sample could be a potential ETL candidate for the low-temperature fabrication of PSCs. NbOx-3#-R-UVO had higher conductivity than NbOx-1#-UVO and NbOx-2#-UVO due to its fewer impurity defects, as indicated by the Tafel curves in Fig. S3a.† As shown in Fig. 3c, the two J–V curves of the PSC using NbOx-3#-R-UVO and NbOx-3#-R-500 °C (annealed at 500 °C) were nearly coincident, which suggested that achieving high PCE did not depend on high-temperature post-treatment. By contrast, the PSC using NbOx-3#-R-UVO obtained a PCE of 15.15%, which was much higher than those of the PSCs based on NbOx-1#-UVO and NbOx-2#-UVO.
The above results imply that an amorphous NbOx is fabricated by a solution route at room temperature, which motivates us to conduct systematic research. As we have mentioned, NbOx-3#-S-UVO is an amorphous film with a smooth surface and high light transmittance and has similar conductivity to NbOx-3#-R-UVO (as indicated by the Tafel curves in Fig. S3b†). In comparison, the traditional crystallized TiO2 ETL was prepared (annealing at 500 °C). Another interesting finding was that the amorphous NbOx did not crystalize although it was annealed at 500 °C (Fig. S1†). Fig. 4a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the NbOx-ETL, TiO2-ETL, and bare FTO. A small slope was observed in the TiO2-ETL-based curve, which implied poor conductivity. By contrast, the bare FTO- and NbOx-based curves had large slopes, suggesting high conductivity. This result confirmed that the amorphous NbOx had higher conductivity than the crystallized TiO2, which was suitable in facilitating electron transport. Subsequently, the interfacial charge extraction dynamics between the perovskite and different ETLs was characterized by time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay measurements. As shown in Fig. 4b, the sample based on NbOx-3#-S-UVO exhibited faster PL decay than the sample using TiO2, which indicated that photo-induced electrons can be transferred more freely from the perovskite to NbOx-3#-S-UVO. This characterization confirmed that NbOx-3#-S-UVO had a better charge extraction capability than the TiO2-ETL, which alleviated charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface. Apart from high conductivity, the superior charge extraction capability of NbOx-3#-S-UVO was believed to be associated with the energy band structure.

As shown in Fig. 4c, we characterized the electronic states and energy band structures of TiO2, NbOx-3#-S-UVO, and perovskite layers with UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The perovskite Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95 used in this work had multiple compositions and was prepared according to the literature. The work function (Ws), valance band maximum (VBM), bandgap (Eg), and Ecb of the sample were determined (see details in Fig. S4 and S5†) by combining UPS and UV-Vis absorption results, and the energy level alignment at the interface was also analyzed. The Ws, VBM, and Eg of NbOx-3#-S-UVO (coated on FTO) were determined to be 4.21, 4.01 (Fig. 4c), and 4.03 eV (Fig. S4†), respectively. On the basis of the relationship Ecb = −(Ws + VBM − Eg), the Ecb of NbOx-3#-S-UVO was −4.19 eV, which was evidently lower than that of TiO2 (−3.74 eV). Similarly, the Ecb of the perovskite was determined to be −4.17 eV. As illustrated in Fig. 4d, a good band alignment was formed between the amorphous NbOx and perovskite because of their comparable Ecb levels (−4.19 eV versus −4.17 eV). Such good matching in the band structure is desired for PSCs because it provides an energy-barrier-free interface channel for the extraction of photo-induced electrons. By contrast, the Ecb level of −3.74 eV for TiO2 was different from that of the perovskite, which led to the formation of an evident energy barrier and was possibly responsible for the inferior charge extraction, as depicted by time-resolved PL decay in Fig. 4b.
In this study, the PSC architecture was planar, and the mixed perovskite was prepared using a typical one-step spin-coating method. The top-view SEM image of the mixed perovskite layer is shown in Fig. 4e, in which we can find several sub-micron crystals. Fig. 4f shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the planar PSCs. All functional layers were observable, and the perovskite was dense and had a uniform thickness of about 880 nm. The thickness of the NbOx ETL was about 25 nm. The J–V curves of champion PSCs based on TiO2 and NbOx are shown in Fig. 4g, with detailed photovoltaic parameters, and their average performance is summarized in Table 1. The PCE histogram attached in Fig. 4g was obtained from 25 TiO2- and NbOx-based PSCs. The average Jsc increased from 20.94 ± 0.71 to 21.41 ± 0.59 mA cm−2 (Table 1). This was consistent with the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) results for the two cells (Fig. S6†), in which the integrated Jsc of TiO2- and NbOx-based PSCs was 20.35 and 21.01 mA cm−2, respectively. The highest PCE achieved by the TiO2-based PSCs was 15.05% when measured under a reverse voltage scan, and the PCE decreased to 7.79% when measured under a forward voltage scan. Several possible reasons can be cited to interpret the hysteresis phenomenon (e.g., ion migration and transient ferroelectric polarization), and slow charge transfer kinetics was believed to be a predominant factor. Thus, the evident hysteresis observed in the TiO2-based PSCs was highly associated with the poor conductivity and energy level mismatch with the perovskite. By comparison, the NbOx-based PSCs achieved a high PCE of 19.09% under a reverse voltage scan, and the PCE dropped to 16.36% when measured under a forward voltage scan. As shown in Fig. 4g and S7,† the two J–V curves of the PSC using NbOx-3#-S-UVO and NbOx-3#-S-500 °C (annealed at 500 °C) were also nearly coincident, which further suggested that achieving high PCE did not depend on high-temperature post-treatment. Typically, the thickness of the NbOx film was controlled by varying the concentration of precursor solution. The J–V curves and detailed photovoltaic parameters of PSCs based on NbOx ETLs of different thicknesses are shown in Fig. S8.† The highest PCE achieved by the NbOx-3#-S-UVO-based PSCs was 19.09% when the concentration of the precursor solution was 0.1 M. Both relatively thick films and relatively thin films would reduce the PCE of solar cells. Especially, when the concentration of the precursor solution was 0.2 M, the PCE reduced significantly. It was conjectured that a thicker film would increase the device's overall internal resistance while a thinner one could readily lead to the exposure of FTO and direct contact between the perovskite and ETL, due to which the charge recombination could be promoted. Fig. 4h shows the steady-state output photocurrent and PCE of the two PSCs. The NbOx-based device provided a photocurrent of 17.68 mA cm−2 under a bias of 0.92 V and yielded a steady-state PCE of 16.23%. By comparison, the steady-state PCE of the TiO2-based PSC was 12.35% (photocurrent was 15.02 mA cm−2 under 0.82 V). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4g, the highest and average PCEs of the NbOx-based PSCs were much higher than those of PSCs using a traditional TiO2-ETL. In addition, the hysteresis phenomenon was alleviated due to the electrical superiority of the amorphous NbOx-ETL. We summarized several studies on amorphous ETLs that were used in PSCs developed so far, as listed in Fig. 5 and Table S1.† In general, the PCEs achieved by PSCs using amorphous ETLs were not high, i.e., usually 4.0–18.0%.12–17,19–27,29–34 In the present work, we demonstrated that the PSCs based on solution-processed amorphous ETLs obtained high PCEs that exceeded 19.0%. This result compared favourably with those of cells using vacuum-processed ETLs, and our work provided a low-cost strategy with good applicability.15

 Fig. 5  Several studies on amorphous ETLs that were used in PSCs developed so far. 
Currently, the long-term durability of PSCs remains a large obstacle in their practical popularization. Although thermal- or moisture-induced harmful factors have caused the decomposition of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, the interfacial degradation and its negative consequence have attracted significant attention. The ETL/perovskite is an interface that suffers from degradation. Among the functional layers, the ETL is the first to be illuminated by incident light. Thus, such high light intensity results in intrinsic excitation of the ETL, which causes several undesired photochemical processes, including perovskite photo-degradation. We evaluated the stability of TiO2-based and NbOx-based PSCs by continuously recording their photovoltaic parameters, as illustrated in Fig. S9.† No obvious PCE decline in the NbOx-based device was observed over 30 days, suggesting its good stability. By comparison, the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2-based device deteriorated seriously over the first 10 days. Obviously, the use of amorphous NbOx-ETLs endowed the PSCs with good stability. We speculated the degradation mechanism through XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 6. The two “half cells” prepared by perovskite deposition on FTO-TiO2 and FTO-NbOx were exposed to light illumination. The XRD results indicated that perovskite decomposition for the TiO2-based sample was more obvious than that for the NbOx-based device after light soaking for 25 h, as indicated in the variation of PbI2 diffraction peaks. Apparently, perovskite decomposition was caused by the photo-degradation effect of the ETL. Compared with amorphous NbOx, TiO2 was easier to be excited by UV light due to its relatively narrower Eg. Specifically, the TiO2 ETL acted as a photocatalyst under UV light to cause perovskite decomposition, which limited the extraction of photo-induced electrons and deteriorated the performance of PSCs. In this regard, the NbOx-based ETL had an Eg more than 4.0 eV, which cannot be excited easily by UV light, and effectively avoided interfacial degradation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we provided a rational strategy for the fabrication of high-quality AOS films by a solution route at room temperature. Specifically, we emphasized the critical considerations in eliminating the obstinate impurity defects by using the appropriate metal salt and solvent. We realized the fabrication of high-quality amorphous NbOx ETLs through controlled hydrolysis and systematic chemical screening. The results showed that this AOS film had higher conductivity than a traditional TiO2 ETL annealed at 500 °C. In addition, the energy band level of the NbOx ETL matched well with that of the mixed perovskite, which largely facilitated the interfacial electron transfer. The PSCs based on solution-processed amorphous ETLs obtained high PCEs of up to 19.09%, which was much higher than those of the aforementioned cells and even compare favourably with those of cells using vacuum-processed ETLs. The amorphous NbOx ETL provided the PSCs with excellent resistance against UV light due to its large band gap (>4.0 eV), which endowed the PSCs with better stability compared with those using TiO2-ETLs. Our work provided important guidelines for the low-temperature fabrication of high-quality AOS films in photovoltaics.
