    , Accepted 2nd May 2014First published on 8th May 2014AbstractFour novel Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes MH12–15 were synthesized and characterized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their photovoltaic performance including incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), total solar-to-power conversion efficiency (η%) and ground and excited state oxidation potentials and photoelectrochemical properties were evaluated on mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 and compared with the benchmark N719-dye under the same experimental conditions. MH12–15 showed stronger MLCT with significantly higher molar extinction coefficient for the lower energy absorption bands at 553 nm (27500 M−1 cm−1), 554 nm (34605 M−1 cm−1), 577 nm (23300 M−1 cm−1), and 582 nm (39000 M−1 cm−1), respectively, than that of N719 (14200 M−1 cm−1). The introduction of a cyclometallated ligand in dyes MH14 and 15 improved the optical properties and red-shifts of 24 nm and 28 nm, respectively, compared to the non-cyclometallated analogs MH12 and 13. The red shift in the UV-Vis spectra of MH14 and 15 can be attributed to the destabilization of the HOMO t2g of Ru(II). However, the destabilization of the HOMO furnished an upward shift of the ground state oxidation potentials (GSOPs) of MH14 and 15 at −5.44 eV and −5.36 eV against vacuum, respectively, which resulted in a driving force of only 0.22 and 0.16 eV for regeneration of dyes MH14 and 15, respectively. In the case of NCS analogs, MH12 and 13, the GSOPs, however, were −5.56 and −5.51 eV, respectively, which produced a driving force of more than 0.25 eV for dye regeneration. The nanosecond transient absorbance measurements showed that the time needed for the oxidized forms of MH12–MH15 to regenerate the neutral dye is 6 μs, 4 μs, 13 μs and 18 μs, respectively, compared to N719 (2.3 μs). These kinetic data confirmed that the weak thermodynamic force, small negative free energy (−ΔG), for regeneration of MH14 and 15 neutral dyes makes the dye regeneration process kinetically sluggish, which contributed significantly to the loss of both photocurrent and photovoltage. This study clearly elucidated that although cyclometallation may produce significantly better light harvesting, the driving force of less than 0.25 eV is not sufficiently enough for effective dye regeneration.
1. Introduction
The use of photovoltaic devices has increased in popularity as an alternative method to generate electricity from the sunlight. These devices function by converting solar photons into useful electrons through photoelectrochemical processes and ultimately produce photocurrent. Currently, the majority of photovoltaic cells are based on silicon because of their suitable physical and chemical properties. However, the main issue with these cells is the expensive processing cost to produce the pure silicon needed for optimum solar cell efficiency. Due to the high cost of production, silicon cells are limited in their ability to compete with fossil fuels and the emerging new PV technologies. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered as potential alternatives to traditional silicon solar cells because of their cost-effective solar-to-power conversion efficiency.1,2 So far the best performances in terms of solar-to-power conversion efficiency are shown by Ru(II) polypyridyl sensitizers3,4 attributed to their strong metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) properties,5–10 rich fluorescence behavior, stable ground and excited state potentials, and long excited state lifetime.11–14 However, most of the Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes show MLCT absorption bands in a narrow range of the solar spectrum, typically between 400 nm and 600 nm. In addition, the benchmark Ru(II) polypyridyl complex, known as N719, contains a labile thiocyanate (–NCS) ligand which is unstable towards light, and decomposes over time, which leads to a considerable loss in the device efficiency.15 Preferably, a sensitizer must be stable towards light and temperature16 at least for 20 years without significant loss of performance corresponding to a 50–100 million turnover of electron transfer reactions.17 Many attempts have been reported to replace these fragile ligands in order to increase the stability of DSSCs. Most recently, Bomben and Barigelletti reported several Ru(II) cyclometallated complexes that offer opportunity to circumvent the labile thiocyanate (–NCS) ligand and showed promising stability for dye-sensitized solar cells.18,19 A common approach for replacing the –NCS group is using cyclometallating ligands that increase the stability of the solar device, which also allows for fine tuning of the ground and excited state oxidation potentials, which may translate into higher conversion efficiency and better performance stability of DSSCs. This strategy was first demonstrated by Koten and co-workers by developing tridentate cyclometallated complexes, and they were able to achieve a maximum incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 70% at around 550 nm.20 Later, in 2009, Gräetzel and co-workers used a similar approach and developed a novel Ru(II) cyclometallated complex that exhibited a remarkable overall conversion efficiency of 10.1% and an IPCE efficiency of 83%. To date several cyclometallated complexes have been reported in the literature that exhibit an overall conversion efficiency more than that of the benchmark dye (i.e., η > 10%).13,21–23
Polypyridyl cyclometallated complexes consist of a central ruthenium(II) with an ancillary light harvesting ligand and anchoring groups and one cyclometallated ligand. Fig. 1 shows one of the novel cyclometallated Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes we developed recently in our laboratory and the principle mode of operation including sensitization and charge-injection from the dye into the conduction band of TiO2.

Further advancement of the cyclometallated complex, however, demands a better understanding at the molecular level to enhance the performance of DSSCs. With this in mind, we designed and developed four novel sensitizers coded MH12–15. MH12 and 13 contain a labile thiocyanate (–NCS) ligand and in MH14 and 15 the –NCS ligand is substituted by a 2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridine cyclometallated ligand while maintaining the same ancillary ligands of stilbazole-based bithiophene and terthiophene. The incorporation of an additional thiophene unit enhanced the molar extinction coefficient for both the π → π* and 4d → π* MLCT transitions. In addition, the high molar extinction coefficient offers the great benefit of reducing the amount of dye loading and film thickness of TiO2, which opens the door for high efficiency translucent DSSCs. The better light harvesting properties and the use of thinner layers of TiO2 facilitate more charge collection and a reduction in dark current, which translates into higher open-circuit photovoltage.31 The molecular structures of MH12–MH15 are shown in Fig. 2.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes
The solvents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific or TCI-America and used as received. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Fisher Scientific. The synthesis of all ligands and complexes was carried out using modified published procedures. The complexes MH12 and 13 were synthesized according to our previously published procedure,26 details are provided in the ESI.†
The Ru(II)cis[4,4′-bis-(2-[2,2′]bithiophenyl-5-yl-vinyl)-bis[2,2′]bipyridinyl-2,2′-bipyridinyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic-(2-(2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridine))] (MH14) complex was synthesized in dark under an argon atmosphere. In a 250 mL reaction flask a dichloro-(p-cymene)-ruthenium(II) dimer (0.556 g, 9.08 × 10−4 mol) and 2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridine (0.406 g, 1.816 × 10−3 mol) were dissolved in 100 mL of MeCN and then NaOH (0.073 g, 1.816 × 10−3 mol) and KPF6 (0.670 g, 3.638 × 10−3 mol) were added to the stirring solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at 45 °C for 45 h. MeCN was removed from the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator and a yellow-greenish product was collected which is purified by column chromatography using silica gel as the stationary phase and a mixture of CH2Cl2 and MeCN (98:2) as the mobile phase.
In the second step a 250 mL flask was charged using [(C^N)Ru (CH3CN)4 (2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridine)]+PF6− (0.400 g, 6.324 × 10−4 mol) and 4,4′-bis-(2-[2,2′]bithiophenyl-5-yl-vinyl)-[2,2′]bipyridinyl (0.339 g, 6.324 × 10−4 mol) using a DMF and C2H5OH mixture (100 mL, 3:2). The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at 70 °C and then the temperature was increased to 90 °C and [2,2′]bipyridinyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (0.190 g, 6.324 × 10−4 mol) was added and stirred for further 2 h under nitrogen. The DMF and C2H5OH mixture was removed from the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator. De-ionized water was added to a flask and neutralized using 0.01 M HNO3 to pH 7.03. The collected green product was filtered and purified by column chromatography, using Sephadex LH-20 as the stationary phase and pure methanol as the mobile phase. The purified product was hydrolyzed by refluxing for 48 h at 100 °C in DMF, H2O and triethylamine (50 mL, 3:1:1), the insoluble solid was vacuum filtered and washed using de-ionized water and ether. The product was dried overnight to give 80% yield with respect to the [(C^N)Ru (CH3CN)4 (2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridine)]+PF6− intermediate, the overall synthesis is shown in Scheme 1.

2.2. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis spectroscopy
An Edinburgh nanosecond laser flashphotolysis spectrometer (LP920) was used along with a Continuum Nd-YAG laser (Surelite; 10 Hz repetition rate; FWHM 5 ns) through a Surelite optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The output of the OPO was tuned at λ = 430 nm. The beam was expanded using a planoconcave lens in order to irradiate the sample at a large cross section (more than 1 cm2). The samples were oriented at a 45 degree angle to both excitation and probe beams. Transparent mesoporous TiO2 samples (thickness 6–12 μm) coated on glass substrates were dyed by adsorption of MH12–MH15 and N719 complexes overnight. Two drops of the LiI/I2 electrolyte were sandwiched between the samples and a thin microscope cover glass. The samples were immediately subjected to some few tens of mJ cm−2 of laser. Lower laser energies were avoided because they require a greater number of shots over a long period of time, which could lead to an early evaporation of the electrolyte. For that reason, we kept the same conditions of high laser energies for all experiments. The transient absorption spectra of the specimen were recorded at a probe light wavelength of λ = 577 nm, where the ground state bleaching of the dye occurs.

UV-Visible and emission properties

All four complexes showed a bathochromic shift and higher intense MLCT absorption bands in the visible region compared to those of N719. This can be attributed to the strong electron-donating ability of the ancillary ligands of bi- and terthiophene. In the cyclometallated complexes MH14 and 15, the light harvesting efficiency was significantly red shifted compared to that of thiocyanated (–NCS) complexes MH12 and 13. This can be attributed to the fact that the incorporation of a cyclometallated ligand (σ-donating ligand) destabilized the metal based HOMO more than that of the ligand based LUMO by increasing the electron density in the metal center. As a result, the overall HOMO–LUMO gap decreased considerably, which translated into a significant red shift in the absorption spectra.19,24,25Fig. 4 illustrates the changes in energy levels upon introduction of a cyclometallated center.
 Fig. 4  A schematic diagram of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in cyclometallating ligands that destabilizes the t2g of Ru(II) as a result the HOMO–LUMO gap decreases. The σ-donating ligand destabilized the metal-HOMO more than that of the ligand-LUMO by transferring the electron density to the metal center and imparts a bathochromic shift to UV-Vis spectra. 

MH12 and 13 showed lower energy MLCT bands at 553 nm (27500 M−1 cm−1) and 554 nm (34605 M−1 cm−1), respectively, while in the cyclometallated complexes MH14 and 15, the lower energy MLCT bands appeared at 577 nm (23300 M−1 cm−1) and 582 nm (39000 M−1 cm−1), respectively, which confirm their superior light harvesting efficiency compared to N719 (530 nm, 14200 M−1 cm−1). This remarkably high molar extinction coefficient can be attributed to the strong electron donating ligand and extended conjugation of the thiophene units coupled with one cyclometallation center. The UV-Vis absorption and emission results of MH12–15 are summarized in Table 1. The emission was measured in the steady state mode by exciting at the lower energy MLCT band (λmax) for each dye.

The UV-Vis spectral profiles of MH12–15 when anchored to TiO2 are significantly different from those in solution. The solution spectra in DMF solution showed two clear MLCT peaks in the visible region. However, upon anchoring to TiO2, both higher and lower energy MLCT bands in the visible region are overlapped to produce a broad absorption band covering the range from 350 nm extended to the near IR region with the cut off at 800 nm (Fig. 5).

Properties of ground and excited state potentials
The ionization potential (IP) and ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) of MH12–15 anchored to TiO2 film were measured using a photoemission yield spectrometer (Riken Keiki AC-3E), and the results are summarized in Table 2. The excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) of MH12–15 and N719 was estimated by subtracting the energy corresponding to the lowest electronic transition (E0–0) from the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) while neglecting the reorganization of geometry and energies in the excited state,27–29 according to eqn (1). ESOP = (G° − G+)ES ≈ (G° − G+)GS − E0–0(1)and/orESOP = GSOP − E0–0

The (G° − G+)ES and (G° − G+)GS are the free energy differences between the neutral and oxidized species at excited and ground states, respectively.
The experimental ionization potential values of MH12–15 and N719 were −5.56, −5.51, −5.44, −5.36 and −5.76 eV, respectively. The IP values confirmed that the energy difference in the Ru3+/2+ species of MH12 and 13 is significantly below the redox potential of I3−/I− (−5.2 eV), confirming that there is enough thermodynamic driving force for dye regeneration. On the other hand, in MH14 and 15, the thermodynamic driving force for dye regeneration was only 0.24 eV and 0.16 eV, respectively, which is not a sufficient driving force for the efficient regeneration of neutral dyes, which led to inferior photovoltaic performance.
The experimental excited-state oxidation potentials E* (Ru3+/*) of MH12–15 and N719 are −3.70, −3.66, −3.67, −3.58 and −3.77 eV, respectively, which lay above the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−4.2 eV),30 confirming the efficient electron injection from the excited state of the dye-sensitizer to the conduction band edge of TiO2. A schematic interrelationship between ESOP and GSOP of MH12–15 and N719 against TiO2 and the I3−/I− redox couple is illustrated in Fig. 6.

Photovoltaic device characterization
The photovoltaic performance of complexes MH12–14 against N719 on a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was studied under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The incident-photon-to-current efficiency conversion (IPCE) spectra are plotted as a function of wavelength shown in Fig. 7.

The IPCE spectra of the solar device containing MH12 and 13 demonstrated the most efficient sensitization over a broad wavelength range including the entire visible region and extended to the near IR region (ca. 830 nm). The IPCE value is over 85% in the plateau region. Despite the impressive molar extinction coefficient of both cyclometallated complexes MH14 and 15, they exhibited inferior IPCE values, which can be attributed to poor dye regeneration.
The photovoltaic characteristics of MH12–15 and N719 were studied using electrolytes with 0.0 M, 0.3 M or 0.5 M of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) used as an additive. The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and overall cell efficiency (η) for each solar cell were measured, and the results are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 8.

 Fig. 8  Photocurrent voltage characteristics of DSSCs sensitized with the complexes MH12–15 against N719. Electrolyte, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.05 I2 in acetonitrile (AN). 
Among the series of the named dyes, MH13 demonstrated the best DSSC performance showing a short-circuit photocurrent density of 20.58 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage of 0.660 V, and a fill factor of 0.715, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 9.71%. The Jsc value of MH12 (20.45 mA cm−2) is comparable to MH13 and still considerably higher than that of N719 (17.16 mA cm−2), which can be attributed to the better light harvesting efficiency throughout the visible region and the NIR region up to 830 nm. However, the overall conversion efficiency of MH12 (8.83%) is lower than that of N719 (9.32%) which is attributed to poor charge separation (Voc) at the interface of dye/TiO2/electrolyte and/or recombination reactions at the interfaces of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte. The Voc and FF of MH13 are higher than those of MH12, which can be attributed to the larger molecular size and higher molar extinction coefficient of the former, which translate into less dye on thinner film of TiO2, and that could facilitate more charge collection and a reduction in dark current and enhanced performance of DSSCs. However, inferior photovoltaic performance was observed for MH14 and MH15 in both photocurrent and photovoltage, which can be attributed to the weak thermodynamic driving force of 0.24 and 0.16 eV, respectively, for neutral dye regeneration.
Excited and ground state dynamics
In order to scrutinize the dynamics of dye regeneration of MH12–15 by the electrolyte, we performed nanosecond time-resolved laser experiments at the TiO2/dye/-electrolyte interface. Transient absorbance measurements shown in Fig. 9 monitor directly the time needed for different oxidized dyes to regenerate the neutral dye by a reduction process from LiI/I2 redox species present in the electrolyte, and this experiment was performed in comparison with N719 dye regeneration time under the same experimental conditions. The complexes MH12 and MH13 showed a comparable lifetime decay of 6 μs and 4 μs, respectively, for dye regeneration compared to N719 (2.3 μs).32 This could be one of the mains reasons why MH12 and MH13 achieved significantly higher photocurrent. Under the same experimental device conditions, MH14 and MH15 showed slower dye regeneration decay lifetimes of 13 μs and 18 μs, respectively, which explain the inferior photocurrent performance of these dyes. Based on results presented in Fig. 6, compared to the energy values of the GSOP of MH12 and MH13 with respect to the redox potential of the electrolyte, complexes MH14 and MH15 exhibited much less thermodynamic driving force for electron replenishment to regenerate the neutral dye. Hence, it can be confirmed that the low driving force for MH14 and MH15 is most likely the main reason for the inferior short-circuit photocurrent density observed.
 Fig. 9  Transient absorbance decay profiles obtained upon nanosecond pulsed laser excitation at λ = 430 nm (for MH dyes) and λ = 430 nm (for N719 dye), in the presence of the LiI/I2 electrolyte of mesoporous TiO2 films sensitized with (a) MH12; (b) MH13; (c) MH14; (d) MH15 and (e) N719. 
Conclusions
The incorporation of a cyclometallated ligand in a Ru(II) polypyridyl moiety (MH14 and 15) produced a considerable red-shift of 24 nm and 28 nm in the low energy MLCT band compared to those of non-cyclometallated analogues MH12 and 13, respectively. Despite impressive molar extinction coefficient and red shift in MH14 and 15, they exhibited inferior photovoltaic performance because the thermodynamic driving forces for dye regeneration of MH14 and 15 were less than 0.25 eV, which demonstrates clearly that the driving force for dye regeneration must be at least 0.25 eV. Furthermore, it was demonstrated, using nanosecond transient absorbance measurements, that the time needed for the oxidized forms of MH12–MH15 to regenerate the neutral dye by gaining an electron from the electrolyte is 6 μs, 4 μs, 13 μs and 18 μs, respectively, compared to N719 (2.3 μs). These data confirmed that the weak thermodynamic force, small negative free energy (−ΔG), for regeneration of MH14 and 15 neutral dyes makes the dye regeneration process kinetically sluggish, which contributed significantly to the loss of photocurrent and photovoltage. Among MH12–15, it was also shown that MH13 achieved the best photovoltaic performance, and it outperformed N719 by 58% in molar absorptivity, 17% in photocurrent, and 6% in total conversion efficiency under the same experimental device conditions. Therefore, fine tuning of the HOMO of MH14 and 15 coupled with their inherent superior light harvesting capabilities could lead to a novel generation of superior panchromatic sensitizers that may exceed 12% total conversion efficiency.
