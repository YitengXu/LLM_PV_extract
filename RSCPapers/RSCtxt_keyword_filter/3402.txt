    , Accepted 22nd April 2012First published on 24th April 2012AbstractHere we report the synthesis of two new alternating co-polymers of thiophene and selenophene flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole with dithienothiophene. We find that the inclusion of the rigid fused dithienothiophene co-monomer affords semi-crystalline polymers, that exhibit promising ambipolar field effect transistor performance, with hole mobilities up to 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1. The selenophene containing co-polymer exhibits a reduced band gap compared to the thiophene co-polymer, as a result of stabilisation of the polymer LUMO and destabilisation of the HOMO. The thiophene co-polymer exhibits promising solar cell performance in blends with PC71BM, with device efficiencies up to 5.1%.
Introduction
There has been much interest in the development of low band gap conjugated polymers for a variety of applications such as organic field effect transistors and photovoltaic devices.1 Although a variety of approaches to low band gap materials have been reported, one of the most promising is co-polymerisation of electron rich aromatic monomers with electron poor monomers to give so-called donor–acceptor polymers. The resulting polymers exhibit low band gaps due to hybridisation of the molecular orbitals, with the LUMO typically being dominated by the electron accepting unit and the HOMO by the donor material.2 Within the class of donor–acceptor materials, polymers incorporating diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the electron accepting unit have shown much recent promise in both photovoltaic and transistor applications.3
A variety of polymers containing DPP units flanked with thiophene (DPP-T),4 furan,5 thieno[3,2-b]thiophene6 and phenyl7 have recently been reported. Co-polymerisation of these monomers with a wide variety of electron rich and electron poor co-monomers has led to materials exhibiting unipolar mobility as high as 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1,6,8 ambipolar performance with high (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and balanced electron and hole mobility,9 and donor polymers exhibiting solar cell efficiencies up to 6.5% (ref. 10) in blends with fullerene derivatives.
As part of our investigations into selenophene containing polymers we recently reported DPP cores directly flanked with selenophene (DPP-Se) exhibiting promising ambipolar device performance. Co-polymers with selenophene and benzothiadiazole exhibited high and balanced electron and hole mobilities up to 0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 in bottom and top gate devices after relatively low temperature annealing.11,12 As part of our continuing investigations into these selenophene containing materials, and inspired by the recent reports of promising solar cell or ambipolar device behaviour of DPP-T when polymerised with large fused aromatic co-monomers,13 we hereby report a direct comparison of the properties of thiophene and selenophene flanked DPP monomers co-polymerised with dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)thiophene (DTT). DTT is a rigid, electron rich unit containing two thiophene rings fused by a bridging sulfur atom. The planarity and S–S interaction of DTT have previously been found to promote highly ordered π-stacked structures and high hole mobilities.14 We note that random co-polymers of DTT-T and alkylated DTT have recently been reported to show promising OPV behaviour,15 whereas alternating co-polymers of DPP and alkylated DTT have been reported to show rather low efficiencies.16 We find that the inclusion of DTT leads to polymers with promising charge carrier mobilities and good solar cell efficiencies in blends with fullerene derivatives. Furthermore we find that replacement of thiophene with selenophene results in a reduction in optical band gap, but a loss of open circuit voltage and therefore organic solar cell performance.
Experimental
General
Reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and Acros unless otherwise noted. All reactions were performed under argon using solvents and reagents as commercially supplied. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz), using the residual solvent resonance of CDCl3 or TMS as an internal reference, and are given in ppm. Microwave experiments were performed in a Biotage initiator V 2.3, and the reaction time was commenced once the indicated temperature had been reached. Number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights were determined by an Agilent Technologies 1200 series GPC running in chlorobenzene at 80 °C, using two PL mixed B columns in series, and calibrated against narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with a Thermo Electron Corporation DSQII mass spectrometer. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a UV-1601 Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrometer. Flash chromatography (FC) was performed on silica gel (Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 230–400 mesh). Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were obtained using a cylindrical platinum working electrode and a platinum mesh counter-electrode in acetonitrile at a potential scan rate of 100 mV−1 s−1. Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode and calibrated against ferrocene (assumed to be 4.8 eV below vacuum level). All the measurements were carried out in an argon-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out with a PANALYTICAL X' PERT-PRO MRD diffractometer equipped with a nickel-filtered Cu-Kα1 beam and a X' CELERATOR detector, using current I = 40 mA and accelerating voltage V = 40 kV. Samples were prepared by drop casting from 5 mg mL−1 hot chlorobenzene solutions.
FET fabrication and characterization
Polymers P1 and P2 were characterized by using the top-gate/bottom-contact (TGBC) FET configuration. Specifically, the gold source and drain bottom electrodes (with Cr as the adhesion layer) were patterned by photolithography on clean low-sodium glass substrates. A layer of P1 and P2 was then deposited on top by spin coating a polymer solution in anhydrous 1,2-dichlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1) at a speed of 1500 rpm for 120 s and annealed at the designated temperatures for two hours before cooling down to room temperature. Subsequently, a PMMA solution (45 mg mL−1 in n-butyl acetate) was then spin-coated onto the semiconducting polymer resulting in a dielectric layer of ∼500 nm thick. Gold gate electrodes (20 nm) were evaporated through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation. After the semiconductor deposition, all procedures and measurements were carried out inside a dry nitrogen glove box. Mobility values quoted in the text are averaged over typically 5–10 individual devices prepared under the same conditions.
OPV fabrication and characterization
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol, followed by drying and oxygen plasma treatment. A 30 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) was spin-coated onto the plasma-treated ITO substrate and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. An 80 nm active layer consisting of a 1:2 blend of P2 (5 mg mL−1) and [70]PCBM (10 mg mL−1, Solenne) dissolved in chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) (4:1 v/v) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer and then a LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm) cathode was finally deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (10−6 mbar) through a shadow mask. The pixel size, defined by the spatial overlap of the ITO anode and LiF/Al cathode, was 0.045 cm2. The device characteristics were obtained using a xenon lamp at AM1.5 solar illumination (Oriel Instruments).
2,6-Bis(trimethylstannyl) dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)thiophene
A solution of n-butyllithium (10.2 mL, 24.5 mmol, 2.5 M in hexane) was added slowly to dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)thiophene (2 g, 10.2 mmol) in THF (35 mL) at −78 °C. After addition, the mixture was stirred for 30 min at −78 °C, then warmed to 0 °C and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was cooled to −78 °C again. Trimethyltin chloride solution (25.6 mL, 25.5 mmol, 1.0 M in hexane) was added to the mixture. The mixture was warmed to room temperature and was stirred overnight. The reaction was quenched with the addition of water and the mixture was extracted with diethyl ether three times. The combined organic layer was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by recrystallization with acetonitrile to afford off-white crystals (2.2 g, 42%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) 7.49 (s, 2H), 0.45 (s, 18H).

To a 2 mL microwave vial were added 2,5-di(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis-(5-bromothiophenyl)-1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole 4 (0.20 g, 0.196 mmol), 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl) dithieno(3,2-b;2′,3′-d)thiophene (0.102 g, 0.196 mmol) and chlorobenzene (2 mL). The solution was degassed before addition of Pd2(dba)3 (3.6 mg, 3.9 μmol, 2 mol%) and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 12 μmol, 6 mol%). The reaction mixture was further degassed and subsequently sealed. The vial was heated in a microwave reactor at 100 °C (2 min), 140 °C (2 min), 170 °C (2 min) and 200 °C (30 min). After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was added to vigorously stirred methanol (200 mL), filtered and washed with methanol (2 × 25 mL). The polymeric material was purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone (24 h) and hexane (24 h). The resulting residue was dried in vacuum and dissolved in chloroform by heating and stirring. To the chloroform extract was added an aqueous solution of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (∼1 g per 100 mL) and the mixture was heated to 60 °C with vigorous stirring for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the layers were separated and the organic fraction was washed with water (2 × 250 mL), and concentrated in vacuum. The resulting residue was dissolved in a minimum amount of chloroform and added dropwise to vigorously stirred methanol (250 mL).

Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
The thiophene and selenophene containing monomers 2,5-di(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis-(5-bromothiophenyl)-1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole and 2,5-di(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis-(5-bromoselenophenyl)-1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole were prepared according to the published procedures.12 Long and branched alkyl chains were introduced in order to achieve maximum solubility. The two copolymers, PDPPDTT (P1) and PSeDPPDTT (P2), were synthesized under microwave-assisted Stille coupling conditions in chlorobenzene (Scheme 1).17 The resulting polymers were purified by precipitation into methanol followed by Soxhlet extraction of low molecular weight materials and ligand residues using acetone and hexane. Residual catalytic metal impurities were removed by heating and vigorous stirring of a chloroform solution of the polymers in the presence of aqueous sodium diethyldithiocarbamate.18 Following a final precipitation of the concentrated chloroform solutions, the two polymers were obtained as dark green powders. Both polymers were soluble in chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene on heating. Relatively high molecular weights against polystyrene standards were obtained in both cases by GPC measurements in chlorobenzene at 80 °C (Table 1). The measurements were performed with highly dilute solutions in order to minimise any aggregation effects, nevertheless the polymer demonstrated a high propensity to aggregate in chlorobenzene, even upon warming, so the measurements may be overestimated.

Optical and electrochemical properties
In dilute chlorobenzene solution (∼1 × 10−5 M), both polymers display broad absorptions with maxima at 803 nm for P1 and 830 nm for P2. Both polymers exhibit a shoulder at shorter wavelengths. Upon film formation, the absorption of P1 broadens with an increase in intensity of the shoulder at 760 nm and a small blue shift of λmax. For P2 the film absorption becomes very broad, with the former shoulder at 795 nm now increasing significantly in intensity. The broad absorption results in a slightly misleading large apparent blue shift in λmax due to the changes in relative intensity of both peaks. The similarity between the solution and thin film spectrum suggests that the polymers are already aggregated in chlorobenzene at room temperature. Previous studies have suggested that elimination of these pre-aggregated states by the use of very good solvents may improve device performance. However all solvents that we tested (chloroform, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene) displayed similar signs of aggregation at room temperature (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  UV/Vis spectra of P1 (left) and P2 (right) as solutions in chlorobenzene (black line) and as spin coated films (red line). 
In comparing P1 and P2, we observe that in agreement with other studies,12,19 the incorporation of selenophene results in a red shift of absorption both in solution, and in the solid state, taking into account the vibronic peaks. The optical band gaps, taken from the onset of solid state absorption, are quite similar, 1.27 eV and 1.25 eV for P1 and P2 respectively.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both polymers in thin film were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 electrolyte solutions in dry acetonitrile. The cyclic voltammograms of the polymers are shown in Fig. 2 and clearly indicate a reversible oxidation and a partially reversible reduction process. The HOMO and LUMO levels for P1 and P2, calculated by the onset of oxidation and reduction respectively, are 5.17 eV and 5.09 eV, and 3.53 eV and 3.59 eV, corresponding to electrochemical bandgaps of 1.64 eV and 1.5 eV. These results demonstrate that the replacement of thiophene with selenophene results in a significant reduction in band gap, both through a reduction of oxidation potential and an increase in electron affinity, in agreement with other studies20 (Table 2).

Thin film morphology
The ordering of thin films of P1 and P2 was investigated by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Films were prepared by drop casting hot chlorobenzene solutions, followed by drying under vacuum. The drop-cast polymer thin films show a relatively broad reflection peak at 2θ = 4.79° and 4.59° (θ is the diffraction angle), corresponding to a d-spacing of 18.42 and 19.22 Å for P1 and P2 respectively (Fig. 3). In analogy with previous DPP polymers, we propose that the polymers are packed in a lamellar structure with a predominately edge-on arrangement of the conjugated backbones.21 Annealing at 240 °C and 300 °C led to a narrowing of the lamellar (100) peak and an increase in intensity, along with the appearance of second (200) and third (300) order diffraction peaks, all suggesting that the order of the film increases with annealing, with the highest order being for the film annealed at 300 °C. Annealing also results in a slight increase in lamellar spacing for both polymers, to 18.94 and 19.52 Å for P1 and P2 respectively, which is probably related to side chain ordering. The differences in lamellar spacing reflect the slight distortions to the polymer backbone that the incorporation of selenophene, with its larger C–Se bond, induces relative to thiophene. For example the optimised geometry calculations (see below) suggest that the distance between the alkyl chains (the repeat unit length) increases slightly upon selenophene inclusion from 19.5 to 20.3 Å.

Theoretical calculations
In order to further understand the electronic properties of the polymers, their properties were modeled using density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Calculations were performed on trimers with the alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups for simplicity, since longer alkyl chains are not expected to have a significant influence on the electronic properties. Ground state geometries were first optimized at the DFT level, assuming an all trans configurations of the DPP thiophene/selenophene rings and DTT, prior to electronic structure calculations. The calculated HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions of P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. 4. Both polymers show similar distributions for both the HOMO and LUMO. The calculations also show that the LUMO is relatively well delocalized along the backbone, and is not strongly localized upon the electron deficient DPP core.

The calculated HOMO levels for P1 and P2 are −4.71 and −4.70 eV respectively, with LUMOs of −2.95 and −2.99 eV. These are qualitatively in agreement with the observed experimental results that the replacement of thiophene with selenophene results in reduction of band gap by about 0.1 eV. However they do not predict the significant differences observed in experimental ionization potential. Here, note that the calculations are performed on isolated molecules in the gas phase, whereas experimental results are for thin films. Molecular orientation and packing effects such as tilt angle between aromatic planes are known to influence the ionisation potential and electron affinity to a different extent and have also been shown to vary in magnitude according to the heteroatom.11
Interestingly we also observed that the geometry of the adjacent heterocycle with respect to the DPP core had a subtle influence on the predicted energy levels. Thus, for example, if the heteroatom of the adjacent heterocycle (thiophene or selenophene) was facing the lactam nitrogen of the DPP (see ESI‡), rather than the carbonyl as in Fig. 4, then the calculated HOMO values were basically unchanged but the LUMO for P1 was stabilised by 0.09 eV to −3.04 eV, whereas for P2 it was stabilized by 0.08 eV to −3.07 eV. Models with mixed geometries had intermediate values. This suggests the relative polymer conformation may be more important for electron transport than hole transport, especially for thiophene based polymers.
Field effect transistors
Top gate/bottom-contact OFETs with gold source–drain electrodes (Fig. 5) were used to test the charge transport behaviour of P1 and P2. Ambipolar charge-transport was observed in both P1- and P2-based OFETs studied in this work. Fig. 5 displays typical transfer characteristics of P1 and P2 based OFETs (L = 20 μm, W = 1 mm) at different source–drain voltages (Vds). The spin coated films were annealed at 100 °C. The OFETs show proper modulation of the current with an ON–OFF ratio of ∼102 to 104 (Table 3). The extracted average saturation hole and electron mobilities were equal to 0.23 and 0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for P1 and equal to 0.13 and 0.010 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P2. Annealing of the films at higher temperatures resulted in a degradation of the mobilities, despite the apparent increases in the thin film crystallinity observed by XRD. The dependence on temperature is very similar for P1 and P2. The output characteristics shown in Fig. 5 show little non-linearity at low source–drain bias. This indicates that a small injection barrier is present for injection of holes.

Both polymers P1 and P2 predominantly show p-type transport. The hole mobilities are an order of magnitude higher than electron mobilities. Substitution of sulphur by selenium has previously been shown to increase the electron transport properties of conjugated polymers, with hole transport affected to a much lesser extent.11,12 In the current case, the absence of any significant effects of selenophene substitution on electron transport may be due to the fact that the transport is predominantly p-type, in addition to the fact the influence of selenophene is diluted by the incorporation of the fused DTT unit.
Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of these polymers, bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) solar cells with a conventional device structure consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al were prepared and tested under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. The J–V curves and external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) are presented in Fig. 6. The corresponding open-circuit voltages (VOC), short-circuit currents (JSC), fill factors (FF) and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) are summarized in Table 4. Fig. 6 shows the EQE of the best devices of each blend ratio as a function of wavelength, and is consistent with the polymer–fullerene blend UV-Vis absorption spectra.

OPV devices were fabricated with polymers P1 and P2 by spin-coating of a 1:2 wt% polymer–PC71BM blend mixture in a 4:1 chloroform–o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution onto an ITO:PEDOT substrate followed by evaporation of LiF/Al as a back-contact. The blend and solvent ratios were based upon our previous investigations into thienothiophene substituted DPP polymers.6
Devices based on P1 and P2 polymers gave very similar short-circuit currents (Jsc) of ∼11 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6). Examination of the EQE spectra clearly shows the contribution of both polymers to current generation in the region above 700 nm, where PC71BM absorbs poorly. P2 has a slightly longer wavelength onset than P1. For both polymers the efficiency peaks at about 45% around 500 nm, near the absorption maxima of PC71BM.22 Difference in device performance mainly comes from the open circuit voltage (Voc), with P1 demonstrating a voltage of 0.63 V, whilst P2 shows 0.53 V. The reduction in cell voltage is in agreement with the lower reduced ionisation potential of P2. The fill factors (FF) for both blends are reasonably good, and are probably a reflection of good phase separation occurring in the as spun films. The high FF for P1, in combination with the good voltage, results in a promising overall device efficiency of 5.1%. This compares reasonably to other DPP co-polymers,3 and further improvements may be expected from optimisation of the device morphology.
Conclusions
In conclusion here we report dithienothiophene co-polymers of thiophene and selenophene substituted DPP. Both polymers exhibit reasonable solubility, despite the inclusion of the rigid aromatic DTT co-monomer. We find that selenophene inclusion results in a reduction in band gap, as a result of stabilisation of the LUMO and destabilisation of the polymer HOMO. Both polymers form semicrystalline thin films, and exhibit ambipolar behaviour in field effect transistors, with hole mobilities up to 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1, and electron mobilities around 0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1. Solar cell devices fabricated from blends with PC71BM exhibit promising device efficiencies up to 5.1% for the thiophene containing polymer. The introduction of selenophene results in a reduction in device performance, mainly due to a reduction in the open circuit voltage of the cell.
