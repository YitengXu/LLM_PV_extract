    , Accepted 18th January 2023First published on 20th January 2023AbstractPoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) shows great potential for applications in tin halide perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Nevertheless, the physicochemical, electrical properties and surface characteristics of pristine PEDOT:PSS are poorly suitable for high-quality tin halide perovskite films, as well as for efficient carrier transport. In this work, we tuned the phase separation of PEDOT and PSS chains by ammonium carbamate (AC). The modified film showed a lower trap density and more facile carrier transport than did the pristine film. Consequently, the target TPSCs achieved a substantially improved short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc), together with a markedly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 9.48% to 11.24%.
Since their first report in 2009,1 organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great research attention, leading to a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of as high as 25.7%, superior to those of the well-established cadmium telluride (22.1%) and polycrystalline silicon solar cells (23.3%).2 However, the toxicity of lead and the ensuing environmental and health concerns hamper its commercialization.3,4 Of the many studied analogues, tin halide perovskites with high absorption coefficients,5,6 low exciton binding energy levels and high theoretical PCE limits7 have become viable alternatives for the widely investigated lead-based PSCs.8
Generally, the hole-transport layer (HTL) is a necessary component of PSCs. As a commonly used hole-conducting polymer in photoelectric devices,9 PEDOT:PSS has excellent photoelectric properties, mechanical stability, and low-temperature processability. Particularly, the hydrophilic PSS presents a long chain structure with a loose gel network, which contributes to the dispersion of water-insoluble PEDOT fragments.10 The unique cross-linked gel network structure of PSS endows PEDOT:PSS with photoelectric stability, solubility, and transparency superior to that of other conductive polymers.11 The longer PSS strands, wrapping around the short-chain PEDOT domain to form a core-shell structure, reduce the conductivity of the network and block its carrier transport. Meanwhile, the surface topography often subtly influences the generation of defect sites and charge recombination probability at the interface. These features usually induce performance losses on the Jsc and Voc of the PSCs. Hence, developing effective strategies to optimize the surface properties of PEDOT:PSS and enhance its electrical conductivity is imperative for developing high-performance PSCs.
To tackle the above problems, PEDOT:PSS has been subjected to additive engineering, vapor induction and interfacial modifications. For example, Zheng et al. used a series of alcohols to effectively strip the entangled PSS to form aggregated PEDOT chains for enhanced conductivity.12 Liu et al. prepared high-performance PSCs by carrying out alcohol vapor annealing to reconstruct the PEDOT:PSS molecular arrangement and strengthen hole transfer.13 Zhu et al. treated PEDOT:PSS films with a carboxylic acid to dramatically ameliorate the hole conductivity and screen the coulomb interactions within PEDOT:PSS.14 Additionally, some researchers have induced the generation of such screening effects and suppressed internal interactions by flushing the surface with a PEAI protective layer15 to achieve phase separation and surface modification. However, there have been very few investigations of the phase separation of PEDOT:PSS in TPSCs and of the mechanism of the corresponding carrier transport.
In this work, we have used ammonium carbamate (AC) to properly strip the PSS shell around PEDOT and hence produce higher-conductivity films. The treated PEDOT:PSS film was observed to have a smooth and flat surface, which also promoted the high quality of the deposited tin halide perovskite films. More importantly, the removal of a significant amount of insulating PSS and the resultant enhancement of conductivity accelerated the charge extraction and suppressed the interfacial defects and the unwanted non-radiative recombination. Consequently, the target TPSC devices achieved notably improved Jsc and Voc, thus delivering a PCE enhancement from 9.48% to 11.24%. Meanwhile, the modified devices in nitrogen maintained more than 80% of the original PCE for 1368 h.
In inverted PSCs, the HTL has a great impact on the quality of the deposited perovskite grains.16Fig. 1a–d present the acquired atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and phase images of the original PEDOT:PSS film (left) and AC-modified film (right), respectively. The roughness was found to increase from 0.97 nm for the pristine film to 1.13 nm for the modified one. The smooth and flat surface morphology was not greatly altered, which was the foundation for the high-quality growth of uniform perovskite films (Fig. S1, ESI†) and optimal capture of light by the absorber17 (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). Generally, the bright areas in the phase image represented PEDOT, while the dark areas were rich in PSS.18 As can be seen in Fig. 1d, more PEDOT was exposed on the surface of the AC-treated film than on the pristine film, which implied an effective separation of PEDOT and PSS, and was consistent with the slight increase in roughness. This change in the surface morphology, as well as the partial removal of non-conductive PSS, considerably increased the amount of contact of PEDOT:PSS with the perovskite layer, leading to an improved conductive path and reduced obstruction of charge transport.19

With regard to the evidence of an overall phase separation in the films, it was also crucial to carry out an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The acquired survey XPS spectrum for the PEDOT:PSS film is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), where the peak of the introduced N element can be clearly observed. The signals in the S 2p orbital region of the XPS spectra of the original and AC-modified films are shown in Fig. 1e and f. In each spectrum, the peaks in the binding energy ranges 162–166 eV and 166–172 eV were attributed to the S atoms in the PEDOT and PSS chains, respectively.20 A Gaussian fitting analysis revealed that the PEDOT:PSS ratio was 0.29 for the AC-modified film, higher than that of the original film (0.22). Therefore, we concluded that AC properly stripped the PSS shell around PEDOT and also built a superior transfer channel for carriers.21,22 In addition, the peaks resulting from this fitting were at lower energy in the spectrum of the target than in that of the control, suggesting an increased electron cloud density around the S atom in the target.15,23 To further analyse the reaction mechanism of AC within PEDOT:PSS, we acquired Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the films. The band at about 833 cm−1, attributed to the C–H group on the benzene ring,24 exhibited a positive shift of 5 cm−1, while that at about 1528 cm−1 from the sulfonate group of PSS25 showed a negative shift of 12 cm−1, upon AC modification (Fig. 1g–h). These changes may have been caused by the interaction of AC near PSS with the sulfonic acid group on the benzene ring, thus achieving an effective phase separation of PEDOT and PSS.
Generally, the difference in carrier transport capacity between the perovskite layer and the HTLs tends to cause an excessive build-up of carriers at the interface.26 As explained in the previous section, with a proper removal of the surface-insulating PSS, the PEDOT film and perovskite layer can achieve effective contact and charge extraction. Fig. 2a and b show the J–V curves of resistance and conductivity (σ), with the device structures shown in the insets.27 It can be concluded that the modified film showed slightly increased resistance to lateral transmission, but improved vertical transmission. The effective transmission of holes to the indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrate could reduce the amount of recombination generated by charge accumulation.26,28

The relative permittivity of perovskite has been reported to be strongly correlated with the space electric field.29 A substantial reduction in the relative permittivity in the target device as compared to that of the pristine one was observed (Fig. S5, S6 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). It has been demonstrated that Voc is particularly sensitive to changes in relative permittivity, as compared to Jsc and fill factor (FF).29 Typically, a region of depletion tends to form at the interface between the perovskite and HTLs at high relative permittivity. In this case, the photogenerated carriers cannot be transported efficiently to form aggregated regions, resulting in an increase in the bulk recombination rate. Accordingly, lowering the relative dielectric constant is beneficial for the optimization of devices. We hence set out to characterize the carrier mobility (μ) to demonstrate its direct impact on charge transport (Fig. S7, ESI†). The μ of the target film was derived to be 5.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, much greater than that of the original film (1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1). This improvement was mainly attributed to the regulation of the phase together with the increase in the carrier transport.30
As shown in the inset of Fig. 2c, we simulated the structure of TPSC devices. The target device showed a Jsc of 20.66 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 11.24%, while the control only achieved a Jsc of 18.53 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 9.48%. Simultaneously, replacing the control device with the target device also showed a gratifying increase in Voc from 739 mV to 766 mV. Experiments involving doping different concentrations of AC (Fig. S8 and Table S3, ESI†) were also conducted. And we investigated the spectral responses of the devices by acquiring their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2d). The increased light absorption capability in the high-wavelength range for the target, compared to the control, implied that the carrier recombination between the light absorber layer and PEDOT:PSS was suppressed, thus yielding the increase in the Jsc of the target device. Fig. 2d shows the steady-state outputs of the different devices at the MPP. The target device maintained a steady-state PCE of 10.57% with a steady Jsc of 17.05 mA cm−2, whereas the PCE and Jsc of the control device were only 8.85% and 14.88 mA cm−2. Also, 20 independent TPSCs were manufactured to analyse the Jsc, Voc and FF distributions (Fig. S9, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2f, the control devices displayed a large fluctuation, with an average PCE of about 9.50%. The PCEs of the target devices were more narrowly distributed, at 11.00%, and performed more stably (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†). Such an increase in the device stability can be traced back to the optimization of carrier transport and the suppression of interfacial defect sites.
To further investigate the impacts of AC-modified PEDOT:PSS on the devices, we calculated density of defect states (DOS) by collecting Voc decay (OCVD) and transient photocurrent (TPC) data from the devices (Fig. S12, S13 and Tables S4–S6, ESI†). It can be concluded that the target devices had a lower density of trap states31,32 (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the target device displayed lower dark current than did the control device, which implied less direct shunting of the charge carrier channels and lower recombination losses. Moreover, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data (Fig. 3c) were also collected. In general, charge recombination can be detected from an analysis in the low-frequency domain.33 The lower serial resistance (Rs) and much higher recombination resistance (Rrec) commonly accompanied (Table S7, ESI†) by lower trap density was consistent with the DOS analysis. Correspondingly, as shown in Fig. 3d, the target device also showed longer carrier lifetime34 (47.20 μs) than did the original device (18.49 μs).

We also set out to determine charge transport lifetime (τtr) and charge recombination lifetime (τrec) values to further analyse the charge transport mechanism. As summarized in Fig. S14 and Table S8 (ESI†), the target device exhibited a lower τtr and much higher τrec and η increased from 72.90% for the control device to 89.61% for the target. Sequentially, we estimated the carrier diffusion coefficient (D) and diffusion length (LD) for each of the different devices. The LD (Table S8, ESI†) values of the control and target devices were 213.46 nm and 314.38 nm, respectively, much greater than the thickness of the perovskite layer (∼170 nm). In addition, the steady-state photoluminescence (Fig. 3e) and time-resolved photoluminescence (Fig. 3f) were also probed. Fits to the resulting data showed that the average charge lifetime was reduced from 17.68 ns for the pristine case to 9.80 ns for the target modified one (Table S9, ESI†), thus confirming the more efficient charge transfer in the target devices.
In summary, AC was incorporated into PEDOT:PSS film to regulate the phase separation of PEDOT and insulating PSS. It was found that the target films maintained the original smooth and dense surface morphology while guaranteeing high light transmission. In addition, the target film achieved superior electrical conductivity, ensuring rapid charge transfer and trap suppression at the interface. Compared to the control device, the target device showed significantly higher Jsc and Voc values, leading to a PCE enhancement from 9.48% to 11.24%. This work offers a viable strategy to boost the phase separation of the PEDOT:PSS film for high-performance TPSCs.
