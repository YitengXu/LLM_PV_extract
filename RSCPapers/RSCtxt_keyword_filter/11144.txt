    , Accepted 9th February 2018First published on 12th February 2018AbstractIn this work, two new small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors, NFDTS and NFDTSB, with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) framework were designed and synthesized based on dithienosilole (DTS) derivatives. PTB7-Th:NFDTSB-based devices achieved the highest PCE value of 9.60% with a Voc of 0.751 V, a FF of 63.3%, and a high Jsc of 20.14 mA cm−2 without any post-treatment, which is so far the best performance reported for OPV devices utilizing DTS-based organic photovoltaic materials.
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention as a promising photovoltaic technology to convert sunlight directly to electricity due to their low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility and solution processability.1–4 Although fullerene-based OPVs have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% in single-junction OPVs,5–10 the intrinsic drawbacks of poor absorption in the visible and near-infrared region and relatively fixed lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels have limited further improvement of the device performance.11 Therefore, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have recently been proposed to overcome those issues mentioned above.11–15 Recently, small-molecule NFAs with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) framework have shown very promising photovoltaic performance and have received widespread attention due to their tunable energy levels, broad absorption and facile synthetic procedures.16–22 Zhan and co-workers reported an important kind of A–D–A type small-molecule NFAs by using π-extended fused rings, indacenodithiophene16 and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene,17,23 as electron donating cores, and 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile as the terminal group. This A–D–A architecture ensures good conjugated planarity and facilitates π-electron delocalization, which is beneficial for the decrease of the energy bandgap and the extension of light absorption. In addition, the side chains on the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms of the cyclopentadiene moiety ensure good solubility and prevent the strong self-aggregation of the molecules. Inspiringly, fullerene-free OPVs based on ITIC and its analogues have exhibited impressive PCEs of above 12% through donor mapping and device optimization,24–27 which are even higher than those using the PC71BM acceptor. Very recently, new A–D–A type NFAs based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene28 and naphthodithiophene29 were reported with PCEs over 12%.
Dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) is an important building block for the design of donor materials with A–D–A-type structures that are widely applied in highly efficient fullerene-based OPVs.30–32 However, the photovoltaic performance of DTS based A–D–A type NFAs is far from satisfactory because of their poor short-circuit current density (Jsc);33,34 the best non-fullerene OPV based on DTS exhibited a PCE of only 1.56% with a very low Jsc of 3.56 mA cm−2.34 Thus, increasing Jsc will be the most effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance of DTS-based non-fullerene OPVs.
Here, we synthesized two new A–D–A-type NFAs, NFDTS and NFDTSB, with two ladder type DTS derivatives, thieno[3,2-b]thienobis(silolothiophene) (FDTS)35 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bis(dithienosilole) (FDTSB),36 as the core, respectively, and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN-2F) as the terminal group. The π-extended conjugated structure of FDTS and FDTSB is thought to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer and reduce the bandgap, resulting in improved light harvesting and enhanced Jsc. The impact of the difference in molecular structure on the optical and electrochemical properties, morphologies, and device performance was systematically investigated. We find that both NFDTS and NFDTSB exhibit similarly narrow optical bandgaps of 1.39 and 1.41 eV, inducing a strong and broad absorption that covers the spectral range of 600–890 nm, and appropriate energy levels as an electron acceptor. By utilizing a low bandgap polymer donor (PTB7-Th), NFDTS-based devices achieved a PCE of 6.15% with a high Jsc of 18.77 mA cm−2, and NFDTSB-based OPVs achieved the highest PCE value of 9.60% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.751 V, a fill factor (FF) of 63.3%, and a higher Jsc of 20.14 mA cm−2 without any post-treatment, which is so far the best performance reported for OPVs using DTS-based organic photovoltaic materials.32,34,37
The synthetic routes of the target NFAs, NFDTS and NFDTSB, are shown in Fig. 1. We synthesized intermediates FDTS-CHO and FDTSB-CHO through the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction from compounds FDTS35 and FDTSB,36 respectively. Subsequently, through Knoevenagel condensation of the intermediates with INCN-2F, we synthesized the target compounds NFDTS and NFDTSB in 80% yield as black solids, which exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents. The thermal stability of the NFAs was examined by thermogravimetric analysis, and both NFAs were thermally stable with a 5% weight loss above 320 °C under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

The normalized absorption spectra of the two NFAs in dilute chloroform are shown in Fig. S2a.† Both NFAs exhibit strong absorption in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm, which can be attributed to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and NFDTS exhibits a higher molar absorption coefficient of 2.22 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 740 nm than NFDTSB (1.68 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 720 nm, see Table 1). Besides, NFDTSB showed one more band from 400 to 550 nm that is mainly assigned to the π–π* transition. In the thin films (see Fig. 2a), the absorption spectra of NFDTS and NFDTSB broaden with the maximum absorption peak red-shifted to 808 nm and 791 nm, respectively. In addition, NFDTS displayed a stronger shoulder peak at 728 nm, indicating that NFDTS formed a more ordered packing structure during the film forming process. The optical bandgaps of NFDTS and NFDTSB were determined to be 1.41 and 1.40 eV, respectively. The absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th in a thin film was also plotted in Fig. 2a for comparison. Apparently, the complementary absorption of PTB7-Th and NFAs is desirable for enhancing light harvesting so as to increase Jsc of the solar cells. The electrochemical properties of NFAs were examined by cyclic voltammetry measurements and the results are shown in Fig. S2b.† The potentials were internally calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) and the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO energy levels were calculated based on the onsets of the oxidation and reduction curves. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.36 and −3.92 eV for NFDTS and −5.56 and −3.85 eV for NFDTSB, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were performed to investigate the opto-electronic properties of NFDTS and NFDTSB. NFDTS exhibited a higher molar absorption coefficient of 1.04 × 105 M−1 cm−1 than that of NFDTSB (0.90 × 105 M−1 cm−1, see Table S5†), which is consistent with the UV-vis measurements. As shown in Fig. S6,† the HOMO orbital is mainly distributed on the electron-donating core, whereas the LUMO orbital is delocalized throughout the whole backbone. The calculation predicted a LUMO level of −3.53 eV for NFDTSB, slightly higher than that of NFDTS (−3.64 eV), which is in accordance with the CV measurements. The higher LUMO energy level of NFDTSB will be beneficial to achieving high open-circuit voltage (Voc) in OPVs. The energy diagram relative to the vacuum level is shown in Fig. 2b.

To evaluate the potential application of NFDTS and NFDTSB as electron acceptors in OPVs, we used PTB7-Th as the polymer donor to fabricate OPVs with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:NFDTS or NFDTSB/PFN-Br/Al, where PFN-Br is an efficient cathode buffer layer, which can modify the work function of the electrode, improve the charge extraction efficiency and reduce recombination losses.38 We optimized the device fabrication conditions, such as processing solvents and donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†); the active layers were prepared by spin-coating the PTB7-Th:NFDTS (1:1.2, w/w) or PTB7-Th:NFDTSB (1:1, w/w) solution with a polymer weight concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in chloroform and the optimized thickness of the active layer was ∼100 nm. The optimized device performance data are summarized in Table 2, and the corresponding J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 3a. The optimized OPV devices based on PTB7-Th:NFDTS gave a PCE of 6.15% with a Voc of 0.670 V, a high Jsc of 18.77 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 48.9%. In comparison, the optimized OPV devices based on PTB7-Th:NFDTSB gave an increased PCE of 9.60% with a higher Voc of 0.751 V, a FF of 63.3%, and a Jsc of 20.14 mA cm−2 without any treatment, which is the highest PCE for OPVs using dithienosilole-based organic photovoltaic materials. The higher Voc is related to the higher LUMO level of NFBDTSB, the higher FF is related to higher and more balanced hole and electron transportation, while the higher Jsc can be attributed to the more efficient transportation of carriers and lower bimolecular recombination in the device, which will be discussed below. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal OPV devices covered a wide wavelength range from 300 to 890 nm (Fig. 3b), which originated from complementary absorptions of the donor and acceptor materials. The NFDTSB-based device reached a maximum value of 72% at 570 nm and a broader range of 470–790 nm compared to the NFDTS-based device (60% over 540–660 nm), indicating a more efficient photoelectric conversion of the NFDTSB-based device. Compared to the current densities obtained from the J–V measurements, the Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves under the standard solar spectrum (AM 1.5G) for the PTB7-Th:NFDTS and PTB7-Th:NFDTSB OPV devices were 18.37 mA cm−2 and 19.12 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3b), respectively, which represented a small deviation of less than 5%.

The balanced hole/electron mobility played an important role in achieving high performance in OPVs. The space charge limited current (SCLC) method is employed to measure the hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities of PTB7-Th:NFDTS and PTB7-Th:NFDTSB blend films (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The PTB7-Th:NFDTS blend film exhibited a hole mobility of 7.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 3.94 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 18.3. The PTB7-Th:NFDTSB blend film exhibited higher hole and electron mobilities of 1.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the μh/μe ratio decreased to 1.7 (Table S4 in the ESI†). The higher and balanced charge carrier mobilities are beneficial to the efficient charge transportation, which is responsible for the higher FF of the NFDTSB-based devices.
We investigated the charge generation, dissociation, and collection properties in the NFDTS and NFDTSB-based devices by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph, defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) as a function of effective voltage (Veff, defined as V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias). As can be seen from Fig. 4b, Jph is saturated (Jsat) at Veff higher than 2 V, suggesting that almost all excitons are dissociated and photogenerated charge carriers are completely collected by the electrodes. The charge dissociation and charge collection probability (P(E,T)) in the devices could be estimated from the value of Jsc/Jsat.39 The Jsc/Jsat ratios for the PTB7-Th:NFDTS and PTB7-Th:NFDTSB devices were calculated to be 89% and 95% under short-circuit conditions, respectively. The higher P(E,T) value of the NFDTSB-based device indicates that the PTB7-Th:NFDTSB device exhibited a higher exciton dissociation rate and a more efficient charge collection efficiency than the PTB7-Th:NFDTS device.40,41 To understand the charge recombination behavior of the OPVs, the effect of light intensity (P) and short-circuit current density was then studied (Fig. 4a). Generally, the relationship between Jsc and light intensity can be described by the formula Jsc ∝ Pα. If all free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, α should be equal to 1, while α < 1 indicates some extent of bimolecular recombination. The values for PTB7-Th:NFDTS and PTB7-Th:NFDTSB are 0.92 and 0.97, respectively. This indicates lower bimolecular recombination in the PTB7-Th:NFDTSB device. This reduced bimolecular recombination thus resulted in high Jsc and better device performance. In general, charge recombination is related to the FF of the devices. The lower bimolecular recombination in the PTB7-Th:NFDTSB device agrees well with the higher FF value of 63.3% relative to that of the PTB7-Th:NFDTS device (48.9%).

The BHJ film morphology was studied by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) to evaluate the OPV performance. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, homogeneous surface morphological structures were formed for the two blend films, which thereby afforded much lower values of RMS roughness. The PTB7-Th:NFDTSB blend film showed a smoother surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.765 nm than the PTB7-Th:NFDTS blend film with a RMS roughness of 0.885 nm. The smoother and uniform surface morphology of the PTB7-Th:NFDTSB blend film advantageously modified the contact between the top electrode and the active layer. The TEM images of the two optimized films are shown in Fig. 5c and d. All the blend films are uniform and show a clear phase separation. The PTB7-Th:NFDTSB film exhibited a more bi-continuous interpenetrating network between the polymer donor and the acceptor, benefitting charge carrier generation and transportation, which can explain the improvement in both Jsc and FF, thereby resulting in an enhancement in the PCE of the PTB7-Th:NFDTSB OPVs. Fig. S5† shows the GIXD line cut profiles of the pure films and blend films in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions. For the pure films, the NFDTSB film showed a more ordered intermolecular arrangement than the NFDTS film. The PTB7-Th:NFDTS blend film showed a prominent (100) diffraction peak at 0.31 Å−1 (lamellar d-spacing of 20.26 Å) in the IP direction and the π–π stacking peak was located at 1.72 Å−1 (d-spacing of 3.65 Å) in the OOP direction. The PTB7-Th:NFDTSB blend film showed a lamellar (100) peak at 0.30 Å−1 (lamellar d-spacing of 20.93 Å) in the IP direction and the π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction was located at 1.74 Å−1 (d-spacing of 3.61 Å), which indicates a reduced π-stacking distance compared to the PTB7-Th:NFDTS film (3.65 Å). The tight π-stacking of the PTB7-Th:NFDTSB blend can improve exciton dissociation and charge transport, thus enhancing the performance.

In summary, we have designed and synthesized two new A–D–A type NFAs, NFDTS and NFDTSB, with dithienosilole derivatives as the core donor unit. NFDTS and NFDTSB exhibited a broadened absorption spectrum (600–890 nm) that is complementary to the absorption of PTB7-Th for achieving high Jsc. Through device optimization, the NFDTSB-based device achieved the highest PCE value of 9.60% with a Voc of 0.751 V, a FF of 63.3%, and a higher Jsc of 20.14 mA cm−2 without any post-treatment, which is so far the best performance reported for OPV devices utilizing dithienosilole-based organic photovoltaic materials. Our work indicates that dithienosilole derivatives are not only an excellent building block for electron donors, but they should also be a very promising moiety for the development of high-performance fullerene-free OPVs.
