It was found that bulky bay substituents interfere with molecular packing, leading to low charge transport and photovoltaic efficiencies compared to PDIs with fewer or less disruptive substituents. We assessed the potential of PDIs as acceptors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) by utilizing a solution-processed bilayer OPV device architecture with the donor benzoporphyrin. At AM1.5G illumination, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 2.0% are obtained for solution-processed bilayer OPVs employing PDIs as acceptors. These results demonstrate the potential of PDIs as photovoltaic acceptor materials while elucidating the relationships between molecular structure and material properties.IntroductionOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) may potentially be employed as a low-cost, light-weight, and flexible source of clean energy.1 Advancements in the efficiency of OPV devices have been achieved by the development of novel organic semiconductors, device architectures, and device processing conditions.2–4 Material design efforts have been overwhelmingly focused on electron donating materials, while functionalized fullerenes dominate the OPV literature as electron accepting materials.5 Fullerene derivatives exhibit high mobility,6 strong electron accepting properties,7 and suitable frontier orbital energies8,9 and nanoscale morphologies5 with many donor materials. Despite the success of fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors, the design of new acceptor materials that overcome the limitations of fullerene derivatives may enable paradigm-changing advances for OPVs.10Fullerene derivatives absorb poorly in the visible region,11 possess somewhat static energy levels,12 and require energy-intensive production.13 These attributes, in turn, limit the maximum achievable short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC), as well as the commercial viability of OPVs. Non-fullerene acceptor materials can potentially overcome these limitations in that they can be designed, using facile synthetic schemes, to absorb highly in the visible region and have tunable energy levels.12,14,15 In addition to these properties, any non-fullerene acceptor must also accept and transport electrons efficiently. Designing a molecule that meets all of these requirements is a substantial challenge, yet a further obstacle to the design of new non-fullerene acceptors is that their potential optoelectronic properties can be obfuscated in a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) system, in which donor and acceptor blends form nanoscale phase-separated, percolating networks. It is important to develop structure–property–performance relationships for electron accepting materials independent of blend morphology so that promising materials can be identified and further developed. Given these challenges, it is perhaps unsurprising that the highest performing non-fullerene OPVs reported have PCEs of approximately 3%,16–18 which is a far cry from the current single-junction OPV record efficiency of 10% using fullerene acceptors.19Perylenediimides (PDIs) comprise a class of non-fullerene acceptors that are a promising alternative to fullerene derivatives in OPV devices.15,20 They exhibit high mobility,21 high absorption in the visible region, and are thermally and photochemically stable. Their properties are readily tuned; absorption, fluorescence, and HOMO–LUMO energies can be easily modified by changing the substituents in what are commonly called the bay positions (1,6,7,12 substitution).15 The addition of substituents to either the imide groups or the bay positions increases the solubility in organic solvents. However, while imide substitutions have little effect on the frontier orbital energy levels and do not inhibit solid state packing, bay substituents can twist the perylene core, potentially leading to weaker interactions between the molecules, and induce substantial changes to the HOMO–LUMO energy levels.15PDIs have been extensively studied for decades; however, there remains a need to better understand the relationship between their molecular structure, morphology, and opto-electronic function in order for PDIs to be effectively used as acceptor materials in OPVs. With the aim of comparing the photovoltaic performance of PDIs to each other and to conventional fullerene derivatives, we utilize a bilayer OPV architecture with benzoporphyrin (BP) as the donor. As shown in Fig. 1a, BP is solution-processable from a soluble precursor, tetraethanotetrabenzoporphyrin (CP), and then thermally converted in the solid state to BP, a semiconducting, polycrystalline, and insoluble donor film,22 enabling facile solution processing of subsequent layers without dissolving the underlying BP. This system is advantageous as a testing platform because there is a single, well-defined interface between the donor and acceptor such that the photovoltaic performance of the acceptor material may be assessed independent of the material's ability to form a desirable bulk heterojunction morphology with a particular donor.11 Fig. 1  (a) Conversion of CP to BP upon thermal annealing. (b) Energy diagram of donor (BP) and acceptors (PCBM and PDIs 1–4) used in this study. PDI frontier energy levels are obtained from cyclic voltammetry measurements (see ESI,† Fig. S2). (c) Chemical structures of PDIs used in this study. Results and discussionPDI 1 and PDI 3 were prepared according to the literature procedure.23,24PDI 2, as a 88:12 mixture of 1,7 and 1,6 regioisomers, was prepared by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the dibromosubstituted PDI derivative25 with 4-tert-octylphenol under basic conditions. The pure 1,7-regioisomer of PDI 4 was synthesized for the first time by Sonogashira coupling26 from the dibromosubstituted PDI derivative25 in very good yield (ESI,† Fig. S1).The chemical structures and frontier energy levels of the four PDI materials examined in this study are shown in Fig. 1b and c. PDI 1 is a planar molecule, substituted with long swallowtail alkyl chains on the imides that render the molecule highly soluble in organic solvents. PDI 2 and PDI 3 contain tert-octylphenoxy groups in the bay positions. The electron-donating character of these alkylaryloxy substituents has the effect of narrowing the band gap and raising the frontier orbital energy levels, with four substituents having a greater effect than two. PDI 4, specially designed for our study, has two p-tolylethynyl groups in the 1,7-positions. The tolylethynyl substituents have no significant electron donating effect, resulting in similar frontier orbital energy levels to those of PDI 1.We tested these acceptors in bilayer OPV devices with BP as the donor material (Fig. 2). A device architecture comprising indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/BP (50 nm)/PDI (∼20 nm)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Al was used. We compared the PCE of devices with PDIs to that of an optimized device with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) of the same device architecture. A 3 nm thick BCP film applied between the acceptor and cathode was found to greatly improve the photovoltaic characteristics of devices with PDIs, however, it did not notably affect those of devices with PCBM (ESI,† Fig. S3). Fig. 2  (a) Bilayer OPV current density–voltage (J–V) curves under AM1.5G illumination. (b) Device parameters. Devices are constructed with the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BP/acceptor/BCP/Al. The highest efficiency achieved is for devices with PCBM (2.7%). Devices using PDI 1 and PDI 4, which have very similar frontier energy levels to PCBM, exhibit respectable device characteristics, with PCEs of 2.0% and 1.7%, respectively. Devices with PDI 2 and PDI 3 both have very low PCEs of 0.4% and 0.02%, respectively. Despite their potential to exhibit high VOC due to their relatively shallow LUMO values of −3.7 eV for PDI 2 and −3.2 eV for PDI 3, the low fill factor (FF) and JSC limit their device performance.To investigate the origin of the low performance in bilayer OPV devices, we measured the charge transport properties of PCBM and the four PDIs in field-effect transistors (FETs) (Fig. 3). We found that the electron mobility of the PDIs studied correlates with the device performance in bilayer OPVs. The electron mobility of PCBM was found to be 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1. PDI 1 and PDI 4 have electron mobilities of 1.1 × 10−5 and 4.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Both the PCE in bilayer OPVs and electron mobility decrease dramatically as a function of increasing number of alkylaryloxy bay substituents, to a value of 4.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDI 2 and even lower for PDI 3, which produced a current comparable to the gate leakage current and thus the mobility could not be calculated. Charge mobility has been shown to significantly influence FF and JSC in OPV devices.27–29 While JSC and FF may be influenced by other properties, such as exciton diffusion length and charge generation efficiency, the strong correlation between charge mobility and PCE led us to investigate the underlying causes for the differing charge carrier mobilities of the four PDIs in order to rationalize their varying photovoltaic performance. Fig. 3  (a) FET transfer curves of neat PDI films. (b) Table of electron mobility values of the PDIs calculated from fitting Ids1/2 against Vgs in the saturation regime (ESI,† Fig. S4). Having observed a direct correlation between bilayer OPV device performance and acceptor charge transport characteristics, we now attempt to identify the molecular and structural underpinnings of these properties. In order to investigate the relationship between the electron mobility and the thin film morphology, we probed the solid state ordering of the PDIs using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (Fig. 4a). Utilizing a synchrotron light source and a 2-dimensional detector, it is possible to probe crystallites over a wide range of angles relative to the substrate. The diffraction patterns of thin films of PDI 1 and PDI 4 contain several peaks, indicating the presence of PDI crystallites. No crystalline peaks were observed for PDI 2 or PDI 3, indicating that these films are largely amorphous. The crystalline domains of the PDI films are also observed by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4b). The topography of PDI 1 and PDI 4 both exhibit discrete structural features and have root mean square (RMS) roughness values over 1 nm, whereas the surfaces of PDI 2 and PDI 3 are extremely smooth and featureless, similar to that of PCBM (ESI,† Fig. S5). Both GIWAXS and AFM thus indicate that PDI 1 and PDI 4 exhibit crystalline order while PDI 2 and PDI 3 are largely amorphous. We find that those PDIs with crystalline order in thin films have reasonable charge transport characteristics, while PDI 2 and PDI 3, which form thin films lacking long-range order, have lower electron mobility. These results are in accordance with the relationship between solid-state order and charge carrier mobility that has been observed for PDIs as well as other conjugated small molecules.30,31 Fig. 4  (a) Radially integrated GIWAXS patterns of neat PDI films on Si/PEDOT:PSS substrates. (b) Tapping mode AFM topographic images of neat PDI films on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates (larger AFM images and RMS values are reported in the ESI†). The morphological data we have presented thus far, however, do not explain the observed difference in the performance between PDI 2 and PDI 3. Though the performance of both materials is poor, bilayer OPVs with PDI 2 have substantially higher JSC and electron mobility than those with PDI 3, despite the fact that we observe no crystalline order in GIWAXS or AFM measurements of thin films of either molecule. This can be explained by analysis of the relative strength of the 0–1 (495–545 nm) and 0–0 (550–595 nm) transitions in thin film UV-vis spectra of the neat PDI films, shown in Fig. 5. A ratio of the 0–1/0–0 peak intensities greater than one is indicative of H-aggregation (cofacial π–π stacking).32,33 We see a 0–1/0–0 ratio greater than one in PDI 1 and PDI 4, consistent with the observation of PDI crystallites by GIWAXS and AFM in thin films of these materials. While PDI 3 has a 0–1/0–0 ratio of 0.78, as expected for an amorphous film, PDI 2 has a 0–1/0–0 ratio of 1.2. This suggests that, despite the lack of evidence for long-range order in GIWAXS and AFM measurements, there exists some short-range order that is below the detection limit of these techniques. This short-range cofacial order may lead to the higher charge carrier mobility and thus higher OPV device performance of PDI 2 compared to PDI 3. Fig. 5  (a) Thin film UV-vis absorption spectra of neat PDI films cast from chloroform solution using the same processing conditions used to make bilayer OPV devices. (b) Table showing the ratio of the 0–1/0–0 peak intensities in the UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. 5a. In order to connect the solid state ordering of the PDIs to their molecular structure, we analyze the optimized geometries, calculated using density function theory at the B3LYP/6-31G level in vacuo (Fig. 6). As expected, the unsubstituted PDI 1 is highly planar (torsion angle equal to 0.0°). The steric restriction of the alkylaryloxy groups in PDI 2 and PDI 3 results in torsion of the perylene core of 13.9° and 31.2°, respectively, and orientation of the phenyl groups perpendicular to the perylene backbone. These bulky bay substituents likely disrupt molecular packing in the solid state and decrease π-orbital overlap, as has been observed for other molecular semiconductors.34 This relationship is consistent with the reduction in charge carrier mobility and OPV device performance of PDI 2 and PDI 3 relative to PDI 1 and PDI 4. While PDI 2 and PDI 3 both contain bulky groups that may disrupt solid state order, PDI 2 has fewer bulky substituents, which may enable the short-range ordering observed in thin film UV-vis measurements and thus explain the improved charge carrier mobility of PDI 2 relative to PDI 3. The optimized geometry of PDI 4 seems to be more influenced by electronic rather than steric effects, thus the tolylethynyl groups lie in plane with the naphthalene unit to which they are attached. Although PDI 4 has a torsion angle of 17.2°, greater than that of PDI 2, its curved geometry likely allows for molecular packing that results in the observed crystallinity in the solid state and, in turn, higher charge carrier mobility and OPV device performance relative to PDI 2 and PDI 3. Fig. 6  Optimized geometry of PDI molecules calculated by density function theory. ConclusionsIn conclusion, we can ultimately rationalize the performance of the studied PDI acceptors in bilayer OPVs as a consequence of their molecular structure. Molecules with molecular geometries that promote ordered thin films lead to improved electron mobilities and correspondingly high PCEs in OPV devices. Specifically, it was found that PDI 1 and PDI 4, with different imide and bay substituents, exhibit molecular geometries that enable the formation of crystallites in the solid state, which leads to reasonable electron mobilities and, in turn, PCEs up to 2.0%, compared to that of the device with PCBM, which achieves a PCE of 2.7%. We attribute the low performance of devices with PDI 2 and PDI 3 to the bulky alkylaryloxy bay substituents that suppress crystallization in thin films, which, in turn, limits charge carrier mobility and thus bilayer OPV device performance. PDI 2, containing two bulky bay substituents, maintains some degree of short-range order, as evidenced by thin film UV-vis. The short-range order in PDI 2 may explain the higher electron mobility and photovoltaic performance relative to PDI 3, for which a lack of solid state order is indicated by GIWAXS, AFM and UV-vis measurements. Other effects may also influence the device performance of PDIs in bilayer OPVs, such as the possibility for trapping in the PDIs with electron donating bay substituents that result in more shallow energy levels.35 The relationship between solid state order, charge transport characteristics, and OPV device performance is also likely to be important for acceptors used in BHJ OPVs, in which the build up of space charge can occur when donor and acceptor materials have severely divergent mobilities.27We assert that bay substitution may still be a promising route for modifying the frontier energies of PDI derivatives, as long as the substituents are coplanar with the perylene core, as demonstrated by introducing and characterizing PDI 4. Alternatively, the ortho positions (2,5,8,11 positions) may be functionalized, which has been shown to modify frontier energy levels without greatly inhibiting solid state order.15Most importantly, we have shown that PDIs can function as efficient electron accepting and transporting materials in OPVs and that, to a significant extent, their lack of performance in BHJ systems to date is likely to be the result of an inability to form desirable BHJ morphologies. These findings suggest that PDIs should be paired with a variety of donor materials in order to identify donors with which they may form a favorable BHJ morphology.17 Additionally, further structure–property–performance relationships should be developed for PDIs, facilitating the design of solution-processable non-fullerene acceptors with mobilities approaching those of high performance fullerene derivatives.ExperimentalPerylenediimide (PDI) synthesis and characterizationAll reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Commercial thin film chromatography (TLC) plates (silica gel 60 F254, SDS) were used to monitor the progress of the reaction, with spots observed under UV light at 254 and 365 nm. Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60A (particle size 40–63 μm, SDS). NMR spectra were taken using a 300 MHz Bruker Avance 300. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption measurements of solutions were taken on a ThermoSpectronic Helios γ spectrophotometer. Infrared measurements were taken with a Fourier Transform (FT-IR) ThermoNicolet model IR 200 Spectrometer in transmission mode with KBr. Mass spectra were obtained from a Bruker matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometer using dithranol as a matrix.The syntheses of N,N′-dioctyl-1,7-di(4′-tert-octylphenoxy)-3:4,9:10-perylenetetracarboxydiimide (PDI 2) and N,N′-dioctyl-1,7-di(p-tolylethynyl)-3:4,9:10-perylenetetracarboxydiimide (PDI 4) are included in the ESI.†Electrochemical measurementsCyclic voltammetric data were measured using a μAUTOLAB type III potentiostat/galvanostat with a three-electrode configuration system. The experiments were carried out under an atmospheric pressure of Ar, with 3 mL of dichloromethane containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the electrolyte, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A single crystal platinum electrode (1 mm diameter) and a platinum wire were used as working and counter electrodes, respectively. The measured potentials were recorded with respect to a Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) reference electrode. LUMO energies were determined from the cyclic voltammograms (ESI,† Fig. S2). The HOMO was deduced from the LUMO and the zero–zero excitation energy, E0–0, measured from the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence emission spectra.Theoretical calculationsCalculations were examined using the Gaussian03 program package. Density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G level in vacuo was applied to optimize the ground-state geometries of the considered molecules in the gas phase. Alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups in order to reduce calculation time.GIWAXS and AFM thin film characterizationGIWAXS data were collected at beam line 11-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source. GIWAXS samples were prepared on clean Si substrates. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was drop-filtered from a 0.45 μm PVDF filter atop the cleaned substrates and spun at 2500 rpm to produce a 50 nm thick film, which was subsequently annealed at 140 °C for 30 minutes. PDI films were spin cast atop the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1500 rpm from 6 mg mL−1 PDI solutions in chloroform.AFM images were collected on an Asylum MFP-3D AFM in tapping mode using a VistaProbes 75 kHz silicon tip with a 5 N m−1 spring constant. Neat films of benzoporphyrin (BP), PCBM, and the four PDIs were prepared on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates from the same conditions (solvent, concentration, spin rate) as those used for bilayer OPV device fabrication (see below).Field-effect transistor (FET) characterizationFET measurements were collected in a Lakeshore vacuum probe-station under a vacuum of 1 × 10−6 mbar using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer. FETs were constructed with the architecture Si/SiO2/octyltrichlorosilane (OTS)/acceptor/Al. 200 nm thick thermal oxide Si wafers were cleaned by sonicating sequentially in piranha solution, D.I. water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 30 min each. The Si substrates were dried and cleaned by UV-O3 for 30 min and then passivated in an OTS solution (0.001 v% in hexanes) for 30 minutes. The substrates were then dried on a hotplate set to 80 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. Films of the acceptors were cast from a 6 mg mL−1 solution of PDI in chloroform, batch-filtered from 0.22 μm PTFE filters, at a rate of 3000 rpm. 80 nm patterned Al drain–source electrodes were thermally evaporated at a pressure of below 1 × 10−6 Torr. The resulting devices had a FET channel length of 70 μm and width of 1 or 2 mm. Electron mobility (μe−) was calculated from fitting Ids1/2 against Vgs in the saturation regime (ESI,† Fig. S5b, d, f and h).Bilayer OPV devicesOPV devices were characterized by collecting current density–voltage (J–V) curves in light and dark conditions and by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE). J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2602 source-measure unit, under solar simulation conditions of 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G using a 300 W Xe arc lamp with an AM 1.5 global filter. The illumination intensity of the solar simulator was measured using a standard silicon photovoltaic diode with a protective KG1 filter calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. EQE spectra measurements were done using a 75 W Xe arc lamp, monochromator, optical chopper (Newport Oriel Instruments), Stanford Research Systems lock-in amplifier, and a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable silicon photodiode for monochromatic power-density calibration.All materials other than the PDIs were used as received. 1,4:8,11:15,18:22,25-Tetraethano-29H,31H tetrabenzo[b,g,l,q]porphyrin (CP) was received from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation and stored in a refrigerator. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (99.5%) was purchased from Solenne and stored in a glovebox. ITO (∼150 nm thick) coated patterned glass substrates were cleaned by scrubbing with soap and sonicating in D.I. water, acetone, and IPA for at least 15 min each. Cleaned substrates were blown dry with a nitrogen gun, oven-dried for 15 min, and cleaned using UV-O3 for 30 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was drop-filtered from a 0.45 μm PVDF filter atop the cleaned ITO-coated glass and spun at 2500 rpm to produce a 50 nm thick film, which was then annealed on a hotplate set at 120 °C for 10 min, transferred into a glovebox, and annealed for another 3 min at 180 °C. A 20 mg mL−1 solution of CP (the precursor to BP) in 1:2 chloroform:chlorobenzene was batch-filtered using a 0.22 μm PTFE filter, spun at 1500 rpm, and subsequently annealed on a hotplate set to 180 °C for 20 min. Films were allowed to cool before casting the acceptor layer. For the devices with PDIs, the PDI films were cast from 6 mg mL−1 in chloroform; for the devices with PCBM, the PCBM films were cast from 12 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. In either case, the 0.22 μm PTFE batch-filtered solutions were cast at 1500 rpm. Onto these films, a 3 nm thick layer of BCP was deposited in an Angstrom Engineering thermal evaporator at a pressure of below 1 × 10−6 Torr at a rate of 0.2 Å s−1 using an open mask that exposed most of the film surface. Films were then brought back into the glovebox, scratched to make contact with the bottom electrode, and completed by evaporating a patterned top electrode of 100 nm Al evaporated at a pressure of below 1 × 10−6 Torr at a rate of 0.3 Å s−1 for the first 10 nm and then slowly increasing to 2.3 Å s−1.AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge Jianhua Liu and Fred Wudl at the University of California Santa Barbara for helpful discussions.
