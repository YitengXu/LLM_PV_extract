    , Accepted 20th February 2017First published on 21st February 2017AbstractThe development of highly efficient flexible quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) has still been challenging. Herein, fully flexible titanium (Ti) mesh based QDSCs with desirable photovoltaic performance are proposed and fabricated successfully. ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocrystals grown on a Ti mesh substrate as photoanodes were prepared by surface selenization of ZnO nanosheets to form ZnO/ZnSe core/shell nanostructures, followed by partial conversion of ZnSe to CdSe through an ion replacement process. Meanwhile, flexible Ti mesh based counter electrodes (CEs) were prepared with the use of structure controllable mesoporous carbon microspheres as catalytic materials. Benefiting from the in situ growth of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe heterojunction photoanodes with effective light harvesting capacity and the highly catalytic activity of MC/Ti CEs, a new power conversion efficiency (PCE) record with an average value over 5% was achieved for fully flexible QDSCs under one full sun illumination.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, flexible solar cells are drawing extensive attention along with the fast development of various bendable or wearable electronic devices.1–5 Due to the relatively low cost and easy fabrication, quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have the quality necessary for being a flexible device.6–10 Encouragingly, record power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 11% has been obtained from Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) QDSCs with the use of flexible titanium mesh supported mesoporous carbon (MC/Ti) counter electrodes (CEs).11 The MC/Ti CE not only demonstrates higher catalytic activity and better conductivity than the state-of-art Cu2S/FTO CE, but also exhibits superior flexibility as a potential electrode for a flexible device.12 It is regrettable that rigid FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) glass supported TiO2 nanoparticles were used as photoanodes and limited the flexibility of the resulting cell devices. Currently, the reported best PCE of a fully flexible QDSC is less than 4.0%, still lagging far behind that of a rigid device with an FTO substrate.13–16 Therefore, efforts are urgently needed to boost the efficiency of flexible QDSCs and explore their full potential.
The key point to designing a well-performing flexible QDSC is to develop an effective flexible electrode. This requires that the substrate should fulfill the high conductivity, transparency, and heat-resisting abilities besides flexibility. Recently, poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET)/indium tin oxide (ITO) plastic film has been investigated widely and has become the dominant electrode substrate for flexible solar cells.17–20 For example, Meng and co-workers were the pioneers in proposing a flexible photoanode through transferring the pre-prepared TiO2 porous layer on PET/ITO, obtaining a PCE of 3.47% for CdS/CdSe QDSCs with a Cu2S/brass counter electrode (CE).21 Despite the high efficiency achieved, this is not a commercially viable technique due to high expenses and the complexity of transferring steps required during the fabrication process. Lei et al. have reported a flexible photoanode film based on ZnO nanorods in situ grown on PET/ITO substrates by a hydrothermal method at low temperature.22 Pan et al. adopted the same ZnO nanorod/ITO/PET photoanode and attained a PCE of 2.7% for CdS/CdSe flexible QDSC device composed of cobalt sulfide nanorod arrays on graphite paper as the CE.23 Recently, Zhong et al. have prepared a photoanode by doctor-blading TiO2 paste on the polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)/ITO substrate without the high temperature sintering process, and assembled a QDSC with a flexible Cu2S/Ni foam CE, achieving a champion cell efficiency of 3.55%.16 However, the plastic PET/ITO substrate could not resist high temperature. Without a high temperature annealing process at 450–500 °C to remove organic additives in the TiO2 paste during the procedure for the preparation of a typical FTO supported TiO2 film electrode, the obtained metal oxide mesoporous films anchored on the PET/ITO substrate have a high density of defects and show poor electric conductivity among metal oxide crystallites. This has become the main factor in limiting the photovoltaic performance of flexible solar cells. Furthermore, the semiconductor oxide film can crack and fall off easily from the smooth plastic substrate under bending.2,24–26
Based on the above-mentioned shortcomings for PET/ITO electrodes, Chen et al. have reported flexible QDSCs using ZnO nanosheet arrays grown on woven Ti wires as photoanodes and demonstrated excellent PCE of 3.4%.15 However, the CdS/CdSe QDs deposited onto the surface of ZnO nanosheets via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method had many surface defects and caused charge recombination at the interfaces of the electrolyte and QDs. Multinary semiconductor QDs (e.g., Cu2ZnGeS4, AgInS2/ZnS, and CuInS2/ZnS) were considered as a promising nanostructured energy conversion material for photocatalysis and photovoltaic applications due to their excellent light-harvesting properties along with a wide absorption range, fast electron injection and low charge recombination rates.27–30 In order to address the problem of charge recombination, surface passivation by coating the photoanode with a thin layer of a wide band-gap material, such as TiO2, CdS, ZnSe, ZnS, and Al2O3, has been explored in many studies, and a significant improvement in PCE has been achieved.31–37 Specifically, upon coating a ZnSe layer on the ZnO nanostructure, a ZnO/ZnSe type-II heterojunction was formed.36 ZnSe has a higher conduction band edge compared to that of ZnO. Accordingly, electrons from ZnSe can be transferred more effectively to ZnO with a lower conduction band edge, and the surface recombination will be retarded. On the other hand, the ZnO/ZnSe nanostructure array can be fabricated conveniently by a facile ion exchange process because of the larger solubility product constant (Ksp) of ZnO relative to that of ZnSe. Xu et al. have fabricated a ZnO/ZnSe heterojunction based on ZnO nanorods and used CdSe as a sensitizer. After assembly, the solar cell showed an amazing PCE of 4.54%.38,39 In another similar study on ZnO/ZnxCd1−xSe grown with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, the solar cell showed excellent photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 3.68%.40 However, all these photoanodes based on the ZnO/ZnSe heterojunction are constructed on a rigid FTO glass or aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) substrate, which is fragile and has a high resistivity. In comparison, the Ti mesh substrate possesses promising properties of high flexibility and low sheet resistance. Meanwhile, the confined area defined by the wires allows for the effective deposition of a QD light active layer for effective light harvesting. Therefore, ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanosheet arrays grown on a Ti mesh substrate may display better photovoltaic performance.
Herein, we demonstrate a novel flexible photoanode for QDSCs by utilizing a Ti mesh substrate combined with the ion exchange process to in situ synthesize the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanosheet active layer for light harvesting. Meanwhile, the flexible MC/Ti CE was optimized in the aspects of surface area and pore size distribution via a modified spray drying preparation process. As a result, the flexible Ti mesh-based QDSCs exhibited an average PCE of 5.07% (Jsc = 15.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.632 V, FF = 0.525) under standard measurement conditions. This work not only gives an example of high-performance flexible QDSCs but also demonstrates a convenient approach for the construction of highly efficient and low-cost flexible solar cells.
2. Experimental section
Preparation of flexible ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe photoanodes
The ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanocrystals were prepared by surface selenization of ZnO nanosheets with Se2− ions to form ZnO/ZnSe core/shell nanocrystals, followed by partial conversion of ZnSe to CdSe through ion replacement in the ZnSe shells as illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, the ZnO nanosheets anchored on the surface of the Ti mesh were prepared by a two-step chemical deposition route according to a literature method.26 Briefly, a ZnO seed layer was prepared on Ti meshes by dip-coating in an alcohol solution containing zinc acetate and lithium hydroxide, followed by annealing at 350 °C for 15 min. Then the seeded substrate was placed into an aqueous solution containing zinc nitrate and urea (1.0 M) at 90 °C for 18 h. Finally, the resultant electrode was rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and annealed at 450 °C for 1 h to remove any residual organics and improve the crystalline structure. In order to obtain adequate thickness of the ZnSe layer, the ZnO nanosheets were firstly immersed in a 12 mM Se2− ion source solution (obtained by dissolving selenium powder and sodium borohydride in water) for 30 min at 55 °C. Then, the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanosheets were prepared by further reacting the ZnO/ZnSe nanosheet arrays with a Cd(NO3)2 solution (80 mM) for 0–5 h at 55 °C for the partial conversion of ZnSe to CdSe. Finally, the samples were washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C in air.

Fabrication of MC/Ti CEs and assembly of fully flexible QDSCs
The used mesoporous carbon with controlled morphology of microspheres was synthesized by a spray-drying technique according to a literature method.41 Briefly, the carbonaceous precursors (resorcinol and formaldehyde) are firstly pre-polymerized with the co-existence of a silica sol hard template to form polymer/silica mixture sol. Then the organic–inorganic mixture sol is fed into a high pressure gas enabled atomizer, in which the sol is atomized into small droplets. The droplets are carried by a high pressure air stream through a diffusion dryer at high temperature, in which most of the water contained in the droplets is evaporated instantaneously, resulting in dried polymer/silica microspheres. The formed dried microspheres then undergo the carbonization and silica removal procedure to yield the target MCs. The detailed preparation procedure for MCs is available in the ESI†. The preparation of carbon paste from the obtained MCs followed a literature approach.12 The carbon paste was filled into the Ti mesh for preparing MC/Ti CEs via a successive screen printing procedure followed by gradually drying at 120 °C about four times to get an appropriate thickness. Then the film was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in an Ar atmosphere. The solar cells were assembled with the prepared Ti mesh based photoanodes and counter electrodes. A piece of polypropylene (∼60 μm thickness) was used to separate the two electrodes. In order to avoid the leakage of electrolyte, the device was packaged with two pieces of the PET plastic film via the hot pressing method.42 The gel polysulfide electrolyte consisting of sodium polyacrylate, Na2S (2.0 M), and S (2.0 M) in aqueous solution was introduced into the gap between the two electrodes.43
Characterization
The morphologies of ZnO/ZnSe and ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructures were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; FEI Sirion, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed to determine the composition of the ZnO/ZnSe and ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructures. The microstructure of the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructure was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The crystal structures of ZnO, ZnO/ZnSe and ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructures were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD; XD-3, PG Instruments Ltd, Beijing, China) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at a scan rate of 2° per min. X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 36 kV and 20 mA, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of QDSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter illuminated under AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel, model no. 94022A). Light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with the use of a reference NREL Si solar cell. In the process of measurement, a circular black metallic tape with a 6.0 mm diameter aperture, which is slightly larger than the photoactive region of 5.5 mm diameter, was used as a shading mask. The active area of the device for the measurement of J–V curves is 0.237 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements were performed on an impedance analyzer (Zahner, Zennium) under dark conditions using sandwiched cells composed of two identical CEs placed face to face and the gel polysulfide electrolyte between them. The frequency for EIS measurements ranged from 100 mHz to 100 kHz, and the amplitude was set at 10 mV. The active area of the studied CEs is 0.36 cm2. The results were fitted by Z-view software.
3. Results and discussion
Formation and structure of the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe photoanode
The uniform vertically aligned ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanosheet was in situ grown on the smooth surface of woven Ti wires via a facile ion exchange process.26 SEM images of ZnO nanosheet arrays grown on the surface of Ti wires are shown in Fig. 1a, exhibiting the uniform covering of ZnO nanoflakes. As shown in Fig. 1b, at a higher magnification, the thickness of a single ZnO nanosheet is about 30–45 nm, and the surface of bare ZnO nanosheets is flat and has an ultra-thin sheet-like structure. The nanoflakes of ZnO provide a large surface area for the deposition of QDs, and the space between the nanosheets further presents an accessible open structure for the ion exchange process and the infiltration of electrolyte into the surface of QDs. Fig. 1c shows the porous ZnO/ZnSe nanosheet structure after dipping into the Se2− and Cd2+ ion aqueous solution in sequence. Compared to the ZnO/ZnSe nanosheets, the final ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanosheet structure shown in Fig. 1d is integrated and there are nearly no obvious open holes in the surface. The TEM images shown in Fig. 1e and f further confirm the formation of the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 1e, the TEM image at low-magnification indicates that the boundary of the nanoparticles is not clear and the edges of nanoparticles are rough and adjoin each other closely, which is a result of the compact deposition of CdSe QDs on the ZnO nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 1f, the single crystal has a fringe spacing of 0.19 nm, which matches well with the interplanar spacing of the (102) plane of hexagonal ZnO. Because the thickness of bare ZnO nanosheets is only 30–45 nm, the ZnSe and CdSe layers are flimsy and we can only see the lattice of ZnSe and CdSe QDs on the edge of the single crystalline ZnO. Clearly, the spacings of the nanocrystals are measured to be 0.28 and 0.33 nm, which are attributed to the interplanar spacing of the (200) and (111) planes of ZnSe respectively, while the interlayer spacings of nanoparticles are 0.21 and 0.35 nm, assignable to the interplanar spacing of the (220) and (111) planes of CdSe. The corresponding sample of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructures can also be confirmed by the results of EDS presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The EDS results show that the ratio of ZnO:ZnSe:CdSe is close to 3:2:1, indicating that the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructure was successfully constructed.

The formation of the claimed products is confirmed by the XRD results in terms of the crystal structure. The XRD patterns of ZnO, ZnO/ZnSe, and ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe after an ion exchange process for 2 h and 4 h are shown in Fig. 2. Curve a was obtained from a sample of ZnO nanosheet array grown on the Ti meshes. Besides the diffraction peaks from the Ti meshes, the pattern of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO is clearly observed. The strong and narrow diffraction peaks demonstrate good crystallinity of ZnO nanosheets. For curve b, the three wide, weak diffraction peaks located at 27.5°, 45.5° and 53.5°correspond to (111) and (220) planes of cubic ZnSe (JCPDF 37-1463) respectively, confirming the formation of ZnSe shells. Because of the low content of CdSe and small size of the formed CdSe QDs, the diffraction peaks of CdSe is too weak to be observed from curve c, the XRD pattern of a ZnO/ZnSe sample after Cd2+ ion exchange for 2 h. After extending the duration of the ion exchange process to 4 h, more ZnSe will transfer to CdSe and the size of CdSe QDs will increase. The diffraction peaks of (111) and (220) planes show a systematic shift to smaller angles in comparison with those in the ZnO/ZnSe sample shown in curve b, which correspond to the formation of CdSe (JCPDF 19-0191). This shift trend is consistent with Vegard's law, and can be explained by the increased lattice parameters with the formation of CdSe from ZnSe.44 Meanwhile, the intensity of the ZnSe diffraction peak reduced systematically with the extension of the Cd/Zn ion exchange process, which further confirmed the conversion process of ZnSe to CdSe.

Absorption spectra measurement was used to determine the optical properties of the bare ZnO, ZnO/ZnSe and ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructures. The bare ZnO nanosheet array absorbs only UV light of wavelength shorter than 400 nm. With the partial transfer of ZnO into ZnSe and the formation of ZnO/ZnSe, the absorption edge is shifted to ∼650 nm (2.28 eV) as shown in Fig. 3, which is a red shift compared to the bandgap of bulk ZnSe (2.7 eV). This observed extension of the light-harvesting range indicates type-II configuration for the ZnO/ZnSe heterostructure.45 As the duration of the Zn/Cd ion exchange process went on, more ZnSe nanostructures were converted into CdSe and the absorption edge showed a systematic red shift. When this ion exchange process was extended to 4 h, the absorption edge of the resultant ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe shifted around 800 nm. With overextension of the ion exchange process, the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanosheets dropped off from the Ti mesh substrate and resulted in slight shrinking of the absorption region.

Preparation and characterization of MC/Ti CEs
The mesoporous carbon (MC) microsphere catalytic materials were synthesized with controllable morphology using a spray drying technique according to a literature approach, which could not only reduce the production period and costs, but also enable continuous and controllable synthesis.41 The key strategy for the spray-drying technique is the formation and heating of atomized droplets containing the carbonaceous precursors and silica sol template. The obtained MCs have a uniform and discrete spherical morphology, high specific surface areas, and large pore volumes, which are critical features for electrocatalytic applications in serving as catalytic materials in CEs of QDSCs. The SEM image of MCs shown in Fig. 4a had considerable open macropores and mesopores on their external surface, facilitating the mass transport of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the porosity of the MC can be adjusted using different amounts of silica sol and the corresponding SEM images of the samples are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). For convenience, MC-n refers to the weight ratio of resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) to SiO2. A series of MC materials (MC-0.5, MC-0.75 and MC-1.0) with different silica sol contents were synthesized and characterized. The structural characterization data for each sample are available in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†). With increase of silica sol, the resulting carbons exhibited higher surface area and larger pore volume. The specific surface areas for MC-0.5, MC-0.75, and MC-1.0 are 1220, 1205, and 928 m2 g−1, respectively. The carbon pastes were then made by mixing the carbon materials with ethyl cellulose solution in terpineol.12 The CEs based on the MC with different surface areas were fabricated by screen printing the pastes on Ti mesh with identical thickness. The detailed procedure for the preparation of CEs is available in the ESI,† and the cross-section and top view images of the typical MC-0.75/Ti CE are shown in Fig. 4b and S4 (ESI†). To elucidate the electrocatalytic activity of different CEs, EIS measurements were carried out using symmetric cells composed of two identical CEs and the Nyquist plots corresponding to the different CEs are presented in Fig. 4c. The Nyquist plots were fitted by the Z-view software with an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S5,† and the corresponding extracted EIS parameters are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The EIS results reveal that the catalytic activities decrease in the order of MC-0.75/Ti > MC-0.5/Ti > MC-1.0/Ti, which is in conformity with the BET surface area measurements.12,46–49 Furthermore, the Tafel polarization curves shown in Fig. 4d were employed to scrutinize the catalytic activity of different CEs. The slopes of the anodic and cathodic traces at the Tafel zone reveal furthermore that MC-0.75/Ti is the best CE catalytic material compared with the other two (MC-0.5/Ti and MC-1.0/Ti). Therefore, the MC-0.75/Ti CE was chosen to assemble the fully flexible cell devices as discussed below.

Photovoltaic performance of the flexible solar cell
The assembled Ti mesh based flexible solar cells, with the schematic structure and digital photograph shown in Fig. 5, consisted of the photoanode with in situ grown ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanostructure arrays and CE with optimized MC-0.75 catalytic materials. A gel polysulfide electrolyte was used as the hole transfer material. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of flexible QDSCs based on photoanodes corresponding to different periods of the Cd/Zn ion exchange process are shown in Fig. 6, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. It is found that the photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell device is heavily dependent on the ion exchange duration. A series of duration time of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h were selected to investigate the relationship between the formed active layer in the photoanodes and the cell performance. Before the formation of CdSe QDs, ZnO/ZnSe derived cells showed poor photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 0.32%. It is clear that when the ion exchange time was increased from 0 to 4 h, the Jsc and Voc values were greatly enhanced from 3.59 to 15.27 mA cm−2 and from 0.187 to 0.632 V, respectively, resulting in the highest PCE of 5.07%. The possible reason for the improved performance is that with the extension of the ion exchange period, more CdSe is formed and coated on the surface of the ZnSe layer. The formed CdSe QDs can serve as a passivation layer to prevent the direct contact between the electrolyte and electron collector substrate, and therefore retarding the charge recombination at the photoanode interface leading to a higher Voc.35,39 Meanwhile, the increased Jsc is derived from the redshift of the absorption edge as shown in Fig. 6. This means a wider range of photons for the solar spectrum can be harvested by the QD light absorber and more charge carriers can be generated. While with overextension of the ion exchange period (herein 5 h), the respective samples show that ZnO nanosheets break off from the Ti mesh substrate and fall into the bottom of the beaker. More importantly, the adhesion of excess CdSe on the surface of Ti mesh was not firm due to the overly sacrificed ZnSe layer. The resultant poor contact between the substrate and nanostructures will cause large interfacial transfer resistance and deteriorate the photovoltaic performance. The Voc and PCE decrease obviously to 0.600 V and 4.46% although with a slight change in Jsc and FF. Therefore, the corresponding cells showed the best photovoltaic performance to date for a flexible QDSC with an average PCE of 5.07% when the Cd/Zn ion exchange duration was set at 4 h.13–16 Meanwhile, the performance achieved is superior to the previous value of 3.40% for the flexible ZnO/CdS/CdSe QDSCs with a Cu2S/brass CE.26 This may benefit from the in situ growth of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe heterojunction photoanodes and the high catalytic activity of MC/Ti CEs. We are confident that the reported low-cost and high-efficiency Ti mesh structured QDSCs may provide a promising approach toward the development of high efficiency flexible QDSC devices. Furthermore, in order to improve the efficiency of such flexible QDSCs, design and optimization of multinary nanocrystals coated on the surface of the Ti mesh substrate should be focused on. Also, challenges associated with the encapsulation technique of this mesh based flexible device need to be overcome before commercial utilization becomes possible.

4. Conclusion
In summary, high efficiency fully flexible Ti mesh-based QDSCs composed of ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe nanosheets as the photoanode active materials and MC as the CE catalytic materials were constructed. The duration of the Zn/Cd ion exchange process in the formation of the ZnO/ZnSe/CdSe active layer has a critical effect on the light-harvesting capacity and the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cell devices. Meanwhile, the internal structure of the MCs also has a significant influence on the performance of the cell devices. With the optimization of these parameters, a new efficiency record for flexible QDSCs with average PCE of 5.07% was achieved under the standard measurement conditions for these Ti mesh based fully flexible QDSCs. The reported facile flexible Ti mesh-based QDSCs may bring forward a new approach to the development of practical flexible solar cells.
